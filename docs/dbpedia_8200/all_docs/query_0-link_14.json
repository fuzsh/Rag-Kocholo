        "text": "(PDF Version - 323 K)\n\nHealth Canada is seeking feedback on proposed revisions to this guidance. Please visit the Consultation on proposed agile regulations and guidance for licensing drugs and medical devices for more information and to view the proposed draft guidance.\n\nGuidance Document\n\nPublished by authority of the Minister of Health\n\nDate Adopted: 2013/11/01\n\nDate Revised: 2015/06/13\n\nEffective Date: 2015/06/13\n\nForeword\n\nGuidance documents are meant to provide assistance to industry and healthcare professionals on how to comply with governing statutes and regulations. Guidance documents also provide assistance to staff on how Health Canada mandates and objectives should be implemented in a manner that is fair, consistent and effective.\n\nGuidance documents are administrative instruments not having force of law and, as such, allow for flexibility in approach. Alternate approaches to the principles and practices described in this document may be acceptable provided they are supported by adequate justification. Alternate approaches should be discussed in advance with the relevant program area to avoid the possible finding that applicable statutory or regulatory requirements have not been met.\n\nAs a corollary to the above, it is equally important to note that Health Canada reserves the right to request information or material, or define conditions not specifically described in this document, to allow the Department to adequately assess the safety, efficacy or quality of a therapeutic product. Health Canada is committed to ensuring that such requests are justifiable and that decisions are clearly documented.\n\nThis document should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notice and the relevant sections of other applicable guidance documents.\n\nDocument Change Log Version Guidance for Industry: Labelling of Pharmaceutical Drugs for Human Use Replaces Guidance for Industry: Labelling of Pharmaceutical Drugs for Human Use Date June 13, 2015 (posted September 3, 2015) Date January 10, 2014 Change June 13, 2015 (posted September 3, 2015) Nature of and/or Reason for Change Changes were made to the document to reflect an amendment to the Food and Drug Regulations that replaced Schedule F with Prescription Drug List. Other minor revisions were also made to the document [sections 2.10 and 3.4.3.4].\n\nChanges were made to the document to reflect amendments to the Food and Drug Regulations: Regulations Amending the Food and Drug Regulations (Labelling, Packaging and Brand Names of Drugs for Human Use) which came into force on June 13, 2015 for prescription products and those administered or obtained through a health professional.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1. Introduction\n\n1.1 Policy Objectives\n\nIt is Health Canada's policy that labelling of pharmaceutical drug products for human use:\n\ncomplies with the labelling requirements pursuant to sections 3, 9, and 10 of the Food and Drugs Act (the Act),as well as related provisions of the Food and Drug Regulations (the Regulations), the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and its related Regulations including the Narcotic Control Regulations, Parts G and J of the Food and Drug Regulations and the Benzodiazepines and Other Targeted Substances Regulations;\n\nis consistent with the Health Canada guidance documents and policies that apply to pharmaceutical drug products for human use; and\n\nsupports the safe and effective use of drug products by healthcare professionals, patients, and consumers.\n\n1.2 Scope and Application\n\nThis guidance document is applicable to pharmaceutical drug products for human use. It is not applicableto disinfectants, drug products for veterinary use, drug products used in clinical trials, drug products regulated solely as natural health products subject to the provisions of the Natural Health Products Regulations, and radiopharmaceuticals and biological drug products as listed in Schedules C and D of the Food and Drugs Act.\n\nThis guidance document contains:\n\nexcerpts from the Food and Drugs Act and Food and Drug Regulations, and related Acts and Regulations;\n\ndefinitions of terms; and\n\ncurrent interpretations of labelling requirements based on precedents, advisory opinions, and precedent drug product decisions.\n\nThe examples provided in this guidance are for illustrative purposes only and do not represent actual drug products.\n\n1.3 Background\n\nLabelling of Pharmaceutical Drugs for Human Use replaces the Health Canada guidance document Labelling of Drugs for Human Use. This guidance document came into effect in 1989, was subsequently revised in 1991, and has since been removed from circulation by Health Canada because much of its content was deemed to be out-of-date.\n\nThe purpose of this document is to provide guidance to sponsors to facilitate compliance with the labelling requirements pursuant to sections 3, 9, and 10 of the Food and Drugs Act as well as related provisions of the Food and Drug Regulations, the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and its related Regulations including the Narcotic Control Regulations, Parts G and J of the Food and Drug Regulations and the Benzodiazepines and Other Targeted Substances Regulations. This guidance should be used in conjunction with any other relevant Health Canada guidelines, policies and technical documents. Adherence to this guidance is expected to support the safe and effective use of drugs by health care professionals, patients and consumers.\n\nThe guidance document reflects comments from the draft posted to the Health Canada website on July 7, 2010 with a 120 day external stakeholder comment period ending November 7, 2010. There was substantial input from industry and industry associations representing innovator and generic companies as well as Health Canada employees. All stakeholder comments were considered in the finalization of this guidance document.\n\nThis document also reflects revisions made as a result of the Regulations Amending Certain Regulations Concerning Prescription Drugs (Repeal of Schedule F to the Food and Drug Regulations) which provided for the repeal of Schedule F and incorporation by reference of a list of prescription drugs. This regulatory amendment came into effect on December 19, 2013. In addition, on July 2, 2014, Health Canada published in Canada Gazette, Part II, other amendments to the Food and Drug Regulations. The Regulations Amending the Food and Drug Regulations (Labelling, Packaging and Brand Names of Drugs for Human Use) introduced targeted amendments to emphasize the importance of plain language labelling. These regulatory amendments come came into force on June 13, 2015 for prescription products and products which are administered or obtained through a health professional. This guidance document reflects the new requirements set out in the above amendments as well as comments from stakeholders received during the consultation period for the Plain Language Labelling amendments, which took place from July to September 2014.\n\n2. General Labelling Requirements\n\nThe labelling of drug products is governed by sections 3, 9, and 10 of the Act and by sections contained in Parts A, C, D, G, and J of the Regulations. Part A is more general and refers to the labelling of food and drug products, whereas parts C, D, G, and J refer to drug products only.\n\nSection 9 of the Act states that:\n\nNo person shall label, package, treat, process, sell or advertise any drug in a manner that is false, misleading or deceptive or is likely to create an erroneous impression regarding its character, value, quantity, composition, merit or safety.\n\nA drug that is not labelled or packaged as required by, or is labelled or packaged contrary to, the Regulations shall be deemed to be labelled or packaged contrary to subsection (1).\n\nSection 3 of the Act states that:\n\nNo person shall advertise any food, drug, cosmetic or device to the general public as a treatment, preventative or cure for any of the diseases, disorders or abnormal physical states referred to in Schedule A.\n\nNo person shall sell any food, drug, cosmetic or device\n\nthat is represented by label, or\n\nthat the person advertises to the general public as a treatment, preventative or cure for any of the diseases, disorders or abnormal physical states referred to in Schedule A.\n\nFor exceptions to section 3(1) of the Act, please refer to section 2.7, \"Schedule A Claims,\" of this guidance. Sponsors should consult the Regulations for specific labelling requirements for specific drug products, as this information is not part of this guidance document. For more information on section 10 of the Act, please refer to section 3.4.3 of this guidance.\n\n2.1 Placement of Information\n\nSpecific requirements of the Food and Drug Regulations for the placement of information on labels are summarized below. Health Canada's interpretation of these requirements is further detailed in Section 3, \"Label Information,\" of this guidance document.\n\n2.1.1 Principal Display Panel\n\nThe principal display panel (that is (i.e.) main panel) is the main product display surface visible to the user under normal or customary conditions of display or use. Pursuant to sections C.01.004 and C.01.005 of the Regulations, the principal display panel of aninner and outer label must normally showFootnote 1the following information:\n\nThe brand name of the drug product or if no brand name exists the proper or common name of the drug product, if applicable;\n\nThe proper or common name of the drug product, if applicable;\n\nThe standard for the drug product, if any;\n\nThe notation \"sterile (stérile),\" if required by the Regulations;\n\nThe symbol corresponding to the appropriate schedule or to a drug containing an ingredient listed in the Prescription Drug List (if applicable); and\n\nThe Drug Identification Number (DIN).\n\n2.1.2 Any Panel\n\nPursuant to section C.01.004 of the Regulations, the following information must normallyFootnote 2 be displayed on any panel of the inner and outer labels:\n\nThe name and address of the manufacturer/sponsor and of the distributor if the manufacturer/sponsor is not Canadian;\n\nThe lot number;\n\nThe expiration date;\n\nAdequate directions for use of the drug product; and\n\nA quantitative list of the medicinal ingredients of the drug product.\n\nThe following information is to be displayed on any panel of the outer label:\n\nThe net amount of the drug product in the container in terms of weight, measure or number (for example (e.g.) number of tablets); and\n\nA quantitative list of all preservatives in parenteral preparations and of all mercurial preservatives in any drug product containing mercury or a salt or derivative thereof as a preservative.\n\nFor prescription pharmaceutical products and those products administered or obtained through a health professional, section C.01.004.01(1) requires that\n\nLabels of drugs for human use in dosage form include information for a contact person in Canada (e.g. , telephone number, email address, website address, postal address or other information that allows communication) and\n\nA statement that harms associated with the use of the drug can be reported to that person.\n\nExamples of acceptable statements include: \"For questions or to report problems, please contact...\" or \"Questions or concerns\", followed by the contact information. The name of the contact person does not need to be listed.\n\n2.2 Official Languages\n\nThe Regulations state that:\n\nThe adequate directions for use required to be shown on the inner and outer labels of a drug pursuant to section C.01.004 (1) (c) (iii) shall be in both the French and English languages if the drug is available for sale without a prescription in an open self-selection area. (section A.01.015 (2))\n\nAn \"open self-selection area\" is a retail area where a drug product is freely available for selection and purchase by the general public. Therefore, prescription drug products, drug products available in hospitals and clinics only, or drug products for professional use only do not require bilingual labelling. The manufacturer/sponsor can label these drug products in the customer's choice of language.\n\nNote that some provincial regulatory requirements may go beyond existing federal Regulations and may specify further labelling language requirements.\n\nThere is no objection to the use of additional languages in product labelling (e.g., inserts), at the discretion of the sponsor, provided this does not obscure the readability of the label in either or both official languages, English and French.\n\nNote: As of June 13, 2015, new requirements for the filing of mock-ups of labels and packages apply to prescription products and those products administered or obtained through a health professional. Additionally, the requirement to submit final labels at the time of market notification is repealed for these products as of this date. As a result, Health Canada expects that sponsors will file bilingual mock-ups of the labels and packaging at the time of submissionFootnote 3 for prescription products and those administered or obtained through a health professional as of June 13, 2015. For more information on this provision, please see section 2.10 of this guidance.\n\n2.3 Legibility\n\nThe Regulations are flexible regarding type size. However the Regulations state:\n\nAll information required to appear on a label of a food or drug shall be:\n\nclearly and prominently displayed on the label; and\n\nreadily discernible to the purchaser or consumer under the customary conditions of purchase and use (section A.01.016).\n\nFor prescription products and those products administered or obtained through a health professional, as of June 13, 2015, section A.01.017 sets out new requirements:\n\nEvery label of a drug for human use in dosage form shall meet the following conditions:\n\nthe information that is required by these Regulations to appear on the label shall be\n\nprominently displayed,\n\nreadily discernible to the purchaser or consumer under the customary conditions of purchase and use, and\n\nexpressed in plain language; and\n\nthe format of the label, including the manner in which its text and any graphics are displayed on it, shall not impede comprehension of the information referred to in paragraph (a).\n\nSponsors should consider the colour, contrast, position, and spacing of the information when complying with the above general requirement. The format of the label including the manner in which all of its text and any graphics are displayed on it, shall not impede comprehension of the information referred to in (a) above. Health Canada recommends a font size of ten points for the consumer information/patient medication information and package insert text and a minimum of nine points for inner and outer labels and tables for the labelling of the consumer information/patient medication information and package inserts, preferably all labelling in Sans Serif type font, to avoid any problems in legibility. It is recognized that under some conditions such as font type, colour, contrast, spacing and other factors, smaller font size may be legible, but it is the manufacturer's/sponsor's responsibility to ensure that this is readable to most people with normal vision. For further information, concerning the consumer information/patient medication information format, content and readability refer to the Guidance to Industry: Product Monograph.\n\n2.4 Abbreviations\n\nGenerally the proper or common names of the drug product and any ingredient in the drug product should not be abbreviated.\n\nThe names of pharmacopoeiamay be abbreviated as indicated in Schedule B of the Act. Units of weight, volume, or potency may be abbreviated according to the Weights and Measures Act or where that abbreviation is in common use and considered to be understood by the healthcare professional or consumer. Standard units of measure and abbreviations (e.g., ounces, oz.) may be included on the label provided that the metric units are also present. Recognized abbreviations for microgram are \"μg\" and \"mcg.\" The symbol \"µg\" conforms to the International System of Units and is often used in scientific literature. However, regarding drug product labelling, Health Canada recommends that the abbreviation \"mcg\" be used. This use of \"μg\" may be difficult to see in some print and size formats and might be misread as the prefix \"mg.\".\n\nAbbreviations used exclusively to describe routes of administration (e.g., \"i.v.\" \"For intravenous injection\") or other product attributes are generally discouraged in consumer labelling and most product monographs, prescribing information documents and prescription labels. Abbreviations should be explained in full at least once if used elsewhere in the labelling. Only labels affixed to small containers (e.g., vials, ampoules) may contain only an abbreviation (e.g., i.v.) provided that the outer labelling (e.g., carton) indicates the term in full.\n\nFor further information regarding the use of abbreviations in drug product labelling, see the resources listed in Appendix C.\n\n2.5 Reference to the Act and Regulations\n\nThe Regulations state that:\n\nNo reference, direct or indirect, to the Act or to these Regulations shall be made upon any label or in any advertisement for a drug unless such reference is a specific requirement of the Act or these Regulations (section C.01.007)\n\nLabels that may be considered in violation of section C.01.007 are those that make any mention of Health Canada or a component of Health Canada. This includes but is not limited to the following phrases and symbols:\n\nHealth Canada approved, Health Products and Food Branch (HPFB) approved, Therapeutic Products Directorate (TPD) approved;\n\nRegistered (endorsed, promoted, acceptable or recommended) by Health Canada, (HPFB, TPD, or any other acronym commonly associated with Health Canada); or\n\nUse of the Health Canada logo.\n\n2.6 Voluntary Industry Guidelines\n\nThis guidance document provides an interpretation of the minimum label requirements for pharmaceutical drug products. Numerous third party guidance documents exist, many by independent professional associations or public interest groups, which provide further optional guidance for labelling. Additional product labelling, standardized formatting, or other considerations suggested by these documents are acceptable provided they do not conflict with regulatory requirements. See Appendix C for other sources of guidance for labelling.\n\n2.7 Schedule A Claims\n\nSection 3 of the Act prohibits the labelling and advertising of a drug product to the general public, as a treatment, preventative, or cure for the diseases, disorders, or abnormal physical states, including synonymous names, listed in Schedule A of the Act. However, there are three cases where Schedule A diseases can be mentioned in labelling:\n\nPursuant to section C.01.010 of the Regulations, where mention of the condition is necessary to provide adequate directions for the safe use of a parenteral drug product or a drug containing an ingredient listed in the Prescription Drug List (i.e. prescription drug);\n\nWhen such conditions are mentioned as part of precautions or contraindications; and\n\nUnder sections A.01.066 to A.01.068 of the Regulations, non-prescription drug products can be labelled with a preventive claim related to a disease listed in Schedule A. Refer to the Health Canada guidance document, Schedule A and Section 3 to the Food and Drugs Act, effective October 26, 2011, for further information. Note that pre- market authorization is required for these preventative claims as outlined in this guidance.\n\n2.8 Novel Label Formats\n\nNovel label formats such as peel-back, accordion labels, tags, collar labels, rotating sleeve bottle labels, and labels on the inside of cartons, bottom of containers, or in any other unusual locations may be acceptable provided that:\n\ngaining access to these labels does not destroy or harm the integrity of the labelling (i.e. it can be read after opening);\n\nconsumers and patients are alerted to the location of the labelling information; and\n\nplacement of information does not otherwise contravene the Regulations.\n\nInformation required by the Regulations (C.01.004) to be on the inner and outer label (e.g., brand name, proper or common name, potency, DIN, manufacturer/sponsor, and indication, class or purpose) must be clearly visible. Also, it should be read without the need to further manipulate a novel label format (see section 2.1.1 and section 2.1.2). In other words, obtaining this critical information does not require the opening or destruction of any outer label, the opening of an accordion label, the opening of a panel, or the opening of the carton itself to gain access to information on the inside.\n\nNote: For prescription products and those products administered or obtained through a health professional, as of June 13, 2015, section C.01.004.01(1) sets out new requirements:\n\nC.01.004.01 (1) Every label of a drug for human use in dosage form shall display the following:\n\na telephone number, email address, website address, postal address or any other information that enables communication with a contact person in Canada; and\n\na statement to the effect that any injury to a person's health that is suspected of being associated with the use of the drug may be reported to the contact person.\n\n(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to the labels of a drug that is listed in Schedule C or D to the Act and that is in dosage form.\n\nFor examples of acceptable statements please see section 2.1.2 of this Guidance.\n\nThese novel label formats should be clearly identified and explained in the drug product submission.\n\n2.9 Bar Codes\n\nBar codes may be used on a drug product label for appropriate purposes (retail inventory, tracking, confirmation of identity, or potency) provided that:\n\nall regulatory requirements concerning the label have been met and the bar code information does not change the terms of market authorization for the product; and\n\nthe bar code does not obscure or displace the required and approved information on the label, especially on small product labels.\n\nSee Appendix C of this guidance for further information.\n\n2.10 Final Labels\n\nFinal labels (in English and/or French) should accurately represent the marketed labels, including final complete text, text layout, font size, and text order as well as any other symbols, pictures, notations, diagrams, graphs, pictorials, logos , and visible marks which could be considered therapeutic label content (e.g., pictures of electroencephalography or [EEG] recordings). Such marks or label content may state or imply certain therapeutic benefits or attributes that are inconsistent with the terms of market authorization for the drug product and may be in contravention of the Act and Regulations.\n\nAll proposed photographs or equivalent should be submitted, as a description of the image is not considered sufficient. There have been photographs added to drug product labelling following review, which have been found to be misleading and in violation of the Act. Photographs or equivalent, other than those intended to assist in directions for use or product safety are discouraged, due to potential to mislead the patient/consumer (e.g., lifestyle pictures for drug products intended for serious conditions).\n\nMaterial considered artwork (e.g., colour, design, abstract, and flashes) as well as the design, contrast and texture of the paper cannot imply misleading therapeutic attributes of the product. These factors should not impact the readability of the labels. Manufacturers/sponsors are responsible for ensuring that final labels are clearly written, legible and consistent with the approved market authorization.\n\nPrescription Products and Products Administered or Obtained Through a Health Professional\n\nAs of June 13, 2015, and pursuant to C.01.014.1(2)(m.1) and C.08.002(2)(j.1), bilingual mock-ups of the final labels (including mock-ups of the inner and outer label and package), the package insert and the Product Monograph are required at the time of submission. Note that for these products only, as of June 13, 2015, the regulatory requirement in C.01.014.3 to submit final labels after the drug is available for sale, is repealed.\n\nProducts Other than Prescription and Those Administered or Obtained Through a Health Professional\n\nThe written text of proposed labels or in the case of a new drug, drafts of every label, are required at the time of submission in accordance with sections C.01.014.1 (2)(m) and C.08.002(2)(j). Although not required, sponsors may provide mock-ups of the final labels at the time of submission. Note that final labels must be submitted at the time of market notification as per section C.01.014.3.\n\n3. Label Information\n\nThe definition of label in the Act (see Appendix A: Definitions) is interpreted to include labels affixed to the container or packaging of the drug, any separate package inserts, product monographs, prescribing information, fact sheets, consumer information/patient medication information (i.e., patient leaflets), patient diaries, or other material containing information specific to the drug product. These separate package labels generated by the manufacturer/sponsor may be included in the packaging or supplied to the consumer at the time of dispensing.\n\nHealth Canada generally considers labels affixed by pharmacists to fall under the practice of pharmacy and therefore be regulated by the provinces and territories. Nevertheless, regulatory provisions exist in the Food and Drug Regulations that are directed at pharmacy labels (e.g. C.01.005(2)) indicating that the definition of 'label' in the Food and Drugs Act is considered to encompass these labels.\n\n3.1 Labelling Versus Other Product Information\n\nCertain drug product information, such as advertising, promotional material and general disease information are generally not considered to be drug product labelling and should not appear in the labelling and packaging material. Differentiating this material from labelling is often difficult.\n\nCertain manufacturer/sponsor generated product information distributed to patients and consumers at the time of dispensing may or may not be considered labelling, as follows:\n\nNot likely to be considered labelling:\n\nInformation regarding a disease that provides a comprehensive, balanced, and complete discussion of treatment options and does not emphasize a particular drug product or therapy is not considered labelling. This material should not be included in the product labelling.\n\nPossibly considered labelling, depending on use:\n\nMeal plans (e.g., an aid for those taking cholesterol-lowering drug products);\n\nPatient diaries to record diet, exercise, weight loss; and\n\nLifestyle advice in support of a drug therapy (e.g., auxiliary methods to cope with a smoking cessation regimen).\n\nLikely unacceptable material that is not suitable in product labelling if distributed to patients includes: advertising or promotional material.\n\nIn addition, drug product information in the form of scientific papers, symposia, review articles, reports, or summaries produced by bodies independent of the manufacturer/sponsor (e.g., scientists, researchers, healthcare professionals, patient interest groups, healthcare professional associations, public bodies, and governments), should not be included as the information may not be balanced.\n\n3.1.1 Distribution at the Time of Dispensing\n\nManufacturer/sponsor generated labelling, distributed at the time of dispensing or purchase, containing information that improves patient compliance or contributes to the effective and safe use of the drug product should be submitted and subject to a Health Canada review.\n\nIf the above material mentions the brand name, product name, or several products to be used together (e.g., statin and a diuretic), then it is considered labelling and subject to a Health Canada review. In other cases, the context and use of this information must be examined on an individual basis to determine whether the material is labelling or other information, such as advertising or general disease information which is not considered appropriate.\n\nLabelling material containing non-drug product information (e.g., general disease information), should be submitted to Health Canada for review. This information would be reviewed with respect to the Act and Regulations to determine whether it is appropriate to include this information in the drug product package. Much of this auxiliary information has been refused as it may be irrelevant, confusing, or misleading, as the consumer may feel this information and directions it may contain are necessary for treatment, when this is not the case. Part III of the Product Monograph, Consumer Information/ Patient Medication Information, is considered to be the complete and sufficient product information.\n\nAny other auxiliary product information that may have been endorsed by third parties, such as the Pharmaceutical Advertising Advisory Board (PAAB) should not be included in, attached to or distributed with the drug product package at the time of dispensing of the product. Healthcare professionals (e.g., doctors) may distribute this auxiliary information (e.g., PAAB reviewed material) independently of the drug product package information, at their own discretion.\n\n3.1.2 Distribution after Dispensing and Purchase\n\nAny auxiliary labelling material that exceeds the limits of market authorization for the drug product, such as representing new claims or indications, should be submitted to Health Canada for review.\n\nAuxiliary material which is distributed after the drug product is dispensed does not require a review by Health Canada if it is consistent with the approved product labelling. Manufacturers/sponsors should continue to voluntarily forward this material for review to an independent, self-regulated, industry body (e.g., the Pharmaceutical Advertising Advisory Board), which voluntarily reviews post-market, product-specific material.\n\nAdditional information is provided in the Health Canada policy document, The Distinction between Advertising and Other Activities listed in Appendix B.\n\n3.2 Inner Label\n\nIn Section A.01.010 of the Regulations, the inner label is the label affixed to an immediate container of the drug product.\n\n3.3 Outer Label\n\nIn Section A.01.010 of the Regulations, the outer label includes any label affixed to the drug product packaging, such as a pouch, card, accordion label, or other construct. There may be more than one outer label in a multiple packaging scheme (e.g., a vial packaged in a pouch, pouch enclosed in a carton, several cartons enclosed in a larger carton). Where a package of a drug product has only one label, that label must carry all the information required on the inner and outer labels (section C.01.006).\n\nA shipping carton, unless it is also the immediate container, or the outside of the package unit distributed to the consumer or healthcare professional, is not subject to the labelling provisions of Part C, Division 1, of the Regulations. However, manufacturers/sponsors should note that shipping cartons must be labelled to ensure compliance with the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) requirements of Part C, Division 2, of the Regulations and associated guidance documents (see Appendix B). Health Canada recommends that manufacturers/sponsors label the shipping carton with sufficient information to enable product identification (e.g., brand name, common or proper name, strength, and manufacturer's/sponsor's name, and Drug Identification Number).\n\n3.4 Main Panel\n\nThis subsection provides detailed information to be included on the main panel of an inner and/or outer label.\n\n3.4.1 Brand Name\n\nThe brand name is the name assigned by the manufacturer/sponsor and approved by Health Canada in connection with a drug product at the time of market authorization. In the case of a new drug, the brand name is the name that appears on the Notice of Compliance. For Division 1 drugsFootnote 4, the brand name is the name appearing on the Drug Notification Form issued for the drug product and signed by the manufacturer/sponsor. The brand name must be consistent on all labelling. Note that a brand name is not required if manufacturer/sponsor chooses to use a common or proper name instead of a brand name as the drug product name (e.g., Acetylsalicylic Acid Tablets).\n\nAny alteration of the brand name of a new drug from the original market authorization issued by Health Canada requires the submission and approval of a New Drug Submission (NDS) or Administrative New Drug Submission pursuant to section C.08.003 (2) (b) of the Regulations. If the drug product received market authorization as a Division 1 drug1, a new application for a Drug Identification Number (DIN) should be submitted and prior approval is required before the new name can be used. For further information, see the Health Canada policy document, Changes in Manufacturer's Name and/or Product Name.\n\nThe Health Canada approved brand name must be presented in a continuous, uninterrupted fashion on the label, and be clearly evident to consumers and healthcare professionals.\n\n3.4.2 Proper or Common Name\n\nPursuant to section C.01.004 (1) (a) of the Regulations, when a drug producthas a proper or a common name, this name must appear on the main panel of the inner and outer labels. Proper or common names should not be abbreviated. In the case of official drugs labelled with a brand name, the lettering of the proper name must be in type not less than half the size of the brand name and must immediately precede or follow the brand name.\n\nFor drug products labelled without a brand name, the proper or common name of the drug product must be shown on the main panel.\n\n3.4.2.1 Proper Name\n\nThe proper name for an ingredient is considered to be the name:\n\nassigned to that ingredient in section C.01.002 of the Regulations;\n\nthat appears in boldface type in other sections of the Regulations; or\n\nassigned to the ingredient in the titles of monographs of Schedule B publications.\n\nWhere a proper name for an ingredient appears both in the Regulations and in one or more Schedule B publications, the name appearing in the Regulations takes precedence.\n\nThe proper name for a drug product includes the dosage form and is the name assigned to that final product in one of the Schedule B publications (e.g., Azithromycin Capsules).\n\nOfficial synonyms for proper names listed in some Schedule B publications may be used instead of the title of the monograph, except where the synonyms are abbreviations or are in a language other than French or English. For example, the British Pharmacopoeia (BP)lists acceptable synonyms in Appendix XXI and these may be used in place of the non-abbreviated name. This practice is not allowed in the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP).\n\nSome illustrative examples of proper names for ingredients versus products in final dosage form include the following:\n\nProper name of ingredient: Acetaminophen;\n\nProper name of drug product in final dosage form:Acetaminophen Capsules;\n\nProper name of a drug product combination: Acetaminophen and Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride Tablets.\n\nThe standard of manufacture (e.g., United States Pharmacopoeia [USP], British Pharmacopoeia (BP), European Pharmacopoeia [Ph.Eur.])should be shown in close proximity (see Appendix A, Definitions) to the proper name (e.g., Acetaminophen Capsules USP, Acetaminophen and Pseudoephedrine Capsules USP).\n\nNote: In the USP the term \"aspirinFootnote 5\" appears as a proper name for an ingredient and as a proper name for a drug product in final dosage form (e.g., Aspirin Tablets). However, in Canada, Acetylsalicylic Acid is the prescribed name (i.e. proper name) for this ingredient as outlined in section C.01.002 of the Regulations. In this case, the name in the Regulations takes precedence and if it meets USP requirements, the final product is labelled in Canada as Acetylsalicylic Acid Tablets USP.\n\n3.4.2.2 Common Name\n\nA common name is used in the case where there is no proper name. The common name of a drug substance is a name chosen by a respected body responsible for drug nomenclature, often with international recognition (e.g., International Non-proprietary Name [INN], United States Adopted Name [USAN], and British Approved Name [BAN]). The common name of a drug product consists of the common name of the drug substance and the dosage form.\n\nFor drug substances in the form of a salt where there is no existing common name for the drug product, the naming conventions outlined in the USP Nomenclature Policy (See Appendix C) are used to determine the common name of the drug product:\n\nWhere the strength is expressed in terms of the salt, the same salt is used as the common name for the drug product.\n\nWhere the strength is expressed in the terms of a free acid or base, the same acid or base is used in the common name of the drug product, and the name of the complete salt is also shown near this common name, on the main panel of the label. Example (where the strength is expressed in terms of the base): Brand X Antibacterial Agent, Moxifloxacin Tablets 400 milligram (mg) (as moxifloxacin hydrochloride).\n\nAs the Regulations require that the proper or common names of the drug products must appear on the main panel of the label, the USP Nomenclature Policy and the additional provision above, ensure that the complete salt is also shown on the main panel. These provisions ensure that the product identity is clear and prevents inappropriate substitutions of one salt for another, where differences in the pharmaceutical or pharmacological properties may cause adverse effects.\n\nWith respect to different solvated forms (e.g., including hydrates), the complete common name, including the solvated form, should be stated somewhere on the label (i.e. it does not have to appear on the main panel, as per the salts).\n\n3.4.2.3 Pharmaceutical Form\n\nWhere a proper or common name for a drug product does not exist (e.g., for a multiple ingredient product), the pharmaceutical form should be shown on the main panel of the inner and outer label.\n\n3.4.3 Standard of Manufacture\n\nThis section refers to the standard to which a drug product is manufactured and represented. The term standard can be applied to a drug product or to an ingredient.\n\nPursuant to subsection C.01.004 (1) of the Regulations, where a standard prescribed by the Regulations exists (see Section 3.4.3.1, \"Prescribed Standard\") and it applies to the specific drug product, it shall be included on the principal display (main) panel of the inner and outer labels. Where no standard has been prescribed, but a pharmacopoeial standard exists (see Section 3.4.3.2, \"Pharmacopoeial Standard\") and it applies to the standard proposed by the manufacturer for the specific drug product, the principal display (main) panel of the inner and outer labels shall name the publication containing the standard used.\n\n3.4.3.1 Prescribed Standard\n\nThe Act states:\n\nWhere a standard has been prescribed for a drug, no person shall label, package, sell or advertise any substance in such a manner that is likely to be mistaken for that drug, unless the substance complies with the prescribed standard. (Subsection 10(1))\n\nA prescribed standard is a standard prescribed by the Regulations. A list of Canadian Standard Drugs (CSD) can be found in Division 6 of the Regulations.\n\nDrug products containing these drug substances as single ingredients may be sold only if they are labelled with the CSD standard and if they conform in all aspects to that standard. A pharmacopoeial or manufacturer's standard cannot be used for these drug products.\n\n3.4.3.2 Pharmacopoeial Standard\n\nThe Act states:\n\nWhere a standard has not been prescribed for a drug, but a standard for the drug is contained in any publication referred to in Schedule B, no person shall package, label, sell or advertise any substance in such a manner that is likely to be mistaken for that drug, unless the substance complies with the standard. (Subsection 10(2))\n\nPharmacopoeial standards are for those drug products contained in the publications listed in Schedule B to the Act and for which no standard has been prescribed in the Regulations.\n\nWhen a pharmacopoeial standard is declared on the drug product label, the labelling provisions that are included in the section of the official monograph and those that are required by the general notices of the pharmacopoeial standard should be met.\n\nWhen a pharmacopoeial standard is declared, the drug product must meet the current version of the pharmacopoeia. A manufacturer/sponsor cannot claim to meet a previous version of the pharmacopoeial standard.\n\n3.4.3.3 Manufacturer's Standard\n\nA manufacturer/sponsor may choose to manufacture a drug product to the pharmacopoeial standard (e.g., USP) or to the manufacturer's own standard and label the product as a house standard (e.g., manufacturer's name standard). In accordance with section C.01.011 of the Regulations, no person shall use a manufacturer's standard for a drug that provides (a) lesser degree of purity than the highest degree of purity, or (b) a greater variation in potency than the least variation of potency, provided for that drug in any publication mentioned in Schedule B to the Act.\n\nA manufacturer's/sponsor's use of a house standard on a label indicates that the drug product may differ in some respect from the pharmacopoeial standard. (See section C.01.011 (4) of the Regulations.) Sponsors can refer to their own standards as house, firm, or manufacturer's standard.\n\nThe following expressions are considered acceptable to describe a manufacturer's standard:\n\nHouse Standard, or House Std.\n\nManufacturer's Standard or Mfr. Std.\n\nFirm X Standard or Firm X Std.\n\n3.4.3.4 Professed Standard\n\nThe Act states:\n\nWhere a standard for a drug has not been prescribed and no standard for the drug is contained in any publication referred to in Schedule B, no person shall sell the drug, unless:\n\nit is in accordance with the professed standard under which it is sold; and\n\nit does not resemble, in any manner likely to deceive, any drug for which a standard has been prescribed or is contained in any publication referred to in Schedule B. (subsection 10(3)).\n\nThis section refers to non-official drug products for which no standard prescribed in the Act or Regulations or pharmacopoeial standard exists. The \"professed standard\" refers only to the label claims for quality and potency, and manufacturers/sponsors are required to set their own standards within certain limits outlined in the Regulations.\n\nThe label of such drug products should not carry any standard (e.g., \"house standard\" or \"name of company standard)\" as this may give the misleading impression that the product meets a prescribed or pharmacopoeial standard. The words \"professed standard\" should not be displayed on the labels.\n\nIt is not mandatory to declare a standard for the drug product's ingredients. However, if a manufacturer/sponsor chooses to do so, the manufacturer/sponsor must ensure that the ingredient is contained in the current edition of the pharmacopoeoia that is referred to and should not be shown on the main panel of the label, as it might be mistaken for a pharmacopoeial standard for the drug product.\n\n3.4.3.5 Placement of Standard on Labelling\n\nWhere a standard of manufacture is to be shown on a label (see subsections 10(1) and (2) of the Act), this standard should be declared near the prescribed or proper name of the drug product. The quantitative amounts may be indicated before or after the prescribed or proper name (e.g., Conjugated Estrogen Tablets CSD 1.25 mg, Acetaminophen Tablets USP, 325 mg).\n\n3.4.3.6 Updating Standards\n\nWhere a pharmacopoeial standard has been updated and the manufacturer/sponsor has been declaring that standard for that drug product or ingredient, it is the manufacturer's/sponsor's responsibility to update the processes and specifications of that product or ingredient, and to submit the appropriate submission where required.\n\n3.4.3.7 New Pharmacopoeial Standards\n\nWhere no standard existed previously and a new pharmacopoeial standard has been created for an ingredient or drug product and where the standard applies to the manufacturer's/sponsor's product, it is the manufacturer's/sponsor's responsibility to adjust the drug product or specifications to meet or exceed the standard and to revise the labelling if required.\n\n3.4.3.8 Pharmacopoeial Standards for Modified-Release Dosage Forms\n\nIf an immediate-release drug product is listed in a Schedule B publication and there is not a Schedule B monograph for the modified-release form of the product (e.g. delayed-release or extended-release), the modified-release product should be considered a Professed Standard ( i.e. cannot declare a pharmacopoeial standard).\n\n3.4.4 Sterility\n\nWhere a drug product is required to be sterile by the Regulations (section C.01.065), then the notation \"sterile\" \"(stérile)\" must normallyFootnote 6 be shown on the principal display panel of the inner and outer label in accordance with section C.01.004 (1) (a) (v).\n\n3.4.5 Scheduling Symbols or Pr for drugs containing an ingredient listed in the Prescription Drug List\n\nPursuant to section C.01.004 (1) (b) of the Regulations, the appropriate symbol for drug products listed in the Schedule to Part G to the Regulations, the schedules to the Narcotic Control Regulations and the Benzodiazepines and Other Targeted Substances Regulations or containing an ingredient listed in the Prescription Drug List must appear in the upper left quarter of the principal display (main) panel of the label. Refer to the appropriate regulation for specific requirements concerning size, colour, and shape of the symbols.\n\nWhen a drug product contains a combination of ingredients from two or more of the schedules or ingredients listed in the Prescription Drug List, only the scheduling symbol corresponding to the more stringent control is required on the label. In these instances, the Narcotic Control Regulations are the most stringent, followed by the Controlled Drug and Substances Regulations, the Benzodiazepines and Targeted Substances Regulations, and the Prescription Drug List.\n\nThe one exception to the above interpretation is when the narcotic present in the combination is codeine in an amount that does not require a prescription (e.g., 8 mg). In this instance, the symbol \"N\" is required and, depending on the other ingredients, possibly a \"C\" symbol or the \"Pr\" symbol. If the drug product bears a \"C\" or \"Pr\" symbol, then a prescription is still required.\n\n3.4.6 Drug Identification Number\n\nThe principal display panel of the inner and outer label of a drug product sold in dosage form (a form in which it is ready for consumer use without requiring further manufacturing) must normallyFootnote 7 show the DIN assigned and preceded by the words \"Drug Identification Number\" or \"Drogue identification numérique,\" or both, or the letters \"DIN\" (Regulations, section C.01.005(1)).\n\n3.5 Any Panel\n\nThis subsection provides further detailed information to be included on any other panel of an inner and outer label.\n\n3.5.1 Name and Address of Manufacturer/Sponsor\n\nPursuant to Section A.01.10 of the Regulations, the manufacturer/sponsor or distributor is the \"person,\" including an association or partnership (which can also mean business or corporation under that name), that sells a drug product (i.e. owns the DIN). The manufacturer/sponsor or distributor can own the DIN. The manufacturer is not necessarily the fabricator. Where more than one name appears on the label, each person mentioned may be held responsible for compliance with the requirements of the Act and Regulations.\n\nThe Regulations require that the label display the name and address of the manufacturer/sponsor or manufacturers/sponsors (Section C.01.004). If the address shown is not Canadian, then the name of the Canadian importer and the name and address of the distributor must be added (Section C.01.004.1). The importer and distributor may be two (2) separate entities or they could be the same, in which case only a single name and address showing the responsible Canadian agent needs to be shown on the label.\n\nThe address should be sufficiently complete so that Canada Post could deliver a letter mailed to that address. For Canadian manufacturers/sponsors, it may suffice to have the name of the city and province. For distinct cities, the province may be omitted and \"Canada\" used instead. The postal code should be included in all cases. Any non-Canadian addresses that appear on the label should include the name of the country. Refer to the Canada Post Addressing Guide for more information (www.canadapost.ca).\n\nThe address must be sufficient to ensure delivery of a letter through the various postal systems involved in the delivery.\n\nFor prescription products and those obtained or administered through a health professional, as of June 13, 2015, C.01.004.01(1) requires contact information in Canada to report 'harms' that may be associated with the product. For further information on the type of contact information and language to be included, see section 2.1.2 of this Guidance.\n\n3.5.2 Lot Number\n\nThe lot number may be any combination of letters, figures, or both (section A.01.010 of the Regulations) by which a drug product can be traced to the manufacturer/sponsor and, if applicable, to the distributor or importer. This number should be preceded by the words \"Lot Number\" or a suitable abbreviation (i.e. Lot No., Lot, L.), and must appear on any panel of the inner and outer labels (section C.01.004 (1) (c) (ii)).\n\nAn appropriate designation for a lot number should be shown on all submitted draft labels to clearly indicate the manufacturer's/sponsor's intent to add the lot number to the label at the time of packaging (e.g., filling).\n\n3.5.3 Expiration Date\n\nThe expiration date must be on the inner and outer labels of all drug products (section C.01.004. (1)(c)(v)). The Regulations currently do not specify a particular wording or expression for expiry date. However, some acceptable terms include \"Expiration\" or \"Expiration date\" in English, and \"Expiration\" or \"Date d'expiration\" in French. The term \"Expiration\" or its abbreviation \"EXP.\" is acceptable as a bilingual expression.\n\nThe expiration date should be expressed in full or in any manner that the general public or end user will clearly understand. To provide consistency, the use of the pattern: year, month and day established in the foods section of the Food and Drug Regulations is suggested. Acceptable abbreviations are the last two digits of the year (under the circumstances identified below), two letters for the month, and two digits for the actual day of the month, if required.\n\nThe following patterns to express the expiry date are optional; however, Health Canada recommends this format in drug product labelling:\n\nIf the expiry date includes the year and month, the four digits of the year and two letters of the month (e.g., 2009 AL) or the two digit year and two letters of the month (e.g.,09AL) should appear on the label, with the last day of the month assumed.\n\nIf the expiry date includes the year, month and day, the four digits of the year, the two letters of the month and the two digits of the actual day of the month (e.g., 2009AL30) or the four digits of the year, the full month written out, and the two digits of the actual day (e.g., 2009 April 30) should appear on the label.\n\nAs provided in section B.01.007of the Regulations, the following two-letter abbreviations for the months are acceptable in both official languages: JA, FE, MR, AL, MA, JN, JL, AU, SE, OC, NO, DE.\n\nAn appropriate designation for an expiration date should be shown on all submitted draft labels to clearly indicate the sponsor's intent to add the expiration date to the label at the time of packaging (e.g., filling).\n\n3.5.4 Adequate Directions for Use\n\nSection C.01.004. (1) (c) (iii) of the Regulations requires that that the inner and outer labels show \"adequate directions for use of the drug product.\"This is interpreted to include:\n\nindications for use or pharmacological classification;\n\nrecommended single and daily dose;\n\nroute of administration, when the route is not obvious;\n\nany warning or cautions specifically required by the Regulation; and\n\nstorage conditions.\n\nMore detailed information that may be necessary for the proper use of the drug product by the consumer, but for which there is no room on the label, must be provided in some additional labelling such as a consumer information document.\n\nFor a prescription drug product, this consumer information may be a package insert or a document provided to the patient at the point of dispensing. The manufacturer/sponsor generated label should include a statement regarding the availability of this document, such as, \"See consumer information [leaflet]\" or \"Pharmacist (or DoctorFootnote 8): Dispense with consumer information [leaflet].\"\n\nFor a non-prescription drug product, the consumer information should be provided as a package insert. The inner and outer labels should include an instruction to consult the package insert for further directions, such as, \"See consumer information [leaflet].\"\n\nFor a new drug, subject to the requirements of Part C, Division 8, of the Regulations, the inner and outer labels should include a statement regarding the availability of the Product Monograph, such as, \"Product Monograph available on request.\"\n\nFor prescription drug products that are not considered new drugs subject to Part C, Division 8 of the Regulations, the label should include a statement regarding the availability of the prescribing information, such as \"Prescribing Information available on request\" (see section 5.4.5) or \"See package insert\" where such a document exists. This is especially important when there is not enough space on the label for more detailed drug information that may be required by the healthcare professional for the safe and effective use of the drug product.\n\nFor any prescription drug product where substantial product preparation may be required by the healthcare professional before dispensing (e.g., reconstituting parenterals), sponsors/manufacturers should consider including the prescribing information as a package insert. In this case the label should include a statement such as, \"See package insert\" (refer to section 5.4.2 of this guidance).\n\nFor labels showing a claim, indication or reference for a Schedule A disease, see section 2.7 of this guidance.\n\nHealth Canada recommends that positive statements should be used on labels to avoid ambiguity, wherever possible. For example, \"For subcutaneous use only\" is preferred over a negative statement such as \"Not for intravenous use.\" However, it is recognized that some negative statements in warnings are very effective and will continue to be used (e.g., \"Do not take Drug Product B while taking Drug Product A\").\n\n3.5.4.1 Storage Conditions\n\nStorage conditions are considered to be part of adequate directions for use, where applicable, and must be shown on the inner and outer labels (section C.01.004. (1) (c) (iii)). Guidance on appropriate storage conditions assists patients, consumers and healthcare professionals in maintaining product quality and safety.\n\n3.5.4.2 Limit Dose Drug Products\n\nFor drug products that carry a recommended single or daily dose or statement of concentration above the limits provided by section C.01.021 of the Regulations, the inner and outer labels must state that the product is to be used only on the advice of a physician (section C.01.025).\n\n3.5.4.3 Warnings and Precautions\n\nThe Regulations require several cautionary statements, such as those for acetylsalicylic acid and salicylic acid. Cautions shown within quotation marks in the Regulations must be printed verbatim. If the caution or warning does not appear within quotation marks, the wording may be altered but the meaning must be retained. Additional warnings and cautions outside the Regulations and specific to the drug product or drug product class may also be required on labels to help ensure safe use of the drug product.\n\n3.5.5 Declaration of Medicinal Ingredients\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in the Regulations, pursuant to section C.01.004(1)(c)(iv), the quantities of all medicinal ingredients must normally be declaredFootnote 9 on the inner and outer labels with the ingredients listed by their proper names or, if there are no proper names, by their common names. The standards of each individual ingredient should not be declared on the main panel of the label of a multi-ingredient drug product as it misleadingly implies a pharmaceutical standard for the combination. However, when a standard exists for the entire combination, then this standard must normallyFootnote 10 be declared on the main panel of the label.\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in the Regulations, the method of declaring the quantities of active ingredients should be as described in the following table.\n\nTable 3.1: Method of Declaring Quantities of Active Ingredients Pharmaceutical Form Appropriate Declaration Tablets, capsules, suppositories and other discrete dosage forms gram (g) or milligram (mg) per dosage form Powders for oral use gram (g) or milligram (mg) per gram, and per specific dosage unit (for example, level teaspoonful) Liquids for parenteral useFootnote 11 milligram (mg) per millilitre (ml), or % weight per volume (w/v) Liquids for oral use gram (g) or milligram (mg) per dosage unit, or per millilitre (ml) Creams, lotions, ointments milligram (mg) per gram (g)(= mg/g or % w/w), or milligram per millilitre (= mg/ml or %w/v)\n\nLeading and Terminal zeroes\n\nThe use of terminal (trailing) zeroes following a quantitative declaration of the medicinal ingredient should be avoided. Use 2 g rather than 2.0 g and 2.5 g instead of 2.50 g to avoid confusion.\n\nWhen a quantitative amount is expressed as a decimal number less than 1, then the declaration should be preceded by a leading zero, such as 0.5 mg.\n\n3.5.5.1 Non-parenteral Products Requiring Dilution\n\nFor non-parenteral drug products that must be diluted prior to use (e.g., powders for reconstitution), the inner and outer label should indicate the:\n\nquantity of medicinal ingredients per container;\n\nfinal concentration after reconstitution (e.g., mg per millilitre [mL]); and\n\nidentity of the diluent and the quantity to be added for reconstitution.\n\nWhere percentages are used, they should be specified as % w/w, w/v, or v/v, as applicable.\n\n3.5.5.2 Single Ingredient Preparations\n\nWhen a drug product contains a single medicinal ingredient, a declaration of the quantity of medicinal ingredient immediately following or preceding the proper or common name of the drug product is acceptable, provided that the amount refers to the medicinal ingredient in the form mentioned in the name. Examples: Acetylsalicylic Acid Tablets 300 mg or Hydrocortisone Acetate Ointment 1% w/w. In the second example, the product is understood to contain 1% w/w Hydrocortisone Acetate and not 1% w/w Hydrocortisone.\n\nThe declaration of the medicinal ingredient should reflect how the strength of the drug product is expressed. For example, if the proper name of the drug product is Chloramphenicol Palmitate Oral Suspension and the strength is expressed in terms of milligrams per millilitre of the chloramphenicol, then an acceptable quantitative declaration of the medicinal ingredient would be \"Chloramphenicol 30 mg/mL as Chloramphenicol palmitate\".\n\n3.5.5.3 Combination Immediate Release/ Modified Release Ingredients\n\nA combination drug product may contain an immediate release medicinal ingredient along with modified-release medicinal ingredient in the same pharmaceutical form (e.g., tablet). In these instances, the dosage form should be clearly labelled to reflect the combination.\n\n3.5.5.4 Transdermal Patches\n\nThe inner and outer labels (e.g., pouch and carton) of transdermal patches should include a declaration of the total quantity of the medicinal ingredients per patch, the mean dose delivered per unit of time (e.g., X mg/day, X mg/hour), and the duration of patch use (e.g., Y hours, Y days).\n\nTo ensure the proper identification of these drug patches, especially to inform healthcare personnel in cases of inadvertent contact with these discarded patches by children and pets, the patch itself should be labelled with the following minimum information:\n\nBrand name;\n\nCommon or proper name;\n\nQuantitative declaration of the medicinal ingredients;\n\nDIN; and,\n\nDelivery rate of the drug (e.g., X mg/hour).\n\n3.5.5.5 Implants\n\nLabelling for implants (e.g., wafers, capsules, and pellets), should include the total quantitative declaration of the medicinal ingredients per implant, the mean dose delivered per unit of time (e.g., X mg/day), and the duration of use (e.g., Y days).\n\n3.5.6 Declaration of Non-medicinal Ingredients\n\nAmendments to the Food and Drug Regulations, effective May 13, 2012, modify section C.01.004 of the Regulations, to state:\n\n(1.1) \"...when a drug is intended for human use, its outer label must contain a list of all nonmedicinal ingredients, or, if the outer label is too small, the list must appear on a tag, tape or card that is attached to the package.\"\n\n(1.2) \"The nonmedicinal ingredients must be listed in alphabetical order or in descending order of predominance by their proportion in the drug, preceded by words that clearly distinguish them from the medicinal ingredients.\"\n\n(1.4) When the composition of the drug varies from one lot to another, the outer label must include a reference to all non-medicinal ingredient alternatives that may be present in the drug, preceded by the symbol \"+/-\" or \"±\" or the expression \"or/ou\" or \"may contain/peut contenir.\"\n\nThe above is intended to apply to non-prescription drug products and does not apply to:\n\nprescription drug products;\n\ndrug products not required to be sold pursuant to a prescription but are administered under the supervision of a healthcare professional; or\n\nveterinary drug products and hard-surface disinfectants, both of which are outside the scope of this label guidance.\n\nA complete listing of all nonmedicinal ingredients on the label of a non-prescription drug product increases patient safety and better informs the consumer and healthcare professional in deciding the most appropriate drug product for each patient.\n\nThe non-medicinal or inactive ingredients should be clearly separated from the medicinal ingredients with a heading such as \"nonmedicinal (inactive) ingredients\". These nonmedicinal ingredients should be identified by the common or proper name.\n\nNonmedicinal ingredients should be generally excluded from the drug product name. Exceptions can be made with respect to flavour, colour, fragrance or non-therapeutic purposes provided this purpose is specified in the brand, or product name. A nonmedicinal ingredient which forms part of the brand name should be clearly identified with the cosmetic, non-therapeutic purpose within the brand name (e.g., Sunscreen X with moisturizing aloe) unless the non-therapeutic benefit is obvious (e.g., Antiseptic Raspberry Mouthwash [raspberry flavour]).\n\nWhere a manufacturer/sponsor of a prescription drug product chooses to list nonmedicinal ingredients on the label (optional), then the non-medicinal ingredients should be similarly and clearly identified by the common or proper name and identified as nonmedicinal or inactive ingredients.\n\n3.5.6.1 Different Flavours, Colours, or Fragrances\n\nA single DIN is assigned for drug products varying in flavour, colour, or fragrance, provided that all other product characteristics including: formulation, route, dosage form, product name, manufacturer's/sponsor's name, and labelling are identical. Refer to the Health Canada policy document, Drug Identification Number: A Brand Name Product with Different Fragrances, Flavours or Colours, for more information. For details concerning flavours, fragrances, and variable formulations, refer to the new regulations regarding nonmedicinal ingredients (see Appendix B).\n\n3.5.6.2 Colouring Agents\n\nThe use of colouring agents in drugs is restricted to those listed in section C.01.040 of the Regulations. If a manufacturer/sponsor wishes to use a new colouring agent not listed in section C.01.040, safety data for the new colouring agent must be submitted to Health Canada for review and approval before use. Only the names listed in the Regulations may be used (section C.01.040) in drug product labelling.\n\nNote that with regulatory changes discussed in section 3.5.6, manufacturers/sponsors must declare all colouring agents on the labels of non-prescription drug products effective May 13, 2012. (See Appendix B).\n\n3.5.6.3 Nomenclature for Non-medicinal Ingredients\n\nHealth Canada's policy Non-medicinal Ingredients Nomenclature outlines the accepted nomenclature used in naming the non-medicinal ingredients in drug product formulations. The list is not all-inclusive and does not imply acceptability for use in the labelling of all drug products; therefore, it should be used as a guide only.\n\n3.5.7 Net Amount (Net Contents)\n\nNet contents must be declared on the outer label as outlined in section C.01.004 (2) (a) of the Regulations. In some cases, however, it may be desirable to have this information on the inner label also. Manufacturers/sponsors should consider whether repeating the information would be useful in administration of the drug product. Standard units of measure and abbreviations (e.g., ounces, oz.), may also be included on the label in addition to the required metric units.\n\n3.5.8 Preservatives\n\nFor drug product lines containing ophthalmic or parenteral drug product formulations, and where two products differ only in the presence or absence of a preservative, the label should clearly identify the presence or absence of a preservative, either by reference in the brand name or directly and prominently on the label. Health Canada will issue two separate DINs to emphasize the difference in drug product identity.\n\n3.6 Special Packaging\n\nThe following subsections provide labelling requirements for special types of packaging.\n\n3.6.1 Co-packaged Products\n\nCo-packaged products containing two different drug products, or a drug and a non-drug item (e.g., cosmetic and device) must comply with the regulatory requirements for each product. As the co-packaging of certain drugs products may imply certain unapproved claims, pose a safety concern, or require the filing of a New Drug Submission (NDS), manufacturers/sponsors should consult with Health Canada prior to marketing co-packaged products.\n\nThe labelling of co-packaged drug products must include only those claims and indications that have been authorized for the individual drugs. If claims for the drug product exceed the authorized claims for the components, or new claims are made on the concomitant administration of the drug and non-drug product, then the manufacturer/sponsor must file a drug submission for the new combined use.\n\nWith respect to filing these drug submissions, manufacturers/sponsors may wish to consult the various Health Canada documents mentioned in Appendix B, such as:\n\n(a) For Division 8 drugs (i.e. New Drugs): Guidance for Industry: Post Notice of Compliance (NOC) Changes; or\n\n(b) For Division 1 drugFootnote 12: Guidance for Industry: Post Drug Identification Number (DIN) Changes.\n\n3.6.2 Labelling of Drug Products in Small Containers\n\nThe labelling requirements for drug products generally apply to all container sizes. However, some containers are too small to show all the information required by the Act and Regulations. Section C.01.004 (3) of the Regulations addresses this issue as follows:\n\nWhere the container of a drug is too small to accommodate an inner label that conforms to the requirements of these Regulations, the inner label requirements of these Regulations do not apply to the drug in that container if:\n\n(a) there is an outer label that complies with the labelling requirements of these Regulations; and\n\n(b) the inner label shows\n\n(i) the proper name of the drug, the common name of the drug if there is no proper name or, in the case of a drug with more than one medicinal ingredient, the brand name of the drug,\n\n(ii) the potency of the drug except where, in the case of a drug with more than one medicinal ingredient, the name used pursuant to section (i) for that drug is unique for a particular potency of the drug,\n\n(iii) the net content of the drug if it is not in a discrete dosage form,\n\n(iv) the route of administration of the drug if other than oral,\n\n(v) the lot number of the drug,\n\n(vi) the name of the manufacturer/sponsor of the drug,\n\n(vii) the expiration date of the drug, and\n\n(viii) the identification of special characteristics of the dosage form if they are not evident from the name of the drug under sections (i) or (ii).\n\n3.6.3 Labelling of Special Containers\n\nDrug products may be packaged in special containers that are too small to accommodate an inner label that conforms to the requirements of subsection C.01.004 (3) of the Regulations. This inner label may contain further abbreviated labelling, provided there is an outer label that meets all regulatory requirements.\n\nThe two types of packages are:\n\nMultiple-dose packs, such as: blister packs, strips, push-through cards, ampoules, or vials attached by a plastic strip; and\n\nSingle-dose packs, such as: sachets, pouch-type packs, individual dose vials of liquid or pre-packaged syringes.\n\nThese packages should contain the information listed in Subsections A and B below, and as outlined in the Health Canada policy document, Labelling of Special Containers. Consideration should be given to the colour of the text and the use of non-reflective or coloured foils that may enhance the legibility of the text for these special containers.\n\nA. Multi-dose Containers\n\nLabels for multiple-dose packs should include, at a minimum, the following information:\n\nBrand name or if no brand name, then the proper or common name plus the manufacturer's/sponsor's name;\n\nPotency of the drug except where, in the case of a drug with more than one medicinal ingredient, the name used is unique for a particular potency of the drug; and\n\nLot number and expiry date.\n\nThe above information should be presented in a way that ensures that the package information is maintained and can be read after units have been removed. This can be achieved by printing in a repetitive manner or by embossing on the edge of each card.\n\nB. Single Dose Containers\n\nLabels for single-dose packs should include the same information as labels for multiple-dose packs (See A), but if there is insufficient space, the expiry date may be omitted.\n\nFor drug products containing multi-ingredients (e.g., cold product with four ingredients) where the blister package label may not accommodate the quantitative amount of each ingredient as required by the Regulations, the use of a brand name unique for a particular potency is acceptable. If a brand name is not unique for a particular potency, it is acceptable to have the brand name and the DIN appear on the blister package label (e.g., Cough/Cold Tablet, DIN 12345678), which clearly identifies the drug product.\n\nAlthough a DIN is not required on the labels of small containers described in this section 3.6.3, it is still highly recommended as an added safety precaution if space is available.\n\n3.6.4 Security Packaging\n\nPursuant to section A.01.065 of the Regulations, drug products intended for ingestion, inhalation, or insertion into the human body, mouthwashes, or drug products intended for ophthalmic use, must be contained in a security package if the drug product is available to the general public in an open selection area. The labels on these products must draw attention to the security feature of the package. For further information, refer to the Regulations, section G.02.019 (c) for controlled drugs and section J.01.030 for restricted drugs.\n\n3.6.5 Drugs in Pressurized Containers and Flammability\n\nDrug products packaged in a disposable metal container designed to release pressurized contents by the use of a manually operated valve must show the cautionary statements, hazard symbols, and signal words as outlined in sections A.01.061 to A.01.063 of the Regulations.\n\nDrug products packaged in unpressurized containers operated by a manual pump spray device or any other containers that contain flammable ingredients should show a cautionary warning indicating flammable contents and appropriate directions for use (e.g., \"Do not use near an open flame\").\n\n3.7 Technical Information and Language\n\nTechnical information should be presented in terminology that is easily understood by the consumer. The amount of information provided should not exceed that required to arrive at a proper conclusion. Technical information is more likely to mislead or deceive the consumer in controversial areas where scientific opinions diverge. Technical or complicated language should not be used to purposely obscure, disguise, or exaggerate drug product benefits.\n\nWith the new requirement to include a Part III, Consumer Information document for all new drugs in the new Product Monograph format (see the Guidance for Industry: Product Monograph), there is an increase in technical information that has to be explained to consumers. A balance is required between exposure to sufficient information for safe, effective, and informed use of a medication versus too much information, which could overwhelm the consumer. For some prescription drug products there is no accurate consumer language to describe some conditions; therefore, the original technical language must be maintained, while attempting to explain the condition in a way the consumer would understand.\n\nTechnical information, when required, should be written:\n\nin language at no greater than a Grade 8 reading level;\n\nin simple, clear, and easy to understand language; and\n\npresented with numerous headings and bulleted points.\n\nManufacturers/sponsors may wish to refer to the Canadian Public Health Association's guidance, Good Medicine for Seniors: Guidelines for Plain Language and Good Design in Prescription Medication on plain language for drug labelling (see Appendix C).\n\n3.8 Labelling of Professional Samples\n\nSubsection 14(1) of the Act prohibits the distribution of any drug as a sample, which is considered to be a package of a drug provided at no cost. However, subsection 14(2) allows the \"distribution, under prescribed conditions, of a sample to physicians, dentists, veterinary surgeons, or pharmacists.\" The conditions that must be met are provided in sections C.01.048 and C.01.049 of the Regulations.\n\nA sample of a drug product given to a healthcare professional and intended for subsequent distribution to a patient, must be labelled with the same directions required for the safe and effective use as for regular package sizes of prescription and non-prescription drug products. All labelling that is normally distributed with the regular package sizes should be distributed with samples, including the consumer information document for all new drugs in the new Product Monograph format.\n\nIt is understood that the labelling detail required for a non-prescription drug product may be greater than that required for a prescription drug. Refer to the Health Canada policy document Labelling of Professional Samples of Drugs.\n\n3.9 Including International Information on Drug Package Labels\n\nPackage labels (inner and outer) for drug products authorized for sale in Canada may include additional regulatory information approved by other regulatory jurisdictions (e.g., NDC number) provided that the label:\n\nmeets Canadian regulatory requirements;\n\nis consistent with applicable Health Canada guidance documents and policies;\n\ndoes not cause confusion and;\n\nis consistent with the terms of market authorization for the drug product ( e.g. a prescription symbol required in another country should not appear on the Canadian label of a product which is non-prescription in Canada).\n\n4. Claims and Text Content\n\nSubsection 9(1) of the Act prohibits the representation of a drug \"in a manner that is false, misleading or deceptive or is likely to create an erroneous impression regarding its character, value, quantity, composition, merit or safety.\" Drug manufacturers/sponsors can ensure drug product labelling complies with the Act by providing accurate and concise information to assist healthcare professionals in choosing the correct medication for patients, and consumers in identifying the availability and effects of therapeutic agents for self-medication.\n\nDrug products, due to their potential risk, should be labelled in an informative manner. It is the manufacturer's/sponsor's responsibility to periodically update product labels to be consistent with current scientific information and medical treatment.\n\n4.1 Misrepresentation of Classification\n\nLabelling should clearly indicate that the product is a drug. Sponsors should avoid describing the drug product, its purpose, or method of use in a way that implies it is another product type, such as a food or cosmetic. Misrepresentation of classification can create an erroneous impression regarding the character, merit, and safety of a preparation (e.g., medicated versus cosmetic shampoo).\n\n4.2 Absence of Ingredients\n\nConsumers and patients may be concerned about the health implications of certain medicinal and non-medicinal ingredients in drug product formulations (e.g., sugars, salts, sulfites). Manufacturers/sponsors may selectively refer to the absence of certain ingredients under particular conditions (e.g., no ingredient X, no X, non-X, X-free).\n\nWhen an ingredient has been removed from drug products in Canada because of safety concerns, it is acceptable to include a statement to the effect that a drug has been reformulated to omit that ingredient or that the drug product does not contain that ingredient. Such statements are considered acceptable for a limited time (e.g., one year), but after a certain period they lose meaning as the unacceptable ingredient is no longer found in other products.\n\nFor example, phenylpropanolamine as a non-prescription oral decongestant has been removed from drug products in Canada because of safety concerns. As phenylpropanolamine is no longer found in any over-the-counter oral decongestant, a \"PPA-free\" claim is no longer relevant or acceptable as a claim for this drug product class.\n\nBecause such statements are intended to reinforce consumer acceptance of drug products, such statements would be acceptable for preparations that previously contained the subject ingredient and that belong to that class of products in which the subject ingredient could be expected. For further guidance, refer to the Health Canada policy document, Absence of Ingredient Statements for Non-prescription Drugs.\n\n4.2.1 Sugar-free, Sucrose-free, Sweetener-free\n\nLabel statements such as \"sugar-free\" are acceptable only for those drug products that do not contain any of the chemical classes of sugar, including sugar alcohols. If the label bears a \"sugar free\" claim or equivalent, and if a sweetening agent or agents are present, then the drug product label should include a phrase such as \"sugar-free- sweetened with agent X (or Agents X, Y, Z..... including sugar alcohols).\" This accompanying statement will reduce the risk of misleading consumers.\n\nHealth Canada suggests that drug product labels claiming one of the sugar alcohols specify the number of energy calories provided per dose.\n\nClaims such as sweetener-free, artificial sweetener-free, and artificial sweetener X-free may be acceptable if true. However, claims for the absence of a particular artificial sweetener (e.g., \"aspartame-free\") may be misleading if it is not revealed to the consumer that the drug product may contain another artificial sweetener (e.g., acesulfame potassium). In these situations, the declared absence of one sweetener should be accompanied by the equally prominent declaration of the actual sweetener used.\n\n4.2.2 Salt and Sodium-free\n\nDrug products without sodium chloride may be labelled as \"salt-free,\" while those without sodium may be labelled as \"no sodium.\" The expressions \"low salt,\" \"low sodium,\" \"suitable for low sodium diets,\" or \"suitable for restricted sodium diets\" are acceptable if the daily amount of sodium provided by the drug product is 25 mg or less.\n\n4.3 Absence of Side Effects\n\nSome consumers wish to avoid some specific side effects that can occur with some non-prescription drug products, but not others within the same product class (e.g., some antihistamines have a likely somnolent side effect while others are non-drowsy). Statements regarding the absence of a side effect are permitted provided the following conditions are met:\n\nScientific evidence exists to support the statement, such that the incidence of a side effect is comparable to when a placebo is taken. Scientific evidence to support the statement should be available to the manufacturer/sponsor and submitted to the Health Canada upon request. The evidence would consist of data from well-designed clinical trials, including sufficient sample sizes and adequate control groups, such that a significance level of 0.05 is attained and the study meets the 80 to 90% power test for excluding Type I and Type II errors. The substantiating data should include results derived from measurable, objective parameters, where feasible. If the incidence of a particular side effect exceeds that for the placebo, the statement regarding the absence of side effects should not be used.\n\nThere is a widely held consumer perception that the significant side effect is associated with comparable drug products of that class. For example, drowsiness is a side effect perceived to be frequently associated with the use of non-prescription cough and cold products. A claim indicating the absence of this side effect for a drug product within this product class, would be acceptable provided all other conditions are met.\n\nThe claim regarding the absence of a side effect provides practical consumer information so that consumers can readily identify the side effect or benefit.\n\nStatements about the presence of significant adverse effects are accorded equal prominence in the labelling material to statements about the absence of side effect. The colour, contrast, position, and spacing of the information should be considered when assessing the requirement for equal prominence.\n\nNo undue emphasis on the statement about the absence of side effects is presented in labels or advertising.\n\nStatements regarding the absence of side effects should be submitted via the Post-NOC Changes process for new drugs and via the Post Drug Identification Number (DIN) Changes process for drugs that are Division 1 drugsFootnote 13. Health Canada recommends that prior approval be obtained concerning the use of these statements for all drug products.\n\nIt is the manufacturer's/sponsor's responsibility to ensure that all such claims remains valid. If any of the scientific information changes then these claims should be removed.\n\n4.4 Side Effects and Placebo Comparisons\n\nComparisons of the incidence of side effects on labels between the drug product and placebo are often misleading and should be avoided. For example:\n\nIn clinical studies, frequent side effects observed more often with Ingredient X than the placebo (sugar pill), were headache and diarrhea. Other side effects observed about as often on Ingredient X as on the sugar pill, included abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, dizziness, back pain, and influenza-like symptoms.\n\nThis text requires an ability to evaluate two different comparisons and assess their significance, which may be difficult for some consumers. The message should be as simple and straightforward as possible, limited to the side effects that are reasonable to expect. More appropriate wording would be, \"Frequent side effects were headache and diarrhea.\" Manufacturers/sponsors may also choose to include the other side effects, without citing the comparison with the placebo.\n\n4.5 Look-alike, Sound-alike Drug Product Names\n\nFor prescription products and those administered or obtained through a health professional, as of June 13, 2015 there are new regulatory requirements under C.01.014.1(2)(o) and C.08.002(2)(o) for submissions regarding product names. These requirements specify the need for an assessment as to whether there is a likelihood that the drug will be mistaken for any of the following products due to a resemblance between the brand name that is proposed to be used in respect of the drug and the brand name, common name or proper name of any of those products:\n\na drug in respect of which a drug identification number has been assigned,\n\na radiopharmaceutical, as defined in section C.03.201, in respect of which a notice of compliance has been issued under section C.08.004 or C.08.004.01, and\n\na kit, as defined in section C.03.205, in respect of which a notice of compliance has been issued under section C.08.004 or C.08.004.01.\n\nLook-alike, sound-alike (LA/SA) refers to names of different health products that have orthographic similarities when written or similar phonetics when spoken. These similarities may pose a health risk by causing confusion in the prescribing, dispensing, administration of a drug product, or in the selection of a non-prescription drug product by the consumer. It is the manufacturer's/sponsor's responsibility to ensure that any proposed brand name will not cause potential confusion with another brand name, common or proper name. The manufacturer/sponsor should perform an analysis and risk assessment for any proposed product name to support its use.\n\nFor prescription products and those administered or obtained through a health professional, please refer to: Guidance for Industry: Review of Drug Brand Names and the Frequently Asked Questions - Guidance Document for Industry - Review of Drug Brand Names.\n\n4.6 Comparisons\n\nManufacturers/sponsors are encouraged to promote drug products on their own merits in a positive manner instead of by comparison with other products. Comparisons with other drug products or with the selected properties of other drugs are potentially misleading. The consumer, while competent to evaluate comparisons of taste, flavour, colour, and appearance, generally lacks the expertise and access to the supporting data required to evaluate the implications of comparisons about the therapeutic properties of drug products. Manufacturers/sponsors should exercise caution when presenting comparative statements to the public to avoid being in contravention of subsection 9(1) of the Act.\n\nComparisons may be misleading for several reasons:\n\nComparisons are generally incomplete. Usually, only the advantages of the advertised drug product and the disadvantages of the competitive product are mentioned. Special benefits or advantages of the competitive product are generally omitted.\n\nComparisons exaggerate the importance of the alleged advantages of the drug product (e.g., speed of action, quantity of medicinal ingredient, or extent or duration of action). Failure to disclose the lack of real therapeutic advantage is often deceptive.\n\nDifferences of opinion between experts regarding the truth and impact of the compared qualities are often undisclosed.\n\n4.6.1 Implied Comparisons\n\nSome terms and phrases used to describe the composition of drug products imply comparisons that convey an erroneous impression regarding a product's value and merit. The terms \"better,\" \"richer,\" and \"stronger\" indicates an unidentified comparison which may be misleading and implies product superiority when this may not be the case. Where a drug product has been reformulated to be significantly more effective or to provide an additional therapeutic advantage over a previous formulation, the use of \"better\" may be acceptable, if carefully explained. However, it should be clearly indicated that the drug products being compared are the old and new formulations. To avoid violating subsection 9(1) of the Act, sponsors should describe such a product as a \"new\" or \"improved\" formulation. The use of such terms to describe novel or modified products is acceptable for one year.\n\n4.6.2 Therapeutic Comparative Claims\n\nTherapeutic claims are those related only to the therapeutic aspects of the drug product (e.g., therapeutic actions, efficacy, speed of action, symptom relief). For manufacturers/sponsors wishing to consider labelling or advertising that includes therapeuticcomparisons to other drug products for human use, Health Canada's Therapeutic Comparative Advertising: Directive and Guidance Document provides:\n\nbroad principles applicable to all drug products for human use regardless of the intended audience (healthcare professionals or consumers);\n\ndetailed data requirements necessary to support consumer-directed non-prescription drug product advertising and labelling;\n\nroles and responsibilities of Health Canada and the sponsor concerning labelling; and\n\nroles and responsibilities of Health Canada, the sponsor, and the independent advertising preclearance agency concerning advertising.\n\nThe purpose of Therapeutic Comparative Advertising: Directive and Guidance Document is to provide a framework for supporting evidence and presentation of comparative therapeutic claims in labelling and advertising, to ensure these claims are not false, misleading, or deceptive to the intended user.\n\nManufacturers/sponsors wishing to add therapeutic comparisons to labelling, which is generally discouraged if the overall effect is considered promotional, should seek pre-approval of the label claims through the submission and approval of an appropriate change to labelling. Refer to the Health Canada's Guidance for Industry: Post-Notice of Compliance (NOC) Changes or Post Drug Identification Number (DIN) Changes documents in Appendix B.\n\n4.6.3 Non-therapeutic Comparisons\n\nThe Therapeutic Products Directorate (TPD) is not responsible for the review of the comparative, non-therapeutic qualities claimed for drug products in labelling (e.g., taste, fragrance, colour, physical, sensory, cosmetic benefit, market share, cost effectiveness etc.) provided these claims do not conflict with the therapeutic understanding of the product.\n\nThe purpose of the existing Health Canada policy, Principles for Claims Relating to Comparison of Non-therapeutic Aspects of Non-prescription Drug Products, is to define the conditions under which such comparisons will not be considered false, misleading, or deceptive as to the therapeutic character, value, quantity, composition, merit, or safety of the drug product to the intended audience. This measure is to aid sponsors and the industry to create labelling and advertising in compliance with the Act and Regulations, particularly subsection 9(1) of the Act.\n\nThe sponsor is responsible for ensuring that the applicable non-therapeutic, comparative claims meet the requirements of Health Canada's policy. Health Canada does not accept complaints concerning overall impression of comparative, non-therapeutic claims unless these claims interfere with the therapeutic aspects of the drug product. Advertising complaints concerning these non-therapeutic comparative claims can be forwarded to the sponsor, the courts (for complaints brought under the Competition Act) or may be considered by industry or voluntary pre-clearance agencies.\n\n4.6.4 High, Low\n\nThe terms \"high\" and \"low\" generally imply unidentified comparisons and standards against which a drug product must be measured. For most product classes, these standards do not exist; therefore, these terms are unacceptable. To avoid misleading the consumer regarding the benefits of a product, more specific terminology should be used.\n\nIn some specific drug product areas, such as sunscreens, where a measurable standard of comparative performance is available (e.g., SPF, sun protection factor), these terms may be accepted in a product line to assist the consumer in product choice, in addition to the principle measure of effectiveness, the SPF, which is outlined in the appropriate Health Canada labelling standards and monographs (see Section 5.2.1).\n\n4.7 Endorsements, Testimonials, and Quotations\n\nThe following subsections provide guidance for the use of endorsements, testimonials, and quotations from the media or medical literature.\n\n4.7.1 Endorsements, Seals of Approval\n\nEndorsements of drug products (e.g., \"doctor recommended\") by healthcare professionals, celebrities, and others are acceptable in labelling provided the endorsements are consistent with the expected actions and terms of market authorization and supporting data is available (where necessary), and there is no violation of the Act and Regulations. The endorsements should also be consistent with related Health Canada guidance documents and policies.\n\nSeals of approval on the labelling of certain drug products issued by independent professional bodies (e.g., Canadian Dental Association) may be acceptable if the written material explaining the exact nature of the endorsement has been provided to TPD for review and the products in the product class meets the independent product recognition based on certain criteria. This recognition must be consistent with the terms of market authorization of the product. TPD will conduct only one evaluation to validate the criteria used by the attesting organization. It is the manufacturer's/sponsor's responsibility to ensure that they have documentation on file that shows the drug product has obtained the endorsement from this third party organization and that the drug product continues to meet the attesting organization's criteria. Product-specific data showing that a product meets this seal of approval is not expected with a drug product submission submitted for review but must be available on request.\n\n4.7.2 Testimonials\n\nTestimonials or quotations from individuals on drug product labels frequently constitute an unfair and biased advantage. There may be no acceptable way of indicating on the labelling how such cases compare with the frequency of failure or success of that treatment. It may be misleading to build unwarranted expectations in the consumer's mind by the use of success stories. However, if such testimonials are consistent with the expected benefits of the product and the terms of market authorization, they can be accepted following critical review, provided the testimonial does not otherwise violate the Act and Regulations.\n\n4.7.3 Quotations from Media, Journals, or Texts\n\nQuotations from scientific journals, papers, authoritative texts, magazines, newspapers, or any other media source may create an erroneous impression regarding the character, value, merit, or safety of a drug product. This material may not reflect the entire data package supporting the drug product and may represent the isolated opinion of the author or a biased selection of data; therefore, sponsors should avoid using quotations on drug labels.\n\n4.8 Cosmetic Claims\n\nCosmetic claims and any description of the cosmetic or non-therapeutic attributes of the drug product (fragrance, texture, colour) are acceptable for therapeutic products provided they:\n\ndo not directly or indirectly imply therapeutic activity;\n\nare not misleading as to therapeutic merit, identity, composition, and character of the drug product, or in violation of the Act and Regulations (e.g., prohibited substance); and\n\nhave evidence available to support the cosmetic claim.\n\nTPD will comment on any claim that the manufacturer/sponsor believes to be a \"cosmetic\" claim but is actually considered to be a direct or indirect therapeutic claim that may be misleading as to the merit of the drug product. TPD may consult Health Canada's National Capital Region Consumer Product Safety Bureau, Cosmetics Program concerning claims that may be difficult to classify as cosmetic versus therapeutic.\n\nManufacturers/sponsors are encouraged to consult the Guidelines for Cosmetic Advertising and Labelling Claims, available through Advertising Standards Canada (ASC), for guidance concerning acceptable cosmetic claims. Any cosmetic claim attributed to a specific ingredient (e.g., \"with moisturizing aloe vera\") must be supported by data on file and available to Health Canada upon request.\n\n4.8.1 Cooling\n\nThe term \"cooling\" may be used in a therapeutic sense, if the drug product contains a medicinal ingredient for a therapeutic purpose such as \"for cooling relief of sunburn\" (e.g., topical anaesthetic with menthol or camphor). The term may also be used in a non-therapeutic sense if adequately explained (e.g., antiseptic mouthwash with a cooling sensation flavour such as menthol).\n\n4.9 Conditionally Positive Promotional Terms\n\nThe following subsections describe positive promotional terms that may be used under certain conditions on drug product labels.\n\n4.9.1 Market Share and Consumer Preference\n\nClaims on drug product labels that include market share, sale, consumer and patient use/ choice, or preference must be supported by adequate studies conducted within the past year which should be kept on file by the manufacturer/sponsor. Although Health Canada does not review these label claims, where advertising disputes arise there are self-regulatory industry bodies that may deal with complaint resolution.\n\n4.9.2 Clinically Proven or Tested\n\nA. For a Product\n\nThe terms \"clinically proven\"or \"clinically tested\" can be used on drug product labelling provided:\n\nadequate clinical efficacyFootnote 14 data pertaining to the drug product has been reviewed and found acceptable by the Therapeutic Products Directorate; or\n\nit contains only one medicinal ingredient whose efficacy in a given dosage form and indication is well recognized and documented in the literature (e.g., Health Canada labelling standard or monograph for pharmaceutical drugs, or Category I ingredient- United States Federal Register).\n\nAn example would be dextromethorphan syrup in product X: \"Product X is a clinically proven cough relief\" or \"clinically proven\" would be acceptable on the label.\n\nB. For an Ingredient\n\n\"Clinically proven\" can be used on labelling for an ingredient when a drug product contains more than one medicinal ingredient, including one or more whose efficacy in a given dosage form and indication is well recognized and documented in the literature.\n\nAn example would be Product Y containing dextromethorphan and other ingredients that are not in any Health Canada labelling standard or monograph for pharmaceutical drugs, or in Category I, United States Federal Register. The statement \"Dextromethorphan provides a clinically proven cough relief\" would be acceptable, whereas, the statement \"Product Y is clinically proven\" would not be acceptable.\n\nAnother example would be a combination drug product containing only dextromethorphan and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, the benefits of both of which are documented in the literature: \"Product Y provides clinically proven cough/nasal congestion relief\" would be acceptable. The following statement would not be acceptable: \"Product Y is a clinically proven cold relief\" because the product is likely to alleviate only two cold symptoms, not the whole range of cold symptoms that may be present.\n\n4.9.3 New\n\nThe word \"new\" may be used to describe a drug product that is marketed under its present brand name for the first time in Canada, or in a different version of an existing preparation (e.g., a new pharmaceutical fo"
