        "text": "What Is Pharmaceutical Packaging?\n\nPharmaceutical packaging refers to the process, materials, designs, and systems that package, label, and distribute drugs in a variety of healthcare markets.\n\nWith such a highly regulated industry, healthcare organizations and pharmacies must use specific packaging that meets the requirements set by regulatory authorities in the United States, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nThese regulations along with recent trends and changes in the healthcare industry have led to increasing demand for safe, efficient, and sustainable packaging.\n\nManufacturers focus on meeting these demands by optimizing the packaging materials and equipment that play a part in the packaging process. Let’s take a closer look at the development of the industry, as well as the solutions pharmaceutical packaging manufacturers bring to the market.\n\nHow to Optimize the Packaging Process?\n\nOptimizing the packing process involves conducting market research, evaluating case studies, and taking other steps to provide cost-effective packaging methods that support improved patient safety.\n\nIn drug development, a pharmaceutical company’s regulatory affairs must approve products based on strict safety standards. In product development for pharmaceutical packaging, the process is similar. A packaging manufacturer must ensure that their product packaging meets each U.S. regulatory requirement.\n\nDrivers of Development in the Pharmaceutical Packaging Market\n\nTechnology advancements and continual optimization efforts result from a variety of wants, needs, and regulations within specific care markets. Let’s look at some of those key drivers of development in pharmaceutical packaging:\n\nCost Reduction: With the responsibility of allocating and managing such important resources, pharmaceutical executives will look to reduce costs wherever possible. Packaging companies are pressed to provide the most efficient equipment and materials that will increase the profitability of their customers.\n\nSafety and Sterility: The pharmaceutical market places a high level of importance on safety and sterility. This trickles down to the packaging process and has always been a key component in the industry. In recent years, regulations and standards have led many organizations to focus on utilizing safer, more efficient ways to package medications. These regulations are constantly changing and updating, making it important for pharmacies to use up-to-date methods.\n\nFlexibility and Capacity: Having more responsive production processes and delivery systems are necessary to meet unpredictable volumes and maintain efficient operations. The increasing demand for individualized medicine has created methods such as the unit dose supply to reduce any medication mistakes and save valuable time.\n\nNew Pharmaceutical Packaging Technology: With the introduction of AI and other tech advancements, healthcare packaging has responded with smart packaging. By using barcodes, radio frequency identification tracking chips, and responsive packaging medication safety and supply chain management are simplified.\n\nTypes of Drug Packaging\n\nPharmaceutical product packaging can be classified under three levels: Primary, secondary, and tertiary. The type of packaging and relevant stakeholders will depend on where in the distribution process you find a specific medication.\n\nPrimary Packaging\n\nThe main purpose of primary packaging is product protection and safety from external factors. This type of packaging must meet each U.S. regulatory requirement to protect the product from tampering or contamination to ensure that it can reach its shelf life instead of expiring at an earlier date. For example, primary packaging in North America includes child-resistant packaging for medications in bottles and other types of containers to prevent children from being able to open them.\n\nLabels play an important role in primary packaging. Various factors are considered for medication labels, and each label will differ in many ways including the type, dose, patient, etc. Efficiency and accuracy in the labeling process are vital.\n\nDifferent types of primary packaging include:\n\nBlister packs\n\nPrefilled syringes\n\nVials\n\nPlastic bottles\n\nBlister packaging is commonly used for capsules and tablets, while bottles, syringes, and vials are typically used for liquid medications. These types of packaging are designed to prevent medications from spoiling, harboring bacteria, or developing other problems that affect shelf life and usage.\n\nSecondary Packaging\n\nSecondary packaging refers to the product packaging that is used for storing or grouping multiple primary packages. This packaging will secure various components and/or units within a facility. Examples of secondary packaging include:\n\nBoxes\n\nCartons\n\nInjection trays\n\nShipping containers\n\nSecondary packaging can be used to keep primary packages organized and make it easier to store them. This type of packaging can also provide added product protection. A pharmaceutical company might use secondary packaging to group primary packages together before shipping them. Pharmacies and other facilities might store medications in secondary packaging until they are needed.\n\nTertiary Packaging\n\nTertiary packaging refers to the packaging that is used to ship products in bulk. This type of packaging is used for shipping and handling to facilities that store or distribute large quantities of medication. Different components of tertiary packaging that are used in the pharma industry include:\n\nLarge shipping containers\n\nBarrels\n\nEdge protectors and other packaging that helps cushion packages as needed\n\nMPI’s Packaging Solutions\n\nMPI has been providing top-quality primary and tertiary products since 1971, constantly innovating and growing with the pharmaceutical packaging market.
