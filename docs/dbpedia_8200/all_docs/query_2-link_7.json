        "text": "All consumer products must be labeled. The label contains the necessary information for the item to complete its journey through the supply chain; compulsory information according to international regulations and to the legislation of each country, depending on the productive sector to which it belongs. It can also contain the information that the manufacturer considers interesting to add.\n\nLabels can be grouped into four categories:\n\nWhat characteristics does a label have?\n\nThe possibilities of labeling, coding and marking commercial products are endless, in terms of design, formats, materials and procedures for printing.\n\nThe label is a fundamental element; therefore, choosing the printing solution is also a key point. It must adapt to the characteristics of each item and be easily integrable in the production line.\n\nFood product labeling\n\nAny packaged product intended for human consumption is regulated by strict hygiene and health regulations. The labeling must include detailed information on its characteristics, conservation and nutritional properties.\n\nThe mandatory information on all packaging must include:\n\nPharmaceutical labeling\n\nThe pharmaceutical products market is subject to exhaustive international regulations to guarantee its good use. In February 2019, the entry into force of the European Directive on counterfeit medicines added new obstacles to fraudulent trade through the mandatory incorporation of a unique Datamatrix code on packaging.\n\nIn the fight against counterfeiting, which pose a serious threat to public health, all actors in the supply chain participate, and must exchange information on each transaction.\n\nIt is obvious, therefore, the great importance of using a labeling system that provides the highest quality in coding and that guarantees traceability, meeting the high demands of the production lines of pharmaceutical articles.\n\nChemical labeling\n\nThe EU REACH Compliance, regarding the registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemical substances and preparations, requires manufacturers and importers to report on the physiochemical properties, and the effects on the environment and health, of their products.\n\nThe CLP Regulation, on classification, labeling and packaging of substances and mixtures, applies in the European Union the international criteria of the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemical Products (GHS).\n\nThe CLP Regulation also establishes the physical characteristics of the labels: their dimensions depending on the capacity of the container, and the disposition and size of each element.\n\nInternational GS1 standards\n\nUBS printing solutions\n\nAt UBS we have printing equipment to respond to the labeling, coding and marking needs of any production line. Our Thermal Inkjet TJX Series, with water based or UVLED ink, cover all possibilities in primary products.\n\nThermal Inkjet TJX Series\n\nTJX UVLED\n\nFor direct marking on the substrate of secondary products, we have the high-resolution inkjet printers APLINK MRX and APLINK LCX, with oil-based or UVLED inks, and the MRX Bicolor, which prints in two colors simultaneously and it is specially designed to comply with the requirements of the CLP Regulation. For printing and applying labels on boxes, the APL 35s offer the best performance.\n\nAPLINK MRX\n\nAPLINK LCX\n\nAPLINK MRX UVLED\n\nAPLINK MRX Bicolor\n\nAPL 35s\n\nFinally, our pallet label printing and application equipment, APL 38s, APL 8000 Series and APL 8000 ELV Series, are designed and manufactured to meet the highest demands at the end of the production line.\n\nAPL 38s\n\nAPL 8000 Series\n\nAPL 8000 ELV Series\n\nAmong the great advantages of UBS machines, is the ease of integration in any industrial environment. Plus, with our UBS Designer and UBS LabMan software, label design and system management are simple and intuitive."
