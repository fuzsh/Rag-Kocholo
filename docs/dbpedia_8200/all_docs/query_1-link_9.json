[1] • The main aim of the package inserts or leaflets is to provide information essential for the safe and effective use of the drugs, and hence reducing the number of adverse reactions resulting from medication errors. • In India, regulations for package insert are provided under 'Section 6.2' and 'Section 6.3' of 'Drugs and Cosmetics Act (1940) and Rules (1945). 1. Kalam A, Anwar S, Fatima A, “Drug Package Inserts In India: Current Scenario”, World Journal Of Pharmacy And Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mar 2014, 3(4), 385-392\n\n23. • Content of Packaging Insert [5]: Sec 6.2 Therapeutic Information Sec 6.3 Pharmaceutical Information Posology and method of administration  Contra-indications. Special warnings and special precautions for use, if any. Interaction with other medicaments and other forms of interaction. Pregnancy and lactation, if contra- indicated. Effects on ability to drive and use machines, if contra-indicated. Undesirable effects/side effects. Antidote for overdosing List of excipients Incompatibilities Shelf life in the medical product as packaged for sale. Shelf life after dilution or reconstitution according to direction. Shelf life after first opening the container. Special precautions for storage. Nature and specification of the container.\n\n24. [6] • Labeling machines are machines that dispense, apply or print- and-apply labels to various items, products, containers, or packages • Labeling equipment are various machines, including label printers, label applicators, printer-applicators, and labeling systems, that apply labels to various products and packages. Semi Automatic Labeling Machine Fully Automatic Labeling Machine\n\n25. • Types of Labeling machinery 1. Semi Automatic Labeling Machine 2. Fully Automatic Labeling Machine • Fully Automatic Single Side Sticker Labeling Machine • Fully Automatic Double Side (front & back) Sticker Labeling Machines • Fully Automatic High Speed Sticker Labeling Machine\n\n26. • Semi Automatic Labelling Machine are suitable for labelling on Round Vials, Bottles. • No change of parts is required for change in size of containers & labels suitable for Glass, Plastic, Composite Containers can be prepared. • Grooved and Brut Shaped Bottles can also be labeled. • The Semi Automatic Labelling Machine incorporates latest sophisticated. • Microprocessor Controlled Stepper Motor Drive, Fiber Optic Label and Container sensing system.\n\n27. • Fully Automatic Labelling machine is useful to place label accurately on round shape of product. • Full or partial wrap labeling can be possible. • A unique feature of machine is if the body diameters changes, than also machine operates without change in part. • Products of different diameter like small size of vials and bottles upto containers can be accommodated in the same machine & Speed is depend on the length of label.\n\n28. • Different types such as Alluminium, Glass, Plastic products can be accommodated on the machine. • Labeling speed is automatically synchronized with conveyor speed to ensure quality. • Push and press optional attachment is used to ensure smooth labeling without wrinkles or bubble.\n\n29. [7] [8] • Pharmaceutical labelling is more complex than ever, with increasing pressure from consumers and regulatory bodies to prevent counterfeiting and improve safety. Manufacturers and packaging companies need to ensure products can be recognized and verified quickly and easily throughout the supply chain, communicating vital information to retailers and distributors. • Today's drug manufacturers can choose from a wide selection of : – Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) technologies – Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags\n\n30. • For instance, using AIDC technologies, manufacturers can include product or batch specific data in individual product labels. In the pharma industry, this could enable suppliers and retailers to verify a product quickly and accurately — in most cases using standard technology. • RFID tags can be read without the need for close contact or a direct line of sight, and offer read/write functionality, which makes them ideal for tracking products and monitoring processes. However, relatively high cost and complexity of implementing the technology has prevented its progress in many areas, including the pharma industry.\n\n31. • 2D Barcodes:  2D barcodes can hold considerably more information than standard barcodes (usually up to approximately 1000 characters of information on a single label) making them better suited to meet the requirements of today's manufacturers.  This increased level of information can be held on a label the same size or smaller than a conventional barcode label, and the codes can, in most cases, be printed using the same technology, helping to minimize the cost of upgrading.  Furthermore, 2D barcodes can also function as a database themselves, providing a portable information source on the labelled product.\n\n32.
