        "text": "Packaging labelling and coding is essential in the pharmaceutical industry. Generally, this operation is carried out at the end of the production line. Thanks to labelling, products can be easily identified. Firms in the pharmaceutical industry can choose between different marking solutions: printing, labelling and laser marking.\n\nMain Marking Systems for Pharmaceutical Packaging\n\nThe marking of pharmaceutical packaging is an advantageous system for professionals in the sector. It allows them to reduce operating costs and optimize production time. Most product identification systems can be integrated into a production line and can be used to automate it. Here are the main marking systems used in the pharmaceutical industry:\n\nPrinting for Pharmaceutical Products\n\nPharmaceutical manufacturers can choose to print marking on their packaging. An intelligent production line can perfectly integrate automatic printing because it manages the printing of the products in an autonomous way. Continuous jet printing systems are the most widespread, as they are the most suitable for speed, especially for large production volumes.\n\nLabelling Pharma Products\n\nLabelling is a marking system that consists of applying a self-adhesive label to products or their packaging. However, this product identification solution can be more expensive compared to other marking systems. It should be noted, however, in some environments the label is indispensable, in others it may be a choice.\n\nArtificial intelligence allows the integration of the automatic labelling system into a production line. This solution spares manufacturers from labor shortages and lightens the workload of operators.\n\nLaser Marking Pharmaceutical Products\n\nLaser marking is the most advantageous for industrialists who are looking for fast and reliable identification of their products. This system also guarantees marking with a high quality of precision. Indeed, the inscriptions and patterns marked are visible and legible in a very clear way, with a constant quality.\n\nLaser marking also has a high resistance to heat, wear and acid due to the permanent marking. Furthermore, this marking process for pharmaceutical packaging is one of the fastest. A reduction of manufacturing and operating costs as well as the gain in productivity are its main advantages.\n\nHow to Choose a Marking System?\n\nFirms in all sectors (cosmetics, food, pharmaceuticals, etc.) should have a personalized and unique product identification solution. In order to use the right marking system adapted to its sector, the user company must consider the following criteria:\n\nThe needs of the operators,\n\nThe speed and configuration of the production line,\n\nThe environment,\n\nThe existing computer system,\n\nProduction and maintenance costs,\n\nThe data to be entered,\n\nStrict regulations, depending on the sector.\n\nThe various designers of pharmaceutical packaging labelling systems can offer fully customized tools. MGA Technologies make machines that can be integrated by the client companyâ€™s operators but also our marking system be integrated on an automated line by providing automation, software development and mechanical integration."
