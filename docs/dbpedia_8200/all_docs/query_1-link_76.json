        "text": "For oral solid dose (OSD) pharmaceuticals, decisions regarding the type of packaging used are critical to the success of a product. The best formulated product in the world can fail if it is contained in an inappropriate package. So how does one decide which packaging to use for a product?\n\nFirst and foremost, the package has to protect the product from damage or degradation. Different barriers can protect from moisture, light, or gases, such as oxygen or carbon dioxide. Blistered products may use cold-formed aluminum to block light completely. Vials, at times, use light protective sleeves for the same purpose. Bottled products may require the use of a coil to keep tablets from breaking during shipment. Alcami works with clients to customize the best package configuration for product protection.\n\nAdditionally, the packager needs to know how the product will be used and who will be using it. The appropriate package for a clinical setting may need to be blinded. When a package is blinded, the identity and strength of the product are hidden such that the patient is blind to what is being taken. Blister packaging can be utilized to make it easier to track patient compliance. A product intended for commercial distribution may need child-resistant packaging. This can be accomplished through the use of peel-push child-resistant backing for blister packs and child-resistant closures used on bottles."
