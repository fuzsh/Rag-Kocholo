        "text": "Calling packaging a matter of life and death sounds dramatic in most cases, but if you’re speaking of pharmaceutical packaging, the phrase rings true. Packaging plays an extremely important role in the pharmaceutical industry, serving a variety of crucial functions that are linked to consumer protection.\n\nPackaging Protects Pharmaceuticals from Physical Damage\n\nOne of the most obvious functions of pharmaceutical packaging is protection against physical damage as a product moves through the supply chain. Medication that has been crushed, broken, or spilled during transport is useless to a patient. Pharmaceutical packaging is instrumental in preventing such incidents.\n\nPackaging Protects Pharmaceuticals from Quality Degradation\n\nMany pharmaceutical products can be compromised by environmental factors like light or air. A compromised pharmaceutical product may fail to perform its intended function, leading to dangerous consequences for patients. Packaging plays a critical role in combating external elements, preventing chemical alterations and thus preserving the efficacy of medications.\n\nPackaging Provides Product Information\n\nIf misused, pharmaceutical products can cause more harm than good to patients. Pharmaceutical packaging is a perfect medium for communicating vital drug facts like dosage instructions and product warnings; it allows patients to use medications in a safe and informed manner.\n\nPharmaceutical packaging also allows for serialization and aggregation. Serialization is the assignment of a unique serial number to each sellable prescription product unit. This serial number provides information about the product’s origin, batch number, and validity date. Counterfeit and substandard drugs pose a major threat to public health, which is why serialization is so important in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nPharmaceutical Packaging Protects Children\n\nChildren are known for eating things that they shouldn’t. If a child gets into a parent’s medication, the results could be deadly. Pharmaceutical packaging companies manufacture child resistant packaging to prevent this kind of tragic accident."
