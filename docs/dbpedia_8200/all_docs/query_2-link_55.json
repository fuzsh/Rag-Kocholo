        "text": "When designing and manufacturing a new drug, knowing the key components of labeling and packaging is essential to conform to regulations. Although they share similarities, there is a distinct difference between the two. Packaging relates to the outer container that houses the contents, being designed to protect the drugs and ensure they are secure during transit. On the other hand, labeling refers to the inners, often being a plastic seal over the container. The purpose of the label is to provide sufficient information about the drug and displays the name of the product, the expiration date, an ingredient list, usage instructions, warnings, storage information, and smaller details like the batch code and inventory codes.\n\nAlthough careful consideration needs to be made when designing both, the two will have significant overlaps and will repeat certain key pieces of information. By understanding the objective of each, an effective design can be created to ensure the packaging is both aesthetically pleasing for customers while designed for transit whereas the labeling is detailed enough to educate patients about the drugs they have been prescribed. The packaging is the first thing a medical professional or patient will see when they get their hands on a product, so although plenty of information about the purpose of the medication and any warnings will still be necessary, more detailed usage guidelines can be saved for the label.\n\nThe associated legal requirements will also differ between packaging and labeling, with the label being more regulated within the pharmaceutical industry. To comply with the FDA, the labels are required to include components such as a list of both active and inactive ingredients, warnings of any side effects, and clear usage instructions which state how dosages should be measured. Although packaging will also conform to many of these rules, the label itself is what is likely to be referred to by patients when using a drug, so it is important for health and safety purposes to design descriptive labels.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, the packaging is there to keep the product itself safe and away from external threats such as moisture, dust, and other forms of contamination. It should be designed to provide the drug with a level of security during the product cycle and although functionality is the main aspect, it will also be the first thing a medical professional or patient will see when handling it. The outer packaging must make it apparent what condition or symptoms the medicine treats and provide enough information to those making a purchasing decision, allowing for an accurate understanding before the user reaches the label."
