        "text": "What constitutes a “pharmaceutical label”?\n\nA pharmaceutical label is used for a wide range of chemical products, from over-the-counter medications, such as painkillers and supplements, to medical and laboratory equipment, like infection test kits and sample containers.\n\nAs pharmaceutical products often contain volatile or dangerous substances, they present a heightened risk for the user. This means that there are regulations that must be followed and certain qualities that must be ensured.\n\nStrict labelling regulations are put in place to ensure that consumers are provided with clear and accurate information about the product, but what information do you need to include on your pharmaceutical labels?\n\nWhat are the pharmaceutical labelling regulations?\n\nJust as with any label for a product that is manufactured in the UK, there are certain requirements you must include to remain compliant with government regulations.\n\nDrug labelling regulations require certain information to be displayed, as set out in the Human Medicines Regulation 2012 – Part 13.\n\nHere are the 5 facts about your pharmaceutical products that need to be included on the label:\n\nThe product name and purpose, so the contents can be clearly identified\n\nDosage and use instructions\n\nSpecific instructions for demographics, such as pregnant women and children.\n\nIngredients, both active and inactive\n\nWarnings and potential adverse side effects\n\nIt is also important to note that pharmaceutical labels must feature braille for blind and partially sighted users. It must feature on more than one side of the product, be unabbreviated, and in a position that does not obscure the printed information.\n\nWhat are the practical requirements of a pharmaceutical label?\n\nAnother essential quality of pharmaceutical labels is that they must have the same durability as the lifespan of the product.\n\nThe label must remain in place and legible, so the information and instructions are always available while the product is in use and careful selection is needed to ensure the correct papers and inks are used.\n\nThis means that it must be able to withstand exposure to conditions that occur during storage, distribution or extensive laboratory usage. These conditions include:\n\nMoisture/humidity and submersion\n\nChemical exposure\n\nRough-textured surfaces\n\nHigh and low temperatures\n\nUV light/radiation\n\nIt must also be constructed with materials that will not contaminate the product."
