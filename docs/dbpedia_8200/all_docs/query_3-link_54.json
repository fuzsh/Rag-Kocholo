        "text": "Packaging mix-ups, often called “mislabelling,” are among the most common causes of a medicinal product recall. Therefore, you must establish a proper mechanism for packaging material control to eliminate all types of mix-ups.\n\nIt would be best to implement special care in the packaging areas to ensure that batch numbers and expiry dates are printed correctly.\n\nLabels, cartons, and leaflets are printed with correct product information. These packaging materials are assembled correctly in the packaging lines with the right product to fill every time.\n\nWhen you have to rework a faulty batch, follow the approved protocol, complete line clearance, and document and record all packaging activities to ensure the control of packaging materials.\n\nIt is also a GMP rule that mislabelled products should never be “over-labeled.” Unless you are careful, it is very easy to make an error during rework, or the over-label may be dislodged later, causing the product to be mislabelled once again.\n\nA product is “mislabelled” if the labeling and packaging information does not accurately reflect the contents of the container.\n\nFor example, if a label indicates that a bottle contains 100 capsules but less than 100 capsules inside, this is classified as a case of mislabelling.\n\nA more extreme and potentially dangerous example is if the product was stated as “tamper-evident,” but there is no evidence of tamper-proof seals.\n\nIt will also be considered mislabelled if it does not conform with the marketing authorization and claims.\n\nAs part of product manufacture, companies must register the product’s labeling details with the regulators. If there is any deviation from these label specifications, the company is in breach of regulations.\n\nOrigins of tamper-evident packaging\n\nIn 1982, a deranged person in the US sabotaged Tylenol by injecting cyanide into capsules in supermarkets, which eventually killed six people. The FDA responded by making tamper-evident packaging a legal requirement for over-the-counter products, and the Federal Anti-Tampering Act passed in 1983 made it a crime to tamper with packaged consumer products.\n\n1. Controlling printed packaging materials\n\nMany mislabelling incidents commence with the wrong issue of labels or other printed material from the store.\n\nThe GMP rules clearly state that each issue of printed material from the store must be accompanied by requisition paperwork and that there is a step of cross-checking that labels match the documented request before issue.\n\nIssuing of correct printed material is the first point of control. It is much better to prevent incorrect labels from being issued in the first place rather than finding them (or not) later on.\n\nMislabelling can cause incorrect consumption of medication, which can result in severe injury or even death of patients.\n\nThere are GMP controls over how manufacturers handle printed material. Printed material should be verified, kept separate, and always secured.\n\nThis ensures the distributed product does not result in recall or withdrawal from the marketplace. These measures help to protect patients from taking the wrong medicines.\n\nThe term “printed packaging material” includes:\n\n– Labels for containers (rolls of labels and cut labels)\n\n– Package leaflets (inserts and outserts)\n\n– Labels for cartons or packaging\n\n– Printed containers (e.g., lubes)\n\n2. Control of packaging materials at the printers\n\nPharmaceutical labeling suppliers are a significant component of a successful packaging and labeling process. Their adherence to change control and GMP compliance should be as strong as the manufacturer’s.\n\nYou should conduct routine audits of the printed material suppliers to ensure they maintain GMP standards.\n\nThe audit should focus on the printer’s line clearance practices, counting accuracy, and an acceptable system for handling and disposing of waste.\n\nPrinters should follow written and GMP-approved operating procedures to tighten packaging and labeling control. Tracking materials and keeping good records are needed to help prevent mix-ups.\n\nWhere different batches of printed material are being produced simultaneously, you should physically separate them from one another to avoid mix-ups.\n\nOther in-process controls at the printers include:\n\n– Using identification numbers that are unique to each revision\n\n– Optical bar codes for verification\n\n– Artwork control\n\nA common occurrence in the printing industry is the use of “make ready” packing, which refers to the first few sheets or labels that pass through a printing machine before the actual run starts.\n\nThere is a natural desire to save on material waste by minimizing make-ready or using it to set up other processes, but the wiser course of action is to discard it at each step in the run.\n\nThe cost of an improper matching of packaging materials can overpower the potential savings of reducing waste.\n\n3. Control of packaging materials at the warehouse\n\nReceiving printed material at the inward goods bay is crucial for producing a quality product.\n\nPlease make sure the correct printed materials are received, which will be released later to the packaging area.\n\nWhen the printed material arrives from the printers, you should apply a unique identifying number and place it into quarantine.\n\nFollowing receipt and quarantine, quality control (QC) examines and verifies printed materials against standard specimens and specifications to prevent any mix-ups or errors.\n\nQC must take particular care with sampling and testing because many labels, cartons, and leaflets look alike. Packaging and labeling samples should not be returned to inventory.\n\nPrinted materials can be released for use by quality assurance only after inspection and approval are done.\n\na. Arrival of printed materials\n\n– You should count roll labels either on receipt or at issue.\n\n– Supplier counts are only acceptable if the supplier is specifically qualified and the supplier certifies the exact count for each roll.\n\n– Supplier numbering of labels is an acceptable alternative.\n\n– Ensure Cut labels are counted and effectively verified by the manufacturer because of the risk of mix-up.\n\nb. Quarantine of printed materials\n\n– Printed material must be quarantined from use until it has been thoroughly quality-controlled.\n\n– Quarantining involves placing the received material into a locked, separate store secured from unauthorized access.\n\n– When they handle printed material, all personnel should double-check that the “Quarantine” label has been replaced by an “Approved for use” label. If it hasn’t, do not use the printed material.\n\n4. Quality control of printed materials\n\nQC uses sampling plans to specify the number of samples of printed material to be taken. There are several types of sampling plans QC uses, e.g., statistical, targeted, and zero acceptance numbers.\n\nAlthough QC uses all of them for printed material in some respects, the reasons why each is chosen are beyond the scope of this article.\n\nSuffice it to say sampling plans for printed material account for at least the following:\n\n– The quantity and quality of printed material received\n\n– The quality of printed material required\n\n– The nature of the material (e.g., primary and printed materials)\n\n– The production methods\n\n– An audit of the printed material supplier\n\n5. Printed material issue, coding, and returns\n\nLabels and cartons (outers) can be coded with batch numbers and expiry dates offline or online.\n\nOffline coding requires a specific packaging record and all the usual checks and clearances.\n\nOnline coding is usually done when the printed material is applied to the primary packaging.\n\nOccasionally, unused, uncoded printed material is returned to the store for later use. The return process requires specific checks of its own.\n\n6. Control of packaging materials storage and coding\n\na. Offline coding\n\nSome manufacturers code the batch number and expiration dates “offline.” i.e., in a separate production step called printed mailer coding.\n\nWhen offline coding is used, you should conduct line clearances and double-check that the packaging line is used for the same batch and expiration.\n\nCorrectly coded printed packaging material may be returned to the printed material store for reissue or transferred directly to the packaging line.\n\nb. Line check\n\nBefore packaging begins, you should conduct a line clearance to ensure no potential for mislabelling.\n\nThe line clearance involves at least two things:\n\n– Complete removal of all previous product documentation and printed material of the prior batch.\n\n– Double-check that the correct printed material has been selected and presented to the line when new printed material is added to the line. This check must be recorded and authorized in the packaging record.\n\nc. Packaging line\n\nDuring the actual packaging, many things may need to be corrected. So, you will need to conduct frequent online checks.\n\n– When printed packaging material is first presented to the line, please ensure that only the correct material has been introduced.\n\n– When additional packaging materials are brought to the line, double-check them for correctness.\n\n– Double-check the items on startup when the line stops for any reason.\n\n– When automatic online verifiers are used, verify that they read correctly before use.\n\nd. Online coding\n\nSome companies prefer to print the batch number and expiry dates directly “online,” i.e., apply the information. In contrast, the printed material is assembled with the product to minimize the chance of mix-ups before labeling.\n\nThis approach requires additional controls in place.\n\nIt is essential to double-check the setup for online coding to verify that only the correct batch number and expiry date are programmed in.\n\nAs the packaging run progresses, it is essential also to check that the inking or printing has stayed the same, which could leave units incompletely coded or not coded at all.\n\ne. Issue of packaging materials\n\nPrinted material is to be checked against the work order to verify the following:\n\n– The assigned product and lot number\n\n– The printed material code and version number\n\n– The batch number and expiry date (if the printed material is already coded)\n\nf. Return control of packaging materials\n\nPrinted materials returned to the store should only be handled by authorized personnel. The person returning the printed packaging material should never directly put it back into storage.\n\nExtreme care must be taken when returning the printed material to storage because it is well-known that mix-ups occur if returned items are placed in the wrong storage locations.\n\nThe alternative to returning unused printed material to the store is outright destruction.\n\nIf the coded printed material isn’t used on the line, it must be destroyed to avoid ending up in subsequent batches.\n\nWhen the printed material is destroyed, it must be done securely, accompanied by a signed record of destruction.\n\nSome organizations will not return printed material to the store because of the potential to mix up the returned item.\n\nIt is a GMP regulation that coded printed material is never returned to the store for reuse. The reasons for this should be apparent, as coding is always unique to a batch.\n\ng. Line clearance & setup\n\nIn a busy packing hall, many products are generally processed at once. Unless specific GMP controls are in place, a rogue item of printed material will inevitably end up on a different product.\n\nThis may not get detected later and could injure patients and cause a recall. Proper line segregation helps to physically separate different printed materials, much of which look similar.\n\nA combination of physical segregation, double line checks when new printed material arrives, and detailed line clearances are critical GMP labeling controls.\n\nLine clearances are used in the labeling and packaging area as another control to prevent product mix-up.\n\nThe following steps must be conducted and verified before the start of the packaging and labeling operation:\n\n– Clean the area and machines,\n\n– Remove all previous products and machines from the area.\n\n– Remove all waste from the area and machines.\n\n– Reconcile all printed material and products from the previous batch.\n\nOnce the above steps are complete, please make sure to document all activities that the area and machines are inspected and found to be clear of all previous products.\n\nBefore starting any filling and labeling operation, please look over the line thoroughly following a standard operating procedure to make sure that all materials, products, labels, and records from previous operations have been removed.\n\nThe person responsible should initial the batch record to show that this check has been carried out.\n\nLabel the line clearly to show the product (and the strength of the product) to be packaged.\n\nThe label counters or code readers should be tested to verify that they work correctly.\n\nCarefully check all labeling and packaging material to match the descriptions in the batch packaging records.\n\n7. Online control of packaging materials\n\nUsing reliable controls such as bar code readers is an expected practice in packaging operations. Removal or turning off a barcode reader takes away a vital packaging control.\n\nAt the same time, regular misreading is also not acceptable. The reader should be repaired, returned to the line, and re-validated to avoid suspected false reading.\n\nDuring the packaging and labeling operation, GMP rules specify the number of necessary online (in-process) controls.\n\nOnline controls of packaging materials should include the following checks:\n\n– The bulk material and printed material\n\n– The appearance of the product (e.g., chipped labels, particles in sterile injectable)\n\n– The equipment used (including the label verifier)\n\n– The count or measure of the filled container\n\n– The label appearance and adhesion coding\n\n– The tightness of the cap\n\n– The seal integrity of the packs\n\nWhen these checks are done by production staff, the check should be audited by the Quality Department.\n\n8. Reconciliation of packaging materials\n\nReconciliation of printed materials is one of the critical GMP packaging material controls. The reconciliations indicate how many printed material items need to be accounted for.\n\nIt is well-known that incorrect calculations are common mistakes in this area, for example, assuming that any unaccounted-for numbers must be rejected. While reconciliation limits should be tight, around 100%, every result isn’t expected to be exactly that number."
