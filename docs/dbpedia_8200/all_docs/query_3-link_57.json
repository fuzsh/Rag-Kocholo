        "text": "Each time you take over-the-counter (OTC) medicine or a prescription (Rx) medication, take time to read your medicine label. Every medicine has specific instructions for safe use that should always be followed precisely. The instructions tell you what amount of medicine to take, how to take it, when to take it, and when not to take it.\n\nAlways keep your medicine in the original packaging so that you have proper dosage information on hand. Scroll over or click on the OTC medicine label below to learn more, or jump down to the reading prescription labels section.\n\nOver-the-Counter Medicine Label\n\nLearn more about the elements of OTC medicine labels, including uses, warnings, directions, and other information, below.\n\nACTIVE INGREDIENT AND PURPOSE\n\nActive Ingredient\n\nThis section lists the ingredient or ingredients that make the medicine work. For example, the active ingredient is what helps your fever go down, reduces your pain, or relieves your cough. It is especially important to pay attention to this section if you are taking more than one medicine—whether OTC or prescription—to make sure you are not taking too much of the same active ingredient. Too much of an active ingredient can be harmful.\n\nPurpose\n\nThis section tells you what type—or category—of medicine it is, such as an acid reducer or antihistamine.\n\nUses\n\nThis section tells you what symptoms or illnesses you can expect the medicine to treat. You should only use products that treat the symptoms you have. If you are using more than one medicine, pay specific attention to the active ingredients so you don’t accidentally take too much.\n\nWarnings\n\nThere are times when you should not take a particular medicine. The warnings section explains these times, and also tells you when a healthcare provider needs to be consulted, as well as when to stop taking a product.\n\nThe warnings section also lets you know if there might be side effects to a medicine and if you should be cautious during any particular activities, such as driving. This section also may tell pregnant and nursing women not to use certain products unless they’ve talked to their healthcare provider and reminds parents and other caregivers to keep medicine out of the reach of children.\n\nDirections\n\nA medicine’s directions tell you exactly how and when to take a medicine. Remember, you should never take more than the Drug Facts label says, and you should never take a medicine more often or for longer than the label says unless told to do so by your healthcare provider. Taking more of a medicine or for longer than directed can be dangerous.\n\nBe very careful when giving medicine to children. Read and follow the age or weight instructions on the label and always use the correct measuring device when administering liquid medicines. If you have any questions, talk to your child’s healthcare provider.\n\nOther Information\n\nThis section tells you other important information you should know about a medicine, such as where to store it. Take a look at the labels on the medicines you have in your house and make sure you are keeping them in the right place. Most medicines should be kept away from heat and humidity. And remember what you learned in the warnings section: Regardless of the medicine, always keep medicines out of the reach and sight of children.\n\nInactive Ingredients\n\nThe inactive ingredients section includes important information, especially if you or a loved one has a known allergy.\n\nQuestions\n\nAlways talk to your healthcare professional if you have any questions. You can also call the toll-free number listed in this section.\n\nPRESCRIPTION MEDICINE LABEL\n\nLearn more about the elements of prescription medicine labels, including warnings, expiration dates, and pharmacy information, below.\n\nWarnings\n\nWarnings are specific to the medicine you are taking. Always read the warnings before taking your medicine.\n\nExpiration Date\n\nMedicines expire. You should not take a medicine after the expiration date.\n\nPharmacy Information\n\nYour local pharmacy name, address and phone number and the name of the doctor that has prescribed your medicine will be listed. Contact your pharmacist if you have any questions about your prescription.\n\nYour prescription (Rx) number is unique to your medicine and helps the pharmacist ensure you go home with the correct prescription."
