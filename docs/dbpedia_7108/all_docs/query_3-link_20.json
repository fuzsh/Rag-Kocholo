        "text": "The Swift Current Research and Development Centre (Swift Current RDC) was established in 1920 in Swift Current, Saskatchewan. It is one of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's (AAFC) network of 20 research and development centres.\n\nThe Centre is associated with two satellite locations:\n\nIndian Head Research Farm (IHRF), Indian Head, SK; and\n\nPrairie Directorate Regina Office, Regina, SK\n\nAreas of Research\n\nSwift Current RDC focuses on developing varieties of spring wheat and durum; agronomic research into pulses and specialty crops; environmentally-sustainable production practices; and improved nutrition for pasture-fed beef. It also leads initiatives on bio-products, environmental stewardship and sustainable development, including mitigating the impact of climate change and maximizing producer returns, while reducing agricultural impacts on the environment.\n\nSearch Research projects from the Swift Current Research and Development Centre to learn more about what we do.\n\nSector Needs\n\nThe Swift Current RDC carries out innovative research, development, technology and knowledge transfer activities in support of theAAFC's Strategic Plan for Science, which include:\n\nCereals and pulses\n\nResearch on spring and durum wheat includes genomics-assisted breeding, incorporating resistance to pre-harvest sprouting and weather-related damage, mitigating weather- and disease-induced loss of market value and food quality, and reducing losses from pests and disease, with special emphasis on Fusarium Head Blight and abiotic stresses.\n\nForages and beef\n\nSwift Current RDC is a Centre of Excellence for Rangeland Management of Beef. Research includes native forage breeding, production and management; riparian ecology and biodiversity; and ecologically based approaches and solutions that support sustainable agricultural systems. The Centre is home to the only facility in Canada that tests the salinity tolerance of plants.\n\nAgro-ecosystem resilience\n\nIntegrated cropping systems and best management practices for cereals, pulses, forages and woody species are enhancing environmental performance and sustainability, improving agriculture water inputs and sustainable water use practices, developing irrigation and drainage technologies, and integrating trees with crops and livestock.\n\nMeet our Scientists\n\nFind out more about the scientists at Swift Current Research and Development Centre through their profiles below."
