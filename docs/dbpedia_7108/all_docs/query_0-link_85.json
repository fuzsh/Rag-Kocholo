She kept driving and hit a whiteout a kilometre later, she said.\n\n\"I didn't know what was going on,\" she recalled.\n\nEberl said there are three lanes of traffic backed up, with some vehicles attempting to drive around through the ditch.\n\nWhite Butte RCMP is also urging motorists to avoid Highway 1, saying drivers who must be on the road should expect delays.\n\nIt said people should monitor the Saskatchewan highway hotline for more information."
