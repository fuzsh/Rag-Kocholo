        "text": "Two months after landing a multimillion-dollar B.C. highway technology contract, Ottawa’s Quarterhill (TSE:QTRH) has secured a role in the largest infrastructure project in Saskatchewan’s history.\n\nThe local Industrial Internet of Things company, formerly known as patent licensing firm WiLAN, says it’s received a $1.95-million contract to provide four commercial vehicle pre‑screening stations for the Regina Bypass Project.\n\nThe Saskatchewan public-private partnership is a $1.88-billion initiative that includes 40 kilometres of new four-lane highways, a dozen overpasses, 55 kilometres of new service roads as well as twinning and resurfacing existing highways.\n\nQuarterhill’s contribution includes technology that will allow provincial officials to monitor and screen the weights and dimensions of commercial vehicles. Specifically, the company will supply scales, licence plate readers and cameras that will be remotely monitored and controlled.\n\nThe contract was awarded to Quarterhill’s wholly owned subsidiary, International Road Dynamics, which the Ottawa company purchased earlier this year for $63.5 million as it embarked on its new business model.\n\nLike the commercial side of the Internet of Things – which typically refers to the wireless connection of appliances, devices and objects for applications such as controlling home electronics and lights with a smartphone – the industrial sector utilizes sensors and information-collecting devices to generate data and communicate information and analytics to users and each other.\n\nThe Saskatchewan contract follows a $5 million sale of truck inspection equipment to the British Columbia government in June.\n\nQuarterhill stock price was down a penny, or less than one per cent, to $1.65 in mid-afternoon trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange Tuesday."
