        "text": "Naming of Saskatchewan Roads\n\nPart I: Road Naming in Saskatchewan\n\nPart II: Smith-Stevenson Road\n\nPart III: Grandmas Memories\n\n..... It is intriguing to open up a glimpse into history and determine why roads and highways have received the names they have been christened with. In Saskatchewan there has been an evolution in the roadways and highways. Although it may be possible that the derivation of some of the roadway names may be forgotten, it is a unique research project to delve into the nature of the roadway names, and follow regional trends. Were roadways named after surnames, given names, tribal names, a settlement, a natural feature, a park? Was a road named after a town, village which no longer exists or perhaps after a landscape feature, a river or lake with a name that has since been changed. Hundreds of years ago Kanata, meaning, in Iroquois, \"a cluster of dwellings\", this name began appearing on maps, giving rise to the country name of Canada. In like fashion, the Cree word \"kisiskâciwani-sîpiy\" for \"swiftly flowing waters or swiftly flowing river\" became the name for the province of Saskatchewan. Names of the roadways in the province of Saskatchewan may also have aboriginal, ethnic, royal origins, or they may honour community founders, saints, soldiers and politicians. Reflecting the birthright and heritage of the community, the name of a roadway may truly honour the prominent people and pioneers. A roadway name may reflect the inherited values, customs, legacy and qualities of the district.\n\n..... Beginning as animal trails, horseback riders and red river carts used these trails to travel between outpost and fur trading fort before the twentieth century. The Canadian Pacific Railway extended the rails across the Dominion of Canada following a Confederation promise of 1871 to the province of British Columbia. The original transcontinental rail route was to utilize the North Saskatchewan River Valley - part of the provisional district of Saskatchewan, North West Territories as the original settlements supported the fur trade which was richer north of the tree line. However the CPR instead ran parallel to the Canadian American border through the District of Assiniboia, NWT allowing new towns and villages to spring up across the prairies. Town sites were laid out approximately eight or ten miles apart, that being the distance it was thought farmers could haul a load of grain and return home the same day if the primitive dirt roads and trails were in good condition.\"EOFGP The race was on between the CPR and the Canadian National Railway to see who would be the first to deliver rail services to outlying areas. When motorized vehicles became popular and horse and buggy was abandoned ~ around the era of the Second World War ~ main roads followed the early trails, and the established grade of the rail line.\n\nHistoric Red River Cart Trail Names The Saskatchewan Trail.

Traoy (Qu'Appelle - Battleford trail. The above is not a complete listing of the Red River Cart Trails which ones radiated from the forts and trading posts to the next.\n\n..... The Dominion Land Survey began in 1871 after the purchase of Rupert's Land from the Hudson Bay Company in July 15, 1870. The survey system divided the land into six mile townships encompassing 640 acre sections each one mile square. This system was modelled after the American Public Lands Survey System, with the difference that the Canadian system allocated road allowances. Township roads (traversing the land easterly and westerly) and Range roads (lie north and south ) were situated swix miles apart. Every range road was space two miles apace and each township road was allocated every mile. These roads began as numbered roads, the range roads firstly indicated which meridian line the road is to the west of, and then by which range the road is in followed by how many miles travelling east to west. The township roads begin firsly with the township numberincrease in numerical ascendancy from south (US Canada border) to north. Highways began by following these suveyed road allowances, and the term adopated by the early vehicular enthusiasts during the early 1900s was \"driving on the square\" It wasn't until the 1950s and 1960s that provincial highways were straightened and ashpalt applied. Provincial highways also began with a numerical system, with groups of numbers designating unique distinctions. Highways, and gravel roads then adopted \"official or commemorative\" names which had the distinction of honouring people, geographic features, sidings, historical one room schoolhouses, ghost towns or communities.\n\nHIGHWAY DESIGANTIONS 1-99 main travel routes between main centres 100 to 199 northern routes 200 to 299 scenic provincial routes or travel to a provincial or regional park. 300 to 399 A Saskatchewan town access and past routes of provincial highways that have been realigned or reassigned. 600 to 699gravel roads which extend across the province in a north and south direction. 700 to 799 gravel roads maintained by the rural municipality extend east and west across Saskatchewan 900 to 999 far north roads accessing communities or resources north of the tree line.\n\nA few additional comments from Charlie Matt regarding the numbered highways in the province\n\n- Hwys numbered from 1 to 899 are Provincial Highways or access roads to communities or provincially designated facilities. **The 200 and 300 series numbers are not signed with a Hwy No. sign. Every highway with a specific number is officially designated as such in the Sask Gazette.\n\n-Signs in the 600 and 700 series are not strictly gravel roads, many are paved. These roads are maintained by the local municipalities.\n\n- Hwys numbered with 900 series are Provincial Roads, typically found north of forest line. They are a lower standard of highway. These are typically only found in the north and were primarily built as logging haul roads. Many of these are now being de-classified primarily due to decline in logging in those areas. Some may either be closed or not be maintained on a regular basis.\n\nHIGHWAY NAMES Official or Commemorative nameConcurrency with numbered highway Trans-Canada Highway Saskatchewan Highway 1 Veterans Memorial Highway Saskatchewan Highway 2 CanAm HighwaySaskatchewan Highways SK 35, Sk 39, Sk 6, Sk 3, Sk 2 and U.S. Route 85.

Hanson Lake Road: Primary gravel Saskatchewan Highway 120 and primary paved Saskatchewan Highway 106\n\n\"Nothing has really happened until it has been recorded.\" Virginia Woolf\n\n..... Road names are requested and paid for by the municipal government notes Charlie Matt. The community has disappeared but the locals or persons who lived there previously want some way to remember or identify the location. Sometimes road name is used and sometimes a fingerboard is utilized if there is an existing road name sign that the Rural Municipality (RM) does not want to change. The process we use can be found on our Signing Opportunities website under Rural Municipal Signing category pick found towards the bottom of the Ministry of Saskatchewan web page http://www.highways.gov.sk.ca/signing-opportunities/.\n\n..... Some of this may have started back in approximatel 1975 when there was a provincial \"Welcome Home\" campaign across the province. Many communities were probably still viable, however in contemporary times, many have disappeared. A method was needed to address requests for signs to such and such a \"place\". If it doesn't exist anymore, the Ministry of Highways typically does not have any rationalization to install Official Highway signs for a non-existent 'community`'. People driving in the province use Official signs to find gas, food, hotels etc. It would not be well for the Ministry to be sending people into the backwaters looking for services that they will never find. Thus the use of Road Name signs. There are also other ways to sign for those places which were at one time booming centres of the late 1800s and early twentieth century, and have now become virtual ghost towns.\n\n..... The Ministry of Highways also uses a Federal Geographic Names website to validate name spelling and location with some of the requests we get from the RM's. If it is not found on this website; Querying Canadian Geographical names; it never officially existed, but there may have been some kind of local naming for that place, which has been encountered west of Saskatoon for instance.\n\n..... Canadian Geographical names http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/earth-sciences/geography/place-names/10786\n\n..... Where it may be that some of the records behind the naming of the roads and highways of Saskatchewan have not been delved into in this brief introduction to Saskatchewan Road Names, however one road has only recently been named. In early August 2015, folks came together to celbrate the naming of the \"SMITH-STEVENSON\" road in Saskatchewan. A family of homesteaders all farmed astride this right of way or in close proximity. By settling near to each other, an extended family could help one another at the busy season of harvesting before the snow arrived. Gordon Neish, a family member, has sutmitted a history of the Smith-Stevenson homesteaders and Grandmas Memories. .\n\n\" A good character is the best tombstone. Those who loved you and were helped by you will remember you when forget-me-nots have withered. Carve your name on hearts, not on marble.\" Charles Spurgeon\n\n..... In the city of Saskatoon, the Saskatoon Public Schools undertook a project, writing a booklet, \"Streets and Roads of Saskatoon\" wherein they worked together \"to delve into the past and record the circumstances which led Saskatoon City Fathers in their selection of street names.\"Introduction . The Regina Public Library has similarly published a book, Regina ~ the street where you live. So, however a road receives its name, the history continues onward, and it is indeed helpful to preserve the memory, of where the name arose. It is also interesting to contemplate which comes first the roadname designated after a homesteader, politician or railway offical, or did a parent name their offspring after the village where they grew up, the town where they were bornor perhaps where they went to college. Road way names celebrate our provincial heritage, and also family history. If naming your child after some place or memorable road in Saskatchewan, your child would truly have a unique story from their genealogical ancestry, a story from their parent's history which was memorable to carry it through in their baby naming.\n\n..... Why, indeed, did a roadway in rural Saskatchewan assume the name that it did? Did the original homesteaders shape the road names? Was it something to do with the heritage, ethnic background, language of the original settlers there? Did the roadway names originate because of the flora, fauna or geography?\n\n..... While the vastness of the named roads are not presented here. Take a Saskatchewan Road Trip and begin exploring. To become intimately acquainted with more of these roads, it would be enlightening to peruse a comment or two here in the case of other roadways in the province of Saskatchewan. With such comments, a preliminary step forward would be taken to consider those names given to the Saskatchewan highways and roadways which figure more or less preominently in the legend and folklore of the province.\n\n\"History is the witness that testifies to the passing of time; it illumines reality, vitalizes memory, provides guidance in daily life and brings us tidings of antiquity.\" Cicero\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY:\n\nBarry, Bill.
