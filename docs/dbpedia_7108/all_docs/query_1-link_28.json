        "text": "Getting around on Saskatchewan Highways\n\nBy Bus\n\nRider Express Transportation services Regina, Saskatoon and Prince Albert with a fleet of 15-passenger vans. It also has 55-passenger buses with routes from Saskatchewan to Alberta and British Columbia that make stops in several major cities, including Edmonton, Calgary, Kelowna, Kamloops and Vancouver.\n\nKCTI Travels provides a 15-passenger shuttle service between Saskatoon and Edmonton with Saskatchewan pick-ups and drop-offs in North Battleford and Lloydminster. The company is based in Prince Albert and plans to expand its routes in the future.\n\nFerry Crossings\n\nFor a unique travel experience try taking one of our ferries. There are many seasonal ferry operations dispersed throughout the province. View further information regarding ferry crossing locations, capacity, operating times, etc. here.\n\nRoad conditions and driving rules\n\nSaskatchewan has more roads per capita than anywhere else in Canada. Getting around is easy, once you know the rules of the road.\n\nFind out current highway conditions across Saskatchewan by visiting the Saskatchewan Highway Hotline.\n\nRules of the Road\n\nSpeed Limits: Across Canada, distances and speed limits are posted in metric (kilometres and kilometres per hour). 1 kilometre or km = 0.6 miles; 1 mile = 1.6 km; 100 km/hour = 62.5 miles/hour.\n\nEmergency Vehicles: All drivers must slow down to 60 km/h when passing emergency vehicles stopped on the roadside that have their lights flashing. This includes city police and RCMP vehicles, fire trucks, ambulances and tow trucks.\n\nChildren in Vehicles: Child car seats are mandatory in Saskatchewan. Children who are under the age of 6 years or weighing up to 40 pounds must travel in safety-approved car seats.\n\nSeat Belts: Seat belt use is mandatory for all drivers and passengers in Canada.\n\nDriver's Licences: Tourists from any other country are permitted to use their valid licence for a period of 3 months.\n\nInsurance: Vehicle Insurance is compulsory in Saskatchewan. US visitors are advised to obtain a Canadian Non-Resident Inter-Provincial Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance Card, which is accepted as evidence of financial responsibility in case of accident. This card is available in the U.S. through insurance companies.\n\nVehicle accident: If you are involved in an accident on the highway or in a rural community, contact the nearest detachment of the RCMP and your vehicle insurer for assistance. In cities, contact the local police service.\n\nTrailers and RVs: Visitors travelling in RVs or vehicles with trailers are welcome. Trailers must not exceed 8'6\" in width and 75'6\" in length ; exceeding these limits may require you to pay a customs assessment. Any permits required are issued at the port of entry. Trucks pulling campers and boats should also ensure they meet these regulations.\n\nFuel: Gas and oil are sold by the litre (1.0 U.S. gallon = 3.78 litres). Diesel fuel is available along major highways and urban centres; propane is easily available in most centres."
