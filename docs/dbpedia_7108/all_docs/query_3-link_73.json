        "text": "It's a massive job keeping Saskatchewan's 26,000 kilometres of highway from crumbling and, as CBC's iTeam has learned, the government is having a difficult time keeping up.\n\nAlmost half of last year's highway contracts were completed late, according to government officials.\n\nThe Ministry of Highways awarded $387 million in construction and repair work in 2012-13. Of the 125 projects, 57 of them, or 46 per cent, did not finish on time.\n\nThe ministry says sometimes projects are late because contractors purposely defer government work in favour of more lucrative private work.\n\nDeputy minister of Highways and Infrastructure Nithi Govindasamy says he is reviewing the late contracts to see what can be done to reduce them.\n\nThe amount of work completed behind schedule has almost doubled over the past three years.\n\nIn 2010-11, 26 per cent of contracts were late. That number rose to 32 per cent in 2011-12, and to 46 per cent in 2012-13.\n\nBad roads lead to safety concerns\n\nPeople in south eastern Saskatchewan say construction delays aren't merely inconvenient. They can also put people at risk.\n\n“That's a real concern for us as well as just the safety of being able to travel in and out of the communities here,\" explains Ross MacDonald, a rancher who lives near Lake Alma.\n\nMacDonald, who sits on the South Central District Planning Committee, says there's an urgency to get roads fixed in a timely way.\n\nHe points out that there's been a dramatic increase in heavy truck traffic on the roads because of the booming oil industry, often leading to large and dangerous potholes.\n\n“The roads just weren’t designed for it, so they’re deteriorating a lot more quickly than any sort of repair effort,” he said.\n\nIndustry blames the weather\n\nThe association that represents highways contractors in Saskatchewan blames a string of unusually bad weather.\n\nShantel Lipp, president of the Saskatchewan Heavy Construction Association, says flooding during those years meant that a lot of scheduled highways work had to be postponed.\n\n\"What you're dealing with is more or less a ripple effect.\" Lipp said.\n\nThe ministry points out that in 2011-12 and 2012-13 it spent $70 million in emergency flood repairs, which forced companies to delay other highways ministry projects.\n\nContractors defer highways work for 'more lucrative' contracts: government\n\nIn an interview last November, highways assistant deputy minister Ted Stobbe told CBC that sometimes contractors delay government work for \"more lucrative\" opportunities.\n\n\"So they know what the penalties are, they know what the consequences are going to be, but they elect for business reasons to do something that extends our contract,\" he said.\n\nStobbe, who has since retired from the ministry, said this is inconvenient for the government and for taxpayers, but it's understandable from the contractor's perspective.\n\nStill, the Ministry of Highways has recently changed the rules in an effort to discourage companies from taking this approach.\n\nIn 2012, after a review, it decided to increase the penalties, known as \"liquidated damages\" from a maximum of $1,100 per day to $2,000 per day.\n\n\"We do have to give it some time before coming to a judgment as to whether or not it's working,\" Govindersamy said. \"It's still early in the game in my opinion.\"\n\nLess than one per cent of the $387 million in contracts awarded in 2012-13 by the Ministry of Highways resulted in “liquidated damages” penalties so far, totalling $500,000.\n\nGovernment considering legislative changes\n\nGovindasamy said his ministry needs to do more work before it can fully understand the problem.\n\nMinistry officials currently have no way of tracking whether contracts are days or months behind schedule. The total value of a whole category of penalties classified as “site occupancy” cannot currently be calculated by the ministry.\n\nGovindasamy is unable to say how often contractors are purposely late with government work while they pursue other business opportunities.\n\nSaskatchewan considers tightening bidding rules\n\nGovindasamy is weighing his options to improve the system, including looking at an approach used in Ontario.\n\nIt has a system of \"prequalification\" in place for contractors who want to bid on ministry work.\n\nIndustry open to new rules\n\nThe Saskatchewan Heavy Construction Association acknowledges some contractors do delay government contracts because of more lucrative opportunities.\n\nBut Lipp says that is the exception."
