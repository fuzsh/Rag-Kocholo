        "text": "In an effort to help the province rebound from the impacts of the pandemic, the Government of Saskatchewan has committed $325 million for improvement of provincial highways. Their goal? To support economic recovery and provide improved safety, connectivity, and environmental sustainability on the province’s highways.\n\nThis project includes 29 highway grading and surfacing projects, including thin membrane surface, strengthened secondary roadway, passing lane, and twinning projects. Our team collaborated with SNC-Lavalin, Soli Solutions, and Scott Land and Lease to provide program management services. We acted as the owner’s engineer on behalf of Saskatchewan Ministry of Highways during the design and construction of the various highway projects throughout Saskatchewan. Our project team was responsible for the overall management, coordination, evaluation, review, and monitoring of the design and construction projects within the program. We also provided land acquisition services for the program and reviewed and updated multiple Ministry of Highways design and construction standards and specifications.\n\nConstruction of all highway projects is anticipated to be completed by October 2022. This will allow for improved capacity along dozens of highways throughout Saskatchewan, creating safer roads for thousands of people across the province."
