        "text": "How SaskWater Delivers\n\nThe majority of our municipal customers own and operate their local water distribution systems and manage the relationship with their residents. These communities rely on us to provide them with potable water that meets or exceeds provincial water quality standards and regulations. Without the need to operate and maintain costly water treatment infrastructure, our customers can concentrate on water distribution to their residents and prioritize other community initiatives.\n\nPooling Regional Resources\n\nMany rural communities benefit from the cost-effective, sustainable solutions available through regional water supply systems. These systems produce potable water at a regional water treatment plant and distribute it to surrounding communities through a pipeline network.\n\nSaskWater owns and operates the Wakaw, Melfort, Elbow, Melville, Gravelbourg, and Meadow Lake water treatment plants, which provide water supply services to their own municipality as well as customers in the surrounding areas. In total, twenty-one communities and several rural pipeline groups are served directly by these regional systems. Several of our rural pipeline group customers count additional municipalities among their customers.\n\nSaskWater also owns and operates regional purchase and transmission supply systems where potable water is purchased from bulk suppliers and delivered to our customers.\n\nTo supply these systems, we purchase water from various cities including Saskatoon, Lloydminster, and Regina as well as the Buffalo Pound Water Administration Board.\n\nSaskWater recently estimated that if every community receiving potable water supplied by one of our regional systems was served by its own free-standing infrastructure, more than 80 water treatment plants would be required to provide the potable water supplied through our regional networks.\n\nTailored Solutions\n\nA SaskWater owned and operated water supply system may offer a worry-free solution for individual municipalities. SaskWater has the resources to purchase and operate municipal water infrastructure or construct new water supply and water treatment systems, depending on the needs of a community. Each stand-alone system supplies potable water to a municipality for delivery through their own distribution system.\n\nWe currently own and operate stand-alone systems in White City, Pierceland, and Cupar."
