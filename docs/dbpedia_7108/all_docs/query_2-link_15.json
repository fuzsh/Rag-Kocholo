A complete and authorized copy of each report is available from the SSTA Research Centre.\n\nThe opinions and recommendations expressed in this report are those of the author and may not be in agreement with SSTA officers or trustees, but are offered as being worthy of consideration by those responsible for making decisions.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHow Was This Instructional Resource Developed?\n\nLocal Government in Saskatchewan: An Instructional Resource for Grade 12 was developed through a collaboration among six Saskatchewan organizations:\n\nFederation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations (FSIN)\n\nSaskatchewan Association of Health Organizations (SAHO)\n\nSaskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities (SARM)\n\nSaskatchewan Learning (SaskLearning)\n\nSaskatchewan School Trustees Association (SSTA)\n\nSaskatchewan Urban Municipalities Association (SUMA)\n\nMore detailed information about the mandate of each of these organizations and the services it provides can be found in the Appendix at the end of this instructional resource. Each of these organizations contributed staff time, ideas and other resources to this project. Drafts of this resource were reviewed by representatives of these organizations.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhy is Local Government Important?\n\nThe local community is where good citizenship begins. Students of every age can contribute to their community through participation in community projects and volunteer work.\n\nLocal government is an important dimension of community. Decisions made by mayor, chief, or reeve and their councils affect the daily lives of students. For example, students rely on the fire department to keep their homes safe. They need safe water and adequate sewage disposal for good health. Students use facilities such as public libraries and swimming pools provided by local government. They travel on roads and walk on sidewalks maintained by local government.\n\nDecisions made by boards of education affect students everyday lives. For example, the textbooks that students read are provided by the board of education. Health region boards make decisions about allocation of resources that influence the health care services available in local committees.\n\nBecause many of the services provided by local government are practical, concrete and real, even the youngest child can understand and relate to them.\n\nLocal government occurs close to home, so there may be opportunities for students to meet elected officials, to observe or read about council meetings, and to debate local issues. These real-life experiences can help create a sense of connection to the democratic process. They can build and strengthen students commitment to citizenship, both as a participant and as a leader.\n\nStudents will benefit from learning more about local government. They will have a better understanding of how their community works, and they may come to realize that their participation in local government as a voter or elected official can make a difference.\n\nCommunities and the province as a whole will also benefit when students learn about local government. The students of today are the mayors/chiefs/reeves, councillors, school trustees and health board members of tomorrow. They are the people who will lobby for change, lead delegations and vote in the years ahead. The better that young people are prepared for these roles, the stronger our communities will be.\n\nLocal Government in Saskatchewan: An Instructional Resource for Grade 12 is intended to supplement the existing Saskatchewan Grade 12 Social Studies Curriculum Guide. Students learn about the Canadian government in Grade 12 and the provincial government in Grade 4, so this instructional resource on local government can be used to enhance and enrich students knowledge of government.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHow is This Instructional Resource Organized?\n\nThis instructional resource covers six topics:\n\nWhat are the types of government in Canada?\n\nWhat do local and First Nations governments do?\n\nWhat are citizens rights and responsibilities in local and First Nations government?\n\nWhat do boards of education do?\n\nWhat do health boards do?\n\nWhat are the responsibilities of a leader?\n\nEach of the six topics is organized in a similar manner.\n\nTeacher Information  is intended for the teachers use. Each Teacher Information section includes:\n\nConcepts  are the big ideas addressed in each topic. Students are expected to know these main ideas when they have completed each topic.\n\nOverview  puts the material covered in the topic into context.\n\nCurriculum Connections  provides links to Saskatchewan curricula where ideas and themes relevant to local and First Nations government also addressed. These curricula may offer additional sources of information for the teacher.\n\nPossible Activities  consists of ideas for classroom activities that teachers can do with their students. A range of activities are provided so that teachers can select the ones most suitable for their students and their situation.\n\nStudent Backgrounder  provides students with basic information about various aspects of Canadian government. The Student Backgrounder may be photocopied and distributed to students as background information for each topic. Students should read this material and keep it for ongoing reference.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nUsing This Instructional Resource\n\nTeachers will use this instructional resource in different ways. You can:\n\nteach all topics in the resource in sequence\n\nteach only one or two topics that relate to current events in the community\n\nuse several learning activities that relate to current events in the community\n\nuse several learning activities for each topic you teach\n\nselect just a few learning activities for the topics you teach.\n\nThis resource is intended to complement, supplement and enrich the ongoing classroom program. Use the topics and learning activities that are appropriate for your students, your community and your instructional program.\n\nA section called For More Information appears at the end of this instructional resource. It includes websites where more information about the topics covered in the resource can be found. It also provides URLs for the full text of all legislation mentioned in this resource. All websites listed are suitable for both teacher and student use.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTeaching About First Nations Government\n\nMany Saskatchewan teachers have First Nations students in their classrooms. When teaching about First Nations government, ask questions and give assignments to all students in turn. Dont expect First Nations students to do all assignments relating to First Nations government, and dont expect them to have extensive personal knowledge of First Nations issues. Singling out First Nations students (or any other group of students) can make them feel uncomfortable.\n\nNote: This resource highlights First Nations governments and the major local government organizations that provide services to their communities. Although other groups may exist, they are not detailed here.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTopic 1: What Are the Types of Government in Canada?\n\nTeacher Information Concepts\n\nCanadians have organized themselves into different types of government to meet some of their needs.*\n\nEach type of government has specific responsibilities.\n\nOverview This topic sets the stage for the rest of the unit. It shows where each type of government fits into the total Canadian picture and provides background information for the topics that follow.

Edmonton, Alberta. Adapted with permission from Alberta Learning.\n\nPossible Activities\n\n1. Distribute the Student Backgrounder  What Are the Types of Government in Canada? Review it with students as necessary to check their understanding of key points. Ask questions like the following for each type of government, What is the head of the federal government called? What are some things the federal government does? Where is the headquarters of the government located?\n\n2. Ask students to complete a chart like the one below which contrasts and compares the types of Canadian Government.** They can use the information in the Student Backgrounder, library books and the Internet.\n\nFederal Provincial Urban and Rural Municipalities First Nations Board of Education Regional Health Authority Board Type of official head Name of legislative bodies Titles of representatives in legislative bodies Areas of responsibility\n\n** Activity #2 is adapted from Saskatchewan Grade Eight Social Studies Curriculum Guide, Saskatchewan Learning. Used with permission.\n\nBelow are some possible ways that information about the types of government can be categorized.\n\n3. Review with students the services that each type of government provides. Ask students to cut ads, announcements, etc. about community programs and services from the newspaper. Then ask students to categorize their clippings according to who provides the service. Some categories include federal government, provincial government, municipal government, First Nations government, private business, volunteer community. Ads can be displayed on a poster called Services We Need. For example:\n\nAn article about a new hospital would go under the heading Provincial Government, since health is a provincial responsibility.\n\nAn ad for wonderful meals offered by a local restaurant would go under Private Business.\n\nAn article about the RCMP would go under the heading Federal Government.\n\nAn article about housing on a First Nation would go under the heading First Nations Government.\n\nPlacing an article about the construction of a new school or development of a new educational program will be a challenge. Both the provincial government and local boards of education make decisions about education and contribute money to the school system. Where should an article about education go?\n\n4. Ask students, What are the local and First Nation government bodies that provide services to you and you families? The answer to this question might be different for each student. For example, a student who lives on a First Nation uses services provided by the First Nation. This student might drive on roads maintained by the rural municipality and on streets maintained by an urban municipality. Ask students to do this activity in groups of two or three.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nStudent Backgrounder\n\nWhat Are the Types of Government in Canada?\n\nCanada is a representative democracy. This means that power resides in the people of the country. We elect representatives to government bodies who speak on our behalf. In a democracy, government serves two important functions:\n\nGovernment provides services that people need for a good quality of life, for example, fire protection, police services, highways, health care, education, parks and recreation facilities.\n\nGovernment creates and enforces laws and guidelines that allow people to live together in harmony and safety.\n\nThere are four types of government in Canada: federal, provincial/territorial, local and First Nations. Also, in Saskatchewan, boards of education and health boards have responsibility for many aspects of education and health care.\n\nEach of these types of government is described below.\n\nFederal Government **\n\nThe responsibilities of the federal government were first defined in 1867 by the British North America Act, 1867.\n\nThe federal government is responsible for things that affect all of Canada. These include defense, foreign policy, citizenship, international trade, customs, immigration, the RCMP, the CBC, Canada Post, the Trans-Canada Highway, fisheries, First Nations affairs, national parks, the Canadian constitution, patents for inventors.\n\nThe headquarters of the federal government is in Ottawa at the Parliament Buildings.\n\nCanada has a system of parliamentary government. Parliament has three parts: the Queen, the House of Commons and the Senate.\n\nHer Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is our Head of State. The Governor General of Canada is the Queens representative in Canada.\n\nCanadians elect representatives to the House of Commons. The elected representatives are called Members of Parliament (MPs). The Prime Minister is the leader of the political party with the most elected Members of Parliament sitting in the House of Common.\n\nThe people who serve in the Senate are chosen by the Prime Minister and appointed by the Governor General. They are called Senators.\n\nThe people in each electoral district vote for a candidate of their choice. The candidate who receives the most votes becomes the MP for that electoral district. An elected MP represents everyone who lives in his or her electoral district, even the people who did not vote for the MP. An MP is the peoples link to the federal government. An MP helps by:\n\nRepresenting citizens interests when new laws are being considered.\n\nAsking questions about the government on behalf of its citizens.\n\nHelping individuals who need information from the government or who have problems with the government.\n\nPeople can vote in a federal election if they are:\n\nCanadian citizens\n\nat least 18 years of age.\n\nFederal Political Parties\n\nMost candidates in federal elections belong to a political party. A political party is a group of people who share ideas about how society should be organized and about the role that government should play in society. Some political parties have been around for a long time, but Canadians can and do create new political parties at any time.\n\nBefore an election, the members of a political party make plans for what they will do if their candidates are elected to form the government. The plans they make are called the party platform.\n\nMembers of political parties help to:\n\ndecide on the party platform\n\nchoose the party leader\n\nchoose the partys candidates\n\ncampaign for party candidates in elections.\n\nCandidates who do not belong to a political party are called independent candidates.\n\nOrganizing the Federal Government\n\nAfter a federal election, the party with the most elected representatives becomes the party in power, and forms a Government.\n\nThe leader of this party becomes the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister and the party in power run the Government as long as they have the support of the majority of MPs in the House of Commons.\n\nThe Prime Minister chooses several MPs to become cabinet ministers. Cabinet ministers are responsible for running federal government departments. The Prime Minister and cabinet ministers together are called the Cabinet and make important decisions about how to run the country. They also propose most new laws. Their decisions can be questioned by all MPs in the House of Commons.\n\nIf a majority of the MPs vote against an important Government decision, the party in power is defeated. The Prime Minister resigns and a new election is usually held.\n\nThe parties that are not in power are called the opposition parties. The opposition party with the most MPs is the Official Opposition. The opposition parties often have differing views from the party in power. They may have different ideas about the way that society should be organized, the role that government should play in society and the services that government should provide. They may challenge Government proposals or support them, depending on the situation.\n\n** Description of the federal government adapted from Saskatchewan Grade Eight Social Studies Curriculum Guide. Saskatchewan Learning, Regina, Saskatchewan. Used with permission.\n\nProvincial Government\n\nThe responsibilities of the provincial government are defined in Section 92 of the British North America Act, 1867. Provincial responsibilities include health care, hospitals, forestry, agriculture, tourism, environmental protection, provincial parks, provincial highways, social services, natural resources, licencing of shops, bars and taverns.\n\nIn some cases, the provincial government shares responsibility with other levels of government. For example, both the federal and provincial government have some responsibilities for agriculture. Both the provincial government and local government (boards of education) have responsibilities for education. Both contribute money for schools and teachers salaries and each makes decisions about certain aspects of education.\n\nThe headquarters of Saskatchewans provincial government is at the Legislative Building in Regina. Saskatchewans government has two parts: the Queen and the Legislative Assembly.\n\nThe Lieutenant Governor is the Queens representative in Saskatchewan.\n\nSaskatchewan people elect representatives to the Legislative Assembly. They are called Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). The Premier is the leader of the political party with the most elected members in the legislature.\n\nProvincial Elections\n\nThe provincial political process is quite similar to the federal process described previously.\n\nSaskatchewan is divided into constituencies. The people of each constituency elect one MLA who sits in the Legislative Assembly.\n\nMost candidates in a provincial election belong to a political party. Provincial political parties may be the same or different from federal political parties. Candidates who do not belong to a political party are called independents.\n\nAfter an election, the party with the most elected MLAs becomes the party in power, and forms a Government. The leader of this party becomes the Premier. MLAs who belong to other parties are called the Opposition.\n\nThe Government makes decisions about the role that Government will play in society, and about the programs and services it will provide to the public. The Government also proposes new laws. The Opposition may oppose or support Government proposals.\n\nIn order to vote in a Saskatchewan provincial election you must:\n\nbe a Canadian citizen\n\nbe at least 18 years old\n\nhave lived in Saskatchewan for at least six months before the election\n\nUrban municipalities are responsible for providing services to the people who live within their boundaries.\n\nThey provide fire protection and police services, maintain streets, roads, traffic lights, and the water and sewer system.\n\nThey organize garbage pick up and disposal; maintain city/town parks, skating rinks, curling rinks and recreation centres and public libraries.\n\nThey can pass bylaws relating to store hours, business licences, public safety, inspection of buildings and similar matters.\n\nMost urban municipalities also focus on the economic development of their community. Economic development includes a range of activities that:\n\nbring jobs to the community or keep existing jobs\n\nencourage businesses and industries to start up or relocate to the community\n\ntrain local people so they have the skills to work in businesses and industries.\n\nThe responsibilities of urban municipalities are specified in The Urban Municipality Act, 1984.\n\nThe Cities Act, 2003 was proclaimed in January 2003. Unlike other municipal acts, The Cities Act does not automatically apply to all cities in Saskatchewan. A city council must pass a resolution to bring a city under the Acts jurisdiction.\n\nUrban municipalities have a council that consists of a mayor and:\n\ntwo councillors (may be increased to four by bylaw) in villages and resort villages.\n\nsix councillors in towns and cities.\n\nAll urban councils can change the number of councillors to any even number, by passing a bylaw. In some urban municipalities the councillors are called aldermen.\n\nElections are held every three years.\n\nIn order to vote in an election in an urban municipality, you must be:\n\n18 years old\n\na Canadian citizen\n\nand either:\n\na resident of the municipality for at least three months and a resident of Saskatchewan for at least six months\n\nor\n\nthe owner of assessable land located in the municipality for at least three months and a resident of Saskatchewan for at least six months.\n\nIn Saskatchewan, the candidates in municipal elections dont usually align themselves with federal or provincial political parties, but occasionally a few candidates will identify themselves as a group with common beliefs and give themselves a name.\n\nMost council meetings are open to the public. Anyone can come to observe meetings, and groups or individuals can make presentations to mayor and council on various issues. In the cities, council meetings are usually televised.\n\nRural Municipalities\n\nRural municipalities (RMs) cover rural areas of southern and central Saskatchewan. Many of the people who live in rural municipalities live on farms. Sometimes in rural municipalities that are near cities, the land will be divided into lots or acreages. Most people who live on these small parcels of land drive into the city for work.\n\nThe rural municipality is responsible for making decisions about matters of local concern. A rural municipalitys responsibilities include:\n\nproviding fire protection\n\nmaintaining streets and roads within its boundaries (except for provincial highways)\n\npassing bylaws concerning traffic control and safety\n\nlicensing businesses that operate in the municipality\n\ncontrolling stray animals\n\nmaking regulations for public safety.\n\nRural municipalities, like urban municipalities, also emphasize economic development. They often undertake activities to improve the economic well-being of people who live in the community.\n\nThe responsibilities of rural municipalities are defined in The Rural Municipality Act, 1989.\n\nThe government of a rural municipality consists of a reeve (head) and councillors. Each rural municipality is given a number. In even-numbered years, elections are held for all reeves and for the councillors of odd-numbered municipalities. In odd-numbered years, elections are held for councillors of even-numbered municipalities. The term office in a rural municipality is two years.\n\nIn order to vote in an election in a rural municipality, a person must:\n\nbe at least 18 years old\n\nhave lived in the RM for at least six months.\n\nIn some circumstances, people (and their spouses) who own land in the RM but do not live there are also eligible to vote.\n\nPeople who run in elections in rural municipalities usually do not affiliate themselves with a political party. They run as individuals and base their election platform on local issues.\n\nRural municipalities cover the central and southern part of Saskatchewan. Residents of northern communities may petition the provincial government to become northern hamlets, villages or towns if they meet certain requirements.\n\nFirst Nations\n\nThere are 74 First Nations in Saskatchewan. The members of each First Nation are Registered Indians as defined by the Indian Act. A chief and council govern each First Nation. They are elected by the members of the First Nation. In Saskatchewan, there are approximately 500 elected chiefs and councillors, of whom approximately 18 percent are women.\n\nThe responsibilities of a chief and council on a First Nation are broader than those of the councils of urban and rural municipalities.\n\nThe chief and council are responsible for all aspects of First Nation life. They look after housing, education and, sometimes, social services in addition to all the services that an urban and rural municipality is responsible for. Their job also includes economic development  creating jobs, promoting business and generally improving the economic well-being of the people living on the First Nation.\n\nThe chief and council of a First Nation deal with federal and provincial governments concerning governance matters, treaty rights and economic development. Thus, their mandate includes responsibilities that link them to other types of government.\n\nThe chief and council of a First Nation were not always elected as they are today. Traditionally, Saskatchewans First Nations had hereditary chiefs. Usually the firstborn son of a chief was trained from childhood in the duties and responsibilities of chief. A new chief took office when his father died and was usually middle-aged or even elderly when he assumed the responsibility. Thus, he brought a lot of training and experience to the job.\n\nBoards of Education\n\nIn urban and rural municipalities, boards of education are responsible for delivering the educational program.\n\nThere are two types of school divisions in Saskatchewan  public school divisions and separate school divisions. Separate school divisions are the responsibility of the religious minority in the area (usually the religious minority is Catholic). In addition, there is one francophone school board in Saskatchewan. It is called the conseil scolaire.\n\nEach school division is governed by an elected board of education. Boards of education are sometimes called school boards. The members of the board of education are called school trustees. The head of the board of education is called the chairperson.\n\nBoth the provincial government and the local board of education make decisions about education. For example, the provincial government decides on the curriculum that is to be used. The local board of education is responsible for delivering the educational program, hiring teachers, deciding on the number of schools, where the schools are to be located, and organizing school transportation.\n\nBoards of education also make some decisions about what will be taught. They are required to offer the basic subjects specified in the program of studies, but they can offer additional subjects if they wish. Under some circumstances, locally developed courses can be offered in the schools.\n\nSchool division elections are held every three years.\n\nIn order to vote in a school division election you must be:\n\n18 years of age\n\na Canadian citizen\n\na resident of the school division for at least three months and a resident of Saskatchewan for at least six months.\n\nCandidates for the position of school trustee do not usually affiliate themselves with political parties. Usually each person runs as an individual and presents his or her own election platform on local educational issues and concerns.\n\nRegional Health Authority Boards\n\nSaskatchewan is divided into 12 health regions. A regional health authority board has been appointed by the provincial government to plan, coordinate and oversee the delivery of health services in each region. The regional health authority boards are usually just called health boards. Each regional health authority board has 12 members. These people are simply called members of the health board. The head of the health board is called the chairperson.\n\nThe regional health authority boards are responsible for planning, organizing, delivering and evaluating health services within their boundaries. Although the members of the boards are appointed by the provincial government, citizens can influence decisions made by regional health authority boards. The meetings are open to the public and anyone can come and observe the meetings. Media representatives often attend these meetings and prepare reports for the local newspaper or TV station. Individual citizens or groups of citizens can make presentations to the board about issues that concern them. Also the regional health authority boards are required by law to set up community advisory networks to give them advice.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTopic 2: What Do Local and First Nations Governments Do?\n\nTeacher Information Concepts\n\nLocal and First Nations governments provide services that people need.\n\nLocal and First Nations governments make decisions that affect the local community.\n\nThe decisions made by local and First Nations governments affect each person in the community.\n\nOverview This topic emphasizes that local and First Nations governments provide services that people need and pass bylaws to keep people safe. It describes the processes that local and First Nation governments use to make decisions and the source of local and First Nations government funds. Curriculum Connections\n\nFor additional information about the mill rate go to:\n\nBusiness Education, A Curriculum Guide for the Secondary Level:\n\nModule 5, Payroll and Taxation: Instructional Note 3.\n\nPossible Activities\n\n1. Distribute the Student Backgrounder  What Do Local and First Nations Governments Do? Review it with students as necessary to check their understanding. Ask questions like, What are some services a rural municipality provides to its citizens? What process does the chief and council of a First Nation use to make decisions?\n\n2. Have students simulate a local government meeting by debating a local issue (real or hypothetical) and passing a motion. Real issues can be those that the local municipality or First Nation is presently addressing. Hypothetical issues might include:\n\nUsing pesticides to control weeds in local parks. Some people support this idea and some are opposed.\n\nPassing a bylaw that prohibits loud noise after 10:00 p.m.\n\nSpending money on new road/street signs.\n\nDo appropriate research beforehand and follow parliamentary procedure during the meeting.*\n\nEnsure that all students have a role during the activity. One can be mayor/chief/reeve. Some can be councillors. A couple of students can be local government officials who are keeping notes. Two or three can be media reporters who are observing the meeting, making notes and taking photographs. The rest can divide up into groups of two to six and represent interest groups that make presentations to council.\n\n3. Analyze a local government decision (real or hypothetical). How will it affect various groups of people in the community? For example, how will it affect children, teen-agers, parents, seniors? How will it affect business owners, homeowners, renters? Will it raise or lower taxes, increase or decrease services? *\n\n4. Visit city hall, RM office, band office, etc. Meet with mayor/chief/reeve, one or more councillors, one or more senior administrators. Ask each person detailed questions about what they do. For example, students might ask questions about:\n\nThe work the official does during council meetings.\n\nReading and research the official does to prepare for meetings.\n\nHow the official collects information about the publics opinions.\n\nWhat the official considers his/her most important responsibilities to be.\n\nWho the official is responsible to for the decisions s/he makes.\n\nWho (if anybody) reports to the official.\n\nThen have students write a job description for each of these people. *\n\n5. Observe a meeting of town/city/RM/band council. (These are open to the public and are televised in several cities) What were the issues discussed? What were the various positions on each issue? How was the issue decided? If you were making a decision about each of the issues discussed at the meeting, what would you decide? Why? How would your decision affect various groups of people in the community  in the short-term? In the long-term?\n\n6. Introduce the concept of mill rate. Rural and urban municipalities set a mill rate each year (number of dollars of tax for each $1,000 of assessed property value). (First Nations dont have the power to tax.) Find out what the mill rate is in your municipality. Assume that next year the mill rate goes up and taxes increase. What will this mean for property owners, for people who use services like the fire department, streets, roads, garbage collection, libraries? If the mill rate goes down, what would the decrease mean for each of these groups of people?\n\n7. First Nations governments do not tax. They receive an allocation of money from the federal government. The allocation is based primarily on the size of the population. The chief and council must decide how this allocation will be used. If more money is spent on one service, then less must be spent on other services. Have students assume the role of chief and council of a First Nation. Several interest groups are lobbying for expansion of various community services. There isnt enough money to respond to all these requests. How do you decide on services to be provided, services to be reduced? What research do you do? Who do you talk to?\n\n8. Debate (or write a position paper on) the following topic: Lowering local taxes is always a good thing.\n\n9. Organize students into groups of three or four. They are to pretend they are subcommittees of council. Each subcommittee is to research all the actual costs associated with a particular real or hypothetical service and prepare a yearly budget for the service. For example, the committee researching the fire department would need to find out the costs of trucks (amortized over several years), the cost of gas and truck maintenance, salaries and benefits, the cost of maintaining a fire hall, etc.\n\n* Activities 2, 3 and 4 have been adapted from Teaching About Local Government in Alberta, pages 75, 92, 153-155, by Alberta Education and Alberta Municipal Affairs. 1999. Edmonton, Alberta. Adapted with permission from Alberta Learning.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nStudent Backgrounder\n\nWhat Do Local and First Nations Governments Do?\n\nLocal and First Nations governments are the governments that are closest to the people. The representatives of these types of governments live in your community; you probably see them downtown and at community functions. Meetings are held in the local area, so it is easier to attend as an observer or to make a presentation to a local government body.\n\nbringing jobs to the community or keeping existing jobs\n\nencouraging businesses and industries to start up or relocate to the community\n\ntraining local people so they have the skills needed to work in businesses and industry or to start their own businesses.\n\nPlanning for Services\n\nLocal and First Nations governments make decisions carefully and try to get input from the public. Individual councillors often ask people what they think about a particular issue. Individuals or groups sometimes make presentations or write to mayor and council (or chief and council) on specific issues.\n\nIf an issue is technical in nature, council often gets advice from an engineer or other specialist. This would be the case, for example, if council was considering upgrading a water treatment plant or renovating a large building.\n\nSometimes public opinion is deeply divided on an issue. For example, one group of people might strongly support a bylaw that forbids use of pesticides on lawns; another group of people might be vehemently opposed to such a bylaw. One group of people might want a new park created in a particular area of the community, another group might be strongly opposed because they think it will cause noise and traffic. In these situations, it is very difficult for council to make a decision that pleases everyone.\n\nThe mayor/reeve/chief and council discuss issues among themselves at meetings. Sometimes they all agree on how a particular matter is to be handled, but sometimes there is disagreement and lots of debate. When there is disagreement, council sometimes seeks a compromise that both sides can accept, but other times there is a vote and losers of the vote are expected to accept the decision graciously.\n\nThe mayor/reeve/chief and council make decisions through motions or resolutions. For example, one member of council might say, I move we accept the budget proposed for next year.\n\nThe procedures after a motion is made vary. Urban municipalities, rural municipalities and First Nations may all have slightly different processes. The process may be different for different types of motions. However, in all situations, there is opportunity for discussion and a vote is held.\n\nIn urban and rural municipalities, council is rarely responsible for implementing their decisions on a day-to-day basis. Most communities have hired staff who implement the decisions that council makes. This chief of staff is as follows:\n\nTowns  town administrator\n\nVillages  village clerk\n\nRural municipalities  RM administrator\n\nCities  city manager.\n\nLarge First Nations usually have a band manager or chief of operations. Decisions made by chief and council are passed to this person for day-to-day implementation. Some small First Nations do not have a paid band manager. In these communities, the chief and council become responsible for actual implementation of the decisions they make.\n\nPaying for Services\n\nUrban and Rural Municipalities\n\nIn order to pay for the services they offer to citizens, rural and urban municipalities tax property located within their boundaries.\n\nTaxation has three components:\n\nassessment of property,\n\nplanning for services to be provided each year, and\n\nsetting a mill rate in order to raise money to pay for the services.\n\nTaxation starts with assessment. Residential and business property are appraised and given an assessed value which reflects what the property would sell for. Farmland is assessed according to typical market value for land of known productivity. Productivity means the amount of wheat that can be produced or the number of cattle supported. Property is reassessed every four years.\n\nOnce the mayor/reeve and council have consulted with the community and decided on the services to be provided, they figure out how much this package of services will cost. The next step is to figure out the amount of taxes each property owner must contribute so that the municipality will have enough money to provide the services. This involves setting a mill rate.\n\nThe mill rate is the number of dollars of tax for each one thousand dollars of property value. For example, a mill rate of 10 means that $10 of taxes will be collected for every $1,000 of the assessed value of a property. A mill rate of 25 means that $25 of taxes will be collected for every $1,000 of the assessed value of property.\n\nFor example, if the assessed value of a piece of property is $50,000 and the mill rate is 10, the taxes will be $500. If the assessed value of a house and lot is $90,000 and the mill rate is 25, the property taxes will be $2,250.\n\nOften the mayor/reeve and council consider the services to be provided and the mill rate at the same time. If citizens consider a service really important, they are often willing to pay more tax. If citizens say that the mill rate (and thus the amount of tax they pay) is too high, then mayor/reeve and council ask them which services should be reduced or cut in order to keep taxes low.\n\nFirst Nations\n\nFirst Nations have the power to set up regimes to levy property taxes. To date, they have chosen not to exercise this power. They receive funding allocations from the federal government. This is because the 1867 British North America Act (BNA Act), which created Canada as an independent country, passed responsibility for First Nations people, including Aboriginal rights, from the British to the Canadian federal government.\n\nFirst Nations also receive federal funding because of treaty rights. The term treaty rights refers to those guarantees explicitly and implicitly agreed upon through the treaty process. Under the terms of the treaties, First Nations peoples agreed to share the land in return for specific rights. The leaders who signed the treaties noted that they were not signing the treaty for themselves but, rather, for the children of future generations. The treaties are like contracts in which both sides commit to certain obligations. Aboriginal and treaty rights of First Nations peoples received recognition under the Canadian Constitution in Section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.\n\nThe amount of money that a First Nation receives in its allocation depends mostly on its population. The allocation of money that a First Nation receives is broken down into categories: housing, education, etc.\n\nThe chief and council get input from the community about priorities. As in every other community, there may be differences of opinion about needed services.\n\nBecause chief and council have a set amount of money to work with, expenditures in one area may mean reductions in another. For example, they will need to decide which houses are most in need of painting and which can wait until next year.\n\nIf they decide that a summer soccer program is the highest priority to keep kids busy during the summer months, there may be less money for the winter hockey program.\n\nBecause the allocation they receive from the federal government is fixed, some First Nations are looking at additional ways of raising revenue to pay for needed services. For example, some have started businesses of various types that are owned by the First Nation.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTopic 3: What are Citizens' Rights and Responsibilities in Local Government?\n\nTeacher Information Concepts\n\nLocal and First Nations governments represent the people of the community.\n\nIndividuals have a responsibility to participate in local and First Nations democratic processes.\n\nIndividuals and groups can influence the decisions made by local and First Nations government.\n\nOverview This topic emphasizes that local and First Nations governments represent the people of the community. Citizen participation is the foundation upon which local and First Nations governments are based.\n\nPossible Activities\n\nThe activities below are grouped into two categories: basic activities and additional election year activities.\n\nBasic Activities\n\n1. Distribute the Student Backgrounder  What Are Citizens Rights and Responsibilities in Local and First Nations Government? Review it with students as necessary to check their understanding of key points.\n\n2. Plan a campaign to influence local or First Nations government on a real or hypothetical issue. Have students plan a presentation to their local municipal council, First Nations chief and council, or city/town/village council. Students can choose an issue that concerns them, or one that is currently under discussion by council. As part of their preparation have students observe other delegations to council  in person or on TV (in larger communities). Ask students to make lists of behaviours that make a good impression on council and behaviours that make a bad impression. Encourage students to include the effective behaviours in their presentation. Make arrangements for students to deliver their presentation to council, to a service club or a group of parents.\n\n3. Soon you will be able to vote. Imagine that a candidate for mayor/chief/reeve comes to your door. What questions would you ask the person about her/his position on services, bylaws, taxes?\n\n4. Debate (or write a position paper on) this topic  People who dont vote in local elections shouldnt complain about that governments decisions. As part of the research for this debate, find out the percentage of people who voted in the last municipal or First Nations election.\n\n5. Imagine that you are running for mayor/chief/reeve. You are planning your election platform. What issues will you focus on? Why? What would your position be on each of the issues? Why? How would your platform affect various groups in the community? Write a speech that you could give at a community meeting. Prepare a written brochure or a script for a TV ad to support your campaign.\n\nAdditional Election Year Activities\n\n6. Select one candidate who is running for mayor/chief/reeve/councillor. Find out what that candidates position is on the issues (by watching the media, interviewing the candidate, and attending public meetings). Track the candidates campaign. What meetings does the candidate attend? What advertising does the candidate publish? Does the candidate put any ads on radio or TV? How does the candidate fare in the election?\n\n7. Select one controversial issue in the election. Why is this issue controversial? Who does the issue affect? Find out what each candidates position on the issue is. How is this issue decided in the election?\n\n8. Organize an all-candidates forum at the school. Refer to Activity #10 (page 28) in the next section for more information about the process of organizing an all-candidates forum.\n\n9. After the election find out:\n\nWho won the election? By what percentage of votes?\n\nWhat are the winners positions on important issues?\n\nTable of Contents\n\nStudent Backgrounder\n\nWhat Are Citizens Rights and Responsibilities in Local and First Nations Government?\n\nCanada is a democracy that depends on its citizens to ensure that governments at all levels reflect the wishes of the people.\n\nThe rights and responsibilities of citizens in a democracy are described below. These rights and responsibilities apply to local and First Nations governments as well as to federal and provincial government.\n\nCitizens are expected:\n\nTo be informed about the issues  Citizens have a responsibility to be sure they are informed about the issues their local or First Nation government is dealing with. They can do this by talking to local or First Nations government representatives, reading the newspaper, watching TV, and attending local government meetings as an observer. Most local and First Nations government meetings are open to the public. When an issue is controversial, citizens have a responsibility to get information about both sides before making up their mind.\n\nTo vote  Canada is a representative democracy which means that we elect people who make decisions on our behalf. Voting is the basic foundation of democracy. Everyone has both a right and a responsibility to vote for the candidate(s) they feel will best represent their point of view in government.\n\nTo express their opinion to local and First Nations government leaders  Local and First Nations government leaders try to provide services that meet the needs of the community. As a citizen, you have a responsibility to tell your elected representatives what services you need and how well existing services are working for you. You also have a responsibility to express your opinion on controversial issues. There are lots of ways to make your opinions known. You can write or phone the mayor/chief/reeve and councillors. You can make a presentation at a council meeting. You can write letters to the editor or phone a radio talk show. In smaller communities, you may meet local government representatives informally in stores and restaurants and have opportunities to talk casually with them.\n\nTo run for local government office  In order for democracy to work, citizens must be willing to run for mayor/reeve/chief and council. When you run for office you decide on a platform  your statement of what you believe the issues to be and of the action you will take regarding each issue. You let everyone in the community know you are running and mount a campaign to tell them why they should vote for you.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTopic 4: What Do Boards of Education Do?\n\nTeacher Information Concepts Boards of education govern the operation of schools within their boundaries. Overview This topic describes the types of decisions that boards of education make about the schools within their boundaries and describes how schools are funded. Curriculum Connections None\n\nPossible Activities\n\nBasic Activities\n\n1.Distribute the Student Backgrounder  What Do Boards of Education Do? Review it with students as necessary to check their understanding of key points.\n\n2. Introduce the concept of boards of education, their roles and responsibilities. Distinguish between provincial responsibilities and local responsibilities for education. Emphasize that public and separate boards of education have the right to tax to raise money to support schools. (First Nations education councils do not tax. Although First Nations have the authority to tax, to date they have chosen not to do so.) First Nations receive an allocation of money from the federal government. This allocation is provided because of the terms of the Canadian Constitution and is a component of treaty rights.\n\n3. Describe the three types of boards of education: public, separate and First Nations-controlled (sometimes called an education council). Public and separate boards of education may have overlapping boundaries. On a map, locate boundaries of the boards of education in your area of the province. Ensure that students know the kind of board responsible for their school.\n\n4. What is one decision recently made by the board of education responsible for your school? Get as much information about this decision as possible. What were the circumstances leading up to the decision? Then consider how this decision might affect students at various grade levels, teachers, school bus drivers, parents, taxpayers, other groups in the community.\n\n5. Assume that you are a school trustee. A group of parents and sports enthusiasts is lobbying the board to build a new school gym. This would mean a significant increase in school taxes. A group of property owners is lobbying you just as hard to keep taxes stable or even to lower taxes. How do you decide? What research will you do? Who will you talk to? No matter what you decide somebodys going to be unhappy, what do you do then?\n\n6. Assume you are a member of an education council on a First Nation. The allocation of money you receive for education is fixed and will not be changed. A group of community members is lobbying you hard to start a traditional dance program, so that students can perform throughout the region. This would mean purchasing costumes and drums, paying for dance instructors, paying for additional transportation, etc. If you start the dance program you will have to spend less money in some other area of the educational program. What do you do?\n\n7. Soon you will be old enough to vote. Imagine that a candidate for a board of education election comes to your door. What questions would you ask the person about the school program, school facilities, busing, taxes?\n\n8. Simulate a board of education meeting by debating a local educational issue (real or hypothetical) and passing a motion about the issue. Do appropriate research beforehand and follow parliamentary procedure during the meeting.\n\n9. Ask a school trustee to visit the class. The trustee can talk about:\n\nThe most important decisions the board of education has made this year.\n\nHow s/he makes decisions about controversial issues.\n\nThe satisfaction and challenges of being a school trustee.\n\nAdditional Election Year Activities\n\n10. Have students organize an all-candidates forum in your school. Invite everyone who is running for the board of education to attend and present their election platform. Ask someone who is respected in the community to chair the forum. This might be the school principal, the mayor, a local businessperson who is known to be fair and impartial. Ensure that all high school students attend the forum and invite parents and the public.\n\nTo ensure maximum student learning from this event:\n\nSet up a student publicity committee. This committees job is to publicize the forum throughout the community. Students must plan and implement the publicity campaign.\n\nHave each student identify at least one question they would like to ask the candidates. All students wont be able to speak during the forum. Therefore, in each class, pool the questions and select the two or three questions that were identified most frequently. Appoint one or two students to ask questions on behalf of the class during the forum.\n\nAfter the forum, assign students to write thank you letters to the candidates, and articles for the school newsletter.\n\nAfter the forum, ask each student to write a summary of at least one candidates platform. Students who are very interested can summarize all the candidates positions.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nStudent Backgrounder\n\nWhat Do Boards of Education Do?\n\nSchool Divisions\n\nIn Saskatchewan, responsibility for education is shared between the provincial government and boards of education that are elected to manage education in each school division. (Boards of education are sometimes called school boards.) For example, the provincial government establishes the curriculum and boards of education are responsible for its delivery in the school division. The Education Act 1995 (Section 85) lists the duties of boards of education.\n\nBoards of education provide educational leadership within their own communities. Together, all the boards of education in Saskatchewan play a major role in shaping the present and future direction of education in this province.\n\nBoards of education are responsible for ensuring that every student receives an appropriate education. The board of education is responsible for approving the program of studies and ensuring that resources are available to support the learning program. The resources needed for education include:\n\nteachers, principals and other staff\n\nbooks, videos, computer software and other learning resources\n\ncomputer, sports and science equipment\n\nschool facilities including the school building itself, desks and other furniture.\n\nThe board of education also organizes transportation, so that students can attend school.\n\nBoards of education face many challenges:\n\nCommunity members may have widely differing opinions about what a good education is.\n\nBoards try to raise student achievement and at the same time keep costs reasonable.\n\nThe amount of money available for education is limited and possible expenditures often exceed the available funds. Therefore, the board has to make decisions about the best ways to spend the money they have.\n\nBoards of education usually gather public opinion and get factual information before they make decisions. For example:\n\nIndividuals and groups sometimes make presentations to the board on issues that are important to them. The board listens, asks questions and reads any background information provided.\n\nThe board may do a survey or hold public meetings when an issue is controversial or affects the entire community.\n\nBoards may consult with the director of education, school principals and teachers to get factual information or opinion. For example, they may ask the director of education to prepare a report on how other school divisions have handled particular issues.\n\nIf the issue being discussed is technical in nature, the board may ask for advice from a specialist. For example, if they are discussing repairs to the plumbing or electrical wiring of a school or the purchase of a new computer system, the board may ask for advice from engineers or other technical experts.\n\nRural boards of education may ask for advice from district boards of trustees. Many rural school divisions include several communities and cover a large geographic area. Within most rural school divisions, there are smaller school districts. Each school district represents a separate community or a small geographic area. Each school district has an elected district board of trustees. The role of these district boards of trustees is primarily advisory. They may advise the board of education on matters like staffing, budgets and programs.\n\nCity boards of education may ask for advice from local school advisory committees. Urban school divisions do not have smaller school districts or district boards of trustees. In cities, a local school advisory committee made up of parents and community members advise the board of education. Usually each school has a separate local school advisory committee. These committees may be appointed or elected, depending on the school.\n\nAfter the board of education has made a decision, responsibility for implementing the decision is passed to the director of education, principals, teachers and other staff. Most boards of education have limited involvement in the day-to-day operations of the school division.\n\nBoards of education raise money to pay for the educational programs in the school division by levying a property tax on the property within their boundaries.\n\nEach year, the board of education decides on the educational priorities for the next year. A lot of public consultation usually occurs before final decisions about educational priorities and programs are made.\n\nWhen the educational priorities and program for the year have been established, school division staff figure out how much the program will cost, then a mill rate is set to raise the money to pay for the program. The mill rate is the number of dollars of tax for each one thousand dollars of property value. For example, a mill rate of 12 means that $12 of taxes will be collected for every $1,000 of the assessed value of property. A mill rate of 30 means that $30 of taxes will be collected for every $1,000 of the assessed value of property.\n\nSometimes the local board of education considers educational priorities and the mill rate at the same time. If an educational service or program is very important to the community, then citizens may be willing to pay more taxes. If citizens say that the proposed mill rate (and thus the amount of tax they pay) is too high, then the board of education will ask citizens to suggest how programs can be changed in order to lower the mill rate.\n\nOnce the school mill rate is set, the urban or rural municipality collects the school tax on behalf of the board of education when it collects municipal taxes. Each taxpayer gets one local tax bill.\n\nFirst Nations\n\nEach First Nation has an education committee. The education committee is sometimes called the board of education depending on local preference. The education committee may be elected by the people of the First Nation or appointed by the chief and council.\n\nThe education committee is responsible for ensuring that students from Kindergarten to Grade 12 who live on the First Nation receive an appropriate education. They also look after post-secondary education for all their members, including the members who do not live on the First Nation. They make decisions about education for their First Nation. First Nations education committees face many of the same challenges as boards of education. People have different opinions about what a good education is. The money available for education is limited so they must decide on the best uses for the money they have.\n\nIn Saskatchewan, First Nations receive an allocation of money from the federal government for education, because First Nations people are a federal responsibility and because of treaty rights. The treaties are like contracts in which both sides commit to specific obligations and responsibilities. The amount of the allocation depends mostly on the number of students to be educated.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTopic 5: What Do Health Boards Do?\n\nTeacher Information Concepts\n\nHealth boards make decisions about health services for their region.\n\nHealth boards must decide how the resources available to them will be used for maximum benefit to the community.\n\nOverview This topic describes what health boards are and what they do. It emphasizes that health boards must sometimes make difficult decisions. Curriculum Connections\n\nFor more information about:\n\nAccessing health care information and learning about health care services go to:\n\nLife Transitions 20, 30: 30-Level Required Modules, Health Self-Care\n\nPossible Activities\n\n1. Distribute the Student Backgrounder  What Do Health Boards Do? Review it with students to check their understanding of key points.\n\n2. Have students contact the local health region office or use the Internet to find out:\n\nthe name of the health region they live in\n\nthe geographic boundaries of their health region\n\nthe names of some of the hospitals, nursing homes, etc. in the health region where they live\n\nthe names of the members of the health region board and the CEO of the health region.\n\n3. Have students simulate a health board meeting. The board is discussing whether to set up a hemodialysis unit at the local hospital. This would mean a large expenditure of money, but it would also mean that people who need hemodialysis can get their treatment closer to home. Ask students to research hemodialysis  What is it? Who needs it? What staff and equipment are needed? How much would a hemodialysis unit cost to set up? What would be the yearly cost? Students can interview local health professionals and use the Internet to get information.\n\nDuring the simulated health board meeting, 11 or 12 students can be health region board members. One can act as the health region CEO. Others can make presentations to the board, for and against creation of the hemodialysis unit. One or two students can be newspaper and TV reporters who observe the meeting and take notes and photographs.\n\nWhat factors do students have to consider when they make a decision? No matter what decision they make, they cant please everyone. Some people will be unhappy. How do they cope with this?\n\nThis same simulation process can be used to explore many other potential decisions. Some ideas include:\n\nShould the board expand mental health programs or diabetes programs? Should it buy CT scanning or MRI equipment?\n\nThe health board has only a certain amount of money. How should they use the money available?\n\nShould they focus on a stop-smoking program or an AIDS prevention program?\n\nShould they expand the hemodialysis program or spend more money to prevent Fetal Alcohol Syndrome?\n\nShould they keep a specific costly hospital or service even if it means cutting other health services in the community?\n\n4. Have students get information about some of the big decisions the local health board is facing right now. This can be done by interviewing board members or by inviting a board member to speak to the class. Then create a simulation based on a real-life, local health issue. As part of their research, students can interview local people, gather local statistics, collect news articles and letters to the editor from the local newspaper.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nStudent Backgrounder\n\nWhat Do Health Boards Do?\n\nIn Saskatchewan, 12 Regional Health Authorities (RHAs) plan, coordinate, oversee and deliver health services. The 12-person board of each Regional Heath Authority is appointed by the provincial government.\n\nThe members of the health boards are representative of the communities they serve. The membership includes a balance of young and old people, and people from all over the region. The responsibilities of the health boards are defined in The Regional Health Services Act, 2002 (Section 27).\n\nIn general, health boards are responsible for planning, organizing, delivering and evaluating health services in their region. This means that they are responsible for hospitals, ambulance services, home care for seniors and people with disabilities, long-term care for seniors and well baby clinics where babies get their shots. They are also responsible for programs that prevent illness like stop-smoking programs and diabetes prevention programs.\n\nHealth boards are decision-making bodies. They are responsible to the public and to the provincial government for the decisions they make. Health boards have limited involvement in the day-to-day operation of the health region. Once they make a decision they pass that decision to their chief executive officer (CEO) for implementation. The board and the CEO are a team. The CEO implements the boards decisions, and also advises the board on technical, medical and administrative issues. The CEO works with the doctors, nurses, health educators, technicians and other professionals employed by the health region to deliver quality health care.\n\nThe meetings of the health board are open to the public  anyone can come to observe. Reporters often attend these meetings and information about the boards decisions may appear in the newspaper, on radio or TV. Members of the public can make presentations to the board about issues that are important to them.\n\nThere is also a more formal mechanism for getting community input. The legislation requires that every health board set up at least one community advisory network to provide advice to the health board about health services. The structure of these community advisory networks varies from one health region to another, but all are comprised of community volunteers.\n\nHealth boards do not have the authority to levy taxes. Funds for health services are provided by the provincial government. Because the funds health boards receive are limited, board members sometimes have to choose how these funds will be used. Will they have two small hospitals or one big one? Will they put a lot of money into programs to prevent smoking, diabetes or obesity, or will they focus on the Emergency Department? Community members may have different opinions about matters like these, so the health boards job is sometimes difficult.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTopic 6: What Are the Responsibilities of a Leader?\n\nTeacher Information Concepts\n\nLeaders have specific jobs to do (go to local government meetings, make decisions, etc.).\n\nLeaders have responsibilities to the community (to consider everyones interests, to lead by example, etc.).\n\nOverview This topic emphasizes that leaders have certain responsibilities and obligations, and fulfill many roles.

Informal leaders are people who lead and influence others simply because of who they are. They may be known as someone who lives an outstanding life, is very fair, works hard, contributes a great deal to the community, has a charismatic personality.\n\nFormal leaders are people who are leaders because of the position they hold. In a community, the mayor or the chief are leaders because they have been elected to the position of leader. In an office, the executive director is a leader because s/he has been hired for that job.\n\nLocal and First Nations government leaders lead in another way. They represent the people of the community and have the legal authority to make decisions on behalf of the community. Their positions give them the right to make certain decisions and to take the actions necessary to implement those decisions.\n\nadvocates for the members of the community.\n\nlisteners to the people of the community.\n\ngoal setters for the local or First Nations government.\n\nplanners who make step-by-step plans, assign resources and set timelines to achieve goals.\n\nevaluators who determine if goals are being met.\n\nfinancial planners who make decisions about budget.\n\npolicy makers who make policies to guide administrators.\n\nlegislators who pass bylaws and resolutions.\n\ncommunicators who share information with the community.\n\nadjudicators who listen to people who feel they have not been treated fairly.\n\nlobbyists who communicate with all levels of government.***\n\n*** Description of roles played by local and First Nations government officials adapted from Teaching About Local Government in Alberta: School Boards, pages 72-77, by Alberta Learning and Alberta School Boards Association. 2000.
