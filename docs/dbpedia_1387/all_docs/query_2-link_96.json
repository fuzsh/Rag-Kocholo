        "text": "WENZEL, HARRY JR., 86, passed away on Sunday, June 20, 2021, at home in Coventry RI, by the side of his beloved wife of 62 years, Betty (Hancock) Wenzel.\n\nBorn in Hackensack, New Jersey, Harry was the son of the late Harry and Mary (Embrich) Wenzel.\n\nHarry graduated from Lodi High School, and attended Seton Hall University. He served his country in the United States Army in Staten, Germany during the Korean War. Harry worked as an IRS International Examiner for thirty years before retiring.\n\nHe was the loving father of Michael Wenzel, his wife Christine, and Jill Troiani. He was the most dedicated Pop Pop of Lauren and Olivia Troiani. Harry is also survived by several nieces, nephews, and cousins.\n\nFormerly of Pequannock, New Jersey, Harry was an avid golfer and enjoyed watching the N.Y. Mets and Giants. He was always involved in the interests of his children, as a baseball coach, Cub Scout leader, bowling teammate, and number one fan, cheering on the sidelines of every gymnastics meet and field hockey game.\n\nHarry’s wishes were to forgo any formal services for a more intimate gathering of his immediate family for a celebration of his life at a later date. His family appreciates the kind words and condolences received from all who have reached out. Harry’s interment at the Rhode Island Veteran’s Memorial Cemetery, Exeter, is private. In lieu of flowers, contributions to the American Cancer Society are appreciated."
