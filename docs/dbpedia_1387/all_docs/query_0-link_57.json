To be included in that group of people--and I knew all of them--is an honor. I really appreciate that,\" said Myron (Mike) Peltz in response to his selection as the grand marshal for the 2005 NauticalCity parade. Mike Peltz has built a life around helping others, beginning in the early days of the local bowling alley where he was paid $1.50 a night to set pins, keep score or sit in the foul line box. Much of his life has been doing service for people either in jobs he has had or the many organizations he has given his time to over the years.\n\nFollowing graduation from high school in 1949, he continued working at his father's hardware store in what is now the Hiedemann building on South Third Street. Father Emil, a prominent state representative,who served the area from 1944 until his death at age 58 in 1960, had sons Wally and Mike to run the store while he served in Lansing. \"He would have gone a long ways in state government had he lived longer. When he died he was pretty powerful down there. He served as chairman of the roads and bridges committee, and the conservation committee,\" he said.\n\nWithout the influence of Rep. Emil Peltz, the MackinawBridge might never have been built. \"The bridge was a done deal. It was gone. There wasn't going to be a bridge and he somehow, as politics goes, \"blackmailed\" the other side, politically. Even the people who wanted to build the bridge couldn't believe that he saved the bridge,\" Mike said. BELIEVING THE draft was inevitable, Mike enlisted in the U.S. Army, spending time stateside from 1951-1953. \"I didn't want to wait for the draft, I just wanted to go in on my own,\" he said. When he got out of the Army, he went back to work at the hardware store. After that he had a bottled gas business, then went to work with the Rogers City Power Company before it was bought out by Consumers Power.\n\nIn 1965, he went to work as a policeman for RogersCity. He served several years before joining the county sheriff's department. In 1976 he became undersheriff for sheriff Duane Badder then became sheriff after Badder was fatally wounded on the job in 1979. He brought stability to the force which had just lost its leader in a terrible incident. Peltz successfully ran for sheriff in 1980 and was defeated in the 1984 election.\n\nBEYOND HIS work in serving people, Mike's life has been full with volunteer jobs of all kinds. He served as a manager, coach and chief of umpires for many years in the early days of the Rogers City Little League program. \"My dad, years ago, did all of the fireworks. Then Wally and I were in charge of not only purchasing the fireworks but firing them. We did that for 30 years, probably,\" he said. As a member of the Rogers City Serviceman's Club, he served several terms as president. For many years he has been Officer in Charge at the Memorial Day observance. He was in on the ground floor of the local chapter of the Big Brothers and Big Sisters and has served on the Nautical City Festival committee.\n\nFOR MANY YEARS he has served as president of the Rogers City Optimist Club, helping organize many events for the area's youth. Mike raised the money for the Korean War Memorial, which is on the courthouse lawn in RogersCity. He worked on the design and construction of the memorial. \"It was overdue and relatively easy to get done. The committee had no idea how to raise the funds, so I said give me a week. I went out in a week's time and I had the money,\" Mike said. The fund drive had money left over, which the local group sent to the World War II Memorial in Washington, D. C. \"Word got around that I was doing that and I kept getting checks after we had reached our goal,\" he said. \"I'm proud of that. It is a nice memorial.\"\n\nFOR FUN, MIKE has always enjoyed bowling, earning local \"bowler of the year\" honors five times. He still bowls in leagues, carrying a 180-plus average. \"I started working in that bowling alley when it was built. I started working for Frank Buza and Chief Mertz. I set pins, kept score, sat in the foul box, and worked the candy counter as a young kid. All of the older guys were in the war, so the younger kids had a good opportunity to work,\" he said. Married to his wife Barb for 52 years, his main love is his family. \"I really enjoy my family and my grandkids,\" he said. They have two daughters, Marcia and Jenny, and two sons, Randy and Terry.\n\nTHEY HAVE EIGHT grandchildren, the oldest of whom, Steven, is serving in the Navy's nuclear submarine program. \"Everyone needs grandpas. The trouble is they are old when you get them and they don't last too long,\" he mused. For the past 20 years Mike has had a second career working as an assistant for Beck Funeral Home in RogersCity.\n\n\"I just like to help people.
