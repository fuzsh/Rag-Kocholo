        "text": "A variable number of scholarships from $100 up to $1,000 are available.\n\nThis scholarship is impactful as it will provide Forensics participants who have financial need with the opportunity to direct their time to preparing for and competing in Forensics tournaments; with less time devoted to working so to afford their college tuition.\n\nRecipient must demonstrate financial need as required by the UW-Eau Claire Foundation's scholarship award standards.\n\nDonor Background:\n\nAlex Brown was a student under Karen Morris and Kelly Jo Wright competing for four years and graduated in 2016. Before coming on team, Alex had an understanding that not everyone was as able or privileged as he was to be able to attend college and compete for a forensics team. During his time on team, both Karen and KJ helped grow and further imprint the importance of giving back. Alex served as the National Student Representative for the AFA-NIET were he served as the spokesperson for the student body and helped give voices to leadership that might not have been initially heard. He also worked for the team as the Director's Assistant. While on the team, and after graduation, there was always a need that presented itself by students on Eau Claire's team where taking extra jobs or out-of-state tuition, or other unforeseen circumstances took place that would put financial pressure on some of teams competitors. After graduation and realizing how great this need could be, the creation of this scholarship was formed through the idea of giving back, and alleviating some of that financial burden that students face.\n\nThis scholarship is in memory of Trenton Anthony Becker.\n\nThank You Letter Instructions: This scholarship does not require a thank you letter.\n\nApplication:|Forensics Scholarship Application|\n\nFinancial Need:|Required|\n\nProgram/Activity:|Forensics|\n\nOne scholarship of $700 is available.\n\nAwarded to a full-time sophomore, junior, or senior who will be enrolled for the full academic year following notification of the award.

The donors intend for the scholarship to encourage student leaders to be a voice of change on campus.\n\nWhile financial need should not be a priority in selecting the best recipient, it should be a consideration if there is more than one outstanding applicant with equal qualifications.\n\nThis scholarship is not intended to be renewed for the same student from year to year.\n\nDonor Background:\n\nAngie Hambrick is the Director of the Diversity Center at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, WA. She graduated from UW-Eau Claire with a degree in communication and completed her master's degree at Southern Illinois University-Carbondale.\n\nAngela Pittman Taylor, also a communications graduate, received her master's from UW-Milwaukee. Angela is the vice president of public relations for Robert W. Baird & Co. in Milwaukee.\n\nThe two women were friends in college and have remained close since graduating. As students, they were active in multicultural activities on campus and were passionate and dedicated student leaders in the areas of inclusion and social justice. They are working to engage other multicultural alumni to support this collective scholarship effort as a visible testament to their desire to \"pay it forward\" by encouraging current and future students to find their voices and be leaders for change.\n\nThank You Letter Instructions: This scholarship does not require a thank you letter.\n\nApplication:|Multicultural Student Services Scholarship Application|\n\nFinancial Need:|Considered, not required|\n\nCourse of Study:|*Any Course of Study|\n\nOne scholarship of $500 is available.\n\nJunior or senior with characteristics of service to the university, scholarship, character, and a minimum of a 3.5 cumulative GPA.

Haas was the third leader to be president and first to be chancellor of the school which now is known as the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. In 1935 he earned his degree from the same institution which then was called the Eau Claire State Teachers College. While teaching history at Wausau Senior High School he met Dorellen Lambert. They were married in 1941 and moved to Eau Claire where Leonard taught history.\n\nDuring the next 18 years Dr. Haas earned a master's degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a doctorate from the University of Minnesota-Minneapolis. He held administrative position such as registrar and dean of instruction and served in leadership roles in both the university and community.\n\nOn the death of President William R. Davies on December 10, 1959, Haas was named president of Wisconsin State College - Eau Claire with the strong support of the faculty.\n\nLeonard and Dorellen often graciously entertained students, faculty, and community members in their home. Prospective faculty often stayed in their home overnight. Dr. Haas credited Dorellen's “uncanny memory for people” and that she liked people so much as two of the reasons she was so successful in her role as social hostess and in creating a sense of community. Leonard and Dorellen were very interested and supportive of the arts, theatre, and music. Their goal was to attend all campus concerts, recitals, plays, and art shows. They almost succeeded.\n\nAt the Golden Jubilee Year, 1965-66, President Haas received the Distinguished Alumni Service Award. Dorellen Haas was named an Honorary Blugold in 1980.\n\nHaas retired as Chancellor in 1980 but continued to teach and serve as an academic advisor until 1985. Chancellor Emeritus Leonard Haas died on March 14, 1998. Dorellen died on April 20, 2007. After their deaths, the Fine Arts Building on Water Street was named the Leonard and Dorellen Haas Fine Arts Center in recognition of their strong presence on campus for more than 50 years and their love of the fine arts.\n\nDuring a time of burgeoning enrollments, dynamic changes in higher education, and conflicts within the United States, Haas led with respect and empathy for the students, faculty, and community. Chancellor Haas was a highly respected educational and community leader who was very influential and received many awards and honors over his lifetime.\n\nLeonard and Dorellen Haas enjoyed international travel and were very interested in international education and provided strong leadership for the establishment of Study Abroad Programs for students. This scholarship was established to honor their legacy at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire and to assist students in study abroad.\n\nChancellor Leonard Haas was a distinguished alum of the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. Dorellen was named as an Honorary Blugold.

They met during their student days. Upon leaving Eau Claire, Dr. Hibbard went on to earn Master's Degrees from Northwestern University (Political Science) and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University (Diplomatic History) and a Ph.D. from Northwestern (Political Science). He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He taught at Anatolia College, Salonika Greece, and Muhlenberg College, Allentown, PA. During World War II he served with the Office of Strategic Services and the US Department of State, Washington D.C. Jane went on from Eau Claire to teach High School English and Chorus for five years before her marriage to Richard in 1939.\n\nThe Hibbards returned to Eau Claire in 1947 when Dr. Hibbard was hired at the College as a veteran's counselor and instructor in political science. He returned to government service from 1953-1955 in Washington D.C. At the end of that time he again returned to Eau Claire to become the Director of Admissions followed by Dean of Instruction, Vice-president for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Faculty. He led many committees and worked closely with other administrators, students, and the community as the university grew and changed rapidly.\n\nDr Hibbard also had a deep sense of civic responsibility. He was elected to the Eau Claire City Council in 1957 serving four terms including president in 1963-65. He was active in his church, in the Sacred Heart Hospital Board of Trustees and in Rotary International. In October, 1971, Dr. Hibbard became the acting President and later the Interim Chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. In 1972 as Dr. Hibbard and Jane prepared to leave the Homecoming Dance, he had a heart attack. He died on October 17, 1972, and the campus went into mourning. A service \"In Remembrance and Recognition of the Life and Person of Richard Hibbard\" was held on October 19 in the Zorn Arena. The humanities building which was under construction was named the \"Richard E. Hibbard Humanities Hall.\" Jane continued her active interest in and support of the students and faculty at UW-Eau Claire. She died in Eau Claire in 2004.\n\nThe Alumni Scholarship-Richard and Jane Hibbard was established to honor the lives of two remarkable alumni who provided outstanding, selfless service to the University.\n\nThank You Letter Instructions: Recipients should write a thank you letter addressed to the UW-Eau Claire Alumni Association, in care of the UW-Eau Claire Foundation.\n\nApplication:|Alumni Association Scholarship Application|\n\nFinancial Need:|Not required|\n\nCourse of Study:|*Any Course of Study|\n\nOne scholarship of $9,400 is available.\n\nRecipients of this scholarship must be junior elementary education majors with an interest in teaching the first four grades of elementary school. They must have a GPA of at least 3.00. All things being equal, preference may be given to a student with financial need. If a tie-breaker is needed, a student displaying leadership qualities should get the highest consideration.\n\nIf a GPA of 3.00 is maintained, this scholarship is available to be renewed for two additional years.\n\nDonor Background:\n\nThis fund was established to recognize Amy Snodgrass's long career in elementary education. Amy had a true passion for reading and teaching children. Amy started out her pursuits of a higher education when she received a two-year teacher's certificate at age 17 at Eau Claire State Teacher's College (now known as UW-Eau Claire). After teaching for several years, she went back to the Teacher's College to complete her 4-year degree. She also completed a degree in social work from Boston University and received a master's degree in teaching from the University of Colorado.\n\nShe taught in the American School in Germany while serving her country in the Air Force. It was after her time in the service that she moved to Berkeley, CA to teach 4th grade and focus on remedial reading. She was inspiring for children who needed remedial work on their reading skills and taught children to love to read.\n\nWhen she and her husband moved to Paradise, CA in their retirement, she continued that passion by not only reading to neighborhood children, but actually teaching some of them to read. Amy spent time in Norway as an adult. She grew up in a bi-lingual home. Her husband Murray was her biggest fan. He said she not only taught children to love to read but was an inspiration for him, teaching him this same love of reading.\n\nThank You Letter Instructions: Recipients should write a thank you letter addressed to Jeannette Stevens in care of the UW-Eau Claire Foundation.\n\nApplication:|Teacher Education Scholarship Application|\n\nFinancial Need:|Considered, not required|\n\nCourse of Study:|Elementary Education|\n\nA variable number of scholarships from $500 up to $3,000 are available.\n\nThis scholarship is for students demonstrating Multicultural Student Services engagement at UW-Eau Claire.

The Multicultural Student Services office will be responsible for monitoring this activity and determining if the recipient has fulfilled their obligation.\n\nThe scholarship is renewable for the second year of enrollment if the recipient is meeting satisfactory academic progress and upon the recommendation of the Multicultural Student Services faculty.\n\nFinancial need is not a factor.\n\nDonor Background:\n\nThis Scholarship was established in 2010 by Anna and Andrew Burish of Middleton, WI.

The donors want to support students who are pursuing their first undergraduate degree and do not have much support available to them, be it financial or otherwise.\n\nPreference should be given to those students with strong academic records who show great promise to be outstanding nurses. However, if there are applicants with great promise who have encountered academic difficulties outside their control, they should be given consideration for the award.\n\nIt is the donors' intent that if the first recipient continues to make good academic progress through the nursing curriculum and continues to have demonstrated financial need, the scholarship may be renewed for the recipient until they complete their undergraduate nursing degree.\n\nDonor Background:\n\nThis scholarship was established by Anna and Andrew (1987) Burish, of Middleton, WI.

Patrick (1936-2005). Artise was the mother of University of Wisconsin- Eau Claire alumni, Lisa (Patrick) Redfearn Class of 1979. Lisa initially followed in the footsteps of her mother and received a bachelor’s degree in Science majoring in Elementary and Special Education and became a teacher in Florida. Lisa chose to name this scholarship after her mother, a woman who taught Lisa so much about life, honor and respect of all people, which ultimately led to Lisa’s career change to Clinical Social Work.\n\nArtise, originally from Edina, Minnesota, taught Special Education for over 40 years in Wisconsin, predominantly in the Menomonee Falls School District. She was a pioneer of teaching methods and created curriculum for her mentally handicapped students, long before there was a notion to educate mentally handicapped children in a public-school setting. Artise assisted not only her students, but their families while working closely with her colleagues in a team approach.\n\nArtise knew her students were children with many strengths and the ability to learn despite their handicaps. She always saw the potential in each child and expected her students to grow and learn in whatever way was appropriate for them... she was innovative and practical. She expertly adapted materials and equipment to help meet their needs and provided the least restrictive environment before this was mandated in Special Education, through a federal law, PL 94-142 of 1975. In fact, Wisconsin’s state education system was ahead of the federal law mandate and Artise assisted a state team in putting together a similar state law before PL 94-142 was implemented in the country. She assisted the parents of her students by providing guidance, parenting strategies and reinforced a team approach to educating her students. Artise was loved by her students and their families.\n\nShe was a force to be reckoned with and advocated for her students in many ways, which earned tremendous respect from her colleagues, the Menomonee Falls School District, the community and the state of Wisconsin, which resulted in many awards and accolades throughout her career. She was Teacher of the Year many times over and was highlighted in a local documentary on a Milwaukee television station. Artise was an excellent teacher who taught from her heart, for the love of the children, and not for the accolades. She had a truly successful career!\n\nHer husband, three children, extended family and friends loved her dearly and this scholarship is offered to a University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire student of Social Work or Education as a tribute to Artise S. Patrick.\n\nThank You Letter Instructions: Recipients should write a thank you letter addressed to Lisa Redfearn in care of the UW-Eau Claire Foundation.\n\nApplication:|Admissions Scholarship Application|\n\nFinancial Need:|Not required|\n\nCourse of Study:|Special Education|Social Work|\n\nStudent Status:|New Students|\n\nA variable number of scholarships from $100 up to $4,000 are available.\n\nThere are three categories for consideration. Check each one for renewal process. There is no academic major requirements for any of these categories.\n\nFinancial need is not a factor.\n\nFirst priority is for the annual scholarship to go to any descendants of Thusnelda and Walter Richards and Beverly and William Atherton. Any Richards/Atherton descendants interested in being considered will be responsible for identifying themselves in writing to the UW-Eau Claire Dean of Students office with the request they be considered for the scholarship. Individuals accepted to UW-Eau Claire who have been recommended by the Athertons also should receive consideration.\n\nSecond priority shall be given to a student accepted to UW-Eau Claire who specifically states in writing at the time of their acceptance that they would like to be considered for the Atherton Family Scholarship. If the scholarship as awarded to a student matching either of these criteria it may be renewed for three years provided the recipient remains enrolled at UW-Eau Claire, maintains satisfactory academic progress and there are no other qualified recipients.\n\nIf there are no students who qualify under the preceding two criteria, the scholarship may be awarded to an outstanding UW-Eau Claire student participating in the Blugold Marching Band, who shall be selected by the band director. The student must be in at least their second year as a member, exhibit a passion for the band, and have strong leadership qualities. The scholarship in this category is not intended to be renewed.\n\nThank You Letter Instructions: As a condition of acceptance, recipients are expected to write an acknowledgement letter addressed to the Atherton family in care of the UW-Eau Claire Foundation.\n\nApplication:|General UW-Eau Claire Foundation Scholarship Application|\n\nFinancial Need:|Not required|\n\nTwo scholarships of $750 are available.\n\nAwarded to an outstanding junior or senior psychology major with a resident psychology GPA of 3.5. Preference will be given to students who have English as a second language, or who are bilingual, or have demonstrated involvement with English language learners.\n\nSpecial consideration will be given to students who are members of unrepresented groups or have demonstrated financial need.\n\nDonor Background:\n\nDr. Barbara Ložar joined the department of psychology faculty at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire in 1972. She was one of the first women to chair a department in the College of Arts and Sciences and was a leader in most of the curricular initiatives that took place during her tenure at UW-Eau Claire.\n\nDr. Ložar was a scholar, through and through. Hers was a life of continual learning, and of promoting the learning of others. She was as committed to the success of her first year at-risk students, as she was to the success of her graduate students.\n\nHer deep interest in learners who use English as a second language arose from her own history of entering junior high school in the United States, speaking no English. A self-taught English speaker, she developed a command of the language that few native speakers ever achieve.\n\nDr. Ložar dedicated her entire adult life to serving the University and its psychology department tirelessly and with unfailing dedication. Her love of learning, her passion for the University, and her contributions to the University community were unsurpassed.\n\nDr. Ložar passed away in 2011. After nearly four decades of continuous service, she was among the longest serving members of the faculty. Family, colleagues, alumni, and friends established the Barbara Ložar Memorial Psychology Scholarship to honor her legacy.\n\nThank You Letter Instructions: Recipients should write a thank you letter addressed to \"Dear Donors\" in care of the UW-Eau Claire Foundation.\n\nApplication:|Psychology Scholarship Application|\n\nFinancial Need:|Considered, not required|\n\nCourse of Study:|English as a Second Language (ESL)|Languages|Psychology|\n\nTwo scholarships from $1,000 up to $2,000 are available.\n\nThis scholarship will be awarded to a student participating in any of the vocal music groups at UW-Eau Claire. Preference will be given to vocal music majors who are active in the department and who provide leadership through their performance and engagement.\n\nFinancial need is not a factor.\n\nScholarship Background:\n\nThis scholarship was established to honor the memory of Beverly and R. Dale Dick.\n\nBeverly graduated from Stephen's College in Columbia, Missouri in 1952, majoring in voice. She obtained her Bachelor of Arts from the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York in 1955, where she was awarded the Performer's Certificate. She obtained her Master of Arts in Music from the University of Missouri in 1958. She began her career as a musician as director of music at the First Presbyterian Church in Hays, Kansas. She presented voice solos at Fort Hays Kansas State College and in churches in the community, while also teaching voice students privately. In 1967, she joined the UW-Eau Claire faculty as instructor and later as an assistant professor of Music. She taught voice, voice pedagogy, voice literature and performance practice. She performed soprano roles in recitals and oratorios and other programs at the university and in other venues in the Eau Claire community. She retired from the university in 1998. Known as a talented performer and voice coach, she was loved by her students as a professional mentor and role model.\n\nDale graduated from Northwestern University in 1952 with a Bachelors of Science in Psychology and obtained his Masters and PhD in Psychology from the University of Missouri in 1958. He started his teaching career as an assistant professor of psychology at Fort Hays Kansas State College in 1958. He was promoted to associate professor in 1962 and to full professor in 1964. He and Beverly came to UW-Eau Claire in 1966 where he continued his career as the dean of the graduate school until 1981 and as a professor of psychology until his retirement in 1998. Dr. Dick was known as a tough professor, but was admired, respected and loved by students and colleagues. He enjoyed learning about any topic, teaching, woodworking and sailing.\n\nBeverly and Dale were married in June of 1955. They had two sons, Gregory and Jeffrey, and seven grandchildren.\n\nThank You Letter Instructions: Recipients should write a thank you letter addressed to the Dick Family in care of the UW-Eau Claire Foundation.\n\nApplication:|Music and Theatre Arts Scholarship Application|\n\nFinancial Need:|Not required|\n\nCourse of Study:|Music - Vocal|\n\nOne scholarship of $1,000 is available.\n\nThis award is available to support student achievement in curriculum and instruction for public school and community-based programs.\n\nRecipients must be a declared major or minor in one of the kinesiology fields (excluding coaching), be pre-student teaching, and have a minimum major GPA of 3.0.

Although grounded in research and experience, his creative and innovative approaches seemed to flow from a magical formula that honored both diversity and individuality, providing a model for students and athletes as they progressed to their goals as future educators. His mentorship, whether in a classroom, on the field, in his office (and sometimes his back yard,) influenced both their personal and professional lives, fostering relationships with Bill long after they left campus. For those who wonder if there is a legacy in teaching, absolutely yes.\n\nIn 1960, Bill Meiser received a bachelor’s degree in physical education at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, where he also began his education in athletic training and sports injuries. Though prepared to teach physical education and coach at all levels, his primary emphasis was elementary education, which remained a major focus throughout his career. He taught Physical Education K-12 and coached all sports at Fall River WI School District until 1964, when he returned to graduate school.\n\nDuring his master’s degree program at the University of Colorado-Boulder, Bill once again worked as an athletic trainer, this time for the Colorado Buffalo’s football team. He later did additional graduate work at the University of Oregon, concentrating on anatomy, the application into athletic training and sports injuries.\n\nBill returned to Wisconsin as Coordinator of Elementary Physical Education for the Eau Claire Public Schools. In 1968, he joined the faculty at UW-Eau Claire, where he retired as associate professor of Kinesiology in 1997. During his 29 years at UW-EC, his primary responsibility was the preparation of teachers. His areas of expertise included curriculum and instruction in elementary physical education, health, and athletic training. In 1968, Bill initiated what is today’s Athletic Training Program, serving as its coordinator until 1977. He also became UW-EC’s head coach for track and field.\n\nBetween 1972 and 1985, together with assistant coach Keith Daniels and graduate assistant Randy Wilber, Bill guided the track and field program from last in conference to steady improvement. Beginning in 1978, UWEC athletes were competitive enough to qualify for participation in national championships in Cross Country, Indoor Track and Outdoor Track, with Bill Langhout emerging as the Blugolds first national champion (marathon) in 1980. Many consider these coaches’ progress to be the foundation of today’s program, which has continued a tradition of success in conference and national competition.\n\nBelieving in community outreach, Bill initiated the All-Comers summer track meets for the Eau Claire area, bringing participants of all ages to campus. He was also a founding member of the Indianhead Track Club, again welcoming anyone with an interest in the field. With colleagues, Mary Mero and Bob Scott, the Kids’ Summer Gymnastics/Swimming program, Bill as swimming coordinator and instructor, took its place among summer’s community activities at McPhee. His expertise in the prevention and treatment of sports injuries also found its way into area high schools, where coaches and young athletes found Bill a valuable resource.\n\nHis interest in cognition and motor skill development led Bill to Lincoln Elementary School, specifically to their limited English Pre-K Hmong children. Would combining age-appropriate physical activities enhance second language development? He also taught these children how to fish with cane poles off the Madison Street Bridge. A story cloth by these Hmong mothers is a family treasure.\n\nIf there were a single philosophy underlying his teaching career, it was his firm belief that all children can learn, thus approaching teaching as a wholistic process. Similarly, in coaching, he understood the development of young adults, a concern for the emotional and mental impact of competing. In brief, he knew not just the mechanics of sports, but which approaches promote or deter learning.\n\nBill’s teaching career was marked by a devotion to excellence in education, and through his students, to improving the quality of life for children and adults in the community. Former students recall the ways he provided a model for working with people in a wide range of challenging situations, his enthusiasm, his creative and innovative teaching methods, as well as his ability to instill a sense of self-worth and confidence in achieving their goals.\n\nOutside of UW-EC, and in keeping with his career, Bill mentored high school and college students working at Treeland’s Resort, where he managed the resort’s boathouse and started a Tots’ Fishing Trip for guests’ children. An early internet enthusiast, he managed the resort’s website and provided weekly fishing reports for the Chippewa Flowage. The website also became a landing spot for his nature photography of the Flowage. An avid and successful musky hunter, Bill enjoyed all the outdoor activities in season: bow-hunting deer, snowshoeing, and snowmobiling on frozen Lake Chippewa.\n\nA personal and professional life well-lived, Bill Meiser died from a brain tumor in the fall of 2009.\n\nThank You Letter Instructions: Recipients should write a thank you letter addressed to Mary Meiser in care of the UW-Eau Claire Foundation.\n\nApplication:|Kinesiology Scholarship Application|\n\nFinancial Need:|Not required|\n\nCourse of Study:|Kinesiology|\n\nOne scholarship of $1,000 is available.\n\nThe Meiser Coaching Scholarship awards outstanding achievement in KINS 492, the practicum required of coaching minors.

Successful students will have demonstrated leadership, creative and innovative thinking, and the ability to take a deep dive into researching new approaches for teaching and coaching in their sport. Further, the successful student will have shown their ability to interact and connect with young athletes in meaningful ways: understanding adolescent development and the impact of competing at a specific grade level; coaching being more than the mechanics of sport; and respect for individual differences.\n\nRecipients must be junior or seniors with a minimum GPA of 3.0 in major/minor courses and be completing a practicum outside of UW-Eau Claire.\n\nFinancial need is not a factor.\n\nDonor Background:\n\nDr Mary Jordan Meiser, Mark William Meiser, and Susan Meiser Papp initiated this fund to honor the memory and contributions of Bill Meiser: UWEC Teacher and Coach.\n\nIf there were one phrase capturing the professional life of Bill Meiser, it would be his innate passion for teaching and coaching, for instilling in his students the value of every child’s, every adolescent’s capacity to learn. Although grounded in research and experience, his creative and innovative approaches seemed to flow from a magical formula that honored both diversity and individuality, providing a model for students and athletes as they progressed to their goals as future educators. His mentorship, whether in a classroom, on the field, in his office (and sometimes his back yard,) influenced both their personal and professional lives, fostering relationships with Bill long after they left campus. For those who wonder if there is a legacy in teaching, absolutely yes.\n\nIn 1960, Bill Meiser received a bachelor’s degree in physical education at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, where he also began his education in athletic training and sports injuries. Though prepared to teach physical education and coach at all levels, his primary emphasis was elementary education, which remained a major focus throughout his career. He taught Physical Education K-12 and coached all sports at Fall River WI School District until 1964, when he returned to graduate school.\n\nDuring his master’s degree program at the University of Colorado-Boulder, Bill once again worked as an athletic trainer, this time for the Colorado Buffalo’s football team. He later did additional graduate work at the University of Oregon, concentrating on anatomy, the application into athletic training and sports injuries.\n\nBill returned to Wisconsin as Coordinator of Elementary Physical Education for the Eau Claire Public Schools. In 1968, he joined the faculty at UW-Eau Claire, where he retired as associate professor of Kinesiology in 1997. During his 29 years at UW-EC, his primary responsibility was the preparation of teachers. His areas of expertise included curriculum and instruction in elementary physical education, health, and athletic training. In 1968, Bill initiated what is today’s Athletic Training Program, serving as its coordinator until 1977. He also became UW-EC’s head coach for track and field.\n\nBetween 1972 and 1985, together with assistant coach Keith Daniels and graduate assistant Randy Wilber, Bill guided the track and field program from last in conference to steady improvement. Beginning in 1978, UWEC athletes were competitive enough to qualify for participation in national championships in Cross Country, Indoor Track and Outdoor Track, with Bill Langhout emerging as the Blugolds first national champion (marathon) in 1980. Many consider these coaches’ progress to be the foundation of today’s program, which has continued a tradition of success in conference and national competition.\n\nBelieving in community outreach, Bill initiated the All-Comers summer track meets for the Eau Claire area, bringing participants of all ages to campus. He was also a founding member of the Indianhead Track Club, again welcoming anyone with an interest in the field. With colleagues, Mary Mero and Bob Scott, the Kids’ Summer Gymnastics/Swimming program, Bill as swimming coordinator and instructor, took its place among summer’s community activities at McPhee. His expertise in the prevention and treatment of sports injuries also found its way into area high schools, where coaches and young athletes found Bill a valuable resource.\n\nHis interest in cognition and motor skill development led Bill to Lincoln Elementary School, specifically to their limited English Pre-K Hmong children. Would combining age-appropriate physical activities enhance second language development? He also taught these children how to fish with cane poles off the Madison Street Bridge. A story cloth by these Hmong mothers is a family treasure.\n\nIf there were a single philosophy underlying his teaching career, it was his firm belief that all children can learn, thus approaching teaching as a wholistic process. Similarly, in coaching, he understood the development of young adults, a concern for the emotional and mental impact of competing. In brief, he knew not just the mechanics of sports, but which approaches promote or deter learning.\n\nBill’s teaching career was marked by a devotion to excellence in education, and through his students, to improving the quality of life for children and adults in the community. Former students recall the ways he provided a model for working with people in a wide range of challenging situations, his enthusiasm, his creative and innovative teaching methods, as well as his ability to instill a sense of self-worth and confidence in achieving their goals.\n\nOutside of UW-EC, and in keeping with his career, Bill mentored high school and college students working at Treeland’s Resort, where he managed the resort’s boathouse and started a Tots’ Fishing Trip for guests’ children. An early internet enthusiast, he managed the resort’s website and provided weekly fishing reports for the Chippewa Flowage. The website also became a landing spot for his nature photography of the Flowage. An avid and successful musky hunter, Bill enjoyed all the outdoor activities in season: bow-hunting deer, snowshoeing, and snowmobiling on frozen Lake Chippewa.\n\nA personal and professional life well-lived, Bill Meiser died from a brain tumor in the fall of 2009.\n\nThank You Letter Instructions: Recipients should write a thank you letter addressed to Mary Meiser in care of the UW-Eau Claire Foundation.\n\nApplication:|Kinesiology Scholarship Application|\n\nFinancial Need:|Not required|\n\nCourse of Study:|Kinesiology|\n\nAwarded to an outstanding incoming freshman student who has graduated from high school in Wisconsin, been accepted for admission to UW-Eau Claire.\n\nThe recipient must be between 18 and 22 years of age at the time the scholarship is received.\n\nThis meritorious scholarship is awarded to an incoming freshman who meets high academic standards as judged by the scholarship review committee at point of admission.

A GPA of at least 3.00 is required. The recipient should indicate a passion for making a positive impact for brave children like Dylan.\n\nFinancial need should be considered, not required. Either need indicated by the FAFSA or holistic need should be considered as a tie-breaker if all other factors are equal.\n\nScholarship Background:\n\nDylan is a boy born with the odds stacked against him. At three days old, after being rushed to the hospital barely breathing and in a coma, he was diagnosed with a rare metabolic disorder called Propionic Acidemia. His extraordinary condition is one in which his body is incapable of properly processing certain parts of ordinary proteins and fats.\n\nUpon admission to the hospital, Dylan was immediately placed on dialysis to help clear the poisonous toxins that were running rampant in his tiny body as a result of the inability to process protein. After recovering from his initial crisis and learning he had a very severe case of this disease, he was placed on the liver transplant list at seven months old. Just two months later, Dylan received a new liver. The transplant has made his disease much more manageable, but he will live with medical and developmental challenges for the rest of his life. Now five years old, he has been in physical and occupational therapy since he was a baby.\n\nIn addition, due to Propionic Acidemia, Dylan struggles with speech development. He has been diagnosed with the speech disorder Apraxia. He has attended Speech Therapy one to three times a week and this year has made great progress verbally communicating with others with a new type of speech therapy called Prompt.\n\nDylan has been through far more than any young boy should. After hundreds of days spent in the hospital, countless surgeries and procedures, numerous and regular pokes and prods, and one therapy after the next, his resiliency to tackle everything head on and with a smile has never wavered. He is the epitome of everything courageous. Dylan's family gives this scholarship in his name to celebrate his courage and bravery. It is their hope that the deserving individual who receives this scholarship will passionately make a positive impact for brave children like Dylan.\n\nThank You Letter Instructions: Recipients should write a thank you letter addressed to Jay and Dawn Jaehnke in care of the UW-Eau Claire Foundation.\n\nApplication:|Teacher Education|Communication Sciences and Disorders Undergrad|\n\nFinancial Need:|Considered, not required|\n\nCourse of Study:|Communication Sciences and Disorders|Special Education|\n\nOne scholarship of $1,500 is available.\n\nAvailable to drama majors or minors of sophomore standing or higher are full-time students.

The quality of the theatre productions became popular with the community and drew large audiences. In 1947 Eau Claire became the first teacher's college in the nation to be admitted to membership in the National Collegiate Players.\n\nKjer played an important role in the design and building of the complex at the corner of Park and Garfield which was dedicated in 1952. At the time The Little Theatre “was one of the finest for stage, workroom, wardrobe, and dressing areas in the country”. Kjer, another faculty member, and the National Collegiate Players worked for years to raise money to equip the theatre.\n\nEarl and Vera Mae developed close bonds with many of the theatre and speech students and maintained those relationships with alumni. Vera Mae Kjer was a former home economics teacher and they often graciously entertained students and alumni in their home, across the street from the campus. Earl was known as “Papa” Kjer to the students. Together Earl and Vera Mae organized and chaperoned trips to Chicago and New York so student could experience professional and Broadway plays.\n\nIn his twenty-three years at Eau Claire Earl Kjer directed over 60 plays, taught all the theatre classes, and administered the theatre program. During that time Earl Kjer was the theatre program. In the spring, 1964, Kjer, chairman of the department of speech, because of ill health announced his retirement from directing plays. In his honor The Little Theatre was renamed the Earl S. Kjer University Theatre. Earl Kjer died in 1965. At that time the Earl and Vera Mae Kjer Memorial Scholarship Fund was established and continues to honor the legacy of the Kjers.

A devoted teacher and scholar herself, she believed that one of the most important challenges the University faced was not just to train teachers but to educate them in the disciplines they would be taking out into the schools of Wisconsin. In particular she wanted to know that those who taught the language she loved shared both her passion and her expertise.
