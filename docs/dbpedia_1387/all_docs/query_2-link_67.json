        "text": "John Michael Wenzel, 80, Harrisville, formerly of Erie and North Platte, Neb., passed away Thursday, March 31, 2022, after an extended illness.\n\nJohn was born in Erie Feb. 18, 1942, to Peter and Florence (Pfeiffer) Wenzel. After graduating from Cathedral Prep, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy, where he proudly served 1960 to 1963.\n\nJohn married Sylvia Nawrocki May 14, 1966, an event that always topped his \"Smartest Things I've Ever Done\" list. John and Sylvia were an inseparable team and together raised five children: Ken Wenzel (Melbourne, Fla.); Leann Johnson (Madison, Wisc.); Sheri Hodkinson (Allen, Texas); Tracie Alles (Lincoln, Neb.); and Erin Wenzel (Denver, Colo.).\n\nWith Sylvia, there were polkas to be danced, Saturday night bowling leagues to join and, recently, Silver Sneakers classes to attend at the local YMCA.\n\nJohn had a talent for mechanics and worked his entire career on or near locomotives for General Electric, first in Erie, then in North Platte, Neb., and finally in Grove City. While working for GE he earned a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering Technology from Gannon University, with his wife and five kids in attendance as he received his diploma.\n\nWhen not playing with trains, John applied his creativity and problem-solving skills to multiple classic car restoration projects. He also loved hunting, watching NASCAR races, listening to country music (\"the good stuff, not that new stuff!\"), and reading Robert Parker mystery novels.\n\nJohn relished the monthly GE Retiree breakfasts, attending as many as he could. He was friendly and social, and loved to tell stories. Many of these he pulled from a seemingly inexhaustible list entitled \"It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time.\" The story of winning the Thanksgiving turkey raffle never got old!\n\nJohn is survived by his wife and children, his sister Michele Kostek (Erie, Pa.); grandchildren Harper, Sean, Emilie, Maia, Reagan and Jacob; and many nieces and nephews.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents and twin sister, Jeanmarie.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please consider donating to John's favorite charity, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (stjude.org), or to a veterans support organization of your choice.\n\nWENZEL\n\nJohn Michael, 80, Harrisville.\n\nCalling hours: 9:45 to 10:45 a.m. Thursday (4-7-22) in the day chapel of The Church of The Beloved Disciple, 1310 S. Center St. Ext., Grove City.\n\nMass of Christian burial: 11 a.m. Thursday in the church.\n\nBurial: Calvary Cemetery, Erie.\n\nOnline condolences at cunninghamfhgc.com\n\nArrangements by CUNNINGHAM FUNERAL HOME Inc., 306 Bessemer Ave., Grove City."
