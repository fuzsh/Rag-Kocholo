A service to celebrate his life of 71 years is scheduled at 10:00 AM on Saturday, October 29, 2022, at Lake Ridge Chapel. Jerry passed into the arms of the Lord on Monday, October 24, 2022. Please view the service broadcasting schedule, floral purchasing, and an area to share stories of Mr. Wenzel with his family here on this page.\n\nJerry Wayne Wenzel was born July 11, 1951, to Wilburn Willie and Mildred Francis (Bartley) Wenzel in Brownfield, TX. Jerry had two siblings, Kenneth and Patsy. Jerry attended Brownfield Schools until he graduated. Jerry married the love of his life, Patricia Doss, on June 27, 1975, in Seminole, TX. Their son Jeremy Wenzel, of Shallowater, was born on November 15, 1977, followed by their son Jason Wenzel, of Slaton, TX, on February 20, 1981. After being Brownfield residents their entire lives, Jerry moved his family to Bryan, TX for nine years where he worked at Car Quest Auto Parts. Jerry worked for S&P, Car Quest, and Barron Service Parts/Napa Auto Parts his entire career and retired in 2017 after 53 years in the industry. Jerry is so well-respected for his knowledge in the parts community that customers would still seek him out for advice after retirement.\n\nJerry gained the title of Papa in 2002 and enjoyed nothing more than spending time with his 3 grandsons, 1 granddaughter, and 1 great-granddaughter.\n\nJerry enjoyed live music, drag racing, fishing, and loved traveling with Patricia wherever the road took them, and never missed an opportunity to dance to Fraulein whenever it came on.\n\nJerry is survived by his wife, Patricia Wenzel; sons, Jeremy (Stacy) Wenzel, and Jason (Cassie) Wenzel, grandchildren, Austin (Linzi) Wenzel, Riley Wenzel, Reagan Wenzel, Houston Wenzel; great-granddaughter, Maisyn Wenzel; and a sister, Patsy Wenzel; also mourning him are many cousins, nieces, nephews, and extended family members.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his parents; and a brother, Kenneth Wenzel"
