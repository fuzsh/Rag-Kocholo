        "text": "Michael Wenzel has reimagined his entire approach to wine, and now his entire operation in Burgenland has moved to the zero/zero side of the spectrum, fashioning wines of incredible purity and texture. They manage to be at once clean, aromatic, savory and refreshing...an impressive feat indeed, given the danger of inconsistency inherent in pursuing a non-interventionist approach. Wenzel's Sheep and Wolf is best described by its importer, Winemonger:\n\n\"Michael Wenzel made one concrete egg of this super fresh, floral and lively wine. Born from a conversation with our team at RAW, it is spontaneous yeast fermentation, 90% Chardonnay 10% Sauvignon Blanc lightly fermented on the skins for 30 days and aged 18 months before release.\n\nMinimal sulphur added. This fun, luscious take on a Friulian style wine makes it perfect for sipping on its own or for pairing with a wide range of dishes.\"\n\nBiodynamic, vegan, no sulfur added."
