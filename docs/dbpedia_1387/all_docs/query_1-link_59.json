Lathrop (1912–1921)\n\nFrom Hull House to first female U.S. Bureau chief\n\nChildren’s Bureau Era, under the Department of Commerce and Labor\n\nBiographical Information\n\nBorn in Rockford, Illinois in 1858, Julia Clifford Lathrop attended Rockford College before going to Vassar, from where she graduated in 1880. After spending some time working at her father’s law firm in Rockford, she became a resident of Hull House, a settlement home in Chicago for immigrants and the poor. While at Hull House, she conducted surveys of the living conditions, which were compiled into “Hull House and Papers.” This work was notable as it earned her an appointment to the Illinois Board of Charities in 1892. Serving in this capacity, Lathrop visited and inspected public institutions, such as poorhouses, mental health organizations, orphanages, and shelters, in Chicago and around Illinois.\n\nIn 1912, President Taft appointed Lathrop to be the first chief of the newly created Children’s Bureau, established within the Department of Labor. Lathrop was the first woman to be appointed chief of any bureau in U.S. history. Under her leadership, the Bureau focused on issues of infant mortality, nutrition, child labor laws, juvenile delinquency, mothers’ pensions, and treatment of the mentally ill. Additionally, Lathrop and the Bureau were involved in lobbying for the Sheppard-Towner Act, which gave federal funds to states to create programs for maternity care and was passed by Congress in 1921. Lathrop resigned as Chief in 1921 and was succeeded by Grace Abbott.\n\nFor more information on Lathrop and her life, visit the following links:\n\nhttp://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/alumni/julia-lathrop.html\n\nhttps://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/federal/lathrop-julia-clifford/\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Julia-Clifford-Lathrop\n\nPrimary Documents from the Children's Bureau National Archives Collection\n\nPublished Works\n\nLathrop, J.C.

Leading labor and literacy reforms.\n\nGrace Abbott, PhM (1921–1934)\n\nLeading labor and literacy reforms\n\nChildren’s Bureau Era, under the Department of Commerce and Labor\n\nBiographical Information\n\nGrace Abbott was born in 1878 in Grand Island, Nebraska in a family that valued education and political involvement. After graduating from the Grand Island Baptist College, Abbott was unsure of her purpose. Until she was twenty-nine, she lived at home with her parents and taught at the local high school. In 1907, she left Nebraska to study law at the University of Chicago, but ended up developing an interest in social work. She completed her degree in Ph.M. in 1909. The year before, she had taken up residency at Jane Addams’ Hull House and become director of the Immigrants’ Protective League (IPL), working to improve the quality of life for immigrants. She served in this role until 1917. At the IPL, specific results of her advocacy included devising a state plan to enforce compulsory school attendance for immigrant children and persuading President Taft to veto an act of Congress that mandated literacy tests for entry into the country. As well, Abbott taught for several years at the University of Chicago and the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy, and was an active participant in the labor movements by joining the Women’s Trade Union League. In 1917, she became director of the Industrial Division at the Children’s Bureau. She developed enforcement plans for the first child labor laws enacted by Congress in 1916, and led the inspection for compliance of all of the major shipbuilding plants on the Atlantic Coast, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Great Lakes. Abbott then briefly returned to Chicago to serve as executive secretary to the Illinois State Immigrants’ Commission and then chair of the child labor section, Illinois State Children’s Commission.\n\nIn 1921, she went back to Washington, D.C. when President Warren G. Harding appointed her as chief of the Children’s Bureau. In this role, she saw the passage of the Sheppard-Towner Act, which provided the first federal grants to aid the social welfare of children and authorized government cooperation with states that promoted maternal and child health. She championed the use of sociological data to guide the lawmaking process, calling for the collection and incorporation of research on child labor, juvenile delinquency, and dependency. During her term, the Bureau helped fund more than 100 social research investigations including “Maternal Mortality in 15 States,” “Children in Agriculture,” and “Children in Street Work.”\n\nIn response to the Depression in 1929, Abbott advocated for federal relief aid by collecting and distributing relief reports from 203 cities to national agencies. From 1922 to 1934, Abbott also served as official representative of the U.S. on the League of Nations’ advisory committees on trafficking of women and on child welfare. She served as President of the National Conference of Social Work, and even supported the organization of the first Conference on Social Work in Paris in 1928. After resigning in 1934, Abbott held a professorship at the University of Chicago’s School of Social Service Administration and was editor of the Social Service Review. Additionally, she remained politically engaged through chairing labor conferences and state committees on child labor, supporting causes such as women’s rights, participating in President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s council on economic security, and helping to draft the Social Security Act. She died in 1939.\n\nFor more information on Abbott and her life, visit the following links:\n\nGrace Abbott : An Introduction (YouTube video; 4:22 minutes)\n\nhttps://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/organizations/childrens-bureau/abbott-grace/\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Grace-Abbott\n\nhttp://www.ssa.uchicago.edu/grace-abbott\n\nGood Housekeeping article, One of America’s 12 Greatest Women: http://www.ssa.uchicago.edu/grace-abbott-one-americas-12-greatest-women\n\nPrimary Documents from the Children's Bureau National Archives Collection\n\nPublished Works\n\nAbbott, G.

Lenroot (1934–1951)\n\nServing as MCH ambassador to the world\n\nThe Children’s Bureau Era, Under the Department of Commerce and Labor\n\nBiographical Information\n\nKatharine F. Lenroot was born in Superior, Wisconsin on March 8, 1891. She attended University of Wisconsin, Madison, from which she graduated in 1912 with degrees in economics and sociology. After college, she began her career as a deputy at the Industrial Commission of Wisconsin as an assistant to Emma O. Lundberg. In 1914, Lundberg was appointed as the first director of the Social Service Division of the United States Children’s Bureau so Lundberg and Lenroot moved to Washington, D.C. There, Lenroot served as a special investigator in the division until being promoted to Assistant Director. She largely focused her work on juvenile courts and issues affecting unmarried mothers and their children. Lenroot rapidly ascended the ranks of the Children’s Bureau, becoming the Director of the Editorial Division (June 1921) and then the Assistant Chief of the Bureau (November 1922).\n\nWhen Grace Abbott retired as Chief in 1934, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt appointed Lenroot as the Bureau’s third Chief. The Bureau’s responsibilities expanded substantially under the FDR administration. During her term, Lenroot worked on the design and advocacy for Title IV (Aid to Dependent Children), and Title V and VII of the Social Security Act (1935). She also led efforts to address child labor, maternal and infancy health concerns, expanded services for disabled, neglected, and dependent children, aid for soldiers’ wives and children, and international children’s welfare. During her term, she was the United States representative on the executive board of UNICEF, helping to set the new organization’s agenda. Martha May Eliot succeeded Lenroot as chief of the Bureau in 1951. Meanwhile, Lenroot continued to work with UNICEF. She also remained active in child welfare work particularly in collaboration with the Child Welfare League of America, and the International Union for Child Welfare. She died in 1982.\n\nFor more information on Lenroot and her life, visit the following links:\n\nhttp://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/archival/collections/ldpd_4079022/\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1982/02/13/katharine-lenroot-dies-headed-childrens-agency/3cc10430-6dcf-48cc-bee0-877a930e0e0c/\n\nhttps://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/federal/lenroot-katherine/\n\nPrimary Documents from the Children's Bureau National Archives Collection\n\nPublished Works\n\nLenroot, K.F.

Oettinger (1956–1967)\n\nServing as the voice for children with developmental challenges\n\nTransformation to MCH, MCH Service, Public Health Service\n\nBiographical Information\n\nKatherine Brownell Oettinger was born in Nyack, New York in 1903. She received her bachelor’s degree in Sociology from Smith College in 1925, and completed her master’s degree from the Smith College School for Social Work in 1926. She served as a caseworker with the Charity Organization Society in New York City until 1929, supervising students from the future Columbia University School of Social Work. In 1929, she became a mental health consultant in the Visiting Nurse Association in Scranton, Pennsylvania. There, she met her husband, began to raise her two sons, and ultimately was appointed chief of the Division of Community Service in the Bureau of Mental Health of the Pennsylvania Department of Welfare in 1950. She administered the first National Mental Health Act funds in Pennsylvania. Then, Oettinger moved to Boston to serve as Dean of the School of Social Work at Boston University. In 1954,\n\nPresident Dwight Eisenhower appointed her chief of the Children’s Bureau in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Oettinger was most known for her work for children with developmental challenges. She believed strongly that these children could be cared for at home rather than institutionalized. She led a six-fold increase in the bureau’s budget and spearheaded efforts on important maternal and child health issues such as child abuse, juvenile delinquency, and day care.\n\nShe also served as secretary of the 1960 White House Conference on Children and Youth, and as chair of the Interdepartmental Committee on Children and Youth. Oettinger also held several international roles, including U.S. representative on the UNICEF executive board (1957-1961) and chair of the U.S. delegation to the 11th Inter-American Congress on Children (1959). At the end of her time as bureau chief, she became a fierce advocate for family planning. She was the first public official to speak out in its favor in 1965, leading to her appointment as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population and Family Planning in the Department of HEW in 1968. However, she struggled to keep this a priority with presidential appointees in the Nixon administration. She retired from federal government in 1970. After her retirement, Oettinger consulted on topics related to population and family planning for organizations such as the International Association of Schools of Social Work and the Inter-American Dialogue Center, and lectured at colleges and universities. She died in Carmel, California on October 15, 1997.\n\nFor more information on Oettinger and her life, visit the following links:\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1997/10/15/katherine-oettinger-94-dies/6b6bab86-a123-4c15-ab94-3c804482d33c/\n\nhttps://sophia.smith.edu/ssw100-history/going-gets-tough-copy/\n\nhttps://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/8/resources/5616\n\nhttps://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v23n8/v23n8p39.pdf#nameddest=article\n\nPrimary Documents from the Children's Bureau National Archives Collection\n\nPublished Works\n\nOettinger, K.

After finishing his tour in 1955, he completed his Pediatrics residency at the University of California Medical School, San Francisco where he served as Chief Resident from 1957-1958. He then worked in private practice for a decade before obtaining his MPH at the University of California, Berkeley in 1968. He felt a calling to serve people’s health needs by integrating the work he did in private practice with public health. In 1968, he moved to Philadelphia to run the Children and Youth project at Women’s Medical College of Pennsylvania. He was also Assistant and then Associate Professor of Pediatrics, and taught at the college.\n\nHe entered federal service in 1971 when he was appointed Regional Medical Director for the Maternal and Child Health Service Region III office that had just been moved to Philadelphia. Hutchins learned to manage financial and administrative responsibilities to serve the regional MCH programs, preparing him well for his growing career in civil service.\n\nIn 1977, he became Director for the Office for Maternal and Child Health. He guided it through various administrative identity changes before ultimately emerging as the Maternal and Child Health Bureau. During his nearly two decades in the role, he was proudest of his work on the development of national standards for prenatal care, out-of-home child care, and health supervision guidelines; and the development and strengthening of state-federal partnerships. Hutchins was known for his commitment to mentorship and ability to maintain good relationships with political appointees and members of Congress.\n\nAfter retiring from the MCHB in 1992, he became Executive Director of the National Ready to Learn Council, and joined the National Center for Education in Maternal and Child Health in 1994 as a Distinguished Research Professor. He also was the Chair, Division of Policy, NCEMCH, Georgetown Public Policy Institute, Georgetown University. Hutchins received many awards from the federal government and MCH community.
