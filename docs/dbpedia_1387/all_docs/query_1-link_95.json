        "text": "There is the Ruby Dee of my childhood: In black and white, in “A Raisin in the Sun,” the grainy old movie that my middle-school teacher showed us to prepare us for our fall production of the play. As Ruth Younger, the young wife and almost matriarch of a hard-pressed black family living on the South Side of Chicago, Dee was supposed to appear worked over, resigned, deferred. We were just children, but my teacher told us to look hard at her acting. Did we see the flesh she gave to the role? We should try for that when it was our turn on the stage.\n\nI remember lying on the hard carpet of our classroom and looking into Dee’s eyes. I struggled to understand why a woman as self-assured as Dee would dare show her vulnerabilities — her undone hair, her tenderness, her despair — with such abandon. But when Sidney Poitier, playing the role of Walter Lee Younger, her husband, a man “wacked up with bitterness” because of his low lot in life, berated her for being just a defeated, defeating colored woman, what upset me most was not the painful lie behind the insult but rather how impossibly misdirected his comments were. Dee, even in that shapeless, shabby robe and sorrowful role, steamed.\n\nShe could shoot daggers or tantalize, and all the while her eyes remained fixed. They projected an electric, heavy intention that went way beyond mere stagecraft. Ruth as played by Dee was a disavowal of all the easy, uncomplicated stereotypes projected onto black women.\n\nWhen I went home that day and told my mother and grandmother that I had watched Ruby Dee in school, they threw out a tangle of adjectives and sighs. Oh, wasn’t she so beautiful. So lithe, but so tough. And what of that long love she had with her husband, Ossie Davis? He was her partner in every sense of the word.\n\nWhen you grow up a black woman in America, you are often taught your worth, and inoculated against other people’s biases, by the women who surround you and the women who came before you. Dee’s commitment to civil rights cast her, my mother told me, as an emissary of our humanity and evidence of our greatness. She showed up at lunch counters, at police plazas, in the streets, in 1963 in Washington at the March for Jobs and Freedom. And after hearing about that, I knew Dee was one of ours. See, they could have their Bette Davis eyes, but we had Ruby Dee’s. We had to share her, of course, with the world, but she became a part of the quiet instruction in how to be brave without forgoing our beauty.\n\nNo wonder then that she found her way to Spike Lee. In the bold colors and the noise of Lee’s Harlem, I rediscovered her in “Jungle Fever” late last year, when I found a VHS tape of the movie on a stoop near Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn. I had been too young to watch an R-rated movie when it first came out, so I checked the clunky cassette for bedbugs, and then brought it home.\n\nNothing prepared me for the gut punch that was Dee’s wail when her character, Lucinda, loses her feverishly troubled firstborn, Gator, shot to death by his father.\n\nMany years ago, I read the Spanish playwright and poet Federico García Lorca’s lines about a mother’s grief after losing her son: “What does your purity matter to me? What does your death matter? What does nullity after nullity matter to me? Blessed are the crops, because my sons lie beneath them; blessed is the rain, because it moistens their faces.” I’ve been reminded of those lines twice, once while watching Dee as Lucinda hold her dying son, the very figure of the Pietà, and a few months ago when I saw a picture of Michael Brown’s father weeping over his boy’s coffin in Ferguson, Mo. In “A Raisin in the Sun,” Dee’s performance was quiet; by “Jungle Fever,” her rage was earned. What remained the same was that her roles spoke to a very real black existence rarely seen in American filmmaking.\n\nRuby Dee was an actor masterly enough to express — loudly, unforgettably — all of that hurt. To show us just how strong her grief was and just how strong all of our grief could be.\n\nLate one February evening in 1962, at a White House party in honor of the president’s sister and brother-in-law, John F. Kennedy approached Ben Bradlee with what he thought was a friendly tip. Bradlee was the Washington bureau chief of Newsweek at the time, but he and his wife, Tony, were invited to the party primarily because they had grown close to Kennedy and his wife, Jacqueline, in the late ’50s, when they all lived on the same block in Georgetown. The friendship was complicated. Bradlee’s growing prominence as a journalist was due largely to his proximity to the president, and Kennedy (though Bradlee didn’t know it at the time) was having an affair with Bradlee’s sister-in-law, Mary Meyer. Kennedy gave Bradlee small exclusives, but rarely anything of much significance. Now he offered real news. The United States had just arranged a prisoner trade with the Soviet Union: the downed U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers for a high-ranking Soviet spy known as Rudolf Abel. The White House would announce the news in a couple of hours, and Kennedy wondered whether it was too late for Newsweek to change its cover.\n\nKennedy thought he had two favors to hand out: one to his friend Bradlee, who might avoid having old news on his cover for the week, and the other to the daily journalists who would actually break the story. It was too late to change the cover, but Bradlee had a different idea. He had helped engineer the sale of Newsweek to the Washington Post Company several years before, and the publisher of both, Philip Graham, was at the party with his wife, Katharine. Bradlee made a beeline to Graham and within a few minutes was on the phone dictating an article to The Post’s night managing editor — and for a couple of hours, Bradlee had the world beat. Kennedy was so surprised to see the article on the front page of The Post the next morning that he considered starting a leak investigation. A few days later, when he figured out what happened, Kennedy asked Bradlee, semi-jokingly, “Who do you work for, anyway?”\n\nBradlee’s portrayal of this scene in his memoir, “A Good Life,” is one of the most romantic in the entire book: “A moment from another world!” he wrote. “It was the kind of moment that made Kennedy nervous about me, and me nervous about my relationship with him. . . . But I was not nervous enough to sacrifice the professional challenge and thrill.” The two men were much alike — Boston, Harvard, service in the Pacific during World War II, dashing, privileged, nonchalant — and they were attuned to the flow of power. Bradlee profited from his association with Kennedy, but he sometimes resented that the president always had the upper hand. With the spy-swap story, Bradlee had a chance to seize the action for himself — no delay, no clearing copy with the magazine editors in New York. The immediacy satisfied, and so did the power.\n\nBy the end of 1963, Philip Graham and John F. Kennedy would be dead, Graham by his own gun and Kennedy by an assassin’s. Katharine Graham, uncertain but brave, would become Bradlee’s new boss. When she asked him to the F Street Club for lunch in 1964 to see what his plans for the future might be, she was surprised to hear him say that what he wanted more than anything was to be the managing editor of The Post. A year later, that’s what he was, and the work The Post produced on his watch — the Pentagon Papers, Watergate — would elevate reporters and editors to new heights of celebrity and influence, for better and worse. Journalists became real players, operators, and none more so than Bradlee himself. As Carl Bernstein once put it, in a way that must have satisfied his old boss, after Watergate Bradlee would become the most important man in town, other than the president.\n\nDuring a road trip in the middle of the 1983 season, Tony Gwynn, a struggling second-year outfielder with the San Diego Padres, asked his wife to start videotaping his at-bats. When he returned home, Gwynn popped in the tape, made a few tweaks to his swing and finished that season above .300 — as he would for the remaining 18 seasons of his career. Gwynn retired in 2001 with a .338 lifetime average and eight batting titles. Five years later, he was voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.\n\nBefore it became commonplace for teams to employ full-time video staffs, Gwynn lugged a Betamax on the road, studying himself and the pitchers he faced. He was an obsessive student of hitting akin to Ted Williams, whose book, “The Science of Hitting,” Gwynn read in college. The two men would become friends, often talking for hours about the art of good contact. “I started to realize,” Gwynn once told an interviewer, “that this thing was more mental than it was physical.”\n\nThis may explain Gwynn’s continued success despite the transformation of his physique from lithe (he was an all-conference point guard at San Diego State) to portly. He used superb hand-eye coordination and a tiny 31-ounce bat to hone his stroke to maximum precision: If all went well, he would hit the ball sharply between the shortstop and the third baseman — the “5.5 hole,” he called it. (As a reminder, Gwynn had the words embroidered on his cleats.) Over his career, Gwynn struck out an average of 29 times per 162 games, an astonishing rate. His season high was 40 in 1988. By comparison, Mike Trout, the reigning American League M.V.P., struck out 184 times last season.\n\nGwynn, with his refined technique, mastered the batter-pitcher confrontation. We may never again see a hitter who so consistently got the best of his adversaries.\n\nThe View From The Mound\n\nCurt Schilling, 1988-2007\n\n“One of the highlights of my career was striking him out. I struck him out once, and it took three or four of the filthiest pitches I’ve ever thrown, in one at bat.”\n\nAl Leiter, 1987-2005\n\n“His hand-eye coordination was as good as anybody who ever stood in the box. I never faced a guy in my 17-plus years where I conceded that I was not going to strike him out. I was just hoping he would hit it at somebody.”\n\nRick Sutcliffe, 1976-94\n\n“After a game, most players get on the plane and grab something to eat, grab a couple beers. Tony would fire up his video machine and start studying the next night’s pitcher. If he didn’t have tape on that guy, he’d watch tapes on someone similar. We’re not going to see a guy hit .338 for his career again — not unless they lower the mound.”\n\nJohn Smoltz, 1988-2009\n\n“He could have hit 20 to 25 home runs per season, but he maximized his ability to do what he wanted to do. He didn’t miss. I prided myself on striking guys out, and I never went into an at-bat thinking, There’s no way I can strike this guy out. But with Tony, I did.”\n\nRon Darling, 1983-95\n\n“If you played him up the middle, he hit it to left. If you played him to hit it to left, he hit it up the middle. He’s the first guy I ever tried to shift infielders on. He was just a magician.”\n\nDavid Cone, 1986-2003\n\n“He studied every pitcher’s motion and idiosyncrasies. Every time I would glance over at the bench during a game, he was watching. But what impressed me most was how he reacted to the strike in 1994, which ended the season. He had a chance to hit .400 that year, but he never complained. That taught me all I needed to know.”\n\n“Rene Ricard is a poet and movie star,” reads one of his biographical notes in Artforum; unlike many such notes, it was absolutely true. He arrived in New York from Acushnet, Mass., at 18, having changed his name to Rene from Albert Napoleon Ricard, which sounds like a row of liqueur bottles. He presented himself at the Factory, where Andy Warhol assigned him to wash dishes in “Kitchen” (1965). He didn’t fare much better in his other parts: He is silent in “Chelsea Girls” (1966) and unseen in “The Andy Warhol Story” (unscreened; 1966) and “****” (shown once; 1967). But he went on to parody his superstar abjection, rather movingly, in Eric Mitchell’s “Underground U.S.A.”\n\nHe was a movie star and a poet, but also an art critic and a painter. In his diaries, Warhol called him “the George Sanders of the Lower East Side, the Rex Reed of the art world.” He did not mean it as a compliment. But while there’s no question that Rene was an acid-tongued gossip, he was an Olympian acid-tongued gossip, far beyond the realms of mere columnists. In a better world, he would have been our Baudelaire — and he may yet be that, given the culture’s propensity for posthumous compensation.\n\nAs a critic, he only wrote a bare handful of pieces, but they were major events. He was the poet-advocate of Julian Schnabel and Jean-Michel Basquiat at the start of their careers. In his 1982 essay, “The Pledge of Allegiance,” on the Fun Gallery and its graffiti painters, he set forth his credo: “I pledge allegiance to the living and I will defend art from history. I will rescue art from the future, from its attrition into taste, and from the speculative notion that it will become more valuable with time.” Those are brave words and, considering how the art world soon evolved, foredoomed; his career as a reviewer did not last much longer. “I had to make my history quick because there would be no future, merely a gossamer world blown about on the zeitgeist, till zeitgeist, the wind of the times, is blasted away by kamikaze, the wind of God,” the essay said.\n\nHe knew art the way few people do. An online reminiscence by Erik Wenzel accurately conveys the flavor of his table talk: “Always look at paintings on copper. . . . Paintings on copper maintain the richness of pigment that canvas sucks up. You can always tell with green. Green is a fugitive and unstable pigment, if you have a good green, then you can rest assured that what you see is pretty close to what it looked like the day it was painted.” He spoke this way even in passing. And note that his formal schooling ended after eighth grade.\n\nHe was my upstairs neighbor in the East Village for just under a decade. He would accost me in the halls to rave when he was high, often something about Lorenzo Da Ponte, Mozart’s librettist, who was rumored to have been buried across the street. I didn’t know if he recognized me from one occasion to the next; sometimes he repeated the previous rant. Then he accidentally burned down his apartment, lit with candles and filled with newspapers and valuable paintings, and I didn’t see him for a decade. But when I ran into him somewhere, he knew exactly who I was, and he showed me unprompted kindness, much needed then.\n\nHe became ever more elegant as he aged. In the words of the critic Lisa Liebmann, by the time he died, he looked “like a 17th-century, Franco-Iberian grandee: Specifically, the cold and brilliant Cardinal de Richelieu.” He was brilliant, and he was rhetorically armored, but he wasn’t the least bit cold. Just as his life could vacillate between glory and squalor, his poems — which he eventually took to painting over his own or others’ canvases — are all heartbreak and defiance, ruined love and declarations of an independence he insisted on even when he sat at the best tables.\n\nIn 1979, President Jimmy Carter nominated Cornelia Kennedy for a seat on a federal appeals court. Kennedy was already a trial judge — the first woman, in fact, to serve as chief judge of a U.S. District Court. This appealed to Carter. He was trying to diversify the federal bench and had a long way to go. Three presidents before him — Nixon, Ford and John F. Kennedy — had each selected only one woman for the courts.\n\nBut Kennedy was in another sense a curious choice. Carter had issued an executive order pledging to choose judges who have “demonstrated commitment to equal justice under the law.” His selection of Kennedy tested the meaning of those words. Her father, a prominent Detroit lawyer who raised her and two of her sisters after their mother died, counseled his daughters against pursuing traditional female careers. Still, her politics tilted to the right. She was first appointed to the bench by President Nixon and had amassed a conservative record in her years on the trial court.\n\nThe N.A.A.C.P. opposed Kennedy’s nomination, pointing out that she ruled repeatedly against the plaintiffs in cases involving racial discrimination and police brutality. At the center of the controversy was a case she decided on school desegregation in Ferndale, Mich., a middle-class suburb of Detroit. For almost 50 years, one school in Ferndale, called Grant, was attended exclusively by black students (with only one exception). All the other schools in town were overwhelmingly white.\n\nIn 1975, the federal government sued Ferndale for maintaining Grant as segregated. The case landed in Kennedy’s courtroom. At trial, testimony showed that the Grant School was overcrowded, yet the district never transferred children to nearby white schools with space for them. The Ferndale superintendent said that “it would not be satisfactory to the colored group” to be placed at a white school “as a separate grade by themselves,” taking it as a given that if black students were to switch schools, they would remain in “all colored” classrooms.\n\nKennedy ruled for the school district, saying that Ferndale’s policies were “not motivated by an intent to segregate.” The Court of Appeals reversed her decision. It was around that time that Carter chose Kennedy for the same appeals court, the Sixth Circuit. Eight years before the Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork set off a political firestorm, Kennedy was the subject of a tense hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Ferndale case “was almost her downfall,” remembers Nathaniel Jones, who was then general counsel of the N.A.A.C.P. — and who, in a sense, saved Kennedy. With Kennedy’s nomination pending, Jones, too, was selected for the Sixth Circuit. “We were packaged together,” he says. In the end, the Senate confirmed both picks, and by the time he left office, Carter had reached a total of about 40 female judges and almost as many black judges.\n\nOn the bench in the decades that followed, Kennedy and Jones regularly disagreed. “In cases that involved human considerations, I felt she was very hard to reach,” Jones said. In 1997, she voted to take away a $250,000 jury award from a woman who won a sexual-harassment suit. Jones particularly remembers an appeal he and Kennedy heard together in 1984, from a veteran of the Korean War seeking disability benefits. Since his 1953 discharge, the man suffered from the aftereffects of trauma; he’d carried his injured commander through enemy lines, only to discover he was dead. He experienced blackouts and severe anxiety and struggled with alcoholism and unemployment. Jones and a second judge voted to grant the man benefits. Kennedy dissented, because she didn’t feel there was enough evidence that he’d remained continuously ill.\n\nDespite Jones’s frustration with her legal ideas, he appreciated Kennedy’s civility. She would cross the hall to his office so they could walk together to lunch with their colleagues. “That may seem like a small thing, but I think it matters,” Jones said. Kennedy also hit one feminist high note during her career: When she found out that the husbands of judges received fewer spousal benefits than wives did, she successfully campaigned for equality.\n\nIn the summer of 1991, as I was leaving the National Concert Hall in Dublin during an international writers’ conference, I was startled to see the Canadian writer Mavis Gallant walking alone ahead of me. She was small, had thick auburn hair and wore a red-and-black houndstooth suit and brown pumps. She crossed the street to the Conrad Hotel, where many visiting writers were staying. I found it impossible not to follow her.\n\nGallant was 68 then and didn’t strike me as frail, but she walked in a tentative way; when she approached the opposite curb, she paused to consider it, as if it were challenging her to leap across a creek. She entered the hotel. I trailed behind. I had read 11 of her books, marveling at the searing wit locked in embrace with bitter sadness, the intelligence wound around the loneliness. Her style was fast, knowing, brutally direct and so vivid it was outright filmic. Two years earlier she signed a book for me at an event in New York, but I was too stupidly awe-struck to speak to her then.\n\nIn the hotel lobby, four Irish women — local poets — were lounging on couches with the casual intimacy of women lying topless on a beach, yawning sumptuously, shoes kicked off, laughing loudly. Gallant stood silently near them, clearly at a loss. A conference official introduced her to the women. They said hello, extending their hands to her without standing up. I realized with dismay that they had no idea who she was.\n\nPlenty of writers have gushed about Mavis Gallant’s work. Michael Ondaatje: “One of the great short-story writers of our time.” Fran Lebowitz: “The irrefutable master of the short story in English.” Russell Banks: “One of the immortals.” Margaret Atwood: “Wonderful.” Alice Munro: “Marvelous.” Alice Adams: “Astounding.” Why, then, did so few people know who Mavis Gallant was? Ondaatje called her work “a well-kept secret.” Yes, but what a pity to keep world-class literature a secret.\n\nGallant wandered off and sat in one of two empty chairs apart from the other writers. She appeared uncomfortable, isolated, out of place in her beautiful houndstooth suit. Suddenly some overwhelming impulse knocked my childish diffidence to the ground. I approached her. She said, “Yes?” smiling so eagerly that I had the impression she would have been thrilled at that moment to be addressed by any passing stranger. She invited me to sit with her. “I don’t know anyone here,” she said. “You’re only the second person who’s spoken to me since I arrived.”\n\nI was disarmed by how uncertain and accessible she seemed. Uncertain? Forget that. With no uncertainty whatever she began shredding the writer’s conference — disorganized, haphazard and all that onstage nonsense about Europe becoming Americanized, the clichés about anti-intellectualism in America.\n\nEventually I said I admired her writing. She looked surprised, then pleased, then asked apprehensively: “Is that because I’m a woman? Because I read Proust, you know.”\n\nIt was like a line from one of her stories, momentarily startling, a non sequitur, until the meaning catches up with you and burrows deep, where it glows like a smoldering coal. She wouldn’t be categorized as a women’s writer, wouldn’t be categorized at all. No, I told her, I loved her work because she was a scarily great writer. Again, she smiled.\n\nFinally, she had to travel by bus with the other writers to meet the president of Ireland. When we stood up, she held my forearm in both her freckled hands and said, “Do you want my address, Rosemary?”\n\nHer address was so far-fetched a piece of intimacy that it had not occurred to me to want it. Floored, I took it. She hooked her arm in mine, and we went out. Boarding the bus, she said again, nervously, “I don’t know any of these people.” Somehow I found the nerve to tell her, “All you have to do is introduce yourself.” She laughed, thanked me and disappeared.\n\nIn the fall of 1972, Shirley Temple Black noticed a lump in her left breast. She was 44, no longer the precocious moppet with the “56 perfect ringlets” who received more fan mail than Greta Garbo. She had retired from films, married (twice), moved to the Bay Area and had three children. Inspired by George Murphy, a former dance partner turned senator, and by the matinee idol turned governor Ronald Reagan, she went into politics, running for Congress in 1967 on a conservative, pro-Vietnam War platform. She lost, but the race clinched her career in public service. When she discovered the lump, she had just been sworn in by the Nixon administration as special assistant to the chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality.\n\nIn those days, a woman with a suspicious mass was typically rushed into surgery for what she was told would be a biopsy. If a preliminary pathology revealed cancer, though, the doctor would just keep on cutting while his patient remained unconscious. Instead of the assumed minor operation, she would awaken having undergone a mastectomy. And not just a mastectomy, but radical surgery in which the underlying muscles of the chest wall were stripped along with the breast. That so-called one-step procedure, which combined biopsy with treatment, was thought to be potentially lifesaving for patients and, equally important, was convenient for doctors. If the on-the-spot read later proved incorrect, as it sometimes did, the presumption was that the patient would simply be grateful that she didn’t have cancer.\n\nA friend of Black’s had undergone a biopsy that turned into a mastectomy, and Black wasn’t going to let that happen to her. “I find intellectually distasteful the prospect of waking up and finding that someone else had made a decision and taken action in which I, lying quite inert on the operating table, had had no voice,” she later wrote in an essay for McCall’smagazine. She had consented only to a biopsy; she would make further choices, if need be, once she saw the results. That two-step approach was already common in Europe but still highly controversial in the United States. When told she did, in fact, have cancer, Black rebelled again, insisting, against her own surgeon’s recommendations, on a simple mastectomy, in which only the breast tissue is removed (this is standard today).\n\nShe called a news conference from her hospital bed in Palo Alto, Calif., a mere three days after surgery, wanting to educate her “sisters.” If caught early, she assured American women, with her familiar optimism, breast cancer could be cured (decades later, a more complex reality would emerge). She received some 50,000 letters of gratitude and support; three months later she broke another taboo by writing about her grief in the McCall’s essay, “Don’t Sit at Home and Be Afraid.” “It is an amputation,” she wrote. “I face it. This is how it is.”\n\nIt’s hard to imagine now, when celebrity breast-cancer diagnoses bring an inevitable publicity windfall, how risky Black’s disclosure was. At the time, cancer was still considered a death sentence; its “victims” — not yet recognized as “survivors” — were often denied or fired from jobs, their health insurance revoked. Some people even believed the disease was contagious.\n\nBetty Ford is often credited with breaking that public silence. But Black beat her to it by two years. What’s more, while Ford’s revelation may have been extraordinary, her response to her illness was not. When an early patient activist, for instance, begged her to legitimize the two-step procedure by undergoing it herself, the first lady refused, explaining, through an intermediary, “The president has made his decision.” As for Black, the American Cancer Society scolded her for her defiance, fearing that other women might follow her lead, demanding input into their treatment and questioning their doctors’ authority. They did and still do today.\n\nThe pews of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary church in Rochester, N.H., were packed on a cool, damp Saturday in October for a memorial for James Foley. The autumn foliage was peaking in this rural, working-class New England town; if Foley had still been alive, it would have been his 41st birthday.\n\nFoley was a journalist, though the event could easily have been mistaken for a service for a fallen soldier. “Jim died because he was an American,” his brother Michael said from the church’s pulpit.\n\nAfter the service and a Mass, everyone filed into an adjoining banquet hall for lunch. On top of a table sat a photo album from Foley’s childhood — Jim in a Halloween costume, or wearing Mickey Mouse ears at Disney World — and a scrapbook of clippings that the local paper, Foster’s Daily Democrat, had published during his two periods in captivity. There were lots of articles from the first, 44 days in Libya in 2011. “Detained Rochester Journalist Hopes to Be Home for Sister’s College Graduation,” one headline read. (He was.) From his second, the 600-plus days in Syria that ended with his barbaric beheading in August, there was just one story: “Foley Missing for One Year Now; Family Says Their Faith Sustains Them.” The rest of the scrapbook’s pages had been left blank.\n\nFoley was not the first war correspondent to be killed in the line of duty in recent years, but his videotaped murder made it grotesquely clear that we have entered a new era in conflict reporting. One hundred forty-four journalists were killed in 2012 and 2013, making these the deadliest back-to-back years for reporters since the Committee to Protect Journalists started collecting data in 1992. The year 2014 will end up being nearly as deadly, and will include three American victims. In addition to Foley, there has been Steven Sotloff, who was also beheaded by Islamic State militants in Syria, and more recently Luke Somers, who was killed by Al Qaeda in a village in southern Yemen during an American raid to rescue him and other captives.\n\nAll three were freelancers, working without the benefits and safeguards of institutional support; and unlike staffers, they had a direct financial incentive to get the most dramatic images and stories possible, regardless of the risk. All three were covering conflicts in which reporters have not only lost their protected status but have become, quite literally, high-value targets: ISIS collected millions of dollars in ransom payments for Foley’s fellow prisoners. And, if their countries refuse to pay, journalists can be cast in carefully choreographed execution videos advertising the group’s ruthlessness to both enemies and potential recruits.\n\nBefore Libya, Foley was an embedded freelancer with the United States military in Iraq and Afghanistan. But he wanted to get closer to the people whose lives were affected by conflict. So he moved on to Libya. This was a revolution, a civil war between the rebels and the defenders of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi’s government. Foley and a few others went looking for the front lines of the conflict and found it. They were attacked by Qaddafi’s forces. One, Anton Hammerl, was killed, and the rest were taken prisoner by the regime.\n\nAfter his release, Foley went home to New Hampshire and did a stint as an editor for The GlobalPost in Boston. His family and friends urged him to stay put, but they all knew he’d go back to the Middle East before long.\n\nWhen he did, heading to Syria in 2012, most American news organizations were already pulling back on their coverage of the region. The romantic revolts of the Arab Spring, embodied by the peaceful mass demonstrations in Tahrir Square in Egypt, had metastasized into violent sectarian warfare across the Middle East. Covering conflicts, especially unconventional conflicts, is an expensive and dangerous proposition. And the public’s appetite tends to be limited for stories from distant war-torn countries with no U.S. boots on the ground.\n\nThe vacuum created an opportunity for freelancers like Foley. The bar for entry was low. No credentials were required. All you needed was a smartphone that shot video, some notebooks, a laptop. From southern Turkey, you could take a bus or taxi across the border into Syria and, with a little luck, find some moderate rebel fighters to follow.\n\nSome of the larger news organizations set policies against using freelancers in conflict zones like Syria to discourage reckless behavior and avoid liability. Others wouldn’t send freelancers in but would buy stories from them once they were there, even if they wouldn’t always cover all of their expenses. Foley scraped by writing and shooting video for the GlobalPost and Agence France-Presse.\n\nHe worked mostly out of the embattled Syrian city Aleppo, a hotly contested front in the civil war. The group that would come to be known as ISIS did not yet exist. But with the help of an influx of foreign fighters from Iraq, the radical militants were quickly overtaking the more moderate rebels. The country was growing more dangerous. As it did, Foley’s tolerance for risk, combined with the lack of institutional constraints — no editor could tell him not to go somewhere — gave him a competitive advantage.\n\nWhen he was kidnapped in the fall of 2012, he and his traveling companion, a British photojournalist, were headed back to Turkey. They were just 40 minutes from the border when they stopped briefly at an Internet cafe to file their stories and pictures. It was there that they were probably spotted by the man responsible for the ambush of their taxi soon after.\n\nIt’s hard not to wonder whether things might have played out differently if Foley had better resources. What if he had been traveling with security? Or in an armored vehicle instead of a taxi? If he’d had the proper technology to upload the files himself, would he even have needed to stop at that Internet cafe?\n\nIt’s hard not to ask a larger, more existential question too: Foley watched Hammerl die amid a hail of bullets that could just as easily have killed him. He was imprisoned for six weeks in Libya. He was, at the time of his capture, 39 and barely scratching out a living in a profession with ever-diminishing prospects. Why put himself through it?\n\nChris Hedges, a former war correspondent for The New York Times, offers one answer in his book “War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning,” writing that “the rush of battle is a potent and often lethal addiction.”\n\nThat’s surely part of it, but there’s something else, too. At Foley’s memorial, a local pastor, Rev. Paul Gousse, repeated what Foley told him right before he left for Syria: “The world needs to know the plight of the little people who are walked upon like grass.”\n\nAfter the lunch, I went out for coffee with Clare Gillis, a freelance writer who was captured with Foley in Libya. She, too, had gone home when they were freed, but also soon returned to the Middle East and is now based out of Cairo. “Freelance journalism is not a job,” she told me. “It’s a dangerous and expensive hobby.”\n\nWhen I dropped her back at the church to meet her parents, who had driven up from New Haven to see her and attend the service, I asked how long she planned to be in the States. She said she was leaving the next day. She had to get back to line up assignments for a reporting trip to Iraq.\n\nIn 2007, Adrianne Wadewitz, one of Wikipedia’s most prolific editors, created an entry for “Janeite” — the term that emerged at the end of the 19th century to describe superfans of Jane Austen. Wadewitz, who at the time was at work on a Ph.D. in English literature, meant this entry to describe an extremely influential community in literary history but also to serve as a corrective for Wikipedia as a whole. Calling Janeites “the first subculture,” she also compared them to Trekkies, the more male-dominated network of aficionados that surfaced some 70 years later. Left unstated was the fact that the Trekkies article on Wikipedia was first posted in 2001, the year Wikipedia itself went live.\n\nIt’s very likely that there would be no Wikipedia without the superfan passion of male obsessives, whose work has dominated the site since its inception. But as Wadewitz proved during her illustrious decade-long career as a Wikipedian, neither should there be a Wikipedia without the superfan passion of women like herself. Her Janeite article showed why — first by suggesting, radically, that Janeites deserved credit for codifying contemporary fandom; and second by investigating the derision heaped on Janeites without participating in that derision itself.\n\nWadewitz, who died in April following a rock-climbing accident, was the rare Wikipedian who could pull all that off. She was an academic, but she wrote often as a proud layperson. A fan. A student. An obsessive. A collector and curator of facts, in a role that befit an Enlightenment scholar like herself, drawn to the grit and populism of facts over the narcissism and magical thinking of literary theory. Facts enchanted Wadewitz, but she also managed to enchant them back.\n\nIn July 2004, roughly a year after finishing her master’s thesis — “Doubting Thomas: The Failure of Religious Appropriation in The Age of Reason” — Wadewitz began working on Wikipedia as a break from that scholarship. In those days, Wikipedia hosted fewer than 500,000 articles in English; today it contains more than 4.7 million.(By contrast, the final print edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica has roughly 65,000 entries.) Wadewitz went on to compose, from scratch, 99 articles on history and literature and to make nearly 50,000 edits. Her fellow Wikipedians frequently gave her work the site’s highest honor: a place of prominence on the site’s home page. “Adrianne was simply one of the best editors this project has ever had,” wrote a Wikipedian named Colin on “User Talk: Wadewitz,” which has become Wikipedia’s extensive open-source elegy site for Wadewitz.\n\nWadewitz, who created entries for many unsung female writers, including Dorothy Kilner and Ellenor Fenn, carried off her mostly uncredited work with such brio that she seemed single-handedly to develop the craft (and ideology) latent in the deceptively banal form of the open-source encyclopedia entry. A simple line from the Fenn article conveys Wadewitz’s appreciation for 18th-century narrative conceits, family improvisation and even the circulation of capital: “Although they had no biological children, they adopted and brought up an orphaned heiress, Miss Andrews.” Do adoptees who come with substantial trust funds and go exclusively by honorifics like Miss Andrews exist outside of sentimental fiction? Surely they must, or must have; as a literary scholar, Wadewitz never failed to recognize the perpetual influence of fiction on fact, and fact on fiction.\n\nWadewitz, against the odds, rose to command authority in Wikipedia’s notoriously gangsterish back channels. By registering new Wikipedians and questioning the site’s conventions, she helped open its ranks to editors, many of them women, who might otherwise have been scared off by the hacker jargon and the techie proceduralism that originally served to keep all but battle-hardened trolls out of the community. Any encyclopedia that purports to be the sum of human knowledge and includes “Trekkie” but not “Janeite” must have any number of other biases and blind spots. These can be remedied only by editors, like Wadewitz, with vision born of eclectic experiences and areas of expertise — and the confidence to advocate for them.\n\nHe was a 5-foot-7 dynamo with a sly grin and a textbook set shot. In his prime, he was one of the best shooters in the country and a member of the championship-winning Baltimore Bullets in the late ’40s.\n\nBut Red Klotz made losing his life’s work.\n\nHe was the owner, manager, coach, mascot and chauffeur (in a used green DeSoto) of the Washington Generals, a team he created to lose, night in and night out, to the Harlem Globetrotters. He also cast himself as the Generals’ star point guard, a snowy-haired old man in kneepads still sinking set shots well into his 60s.\n\nThe Generals would become the sorriest team in the history of sports — 14,000 losses and counting — but from the beginning theirs was a single-minded, almost existential mission, as ineluctable as mortality. To be born is to die; to be a General is to lose. Over the years, Klotz’s Generals lost in the Egyptian desert and on N.B.A. floors, at Disney World and the Attica Correctional Facility, in a ‘'Simpsons\" episode and in Hong Kong. They lost in front of Nikita Khrushchev and Barack Obama.\n\nThey should have lost on Jan. 5, 1971, too, inside a rickety gym in Martin, Tenn. They limped into town with a losing streak at 2,495 games. No one expected the night to end in any other way than with loss No. 2,496.\n\nBut the Globetrotters were off their game. Meadowlark Lemon, one of the team’s stars, couldn’t make a shot. The Generals, meanwhile, a collection of former collegians playing as the New Jersey Reds that night — one of several phony names used to give the impression that multiple hapless teams chased the Globetrotters around the court (and the country) — couldn’t miss.\n\nThe Generals were up 12 with just two minutes to go.\n\nWith seven seconds left, the universe regained its balance: Lemon scored to give the Globetrotters a 99-98 lead. Then Klotz answered from some 20 feet out: 100-99, Generals.\n\nAll part of the show . . . right? Surely the Generals knew the script: Let the Globetrotters make a last-second basket to win the game.\n\nOn cue, Lemon shot. Lemon missed. The game was over. The Generals — the Generals! — had won.\n\nThe sold-out crowd sat silent, stunned. For a brief moment in a small town in northern Tennessee, to be born was not to die. Then the booing began. People had not paid to see the Globetrotters lose.\n\nIn his book on the Globetrotters, Ben Green called the game a blow to American confidence, putting it alongside Lt. William Calley’s conviction in the My Lai massacre and the publication of the Pentagon Papers.\n\nKlotz didn’t experience it that way. The Generals raced to their tiny locker room in disbelief. They had no Champagne on hand. So they hoisted Klotz onto their shoulders instead and doused him in orange soda. Lemon visited the Generals’ locker room to congratulate the victors.\n\nMore than four decades later, the game is nearly forgotten. There is no Disney movie about it, no sports documentary reliving the upset victory.\n\nPerhaps that’s because the Harlem Globetrotters were permanent underdogs, a team of extraordinary athletes long forced to compete outside the white mainstream leagues. Cheering for their loss would have been like cheering for Jackie Robinson to strike out.\n\nBut Red Klotz was the Globetrotter’s greatest ally, the furthest thing from an oppressor. He had devoted his career to showcasing their talent, by trying valiantly and always falling short. He deserved a chance to celebrate.\n\nThere is no YouTube footage of the Generals’ triumph. Klotz’s biographer, Tim Kelly, never found a box score of the game in Martin, Tenn. The local newspaper, the Weakley County Press, did not even cover it.\n\nSomehow, it’s better that way. In an era when every sports score gets pushed to your phone, Red Klotz’s victory lies just at the edge of the realm of known fact.\n\nHow tall was Achilles? To ask is to miss the point.\n\nLauren Bacall had the good fortune and the bad fortune to have been unforgettable early in life.\n\nShe always worried that the whistle line from Howard Hawks’s 1944 film, “To Have and Have Not,” would be the lead of her obits, that people would deem her 19th year the tawny pinnacle of her long, rich life.\n\nHow could it be otherwise?\n\n“You know you don’t have to act with me, Steve,” Bacall told Humphrey Bogart’s jaded fishing captain. “You don’t have to say anything, and you don’t have to do anything. Not a thing. Oh, maybe just whistle. You know how to whistle, don’t you, Steve? You just put your lips together and . . . blow.”\n\nThat exchange, performed fully clothed by a virgin feigning worldliness, sparked one of the most erotic scenes in American film. It’s what allowed Betty Joan Perske from the Bronx to metamorphose into a shimmering screen siren named Lauren Bacall.\n\nBacall called Hawks her “Svengali,” but it was his stylish wife, Slim, who saw her looking slinky on the cover of Harper’s Bazaar. Slim had been a cover model herself once. She knew what her husband liked.\n\nBacall “really worked,” the director told Joseph McBride in “Hawks on Hawks.” “You had to give her credit.” Hawks invited Bacall to the regular Saturday-night parties he and Slim hosted, but he didn’t want to be obligated to drive her home every time because he wanted to be free to get tipsy.\n\nWhy couldn’t she find a guy to drive her back? he wondered.\n\nAre you nice to them? he asked her.\n\n“Nice as I can be,” she replied.\n\nHe mused: “Maybe that’s wrong. Why don’t you try not being nice? Why don’t you try to insult them?”\n\nShe tried it on the next guy she met at a Hawks party, purring that she wanted to know what store his tie was from, so she could tell people not to go there. She got her ride home. When Bacall told Hawks, he asked who the guy was.\n\n“Clark Gable,” she replied.\n\nThat gave Hawks an idea. “Do you suppose we could make a girl who is insolent, as insolent as Bogart, who insults people, who grins when she does it, and people like it?” he asked.\n\nAnd so Slim — Hawks endowed her with the nickname of his wife — was born. Hawks wrote the whistle line himself.\n\nThis was all fantasy, and yet “To Have and Have Not” also captured that rare alchemy of celluloid characters falling in love at the exact moment the actors were.\n\nBacall’s memoir offers vivid scenes when she defies her angry mom and races to meet the unhappily married Bogie in the middle of the night, flying as she jumps into his “safe embrace.” Bacall started “on a cloud,” with rave reviews and ravenous passion. Her eventual, happy marriage to Bogart produced two children, “The Big Sleep,” “Dark Passage” and “Key Largo.” Act One ended when cancer killed Bogart in 1957.\n\nWhatever subsequent triumphs Bacall had — in “How to Marry a Millionaire” and “Designing Woman” and in the Broadway hits “Cactus Flower,” “Applause” and “Woman of the Year” — and whatever subsequent relationships she had, including a broken engagement to Frank Sinatra and a fractious marriage to the alcoholic actor Jason Robards (with whom she had another child), they would never match that first rush.\n\nBacall called her memoir “By Myself,” and in later years her interviews were peppered with laments about solitude. She lived to 89, confronted with one of the great quandaries. How do you continue beyond the mythmaking moment? When you start with such a singular liaison, how can you not be lonely when it’s gone?\n\nLate on a July evening in 1967, amid the riots tearing through Newark, Amiri Baraka, poet, agitator and native son, was pulled over by police officers and beaten nearly unconscious. Hours earlier the arrest and public assault of a black cabdriver at the hands of the police set off frenetic waves of vandalism and arson — an explosion that would sunder Newark’s history into distinct epochs of before and after the riot. By the time Baraka’s van was pulled over, swaths of the central business corridor were aflame. He was taken to jail and then a hospital, where he was left in a hallway covered in his own blood and handcuffed to a wheelchair. He transformed the experience into “Black People!” an ode to an urban insurgency he understood as a product of entrenched racism and stagnant possibilities for Newark’s black population. The poem is an assemblage of concussive verse, jarring even now for its open advocacy of rioting:\n\nNo money down. No time to pay. Just take what you want. The magic dance is in the street.\n\nWhen he composed those words, the poet himself was at an aesthetic and personal crossroads — one of many he traversed in a career that spanned more than five decades. Baraka did not so much evolve into new intellectual positions as ricochet into them. He was born Everett Leroy Jones to a middle-class Newark couple in 1934, left the city first for Howard University, then the Air Force, which expelled him because he subscribed to “subversive” publications, then migrated to Greenwich Village, where he produced important work in three different genres. His first poetry collection, “Preface to a Twenty Volume Suicide Note,” brought him public recognition; his 1964 play “Dutchman” won an Obie Award, and “Blues People,” his book of music criticism, was hailed as a kind of uniquely perceptive musical sociology, charting the relationship between black music in the United States and the social circumstances that produced it.\n\nDeeply affected by Malcolm X’s assassination in 1965, Baraka rejected the apolitical art of the Beat movement and moved to Harlem, where he helped found the radical aesthetic school that came to be known as the Black Arts Movement. The following year, he returned to Newark and cast himself headlong into building a black cultural movement there.\n\nOn that night in 1967, on South Seventh Street near South Orange Avenue, those ambitions collided, literally, with the city’s establishment. In his memoir, Baraka recalled the moment at which he recognized one of the officers as a high-school classmate. “‘Hey, I know you,’ I said, just as the barrel of his .38 smashed into my forehead.” The prosecutor charged Baraka with gun possession (he insisted he had no weapons that night), and the judge, after reading “Black People!” aloud in court, sentenced him to three years in prison. Baraka said that recitation was part of the reason the conviction was overturned on appeal.\n\nIn the wake of that uprising — Baraka would insist that it be referred to not as a riot but a rebellion — the city’s first black mayor, Kenneth Gibson, was elected. Baraka supported him at first but denounced him bitterly when he felt Gibson had been co-opted by the white establishment. Baraka went on to hurl creatively adjectival epithets at Sharpe James, who succeeded Gibson, and call James’s own successor, the Twitter-loving Cory Booker, the “virtual mayor.”\n\nBaraka pinged through a variety of creative and ideological outlooks, innumerable controversies and a staggering amount of artistic productivity. The two themes that united them all were his complementary demands for human dignity and for freedom. In a development that would be maudlin in fiction but is somehow poetic in real life, Baraka was distributing campaign material to nurses even as he lay dying in Beth Israel Medical Center, this time in support of his son Ras, who became mayor of Newark in July 2014, six months after his father’s death.\n\nPete Seeger was not so much a singer as a song leader. He sang well enough and long enough — “as early as 1925,” he told the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1955, by which he meant since he was 6 — that his voice became a great, unique, American sound. To him, this was a sorrow. He didn’t want you to listen to his voice; he wanted you to hear your own, singing. His modesty wasn’t artistic; it was political. “This machine kills fascists,” his friend Woody Guthrie scrawled along the hips of his guitar. Seeger in kind wrote in a tidy script around his banjo: “This machine surrounds hate and forces it to surrender.” For both men, music was a weapon, though Seeger might have winced at the term. A tool, then: utilitarian, but its purpose nothing less than liberation, the deepest kind of pleasure.\n\nWe remember Seeger as a singer of songs beloved especially by children. Everything else — the Almanac Singers, the group he formed with Woody Guthrie in 1940; the Peekskill Riot of 1949, at which an anti-Communist mob stoned him and his kids; the Weavers, with whom he topped the charts in 1950 singing Lead Belly’s “Goodnight Irene”; the blacklist of the 1950s and ’60s, the investigations, the anger — fades. We forget the fact that his art and his politics were refined during the long years of the 1950s and ’60s, when he was rarely allowed to sing for anybody else.\n\nThose were the kind of shows he liked best. An element of his radicalism overlooked by contemporary hagiographers, who mistake it for ordinary humility, was his conviction that artists are workers like any other, due no more or less praise than any other. Kids got that. Kids didn’t know who Pete Seeger was, but he knew who they were: He had a near-miraculous ability to communicate with children.\n\nIn the ’70s, he began making occasional appearances on “Sesame Street,” a program that owes an indirect but enormous debt to the Seeger ethos. His political songs became summer-camp standards, not just at socialist retreats but also for the bored children of middle-class suburbia. The “danger” of his most-sung song, “If I Had a Hammer” (I’d hammer out danger/I’d hammer out a warning), was understood not as fascism but as a bear in the woods, and “love between my brothers and my sisters” was no longer so much a racial message as one about getting along with campers of the opposite sex. There were hand gestures (put your hand over your eyes and look to the horizon; now hammer out that warning), and there were dances (shake your butt, little-kid-style, and pretend you’re ringing a bell).\n\n“I sang for a sector of the population that didn’t think much of the House Un-American Activities Committee,” Seeger once said, with a depth of understatement that would have been bitter had he not thought he’d put one over on the judge who sentenced him to a year in jail for pleading the First Amendment instead of the Fifth when called to account for his Communist associations. His radical legacy, he hoped, would be a generation of kids who’d one day look up from their wiggle dances and say, “Hey, what is the danger?” He didn’t want them to hear him preaching. He wanted them to hear themselves, asking.\n\nHe may have underestimated the power of nostalgia to devour radicalism. It was made painfully evident to Seeger throughout the 1990s, when he accepted a series of the nation’s highest cultural honors: a Kennedy Center award, granted in front of a black-tie crowd that paid as much as $5,000 a seat; and a National Medal of Arts presented by President Clinton, who used a photo-op with the lanky relic — “an inconvenient artist,” he joked — to burnish his credentials with the liberal base even as he led the party rightward. Two social scientists, considering the event for a study of “reputational politics,” came to a blunt conclusion that Seeger “is not dangerous because he is not taken seriously.”\n\nSeeger didn’t need to be dangerous. It wasn’t him he wanted you to hear, it was the songs; and they weren’t his songs, not even “Hammer” — “It’s not my song, you know,” he told me a few years before he died, taking reluctant credit only for the simple tune to which his songwriting partner, Lee Hays, put the enduring words. The song was improved upon enormously, he believed, by “that great jazz singer who died young.” He couldn’t remember the name. He meant Sam Cooke. The way Cooke sang it on a live album recorded at the Copacabana. A nightclub! “I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I don’t like nightclubs,” said Seeger, who never quite outgrew the awkward loner he was as a child. He didn’t need to like nightclubs. He didn’t need to be cool. He didn’t even need to be remembered, as long as you remember the songs he borrowed for a while.\n\nMaybe that’s the best tribute we can offer to Seeger’s unique American voice — we can forget it was his; we can make it our own. By the end, he told me, he had to sing only one line. Less, even. “If I had a. . . .” He waited for me.\n\n“Hammer,” I sang, after a pause.\n\n“And justice and freedom and love,” Seeger said. “The audience sings all those lines. I just give them a few hints here and there.”\n\nEric Garner was a dad who liked to dress up as Santa Claus on Christmas. He was the right size for it, more than six feet tall and round, pushing 350 pounds. He had asthma, and he wheezed when he walked, so it was hard to move around too fast, but still he enjoyed putting on the Santa costume, dancing around the living room, singing and handing out gifts to his five kids and three grandchildren. His wife’s name was Esaw, but he called her Pinky. They met as teenagers and married in 1989. To support their growing family, Garner cycled through careers as an auto mechanic and a nightclub bouncer before joining the horticulture crew for the city’s parks department on Staten Island. He had to leave the parks job in September 2013 because the plants exacerbated his asthma. His other health problems, including diabetes and heart disease, made it hard to hold down steady work.\n\nHe fell back on selling individual cigarettes, or loosies, buying them in packs or cartons and then selling them for 50 cents or so apiece. He often peddled them on Bay Street on Staten Island, angering the owners of area delis and bodegas, who complained that he was stealing their business. The local cops knew he sold, calling him Cigarette Man when they passed on the street. His friends called him Big E. They said he was the kind of guy who, if hit, probably wouldn’t hit back; he was known to break up fights. He was arrested more than 30 times, mostly on minor charges — inevitable fallout from his black-market profession. He wasn’t unfamiliar with the cruelty of the justice system, either, having filed a complaint against the New York Police Department in 2007 that accused an officer of performing a cavity search on him as he stood on the sidewalk. Garner said he asked the officer to do the search in private, at a police station. The officer unzipped Garner’s shorts, the complaint says, and inspected his genitals as passers-by watched.\n\nHis last encounter with the law, as we all now know, came on a hazy July afternoon on Bay Street. Garner stood, hands on hips, exasperated, as two police officers walked up to him. Words were exchanged, and Officer Daniel Pantaleo hooked his elbow around Garner’s neck, dragging him to the ground. Garner gasped, begging for air, repeating the words that would ricochet around the world: I can’t breathe.\n\nThe year saw a series of horrific deaths of African-Americans at the hands of white police officers, leading to an explosion of rage both online and in the streets, accompanied by the anguished cry that \"black lives matter.\" Of all the evidence this year that they did not matter enough, none was more vivid than the cellphone video that captured the incident. At the beginning, Eric Garner is a living, breathing man, talking to the police. Not two minutes later, he is on the ground, gasping for air. An hour later, he would be gone.\n\nThere’s been times when I didn’t know if I’d make it to 63. He went to 63, which meant that the power of his creativity and his sense of humor was pretty superhuman to begin with, and it was just whittled down over decades by this thing. Yeah. Not that anyone’s life is a lesson, because that really demeans the individual’s life. But also I think that we think certain people would be able to handle anything, or we look at them from the outside and think that somebody is handling things well. And I have experienced that. And show business is very much about appearances, so as long as you can still keep doing the job, nobody cares. Nobody cares.\n\nThe last time I saw him, I was doing a show at Meltdown Comics on Sunset. We talked about comic books for like 10 minutes. And I guess this is gonna sound so petty, but the fact that this guy looked forward to new comics every Wednesday, there’s a stupid part of me that’s like, Why didn’t you just stick around for the comic books alone? I totally know what you mean. Just the simplest joys of life, like can’t you stick around for cake?\n\nI would like to think he knew that so many people would have dropped anything to pull him out of that wasteland he was in. I know that if I were to get as depressed as I was three years ago — I was hospitalized three times — if that happened again for a longer period of time, like you just don’t know how to. . . . When your brain isn’t functioning, it’s telling you it’s not worth it, and it’s not gonna get any better. I think I understand now why people really do it, just because it is so exhausting. And even when people love you, it is tiring to the people around you. I mean I had beloved friends who came to visit me in the psych ward every day, and they were the greatest. But at the same point, they feel like: “Oh, Jesus, Maria’s in again? Well, I guess we aren’t gonna go to Sacramento this weekend.”\n\nMary Winternitz first encountered John Cheever on a rainy day in the fall of 1939, in an elevator bound for the offices of a New York literary agent. He was 27, a writer who was not yet famous. She had just graduated from Sarah Lawrence, the dark-haired, 21-year-old daughter of a prominent New Haven family, working as an unpaid assistant at the literary agency in hopes of landing a real job.\n\nHe noticed she was pretty. She noticed he was a small man wearing a tweed overcoat that was much too big. They went on to have a dinner date, at the end of which he borrowed some of her money to pay the bill.\n\nHe had depressive tendencies and a penchant for gin; she was fickle about commitment and enjoyed being alone. Regardless, they planned to marry. She appeared to have an accelerating effect on his work. In the year before he met her, he published two stories. In the year after, he published 15. He began to prodigiously — almost fanatically — keep a journal.\n\n“We will have a good life, darling,” he wrote in a letter to her in 1940, about eight months before their wedding. “A wonderful and beautiful life.”\n\nThey had three children and settled in Ossining, N.Y., in an old Dutch Colonial surrounded by oak trees — their life an approximation of the suburban dream. The house had a garden, where Mary grew dahlias, and a nearby pond, where John sometimes swam naked. There were parties on Saturdays, church services on Sundays, a commuter train that ran easily to Manhattan. The normalcy did not correlate with harmony, however. Their arguments were legendary. They fought when Mary tried to drag John, blind drunk, out of parties. They fought when he didn’t like her friends. They quarreled at meals, to the point at which their daughter Susan one day likened the dinner table to a shark tank. Later, still stewing over the comment, John awarded himself the final word: “I am not a shark: I am a dolphin,” he wrote in his journal. “Mary is the shark.”\n\nThe journals, which were published in 1991, practically sag with his grievances. He writes of Mary’s contemptuous voice and the “dark and impatient” way she looks at him. He complains of her chilliness, finding it bewildering. Why on earth — he seems to ask, again and again — would a woman rebuff a man like him?\n\nBut the answer is there as well, in that voluminous and utterly subjective record — not just of one life, but of two. He describes returning home one day after a lunch in New York to find Mary finishing up the chores. “Mary cleaning the broom closet,” he notes. “She has repaired the toilet seat, which I should have done, painted the front door.” Instead of expressing guilt or gratitude, his first thought, as put down in the journal, is that she doesn’t love him enough.\n\nAccording to him, their issues are myriad: He wants to have sex all the time, for example, and she wants to have sex almost none of the time. He acknowledges, in fairness to Mary, that he is quite often impotent — ostensibly because he has a ferocious appetite for alcohol and perhaps because he finds himself lusting steadily, irrepressibly, after men.\n\nOutwardly, John Cheever was a successful writer with a house and a family and plenty to be happy about. Inwardly, he was something else. He was roiling, over perceiving and lonely — a closeted bisexual living a diminished existence. He noticed too much, felt everything, couldn’t filter it fast enough. All this despite the gin and sedatives. His sensitivity lent a brilliance to his writing, helping him win both a National Book Award and a Pulitzer Prize, but it made life — for both of them — difficult. He referred to himself once as “the walking bruise.”\n\nWhich meant Mary was the person who ironed the shirts and served the bruise dinner.\n\nIn 1962, however, Mary took a job. She began teaching English to young women at nearby Briarcliff Junior College and was evidently very good at it. Three days a week, she dressed up for work and left the house happy.\n\nHer independence made him prickly. He referred to her students as debutantes and dismissed the school as “an eighth-rate college.”\n\nTo which she replied, “Oh, John, it’s a fifth-rate college, and you know it.” The Cheevers went to see two different psychiatrists over the years, in both instances prompted by John, who felt certain that his wife had diagnosable problems. The visits, as recalled in Blake Bailey’s 2009 biography, “Cheever: A Life,” suggested otherwise: The first doctor deemed Mary to be fine but noted that John presented as “egocentric, narcissistic, evasive.” Consulting the second doctor years later, John was so drunk — “sauced,” he wrote in his journal — that he could hardly remember the man’s face. The psychiatrist, however, had a lively talk with Mary. “Patient is a sensitive intelligent woman, much spunk,” he observed. “She hasn’t been in love with her husband for a long time but has a great sense of loyalty and devotion. Sort of that she’s taking care of an important creative person.”\n\nNobody gives an award for forbearance in a marriage. There’s no Pulitzer for cooking dinner or cleaning the broom closet or, as Mary ultimately did, holding onto a commitment well after your husband has had a series of affairs and descended into a sloppy and self-destructive alcoholic fog.\n\nIt would be a disservice to imply that Mary Cheever was a pushover — that she didn’t have her own short-lived extramarital affair, her own sense of how things should be, her own agonies and creative gifts. The point is that she accepted John Cheever long before he accepted himself. When finally, in 1975, he went through a 28-day rehab program in Manhattan and dried up for good, it was Mary who picked him up and drove him home to the suburbs. She cared for him six years later, as cancer began to eat at his body. At the end of his life, she made room for a couple of his lovers, young men he’d met while teaching, allowing them time alone with John.\n\nIn 1980, two years before her husband’s death, she finally leveraged her own words, publishing a volume of poetry. At its center is a poem called “Gorgon,” addressed directly to him. In it, she suggests that he has wanted too much from her, that their marriage has in some ways denied her a life. She likens herself to a stone monolith, shaped by his battering neediness and blinding drive to create. His vulnerabilities hardened her, but they also kept her there. “Husband,” she wrote, “this is my act of love, to be your shield.”\n\nIn the evening, after homework was done, Andrew Madoff would sit at the kitchen table with his father, Bernie. Together they read the newspaper’s business pages. Bernie explained the columns of gray type, the bid price, the ask price, the jagged charts, the markets’ heartbeats, their mood cycles and the underlying forces that propelled it all. This was around the time of Andrew’s bar mitzvah, and, a friend said, there was a manly seriousness to it, an initiation of sorts, complete with the symbols and heavy silences that so often adhere to secrets. Andrew loved those talks. It was already understood that he and his older brother, Mark, would one day join the family business.\n\nThe Madoffs were comfortable by the standards of Roslyn, a wealthy Long Island town with a homey Main Street. Like many Roslyn children, Andrew and Mark had their own cars before they left high school, a Honda Accord and a Chevy Blazer. Small groups of friends would join them for fishing expeditions off the family’s Montauk vacation house. During his senior year, Andrew was editor in chief of the high-school newspaper, The Hilltop Beacon. The staff pasted up the layouts by hand at the Madoff house on Sunday mornings. Andrew’s mother, Ruth, served platters of bagels and lox.\n\nMark went to the University of Michigan, Andrew to Wharton. Mark married his college girlfriend, whose parents were friends of the family. She went on to work in publishing; Andrew married her assistant. Bernie hired his sons to oversee the traders on the 19th floor, near his own glass-walled office. He gave them money to buy lavish homes. He was particular about presenting an orderly, immaculate surface. He did not like shoes on the deck of his 88-foot yacht, Bull, which he kept docked in the south of France. In his closet, he kept 16 shirts tucked into 16 drawers. He would sometimes crawl around the office perimeter on his hands and knees, adjusting the vertical blinds. He liked to walk clients by his sons’ desks on the way to his office. It gave the enterprise a sense of continuity. “You’re the next generation,” a client once told Andrew. “You’ll keep my money safe.” Later, Andrew would look back on this bit of theater and say his father had used him as a “human shield.”\n\nBy this time, Bernie controlled several billion dollars through his money-management business. The exact nature of that business was opaque to almost everyone, save a few back-office staff members who worked on the mysterious 17th floor.\n\nBernie was getting older. He would often stutter or clear his throat in the middle of a conversation, and his eyelids would sometimes blink spasmodically. The sons asked him to teach them how the money-management side of the firm worked and suggested that he drop the “Bernard L.” from the Madoff firm’s name. Bernie rebuffed them. “You guys have your business to worry about,” he would tell his sons. “Let me worry about my business.”\n\nAndrew had a cooler temperament than his brother. He cultivated a trader’s decisiveness and he didn’t waste time equivocating. In 2003, when he learned he had cancer, he emailed his closest friends to tell them not to send sympathy cards or to ask him how he was doing. He would deal with the disease privately.\n\nThe family came apart on the morning of Dec. 10, 2008, in the living room of Bernie’s $7 million penthouse at 133 East 64th Street. Only four people were present — Bernie, Ruth, Mark and Andrew — all of whom maintained that this was the first time the sons heard about Bernie’s fraud. Bernie confessed that the profits from the money-management business, $50 billion accumulating on the statements of Bernie’s clients and closest friends, for decades, were largely imaginary. “I don’t think if he had told me he was an alien, I could’ve been more surprised,” Andrew said later, in an interview with “60 Minutes.” Mark was enraged. Andrew did what he could to master the situation. He embraced Bernie in the living room; it would be the last time. Reduced to the essentials, the decision was easy. He dumped Bernie like a bad stock. The sons called a lawyer, the stepfather of Mark’s ex-wife. He referred them to a colleague, who called the United States attorney’s office. The F.B.I. came for Bernie the next morning. Ruth called her sons and asked them to post bail. The sons said no. She sent their wives jewelry in the mail. The sons turned it over to their lawyer.\n\nHad Andrew and Mark known all along? The press obsessed over this question, and it was worth obsessing over. Andrew was paid $34.2 million between 1993 and 2008, according to legal filings by Irving Picard, the trustee for Madoff’s victims. In addition, the filings say, Andrew invested $569,000 in his father’s side of the business and took out $17 million in profit. One of several lawsuits filed by Picard, who has billed more than $1 billion while settling the estate, claimed that the sons “knew, saw and were simply too intelligent to plausibly feign ignorance about the fraud that was occurring before, by and around them.” Picard’s suit quotes a 2005 email from Andrew to Mark, reading: “Everything is in balance, so we don’t need to worry. I love my job. I love my job. I love my job. Oops, Dad’s calling me again. . . .” But neither son was ever charged with a crime.\n\nAfter his father was arrested and people started speculating about the sons’ guilt, Mark agonized. He felt he was being unfairly pilloried in the press. He began most days before dawn, on the Internet, reading the worst things that had been written about him. Two years after Bernie’s confession, he hanged himself with a dog leash in his SoHo apartment as his infant son slept in the next room. Three years later, in a separate case, a British judge said that Andrew’s and Mark’s “honesty and integrity has been vindicated” and ruled that they were not guilty of any wrongdoing.\n\nAndrew tried to maintain the semblance of a normal life. He had fallen in love with Catherine Hooper, who worked at Urban Angler, a high-end fly-fishing store that he invested in in 2006. She assiduously guided him through the aftermath of his father’s arrest, recruiting an author for “Truth and Consequences,” a family memoir, and sitting with him for interviews with Fortune and People. Andrew gave Hooper advice on a new business she started to help wealthy families plan for emergencies. Hooper introduced him to her friends, one of whom also had a difficult father. Andrew told him to be as open as possible about his own needs. “There have to be boundaries in any relationship,” he said.\n\nAround 2013, the cancer returned. “The scandal and everything that happened killed my brother very quickly,” he said. “It’s killing me slowly.” He was more open this time. He created a password-protected blog for his friends with updates on his treatments. “My life is a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he wrote.\n\nIn an email from prison, Bernie told me that he had written to his sons, apologizing “for the pain and suffering I was causing and betraying their trust.” He received no reply.\n\nOne day in 1946, a black woman showed up at the Vogue School of Modeling in New York, seeking to learn the trade. Her arrival caused a stir. The nascent modeling industry was as deeply segregated as America was then, and she was turned away. At the time, the Vogue School of Modeling did not accept black women. Or so it thought.\n\nUnknown to the school, one was already enrolled: Ophelia DeVore-Mitchell. And she had no idea that Vogue was unaware. “I thought they knew what I was,” DeVore-Mitchell would tell Ebony magazine years later. She had not lied to get in; she was so light-skinned that no one thought to ask. She passed inadvertently. But, if she was harboring a secret intentionally, it was this: DeVore-Mitchell was learning not only how to model but also how to run a school like Vogue. She wanted to take what she was learning to young women in her community, because she believed that the poise and comportment that goes along with modeling also commands respect. “That wasn’t my mission, to be a model,” she said, it “was to have us presented in a way that was not stereotyped.”\n\nYears before “black is beautiful” became a rallying cry, DeVore-Mitchell understood the value of using aesthetics to undermine racist attitudes. While she knew black models would be helpful for selling things to a growing black consumer class, she also felt that they could help send the message that African physiognomy is just as beautiful as any, and thus help communicate to the world that black bodies are valuable, important and precious. She saw modeling as a way to make a difference. “It was the vehicle that I used to communicate a positive image of my people,” she said. “I wanted everybody to be accepted as human beings.”\n\nIn 1946 DeVore-Mitchell started the Grace Del Marco modeling agency in New York. Two years later, she opened the Ophelia DeVore School of Self-Development and Modeling, where she taught thousands of students etiquette, poise, posture, speech and ballet — and beyond that, how to carry themselves in a regal way, how to look people in the eye, how to enter a room and, above all, how to believe in themselves. Prominent black women like Diahann Carroll, Cicely Tyson and Susan Taylor all passed through her orbit, and their dignity and allure testify to DeVore-Mitchell’s talents as an instructor and mentor. Building black self-esteem and a deep appreciation for black aesthetics would be crucial to the civil rights movement, the Black Arts movement and the Black Power movement. But before they were born, DeVore-Mitchell was teaching the world to see black beauty.\n\nLate in life, when asked what she wanted for her grandchildren, Yuri Kochiyama said she hoped they would join “the movement.”\n\nThe apartment in a Harlem housing project where she raised six children with her husband, Bill, came to be known among the movement’s members as Grand Central Station, hosting meetings, receptions, travelers, pilgrims. Kochiyama embraced the causes of the civil rights era, but for her the movement was perpetual, a daily way of life. It was why she routed a 1963 cross-country family trip from New York to California to go through Birmingham, Ala., in tribute to the children slain in a church bombing there. And why in 1977 she was arrested along with Puerto Rican activists occupying the crown of the Statue of Liberty. It is why she spent a year traveling the country in her eighth decade, speaking to thousands on college campuses. The movement was not only constant rallies, plays and poetry readings, but also shared meals, newsletters and friendships. The movement, as Kochiyama described it in a 1970 essay, was “a life-and-death struggle to cast off the shackles of imperialism and colonialism and obliterate racism.”\n\nThe movement may have begun for her when she was still known as Mary Yuriko Nakahara, a lovelorn 22-year-old writing multiple letters each day to her sweetheart, Bill Kochiyama, stationed abroad during World War II. As their daughter Audee recalls, Bill was embarrassed by the onslaught of mail, because some of his bunkmates received little or nothing. He suggested Yuri write occasionally to the other soldiers, and she took up the suggestion with enthusiasm, enlisting a group of teenagers to dispatch postcards. The letter-writers called themselves the Crusaders, and they were Japanese-American inmates of the wartime relocation center in Jerome, Ark. The postcard recipients were Japanese-American soldiers who joined the war effort as loyal citizens while their families were deprived of civil rights at home. The Nakahara family was relocated in 1942, after Yuri’s father was apprehended on unfounded suspicions of collaboration the very day Pearl Harbor was bombed. In later years, Yuri’s preferred term for the Arkansas center was “concentration camp.”\n\nAlong with her husband, she supported the campaign that successfully petitioned the U.S. government for redress to Japanese-American victims of the camps. The energy of her early letter-writing campaign resurfaced in the correspondences she faithfully maintained with political prisoners swept up in the radical actions of the ’60s and ’70s. She often wrote letters late into the night.\n\nIn 1964, Kochiyama joined Malcolm X’s fledgling Organization of Afro-American Unity, formed after his break from the Nation of Islam. It was unusual for a Japanese-American woman to be found among the group’s black nationalists, but she was already a presence in the Harlem civil rights scene. When she and her family moved to the public housing project, they joined their black and Puerto Rican neighbors in the Harlem Parents Committee, agitating for safer streets and better education. While protesting with activists from the Congress of Racial Equality, Kochiyama was arrested along with her eldest son. It was during their court hearing in 1963 that she met Malcolm X, who’d come to show support. Joining a group of admirers flocking to the leader, she asked to shake his hand. During their brief exchange, she challenged his views on separatism, and Malcolm invited her to meet again to discuss it more.\n\nIn February 1965, she attended a rally at Harlem’s Audubon Ballroom convened by Malcolm X. When assailants opened fire on him, she rushed to his aid. Malcolm X’s eldest daughter, Attallah Shabazz, was a 6-year-old witness to the tragedy. “When shots rang out and grown men ran that way” — indicating the opposite direction from where her father had fallen — “I was there,” Shabazz recalled at a memorial for Kochiyama this September. \"Little tiny Yuri Kochiyama somehow or another leapt the stage.” Thus Kochiyama entered public memory in the most anguished of gestures: A photo in Life magazine showed her attending to Malcolm X in his dying moments, cradling his head in her hands.\n\nAfterward she spread his message as she heard it up close. In an essay published two weeks after his death, she wrote: “Denounced as a hater, it is enlightening to note that what Malcolm hated were: tyranny, oppression, disenfranchisement, exploitation; enslavement — whether physical, mental or psychological; race humiliation and stigmatizing; stultifying conditions and limited job opportunities, inferior education and substandard housing for his people; U.S. economic and political aggression internationally; and the degrading of human lives.” It is a good description of their shared commitments; they also shared a birthday.\n\nFor Yuri Kochiyama, the movement wasn’t a series of individualized struggles by discrete interest groups. The movement was perhaps the most basic of human activities: a yearning for righteousness, an expression of love.\n\nIn the beginning, there was a boy. A distracted, disruptive boy — a bad boy, his teachers said. A tall, athletic boy who fought with other kids and threw books around the classroom and talked when he wasn’t supposed to. A boy who stumbled over his words but moved with perfect grace on the basketball court. A boy who read voraciously — Mark Twain, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Samuel Coleridge, Charles Dickens, Dylan Thomas, Honoré de Balzac, James Joyce — even after he dropped out of Stuyvesant High School in New York. A boy whose questing intelligence was engaged in a long and complicated conversation with the books he read, books that made him feel more real than his real life did but that were also silent about black boys like him.\n\n“In truth, everything in my life in 1951 that was personal and had value was white,” Walter Dean Myers later wrote in his memoir “Bad Boy.” It wasn’t until he reached adulthood and read “Sonny’s Blues,” by James Baldwin, a fellow Harlemite, that he felt he had permission to offer the world a narrative with blackness at its core. By then, after a stint in the Army, he was writing seriously. In 1968, his picture-book manuscript for “Where Does the Day Go” won a contest for black writers by the Council on Interracial Books for Children. It was published the following year. Eventually he would write more than a hundred books for young people: lyrical picture books and gritty novels, poetry and short stories, history, biography, memoir, books that earned him nearly every major award children’s publishing had to offer.\n\nLiterature was his one true faith, the lens through which he surveyed every aspect of the human condition. His personal mission: To create literature about the people whose stories had been left off the shelf.\n\n“If we continue to make black children nonpersons by excluding them from books and by degrading the black experience, and if we continue to neglect white children by not exposing them to any aspect of other racial and ethnic experiences in a meaningful way, we will have a next racial crisis,” he predicted in the pages of The Times in 1986.\n\nHe would write about the lack of diversity in children’s literature in The Times again, in March of this year. He was responding to the depressing news that while about half of American children are a race other than white, less than 10 percent of the children’s books published in 2013 were about minorities. He ended his essay with the words, “There is work to be done.”\n\nWork was something he always welcomed, though. Fiercely disciplined, he wrote a minimum of five pages a day until shortly before his death. (Once, when a child asked him what the hardest part about writing was, he said: “There are no hard parts. It’s all work, and you have to put your mind and heart in it. It’s work. It’s all good.”) There was no greater calling, he felt, than to do for others what “Sonny’s Blues” had done for him.\n\nBooks had given him both an identity and a way to affect the world, his son, Christopher Myers, told me recently. “He felt that he owed books a repayment,” he said. “All his books were about rendering the invisible visible.”\n\nIn 1944, Alice Herz-Sommer, a well-known Czech pianist, received an admiring review of a concert she had recently performed. “She does not belong to the world of piano devils for whom virtuosity is both a goal and a form of self-satisfaction,” wrote the composer Viktor Ullmann. “She has more warmth than flashiness.”\n\nHerz-Sommer — her friends called her Gigi — savored his praise, but no music-loving member of the public would see the review for years. Ullmann’s writing was distributed only in the distorted ecosystem where he and Herz-Sommer then lived, along with hundreds of other Jewish musicians, artists and actors. They had all been sent to Terezín, a German-run ghetto an hour from Prague, which the Nazis claimed was a haven for the Jewish cultural elite and the elderly but was, in fact, a concentration camp. When the Red Cross wanted to tour a German camp, the Nazis showed them a superficially refurbished, picturesque Terezín; behind a humane facade, there was starvation, rampant sickness and freezing conditions. The place had a diabolical logic: There, some of the region’s most gifted artists were forced to deliver exalted performances as a form of propaganda.\n\n“When I say we didn’t eat, you must believe me,” Herz-Sommer, at 98, told the filmmaker Christopher Nupen, recalling the camp she entered at age 40. “In the morning, there was black water, which was coffee; at lunch, white water, which was soup. Dinner, again, black water. We were skin and bones.” She told him she would not speak of the atrocities that occurred, but they have been recorded elsewhere: Tens of thousands of people died of disease and malnourishment, and close to 90,000 — including Herz-Sommer’s husband, Leopold — were deported from there to other camps, where a majority were murdered.\n\nBefore the war, Herz-Sommer’s rigorously disciplined pursuit of beauty made her one of the most accomplished pianists in Prague. At Terezín, she hardly relaxed that commitment to grace, not only in her playing but also in caring for her son, Raphael, who was 6 when they arrived. At night, unable to play Chopin’s Étude in E Major on the piano to lull him to sleep, she hummed it, the two of them jammed onto one mattress in a room full of people. They whispered multiplication tables to each other after the lights went out. Reassuring her son, she encouraged him to sing in a children’s opera, “Brundibár,” that was produced at the camp; during the day, in an icy practice room, she enthusiastically prepared for dozens of concerts that the musicians were expected to play for guards and inmates alike.\n\n“This is my food,” Herz-Sommer said to Nupen, explaining why, well into her late 90s, she still practiced piano for hours every day. She meant it figuratively, but at Terezín, the meaning could be more literal: A Czech guard who was delighted by her rendering of a gigue in a Bach partita thanked her with an extra portion of soup.\n\nMany survivors of Terezín recalled with reverence the concerts in which Herz-Sommer performed, from memory, 24 of Chopin’s études — physically demanding pieces that she undertook even though she was diminished by months of hunger. Willy Mahler (a relative of the composer Gustav), also a prisoner, wrote in his diary about an older couple reacting to Herz-Sommer’s playing the first étude. The wife clutched her husband’s hand “and pressed her tear-stained face into it,” he wrote. To Herz-Sommer, the études represented profound philosophical reinforcement, a reminder of the fullness of human experience. “There is everything in them,” she said. “Everything: all human life and all sensation.”\n\nHerz-Sommer and Raphael left Terezín when the war ended in 1945, and eventually they moved to Israel, where she renewed her dedication to studying and teaching music, an example that Raphael followed: He grew up to become a much-admired solo cellist. His mother’s force of will, he said, made it possible for him to emerge from the camp emotionally intact: “She built a strong wall around me out of love and gave me such security that I could not find anything extraordinary in our lives,” he wrote in an introduction to “Alice’s Piano,” a biography of her life by Melissa Müller and Rinehard Piechocki.\n\nHerz-Sommer moved to London in 1986, following Raphael when his performing career led him there. In a small apartment around the corner from him and his family, she continued to practice, teaching piano to one of her two grandsons, Ariel, and urging him to dedicate himself to music. She never talked of the abuses she saw at Terezín and conveyed her feelings about that time only obliquely, sometimes in letters. “Beethoven was the most unhappy person,” she wrote to Ariel when he was away at school, “but gives to us in his music, hope, strength, faith, he wants to say: Life is worthwhile, even when it is very, very difficult.” Her letters convey a sense of urgency, almost an anxiety: not that he would suffer or fall ill, the lingering terrors of many survivors, but that he would fail to appreciate fully the art that gave her own life meaning.\n\nRaphael died unexpectedly of an aortic aneurysm at age 64. She grieved, but kept playing. Suffering from arthritis in two fingers, she attacked the études once more, relearning them all with a new technique for eight fingers. Discipline, beauty: They sustained her and drove her on. In her last years, with her sight failing, she relied on memory, which restricted her repertoire but not her dedication. She played until the last weeks of her life; at the time of her death at age 110, she was thought to be the oldest living survivor of a concentration camp.\n\nMany musical talents who passed through Terezín died, including almost all the children who performed in “Brundibár.” But Herz-Sommer believed that music had made survival possible for her and for her son. “It protected us from hate,” she wrote, “and literally nourished our souls.”"
