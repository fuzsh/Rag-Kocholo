        "text": "Written by Jake on Sunday, June 14, 2015\n\nIf you've been reading my blog for a while, you'll know that Ardoch House is a massive fascination of mine ! It began because I used to search for bones on the old Ardoch Estate, which is the nearest wood to my village, and I discovered the old ice houses there. After I blogged about that in 2011, Mr Forbes in Canada emailed me, because he had visited the old Ardoch estate in 1984 while researching his family history, found the derelict house, but when he came back in 1989 the house had completely vanished !\n\nI blogged about the mystery of where it had gone in 2012, and did some more research at RCHAMS shortly after. I also blogged about the old Roman Fort, which was next to the house, and how I found an ancient tunnel, as well as researching the Ardoch House murder. Every time I have done a new post I have had emails from people who have been researching their family history, and found a connection to Ardoch House.\n\nSince then I have done a lot of research through newspaper archives, so I decided to put everything I found in one place, which I will update whenever I find something new. I know it's not bones or wildlife - but I'll be back to that with my next post !\n\nVery important !\n\nThis Ardoch House is the one in Braco, Perthshire.

The National Archives of Scotland have \"Policy of insurance against fire issued by the Edinburgh Friendly Insurance to Sir William Stirling of Ardoch, bt., for his mansion house of Ardoch, newly built\" listed here.\n\nOr was it built in 1793 ? The Scottish Architects website says so and that the architect was William Stirling I (1772-1838). It says \"William Stirling I was born at Dunblane on 15 October 1772, the eldest son of James Stirling, wright and cabinetmaker, who came of a long-established Dunblane merchant family which may have had landed connections. He commenced practice as an architect builder as his father's partner c.1798, the firm then becoming James Stirling & Son, although William Stirling I practised solely under his own name from the early years of the nineteenth century. On 4 December 1803 at Kirkintilloch he married Jean Erskine, daughter of David Erskine, WS of Dundas & Wilson, who had died in 1791; her maternal grandmother was Mrs Graham of Airth, who was a Stirling of Ardoch. This brought family links with other branches of the Erskine, Stirling and Graham families, and with the related Masterton family, resulting in him gaining the architectural business of the Linlathen, Airth, Gartmore, Ardoch, Braco, Gogar and Strowan estates in addition to those of Kippendavie, Kippenross, Tillicoultry, Airthrey, Tullibody, Dunira and Cardross.\n\n\"\n\nAnne Stirling (owned 1799 - 1820)\n\nWhen Sir William Stirling, 4th Bt of Ardoch died in 1799, it was inherited by his daughter Anne Stirling (1761-1820).

Some accounts say he didn't inherit until the early 1830s, but he certainly had by 1834. Major Moray Stirling not mentioned in newspapers before 1821\n\nMajor Moray went to Edinburgh to complete education then joined the army at 14. one of his first campaigns was in East Indies. He spent five or six years there, then served ten years in India, then went to South America, then was injured at Waterloo\n\nIn 1824 Major Moray Stirling's servant died when coming home with horse and gig from Bridge of Allan, and a dog scared the horse, throwing the rider 30ft off a bridge.\n\n1826 October 18 - Major Moray Stirling married Hon Frances Elizabeth, at Bothwell Castle.\n\nIn 1826 there was an additional bit was built according to RCAHMS. This seems to be another bit added to the stables and they were designed by William Stirling.\n\nIn 1828 a new wing was added to the house and was designed by William Stirling II (1789-1876). This brought the hose to a dining room, drawing room, library, smoking room, 11 bedrooms, 5 dressing rooms, 4 bathrooms\n\nSeptember 1833 - The gamekeepers deputation for Major Moray Stirling was said to be. Joseph Hume.\n\nIn 1834 there was the first mention in the Caledonian Mercury of Sir George Murray who visited Ardoch House on a way up north and was well received by Major M Stirling and Lady, then heard sermon at Ardoch Chapel.\n\nIn 1836 Major Moray Stirling's name was mentioned as an \"ultra-Tory\" to represent Perthshire conservatiives, alongside Home Drummond, to follow Sir George Stirling\n\nIn November 1838 it was reported the mail coach overturned between Bishops Bridge (six miles north) and Ardoch\n\nIn 1839 Major Moray Stirling' s overseer was James Bird\n\nIn 1840 The Sporting magazine said there was a fox hunt near the place.\n\nIn February 1842 there was a Grand Curling Match \"on the lakes at Ardoch\".

Her husband was Henry Home Drummond Home)\n\nWhen Major Moray Stirling died in 1850 the male line ended, because he had no children, and his brothers James and Charles had died in 1840 and 1820 respectively. His sister Christian (1779-1864) inherited. She married Henry Home Drummond Home .

I'm expecting to re-visit Scotland later this year after an absence of 50 years. My father, John Price, was General Manager of Kier and Cawder Estates which with Ardoch Estate was owned by Col. William (Bill) Stirling at the time. I was free to roam over the estate provided that I behaved myself and didn't upset the gamekeeper.\n\nI recall that the cellars at the rear of derelict Ardoch House were used as an enormous silage pit; I remember the ice-house next to the lake where I was allowed to use the dinghy to fish in the long summer evenings provided the laird didn't want to use it. Old Tom McNaughton was the gamekeeper before he retired early in the 60's.\n\nAlso, I remember the Forbes family children Ronnie and Wendy and an older brother who studied Medicine at the time.
