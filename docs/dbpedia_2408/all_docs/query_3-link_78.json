        "text": "Overview of the Collection\n\nRepository: G. W. Blunt White Library, Mystic Seaport Creator: Skiddy, William Taylor Title: William T. Skiddy Collection Dates: 1710 [1805]-1885 Extent: 131 pieces; 8 volumes Abstract: Personal and business papers, journals, marine drawings, and sketchbooks of William Taylor Skiddy, primarily concerning naval activities; expeditions and political involvement in Peru; and shipbuilding activities. Identification: Coll. 304\n\nBiography of William Taylor Skiddy\n\nWilliam T. Skiddy was born as William Taylor, ca. 1795, to Justus William Taylor and Rosetta (Place) Taylor in Peekskill, New York. Captain Justus Taylor died of yellow fever in 1799. After Justus died Rosett married John R. Skiddy, a ship captain of Stamford, Connecticut and New York City, who adopted William, so his name became Skiddy.\n\nWilliam T. Skiddy was an artist, naval architect, Captain and an entrepreneur. In 1805 at the age of ten he signed on as a cabin boy aboard the packet ship the ROSE-IN-BLOOM. After a voyage to Charleston, S.C. he returned to New York City and become a cabin boy and then an assistant steward for his step-father.\n\nWith the exception of his three years of schooling in France he stayed in the merchant service until 1812. He spent eight months as a prisoner of war when the crew of the Brig STEPHEN was captured by the british frigate ANDROMACHE. The day after his release he joined the US Navy and received his Midshipman’s commission from President Madison. Captain James Lawrence ordered him to report to the HORNET as a master-mate where he served under the command of Captain James Biddle for the duration of the war. While on board he sketched a few of the significant battles that the HORNET had participated in.\n\nIn 1816 he returned to merchant service where he was given the command of the ship MARIA THERESA. He was in the South Pacific during the blockade of Callao by Lord Cochrane, at which time he ran the blockade and brought away the Spanish Viceroy of Peru.\n\nDuring his many voyages along the Pacific coast he surveyed and charted many of the ports he visited.\n\nIn 1826 he was given command of the packet ship HENRI IV, a Havre packet, and continued in this service until 1847 when he retired from the sea.\n\nIn 1844 he entered into the naval construction business with his half-brother Francis. Soon after he was appointed by the US government to superintend the construction of the Collins steamers, which were used as mail steamers.\n\nDuring his life at sea, Capt. Skiddy kept a journal, and at some point in his life he transcribed them into two volumes entitled “The Ups and Downs of a Sea Life from 1805”.\n\nOn November 26, 1841 he married Mary Ann Anderson (1810-1880) and together they had five children, Mary Skiddy Quintard (1844-1898), William Wheelwright Skiddy (1845-1928), Lilly Butler Skiddy Marden (1847-1880), Alice Skiddy (1847-1862), and Francis Skiddy (1851-1852). His final years were spent at home in Stamford where he died on July 26, 1870.\n\nTop →\n\nRestrictions\n\nRestrictions on Access\n\nAvailable for use in the Manuscripts Division\n\nRestrictions on Use\n\nVarious copying restriction apply.
