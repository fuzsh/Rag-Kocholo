        "text": "Our History\n\nHistory of the Unitarian Society of Germantown\n\nUSG Timeline\n\nThe Archives Corner\n\nThe Unitarian Society of Germantown was founded in 1865. Without a divine charter or blueprint, the members have always had to rely on their own individual and collective capacity for self-generation or self-renewal.\n\nEarly Unitarianism in Philadelphia was inspired by English Unitarianism, embodied in teachings brought to these shores by the Rev. Dr. Joseph Priestley. Dr. Priestley’s religious ideas took root in the First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia in 1796. Historically Unitarianism incorporated the ideas of God as one (Unity) and Jesus as great prophet and teacher. Many members of the new congregation in Germantown had been members of the First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia.\n\nFrom 1865 to 1871, our founders braved an unwelcoming community climate to gather a new congregation. Our first minister had difficulty finding a place to live because of this. However, the church gained strength in the years up to 1883. A church building was constructed in 1867 at the corner of Greene and Chelten. We pioneered in community help with the Germantown Relief Society. The Sunday School was formed and grew, and today’s Women’s Alliance took shape first as the Samuel Longfellow Alliance. The period from 1884 to 1916 was one of marking time. Still surviving from that age, remarkably, is the Nicetown Club for Boys and Girls, first conceived of by our minister, the Reverend Oscar Hawes in 1902.\n\nA resurgence followed in the years from 1917 to 1935 when the enthusiasm generated brought members in such numbers as to require a new church building. This was constructed at 6511 Lincoln Drive and was dedicated in 1928. Included in the new building were several stained glass windows from the former building. Three lancets, once separate windows, were placed together as Clark Window I on the east transept wall. The Clark Window II graces our south transept wall. Many successful programs flourished including the Unitarian Universalist House, a home for senior citizens, which was greatly expanded from the original Joseph Priestley House. It is now closed, but a program called UU House Outreach continues to work with older adults in a variety of ways to help them remain independent in their own homes as long as possible.\n\nThe Ecumenical Pulpit era from 1936 to 1964, with a ministerial stewardship, was a remarkable period that brought some of the most highly respected theologians, philosophers and thinkers to visit with us on Sunday mornings. The congregation involved itself in humanitarian efforts related to World War II, and the church became the center for Red Cross work for the Germantown/Mt. Airy section. It bought and rehabilitated 6503 Lincoln Drive as a total Religious Education building [since sold], and created the Austin Youth Lodge out of a caved-in stable. It put a specially designed tracker organ in the balcony, established a church pension plan and built a badly needed parking lot. It grew past the 800 mark and withdrew from the Philadelphia Council of Churches because of a newly imposed creedal test.\n\nThe 1965 Centennial Celebration of the Society’s existence was a high point of reaffirmation and rededication to liberal religion. The publication of an updated church history was a significant aspect of the celebration.\n\nThe years from 1965 on may be seen as a time of reformulation and redefinition. There has been constant ministerial leadership with growing emphasis on denominational identification. The Child Spiritual Development program for children and youth provides community and meaning with an engaging and rewarding curricula. A network of committees has been staffed with on-going volunteer support for many activities. These have ranged widely, including Adult Spiritual Development classes, social events, Social Justice projects, and leadership development conferences. Worship has become more multicultural with celebrations of the Jewish High Holy Days, Dia de los Muertos (the Day of the Dead), Kwanzaa, New Orleans Jazz Funeral among others. And the music in worship has also come from more diverse sources over the years. Celebrations of Passover Seder and Diwali were also begun.\n\nIn April of 1978, the congregation celebrated the present church building’s Golden Anniversary. A meaningful portion of the ceremonies included the deposit of mementos and messages in a time chamber that was later embedded in the chancel floor, to be opened in the year 2028.\n\nUSG continued its activity in the local community as a member of the Northwest Interfaith Movement (NIM) which no longers exists. The congregation began an affiliation with Lingelbach school and participates in the Philadelphia Interfaith Hospitality Network (PIHN) now Family Promise, an interfaith program that provides shelter, support, and encouragement for homeless families. USG officially became a Welcoming Congregation to those in the LGBT (Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender) communities in 1998 and renewed its commitment in 2017 including QIA (Queer, Intersex and Asexual) communities as well. In 2017, USG began to address White Supremacy culture along with the rest of the denomination.\n\nThe Unitarian Society of Germantown provides an ideal place for people with a variety of experiences, backgrounds and beliefs to come together to examine what each has to offer in the search for self and larger meaning. It continues to be a place for love and fellowship, a place for understanding and acceptance, a place for growing and improving, and for living our faith in the surrounding community and world.\n\nPlease see the timeline below for details.\n\nTimeline of the History of the Unitarian Society of Germantown\n\n(as well as some Unitarian and Universalist history and notes on parallel world events)\n\n1793\n\nThe Universalist Church of America was founded.\n\n1825\n\nAmerican Unitarian Association was founded.\n\n1863\n\nOlympia Brown is ordained by Universalist convention, first woman to be ordained in the US.\n\n1864\n\nFuture USG members were among the 360 influential white leaders who signed the “Petition for the Colored People of Philadelphia to Ride in the Cars”.

Dr. Furness [First Church] in the city of Philadelphia, others belonging to the Society of Friends, and others deeply interested in the cause of Christianity, ─all feeling an earnest desire to afford their families the advantages of a religious ministration more liberal than the existing churches in Germantown afforded, resolved upon establishing a church which should to some extent meets their wants and desires.”\n\nLincoln assassinated\n\nCivil War ends\n\n13th Amendment to the Constitution abolishes slavery\n\n1867\n\nNew church building dedicated Chelten Ave & Greene St. Designed by Frank Furness, son of Rev.

USG objected, saying that “the Conference was purely an advisory body ‘possessing neither the right nor title to express in any authoritative way the beliefs of the various churches represented in its councils, and that the unchangeable principle upon which Congregationlism was founded is the inviolable right to the individual church to fix its own form of belief…’” This point of view was unanimously agreed to by the conference.\n\n1902\n\nBeacon Press was established.\n\n1903\n\nParsonage purchased at 5226 Greene Street.

Joseph Chapline gives monthly organ recitals. Rev Daskam retires. He had invited Rev Dr Martin Luther King, Jr and Desmond Tutu to preach from our pulpit. He was a beloved minister and dynamic leader at USG who did much for the church and its congregants. His time here heralded a time of change and struggle. One aspect of his tenure was visiting with potential members in their homes. A man of his time and a man of the people he served (as were his predecessors), Reverend Daskam was known to suggest to African American folks who were attending USG that they might be more comfortable in a church in their neighborhoods. Several of the people who were subjected to this treatment made USG their home.

Winston Churchill dies. Malcolm X assassinated. Social Security Act establishes Medicare and Medicaid. Voting Rights Act is signed. Watts Riots.\n\n1966\n\nCultural Revolution in China.\n\n1967\n\nBlack Affairs Council (BAC) established at the Unitarian Universalist Association. Rev David Parke helped to establish FULLBAC, an organization of white UU leaders supporting the demands of the BAC.\n\nBlack members of USG and Restoration joined together to form a Black Caucus, alternated which church they met at. Performed skits about racism in all the UU churches in the area.\n\nCooperative Nursery School started in the Austin Youth Lodge. The goal was to have an equal racial, gender and socioeconomic mix of children. It was initially sponsored by USG. USG members participate in March on Washington against the Vietnam War.\n\n1968\n\nUUA voted to support the BAC with $250,000 a year, to fight political repression and economic exploitation in the Black community and support black cultural expressions and community education, as they had requested. Parke later wrote “I have never felt prouder of my church than when our overwhelmingly white denomination said ‘Yes’ to it’s militant Black minority.”\n\n1969\n\nAt the 1969 General Assembly in Boston, the funding to BAC was greatly reduced resulting in many Black congregants leaving UU churches (even William Sinkford, an eventual president of the UUA, left the movement at that time.) Many members of the congregation were unhappy with David Parke’s prominent role in this divisive issue.\n\nUS Astronauts land on the moon.\n\n1970\n\nWhen the USG nominating committee didn’t nominate a black member, 55 members submitted a petition nominating Eversly Vaughn for trustee of the Board. “We regard this as one step in the direction of full and participatory sharing by both Black and white people in all roles of leadership in this society. In a church with both Black and white members, in a community where Black and white people live as neighbors, and in a time when full empowerment of Black people is of critical importance, it is unacceptable that the affairs of this church should be administered by a Board of Trustees composed only of white people.” Eversley Vaughn received almost 400 more votes than the nominating committee’s candidate.\n\nThis was a year of division in the church, there were financial difficulties and the Board was struggling to work effectively with Rev. Parke. The Board decided to ask Rev. Parke to resign. Some of the reasons for the short tenure of Rev Parke’s ministry might have been the church’s struggle with the transition from the Ecumenical Pulpit to a minister who preached most Sundays and whose sermons weren’t necessarily as polished as those of the guest speakers. He was also not as skilled a manager as Rev. Daskam who had done it for 40 years. And he preached many sermons on the great moral issues of the day: racism, the Vietnam War, Apartheid in South Africa among others, which weren’t topics everyone wanted to hear about on Sunday mornings. Many people of color left the church when David Parke left. David Parke later spent many years as an interim minister and said that USG and his ministry would have benefitted from an interim minister, but the program did not exist in 1965.\n\nThe Neighborhood Interfaith Movement (NIM) is founded. It “promoted vibrant, healthy neighborhoods in Philadelphia by uniting faith, business, civic and community partners with neighbors to advocate for social justice and serve people in need.”\n\nNo one remembers exactly when the Service Auction started, but there is consensus that it was happening in the 70s. It was a much smaller affair in the beginning: two pages typed and items were picked up from people’s homes.\n\nGround-breaking About Your Sexuality (AYS) curriculum published, eventually leading to lawsuits for obscenity. Black Affairs Council disaffiliates from UUA; many African American UUs begin drifting away.\n\n1971\n\nRev. Pete Peterson was called as the Interim minister, people really liked him and felt he in helped the congregation heal from the discord in the congregation around David Parke’s ministry. Many in the congregation were sad that he was not allowed, by the rules governing Interim ministers, to stay.\n\n1973\n\nRev. Arthur Jellis was called as a settled minister. Had a history supporting civil rights in the south. Had a troubled tenure at the church, membership had dropped to about 60 people, was asked to resign in 1978. Members who were unhappy with Arthur Jellis created an alternate service rather than leave the church. Many felt Jellis to be judgmental about homosexuality and felt that his attitude helped clarify for the congregation that they were in support of acceptance and rights for gay people. Some felt USG had developed a reputation as a church that couldn’t keep a minister, that is was a “problem congregation.” Sylvia Blackwell, an African American woman was elected President of the Board.\n\nUUA Office for Gay Affairs created\n\n1974\n\nUU Principles updated.\n\nNixon resigns.\n\n1975\n\nFall of South Vietnam.\n\nDeath of Mao Zedong.\n\nAbortion is legalized in the US.\n\n1976 The first microcomputer is built in Steve Job’s garage.\n\n1978\n\n50 Year celebration of 6511 Lincoln Dr building included the placing of a Time Capsule\n\n1979\n\nVoices, a booklet of USG member’s poetry, was created. Rev. John McKinnon was called as an Interim minister, helped the congregation heal after Arthur Jellis.\n\nEddilera Kinzer joined USG. She was an African American daughter and grand daughter of AME ministers who became very active at USG, NIM and in the UUA and was particularly focused on supporting ministers of color.\n\nTo ease tensions after the abrupt resignation of Rev. Jellis, the Service/Item Auction was combined with a Gong Show, with some scheduled “gonged” acts, and some real ones, including a Gut Bucket Band of six church members, who were bought by another member to play at a block party. The member-auctioneers kept up a steady chatter as items and events were sold off so successfully the auction continued to be a larger scale annual fund-raising event.\n\nMargaret Thatcher becomes Prime Minister of Great Britain. The Shah is overthrown in Iran.\n\n1980\n\nRev. Dr. Bill Gardiner was called as a settled minister. His time at USG was felt to be a great success. He was particularly focused on social justice.
