HENRY OSBORNE, who represented the Eastern Division of Camden in the late Legislative Council, has been elected to the new Assembly as one of two members now allotted to the constituency under the Constitutional Act.\n\nMr Osborne was born in the county of Tyrone, Ireland, on the 8th of February, 1803, and is consequently fifty-three years of age. He is the son of ARCHIBALD OSBORNE, ESQ., of Dirnaseer in that county, and the youngest of ten children, three of whom emigrated to New South Wales, and became settlers in the fertile district of Illawarra. Mr. Osborne arrived in this country on the 9th May, 1829, and may, therefore be reckoned among the old colonists. In those days, as is well-known, it was the policy of Government to encourage emigrants with capital with free grants of land. On making the usual application, Mr. Osborne received a grant to the extent of 2,560 acres, which forms the beautiful estate now embellished with his family seat, and known as Marshall Mount. Subsequently an additional grant to the same extent was made to Mr. Osborne, on condition that improvements to five times the estimated value of the original grant should be effected on the first donation. Thus happily settled on one of the richest and most favoured spots in the colony, Mr. Osborne would have been a man of most perverse understanding, if he had not set lustily to work improving his good fortune. Being naturally of a resolute character, he brought his energies at once to bear upon the capabilities of his newly acquired property, and was soon extensively engaged in pastoral and agricultural operations. The result has been that Mr. Osborne is now at the head of a numerous and respectable tenantry in his own county, and had become the possessor of very large squatting concerns beyond the settled districts.\n\nOn the 2nd of December 1839, Mr. Osborne started out from his residence at Dapto as one of the pioneers, who, about that time, determined on forcing their way overland, to find a market for their surplus stock in the young colony of South Australia. Mr. Osborne and his party were four months on their journey through unknown and dangerous country, beset by native tribes; but they arrived in safety, without any collision or serious accident. CAPTAIN GREY, now SIR GEORGE GREY, Governor of the Cape of Good Hope, in his work on the colonies, spoke of the gentlemen engaged in the overland traffic, in the following terms: - “The overlanders are, nearly all of them, in the prime of life; and their occupation is to convey large herds of stock from one market to another, and from colony to colony. They have overcome difficulties of no ordinary kind, which have made the more timid-hearted quail and relinquish the enterprises in which they were engaged; while the resolute and undaunted have persevered, and the reward they have obtained is wealth, self-confidence in difficulties and dangers, and a fund of accurate information in many interesting points. Hence, almost every Overlanded you meet is a remarkable man.\n\nAt the general election in 1851, Mr. Osborne offered himself up as a candidate for the representation of East Camden; - he was opposed by MR. WILSHIRE, the present member for the city of Sydney. The result of the contest was the election of Mr. Osborne, by a large majority of votes. In the Legislative Council, Mr. Osborne, not unnaturally, bearing in mind the facts we have just stated, took his stand upon what may be termed the conservative interest. “Change is a word of ill sound to happy ears” said a philosopher and statesman of the last age; and it is no wonder that Mr. Osborne should exemplify the truth of this aphorism by a visible horror at the disturbing efforts of those who have not yet “ample room is this delightful land”.\n\nIn 1828, Mr. Osborne married SARAH, daughter of the REV. BENJAMIN MARSHALL of the same county in Ireland by whom he has a living family of twelve children, nine sons and three daughters. In private life, Mr. Osborne is esteemed for his unostentatious charity and his correct deportment in discharge of his social duties; and he must be among the wealthiest of our country gentlemen. On the 31st March Mr. Osborne was elected at the head of the poll as one of the present members for East Camden, there being five other candidates for the two seats. (Illawarra Mercury)\n\nJOHN DINNING\n\n(From the U. S. Western Christian Advocate)\n\n[The following biographical sketch is published in compliance with the earnest solicitation of several persons resident in Illawarra who were relatives of the late John Dinning.]\n\nBrother Dinning was born February 12, 1798, in the parish of Kilskarry (sic), county Tyrone. Ireland. He was blessed with a pious mother who was converted to God in the days of Wesley. The ministry of some of the noble, self-sacrificing preachers of the Wesleyan Methodist connection made a deep and lasting impression on young Dinning’s mind in the early days of Methodism............the REV. GIDEON OUSELY, one of the Irish missionaries in particular. We here insert an extract of a letter, written by his friend and companion, REV. RICHARD CROZIER, relative to his conversion and early religious experience: - “In the latter part of the year 1815, in the midst of a glorious revival of religion that was conducted by MATTHEW STEWART and JAMES OLIVE, Brother Dinning was converted, and joined the church. Shortly after he was appointed class-leader and exhorter..........”. In the spring of 1818 he bid his friends and native land adieu, in company with the above-named friend. ...........arrived New York. He left New York in the fall of this year and moved to Virginia, and settled on a farm in Giles county, where he lived for fifteen years. Two years subsequently he was joined in holy matrimony to MARY HETHERINGTON, who shared his joys and sorrows till death severed the bonds of their union. ................ in the fall of 1835 he and his family moved to Attica, Indiana, and in the spring of 1836, he moved to Highland county, Ohio, and settled near Sugar-Tree Ridge. Here as elsewhere, he continued to exercise his gifts and graces in the cause of his Master........................For forty-one years, it may be said of him he was a faithful, zealous member of the Methodist Episcopal Church, a lover and firm supporter of her doctrines and discipline. (Illawarra Mercury)\n\nDEATH OF HENRY OSBORNE, ESQ., J.P.\n\nIt is with deep and sincere sorrow we announce the death of HENRY OSBORNE, ESQ., of Marshall Mount, which melancholy event took place, about 7 p.m., at his late residence..............had suffered for several months from a most severe and harassing attack. His death will plunge a numerous family and a most extensive circle of relatives into grief and mourning..............it will remove from over a numerous tenantry, a considerate landlord. In his manner, Mr. Osborne was to all men, frank, genial and open.......his intellect strong and read;, in business he was shrewd, active and enterprising. Mr. Osborne occupied a seat, as the representative of these districts, in the last Councils under the old regime and in the late Parliament. ...........in and out of the political arena, he was kind and courteous to all.\n\nHe was ahumble and devout member of the Church of England. In his last illness he was vivited by His Lordship BISHOP BARKER.\n\nIndependent of his large freehold agricultural and coalmining properties in these districts, he leaves considerable property in the metropolis, and he was one of the most extensive squatters in the colony.............Mr. Osborne was born in the county Tyrone, Ireland, on the 8th February, 1803, his father being ARCHIBALD OSBORNE, ESQ., of Dirnaseer, in that county; he was the youngest of ten children. Thus, at the time of his death, he had but shortly entered his 56th year. He married in 1828, SARAH, daughter of the REV. BENJAMIN MARSHALL, of his own county. In the following year he left for this colony...........when he died he had been upwards of 29 years in the colony. His lady, and fourteen of their fifteen children survive the loss of a most devoted husband, and a good father. (Illawarra Mercury)\n\nParents: Archibald Osborne & Jane (NSWRBMD)]\n\nOBITUARY: REV. JAMES COLLINS – Died at his residence, Tyrone Villa, Grafton, Clarence River, on Thursday, the 7th instant, after an illness of about two months, during the last fortnight of which he was confined to his house, the REV. JAMES COLLINS, Presbyterian minister, in the sixty-third year of his age. Mr. Collins was a native of the county of Tyrone, in the north of Ireland, and emigrated to this colony with his large family at his own charges, in the year 1854, having been engaged for a series of years as an itinerant minister and missionary, chiefly among the navvies along the new lines of railway in the central counties of England. On his arrival in New South Wales, he was stationed as a Presbyterian minister, under the Synod of New South Wales, at Balmain, where he officiated with acceptance for about two years; but on the death of the REV. ROBERT MILLER, of Grafton, in the year 1856, he was appointed to the Clarence and Richmond Rivers district, where he remained till his death. Mr. Collins had a natural talent for expounding the Scriptures, which he did occasionally with great originality of thought and fluency of language, as also addressing the humbler classes of people; and his labours as an itinerant minister on both rivers will not be forgotten by not a few in the district. He died in peace, giving himself up into the hands of a faithful Creator. His funeral, which took place on the 8th instant, was attended by a large concourse of people from Grafton and its vicinity, who thereby testified to their respect and esteem for the deceased. (The Empire)\n\nINQUEST: CHARLES WILSON – The City Coroner held an inquest yesterday afternoon, at his office, on the body of a man CHARLES WILSON, lying dead at the Sydney Infirmary. ANNE ELLIS deposed that she resides at No. 1, Little Forster-street, of Macquarie-street South. The dead body now lying at the infirmary is that of her brother, Charles Wilson. He was twenty-eight years of age, and a native of Tyrone, Ireland. He was a drayman and was not married. Deceased was in the employ of MR. GORDON, of Cumberland-street. Deceased was a sober, steady man. Witness never knew him to take too much drink. JOHN RICHARD LINSLEY deposed that he lives in Lower Fort-street. Knew deceased. On the 24th August, about 6 o’ clock in the evening, while he was at Mr. Gordon’s stables, there were four bags of corn on the ground, which were to be put up in the loft. Witness lent Mr. Gordon a rope to hoist the corn, and assisted by Mr. Gordon, Wilson and a man in witness’ employ to lift the corn up. They had taken up three bags (3-bushel bags) full of corn. ..............the chain which fastened the block to the projecting beam gave way, and the bag, rope and block fell, breaking the leg above the ankle. ............Every possible care was taken of him, and he appeared to progress favourable until four days ago, when lockjaw set him, and the man died that morning. Deceased appeared to be a sober, steady, good-hearted, honest man. The jury returned a verdict to the effect that Charles Wilson died from tetanus from injuries accidently received. (The Empire)\n\nTHE LATE JOHN WILLIAM CORDNER\n\n..........The late Mr. Cordner is widely regretted............a distinguished Professor of Music. WILLIAM JOHN CORDNER was born in the town of Dungannon, County Tyrone, Ireland in the year 1826. He was the second son of SAMUEL CORDNER who had been for years, organist to the parish (Episcopalian) church of Dungannon............when he was seven years of age he could play the organ and sing with considerable expression. The dormant desire of his young life was to be a chorister; and a chorister he became in the venerable Cathedral of Armagh. It was fortunate that the young musical enthusiast that he was placed under a rigid master – MR. JAMES TURLE – but one who had the happy talent of stimulating the efforts of genius while he repressed his extravagances. Finding his father – who was a stern conscientious man – averse to satisfying his son’s desire, young Cordner did what hundreds of boys of his temperament had done before – he ran away to sea. Of course he was disenchanted after a time, but not till he had undergone great privations – privatations which undermined a fine constitution..............it was not till ague laid him low in India, some six or seven years after he had left the old folks at home ............he returned from India and settled in Armagh, where he became a popular teacher of music and was esteemed the best tenor singer in the North of Ireland..............in 1854, he emigrated to Australia. Shortly after his arrival in Sydney he became organist at St. Patrick’s Roman Catholic Church, the Rev. Dean Sumner being pastor. Two years subsequently he was appointed organist to St. Mary’s Cathedral, an office he held until his death. He was married some ten years ago to a lady who is professionally known as the best contralto in the Australian colonies. Mr. Cordner was a modest man................... (Evening News)\n\nTHE MURDERER [ROBERT] CAMPBELL. – From Wagga Wagga it is reported by the Express of Wednesday, that on Saturday last, a telegram was received by MR. MONTEITH, the governor of the gaol, from the Sheriff of the colony, announcing that the last sentence of the law would be carried into effect upon the condemned criminal CAMPBELL, alias PALMER, on Tuesday, the 10th of January next. The intelligence was at once communicated to the prisoner, who received it with perfect calmness and composure, having daily been expecting it since he learnt that the points received in his favour at the trial had been decided against him by the full Court in Sydney, The sentence will be carried out within the precincts of the gaol, and, in accordance of the law of the colony, will be private, the officers of the gaol and a few other spectators alone witnessing the fatal scene. The prisoner is, to all appearance, perfectly resigned to his fate, but neither denies nor acknowledges his guilt, and but seldom even alludes to the murder of which he stands convicted. He professes the Roman Catholic faith, and some weeks since was visited in his cell by a priest of that faith, then temporarily staying in the town, but since that time seeing no clergyman and professes no desire to be visited by one. The warrant for his execution has not yet been received, but is daily expected. Campbell says he comes from Glenga, near Plumbridge, county Tyrone, Ireland. His father was a soldier, and was serving in the army when he was born. He himself entered the 6th Carbineers, and served eleven years in that regiment, the greater part of the time a steward to CAPTAIN HAMILTON, now residing at Drumskey House, Munterloney, Gortin, county Tyrone, and with whom both a brother and sister of his are still believed to be living. In the year 1822 Campbell was sent out to this colony, but if his statement is to be believed, and there seems to be no reason doubting its truth, he subsequently visited the old country, and in the year 1856 for the second time arrived in Australia in the well-known ship Red Jacket. (Sydney Mail)\n\nJAMES WILSON – OBITUARY. – We have this week to record with much regret the death of MR. JAMES WILSON, of Gerringong. This melancholy event took place at his residence in the township on Tuesday last. He had been for the last five or six years affected with disease of the heart; and some weeks since was attacked by paralysis, under the effects of which he had since been sinking. Mr. Wilson was a native of the county of Tyrone in Ireland, and arrived in the colony some twenty-nine years ago. His first residence in this country was at Shellharbour where, however, he did not remain very long, having been induced to move to a farm on the Omega Retreat estate, where he continued nearly twenty years, subsequently removing to his own purchased property, on which he resided during the five or six years preceding his decease. Mr. Wilson was a man of quiet, unassuming manners and took an intelligent interest in public movements and sat in the Municipal Council during three years. His remains were interred yesterday in the public cemetery, the funeral being attended by a very large concourse of his friends and other residents of the district. Mr. Wilson was a consistent member of the Wesleyan connection, and took an active part in its affairs. His loss, we understand, is likely to be much felt by that church. The survivors of the family consist of a widow, three sons and a daughter. For MRS. WILSON, in particular, much sympathy is felt, as she has been a confirmed [confined?] invalid for the last sixteen years. The sons and daughter are all grown up, and occupy good positions in the district. (Kiama Independent and Shoalhaven Advertiser)\n\nOBITUARY. MARY BLACK (nee MELDRUM) – We have to-day to record the death of one of the elder members of a family occupying a conspicuous position and bearing a high reputation in our district. On Friday morning last, MARY, the widow of the late JAMES BLACK, and mother of JOHN, JAMES and WILLIAM BLACK, expired at the residence of her elder son, Happy Villa, Kiama. About a week previously she had been seized with paralysis; and after a partial rally of a few days, was on Thursday evening about 8 o’clock, the subject of a second and fatal attack, to which nature succumbed without apparent pain or suffering in a few hours. Mrs Black was seventy-one years of age, and was a native of Tyrone, Ireland, her original family name being MELDRUM. She reached the colony in 1842, bringing with her a family of three sons and two daughters. The youngest daughter died soon after reaching the colony, and the other about the time of her father’s death, about 20 years ago. The family resided the whole of the subsequent period in Illawarra, the first twenty years or thereabouts being spent in Bulli, the remainder at Kiama. The deceased was sister-in-law to MESSRS. ROBERT and the late THOMAS BLACK, to MRS. G. SOMERVILLE, sen., and the MISSES BLACK. Her husband was interred in the Wesleyan Chapel ground, Jamberoo, and the remains were carried to the same spot Saturday last, Mrs. Black having been nearly all her life an exemplary member of the Wesleyan communion, The Rev. Mr. Brown, Wesleyan minister, recently at Kiama, now of Wollongong, came from that town for the purpose of officiating at the funeral, which as might be expected was (considering the wet weather) attended by a large number of friends, relatives and neighbours. (Kiama Independent and Shoalhaven Advertiser)\n\n[Parents: James Meldrum and Mary (NSWRBMD)]\n\nDEATH OF MRS. JOHN [CATHERINE] OSBORNE [nee THOMPSON] – On Wednesday last, one of the oldest residents in the district, and who at the same time, was probably the senior in years of all persons around her for several miles, passed over to the great “majority”. We allude to the death of MRS. JOHN OSBORNE, which took place at her residence, Upper Crown-street, at the time stated. The deceased was the relict of the late MR. JOHN OSBORNE, who was brother to MR. ROBERT OSBORNE, father of MR. GEORGE OSBORNE, the present Mayor of Wollongong. It may also be stated that she was sister to the late MR. WILLIAM THOMPSON, for many years postmaster at Bathurst, and aunt to the gentleman of the same name who now holds that office. She survived her husband twenty-one years, and when it is stated that her age is not less than 98 years, it may scarcely be said that she enjoyed good health nearly to the last. Latterly, however, she became very feeble and on Friday last it was evident that her end was near. From that time she sank, and finally the flicker of the “vital spark” of very nearly a century died away forever. She was a native of the county of Tyrone, Ireland, and arrived in this colony with her husband upwards of forty years ago, since which time, with the exception of a short interval, she has been a resident of Wollongong. Her remains were interred in the Wesleyan Cemetery yesterday, she having been a member of that Church all her days, and for some years past was supposed to be the oldest individual within the Christian connexion in this colony. The Rev. J. W. Brown officiated on the occasion. (Kiama Independent and Shoalhaven Advertiser)\n\n[Parents: William Thompson and Mary (NSWRBMD)]\n\nMRS. HENRY NOBLE.\n\nWe have to announce the death of MRS. HENRY NOBLE, which sad event took place a little before noon, on New Year’s Day at her residence Fountaindale, after a painful illness of seventeen weeks’ duration. She was born in the year 1809, and consequently was about 70 years old. The immediate cause of death was heart disease; and her medical attendant, whose services were sought immediately on the development of the disease, was Dr. H. Tarrant. She was born at Knockmanoul, Parish of Balnamallard, County Fermanagh, Ireland. The whole of Knockmanoul is owned by an ancient family named Graham, of which she was a member, being the third daughter of FRANCIS and ELIZABETH GRAHAM, Mrs. Noble was married in 1831 and resided with her husband and family at Blackhill, Parish of Dromore, County Tyrone, for twenty years. In 1856 the family emigrated to this colony and settled in Illawarra. She was the mother of three sons, who survive her; they are well known throughout the district and are in comfortable circumstances. Of Mrs. Noble it may be said that she was a good Christian woman having lived in the enjoyment of religion since she was seventeen years old. She was a member of the Primitive Methodist Church in Ireland, but attended the ministrations of the Wesleyans in the colony. She retained her mental faculties, and a strong faith to the last. The funeral, which took place the following day, was numerously attended. The REV. W. MOORE officiated, and her remains were deposited in the Wesleyan Burying Ground, Jamberoo.
