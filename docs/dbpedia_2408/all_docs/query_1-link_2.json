Became April 6th (New Style), which is why our present Tax Year starts on this day! - Note method of remembering English Quarter days: last digit is the same as the number of letters in the month name [so March = 25, June = 24, September = 29] except for Christmas Day, which you just have to remember!\n\nFourth Sunday in Lent  Mothering Sunday  simnel cake eaten\n\nEaster Sunday  the first Sunday after the first Ecclesiastical Full Moon on or after 21 March (the nominal Vernal Equinox)  thus earliest date for Easter is March 22 and latest is April 25.\n\nSecond Monday & Tuesday after Easter  Hocktide  money collected for charitable purposes by men binding with cord any woman they met and receiving payment for release  women bound men on the next day.\n\nMay 15\n\n Whitsunday as a Quarter Day in Scotland (legislatively fixed at May 15 for this purpose)\n\nJune 24  Midsummer's Day or St John's Day  one of the Quarter Days in England\n\nJuly 15  St Swithun's Day\n\nAugust 1 [Aug 13 from 1753 onwards]  Lammas Day  Fences removed from common land which had been cultivated during the summer, and livestock permitted to graze over it till re-seeded again.

At least, I think so.\n\nWe have done our best, and hope that you will take the list in that spirit.\n\nIf you have any better information which you feel should be added, please let me know.\n\nReturn to top\n\nMajor Contributors to this list\n\nJohn Hitchcock  Victorian London Research\n\nMarina Alexander\n\nIain Kerr  of Windsor, Berkshire\n\nHilary Brookes  list as submitted to Yorksgen\n\nBryan Wetton  Adelaide South Australia \"A Southerner from the North\"\n\nJohn Owen Smith  Home Page\n\n... and many others  my thanks to you all!\n\nThis site has been included by Glossarist.com in their Linguistics Dictionary page  a source for many definitions of technical, professional or specialist terms.\n\nIf you've liked this site, try the following:"
