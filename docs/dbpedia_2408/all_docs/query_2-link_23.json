        "text": "Arthur James was born on Feb 19th,1901 in West Bromwich to Samuel and Alice (née Patrick) Jesson. As an architect he designed two churches in the Great Barr area, the Moorlands Methodist church in Hall Green Road (1959) and the church at the Greenside Way/Redwood Road junction (1967).\n\nHe married Joyce Dora Henn in 1932 and they had 5 children. He died in Devon in 1978.\n\nDavid was born in 1960 in Barrow-in-Furness to James Edward and Monica Jesson and brought up in Stourbridge, Worcs..\n\nAfter 3 years as a Reader at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh he worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA and in South Africa. After a few years as Professor of Physics at Monash University, Victoria, Australia he has returned to the UK and is currently Professor of Experimental Physics and a Marie Curie Fellow at Cardiff University where his research group is studying quantum structure formation and dynamics.\n\nHis main interests are in the field of electron microscopy, diffraction physics and surface physics, in which he is considered a world leader.\n\nHe married Sharon Lynn Carney in 1994 in Anderson, Tennessee.\n\nEric Edwin was born in Kent, UK to Frederick George Richard and Maud Emma (née Macey) Jesson. He emigrated as a geophysicist to Australia in 1957 to carry out the first gravity observations in the Larsemann Hills of Antarctica in 1958 before joining the Australian Antarctic base at Mawson as a seismologist. He was awarded the Polar Medal in 1961 and a small island in Antarctica has been named Jesson Island in his honour.\n\nHe is married with two daughters and now lives in retirement in Brisbane.\n\nJacob was born in London in 1650 into a family of ironmongers who, on the basis of their landholdings in the West Bromwich area, were obviously closely related to the Handsworth Jessons. He married Elizabeth Whalley and moved to the early settlement of Boston in the New England colony as the sales agent for his brother Abraham's ironmongery business. His wife and 3 children (Jacob1670-, Abraham 1672-and Jacob 1674-) all died there. He returned to London and was remarried on Nov 25th,1678 to Mary Glover with whom he had three more children (Glover, Mary and Elizabeth). He died there in 1686.\n\nIn a famous 1675 Massachusetts theft trial in which he was one of 12 jurors he was fined heavily by the court for not agreeing with the magistrates and the other 11 jurors that the defendant was guilty.\n\nThomas Bloodworth was born on 10 February 1882 at Maxey, Northamptonshire, England, the seventh child of Ann Jesson and her husband, Thomas Bloodworth, a groom and gardener. He left the village school at 10, and was apprenticed as a carpenter and joiner in Grantham, before emigrating to Christchurch, New Zealand, in 1908. He soon moved to Auckland, where he worked for two years as a carpenter on the construction of Grafton Bridge, then the largest single-span concrete bridge in the world.\n\nIn 1910 he became active in the Auckland branch of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners (ASCJ). He served as its delegate to the Auckland Trades and Labour Council, and the following year became president of the union.. He also became active in the Auckland branch of the New Zealand Socialist Party. By the end of 1913 he was an executive member of the United Federation of Labour (UFL) and from 1918 to 1920 served as their president. In 1921 he was elected secretary of both the Auckland branch and district council of the ASCJ; he combined these roles with spells as secretary of its Otahuhu and Hamilton branches. He failed in several attempts to get a seat in Parliament/\n\nTom Bloodworth also worked in local and community affairs, serving on the Auckland City Council for many years. He was made an OBE in 1966 and retired from civic life in 1968 at the age of 86. He died at Remuera, Auckland, on 11 May 1974. He had married Rhoda Alice Aspin in Auckland on 28 February 1912. Their only child, William, died in 1967"
