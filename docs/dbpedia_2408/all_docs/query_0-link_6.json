        "text": "See his entry in the Oxford DNB. Even towards the end of his life Bernard Shaw could remark that ‘he can still leave the next best tenor in England an immeasurable distance behind’. 1p, 12mo. In good condition, lightly aged, with minor traces of mount to inner margin. Folded once. Very nice embossed letterhead, printed in gold, brown, green and red, with bird perched on top of a treble clef, entwined with foliage and a twisted branch in the shape of the ‘R’ of ‘Reeves’. Reads: ‘Sir / This autograph with pleasure, according to your request / Yours faithfully / June 1872 / J. Sims Reeves’.\n\n3pp, 12mo. Bifolium. In fair condition, aged and worn, but with slight water staining and damage to blank area at foot of second leaf. The male recipient is not named. The letter begins: 'My dear Sir | If you present the enclosed to the porter of the Garrick Club, I have no doubt all the Art Treasures of the Garrick will be open to your inspection.\n\n3pp, 12mo. Bifolium. In fair condition, aged and worn, but with slight water staining and damage to blank area at foot of second leaf. The male recipient is not named. The letter begins: 'My dear Sir | If you present the enclosed to the porter of the Garrick Club, I have no doubt all the Art Treasures of the Garrick will be open to your inspection.\n\nAn attractive and unusual item, tastefully printed in green and red on both sides of a 30.5 x 60 cm strip, entirely covered in cream satin, and edged in silk ribbon, folding into a triptych each panel of which is 30.5 x 20 cm. In extremely good condition, all the more remarkable considering the ephemeral nature of the item. As folded into itself, the item has a front cover carrying the title in green ink, with a photograph of Kipling printed in red; and the back cover carries the royal crest of the Queen's printers Eyre and Spottiswoode.\n\n2pp, 12mo. In good condition, lightly aged. The letter casts an interesting sidelight on the practicalities of the late-Victorian theatre. He begins by explaining that he is sending back a wig he made for him, which was 'an admirable one in every way', and asking that he make him 'one like it for America & to bestow your best skill on it as it is of great importance to me'. He instructs him to 'make the wig a shade darker, something of the color it is dyed behind, & put a little natural white hair on the temples each side'.\n\nA satisfying association: a copy of the typescript of a play set in 'Mid-Rhondda', for a production by an amateur dramatic company from Mid-Rhondda. [1] + 80pp, 4to. Duplicated typescript. In fair condition, on aged and worn paper. Each page is on the recto of a separate leaf. Stapled into a dark-blue card binding, with cloth spine, the front cover of which carries: '”RHONDDA ROUNDABOUT” | A Play in 3 Acts by | JACK JONES | GARRICK DRAMATIC SOCIETY | Mid – Rhondda'. Preceding the text of the play is a page carrying a list of characters and their ages, and a 'Scene-Sequence'.\n\nA highly interesting letter from a leading Victorian dramatic critic (Thomas describes himself in the letter as 'For five & twenty years [...] theatrical critic of the Daily news & the Graphic', who has 'served under at least thirteen editors') to a leading actor-manager (Hare was knighted in 1907), on the subject of alleged editorial pressure on Fleet Street's theatre critics. 4pp, 8vo. On four leaves. Aged and worn, but with text complete and clear.\n\n1p., 12mo. In fair condition. He has 'from week to week been purposing a visit to you to express my gratitude & sincere thanks for your kindness to me & the cure you accomplished'. He can only write his thanks, having been overwhelmed by 'the arrears of work that followed my illness', and leaving for Paris the following day.\n\n1p., 12mo. Lithograph engraved facsimile of Garrick's autograph manuscript on unwatermarked wove paper. In fair condition, lightly aged. The origin of the engraving is unclear. Headed: 'Some additional shift to ye Comic part of ye Midsummer Night's dream. | Song for Epilogue | By Quince, Bottom Snug, Flute Starvling, Snout.' The first nine lines of the poem follow, beginning: 'Most noble Duke to us be kind, | Be you and all your Courtiers blind, | […]'. The poem as published in Colman's edition of 1763 does not feature the penultimate line: 'That will not do at Court:'.\n\n9pp., 4to. In good condition, on nine leaves of lightly-aged paper. With three deletions in pencil. A stalwart of the Garrick Club, Forbes-Robertson was a friend of Dame Ellen Terry, Oscar Wilde and Sir Edward Elgar, and organised Sir Henry Irving's funeral with Bram Stoker. There is no indication that this paper was ever published.\n\nviii + 58. Collotype frontispiece reproducing part of manuscript. Nicely printed on good paper. Internally tight, on lightly-aged paper, in discoloured and lightly-worn cream buckram binding, gilt. Tissue guard to frontispiece detached. The conclusion to the four-page preface, which is dated from New York, January 1896, explains that the 'formal publication in England' of the volume 'might possibly be deemed an offence against good taste, although its Author has been deceased for half a century, and hardly a single person referred to by Canon Barham can now be alive.\n\n1p., 12mo. In fair condition, aged and worn, with staining from glue used in previous mounting. He apologises for not being able to 'do what you asked', as he 'did not go to the Garrick until to day when I found your letter with others waiting me'.\n\n2pp., 12mo. Bifolium. In fair condition, lightly aged and creased. Lowe's request has been laid before the Club's committee, and there is no possibility of acceding to it: 'You say in your letter that you are aware that the privilege engraving the pictures in the Club Collection is \"rarely\" granted, but in this matter I fear you must have been misinformed as it is against the Rules to grant it at all'.\n\n27pp., 12mo. With collotype frontispiece of memorial plaque to Sir James Francis Garrick (1836-1908). In grey printed wraps. In fair condition, on lightly-aged paper, in worn wraps with chipping to extremities and rusted staples. Stamp, label and shelfmark of the Board of Education Reference Library, London. Only three copies on COPAC, and none at the British Library.\n\nLetter: 1p., 12mo. In good condition, on lightly-aged paper. He begins by suggesting that Baron write to 'Mr Payn' (the novelist and editor James Payn) via the Reform Club, Pall Mall. (Baron's method involved asking one celebrity how to contact another.) He next discusses two of his works: '\"The Memorial Windows\" appeared in the Gentleman's & was published in Pippins & Cheese (Bradbury & Evans) - \"The Valley\" you will see in enclosed list'. He concludes by thanking Baron for his 'complimentary note'. With envelope addressed to 'J. T.\n\n1p., 12mo. In fair condition, on lightly-aged paper, with a small closed tear to one edge. He informs the recipient that his portrait of Garrick is 'the second state of the engraving: the first is before all letters. | The person who engraved the lettering evidently made a mistake.' He notes an inscription sometimes found on impressions of the second state of the engraving, and change made in the third state.\n\nTotalling 5pp., 4to, with Seward's poem on the first 3pp., and Hayley's on the following 2pp. Disbound from a notebook. In good condition, on lightly-aged and worn paper which has been cropped at the foot, resulting in the loss of two lines of text from Hayley's poem, and with the strip with the trimmed line from the foot of the first page of Seward's poem laid down at the head of the second page.\n\nThe autograph address by Eva Marie Garrick is on a 7.5 x 14.5 piece of paper, laid down on an 8 x 20 cm piece of paper cut from an album. In fair condition, aged. Lightly-scored through by the postal authorities, it reads: 'The Rigt. Honorable | Dowr. Lady Amherst | Leven Grove near | Stokerley | Yorkshire'. Beneath this, in another hand: 'Widow of the celebrated David Garrick Esq', and along one edge, in a third hand (Lady Amherst's?), 'This direction was written by Mrs Garrick in the year 1819 when in her 92d year'.\n\nThe collection, consisting of 31 items in a variety of formats, is in very good condition, on lightly-aged paper, with all texts clear and complete. Wellby's correspondence with Rogers (an affluent Kent businessman and farmer, collector and dabbler in the jewellery business) reflects a relationship at once businesslike and friendly, with items being offered by Wellby on behalf of his firm, and news of items consigned to the firm by Rogers. The personal element is apparent from the first.\n\nBoth items in fair condition, on lightly-aged and foxed paper. Letter One: 12mo (15 x 10 cm), 1 p. He thanks him 'for the Tickets': 'we are looking forward to seeing you act. I shall be very pleased to come to smoke a cigarette after the first act off the Duel.' ('The Duel' was produced at the Garrick Theatre, London, in 1907.) Letter Two: 12mo, 2 pp. He thanks him 'for the excellent evening you gave me at The Coronet the other night. | The Incubus is an admirable play, and admirably acted.' He hopes France 'had a good week of it': 'I told innumerable people not to miss it.'\n\nOctavo: 53 pp. Stitched and unbound. Complete in itself, in alphabetical order, but lotted 554 to 846. Good, though grubby, and with the outer leaves somewhat creased. Includes letters and documents by Burns, Charles I and II, Maria Edgeworth, Frederick the Great, Garrick, Lady Hamilton, Handel, Dr Johnson, Southey, Wordsworth. The high spot is a letter from Thomas Jefferson to the Earl of Buchan, described over one page.\n\nOne page, 16mo. Good. Six lines. He may be 'giving some lectures in London shortly'. 'If I could make it worth my while to deliver them at some of the leading provincial towns, I might possibly arrange to do so. Therefore any information you could give me on the subject, I should be only too happy to have'.\n\nEnglish actress of Spanish descent (1866-1951). Two pages, 12mo. On grey paper. Folded twice. In very good condition, but with minor traces of paper mounts adhering to two corners of first leaf of bifoliate. Florid signature. She declines the luncheon invitation as she has friends coming down. She is 'going to try & have tea with Mrs Gooch. But it is a little difficult to get away when one has people staying.' She is sorry to have missed her correspondent.\n\nOne page, small octavo. Very good, though with a little offsetting of ink from folding of letter, and a small closed tear at head. A reply to a request for an autograph - in a close, neat, hand - reading 'Dear Sir | With much pleasure as I assure you that I am | Sincerely yours | Alfred Sutro'.\n\nEnglish comedian (1848-1907), grandson of the actor Charles Kemble. Two pages, 12mo. On grubby, spotted and stained paper. 'I was so sorry to have been prevented coming to you on Sunday last, and also that my absence from town has precluded the possibility of my leaving Cards. I hope I may be more fortunate another time.'\n\nBritish metallurgist (1874-1960) and Master of the Worshipful Company of Clothworkers. Apologises for assuming that Dr Thomas Monro was a member of the Society. 'I never doubted it because not only did he live in Adelphi Terrace, next door to his friend David Garrick, but he was friendly with so many of the Members of that day, and a great patron of the Arts. For the rest he was a medical man - chief physician to 'Bedlam' and one of poor old George III's mental doctors -'.\n\nEnglish actor (1843-96) under the name 'Arthur Cecil'. 1 page, dimensions 3 1/2 inches by 4 1/2 inches. In good condition though dusty. He thanks him for his kind note, and says that if he 'may keep my little contribution in reserve for a bit' he 'will certainly bear it in mind & shall hope to turn you out something before very long'. Signed 'Arthur C Blunt'.\n\nEnglish dramatist and actor-manager (1871-1949), knighted in 1935. The letter, to Mrs [Jean] Webster Brough, 24 May 1939, on cropped letterhead, 1 page, 12mo. \"[...] Im so glad you liked the little book. Yes indeed our families have been bound together - over many years - and I remember the happy times I had with dear Polly at Tooles Theatre I can hardly believe it is more than five & forty years ago Please give my love to Ben & May when you see them\". The autograph note, undated, on letterhead of the Garrick Club, one page, 12mo."
