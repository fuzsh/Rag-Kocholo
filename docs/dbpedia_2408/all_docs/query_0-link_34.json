The resorts in question have long since entirely changed their character, although they were once important features of London life, and were used by all classes for purposes of conviviality and conversation.\n\nThe appellation âclubâ seems to have come into use at the time when coffee-houses began to be popular in London. The first notable London club, of course, was the Mermaid, in Broad Street, which was supposed to have been founded by Raleigh, and which was the reputed scene of many witty combats between Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. The latter himself originated another clubâthe Apolloâwhich had its meetings at the Devil Tavern, near Temple Bar.\n\nIn course of time many landlords perceived the advantage which would accrue to their business from the setting apart of special rooms for privileged 2customers; and gradually a number of fairly exclusive clubs came into being.\n\nThus Tomâs, a coffee-house till 1764, in that year, by a guinea subscription, was easily converted into a fashionable club. In the same way Whiteâs and the Cocoa-tree changed their character from chocolate-house to club. When once a house had customers enough of standing and good repute, well acquainted with each other, it was quite worth while to purchase the power of excluding all but subscribers, and to turn the place into a club; for by such a proceeding undesirable characters, who could obtain constant admission to an open house, were at once kept outside the doors.\n\nThe evolution of the modern club has been so simple that it can be traced with great ease. First the tavern or coffee-house, where a certain number of people met on special evenings for purposes of social conversation, and incidentally consumed a good deal of liquid refreshment; then the beginnings of the club properâsome well-known house of refreshment being taken over from the proprietor by a limited number of clients for their own exclusive use, and the landlord retained as manager; and finally the palatial modern club, not necessarily sociable, but replete with every comfort, and owned by the members themselves. In such places, however, the old spirit of club-life is generally lost. Dr. Johnson, for example, can be imagined passing through the portals of one of these huge buildings, and saying: âSir, this may be a palace, but it is no club.â There is no doubt that in a great measure he would be right.\n\n3It is believed that the first house in Pall Mall ever used as a club was No. 86, originally built for Edward, Duke of York, brother of George III. It was opened as a âsubscription house,â and called the Albion Hotel towards the end of the last century.\n\nIn the early part of the eighteenth century there were said to be no fewer than 2,000 coffee-houses in London. Every profession, trade, class, party, had its favourite coffee-house. The lawyers discussed law or literature, criticized the last new play, or retailed the legal scandal at Nandoâs or the Grecian, not very far away from the Temple. At such places the young bloods of the Inns of Court paraded their gowns in the morning, and swaggered in their lace coats and Mechlin ruffles at night, after the theatre. City men met to discuss the rise and fall of stocks, and to settle the rate of insurance, at Garrawayâs or Jonathanâs; parsons exchanged University gossip or discussed points of theology at Trubyâs or at Childâs, in St. Paulâs Churchyard; whilst military men mustered to grumble over their grievances at Old or Young Manâs, near Charing Cross. The St. Jamesâs and the Smyrna were the headquarters of the Whig politicians, whereas the Tories frequented the Cocoa-tree or Ozindaâs, in St. Jamesâs Street; Scotchmen had their house of call at Forrestâs, Frenchmen at Gilesâs or Old Slaughterâs, in St. Martinâs Lane; the gamesters shook their elbows in Whiteâs and the chocolate-houses round Covent Garden; and the leading wits gathered at Willâs, Buttonâs, or Tomâs, in Great Russell Street, where, after the 4theatre, there was piquet and the best of conversation till midnight. At all these places, except a few of the most aristocratic coffee or chocolate houses of the West End, smoking was allowed.\n\nMany of these old taverns must have been exceedingly comfortable places, and the few which survive have an especial charm. They carry oneâs thoughts irresistibly to the days when Dr. Johnson blew his cloud by the side of an old-fashioned fireplace, and occasionally floored some unhappy wight with the sledge-hammer of his conversation.\n\nOne of the last, if not the last, hostelries, which still retains its ancient appearance, is the Cheshire Cheese. This well-known house is half-way up Fleet Street, on the northern side. It remains, I believe, substantially as it was when, seven years after the Restoration, it was rebuilt on the site of that older Cheshire Cheese where Shakespeare and many other Elizabethan wits were wont to meet.\n\nBen Jonson was a frequent visitor, and here occurred his dispute with Sylvester as to which of them could make the best couplet in the shortest time. The latter began:\n\nThe otherâs retort was:\n\nâBut thatâs not rhyme,â said Sylvester. âNo,â said Jonson, âbut itâs true.â\n\nThe original courtyard of the Cheshire Cheese is 5now roofed over with glass, and here may be seen some interesting old prints. These include two by H. BunburyââA City Huntâ and âHyde Park, 1780â; while others are, âDestruction of the Bastille, July 14, 1789,â after a painting by H. Singleton, and a line engraving by James Heath, from a painting by F. Wheatley of âThe Riot in Broad Street on the 17th of June, 1773.â\n\nDr. Johnson is supposed to have passed many an evening here, and from his time down to the present day unbroken links of tradition connect the Cheshire Cheese of the twentieth century with the Cheshire Cheese of the eighteenth.\n\nThe seat on which legend reports that the redoubtable lexicographer sat is one of the most treasured relics of the dining-room. Above it hangs a copy of the famous portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds, now preserved in the National Gallery. Underneath may be read the following inscription: âThe Favourite Seat of Dr. Johnson. Born 18th Septr., 1709. Died 13th Decr., 1784. In him a noble understanding and a masterly intellect were united with grand independence of character and unfailing goodness of heart, which won the admiration of his own age and remain as recommendations to the reverence of posterity. âNo, Sir! there is nothing which has yet been contrived by man by which so much happiness has been produced as by a good tavern.ââJohnson.â\n\nA number of quaint pictures and prints are to be found scattered over the house.\n\nUpstairs is another copy of Sir Joshuaâs oil-painting of the Doctor. This, it is said, dates back 6to Johnsonâs time, and was painted in order that it might adorn the room at the Mitre, in Chancery Lane, where the club founded by Dr. Johnson first held its meetings. Dr. Johnsonâs Mitre has long since been pulled down, but the club he founded still exists, and it meets several times a year in what was formerly the coffee-room. This is now known as âWilliamâs room,â on account of the portrait of William Simpson which hangs over the fireplace. William began to be a waiter at Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese Chop-house in 1829, and his portrait, as the inscription below says, âwas subscribed for by the gentlemen frequenting the coffee-room, and presented to Mr. Dolamore (the landlord) to be handed down as an heirloom to all future landlords of âYe Olde Cheshire Cheese,â Wine Office Court, Fleet Street.â The name of the artist is unknown.\n\nIn the opposite room is a picture of another waiterâa portrait of Henry Todd, as the inscription informs us, who commenced as waiter at Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese February 27, 1812. It was painted by Wageman, July 1827, and âsubscribed for by the gentlemen frequenting the coffee-room, and presented to Mr. Dolamore (the landlord) in trust to be handed down as an heirloom to all future landlords of the Old Cheshire Cheese, Wine Office Court, Fleet Street.â\n\nBesides being the meeting-place of the Mitre Club, the Cheshire Cheese is used by a number of clubs resembling somewhat those which were so popular with a long-vanished generation. These are: The Johnson Club, founded about twenty-five 7years ago; the Sawdust Club, founded 1906; âOurselves,â founded 1897; St. Dunstanâs, founded 1890; the Rump Steak Club; the Dickens Club. The Johnson Club is literary and social in character, and consists of thirty-one members, who sup together annually on or about December 13th, the anniversary of the Doctorâs death. Various other meetings are held throughout the year.\n\nThe Doctor was certainly the most typical club-man of a past age, and his name is connected with quite a number of social clubs which held their meetings at coffee-houses and taverns. Indeed, no more clubbable man than the writer of the famous Dictionary ever lived; but, then, sociability was the main object of the clubs of his day, whereas the modern tendency is more towards comfort and efficient management than anything else. In most large modern clubs quite a number of members are totally unknown to their fellows, and there is no reason why a member should speak to anyone at all unless he wishes to do so. The majority of the larger modern clubs are in reality merely comfortable caravanseraisâhotels receiving a certain number of selected visitors who recognize no social obligations within the club walls except such as regulate ordinary civilized behaviour.\n\nDr. Johnson founded several social clubs at the taverns and coffee-houses which he loved to frequent. One of these was the Kingâs Head, Ivy Lane, Paternoster Row, a famous beefsteak house, and here he spent every Tuesday evening in conversation with the members of a social club of his own foundation.\n\n8At the Queenâs Arms, in St. Paulâs Churchyard, the Doctor in later years founded a club of a similar sort, and Boswell records that he was also desirous of having a City club, the members of which he suggested that Boswell should collect. âOnly,â added the great lexicographer, âdonât let there be any patriots.â\n\nYet another club instituted by Dr. Johnson was one which met thrice a week at the Essex Head, in Essex Street, Strand, at the time when that tavern was kept by Samuel Greavesâan old servant of Mr. Thraleâs. Failure to attend was penalized by a fine of twopence.\n\nThe Mitre Tavern in Fleet Street, so often referred to by Boswell, was Dr. Johnsonâs favourite supper-place, and here was planned the celebrated tour to the Hebrides. It is interesting to remember, in this connection, that Chamberlain Clarke, who died in 1831, aged ninety-two, was the last survivor of those friends with whom Dr. Johnson forgathered at the Mitre.\n\nPeeleâs Coffee-house, at Nos. 177, 178, Fleet Street, which afterwards became a tavern, was also supposed to have been a haunt of Dr. Johnson, whose portrait, painted on the keystone of a chimney-piece, for years after his death formed one of the attractions of the house. The artist was supposed to have been Sir Joshua Reynolds. Peeleâs was once noted for its collection of old newspapers. Here were preserved files from the following dates: The Gazette, 1759; Times, 1780; Morning Chronicle, 1773; Morning Post, 1773; Morning Herald, 1784; Morning Advertiser, 1794.\n\n9Nearly every literary man of that time had his favourite coffee-house.\n\nGeorgeâs, at No. 213 Strand, near Temple Bar, was the resort of Shenstone, who found it an economical place. Probably it was for this reason that the eccentric Sir James Lowther, a very rich man, but penurious, also went there. On his first visit he got the proprietors to change a piece of silver in order to pay twopence for his coffee. A few days later he returned expressly to tell the woman that she had given him a bad halfpenny, and demanded another in exchange for it.\n\nClients of this coffee-house could read pamphlets and papers for a very moderate subscription.\n\nLondon hours were very different in those days. Three oâclock, or at latest four, was the dining hour of the most fashionable people, for in the country no such late hours had been adopted. In London, therefore, the men began to assemble soon after six at the coffee-house they frequentedâunless, indeed, they were setting in for hard drinking, which seems to have prevailed much less in private houses than in taverns.\n\nThe conversation varied in different coffee-houses. In those about the Temple, legal matters formed the principal subject of discussion. On the other hand, at Danielâs, the Welsh coffee-house in Fleet Street, it was mostly of births, pedigrees, and descents; Childâs and the Chapter, upon glebes, tithes, advowsons, rectories, and lectureships; Northâs, undue elections, false pollings, scrutinies, and the like; Hamlinâs, infant baptism, lay ordination, free-will, election, and reprobation; Batsonâs, 10the prices of pepper, indigo, and saltpetre; and all those about the Exchange, where the merchants met to transact their affairs, were in a perpetual hurry about stock-jobbingâcheating, and tricking widows and orphans, and committing spoil and rapine on the public, malicious people said.\n\nIn some coffee-houses and taverns political feeling ran high. One noted chop-house near Holborn lost its business owing to the democratic character of a number of its frequenters, and eventually had to be shut up. A new landlord, however, seeking to restore its prosperity, exhibited the sign of the Kingâs Head, referring to which a friend said to him: âDo you think your new sign will keep away old customers? Why, there is not one of them but would like as much as ever to have a chop at the Kingâs Head.â\n\nThe Chapter Coffee-house in Paternoster Row, an ancient building with low rooms and heavy beams, was in the eighteenth century the resort of all the booksellers and publishers; and the literary hacks, the critics, and even the wits, used to go there in search of ideas or employment. This was the place about which Chatterton wrote, in those delusive letters he sent to his mother at Bristol, while he was starving in London. The Chapter also retained traditions of Oliver Goldsmith.\n\nIn later years it became the tavern frequented by University men and country clergymen who were up in London for a few days, and, having no private friends or access into society, were glad to learn what was going on in the world of letters, 11from the conversation which they were sure to hear in the coffee-room.\n\nAt one time leather tokens were issued by the proprietor; and the Chapter was noted for being entirely managed by men, no women servants being kept.\n\nIn the north-east corner of the coffee-room was a box known as the Witenagemote, which in the early morning was occupied by a group of individuals nicknamed the Wet Paper Club. The name was derived from their habit of opening the papers as soon as these were brought in by the newsman, and reading them before they were dried by the waiter; a dry paper was regarded as a stale commodity. In the afternoon another party enjoyed the wet evening papers.\n\nA gentleman who was considered a fixture in this box was Mr. Hammond, a Coventry manufacturer, who evening after evening, for nearly forty-five years, was always to be found in the same place, and during the entire period was well known for his severe and often able comments on the events of the day. Here he pontificated throughout the days of Wilkes, of the American War, and of the French War, and, being on the side of liberty, was constantly in opposition to almost everyone else.\n\nThe Chapter continued to be a coffee-house up to 1854, when it became a tavern.\n\nThe Royal Exchange was the resort of all the trading part of the City, foreign and domestic, from half an hour after one till near three in the afternoon; but the better sort generally met in the 12Exchange Alley a little before, at three celebrated coffee-houses called Garrawayâs, Robinâs, and Jonathanâs. In the first the people of quality who had business in the City, and the most considerable and wealthy citizens, congregated. In the third met buyers and sellers of stock.\n\nThe Royal Exchange Coffee-house resembled a gaming-house more than anything else, being full of gamesters, with the same sharp, intent looks, with the difference only that there it was selling of Bank stock, East India, South Sea, and lottery tickets, instead of the cards and dice dear to ordinary gamblers.\n\nThe British Coffee-house in the West End was much frequented by Scotchmen, whilst a mixture of all sorts went to the Smyrna, not very far away. There were other little coffee-houses much frequented in this neighbourhoodâYoung Manâs for officers, Old Manâs for stockjobbers, paymasters, and courtiers, and Little Manâs for sharpers. Here there were two or three faro tables upstairs.\n\nAfter the theatre fashionable men went to Tomâs and Willâs Coffee-houses, where they played piquet and indulged in conversation. Here you might see blue and green ribbons and stars sitting familiarly with private gentlemen, and talking with the same freedom as if they had left their quality and degrees of distance at homeâa sight which amazed foreigners not used to the liberty of speech permitted in England.\n\nA favourite resort of literary men was the Percy Coffee-house in Rathbone Place, Oxford Street. This was used by Thomas Byerley and Joseph 13Robertson, who together produced the âPercy Anecdotesâ in 1820, writing as Sholto and Reuben Percy. A large sum was realized by the work in question, which began in 1820 and ran into forty-four parts.\n\nThe West End coffee-houses were often disturbed by the eccentricities of the âbloods.â A wild band, for instance, frequented the Royal Chocolate-house in St. Jamesâs Street, where on one occasion a dispute at hazard produced a quarrel, which became general throughout the room; and, as they fought with their swords, three gentlemen were mortally wounded. The affray was at length ended by the interposition of the Royal Guards, who were compelled to knock the parties down indiscriminately with the butt-ends of their muskets, as entreaties and commands were of no avail. On this occasion a footman of Colonel Cunninghamâs, greatly attached to his master, rushed through the swords, seized and literally carried him out by force without injury.\n\nLord Camelford, of duelling notoriety, one evening entered the Prince of Wales Coffee-house, Conduit Street, and, as was his usual custom, sat down and began to read the papers. A dashing fellow, and in his own opinion a first-rate blood, happening to come in, threw himself on the opposite seat of the same box, and, in a consequential tone, bawled: âWaiter! bring me a pint of madeira and a couple of wax candles, and put them in the next box.â He then drew over to himself Lord Camelfordâs candles, and began to read, which proceeding merely caused his lordship to look indignant, whilst he continued reading his paper. The waiter soon 14reappeared, and announced the completion of the gentlemanâs commands, who immediately lounged round to his own box. Lord Camelford, having now finished his paragraph, called out, in a mimicking tone: âWaiter! bring me a pair of snuffers.â These being quickly brought, his lordship laid down his paper, walked round the table at which the âbloodâ sat, snuffed out both the candles, and retired to his seat. Boiling with rage and fury, the indignant beau roared out: âWaiter, waiter! who the devil is this fellow that dares to insult a gentleman? What is he? What do they call him?â âLord Camelford, sir,â replied the other in a tone scarcely audible. The coxcomb, horror-struck at the name of the dangerous nobleman, said tremblingly, âWhat have I to pay?â and, on being told, quietly laid down his money and sneaked away, leaving his madeira untasted.\n\nDisturbances were frequently caused in coffee-houses by dashing bucks who attempted either to dominate or to upset the domination of others. At the west end of Cecil Court, in St. Martinâs Lane, there existed, towards the end of the reign of George II, Ponâs Coffee-house, much frequented by foreigners of distinction, officers, and men about town. In the course of time the foreigners began to dominate this place, always contriving to get one of themselves into the chair, and occupying special seats which were kept for them alone. This created much ill-feeling, and at length reached the ears of the celebrated Lord Tyrawley, at that time a gay spark about town. Discussing the foreign ascendancy which prevailed in this place, Lord Tyrawley said, in his vigorous way: âIt is all your own fault. 15The Frenchmen see you are afraid of them, and therefore behave with insolence. I am sure they are cowards, and if I was in the company I would undertake to insult the lot with impunity, and leave the room without being questioned or prevented by any one of them.â This led to a conversation, which ended in a bet that Lord Tyrawley would carry his threat into execution, and on an appointed day he proceeded to action.\n\nHaving made arrangements with a confederate, his lordship entered the room in time enough to take his seat in the presidentâs chair unquestioned, according to the law of the place. Afterwards the confederate, pretending to be a stranger, seated himself unnoticed, in the same manner, in the deputy chairmanâs place at the bottom. As the Frenchmen dropped in, one by one, they were surprised to perceive the posts of honour thus unusually occupied. They whispered and muttered to each other as their numbers increased, but at last took their seats anywhere they could. In tones of discontent, deep but not loud, one whispered to his neighbour: âConnaissez-vous celui-lÃ ?â pointing to the new president. âNon.â âNi lâautre?â âNon.â âNi moi, non plus; ma foi, câest singulier! Ah! les drÃ´les! Eh bien, tout-Ã -lâheure le prÃ©sident viendra, et alors nous verrons comme tout cela va finir!â At last the French president arrived, and, finding the post of honour unexpectedly filled by the two dashing officers of rank, quietly took his seat, like his countrymen, where he could find it. The others, who were interested in the scene, seated themselves at the lower end of the table, whilst the few French 16who had come early seated themselves as near to the new president as they could.\n\nThe two intruders enjoyed the scene in secret, but behaved with politeness and affability to all, in their respective circles, till at last dinner was served. Lord Tyrawley formally did the honoursâtasted the soup, put on a critical look, and asked those who were near him to taste, and favour him with their opinions. They were surprised at his assurance, but several tasted, and said simultaneously, âAssez bienâcomme Ã lâordinaireâquâen pensez-vous?â and so on. Lord Tyrawley then exclaimed: âIt is most execrable stuff, and only fit to be placed before pigs! Waiterâ (the man crept forward trembling), âwhat do you bring this stuff here for?â The astonished servant looked silently towards the Frenchmen, in the hopes of catching a hint, when Tyrawley, in a rage, vociferated: âDonât answer me, sir! take it away, and bring me the next dishâtake it away instantly, I say!â So saying, he seized his own plate in both hands, raised it above his head, and then dashed it with all his force, with its flat bottom, into the midst of the soup, which spread, in a circular sheet, upon the table and the clothes of all who sat at that end of it. The Frenchmen started with horror and surprise, springing from their seats to save their clothes, while his confederate jumped up, exclaiming: âWhat do you mean by that, sir?â âI mean to say,â said Lord Tyrawley, with provoking coolness, âthe soup is very bad.â âNonsense, sir,â said the apparently enraged deputy chairman; âyou have insulted every man here, and I will see that you give me immediate 17satisfaction.â âOh, sir,â said the Peer, very coolly, âif you are for that sport, I will indulge you at once.â So saying, each took down his hat and sword with great dignity, and, the challenger strutting after the challenged, both descended into the courtyard. The bespattered foreigners, finding a duel was in progress, crowded the window for good places to see the sight, till it was quite full. The combatants took their ground, drew, and began a very furious-looking assault; one fought retreating, the other pushing him back till they were at the end of the court in St. Martinâs Lane, when they took off their hats, bowed gracefully to the astonished Frenchmen, and walked away arm in arm, laughing and kissing their hands to the company they had left, leaving them to enjoy their spoiled dinner and well-greased clothes as they were best able.\n\nThe great dread of the peaceful citizens who frequented taverns and coffee-houses was an incursion by members of the clubs known as Bold Bucks and Hell-Firesâfor the most part composed of deliberately abandoned villains. The Bold Bucks were given up to licentiousness of an unbridled kind; blind and bold love was their motto, and their main object seems to have been the assimilation of man to brute.\n\nThe Hell-Fires, as may be gathered from their appellation, aimed at an even more transcendent malignity, and derided the forms of religion as a trifle.\n\nA regular code of etiquette was observed at coffee-houses. At most of these, though not at the fashionable 18West End ones, a penny was usually laid on the bar on entering, which entitled the guest to the use of the room and of the news-sheet. Every rank of life, except perhaps the very lowest, was represented at one or other of these houses. Men met there to transact business, talk politics, discuss the latest play or poem, to play dice or cards. To one man the coffee-house was an office for business, where he received, and from which he dated, his letters; to another, a place in which to push his fortunes among patrons; to most, a lounging-place in which to discuss the news and pass away the time. The advertisements of the day are full of allusions to them. One gentleman loses his watch or his sword, and will give a reward if they are returned to Tomâs or Buttonâs, âand no questions asked.â Another, one Brown, âlate City Marshall,â will settle all affairs that he had in his hands while holding that office, if the persons interested will repair to âMr. Gibbonâs Coffee-House at Charing Cross.â\n\nThe first coffee-houseâthat is, the first house where coffee was sold to the public in Englandâis said to have been the George and Vulture, in George Yard, Lombard Street, a house still in existence.\n\nAbout 1652 a Turkey merchant, Mr. Edwards by name, is supposed to have brought to London from Smyrna a Ragusan youth, Pasqua Rosee by name, specially to prepare coffee for him every morning. This servant he eventually allowed to sell the new-fashioned infusion publicly, and eventually the Ragusan established the first coffee-house in London, at St. Michaelâs Abbey, Cornhill, under 19the title of Pasqua Roseeâs Inn, afterwards known to fame as the George and Vulture.\n\nThe old Rainbow in Fleet Street, now known as Groomâs, was the second coffee-house; but the owner of the Rainbow apparently did not purvey a very attractive form of the new beverage, for he was indicted by the Vestry for selling âa strong drink called Coffee which annoyed the neighbourhood by its evil smell.â\n\nCuriously enough, both houses, Groomâs and the George and Vulture, now belong to the same proprietor, Mr. John Gardner, who, when he recently purchased the lease of the former, also acquired the original coffee-making recipe.\n\nAs a coffee-house the George and Vulture was a well-known resort of poets, wits, and satirists. The servants appear to have been very enterprising in attracting customers, for they would rush out and seize passers-by, crying: âCoffee, sir; tea, sir! Walk in and try a fresh pot!â\n\nAt the George and Vulture, Swift discussed the South Sea Bubble with his friends. Here, too, came Richard Estcourt, of Drury Lane, and founded the first Beefsteak Club. At a later period this coffee-house, on account of its sign, was especially popular with patriotic clubs. Amongst its patrons were Addison and Steele, whilst Daniel Defoe seems also to have been a visitor.\n\nIn Georgian days the old coffee-house became one of the most popular resorts of John Wilkes, and there also went Hogarth and other well-known men of the day, whilst members of the Hell-Fire Club were constant though unwelcome visitors.\n\n20In later times Charles Dickens immortalized the George and Vulture by making it an abode of Mr. Pickwick and Sam Weller; the old hostelry was also selected by the great novelist as being the place where subpÅnas were served on Mr. Pickwickâs friends in the famous case of Bardell and Pickwick. Dickensâs affection for âthe Georgeâ is now perpetuated by the City Pickwick, a social club which holds its meetings there.\n\nDickens is supposed to have obtained the idea for the name of Tom Pinch from Dr. Pincheâs school, which in early Victorian days occupied the site of the Deutsche Bank, close to the George and Vulture, in George Yard. Sir Henry Irving was a pupil here, as was that still surviving legal luminary, Sir Edward Clarke.\n\nAnother resort full of old-world memoriesâthe London Coffee-house, on Ludgate Hill, where John Leechâs father and grandfather were proprietorsâoccupied a Roman site. In 1800, behind this house, in a bastion of the City Wall, was found a sepulchral monument, dedicated to a faithful wife by her husband, a Roman soldier. Here also were found a fragment of a statue of Hercules and a female head. In front of the coffee-house, immediately west of St. Martinâs Church, stood Ludgate.\n\nThis coffee-house was within the rules of the Fleet Prison; and in the coffee-house were âlocked upâ for the night such juries from the Old Bailey Sessions as could not agree upon verdicts. In later days it became a tavern.\n\nA curious incident once occurred in this house. 21Mr. Broadhurst, the famous tenor, by singing a high note caused a wineglass on the table to break, the bowl being separated from the stem. Brayley, the topographer, was present at the time.\n\nLloydâs, now such a well-known institution, originated in a coffee-house of that name, which flourished as early as the very beginning of the eighteenth century.\n\nLloydâs Coffee-house was originally in Lombard Street, at the corner of Abchurch Lane, subsequently in Popeâs-head Alley, where it was called âNew Lloydâs Coffee-houseâ; but on February 14, 1774, it was removed to the north-west corner of the Royal Exchange, where it remained until the destruction of that building by fire. When the Royal Exchange was rebuilt, special rooms were set aside for Lloydâs, which assumed the form in which it flourishes to-day.\n\nLloydâs, as a place for insuring ships, was at first started by an astute individual who saw the possibilities of a meeting-place for underwriters and insurers of shipsâ cargoes.\n\nAs early as the year 1740, it is recorded that Mr. Baker, Master of Lloydâs Coffee-house, in Lombard Street, waited on Sir Robert Walpole with the news of Admiral Vernonâs capture of Portobello. This was the first account received thereof, and, as it proved to be true, Sir Robert was pleased to order Mr. Baker a handsome present.\n\nAnother resort, somewhat similar to Lloydâs, was Garrawayâs Coffee-houseâthe first place where tea was sold in England. It was during the time of the South Sea Bubble that this became the scene 22of great mercantile transactions. The original proprietor was Thomas Garway, tobacconist and coffee-man. He issued the following curious circular: âTea in England hath been sold in the leaf for six pounds, and sometimes for ten pounds the pound weight, and in respect of its former scarceness and dearness, it hath been only used as a regalia in high treatments and entertainments, and presents made thereof to princes and grandees till the year 1651. The said Thomas Garway did purchase a quantity thereof, and first publicly sold the said tea in leaf and drink, made according to the directions of the most knowing merchants and travellers into those eastern countries; and upon knowledge and experience of the said Garwayâs continued care and industry in obtaining the best tea, and making drink thereof, very many noblemen, physicians, merchants, and gentlemen of quality, have ever since sent to him for the said leaf, and daily resort to his house in Exchange Alley, aforesaid, to drink the drink thereof; and to the end that all persons of eminence and quality, gentlemen and others, who have occasion for tea in leaf, may be supplied, these are to give notice that the said Thomas Garway hath tea to sell from âsixteen to fifty shillings per pound.ââ\n\nIn 1673 there were some great sales of wine at Garrawayâs. These took place âby the candleââthat is, by auction while an inch of candle burnt. In the Tatler, No. 147, we read: âUpon my coming home last night, I found a very handsome present of French wine left for me, as a taste of 216 hogsheads, which are to be put to sale at Â£20 a hogshead, 23at Garrawayâs Coffee-house, in Exchange Alley,â etc. A sale by candle is not, however, by candlelight, but during the day. Such sales took place by daylight, and at the commencement of the sale, when the auctioneer had read a description of the property and the conditions on which it was to be disposed of, a piece of candle, usually an inch long, was lit, the last bidder at the time the light went out being declared the purchaser.\n\nGarrawayâs was famous for its sandwiches and sherry, pale ale, and punch. The sandwich-maker, it was said, occupied two hours in cutting and arranging the sandwiches before the dayâs consumption commenced. The sale-room was on the first-floor, with a small rostrum for the seller, and a few rough wooden seats for the buyers. Sales of drugs, mahogany, and timber, were its speciality in the fifties of the last century, when twenty or thirty property and other sales sometimes took place in a day. The walls and windows of the lower room were covered with sale placardsâunsentimental evidences of the mutability of human affairs.\n\nIn 1840 and 1841, when the tea speculation was at its height, and prices were fluctuating sixpence and eightpence per pound on the arrival of every mail, Garrawayâs was frequented every night by a host of the smaller fry of dealers, and there was much more excitement than ever occurred on âChange when the most important intelligence arrived. Champagne flowed, and everyone ate and drank, and went, as he pleased, without the least question about the bill; yet everything was paid, though such a state of affairs continued for several months.\n\n24At one time many taverns were the meeting-places of âmug-house clubs,â amusing resorts where gentlemen, lawyers, and tradesmen used to meet in a great room, seldom under a hundred in number.\n\nSuch assemblies usually had a president, who sat in an armchair some steps higher than the rest of the company, to keep the whole room in order. A harp played all the time at the lower end of the room; and every now and then one or other of the company rose and entertained the rest with a song, some being good singers. Here nothing was drunk but ale, and every gentleman had his separate mug, which he chalked on the table where he sat, as it was brought in. A free-and-easy atmosphere pervaded the place, and everyone did and said exactly what he pleased.\n\nA number of these âmug-house clubsâ were to be found in Cheapside and its vicinity, and others about Covent Garden, a district which formerly abounded in well-known coffee-houses. In the eighteenth century, in Russell Street alone, were three of the most celebrated: Willâs, Buttonâs, and Tomâs. Willâs, as is well known, was closely connected with Dryden, the Tatler, and the Spectator; and its witsâ room, on the first-floor, was celebrated throughout the town. So was Buttonâs, with its lionâs head letter-box, and the young poets in the back room. Tomâs, No. 17, on the north side of Russell Street, and of a somewhat later date, was taken down in 1865. The premises remained, with but little alteration, long after they ceased to be a coffee-house. It was named after its original proprietor, Thomas West, who, November 26, 1722, 25threw himself, in a delirium, from the second-floor window into the street, and died immediately. The upper portion of the premises was the coffee-house, under which lived T. Lewis, the bookseller, Popeâs publisher.\n\nWillâs Coffee-house, known as the Witsâ, which was very celebrated in its day, was at No. 23, Russell Street, Bow Street. Dryden first made it a resort of wits. The poet used to sit in a room on the first-floor, and his customary seat was by the fireside in the winter, and at the corner of the balcony, looking over the street, in fine weather; he called the two places his winter and his summer seat. In the eighteenth century this room became the dining-room. In Drydenâs day people did not sit in boxes, as subsequently, but at various tables which were dispersed through the room. Smoking was permitted in the public room, and was then much in vogue; indeed, it does not seem to have been considered a nuisance, as it was some years later. Here, as in other similar places of meeting, the visitors divided themselves into parties; the young beaux and wits, who seldom approached the principal table, thought it a great honour to have a pinch out of Drydenâs snuff-box.\n\nIn later years Willâs Coffee-house became an open market for libels and lampoons.\n\nSwift thought little of the frequenters of Willâs; he used to say the worst conversation he ever heard in his life was to be heard there. The wits (as they were called), said he disparagingly, used formerly to assemble at this house; that is to say, five or six men who had written plays or at least prologues, 26or had a share in a miscellany, came thither, and entertained one another with their trifling compositions, assuming as grand an air as if they had been the noblest efforts of human nature, or as if the fate of kingdoms depended on them.\n\nIt was Swift who framed the rules of the Brothersâ Club, which met every Thursday. âThe end of our club,â said he, âis to advance conversation and friendship, and to reward learning without interest or recommendation. We take in none but men of wit or men of interest; and if we go on as we began, no other club in this town will be worth talking of.â\n\nThe Brothersâ, which was really a political club, broke up in 1713, and the next year Swift formed the celebrated Scriblerus Club, an association rather of a literary than a political character. Oxford and St. John, Swift, Arbuthnot, Pope, and Gay were members. Satire upon the abuse of human learning was their leading object. The name originated as follows: Oxford used playfully to call Swift Martin, and from this sprang Martinus Scriblerus. Swift, as is well known, is the name of one species of swallow (the largest and most powerful flier of the tribe), and martin is the name of another species, the wall-swallow, which constructs its nest in buildings.\n\nThe Scriblerus Club broke up owing to quarrels between Oxford and Bolingbroke. Swift tried the force of humorous expostulation in his fable of the âFagot,â where the Ministers are called upon to contribute their various badges of office to make the bundle strong and secure, but all was in vain. And at length, tired with this scene of murmuring 27and discontent, quarrel, misunderstanding, and hatred, the Dean, who was almost the only mutual friend who laboured to compose these differences, made a final effort at reconciliation; but his scheme entirely failed.\n\nButtonâs Coffee-house was another resort of wits. Here, in the early part of the reign of Queen Anne, Swift first began to come, being known as âthe mad parson.â He knew no one; no one knew him. He would lay his hat down on a table, and walk up and down at a brisk pace for half an hour without speaking to anyone, or seeming to pay attention to anything that was going forward. Then he would snatch up his hat, pay his money at the bar, and walk off without having opened his lips. At last he went one evening to a country gentleman, and very abruptly asked him: âPray, sir, do you know any good weather in the world?â After staring a little at the singularity of Swiftâs manner and the oddity of the question, the gentleman answered: âYes, sir, I thank God I remember a great deal of good weather in my time.â âThat is more,â replied Swift, âthan I can say. I never remember any weather that was not too hot or too cold, too wet or too dry; but, however God Almighty contrives it, at the end of the year âtis all very well.â\n\nAt Tomâs Coffee-house in 1764 was formed a high-class club of about 700 members, paying each a guinea subscription. A card-room was on the first-floor.\n\nThe club flourished, so that in 1768, âhaving considerably enlarged itself of late,â Thomas Haines, 28the then proprietor, took in the front room of the next house westward as a coffee-room. The front room of No. 17 was then appropriated exclusively as a card-room for the subscription club, each member paying one guinea annually, the adjoining apartment being used as a conversation-room.\n\nTom HainesâLord Chesterfield, as he was called, on account of his good mannersâwas succeeded by his son. The house ceased to be a coffee-house in 1814.\n\nIt would be interesting to know what has become of the old snuff-boxâa most curious relic. It was a big tortoiseshell box, bearing on the lid, in high relief in silver, the portraits of Charles I and Queen Anne; the Boscobel oak, with Charles II amid its branches; and at the foot of the tree, on a silver plate, was inscribed âThomas Haines.â At Willâs the small wits grew conceited if they dipped but into Mr. Drydenâs snuff-box, and at Tomâs the box probably received similar veneration.\n\nThe Bedford Coffee-house, in the north-west corner of the Piazza, was another celebrated Covent Garden resort.\n\nHere in its palmy days, about 1754, Foote reigned supreme, his great rival being Garrick, who, however, usually got the worst of the verbal duels which constantly occurred. Garrick in early life had been in the wine trade, and had supplied the Bedford with wine; he was thus described by Foote as living in Durham Yard, with three quarts of vinegar in the cellar, calling himself a wine-merchant.\n\nLeaving the Bedford one night in company with Garrick, Foote dropped a guinea; and not being 29able to find it, exclaimed: âWhere on earth can it be gone to?â âGone to the devil, I think,â replied Garrick, who had assisted in the search. âWell said, David!â was Footeâs reply. âLet you alone for making a guinea go farther than anybody else.â\n\nTom Kingâs Coffee-houseâa rough shed just beneath the portico of St. Paulâs Churchâwas a regular Covent Garden night-house. This haunt of night-birds is shown in the background of Hogarthâs print of âMorning,â where the prim maiden lady, walking to church, is confronted by two fuddled beaux from Kingâs Coffee-house caressing two frail women. At the door a drunken brawl is proceeding, whilst swords and cudgels are being freely used.\n\nThe Piazza (known in the reign of Charles I as the âPortico walkeâ) in Covent Garden, the destruction of a portion of which, in 1858, was, from an artistic point of view, to be deplored, was erected between 1634 and 1640 by Inigo Jones, who also built St. Paulâs Church for Francis, Duke of Bedford. Though a more ambitious scheme was originally conceived, only the north and east sides were, however, built, and half of the latter was destroyed by fire about the middle of the eighteenth century.\n\nSeveral distinguished artists lived in the Piazza, including Sir Peter Lely and Zoffany. Sir Godfrey Kneller came into the Piazza the year after Lely died, and the house he occupied was near the steps leading into Covent Garden Theatre. He had a garden at the back, reaching as far as Dr. Radcliffeâs, in Bow Street. Kneller was fond of flowers, and 30had a fine collection. As he was intimate with Radcliffe, he permitted him to have a door into his garden; but Radcliffeâs servants gathering and destroying the flowers, Kneller sent him word he must shut up the door. Radcliffe replied peevishly: âTell him he may do anything with it but paint it.â âAnd I,â answered Sir Godfrey, âcan take anything from him but physic.â Sir James Thornhill also lived in the same neighbourhood.\n\nThe Piazza Coffee-house, in Covent Garden, was a favourite resort of Sheridanâs. Here it was that he sat during the burning of Drury Lane Theatre in 1809, calmly taking some refreshment, which excited the astonishment of a friend. âA man may surely be allowed to take a glass of wine by his own fireside,â said Sheridan.\n\nOn the site of the Piazza Coffee-house was built the Floral Hall, in the Crystal Palace style of architecture, if the latter word be applicable to such a building. Henrietta Street, close by, was once well known for what seems to have been the first family hotel ever established in London, opened by David Low in 1774.\n\nGold, silver, and copper medals were struck and distributed by the landlord, as advertisements of his houseâthe gold to the Princes, silver to the nobility, and copper to the public generally. Mrs. Hudson succeeded him, and advertised her hotel âwith stabling for one hundred noblemen and horses.â The next proprietors were Richardson and Joy.\n\nFor years the hotel was famous for its dinner and coffee-roomâcalled the âStar,â from the 31number of men of rank who frequented it. One day the Duke of Norfolk entered the dining-room, and ordered of the waiter two lamb chops, at the same time inquiring: âJohn, have you a cucumber?â The waiter replied in the negativeâit was so early in the season; but he would step into the market and inquire if there were any. The waiter did so, and returned withââThere are a few, but they are half a guinea apiece.â âHalf a guinea apiece! Are they small or large?â âWhy, rather small.â âThen buy two,â was the reply.\n\nLow had purchased the house from the executors of James West, President of the Royal Society, and it had originally been the mansion of Sir Kenelm Digby, who had his laboratory at the back. In course of time it was practically rebuilt by the Earl of Orford, better known as Admiral Russell, who in 1692 defeated Admiral de Tourville. The faÃ§ade of the house originally resembled the forecastle of a ship, and the fine old staircase was formed of part of the vessel Admiral Russell commanded at La Hogue; on it were handsomely carved anchors, ropes, and the coronet and initials of Lord Orford, who died there in 1727. The house was afterwards occupied by Thomas, Lord Archer, who had a well-stocked garden at the back. Mushrooms and cucumbers were his especial hobby.\n\nIn course of time Evans, of Covent Garden Theatre, removed here from the Cider Cellar in Maiden Lane, and, using the large dining-room for a singing-room, prospered until 1844, when he resigned the property to Mr. John Green, well known as Paddy Green, under whose rule the 32excellence of the entertainment attracted so great an accession of visitors that there was built, in 1855, on the site of the old garden (Sir Kenelm Digbyâs), a handsome hall, to which the former singing-room formed a sort of vestibule. This was hung with portraits of celebrated actors and actresses collected by the proprietor.\n\nThe gallery was said to occupy part of the site of the cottage in which the Kembles occasionally resided during the zenith of their fame at Covent Garden Theatre. Kemble first saw the light there.\n\nIn the early seventies Evansâs ceased to attract, and, after undergoing various vicissitudes and sheltering several clubs, the house finally became the headquarters of boxing, being now occupied by the National Sporting Club. The original staircase remains, and a number of prints recalling the palmy days of the prize-ring decorate the walls of the club-house.\n\nNinety years ago, it should be added, the prize-fighting fraternity had a club of their own, called the Daffy Club, which met at the Castle Tavern, Holborn, then kept by the famous boxers, Tom Belcher and Tom Spring. The walls of the long room in which it met were adorned by a number of sporting prints and portraits of famous pugilistic heroes, amongst them Belcher himself, Gentleman Jackson, Dutch Sam, Gregson, Humphreys, Mendoza, Cribb, Molyneux, Gulley, Randall, Turner, Martin, Harmer, Spring, Neat, Hickman, Painter, Scroggins, Tom Owen, and many others.\n\nMany curiously-named clubs existed in the past. Addison, for instance, speaking of the clubs of his time, mentions several the names of which were probably merely humorous exaggerations. Names such as the Mum Club, the Ugly Club, can hardly be considered to have been in actual use.\n\nReal clubs were the Lying Club, for which untruthfulness was supposed to be an indispensable qualification; the Odd Fellowsâ Club; the Humbugs (which met at the Blue Posts, in Covent Garden); the Samsonic Society; the Society of Bucks; the Purl Drinkers; the Society of Pilgrims, held at the Woolpack, in the Kingsland Road; the Thespian Club; the Great Bottle Club; the Aristocratic âJe ne sÃ§ai quoiâ Club, held at the Star and Garter, in Pall Mall, of which the Prince of Wales and the Dukes of York, Clarence, Orleans, Norfolk, Bedford, and other notabilities, were members; the Sons of the Thames Society; the Blue Stocking Club; the âNo Pay No Liquorâ Club, held at the Queen and Artichoke, in the Hampstead Road, and of which the ceremony, on a new memberâs introduction, was, after his paying a fee on entrance of one shilling, that he should wear a hat throughout 34the first evening of his membership, made in the shape of a quart pot, and drink to the health of his brother members in a gilt goblet of ale. At Camden Town met the âSocial Villagers,â in a room at the Bedford Arms.\n\nOne of the first clubs was the October Club, composed of some hundred and fifty staunch Tories, chiefly country Members of Parliament. They met at the Bell, in King Street, Westminsterâthat street in which Spenser starved, and Drydenâs brother kept a grocerâs shop. A portrait of Queen Anne, by Dahl, hung in the club-room.\n\nAnother queer eighteenth-century institution was the Golden Fleece Club, the members of which assumed fancy names, such as Sir Timothy Addlepate, Sir Nimmy Sneer, Sir Talkative Dolittle, Sir Skinny Fretwell, Sir Rumbus Rattle, Sir Boozy Prate-all, Sir Nicholas Ninny Sip-all, Sir Gregory Growler, Sir Pay-little, and the like. The main object of this club seems to have been a very free conviviality.\n\nPerhaps the most eccentric club of all was âthe Everlasting,â which, like the modern Brook Club of New York, professed to go on for ever, its doors being kept open night and day throughout the year, whilst the members were divided into watches like sailors at sea.\n\nThe craze for queerly-named clubs lasted into the nineteenth century; for instance, the King of Clubs was the fanciful name of a society founded about 1801 by Bobus Smith. At first it consisted of a small knot of lawyers, whose clients were too few, or too civil, to molest their after-dinner 35recreations; a few literary characters; and a small number of visitors, generally introduced by those who took the chief part in conversation, and seemingly selected for the faculty of being good listeners.\n\nThe King of Clubs sat on the Saturday of each month in the Strand, at the Crown and Anchor Tavern, which at that time was a nest of boxes, each containing its club, and affording excellent cheer, though afterwards desecrated by indifferent dinners and very questionable wine. The object of the club was conversation. Everyone seemed anxious to bring his contribution of good sense or good-humour, and the members discussed books and authors and the prevalent topics of the day, except politics, which were excluded.\n\nRogers, the banker poet, was a member of the King of Clubs. His funereal appearance gained him the nickname of the Dug-up Dandy, and all sorts of jokes were made concerning him. Once, when Rogers had been at Spa, and was telling Ward (afterwards Lord Dudley) that the place was so full that he could not so much as find a bed to lie in, and that he was obliged on that account to leave it, âDear me,â replied Ward, âwas there no room in the churchyard?â At another time Murray was showing him a portrait of Rogers, observing that âit was done to the life.â âTo the death, you mean,â replied Ward. Amongst other amusing sallies of the same kind was his asking Rogers: âWhy donât you keep your hearse, Rogers? You can well afford it.â\n\nA good example of what most of the little old-fashioned clubs of other days were like is furnished 36by Prattâs, which, though not of very great antiquity, occupies curious old-world premises just off St. Jamesâs Street. This quaint and agreeable little club, still a flourishing institution, appears to have been founded about 1841; the old manuscript records of elections still exist. Though Prattâs has recently been reorganized, its distinctive features have not been impaired, and the house remains much in its original conditionâthe kitchen downstairs, with its old-fashioned open fire, quaint dresser filled with salmon-fly plates, old-world furniture and prints, forming a delightful relic of the past. A curious niche in this room would seem to have once served as a receptacle for cards or dice, in the days when the house was used for gambling, and raids by the authorities were common.\n\nNext the kitchen is the dining-room, in which is a long table; the walls here are hung with old prints of the time when the club was founded. Both this room and the kitchen have very curious mantelpieces, the upper portions of which are formed of classical friezes which would seem to have been brought here from some old mansion. Throughout the quaint little building are cases of stuffed birds and fish, and the accessories and general appearance produce a singular effect not lacking in old-world charm.\n\nPrattâs formerly opened only late in the evening, but its hours now admit of members lunching; indeed, whilst great care has been taken to preserve the original spirit of the club, many modern improvements unobtrusively carried out make it a most comfortable resort, whilst the convenience of 37members has been studied by the addition of four bedrooms.\n\nBy far the most interesting of the old dining clubs was the Sublime Society of Beefsteaks, founded about 1735 by Rich, the famous harlequin and machinist of Covent Garden Theatre. At first it consisted of twenty-four members, but the number was afterwards increased. Hogarth, Wilkes, and many other celebrated men, were members of this society, which had many curious customs.\n\nIts officials consisted of a President of the Day, Vice-President, Bishop, Recorder, and Boots.\n\nThe meetings were originally held in a room at Covent Garden Theatre.\n\nThe President took his seat after dinner throughout the season, according to the order in which his name appeared on âthe rota.â\n\nHe was invested with the badge of the society by the Boots. His duty was to give the chartered toasts in strict accordance with the list before him; to propose all resolutions that had been duly made and seconded; to observe all the ancient forms and customs of the society; and to enforce them on others. He had no sort of power inherent in his position; on the contrary, he was closely watched and sharply pulled up if he betrayed either ignorance or forgetfulness on the smallest matter of routine connected with his office. In fact, he was a target for all to shoot at.\n\nA Beefeaterâs hat and plume hung on the right-hand side of the chair behind him, and a three-cornered hat (erroneously believed to have belonged to Garrick) on the left. When putting a resolution, 38the President was bound to place the plumed hat on his head and instantly remove it. If he failed in one or the other act, he was equally reminded by being called to order in no silent terms. The most important obligation imposed on him was the necessity of singing, whether he could sing or not, the song of the day.\n\nThe Vice was the oldest member of the society present, and had to carry out the Presidentâs directions without responsibility.\n\nThe Bishop sang the grace and the anthem.\n\nThe most important official of all was the Recorder. He had to rebuke everybody for offences, real or imaginary, and with him lay the duty of delivering âthe chargeâ to each newly-elected member, which was a burlesque function.\n\nThe Boots was the last elected of the members, and there was a grave responsibility attached to his office. He was the fag of the brotherhood, and had to arrive before the dinner-hour, not only to decant the wine, but to fetch it from the cellar. This latter custom was persevered in until the destruction of the old Lyceum by fire, and was only then abandoned by reason of the inaccessibility of the cellar, when the society returned to the new theatre, the rebuilt Lyceum, in 1838. No one was exempted from this ordeal, and woe to him who shirked or neglected it. The greatest enjoyment seemed to be afforded, both to members and guests, by summoning Boots to decant a fresh bottle of port at the moment when a hot plate and a fresh steak were placed before him.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex was Boots from the date of 39his election (April, 1808) to April, 1809, when a vacancy occurred, and Mr. Arnold senior was elected, releasing His Royal Highness from the post. Indeed, until the society ceased to exist, the Duke of Leinster, who had duly served his apprenticeship (although he drank nothing stronger than water himself), constantly usurped the legitimate duties of the Boots by arriving before him and performing the accustomed, but not forgotten, services of the day.\n\nWhen any Boots showed signs of temper, or any member was unruly or infringed the rules of the society, a punishment was in store for him. It was moved and seconded that such delinquent should be put in the white sheet and reprimanded by the Recorder; and if the âAyes had itâ (and they always did have it), the sentence was carried out.\n\nThe offending party was taken from the room by two members bearing halberds, preceded by a third carrying the sword, and was brought back again in the garb of penitence (the tablecloth). Then, after a lecture from the Recorder, severe or humorous according to the nature of his offence, he was allowed to resume his place at the table.\n\nIt happened that Brother the Duke of Sussex was put in the white sheet under the following circumstances: His Royal Highness had come to the âSteaksâ with Brother Hallett, and on the road the watch-chain belonging to the latter had been cut and his bunch of seals stolen. The cloth removed, Hallett addressed the President, recounted the loss he had sustained, and charged the Duke as the perpetrator of the robbery. The case was tried 40on the spot; and the evidence having clearly established the criminality of the accused (to a Beefsteak jury), it was moved and resolved that His Royal Highness should forthwith be put into the white sheet and reprimanded for an act which might have been considered a fault had the victim been a stranger, but which became a crime when that victim was a Brother. There was no appeal. His Royal Highness reluctantly rose, was taken out in custody, brought before the Recorder (Brother Richards), and received a witty but unsparing admonition for the offence of which he had been unanimously found guilty. For a wonder, His Royal Highness took it ill. He resumed his seat, but remained silent and reserved. No wit could make him smile, no bantering could rouse him, and at an unusually early hour he ordered his carriage and went away.\n\nThe next day Mr. Arnold, who had been the mover of the resolution, went to the palace to smooth the ruffled plumes of his royal confrÃ¨re, and took his son with him. In those days the Duke rode on horseback, and as they turned out of the gate leading from the gardens to the portico his horse was at the door and His Royal Highness in the act of coming out. By the time they neared the entrance his foot was in the stirrup, and he saw them approaching. Without a momentâs hesitation he withdrew his foot, released the bridle, and, with both his enormous hands extended, advanced three or four steps to meet Mr. Arnold.\n\nâI know what youâve come about,â he called loudly out in his accustomed note (probably B flat), 41and wringing both Mr. Arnoldâs hands until he winced with painââI know what youâve come about! I made a fool of myself last night. You were quite right, and I quite wrong, so I shall come next Saturday and do penance again for my bad temper.â\n\nSometimes a member turned sulky when made to do penance. On one occasion an individual of a touchy disposition was put into the white sheet and brought before the President, who admonished him as a parent would a childâa Beefsteak sermon without its usual bathos. The recipient listened to the harangue without moving a muscle of his face. The lecture done, he resumed his seat, but at the next meeting sent in his resignation.\n\nSaturday was the day on which the dinners were held. Each member was allowed to bring one visitor. If he brought a second, he had to borrow a name; in default of obtaining it, the visitor was doomed to retire.\n\nVisitors, unlike members, were not subjected to any humorous penalties, but were most ceremoniously treated. They were never unduly urged to drink more than might be agreeable to them; one bumper in the evening was alone imperative, but it might be drunk in water. They were never pressed, though always asked, to sing. A âsuggestionâ to sing was the adopted word.\n\nThe only call to which it was imperative for the visitor to respond was âa toast.â If he hesitated too long, he was, perhaps abruptly, told he might give anything the world producedâman, woman, or child, or any sentiment, social or otherwise. Sometimes 42it happened that such prompting was in vain, and the confused guest would nine times out of ten propose the only toast he was prohibited from givingââThe prosperity of the Sublime Society of Beefsteaks.â\n\nMembers were responsible for their guests, who were made to understand that whatever passed within the walls of the S.S.B.S. was sacred. William Jerdan, Editor of the Literary Gazette, was a visitor, and at a late hour he was observed to take a note of a brilliant repartee that had been made.\n\nThe President, by whose side he sat, pointed to the motto over the chimney-piece:\n\nâJerdan,â he said, âyou understand those words?â\n\nâI understand one,â said Jerdan, looking sharply roundââsit; and I mean to do it.â\n\nAuthors, and dramatic authors in particular, were mercilessly chaffed when they dined with the Sublime Society. Cobb, whose farce âThe First-Floorâ achieved great popularity, used to accept the satire and raillery of members with great good-humour, generally silencing them one by one. Storace composed some of his finest music for Cobbâs comic operas, âThe Haunted Towerâ and âThe Siege of Belgrade,â which achieved success. An Indian opera, âRamah DrÃ»g,â did not. Cobb was much chaffed about these operas, especially about the first-named.\n\nâWhy ever,â one night said Arnold, âdid you 43call your opera by such a name? There was no spirit in it from beginning to end!â âAnyhow,â exclaimed another inveterate punster, ââRamah DrÃ»gâ was the most appropriate title possible, for it was literally ramming a drug down the public throat.â âTrue,â rejoined Cobb; âbut it was a drug that evinced considerable power, for it operated on the public twenty nights in succession.â âMy good friend,â said Arnold triumphantly, âthat was a proof of its weakness, if it took so long in working.â âYou are right, Arnold, in that respect,â retorted Cobb. âYour playâ (Arnold had brought out a play, which did not survive the first night) âhad the advantage of mine, for it was so powerful a drug as to be thrown up as soon as it was taken!â\n\nThe first and last Saturdays of the season, and the Saturday in Easter week, were âprivate.â\n\nOn these days no visitors were invited. The accounts were gone into, and the amount of the âwhipâ to regulate the past or accruing expenses decided, the qualifications of such candidates as were anxious, on the occasion of a vacancy, to join the society discussed, and other matters connected with its well-being debated.\n\nEach member paid 5s. for his dinner, and 10s. 6d. for his guest. The entrance fee was Â£26 5s. until 1849, when it was reduced to Â£10 10s., and there were generally two annual whips of Â£5 each.\n\nAfter the destruction of Covent Garden Theatre, where it had met for seventy years, the Sublime Society of Beefsteaks migrated to the Bedford Coffee-house, where it remained till the building of the Lyceum Theatre in 1809, in a special room 44of which it took up its abode till 1830, when the Lyceum also was burnt down.\n\nAfter this it adjourned to the Lyceum Tavern, in the Strand, and thence returned to the Bedford Coffee-house, where it remained until 1838, when a suite of rooms was built for it under the new roof of the Lyceum. The original gridiron, dug out of the ruins of Covent Garden and the Lyceum, formed the centre ornament of the dining-room ceiling. The entire room and ceiling were in Gothic architecture, and the walls were hung with paintings and engravings of past and present members, the former the work of Brother Lonsdale. Folding-doors, the entire width of the room, connected it with an anteroom. When the doors were opened on the announcement of dinner, an enormous grating in the form of a gridiron, through which the fire was seen and the steaks handed, afforded members a view of the kitchen.\n\nThere was no blackballing, but every would-be member had to be invited at least twice as a guest, in order that his qualifications might be ascertained, and then, if he were put up, he was certain to be elected. As a matter of fact, the formality of a ballot was gone through, though there were no rejections.\n\nWhen a new member was initiated, he and the visitors were requested after dinner to withdraw to an anteroom, where port and punch were provided for them.\n\nThe newly-elected member was then brought in blindfolded, accompanied on his right by the Bishop with his mitre on, and holding the volume in which the oath of allegiance to the rules of the society 45was inscribed, while on his left stood some other member holding the sword of state. Behind were the halberdiers. These were all decked out in the most incongruous and absurd dressesâin all probability originally obtained from Covent Garden Theatre.\n\nâThe chargeâ was then delivered by the Recorder. In it he dwelt on the solemnity of the obligations the new member was about to take on himself. He was made to understand, in tones alternately serious and gay, the true brotherly spirit of the Sublime Society of Beefsteaks; that while a perfect equality existed among the Brethren, such equality never should be permitted to degenerate into undue familiarity; that while badinage was encouraged in the freest sense of the word, such badinage must never approach to a personality; and that good fellowship must be united with good breeding. Above all, attention was drawn to the Horatian motto over the chimney-piece, and the aspirant was warned that ignominious expulsion was the fate of him who carried beyond those walls words uttered there in friendshipâs confidence.\n\nThat done, the following oath, dating from the origin of the society, was administered:\n\n46This was read aloud, clause by clause, by the Bishop, and repeated by the candidate; at the end the book was rapidly exchanged by the cook, who was called the Serjeant, for the bone of beef that had served for the dayâs dinner, carefully protected by a napkin, and after the words\n\nhe was desired to kiss the book. Instead of this he kissed its substitute, and by reason of a friendly downward pressure from behind he generally did so most devoutly.\n\nThe bandage was then removed from his eyes; the book on which he had sworn the oath was still before him; and amid the laughter and congratulations of his Brethren he again took his seat as a member of the Sublime Society, and the excluded guests were readmitted.\n\nThe Serjeant was a very important figure at the meetings of the Sublime Society, and the office was well filled by Heardson, the cook, whose picture was engraved by J. R. Smith (the print hangs in the modern Beefsteak). So great was his affection for the âSocietyâ that one of his last requests was to be carried into the club-room to take a farewell glance at the familiar scene, and this he was allowed to do.\n\nA great supporter of the Beefsteak Society was the old Duke of Norfolk, and when he dined there he would be ceremoniously ushered to the chair after dinner, and invested with an orange-coloured ribbon, to which a silver medal, in the form of a gridiron, was suspended. In the chair he comported himself with great urbanity and good-humour.\n\n47Above all things, this Duke of Norfolk loved long sittings, during which he would consume prodigious quantities of wine, which seemed to affect him but very little. Occasionally, however, towards the close of the evening, the Duke, without exhibiting any symptom of inebriety, became immovable in his chair, as if deprived of all muscular volition. When at his own house he had an especial method of obviating the inconveniences of such a state, and would ask someone to ring the bell three times. This was the signal for bringing in a kind of easy litter, consisting of four equidistant belts, fastened together by a transverse one, which four domestics placed under him, and thus removed his enormous bulk, with a gentle swinging motion, up to his apartment. Upon these occasions the Duke would say nothing, but the whole thing was managed with great system and in perfect silence.\n\nAnother prominent member was Charles Morris, who greatly enlivened the dinners by his wit, high spirits, and singing. When he was in town nothing kept him away, even when he was nearly eighty years of age.\n\nâDie when you will, Charles,â said Curran, âyouâll die in your youth.â And his words were verified, for his spirits remained unquenched till within a few days of his death. Morris wrote many songs which he would sing himself. The following is a specimen of his talents in that direction:\n\nIn his eighty-sixth year Morris bade adieu to the Sublime Society in verse, but four years later, in 1835, he revisited it, and the members then presented him with a large silver bowl, appropriately inscribed, as a testimonial of their affectionate esteem.\n\nAs was his habit, Morris did not fail to allude to the gift in verse:\n\nThe bowl in question eventually passed into the hands of the present Beefsteak Club; most unfortunately, it was some years ago taken away by thieves, who managed to obtain access to the club premises, and it has never been recovered.\n\nCharles Morris had very slender means to support his family, but owing to the generosity of the old Duke of Norfolk he was able to retire to a charming rural retreat near Dorking, embosomed amidst the undulating elevations of Surrey. Here, however, 49he seems not to have been entirely at ease, regretting no doubt the sweet, shady side of Pall Mall, of which he had so gracefully sung.\n\nThe Duke assisted Morris, owing, it was said, to the kindly suggestion of Kemble, the actor, who one night had been dining at Norfolk House when the Beefsteak bard had also formed one of the party. When the latter had gone, a few guests only remaining with the Duke, who liked late sittings, His Grace began to deplore, somewhat pathetically, the smallness of the stipend upon which poor Charles was obliged to support his family, observing that it was a discredit to the age that a man who had so long gladdened the lives of so many titled and opulent associates should be left to struggle with the difficulties of an inadequate income at a time of life when he had no reasonable hope of augmenting it. Kemble, who had been listening attentively, then broke out in peculiarly emphatic tones: âAnd does your Grace sincerely lament the destitute condition of your friend, with whom you have passed so many agreeable hours? Your Grace has described that condition most feelingly. But is it possible that the greatest peer of the realm, luxuriating amidst the prodigalities of fortune, should lament the distress which he does not relieve? The empty phrase of benevolence, the mere breath and vapour of generous sentiment, become no man; they certainly are unworthy of your Grace. Providence, my Lord Duke, has placed you in a station where the wish to do good and the doing it are the same thing. An annuity from your overflowing coffers, or a small nook of 50land clipped from your unbounded domains, would scarcely be felt by your Grace; but you would be repaid with usury, with tears of grateful joy, with prayers warm from a bosom which your bounty will have rendered happy.â\n\nThe Duke said nothing at the time, except stare with astonishment at so unexpected a lecture; but not a month elapsed before Charles Morris was snugly invested in a beautiful sequestered retreat surrounded by pretty grounds.\n\nCaptain Morris lived to the age of ninety-two, dying in July, 1838. He lies in Betchworth Churchyard, near the east end; his grave is simply marked by a head- and foot-stone, with an inscription of three or four lines; he who had sung the praises of so many choice spirits has not here a stanza to his own memory.\n\nAs time went on, the old customs and toasts of the Sublime Society became out of date, and, though certain modifications were attempted, it ceased to exist in 1869, when its effects were sold. The following is a list of the most important of them.\n\nAn oak dining-table with Presidentâs cap, a mitre and a gridiron carved in three separate circular compartments at the top. This relic of past conviviality is now at Whiteâs Club, having been purchased by the Hon. Algernon Bourke some years ago.\n\nA carved oak Presidentâs chairânow, I believe, at Sandringhamâand a number of membersâ chairs copied in oak from the Glastonbury Chair, the backs carved with the gridiron and the arms and initials of each member. A few of these chairs belong to a firm of brewers.\n\n51Forty-seven engraved portraits of members, glazed in oak frames, on which were metal gridirons. One or two of these are in the possession of the present Beefsteak Club.\n\nOther objets dâart and curiosities wereâ\n\nThe ribbon and badge of the President in the form of a silver gridiron, dated 1735.\n\nTwo brown stoneware jugs, with silver lids and mounts, the thumb-pieces gridirons.\n\nA fine couteau de chasse, with engraved and pierced blade, the handle formed of a group of Mars, Venus, and Cupid, in silver, the mounting of the sheath of open-work silver, chased with arabesque figures, scrolls, and flowers. The reputed work of Benvenuto Cellini; inscribed âEx Dono Antonio Askew, M.D.â\n\nAn oval ivory snuff-box, with a cameo of Dante on the lid and inscription inside: âPresented to the S.S.B.S. by B. G. B. [Dr. Babington], an honorary member. The cameo of Dante on the lid of this box was carved by its donor, and its wood formed part of a mummy-case brought by him from Egypt in 1815; the surrounding ivory was turned by a friendââin a leather case.\n\nA circular snuff-box, formed of oak dug from the ruins of the old Lyceum Theatre, after its destruction by fire; a silver shield engraved with the gridiron on the lid.\n\nA wooden punch-ladle, with open-work handle, and ten doilys.\n\nA cigar-case, formed of a curious piece of oak.\n\nA pair of halberds.\n\nA large Oriental punch-bowl, enamelled with 52figures, butterflies, and flowers, inside and out, in a case. Presented by Lord Saltoun, K.G.\n\nAnother enamelled with figures and baskets of flowers in medallions, with red and gold scale borders. Presented by Baron Heath.\n\nA ditto, enamelled with figures.\n\nA fluted ditto, with flowers.\n\nThe Presidentâs hat, a hat said to have belonged to Garrick, and a Cardinalâs hat.\n\nThe mitre of the late Cardinal Gregorio, presented to the Sublime Society of the Beefsteaks by Brother W. Somerville, in silk case.\n\nFacsimile of an agreement between Rich and C. Fleetwood, framed and glazed.\n\nBust of John Wilkes, in marble.\n\nThere was in addition to this a certain amount of plate, including cases of silver forks, engraved with membersâ names. One of these cases now belongs to the Beefsteak Club.\n\nAt one time the members wore a uniform consisting of a blue coat and buff waistcoat, with brass buttons impressed with the gridiron and motto, âBeef and Liberty.â\n\nThey also wore rings bearing the same devices. One of these rings, presented within recent years by a member, is in the Beefsteak Club, which also possesses a number of badges and other relics connected with the Sublime Society and with the Ad Libitum Club, a kindred organization, of which Heardson also appears to have been the cook.\n\nThe device of the Ad Libitum was more ornate and graceful than that of the Sublime Society, with 53which it seems to have been closely connected, though membership of the one did not necessarily imply membership of the other. As far as can be ascertained, no records of the Ad Libitum have been preserved.\n\nThe present Beefsteak Clubâless convivial in its ways than the Sublime Societyâwas founded about 1876, and its original dining-place was a room in the building known till its demolition, some years ago, as Tooleâs Theatre. When this was pulled down, it migrated to premises specially built for it in Green Street, Leicester Square. The membership is small, and consists mostly of men well known in the political, theatrical, and literary worlds. Opening only in the afternoon, it is used chiefly as a place for dining and supping amidst congenial and pleasant conversation.\n\nThe club consists of one long room, which has a high-pitched roof in the design of which gridirons are cleverly interposed. Here are hung a quantity of old prints, the majority of them after Hogarth. A number of etchings by Whistler (who was a member) are also to be seen. The Beefsteak owns a good deal of silver, much of which has been presented from time to time by members; the practice of giving plate being a usage of the club. The most valuable possession is a tankard of solid gold, on which are inscribed the names of those members who took part in the Boer War. This was purchased by subscription amongst the members. The example of the Sublime Society is followed in respect of there being one long 54table in the place of the separate small ones in use at other clubs.\n\nThere formerly existed a number of curious dining societies and clubs in the provinces, and some of these still survive, amongst the number of which is the Chelmsford Beefsteak Club, established in 1768. There does not appear to be any book older than 1781, but in the middle of a book which commences in 1829 is written a list of the members from February 5, 1768, to October 18, 1850; and as the whole is in the same handwriting, it is clear the earlier lists of members must have been copied from an older book, which has now disappeared.\n\nThe oldest book in the possession of the club is one for entering the attendances of members, and commences October 12, 1781. At that time the members appear to have dined together weekly.\n\nAt the monthly dinners of the club, the chairman proposes the following toasts:\n\n(a) âChurch and Queen.â\n\n(b) âThe Prince of Wales and the Rest of the Royal Family.â\n\n(c) âOur Absent Members.â\n\n(d) âOur Visitors, if any.â\n\nNo one is allowed to stand when proposing or replying to a toast.\n\nMorning dress is worn at dinner.\n\nOne of the last of the old school of members of this club was Admiral Johnson, elected 1842, who was the midshipman who supported Nelsonâs head as he lay dying in the cockpit of the Victory. It was no uncommon thing for the Admiral to have 55three bottles of port put before him at 8 oâclock, which he consumed by about 9.30. He was always called upon for a song, and he used to sing about fourteen verses of âOn board the Arethusa.â His usual hour for retirement was about 10.30, when he would be escorted to his pony, and would ride home to Baddow, three miles away. Admiral Johnson remembered the time when the fine for any member being unfortunate enough to be presented with twins by his wife was the presentation of a pair of buckskin breeches to each member of the club, and he boasted of still possessing a pair that Thomas W. Bramston, whilst member for the county, had to pay him.\n\nAt many old county dining clubs penalties of this sort were enforced: members were fined for marrying, for becoming a father, or for moving to another house; and such fines usually consisted of a certain number of bottles of wine. Other quaint usages included the forfeiture of some small sum for refusing to take the chair at dinner or for leaving it to ring the bell, for allowing a stranger to pay for anything consumed, and similar delinquencies.\n\nAnother Beefsteak Club was that at Cambridge, the members of which belonged to the University. This club, now for some years in abeyance, was a quaint survival from the past, and exactly reproduced the dinner of eighteenth-century sportsmen. Twenty-five years ago, when it still flourished, it usually consisted of but four or five members, but guests could be invited. The dining costume was a blue cutaway coat with brass buttons, and buff 56waistcoat, the tie being secured with a bullâs head. The dinner was entirely composed of various dishes of beef, beer only being drunk; some curious old songs were sung, and the toasts, regulated by inflexible precedent, were drunk in port from glasses of a size regulated by immemorial custom. Amongst these toasts was the health of the late Mr. Bowes, who, when he was an undergraduate at Cambridge, won the Derby with Mundig. This horse, after a tremendous struggle, beat Ascot, belonging to the present writerâs grandfather, by half a neck.\n\nThe dinners used to be held at the Red Lion Inn, the head-waiter of which hostelry, Dunn by name, was supposed to be the only individual alive accurately acquainted with the exact rules and traditions of the club. The proceedings were enlivened by music played on a fiddle by a well-known Cambridge character, White-headed Bob.\n\nThe Cambridge Beefsteak Club possessed a good deal of plate, valued at about Â£1,500. It had also an income of some Â£200 a year, arising from sums of money left to it by former members.\n\nA somewhat similar Cambridge dining club was the True Blue, which also had few members. They met several times in a term, wearing eighteenth-century dress and white wigs; as a matter of fact, the cost of this costume often deterred men from joining, as did the rule that a new member should drink off a bottle of claret at a draught. This unpleasant custom, which might well have been modified, seems to have killed the club, for I fancy that, like the Cambridge Beefsteak, it has not met for many years.\n\n57A remarkable little provincial club which flourished at Norwich at the beginning of the nineteenth century was the Hole-in-the-Wall Club, where a number of clever men used to meet. One of the principal figures here was Dr. Frank Sayers, a poet of no mean inspiration, a sound antiquary, an elegant scholar, and an accomplished gentleman. His accustomed chair was kept for him every Monday, and it would have been a profanation had any other occupant filled it. He was a man of admirable wit, and the characters around him, which no skill of selection could have got together in any other club or in any other town, afforded unfailing objects of his innocent and unwounding pleasantry.\n\nAmongst other eccentric frequenters of the Hole-in-the-Wall was Ozias Lindley, a Minor Canon of the cathedral, and Sheridanâs brother-in-law. He was subject, beyond anyone living, to fits of absent-mindedness. He out-Parson-Adamized Parson Adams. One Sunday morning, as he was riding through the Close, on his way to serve his curacy, his horse threw off a shoe. A lady whom he had just passed, having remarked it, called out to him: âSir, your horse has just cast one of his shoes.â âThank you, madam,â returned Ozias; âwill you, then, be kind enough to put it on?â In preaching, he often turned over two or three pages at once of his sermon; and when a universal titter and stare convinced him of the transition, he observed coolly, âI find I have omitted a considerable part of my sermon, but it is not worth going back for,â and then went on to the end.\n\n58Hudson Gurney, at one time M.P. for Newport, Isle of Wight, was also a frequenter of the snug club-room of the Hole-in-the-Wall, and used to bask in the sunshine of Sayersâs festive conversation. His own heart, too, at that time beat high with frolic and hilarity. Hudsonâs was, from his earliest prime, a clear, distinguishing intellect. He was a well-read man, and his poetry, no fragment of which is in print, except his admirable translation of the Cupid and Psyche of Apuleius into English verse, was by no means of a secondary kind.\n\nAt this club William Taylor smoked his evening pipe, and lost himself in the cloudier fumes of German metaphysics and German philology. Taylorâs translation of BÃ¼rgerâs âLeonore,â though apparently now forgotten, was said to be better than the original. While his erudition was unlimited, however, it was principally concerned with books that were not readable by others. His most amusing quality (and it was that which kept an undying grin upon the laughter-loving face of Sayers) was his everlasting love of hypothesis, and it was impossible to withstand the imperturbable gravity with which he put forth his wild German paradoxes. He proved, to the thorough dissatisfaction of those who knew not how to confute him, and to the unspeakable amusement of those who thought it not worth their whileâand that, too, by a chemical analysis of colours, and the processes by which animal heat and organic structure affect themâthat the first race of mankind was green! Green, he said, was the primal colour of vegetable existenceâthe first raiment in which Nature leaped 59into existence; the colour on which the eye loved to repose; and, in the primeval state, the first quality that attracted man to man, and bound him up in the circles of those tender charities and affinities which kept the early societies of the race together.\n\nAt one time Edinburgh was celebrated for its quaint clubs, one of which was the Soaping Club, the motto of which was, that âEvery man should soap his own beardââthat is, âindulge his own humour.â The Lawn-market Club was an association of dram-drinking, gossiping citizens, who met every morning early, and, after proceeding to the post-office to pick up letters and news, adjourned to the public-house to talk and drink. The Edinburgh, a âVisceraâ club, flourished till quite a late date; the members of this were pledged to dine off food from the entrails of animals, such as kidneys, liver, and tripe. This club seems to have rather resembled the more modern Haggis Club.\n\nThere were at one time a number of parochial clubs in London. That of the parish of St. Margaretâs, Westminster, which still exists, and which consists of âPast Overseers,â possesses a unique heirloom, which is at the same time an important chronological record of public events.\n\nIn 1713 a small fourpenny tobacco-box, bought at Horn Fair, Charlton, Kent, was presented by Mr. Monck, a member of the Society of Past Overseers, to his colleagues.\n\nSeven years later, in 1720, the donor was commemorated by the addition of a silver lid to the box. In 1726 a silver side case and bottom were 60added. In 1740 an embossed border was placed upon the lid, and the under-part enriched with an emblem of Charity. In 1746 Hogarth engraved inside the lid a bust of the Duke of Cumberland, with allegorical figures and scroll commemorating the Battle of Culloden. In 1765 an interwoven scroll was added to the lid, enclosing a plate with the arms of the City of Westminster, and inscribed: âThis Box to be delivered to every succeeding set of Overseers, on penalty of five guineas.â\n\nThe original Horn box being thus ornamented, additional ornamentation in the shape of cases continued to be provided by the senior overseers for the time being. These were embellished with silver plates engraved with emblematical and historical subjects and busts. Among the first are a view of the fireworks in St. Jamesâs Park to celebrate the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, 1749; Admiral Keppelâs action off Ushant, and his acquittal after a court-martial; the Battle of the Nile; the repulse of Admiral Linois, 1804; the Battle of Trafalgar, 1805; the action between the San Fiorenzo and La PiÃ©montaise, 1808; the Battle of Waterloo, 1815; the bombardment of Algiers, 1816; view of the House of Lords at the trial of Queen Caroline; the Coronation of George IV; and his visit to Scotland, 1822.\n\nFeatures of great interest are: Portraits of John Wilkes, churchwarden in 1759; Nelson, Duncan, Howe, Vincent; Fox and Pitt, 1806; George IV as Prince Regent, 1811; the Princess Charlotte, 1817; and Queen Charlotte, 1818.\n\nIn 1813 a large silver plate was added to the outer 61case, with a portrait of the Duke of Wellington, commemorating the centenary of the agglomeration of the box. Local occurrences are also commemorated: The interior of Westminster Hall, with the Westminster Volunteers attending Divine service at the drumhead on the Fast Day, 1803; the Old Sessions House; a view of St. Margaretâs from the north-east; the west front tower; and the altar-piece. On the outside of the first case is a clever engraving of a cripple. The top of the second case represents the Governors of the Poor in their board-room. It bears this inscription: âThe original Box and cases to be given to every succeeding set of Overseers, on penalty of fifty guineas, 1783.â\n\nIn 1785 Mr. Gilbert exhibited the box to some friends after dinner. That night thieves broke into his house, and carried off all the plate that had been in use; but the box had been removed beforehand to a bedchamber.\n\nIn 1793 Mr. Read, a Past Overseer, detained the box because his accounts were not passed. An action was brought for its recovery, which was long delayed, owing to two members of the society giving Read a release, which he successfully pleaded as a bar to the action. This rendered it necessary to take proceedings in equity, and a bill was filed in Chancery against all three, Read being compelled to deposit the box with Master Leeds until the end of the suit. Three years of litigation ensued. Eventually the Chancellor directed the box to be restored to the Overseersâ Society, and Mr. Read paid in costs Â£300. The extra costs amounted to Â£76 13s. 11d., owing to the illegal proceedings of 62Mr. Read. The sum of Â£91 7s. was at once raised, and the surplus spent upon a third case of octagon shape. The top records the triumph: Justice trampling upon a prostrate man, from whose face a mask falls upon a writhing serpent. A second plate, on the outside of the fly-lid, represents the Lord Chancellor Loughborough pronouncing his decree for the restoration of the box, March 5, 1796.\n\nOn the fourth case is shown the anniversary meeting of the Past Overseersâ Society, with the churchwardens giving the charge previous to delivering the box to the succeeding overseer. He, on his side, is bound to produce it at certain parochial entertainments, with at least three pipes of tobacco, under the penalty of six bottles of claret, and to return the whole, with some addition, safe and sound, under a penalty of 200 guineas.\n\nIn more recent days additions to this box, forming records of various important public events, have from time to time been added. A tobacco-stopper of mother-of-pearl, with a silver chain, is enclosed within the box, and completes this unique memorial.\n\nThe original clubland of the West End was St. Jamesâs Street, where the first clubs originated from coffee-houses. In this historic thoroughfareâthe âdear old Street of Clubs and Cribs,â as Frederick Locker called itâmost of the sociable institutions founded many decades ago still flourish.\n\nSuch are Whiteâs, Arthurâs, Brooksâs, the Cocoa-tree, and Boodleâs, the latter of which, after passing through a crisis which came near closing its doors for ever, now once again flourishes as of yore.\n\nThis club-house was built about 1765 by John Crunden, from the designs of Adam, but between 1821 and 1824 certain alterations and additions were carried out from the designs of John Papworth, an architect of that day.\n\nFrom an architectural point of view, Boodleâs is an admirable specimen of the work of Robert Adam; its street faÃ§ade possesses many fine qualities, whilst the ironwork is of good design.\n\nA year or two ago it was rumoured that, in order to comply with a clause in the lease, an additional story was to be added to the building. Up to the present time, however, to the gratification of all possessing the slightest taste, no alteration has been 64made; and it is earnestly to be hoped that in these days, when there is so much prating of culture and love of art, such an act of vandalism (which it is understood the club itself would bitterly deplore) will not be committed.\n\nThe saloon on the first-floor at Boodleâs has a very fine and stately appearance, and opening out of it on each side are two little rooms. One of these, according to tradition, was, in the days of high play, occupied by a cashier who issued counters and occupied himself with details connected with the game; the other was reserved for members wishing to indulge in gaming undisturbed by the noise of the crowd which thronged around the faro tables in the saloon. These tables, it is said, are still in the club. Towards the middle of the last century, though gaming had long ceased to take place in the saloon, there was a great deal of high gambling in the card-room upstairs. As far as can be ascertained, faro was once again played at that period.\n\nBoodleâs in old days played a great part in fashionable West End life. One of Gillrayâs caricatures, entitled âA Standing Dish at Boodleâs,â represents Sir Frank Standish sitting at a window of this club, which, it may be added, was noted for the large number of Baronets who were members. It was, indeed, said that anyone uttering the words, âWhere is Sir John?â in the club-house would immediately find himself surrounded by a crowd of members.\n\nBoodleâs, it should be added, has always been closely connected with Shropshire, from which county its membership then, as now, was largely recruited.\n\n65The club was originally called the Savoir Vivre, and at its inception was noted for its costly gaieties; in 1774, for instance, its members spent 2,000 guineas upon a ridotto or masquerade.\n\nGibbon was a member of Boodleâs, which, however, in the past, as to-day, principally consisted of county gentlemen.\n\nUp to comparatively recent years, before Boodleâs was reorganized, it was managed, not by a committee, but by a species of secret tribunal, the members of which were supposed to be unknown, though their duties corresponded with those of an ordinary club committee. This conclave conducted its proceedings with great secrecy, and its very existence was only inferred from the fact that, at intervals varying from six months to fifteen years, some printed notice appeared in the club rooms. Even so, this generally affected only dogs or strangers, both of whom old-fashioned members regarded with about equal dislike as unpleasant intrude"
