        "text": "I might perhaps first catch up with the small social events of the last week. (I shall not apologise further for my scrappy note of Tuesday, as I shall assume henceforth that you know that it is much more painful for me to be reduced to writing such a brief message than it can be for you to receive it). OnEliots, the T. S.;e6 Saturday we went to tea with a Mr. and Mrs. Herbert in Kensington.1 AllHerbert, John Alexander ('Sandy');a1 I know about them isUnderhill, Evelyn;a9 that we met them at the Stuart Moores, that Mr. H. is a retired Curator of Manuscripts in the British Museum, thatHerbert, Alice (née Baker);a1 Mrs. H. is an extremely Kensingtonian lady who writes popular novels,2 and that she is the mother of Ivy Litvinoff the wife of the Bolshevik Minister for Foreign Affairs.3 They are obviously poor but cultivated, in a very small flat indeed. AndGrigson, Geoffreymeets TSE;a1 there I met a young Grigson, an amiable journalist, withGrigson, Frances (née Galt);a1 a pretty little wife, who is the daughter of some old friends of my sister Marion’s in St. Louis and was born in Vandeventer Place.4 IfAmericaSt. Louis, Missouri;h4;a6 all young St. Louis women are like her, then they have very pleasant voices and are pleasant and attractive: it was odd to meet one of the next generation from my native town – and I am filled with curiosity to learn what St. Louis will be like.\n\nOn Monday an equally interesting social encounter. OurGeorge, Robert Esmonde Gordon ('Robert Sencourt');b5 Robert Sencourt, who has been staying with us, met at Lady Burghclere’s anNorton, Elizabeth ('Lily') Gaskellvisits the Eliots;a1 Elizabeth Norton, daughter of Charles E., who expressed some interest, and consequently came in to see us on Monday evening (the Bank Holiday weekend having passed off not too unpleasantly without any long motor drives – I suppose I have mastered the mysteries of double-declutching and reversing by now?) SheNorton, Elizabeth ('Lily') GaskellTSE takes liking to;a2 is the first one of the Norton family whom I have met – somewhere about sixty, I should say – and I liked her and was rather proud of her: she is intelligent, humorous, very perceptive, and quite a woman of the world, dislikes bores, is (quite disconcertingly for me) an Episcopalian, unpretentious, and altogether of good breeding. It is always a satisfaction to me to like my relatives (and I do, nearly all) whether near or remote; and this one (who knew about as little about me as anyone could know) seemed to have an immediate and kindly perception of the domestic situation.5\n\nOn Tuesday to tea to Miss Dormer’s (another elderly friend of Robert’s) whereBurdett, Fr Francis, SJ;a1 was Father Burdett (brotherGwyer, Lady Alsina;a1 of Lady Gwyer who was formerly the Gwyer of Faber & Gwyer the predecessor of Faber & Faber) whom I knew already. InStephens, Jamescompared to TSE;a7 theSpeaight, Robert;a3 eveningMirrlees, Hope;a4 a number of people came in – the James Stephens’s, Robert Speaight the actor, Hope Mirrlees: I found that very fatiguing, as I find Stephens always fatiguing – he is such a ‘brilliant talker’, and one of those very quickwitted persons who can talk without more than half meaning anything they say – and I am one of those slow minded people who cannot bear to make any remark that they do not wholly mean: a good deal of poetry was read or recited. I decided that Stephens is a poet in a sense in which I am not and never could be – he is so interested in poetry and not really seriously in anything else – and I can only be interested in poetry in so far as I am interested in a lot of other things. YesterdayHodgson, Ralphelegised on departure;b3 IMorley, Frank Vigorjoins farewell lunch for Hodgson;a8 had lunch for the last time with Ralph Hodgson – Morley, who appreciates Hodgson, came too – at Ridgway’s in Piccadilly – laterMirrlees, Hope;a5, to Hope Mirrlees’ to tea, whereThurston, Fr Herbert, SJ;a1 wereBirrell, Francis;a3 Father Thurston S.J.6 and Francis Birrell; inEliots, the T. S.join farewell dinner for the Hodgsons;e7 theHodgsons, thethe Eliots share farewell dinner with;a6 evening a farewell to Hodgson and Aurelia.7\n\nHodgsonHodgsons, thewill be missed;a7Bolliger, AureliaHodgsons, theHodgson, RalphHodgsons, the is leaving to-day, and I shall miss them both very keenly. They go back to Japan for three years – and what will happen before they return? I have never become so fond of any man in one short season – I have only known him since November, I think – but count him as one of my dearest friends. He charms everyone – by his goodness, sincerity, generosity and most sensitive good manners – youWilberforce, Pamela Margaret (TSE's secretary)advised on Staffordshire Terriers;a3 should have seen him here yesterday when IdogsStaffordshire Terrier;d2Hodgson advises Miss Wilberforce on;a1 got him in to advise Miss Wilberforce about breeding from her Staffordshire terrier.8 Yet he comes, I think, of very plain farming stock in Yorkshire, and retains his strict non-Conformist principles – a tee-totaler [sic] all his life etc – yet the most adaptable man to any society that I have ever known. He also makes you feel that every friend of his has at least a little of his pure quality: ISassoon, SiegfriedHodgson's affection for encourages TSE's;a3 should never have made anything of Siegfried Sassoon but for the fact that Hodgson is fond of him. AndHodgson, Ralph'The Song of Honour';b7 one poem of his ‘The Song of Honour’ is I think something permanent: he has written nothing for years. WeHodgson, Ralphexchanges walking-sticks with TSE;b4 exchanged walkingsticks for three years – agreeddogsBlue Bedlington Terrier;b6TSE fantasises with Hodgson about breeding;a3 thatdogsBull Terrier;b8Hodgson fantasises with TSE about breeding;a3 we would try to live near each other in the country when he returned – and that he would breed Bull Terriers and I Blue Bedlingtons.9 HeHodgson, Ralphreveals intention to propose to Miss Bollinger;b5 toldBolliger, AureliaRalph Hodgson confides in TSE his desire to marry;a4 me at the last in the greatest confidence that before I saw him again he expected that he and Aurelia would be married – which gave me great happiness (he made a very unfortunate marriage years ago – which is in process of dissolution).\n\nAnd that’s all my diary. OverCharles Eliot Norton Lectures (afterwards The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism)outlined;a8 the weekend (besides reading five manuscript books) I made a first outline of my lectures, and shall try to write, or start, the first one over this weekend. NowWilliamson, Hugh RossThe Poetry of T. S. Eliot;a2 IWilliamson, Hugh Rossintroduces TSE to his bibliographer;a1 am waiting for a lady who is said to be compiling a bibliography of my worx, in connexion with a book about me which is being written by one Hugh Ross Williamson;10 and after that our committee lunches here at one o’clock – only Stewart,11 Morley and myself – theFabers, the;a7 FabersFaber, Geoffrey;b5 have gone to their place in Wales, andde la Mare, Richard;a1 De la Mare12 is away on holiday and his mother-in-law has died – but there are always manuscripts to consider at least.\n\nNow this here Mrs or Miss Nicholls has arrived, so I will close & praps write another more personal little letter tomorrow – and hope that I may have a letters [sic] from you. IHale, Emilycorrespondence with TSE;w3and the prospect of TSE writing every night;c9 wonder if you would consider it an impertinence, when I get to Cambridge, if I wrote you a letter every night? But you are not to answer that question.\n\nJe t’embrasse respectueusement –"
