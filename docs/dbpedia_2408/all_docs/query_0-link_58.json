        "text": "In 1857 Dickens moved from Tavistock House, Bloomsbury, to his 'dream home', Gad's Hill Place, Higham, Kent, where he lived until his death on 9 June 1870. The library was inherited by his eldest son, Charles Jr. (known as Charley), who also purchased Gad's Hill at auction and lived there until 1879. Part of the library, including some post-1870 works that were added by Charley to his father's collection, was sold on Charley's instructions by Henry Sotheran Ltd, and catalogued in Sotheran's Price Current of Literature, volumes CLXXIV (30 November 1878) and CLXXV (31 December 1878). This was reprinted in a limited run of 275 copies by John Harrison Stonehouse in 1935, this publication forming the basis of this listing."
