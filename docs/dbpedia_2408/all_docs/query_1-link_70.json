        "text": "Dear WHS Members,\n\nWhat a year we are having! From the overwhelming success of our Tour of Homes to another amazing trip to Natchez, a fantastic Harvest Arts Concert to a wonderful May meeting with our Guest Speaker, Cart Blackwell, we continue to set new standards of excellence. Thank you for supporting the work of our Historical Society.\n\nFirst, our Tour of Homes was an incredible success thanks to the amazing homeowners who so graciously opened their homes. I want to thank them again for their hard work and for the investment they made to prepare for Tour. Our guests loved your homes and the entire town of Pine Apple. Thank you all!\n\nI also want to thank Sylvia and Tom Rushing for once again allowing us to host Friday’s Luncheon and the Welcome Reception with Lady Carnarvon at their beautiful home, Wakefield. It was the perfect setting for this remarkable event. Lady Carnarvon was very impressed with our organization and what we are achieving here in Wilcox County. She also loved Jackie Sharp’s Southern Cuisine. Thanks, Jackie, for creating a fabulous meal for her!\n\nThis year’s Tour raised $63,036.63 in profit! As a result of our success, we have allocated $16,000 to help restore the roof at Moore Academy and to restore the Water Tower Building as well. Both buildings are in the Pine Apple National Historic District.\n\nThe success of our last three tours has allowed us to help restore the Miller Law Office in Camden, the Furman General Store, and now these two buildings in Pine Apple. In fact, in less than three years we have raised over $250,000 through our tours, grant writing, and the generosity of many donors. As a result of our financial gains, we will start the restoration of the Female Institute this year.\n\nOur second Natchez Trip was another amazing experience. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the architecture, antiques, and food. The homeowners of Natchez really rolled out the red carpet for us. We will sponsor another Natchez Trip April 23 – 26, 2024. I encourage you to join us!\n\nThank all of you that attended the Harvest Arts Concert last month. As always, the music was incredible. We were the first stop on their Hymn Tour which included concerts in Pensacola and Birmingham. I want to thank the Camden ARP Church for hosting the concert. We will sponsor at least two more Harvest Arts Concerts; one this fall and one in the spring of 2024.\n\nWe have had a series of great Guest Speakers and that is going to continue this fall. We start Sunday, September 17th, at 2:00 pm, with the return of Sarah Duggan, Director of the Decorative Arts of the Gulf South Project in New Orleans. Sarah will present the findings of their work in both Demopolis and Greensboro. I hope you will all make plans to attend.\n\nAs you can see, we are making a big difference here in Wilcox County and beyond. We now have over 400 members from nineteen states.

The members decided to build a library to further intellectual culture. It took two years to raise the necessary $1,235 needed to erect this building in 1927. It was used as a library until 1995. The one-story frame end gabled building features wooded shingle clad walls. Recently restored the library will be used as a museum for Pine Apple.\n\nFour Oaks Bend – the Luckie-Williamson-Bennett House\n\nto new members: from Alabama –Dorothy Allain, Douglas Burtu Kearley Sr., and Jacquilyn Lynn Stewart of Mobile, Edward Allen Smith, Charles and Shea Terry and Beth and Mike Neighbors of Birmingham, Robyn and Clay Anderson, Robbie Dudley Klemm, and Terry Dudley Lott of Huntsville, Glynn and Joann Burleson of Thomasville, Valerie Pope Burnes of Livingston, Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Culpepper, and Linda and Ratliff McAdams, from Demopolis, Philip and Kimberly DeSimone of Trussville, Faye Estes, and Karen and Darrell Sparks of Monroeville, Madeline and Chase Felts of Minter, Grace and Joe Finklea of Vestavia Hills, Walter and Frances Givhan of Troy, Frank and Jeanie Lambert of Camden, Bill and Jennifer Mitchell of Bay Minette, Dr. and Mrs. Judson Moore of Dothan, and Jacqueline L.

Hayes of the Camden History Society in London, England. He was interested in compiling a list of Camden place names across the globe to mark the 400th anniversary of the death of Elizabethan scholar, William Camden. With contributions from local historians and others in three continents the results were a sixty-page document filled with Camden history!\n\nWe were pleased that Camden native and Alabama historian, Daniel Fate Brooks, agreed to submit the entry for our Camden, Wilcox County, Alabama to Mr. Hayes. Following is our contribution to Camdens Worldwide:\n\nCity in and county seat of Wilcox County; population 1,900 (est.), elevation 63 m / 206 ft\n\nBy Daniel Fate Brooks\n\nThumbing the pages of Alabama history, one soon learns that the Wilcox County seat of Camden is greatly enriched by the Alabama River and other natural resources. The town, located in a bend of the river, lies on the edge of a distinct prehistoric and geological sub-region which gives rise to the twelve-county fertile crescent known as the Alabama Black Belt. From the many examples of antebellum architecture in the area, this land of rich soil brings to mind mid-nineteenth-century wealth and greatness, and also a culture and civilization that continue to shape state and national politics, history, art, tradition, and lore.\n\nWilcox County, founded in 1819, and one day older than the state of Alabama, is the southernmost county within the Black Belt region. From its first year of existence the county attracted aristocratic settlers from Virginia, the Carolinas and beyond. These cultured immigrants brought with them enslaved labor and built a high level of gentility which rapidly transformed a frontier wilderness into settlements reminiscent of their previous home states.\n\nAlong the banks of the Alabama River, ports and towns sprung up under the names of Black’s Bluff, Lower Peach Tree, Prairie Bluff and Canton. Inhabitants revealed in their connection to Mobile, but from the onset, suffered from the perils of disease plaguing their communities. In 1830 Wilcox Countians, including the populace of Canton, the first county seat, joined the citizens from eastern villages in their cravings for a center of government that was not only more healthy but also more centrally located.\n\nBy the fall of 1832 Thomas Dunn and his wife, Martha Hobbs, had donated twelve acres of wooded land in the center of the county for a new seat of government. The spot, four miles from the river, was rich with springs, providing an ideal location for its designated purpose. In swift succession the community, first called Wilcox Courthouse, grew, and was soon established and renamed Barboursville. Influential Virginia immigrants selected the name to honor Philip Pendleton Barbour, Virginia native and tenth Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nThe little town quickly swelled, attracting more settlers from the south Atlantic seaboard. In time an unusually large influx of small farmers and a powerful and wealthy planter elite from South Carolina filtered in to create a small version of the Palmetto State. This mix of inhabitants, combined with slave labor, produced a prosperous though highly imperfect plantation society. Among these newcomers was Dr. John Daniel Caldwell, a cousin of John Caldwell Calhoun, the forceful South Carolina Senator and U.S. Vice President. In 1841, Dr. Caldwell, a physician and politician, proposed incorporation, and the idea of renaming the town for Camden, South Carolina. Caldwell’s suggestions were overwhelmingly approved by the citizens who admir\n\nCarolina. Caldwell’s suggestions were overwhelmingly approved by the citizens who admired his brilliant and passionate cousin.\n\nCamden, Alabama adopted a South Carolina form of government, with the chief magistrate of the town serving as Intendant instead of mayor. The title of Intendant, derived from the French, was used by the city of Charleston and other South Carolina towns where the office was assisted by wardens.\n\nA wide thoroughfare in Camden was named for Calhoun. Picket fences flowed in front of vernacular and classical styled homes spaced at intervals and surrounded by trees. Camdenians were proud to live in the new county seat, but they were equally proud of binding ties to the state of South Carolina.\n\nBesides the immigrants from the south Atlantic seaboard, others came as well: English, Scotch, Irish, German, French and a young saddler who migrated from the Italian Alps. Jewish merchants owned businesses alongside their Christian counterparts, and all contributed to the polyglot blend of cultures, giving Camden a remarkable and cosmopolitan identity.\n\nFrom the 1830s to the outbreak of the Civil War, hundreds of enslaved Africans were delivered by traders from the markets in Montgomery. In 1860 the Black population of Wilcox County numbered almost 18,000 to a White populace of less than 7,000. The census that year listed over 800 individuals as “mullatto” and recorded 26 as “free colored.”\n\nThe brick Greek Revival building housing the Institute remains one of the town’s most significant landmarks, along with two church buildings, the monumental Greek Revival Courthouse and Dale Lodge, home to one of Alabama’s oldest Masonic orders. These structures have witnessed not only the glory days of cotton but also Civil War, slave emancipation, radical Reconstruction and other difficult times and events.\n\nIn an era in which large cities and more complex metropolitan areas dominate, it speaks well that Camden, Alabama, a town with a population with fewer than 2,000 in 2022, can take pride in claiming a history of notable sons and daughters, both African American and White. The list is long, but it is important to recognize Hank Aaron, the great American baseball player; Kay Ivey, current Governor of Alabama; Emmett Kilpatrick, an interpreter at the Versailles Peace Conference and a prisoner of the Bolsheviks; and Jeff Sessions, the 84th U.S. Attorney General and U.S. Senator.\n\nToday people from all walks of life are drawn to the microcosm of Camden and Wilcox County, Alabama. Many come to hunt, fish, and enjoy the river. Others tour and view the historic architecture and marvel at a recent resurgence of business and renovation. Most visitors quickly develop a genuine respect for this small and intriguing Black Belt town.\n\nDANIEL FATE BROOKS, a Camden native and a seventh generation Wilcox Countian, is a former president of both the Wilcox Historical Society and the Alabama Historical Association. He is the author of published articles on William Rufus King, Black Belt history and an unpublished manuscript on antebellum Wilcox County. He curated a portion of the landmark exhibition, Made in Alabama: A State Legacy for the Birmingham Museum of Art and authored a chapter on a Wilcox County subject in the accompanying book.

Bellingrath Gardens and Home was the creation of Mr. and Mrs. Walter Bellingrath. The Gardens first opened to the public in 1932.\n\nTom McGehee has served as the Museum Director for Bellingrath Gardens and Home for more than 20 years. In his capacity as curator over the collections there, he has participated in numerous study courses dealing with decorative arts and garden estates in the United States, Great Britain, France, and Germany.\n\nTom spoke on Nature Within and Without at Bellingrath Gardens and Home – a look at the naturalistic themes found in both the Gardens and the Home. From the design of the Gardens and its historic cast iron elements to the ornate silver, porcelain, and furnishings within the Bellingrath Home, Tom showed us through outstanding photographs a consistent link to nature can be found and enjoyed at Bellingrath.\n\nPictured left with Tom McGehee (l to r) Ann Farrell Wright, Lance Britt, and Mary Ann Harrison.\n\nIt was interesting to hear from Tom a Bellingrath connection to Wilcox County! Mary Boykin was born in the Tilden community near the Wilcox County / Dallas County line. She later moved with her family to Brewton after the death of her father. In 1890 she married Edwin C. Bellingrath who was the older brother of Walter. Sadly, Edwin passed away in 1896 at the age of 43 and Mary moved back to Camden and lived with her aunt and sister until her death in 1936. Mary Boykin Bellingrath is buried in the historic Camden Cemetery.\n\nThe meeting was held at the Wilcox Female Institute with a reception afterwards.\n\nWHS Trip to Bellingrath Gardens\n\nHYMN TOUR CONCERT IN CAMDEN\n\nThe Camden Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church was the venue for the Harvest Arts Hymn Tour on Sunday, April 30th. A large crowd enjoyed the concert sponsored by the WHS.\n\nThe concert featured exciting arrangements of beloved hymns fused with classical music. Hymns included “Amazing Grace,” “O the Deep, Deep Love of Jesus”, and “What Wondrous Love is This”, married with masterpieces by Dvorak, Mozart, and more…and even some Irish Jig.\n\nFeatured artists are nationally and internationally recognized musicians:\n\nMadeline Cawley, FLUTE – Harvest Arts, LLC Creative & Artistic Director\n\nHannah Cope Johnson, HARP – Sarasota Orchestra\n\nPaul Halberstadt, VIOLIN – Alabama Symphony\n\nLauren Peacock, CELLO – Alabama Symphony\n\nEthan Blake, CELLO – Alabama Symphony\n\nA reception at the Wilcox Female Institute followed the concert.\n\nDOWN HOME IN THE DEEP SOUTH:\n\nTHE ARCHITECTURE OF WILCOX COUNTY\n\nWilcox County has long been recognized for its unique architecture and culture. Our May meeting held on Sunday the 7th featured a most interesting presentation by Cartledge “Cart” Weeden Blackwell, III.\n\nA native of Selma, Alabama, Cart is an architectural historian and the curator of the Mobile Carnival Museum. He obtained undergraduate degrees in art history and historic preservation from the College of Charleston and his MA in Architectural History from the University’s School of Architecture. His scholarly focus is on the art and architecture of 19th century and 20th century America, particularly that of the Southeast.\n\nShowing hundreds of new and old photographs from homes and buildings across the county, Cart examined architectural styles, building types, construction methods, building processes, local figures (clients, builders, artisans, etc.) and much more.\n\nA crowd of nearly 70 members and guests enjoyed the afternoon celebrating the historical and continued importance of architecture in Wilcox County.\n\nThe meeting and reception were held at the Wilcox Female Institute – a most fitting locale for this subject!\n\nHerbert John Furman April 4, 1933-May 5, 2023 Civil Engineer, Land Surveyor, builder, private pilot and sailor, Herb Furman was a man of many vocations and avocations. Born in Maine, raised in Kentucky, Herb was one of those people who came from somewhere else and made Wilcox County a much richer place for his presence. An engineering graduate of Auburn University, where he met his wife, Marian, Herb was civic minded and active in the community. He leaves Marian and his many children and grandchildren as evidence of his enduring contributions.\n\nMaud Kirk Garrick, July 11, 1932- November 16, 2022 A Wilcox County native, Maud was born in Lower Peach Tree, AL. She was the daughter of Clarence Eugene “Uncle Bud” and Mattie Estelle Davis Garrick. She was the youngest of their six children. She was a lifelong member of the Methodist Church starting at the Lower Peach Tree Methodist Church. After high school graduation, Miss Garrick moved to Montgomery where she worked for several city and state government agencies. Her love of history led her to back to her roots. One of her greatest legacies is the Lower Peach Tree Homecoming, an annual event she began in 1980 and was active for 40 years. It was amazing the number of people from all parts of the country who had connections to Lower Peach Tree and wanted to visit it to reconnect. She is survived by a host of nieces and nephews.\n\nAnn Morris Rutherford Lambert April 20, 1947-April 24, 2023 Ann Morris grew up in the Monroe County community of Franklin and was a resident of Camden for 50 years. Two of her gifts that she loved to share with family, friends, and her community were cooking and flower arranging. Ann Morris volunteered in many capacities over the years, including serving as president of the Wilcox Historical Society and co-chairman of its Tours of Homes. She is survived by her son, Leslie Lambert, daughter in law, Amanda, and grandchildren Miller and Emily.\n\nLathrop Winchester Smith, Jr. April 4, 1942 -October 27, 2022 A native of Birmingham, Lathrop began and ended his career at Industrial Supplies, Inc. (ISI), a regional distributor of bearings and power transmission equipment. Under his leadership as President from 1971 to 2003, the team at ISI grew the business significantly and opened branches in Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi. In 1987, Lathrop served as President of the International Bearing Specialists Association. As a lifelong member of Independent Presbyterian Church, he served as a Deacon, an Elder and a Trustee for the IPC Foundation. Lathrop was a member of numerous civic clubs and organizations in Birmingham, where he also served on their boards. He was a longtime life member of the Wilcox Historical Society, where he and his wife, Garland were very active. Most recently Lathrop was instrumental in starting the Raise the Bell campaign for the expansion and remodeling of the Wilcox Female Institute. He is survived by this wife of 52 years, Garland Cook Smith; his son Lathrop Winchester Smith III (Brannon); his daughter Lindsay Smith Puckett (Jason); his granddaughter Dorothy Ann Smith, his grandson Lathrop Winchester Smith IV. Lathrop was a man who will be remembered for his love for people and the ability to make them laugh.\n\nGive the Gift of Membership\n\nGift memberships are now available!

It was like a scandal in the family where a foreigner had played the leading role.\n\nOn February 17, 1937, Princess Elizabeth with her family moved into Buckingham Palace. Her relationship with her younger sister Princess Margaret Rose was also altered by the events of 1936, for until then, they had been equal despite the 4-year gap in their age. Margaret was a bright, vivacious little girl and the relationship between the sisters has always been close. Had it not been, it could not have survived the strains placed upon it in adult years.\n\nMay 12th, 1937 was the date for the crowning of the new king and Britain became gripped with monarchial fervor.\n\nThrough March and April Miss Crawford’s theme for the little princesses’ lessons revolved around King George’s coronation and Queen Mary explained the roles, symbolisms, and rituals, thoroughly to her granddaughters. In preparation, Princess Elizabeth was brought out to stand by her parents at some of their public engagements.\n\nThe princesses’ robes for the coronation were their first long dresses. Margaret rode to the Abbey with Queen Mary, who for once in her life was breaking with tradition for over the centuries it had been a royal superstition for the widow of a king to attend the coronation for his successor, but Queen Mary saw good reason after the events of the previous December to demonstrate royal solidarity in defiance of ill omens.\n\nPrincess Elizabeth, heir presumptive but not heir apparent for that is given to first sons of British Sovereigns and a baby brother was what the little princess was praying for but King George VI and Queen Elizabeth were perfectly satisfied with the size of their little family. Elizabeth idolized her father both as a dutiful daughter and as his heir.\n\nIn July of 1930, she with her father, mother and sister went on a cruise along the South Coast and dropped anchor off Dartmouth Royal Naval College where King George VI had concluded his education. Though only 13, Princess Elizabeth first met Prince Phillip, the young man she was later to marry. He was just 18 and although called Phillip, Prince of Greece, did not have a drop of Greek blood in his veins. He was in essence a Dane, which his ash blond hair and angular features signified. As Miss Crawford noted, Elizabeth was attracted to him from the very first.\n\nOn September 1938, Britain declared war on Germany. King George had to decide what to do with his daughters. One option was to evacuate them to Canada as so many were doing but as Queen Elizabeth said, the children would not leave without her, she would not leave without the King and the King would never leave. Windsor seemed the safest place and after Dunkirk and the fall of France, they moved into Windsor Castle where Elizabeth spent the remainder of her childhood and today, she still considers it home.\n\nOn May 8, 1945, London celebrated the unconditional surrender of Germany. Sir Winston Churchill declared that King George and his family had more closely identified themselves with their people in war than any of their predecessors for each had taken part in sacrifices for the war effort but the cost of the continuous strain upon the King’s health had been high.\n\nIn the summer of 1946, Elizabeth let her feelings for Prince Philip become known to her family but being discrete, she did not broadcast it to the world. On July 10th 1947, the King and Queen announced the engagement of their daughter, Princess Elizabeth to Lt. Philips Mountbatten, R. N. from Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe people, starved for joy, celebrated with her as graciously as they knew how. The House of Commons voted 50,000 pounds for Clarence House to be decorated and in addition to 10,000 pounds for her young husband and 50,000 for his bride. On November 20, 1947 they were married in Westminster Abbey amid one of the largest gatherings of Royalty of the century. More than 200,000,000 people heard by radio the service preformed by the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nOn November 14, 1948 the nation was thrilled to learn that the princess had given birth to a son christened Prince Charles Philip Arthur George of Edinburgh and in 1950 a princess was born christened Ann Elizabeth Alice Louise.\n\nThe King’s illness in 1949 imposed a heavier burden of duty on Princesses Elizabeth, and her children were often in the care of Queen Mary.\n\nIn January 1952, King George VI was too ill to undertake the tour to Australia and New Zealand and Elizabeth and Philip went instead. It was in Kenya on February 6, 1952 that she received the news of her father’s death and that his mantle had fallen on the shoulders of his daughter who returned to England as Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nKling George VI was laid to rest at Windsor and Britain prepared for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Queen Mary, the much beloved grandmother died in 1953, shortly before the coronation, which took place in Westminster Abbey on June 2, 1953. In 1960 a second prince was born to the Queen and Prince Philip and christened Andrew Albert and a third son, Prince Edward Richard Lewis was born in 1964.\n\nThe mid-60s were busy years for the Queen and Prince Philip. In 1967 a plaque was unveiled in the mall in memory of Queen Mary and for the occasion the Duke and Duchess of Windsor came to London for the first time as man and wife. In 1969 Prince Charles’ investiture as 21st Prince of Wales took place at a magnificent ceremony at Caernarvon Castle. (I was there soon after and many of the trappings still in place.)\n\nAlmost the last decision that Winston Churchill took in June of 1953 before his stroke was an intimate and delicate matter concerning Elizabeth II’s family. It pertained to the Queen’s sister, Princess Margaret, who had fallen in love with Group Capt. Peter Townsend and which created a touching problem for the Queen. Not only did he not possess the qualifications of birth expected of princesses but was that he was 16 years her senior, but he was also divorced. The conflict was doubly agonizing for she not only sought the happiness of her sister, she was very fond of Peter Townsend whom she had known for more than 10 years and who had served her father as an Equerry and Comptroller at Buckingham Palace. She loved her sister and wanted her happiness but there were matters of protocol which she could not ignore.\n\nUnder the Royal Marriage Act of 1772, members of the family in line of succession to the throne had to have the sovereign’s consent if they wished to marry before the age of 25. Since this act was a statue, Elizabeth was bound to act upon the advice of the Prime Minister. It was decided to send Peter Townsend to Brussels as an air attaché for two years. It was not love that the Queen wished to discourage, only scandal and in two years’ time it would prove how strong that love remained. On August 22, 1955, Margaret reached her 25th birthday and in theory she was free to marry Peter Townsend but in order to do so, she would have to renounce her right to her succession and waive all claims to her official income.\n\nThe Queen had chosen not to obstruct her sister and to let her make up her own mind. Margaret and Peter Townsend met on Wednesday, October 26, 1955 and both decided they had trespassed long enough on Elizabeth’s willingness to let them make up their own minds and causing her so much anguish and because of that, they should not marry. On October 31, 1955, she released this statement publicly, “I would like it to be known that I have decided not to marry Group Capt. Peter Townsend. I have been aware that, subject to my renouncing my right of succession, it might have been possible for me to contract a civil marriage. But mindful of the church’s teaching that Christians’ marriage is indissolvable and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have resolved to put these considerations before others. I have reached this decision entirely alone, and in so doing I have been strengthened by the unfailing support and devotion of Group Capt. Townsend. I am deeply grateful for the concern of all those who have constantly prayed for my happiness,” signed Margaret.\n\nAs you know she later married Mr. Armstrong Jones on May 6, 1960 which proved a stormy marriage and they were separated on March 19, 1976. I tell of Elizabeth’s visit to Duke in France and the Duke of Windsor died of cancer in May 1972 and buried in the royal burial place of Frogmore. Space was reserved for Wallis who would lie in royal ground at last.\n\nIt has often been said that the Queen and Prince Philip are the best ambassadors that Britain has every had. They are each other’s closest colleagues and their offices are side by side at Buckingham Palace. His contribution to the life and work of Elizabeth II is estimable. As she said on the night of November 1972 after celebrating their silver wedding anniversary, “that every one would concede that she should begin her speech with my husband and I.”\n\nThis year, 1977 is the Queen’s Jubilee Year. More than half a century after her grandfather set his style of dutiful representative monarchy, the same style reigns under the protection of Elizabeth II and her family, she is not ashamed – in fact – is proud to be the figure head of a welfare state and populist Democracy whose ethics opposed to the monarchical traditions of her forbears. She is a magical focus for affection, pride, and loyalty which the majority of people are very happy to accept. And if they ever become unhappy with her or the system that she represents then she would have no doubts to where her duty lay. And if Britain were one day to decide it no longer needed the monarchy, her response would be the logical continuation of her entire life, to country, indeed would be her ultimate service.\n\nEARLY RIVER DAYS IN WILCOX COUNTY (Part 2)\n\nBesides the pleasure angle, there were other sources of intense rivalry between boats – their pilots, crews, and even the passengers. The boats indulged in cut-rate fares and freight rates, which competition let to bitterness, brawls, and bodily injuries – in one case recorded by Judge Fleetwood Foster in the Wilcox Banner – to attempted murder. It happened this way: Having slashed fares from Mobile to Montgomery to a meager $2.50, tow rival captains, Bob Otis, then captain of the St. Charles, and James Green, captain of the F. P. Kimball, left Mobile in a high dudgeon. Near Claiborne, the St. Charles, which was the faster boat, in the act of passing the Kimball, bore down on it, causing it to swing heavily to shore. Captain Otis, later claiming protection of his boat and crew, drew his gun and fired point blank at the pilot of the Kimball was who badly though not mortally wounded.\n\nThe rivalry among boats for transporting cargo and passengers, however, could not compare with their rivalry for speed. The number of boilers, the size and draught of the vessel, the stroke of the engines, its load and number of stops, all determined the time to complete a trip, but slicing off a few hours from Mobile to Montgomery, a river distance of 415 miles, was a source of great boasting – a feat eliciting minute comparisons and a variety of explanations, both factual and fanciful. The James Battle was one of the fastest boats on the Alabama, and a record run from Bridgeport Landing to Montgomery, a distance of 175 miles upstream, in fourteen hours averaged twelve and a half miles per hour – a record almost equal to that of the matchless Robert E. Lee in its race against the Natchez when it averaged fourteen miles. The trip by river from Montgomery to Mobile with stops, upstream, took two full days or more at the best. One of these Packets named “The Wilcox” (for our county) was a favorite for local use – she as a fast boat, and like many of these boats, she was cut down, armed, and used as a blockade runner during the War Between the States.\n\nBut the boat races, held for no other purpose than to determine the one of greater speed, were usually held non-stop between the mouth of the Mobile River and the confluence of the Alabama and Tombigbee about fifty-miles upstream. Mobs crowded the wharf at Mobile as the passenger-crammed vessels set out – smaller vessels followed in their wake to learn the outcome to return the following day to give an account of the race. Among the jubilant crew and loyal passengers, as well as the proud owners and builders of the vessel, there were many who returned home richer or poorer by a bag of gold, a plantation, or a race horse or two.\n\nBut the river had its hazards. From the many catastrophes that befell the old packets and their freight as well as passengers, steam boating was anything but a tranquil pursuit. Waters of the Alabama River running through Wilcox County still entomb the remains of many of these old vessels and their human victims. There was the Senator No. 2 which blew up and sank at Young’s Landing; and the C. W. Dorrance, running in a fog, hit the wreckage and sank on top of it. (Incidentally, the pilot of the Dorrance was Capt. Billie McCurdy, Mrs. Laura Lee Moore’s grandfather.) There was the Joab Lawrence which sank at Yellow Jacket Bluff, the Commadore Farrand at Packer’s Bend, the Jewess at Prairie Bluff, and the Orleans St. John at Hurricane Bluff. An unidentified sunken craft lies upstream from the Orleans St. John which is thought to have been a slave ship, and it is believed that the wreck may contain skeletons of slaves still shackled in its hold. In these collisions and explosions many a man lost his life’s investment and many a gambler lost his gold; but what was more tragic, many officers, crewmen and passengers lost their lives to scalds, burns, drownings, and exposure.\n\nBut it was neither the sober traveler nor the flamboyant gambler who kept the old paddle-wheelers chugging up and down the river; it was King Cotton and him alone. The James. T. Staples, later named the Peerless and again the Helen Burke, once moved five thousand bales of cotton on its decks and on barges lashed alongside and in town, from Selma to Mobile. The owners of river landings provided warehouse with stalls – rented to inland merchants and landowners – where their merchandise, brought up by boats relieved of their cotton cargo, might be stored until wagons could haul it out to their respective stores or commissaries.\n\nA windlass, usually fashioned from a massive tree trunk, mounted upright to turn on a stationary core and operated – rather like a cane mill – by a mule hitched to a beam inserted in the tree trunk. Wound up the cable which in turn hauled up, over steel rails, a triangular fashioned carriage on rollers, loaded with luggage and freight. The cotton meanwhile was rolled down a ramp or cleared place on the river bank and caught and stacked by singing, sweating, swearing deck hands below. The passengers walked to and from the boat via a flight of steps extending from bank to water’s edge – possible a record for such a flight being recorded in the neighboring county of Monroe at Claiborne of three hundred and sixty-five steps! The bustle and noise of a boat’s arrival, its unloading and reloading, were as gay and joyous as its departure was serene and sad.\n\nHomes of river-landing proprietors became, of necessity, hotels of sorts where passengers, who were waiting for boats which might be hours late, could “put-up” and where arrivals who were unmet or could not get out because of impassable roads or inclement weather might wait for rescue.\n\nAt times these landing owners were bothered to distraction by the impatience of waiting passengers. One such, at old Bridgeport Landing, Mr. Wirt Moore – who never allowed a male, either doddering old or shirt-tail young, to sit at his dining table without a coat – was once beset by a youth as to when his boat would arrive. Not being a diviner of anything so unpredictable as a steamboat’s time-table, Mr. Moore advised patience and again patience. Finally, a boat whistled around the bend, and the young traveler, still not satisfied, rushed to inquire of Mr. Moore how long it would take the boat to arrive after its whistle was heard around the bend.\n\nMr. Moore eyed him in exasperation. “Son,” he said, “I wouldn’t rightly know. One whistled around that bend twenty-five years ago, and it ain’t got here yet.”\n\n(To be continued in the WHS Summer newsletter.)\n\n(Thanks to Mickey Mathews, Melanie Dees Andress and homeowners for photos)\n\nRecollections of the Stave Mill\n\nBy Harold “Hal” Watts Grimes Jr. of Pine Apple, Alabama\n\nDallas Cooperage Company came to the Pine Apple area just after World War II, about 1946 or 47. The first mill in our area was located across County Road 7 from the Godwin place. It had a number of houses where the workers lived. The mill was powered by a steam engine. Water for the boiler was pumped from Turkey Creek about one half mile.\n\nThe staves were made from pine logs that were sawed into blocks the length of the staves. They were then cut with special saws to give them the curved shape. These staves were then dried and tied into bundles for shipment. They were shipped by rail on the L&N Railroad from the Pine Apple Depot to another location where they were fitted with the ends or heads and made into small barrel shaped containers known as kegs. These containers were used to ship nails, horseshoes, chain etc., to hardware and farm supply stores.\n\nOther locations of mills in our area were at Mount Moriah, one between Awin and Pine Flat, and the last one near Ruthven. Much of the machinery is still in the abandoned Ruthven facility. The manufacturing process was very labor intensive and dangerous for the workers operating the saws. The Ruthven mill was converted from steam power to electricity. It had a dry kiln and packaging shed.\n\nRUTHVEN\n\nThe Wilcox Progressive Era described this town in April 1922: “Ruthven is a railroad and saw mill station on the L. & N. R. R. in Fox Mill Beat, and is located between Pine Apple and Schuster Springs stations. The name of the mill is Schuster Springs Lumber Company. This company is owned by W. P. Smith Lumber Company of Chapman, Ala. and has a 14 mile rail timber road. The daily capacity of this mill is 65,000 feet of lumber. About 300 men are employed in the mill and in the woods.\n\nThe company has a store, or commissary, and also a hotel operated by Mrs. Bearsfield. The post office is Ruthven and Mr. D. C. Snowden is post master. The view from the rudimental portion of the town is very pretty and industrially inspiring.”\n\nAccording to Place Names in Alabama by Virginia O. Foscue, “A resident who came from Lincolnshire, England, wanted to name the settlement Lincoln, but after his neighbors objected, he called it, instead Ruthven for a division in the English County. (Editor’s note – Ruthven is a parish in the county of Forfor, Scotland, situated on the north side of Strathmore, near the base of the Grampian hills.)\n\nRuthven, Wilcox County, Alabama was incorporated in 1924. It was located about 3 ½ miles southwest of Pine Apple on Bear Creek along the Selma to Flomaton branch of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad (now County Road 2.) In 1930, it had over 500 residents making it the second largest town in Wilcox County after the county seat of Camden.\n\nIn May 1952 officials of the W.M. McGowin Lumber Company announced their plans to discontinue operations at the Ruthven Mill. At that time the mill employed about 150. McGowin Lumber was the largest industrial plant in Wilcox County in 1952. The plant’s capacity was 35,000 feet of lumber a day. McGowin Lumber shipped lumber over the Eastern part of the United States as well as worldwide.\n\nVery little exists of the town today as most of its buildings were dismantled.\n\nUPDATE Broken Arrow, Sunny South, Alabama\n\nFrom Erskine “Don” Donald\n\nThis historic home is located 4 miles south of the community of Sunny South in western Wilcox County. The property fronts on the west side of Wilcox County Road 1 and lies south of State Highway 5. According to historical records, the home was built circa 1830 by the Vaughn family, one of the earliest families to settle Wilcox County. It is a simple one-story cottage constructed of heart pine throughout with a basement beneath. The exterior has never been painted. The home and grounds were occupied by Mrs. Pearlie Smith and family under a 1966 life estate agreement from the Fred Vaughn Trust until May 24, 2017 when the home and appurtenances on 7.79 surveyed acres were donated to the Wilcox Historical Society. WHS continued the life estate agreement with Mrs. Smith until her death on December 25, 2021.\n\nPearlie Smith had contacted members of WHS in May 2016 concerning the perpetual preservation of this historic home and appurtenances known as Broken Arrow. WHS spearheaded this project, and through the efforts of Bill Godbold and Donald McLeod, Trustees for the Vaughn Trust and Frank Cascio of Weyerhaeuser which has the timber lease on the Vaughn Trust property, the Society was able to secure this property. The deed to Wilcox Historical Society provided that the property can be sold after the expiration of Mrs. Smith’s life estate but stipulated that the home and all appurtenances must remain on the property, thus assuring that this historic property will be preserved.\n\nThe property was put on the market for sale in December 2022 and a contract with Linda Baird and Woody Goode was signed in late January 2023 for a total price of $66,000. The sale was closed in March 2023 and Linda and Woody began restoration of this home.\n\nThe John Purifoy Family: An Early Family to Alabama,\n\nA Founding Family of Furman and Wilcox County and Their Duty for the Confederacy\n\nBy Kimberley Purifoy Stout, Little Rock, Arkansas\n\nJohn Purifoy (my third great grandfather) was born 21 September 1787 in Craven County North Carolina. His parents were Nicholas Purifoy Jr. and Mary (Gatlin) Purifoy of Craven County North Carolina. [1] After the death of both parents and around 1800, John moved to Hancock County Georgia with his older brothers William Dixon Purifoy and Arrington Purifoy. [2]\n\nOn 21 December 1809, in Hancock County Georgia, John married Nancy Williams. [3] Nancy (my third great grandmother) was born 23 March 1792 in Hancock County Georgia. Her parents were William Williams and Evelin Mullins Williams. A few years after marriage, John Purifoy took his constitutional oath on 20 May 1814 in Sparta Georgia. He was Ensign John Purifoy of the 14th Regiment of the Militia of Georgia [4] and a farmer. John and his family moved to the Barbour County Alabama area prior to 1820 [5], making him an early settler to Alabama. Dr. W. B. Palmer writes that John Purifoy about 1820, settled across Rutherford Creek about two miles north going from Old Snow Hill. [6] At that time, many settlers moved from Georgia to Alabama in search of fertile farming land and for trade with the local Indians.\n\nAround 1826, the settlers decided to build a road from Eufaula to Clayton, Alabama to enhance the Indian trade. John Purifoy was the overseer of around three hundred men for the working force. Interesting is that as the men reached Barbour Creek, they were startled by yelps and yells from a group of Indians that were in the woods. The Indian interpreter stated that the Indians did not approve of the road and that the workers need to show an order from “The Great Father in Washington.” [7] The road workers were unable to show any documentation so; they packed up their tools and equipment and retreated to their homes.\n\nLater, an officer from nearby Fort Mitchell met with the Indians and convinced them that the road would bring in more produce, goods, and supplies into the area. The Indians agreed and the roadwork started again with some the Indians taking part in the construction. The ford at Barbour Creek and the road to Clayton were completed and more productive trading relations were established. [8]\n\nThe U.S. Census of 1830 lists John Purifoy as living in Pike County Alabama. [9] On 1 August 1831, he purchased land in Cahaba Dallas County Alabama and moved his family there. [10] He then purchased additional land in Cahaba Dallas County on 19 September of 1835. [11] John Purifoy died on 25 August of 1839 while visiting in Shelby Springs, Alabama. He is buried in the Old Shelby Cemetery in Shelby County Alabama. U.S. Census records reveal that John Purifoy’s occupation in Alabama was farming. Nancy Purifoy is listed in the U.S. Census of 1840 as living in District 574, Alabama (Early GA) [12], the U.S. Census of 1850 as living in Dallas County Alabama [13] and she is listed in the U.S. Census of 1860 as living in the Eastern Division of Wilcox County Alabama. [14] The U.S. Census of 1870 lists Nancy as living with her widowed daughter, Patience Caroline Purifoy Lee in Snow Hill, Wilcox County Alabama. [15] Nancy Purifoy died on 9 May of 1875 in Snow Hill. She is buried in the historic Old Snow Hill Cemetery in Wilcox County Alabama.\n\nThe Furman National Historic District historical marker was installed in April of 2010 at the west side of County Road 59. This historical marker reads that the earliest settlers to Furman came from the Carolinas and that family groups include, among others, the Carters, Gulleys, Lees and Purifoys. [16] Furman historic landmarks associated with the Purifoy families include the Patience Caroline Purifoy-Lee House (also known as Patience Plantation), the Purifoy-Lipscomb house, and the Purifoy-Melton-Norred house that was built in Furman but was later dismantled, moved to Pine Apple Alabama, and rebuilt. [17]\n\nThe Purifoys were also founding families of the historic landmark Bethsaida Baptist church [18]. It might be of interest to know a bit of Baptist history about John Purifoy’s grandfather, Nicholas Purifoy Sr. (1679 VA – 1773 NC). Nicholas Purifoy, along with other men from Craven County petitioned the court of New Bern, North Carolina in June of 1740, to build a Baptist house of worship [19]. Remember that in 1740, the Church of England (Anglican) was the established church and everyone paid a tax for the upkeep of Anglican churches. Some of the petitioners including Nicholas Purifoy were placed in the Craven County jail for a couple of months. In September of 1740, Nicholas Purifoy along with the other men petitioned the court again to hold Baptist church services. This time, the justices of the Craven County Court agreed to the petition and these Baptists were then able to have the freedom to worship their Baptist beliefs [20].\n\nThe Purifoy families were proud of their family members who fought with bravery and great sacrifice during the Civil War. After the election of President Abraham Lincoln in 1860, Alabama delegates voted to secede from the United States. Alabama provided a significant source of soldiers to the war and there were many young male Purifoy family members who joined in the war effort. It appears that military service was part of their familial duty and perhaps failure to do their part would bring shame to themselves and their families.\n\nJohn and Nancy had ten children in number. There were eight children reared by John and Nancy and two children that died at young ages. The attached chart lists the Purifoy children and their connections to Furman and Wilcox County. Also included is information of members of the family who were Confederate Soldiers. [21]\n\nNotes [1] Rose, F.

Here are a few inquiries and comments received since our last newsletter:\n\nThank you for the good work you do to preserve the history of Wilcox County! I am in Connecticut but have been looking at your work online. I am doing some research on ancestors in my family tree who lived in Wilcox County in the 1800’s. I would like to get in touch with anyone who is descended from Mark Harwell Pettway and Marina Caroline Williams Pettway (Gees Bend), so that we might share information about the family history.\n\nThe Pettways migrated to Gees Bend around 1847, and owned the Pettway Plantation. The plantation came into possession of their only surviving son, John Henry, Jr. His children sold the land and moved to Tennessee in the 1890’s, however some of his sisters seem to have married locally and stayed behind.\n\nElizabeth W. married William Irby. Two other sisters married men named Jones. Harriet Emma married Charles O. Jones. Lucy B. married Joseph S. Jones. (I am not sure whether these Jones men were local to Alabama, or from North Carolina, where the Pettways had lived before migrating to Alabama.) Martha H. seems to have married a man named Clark, and had two children named Hellen Clark and William M. Clark. Another granddaughter was Willie C. Jones, but I am not sure of her parentage.\n\nMy source for the above descendants is Mark Harwell Pettway’s will.\n\nThank you very much for your assistance and best wishes for your Spring activities,\n\nFrances V. Moulder, Torrington, CT\n\nI am trying to locate any pictures the Society may have of river Steamboats. Some may have been donated by relatives of Robert Boyd Brown, a riverboat captain who died in 1927. His daughter Gladys Marie “Browie” Brown Williams who died in 1988. Her affairs may have been handled by John and Maggie Manard, and LaVoyd Bradford the burial in Choctaw Corner in Clarke County. Any information, assistance is appreciated. Thank You, Bert Outlaw, Pace, FL\n\nHi. I’ve been doing a lot of ancestry research and discovered that many of my ancestors lived in Wilcox County in the 1800s. I am not sure if you are able to help, but I was particularly interested in a story I heard about my Irish immigrant ancestors (McClurkins) who started a sawmill there. Would you have access to this kind of information or know who I am to contact?\n\nAlso, could you tell me anything about the Staples family? Mary’s daughter, Martha Matilda McClurkin married Robert Asbury Staples, so I would love to learn anything about that side too. Miranda Oswald, Greenville, AL\n\nEditor’s Note – In reviewing The Heritage of Wilcox County there was an entry for the McClurklin family. It started with Mary Margaret Kirkpatrick McClurklin (1802-1892) who immigrated from Ireland in 1848 or 49. This information was shared with Miranda.\n\nI am an archaeologist working for the University of Alabama. I am working on a survey between Catherine and Orrville. I am looking for information on the Prairie Mission. Would you be able to point me in the direction of someone who might be able to provide information on the Mission beyond what is easily accessible on the internet? Jeremiah Stager\n\nEditor’s Note – WHS Member Carla Martin offered to speak with Jeremiah about Prairie Mission and suggested a book sold at Black Belt Treasures about it also.\n\nHello. Do you have any information on the Four Quarter Lumber Company that was in Pine Hill, Alabama (Wilcox County) about 1940?\n\nI found information that my grandfather Stillman Mullenix (first name was William) was a foreman there in 1940. I am not sure how long he worked there. He was born in 1912 and died in 1985. On the 1940 census, he is in Pine Hill, working there at the lumber company, and living with his first wife Eula Mae. They are living with a man named E.P. Lareman, his wife and young daughter. Mr. Lareman gives his occupation as tractor driver at the lumber company. Later, my grandfather moved back to Tuscaloosa County, AL. Attached is a photo of my grandfather sitting on a log. I do not know if this was taken in Pine Hill or when.\n\nThank you for any information on the lumber company or any records you may have on my grandfather.\n\nKristina Mullenix, Tuscaloosa, AL\n\nI have been meaning to write and tell you what a wonderful job you and your committee did on the Pine Apple Home Tour! All the homes were excellent and so well appointed. We liked the variety and thought the signs out front of so many homes were a brilliant idea to show the community off in the best way.\n\nThe home owners were so gracious and welcoming and we never felt crowded or rushed along. My daughter is from Mobile and I am from Fairhope and we will return to the Wilcox County area and certainly to Brittany Antiques that was amazing as well. Savan Wilson and Christy Gustin\n\nA perfect day and beautiful homes. It was amazing. Thank you! Dayna Smith Blankenship\n\nRegarding the Gullet family line. I live in Greensboro, NC. Mount Pleasant United Methodist Church Cemetery in Greensboro, Guilford County, is where George Gullett (1744-1796) is buried and is the male progenitor of the eventual Gullett line in Alabama. My great, great, grandmother, Mary Gullett Cook, is the descendant of George Gullett and married Samuel Calvin Cook, son of Daniel and Martha Cook of Cook Hill. I live 15 minutes from where George Gullet is buried…talk about going in a circle! Thank you for a wonderful website and social media postings. You are doing a great job! Sam Chip Cook\n\nWHS DATES TO MARK ON YOUR CALENDAR\n\nSunday, September 17 – 2pm – Architecture and Antiques of Greensboro, Alabama with speaker Sarah Duggan, Director of the Decorative Arts of the Gulf South Project\n\nOctober TBD – WHS Trip to Demopolis – Tour Gaineswood, Bluff Hall, Lyon Hall\n\nSaturday, December 2, 3-5pm -WHS Christmas Open House, Furman\n\nSunday, December 17, 6:30pm – Christmas in Furman, Bethsaida Baptist Church\n\nMarch 22–23, 2024, WHS Tour of Homes, Camden and Oak Hill\n\nApril 23 -26, 2024 -Trip to Natchez, Mississippi\n\nA LOOK BACK…\n\n26 February 1914\n\nWilcox Progressive Era, Camden\n\nMILLERS FERRY\n\nOn Monday afternoon a party of five, consisting of Mrs. Minnie Bellingraft, Misses Kate and Virginia Matheson, Alma Dunnam, and Hon. S.D. Bloch, visited the Millers Ferry colored school. Mr. Bloch having been invited many times by Rev. C.H. Johnson, its president.\n\nThe history of this industrial school dates from 1884. The first school consisted of twelve students and was taught in an old log church. From that small beginning the school has steadily grown in size and efficiently, and as a result of its influence, five similar schools have been established.\n\nThe buildings consist of one main buildings, four dormitories, two for boys and two for girls, a laundry, carpentry shop, hospital, a sewing department and the teachers homes. The industries consist of plain sewing, dress making, domestic science, laundrying, printing, carpentry, blacksmithing, mattress making and nurse training.\n\nThe school is beautifully located 2 miles from the Alabama river. The school grounds and buildings are well kept by the students. We were shown through each department by the president and his wife, and all were astonished at finding everything in such a sanitary condition and the work so systematically carried on. Rev. Johnson and wife have been in charge of the school for 22 years, and by their systematic training and efficient work, in teaching negro youth to labor and to serve. They are doing a good work this is beneficial to the colored pupils and for the community, for they are taught to work.\n\n21 December 1944\n\nWilcox Progressive Era, Camden\n\nOAK HILL 4-H CLUB\n\nThe Oak Hill 4-H Club was organized in October.\n\nOfficers were elected as follows:\n\nPresident – Ernestine Jones\n\nVice-President – Faye McGraw\n\nSecretary – Janie Jones Bonner\n\nSong Leader – Virginia Dell Lamkin\n\nReporter – Rosetta Girlie\n\nThe topic studied in the November meeting was “The Foods We Should Eat.”\n\nOur last meeting in 1944 was December 12th.\n\nRosetta Girlie, Reporter.\n\n2 December 1948\n\nWilcox Progressive Era, Camden\n\nPROGRESS MADE ON WILCOX SCHOOL BUILDINGS\n\nSteel to be used in the construction of the Camden school gymnasium has been delivered to the site, Supt. W.J. Jones revealed this week. Construction on the gym will begin after removal of the present city water tank which occupies the projected site of the new building. Since the town officials plan the erection of a new tank at a different location as soon as practicable, Mr. Jones said it is hoped that construction on this new building can be done in the near future.\n\nSupt. Jones also stated that progress is being made on the Pine Hill auditorium-cafeteria building being constructed by Ford Building and Supply Company of Selma. Bad weather had interfered with this work but the excavating has been done and some concrete foundation has been poured.\n\nThe gym at Pine Apple is nearing completion and it is hoped that it will be finished about the first of January.\n\nThe colored school building at Coy is also due to be completed about the first of January.\n\n6 June 1957\n\nWilcox Progressive Era, Camden\n\nR. L. HAWTHORNE JR.\n\nR. L. Hawthorne, Jr. this week announced that he has sold his feed seed and appliance store here to Orby Ratcliffe of Camden. Ratcliffe will operate the business under the name of Farmers’ Seed and Appliance Store.\n\nHawthorne, in years of service, is one of the oldest merchants in Camden, having begun his career when he went to work in his father’s store here on graduation from high school in 1915. Leaving for World War I service in the United States Navy Air Corps, he worked in Selma a short time following discharge from the Navy, then was associated for a time with Ball-Sims Lumber Co. at Yellow Bluff. In 1927 he went into business with his brother George Hawthorne in Bainbridge, Georgia. It was there he met and married his wife, then Jennilu McMahen of Oglethorpe, Georgia.\n\nThey returned to Camden in 1929, at which time he and his father R.L. Hawthorne Sr. went into the grocery business together. He bought out the elder Hawthorne in 1936, and became owner of the business then known as the Reed Star Grocery, it was at this time that Robert Lee Hawthorne saw the need for a cold storage locker plant in Wilcox County. And installed what was the fourth locker plant to be opened in Alabama. “It was an uphill business for awhile until people could be educated to the freezing of meats and vegetables,” saws Hawthorne, “But they soon learned the value of cold storage, and the business grew rapidly.” He also added two hatcheries and produced baby chicks for the area for several years.\n\nForeseeing a brighter future in the feed, seed, and appliance business, in 1945 he sold his grocery and erected a new building for the new store. For the past twelve years he has served livestock and poultry farmers, promoted feeding programs, and aided a number of persons to get established in cage-layer production. At present there are more than 6,000 hens in cages within a 15-mile radius of Camden. Hawthorne also has been Frigidaire dealer here since 1946, and at one time had three sub-dealers.\n\nAs a merchant here, Hawthorne enjoyed operating his business and made many friends throughout the county. “The two best days work I ever did were the day I married, and the day I sold my grocery business,” he says. “I hope that this will be the third best day.”\n\nHawthorne gives his wife full credit for her part in making his business a success. They have one son, Robert E. Hawthorne, an electrical engineer for Alabama Power Company, who lives with his wife in Mobile.\n\nHawthorne will assist Ratcliffe in the operation of the business for a few months, and expects to continue in the pecan business this fall. He will maintain an office in the old locker plant room, and states that he will welcome his friends at any time. He says too, that he hopes his old friends will continue to trade at “the store with the checkerboard sign,” and that he can assure them they will receive the same service and quality merchandise that he had to offer.\n\nTHERESA ANN COOK\n\nRepresenting Wilcox County High School in the annual Girls’ State Convention at Huntington College next week will be Theresa Ann Cook, of Camden. Girls’ State will be held from June 10 through 15th.\n\nGirls’ State is sponsored by the American Legion Auxiliary, and since there is not an active Auxiliary chapter in Camden, the Beta Club of WCHS voted to sponsor a representative from the school to this year’s convention. The Betas asked the faculty of the school to select an outstanding Junior girl, and Theresa Ann was chosen on the basis of leadership, character, achievement, and scholarship.\n\nTheresa Ann has been prominent in extracurricular school activities. She was a Band majorette for three years, and is currently a WCHS cheerleader. She is a member of the Beta Club, and has been a Glee Club and Band member for a number of years, as well as a number of other organizations in the school. She is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. McCown Cook, Sr., of Camden.\n\n18 January 1977\n\nThe Selma Times-Journal, Selma\n\nNew judge didn’t have ‘sense’ to ‘stay out”\n\nCAMDEN “I should have had enough sense to stay out of politics, but I didn’t.”\n\nThat statement was made here Monday by Reg Albritton after being sworn in as the new probate judge of Wilcox County. Albritton has held public office since 1946, serving the past six years as Wilcox County sheriff. He was a member of the Camden City Council for 16 years, six of which he served as mayor.\n\n“I appreciate the opportunity to serve the county as probate judge,” Albritton said. “I’m going to keep my campaign promise to make Wilcox County a better place to live for everyone.”\n\nAlbritton, who ran for probate judge in 1952, but was defeated, said he believes he can work well with the county commission as head of that governing body. “The commission members are my close friends, and I don’t anticipate any unusual differences of opinion among the members.”\n\nAlso sworn in Monday were District Judge Stanley Godbold, who will be starting his first term today, and county commissioners Alvin Stone, J.C. Martin, Sam Hicks, and Kennon Agee.\n\nIf you are interested in submitting an article for the newsletter, please let us know!\n\nEmail us at wilcoxhistoricalsociety@gmail.com or send via snail mail to\n\nP O Box 464, Camden, AL 36726.

Questions?\n\nDear WHS Members,\n\nI hope you are all well and are enjoying the change of weather. As you know it has been a very exciting fall for the Historical Society. From two great meetings and a fabulous Harvest Arts Concert to receiving another big grant and announcing Lady Carnarvon’s visit, we are making a big impact in Wilcox County. Thank you for being a part of this dynamic team!\n\nWe have so many reasons to be thankful. First, we are the largest civic organization in the county with well over 300 members and counting. We had not one, but two families contribute $10,000 each last month to start our first matching fund campaign for the Female Institute’s Restoration. As if that were not enough, the Hunter’s stepped forward as our first Diamond Sponsor of the Tour of Homes making Lady Carnarvon’s visit possible. Thank you all for your support, generosity, and enthusiasm for our Historical Society. Without you all, we would not be where we are today.\n\nEven with all that has already happened this fall, we are just getting started. I am looking forward to guiding our first WHS Trip to Natchez, Mississippi, the first week of November. We will be exploring the architecture of this great Southern City with its majestic homes filled with antiques. While there our group will be dining in some of the finest homes in the South. It is the first of what I hope will be a number of travel opportunities for the WHS. We are already looking at options for next year from Charleston to Newport and beyond.\n\n“Membership has its privileges…” they say. Your membership in the WHS gives you the first opportunity to purchase tickets (at a reduced rate) to the 2023 Tour of Homes in Pine Apple with our Guest Speaker, the Right Honorable Countess of Carnarvon of Highclere Castle. Lady Carnarvon has been fantastic to work with and is going to be a dynamic addition to the Tour. I hope you will all return the WHS Member Ticket Order Form on the last page of this Newsletter to guarantee your ticket to this year’s Tour.\n\nThe homeowners of Pine Apple have been hard at work since the spring preparing their homes for the Tour. Houses are being painted, floors refinished, drapes are being made, and furniture purchased to ensure that our guests see Pine Apple at its best. Thank you all for your hard work, time, and investment. I understand the commitment it takes and we appreciate all of your efforts.\n\nWhat a great time to be a part of the Wilcox Historical Society. My friends, together we will Raise the Bell at the Institute, host another successful Tour of Homes, and together we will show a Countess what Southern Hospitality is. We need your continued help and support to make this happen.\n\nThank you all,\n\nLance Britt, WHS President\n\nThe British are coming!\n\nWe have been overwhelmed by the response to our announcement that the Right Honorable Countess of Carnarvon, of “Downton Abbey’s” Highclere Castle will be our Keynote Speaker at the Tour of Homes. We worked with Lady Carnarvon to plan a day full of royal experiences on March 24, the day before our Tour in beautiful Pine Apple. It will be the perfect way to start our Tour Weekend!\n\nAs you know, Highclere Castle is one of the most notable homes in the world and Lady Carnarvon has been integral in its preservation. We are honored she has agreed to join us to share her experiences in restoring and preserving a 300-room castle. She has been an absolute joy to work with and is looking forward to her first visit to Alabama.\n\nBetween her visit and our nine gracious homeowners, we are going to have a fantastic weekend. Not only will we raise money for the WHS, but we will also generate positive public exposure for Pine Apple and Wilcox County. As if that were not enough, our Tour generates thousands of dollars in tax revenue for the county and is a big weekend for our local business owners as well. You will find the WHS Member Tour of Homes Ticket Order Form on the final page of this Newsletter. IT MUST BE RETURNED NO LATER THAN NOVEMBER 10 TO BE ELGIBLE FOR THE MEMBER PRESALE. Please return it immediately so we can process these orders before tickets are released to the general public. We will not honor any requests received after November 10. You will know by November 15th if we were able to fulfill your ticket request.\n\nWe will fulfill as many of your requests as possible. However, we can only accommodate a limited number of guests at certain events. Please understand we will not be able to accommodate every ticket request. We will do our best to offer other options in the event certain tickets sell out. If we are not able to accommodate your request, the money for that specific event will be refunded.\n\nRemember, with all the interest in our Tour of Homes and Lady Carnarvon’s visit, we are going to need your help to make it run well. As always, we will need volunteers to be guides in the homes on Saturday and we are going to need greeters at our various events Friday as well. Make plans now to be here March 24 – 25, 2023, and to be a volunteer one of the two days as we welcome British Nobility and over 1000 guests to Wilcox County.

Stephen and Lila McNair of Mobile and Jackie Sharp / Capell House of Camden! Thank you all for joining the WHS!\n\nRAISE THE BELL NEWS\n\nThe Raise the Bell Campaign has taken off like a rocket. This is thanks to the generosity of two families who have pledged to match every dollar donated up to $20,000! As a result, we have already raised close to $3000 in additional contributions since our September meeting. Please continue to help us spread the word about this great matching fund program. For more information or to get our Sponsorship Form, please go to our website wilcoxhistoricalsociety.org. Together we can meet our $20,000 goal and Raise the Bell at the Female Institute.\n\nIn addition to the matching fund campaign, we received a $37,500 grant last month from the Alabama Historical Commission to help us restore the Institute! This is the third consecutive year we have received a grant from the AHC. We are very thankful for their continued support.\n\nThe Board would like to thank Ms. Katie Summerville of Faunsdale for writing this grant which was our largest award by far from the AHC. She is currently working on other grant requests for us as well. With her expertise and experience we hope to continue to raise grant funds for the Female Institute.\n\nThis award is our second this year. As previously reported, we received a $40,000 grant from the Alabama Council for the Arts this summer. Together, the $77,500 in grant monies along with those pledged and raised through our Matching Fund Campaign, have generated over $100,000! With your continued support and Katie’s grant writing skills, we will Raise the Bell at the Female Institute.\n\nMEMBER SPOTLIGHT –\n\nMartha Grimes Lampkin\n\nI am pleased to be the WHS Newsletter Editor and Social Media Manager – two jobs that were created when I became WHS President in 2017. I served as president for 3 years. With the encouragement of my niece, Elizabeth Grimes, (then Wilcox Area Chamber of Commerce Director), plans for an annual WHS Tour of Homes were renewed in 2017. The\n\n“Homes of the River’s Bend Tour” was a big success with Elizabeth as Tour Coordinator and the WHS tours have grown to one of the largest historical homes tours in Alabama under Lance Britt’s leadership.\n\nI grew up in the little town of Marion Junction, Dallas County, Alabama and graduated from Auburn University Montgomery with a degree in Finance. After college I moved to Birmingham and worked in the AmSouth Trust Department for several years later moving to Daphne, Alabama and working for real estate developer, Tonsmeire Development Corporation. I returned to banking in 1989 working as a credit analyst and then a mortgage loan officer at Regions Bank in Mobile.\n\nGrowing up hearing stories of family history and Alabama history with a few ghost stories mixed in as told by my grandmother, Frances Donald Grimes and my parents, Harold and Virginia Grimes, I learned to appreciate my Southern heritage. My grandmother was a wonderful historian and story teller and she was well known for her knowledge of local history. In 1978 she published My Family History and Memoirs for our family after years of genealogy research and the year she died, 1989, she completed a History of Pine Apple Wilcox County, Alabama 1815-1989 with Robert A. Smith, III.\n\nBeing greatly influenced by my grandmother’s love of family, history and research I have spent years researching my father’s family lines of the Grimes, Watts, Donald, Yeldell, Roberts, Thigpen and others as well as my mother’s family lines of Lamkin, Hamilton, Williams, Majors and others. As they say, “Genealogy is not a hobby, it is an obsession.” I am an active contributor to FindAGrave memorials and have transcribed and published the Friendship Baptist Church of Pine Apple records for the years 1862-1907.\n\nI enjoy photography and gardening. I also manage social media accounts for the Butler County Historical and Genealogical Society as well as the Bear Creek Preservation Association and our guest house, The Pine Apple Bungalow. We are members of the Church of the Highlands in Montgomery.\n\nSince 2015 I have worked as Marketing Coordinator for Lake Martin Voice Realty, a small real estate firm in the Lake Martin, Alabama area. In this job I manage the social media accounts, website updates and blog posts, coordinate the listings of new property for sale, continually update the LMVR app and help create real estate listing videos and photos. My husband, James and I married in August 1991 in a church my family and I hold dear, the Mt. Moriah Fellowship Baptist Church near Monterey located at the Butler County / Wilcox County lines. This little “church in the wildwood” was established in 1828 with my ancestors joining in the 1830s and each October we gather for an annual homecoming celebration. Our wedding reception was held at Greenleaves in Pine Apple and I know my grandparents are pleased that we continue to enjoy time in the family home to this day. I feel so fortunate to be the owner of\n\nGreenleaves and James and I are happy to be the caretakers of this beautiful old home that has been in my family for over 150 years.\n\nJames and I are the proud parents of two children, Harold Brooks Lampkin, MD married to Margo Edwards Lampkin and Virginia Frances “Ginny” Lampkin Morgan, OD married to Jake Morgan. We are also the proud G Daddy and Marmee of little granddaughters, Lucy Clare Lampkin and Julia Frances Lampkin. And I certainly don’t want to forget to mention we have two spoiled cocker spaniels, Kisses and Bentley.\n\nThe WHS 2023 Tour of Homes will feature nine historic homes in Pine Apple this year and we are happy to have two homes on the Tour – Greenleaves (pictured above) and the Pine Apple Bungalow. Greenleaves was built in 1854 by Augustus Powell. My great, great grandmother – Letitia Roberts Grimes, bought the home in 1869, two years after the death of her husband, my great, great grandfather, Wiley Grimes.\n\nAfter the 1893 marriage of my great grandfather, William Henry Grimes to Josephine Watts, the home was remodeled adding the three front gables and two front rooms and porches with gingerbread trim. Pictured at left is the Grimes family about 1912 on the front steps of Greenleaves.\n\nJames and I renovated Greenleaves in 2005 and live there part time and in Montgomery part time.\n\nThe Pine Apple Bungalow next door to Greenleaves, was built in the early 1920s for my great aunt Lois Grimes and husband Hayden Lewis. Next my grandfather Harold Watts Grimes lived there bringing his bride, his childhood sweetheart, my grandmother, Frances Donald Dudley Grimes and her son, Hugh Dudley to live there when they married in 1927. In 1930 my father was born and the family lived there until 1931 when they moved next door to Greenleaves. My husband and I together with help from our children, friends and family have recently restored the bungalow and enjoy using it as a guest house and hunting lodge.\n\nMy Wilcox County roots go back to 1824 when Wiley Grimes first appeared in public records for his marriage to his first wife, Elizabeth Coleson. A number of my ancestors came to Alabama before the Territory became a state – 1815 with James Powers, to 1816 with Richard Warren and James Steen, to 1818 with Robert Anthony Yeldell. I am proud to support Wilcox County and preserve its history for future generations. I agree with Daniel Webster who said, “He who knoweth not from whence he came, careth little whither he goeth.”\n\nD O N A T I O N S\n\nMany thanks for your gifts and continuing support!\n\nA memorial, birthday, anniversary or just a nice way to say thank you can be done in a donation to the Wilcox Historical Society.

Dumas, Associate Professor of Anthropology at The University of West Alabama. She is an archaeologist specializing in the late prehistory and history of the Southeastern United States.\n\n“For more than a century, historians, archaeologists and anthropologists have scoured areas of west Alabama in search of the remains of Mabila – a fortified Indian village where, in October 1540, the forces of notorious Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto clashed with Native American warriors under the direction of their dynamic leader, Chief Tascalusa.” This battle is believed to be the largest battle every found between Europeans and the indigenous people of North America.\n\nNow supported by a growing collection of artifacts, Dr. Dumas and the University of West Alabama team are convinced they are within a few miles of finding the site of the town and the infamous battle. Those in attendance were able to view some of the artifacts the team has found in Marengo County.\n\nThe meeting was held at the Wilcox Female Institute with a reception afterwards.\n\nPictured is Dr. Ashley Dumas with WHS members Andy and Kathy Coats examining a fragment of a 16th century horseshoe which is one of the documented artifacts that is leading to the discover of the battle site. In Marengo County, Dumas and her colleagues have thus far found 52 confirmed pieces of Spanish-made metal, such as horseshoe remnants and iron chisels repurposed from the metal bands that strengthened wooden barrels.\n\nMOZART AND FRIENDS\n\nCONCERT IN CAMDEN\n\nThe Camden Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church was the venue for the Harvest Arts Harp Quintet on September 26th. A large crowd attended the concert sponsored by the WHS.\n\nThe concert featured performers on Violin, Viola and Cello in addition to Wilcox County favorites Madeline Cawley, Flute and Hannah Cope Johnson, Harp. The violinist and violist perform with the Nashville Symphony and the cellist just returned from a nationwide Broadway Tour of Oklahoma!\n\nThe WHS hosted a reception at the Wilcox Female Institute following the concert.\n\nWHS October Meeting\n\nRosemary Plantation and\n\nthe Families Who Called it Home\n\nOur October meeting was held on Sunday afternoon, October 9th at Rosemary Plantation in the Miller’s Ferry area of Wilcox County near Camden. Members and guests enjoyed hearing three speakers share the history of the home and the families who lived there.\n\nThe speakers included the present owner, Brock Jones and Mason McGowin, a descendant of the Mathews family and Carter Fowlkes, a descendant of the Mathews-Cade family. Mr. Fowlkes also shared with us portraits of Peter Early Mathews and wife Virginia Vaughan Mathews.\n\nRosemary sits near the Alabama River and was built on the highest land in the river valley. The home, circa 1856, was built for the Peter Early Mathews family on roughly 2,000 acres of land. Sadly, Mr. Mathews died in 1856 leaving the estate to his wife.\n\nAfter the death of Mrs. Mathews in 1891 “The Mathews Place” was inherited by nephew Frank Cade in 1897. The home was named “Rosemary” by Mr. Cade’s wife, Mary, not for roses or her own name, but for the fragrant herb. Mary also added a second story to the home and the large center staircase around 1900.\n\nThose present at the meeting enjoyed touring the house and grounds as well as refreshments and fellowship.\n\nEditor’s Note – the WHS Winter 2022 Newsletter has a more detailed article written about Rosemary by Mr. Carter Fowlkes and it can be found on our website.\n\nHugh Joseph Dudley, 97, passed away at his home in Huntsville on October 5, 2022.

Dale\n\nShared by daughter, WHS member Jane Shelton Dale\n\nSabbath night\n\nDearest Mother and Daddy,\n\nI saw the President-elect last night. Was just about to come back to Forest Home after the teachers’ meeting yesterday afternoon when suddenly I decided I wanted to go to Montgomery, so I went. It didn’t take me any time to find a mighty nice fellow going that way. He was a Methodist preacher who lives in Montgomery and is now chaplain for the State convict department. Had his son, a boy about my age, along with him and also a man from Evergreen, a Mr. Rushton who manages the Ford agency there. Got there about five-thirty. The president’s train was to get in at seven so I went up to the capitol grounds early and got me a good place to stand where I could see and hear well. In fact, I think I had about as good a position as anybody; I stood just at the top of that long flight of steps leading up to the capitol and he and Uncle Meek spoke from the front porch, so, you see, I was just in front of them. There was certainly a mob of people there, and so many soldiers, national guards, etc. The Parade came up Dexter and then went around back of the capitol and they came in to the capitol from the back and on to the porch. Uncle Meek made a fine introduction and then Roosevelt’s speech was fine too. You’ll read them and all about it in the papers, of course. I could see them all perfectly and hear every word. I passed by the mansion and saw it all decorated up for the reception but of course I didn’t see any of the folks. Well, I really didn’t have any plans as to what I’d do after that – didn’t know whether I’d spend the night here or not – but decided I’d go to the Exchange and maybe run up on somebody from Camden. You know, if you’ll just stand around there, you’ll see everybody in Montgomery. I saw the J.R. Bells from Selma and talked with them awhile. Mrs. Bell asked about you. Also saw C. F. and Warb Primm, Jack Alford, Pettus Randall, the Banks girls, Miss Ruby Duke and her folks, some people from Greenville, and in fact about the first person I saw was Mr. Watt. He and two other fellows from here had gone up there in his car so they had plenty of room for me to come home with them. The other two fellows had his car off somewhere and were supposed to meet him there at nine, but they were real late getting back and we didn’t get home until about 2:15 this morning.\n\nYour devoted,\n\nHugh\n\nMr. Hugh Dale graduated from Erskine College in 1932 and his first job was principal at the school in Forest Home, Butler County, Alabama. Jane Shelton Dale shares that soon after this letter was written her Daddy went to Columbia University and received a Master’s in Chemistry and taught in Birmingham and Atlanta before WWII.\n\nEditor’s Note: President-Elect Franklin D. Roosevelt’s visit to Montgomery was on Saturday, January 21, 1933. The Montgomery Advertiser’s headlines on January 22 read “Roosevelt Won by Tumultuous Welcome Here.” The headline went on to read “Visit Brings Largest Crowd Ever Seen In Streets; Governor Gives Dinner”. And Uncle Meek as mentioned in the letter was Governor Benjamin Meek Miller from Camden – Alabama governor from 1931-1935.\n\nHER MAJESTY THE QUEEN\n\nWritten by Frances Donald Dudley Grimes in 1977 – the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II\n\nIn the early spring of the year 1926 George V sat upon the throne of England. Only one of his four sons was married, Prince Albert, Duke of York. Yet for 70 years the male succession to the throne had seldom seemed more secure.\n\nThree years had passed since the splendid Duke of York’s wedding in Westminster Abbey to Elizabeth Bowes Lyon in 1924. Tho’ the Duke stood second to the crown, he and the Duchess had no permanent home, for known as the Industrial Prince, he travelled throughout the realm and they lived mostly out of suitcases.\n\nWhen the happiness of a future baby became assured, the Duchess decided that she wanted her baby to be born in her parent’s London home at 17 Bruton Street.\n\nThis was the first public statement to herald the present queen: her Royal Highness, the Duchess of York was safely delivered of a Princess at 2:40 a.m. this morning, Wednesday, April 21st, 1926. King George V and Queen Mary were awakened at 4:00 a.m. to tell them of the good news and Queen Mary said: “Such a relief and joy.”\n\nTwo weeks later, on May 29th the baby princess was christened in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace, with ceremonial water brought from the River Jordan. She wore the christening robe of cream Brussels lace that had been used for the children of Queen Victoria. She was named Elizabeth Alexandra Mary.\n\nThe early years of the future Queen Elizabeth chronicled in some detail by her family, by friends and by at least one governess, Miss Marion Crawford, a Scot woman who became known as Crawfie by the two little princesses. Her family was dominated by her grandfather, King George V who was the first British Monarch to exemplify the majesty of the ordinary man. He personified all that his people felt most comfortable with and set the stage for British Monarchy that has been followed ever since, most notably by his granddaughter, Elizabeth II. Patriotism for the king was a personal thing. He believed in God, the invincibility of the Royal Navy, the essential rightness of whatever was British, the unquestioning subordination of thine to duty and a boundless capacity for hard work. These are some of the debts, instinctive and cultivated that Queen Elizabeth II owes to her grandfather and they have helped make her a descendant and successor of whom he could feel thoroughly proud.\n\nQueen Mary, who was more than an ordinary grandmother set out to play the most active role in the upbringing of Princess Elizabeth and her influence on her life, work and personality was to emulate that of her royal Grandfather.\n\nOn August 21, 1930, the Duchess gave birth to another daughter, who was named Margaret Rose. Elizabeth might have been overshadowed in the public eye if her mother had given birth to a son but the arrival of Margaret Rose had the opposite effect. Queen Mary saw the danger of all of this –on one occasion, at Herrod’s one of London’s most prestigious stores, Queen Mary saw the little princess wriggling and asked if she wanted to go home. “Oh no Granny,” she said. “Think of all the people who are waiting to see us,” where upon Queen Mary had the little girl taken down the back way and sent home in a taxi. Gratifying the public, Elizabeth must learn was not an end in itself and being a royal was a matter of living out a role, not acting it.\n\nWhen Elizabeth was 6 years old, Miss Crawford, her governess, organized a 6-day school curriculum for her, which included history, geography, Bible reading, with detailed emphasis on physical geography of the Dominions and India.\n\nBy the early 30’s life was taking on a pleasantly settled character for the Duke and Duchess of York and their two little daughters. It was about this time though that Edward, Prince of Wales first met Mrs. Wallis Simpson, which relationship led to his abdication in 1936 and put Elizabeth in direct line of succession to the throne. But even more important, it provided the awful example that overshadowed the Princess’s adolescence and remains a shadow over the royal family to this day, of how not to behave when one is blessed with the sacred trust of monarchy.\n\nThe Prince of Wales, David to his family, was Princess Elizabeth’s favorite uncle and he got great pleasure in indulging her. In her early childhood there was little suspicion a betrayal of this sacred trust by her uncle David. In fact, he seemed to be blazing a new trail for 20th century monarchy to follow. He had fought to get close to the trenches in World War I and had won. He had been the first member of the Royal family to speak on radio and other incidents seemed to herald a more democratic approach to monarchy in the future. He was a playboy though and had several affairs with women which King George and Queen Mary tried to ignore, for the prince was the rogue factor in the representative monarchy that thy had so painstakingly molded and which made for constant tension in the family.\n\nNow began the bitterness over Wallis Simpson, a twice married woman, which divided the British royal family well into the reign of Queen Elizabeth II for feelings began to harden as he began parading his relationship with her in the autumn of 1934. He bought fabulous jewels for her form Cartier in Paris, and as if that were not enough, to which hurt King George and Queen Mary especially was that many of the jewels that Mrs. Simpson paraded were royal heirlooms from the priceless collection of the King’s mother Queen Alexandra, who bequeathed them to the Prince of Wales to be worn by his future wife.\n\nIt was in 1934-35 that people began to see a dulling of the Prince’s appetite for work and a boredom and irritation on his face as he carried out his public engagements. King George was greatly worried as he spent long hours of the last September of his life discussing the problems of his son with the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nKing George V died on January 20th, 1936; his death had taken everyone by surprise even tho’ he had been in bad health for sometimes. Before his father’s death, tho’ the Prince of Wales closest friends were talking about the possibility of him renouncing his right of succession in favor of his younger brother, the Duke of York.\n\nPublic opinion now began to focus upon the little Princess Elizabeth, who was now 10 years old but she was totally unaware of this.\n\nFlouting the wishes of his elected government and pursuing personal enthusiasm with no regard for the reaction of the nation as a whole, Kind Edward VIII wanted to be himself on his own terms which was impossible.\n\nOn the evening of November 16, 1936, he had dinner with his mother, Queen Mary, and spoke openly to her, for the first time, of his love for Mrs. Simpson. This was the parting of ways. In Edward’s eyes his duty was to the woman he loved rather than duty to the monarchy. Queen Mary wrote a letter to her son in 1938 giving him her interpretation of Duty from which are some excerpts, “You remember how miserable I was when you informed me of you intended marriage and abdication and how I implored you not to do so for our sake and for the sake of the country. You did not seem able to take in any point of view but your own. It seemed inconceivable to those who had made such sacrifices during the war, that you, as their king refused a lesser sacrifice. My feeling for you as your mother remains the same, and our being parted and the cause of it, grieve me by your words, after all, all my life I have put my country before everything else and simply can’t change now.”\n\nOn Friday, December 11, 1936, was the day that Princess Elizabeth formally became heir to the throne, for her father became King by the instrument of abdication which Edward had signed the day before. The Ex-King made his farewell broadcast that night which most of us remember,"
