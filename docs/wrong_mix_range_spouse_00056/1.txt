1.20.06 - TV Guide Online - Charmed Hits a (Final?) Milestone

by Matt Webb Mitovich

With its Jan. 22 broadcast, WB's Charmed (Sundays at 8 pm/ET) — which premiered Oct. 7, 1998 — becomes the longest-running television series boasting all female leads, having bewitched viewers for more years than such estrogen-heavy fare as Laverne & Shirley, Designing Women and Sex and the City. To mark the milestone, TVGuide.com sat down with executive producer Brad Kern to assess the show's assets, assay the avidness of its fans and conjure up a peek at its future — no matter how (gulp!) finite it may be. TVGuide.com: Regarding the milestone you've achieved, how does one even stumble upon such a factoid?

Brad Kern: I don't know. I kept pressing the publicity people, saying, "Are we sure we're right about this?" because wasn't Murder, She Wrote on for, like, 12 years? They said, "No, no, this is for female leads, plural." I guess the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences contacted Paramount to alert us to the fact that we had surpassed the longest-running hour featuring female leads, and the only milestone left [to surpass] was the longest-running half-hour [Laverne & Shirley].

TVGuide.com: And this Sunday, you actually take the title.

Kern: I wonder if I get any door prizes!

TVGuide.com: Something I always find interesting is that every week, Charmed lands in the Top 20 searches on TVGuide.com, but, of course, the show isn't in the Top 20 of the Nielsen ratings. Why do you think that is? What's your view on the fan base?

Kern: The WB has moved us three or four times, and yet each time they do that, the fans have followed. I just think these kinds of shows lend themselves to loyal fan bases. When I was on [The Adventures of] Lois and Clark [as a coexecutive producer-writer], the Internet was just becoming big, and we had a huge fan base on that show. I know The X-Files does and did. And Buffy, and now Lost. These shows all seem to attract computer-savvy fans. Once they like a show, they are loyal as loyal can be, and that's probably why we get so many hits on the Internet.

TVGuide.com: Plus with this type of show, fans can get wrapped up in the mythology, the addition and subtraction of powers, the assorted demons....

Kern: Sure — almost to a fault. Unfortunately, all shows have to reach beyond the loyal fan base, and those [new viewers] would get lost in the minutiae if you spent too much time trying to connect all the dots. Part of the challenge is to always reward the loyal fan base with consistent mythology, but not be so locked into it where you've cornered yourself and can't do stories that the rest of the audience can follow.

TVGuide.com: One fan criticism is that Charmed, as of late, sometimes veers from sisters-focused storytelling and is more about other relationships.

Kern: There are two reasons for that. One, it's the eighth year, so you have to branch the series out; it has to grow from what you've done. The second reason, which ties into the first, is that there are only so many "sister stories" you can do. The stars have been doing the series for so long that the only way I can make it fresh for them is to give them new material that has them, more often than not, working off other actors and characters, while I also try to give them some time off. Working eight straight days, like they did for so many years, [makes them] burned out, and understandably so. I'm fully aware of the loyal fans' concerns of pulling away from the sisters, but there's no way to do it anymore. Eight years later, you can't have the sisters still sitting around the dinner table complaining about life every week because after a while, they look around and go, "Didn't we have this conversation before?"

TVGuide.com: You've also taken some heat for writing out Brian Krause's Leo. Did you anticipate that, or did you think you could slip him out quietly?

Kern: When I was forced into writing Leo out of the show, for budgetary reasons, the first thing I told anybody who would listen — the powers that be — was that it is a huge mistake and the fans would be in an uproar. But the budget ax swung very deeply in bringing us back [for this season], and it was non-negotiable. I had nothing to do with it. I'm the first one to say that, because I was the one left having to figure out how to take him out! I was the one who fought for him to be on the show for even 10 episodes this year. I had to find money from other places to keep him around.

TVGuide.com: You had to fire a couple of leprechauns, didn't you?

Kern: I had to do a lot, personally and professionally, to figure out where some of that money would come from. Knowing the fans would be upset and knowing that this is the series finale we're building up to, the only thing I felt I could do was not to kill off his character, but basically put him in limbo and play "How to bring Leo and Piper back together" for the rest of the season leading up to the finale, where hopefully we'll be able to creatively and proactively bring him back.

TVGuide.com: So is this officially Charmed's final season?

Kern: Nobody at WB will commit one way or the other. I've heard nothing about it. As far as I'm concerned, this is it. Last year the show was held in limbo, but fortunately "the governor called" and we got another year. I wasn't able to craft a season or series finale [then], so I did sort of a hybrid, which to me was disappointing creatively. This year, with no contract for the girls [Alyssa Milano, Holly Marie Combs, Rose McGowan and Kaley Cuoco] and no contract for me, the WB seems to be looking forward to looking for "the next generation" of shows. We're still an expensive show, and all those factors tell me that, here in the middle of January, I'm just pushing toward the series finale. It's too late for them to say, "We want to find a way to make a ninth season" — but it doesn't mean there can't be a spin-off.

TVGuide.com: Is the sometime-rumored Kaley Cuoco/Billie spin-off an option?

Kern: Any spin-off is still an option, because no one has ruled out any options at the WB. I have heard nothing, the silence has been deafening. I've just been going about doing my job and trying to build up to a series finale, not something that's neither here nor there like last year.

TVGuide.com: With that said, what's coming up during the back half of the season? Any returns for Cole or Prue?

Kern: [Laughs] In my ideal world... The huge problem I have to deal with this year is the budget cutback. I'm trying to save money each episode so I can afford to bring back as many of the regular cast members as possible. Who that will be, I don't know, but my plan is to have the equivalent of a "family reunion" including as many people as I can afford. I'm not going to be able to get Julian McMahon back [as Cole]; I twisted his arm, and begged and bribed him to come back for the 150th episode last year, which he so lovingly offered to do. But that doesn't mean I don't have flashbacks! [Laughs] I can pull back the celluloid. The goal for me is to take the series out the way it began. It's interesting that one of the criticisms, rightfully so, is about the lack of sisterhood, but I'm building to it being all about sisters. Even when we talk about Kaley Cuoco's Billie, we're going to be bringing her sister, Christy, into the show [played by recent Supernatural guest star Marnette Patterson], working around the final ultimate battle. That seems kind of poetic because that's what the series has fundamentally always been about, and that's how it will end.

TVGuide.com: What's the bullet on Christy?

Kern: As we know, she was kidnapped by a demon when Billie was 5 and the sister was 7. She will be found after spending the last 15 years with demons.

TVGuide.com: Hmm, I take it she's not too happy.

Kern: She's a little traumatized, and certainly mysterious. Who is she? Is she the sweet child who had the potential of powers before she was taken, or has she been Stockholm Syndrome'd and now believes in the demonic way?

TVGuide.com: Ah, the age-old nature vs. nurture debate.

Kern: You got it! [It's a question] we've played with and toyed with and worked every way possible over the last eight years, and [for the finale] we would like to return to it.

1.12.06 - Kristin at E!Online says that this is most likely the last season for Charmed - it would take a ratings miracle to save the show at this point.

12.8.05 - Someone has started a campaign for a spin-off starring Wes Ramsey and Drew Fuller. thecharmedsons.com

12.5.05 - Kerr Smith (7th season's Agent Kyle Brody) has been added to the cast of NBC's freshman series, E-Ring. He has already guest-starred in three episodes, and he will make his first appearance as a regular cast member after E-Ring returns from its holiday rerun cycle. Smith will continue his role as Bobby Wilkerson, a member of the Pentagon's Special Ops force and a friend of J.T. Tisnewski (series star Benjamin Bratt).

11.25.05 - TV Guide: Will Charmed's Cop Learn the Truth?

by Matt Webb Mitovich

Earlier this month, Ivan Sergei — whom you probably remember as the Jill in Jack & Jill — returned to WB via Charmed (Sundays at 8 pm/ET), playing Henry, a lawman oblivious to the ladies' witchy ways. Here's what the actor had to share with TVGuide.com about his charmed existence, the one role he let slip away and his flirtation with danger.

TVGuide.com: For the uninitiated, how would you describe your Charmed role?

Ivan Sergei: I'm playing Henry, a parole officer. In my first episode, one of my parolees is destined for future greatness, but he's not really showing it to me, so I need Rose McGowan's Paige character to come along and show me the way. In the process, we start a budding little romance.

TVGuide.com: Are you being groomed to fill the void left when Brian Krause exits as Leo?

Sergei: Well, as of now, Henry is not aware of any witchcraft or anything like that, which has been kind of fun.

TVGuide.com: You're Darren Stevens with a badge!

Sergei: That's true.

TVGuide.com: How long does Charmed have you for?

Sergei: The rest of the season.

TVGuide.com: How is the "colorful" Rose McGowan as a leading lady?

Sergei: She's absolutely great. I'm not really one who reads the magazines or anything, so I didn't know anything about her. When I came on, people said, "Rose is a strong person." I kind of like that, actually, so it's been all gravy for me.

TVGuide.com: When I interviewed Justin Kirk about Weeds, we were talking about how all of you Jack & Jillers seem to be doing well for yourselves.

Sergei: I think so. Not as well as Amanda [Peet], as of yet, but yeah, everybody's working. Jaime [Pressly] is doing well, as [My Name Is] Earl goes strong....

TVGuide.com: How was Jack & Jill as a work experience?

Sergei: It was a little up-and-down — our show runner left after one year — but it was a great experience. For me, just to be a title character on a show that's on the air for two years was wonderful. I previously had done John Woo's Once a Thief, which was a Canadian show, so this was a great opportunity. I actually got offered the part and got to sit in on most of the auditions and have a bit of say, in particular with Justin's character [Barto] coming in. I think we had replaced Amelia Heinle (The Young and the Restless) as the original Jack, so I had a little say in bringing Amanda in.

TVGuide.com: Amelia and Amanda are, like, "separated at birth," looks-wise.

Sergei: Yeah, but they couldn't be more different in personality, and I think that was a different direction the show wanted to go with.

TVGuide.com: How was your gig as a Crossing Jordan doc?

Sergei: You know, I'm very happy on Charmed, but I really wish I had stayed on Crossing Jordan. I took a chance to go do Hawaii, where I was the No. 2 guy on that show and it was a Hawaii-based cop show. I actually asked the people at Crossing Jordan, where I was No. 9 on the call sheet, to release me from my contract.

TVGuide.com: The math seemed simple enough.

Sergei: The math looked simple and the location was simple [Laughs] but Crossing Jordan has some great producers and a great show runner. It's the same feeling I have on Charmed — a well-run, friendly set.

TVGuide.com: On Jordan, did you overlap with Jennifer Finnigan (now star of Close to Home)?

Sergei: Yeah, absolutely. That was the whole time Jill [Hennessy] was pregnant, so they were bringing in new people to do new things with the show. I think that helped it keep going at a time when their lead character wasn't around for half the season.

TVGuide.com: In a way, Finnigan arrived at the same crossroads as you, leaving Jordan to headline the sitcom Committed.

Sergei: Yeah, but she was only recurring, whereas I had a six-year contract. She knew she was going to be moving onto another show, having come off [three Daytime] Emmys [wins] and doing so well in daytime.... She's really talented and obviously [Close to Home producer] Jerry Bruckheimer is the best in the business. He started my career, so I have nothing but fondness for him. My first film was Dangerous Minds, which you wouldn't expect to go make $100 million necessarily, but put it in the hands of someone like him and he turned it into gold.

TVGuide.com: You costarred with Tori Spelling in the TV-movie Mother, May I Sleep with Danger....

Sergei: Which airs all... the... time. [Laughs]

TVGuide.com: I take it you were "danger"?

Sergei: I was "danger," yes. Tough role to play. If I had a chance to do it again, I'd probably play it differently; I feel like I overacted a bit. But those are the chances you take when you take a psychotic role. I mean, what do you really draw from? [Laughs]

TVGuide.com: Leave us with a tease of what's coming up on Charmed.

Sergei: They don't really tell me too much. I know that I am going to find out that Paige is a witch. I think it's going to be a fun kind of episode where I'm having a bad week, so she tells the fairies to stop stealing my keys and tells the leprechauns to help me out a bit, so I, like, win the lottery and stuff like that. I think they're going to have some fun with it, and I'm looking forward to it. I'm having a great time.

11.4.05 - TV Guide interviewed Jennifer Love Hewitt about her new CBS show, Ghost Whisperer, and included this question:

TVGuide.com: You were invited to succeed Shannen Doherty on Charmed. Why didn't you?

Hewitt: It just wasn't the right thing. They were lovely people and I was really honored to be asked and I actually really like the show, but it just wasn't the right time.

10.25.05 - Ted Casablanca at E!Online reports that Shannen Doherty was spotted "gettin' all lap happy with USC QB Matt Leinart. Victoria's Secret Mood Candle launch party. At, duh, Mood. Yep, Shan doll--who is incapable of going out without causing some sort of a scene, bless her nasty-girl heart--was all over this hunk, sittin' on his lap, cooin' in his ear."

10.21.05 - TV Guide: Charmed's Leo Safe from Demons

by Matt Webb Mitovich

Sure, Alyssa Milano and Holly Marie Combs have been around since Day 1, but it says a whole lot more that Brian Krause has lasted a full seven years on WB's Charmed (Sundays at 8 pm/ET), which frankly isn't known for providing job security for male actors. Indeed, Krause knows that his is a charmed existence, in more ways than one.

TVGuide.com: Dude, you work with Alyssa Milano, Holly Marie Combs, Rose McGowan and now Kaley Cuoco. Not exactly the hardest job in Hollywood, is it?

Brian Krause: Yeah, I think there have been more difficult jobs, that's for sure.

TVGuide.com: What's ahead this season? Could newbie witch Billie, whom Leo is spending a lot of time tutoring, cause problems for him and Piper?

Krause: I don't think she'll cause problems for us specifically, but — it's funny to say it like this — any time you get a new witch with new powers, there will be repercussions in her just learning the craft while we try to teach her the way. She definitely has some pitfalls, but obviously she'll come through with success and flying colors — and have demons in her future. [Laughs]

TVGuide.com: So there's no threat of sparks between Billie and her teach?

Krause: Piper and I run into the typical marriage issues. Now that I'm mortal, I'm trying to get her to spend more time with me. That's the big issue between them — separating the sisters from the magic, weaning them off so that they can lead normal lives.

TVGuide.com: I suppose if Leo were to stray, who knows what kind of hell Piper could unleash on him?

Krause: Yeah, exactly! [Laughs]

TVGuide.com: Ever since last season's finale, Leo and the girls have been living with "new faces," although viewers still see the same actors. Are you happy with your "alias" face?

Krause: Uh, yeah, I have no problems with it. It's not the same guy [as in finale]. I think the girls changed and the guy changed.

TVGuide.com: How much are the "alias" actors getting paid to spend eight seconds a week looking into a mirror?

Krause: I have no idea. I have no idea. [Laughs]

TVGuide.com: Has this gig proven better than you ever imagined back in 1998?

Krause: Absolutely. I started as a three-episode, possibly recurring character, and in that first season I wound up doing seven [episodes], and in the next [season] did 15 and they made me a regular. It's beyond what I thought it was going to be, and has grown and grown into me being an integral part of the show. It's a bit of a dream come true as far as a job goes.

TVGuide.com: Let's talk about two of your past projects. Which was a better trip: the Return to the Blue Lagoon or the Return to Cabin by the Lake?

Krause: Well, I'll tell you, you can't beat [Blue Lagoon's] Fiji — it was unbelievable down there. I spent three months learning how to live on an island and fish and climb coconut trees....

TVGuide.com: With Milla Jovovich, no less...

Krause: With Milla and a wonderful cast and crew. [Cabin's] Vancouver [shoot] wasn't too shabby, either. I made a lot of friends up there. Judd Nelson is a veteran and a class character, a great guy to work with.

TVGuide.com: He seems due for one of those "retro" comebacks.

Krause: He's a great guy and a good actor. I think we'll be seeing him forever.

TVGuide.com: Your bio says you enjoy "jam sessions on your harmonica." Quick, make that sound sexy for the ladies out there.

Krause: Uh, well, basically we play evil and sexy music late Friday nights in some dark dingy rehearsal studio on the West Side. Our mantra is "dark, evil and sexy." [Laughs]

TVGuide.com: Just be careful not to smash your hand while renovating your house. How is that going, anyway?

Krause: Doing it with my friends and basically contracting it myself, I've been working on it for two-and-a-half years. It takes as long as it takes; I do it on my days off. I've been building a walk-in closet for six months now. I'm over it!

TVGuide.com: Too bad there are no witches to snap their fingers and finish it up for you.

Krause: You know? I think it'd be "personal gain," though. It'd be a problem. [Laughs]

TVGuide.com: What else do you have filling your time?

Krause: I wrote, produced and directed my first short film, The Mission, and we're getting that out to all the circuits.

TVGuide.com: You play [reading press release] an "alcohol-drinking, cigarette-smoking, gun-carrying man in search of missing links to his past"?

Krause: Yeah, that's a classic little line there, huh?

TVGuide.com: All that's missing is "bimbo-bedding."

Krause: Yeah. No s---! He's basically a private investigator/bounty hunter who winds up on a personal bounty of his own, in which he trails this person who has a connection that will change his life.

TVGuide.com: How does General Hospital vet Jacklyn Zeman figure into it?

Krause: She plays my mark, the one that I'm after, and the reveal at the end is something very personal to [my character]. He had to overcome his demons to follow her and actually make his approach to her.

TVGuide.com: Hey, you said "demons." We don't like that word!

Krause: Yeah, but these are inner demons. [Laughs]

10.20.05 - Rose McGowan was handcuffed and booted from a T-mobile bash Tuesday night in Hollywood after getting into a scuffle with a security guard. McGowan's rep claims that the guard was "standing uncomfortably close to her" on the dance floor, causing his client to flip out.

After the media frenzies over her exits from "Beverly Hills, 90210" and "Charmed," the actress was let go from UPN's new Thursday sitcom "Love, Inc." after making the pilot episode. More...

8.20.05 - Zap2It.com: 'Charmed' Magically Stays Alive - Last April on the set of The WB Network's Sunday-night supernatural drama "Charmed," tempers were a bit frayed. The seventh-season finale was in production, and there was no word yet on whether the show had been renewed. Star Holly Marie Combs, who plays Piper, the eldest of three demon-vanquishing good-witch sisters, was getting a bit cranky. More...

8.17.05 - Michael Ausiello at TV Guide reports that last Monday, Brad Kern acknowledged that "there's every likelihood" that this will be the show's final season. "The girls' contracts are up this season, and I wouldn't imagine that they would want to, or should be expected to, come back after devoting pretty much their entire 20s to Charmed. But you can never say never." Kern, who's keeping open the possibility of a spin-off built around Kaley Cuoco's new witch, said this season viewers will see a shift in focus "more toward the girls' personal lives. It's going to be fun to watch their Sex and the City-like antics as they try to do something they've never done before, which is try to lead normal lives."

8.17.05 - Due to budget cuts, Dorian Gregory will not be in the 8th season of Charmed, and Brian Krause's Leo will only be a recurring character.

7.29.05 - While the past seven seasons of Charmed have aired on a Canadian television network, none of the Canadian networks are currently planning on airing the 8th season, and Canadians are sad. If you are Canadian and would like to see the 8th season, or if you're not Canadian and want to help out sad Canadians, check out this petition.

7.26.05 - Sex and the City stud Jason Lewis is joining Charmed this season as a "new romantic interest for love interest for Alyssa Milano." He replaces Mark McGrath, whose demanding Extra responsibilities precluded his addition to the cast.

It's less than three hours later and Phillips is chatting with reporters at a Television Critics Association press tour network party as the newest star of UPN's fall comedy "Love, Inc."

6.10.05 - TV Guide: Charmed Star Spells Out Secrets

by Daniel R. Coleridge

The task of bewitching TV viewers isn't always easy for the sexy sorceresses of Charmed. Take one scene in the seventh-season finale, when Holly Marie Combs, Rose McGowan and Alyssa Milano visited a vampiress' bat cave and zapped the hell out of her flock of flying critters. Those biting bats, of course, were courtesy of computerized special effects added in after the scene was shot.

"When we're all swatting at imaginary bats, it looks silly," Combs tells TVGuide.com, grinning. "There's no way to look cool doing that. It takes getting used to. You have to use your imagination and be very humble, because you are gonna look like an idiot, and you just have to accept the fact that, unfortunately, the more ridiculous you look, the more convincing it is on the screen."

It is fortunate that the show's trio of TV witches get to spend at least one more year feeling silly at work, since Charmed has been renewed for an eighth season. "The [WB] network owes it to us to let us wrap the series properly," Combs says. "I don't feel like the story has ended yet. There's so much we haven't done!"

Of course, Combs and Co. will never be done receiving fan attention  both the good and bad kinds  long after the series wraps its run.

"Many a person on the street [has asked] me if I can really freeze things or blow them up," Combs chuckles. "I'm like, 'No, no, let's not go there. Let's separate [television from] reality.' It's a kooky show, so there are some kooky folk who like it.

"It's sad, though, because some children are afraid of me, which is not good," she sighs. "I've turned into so many evil things on the show that they're not sure what to make of me. There are some parents who let their little, little kids watch the show, which I don't condone. Because you never know when it's gonna get too violent, gory or bloody. You never know with us!"

6.5.05 - E!Online asked Alyssa Milano what her guilty pleasure was, and she answered: "A guilty pleasure, to me, is something you smell and it makes your mouth water. You know you shouldn't indulge, but you do anyway. My favorite guilty pleasure is chocolate peanut butter cups."

6.5.05 - The latest news is that the second season will be released on DVD on September 6th, 2005.

5.26.05 - Shannen Doherty has been dropped as the star of the new fall sitcom Love, Inc. Although she was at UPN's upfront presentation in New York last week, UPN says "Shannen is a terrific actress, but we're going in a different creative direction with the show." An industry source says Doherty was a casualty of bad research, adding, "Preview audiences were not responding to her." The role will be recast.

5.20.05 - From TV Guide Online: Charmed Trio Avoids Fan "Outrage"

by Daniel R. Coleridge

When WB unveiled its fall sked on Tuesday, the Frog net confirmed it had renewed Charmed for an eighth season. What's more, former rock star and Extra talking head Mark McGrath will come aboard as a series regular. No word yet whether he'll play naughty or nice (or if he can act), so we won't wrap our heads around that one right now. Before the conclusion of the two-part season finale, "Something Wicca This Way Goes" (the conclusion airs Sunday at 8 pm/ET), TVGuide.com touched base with each of the three Charmed sisters in separate interviews for a glimpse into their past, present and future.

TVGuide.com: Would you have been happy if the two-part season finale were also the series finale?

Holly Marie Combs: I think there's more things for the characters to do. There's so much we haven't done yet! I could be dead wrong and I have been before. But personally, I'm not done yet! [Laughs] I'm pretty sure that this ending [wouldn't] satisfy our hardcore fans.

Alyssa Milano: None of it's wrapped up! I think at the end of a series, the most important thing is to take care of what the fans want to see. They've dedicated so much time and energy to find us, no matter what night we are on and have followed us for seven years. I think the fans would like Phoebe to settle down and find a love like she experienced with Cole, but obviously not with a demon.

TVG: What would the fan reaction have been to cancelation?

Combs: [Smiles] Outrage!

TVG: It's crazy how Charmed was kept on the bubble. You might have gotten a quicker renewal if the show were retitled Desperate Housewitches.

Rose McGowan: That seems to be the craze right now, but there's only one sister married [on the show], so I don't know how that would work. We'd all have to get married!

TVG: Alyssa, you'd be Wysterical on Wisteria Lane! You'd fit in.

Milano: Everyone thinks I should play Teri Hatcher's little sister. I get that a lot. I don't think I'd commit to it for a long engagement, but I'd definitely do a story arc on that show. If Charmed were to wrap, I [would] not make any set plans. I'm just going to spend a year traveling and doing other things. We work sometimes 85 hours a week, so it doesn't leave a lot of room for self-exploration.

TVG: Rose, you could give Nicollette Sheridan a run for her money as the neighborhood tramp.

McGowan: [Smirks] Thank you for calling me a tramp. I appreciate that. Why would I play a tramp exactly? What if I play a lady in a burlap sack? I'm not typecast. [Chuckles] Listen, you whore, look up tramp in the dictionary. That is not a flattering term. I could play the saucy bitch. How's that?

TVG: Speaking of... er, divas, let's put the perennial fan question to rest. Is Shannen Doherty ever coming back?

Milano: I don't think so. I think when she left the show, she alienated everybody. I don't think they would bring her back.

McGowan: I've actually met Shannen a couple of times and I liked her very much. She was extremely nice. Again, I wasn't here [when she left]. I don't know what the hell happened.

TVG: How hard was it for you to fit in, Rose? Does everyone really get along?

McGowan: It was a bit of an adjustment at first, but it's fine. This is a dysfunctional family. I've come to love these people, and it [has been] kind of messing with me that I might not see them anymore. Don't get me wrong, I'd be over it in two days! Just kidding.

5.18.05 - Charmed has been renewed for an eighth season and will remain on Sundays at 8pm ET.

4.29.05 - Brian Krause is the writer, director and star of "The Mission," an upcoming indie film in which he plays Jackie Zeman's (General Hospital) stalker.

4.12.05 - Shannen Doherty has signed on to star in a new show on UPN called Wingwoman, about a matchmatker who helps guys find their soul mates.

3.17.05 - It looks like the second season of Charmed will be released on DVD sometime in August, 2005.

1.24.05 - E!Online Fashion Police: Rose McGowan does a little garden partying at the WB/In Style Golden Globes bash in a sexy 'n' sweet chiffon floral-print one-shoulder gown with a bustle effect. We're totally charmed by this pale beauty, even though her hair looks like it got caught in a spring shower. Need some help pruning those petunias?

1.24.05 - Julian McMahon has agreed to return to Charmed for the show's 150th episode this April. He'll reprise his role as Phoebe's half-demon ex, Cole. "As busy as he is, as crazy as he is, and as big a star as he's become, it's just a testament to his graciousness that he would honor the fans and come back," says executive producer Brad Kern.

12.16.04 - Brad Grey Television has received a script commitment with penalty from Fox for a comedy project starring Nick Lachey portraying a retired pro baseball player coming home to his dysfunctional family, per Variety. Etan Cohen will write and exec prod.

12.15.04 - The Hollywood Reporter says that Rose McGowan is in negotiations to play Ann-Margret, Elvis Presley's costar in the 1964 film Viva Las Vegas, in CBS's upcoming Elvis miniseries.

11.18.04 - TV Guide Online: Dawson's Stud Leaving Charmed?

by Daniel R. Coleridge

Dawson's Creek graduate Kerr Smith, 32, is a bona fide hit on Charmed (Sundays, 8 pm/PT on WB). In his recurring role as Agent Kyle Brody, he's won over the witchfest's devoted fans by splitting his time between probing occult mysteries and cuddling Rose McGowan's Paige Halliwell. Will this temp go perm and stay long-term? A setside source tells TV Guide Online that Smith's expected to say buh-bye in early 2005. Let's see what the studlet himself has to say....

TV Guide Online: Kerr, you've signed up for 10 episodes of Charmed. [The sixth one airs this Sunday.] Any chance you'll stay as a series regular?

Kerr Smith: They've actually asked me. It's something I would entertain. I love the group and it's a good show. On the other hand, it'd take me out of pilot season; that is usually January through April. It's a very difficult decision because you want to try and get your own show, but then, working on a show as good as theirs is also a really good deal.

TVGO: I don't hear you saying no for sure.

Smith: I guess it's still up in the air. It's a tough decision. I'd love to stay, but you've also got to move forward into the black unknown. Staying in the nice cushy job is not taking a chance.

TVGO: How's life behind the scenes? We've all heard tales of backstage drama.

Smith: You gotta understand, I come from the most amazing crew family on Dawson's Creek. I didn't think I'd ever have that again. [My TV sister] Meredith Monroe and I are still great friends. After getting to know everybody on Charmed, it was unbelievable. They welcomed me right into this friendly atmosphere with great working conditions. It's the kind of job you really don't want to leave  which is why, I'm sure, they've been there for seven years.

TVGO: So Kyle's a federal agent who's into the supernatural. Sounds familiar...

Smith: He's Fox Mulder but he's not as somber. He's more charming. But he is a mysterious FBI agent who's into the supernatural. (Chuckles)

TVGO: At least your sister wasn't abducted by aliens, right?

Smith: No  though you never know with this show.

TVGO: You're romancing Rose McGowan on Charmed. Her ex, Marilyn Manson, must be a tough act to follow.

Smith: (Snickers) A tough one, huh? Let's just keep it at a different act to follow.

TVGO: Ouch! Burn. So tell us more about Rose and Kyle's budding love.

Smith: At first, Rose's character got curious about my character because she didn't know if I'm a demon or an actual agent. Once she found out I'm good, we started working closely together against the big bad threat of this season, the Avatars. We've started to get too close, especially in the '30s noir episode we did in black-and-white last week.

TVGO: Yeah, I wondered about that. Was life actually black-and-white in the '30s?

Smith: Yeah, right. Rose and I got sucked into this magical book that was made by a couple of witches. It was a lot of fun to shoot and looks really cool. You'd think they'd run out of story lines after seven years of this crazy stuff, but they don't!

TVGO: UPN didn't pick up the pilot for Silverlake, another Aaron Spelling series you were to star in.

Smith: We shot it back in the spring. That's a bummer because we thought it would be picked up. It's set in the Silverlake neighborhood of L.A. Dead people came to me for guidance or advice to solve crimes and mysteries or save a loved one who's still alive.

TVGO: Hmm... Sounds suspiciously similar to Fox's Tru Calling.

Smith: It's similar to Tru Calling, but we made ours less serious. (Chuckles) I did say "I see dead people" at one point, but I didn't steal Haley Joel Osment's [style of] line reading.

11.11.04 - Zap2It.com: Kerr Smith is Happy to Be a Grownup on 'Charmed' - After playing a gay teen on The WB's "Dawson's Creek," Kerr Smith is happy to be playing an adult -- and having a different sort of on-screen romance....

10.26.04 - Nick Lachey will guest-star on an upcoming episode of Hope & Faith as a hot single dad who gets majorly crushed on by Kelly Ripa.

10.25.04 - From the October 29th issue of Entertainment Weekly it's Spin-off Zone! (Otherwise known as Ask the Critic, Gillian Flynn.) Are there any television characters/actors you believe could carry a spin-off? Sophie Let me say it, Sophie: I love sassy witches. In particularly, Charmed's Holly Marie Combs. Her sensible mom o' two, Piper Halliwell, is adorably exasperated at all things silly, which would serve her well on "the outside." Should the Charmed formula ever need a tweak, I think Piper could leave her troubled marriage, set up her bar in aother windy city, Chicago, and do the single-mom thing quite amusingly. Think Bewitched's Samantha sans hubby. It's a darrin proposition, but it just might work.

10.7.04 - Nick Lachey, who is currently playing Leslie St. Claire, has signed a development deal with Fox/Brad Grey Television. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the plan is to produce a 30m or 60m series starring Lachey for next season. He currently has a deal with ABC/Touchstone for a pilot shot for the current season that was not picked up, though the option on it does not expire until the end of the calendar year.

9.30.04 - Ted at E!Online reports that, at the premiere of "I Heart Huckabees," he caught a glimpse of a stunning pair of marmalade-colored Jimmy Choos, and looky-see whose feet they were covering--the naughty Charmed gal, Rose McGowan. Asked Marilyn Manson's once-upon-a-time bitch what her everything store would have in stock, and she replied: "Chocolate-chip cookie dough. Being able to stay in the sun without burning. And no war."

9.23.04 - According to The Hollywood Reporter, Nick Lachey has signed on to play an accountant in the indie heist flick "The Hard Easy," also starring David Boreanaz (Angel) and Henry Thomas.

9.10.04 - TV Guide: Reunion for Charmed's Piper and Leo?

Since 2000, former soap stud Brian Krause has played Leo Wyatt, the Halliwell sisters' handyman who became their whitelighter, otherwise known as a guardian angel. Over the years, Krause has played out lotsa drama on the WB witchfest  and we ain't just talkin' about his short-lived off-screen relationship with Alyssa Milano following his divorce. As Leo, he's endured a rocky marriage to that cranky Piper (Holly Marie Combs) that looked finito last season. But there's hope for the supernatural spouses yet in Season 7, which kicks off Sunday night. Read on for the magical details....

TV Guide Online: Leo was promoted last season to an elder whitelighter, wasn't he?

Brian Krause: Right. One of the other elders, Gideon, was bad and I terminated him. So then I made the choice to come back down from the clouds to be more proactive in protecting my children and the charmed ones. I haven't turned my back on the elders, but I keep a warier eye on what's good and what's bad now.

TVGO: Leo and Piper had to split up when he went away.

Krause: Yes. Since I wasn't going to be around and we couldn't be together, I wanted her to live a life free of pain.

TVGO: Did they ever get divorced? Is their marriage even legal since Leo's a heavenly being?

Krause: I don't think there was ever an official divorce  I guess we did. That's one of the things I'm not clear on. [Laughs] I didn't get any papers! I don't think there was a settlement and I don't know how Leo finds money to buy clothes or anything like that. I guess the witches have a trust fund or a good 401K. None of us can use our powers for personal gain, though. We can only protect people.

TVGO: That bites. I'd rather be a bad witch and have fun.

Krause: Then we'd have to vanquish you!

TVGO: I dare you to try. So anyhoo, where does Leo pick up this season?

Krause: I've gone out on my own hunting demons, hunting whoever is after my child and trying to terminate them. I'm no longer following the rules of the elders. I'm kind of making up my own rules now. There's constant attacks against the charmed ones and my son, so I'm trying to stop all that and put an end to all evilness. The nice thing is my character is not so soft anymore. I'm now more badass. I'm not just orbing places or healing people, I can blow stuff up!

TVGO: Leo and Piper are getting back together, right?

Krause: I haven't read that in a script yet, but I would imagine it'll happen. Leo wants to be with Piper and she wants to be with him. And we're around each other more now that I'm not "up there." We were close and intimate one night at the end of last season....

TVGO: Hope Leo doesn't mind that she'd been with other men.

Krause: She went on a couple of dates last year. Leo was pretty jealous  'cause it's his wife! It's not like we broke up because we didn't get along; it was circumstances. I want her to be happy, but no touchy-touchy with other guys!

8.31.04 - Kerr Smith (Dawson's Creek) will be joining the cast of Charmed and will first appear on the show in October. For more information on his role, see the previews page.

8.26.04 - TV Guide Online: Charmed Gets Charisma

Charisma Carpenter is best known from her popular stints as Cordelia Chase on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and its spin-off, Angel. What's she been doing since both vampire shows bit the dust? Last year, she gave birth to son Donovan Charles (who's now 16 months old). Then this June, the 34-year-old Hollywood mom reclaimed her va-va-voom by posing nearly nude in Playboy. She'll continue her hot streak by guest-starring as a sexy seer on Charmed in at least two episodes. (Her first appearance airs Sept. 26.) Last week, TV Guide Online visited the Charmed set to watch Carpenter torment costar Brian Krause (Leo) with her spooky predictions. We also stole some time to dish between scenes.

TV Guide Online: David Boreanaz recently told TV Guide he'd be willing to do Angel feature films, but not TV-movies. Could Cordy make a return from the dead someday?

Charisma Carpenter: I read that snippet about David in TV Guide! You know, I'm not interested. Not because of David or anyone I worked with. I think we're all just done. I don't think my fans should be offended because they're not Angel or Buffy specific. They've proven over time that they'll follow me no matter what I do, so I'm not afraid of taking anything away from them and I hope they wouldn't feel that way.

TVGO: Cordy was psychic on Angel. Now you're a seer. What's up with these ESP roles?

Carpenter: Another psychic! At least I'm not in a coma on this show. They're both sassy girls, but this character is more of a temptress than a smartass. She's toying with Leo.

TVGO: Does your character have a name?

Carpenter: She's just "Seer." We'll see if we see more of her before she gets a name!

TVGO: Might you do more than two episodes?

Carpenter: I'm happy to do more. It would depend on whether my pilot is picked up. I'm thrilled to be here because I have a relationship with Holly Marie Combs (Piper). We did my ABC Family movie See Jane Date together and we're both new moms. It's also interesting to be back doing this supernatural genre. I know it and it's familiar.

TVGO: How about this pilot of yours?

Carpenter: It's a possible midseason replacement sitcom for UPN. It was called Play Nice, but now it's called Like Cats and Dogs. I'm the girl on the show, and it's about my life with my fun-loving brother [played by Canadian actor Tyler Labine]. I'm an uptight lawyer and he comes to live with me and my houseful of dogs.

TVGO: If the sitcom didn't happen, wouldn't it be fun to join Charmed as a regular?

Carpenter: I think working with girls would be great, especially since Holly's a mom and a producer. The only reason I would hesitate is that the shooting schedule of a one-hour drama is a lot for a new mom. It'd be great to work with her, 'cause she gets it. So yeah, I'd definitely be open to talking about it.

TVGO: By the way, many mothers might be envious of your having a baby and then doing Playboy!

Carpenter: That came about because I had a baby and got so bloody fat. I gained 50 pounds. I needed something to motivate me to get my butt in shape. It's vanity, really. Right after I signed the deal with Playboy, I did hard-core training for 20 days.

TVGO: Any hesitation about posing for the lad mag?

Carpenter: It was all very agreeable and they allowed my husband to be on set to make sure everything was cool, and it was. I'm really pleased with the photos and I don't have any regrets. I expect there are people out there who would hope that I would. They may judge me, but I'm not feeling regret right now. I guess I'll cross that bridge with my son when I come to it....

TVGO: You appeared topless, but the photos weren't raunchy.

Carpenter: I felt good about it. I figured if I did films, I'd have to show my breasts at some point. Why not take beautiful pictures for posterity while I'm young?

TVGO: Your midriff-baring outfit on Charmed will be memorable, too!

Carpenter: The Seer's like a jezebel. Women on Charmed have to look hot. That's the sense I'm getting. Every single one of [the witches] are notoriously sexy women!

Alyssa Milano

by Timothy White/WB

4.30.04 - From TV Guide Online: Alyssa Milano's Charmed Future

Playing the same TV character for six years can get a little boring. Unless you're Alyssa Milano. As Phoebe Halliwell on the WB's Charmed, Milano's gone through more than enough costume and personality changes to keep the magic alive for her. "When you're a little girl and you're in this business, which I was at 7 years old, that's what it's all about  playing dress-up," Milano says. The witchy woman  who has turned into a mermaid, a mummy and the Queen of the Underworld, just to name a few  really spices things up on Sunday, when she goes undercover as a dominatrix assassin. TV Guide Online asked Milano to borrow Phoebe's premonitory powers to foretell the future of Charmed.

TV Guide Online: Charmed was recently renewed for its seventh season. Will that be the last one?

Alyssa Milano: We're all contracted for eight years. But I think we all feel like we want to go out on top. So if our ratings are as strong as they are this year, we'll probably go for an eighth season. And if it starts to slip, we'd all decide to end after the seventh season. It's a tricky thing to know when the right time to end a show is.

TVGO: A lot of shows are struggling with that now. What do you want for Phoebe before the show ends?

Milano: She's been through so much with love that, clearly, I'd love some sort of storyline where she's in a stable relationship. And that's so much fun for me to play, as far as just the romantic-comedy stuff. We did an episode this year where we saw Phoebe's future, and she was pregnant, so I don't know what they're going to do with that. Although I would not be looking forward to wearing that weird latex belly. Holly Marie Combs wore that belly and it was stinky! It didn't matter what you had on as far as perfume or clothes on top of it  you could smell it a mile away.

TVGO: Are there any shows that have wrapped up in a way that you think really worked well?

Milano: When you watch a show and you get so invested in the characters and the people, I think it's really important to end a show how the audience wants it to be ended. Tie up all the loose ends. It's kind of like the reward for the fans for sticking in there as long as they have. Who's the Boss? is a perfect example of it not ending the way it should have  because everyone wanted Tony and Angela to get married and they never did. And I think that's taking something away from the fans who have invested so much time and energy into caring about these people.

TVGO: What do you think Charmed fans would like to see?

Milano: I think definitely Piper and Leo being back together. I know that they're really invested in that relationship. They all wish Cole, my demon boyfriend [played by Nip/Tuck's Julian McMahon], would come back, too. But I don't think that's going to happen, since he's busy on his own show now.

TVGO: How will you spend your hiatus from the show?

Milano: I will be taking my first field trip as a UNICEF ambassador. We're going to Angola. [I'll be doing] everything from vaccinating children to rallying kids to get back in school.

TVGO: How did you get involved with that?

Milano: I contacted them about six months ago, when I took a trip to South Africa. I lived there for three months and did a lot of humanitarian work in children's hospitals and townships. When I got back to the States, I started volunteering in a children's hospital and I needed to find an outlet. UNICEF just seemed to be the way to go after much research. I contacted them and they were happy, and now, I'm happy.

TVGO: And now for your obligatory Shannen Doherty question. Do you ever look over your shoulder worrying Shannen might pull a Scare Tactics trick on you?

Milano: [Laughing] That's funny. No, but I have had the fear of being Punk'd!

TVGO: Paging Ashton Kutcher...

4.19.04 - E!Online Fashion Police - Ho Down: Rose McGowan turns tricks at the Glamour Magazine "Don't" party in Hollywood. Bet Rosie dug deep in her closet for this call girlie getup: pink tube top, satin ruched mini, faux Vuitton bag and pink wooden platforms.

3.9.04 - Okay, so it's a little early, but someone has already created a petition to keep Charmed on the air for an 8th season (it's already been renewed for next season, its 7th).

2.20.04 - Holly Marie Combs, 7 months pregnant, married her boyfriend, David Donoho, on Valentine's Day. From their press release:

The couple eloped to the San Ysidro Ranch in Montecito, CA. "We're both kind of shy about saying our vows in front of a large group of people," says Combs. "We decided to make it about our commitment to our new family," says Donoho. To make it about their new family, the couple decided to create elements of their celebration that forge traditions they can pass down to their son. A good example was the urns and pedestals used at the altar area. Having a green thumb herself, Combs asked her floral designer to use containers that she could take home and incorporate into her garden. "I especially like the idea of filling the urns with flowers on our anniversary. We will definitely be using them as focal points for the larger reception we plan to have after the baby is born." Combs also ditched the idea of saving the top tier of the wedding cake to eat on their first year anniversary and opted to start her own tradition by adorning the top tier of their cake with "cake jewelry" from www.ParisTiaras.com. Theirs is a tiara styled as a birdcage strewn with enamel flowers complete with a set of lovebirds. Combs says "We'll use it year after year on anniversary and other celebratory cakes." Donoho, on the other hand, has his own thoughts on Holly's new cake tradition: "I hope Holly doesn't plan to bake the cake on our anniversaries. I love her, but her baking isn't exactly good eatin'."

The wedding gifts were also in the spirit of forging new traditions. The Milano family gave the couple a silver wedding cake plateau engraved with their wedding date and the famous Beatles quote: "And in the end...the love you take...is equal to the love you make." Their gift included inspiration about how the plateau could be engraved with the date and occasion each time it is used; on birthdays, anniversaries, holidays, etc.

Considering all the excitement surrounding the baby, it's a wonder any wedding plans were hatched at all. With the help of author and expert wedding planner Allana Baroni, floral designer Jennifer McGarigle of Floral Art in Venice, CA and the superb staff of the San Ysidro Ranch, it came off not only "sans hitch" but also as the perfect reflection of the excitement Holly and Dave radiate about their new life together. "Their enthusiasm was permeable," says McGarigle. "Holly's love for fragrant flowers was the basis for the floral décor." The urns at the altar area were filled with Tuberose blossoms, Narcissis, champagne to blush colored roses, antique green Hydrangea with accents of white Cymbidium Orchids. "Her bouquet was intoxicating, it left a trail of perfume as it passed by; the gardenias and garden roses were the most beautiful I've ever seen," said their wedding photographer. When Donoho was asked about his thoughts on the flowers he said, "I couldn't take my eyes off the person carrying the flowers." Baroni summd it up best when she said, "It's true what they say about brides being beautiful, and when you add the glow expectant moms emanate, Dave was overwhelmed the moment he saw Holly."

2.10.04 - Charmed has been officially picked up by the WB for a 7th season.

2.7.04 - Zap2It.com: Keeping the Magic Alive on 'Charmed' - With "The Lord of the Rings" straddling the movie world with its wildly successful trilogy, and "Harry Potter" looking to do the same, there would seem to be no better time than now for fantasy on the big screen.

On the small screen though, fantasy generally has had a tougher time than its genre siblings -- horror and science fiction. It's fine to have mythical creatures and magic, as long as you toss in a few vampires or put everyone on an alien planet.

The exception to this is The WB's "Charmed," the supernatural drama about three sister witches battling evil in San Francisco. It survived the departure of one of its original stars, Shannen Doherty (successfully replaced with Rose McGowan), and has managed to keep its audience despite a variety of time slots and nights....

Best BS-er: "Are you bulls--ting me? You are! Well, this is a good place to bulls--t people," Julian McMahon said after I told him on the red carpet I had predicted Nip/Tuck to win that night. (I later got a kick out of watching Finola Hughes, host of the Style Network's How Do I Look?, playfully razzing J.M. for not remembering her from her stint on Charmed. D'oh!)

OK, this is a pretty common occurrence in The WB's magical drama "Charmed," but what sets this fight apart is that the prize is not some bizarre orb or talisman or amulet. Drawn from a stone sitting in the house's garden conservatory, it is none other than the most famous of all swords -- Excalibur....

10.30.03 - Charmed sorceress Holly Marie Combs reveals in the next issue of TV Guide magazine (on sale Monday) that she is expecting her first child with longtime boyfriend David Donoho in April. For more on how the character of Piper is going to deal with this, see the previews page.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the former 90210/Charmed hellraiser has inked a deal with NBC to star in a sitcom about a "young woman who is stuck with a rep of being headstrong and nasty but is nice and fragile at heart." Okay, so it's loosely based on Doherty's life.

"It is funny that nobody mentions that Alyssa Milano was a child star, because she landed on her feet," he says. "She's doing great, cute girl, works  and there is no story. We want to see the guy from, like, Three Dog Night sleeping in an alley, finding his teeth on the ground, because they fell out of his head."

The actress exposed nearly all in those revealing photos in Maxim and FHM, but thankfully, there's more to Milano than cleavage and barely-there tankinis. As the bewitching babe of WB's Charmed (1998-present), Milano creates an enchanting blend of sensuality and silliness that spills over into those kittenish 1-800-Collect commercials. We'll gladly accept her call.

10.11.02 - From the October 5th issue of TV Guide: It's not easy pretending to be pregnant on TV.

Now he's at it again with Holly Marie Combs of WB's Charmed, whose character will start showing in January. But why can't he just recycle Aniston's stomach?

5.18.01 - TV Guide Online: Charmed Casts More Than a Spell - Now that churlish Charmed enchantress Shannen Doherty has hung up her pointy black hat, every wannabe Wiccan in Hollywood is reciting incantations in hopes that she will be picked to round out the coven...

5.16.01 - The WB and TNT are currently in talks to share Charmed, Gilmore Girls, Felicity, and the WB's latest, Smallville. If the deal goes through, TNT would air each show within seven days of its original broadcast on the WB. In addition, TNT would air the shows at 10pm, so as not to compete with the any of the WB's primetime line-up.

5.16.01 - From TV Guide Online: After the WB's fall schedule presentation to advertisers Tuesday in New York, co-president Susanne Daniels said "while Shannen will no doubt be missed, we are confident that [producer] Aaron Spelling will work his casting magic... and take the series to another level." Daniels went on to announce that the network has renewed the witch drama for three more seasons. A source close to the show tells TV Guide Online that Spelling is seeking "a big name" to replace the former Beverly Hills 90210 troublemaker. Meanwhile, the New York Daily News reports that Doherty left Charmed as the result of a simmering feud with co-stars Alyssa Milano and Holly Marie Combs.

5.15.01 - The WB's official Fall Schedule was announced today, and Charmed is definitely keeping its Thursday 9pm ET time slot, and Shannen Doherty is definitely not returning for the fourth season.

5.14.01 - According to the WB's Fall Schedule advance copy, Charmed, without Shannen Doherty, has been renewed for two more seasons and will be returning next season in the Thursday, 9pm ET time slot. The official announcement will be made sometime tomorrow.

5.12.01 - It's official! According to The Hollywood Reporter, Shannen Doherty is leaving Charmed. "We have had a long and prosperous relationship with Shannen and we didn't want to hold her back from what she wanted to do," the show's producer, Spelling TV, said. "We wish her all the best and much continued success."

5.10.01 - This week's Soap Opera Weekly interviews Executive Producer Brad Kern in an effort to confirm the rumors behind Alyssa's said departure from the series in her on-the-set battles with co-star Shannen Doherty. "Nothing I've been told from the people that I work for indicates whatsoever that anybody's leaving the show," Kern says of the rumor that Milano wants off and that her character will be killed. "Alyssa and Shannen are professionals. Are they best friends? No. Do they have to be? No. Do they work well together? Yeah. They're sisters in character only. They come in and do their job well. That's all that matters to us."

Kern goes on to say that he does have a quibble with the WB Network in the fact that because Charmed is one of their number 1 shows, they virtually spend hardly any money for promoting it. Instead, they spend all of their available funds promoting their struggling shows in an effort to build them up. (Ex. This season, the now defunct Grosse Pointe was one of the highest promoted WB series and is no longer on The WB's current schedule.) However, Kern feels if The WB claims there are no funds left to promote their more successful shows, how does that explain it's mega-promotion of 7th Heaven, Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Dawson's Creek? He claims he can never get a straight answer from The Wb when they are asked.

At the time of the interview all the way through SOW's press time, Charmed had not been renewed for a 4th season by the WB.

5.1.01 - Yesterday, Shannen Doherty pleaded no contest to drunk-driving charges stemming from a December arrest in which her truck was pulled over for allegedly weaving across a Southern California highway. Doherty stood silent in a Ventura, California, courtroom after changing her plea from innocent a month ago, to no contest Monday. She's due back in Ventura County Superior Court June 12th for sentencing, where she could face up to six months in jail for the two misdemeanor DUI charges. Prosecutors also chalked up a "special enhancement" against Doherty because she refused to take a breathalyzer test or blood test after she was stopped along the Ventura Freeway. Ian Morse, deputy District Attorney for Ventura County, says it's unlikely Doherty will get the full six-month sentence. A more common punishment would be either three years' probation and 48 hours in jail, or five days in work-release (aka roadside trash pickup detail). "She faces more than that because of the special allegation, but that's up to the judge," Morse added.

4.30.01 - Wanda at E!Online verifies that Alyssa Milano and Brian Krause are dating. Brian and his wife split in December, and he has been dating Alyssa for the past couple of months. They're apparently adorable together, very cutesy-wutesy, but the whole thing has deepened the divide between Alyssa and her onscreen siblings, who've been turning yet another shade of green.

4.27.01 - Zap2It.com: Buffy's Gone, but The WB is Still Charmed - Generally lost somewhere in the shuffle of last week's announcement about "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" moving from The WB to UPN next season is the fact that, while widely acknowledged as the network's signature show, "Buffy" is not its number-one show -- or even its number two....

4.18.01 - Zap2It.com: Producer Not So Charmed with the WB - It's been over four months since producer Brad Kern first voiced displeasure about his show not getting any respect from the WB....

4.18.01 - Gossip has it that Alyssa Milano and Brian Krause are dating, despite Brian's wife and young child. It has been reported in the National Enquirer, as well as some equally reputable foreign magazines, but more interestingly, it has been confirmed by Alyssa's manager/mom on the discussion board of Alyssa's official site at SafeSearching.com. Stay tuned for more news as it becomes available.

3.27.01 - Shannen Doherty pled innocent on Friday to a drunk-driving charge incurred after cops pulled her over on a Southern Calif. highway in Dec. Authorities alleged that the actress was weaving sporadically between lanes, then refused to take a Breathalyzer test. A judge has scheduled an April 30 trial date.

2.28.01 - E! Online's Wanda reports that things are getting really ugly on the set of "Charmed." Doherty acts like a primadonna all the time, demanding the best clothes and to be in the middle of all the publicity shots, and Milano is sick of it and threatening to leave. Meanwhile, Combs has managed to pretty much stay out of it.

2.6.01 - Wanda at E!Online reports that there is definitely something a-brewin' regarding the rumors about Alyssa Milano leaving the show. A source close to the set has told her that there is some not-so-charming tension between Alyssa and her onscreen sibs. Apparently it's stemming from jealousy over better storylines and Shannen's more expensive wardrobe, which is full of Chloe and Versace and has created a few budget problems.

2.6.01 - Wanda at E!Online reports that Alyssa Milano is not pregnant. The added poundage (and for the record, Wanda thinks she looks more healthy this way) can be attributed to her quitting smoking a few months ago. (Note from TK: I didn't even notice!)

Scott Wolf ("Party of Five") voices the title role, in an adventure full of songs in which Scamp takes up with the stray Junkyard Dogs, and falls for a stray named Angel (Alyssa Milano), who the Junkyard Dogs' leader (Chazz Palminteri) also has his eyes on. SCAMP also features the voices of Jodi Benson, Jeff Bennett, Cathy Moriarty, Bronson Pinchot, Mickey Rooney, and Bill Fagerbakke. (Hmm, interesting since Scott Wolf and Alyssa Milano used to be engaged.)
