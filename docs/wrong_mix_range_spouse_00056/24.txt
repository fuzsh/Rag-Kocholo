Charmed actress Rose McGowan has announced that she is engaged to boyfriend Davey Detail.

The pair - who began dating last year - confirmed yesterday (July 22) that they are to be married.

Rumours started to circulate last week when McGowan was pictured wearing a ring on her engagement finger, and her rep has now confirmed to E! News that she is "happily engaged".

The actress tweeted following the announcement: "Thanks all for your good wishes!"

McGowan has been engaged twice before but never married. She was famously set to wed Marilyn Manson in 2001 and more recently was engaged to director Robert Rodriguez until 2009.

The 39-year-old is most famous for her role in supernatural drama Charmed, which she starred in with Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano between 2001 and 2006 until the show was cancelled by The WB network.
