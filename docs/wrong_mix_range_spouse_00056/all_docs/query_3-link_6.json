        "text": "It's hard to believe that 20 years have passed since \"Charmed\" first aired on our television screens in 1998. When the show ended in 2006, our lives were a little less magical. Now, 12 years later, a \"Charmed\" reboot is hitting TV screens on Oct. 14, 2018. Join Wonderwall.com as we take a look back at the stars of the original spellbinding series — which featured three powerful sisters who used magic to save the world from the forces of evil — to see how they've changed over the years. Keep reading to catch up on Rose McGowan, Alyssa Milano, Holly Marie Combs and more actors from \"Charmed\"…\n\nRELATED: \"The Lost Boys\" actors: Where are they now?\n\nThe youngest of the Charmed Ones was Paige Matthews, played by Rose McGowan. She was half White Lighter and half witch but didn't know about her powers until she was reunited with her sisters in 2001.\n\nRELATED: Celebs who had unusual childhoods\n\nRose McGowan has managed to stay busy in Hollywood since \"Charmed\" wound down in 2006. She starred in \"Grindhouse\" (and got engaged to its director, Robert Rodriguez, though their romance ended in 2009), appeared on TV's \"Nip/Tuck\" and \"Chosen\" and lent her voice to several video games including \"Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare.\" In 2015, Rose shocked fans by shaving her head, which she claimed was to remove the \"sex target\" on her back. In early 2016, the controversial star — who once famously dated Marilyn Manson — filed to divorce her husband of two years, artist Davey Detail. She's been in a relationship with non-binary model Rain Dove since July 2018. In January 2018, Rose released the memoir \"Brave,\" in which she discusses her alleged assault at the hands of now-disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein. A vocal advocate and supporter of the #MeToo movement, Rose — one of the first actresses to speak out against Harvey in late 2017 — also appeared in the four-part documentary series \"Citizen Rose\" in 2018.\n\nRELATED: Most controversial TV reboots\n\nGood guy Det. Darryl Morris, played by Dorian Gregory, had an uneasy alliance with the Charmed Ones but ultimately decided he couldn't compromise his police oath by assisting the witches.\n\nWhen Dorian Gregory left \"Charmed\" in 2005, he stayed low-key, appearing as supporting characters on episodes of many TV series including \"Las Vegas,\" \"Without a Trace\" and \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" Most recently, the actor appeared in the 2017 thriller \"The Lurking Man\" and the 2018 rom-com \"When It Comes Around.\" Throughout it all, he's been open about living with type 1 diabetes, a diagnosis he received when he was just 9 years old.\n\nKaley Cuoco starred as Billie Jenkins on the final season of \"Charmed.\" Billie's impulsive nature and determination to save her sister caused a lot of problems for the Charmed Ones.\n\nKaley Cuoco didn't have much trouble finding a new home once her run on the final season of \"Charmed\" came to an end. In 2007, Kaley landed the role of Penny on \"The Big Bang Theory,\" which has earned her numerous nominations and several awards, including a People's Choice Award for favorite comedic TV actress. (She's now also, along with her \"Big Bang\" co-stars, among the highest paid actors on television.) After \"TBBT\" ends its long run in 2019, Kaley will be focusing on her new production company, Yes, Norman Productions, and her voice role as Harley Quinn on the new eponymous DC Comics web series. In 2013, Kaley married former tennis pro Ryan Sweeting, but their union only lasted 21 months. In 2016, the couple finalized their divorce, which Kaley reportedly attributed to Ryan's dependency on prescription painkillers. In June 2018, the devoted dog lover married Karl Cook, a fellow equestrian who's the son of Scott Cook, the billionaire Intuit software co-founder.\n\nTed King played Det. Andy Trudeau, the former high school sweetheart of Prue Halliwell (Shannen Doherty). He learned about the sisters' secret powers and died trying to protect them.\n\nAfter leaving the show, Ted King had small parts in several films and TV series until landing a regular role as Lorenzo Alcazar on \"General Hospital.\" After leaving the daytime soap, Ted spent a season on \"Prison Break\" and later joined the cast of \"One Life to Live.\" In 2017, Ted appeared in the romantic drama \"Love at First Glance\" and in 2018, he appears in the HBO movie \"My Dinner with Hervé.\" In 2008, he married Maya Rodwell. The couple share two children, including daughter Ava Celeste.\n\nWhile Finola Hughes wasn't the biggest star on \"Charmed,\" her importance on the show was undeniable. As the Charmed Ones' mom, Patty Halliwell, she offered her daughters a tether to understanding their powers and themselves, even if it meant communicating with them from the afterlife.\n\nThankfully for Finola Hughes, after \"Charmed\" ended, she had no trouble finding work as she was (and still is) starring on the daytime soap opera \"General Hospital.\" She also appeared in \"All My Children,\" \"How Do I Look?,\" and \"Beware the Batman.\" Finola and husband Russell Young are parents to three children: Dylan Joseph, Cash Justice and Sadie Beatrice.\n\nBrian Krause starred as Leo Wyatt and quickly became our favorite White Lighter, sworn to protect the Charmed Ones. When he wound up falling in love with Piper, the duo started one of the greatest television romances of all time.\n\nNow that Brian Krause has moved on from \"Charmed,\" he's enjoying a career that's far more thrilling thanks to regular roles in TV horror flicks. The actor, who once dated co-star Alyssa Milano, appeared in numerous scary movies like \"Be Afraid\" and \"The Killing Pact\" in 2017 and has already completed several scary films for 2018, like \"Cucuy: The Boogeyman\" and \"The Demonologist.\" He also appeared on the 2018 TV series \"First List.\" He shares one son, Jamen Krause, with ex-wife Beth Bruce.\n\nOne of the strongest characters on \"Charmed\" was no doubt Piper, played by Holly Marie Combs, the middle sister who was forced to lead the Charmed Ones when oldest sister Prue (Shannen Doherty) died.\n\nWhen \"Charmed\" ended in 2006, Holly Marie Combs didn't rush into a new gig. After appearing in just a few under-the-radar projects, Holly was cast on the hit series \"Pretty Little Liars,\" on which she starred for seven years. While we don't know what Holly is working on next, we do know the \"Charmed\" reboot isn't on her list, thanks to a tweet where she slammed the upcoming revival. Holly and second husband David Donoho, a former key grip on the original show, welcomed their second and third children not long after \"Charmed\" aired its finale. She filed for divorce in 2011 and is now engaged to her longtime boyfriend, Mike.\n\nHandsome Greg Vaughan might have only lasted a season on \"Charmed\" as handsome neighbor Dan Gordon, but his romance with Piper (played by Holly Marie Combs) wasn't easily forgotten. Sadly, he was wished away from the series when Piper realized she was still in love with her White Lighter, Leo.\n\nGreg Vaughan quickly found a new home on TV in the world of daytime soaps. First in 2002 on \"The Young and the Restless,\" followed by six long years on \"General Hospital\" beginning in 2003. In 2012, Greg landed on \"Days of Our Lives,\" where he currently stars as Eric Brady. Greg also took on a recurring role on the Oprah Winfrey Network drama \"Queen Sugar\" in 2016. In 2014, the actor announced he was divorcing wife Touriya Haoud after eight years together. The couple share three sons.\n\nJennifer Rhodes (right, with Rose McGowan and Alyssa Milano) played lovable (and at times, deceptive) grandmother Penny Halliwell, whose main mission was to keep her granddaughters, the Charmed Ones, safe.\n\nAfter the show ended, Jennifer Rhodes, who has a history in Hollywood going all the way back to 1971, found numerous small roles on shows like \"Gilmore Girls\" and \"The Young and the Restless.\" In 2017, the talented star and animal rights activist (whose Twitter bio hilariously states she's an \"actress waiting to be discovered but they need to hurry\") appeared on an episode of the TV drama \"Famous in Love\" alongside Bella Thorne. In 2018, she appeared on episodes of \"Major Crimes\" and \"Kaplan's Korner.\"\n\nDrew Fuller (center) played the shifty and suspicious Chris Halliwell, who no one could trust. Once the Charmed Ones learned (spoiler alert!) that the mysterious new arrival was actually Piper and Leo's son from the future, it was easy to love him.\n\nSince leaving \"Charmed,\" Drew Fuller has appeared on several series and TV movies, most notably \"Army Wives\" as PFC Trevor LeBlanc. In 2017, Drew starred in \"A Bunch of Dicks\" and the Spanish-language film \"Beyond Brotherhood (Mas Que Hermanos).\" In 2018, he appeared on the TV series \"All Wrong.\" While it's anyone's guess if Drew is dating (or even married), we do know he has a passion for world travel thanks to his Instagram account, which features pictures from his trips to places like Japan and France.\n\nShannen Doherty starred as Prue Halliwell, the oldest of three magical sisters. At the end of Season 3, amid rumors of difficulties with other cast members, Prue was killed off.\n\nAfter departing \"Charmed,\" Shannen Doherty — also a former \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" star — quickly landed new gigs including parts on \"North Shore\" and, later, the 2008 reboot series \"90210.\" In 2010, she was the first celebrity to be eliminated when she competed on \"Dancing With the Stars.\" In 2015, Shannen was diagnosed with breast cancer and shared her journey to recovery with the world. After learning her cancer had spread, Shannen committed herself to a rigorous treatment plan that included chemotherapy and a mastectomy. In March 2017, she shared the wonderful news that her cancer had gone into remission. In 2018, Shannen was set to star in a TV adaptation of \"Heathers,\" but the show was pulled after the tragic shooting at Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Next up, fans can catch her in \"No One Would Tell\" and \"MallBrats.\" Shannen has been married to photographer Kurt Iswarienko since 2011.\n\nWhether he was playing Belthazor the demon or Cole, the man helplessly in love with witch Phoebe (played by Alyssa Milano), Julian McMahon was the TV bad boy we couldn't get enough of.\n\nEven before Julian McMahon's departure from \"Charmed,\" the handsome star picked up a leading role on the long-running series \"Nip/Tuck,\" which ended in 2010. Since then, he's appeared in numerous movies and TV shows including \"Red,\" \"Justice in a Smoking Gun\" and \"Flammable Children\" — the latter of which was filmed in his native Australia. In 2018, he began starring on the Marvel Hulu series \"The Runaways.\" In 2015, Julian — who counts both Aussie pop star Dannii Minogue and \"Baywatch\" alum Brooke Burns as ex-wives — married his girlfriend of 11 years, model Kelly Paniagua.\n\nBy far one of the most beloved sisters among the Charmed Ones was Phoebe Halliwell, played by Alyssa Milano. Phoebe had an infectious free spirit, hopeless optimism and naiveté that made her sometimes impulsive decisions forgivable.\n\nAfter \"Charmed\" came to an end, former \"Who's the Boss?\" star Alyssa Milano took on numerous TV movie roles and several supporting parts on series like \"My Name is Earl\" and \"Mistresses.\" In 2016, the vocal advocate for nursing moms — who in 2009 married talent agent David Bugliari, with whom she has two kids — made headlines when she got into a heated argument with daytime TV talk show host Wendy Williams as she defended women's right to breastfeed in public. In 2017, her activism drew even more attention as she helped to reignite the #MeToo movement on social media in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sexual misconduct scandal. Alyssa's latest projects are the Netflix original series \"Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later\" and \"Insatiable.\"\n\nAlthough brief, Eric Dane's appearance as Jason Dean (seen here with Alyssa Milano) fueled one of the juiciest storylines on the fifth season of \"Charmed.\" While their love seemed like the real deal, once Jason realized Phoebe was a witch, he couldn't find it in his heart to move forward with their romance.\n\nThankfully, Eric Dane's departure from \"Charmed\" didn't keep him off the screen for long. He showed up on several TV shows — including \"Private Practice\" and \"Grey's Anatomy,\" where he was nicknamed \"McSteamy\" — and in the 2006 action flick \"X-Men: The Last Stand.\" In 2017, production of Eric's latest TV show, \"The Last Ship,\" was halted as he revealed he was battling depression. Eric — a father of two who split from his wife of 14 years, actress Rebecca Gayheart, in early 2018, returned to the \"Last Ship\" in 2018. He's next slated to appear on the HBO series \"Euphoria\" alongside Zendaya."
