        "text": "While nuanced and sensitive non-essentialist theorisations of Chicano identity have been put forward by key critics working in the field, these same critics still struggle, on occasion, to disentangle themselves from having recourse to essentialist arguments in their own work. The case that I examine here constitutes a prime example of this problem within Chicano critical discourse. It concerns the debates, in Chicano intellectual circles, over definitions of 'Chicano cinema', focalised via an examination of a film that has provoked a quite particular polemic in this respect: non-Chicana director Allison Anders's Mi vida loca / My Crazy Life (1994). My discussion of Anders's film will centre on its reception with a range of professional film critics, mostly Chicana/os, as well as reports on the reaction of a sample group of the film's subjects – Chicana gang members – to their representation on screen. It will examine the factors at play in the way it has been received, and expose evidence of recursive essentialism in such arguments where apparent.\n\nThis text is a reflection of the realization of the dreams of those more than eight million Americans of Hispanic origin, which include all the legal Mexican immigrant population, and displayed less real situation of many men and women of Hispanic origin in illegal or integration process in the U.S. Thus, we will focus on Chicano cinema, social cinema and Hollywood cinema, and finally deal with the presence of Hispanic culture in some mythical movies in cinema history. We study how specific social and cultural problems posed by Mexican immigration in the United States is addressed in the film written, directed and produced by Hispanics and other filmmakers of the Hollywood industry. Moreover we revise how Hispanics get involved in the industry: especially to three groups: first, the actors because they often play the role of Hispanic, or to see what role is given both social and starring (if it is considered a hero or a villain, and see what social level holds), second, the directors and third, the producers.\n\n*Please read the final version in the 'New Review of Film and Television Studies' http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17400300410001679089 There is also a less formal, downloadable version of much the same material in the 'Talks' section. In an era when the institutional agenda of contemporary Hollywood cinema is increasingly dependent on policies of textual recycling (sequels, remakes, adaptations), it is nonetheless noticeable that one means of injecting big-budget productions with a sense of novelty or 'cult' cachet is the assignment of an auteur director from a non-studio background. The 'values' circulating around concepts both of the auteur and of the blockbuster event movie are challenged in this encounter, especially as notions of mass taste vs. independent or art house sensibilities come into play. This paper will use a case study of Ang Lee's comic-book adaptation The Hulk (2003) to explore how such productions expose the category of the auteur to the commercial logic of the blockbuster. By juxtaposing 'official' (promotional, critical) and 'unofficial' discourses (such as fan writing), recent modifications to the notion of authorship in popular cinema will be assessed."
