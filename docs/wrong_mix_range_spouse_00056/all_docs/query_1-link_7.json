        "text": "Rose McGowan portrayed Paige Matthews in season 4 to 8 of Charmed after the departure of Shannen Doherty at the end of season 3.\n\nShe also portrayed Paige's past life, the Evil Enchantress in Season 4, as well as the various characters that have impersonated her, including Phoebe Halliwell, Margo Stillman, Zachary and Patra.\n\nPersonal life\n\nRose McGowan was born on September 5, 1973 in Florence Italy, to Terri, an American writer of French descent, and Irish-born Daniel McGowan, an artist. She is the second-oldest of six children (plus two half-siblings). Daniel McGowan ran an Italian chapter of the Children of God to which both he and his wife held membership until 1978. McGowan spent her early childhood amid the group's communes, often traveling Europe with her parents. Through her father's art contacts in Italy, McGowan became a child model and appeared in Vogue Bambini and various other Italian magazines. Her parents returned to the United States when she was 10, when they divorced. She subsequently relocated to Oregon and then to Gig Harbor, Washington, where she also met childhood friend Rey-Phillip Santos. McGowan did not speak English until she moved to the U.S.\n\nMcGowan's formative years were spent with her father in Seattle, Washington, attending Roosevelt High School and Nova Alternative High School. At the age of 15, she officially emancipated herself from her parents. McGowan pursued a career in the film industry during her late teens while enrolled in a beauty school as a back-up. She currently lives in Los Angeles, California. McGowan made her debut appearance in American comedy \"Encino Man\" in 1992. Since then she has appeared in several films and television programs; her most famous role being Paige Matthews on the hit WB TV series \"Charmed\". She is also widely known as the ex-girlfriend of infamous shock-rocker/ goth musician Marilyn Manson.\n\nIn early 2008 Rose McGowan was in a car accident, the impact from the crash caused one of the temple arms of her glasses to slice into her face. Rose was afraid she might lose her eye, but a plastic surgeon fixed her face, hence a significant change in appearance compared to her time on Charmed.\n\nShe was in a very public 3½-year relationship with rock musician Marilyn Manson. After a formal engagement lasting two years, McGowan ended the relationship over \"lifestyle differences\".\n\nPrior to the release of Grindhouse, there was speculation that McGowan was dating director Robert Rodriguez. In May 2007, it was reported that they confirmed their relationship while appearing hand-in-hand at the Cannes Film Festival. On October 12, 2007 it was announced by Zap2it.com that McGowan was engaged to Rodriguez. They planned to wed in 2009, but reportedly split on October 2, 2009.\n\nAfter one year of dating, Rose became engaged to artist Davey Detail in July 2013. They two were married on October 12, 2013 in Los Angeles. In February 2016, Rose filed for divorce from Detail, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce would later become finalized later on that November. Rose has also openly stated that she has had an abortion in the past, and has also had \"relationships\" with women.\n\nOn October 8, 2016, Rose was spotted holding hands with an American record producer named Jordy Asher, who is professionally known as Boots. After under a month of rumors and questions, on November 1, 2016, Rose confirmed via Instagram that she is in a romantic relationship with Jordy. Jordy also posted a confirmation of the relationship on his Instagram. The two have been dating ever since.\n\nRose is also a female-rights activist, and frequently attends rally's, protests, and marches in support of this and many other causes. She is most known for her attendance at and involvement with the Women's March which took place in DC.\n\nRose On Charmed\n\nAbout her time on Charmed, Rose stated: \"There are huge positives and huge negatives to doing a TV series: I don't like to think of all the movie roles I missed, but it was really interesting to follow a character over a period of time. My character was the youngest sister, so I kind of played her like a baby Lucille Ball, but she's also a bit of a schmuck, who you feel sorry for but still think is kind of hot.\"[1]\n\nAfter the conclusion of Charmed Rose said: \"Well, getting up late is so much more my style, so that's been fantastic. But it is very strange to have to give up what was the kind of family that I never really had growing up. The people on the show know more about me than my best friends at the time did. I miss that a lot, actually. I thought about that a couple of times and definitely teared up. It taught me how to work and function in a family, and how if you have problems with somebody not to just run away. And I kind of wound up playing my off-screen character on the set as well—I filled the role of the person who makes everybody laugh, so they all think I'm this goofy person. Once I stepped into that I couldn't break out of it. I guess I am funny and goofy, but not all the time. I felt like it was my job to make everybody happy. I felt like the weird middle child.\"[1]\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nEncino Man (1992)\n\nThe Doom Generation (1995)\n\nBio Dome (1996)\n\nKiss & Tell (1996)\n\nScream (1996)\n\nGoing All the Way (1997)\n\nSeed (1997)\n\nNowhere (1997)\n\nLewis and Clark and George (1997)\n\nSouthie (1998)\n\nPhantoms (1998)\n\nDevil in the Flesh (1998)\n\nJawbreaker (1999)\n\nSleeping Beauties (1999)\n\nReady to Rumble (2000)\n\nThe Last Stop (2000)\n\nStrange Hearts (2001)\n\nMonkeybone (2001)\n\nStealing Bess (2002)\n\nThe Black Dahlia (2006)\n\nGrindhouse: Planet Terror (2007)\n\nGrindhouse: Death Proof (2008)\n\nFifty Dead Men Walking (2008)\n\nMachete (2010)\n\nDead Awake (2010)\n\nThe Pastor's Wife (2011)\n\nConan the Barbarian (2011)\n\nRosewood Lane (2011)\n\nNapa (2012)\n\nThe Tell-Tale Heart (2012)\n\nThe Sound (2017)\n\nLower Bay (2017)\n\nTelevision\n\nTrue Colors (1990)\n\nComa White (1999)\n\nWhat About Joan?

I got socked in the face because someone thought I was a lesbian, and I woke up in the parking lot. But this isn't even an eighth of the things that happened to me.\"\n\nShe prefers gay and lesbian clubs, where the music's better and no one's going to hit on her.

I don't know if that would be their worst or my worst but I felt badly.\"\n\nHer favorite Charmed episodes are \"The Power of Three Blondes\" and \"Charmed Noir\" and least favorite \"Oh My Goddess!\"; \"Because the outfits were awful. We look Greek, first of all, so I look like I'm wearing a toga. Secondly, I just didn't like it.\" She also disliked \"Nymphs Just Wanna Have Fun\".\n\nIs a fan of Nicole Richie. \"Paris Hilton is very sweet but Nicole Richie, she seems one pancake short of a stack. She's become my hero.\"\n\nConsiders Julianne Moore a hero of hers. \"When I get depressed and I'm stuck in a certain place, I think about how she busted out in her very late thirties.

She isn't a fan of the cold weather – or all the snobs: \"I just hate it, I can't bear it. I find it to be as small-minded as any other small-minded town. I don't really understand it, but I do love it here and I love my car and driving really fast.\"\n\nShe gets up to 120 mph on the freeway in her BMW M5, and she admits to following ambulances, but she's never been ticketed for speeding. \"I'm good friends with the police chief.\"\n\nBefore going to bed she watches Cold Case Files or City Confidential and during the day, its Dr Phil. \"I'm not kidding, I love some Dr Phil.

It was idyllic.\"\n\nLoathes Oregon, particularly the little town of Noti.\n\nIs close to her family these days and her siblings are all extremely accomplished (an aeronautical engineer, a biochemical engineer, a fighter pilot, an artist...). \"It was sink or swim for us,\" she explains. When comparing herself to her siblings, she says she calls herself the dumb actress. \"That's the hardest thing to deal with, that I do nothing that uses my brain.\"\n\nThe day she arrived in Los Angeles, at age 19, she learned that her boyfriend, who had just moved there, had been murdered.\n\nWas very close to Johnny Ramone, who died of cancer in 2004. \"He's one of the loves of my life.\"\n\nHer favorite website is cuteoverload.com.\n\nUsed to always carry a Polaroid camera with her but eventually got bored with it and moved on.\n\nOnce jumped out of a cake on Marilyn Manson's birthday.\n\nMarilyn Manson painted her portrait.

There was a reference to this in the episode House Call when the TV was blown up and Paige said, \"Well, I guess I won't be watching The Osbournes tonight\".\n\nOut of the four actresses who play one of the Charmed Ones she is the only one to appear and actually star in a blockbuster horror movie franchise (i.e. Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street or Psycho).
