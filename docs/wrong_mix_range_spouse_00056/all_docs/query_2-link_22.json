        "text": "Bruce Willis had a pretty great 2012, all things considered. There were disappointments, to be sure: ill-conceived Henry Cavill vehicle “The Cold Light Of Day,” Stephen Frears‘ tone-deaf “Lay The Favorite,” a brief role in “The Expendables 2” and a straight-to-video picture called “Fire With Fire” alongside Josh Duhamel. But those weaknesses were certainly overshadowed by his far more visible strengths, with the actor giving two of his best performances in years, in Wes Anderson‘s “Moonrise Kingdom” and Rian Johnson‘s “Looper,” the latter of which Willis has described as the best film he’s ever been in.\n\nTo some degree, his 2013 is looking far less promising, with three not-especially-exciting action movie sequels in “A Good Day To Die Hard,” “G.I. Joe: Retaliation” and “Red 2.” But Willis has managed to squeeze out some room in his schedule for a fourth picture, and it’s a happier prospect, as director Robert Rodriguez has revealed to MTV (via Latino Review) that Willis will be reprising his role as disgraced cop Hartigan in “Sin City: A Dame To Kill For,” the sequel to the 2005 graphic novel adaptation “Sin City.”\n\nAs you might recall, Willis played Hartigan, a good cop framed up for a series of child murders who breaks out of prison in order to save the girl, Nancy (Jessica Alba) who he already saved once before. You might remember that Willis seemingly passed away at the end of the film, but with the story “Just Another Saturday Night” — which centers on Mickey Rourke‘s Marv and what he was doing while Hartigan met up with Nancy in “That Yellow Bastard” — confirmed to be adapted, Willis’ inclusion here makes sense."
