Included are such notables as Johannes Kepler, Blaise Pascal, Michael Faraday, Gregor Mendel, and George Washington Carver.\n\nThis book offers irrefutable evidence of the historic link between the Christian faith and the advancement of science through the centuries. Scientists of Faith is an excellent resource for apologetics and science studies\n\nAuthor:\n\nDan Graves recieved his undergraduate degree from John Wesley College and a M.S. in Library Science from Western Michigan University. An avid, life-long reader, Graves became interested in the topic of apologetics from reading C.S. Lewis and Francis Schaeffer, which led to a focus on the personal histories of various scientists of the faith. To find more of his writing, visit dsgraves.com."
