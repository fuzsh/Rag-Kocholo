        "text": "Welcome to Into the Wardrobe!\n\nI am delighted to have been asked by John, the creator of this excellent website, to write a few words of introduction. For those who have no idea about C. S. Lewis and his work, and are just looking for a fun site, there is plenty to investigate and enjoy right here, and what you find here may well lead you into years of enjoyable reading as you discover the existence of one of the finest writers of this century, and find out about his books.\n\nOn the other hand, for those who are already fascinated by Jack (C. S. Lewis' nickname) and his \"Narnian Chronicles,\" or other works, and want to know more about him and his world, you can almost be there yourself by wandering through this site's various links. There is much here of worth to the serious scholar too, and if you are about to embark on a paper about Jack or his works I heartily recommend this site as a research source.\n\nVery best wishes to you, no matter who you are or what your reason for being here. I hope you enjoy your time inside this very large wardrobe.\n\n— Douglas Gresham (stepson of C. S. Lewis)"
