        "text": "C. S. Lewis’s Lost Aeneid: Arms and the exile\n\nA. T. Reyes\n\nYale University Press £18.99\n\n(978-0-300-16717-7)\n\nChurch Times Bookshop £17.10\n\nREADING this book felt like a privileged insight into the mind of an exceptional Christian writer. C. S. Lewis’s translations of parts of the Aeneid are published here for the first time, with the original Latin on the facing page (a real bonus). It would have been exciting enough only to be reading Lewis’s translations from Virgil. But one factor changed the feel of the reading experience — seeing the actual handwriting of the man himself.\n\nEven those who scoff at the so-called science of graphology would surely agree that handwriting gives some kind of basic insight into personality. Users of Wainwright’s guides to the Lake District would surely agree. I once preached on a relic of the actual handwriting of Francis of Assisi, and after it a medic admitted to me that he had sought out letters of William Harvey, who discovered the circulation of the blood, and had touched his finger to the signature in a moment of communion between the genera­tions.\n\nThe book reproduces some pages from Lewis’s original notebooks, showing not only his remarkably clear hand in ink, but also his pencil corrections. The translation is in English alexandrines — in other words, a six-beat line — rather than the more familiar English five-beat line. Poetic fashions of his day made Lewis defensive about using archaic language, but his feel for the right word was so studied as to seem instinctive. He excelled in com­municating the story, its grandeur and pathos, while keeping much of the idiom of the Latin.\n\nMy only serious grumble is that there is too much of a poetic feature called “synizesis” — the syncopation of a word to “swallow” a syllable in pronunciation and make the words fit the metre. Choristers regularly sing “Spirit” as “Sprit”, or “heaven” as “heav’n”. Lewis takes this to ex­tremes. Some examples have a natural enough feel — “sev’n”; “pow’rs”; “mis’ry”, etc. Others are much less convincing: “perilous”, “venison”, “echoing”, “ignorant”, “ruinous”, “journeying”, “treachery”, all as two-syllable words, is pushing your poetic luck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne last note: I almost misjudged what is in fact an excellent set of versions of Virgil on the very first page, judging Lewis’s poetry at fault for what turned out to be egregious editorial error. The printed text gives us the metrically impossible “and proved in war; still endeavour­ing in our soil to place”. The line luckily occurs in one of the sections for which Lewis’s own writing is repro­duced. Comparison reveals that he originally wrote in ink (with rhyth­mic precision), “and proved in war; still striving in our soil to place”. Then he had second thoughts, crossed out “still striving”, and sub­stituted the metrically equivalent “endeav’ring”. The word “still”, though crossed out in Lewis’s note­book, has crept back into the printed version. Finding this clanger left me unsure whether other examples of questionable rhythm were the fault of Lewis himself or his transcriber."
