        "text": "An Instance of the Fingerpost\n\nBy Iain Pears,\n\nFrom my list on science-based historical fiction novels.\n\nBy Robert J. Lloyd Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI write as Robert J. Lloyd, but my friends call me Rob. Having studied Fine Art at a BA degree level (starting as a landscape painter but becoming a sculpture/photography/installation/performance generalist), I then moved to writing. During my MA degree in The History of Ideas, I happened to read Robert Hooke’s diary, detailing the life and experiments of this extraordinary and fascinating man. My MA thesis and my Hooke & Hunt series of historical thrillers are all about him. I’m fascinated by early science, which was the initial ‘pull’ into writing these stories, but the political background of the times (The Popish Plot and the Exclusion Crisis, for example) is just as enticing.\n\nRobert's book list on science-based historical fiction novels\n\nWhy did Robert love this book?\n\nThis is the only ‘whodunnit’ on my list, but it’s so much more. (As are all the best ‘whodunnits’.)\n\nFor a start, it’s told from four different points of view. My own books use the early history of the Royal Society, its science, and various of its actual ‘Fellows,’ and this book was undeniably an influence. Pears details the politics and religious turmoil of the time and the excitement of new scientific discoveries.\n\nThe mid-17th century’s rigid social structure and manners are shown starkly, as is the misogyny. I found it dark, layered, and although complex, it’s immediately engaging. A very satisfying book indeed!\n\nBy Iain Pears,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n5 authors picked An Instance of the Fingerpost as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n'A fictional tour de force which combines erudition with mystery' PD James\n\nSet in Oxford in the 1660s - a time and place of great intellectual, religious, scientific and political ferment - this remarkable novel centres around a young woman, Sarah Blundy, who stands accused of the murder of Robert Grove, a fellow of New College. Four witnesses describe the events surrounding his death: Marco da Cola, a Venetian Catholic intent on claiming credit for the invention of blood transfusion;Jack Prescott, the son of a supposed traitor to the Royalist cause, determined to vindicate his father; John Wallis, chief cryptographer…\n\nPreview\n\nA Thousand Splendid Suns\n\nBy Khaled Hosseini,\n\nFrom my list on historical fiction about overcoming loss.\n\nBy Anthea T. Piscarik Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nMy favorite genre, historical fiction, inserts characters into real-life events. As a former news reporter, I enjoyed doing research when communicating factual information to readers. I love learning about different time periods and coming away with a fresh perspective on times gone by. History is subjective and always revised and revisited, but factual dates and occurrences remain the same. All the stories I chose to review reveal how fictionalized characters, in real events, deal with coming out on the other side of loss or pain with a stronger spirit. None of us escape loss. It’s inevitable. But there’s healing over time and trust in a God that loves us beyond expectations.\n\nAnthea's book list on historical fiction about overcoming loss\n\nWhy did Anthea love this book?\n\nI cried at the conclusion of this book. I cried because I cared so deeply for the women I met on their journeys. And I cried to release the anguish I felt from their rejection, constriction, and subjugation to arranged marriages.\n\nI’m so very grateful for a book written by an Afghan with a clear-eyed perspective of his culture and sensitivity to the tyranny of suppression, especially for women treated as unequal to men. But there’s so much more to this book; it is an homage to courage, resilience, and, ultimately, love, namely, a mother’s self-sacrificing love. The characters conquer despair and limited freedoms with enduring hope.\n\nBy Khaled Hosseini,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n7 authors picked A Thousand Splendid Suns as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nTHE RICHARD & JUDY NUMBER ONE BESTSELLER\n\n'A suspenseful epic' Daily Telegraph\n\n'A triumph' Financial Times\n\n'Heartbreaking' Mail on Sunday\n\n'Deeply moving' Sunday Times\n\nMariam is only fifteen when she is sent to Kabul to marry Rasheed.

Ball,\n\nFrom my list on demonstrating the fallout of religious conflict.\n\nBy Marthese Fenech Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nFrequent visits to my parents’ Maltese homeland from the time I was very young piqued my interest in the island’s opulent history. Life under the rule of the Knights of St John fascinated me most. The Maltese Islands lend themselves very well to literary descriptions—gifted with four compass points of natural beauty, the smell of the sea constant no matter how far inland one might venture, ancient temples that predate the pyramids of Egypt. It was during a pre-college trip to Malta in July 2000 that the idea to write a novel based on the Siege of 1565 took root, thanks to a visit to the Malta Experience in Valletta.\n\nMarthese's book list on demonstrating the fallout of religious conflict\n\nWhy did Marthese love this book?\n\nEmpires of Sand embodies the grandest tradition of historical fiction—an epic, intricate tale that sweeps from European chateaus to North African dunes. In the late nineteenth century, the French Empire stands on the precipice of collapse and attempts to colonize the Sahara. Cultures collide, the consequences deadly. Cousins Moussa and Paul are raised as brothers in Paris until harrowing events separate them, and they find themselves on opposing sides as battle lines are drawn. I read this novel at a measured pace, partly to absorb the nuances of every scene, partly because I did not want it to end. Empires of Sand captivated me to the point that I missed subway stops during my commute. I reread passages to ingrain them in my mind. David Ball’s mesmerizing, poetic prose serves as evidence that he truly views the world with wonder. The sands of the Sahara beckoned as the story unfolded—so…\n\nBy David W.

Set in the 1990s during the war, The Cellist of Sarajevo plunges the reader into the perspectives of three characters trying to survive ineffable violence in a city crippled by fear. A shell kills twenty-two civilians standing in a bread line. A cellist risks his life to sit in the crater forged by the mortar and play Albinoni’s Adagio once a day for twenty-two days. This novel demonstrates how dehumanization is used as a means to justify killing those on opposing sides. I visited the region a few years ago, and during a drive across Bosnia to visit Međugorje, a sense of deep sadness struck. The fallout of the war remains visible—weariness etched in people’s faces, bullet-riddled apartment blocks. But the sadness did make some room for hope.

My father died in a mining accident when I was five, leaving my mother with seven children to raise on her own. We didn't have much money or many opportunities, but every two weeks the bookmobile brought the universe to me.\" As a writer of children's books, I was immediately intrigued when I ran across an obscure reference to Mary Lemist Titcomb, credited with being the inventor of the bookmobile in America--and I knew at once that I had to write about her.\n\nSharlee's book list on libraries and librarians\n\nWhy did Sharlee love this book?\n\nMy grandchildren love this story about a loveable lion who shows up one day at Miss Merriweather’s library.

For the past three decades, much of that interest has focused on understanding the ecology of wolves who inhabit a wilderness island in Lake Superior, North America. I also work to improve the relationship between humans and wolves–knowing very well that wolves are a symbol to so many of all that we love and fear about nature. As a distinguished professor at Michigan Technological University, I teach classes in population ecology and environmental ethics. What ties my interests together is the desire to gain insights from the commingling of science and ethics.\n\nJohn's book list on wild animals and the people who observe them\n\nWhy did John love this book?\n\nThis book is motivated by the global uproar over the killing of Cecil, an African lion, by an American trophy hunter. The author is the researcher who made it his purpose to learn about lions from Cecil’s life and about humans’ relationships with lions through Cecil’s death.\n\nI love the book for demonstrating the power that is unleashed when we care enough to name a wild animal, and that caring is reinforced by subsequently discovering that they have story-filled lives. The book warmed my heart when I found the book’s author–who has the felt responsibility and privilege of telling these stories–to be as lion-hearted as Cecil.\n\nBy Andew Loveridge,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Lion Hearted as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n“Until the lion has its own storyteller, tales of the lion hunt will always glorify the hunter.” —Zimbabwean proverb\n\nIn 2015, an American hunter named Walter Palmer shot and killed a lion named Cecil. The lion was one of dozens slain each year in Zimbabwe, which legally licenses the hunting of big cats. But Cecil’s death sparked unprecedented global outrage, igniting thousands of media reports about the peculiar circumstances surrounding this hunt. At the center of the controversy was Dr. Andrew Loveridge, the zoologist who had studied Cecil for eight years. In Lion Hearted, Loveridge pieces together, for the first…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Lion Who Stole My Arm (Heroes of the Wild)\n\nBy Nicola Davies,\n\nWhy did Janelle love this book?\n\nI know, the title sounds like a downer, especially for kids, but the book is full of new learning, acceptance, and even dealing with revenge. I loved it. And since the title already gives away the scary moment, your young reader doesn’t have to feel nervous.\n\nThe story, which takes place in Africa, is simple and powerful and even though the moment of loss is alarming and sad, the story doesn’t slide into sentimentality. In the end, Pedru, the main character, is able to put away his need for revenge and ultimately embrace lion conservation. The book transported me to Africa and lion country. It made me think, too, about hard forgiveness. The best kids’ books are ones that intrigue us as adults. Nailed.\n\nBy Nicola Davies,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Lion Who Stole My Arm (Heroes of the Wild) as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.

Lewis, Pauline Baynes (illustrator),\n\nWhy did John love this book?\n\nHonestly, I love any book written by C.S. Lewis, but this is probably the first book of his I remember ever reading–and I have read it many times throughout my life. It’s a great story, as part of the 6-book series from Lewis’s Chronicles of Narnia collection, with all kinds of Christian symbolism buried throughout the storyline.\n\nAnd even without considering the Christian references, it is simply storytelling at its best. I never get tired of reading this book (nor the entire collection), and the movie recreations from the mid-to-late 2000s do a good job of bringing the books to life on the big screen.\n\nBy C. S. Lewis, Pauline Baynes (illustrator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n30 authors picked The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.

She's stumbled upon the magical world of Narnia, land of unicorns, centaurs, fauns... and the wicked White Witch, who terrorises all. Lucy soon realises that Narnia, and in particular Aslan, the great Lion, needs her help if the country's creatures are ever going to be free again...\n\nPreview"
