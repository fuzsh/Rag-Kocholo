        "text": "Title/Author Description\n\nDiscovering the Old Testament\n\nAlec Motyer\n\nDr Alec Motyer is a well-known Bible expositor and from an early age has had a love for studying God’s Word. He was formerly principal of Trinity College, Bristol.\n\nWhy I Trust the Bible\n\nAmy Orr Ewing\n\n‘You don’t honestly believe all that stuff in the Bible!’ Challenged by her friends, and later as a student by theological staff, Amy Orr–Ewing was determined to leave no stone unturned in her eagerness to prove that the Bible was unique and wholly reliable.\n\nFaith Under Fire\n\nAndrew White\n\nAuthor of the Vicar of Baghdad Andrew White’s perspective on faith and hope. How does he keep going, and what does he say to God?\n\nMy Journey so Far\n\nAndrew White\n\nAs Vicar of St George’s Baghdad, the only Anglican church in Iraq, he leads a team providing food, health care, and education on a major scale and often in dire circumstances. Despite the pain from multiple sclerosis, he has nevertheless been able to mediate between opposing extremes. He is frequently involved in hostage negotiations, and played a key role in ending the siege at the Church of the Nativity in Jerusalem.\n\nMud Sweat and Tears\n\nBear Grylls\n\nAs a Christian, Bear tells the story of his action-packed life. Gripping, moving and wildly exhilarating, Mud, Sweat and Tears is a must-read for adrenalin junkies and armchair adventurers alike.\n\nGod’s Smuggler\n\nBrother Andrew\n\nThe book GOD’S SMUGGLER tells the story of the start of his work, smuggling Bibles into communist countries illegally during the Cold War, which developed into the worldwide ministry now called Open Doors International.\n\nThe Hiding Place\n\nCorrie ten Boom\n\nAs the Nazi madness swept across Europe, a quiet watchmaker’s family in Holland risked everything for the sake of others, and for the love of Christ. Despite the danger and threat of discovery, the ten Boom family courageously offered shelter to persecuted Jews during the Nazi occupation of Holland. Then a trap brought about the family’s arrest. Could God’s love shine through, even in Ravensbruck?\n\nMere Christianity\n\nCS Lewis\n\nThe book brings together C.S. Lewis’s legendary radio broadcasts during the war years, in which he set out simply to ‘explain and defend the belief that has been common to nearly all Christians at all times’.\n\nThe Screwtape Letters\n\nCS Lewis\n\nThis book takes the form of a series of letters from Screwtape, a devil high in the Infernal Civil Service, to his nephew Wormwood, a junior colleague engaged in his first mission on earth trying to secure the damnation of a young man who has just become a Christian.\n\nI Believe in the Historical Jesus\n\nI. Howard Marshall\n\nFew would deny that a person named Jesus lived and died during the first century of this era. Yet opinions differ widely as to the reliability of the New Testament record of his life. In I Believe in the Historical Jesus, Marshall surveys the quest for the historical Jesus from the 19th century to the present, examines the methods used to extract historical information from the gospels, and investigates the role faith plays in a study of the life of Jesus.\n\nKeep in Step with the Spirit\n\nJ.I. Packer\n\nOne of Christianity’s greatest scholars makes the person and power of the Holy Spirit accessible to all who strive for a closer walk with God.\n\nChasing the Dragon\n\nJackie Pullinger\n\nOne woman’s struggle against the darkness of Hong Kong’s drug dens. Until it was pulled down, the Walled City was Hong Kong’s most foreboding territory. It was a lawless place, dominated by the Triads, and which the police hesitated to enter. Yet, as she spoke of Jesus Christ, brutal Triad gangsters were converted, prostitutes quit, and Jackie discovered a new treatment for drug addiction: baptism in the Holy Spirit.\n\nChristianity: Grace at our Core\n\nJohn Dimmock\n\nFor most people, our Christain walk has become a mess. We work to be a better Christian. We are either consumed, striving to pelase God or dejected from our poor performance. Do we get up and pray for two hours at 4 am every day? Do we read the Bible cover to cover every week? Or do we spend more time with Facebook than God? This book is offered as a reminder for us to focus on what it means to be a Christian and to keep Grace at our Core.\n\nFree ebook download\n\nGunning for God\n\nJohn Lennox\n\nJohn Lennox points out some of the fallacies in the New Atheist approach, arguing that their irrational and unscientific methodology leaves them guilty of the very obstinate foolishness they criticise in dogmatic religious folks. Gunning for God packs some debilitating punches. However, it also puts forward new ideas about the nature of God and Christianity that will give Dawkins’ best friends and worst enemies alike some stimulating food for thought.\n\nSoul Keeping\n\nJohn Ortberg\n\nIn Soul Keeping, John Ortberg helps Christians rediscover their soul–the best connection to God there is\n\nWho is this Man?\n\nJohn Ortberg\n\nOn the eve of his crucifixion it seemed like Jesus’ influence on the world had ended. On the contrary, it had just begun. In Who Is This Man?, Ortberg reveals how Jesus has impacted civilization and individual human hearts.\n\nThe Living Church\n\nJohn Stott\n\nThe Living Church brings together a number of characteristics of what the author calls ‘authentic’ or ‘living’ church. The marks, being clearly biblical, are timeless and need to be preserved.\n\nRadical Disciple\n\nJohn Stott\n\nJohn Stott looks at eight characteristics of Christian discipleship, which are commonly neglected.\n\nThe Cross of Christ\n\nJohn Stott\n\nThe universal symbol of the Christian faith is neither a crib nor a manger, but a gruesome cross. Yet many people are unclear about its meaning, and cannot understand why Christ had to die. In this book, John Stott explains the significance of Christ’s cross and answers the objections commonly brought against biblical teaching on the atonement.\n\nPower Evangelism\n\nJohn Wimber\n\nWe are living in a time when God is powerfully refreshing, renewing, healing and equipping his Church through his Spirit. Now, more than ever, we need to know how Christians can become more effective in evangelism. How can we see the Spirit of God work in power?\n\nThe Church in the Power of the Spirit\n\nKeswick Year Book 2006\n\nSelection of talks and seminars from the annual christian conference\n\nUnshackled?\n\nKeswick Year Book 2007\n\nSelection of talks and seminars from the annual christian conference\n\nCreation, Chaos and Christ\n\nKeswick Year Book 2008\n\nSelection of talks and seminars from the annual christian conference\n\nFaith that Works\n\nKeswick Year Book 2009\n\nSelection of talks and seminars from the annual christian conference\n\nThe Glory of the Gospel\n\nKeswick YearBook 2005\n\nSelection of talks and seminars from the annual christian conference\n\nThe Case for Faith\n\nLee Strobel\n\nA Journalist Investigates the Toughest Objections to Christianity is a non-fiction book by Lee Strobel, a former Atheist turned Christian who uses the book to examine a number of critical questions that he feels limit a person’s capacity to embrace Christianity\n\nThe Case for Christ\n\nLee Strobel\n\nA Journalist’s Personal Investigation of the Evidence for Jesus. Lee Strobel cross-examines a dozen experts regarding the evidence for Jesus of Nazareth.\n\nJoseph the Hidden Hand of God\n\nLiam Goligher\n\nJoseph occupies a crucial role in the Bible’s drama of redemption. Ultimately Joseph’s story is about God’s intention to save, not just Joseph’s family, but bringing through Judah a saviour for the world.\n\nCafé Theology\n\nMichael Lloyd\n\nMichael Lloyd’s Café Theology is a kind of introductory textbook to the core doctrines of the faith, aimed at those who want to go deeper. There are ten chapters, covering the great doctrines in a traditional credal shape (beginning with creation and fall, and ending with the final victory of God and the Church).\n\nWhere is God When it Hurts\n\nPhilip Yancey\n\nThis book discusses pain–physical, emotional, and spiritual–and helps us understand why we suffer from it and how to cope with our own and that of others. Using examples from the Bible as well as the author’s personal experiences, the book speaks to everyone for whom life sometimes doesn’t make sense\n\nSoul Survivor\n\nPhilip Yancey\n\nPhilip Yancey looks closer at those whose lives radiate spiritual authenticity rather than pious posturing. From Dostoevsky to Martin Luther King, G. K. Chesterton to Paul Brand, Yancey pays homage to some of the most remarkable, selfless, Christ-like lives our world has known,\n\nWhat’s so Amazing About Grace\n\nPhilip Yancey\n\nThis book is an insightful exploration of grace, the most powerful force in the universe and our only hope for love and forgiveness\n\nThe Invisible Hand\n\nRC Sproul\n\nIn this book, Dr. R.C. Sproul covers all aspects of divine providence and reasserts the fact that God is concerned with each detail in the universe.\n\nMoney Sex and Power\n\nRichard Foster\n\nRichard J. Foster guides the reader in day-to-day ethical decision making, while helping each of us determine the proper place in Christian life of money, sex and power.\n\nTortured for Christ\n\nRichard Wurmbrand\n\nThis classic story of amazing faith in shocking circumstances has been updated for a new generation. Its message remains urgent and relevant: thousands of Christians are still persecuted and tortured around the world today, suffering solely for their belief in Jesus Christ.\n\nGetting Your Kids Through Church\n\nRob Parsons\n\nHow to raise kids with a healthy view of Christians, the church, themselves and God.\n\nTotal Forgiveness\n\nRT Kendall\n\nAnyone who wants to experience all of God’s blessings must forgive others–totally forgive them. This best-selling author, former minister of Westminster Chapel, explains that forgiveness is as spectacular as any miracle.\n\nFor What its Worth\n\nSimon Guillebaud\n\nA highly challenging call to respond with our whole hearts to Christ. To follow our Saviour is not about being nice. It’s about taking risks.\n\nThe Reason for God\n\nTim Keller\n\nTim Keller explains how faith in a Christian God is a soundly rational belief, held by many thoughtful people today.\n\nThe Prodigal Prophet\n\nTim Keller\n\nMost people, even those who are nonreligious, are familiar with the book of Jonah: a rebellious prophet defies God and is swallowed by a whale. Less familiar to most people is the second half of this Biblical story–what happens after Jonah is released from the belly of the fish. Yet it is in this second half of the story that one of the most powerful and important lessons of the Bible is hidden.\n\nPrayer\n\nTim Keller\n\nChristians are taught that prayer is the main way to experience God. But aside from learning prayers by rote, few receive guidance in how to make the most of this essential Christian act. In Prayer, renowned pastor Timothy Keller shows us how to make prayer genuinely meaningful.\n\nThe Forgotten Father\n\nTom Smail\n\nThis highlights the relationship at the heart of Christianity, that of the Son and the Father. In particular the critical importance of this to Jesus and the distinctiveness of this among other religions is emphasised.\n\nDistinctives – Dare to be Different\n\nVaughan Roberts\n\nIn a fresh and readable style, Vaughan Roberts issues a challenging call to Christians to live out their faith. We should be different from the world around us – Christians distinctives should set us apart in how we live, think, act and speak.\n\nTrue Worship\n\nVaughan Roberts\n\nThis book challenges us to worship God every day of the week, with all our heart, mind, soul and strength.\n\nGod’s Big Picture\n\nVaughan Roberts\n\nTracing the story-line of the Bible\n\nWe Need To Talk About Race\n\nBen Lindsay\n\nChristianity has been dubbed the white man’s religion, yet the Bible speaks of an impartial God and shows us a diverse body of believers. It’s time for the Church to start talking about race. Ben Lindsay offers eye-opening insights into the black religious experience, challenging the status quo in white majority churches."
