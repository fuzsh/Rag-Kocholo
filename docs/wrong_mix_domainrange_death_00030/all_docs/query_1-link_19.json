        "text": "Writer CS Lewis has been honoured with a memorial stone in Westminster Abbey later, 50 years after his death.\n\nThe stone has been placed in Poets' Corner, alongside renowned literary figures including Chaucer and Dickens.\n\nFormer Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams - a fan of his work - gave the main address at the ceremony.\n\nLewis, born in 1898, is best known for the Chronicles of Narnia series, which has sold 100 million copies worldwide and been adapted for screen and stage.\n\nHis other work includes The Screwtape Letters and the Ransom Trilogy novels.\n\nThe writer was also a respected Oxford scholar and literary critic, while his book Mere Christianity was adapted from a series of BBC radio broadcasts, which sought to explain Christian teachings to a wider audience."
