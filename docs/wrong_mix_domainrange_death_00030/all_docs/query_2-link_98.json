        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nA Quite Unexpected Theatre\n\nWHEN I WAS YOUNG, I certainly had no intention of working in the Middle East. I remember when I was ten telling my teacher I wanted to work in anaesthetics and be a priest. She told me I could only do one thing and I was a Baptist and they didn’t have priests. I had already read my first book on anaesthetics – I was a very strange child – and by the time I had finished my schooling seven years later my one desire was to go to St Thomas’ Hospital in London and train as an ‘operating department practitioner’.\n\nAnd so I did, and I loved every minute of it. I had no desire ever to leave the medical world – to me it proved to be more wonderful than I had even imagined. But then, late one night, while I was on call for cardiac arrests, I went to pray in the hospital grounds, looking across the river Thames towards Big Ben. I had only recently qualified and I remember thanking God for all he had enabled me to achieve – passing my exams with distinction and getting the job I had always wanted at the hospital I’d always wanted to work at. I thought I should ask what I ought to do next – I hoped the Almighty would want me to just carry on with what I was doing. To my utter amazement, however, I felt very clearly that I was being called to go into the church – in fact, the Church of England.\n\nI had no wish to be ordained, but I went to see Sir Nicholas Rivett-Carnac, the vicar of St Mark’s, Kennington, the Anglican church that, like many of the hospital staff, I attended. He was one of the gentlest, wisest and most Spirit-filled men I have ever met, and he encouraged me. In due course, I embarked on the slow process that leads to ordination – and to my surprise found that things moved rather quickly. I also came to experience the glory of God as I never had done before. St Mark’s was so alive, and so was the Christian Union at St Thomas’. When I went into the operating theatre early in the morning, the sense of God’s presence was so real that often I felt I was in heaven. I spent my days singing his praises. As the weeks went by, my desire to go into the church increased almost by the hour and it wasn’t long before all I wanted in life was to be ordained and serve God full-time. Eventually, I went to Ridley Hall, Cambridge and started my training for the Anglican ministry.\n\nI didn’t find my theological education easy. Spiritually, I would describe it as something of a ‘wilderness experience’. Certainly, it was a good deal harder than my previous training at St Thomas’ – at least, until I started studying Judaism under the inspirational professor Nicholas de Lange. This was a subject I felt passionate about. It had fascinated me ever since I was a child: my father had often talked to me about it, and it related to international affairs that had interested and enthused me since my last two years at school. The head of those years, Michael Amos, was one of the most inspiring people I have ever met. Not only did he teach me politics and economics, I would spend my lunch breaks in his study while he went through the serious newspapers with us and talked to us about the world. (I wasn’t surprised when, many years later, his daughter became Leader of the House of Lords. In November 2007, when I was awarded the Woolf Institute’s Pursuer of Peace Award at the Middle Temple in London, to my delight it was Baroness Amos who presented it to me, and in the presence of her father.)\n\nStudying Judaism gave me the opportunity to take further my interest in international affairs, and in particular my interest in the Middle East. Crucial to the latter was a very English crisis at Cambridge. In 1988, members of the university’s inter-collegiate Christian union (known as Ciccu) who were organizing its triennial mission decided to invite evangelists from Jews for Jesus to take part, to try to convert Jewish students. This caused a great deal of resentment among the practising Jews, who asked me to intervene. I was known to both sides and trusted and respected by both – by Ciccu’s evangelicals because I was studying at a conservative evangelical college, and because the chair of their mission committee was a good friend of mine (indeed, in due course he was to be my best man!), and by the Jews because I regularly attended Cambridge’s Orthodox synagogue and prayed there in Hebrew alongside them.\n\nI told my fellow Christians that trying to persuade people to change their religion is a very dangerous undertaking, but in any event it can be done only if you form a relationship with them. The outcome was that Ciccu went ahead, very carefully, with its evangelistic meeting; but subsequently Jewish and Christian students got together to set up a society called Cambridge University Jews and Christians (or Cujac). This soon became a branch of the Council of Christians and Jews (CCJ), and it was only a matter of time before I found myself chairing the young leadership section of the International Council of Christians and Jews. I worked closely with Sir Sigmund Sternberg, the chair of the ICCJ, and learned a lot from him.\n\nAs part of my course at Cambridge, I spent some of my final year in Jerusalem, at the Hebrew University and an Ultra-Orthodox Jewish yeshiva or seminary. This was a life-shaping experience, totally different from anything else I had ever encountered. It was the first time I had engaged seriously with another faith tradition – a tradition, moreover, that was the foundation of my own religion. Originally, I had gone there to study the role of Israel – the people, the land and finally the state – in Christian thought; but I was challenged by seeing at first hand how these Jews practised their faith. So much of their religion was concerned with what they did rather than what they believed – quite the opposite from most Christianity. I had always been taught, by people who had very little understanding of it, that Judaism is all about legalism; but what I observed was that actually the 613 mitzvot, or commandments, had one purpose only: to please God.\n\nAt the same time, I also got to know well several Islamic leaders in Jerusalem, and so my study of Islam began.\n\nOn a second visit to Jerusalem, between my graduation from Cambridge and my ordination, I was instructed by an Ultra-Orthodox rabbi to go and see a woman known as Sister Ruth Heflin, who ran a very charismatic and rather American church called the Mount Zion Fellowship. She proved to be the most forceful person I have ever met. Indeed, I was scared of her. At the end of the first meeting I attended, in her house in East Jerusalem, she came up to me and started to prophesy over me. She had never met me before and knew nothing about me, but she declared that my calling in life was to ‘seek the peace of Jerusalem and the Middle East’. At that stage, I couldn’t make any sense of this (and I certainly had no inkling that ‘the Middle East’ might include Iraq) but what I did understand was that her home was filled with the glory of God as I had never experienced it before.\n\nBack in England, I was ordained in 1990 in a wonderful service at Southwark Cathedral and then started work as a curate, or assistant minister, at St Mark’s Church, Battersea Rise in south London. It was at this time that I got married to the most wonderful – and most tolerant – woman I have ever met. I was preaching one day when I looked down from the pulpit and saw her for the first time. I liked what I saw so much that afterwards I went up to her and, even though I knew nothing about her, asked if she would help me to organize a mission. Six weeks later, I asked Caroline to marry me.\n\nOur wedding was conducted by Donald Coggan, a former archbishop of Canterbury, who had become my mentor in life. Every time we met, he would say when we parted: ‘Don’t take care, take risks!’ I have never forgotten those words.\n\nMy involvement in Jewish-Christian relations continued. (So, indeed, did my work in anaesthetics, though now more as a hobby. Each week on my day off I went to St Thomas’ to work as a volunteer. I doubt very much that that would be allowed today.) I regularly travelled overseas, and increasingly to the Middle East. I also deepened my acquaintance with Islam – initially in Africa, in Kenya and Nigeria for example, after the ICCJ had set up its Abrahamic Forum to promote interreligious dialogue between all three of the great monotheistic faiths. It was clear to me that if I was going to play a role in the Middle East I had to understand Islam as well as Judaism. To the surprise of my vicar, I had regular audiences with the Pope to brief him on my work, and we enjoyed a close relationship – I even took Caroline to meet him on one occasion. I liked him so much. As a Strict and Particular Baptist I had been brought up to think of the Vatican as the home of the Antichrist, but I had learned to respect Catholics for the certainty of their faith, and I had also come to believe that godliness matters more than doctrinal correctness (and not only in Christians).\n\nAfter three years, I moved a mile down the road to become priest-in-charge of the Church of the Ascension, Balham Hill. The congregation was struggling, but it was a wonderful mix of black and white and rich and poor, and at times the glory of God came down there. I was very involved in the local community and eventually was voted onto Wandsworth Borough Council, where in due course I became chair of social services. Meanwhile, I was still chairing the young leadership section of the ICCJ, and by this stage we had also created an active branch of that section in the British CCJ, which was led by another great Jewish friend, Paul Mendel. I didn’t know what God was preparing me for, and yet I was receiving an excellent grounding in the fundamentals of international relations and reconciliation.\n\nAt St Mark’s, my vicar had told me off for being away so much, but now as a vicar myself I travelled all the more. I limited myself to being absent no more than one Sunday in six, but that still meant I could go abroad for almost two weeks at a time. I went back and forth to the Holy Land and the Holy See, and also became ever more involved in the Islamic world. In 1994, jointly with Lord Coggan, I was given the Sir Sigmund Sternberg Award for my ‘sustained contribution to the furtherance of interreligious understanding’. I have won many other prizes since then, but none has meant as much to me as the one I shared with him.\n\nThen, one day in 1998, having been at the Church of the Ascension for not quite five years, my bishop, Roy Williamson, suggested that I should apply for the job as canon in charge of international ministry at Coventry Cathedral. At the age of 33 I was barely old enough for such a senior position, but he encouraged me to apply anyway, and to my surprise I was appointed and was soon installed. The cathedral of St Michael’s, Coventry is a wonderful place, with an extraordinary history of taking risks for the sake of reconciliation. Moreover, I was succeeding Paul Oestreicher, a truly great man whom I had long admired from afar. Nonetheless, leaving the Church of the Ascension was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do. I loved those people so much, and when I had to tell them I was going I broke down in tears.\n\nMy enthusiasm for my new job was undiminished by the discovery that I had multiple sclerosis, a degenerative disease for which there is no known cure. I had gone to see my doctor because I was suffering from double vision and my balance was going. He put me in touch with the local hospital and they admitted me for five weeks. When they told me I had MS, I was upset, of course, but not for long, because my second son, Jacob, was born later that very day. (We called him Aaron at first, but we changed his name the next day. He didn’t look like an Aaron.) I was aware of how great a handicap my condition might prove to be, but I am quite an optimist and my temperament as well as my faith averted any kind of spiritual crisis. My new employers didn’t know whether I would be able to travel any more, but they realized that there was no point trying to tell me what to do. As for my doctor, he assured me: ‘The wonderful thing is, we have a hospice here especially for people with MS.’ That really made me laugh.\n\nIt soon was clear that if I and my new colleagues were really to help to bring peace to the world, we needed to deal with those who wielded power. Within months, I was forging links with politicians. With my predecessor’s support, I also began to direct the work more towards the Middle East, in the belief that one of the greatest challenges that faced us now was the potential for conflict between the West and the Islamic world. This book is about the attempts I have made since then to build bridges between East and West. This work is so difficult, but it is now my life. Despite my deteriorating health, I have no plans to give it up. In recent years, my focus has moved from Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to Iraq. It may be the most dangerous place in the world, but it has the most wonderful people.\n\nThough I spend most of my time engaging with diplomats and politicians, I do everything in the power and to the glory of the Almighty. I will never"
