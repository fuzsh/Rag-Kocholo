        "text": "Publisher and Publication Date: Akashic Books. 2018.\n\nGenre: Fiction, short stories, murder mystery.\n\nPages: 256.\n\nFormat: E-book copy from the public library.\n\nSource: Library.\n\nAudience: Readers of fiction short stories written with the background of Iraq.\n\nRating: An overall rating of good.\n\nOverall, in referring to all of the stories in the one volume, I gave a good rating. Some of the stories are okay and some of the stories are very good.\n\nLink for the book @ Amazon.\n\nSummary and My Thoughts section together:\n\nThere are four parts to the book holding a total of 19 chapters.\n\nThemes in the short stories: violence, mistrust, justice, injustice, revenge, culture and society, depression, death and dying, anger, and fear. There is one love story but there is something sinister in the development.\n\nIn the introduction, the various people groups who live in Iraq are explained. In this section, I learned about the culture and society, geographical areas, languages, the religion is explained, the years of occupation by other governments, wars, and the development of literature in Iraq.\n\nThe stories are not the feel good nor lighthearted kind of stories. They are heavy and serious.\n\nThe first story is a mother who has lost both daughters in death. A note is found nearby saying, “I killed her because I loved her.”\n\nThis is a difficult story to read. I had to take a step back and read it as a story without making judgment. It is this mindset that helped me read every short story in the book.\n\nBaghdad Noir is not my usual read. I feel it is good to take a step out of my comfort zone every once in a while, in order to learn about how other people live and think and act and react.\n\nI feel educated in regard to the country of Iraq. For example, before reading this book, I knew little about its literature. A story as we know it in Western type literature is very new to Iraq. It is exciting to read the awakening and infancy and development of Iraq’s literary genre.\n\nThe stories are not all recent. One story has a time period of the 1970s.\n\nI cannot imagine a country holding several people groups who have some similarities but are also in fear of or at war with one another. The groups often segregate or stay away from one another. There is fear and mistrust of one another. At times these things are heightened and escalate to the point of family members betraying one another. Now, think about what I just wrote and compare these same things to America. A little scary. And I dislike. Americans may not be exactly like the stories written in this book, but America does have violence, mistrust, anger, and disunity. Not 100% of all Americans are like this, nor or 100% of the Iraqi people are like this.\n\nPublisher and Publication Date: Atria Books. September 12, 2017.\n\nGenre: Fiction.\n\nPages: 368.\n\nSource: Library.\n\nRating: Very Good.\n\nAmazon\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Unquiet Grave is three key people who share the same history. The setting is West Virginia. The two years of history are 1897 and 1930.\n\nIn 1897, a head-strong young woman named Zona Hester marries a blacksmith. Never mind he has been married before and those marriages ended strangely. Zona wants to marry a handsome man who will shower her with love. Mary Jane is Zona’s mother. Mary Jane is suspicious by nature. She and her husband have fretted over Zona’s behavior for years. They love their willful and defiant daughter, but never knew how to best manage Zona. After Zona marries, Mary Jane hears Zona has died. Mary Jane believes her son-in-law killed Zona. She tells the county prosecutor that the ghost of Zona visited her and told her she’d been murdered. The third key character of the book is the defense attorney, a black man named James P. D. Gardner. When he begins telling his story the year is 1930.\n\nNo, I did not plan to read two ghost stories in a row.\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nI like this story more than the previous story read: Grief Cottage.\n\nSeveral points led me to give The Unquiet Grave a very good rating.\n\n• The story of a black attorney at the turn of the twentieth century appealed to me. He had perseverance and fortitude to attend higher education to become an attorney in an age when blacks were severely oppressed.\n\n• Mary Jane is a woman and mother with tenacity. She does not let things go. When she believes in something she finds a way to make “it” happen. She is a keen problem solver. She has had a life time to solve the after affects of Zona’s behavior. Mary Jane’s husband is meek. Mary Jane is the opposite.\n\n• Zona is a mess. She leaves a wake of large waves behind her. After she marries, the household of her childhood home is quiet. After marriage, the spark of her personality is gone. She is a waif of her former self.\n\n• The Unquiet Grave is a descriptive story. Whether it is the scenery or a character’s face.\n\n• I love the background for the writing of this story. It is a mix of folklore, based on the Greenbrier Ghost."
