        "text": "Gertrude Bell (born July 14, 1868, Washington Hall, Durham, Eng.—died July 12, 1926, Baghdad, Iraq) was an English traveler, administrator in Arabia, and writer who played a principal part in the establishment in Baghdad of the Hāshimite dynasty.\n\nGertrude Bell’s brilliant career at Oxford, where she took a first in history in 1887, was followed by some time spent in Tehrān, where her uncle Sir Frank Lascelles was British minister. Returning to the political and intellectual salons in England and Europe for a decade, she did not until 1899 embark on the career of Arabian activities that made her famous. She visited Palestine and Syria in that year and was often back in the Middle East during the next decade, extending her travels to Asia Minor. But her heart was set on an Arabian journey, which she began in 1913, being the second woman (after Lady Anne Blunt) to visit Haʾil, where she was not favourably received, although she ever afterward favoured the Ibn Rashīd dynasty in its struggle against the Ibn Saʿūd dynasty. She never wrote a full account of this journey, though her literary output during the 20 years preceding World War I had been considerable, including Safar Nameh (1894), Poems from the Divan of Hafiz (1897), The Desert and the Sown (1907), The Thousand and One Churches (1909), and Amurath to Amurath (1911). Her vast correspondence was published in an edited form in two volumes by her stepmother in 1927."
