        "text": "With the death of organised religion, British writers have a new moral burden. Philip Pullman, the award-winning children's author, yesterday urged writers to tackle the great moral issues of life and death or risk becoming trivial and unreadable.\n\nPullman, 55, won this year's Whitbread book award for the final instalment of the His Dark Materials trilogy, in which he created a parallel universe ruled by a senile, viciously sadistic deity who has to be deposed in battle so the inhabitants can join with angels in creating a \"republic of heaven\". The Catholic Herald called his books \"the stuff of nightmares\" and \"worthy of the bonfire\". Another critic cautioned: \"Christian parents beware.\"\n\nPullman, who writes for children but shuns the category, \"children's author\", is only outsold by JK Rowling's Harry Potter series and has a vast adult readership.\n\nKeen to tackle received ideas on religion, he recently called CS Lewis's highly Christian Narnia books \"blatantly racist\" and \"monumentally disparaging of children\". Such is his hatred of domineering, organised religion, he has become something of an evangelical atheist.\n\nDuring a debate on morality in fiction at the Edinburgh international books festival at the weekend, Pullman warned that in the climate of threatened attacks on Iraq and the crisis in the Middle East, we live in a Godless and uncertain age, and unless writers wrestled with the larger questions of moral conduct, they would become useless and irrelevant.\n\nThe author, who writes from his garden shed, said he did not like to be called a fantasy writer because fantasy was a disappointment.\n\n\"It is not that I don't like fantasy, I don't like what it does. Fantasy, and fiction in general, is failing to do what it might be doing. It has unlimited potential to explore all sorts of metaphysical and moral questions, but it is not ... My quarrel with fantasy writing is that it is such a rich seam to be mined, such a versatile mode, that is not always being used to explore bigger ideas.\"\n\nFiction must return to carrying a \"moral punch\", unless literature is to become petty and worthless. This meant examining issues of good and evil, power, death, paradise and hell. If a book did not deal with death, \"to me it is trivial\".\n\nCiting Jane Austen's Emma as a masterpiece of the literary examination of morality, Pullman said: \"Try as hard as you can, you can't leave out morality from a book. Everything we do, however small, has consequences. The greatest fiction always has a sequence of actions followed by reactions, followed by consequences.\n\n\"You can't leave morality out unless your work is so stupid and trivial and so worthless that [nobody] would want to read it anyway.\"\n\nPullman, whose grandfather was an Anglican priest, and who stopped believing in God as a teenager, said: \"I am all for the death of God.\"\n\nBut his real bugbear was with the \"propensity of human nature\" to use politics or religion to set up one unquestionable truth - \"it could be the Bible, it could be the Communist Manifesto\" - and to then knock down all that went against it. \"This is what I am against. Not Christianity, but every religion and fundamental organisation where there is one truth and they will kill you if you don't believe it.\"\n\nPullman has previously warned that the English literary novel - since the deaths of William Golding and Graham Greene - has been too queasy about tackling issues of moral conduct and life and death, leaving the work to children's fiction.\n\nRichard Holloway, the former bishop of Edinburgh, and once considered Britain's most controversial church leader, appeared with Pullman to debate fiction's role in the discussion of good and evil.\n\nHe said politicians were abusing their power to create hellish scenarios on earth and it was right for novelists to explore the concepts of death, hell and the afterlife.\n\nHe said: \"In the Middle East, we are delivering each other to hell. If President Bush unleashes hell on Iraq in the next weeks, it will tell us something about human nature's capacity for monstrous wrongs. Hell is our own creation. If we are not careful, we will allow our brothers to deliver hell on earth to us.\"\n\nSpeaking later at the festival, the author Fay Weldon said younger readers no longer needed the black and white moral bounds that were imposed on their parents. \"Children today know they are not in the safe environment that all children's books used to be.\"\n\nWill, hero of The Amber Spyglass by Philip Pullman, talks to an angel called Baruch"
