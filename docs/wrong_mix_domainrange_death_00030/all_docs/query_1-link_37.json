        "text": "The British writer C.S. Lewis is famous for writing a series of books called The Chronicles of Narnia. Lewis wrote many other books, including poetry, science fiction, and books about Christianity.\n\nClive Staples Lewis was born on November 29, 1898, in Belfast, Ireland. As a child, he missed a lot of school due to illness. In 1916 he went to University College in Oxford, England. He left school for a time to fight in World War I with the British Army. After college, he became a teacher.\n\nLewis published many books throughout his teaching career. Some were about the subjects he taught. He also wrote about being a Christian. One of his most well-known Christian books is called The Screwtape Letters. It was published in 1942. It is a humorous story about devils trying to tempt a young Christian.\n\nIn 1950 Lewis wrote one of his most famous books. It was a children’s book called The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. This book was the first of the series called The Chronicles of Narnia. The seven books tell the story of four brothers and sisters. They discover a magical world called Narnia, where they have many adventures.\n\nC.S. Lewis died on November 22, 1963. He had retired from teaching the summer before."
