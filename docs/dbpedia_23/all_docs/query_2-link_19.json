        "text": "No Title\n\nNo Title\n\nNo information\n\nPaleorrota, also called rota paleológica, literally paleoroute in English), is a geopark located in central Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The rocks and fossils found along the route date back to the times when there was only one supercontinent Pangaea. The BR-287 is the main highway in the area and is called the Highway of Dinosaurs due to fossil localities crossing many municipalities of the region. Paleorrota is a simple and single term. Was adopted because the term Ruta Paleontológica, was already used in countries such as Spain, Bolivia, Colombia and Mexico, which caused confusion among tourists.\n\nThe Geopark takes up a vast area underlain by bedrock from the Permian and Triassic (290 to 210 million years ago). It comprises several paleontological sites within the rock formations Santa Maria, Caturrita, Sanga do Cabral, Rio do Rasto and Irati. These sites contain diverse vertebrate fossil assemblages. In the southwestern part of the geopark are found fossils that date back to the Permian, 280 million years ago.\n\nScript error: No such module \"Location map/multi\".\n\nStaurikosaurus was the first Brazilian dinosaur discovery, made by the paleontologist Llewellyn Ivor Price in Santa Maria (Paleontological Site Jazigo Cinco).\n\nThe city of Mata, together with the cities of São Pedro do Sul and Santa Maria, are founded on paleobotanical deposits. Within an area of more than 70 km² are several sites with petrified trees.[1]\n\nAt the end of the Permian, 95% of life on Earth disappeared at the Permian–Triassic extinction. Fossil finds made in the region of Paleorrota have advanced the understanding of these the Triassic evolution of vertebrates. Some important fossils from the park include Staurikosaurus, one of the oldest saurischia species, Sacisaurus, possibly the oldest ornithischian, and Pelycosaurs. This group gave rise to the cynodonts, which in turn led to the mammals. The Geopark's fossils contribute greatly in the understanding of mammalian evolution.\n\nMascot[]\n\nThe Dinotchê is the official mascot of the region. It's a dinosaur that lives in Paleorrota, dresses like a gaucho, taste mate and enjoy churrasco of Rhynchosaur and Dinodontosaurus.\n\nFlag[]\n\nThe flag of the Geopark Paleorrota, is the flag of Rio Grande do Sul with white Staurikosaurus in the center. It is a tribute to Brazilian first dinosaur found by Llewellyn Ivor Price, in Santa Maria City.\n\nPaleorrota Group[]\n\nDue to the large number of municipalities and institutions involved with Paleorrota, was created in 2010, the Paleorrota Group where people interested in Tourism, Research and Education in Paleorrota, found on electronic mailing list called Paleorrota Group. In group projects and ideas are discussed. There is an exchange of information about what is happening in the region.[2][3]\n\nFauna[]\n\nThere are over 60 known species of vertebrates with fossils found in the park.\n\nThe insect Sanctipaulus mendesi, a caddisfly, is known from a single specimen found in the park.\n\nList of vertebrates collected in the region:\n\nAetosaur\n\nBageherpeton longignathus\n\nBarberenachampsa nodosa\n\nBarberenasuchus brasiliensis\n\nBelesodon magnificus\n\nBrasilitherium\n\nBrasilodon\n\nCandelaria barbouri\n\nCandelariodon barberenai\n\nCargninia enigmatica\n\nCerritosaurus\n\nChanaresuchus bonapartei\n\nCharruodon Tetracuspidatus\n\nChiniquodon\n\nClevosaurus brasiliensis\n\nDecuriasuchus\n\nDinocephalians\n\nDinodontosaurus pedroanum\n\nDinodontosaurus turpior\n\nExaeretodon riograndensis\n\nFaxinalipterus minima\n\nGuaibasaurus\n\nGomphodontosuchus Brasiliensis\n\nIrajatherium hernadezi\n\nHyperodapedon huenei\n\nHyperodapedon mariensis\n\nHyperodapedon sanjuanensis\n\nJachaleria candelariensis\n\nKaramuru vorax\n\nLuangwa\n\nMassetognathus\n\nMenadon\n\nMesosaurus\n\nMinicynodon\n\nPampadromaeus\n\nPampaphoneus biccai\n\nPhytosaurs\n\nPrestosuchus chiniquensis\n\nProcerosuchus\n\nProcolophon brasiliensis\n\nProcolophon pricei\n\nProcolophon trigoniceps\n\nProterochampsa nodosa\n\nProtheriodon estudianti\n\nProtorosaurus\n\nProtuberum cabralensis\n\nProvelosaurus brasilienses\n\nProzostrodon brasiliensis\n\nRauisuchus tiradentes\n\nRhadinosuchus gracilis\n\nRiograndia\n\nSacisaurus\n\nSangaia lavinai\n\nSantacruzodon hopsoni\n\nSaturnalia tupiniquim\n\nSpondylosoma\n\nSoturnia caliodon\n\nStahleckeria\n\nStaurikosaurus\n\nStreptospondyls\n\nTeyumbaita sulcognathus\n\nTeyuwasu\n\nTherioherpeton Cargnini\n\nTiarajudens eccentricus\n\nTraversodon Stahleckeri\n\nTrucidocynodon\n\nUnaysaurus\n\nFlora[]\n\nIn paleobotany there are two areas that stand out in the geopark. North the Caturrita Formation dating from the Triassic, with a forest of petrified trunks of conifers which is located mainly in the cities of Mata, São Pedro do Sul and Santa Maria. South the Rio Bonito Formation, which dates from the Sakmarian, with a varied flora of the Permian Glossopteris and is located mainly in the cities of Mariana Pimentel, Encruzilhada do Sul, Arroio dos Ratos, Pantano Grande, Cachoeira do Sul, Rio Pardo and São Jerônimo.\n\nWith the Permian Extinction was a change of Glossopteris flora, which prevailed in the Carboniferous and Permian to Dicroidium flora of Triassic. We can see these two floras with the following genera existing in geopark: [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]\n\nLycophytas: Plants vascularized with reproduction by spores. Genera Brasilodendron and Cyclodendron.\n\nPteridospermatophytas: Plants vascularized known as seed ferns with fronds. Were abundant in the Triassic. Genus Dicroidium.\n\nPteridophytas: Vascularized seedless plants (ferns) and reproduction by spores. They leaf type fronds. They lived in locals humid and swampy. Were abundant in the Permian. Genera Asterotheca, Botrychiopsis, Neomariopteris, Osmundites Pecopteris and Stephanophyllites.\n\nSphenophytas: Vascularized seedless plants (horsetails). Genera Phyllotheca, Sphenopteris and Neocalamites.\n\nGlossopteris: Plants gymnosperms vascularized that reproduce with seeds. Gave the name to Glossopteris flora. It was trees or shrubs with 4–6 metres tall and with tongue-shaped leaves (Greek glosso). Genera Glossopteris and Gangamopteris.\n\nCordaites: Plants gymnosperms vascularized that reproduce with seeds. Were similar to conifers with large leaves and ribbed. Generally possessed with heart-shaped seeds. Could have 45 metres tall. Genera Cordaites and Kawizophyllum.\n\nGinkgophytas: Plants gymnosperms vascularized that reproduce with seeds. Leaves were similar to current Ginkgos. Genera Chiropteris, Cheirophyllum, Sphenobaiera, Ginkgoites e Baieroxylon.\n\nConifers: Plants gymnosperms vascularized with reproduction by seeds. Consisting of Pine and Araucaria, which could reach 30 meters tall and two meters in diameter. Genera Buriadia, Cordaicarpus, Coricladus, Kaokoxylon, Samaropsis, Sommerxylon, Brachyphyllum e Pagiophyllum.\n\nBennettitales: Plants gymnosperms vascularized that reproduce with seeds. Closely related to the cycads, ginkgo and conifers. Probably gave rise to angiosperms. Genera Nilssonia e Williamsonia.\n\nIn Paleobotany usually the leaves, seeds, trunks, pollen and spores are found separately. So theseeds, pollens and spores receive a separate nomenclature, so that in the future are established links and synonyms between plant parts. Palynology is the division of Paleobotany that contributes to the study of fossils as tiny pollens, spores, fungi and algae. Below is a list of spores, pollens, fungi and algae ever found in Paleorrota:\n\nGenus of spore: Brevitriletes, Calamospora, Cirratriradites, Convolutispora, Cristatisporites, Cyclogranisporites, Granulatisporites, Horriditriletes, Kraeuselisporites, Lundbladispora, Punctatisporites, Reticulatisporites and Vallatisporites.\n\nGenus of pollen grains: Cannanoropolis, Cycadopites, Divarisaccus, Illinites, Limitisporites, Peppersites, Protohaploxypinus, Striomonosaccites, Vesicaspora and Vittatina.\n\nFungi: Portalites gondwanensis.\n\nAlgae: Brazilea helby, Brazilea scissa, Leiosphaeridia sp., Tetraporina sp. and Quadrisporites horridus.\n\nHistory[]\n\nBiozone and animal life in time\n\nScale in millions of years.\n\nSources: UFSM (Romeu Beltrão) and UFRGS.\n\nThe research began with fossils in Santa Maria with the geographer and professor Antero de Almeida, in 1901, when the first fossils found in the Sanga da Alemoa. Antero de Almeida, also found the Paleontological Site Chiniquá, later visited by German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene.\n\nIn 1902, Dr. Jango Fischer, born in Santa Maria, collected fossils in the Sanga da Alemoa and sent to Prof. Dr. Hermann von Ihering, then director of the Museu Paulista in São Paulo. Three vertebral bodies were nearly complete, a fragment of a vertebra, one finger and four phalanges and ungual phalanx alone. The material was sent to Arthur Smith Woodward, the eminent paleontologist of the British Museum in London to study, which resulted in the determination of the first terrestrial reptile fossil in South America, the Rhynchosaur was given the name Scaphonyx fischeri, in honor of Jango Fischer.\n\nSo the international scientific attention has focused on Santa Maria, leading to a series of scientific expeditions.\n\nIn the years 1915 to 1917, Dr. Guilherme Rau, a German who now reside in Santa Maria in 1900, helped the German scientist Dr. H. Lotz of the Geological Survey of Berlin, and collected 200 fossils in the Sanga da Alemoa. This material was sent to Von Huene in Germany in 1924. During this time a boy of 14 years, Atílio Munari, who lived near the Sanga da Alemoa, began to live with the scientist H. Lotz, who taught him to collect and prepare the fossils. Many of the fossils collected by him, are now in Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre and Santa Maria.\n\nLlewellyn Ivor Price, was born in Santa Maria, and completed his studies at Harvard University, USA. He returned to Santa Maria in 1936, bringing along his colleague Theodore E. White. Both contacted Munari that helped them in their excavations of fossils.\n\nIn 1925, Santa Maria and São Pedro do Sul, were visited by the German paleontologist Dr. Bruno von Freyberg, University of Halle-Wittenberg. That same year Dr. G. Florence and Pacheco, members of the Commission geological and geographical, of São Paulo were in Paleorrota. Everything that happened this season influenced Vicentino Prestes de Almeida, born Chiniquá (1900), to become a paleontologist. A jaw discovered by him, and sent to Germany, it influenced Von Huene to make a visit to Brazil. Prestosuchus is named after a Vicentino Prestes de Almeida.\n\nIn 1927, the geologists Paulino Franco de Carvalho and Nero Passos, come to Santa Maria. This year also comes the geologist Alex Löfgren, who came here a year and a half helped by Munari.\n\nIn 1928 comes the German Friedrich von Huene, accompanied by Dr. Rudolf Stahlecker. They were six months collecting in the Sanga da Alemoa and then stayed two months in Chiniquá. In the ten-month period they made several stratigraphic observations of many municipalities. They returned to Germany with many tons of fossils. Many fossils collected by Friedrich von Huene are at the University of Tübingen, Germany.\n\nDuring this period, Tupi Caldas describes the Dinodontosaurus pedroanum e Hyperodapedon mariensis.\n\nCerritosaurus was collected in 1941 by Jesuit Antonio Binsfeld, in the Sanga da Alemoa in Santa Maria.\n\nIn the 1940s and 50’s various expeditions organized by Llewellyn Ivor Price, of the Department of Palaeontology of the National Department of Mineral Production in Rio de Janeiro, arriving in the region. Price has worked in the area along with Edwin Harris Colbert, Carlos de Paula Couto, Mackenzie Gondon, Fausto Luís de Souza Cunha and Theodore E. White. In Santa Maria, Price was staying at Colégio Centenário.\n\nIn 1947, Ney Vidal and Carlos de Paula Couto, working at the National Museum of Brazil, were collecting fossils in the region. In 1955 prof. Irajá Damiani Pinto (UFRGS), made collections of fossils in Paleorrota.\n\nDr. Romeu Beltrão, who in 1951 collected material was sent to the National Museum of Brazil. Subsequently the fossils was studied by Carlos de Paula Couto.\n\nFrom the year 1956 Father Daniel Cargnin, which has enriched many museums, such as Museum Vincente Pallotti, Museum Daniel Cargnin, UFRGS and PUCRS. He worked with Mário Costa Barberena (UFRGS) and he collected more than 50 skulls. He was a paleontologist, who collected about 80% of the fossils that are in museums in the region.\n\nFrom the 1960s, with the creation of the School of Geology (UFRGS), and subsequently their postgraduate courses, the geological mapping of Paleorrota received large increase, as well as paleontological knowledge of sedimentary rocks found there.\n\nIn the 70 and 80, in São Pedro do Sul, Walter Ilha, a paleontologist has collected fossils in the region. Collected bibliographies, books and magazines on the subject. He fought to build a museum in his hometown. In 1987 he died, and the museum acquired the name of Museum Paleontologic and Archaeological Walter Ilha.\n\nIn Paleorrota, paleontology began with amateur paleontologists. Later we had the arrival of several foreign paleontologists, who contributed with their research and teaching of paleontology drove in our universities and schools. Throughout this period the research of the amateurs were usually made with their own financial resources.\n\nResearch and Teaching[]\n\nInstitutions.\n\nFederal University of Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nFederal University of Santa Maria.\n\nPontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nUniversity of Vale do Rio dos Sinos.\n\nLutheran University of Brazil.\n\nZoobotanical Foundation of Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nFederal University of Pampa.\n\nCentro Universitário Franciscano (Tourism).\n\nIn the early 1960s, started the first university courses in geology in Brazil, due to the incentive to search for oil. Among the first universities were UFRGS, which began with the direction of prof. Irajá Damiani Pinto. The teaching of paleontology occurs today at UFRGS, UFSM, PUCRS and UNISINOS. Currently UFRGS produces replicas of fossils that are sold or exchanged with other research institutions, museums and businesses.[14]\n\nIt has also intensified the Paleontological Tourism in the region, and the UNIFRA has prepared for tourism professionals.\n\nIn October 2009, began free distribution of one thousand copies of the book Vertebrados Fósseis de Santa Maria e Região (Vertebrate Fossils of Santa Maria and surrounding regions in English). The book will be delivered to institutions, schools and libraries in Santa Maria, in order to spread the teaching of this subject in the region. The book was published by the council of the city.[15]\n\nAlready published two comic books with titles Xiru Lautério e Os Dinossauros I and II, in order to disclose the paleontology and gaucho culture among children.\n\nIt is available in the Book Paleorrota of Wikibooks, with the main pages linked to the Paleorrota.\n\nTourism[]\n\nThe great discoveries made were not sufficient to mobilize the authorities in the use of the region for tourism Paleontology. More than 25% of the area of Rio Grande do Sul is in the Geopark, with more than 30 municipalities involved and 8% of population of region.[16]\n\nCurrently less than 10,000 tourists a year visit the Geopark. If each gaucho visit to the region once in a lifetime, there would be 150,000 tourists annually. This shows that tourism is being under utilized and compared with the 3 million who visit each year Gramado and Canela, the numbers are mediocre.\n\nThere is failure to engage the authorities to activate the Paleontological Tourism. You need the investment of public money on projects. The Project Dinosaur Highway ensure the movement of tourists and the return on this investment would be through taxes.\n\nHow to visit the local[]\n\nThe tourist who arrives in Porto Alegre have several options for visits to museums in the city. A visit to the Porto Alegre Botanical Garden, also visits the Museum of Natural Sciences Foundation Zoo Botanical Rio Grande do Sul, which is inside and has an exhibition of fossils. Two kilometers away is the Museum of Science and Technology (PUCRS), which has several specimens of fossils, plus an exhibition of science and technology. Seven kilometers of PUCRS, we arrived at the campus of UFRGS, where is located the Museum of Paleontology Irajá Damiani Pinto next to the building and has a Geosciences Laboratory of Paleontology.\n\nMuseums\n\nGeopark Paleorrota.\n\nMuseum of Paleontology Irajá Damiani Pinto\n\nPorto Alegre Botanical Garden\n\nMuseum of Science and Technology (PUCRS)\n\nMuseum Education Gama D'Eça.\n\nMuseum Vincente Pallotti.\n\nMuseum Aristides Carlos Rodrigues.\n\nMuseum Paleontologic and Archaeological Walter Ilha.\n\nMuseum Daniel Cargnin.\n\nThe Museum of Geological History of Rio Grande do Sul is located in the city of São Leopoldo, in the UNISINOS and is thirty kilometers from Porto Alegre. UNISINOS has emerged in surveys of Paleobotany.\n\nTo know Paleorrota, starting the trip in Porto Alegre, should go through the BR-287 toward Santa Maria, which is 300 kilometers away. Following the path we passed the town of Venâncio Aires, which is the start of the area with fossils. In Candelária town, we visit the Museum Aristides Carlos Rodrigues.\n\nArriving in Santa Maria, you can visit the campus of UFSM, the Museum Vincente Pallotti and the Educational Museum Gama D'Eça. In Santa Maria, was where the history of paleontology of Paleorrota began. The city itself is under a large deposit of fossils. The city has many hotels, shoppings and restaurants.\n\nOver 40 kilometers of travel, and arrive to São Pedro do Sul, where is the Museum Paleontologic and Archaeological Walter Ilha. More than 40 kilometers and we reached the town of Mata, where the museum is the Museum Daniel Cargnin. Here there are a lot of petrified wood that are found throughout the city. In Mata end our trip.\n\nFrom Porto Alegre to Mata, is about 400 kilometers is better down the road of Paleorrota with a car. If you prefer to go by bus to Santa Maria.\n\nInternational Tourism[]\n\nIn international tourism in Brazil, the country that more sends tourists to Brazil is Argentina, with more than a million a year. These tourists usually come by car in Rio Grande do Sul towards the beaches of Santa Catarina, traversing the highway of Dinosaurs. The lack of investment in tourism in Paleorrota, makes the state fails to create jobs and raise millions in taxes.\n\nCities and Municipalities[]\n\nThe Geopark of Paleorrota comprises 50 municipalities in Rio Grande do Sul City Information\n\nPorto Alegre\n\nAlthough Porto Alegre is not located within the area of the Triassic rocks, it has the highest number of paleontologists of Rio Grande do Sul and possesses a large number of museums, institutions and universities :\n\nThe UFRGS has a large number of paleontologists specializing in vertebrates and houses the Museum of Paleontology Irajá Damiani Pinto. In 1998 the first Brazilian Symposium on Vertebrate Paleontology was held at UFRGS.\n\nThe PUCRS has contributed to the paleorrota. Its important Museum of Science and Technology displays fossils of the region.\n\nThe UNISINOS has a team specializing in paleobotany.\n\nAt the Museum of Natural Sciences, incorporated into the Porto Alegre Botanical Garden, is an exhibition of fossils found in the geopark.\n\nSanta Maria\n\nSanta Maria has been built on large fossil deposits featuring 22 outcrops within the city limits. Several of its museums have dinosaurs on display. In 2006, the University UFSM held the fifth Brazilian Symposium on Vertebrate Paleontology.[17] It was in Santa Maria that Staurikosaurus (amongst many other fossils) was first found.\n\nMunicipal museums with fossils on display:\n\nEducational Museum Gama D'Eça.\n\nMuseum Vincente Pallotti.\n\nTemplate:Paleontological Sites of Santa Maria\n\nCandelária\n\nCandelária has also been an area where fossil vertebrates have been discovered. The thecodont Karamuru was collected here in 2000. In the city alone are 17 outcrops.\n\nMunicipal museum with fossils on display:\n\nMuseum Aristides Carlos Rodrigues.\n\nSão Pedro do Sul\n\nSão Pedro do Sul has a large reserve of petrified trees and a museum with dinosaur fossils. The city is located 40 km from Santa Maria. In 1938 the paleontologist Friedrich von Huene collected here the thecodont Prestosuchus chiniquensis.\n\nPaleontological Site Chiniquá.\n\nMunicipal museum with fossils on display:\n\nPaleontological and Archeological Museum Walter Ilha.\n\nMata\n\nIn the city of Mata are large deposits of petrified trees.\n\nMunicipal museum with fossils on display:\n\nMuseum Daniel Cargnin.\n\nPalaeobotanical Garden in Mata\n\nSão João do Polêsine\n\nSão João do Polêsine is situated approximately 50 kilometers from Santa Maria.\n\nWithin the city are outcrops with fossils. The CAPPA (Support Center for Research on Palaeontology) is under construction in this city.\n\nAgudo\n\nSacisaurus was found in Agudo. It was discovered in 2010 the fossil of a Trucidocynodon.[18]\n\nSão Martinho da Serra\n\nHere Unaysaurus was discovered, 13 kilometers from Santa Maria.\n\nPaleontological Site of Agua Negra.\n\nDona Francisca\n\nNear the city of Santa Maria. Dona Francisca likewise has fossil-bearing outcrops. In 2008 a 240 million year old cynodont (Luangwa) was found here.\n\nResearchers at the Lutheran University of Brazil in April 2010 found a complete fossil of a thecodont Prestosuchus.[19]\n\nFaxinal do Soturno\n\nClose to Santa Maria. Faxinal do Soturno has outcrops with fossils.\n\nCachoeira do Sul\n\nThe fossil-bearing outcrops are to the north of the city. In Agudo, near Cachoeira do Sul, the ULBRA of Cachoeira do Sul discovered the fossil remnants of Sacisaurus.\n\nSão Gabriel\n\nIn São Gabriel the fossil remains of an ancient amphibian appeared that date back to the Permian (270 million years ago).[20]\n\nHere three geological formations crop out:\n\nIrati Formation (Passo São Borja). Age: Late Permian.\n\nRio do Rasto Formation (Posto Queimado). Age: Late Permian.\n\nSanga do Cabral Formation (Abandoned railroad between Dilermando de Aguiar and São Gabriel). Age: Late Triassic.\n\nAceguá\n\nIn the Aceguá area the outcrops are located between the City of Aceguá and Bagé, along the highway BR-153. They belong to the Rio do Rasto Formation and are Late Permian in age.\n\nBagé\n\nIn the Bagé area the outcrops are located between the City of Aceguá and Bagé, along the highway BR-153. They belong to the Rio do Rasto Formation and are Late Permian in age.\n\nDilermando de Aguiar\n\nIn Dilermando de Aguiar the Sanga do Cabral Formation crops out along the abandoned railroad between Dilermando de Aguiar and São Gabriel. Early Triassic age.\n\nSanta Cruz do Sul\n\nHere the fossil of a cynodont was found.[21]\n\nOf the seven mesoregions the state of Rio Grande do Sul, five are on Paleorrota geopark, which are:\n\nWestern Center Riograndense, the main Mesoregion of geopark, covered by the BR-287.\n\nEastern Center Riograndense, traveled by the BR-287.\n\nSouthwest Rio-Grandense this Mesoregion contain areas of the Permian.\n\nMetropolitan Porto Alegre, a small portion west belongs to the geopark and is traversed by the BR-287.\n\nSoutheast Riograndense, part of the Mesoregion located to the west is the geopark.\n\nAlthough almost a hundred municipalities involved in geopark, the Brazilian government and the government of Rio Grande do Sul, which are responsible for constitutional fossil, has done very little for paleontological tourism.\n\nThe demand of tourists is low due to lack of investment from the Secretariat of Tourism of Rio Grande do Sul, and the Brazilian Ministry of Tourism, generating a low income with the movement of tourists who ends up not generate resources to invest in research and education in paleontology. That does not make it economically sustainable paleontology.\n\nInstitutions such as the Federation of Associations of Municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul and the Legislative Assembly of Rio Grande do Sul, do not work on these projects for municipalities unite around this goal.\n\nProjects such as the Highway of Dinosaurs and Paleorrota Institute, aim to make the geopark sustainable.\n\nUNESCO Geopark[]\n\nIn the 80s the town of Mata, supported by São Pedro do Sul and Santa Maria, asked the UNESCO that the region was classified as a World Heritage Site. At this time, UNESCO did not have a solution to the global geological heritage.\n\nThe geopark concept created and diffused in Europe, was adopted by UNESCO in 1998. For a geopark enter the network of UNESCO geopark requires that certain criteria are met:[22]\n\nMake an inquiry broad in all more than 30 municipalities involved.\n\nJoining the private and government municipalities, State and Union\n\nCreate an economically sustainable model, using the Tourism, Research and Education in Paleontology.\n\nTourism should be a source of revenue to cover the cost of Research and Education.\n\nHelp preserve the fossil heritage for future generations.\n\nThe certification is an endorsement of UNESCO for the tourist and ensures that there is a geopark in responsible tourism and an infrastructure to receive tourists.\n\nThe Paleorrota Group gathers people of central Rio Grande do Sul, through an electronic mailing list on the internet. Lack involvement of public institutions such as the Secretariat of Tourism of Rio Grande do Sul, Federation of Associations of Municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul and Company Mineral Resources Research. You need the involvement of state legislators and the Legislative Assembly of Rio Grande do Sul to legislate on the subject. All this makes the existing projects to progress slowly.\n\nCurrently the demand of tourists is very low, but with potential to grow. The demand is not growing due to lack of investment in tourist attractions that can only be realized with the joint efforts of private and public power. For the geopark become economically sustainable, it is necessary that the current demand of 10 thousand tourists a year rise to 150 thousand tourists annually, to go beyond the break-even. If each gaucho visited the region once in a lifetime, this point would be reached, it shows that there is much room to grow economically.[23]\n\nThe projects Paleorrota Geopark,[24] Institute Paleorrota[25] and Highway of dinossaurs,[26][27] are intended to create economic sustainability for this paleorrota.\n\nAdministration[]\n\nCurrently there is no Management Unit, as determined by UNESCO, which administers the geopark. This problem occurs because the state managers do not engage much with this World Heritage Site.\n\nCAPPA - Support Center for Paleontological Research[]\n\nMaximiliano Vizzotto street, 598. Seated in the city of São João do Polêsine in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, not far from the Monument of Nossa Senhora da Salete close to highway RS 149.\n\nThe facility will occupy 2.649 m² and its construction is divided into three stages with the first was completed in early 2009. Also at this time began to define the goals and purposes intitucionais.[28]\n\nThis venture has the sponsorship of Petrobras and Eletrobras.[29]\n\nFossils of the region[]\n\nIn the area north of the geopark, dating from the Triassic and in the past consisted of rivers and lakes with oxygen and carbonate (alkaline) which facilitated the preservation of bones, but deteriorated easily the weakest parts of the plant and animal tissues. Only tree trunks with Permineralization survived into the rivers of Santa Maria Formation and Caturrita Formation.\n\nAlready the south is the area dating from the Permian, with the Rio do Rasto Formation and Rio Bonito Formation. Were composed of mangroves and swamps with acidic and anoxic waters that facilitated the preservation of fragile tissues such as leaves, seeds, pollens and spores. But easily destroyed bone.\n\nThe vertebrate fossils are found in reddish soil-like bedrock. Depending on the process of fossilization, they will have certain characteristics:\n\nWithout calcium carbonate the fossils will take on a white color and are easily dissolved in water.\n\nWith calcium carbonate the fossils will show the color of brown rust, and have the form of concrete because of the calcium carbonate. When a fossil has the ideal amount of carbonate, the fossil is undeformed, and does not dissolve in water. But excess of carbonate will deform the fossil, giving it a swollen appearance. If there is a very large quantity of carbonate, the fossil takes on a dusty outer surface which dissolves in water.\n\nAnother important feature is caused by slow creep. During the millions of years that the fossils have been embedded in the ground the slow creeping movement of the ground has created ripples in the fossils and given them a wavy appearance.\n\nMost of the bedrock in the region is covered by soil. Only one percent of the bedrock is exposed in creeks, streams, lakes and roads.\n\nGeological formations and biozone[]\n\nThe region has many formations such as Santa Maria Formation, Caturrita Formation, Sanga do Cabral Formation, Rio do Rasto Formation, Irati Formation and the Rio Bonito Formation. These are the main formations with the principles kinds of animals found in them:[30]\n\nWood: This biozone is characterized by the presence of a lot of petrified wood.\n\nMammals: This biozone is where they begin to appear modern mammals (Procolophon, Temnospondyli, dicynodonts, cynodonts and archosaurs).\n\nRhynchosauria: biozone with a predominance of Rhynchosaurs (Rhynchosaurs, archosaurs and Cynodonts).\n\nTraversodontidae: biozone with traversodonts cynodonts (cynodonts and archosaurs).\n\nTherapsids: Prevalence of Dinodontosaurus and Massetognathus. (Procolophon, dicynodonts, cynodonts, archosaurs and Rhynchosaurs)\n\nProcolophon: Predominant Procolophon. Much material is fragmented and often difficult to classify. (Temnospondyli, Procolophon, non-mammalian Cynodonts indeterminate and Prolacertiformes indeterminate).\n\nPareiasaurus: biozone of Pareiasaurus.\n\nMesosaurus: biozone of Mesosaurus.\n\nPlants: Prevalence plants Glossopteris, Cordaites, Gangamopteris and Brasilodendron.\n\nGeological Map of Rio Grande do Sul.File:Mapa geologico do Rio Grande do Sul - Brasil.JPG\n\nRecent alluvial deposits.\n\nCenozoic Sedimentary rock.\n\nContinental magmatism.\n\nParaná Sedimentary basin (Paleorrota).\n\nCamaquã Sedimentary basin.\n\nDomain Pelotas.\n\nDomain Encruzilhada do Sul.\n\nDomain São Gabriel.\n\nDomain Taquarembó.\n\nLegislation[]\n\nSince the 1940s, federal legislation has protected the fossils as property of the Union. In 2001, state legislation was passed to protect the fossils of Paleorrota. In general, it states:\n\nThe fossils are a cultural heritage of the state.\n\nThe fossils can only be collected by paleontologists or technicians who are working for officially recognized institutions.\n\nForeign institutions are only to support an institution's research endeavour.\n\nA visit to Paleontological Sites can only be performed in the company of someone authorized.\n\nTransport of fossils can only be done under authorization with a return guarantee.\n\nThe only economic activities to be carried out are tours with authorized guides.\n\nThe complete legislation is found with the Brazilian Society of Paleontology.[31]\n\nVideos about Paleorrota[]\n\nVideo of the program on Rede Globo Fantástico, aired on May 16, 2010.\n\nFound ancient dinosaur fossil in Brazil.\n\nThis is a television series developed by the RBS Group together with the Geosciences Institute, UFRGS. It depicts the animals and dinosaurs found in the Geopark of Paleorrota.\n\nSee also[]\n\nTemplate:Wikipedia books\n\nNotes and references[]\n\nTemplate:Commons category\n\n[]\n\nTemplate:Cities of Paleorrota Template:Fauna and Flora of Paleorrota Geopark"
