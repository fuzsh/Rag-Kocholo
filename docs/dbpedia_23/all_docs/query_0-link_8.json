It was a relatively early member of the also extinct order of Multituberculata. It lived in obscurity in southern England during 'the age of the dinosaurs'.\n\n(For the more technically inclined, suborder \"Plagiaulacida\", family Paulchoffatiidae.)\n\nGenus: Sunnyodon Kielan-Jaworowska Z & Ensom PC, 1992\n\n'Sunny tooth' (named after Sunnydown Farm)\n\nSpecies: Sunnyodon notleyi Kielan-Jaworowska Z & Ensom PC, 1992\n\nPlace: Purbeck Formation, Durlston Bay, Dorset\n\nCountry: England\n\nAge: Upper Jurassic? or Lower Cretaceous\n\nRemarks: This is a tooth based genus. According to current understanding, this Formation is now considered to be early Lower Cretaceous, (personal communication, PC Ensom).\n\nReference: Kielan-Jaworowska & Ensom (1992), Multituberculate Mammals from the Upper Jurassic Purbeck Limestone Formation of southern England.
