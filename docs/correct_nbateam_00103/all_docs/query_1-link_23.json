        "text": "Michael Jordan’s Charlotte Bobcats made NBA history with a 7-59 record slips their winning percent below the 1972-73 Philadelphia 76ers, who went 9-73\n\nBy Rick Bonnell\n\nThe Charlotte Observer\n\nCHARLOTTE- Twenty-three consecutive losses later, the Charlotte Bobcats made NBA history.\n\nThey haven’t won since March 17 and they won’t win again for at least seven months. This season-closing loss – 104-84 at home to the New York Knicks – means they finish the season with the worst winning percentage in NBA history.\n\nA 7-59 record in this lockout-shortened season (a .106 winning percent) slips below the 1972-73 Philadelphia 76ers, who went 9-73 (.110).\n\n“The season itself was a long haul for all of us – upstairs and downstairs,’’ said coach Paul Silas, who might have coached his last NBA game. His contract expires after this season. “Being the worst team in the history of the game is not something you cherish.’’\n\nThe Knicks, playing without stars Carmelo Anthony and Tyson Chandler, took control in the last three minutes of the third quarter and the first minute of the fourth. A three-pointer by New York point guard Mike Bibby topped off a 15-5 run for a 79-64 lead with 11 minutes left.\n\nJ.R. Smith (22 points) and Amare Stoudemire (21 points) attacked the rim relentlessly in that span, with Stoudemire drawing oooohs when he dunked emphatically over Bobcats forward Tyrus Thomas.\n\nShooting guard Gerald Henderson led the Bobcats with 21 points. Before the game, he addressed the crowd, saying, “I know it’s been a tough year. We’ll be working all summer to turn this thing around.’’\n\nBy losing, the Bobcats assured themselves a dubious place in the NBA’s 66-year history. Surely this had to embarrass team owner Michael Jordan, who watched the game from a suite. As NBA deputy commissioner Adam Silver observed before the game, Hall of Famer Jordan “probably is one of the most competitive people in the planet.’’\n\nThe 1972-73 76ers finally were free of a dubious distinction. Fred Carter has been famously portrayed for decades as the best player on the worst team. Carter told The Charlotte Observer in February he strongly doubted the Bobcats were a worse team than those 76ers.\n\n“If I was their best player, you know we didn’t have much talent,’’ Carter said. “I could score 20 points a game, but I never made a teammate better.’’\n\nIn some ways, the margins by which the Bobcats lost might be more damning than their final record: They lost 22 games (a third of the schedule) by20 or more points and nine games by 30 or more points.\n\nThe Bobcats’ point-differential – minus-13.8 points per game heading into the finale – was the second-worst since the NBA’s merger with the American Basketball Association in 1976. Only the 1992-93 Dallas Mavericks were worse, with a minus-15.2 point-differential.\n\nhttp://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/04/26/3202040/with-59-losses-bobcats-take-futility.html\n\nNew York Knicks’ Amare Stoudemire (1) dunks as Charlotte Bobcats’ Tyrus Thomas (12), Byron Mullens (22) and Bismack Biyombo (0) watch during the first half of an NBA basketball game in Charlotte, N.C., Thursday, April 26, 2012.

While the Hornets were based in Charlotte they qualified for the post-season 7 times and compiled an overall record of 542–574 out of 14 seasons.\n\nIn the Charlotte Hornets first season (1988-1989) they would have a record of 20-62 with a winning percentage of .244\n\nIn the Charlotte Hornets last season (2001-02) they would have a record of 44-38 with a winning percentage of .537 and lost in the NBA playoffs’ Eastern Conference Semifinals\n\nCharlotte Hornets post season years were:\n\n1992-93\n\n1994-95\n\n1996-97\n\n1997-98\n\n1999-2000\n\n2000-01\n\n2001-02\n\nPaul Silas\n\nPaul Silas is the current head coach of the Charlotte Bobcats also was head coach of the Charlotte Hornets and New Orleans Hornets from 1998–2003.\n\nSalis played in the NBA from 1964-1980. He also coached the San Diego Clippers (now LA Clippers) 1980–1983 and Cleveland Cavaliers from 2003–2005. He was a nominee for the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame Class of 2012. In order to gain entry into the Hall of Fame, each person will need to receive 7 of 9 votes from a screening committee to become a finalist, and then receive 18 of 24 votes from the Honors Committee to be chosen for induction in April.\n\nThe Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame announced on April 2 the 12 members of the Class of 2012 to be honored September 6-8, 2012 during this year’s Enshrinement Ceremonies. The inductees include 5-time NBA All-Star Reggie Miller, the NBA’s all-time winningest coach Don Nelson, 3-time National College Player of the Year Ralph Sampson, 2-time Olympic gold medalist Katrina McClain, distinguished basketball official and coordinator Hank Nichols, former college and NBA star Jamaal Wilkes and the first women’s professional basketball team, the All American Red Heads. They join the five directly elected members who were announced during the NBA All-Star Weekend in February 2012. These direct-elects include Mel Daniels voted in from the American Basketball Association (ABA) Committee, Don Barksdale from the Early African American Pioneers Committee, Lidia Alexeeva from the International Committee, Chet Walker from the Veterans Committee and Phil Knight from the Contributor Direct Election Committee.\n\nNelly joined a group of investors as part owner of the Charlotte Bobcats in 2004.\n\nIn 2010 Michael Jordan successfully purchased the Charlotte Bobcats from Robert (Bob) Johnson, an NBA team he had essentially run for 3 years. The NBA’s Board of Governors unanimously approved Jordan’s $275 million bid to buy the Charlotte Bobcats. Jordan became an equity partner in 2006, taking over basketball operations, which meant implementing his own front office (led by old friend Rod Higgins). Jordan is the first ex-player to be a majority owner in the league.\n\nJordan assumed about $150 million in debt in the deal and became the 2nd black majority owner of a major pro sports team. He replaced the first in Bob Johnson, who paid $300 million for the Charlotte expansion franchise. Charlotte fans did not warm up to Bob Johnson and Bob did not seem to like Charlotte.\n\nMichael Jordan spent a season-and-a-half with the Washington Wizards as team president and later as a part-time player. While the Wizards were attractive at the box office, they were horrible as a team. Jordan himself, as a player, led the Chicago Bulls to an NBA-record 72 wins during the 1995-96 regular season.\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nMay 8, 2003\n\nD.C. ya\n\nJust like that, Jordan is done\n\nThe Chicago Tribune\n\nImagine that, an NBA team showing Michael Jordan the door. Even he was shocked. The Washington Wizards abruptly dumped basketball’s most popular figure Wednesday, ending a relationship that produced much fanfare but little success over 3 1/2 seasons. Disappointed with the team’s poor record and embarrassed by infighting on and off the court, owner Abe Pollin told Jordan about his decision in a 30-minute meeting at the team’s arena. “Today, without any prior discussion with me, ownership informed me that it had unilaterally decided to change our mutual long-term understanding,” Jordan said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n“I am shocked by this decision, and by the callous refusal to offer me any justification for it.”\n\nRobert Johnson, new owner of the Charlotte NBA franchise, said Wednesday that Jordan can have “any role he wants to play.” He and Jordan have already had discussions, a person with knowledge of the talks told The Associated Press on Sunday on condition of anonymity.\n\nA Wizards source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the AP that Pollin’s decision was based on three factors: player dissension, a franchise faltering after the years of Jordan in charge, and deteriorating relationships throughout the organization.\n\nThe source said no decision has been made about the front-office people Jordan hired, or whether Jordan’s hand-picked coach, Doug Collins, will remain for the final two years of his contract.\n\nPollin’s statement implied that his decision was made with minority partner Ted Leonsis, saying that: “In the end, Ted and I felt that this franchise should move in a different direction.”\n\nDuring the meeting, Pollin offered Jordan a $10 million severance payment, according to the source, but Jordan turned it down.\n\nLeonsis had no comment.\n\nJordan led the Chicago Bulls to six NBA titles in the 1990s but never came close to duplicating that in Washington. He transformed the Wizards from a largely ignored mess into a very public one.\n\nThe Wizards haven’t won a playoff game since 1988, and the franchise’s only NBA title came in 1978 as the Bullets.\n\nJordan put the franchise back on the map when he was hired in January 2000, but his record was just 110-179 as the top decision-maker, a role he kept even after returning as a player.\n\nHamstrung by the Wizards salary-cap problems, he eventually overhauled the roster. Jahidi White is the only pre-Jordan player left.\n\nHis biggest flop? Kwame Brown has done little since being the No. 1 overall pick in the 2001 draft.\n\nOf course, Jordan’s biggest personnel move came when he returned as a player.\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nThe Charlotte Bobcats reached the NBA playoffs 2 years ago under Jordan, who became majority owner in March 2010.\n\nThe top 6 players from that team were traded or waived. Stephen Jackson (San Antonio), Gerald Wallace (New Jersey), Raymond Felton (Portland), Boris Diaw (Sacramento), Nazr Mohammed (Oklahoma City) and Tyson Chandler (New York).\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nCharlotte Bobcats would not finish last in attendance in 2012\n\nAtlanta Hawks, who are 40-26 at the end of the regular season, clinched home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs finished the season having the team with the 8th lowest attendance. Charlotte is 6th and the New Orleans Hornets are 7th.\n\n2012 NBA Season Attendance Home RK TEAM GMS TOTAL AVG 1 Bulls 33 731,326 22,161 2 Trail Blazers 33 676,384 20,496 3 Mavericks 33 671,050 20,334 4 Heat 33 657,855 19,935 5 NY Knicks 33 652,179 19,763 6 Jazz 33 637,124 19,306 7 Clippers 33 634,237 19,219 8 Lakers 33 626,901 18,997 9 Magic 33 623,587 18,896 10 Warriors 33 622,311 18,857 11 Celtics 33 614,592 18,624 12 Spurs 33 607,095 18,396 13 Thunder 33 600,699 18,203 14 76ers 33 577,597 17,502 15 Timberwolves 33 577,197 17,490 16 Nuggets 33 561,966 17,029 17 Raptors 33 555,584 16,835 18 Wizards 33 552,038 16,728 19 Cavaliers 33 525,577 15,926 20 Grizzlies 33 518,256 15,704 21 Suns 33 514,718 15,597 22 Rockets 33 506,994 15,363 23 Hawks 33 501,593 15,199 24 Hornets 33 498,618 15,109 25 Bobcats 33 486,984 14,757 26 Bucks 33 485,717 14,718 27 Kings 33 478,764 14,508 28 Pistons 33 475,638 14,413 29 Pacers 33 467,561 14,168 30 Nets 33 460,719 13,961\n\nThe Charlotte Bobcats has taken this ad out in The Charlotte Observer’s newspaper online website thanking fans for their support.\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nNow might just be the best time for Charlotte to request the NBA to have the “Hornets” name back\n\nThe New Orleans Hornets new owner Tom Benson, also the owner of the New Orleans Saints, wants to change the name of his new NBA team. A group called We Beelieve is trying to bring the Hornets name back to Charlotte.\n\nSee link:\n\nhttps://dilemma-x.net/2012/04/14/new-orleans-saints-owner-tom-benson-buys-new-orleans-hornets-from-nba/\n\nEven Michael Jordan wears shirt that only calls the team “CATS” not “Bobcats”. The franchise team received its name when Bob Johnson owned the franchise and many say the teams name stood for “Bob’s Cats”\n\nIn this March 9, 2012, file photo, Charlotte Bobcats’ owner Michael Jordan gestures at the referees during the first half of an NBA basketball game against the New Jersey Nets in Charlotte, N.C.(AP Photo/Bob Leverone)\n\nCam Newton, quarterback for the NFL Carolina Panthers, does not even wear a Charlotte Bobcats hat while he sits on the front of a home Charlotte Bobcats game in TimeWarner Cable Arena.\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nHere is the complete schedule and national television & radio arrangements for the 2012 NBA playoffs.\n\nWESTERN CONFERENCE – FIRST ROUND\n\nSan Antonio vs. Utah\n\nGame 1 – Sun.
