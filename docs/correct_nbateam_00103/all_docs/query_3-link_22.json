        "text": "No, John Calipari will not be adding another legacy recruit to the Kentucky basketball program. The son of a Wildcat legend, though, will be making his college decision in the coming days. And he’s got a list of solid options.\n\nSir Mohammed, son of two-time NCAA champion Nazr Mohammed, is set to make his commitment at the start of the Boys Elite 24 game on Saturday at 8 p.m. ET live on ESPNU. The four-star recruit is set to choose between finalists Notre Dame, Stanford, Virginia Tech, Villanova and Marquette.\n\nMohammed is listed at No. 67 overall and No. 23 among small forwards in the 2024 On3 Industry Ranking, a proprietary algorithm that compiles ratings and rankings from all four primary recruiting media services.\n\nNazr Mohammed’s career at Kentucky and in the NBA\n\nThe four-star recruit’s father, Nazr, played at Kentucky from 1995-98, winning two titles with the Wildcats in 1996 and 1998. Playing sparingly his first season in Lexington, he would go on to become a key contributor in the frontcourt his sophomore and junior campaigns. He averaged 7.9 points and 5.8 rebounds in 15.8 minutes per contest in year two, then a career-high 12.0 points and 7.2 rebounds in 21.0 minutes per game in year three.\n\nTurning pro at the conclusion of the 1997-98 season, Mohammed was taken No. 29 overall by the Utah Jazz in the first round of the 1998 NBA Draft. He would go on to play for eight different NBA teams over 18 seasons in the league, averaging 5.8 points and 4.7 rebounds across 1,005 career games. His most successful season in the NBA came in 2001-02 when he averaged 9.7 points and 7.9 rebounds in 26.4 minutes per game with the Atlanta Hawks. He also played for the Philadelphia 76ers, New York Knicks, San Antonio Spurs, Detroit Pistons, Charlotte Bobcats, Oklahoma City Thunder and Chicago Bulls.\n\nThe 6-foot-10, 250-pound center would rack up a total of $65,514,967 in career earnings in the NBA.\n\nWhat is the former Wildcat up to now? Mohammed is the current general manager of the Oklahoma City Blue and a pro scout for the Thunder. Not a bad life for the 45-year-old out of Chicago.\n\nSir Mohammed breaks down his recruitment\n\nAs for his son, Sir has a decision to make.\n\nMohammed recently broke down his finalists with On3:\n\nNotre Dame: “My relationship with Coach (Micah) Shrewsberry has been great the whole time, even throughout the switch. I love the staff there. He sees me as a lead guard who can do a lot on the floor. He sees me doing a lot of the same things I do with Team Curry.”\n\nStanford: “Their guys there are really cool. The coaching staff at Stanford is amazing. They’ve been on me really hard. I really enjoyed my time there.”\n\nVirginia Tech: “For me, Virginia Tech has been on me since I was a pup. They started talking to us in the fall of my sophomore year. They’ve made me feel like family. And they trust me as a lead guard. A lot of schools don’t think I’m a lead guard. I appreciate them for that.”\n\nVillanova: “My relationship with Kyle Neptune is amazing. At the same time, it is a program like Villanova, so how can you not be interested in playing there? They are such a prestigious program that just wins basketball games.”\n\nMarquette: “Their staff has been great to me so far. You know, they’ve been here watching me, and they came in on an in-home visit, and I really just connected with their coaches. You saw their success this year, so I trust what they’re doing there.”\n\nWe’ll find out where he’s going on Saturday."
