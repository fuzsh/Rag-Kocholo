        "text": "For the first time in 2010-11, you could say this definitively: The Heat won a game that, the previous two seasons, it would have lost.\n\nIt didn't win impressively.\n\nIt didn't win aesthetically.\n\nBut it did win Friday, surviving 95-87 against the Charlotte Bobcats after squandering a 21-point lead.\n\nIt won with Dwyane Wade at far less than his best, flustered by the flu, sweating profusely even after prolonged breaks, and misfiring on his last nine shots. It won against a defensive-minded team with two versatile wings, a team that Wade and LeBron James each dropped three of four games against last season as the sole superstars on their respective squads.\n\nIt won because of the roster overhaul, and the presence of James (32 points) and Chris Bosh (22 points, 14 rebounds, 8-of-8 from the line) to pick up a weakened Wade, and save the Heat from another embarrassing defeat before it headed to Memphis.\n\n\"Dwyane was really exhausted. You could see that in the fourth quarter,\" coach Erik Spoelstra said.\n\nHe wasn't a sure thing to start, or even play. Thursday, he tweeted: \"On all kinda meds. Not feeling great. Flu season in here. Everybody take care of yourselves.\"\n\nAfter he missed shootaround, Spoelstra took precautions, writing out three different lineup cards. Only one had Wade in it.\n\nAt about 4 p.m., Wade decided to play.\n\n\"Having the luxury of having these two All-Stars to play, I knew I wouldn't have to do what I did in the past, and that was to score 30,\" Wade said.\n\nStill, it was easy to suspect he might, considering his flair for the dramatic, and considering the opponent (Michael Jordan's Bobcats, even if Jordan was not in attendance). Something akin to one of Jordan's signature efforts, the 38 points that the legend scored while batting a severe stomach flu in Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals.\n\nEarly on, Wade was active and efficient, and even snapped right back after a nasty shoulder-first spill on an offensive foul. He wasn't the Heat's primary playmaker - that was James, who has struggled against Larry Brown defenses in recent years, but played a role in 21 of the Heat's first quarter points with either a basket of his own or an assist.\n\n\"I started strong,\" James said.\n\nSo did the rest of the team. And so, at halftime, it seemed that Wade could sip chicken soup from a court-side seat until the contest's conclusion. The Heat led 56-37, with 38 points from the Big Three alone, led by James' 16.\n\nThen, the second half began. And, as was the case against Utah 10 days earlier, the offense had all the flow of the Dead Sea.\n\n\"They grinded us,\" Spoelstra said.\n\nThe Bobcats cut the lead to nine at the end of the third quarter. Wade kept missing. The ball wasn't moving. Charlotte pulled ahead, 82-80. Wade intercepted Charlotte's attempted alley-oop, and James hung and hit in the lane for a 86-83 Heat lead. Still, Charlotte hung in. Stephen Jackson (30 points) cut it to one.\n\nOnly after Bosh made four free throws, Udonis Haslem took a charge, and James Jones nailed a three-pointer (with a 19.1 seconds left) was victory secured.\n\n\"Limit teams to one shot and rebound the basketball at the end of the game,\" Bosh said of the goal. \"We did a very good job of that in the last two or three minutes.\"\n\nEven with No. 3 scoring only 11.\n\n\"We have other weapons,\" Spoelstra said.\n\nThose were just enough, on a night when Wade waged war with his body.\n\n~ethan_skolnick@pbpost.com"
