        "text": "SOUTH BEND — Get in on the ground floor as a foundational piece to what Micah Shrewsberry is building with the Notre Dame men’s basketball team or go elsewhere and be just another face at another place.\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina high school senior Nasir “Sir” Mohammed preferred option No. 1, so the 6-foot-6, 200-pound guard committed late Saturday night to the Irish.\n\nMohammed made his announcement in what was supposed to be the Boys Elite 24 all-star game in Atlanta sponsored by Under Armour. Notre Dame has been an Under Armour school since 2013 and recently reupped with the company for 10 more seasons.\n\nComing aboard: Notre Dame men's basketball bounces back to familiar commitment territory\n\nThe game — and Mohammed’s college reveal — didn’t come off without a hitch. Scheduled to start at 8 p.m., the exhibition didn’t tip until 9:30. It was stopped (and eventually canceled) with four minutes and change remaining in the 20-minute first half due to condensation on the court. The games (a girl's all-star game never was played) were held on an outdoor court in downtown Atlanta.\n\nRather than getting a solo spotlight before tip to make his college choice public, Mohammed was allotted a 10-second window late in the first half to tell ESPN commentator Robbie Hummel that he was going to Notre Dame. ESPNU then cut to a commercial break. That was it.\n\nIt was all very different in a weird sort of way. For Mohammed, it was memorable.\n\n“That was pretty sick,” he said late Sunday morning. “It was cool to do it on ESPNU, but I’m not a crazy talkative guy. I said maybe two words. It was still a pretty cool experience.\n\n“It’s a good story to tell.”\n\nThere might be many a good story to tell of Mohammed as he moves forward in his basketball career. A second team, all-state choice following his junior season, Mohammed averaged 13.5 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 1.9 steals in 24.0 minutes per game for a Myers Park (N.C.) High School team that finished 28-4 overall and 12-0 in conference play. He chose Notre Dame over a final five that included Marquette, Stanford, Virginia Tech and Oklahoma. He made an official campus visit in mid-July.\n\nNoie: Different day, direction for Notre Dame men's basketball program\n\nHow did he wind up at Notre Dame? Easy.\n\n“Coach Shrews,” he said of the first-year Irish head coach. “He got me up there, but once I got to campus, I was like, ‘This is where I want to be.’ I don’t know what it was. It just clicked.”\n\nAs did the thought of playing for Notre Dame, whatever that may entail in terms of wins and losses down the line. The Irish finished 11-21 overall and 3-17 in the Atlantic Coast Conference last season and are in complete rebuild mode in Shrewsberry’s first season. They may stay in that territory when Mohammed arrives, but that doesn’t matter.\n\nOne day, he believes Notre Dame will be back in the NCAA tournament and back chasing Sweet 16s and Elites Eights and maybe beyond. Mohammed wants to be part of the crew that builds everything back to those places.\n\n“That’s definitely something I’m excited to do,” he said. “It kind of reminds me of my high school team. We were all very young when we started, then junior year, we won a state championship. You start off young, but just keep growing, just keep getting better.”\n\nWhat is Notre Dame getting in Mohammed? Easy. A basketball player. He can play either guard position. He can play some small forward. This season at Myers Park, he may even see time as the backup center. But he’s best with the ball in his hands. Consider him a basketball player, but with a heavy point guard emphasis.\n\nMohammed first had the ball put in his hands four games into his first season at Myers Park as a 14-year-old prep freshman. He delivered.\n\n“He’s a decision-maker more than anything,” Myers Park coach Scott Taylor told the Tribune. “You put him in positions to manipulate the defense and he’s going to find the right guy He’s one of the better teammates I’ve been around at any level.”\n\nConsidered a four-star recruit by the three major recruiting services – ESPN, Rivals and 247 Sports − Mohammed is ranked the No. 42 prospect in the country by 247Sports, No. 56 by Rivals and No. 71 by ESPN. He is the son of former Kentucky center Nazr Mohammed, who played for eight NBA teams over 18 seasons before retiring in 2016.\n\nThe elder Mohammed’s best friend in the Charlotte area is former Notre Dame guard Matt Carroll, a former teammate with the Charlotte Bobcats. Sir Mohammed considered Carroll’s son, Matty, like a little brother.\n\n“They’re probably more excited about me going to Notre Dame than I am,” Mohammed said. “Matt always said that it was a super-special place.”\n\nMohammed is the first son of a former NBA player to commit to Notre Dame since … May. Calvin Booth, the father of Irish freshman Carey Booth, who followed Shrewsberry from Penn State, is the general manager of the NBA champion Denver Nuggets. Nazr Mohammed is the general manager for the Oklahoma City Blue of the G League and a Thunder scout.\n\nMohammed’s commitment comes on the heels of Shrewsberry securing word just over 48 hours earlier from 6-11 power forward Garrett Sundra, from Fairfax, Virginia. He’s considered a four-star prospect (No. 92 overall) by ESPN, three stars (118 overall) by 247Sports and three stars (unranked) by rivals.com.\n\nMohammed and Sundra join a 2024 Irish recruiting class that includes shooting guard Cole Certa from Bloomington, Illinois, who became the first high school junior to commit to Shrewsberry as the Notre Dame coach in early May. Certa is considered a four-star prospect (No. 90 overall) by 247Sports and three stars (unranked) by Rivals, He’ll play his senior season at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida.\n\nCerta and Mohammed were roommates and teammates at the UA event last week. The two talked for months about playing together in college, so Mohammed’s announcement was no surprise.\n\n“It was cool to be with him when I made it official,” Mohammed said.\n\nNotre Dame’s 2024 recruiting class currently ranks No. 5 by 247Sports and No. 12 by Rivals.com.\n\n“It should stay that way,” Mohammed said of the lofty ranking. “We’ve got three really good pieces who all do something different and bring something different to the table. It’s exciting.”\n\nFollow South Bend Tribune and NDInsider columnist Tom Noie on Twitter: @tnoieNDI. Contact: (574) 235-6153."
