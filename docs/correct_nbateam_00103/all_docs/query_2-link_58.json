        "text": "A two-time National Champion at Kentucky is rising through the professional ranks… in the front office.\n\nNazr Mohammed was a part of Kentucky’s 1996 and 1998 National Championships before he was selected with the 29th pick of the 1998 NBA Draft. The seven-foot center spent 18 years playing for eight different NBA teams before retiring in 2016 as a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nHe didn’t have to go far to find a post-playing career path. Nazr remained with the Thunder organization, spending the last four years going through what OKC describes as “an extensive post-playing transition program for former players with a curriculum designed by the team to prepare them for a transition to basketball operations.”\n\nMohammed’s next role — he will serve as the general manager for the Oklahoma City Blue, the Thunder’s G League affiliate. He’ll continue working directly with Thunder GM Sam Presti as a pro player personnel evaluator.\n\nMany folks believe Kenny Payne is the key piece of the puzzle that will bring all of the talented former Wildcats to one place. Already with three ex-Cats on the OKC roster, if Mohammed continues to climb the front office ladder, maybe Nazr becomes the catalyst that brings the BBNBA together."
