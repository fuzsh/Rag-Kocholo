        "text": "An hour before tipoff Saturday night, Charlotte center Byron Mullens couldn't take three steps inside Chesapeake Energy Arena without someone stopping him dead in his tracks.\n\nFans lined the tunnel wanting autographs, season ticket-holders and ushers shared smiles and Thunder team personnel demanded hugs.\n\nIt was quite a welcome back for a fourth-string center who played 26 total games in two seasons in OKC.\n\nInside the Charlotte locker room sat D.J. White, another former Thunder player.\n\nThe pleasantries soon ended as OKC cruised to a 122-95 victory over the woeful Bobcats, who have the league's worst record at 5-34.\n\nWhite had 10 points (4 for 7 shooting), five rebounds and two steals in 22 minutes. Mullens had 12 points (6 for 8) and three rebounds in 19 minutes.\n\nWith the Thunder, White and Mullens rarely saw this many minutes on the court.\n\nWhite missed 75 games his rookie season due to jaw surgery. He played 12 games the next season while battling a thumb injury and played 23 games the following season before being traded.\n\nWhite was dealt to the Bobcats on Feb. 24, 2010, along with guard Morris Peterson in exchange for center Nazr Mohammed. Mullens was traded to the Bobcats for a second-round pick in 2013, six days before this season began.\n\nThunder general manager Sam Presti orchestrated both trades for the same reason. Though he liked White and Mullens, Presti didn't envision much playing time for either and traded them knowing they could prove themselves with more minutes.\n\n\"As much as I loved it here, I wanted to play,\" explained the 6-foot-9, 251-pound White, the 29th overall pick in the 2008 draft, who played for former Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson at Indiana. \"I know it's a business. Nine times out of 10, I wasn't going to be here for forever anyway. I love the guys here, but I have to do what's best for me.\"\n\nMullens said he understood Presti's reasoning. \"And I appreciated it,\" said Mullens, the 24th pick in the 2009 draft after his freshman season at Ohio State. \"I knew he was doing it for my best interest. He told me if the deal wasn't going through with Charlotte, he was going to try to get me somewhere else. I thanked him for it. I don't tell him that enough, but I should text him every once in a while or call him. He knew I could play and he knew I needed to be on the court.\n\n\"It just wasn't going to happen here (OKC), not now at least. I told Sam, 'Maybe in the future, if there's a chance for me to come back, that'd be awesome.' \"\n\nWhite and Mullens said they stay in contact with their former teammates and had a chance to catch up after Saturday's game. Rather than flying to New Orleans for its Monday night game against the Hornets, Charlotte spent Saturday night in OKC.\n\nDuring halftime warmups, Mullens walked over to the Thunder bench and hugged coach Scott Brooks. After the game, Mullens returned to the OKC bench and hugged everybody he could find.\n\nWhite admits he follows Thunder results closely. \"Oh, yeah. I check them out all the time,\" White said. \"I was pulling for those guys last year in the playoffs. I pull for them all the time, just not when we play them. I'm always going to pull for those guys. We're going to be close, no matter what.\"\n\nAlso in Charlotte is general manager Rich Cho, who previously spent 10 seasons as the assistant general manager with the Seattle SuperSonics/Thunder."
