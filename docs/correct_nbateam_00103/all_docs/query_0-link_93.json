        "text": "The Associated Press\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. — It didn't take the Knicks long to get back to their dysfunctional ways.\n\nTwo nights after a rare good performance, the uninspired play, the missed shots and the bad defense returned.\n\nSo did the bickering.\n\nGerald Wallace scored 27 points and the Charlotte Bobcats dominated New York 105-95 last night in a night that included a heated exchange between embattled Knicks coach Isiah Thomas and forward Quentin Richardson.\n\nWhile both Thomas and Richardson tried to downplay the expletive-filled third-quarter argument that included assistant coach Herb Williams holding back Thomas, the Knicks are clearly in disarray — again.\n\n\"Sometimes you try to say some things to a player or say some things to your team just to get them motivated, to get some fire in them,\" Thomas said when asked to explain the incident. \"There won't be any carry-over from it.\"\n\nThere wasn't any carry-over for the Knicks' blowout win over Cleveland on Wednesday, which came two days after Thomas questioned his team's heat and toughness.\n\nPlaying again without Stephon Marbury, who continues to grieve his father's death, the Knicks were consistently beaten off the dribble and allowed the Bobcats free reign inside.\n\nNazr Mohammed added 20 points and 14 rebounds and Jason Richardson and Emeka Okafor scored 17 points apiece for the Bobcats, who rolled out to a 24-point second-quarter lead.\n\nCharlotte, the league's second-lowest scoring team, scored 67 points in the first half and shot 50 percent for only the second time this season.\n\nWhile the Knicks made it respectable late, the game was never in doubt as Charlotte won its second straight game since part-owner Michael Jordan practiced with the team.\n\nJordan's former playing rival had another nightmarish night. Calls for Thomas' ouster followed him on the road, as one fan in a Knicks jersey held up a sign reading \"Hey Isiah, Santa's got your pink slip.\"\n\nThomas, who rarely got off the bench, did get irritated with Quentin Richardson near the bench, and the forward never returned to the game after the incident.\n\nQuentin Richardson insisted it was \"no big deal\" and said everything was fine with Thomas.\n\n\"Why wouldn't we be?\" he said. \"Are you not going to be OK with your sister or your brother or whoever you get in a misunderstanding with? We're OK.\"\n\nThe team isn't. Nate Robinson scored 20 points for the Knicks, who dropped to 1-10 on the road.\n\nJamal Crawford added 16 points and Zach Randolph scored 15, but they combined to shoot 11-for-30.\n\n\"I thought that the whole group was bad, frankly,\" Thomas said. \"We just had no fire, no competitiveness.\"\n\nNotes — Marbury missed his seventh game in the past 10."
