        "text": "CHICAGO — The magic, Chicago Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau likes to say, is in the effort.\n\nAnd as the gallant Bulls have displayed over and over, they turned in another A-plus effort.\n\nThey just failed to complete the trick.\n\nThe Miami Heat defeated Chicago 104-94 in Game 3 on Friday, taking a 2-1 series lead in their best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal series. Game 4 is Monday in Chicago (7 p.m. ET, TNT).\n\nThe Heat wrestled away home-court advantage after losing it in Chicago's Game 1 victory. The team with home-court advantage is 91-25 (78.4%) in conference semifinal series games since the 16-team playoff format began in 1984.\n\nThe Heat should consider themselves fortunate. The Bulls contained Heat forward LeBron James and guard Dwyane Wade and relied on outstanding performances from center Chris Bosh and backup point guard Norris Cole.\n\n\"Nothing's going to be easy in this series, and this is another example of that,\" Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. \"We just have to find a way. We didn't play particularly well. A lot of that had to do with Chicago. Just a lot of ebbs and flows most of the game. But in the fourth quarter we found a way even if it wasn't the previous way.\"\n\nBosh had 20 points and 19 rebounds, and Cole added 18 points in another strong game for the growing second-year pro.\n\n\"It was important,\" Spoelstra said of Bosh. \"He knows that he has to anchor the paint for us, and he has to do it in a lot of different ways. Because of his versatility, he does many things for us. Some of them are on the perimeter. That doesn't relieve him from those (rebounding) duties. Does that mean he'll have that type of rebounding night every night? No. But he has to be big for us and a presence at the rim and he committed to do that tonight.\"\n\nChicago's tenacious defense kept the Heat in check. James had 25 points on 6-for-17 shooting, and Wade scored 10 points on passive offensive effort. He took seven shots from the field, one in the first half.\n\nBut the already depleted Bulls — with just seven players available after Nazr Mohammed's second-quarter ejection — did not have enough left in tank in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"From my angle, I saw a guy basically flop, and I'm going to leave it at that,\" Thibodeau said of Mohammed's ejection.\n\nThe Heat outscored the Bulls 34-24 in the fourth quarter. James' three-pointer with 2:35 left put Miami up 93-86, and Cole's three with 1:48 made it 96-88.\n\nJames' driving layup for a three-point play made it 99-90 with 1:23 left, just enough of a cushion to hold off Chicago. He also was 5-of-5 on free throws in the final 83 seconds.\n\nJames had 12 points, Bosh eight and Cole seven in the fourth quarter when Miami outscored Chicago 34-24 after the third quarter ended with the scored tied at 70.\n\n\"I'm feeling comfortable out on the court,\" Cole said. \"That comes from the film sessions, working with my coaches and from the habits I built up throughout the season. I still have a long way to go, but I'm pleased with my progress.\"\n\nJames, who was 11-of-11 from the foul line, finished with another decent line — eight rebounds, seven assists and two steals in addition to his scoring. But again, the Bulls didn't let James have anything easy.\n\nJames, who shot a career high 56.5% from the field this season, made just 6-of-17 (35.3%) in Game 3. It was just the third time season he shot less than 36% from the field. James scored in the paint often and early in Game 2, and the Bulls were intent on keeping him out of the lane and away from easy shots at the rim. Six of James' seven baskets in Game 2 were at the rim on layups or dunks. In Game 3, he made just 3-of-6 at the rim.\n\nBut he persevered and delivered with the game on the line.\n\nMiami's depth continued to exploit Chicago's lack of it. After outscoring Chicago's bench 55-25 in Game 2, the Heat reserves outscored Chicago's depleted bench 36-8 in Game 3. At one point, the Bulls starters — all of whom reached double figures in points — had scored 61 of 63 points.\n\nForward Carlos Boozer led the Bulls with 21 points, and center Joakim Noah had 15 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nBoth teams were hot early — the Heat shot 61.1% in the first quarter and Bulls 52.6%. Bosh and Heat forward Udonis Haslem had their mid-range jumper shot falling, and Boozer finally reached double figures in points in the series with 10 in the first quarter on 5-of-7 shooting.\n\n\"Offensively, he was very aggressive early,\" Thibodeau said. \"There's a lot of different ways he can score – running the floor, going to the offensive board, ducking in, facing up. I thought he did a combination of all those things. I thought that got him into rhythm.\"\n\nBulls swingman Jimmy Butler picked up his second foul with 2:47 left in the first quarter, and the physical play and emotions carried over into Game 3. When Miami's Chris Andersen fouled Chicago's Nate Robinson, Noah, who was ejected in Game 2, rushed over to Robinson and shoved Anderson, drawing a technical foul.\n\nBut it got worse when Mohammed, a backup center, fouled James near halfcourt with 9:29 left in the second quarter. James received a technical foul for his reaction, and then Mohammed inexplicably shoved James to the court and was ejected.\n\nWith the Bulls already shorthanded (no Derrick Rose, no Kirk Hinrich, no Luol Deng), they didn't need another player out of the game. A short bench became even shorter.\n\nIt was the kind of play Thibodeau for the past two days had warned his team it needed to avoid.\n\n\"We can't allow frustration to impact the next play,\" Thibodeau said before Game 3.\n\nButler and Cole continued their stellar play. Butler was the last pick (No. 30) in the first round of the 2011 draft, and Cole was the No. 28 pick.\n\nButler, who played his fourth 48-minute game in Chicago's past five games, finished with 17 points and continued to make James work on offense.\n\nFrom the third quarter of Game 1 through the second quarter of Game 2, Cole made eight of nine shots, including all four from three-pointer range.\n\n\"He played very well. He's a good player, a very good player,\" Thibodeau said. \"He's improved every year in the league – hard-playing, smart, tough. Made a lot of big shots. I'm going to have to come up with a better answer.\"\n\nBosh accumulated a double-double (10 points, 10 rebounds) in the first half, and the Heat started to find their shots in latter half of the second quarter.\n\n\"You can't win a championship being pretty and shiny,\" Bosh said. \"You have to get dirty. You are going to have to play physical. You have to dive on the floor. You have to do things that are extremely tough. ... When push comes to shove, we know what to do.\"\n\nThibodeau also likes his team has more enough to win no matter who is on the floor.\n\nNot in Game 3."
