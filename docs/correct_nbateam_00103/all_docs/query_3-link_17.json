        "text": "Lisa Blumenfeld/Getty Images\n\nAs the dust settled on yesterday's trade deadline furor, one transaction in particular rose from the ashes, like the proverbial phoenix of legend, to steal the limelight on what was already a remarkable day.\n\nThe transaction in question, involving the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics and media darling Oklahoma City Thunder, hit league watchers like a runaway train, with few and far between predicting it.\n\nThunder GM Sam Presti played it near perfection, as he acquired Kendrick Perkins and Nate Robinson from the Celtics for the price of an aging Nenad Krstic and a stagnant Jeff Green.\n\nThe Krstic move was like for like and a clear upgrade for the Thunder, who were in desperate need for a defensive-minded center like Perkins.\n\nThe Green decision on the surface looks like the difficult one, but in actuality was almost as straightforward.\n\nAlthough the Thunder were long committed to Green's athleticism and versatility at both forward spots, the nature of this relationship was in question with every passing month of the NBA season.\n\nFor a large portion of last season, most notably the playoffs, and all of this season, reserve forward and dunk contest participant Serge Ibaka had been significantly better on the floor than Green.\n\nThis, coupled with Green's impending free agency this summer, made the Thunder's decision simple, as the organization was unwilling to offer extensions to him and Westbrook.\n\nThe Thunder cut their losses on Green and shipped him to B-town in exchange for a defensive stalwart in Perkins, and a scoring dynamo in Nate Robinson, who should upgrade their bench scoring.\n\nIn what was an underrated development yesterday, the Thunder made almost as significant a move by trading for Bobcats center Nazr Mohammed.\n\nThis came for the price of developing big man D.J. White and the expiring contract of a soon to be retired Mo Peterson.\n\nIn what was unquestionably a rebuilding move by the Bobcats, the Thunder swooped in, like a thief in the night, to acquire an undervalued center to back up Perkins.\n\nWhen looking on the surface of things, Nazr Mohammed is no Perkins, but in a Western Conference that is teeming with frontcourt talent, this move could be what elevates the Thunder from future pretenders to current contenders.\n\nWhen examining these deals beyond the mutterings in the front office and on the hardwood itself, it takes on even greater significance for the Thunder's frontcourt prospects.\n\nPerkins, arguably one of the best post defenders in the league, should help the Thunder's current defensive woes.\n\nThis season, we have witnessed a substantial drop off in the Thunder's formerly formidable defense, as it seems their youth has finally caught up with them.\n\nLast year, the Thunder took the league by storm, going against convention by developing great defensive cohesion beyond their young years. With the addition of two veteran players in the paint, their defense should steadily improve.\n\nOne statistical improvement fans should look for will be in opposition FG% at the rim, where a combination of Perkins and Ibaka should dissuade many a player from approaching the paint with anything but fear in their eyes.\n\nThe bench will now also offer up the working-class defensive tandem of Nick Collison and Nazr Mohammed, a tandem that will be high on energy, effort and stops, but low on offense.\n\nHerein lies the only noticeable weakness in this deal: the Thunder's need for offense in the post remains largely unaddressed. Even with Ibaka now being inserted into the starting lineup, much of the Thunder's offensive success will be predicated on their work on the perimeter.\n\nSam Presti really shook things up with this master stroke. This deal uplifts the Thunder and their talented core to undoubtedly the best team in the Northwest Division, as well as locking them in for home court advantage come playoff time.\n\nEven though it is still in doubt how this deal shapes the Thunder's chances against the Lakers and Spurs, it is important to remember that this team was only one secured rebound away from taking the champions to a Game 7 last year."
