        "text": "Yesterday, in a chat with fans on ESPN.com, NBA writer Chad Ford was asked if any team was interested in taking Rip Hamilton off the Pistons' hands. Ford's response:\n\nYou may remember the Pistons' attempt to land Chandler this past summer. The specifics of the deal where never revealed, but it was assumed that either Tayshaun Prince or Hamilton were involved to make the salaries match.\n\nThe Bobcats ended up trading Chandler to Dallas for Erick Dampier , Matt Carroll and Eduardo Najera.\n\nFor what it's worth, the Bobcats didn't get good value for Chandler. Charlotte ended up waiving Dampier to get below the luxury tax. Carroll and Najera are each averaging less than ten minutes a game.\n\nBut for whatever reason, potentially luxary tax concerns, the Bobcats found Dallas' proposal more enticing than what the Pistons were offering.\n\nSo why now would the Bobcats have a lingering interest in Hamilton? They already have a shooting guard in Stephen Jackson. Yes, Jackson has played some small forward in his career, but that would require moving 6-foot-7 Gerald Wallace to power forward. That's a pretty undersized starting lineup.\n\nThere's no doubt Charlotte has pieces that would entice the Pistons to jump, namely the expiring contracts of Boris Diaw and/or Nazr Mohammed, but unless the Bobcats and Pistons were to get a third team involved in any potential trade talks, the addition of Hamilton to the Charlotte roster makes no sense."
