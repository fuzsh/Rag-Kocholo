        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Since taking charge of the Charlotte Bobcats in 2006, Michael Jordan has made 13 trades involving 35 players.\n\nYet while half the roster is seemingly mentioned in various trade reports, coach Paul Silas doesn’t anticipate another major move before Thursday’s trade deadline.\n\n“It doesn’t seem like it,” Silas said Monday night. “There’s been talk, there’s always talk, but if you give up something you’ve got to get something. That’s a major problem. People want to take what you have and give you nothing back. So that’s not going to happen. We’ll keep what we have and go with it.”\n\nWhile things could change before Thursday, that’s welcome news to top scorers Stephen Jackson and Gerald Wallace.\n\nJackson, who still has two years and $19 million left on his contract after this season, and Wallace, who is owed about $21 million during that time, have been named in numerous reports as possible players Jordan could move to lower the payroll of his money-losing team.\n\n“At the end of the day I’ve got a great job wherever I’m at,” Jackson said. “I would love to be here, though.”\n\nAdded Wallace: “I’m happy here. Family is good here, I love the city. My main thing is trying to help the team get to the playoffs.”\n\nAfter a terrible 9-19 start got Larry Brown fired, the Bobcats (24-32) have played much better under Silas to move within a game of the Indiana Pacers (24-30) for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.\n\nJordan lifted the interim tag from Silas last week and gave him a one-year contract extension. After watching his team go through a workout Monday following a four days off for the All-Star break, Silas seemed content with keeping the Wallace-Jackson combination.\n\n“I don’t think we’d be where we are now without those two,” Silas said. “I looked at both of the today and they were excited, played all out. Gerald Wallace was unbelievable today and Jack was terrific.”\n\nForward Boris Diaw and center Nazr Mohammed have also been included in the myriad of reports and rumors. Mohammed acknowledged he checks out the various NBA rumor websites each morning, but isn’t concerning himself with being dealt.\n\n“I read it and it’s interesting,” Mohammed said, “but at the same time nothing is done until it’s done.”\n\nThe Bobcats are hopeful forward Tyrus Thomas will be able to return in two weeks from knee surgery, giving Charlotte added depth in the frontcourt for the stretch run. Thomas who has been out since Jan. 20, did some light running on Monday.\n\n“If we keep guys healthy and get Tyrus back, hopefully, we’ll be OK,” Jackson said. “I think we have enough to make the playoffs.”\n\nStill, not making a deal would run counter to Jordan’s history as first the managing partner and now the outright Bobcats owner. The trades reached a fever pitch under the demanding Brown, with Charlotte making nine trades involving 27 players since before the 2008-09 season.\n\n“Every team can get better, but you’ve got ask is a tweak going to improve the team?” Mohammed said. “Sometimes things look better on paper.”"
