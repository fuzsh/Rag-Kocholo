        "text": "What have you been doing since the season ended? Tyrus Thomas: I’ve been continuing a little rehab on my knee and now I’m back working out. I’ve been really working on my mental approach to the game. I’ve done that by watching film, studying myself, and being more analytical, rather than spontaneous, in my everyday life. I must say though, the highlight of my summer has been my wedding!\n\nThe Bobcats said post-game that Thomas has been medically cleared for a full-contact pratice Tuesday. If that goes well, he’ll be activated (either Wednesday against the Bulls or Friday against the Blazers). Silas will be happy to have him back, particularly as a shotblocker. I wouldn’t have a problem with Silas starting Thomas, considering Diaw’s performance, but I think some of you get ahead of yourselves: Thomas has a wealth of talent, but he needs to play under control. Kind of like that running back who rushes into the hole so fast he never gets to make a fake. Still, I’m glad he’s here.\n\nThomas caught New Orleans Hornets center Emeka Okafor in the face with an elbow late in Saturday’s loss. He was assessed a flagrant foul, penalty two (the harsher penalty) and was ejected from the game. “It’s unfortunate he’s not going to be here, but he has to learn from it,’’ said Silas, who lost his top reserve. “If he does that, then it’s all worthwhile.’’"
