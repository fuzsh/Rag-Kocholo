        "text": "Gerald Wallace had 31 points and 14 rebounds while outplaying LeBron James, and the Cleveland Cavaliers looked disjointed in Shaquille O’Neal’s return from injury in a 94-87 loss to the Charlotte Bobcats on Friday night.\n\nThe surprising Bobcats won their third straight game following a seven-game losing streak behind Wallace, who beat James in numerous 1-on-1 matchups in the post. Wallace topped 30 points for the second straight game, while James scored 25 points.\n\nO’Neal recovered after missing five of his first seven shots to finish with 11 points and eight rebounds. He had missed the past six games with a strained left shoulder, and Cleveland fell to 6-4 when he plays and 5-1 when he’s out.\n\nHead Coach Mike Brown said before the game he wanted to limit O’Neal to about 25 minutes. O’Neal played 29, hitting 5 of 11 shots and 1 of 3 free throws.\n\nHe was on the floor for much of the fourth quarter, when Cleveland cut a 24-point, third-quarter deficit to seven. But even with Charlotte going the final 9 minutes without a field goal, the Cavaliers’ three-game winning streak was snapped.\n\nStephen Jackson added 17 points and Nazr Mohammed had 13 points and six rebounds for the Bobcats, who improved to 6-2 at home. Mo Williams added 22 points for the Cavaliers, who had beaten Charlotte seven straight times.\n\nWallace had the better of James for much of the third quarter, hitting three 3-pointers and often scoring over James in the post. Wallace’s 3 with 7:42 left put Charlotte ahead 74-50.\n\nAfter Wallace scored over James again to make it 80-61, James raised the intensity. He hit two quick 3s in a 19-5 run that cut the lead to 11 entering the fourth.\n\nShaq’s return meant Zydrunas Ilgauskas came off the bench again on the night he tied Cavaliers general manager Danny Ferry for the team’s leader in games played with 723.\n\nWith the change in the middle, James made it clear before the game that they needed to get O’Neal involved in the offense.\n\n“One thing about Shaq, he needs the ball,” he said.\n\nBut O’Neal looked rusty early, while the Bobcats were getting easy hoops in transition while he lagged behind.\n\nThe first half was a rarity with James called for two charges and a travel, while there was a brief scare when he turned his left ankle when he stepped on D.J. Augustin’s foot on a drive.\n\nHe returned, but was on the bench for the final 3 minutes with three fouls. With O’Neal shooting just 2-for-6 and lumbering up the court, the Bobcats were running at will.\n\nA couple weeks after James suggested he and the rest of the NBA players wearing No. 23 should change to honor Michael Jordan, the Bobcats managing partner sat courtside and watched his team post its third straight strong performance."
