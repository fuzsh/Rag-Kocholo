        "text": "Charlotte | The large calendar inside the Charlotte Bobcats' locker room noted that on Thursday players would have exit interviews with part-owner Michael Jordan.\n\nThe spot for Friday had the message, \"start working for playoffs.\"\n\nThat work will wait at least a year and may involve a new coach after the fourth-year Bobcats fell short of their goal of reaching the postseason for the first time.\n\nA day after the Bobcats finished 32-50 with a meaningless win over Philadelphia, players trickled into the arena Thursday to meet with Jordan, who has the final say on basketball decisions.\n\nFirst-year coach Sam Vincent was there, too, although no decision on his future was announced. Jordan, as is his custom, declined an interview request.\n\n\"Sam did the best job that he could with the personnel he had, the coaching staff he had,\" said Jason Richardson, who led the team with 21.8 points per game. \"He did what he was supposed to do. We didn't achieve the goals we were capable of, but he did his job.\"\n\nJordan, whose resume as an NBA executive is less than stellar, gambled by hiring Vincent last year. He had never been an NBA head coach and had spent only one year in the league as an assistant.\n\nPredictably, Vincent had growing pains. He couldn't come up with a consistent rotation, with 3-point specialist Matt Carroll and rookie Jared Dudley getting little playing time early. He kept shuttling Raymond Felton between point guard and shooting guard.\n\nEven though the Bobcats went 13-11 after March 1, their horrible start prevented them from seriously threatening for a playoff spot in the weak Eastern Conference.\n\n\"Coming in and having to work for Michael, who is arguably the best player ever, and knowing that's your boss and you've got a big set of eyes watching everything you do, puts its own pressure on you,\" Vincent said. \"So I think there were just a lot of adjustments to make in this first year. I think we all got through it, the coaching staff and players, with a pretty solid season.\"\n\nBut nowhere near Vincent's lofty playoff goals. Despite acquiring Richardson in a draft-night deal with Golden State and re-signing Gerald Wallace, the Bobcats finished with one less win than last season under Bernie Bickerstaff.\n\nBut Jordan deserves some of the blame, too. He didn't address the team's obvious lack of depth up front until the December deal that brought in Nazr Mohammed from Detroit.\n\nMohammed put up decent numbers, but he's due more than $6 million a year through 2010-11.\n\nHe also failed to prevent Charlotte from giving up a staggering 999 offensive boards.\n\nRichardson was clearly the bright spot. He hit an NBA-high 243 3-pointers, the fourth most in NBA history. He shot a career-best 41 percent from behind the arc and had 16 games of 30 or more points.\n\nBut the Bobcats didn't have a player who could defend big men who played on the perimeter.\n\nBesides Vincent, Jordan and the Bobcats have a few big decisions to make. Big man Emeka Okafor becomes a restricted free agent on July 1.\n\nFelton, entering the final year of his rookie contract, is eligible for an extension. Wallace averaged 19.4 points, but missed 20 games, including a stretch midway through the season after he was knocked unconscious by an inadvertent elbow.\n\nIt was Wallace's fourth concussion in four years, a sobering thought a year after the Bobcats gave him a six-year, $57 million deal.\n\nRecent deals will limit what the Bobcats can do this summer. Richardson, who is owed more than $40 million over the next three years, leads the bloated contract parade and Charlotte is right at the salary cap limit.\n\nThe Bobcats need a power forward and a backup point guard. They also need area fans to care. The team ranked 24th of out of 30 teams in attendance.\n\nJordan, who filled the front office with loyal friends, now must decide on Vincent. He also needs to open cap space and make the right choice in the draft."
