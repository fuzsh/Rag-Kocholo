        "text": "ORLANDO\n\nThe Charlotte Bobcats are the last team to beat the Magic in Orlando. They did it on March 14 in a game in which Dwight Howard shot 10 free throws and made only three.\n\nSo one thing you can expect from the first-round playoff series between the Magic and Bobcats, which starts tonight, is plenty of foul shots from Howard.\n\nFree-throw shooting (.592) remains the Magic center's weakness, and the Bobcats have four big centers they can run at him in the best-of-seven series. \"The most important thing is that Dwight has to stay focused,\" said Magic backup center Marcin Gortat. \"He can't get distracted by hard fouls from aggressive play by other big men.\"\n\nIndeed, a distracted Howard would seem to be the Bobcats' best chance for an upset in the franchise's first playoff series.\n\nThe Magic lost a first-round series to Charlotte in 2002, but that was the Charlotte Hornets, who would soon move to New Orleans. This time the Magic, as defending Eastern Conference champions, come in as big favorites, having won 20 of their last 23 games to finish with the league's second-best record (59-23).\n\n\"Obviously we're going into the playoffs with great confidence,\" said coach Stan Van Gundy. \"We're healthy, we're confident. That's all good, but the playoffs are a whole different story.\"\n\nThe Bobcats (44-38) have some reasons of their own to be confident. Including their 96-89 victory in Orlando, which was accomplished without All-Star forward Gerald Wallace, they won 16 of their last 23 games. They gave up the fewest points (93.8 per game) of any team in the NBA, and coach Larry Brown has a history of playoff success. For that matter, so does Michael Jordan, now the principal owner of the Bobcats.\n\nOnly Wallace, point guard Raymond Felton and center Nazr Mohammed remain from the team Brown took over two years. Ten trades have reshaped the Bobcats since then, the most important being the November trade with Golden State that brought in Stephen Jackson. The 6-foot-8 guard has been Charlotte's leading scorer at 21.2 points per game, and he scored 28 in the victory in Orlando.\n\n\"The difference in that team,\" said Magic point guard Jameer Nelson,\"is Stephen Jackson.\"\n\nWhether Jackson or Wallace or missed free throws by Howard can beenough difference for the Bobcats to beat the Magic four times is questionable. Based on the numbers, it is a series that figures to get very defensive and perhaps even ugly.\n\n\"It wasn't easy in any round of the playoffs last year, including the first round, and it won't be this year,\" Van Gundy said. \"You're in the playoffs and it's all about matchups and anything can happen. It's a whole different test than the regular season.\""
