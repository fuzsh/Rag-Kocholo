        "text": "AUBURN HILLS – Isiah Thomas has said repeatedly the Knicks will address their vacuum at center, perhaps in the June 28 NBA Draft. And Thomas will pursue free agent centers Eddy Curry, Kwame Brown, Zydrunas Ilgauskas after July 1.\n\nBut Nazr Mohammed still doesn’t understand. In Mohammed, the Knicks had an up-and-coming center in the fold, one Thomas never stopped raving about. But on Feb. 24, the 6-10 Mohammed, 28, was traded to the Spurs. Last night he entered Game 4 of the NBA Finals two wins from a championship, San Antonio leading Detroit 2-1.\n\n“That’s surprising to me,” Mohammed told The Post in a quiet moment amidst the media crush here. “I definitely thought I’d be there for a while. I definitely feel I’m showing I am a center in this league.”\n\nMost Knicks fans ripped the trade that brought veteran undersized power forward Malik Rose and two late first-rounders to the Garden for Mohammed. Rose played a reserve role; he was an energizer, but with limitations. Thomas didn’t like that Mohammed wasn’t a back-to-the-basket, low-post scorer or shot-blocker.\n\n“I’m a starting center in the Finals, which says a lot,” said Mohammed, who beat out Rasho Nesterovic late in the season. “And they definitely had me. It’s disappointing to be traded but I’m so fortunate and blessed to be sent to a situation to compete for a championship.”\n\nTexan Kurt Thomas, Mohammed’s former teammate who now masquerades as the Knicks’ center, must be jealous. Kurt Thomas privately desired a trade to the Spurs, who nearly obtained him at the 2004 trading deadline for Rose before Isiah Thomas backed off. The Knicks would not offer up Kurt Thomas to the Spurs at the trade deadline this time.\n\nKurt Thomas, who admitted longingly in the final days of this past miserable season that his only goal now is to win an NBA title, phoned Mohammed a few days ago.\n\n“When I talked to him, he was congratulating me,” Mohammed said. “He said go out there and take advantage of the situation. Everyone wants to be in the Finals. Six years before I got this opportunity, I was envious of who was in the Finals. Everyone wants to be here.”\n\nMohammed wasn’t heartbroken at the trade, just stunned. He was renting a condo in Scarsdale, but only because the real estate market was too high. He wasn’t renting because he sensed a trade, not after his bang-up start to the season.\n\nOn the day of the trade, as he departed for the Alamo City, Mohammed told one Knick, “I’ll let you wear my ring this summer.”\n\n“I don’t feel any ill will toward [Isiah Thomas],” said Mohammed, averaging 7.8 points and 6.9 rebounds in 19 playoff games. “He could have put me in a bad situation. San Antonio wasn’t the only team that inquired about me from what he told me. He wasn’t trying to get rid of me. He was trying to improve the Knicks and felt that’s what he needed to do.\n\n“[Isiah Thomas] told me he’s always liked Malik’s game. It was an opportunity to get a player he always liked and two first-round picks. Nothing against me.”\n\nStill, responding to heavy criticism of the trade, Isiah Thomas slighted Mohammed. He talked about never imagining he could get two first-rounders for Mohammed (this year’s pick is No. 30).\n\nAnd in the days after the deal, the Knicks president said: “I woke up the next morning and didn’t realize I had traded Patrick Ewing. I couldn’t believe it. I happen to like Malik Rose better than Nazr Mohammed.”\n\nBy next week, Mohammed might have something even Ewing doesn’t have – an NBA championship ring."
