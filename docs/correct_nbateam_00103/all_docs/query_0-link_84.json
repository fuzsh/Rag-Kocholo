        "text": "THE `HOUSE - Don't look for D.J. Augustin, Gerald Henderson or Nazr Mohammed in a Pacers uniform when they take on the New Orleans Hornets on Friday.\n\nYou can't blame Larry Bird for this one, though.\n\nBird and David Morway tried to pull off a deal for the three but things came to a screeching halt about 10 minutes before the 3 p.m. deadline when the Charlotte Bobcats backed out because their owner didn't want to do the deal, according to a source.\n\nThe Pacers were going to send T.J. Ford and Brandon Rush to the Bobcats. Bird has always liked Augustin.\n\nThe one thing that became clear through this failed deal is that Rush has some work to do if he expects to be part of the team's future.\n\nFord was on his way to catch the team plane to New Orleans when he was notified that he may be traded.\n\nHe later posted this message on this his Twitter page: \"Sorry but trade rumors was just trade talk... Still a PACER!!!!\"\n\nBird, who declined to go into the specifics of the deals they tried to make, said they had conversations with \"about 20 different teams\" leading up to the deadline.\n\n\"We looked at what we were going to do in the future and if it didn't make sense we weren't going to do it,\" Bird said.\n\nI can see Bird's logic in not making a trade to just make one, but it would have added a different perspective on a disappointing season.\n\ntwitter.com/wells222"
