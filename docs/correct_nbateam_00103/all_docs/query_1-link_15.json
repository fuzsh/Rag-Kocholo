        "text": "New York Knicks Acquire Tim Thomas & Nazr Mohammed In Three-Team Deal\n\nOn February 15th, 2004, As part of a 3-team trade, the New York Knicks traded forward Keith Van Horn to the Milwaukee Bucks; the New York Knicks traded center Michael Doleac and a 2005 2nd round draft pick (Ronny Turiaf) to the Atlanta Hawks; the Atlanta Hawks traded center Nazr Mohammed to the New York Knicks; the Milwaukee Bucks traded center Joel Przybilla to the Atlanta Hawks; and the Milwaukee Bucks traded forward Tim Thomas to the New York Knicks.\n\nIsiah Thomas inherited a questionable New York Knick roster and a month and a half after landing Stephon Marbury in a multi-player deal, Thomas made another splash acquiring Tim Thomas and Nazr Mohammed in a three-team deal during the all-star break.\n\nThomas dealt Keith Van Horn to Milwaukee as well as a second round draft pick and Michael Doleac to Atlanta.\n\nThe Knicks were 25-29 at the all-star break, meaning that they went 11-8 after acquiring Marbury. The Bucks were in a respectable position of 27-24 and in the hunt for a spot in the Eastern Conference Playoffs, while Atlanta was 18-35 and far out of playoff contention.\n\nMilwaukee was building a roster around Michael Redd, but needed some complimentary scoring and rebounding on the roster.\n\nAtlanta was in full-sell mode, having already traded starters Theo Ratliff and Shareef Abdur-Rahim to Portland about a week before this deal. The Hawks were preparing to ease their payroll situation and set themselves up to have a considerable amount of cap room.\n\nAtlanta had four players under contract beyond the 2003-04 season (Alan Henderson, Jason Terry, Boris Diaw and Chris Crawford).\n\nThose players accounted for only about $21 million in salary, giving the Hawks at least $20 million in salary cap room to pursue free agents in the offseason.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks general manager Larry Harris said trade talks heated up after three to four hours of discussions in Los Angeles, during NBA All-Star Weekend. After Harris returned home Friday, he spoke with coach Terry Porter and Bucks owner Herb Kohl before eventually making the trade. via Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nThomas and Van Horn had nearly identical salaries. Thomas had two years and $27 million left on his contract while Van Horn had two years and about $30 million left on his contract.\n\nThe Bucks also eliminated Przybilla’s $2.3 million salary from their books and gained a one-year league exception for that amount, providing some financial flexibility.\n\nThe trade was not a clear success for any of the three teams involved. Tim Thomas was nothing better than average with New York and Nazr Mohammed was solid for New York, but the overall makeup of the roster was still problematic beyond this trade.\n\nMilwaukee made the playoffs for the 2003-04 season, but they were eliminated rather easily by Detroit and finished 30-52 the following season.\n\nAtlanta was not successful in their rebuilding process after this trade and the two other deals they made at the deadline. After a 28-54 finish to the 2003-04 season, Atlanta won only 13 game during the 2004-05 season replacing their core with younger players like Josh Childress and Josh Smith mixed in with veterans Antoine Walker and Al Harrington. The Hawks would never truly recover from their mistakes until the 2007-08 season.\n\nKeith Van Horn was acquired by the Knicks in a four-team deal that sent Latrell Sprewell to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Van Horn would step into Sprewell’s spot in the starting lineup and he was booed for replacing Sprewell who captured the hearts of the Knicks faithful with his effort and clutch play. The criticism and fan reaction increased the pressure on Van Horn to play at a high level in New York.\n\nVan Horn played a decent 47 games with New York before the trade and averaged 16.4 PPG, 7.3 RPG, and 1.8 APG while shooting 44% from the field, 37% from the arc, and 82% from the free throw line.\n\nVan Horn was not happy about leaving New York, especially after moving his wife and four children from the Philadelphia area back to New Jersey. (The 76ers drafted Van Horn in 1997 and traded his rights to the Nets before reacquiring him.) Van Horn said he would not decide whether to relocate them again until after the season.\n\nTim Thomas was acquired by Philadelphia in a trade with the Bucks during the middle of the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season, and played a great role as the sixth man for Milwaukee and had a stretch of impressive seasons for Milwaukee.\n\nOnce the Bucks ended up trading their starting small forward Glenn “Big Dog” Robinson to Atlanta in 2003, Thomas was thrust into the starting lineup and disappointed.\n\nHis overall time with Milwaukee was solid but unspectacular. He averaged 12.2 PPG, 4.2 RPG, and 1.5 APG on 44% from the field, 36% from the three-point line, and 76% from the free throw line.\n\nAs a full-time starter (2002-04 seasons) Thomas’ numbers were very average. His averages were 13.6 PPG, 4.9 RPG, and 1.6 APG on a 44/36/77 splits from the field, arc, and free throw line.\n\nNazr Mohammed was mainly the backup center of the Atlanta Hawks after being acquired in a six-player deal that brought Atlanta Theo Ratliff and landed Philadelphia Dikembe Mutombo.\n\nHe was able to start and obtain significant playing time due to Theo Ratliff’s constant health problems. In his time with Atlanta, Mohammed averaged 8.3 PPG and 6.6 RPG on 47% FGS and 65% FTS over 198 gamess and about three seasons with Atlanta.\n\nDoleac signed with the Knicks and filled the role of backup center. His ability to knock down the mid-range jumper was valuable, but his role never expanded beyond a supporting role. In 121 games and one and a half seasons with New York, Doleac averaged 4.6 PPG and 3.4 RPG on 43% from the field and 82% from the free throw line.\n\nPrzybilla was drafted with the ninth pick by the Houston Rockets in the largely disappointing 2000 NBA draft. His rights were traded for the rights to the 15th pick Jason Collier and a 2001 first rounder.\n\nThe Bucks hoped Przybilla would develop into a valuable defender and shot-blocker, but he was neer able to develop into a vital contributor.\n\nPrzybilla played three and a half seasons with Milwaukee with career averages of 1.9 PPG, 3.6 RPG, and 1.4 BPG in 141 games with Milwaukee.\n\nAfter the trade, Van Horn went on to average 12.7 PPG, 5.6 RPG, and 1.3 APG on 49/42/91 splits with Milwaukee over a season. Van Horn was traded a year later (middle of 2004-05 season) to the Dallas Mavericks for the expiring contracts of Alan Henderson and Calvin Booth.\n\nThomas averaged 12.0 PPG, 3.5 RPG, and 1.0 APG with 44/41/79 splits from the field, three-point, and free throw line with the Knicks over a season and a half before being traded to Chicago in a four-player deal that brought New York Eddy Curry.\n\nUnfortunately for Thomas, he will probably be best known for calling the New Jersey Nets’ Kenyon Martin a “Fugazy” during a 2004 Eastern Conference first round matchup against the New Jersey Nets.\n\nNazr Mohammed became the starting center for the Knicks after the trade and was a solid contributor averaging 10.3 PPG, and 8 RPG on 52% from the field and 66% from the charity stripe over 81 games with New York. Mohammed was traded later during the 2004-05 season to San Antonio for Malik Rose and future draft picks.\n\nDoleac was waived shortly after the trade by Atlanta. He would sign for the rest of the season with the Denver Nuggets.\n\nJoel Przybilla would play out the rest of the 2003-04 season with Atlanta (12 games) before signing in free agency with the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nThe future second rounder that New York sent to Atlanta was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats in the ‘04 offseason and then was re-routed to the Los Angeles Lakers in a mid-season trade during the 2004-05 season.\n\nThe Lakers used that pick on Ronny Turiaf with the 35th pick in the 2005 NBA draft.\n\nFun Facts: This was the second time Keith Van Horn and Tim Thomas were traded for each other. They were traded on draft night during the 1997 NBA draft in a trade between Philadelphia ad New Jersey.\n\nAfter over eight years away from Milwaukee, Joel Przybilla signed as a free agent in 2012 with the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nKeith Van Horn (via NY Times):\n\n“It was strange. I was shocked. I didn’t think anything was going to happen. I felt the team was really coming together and we would be playing good basketball.”\n\nOn Moving on from New York\n\n“You get to a point where you’re shocked, and after a day or two you look at the situation you have and switch over. You’ve got to leave the past in the past.”\n\nOn fitting in with Milwaukee:\n\n“I felt I fit in here pretty quickly. I’ve been around the game long enough and I’ve have had to make life adjustments throughout my career, especially with the Knicks this year in a short period of time. It wasn’t too difficult for me.”\n\nNazr Mohammed after Hawks played Knicks in March of 2004\n\n“I couldn’t have written it up any better. I went from a backup center on a team that wasn’t winning to a starting center on a team where we’re going to make the playoffs.”\n\nNew York Knicks president Isiah Thomas (via NY Times):\n\n“The only reason we made the trade was because we got both players. When you add Tim Thomas and Nazr Mohammed to our team, it makes us a much more athletic team. I think we’ve become a better defensive team, a better rebounding team.”\n\nOn what team he’s trying to build:\n\n“I wanted to put together a team that was exciting for the fans to come and watch, a team that had some character and some guts, but also a team that you can grab a box of popcorn and grab a soda and enjoy the game. You want players and you want a team that people want to see. I think this is a team that when everyone is healthy and playing well, it can be an exciting team that people will want to see and talk about.”\n\nOn Tim Thomas:\n\n“When you make a trade for a player, you always try to imagine how the player would be in your surroundings, in your environment, under your tutelage. I’m confident that if Tim is willing to work and willing to listen, we can help him reach the potential that he has.”\n\nOn Keith Van Horn:\n\n“It was a very tough trade for us losing Keith. It’s probably one of the most difficult trades I’ve ever had to make, simply because of my fondness for Keith.”\n\nOn Nazr Mohammed (via ESPN):\n\n“We wanted to get more athletic and wanted to get tougher from a rebounding standpoint. It gives us some insurance in case Kurt Thomas leaves (as a free agent over the summer), if Doleac doesn’t come back and because Dikembe (Mutombo) is 38 (in June).”\n\nMilwaukee Bucks general manager Larry Harris (via Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)\n\n“The consistency he will bring us will be valuable (Van Horn). I think you can pretty much write in the kind of performance you’re going to get from him, and it is one of the key ingredients in doing this.”\n\nOn Tim Thomas:\n\n“We shouldn’t underestimate what Tim Thomas brought. He was excited about the changes that were made this summer, and he took that ownership on his shoulders, yet he didn’t go out and start jacking up shots. It was still about team and winning.”\n\nOn questions of Van Horn’s defensive ability:\n\n“It’s a team concept the way we play, and Keith is going to be part of that. If he can at least hold his guy for one or two steps, the rest of the posse is going to come. I think we’ve solidified a little more at the small forward spot, but it’s still going to be all 12 guys.”\n\nOn Van Horn’s failure to live up to expectations during his career (via Wisconsin State Journal):\n\n“Certain players get a certain level of expectations based on the salary they make. All I know is what I expect of players, and I can’t really worry about what others’ expectations may be. All I know is that Keith Van Horn has been a consistent performer at a high level ever since he came into the league.”\n\nOn the adjustment period for Van Horn:\n\n“Anytime you make a change, there is going to be an adjustment period, and I expect there will be one with Keith, but Tim (Thomas) was a player who bought into what we’ve been trying to do this year, and I don’t anticipate that it will be anything different with Van Horn. It might take some time for Keith to learn the sets, so in the meantime you might see Desmond (Mason) in the starting lineup.”\n\nAtlanta Hawks general manager Billy Knight (via Inside Hoops):\n\n“Both guys bring unique qualities to our roster. Doleac is a big man who is a skilled perimeter player, while Przybilla is an established shot blocker. It’s always difficult to trade guys. Nazr has been a good player for us, has played hard and done a good job. We wish him well and a lot of success in the future. This is what we feel we need to do to go forward.”\n\nBucks head coach Terry Porter (via NY Times):\n\n“I think he (Van Horn) was hurt about the whole thing, being traded four times in three years, that whole scenario. He never said he was disappointed, but I’m sure he was disappointed.”\n\nBucks guard Michael Redd on Keith Van Horn (via ESPN):\n\n“This is a great addition for us. Keith is a quality guy, and he’s going to stretch the defense out – maybe more than Tim did.”\n\n(via Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) “He’s a Toni Kukoc type. He’s versatile, as Timmy (Thomas) was. He can post up and he can knock down the three-point shot. I think it’s going to benefit us. I think the organization wants to win. They showed today that they want to win. We’re excited to have Keith, and we’re going to keep moving.”\n\nOn Tim Thomas (via NY Times):\n\n“It’s up to him how good he wants to be. Tim Thomas can be as good as he wants to be.”\n\nAtlanta Hawks head coach Terry Stotts after Hawks played Knicks in March of 2004 (via NY Times):\n\n“Before the trade, Nazr was playing very well and he was in a situation where we had Shareef and Theo and we had a hard time getting him on the court. I’m really happy for him because he’s getting the opportunity to play and he’s showing them what he can do.”"
