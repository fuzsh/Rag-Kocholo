        "text": "SINCE taking the midnight train to Georgia, packaged as a salary cap accessory in the Great Mutombo Fandango, Nazr Mohammed, in the words of Ted Turner, has kept the Hawks from making ashes out of themselves.\n\nIn a dozen games, the 6-10, 23-year-old, who did nothing but provide solid stuff with the 76ers, despite seeing as much daylight as Dracula, is averaging 11 points, 47 percent from the field and 7.3 rebounds in just 21 minutes.\n\nNot bad for someone scheduled to be ditched by Atlanta’s braintrust (there are some brains there, I trust) immediately upon arrival.\n\nUrged to reconsider by one aspiring GM and one under payroll, who were impressed with Mohammed’s attitude and aptitude, management shucked its original plan (Theo Ratliff being shelved for at least another month, leaving the team minus one big body, might’ve had something to do with it) and decided to give him an honest tryout.\n\nIn Mohammed’s last three outings (reunion vs. Sixers, Bulls and Grizzlies) prior to Friday’s loss in Indiana, he averaged 13.7 ppg and 8.3 rpg, including a career high 18 points against his former employer.\n\nIs this guy and his meaningless statistics for an irrelevant team really worth all this space? Not in themselves, they aren’t. However, it definitely proves Mohammed has professional skills and conscientious sweat glands.\n\nI don’t know if he’s a genuine starter in the middle, or at power forward, but he’s definitely a solid sub, and definitely belongs in the league. All Mohammed needed was a bona fide opportunity.\n\nHow many players reside at the end of benches who are just like him? How many are branded failures simply because they’re sitting, for whatever reason?\n\nMy point is, some of these people are available for a lot less than you can imagine, but precious few elevate nearly seven stories high into the sky.\n\nThink the Knicks could use a young center – a prospect to use to some extent now and groom for the future? Think the Lakers could find some time behind Shaq for a guy fitting Mohammed’s description? Think the Nets might have room for him in their rotation? Think the Pacers would be better with Mohammed at center and Jermaine O’Neal at macho forward, or the other way around?\n\nIt’s amazing how many teams are groveling and groping for a competent stud, yet were clueless Mohammed possesses a pristine jumper, owns soft hands and runs the floor so swiftly.\n\nAmazing how the entire NBA (the Hawks only took him as a throw-in) made no bid for his free agent-to-be services over the past eight months while the 76ers (committed to rewarding greatly improved Todd MacCulloch this summer) were trying to move him.\n\nThen again, you’ve got to understand, Mohammed is banking a bundle this season. Had any team actually recognized his acumen level, would its capologist have been slick enough to create ample room for his $1.3M salary?\n\nCome on, let’s attempt to be fair here. It’s not as if the 76ers were giving away Mohammed. GM Billy King told me he was demanding a future second round pick.\n\n*\n\nWHERE’S Katherine Harris when you really need her? Over the last ten games, Jamal Mashburn has averaged 19.4 points, 6.9 assists and 7.7 boards while his Hornets have closed to within two games of Central-leading Milwaukee. All this from a guy who wasn’t good enough to make the All-Star game.\n\nHad Puffy not been purified (watch the DOW soar now), I would’ve lost complete confidence in our judicial system. Not only does it occasionally work, but O.J. found the real killer . . . “We all know very well,” The Mysterious J. underlines, “Puffy’s only crime was buying a town house on Park Avenue.”\n\nIf Eddie Rush was any closer to Tracy McGrady and Bobby Jackson when they squared off Tuesday they’d be Siamese triplets. Yet the veteran referee continued to ogle the action even after McGrady bounced the ball off Jackson’s dome. Only when they began fighting did Rush bother to intercede. Doctors tell me he seems to be suffering from the debilitating effects associated with “Post Reggie Miller Tape Syndrome.”\n\n*\n\nCORRECT me if I’m right: I could’ve sworn I read Larry Brown, coach of the league-best, 48-17 Sixers, is taking a couple games off to combat acid reflux and hiatal hernia, while Dave Cowens, coach of the 16-50 neutered Warriors has never been healthier. And was that a typo, or is Allen Iverson really out indefinitely due to a hip-hop pointer?\n\nThe Cavaliers are 15½ games behind the Bucks and trail the Hornets by 131/2, yet they whipped both at home last week while shooting well over 50 percent. Yesterday, coach Randy Wittman gave both George Karl and Paul Silas votes of confidence.\n\nWhile on the subject of Karl, seems to me, he should have gotten a bonus from NBC for his excellent analysis of the Sonics, not a 50G punishment courtesy of David Stern.\n\nStill, you’d think Karl would have more on his mind these days than the Seattle team president. Though whacking Wally (“I have pictures”) Walker is always well-warranted, you’d think a 25G fine in March ’99 would’ve taught George the mellifluence of silence when asked loaded questions about his former boss/ constant antagonist. Especially in view of those vicious rumors about Matt Doherty taking his job next season.\n\n*\n\nIN case Rick Pitino missed it, the Celtics recorded back-to-back road kills against the Suns and Nuggets, giving them a slight edge over the Pacers for the East’s eighth playoff spot. Antoine Walker’s numbers across the majority of the stats sheet have increased under Jim O’Brien, but it’s not as the 6-10 forward has altered his outside-outside game. In 84 minutes in those two wins, the world’s worst shot selector visited the welfare line as many times as I did.\n\nAlthough not a major topic of discussion on Boston’s radio talk shows, Milt Palacio has become a steady contributor to the team’s success. In the last five games, the reserve point has averaged double figures while playing serious minutes.\n\nParticularly gratifying was Palacio’s 10-point, 3-rebound effort March 9 vs. the Wizards; he’d been cut by Leonard Hamilton after two exhibition games without seeing a moment of daylight. Afterward, every Wizard assistant congratulated Palacio for what he’s been able to accomplish. Hamilton ignored him.\n\nNaturally, the Celtics are attempting to re-sign Palacio past this season. Which is kinda interesting. Both Palacio and Shyne Barrow are from Belize. In other words, one guy is looking to get a contract extension, the other is hoping for early release.\n\n*\n\nRICK Reilly has learned Byron Scott plans to add Kerry Kittles to the Nets’ playoff roster . . . Isiah Thomas, having practiced with the Pacers March 12, is scheming to freeze out Jalen Rose at the next workout . . . J.R. Rider, back from his five gram suspension, told Sports Ill-Stated’s celebrated columnist he met his goal to return to the league before Michael Jordan."
