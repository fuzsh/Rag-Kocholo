        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. — The Detroit Pistons overcame a wild, emotional day to crush their old coach's new team. It didn't mean they were easily coming to grips with the blockbuster deal that shook the foundation of their core.\n\nIt was clear after their 101-83 rout of the Charlotte Bobcats on Monday night that it's going to take the Pistons time to warm to the idea that Allen Iverson is now their teammate — and Chauncey Billups and Antonio McDyess are headed to Denver.\n\n\"Do we like the trade? Maybe not. Ain't no telling,\" forward Rasheed Wallace said.\n\nAdded Tayshaun Prince: \"When you have six straight years with somebody, you've got that bond, that connection. Now all of a sudden it's gone.\"\n\nRichard Hamilton scored 19 points and the Pistons toyed with Larry Brown's Bobcats, improving to 3-0 and perhaps showing Iverson that he'll have plenty of scoring options when he takes over at point guard.\n\nBut from the tone of the subdued locker room, Iverson will have to win over his new teammates as he joins a team used to being among the Eastern Conference powers.\n\n\"Obviously we're all shocked by the situation,\" Prince said. \"We're going to go out and play. Under the circumstances I thought it was a good win. No matter who you play, when something happens like this it's tough for the team to go out and play. We were able to come out with a win.\"\n\nWallace added 15 points and four other players scored in double figures. Rodney Stuckey replaced the departed Billups at point guard and had nine points and three assists as Detroit shot 50 percent.\n\n\"It was a tough game,\" coach Michael Curry said. \"When your captain gets traded and Dice, who's not a captain, but is one of the emotional leaders of this team, it's a tough day for the guys.\"\n\nShannon Brown came off the bench to score 16 points, and Gerald Wallace had 15 points and 12 rebounds for Charlotte, which couldn't build off Saturday's win over Miami in the beginning of a week of reunions for the well-traveled Brown, who has his own problems.\n\nBrown, who has lamented managing partner Michael Jordan's inability to bring in more depth up front, was clearly frustrated after being overmatched by the team Brown led to the NBA title in 2004.\n\nCAVALIERS 100, MAVERICKS 81: At Dallas, LeBron James snapped a third-quarter tie with a flying rebound-layup, then Mo Williams broke things open early in the fourth, sending Cleveland over Dallas. James was only 8-of-20, but scored 29 points and took over when his team needed it. Cleveland let a 16-point lead fritter into a tie at 63, then Daniel Gibson missed a jumper from the corner, only to see James zoom in, grab the rebound and bank it in, all in one motion. He followed with a three-point play and a pair of free throws. Dirk Nowitzki was held to eight points on 3-of-11 shooting as the Mavericks fell to 0-2 at home. Their only lead was 2-0, on a jumper by Nowitzki. He missed his next seven shots, failing to hit another until late in the third quarter.\n\n76ERS 125, KINGS 91: At Philadelphia, Thaddeus Young scored 18 points, Lou Williams had 17 and Philadelphia routed winless Sacramento. Willie Green scored 16 points and Elton Brand had 15 for the Sixers, who were up 20 points at halftime and were able to stretch the lead in the second half instead of blowing it like they did Saturday at Atlanta.\n\nJason Thompson scored 17 points and Spencer Hawes had 15 for the Kings (0-4), who can't wait to head home after a dreary season-opening road trip. The Kings start a four-game homestand on Wednesday against Memphis.\n\nMAGIC 96, BULLS 93: At Orlando, Fla., Dwight Howard had 22 points and 15 rebounds, and Orlando held off Chicago after Andres Nocioni's missed 3-pointer at the buzzer. Rashard Lewis finished with 21 points and 11 rebounds as the Magic wiped out an early nine-point Bulls lead and led by as many as 17.\n\nDrew Gooden led Chicago with 21 points. Nocioni added 20 and Ben Gordon 17.\n\nGRIZZLIES 90, WARRIORS 79: At Memphis, Tenn., Marc Gasol had 27 points and 16 rebounds to help Memphis beat Golden State. Gasol went 9-for-11 from the field and the free throw line for Memphis, which ended a seven-game skid in the series against Golden State. The rookie also blocked three shots.\n\nAndris Biedrins had 16 points and 22 rebounds for Golden State. Stephen Jackson finished with 17 points and Corey Maggette scored 13 despite sitting out the second quarter with an injury."
