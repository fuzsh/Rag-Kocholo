        "text": "One of the faces that the Kentucky Wildcats will miss on defense this year will be cornerback Carrington Valentine. The three-year defender entered this year’s NFL draft and was selected 232nd overall in the seventh round by the Green Bay Packers.\n\nWhile we’re just one week into the NFL preseason, Valentine has made a strong first impression for his team. In fact, it looks like he could secure a spot on Green Bay’s roster.\n\nValentine was already impressing in training camp at a position that’s very thin at the moment behind Jaire Alexander (currently injured), Rasul Douglas, and Keisean Nixon. Add in that Eric Stokes is still out from an injury suffered last season, and Valentine has a great opportunity ahead of him.\n\nSuddenly, Valentine’s case becomes even more real.\n\nIn his first NFL game this past Friday vs. the Cincinnati Bengals, Valentine racked up four tackles, three passes defended, and an interception.\n\nPackers Vice President of Player Personnel Jon-Eric Sullivan recently said Valentine is a player “that looks like they belong.” Considering there are two weeks of NFL preseason remaining, that’s a strong opinion to make early on ahead of roster cuts.\n\nAgain, it seems like everything Valentine is doing is moving him in the right direction.\n\nThe former Wildcat was a very good college player, totaling 118 tackles and breaking up 15 passes in 25 games over the last two seasons. He was a player Kentucky could count on in the backend of their defense and has clearly brought that mentality to the Packers.\n\nGreen Bay hosts New England this Saturday and Seattle next weekend to round out their preseason before heading to Chicago to kick off Week 1 of the NFL regular season.\n\nTweet of the Day\n\nSeems like Valentine is well on his way to making Green Bay’s 53-man roster.\n\nHeadlines\n\nSeveral Kentucky Running Backs Prepared to Contribute – UK Athletics\n\nFor the past few years, there has been little doubt as to who would be the featured running back at Kentucky. But this year, there does not appear to be a clear-cut starter.\n\nChris Rodriguez shines in preseason debut vs. Browns - Cats Pause\n\nRodriguez rushed for a game-high 39 yards on just five carries, averaging 7.8 yards per rush in the Washington Commanders' 17-15 win over the Cleveland Browns.\n\nJack Givens Likes Way Adou Thiero Always Competes - Vaught’s Views\n\nHe’s always giving 100% effort.\n\nCarrington Valentine impresses in preseason debut with Packers - KSR\n\nFeels like he belongs in the NFL.\n\nDevin Leary Understands UK Must Block Outside Noise - Vaught’s Views\n\nSpoken like a true leader.\n\nGraham Mertz named starting quarterback at Florida - KSR\n\nWildcats host the Gators on September 30th.\n\nKentucky Running Backs All Make Each Other Better - Vaught’s Views\n\nThey should have a deep group this year.\n\nNazr Mohammed’s son, Sir, commits to Notre Dame - KSR\n\nUK was not on the final list.\n\nColts expect Jonathan Taylor to return to camp this week - ESPN\n\nCould be big for your fantasy football draft.\n\nRanking SEC quarterbacks in 2023 - USA Today\n\nLeary makes the top-3."
