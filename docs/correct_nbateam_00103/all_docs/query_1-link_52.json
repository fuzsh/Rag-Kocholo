        "text": "East Rutherford, NJ (Sports Network) - Raymond Felton tallied a game-high 22 points and Emeka Okafor contributed 21 points to go with nine rebounds and the Charlotte Bobcats hung on for a 95-87 victory over the New Jersey Nets in the front end of a home-and-home series.\n\nGerald Wallace posted a solid all-around effort with 16 points, 13 boards and six assists for Charlotte, which has won four of its last five games. Boris Diaw also played well, scoring 16 points, grabbing eight caroms and dishing out seven assists in the win.\n\nVince Carter led the Nets with 19 points as the club dropped their third game in four tries. Devin Harris and Brook Lopez each logged 14 points, while Harris connected on just 4-of-15 shots from the field.\n\nKeyon Dooling finishing off an 8-0 run that got the hosts within 78-75 with less than seven minutes left in the game. The lead shrunk to two before Diaw hit a bank shot at the three-minute mark for an 85-81 Charlotte lead.\n\nThe Nets missed their next five shots and Felton hit a jumper with 1:37 left for a six-point advantage. Harris then missed a contested shot just outside the lane, and Wallace sunk three straight free throws after being fouled taking a shot from behind the arc, and the Bobcats hit their next five from the stripe to seal the win.\n\nCharlotte led throughout the first frame and took a 23-21 lead after the opening 12 minutes. The teams each went on an extended run early in the second as Carter sparked the Nets with five points on a 9-0 spurt and Nazr Mohammed capped the Bobcats' 11-0 run on a jumper with just over five minutes left in the half for a 34-30 lead.\n\nFelton nailed a fade away before the halftime buzzer for a 50-41 Charlotte lead, and the 'Cats maintained a 73-65 edge heading to the fourth."
