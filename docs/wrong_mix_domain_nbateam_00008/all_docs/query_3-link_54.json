        "text": "Dwight Howard: “Then the guy with the flashlight comes, ‘You’re Dwight Howard, you’re 18, you’re not supposed to be in here, you gotta go.’ I got kicked out of the strip club at 18. My teammates left me. I went on, did, I don’t know what happened; they just stayed in there. But the fact that I had never experienced any of this stuff, I didn’t know what any of this was. Who was I going to talk to about this? A lot of my teammates at the time were telling me, ‘Hey Dwight, get as many women as you want. You’re Dwight Howard, man. Talk to as many girls as you want to.’ And at 18, I’m watching them, so I’m like, I guess I gotta do this.” “This is what I’m supposed to do. This is the cool thing, this is the in thing. Get the best cars, get the best women, and have sex. I had everything I could have ever wanted. So, it’s like, what would you do in that situation? People can always look on the outside, but they’ve never experienced that. I didn’t know what to do because I never had a guide. No one told me, ‘This ain’t the right thing, young fella. You can’t be doing all this.’ Now, do you think you can be that veteran and guide to young players in the league? Oh, no doubt, because I’ve been through it.”\n\nDwight Howard on decisión to leave the Lakers: “Looking back on it, man, I made an emotional decision. It was real emotional, and I heard that wasn’t good. They said Kobe said he wanted me to stay, but I don’t know, I don’t know. I wish I could go back and be like, let me make this decision wisely, weigh everything out. I don’t think I weighed my decision really well at the time. My emotions got the best of me.”"
