        "text": "You never know who you may run into around metro Atlanta.\n\nFormer NBA star Dwight Howard knows that well after he found out that one of his new neighbors was the Falcons' new starting quarterback.\n\nOn Tuesday, the former Laker posted a photo on X, the social media network formerly known as Twitter, that showed him and Kirk Cousins.\n\n\"Ran into Kirk Cousins and found out we were neighbors,\" Howard wrote, adding a laughing face and fire emoji.\n\nThe picture was taken at the Avalon Shops in Alpharetta.\n\nCousins is no stranger to the metro Atlanta area.\n\nHis wife Julie, grew up in the Atlanta suburbs. This is where they went on their first date, where they got married, where their youngest son was born. Her family still lives in the area. Cousins has spent the last six years doing his offseason training in the city.\n\n\"Iâ€™ve battled traffic through Downtown many, many times,\" he told reporters in March.\n\nWorking his way back from a torn Achilles tendon in his right foot that sidelined him because of an injury for the first time in his career, Cousins had a 103.8 passer rating in eight games for the Vikings last season, which was still the third best in the league despite the lost time.\n\nAs part of his four-year deal with the Falcons, Cousins agreed to a $180 million deal with $100 million guaranteed."
