        "text": "HOUSTON â€“ According to multiple media sources, former Houston Rockets center Dwight Howard has signed a free agent deal with the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nHoward was born in Atlanta, so this will be a trip home for the big man. He played his high school basketball in Atlanta and went directly to the NBA as the number one overall draft pick by the Orlando Magic in 2004.\n\nCLICK2VOTE: ARE THE ROCKETS BETTER WITHOUT DWIGHT HOWARD?\n\nReports say his deal is for 3 years and in the range of $70 million.\n\nHoward became a free agent when he opted out of the final year of his contract with the Rockets that would have paid him $23.5 million.\n\nHoward saw a steep decline in his production during his three seasons in Houston. This past season, his 13.7 points per game average was his lowest since he was a 20-year old rookie in 2004.\n\nKPRC will provide updates when they become available.\n\nTop 2016 NBA Free Agents | PointAfter"
