        "text": "The NBA held its second ever NBA Africa Game on Saturday in Johannesburg, South Africa and amongst the stars in attendance for both Team Africa and Team World were such established stars as Dirk Nowitzki, Kemba Walker, Demarcus Cousins, Kyle Lowry, Andre Drummond. Big time ball players on a big stage for good causes like The Nelson Mandela Foundation, SOS Children’s Villages South Africa (SOSCVSA) and UNICEF. Also in attendance for Team Africa was Atlanta Hawks starting point guard Dennis Schroder whose mother is from Gambia. With the recent changes to the Hawks roster, namely the trade of Dwight Howard (to Charlotte) and free agent move by team leader and leading scorer Paul Millsap (signed with Denver), Schroder will have to embrace a new role this coming season as the team leader.\n\nThree seasons ago following the greatest statistical season in Atlanta Hawks history, Schroder got a chance to watch current Minnesota Timberwolves point guard Jeff Teague on court with a ton of veteran talent (Millsap, Kyle Korver, Al Horford and DeMarre Carroll) and learn to be a playmaker. The last two years he still had Millsap to lean on in that regard, even last year Dwight Howard’s signing and a huge contract for Kent Bazemore kept Schroder out of the limelight. It lead to the best statistical season of his career. Atlanta’s version of Rajon Rondo with a jump shot scored a career high 17.9 points per game and 6.3 assists per game with a 85.5 free throw percentage to boot, in a little over 35 minutes per game. Schroder has arrived as an NBA player after being a relatively unknown first round draft pick four years ago. He’s not new to challenges but this is the next step in all players careers and Schroder is going to have to embrace it. Better still, he will embrace it.\n\nLate in the second quarter on Saturday, Schroder hit a three-pointer that tied the game at 48. He then came down court and found teammate Victor Oladipo coming off of a curl screen for an open jumper. Schroder scored eight points during the first half and looked like the leader a young Hawks team is going to need this season if they want to continue their streak of 10 straight playoff appearances. Players like second-year forwards Taurean Prince and Deandre Bembry and recent signee DeWayne Dedmon are locked on for the next couple seasons, along with newly resigned forward Ersan Ilyasova. Bazemore will probably be in the backcourt with Schroder and despite a so-so season last year, is a true team leader on and off the court but will have to be Schroder that takes the lead position on court if the team is going to be good enough to stay relevant. For the record “Relevant” is code for make the playoffs.\n\nThe game in Johannesburg was close throughout, Schroder’s assist to Denver Nuggets guard Emmanuel Mudiay brought Team Africa to within five points late in the third quarter. Another Schroder basket would make the score 77-75, he was playing his usual brand of fast paced basketball. Another Schroder assist, this time to Oladipo, made the score 89-88 in favor of Team World. A missed three-pointer at the top of the key early in the shot clock showed that Schroder is still the gambler that makes him the player that he is.\n\nTeam Africa lost 108-97 but the Atlanta Hawks and the team’s fan base can consider it a win. Schroder, who finished with 13 points, three assists and three rebounds, got better and looked comfortable playing with and against some of the league’s best players. A point guard and floor leader and coming soon, a team leader."
