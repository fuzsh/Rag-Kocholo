        "text": "CLEVELAND – The championship LeBron James craves more than any other, the one he came back home to get, is four wins away.\n\nThe Cavaliers are in the NBA Finals.\n\nJames scored 23 points, Kyrie Irving returned after missing two games and Cleveland reserved a spot in the finals with a 118-88 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday night to win the Eastern Conference title.\n\nBy sweeping the top-seeded Hawks, the Cavs earned their second trip to the finals, where they will face either Golden State or Houston.\n\nIt will be the fifth straight visit to the league's showcase event for the inimitable James, who returned to Cleveland after four years in Miami to try and end this city's championship drought dating to 1964.\n\nIf he can, James will have a title that would put him in a class by himself. Other players have won more championships, but none has ever done it for his ring-starved home region.\n\n\"We have everything it takes to win,\" James said after the Cavs were presented with the conference trophy.\n\nHowever, they've got their eyes on another one.\n\n\"Cleveland,\" owner Dan Gilbert said, addressing the crowd, \"We're not settling for this.\"\n\nJeff Teague scored 17 and Paul Millsap 16 for Atlanta, which won a team-record 60 games during the regular season and made the conference finals for the first time since 1970. But the Hawks were no match for the Cavaliers and had no answer for James, who nearly averaged a triple-double in the four games.\n\nJ.R. Smith added 18 points and Tristan Thompson had 16 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nIt was a tough way for the Hawks to end a remarkable season. They survived a tumultuous offseason, and their young roster gelled in January when they became the first franchise to go 17-0 in a calendar month. They went on to win 19 straight, improved their record by 22 wins over last season and beat Brooklyn and Washington to make their first conference finals since 1994.\n\nBut an injury to starting forward Thabo Sefolosha in April was followed by DeMarre Carroll injuring his knee in the series opener, before Kyle Korver's season ended in Game 2 with an ankle injury.\n\nThose all hurt, but it was James who inflicted the most pain.\n\nJames carried the Cavs to their first finals appearance in 2007, when they were swept by San Antonio. Cleveland was a heavy underdog then and it was assumed the Cavs would get back again. But James left in 2010 to join the Heat, a move that dropped the Cavaliers from relevance and into the draft lottery four straight years. But those days are over — Cleveland and King James reign supreme in the East.\n\nThe Cavs got through the last two rounds without forward Kevin Love, who sustained a season-ending shoulder injury. His arrival last summer, joining James and Irving to form a Big 3, made Cleveland the team to beat in the East.\n\nIt didn't go exactly as planned under first-year coach David Blatt.\n\n\"Were in Cleveland,\" Blatt cracked. \"Nothing is easy here.\"\n\nThe Cavs lost center Anderson Varejao to a season-ending Achilles injury in December and they were 19-20 before trading for Smith, Iman Shumpert and Timofey Mozgov, a trio that transformed Cleveland.\n\nIrving, who missed Cleveland's previous two games with tendinitis in his left knee, scored 16 and the All-Star point guard looked better than he has in weeks.\n\nUnlike Game 3, when he missed his first 10 shots, James started much better and scored 15 in the first half as the Cavs opened a 17-point halftime lead. They pushed it to 20 early in the third, withstood a brief rally by the Hawks and spent the fourth quarter playing their reserves and getting ready for a party and some time off before the finals.\n\nThis was Cleveland's night from the start.\n\nFollowing pregame introductions, James slapped hands with members of Gilbert's family and then with his boss. The two mended their broken relationship last summer, paving the way for James to re-sign with Cavs and try to deliver the title he couldn't during his first stint.\n\nJames had a bounce in his step and it wasn't long before he delivered one of his patented windmill dunks, prompting the Hawks to call a timeout while James ran the length of the baseline screaming at Cleveland fans to \"Get up!\"\n\nMoments later, Irving showed he could get up after being knocked down.\n\nHe drove to the basket for a layup and was fouled hard. Irving, though, quickly popped to his feet and James, who was on the bench at the time, walked several feet onto the floor to salute his teammate.\n\nThe Cavs know they'll need a healthy Irving to take the next step — the one to the top.\n\nKorver to have surgery: Atlanta Hawks guard Kyle Korver will have surgery on the right ankle he injured in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nKorver went to New York on Tuesday to get a second opinion from a specialist and it was determined he'll need an operation to repair his ankle. Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer did not say what damage Korver has in his ankle and there is no timetable for his return.\n\nThe NBA's best 3-point shooter in the regular season, Korver was injured when he was scrambling for a loose ball and his ankle was rolled on by Cleveland's Matthew Dellavedova.\n\nKorver made 221 3-pointers this season, helping the Hawks win 60 games and get to the conference finals for the first time since 1993-94. Korver made a 3-pointer in 51 straight games this season. He holds the league record with 127 consecutive games.\n\nLopez twins: Twin brothers Brook and Robin Lopez will co-host three specials featuring funny moments involving NBA players on and off the court.\n\n\"NBA Slam Funk!\" will run Monday, June 1 through Wednesday, June 3 on Disney XD. The 15-minute specials will include NBA bloopers, fan and mascot antics, circus shots and player outtakes.\n\nBrook Lopez, who plays for the Brooklyn Nets, and Robin, the center for the Portland Trail Blazers, will be joined by Disney stars Cameron Boyce of Disney's \"Descendants\" and \"Gamer's Guide to Pretty Much Everything,\" and Jacob Bertrand (\"Kirby Buckets\").\n\nDisney XD is a basic cable channel mixing live action and animated programming for kids ages 6-11, targeted toward boys. The Lopez brothers are known to be Disney and comic fans.\n\nRockets: Houston Rockets center Dwight Howard will not be suspended for Game 5 of the Western Conference finals against the Golden State Warriors after the NBA decided to uphold his flagrant 1 foul.\n\nNBA President of Basketball Operations Rod Thorn said in a statement Tuesday night that Howard was trying to free himself from Andrew Bogut when Howard \"recklessly hit him in the face with an open hand.\" Thorn said the contact was deemed unnecessary by game officials, who were aided by replay review, and the league doesn't \"see a reason to modify that call.\"\n\nHoward received a flagrant 1 foul early in the third quarter after throwing his left elbow at Bogut's head — connecting with the back of his hand — after the Warriors center made contact with him. Howard could've been suspended for Wednesday night's game by accumulation of flagrant foul points if the NBA upgraded the call to a flagrant 2.\n\nHoward said after the game he was reacting to Bogut's contact and wasn't trying to hurt him. Told Howard would be suspended for Game 5 if the NBA upgraded the call to a flagrant 2, Bogut said he doubted that would happen then.\n\nThe decision comes with the Warriors leading the series 3-1 and after Atlanta's Al Horford and Cleveland's J.R. Smith recently received stricter penalties for contact above the shoulders.\n\nHorford was assessed a flagrant 2 foul and ejected from Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals on Sunday night for striking Cavaliers guard Matthew Dellavedova above his shoulders late in the first half. The two got tangled on the floor while scrambling for a loose ball, and as Dellavedova was rolling up on his right knee, Horford brought his right arm down hard and struck the side of the scrappy Australian's head.\n\nA few weeks earlier, the NBA suspended Smith the first two games of the East semifinals against Chicago without pay after he swung backward and smacked Boston's Jae Crowder in the face in the final game of the first round. Smith was ejected and Crowder sprained a knee ligament.\n\nStu Jackson, who ruled on such matters when he was previously the NBA executive vice president of basketball operations, wrote on Twitter that he was \"baffled\" by the league's decision not to upgrade Howard's flagrant.\n\n\"Hard contact to face, reckless, released arm and flailed for free head shot and history,\" Jackson tweeted.\n\nBefore the league announced the ruling, Rockets coach Kevin McHale argued that Howard was retaliating to the contact made by Bogut and the flagrant foul should not be upgraded.\n\n\"I guess the one thing we'll learn is we should be the first one to grab,\" McHale quipped.\n\nWarriors coach Steve Kerr declined to say whether he thought Howard's flagrant should be upgraded, but he thought the contact was clearly above the shoulders.\n\n\"He elbowed him in the head, so I don't really know what the rule is,\" Kerr said. \"I'm not sure anyone really knows what the rule is. Seriously, it just seems like every case is a little different. There doesn't seem to be a definitive answer, and there is a lot of gray area in all these plays, so I understand that.\""
