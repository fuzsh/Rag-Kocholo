        "text": "Dwight Howard got his wish: He's out of Orlando.\n\nThe All-Star center was traded Friday to the Los Angeles Lakers, the last act of his long, drawn-out departure from the Magic. It took four teams, 12 players, five draft picks and countless rounds of talks with different clubs to get done, but it finally was completed Friday after the NBA reviewed and approved the deal.\n\nSo after an offseason where the Magic fired coach Stan Van Gundy and general manager Otis Smith, now they're truly beginning anew. Howard is gone as well, the second time the franchise has lost a big-man star to the Lakers.\n\nIn 1996, the Magic watched Shaquille O'Neal sign as a free agent with the Lakers. At least this time, when they lost someone with the \"Superman\" nickname, they got something back.\n\n\"Well, it looks like Superman has found a home,\" Lakers guard Kobe Bryant wrote on his Facebook page.A lot of players found new homes, including Andrew Bynum, sent by the Lakers to the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nThe 76ers sent Andre Iguodala - part of the U.S. Olympic team, set to play a semifinal game at the London Games on Friday- to the Denver Nuggets.\n\n\"I know my best basketball is ahead of me,\" Iguodala wrote on Twitter.\n\nOrlando got guard Arron Afflalo and forward Al Harrington from Denver, forward Moe Harkless and center Nikola Vucevic from Philadelphia, and forward Josh McRoberts and guard Christian Eyenga from the Lakers.\n\nThe Lakers got Howard, guard Chris Duhon and forward Earl Clark from Orlando. The Magic also traded guard Jason Richardson to Philadelphia.\n\nOrlando also gets five draft picks over five years."
