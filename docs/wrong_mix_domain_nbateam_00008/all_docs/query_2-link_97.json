Have an account? .\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers' trade for Dwight Howard was a four-team trade and one of the biggest blockbuster deals in NBA history.\n\nThe trade didn't help any franchise involved, as Howard's one-year stint in Los Angeles didn't work out, and the rebuild set the Orlando Magic back several seasons.\n\nThe deal included 12 players and five picks — here's where everyone involved is today.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.

Meanwhile, the Magic's attempt at a rebuild after losing their star came well short. The Magic broke a six-year playoff drought in 2019 and have made the postseason the last two years, but have a long way to go to championship contention.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nThe 76ers took a swing in the trade by landing Andrew Bynum and missed, while the Nuggets may have actually gotten the best end of the deal by landing just one player — Andre Iguodala.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEight years later, here's where all of the players and the draft picks involved in the trade ended up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trade centered on Dwight Howard, who was one of the NBA's best players at the time. His time in LA was a bust, however, as he battled injuries and chemistry issues. He left for the Houston Rockets in the summer of 2013.\n\nHoward hopped around the NBA after his season with the Lakers, playing for four teams over six years. After nearly falling out of the NBA, he is back with the Lakers this season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lakers also received Chris Duhon from the Magic.\n\nDuhon's lone season with the Lakers was his last in the NBA. He is now an assistant coach on the Illinois State basketball team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarl Clark, a fourth-year forward, also joined the Lakers in the trade.\n\nClark showed some promise in his NBA career but struggled with consistency. He last played in the NBA in 2015 and now plays overseas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Magic got a haul in return, receiving players from the Lakers, 76ers, and Nuggets. The 76ers sent second-year center Nikola Vucevic to the Magic.\n\nVucevic is still with the Magic. He has averaged 16 points and 10 rebounds for his career and was an All-Star in 2018-19.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Magic received Arron Afflalo from the Nuggets.\n\nAfflalo bounced around the league after the trade, playing for the Nuggets (again), Blazers, Knicks, Kings, and Magic (again). He last played in the NBA in 2018. He is now reportedly part of a group trying to purchase the Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAl Harrington, a scoring forward from the Nuggets, also landed with the Magic in the trade.\n\nHarrington played two more seasons, finishing his NBA career with the Wizards in 2014. He has since played in the Big 3 and is an advocate for legal marijuana and an investor in marijuana companies.\n\nSource: GQ\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 76ers sent the Magic rookie forward Moe Harkless, who hadn't yet played an NBA game.\n\nHarkless has since played for the Blazers and Clippers and is currently on the Knicks. He has career averages of 7.2 points and 3.7 rebounds per game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lakers traded Josh McRoberts to the Magic.\n\nMcRoberts last spent a brief stint with the Mavericks in the 2017-18 season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristian Eyenga was traded from the Lakers to the Magic.\n\nEyenga never played in the regular season for the Magic and hasn't played in the NBA since. He now plays overseas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Magic got several draft picks back in the trade, too. A 2013 second-round draft pick from the Nuggets became Romero Osby.\n\nOsby never played in the NBA. He played overseas until 2015 and now appears to be involved in real estate.\n\nSource: Twitter\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Nuggets also traded the Magic a 2014 first-round pick.

The Kings used it to draft De'Aaron Fox.\n\nFox is still with the Kings and looks like one of the NBA's bright, young stars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lakers sent a protected draft pick to the Magic that later turned into two second-round picks. The Magic used the first pick to draft Wesley Iwundu in 2017.\n\nIwundu has played three years with the Magic, averaging 5 points and 2 rebounds per game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Magic sent the second of those second-round picks to the Raptors, who then traded it to the Nets in another deal.

He hasn't played since 2014. He attempted a comeback in 2018, but was unsuccessful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 76ers received veteran guard Jason Richardson from the Magic in the deal.\n\nRichardson played two years with the Sixers and retired in 2015 with career averages of 17 points and 5 rebounds per game. He now plays in the Big 3.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Nuggets received Andre Iguodala from the 76ers.\n\nIn the end, the Nuggets may have gotten best player in the entire deal. Iguodala played one season with the Nuggets before joining the Warriors where he became a big part of their three championships and five Finals appearances.
