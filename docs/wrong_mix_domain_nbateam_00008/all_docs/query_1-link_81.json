        "text": "Mitch Kupchak’s wife and kids were on vacation without him.\n\nWhat was Kupchak doing? Sitting in his office. Just in case. Getting a few things done. But also just holding out hope, even if he had little reason for it.\n\nAlmost nothing material had occurred on the Dwight Howard front for three weeks.\n\nIn fact, the Lakers’ general manager sat down Aug. 8 with Lakers executive vice president of player personnel Jim Buss and reviewed the roster with Andrew Bynum as the starting center.\n\nWere Kupchak and Buss excited about it, OK with it or resigned to it? It’s of no consequence (though Kupchak said they “felt great about it”). The volcano that would wake the world from its Dwightmare and give the Lakers their best chance to return to the top of the NBA finally rumbled just hours later.\n\nIn the late afternoon that same day, Orlando Magic general manager Rob Hennigan called Kupchak on the phone in his office.\n\nThe Magic had something to propose.\n\n“It went from there,” Kupchak said.\n\nThe erupting trade that gave Howard to the Lakers, Bynum to the Philadelphia 76ers, Andre Iguodala to the Denver Nuggets and various young players, payroll flexibility and draft picks to the Magic would be official fewer than 48 hours later.\n\nKupchak welcomed Howard to the Lakers’ training facility in El Segundo the night of Aug. 10 and soon was on a red-eye flight to the East Coast to join his family – leaving behind that office where the ghosts from December finally had been exorcised.\n\n“Bewildered and furious” was how Kupchak had been described back on Dec. 8 after the NBA stopped the Lakers’ franchise-reviving trade for Chris Paul. Now the Lakers have Howard, seven months younger and nearly a foot taller than Paul, in line to continue the club’s championship aspirations in the post-Kobe Bryant era – even though it took more patience than brilliance from Kupchak and Buss to make it happen.\n\nThe Lakers had some talks with the Magic back before the March 15 trade deadline about acquiring the disgruntled Howard. They didn’t go far.\n\nWhen the NBA’s offseason market for player movement opened July 1 – with Howard reiterating his desire to leave Orlando – the Magic was far more serious about trading him. Said Kupchak of Hennigan that day: “Rob was very active.”\n\nWhile Steve Nash, much to their pleasant surprise, was falling into the Lakers’ lap via free agency, they were hatching all sorts of ideas and chasing down several possibilities in pursuit of Howard.\n\nThe process, Kupchak conceded, was “frustrating” for him as Hennigan led him down dead-end streets that had no telling signs.\n\n“I just never felt that there was a deal that they thought that they would do,” Kupchak said. “Without going into great detail, I just felt the Magic were just canvassing the league, which is the job. … I didn’t think there would be a deal. It got really quiet a couple weeks ago. Before that, it was very crazy – and then it just died. So we had kind of moved on.\n\n“We had signed Jordan Hill. We had signed Antawn Jamison. And we thought it was over.”\n\nBut as motivational speaker Zig Ziglar once said: “Failure is a detour, not a dead-end street.”\n\nIt turns out all those twists and turnarounds went into the Magic concluding that even if it didn’t want Bynum, the second-team All-NBA center, because of concerns about his weak knees and how few additional assets would come with him, it still made the most sense to use him via a third team to get the package Orlando sought. Unbeknownst to Kupchak, the Magic had come up with a third team in Philadelphia, an up-and-coming but too-small team that thought it was at a dead end without someone as sizable as Bynum, 24.\n\n“The upside was so much more than the risk,” 76ers majority owner Joshua Harris told reporters in Philadelphia on Wednesday. “You talk about intelligent risk. I thought this was intelligent risk.”\n\nHennigan learned his craft working his way up the Spurs’ and Thunder’s organizational charts, coming to believe in building from the ground up with youth. He liked some of the 76ers’ youngsters such as former USC center Nikola Vucevic – and he would’ve drafted St. John’s small forward Moe Harkless in June for Orlando if Philadelphia hadn’t nabbed him four spots before the Magic could pick.\n\nAs widely anonymous as Harkless is, he actually was key to when the Howard saga ended. The Magic had to wait 30 days after Harkless signed his rookie contract to trade for him, and when that time elapsed, Hennigan jumped.\n\nHired in June by the Magic, Hennigan had sold ownership on his idea that future possibilities are gold to established talent’s silver. He liked future possibilities more than taking Igoudala, 28, from the 76ers – so he figured out how to flip him to late entrant Denver for UCLA product Arron Afflalo, 26, and more picks.\n\nHennigan is just 30 – only four years older than Howard and 28 years younger than Kupchak. Hennigan has been widely criticized for not getting more for Howard, the 2011 NBA MVP runner-up, after reported offers from the Nets and Rockets. Hennigan’s summary, though, was that there is a difference between “what’s available in theory and what’s available in reality.”\n\nThe Lakers were always confident Howard would re-sign with them given who and where they are, besides how much more they can offer than any other club. Other teams interested in Howard were understandably worried that Howard might leave via free agency a year from now – and therefore cautious in what they offered.\n\nWhether he’s just a customer who is satisfied (Kupchak’s chosen description, actually, was “ecstatic”), Kupchak praised Hennigan upon emerging so nice and dry from that waterfall of frustrating trade talks.\n\n“Looking back on it, he did exactly what he was supposed to do,” Kupchak said. “He took his time. He looked at every opportunity, narrowed it down, negotiated, went back to a different team, negotiated some more, kept on coming back to you.\n\n“I never thought it would be a four-team deal; I thought it might be a three-team deal. So even when I thought there might be a deal there, he went out and found a fourth team to make it a better deal.”\n\nWith the new No. 12 Lakers jerseys already on sale and Kupchak staying across the country with his family through next week, Iguodala was finally introduced to the media in Denver on Thursday. He had been in London playing for Team USA in the Olympics at the time of the trade.\n\nOne reason the Nuggets got him was to have Iguodala on their team to guard Bryant four times a year and maybe in the Western Conference playoffs, too. Even with that in mind, Iguodala understood Bryant’s reaction in London after getting the text message from Kupchak that the Lakers, stung by two second-round playoff exits after consecutive NBA championships, had landed Howard.\n\n“Kobe is Kobe,” Iguodala said, “and he just does the nod to let you know: ‘We just pulled off something. And we are trying to bring it back to L.A.'”"
