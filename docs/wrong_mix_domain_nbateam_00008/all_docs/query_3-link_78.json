        "text": "A man named Stephen Harper has sued the former Lakers star, Dwight Howard, for assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and false imprisonment.\n\nThe report, published by Radar Online, includes screenshots of messages between Harper and the NBA Champion.\n\nThe supposed incident happened in 2021\n\nHarper, who apparently started exchanging messages with Howard on Instagram, claims the incident occurred at the Ex-NBA players' home in Georgia on July 19 in 2021.\n\nAccording to court documents, after months of exchanging explicit messages, Howard invited Harper to his home to have a sexual encounter.\n\nHarper claims that he and Howard were later joined at the house by another man dressed as a woman who called themselves \"Kitty\".\n\nHarper argues he didn't consent to them being joined by a third person but was convinced to stay by Howard.\n\nThe most explosive part of the suit alleges that Howard and Kitty began to perform sexual acts and Harper was forced to join even after saying \"no\". Harper says that Howard told him he was \"going to do whatever\" and he was \"going to like it\".\n\nThe accuser then claims that he feared for his safety if he resisted the sexual advances.\n\nAfter the act was over, Harper tried to go home in an Uber after feeling \"extremely violated and humiliated and was in complete shock,\" but Howard forced him to get a ride from Kitty.\n\nHoward denied being gay in 2019\n\nThis is not the first time Dwight Howard has been involved in a sexual scandal.\n\nIn 2019 the basketball player was involved in another legal dispute after a Masin Elije claimed he was in a same-sex relationship with him. Howard gave an interview to FOX Sports to deny the claims.\n\nHoward has also been on the receiving end of multiple sexual-natured accusations by the mother of his oldest child, a former Orlando Magic cheerleader named Royce Reed."
