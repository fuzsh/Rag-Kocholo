        "text": "The Atlanta Hawks are working on a contract agreement to hire Golden State Warriors executive Travis Schlenk as general manager, league sources told The Vertical.\n\nBarring any unforeseen snags, a deal could be completed soon, league sources told The Vertical.\n\nSchlenk has been part of a front office that’s helped shape one of the most talented rosters in NBA history.\n\nSchlenk has spent 12 years in the Warriors’ front office, including the past five as assistant GM under Bob Myers.\n\nAtlanta restructured its front office to create the opening, moving president Mike Budenholzer into strictly a head-coaching role and general manager Wes Wilcox to special adviser to ownership. Longtime NBA GM Rick Sund, a Hawks adviser, and assistant GM Jeff Peterson have been handling the Hawks pre-draft process now.\n\nAtlanta has gathered 11 draft picks over the next three years, but has serious roster decisions to make, including the possible re-signing of free-agent forward Paul Millsap and the uncertainty surrounding the two-years and $40 million left on center Dwight Howard’s contract."
