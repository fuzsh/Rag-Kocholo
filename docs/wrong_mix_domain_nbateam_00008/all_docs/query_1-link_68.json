When he came into the league fresh out of high school in 2004 he made a splash for the Orlando Magic on both sides of the ball. Eventually, he became the league's most dominant defensive player, earning three consecutive NBA Defensive Player of the Year awards from 2008 to 2011.\n\nIn 2012 Howard, an eight-time All-Star and All-NBA performer made his way from the sunshine state to sunny California to play for the Los Angeles Lakers. That season he continued to impress, but in 2013 he decided to fly halfway back to where it all began and settle in Texas with the Houston Rockets. Howard joined the Lakers for a second tenure in 2020 and won his first NBA championship. After a season with the Philadelphia 76ers, he returned to Los Angeles for the third time as a free agent in 2021.\n\nBook Dwight Howard for your Next Event"
