        "text": "Pops was at every thing that was important - but he wasn't around all the time Winter quarter of Sophomore year of college - I was getting crushed by expectations. I wasn't playing particularly well on the court and the classes I chose were killing me. After a solid freshman year, perhaps I got a little ambitious and in my sophomore year I signed up for Econ, Statistics, Calculus, and a PoliSci class that I ended up dropping mid quarter. Trying to take 20 units in the middle of the basketball season, what the heck was I thinking During the winter quarter we traveled extensively for games and were pretty much exhausted from long practices when we were on campus. I wasn‚Äôt focused and me and my college GF broke up several times that quarter - I was a mess. Well intended, but simply an undisciplined mess So we close out a mediocre sophomore season and about a week later Stanford mailed my quarterly grades to his office in San Diego. Pops flew up unexpectedly to visit me. Someone told me in the gym that he was out in the parking lot waiting for me. Pops would come up from time to time. He would buy me a great meal and slip me some cash along with some words of encouragement and a pat on the back and maybe a \"make sure you call your mother\" He was also unmercifully blunt with many of his messages. Me: ‚ÄúHey Pops‚Äù (not knowing what is coming) Pops was 6'4\" and I am 6'8\" but he towered over me as he went in and started jabbing his index finger into my chest over and over and over and over - you know that part of your chest just left of your sternum. Pops had been a gifted athlete known for his intelligence, quick feet and mean streak - that index finger jabbed into my chest and his glare burned into my soul. I was a strapping g young student athlete at the time but I was emotionally reduced to that 6 year old boy that knew a whooping was coming after I got caught doing something wrong during my childhood. Pops: \"Do you have any idea how many Wright's have suffered and sacrificed for you to have this opportunity to achieve here at this university\"???!!! Me: speechless, ashamed, embarrassed Pops: \"Get your shit together right the F@&k now young man\". And with that he left and drove off. I wandered back into the gym, finished my shower and rode my bike straight to the Library!!!! That was one of the worst days in my life That was one of the best days of my life. I never got anything less than a B after that - on the court I earned two time All PAC 10 honors and fulfilled my childhood dream of making the NBA - more importantly I kept my promise to my mother and received my degree in Qualitative Economics Pops and I never really spoke about that confrontation ever again, but 15 Years later at my induction to the Stanford Athletic HoF we shared a knowing look while I was on the podium thanking him Happy Father‚Äôs Day Pops\n\nAs we step into May, we are excited to share our next Employee Spotlight, an initiative where we will highlight the remarkable achievements, invaluable contributions, and unique personal interests of an individual from our impressive Global Startups team.

That's why I'm thrilled to introduce a new initiative - the Employee Spotlight. Quarterly, we will highlight the remarkable achievements, invaluable contributions, and unique personal interests of an individual from our impressive SUP team. To kick things off, please join me in celebrating our very first spotlight honoree, Kathryn Van Nuys affectionately known as KVN! Over her 6 years at AWS, KVN has been a tireless advocate for the importance of specialization and domain expertise, which is now a cornerstone of our Startups Team and AWS strategy. In April 2023, Kathryn became the Head of Startups Business. She brought together former globally-aligned teams into NAMER to drive towards consistent goals and a more unified strategy for 2024. Kathryn's team is responsible for driving Startup initiatives such as Generative AI Accelerator, Compute for Climate Fellowship, CTO Fellowships, Pitching Better, Fast Pass, and Field Trips. Here are some of KVN‚Äôs key achievements: ‚Ä¢ As the first Fintech BD on the Venture Capital BD team, she set the framework for startup classification and tagging, laying the foundation for specialized SUP efforts. KVN went on to became the head for global Specialized segments in 2022, and created the framework for how to assess new industry or technology focuses, and expanded into Cybersecurity and Climate Tech. ‚Ä¢ Through initiatives like the NY Fintech showcase, she helped acquire new startup customers and drive deeper engagements with AWS enterprise FSI customers. She was instrumental in acquiring leading Fintechs such as Alloy, nCino, Socure, and Ocrolus. ‚Ä¢ KVN created a Fintech EBC session and is a regular speaker for Fintechs and financial services customers. Her team created EBC Weeks for startups, a valuable customer engagement mechanism now being broadly used across SUP. Most notably, Kathryn achieved these impressive professional milestones while also raising two young daughters, having joined the company just 6 weeks before the birth of her first child. KVN is an avid reader (sci-fi is her favorite), a devoted runner and (former) soccer player, and loves to travel having lived in both Prague and London. As you can see, KVN is someone we can always count on to exhibit Ownership, have a Bias for Action, and Deliver Results. She demonstrates the very best of our SUP team and we are incredibly grateful for her leadership and partnership.

Every dribble, every practice, every sprint, every early morning lift, every bus ride, every late night in the library, every crucial moment in a game \"Rev\" was the leader who led us by example - Academic All American - Most Inspirational - Team Captain Rev was an infinitely better student (both smarter and more disciplined) than I was so I leaned on his notes and mentorship for multiple classes of Econ and Calculus and he was a willing tutor for someone like me who really needed it . He oozes positivity and a ferocious competitive nature in a way that is infectious to all those around him. There has never been a more \"Stanford Dude\" ever - born in Stanford Hospital and soared in both athletics and academics while an undergrad Stanford University and at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business As Rev mentioned below we had some fiery Pac 10 battles with the likes of Sean Elliott, Steve Kerr, Reggie Miller, Gary Payton, Detlef Schrempf, Christian Welp, Kevin Johnson, Don MacLean and other players that went on to great professional careers. I bet any of these legends would want to compete against ANYONE but Rev again!!!! My brother Rev is the best of the best among us. While I would love for my young son or nephews to be coached by him, I think Rev has an even higher calling on his life and hope that I get to address him one day as Stanford President Reveno, Senator Reveno or Governor Reveno one day.
