Caught up in the excitement, Cleveland gets rowdy and talks smack to the players from the sideline throughout the game. The basketball champs, feeling hurt, seek revenge by paying a surprise visit to Stoolbend and putting Cleveland in his place.\n\nTest of Character and Weakness\n\nSixteen household names arrive in the desert, about to endure some of the harshest, most grueling challenges from the playbook of the actual Special Forces selection process.

In this unique series, the only way for these recruits to leave is to give up on their own accord, through failure or potential injury, or by force from the DS. Special Forces: World's Toughest Test is the ultimate test of their physical, mental and emotional resilience; revealing the celebrities' deepest and truest character. Find out who will quit and who will survive.\n\nThe Semifinals: Itâs All in the Details\n\nWith only four teams of classically-trained and self-taught bakers left, the semifinalists take on the safety bake round, inspired by guest judge Dwight Howardâs favorite dessert. Then, in the final elimination bake of the season, the pressure heats up as the culinary clue finders face-off to secure a coveted spot in the grand finale and inch closer to the $100,000 prize.\n\nWeakness\n\nSixteen household names arrive in the desert, about to endure some of the harshest, most grueling challenges from the playbook of the actual Special Forces selection process.
