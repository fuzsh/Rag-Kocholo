        "text": "Dwight Howard is coming home.\n\nAfter a lengthy afternoon meeting with the Hawks on the first day of NBA free agency, the eight-time All-Star center agreed to a three-year, $70.5 million contract with his hometown team Friday night, according to a person familiar with the situation.\n\nThe deal has an average annual salary of $23.5 million, the same figure he was due before he opted out of the final year of his contract with the Rockets. The new contract cannot be signed until the end of the NBA moratorium Thursday.\n\nIt is unclear what the move means for Al Horford, the Hawks’ four-time All-Star center, who began meeting with other teams as he entered free agency.\n\nHorford reportedly will meet with the Rockets and Celtics on Friday. Hawks management said before free agency that re-signing Horford was priority, and the team accounted for a maximum deal in its salary cap. The Hawks could still re-sign Horford.\n\nPortland and Turner\n\nThe Portland Trail Blazers agreed to terms with free-agent Evan Turner on a four-year, $70 million contract.\n\nTurner’s agent, Kevin Bradbury, confirmed the deal first reported by Yahoo Sports. The former Ohio State star drew interest from several teams.\n\nTurner, who was drafted No. 2 overall by the 76ers in 2010, spent the last two seasons with the Boston Celtics. Last year, the 6-foot-7 wing averaged 10.5 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.4 assists as Boston’s sixth man.\n\nIt was his best season since 2013-14.\n\nPelicans and Hill\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans and former Indiana Pacers forward Solomon Hill agreed to a four-year contract worth about $50 million, a person familiar with the negotiations said Friday.\n\nThe person, who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said the contract is worth at least $48 million, with additional incentives of about $2 million.\n\nHill’s decision was influenced by a meeting with Pelicans personnel, including coach Alvin Gentry, shortly after free agency began, the person said.\n\nHill is expected to enter training camp as a front-runner to start at small forward.\n\nThe 6-foot-7 Hill has averaged 6.0 points and 3.1 rebounds in his first three NBA seasons since the Pacers drafted him 23rd overall in 2013 out of Arizona.\n\nHornets and Batum\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets and unrestricted free agent Nic Batum came to terms on a new contract.\n\nA source with knowledge of the situation told the Observer on Friday morning that Batum agreed to a five-year, $120 million deal.\n\nBatum came to the Hornets in a June 2015 trade with the Portland Trail Blazers. The Hornets sent shooting guard Gerald Henderson and power forward Noah Vonleh to the Trail Blazers to make this happen.\n\nHornets coach Steve Clifford made Batum a huge part of the Hornets’ offensive scheme, and Batum came through with season averages of 14.9 points, 6.1 rebounds and 5.8 assists.\n\nThe Hornets were not coy in expressing their strong desire to re-sign Batum. General Manager Rich Cho said Batum was the team’s top priority in remarks days after the Hornets season ended and repeated that position several times.\n\nMagic and Fournier\n\nThe Orlando Magic reached a deal to re-sign restricted free agent Evan Fournier, agreeing in principle Friday to a five-year contract worth $17 million per season.\n\nThe contract will include a player option for the fifth season that will enable Fournier to become a free agent during the summer of 2020, the source said.\n\nIncentives will be built into the contract that could add an additional $1 million each season to the deal.\n\nAccording to the Orlando Sentinel, Fournier turned down more lucrative offers from three other teams. That said, the Magic were the only franchise that could offer him a fifth season.\n\nRe-signing Fournier was one of the Magic’s top priorities this summer, and Fournier wanted to get a deal done, too."
