Dwight Howard is wasting no time getting back in the community now that he's an Atlanta Hawk -- nor is he waiting for official practices to get to know his teammates.

Howard spent part of Thursday at South Gwinnett High School helping out at Lou Williams' youth basketball camp. Williams is a guard for the Los Angeles Lakers who went to South Gwinnett. Howard spent time on the court with the campers and gave a speech to the kids as well.

"It's a great feeling," said Howard. "I'm just blessed and thankful to be able to inspire the younger generation."

Howard also gave an update on his new team. After officially joining the Atlanta Hawks, he's determined to build relationships with his new teammates and figure out what it will take to win, and win big in Atlanta.

"I've talked to a lot of the guys on the team, we've just been talking about winning," said Howard, a Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy alumnus. "We've talked about what we can do as a team to take things to the next level. Actually just left the arena with the staff, we were talking about how we can all learn and get better. I think everybody's on the same page. I think we're going to have an unbelievable year and I think the rest of my career in Atlanta will be great."
