Tennessee chose to place its men’s tennis program under the direction of its most legendary and decorated alum—one of the greatest ATP pros of his generation—and he has positioned the Volunteers among the nation’s elite.\n\nThe 2024-25 campaign marks Chris Woodruff’s eighth season as head coach at his alma mater and his 23rd year on staff. The multiple-time ATP Tour champion and former world No. 29 singles player served as assistant coach and associate head coach at Tennessee from 2002 until his promotion to head coach on May 19, 2017.\n\nTennessee Director of Athletics Danny White announced in July of 2021 that Woodruff’s contract had been extended through June of 2026.\n\nTeam success has flourished under Woodruff’s leadership. In 2021, that took the form of an SEC Tournament title, a run to the NCAA Championships semifinals and a year-end No. 4 national ranking. Woodruff guided the Vols back to the national semifinals in 2022, the program's first back-to-back NCAA semifinal appearances since a three-year run to the semifinals or further in 2000-02.\n\nA byproduct of a healthy team-first culture is a surge of individual prosperity. Case in point: Pat Harper and Adam Walton captured the 2021 NCAA Doubles Championship and Johannus Monday earned SEC Player of the Year recognition in back-to-back years in 2023 and 2024.\n\nWoodruff has coached two different NCAA Doubles Championship tandems (also Mikelis Libietis and Hunter Reese in 2014), two additional doubles teams who advanced to the NCAA finals and two NCAA singles finalists in John-Patrick Smith (2008) and Rhyne Williams (2011).\n\nWoodruff draws from his worldwide pro tour experience—which includes seven wins against former world No. 1 players, including Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, (whom Woodruff upset in the 1996 French Open), Yevgeni Kafelnikov, Thomas Muster, Gustavo Kuerten, Marcelo Rios and Carlos Moya—while now helping Tennessee student-athletes obtain a world-class education and reach their professional tennis goals following successful collegiate careers of their own.\n\nSince returning to Tennessee in a coaching capacity following his ATP retirement, Woodruff has helped the Vols earn a remarkable 40 All-America and 53 All-SEC selections.\n\nHis recipe for creating well-rounded, winning teams includes a balanced combination of carefully selected international phenoms and a steady dose of homegrown talent. Woodruff has helped coached players from over 25 different countries in addition to many in-state stars, including All-Americans Rhyne Williams, Ben Rogers, Davey Sandgren and current ATP standout and U.S. Olympian Tennys Sandgren. Rising ATP star Adam Walton (2017-22) from Australia also grew his game exponentially under Woodruff's leadership.\n\nDuring Woodruff’s spectacular professional playing career, which ran from 1993-2002, he claimed two ATP tour championships (1997 Montreal Super 9 Canadian Open and the 1999 Miller Lite Hall of Fame Tennis Championships). In 2000, he enjoyed his best year on the tour as he advanced to the quarterfinals of the Australian Open and clinched the United States’ Davis Cup win over Zimbabwe.\n\nFollowing his professional playing career, Woodruff completed requirements for his Psychology degree from UT in 2005.\n\nA lifetime resident of Knoxville, Woodruff is married to Jennifer Woodruff. He has five children: Olivia, Tate, Carter, Ava and Chase.\n\nCHAMPIONSHIP ROOTS ESTABLISHED ON ROCKY TOP\n\nBorn and raised in Knoxville, Woodruff lettered for the Vols in 1992 and 1993, garnering All-America honors both years under the tutelage of coach Mike DePalmer Sr.\n\nWoodruff was crowned NCAA singles champion in 1993 and remains the only Vol to capture that title. He finished that season ranked No. 1 nationally, becoming the only Vol since Paul Annacone in 1984 to finish the year atop the rankings.\n\nIn addition to his 1993 national championship, Woodruff also was named ITA Rookie of the Year in 1992 and received the USTA Sportsmanship Award in 1993.\n\nIn only two seasons of collegiate tennis, Woodruff finished with an 81-16 singles record, with 45 of those wins coming as a sophomore in 1993. His career singles winning percentage of .835 remains third all-time in the Tennessee records book.\n\nHis pre-collegiate tennis training took place locally at Knoxville Racquet Club.\n\nIn 2008, Woodruff became the fifth Vol in UT history to be inducted into the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Hall of Fame. He was elected to the Tennessee Tennis Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\nYEAR-BY-YEAR HEAD COACHING HISTORY\n\n2023-24: The Vols were able to build and improve on the 2023 season and make a return to the NCAA Quarterfinals. The program also reached the NCAA Super Regionals for a fifth consecutive season, which marks Tennessee's most consecutive appearances in the Round of 16 or further since the tournament adopted its current 64-team format in 1999. Finishing the dual season with a 25-7 overall record, Woodruff's Vols finished second in the SEC regular-season standings for the second straight year.\n\nSenior Johannus Monday became the fourth player in SEC history to be named SEC Player of the Year for back-to-back campaigns. Monday has earned the only two SEC Player of the Year awards under Woodruff's watch as head coach. Woodruff was Tennessee's first recipient of the honor, in 1993.\n\nDuring the indoor season, Tennessee advanced to the ITA National Indoor Championship for a fourth consecutive year, picking up a pair of wins in New York.\n\nMonday earned singles All-American honors and a doubles accolade alongside Angel Diaz. Junior Shunsuke Mitsui was named a singles All-American. Monday and Mitsui were also tabbed to the All-SEC First Team to add to their impressive resumes.\n\n2022-23: Woodruff's Vols saw continues success in 2023. The program reached the NCAA Super Regionals for a fourth consecutive season, the program's most consecutive runs to the Round of 16 or further since 2008-11. Finishing the dual season with a 23-8 overall record, Woodruff's Vols finished second in the SEC regular-season standings.\n\nJunior Johannus Monday became the fourth Vol in program history to be named SEC Player of the Year and the first to do so under Woodruff's watch as head coach. Woodruff was Tennessee's first recipient of the honor, in 1993.\n\nDuring the indoor season, Tennessee advanced to the ITA National Indoor Championship for a third consecutive year, picking up a pair of wins in Chicago.\n\nThree Vols collected All-SEC honors, as Monday and Emile Hudd achieved first-team status, while Shunsuke Mitsui was tabbed to the All-SEC Second Team for the second time in as many seasons. Additionally, graduate student Pat Harper earned ITA Doubles All-America status for a third straight season.\n\n2021-22: Coming off a record-setting year in 2021, Woodruff kept his foot on the gas pedal during the 2022 dual season, guiding the Vols back to the NCAA Semifinals for a second consecutive year. Tennessee (26-8) has now finished with single-digit losses in each of Woodruff’s five seasons as head coach at his alma mater.\n\nWoodruff saw the perseverant group of Vols go 2-0 at the ITA Kickoff Weekend to advance to the ITA Indoor National Championships in Seattle for the second time since 2014. While in Seattle, Tennessee earned three top-13 wins and advanced to the championship match.\n\nTennessee went on to reach the SEC Tournament semifinals and won 12 of its final 15 matches to close the season. In all, 11 of Tennessee's 26 wins came over top-25 opponents, with four of those coming against top-10 competition.\n\nWoodruff saw graduate student Adam Walton—the sixth member of Tennessee’s 100/100 wins club—and sophomore Johannus Monday become first team All-SEC members for a second year in a row, while newcomers Emile Hudd, a senior, and freshman Shunsuke Mitsui garnered second team All-SEC recognition in their debut seasons on Rocky Top. Additionally, Walton and Monday each achieved ITA Singles All-America status for a second consecutive year. Walton and fellow Aussie Pat Harper earned doubles All-America status following their final ITA ranking of No. 10.\n\n2020-21: Woodruff guided the Vols to heights the program hadn’t seen since 2010. Tennessee claimed the program’s fourth SEC Tournament title and 13th overall conference crown with a dramatic, 4-3 victory over top-ranked Florida in the tournament final. The Vols then stormed to the semifinal round of the NCAA Championships for the first time since 2010, knocking off Alabama A&M, in-state foe Memphis, No. 18 Arizona and No. 11 Georgia on its way to concluding its strongest season under Woodruff’s tutelage.\n\nWoodruff then helped guide the doubles pairing of Adam Walton and Pat Harper to the 2021 NCAA Doubles National Championship. The Australian duo’s title marked UT’s third all-time NCAA doubles crown.\n\nWoodruff also oversaw the development of freshman standout Johannus Monday, who earned several accolades in his first season as a Vol. The Hull, England, product garnered the SEC’s Freshman of the Year award and earned inclusion on the All-SEC First Team, the SEC All-Freshman Team and the ITA All-American Team. Monday’s stellar debut season—which featured an incredible 13 victories over ranked opponents and a 31-6 singles record—was capped with the prestigious ITA Rookie of the Year Award.\n\nTennessee’s 28 team victories in 2021 were its most since 2010. Other team highlights from 2021 included UT’s first ITA Indoor National Championships berth since 2014, its first NCAA semifinal appearance since 2010 and its first SEC title since 2010.\n\n2019-20: The Volunteers jumped out to an impressive 14-2 record and were off to their best start since 2011 before the season was cut short due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. In just 16 matches, UT swept its opponents nine times—the most sweeps in a season by a Tennessee squad since 2013. The Vols had just opened SEC play when the season was canceled and owned a 2-1 record after the first three league matches.\n\nAfter playing No. 2 singles for the duration of the 2018-19 season, junior Adam Walton appeared poised to elevate his game in the spring of 2020, as he boasted a 12-1 record at the No. 1 position—including five wins over ranked opponents. Martim Prata, a sophomore from Lisbon, Portugal, also exhibited a leap in performance in the spring of 2020, as he had a 12-2 record on the year and was 6-0 at No. 2 singles before the season was cut short.\n\n2018-19: Woodruff followed up his successful first season as head coach with even greater results in year two. The Vols won 22 matches—UT’s first back-to-back 20-win seasons since 2010 and 2011—finished 8-4 in the SEC and reached the SEC Tournament final for the first time since 2013. At the NCAA Championships, the Big Orange defeated Radford and NC State to reach the round of 16 for the first time since 2014. Individually, Tennessee placed three players—Timo Stodder, Adam Walton and Scott Jones—on All-SEC Teams. Stodder earned All-America honors in singles and doubles, wrapping up his career as a three-time All-American. Preston Touliatos earned All-America honors in doubles for the second time in his career and, along with his teammate, Stodder, became the first Tennessee doubles team since 2014 to reach the semifinal round at the NCAA Championships.\n\n2017-18: In his first season as head coach—following a lengthy tenure on the UT staff as an assistant and eventually associate head coach—Woodruff led one of the great turnarounds in program history, coaching the Vols to 21 wins in 2018 compared to 13 the previous spring. Tennessee faced a tough conference schedule but came out of the regular season as the No. 4 seed entering the SEC Tournament. In early February, Woodruff tested the doubles combination of Preston Touliatos and Luis Valero. A few short months later, the duo finished the dual-match season with a 12-4 record and earned a bid to compete in the doubles tournament at the NCAA Championships."
