        "text": "Okay, I'll admit that the morning commute from my home in Sheffield (Yorkshire, UK) was never exceptionally difficult. I had to walk all the way from the coffee machine in the kitchen, up the stairs and down the hallway to my home office. This wasn't Downton Abbey either, but a small semi-detached house. Occasionally I'd encounter the hazard of finding my dog Evan sleeping on the stairs, he's fond of doing that, but otherwise the journey was never hampered by bad weather, rain, nor snow.\n\nThis didn't mean though that the experience was either easy or pleasurable. I was still living in the UK, and in Sheffield, and I had to go out and about into the great beyond on a regular basis, even if it was only to walk my dogs. This is where we hit the problems.\n\nI had come to the conclusion that the UK was just not a nice place to live and work in any more. The catalyst had been the crash of 2008 (which I and my friends all saw coming by the way, so I have no idea why politicians and bankers can still claim to be so ignorant). With the squeeze on public-finances, wages, and services, society began the inexorable journey down-hill.\n\nMy house in Sheffield was in a peaceful cul-de-sac of eco-homes. Sadly this cul-de-sac was on the periphery of a very sizeable council estate that you had to traverse in order to get anywhere. This estate was very green and pleasant back in 2008, but by the time 2019 rocked around it was littered with rubbish and fly-tipping, stabbings and muggings were becoming an all-too-regular occurrence, and the volume of criminality, and its severity, had increased from basically nothing to far too much.\n\nThis isn't to say that the estate had turned from a green and pleasant land into a slum, but the deterioration was pronounced and unpleasant. There comes a point in everybody's life when you know that you just can't stay in a place any more, and have to leave. I had a similar experience, as did several of my friends, when we lived in Brighton (UK) and the city started to become overrun with drugs around the turn of the century.\n\nI had been planning a move to the continent for some time, and I was lucky that I had an opportunity to move to a fantastic property in France. Not everybody can do this as many have ties that keep them either in the UK, or in a specific geographic area, such as the need to maintain a \"proper\" job, or because they have children. I had neither of those ties, and am lucky enough that I can work anywhere there is an Internet connection.\n\nSo I find myself now sitting outdoors in the Limousin region of France, having been working this morning on my laptop with Evan laying next to me on the bench (this new cottage has very narrow stairs so he's progressed on to sleeping where I work, it's not such a bad thing). The sun is shining, the peace is lovely, and I can happily wander around the adjoining field with the dogs while leaving the house doors and windows open.\n\nIs there a trade-off to all this? Well there is a barrier to productivity in so far as it's a lovely summer, friends are wanting to come and visit, and there's quite a large garden here that needs attention. It's also astonishing how quickly I have adapted to a slower and quieter pace of life, which ultimately does mean I end up doing less during the day.\n\nOn the upside though the stress levels have dropped, my concentration is improving, and I really can understand why people, especially creatives, have wanted to disappear into the middle of nowehere all the way back from Van Gough and the classical painters and composers touring Europe for inspiration and tranquility from the 1700's.\n\nIt was a lot of upheaval though, moving my entire life from one country to another, along with all of my possessions. Was it worth it? I can answer a resounding yes to that question. The cost of living is considerably cheaper, not the least of which is because next day, and even same day delivery is something that simply doesn't exist here, nor do shopping centres in the nearest town, not the nearest to me anyway; this almost completely eliminates temptation and impulsiveness.\n\nIf you have the opportunity to get away from it all, perhaps even just to rent for a summer from AirBnB or privately from a Facebook holiday rentals group, I'd say go for it, you won't regret it! The better quality of life, cleaner air and better health, peace, quiet, and tranquility have for me all added up to a huge overall improvement in productivity. I'm now into my sixth week here, and after a short break to settle-in, I'm getting back to things with gusto. The walk from the coffee machine might be a little longer than it was before, but I'm really enjoying working again for the first time in many years."
