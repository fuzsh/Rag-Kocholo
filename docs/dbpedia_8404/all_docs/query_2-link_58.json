        "text": "I am a professional painter and strive to create art that has the power to connect to the soul. My work consists of both large canvases and small works on paper using a variety of paints and wood dyes.\n\nI aim to produce thoughtful mood â€“ provoking paintings that always have a powerful physical form, overlaid with a strong spiritual overtone.\n\nIn my most recent work I have been using symbols and sacred geometry to enhance the spiritual dimension of each painting.\n\nMy work is held in corporate and private collections both in Britain and overseas and is on show in galleries in London, Yorkshire, Edinburgh and the USA."
