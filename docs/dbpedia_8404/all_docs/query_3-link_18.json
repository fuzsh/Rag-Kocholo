        "text": "1993-present\n\nLatest News: Kelsea Ballerini Announces New Album Patterns\n\nCountry music star Kelsea Ballerini is set to release her fifth studio album Patterns on October 25. The Grammy-nominated singer announced the new album on August 8, sharing a photo of the cover art that features Ballerini sitting atop a pile of luggage on the beach with the caption, “Let’s start unpacking.”\n\nThe 30-year-old singer-songwriter previewed Patterns with the release of her new song “Sorry, Mom” on August 9, in which she confesses her past mistakes. The already released “Cowboys Cry Too” featuring Noah Kahan will also appear on the album.\n\nPatterns follows Ballerini’s 2023 EP Rolling Up The Welcome Mat, which was inspired by her divorce from Australian country music singer Morgan Evans. The album became a big hit, scoring major nominations such as a 2024 Grammy nod for Best Country Album. Ballerini also found love again. She has been dating actor Chase Stokes since last year.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Ballerini explained Patterns offers an “accurate snapshot” of her life. “I think that people probably expect this really happy-go-lucky, love, mushy, gushy record from me. That’s not the case,” she said. “And I’m really proud of that. It would have been easy to, I think, just collect the really beautiful parts of my life that I’ve dusted off and found the last couple of years, but that’s not the fullness of my experience.”\n\nWho Is Kelsea Ballerini?\n\nGrammy-nominated country singer Kelsea Ballerini is known for songs such as “Peter Pan,” “Love Me Like You Mean It,” and “Dibs.” Born and raised in the country hotbed of Tennessee, Ballerini moved to Nashville as a teenager in the hope of beginning a music career. She signed with the Black River Entertainment label at age 19 and achieved immediate success with her debut album, The First Time, from 2015. Her songs often contain personal lyrics and a mix of country and pop influences. Ballerini will release her seventh album, Patterns, in October 2024.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nFULL NAME: Kelsea Nicole Ballerini\n\nBORN: September 12, 1993\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Mascot, Tennessee\n\nSPOUSE: Morgan Evans (2017-2022)\n\nASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Virgo\n\nWhere Is Kelsea Ballerini From?\n\nKelsea Nicole Ballerini was born on September 12, 1993, in Mascot, Tennessee, and raised in nearby Knoxville. She is the only child of Ed Ballerini, who worked as a sales manager for a radio station in the city, and Carla Denham, a marketing professional in the publishing industry.\n\nBallerini described her childhood as “very Southern,” complete with “church on Sunday, a big family, [and] fried chicken.” She and her parents shared a rural plot of land with other family members, as well as three cows and a goat.\n\nBallerini showed an interest in the arts from a young age. She took dance lessons for 10 years, earning the alliterative nickname “Ballerini the Ballerina,” and competed for a local hip-hop dance team. She also participated in her church’s choir and glee club. Kelsea wrote her first song as a gift to her mom, Carla, after forgetting to get her a present for Mother’s Day.\n\nAt age 12, Ballerini grappled with her parents’ divorce. She began suffering from bulimia around this time, also taking diet pills and working out excessively. She eventually sought help for her eating disorder at age 18 after passing out several times. “I think, for me, it was a source of control,” she said in a 2021 interview with People. “There are still days where I revert back to being that 12-year-old, and I have to catch myself and hold myself accountable to the work I’ve done.”\n\nIn the meantime, Ballerini had her first meeting with a Nashville record label at age 14, though she was rejected and bluntly told she sounded too similar to Taylor Swift. She and her mother moved to the city soon after. Kelsea graduated from Centennial High School in the suburb of Franklin, Tennessee, and attended Lipscomb University starting in 2011.\n\nMusic Career\n\nAlthough she grew up in the epicenter of country music, Ballerini initially found inspiration in primarily pop artists. Britney Spears, *NSYNC, Shania Twain, and Kelly Clarkson were among her early idols. She has called Clarkson her favorite artist of all time: “I think that she’s the best vocalist in the whole world, but my favorite is watching her interviews because she’s so 200 percent herself,” she told Billboard in 2016.\n\nHoping to make it big like Clarkson, Ballerini continued to pursue music while at Lipscomb University, which is located in Nashville, and performed in variety shows. She reached an agreement with her mother that she would drop out of college if she caught her big break in music. That finally came in 2013, when Black River Entertainment signed the 19-year-old and added her to its artist roster. Next came making her breakout first album.\n\nEarly Albums: The First Time and Unapologetically\n\nKelsea Ballerini performs in April 2015, one month before releasing her first album.\n\nBallerini showed she would be a force from the start with her debut studio record The First Time, released in May 2015. She became the first female country artist to have her first three singles—“Love Me Like You Mean It,” “Dibs,” and “Peter Pan”—from an introductory album all reach No. 1 on Billboard’s Country Airplay chart. “Peter Pan” is also her only song to date to reach No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart.\n\nOff the now-platinum-certified album’s success, Ballerini was named New Female Vocalist of the Year at the 2016 ACM Awards. She also embarked on her first headlining tour later that year and received a nomination for Best New Artist at the subsequent Grammy Awards, ultimately losing to Chance the Rapper.\n\nFurther success arrived with her second studio album Unapologetically in November 2017 and its singles “Miss Me More” and “Legends.” The latter became the singer’s fourth No. 1 Country Airplay hit, and the album peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard 200, showcasing Ballerini’s crossover appeal.\n\nMore accolades poured in, as Ballerini received a Grammy nomination for Best Country Album. Then in April 2019, she officially became a member of the Grand Ole Opry—the youngest in the organization’s history at age 25—with Carrie Underwood overseeing her induction. The singer was now a bona fide country star.\n\nRecent Work: Rolling Up the Welcome Mat\n\nKenny Chesney and Kelsea Ballerini have performed in concert together and collaborated on original music.\n\nOther singers began lining up to work with Ballerini, who collaborated with both Kenny Chesney and Halsey for her 2020 self-titled album Kelsea. She also released an accompanying album Ballerini, featuring alternate versions of songs from Kelsea, later that year. In 2021, Ballerini, a self-professed Jonas Brothers fan, fulfilled a personal dream by performing as an opener on the group’s Remember This Tour.\n\nIn September 2022, she released the album Subject to Change, spawning the popular single “If You Go Down (I’m Goin’ Down Too).” The song about a close-knit female friendship was inspired by the 1991 Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon movie Thelma & Louise, as well as the singer’s relationship with her own pals amid her divorce from her ex-husband, Morgan Evans. “Sometimes, you put out a single because you think it’s the most radio-friendly, and sometimes you put out a single because it’s actually reflective of where you’re at in your life. And then sometimes, both things can be true,” she told Billboard.\n\nHer breakup with Evans also served as the primary influence for her February 2023 EP Rolling Up the Welcome Mat, which became Ballerini’s sixth album to reach the Top 20 on the Top Country Albums chart. Led by the single “Blindsided,” the project was nominated for Album of the Year at the CMA Awards and ACM Awards in 2023 and earned Ballerini her fourth Grammy nomination, for Best Country Album, the following year.\n\nBallerini has stayed busy outside the studio, as well. She embarked on her multi-leg Heartfirst Tour in 2022 and sold out her first headlining major arena show in Knoxville the following year. She also joined Chesney for his I Go Back 2023 Tour.\n\nNew Album\n\nThe singer announced her new album Patterns will be released on October 25. Ballerini told the Associated Press the upcoming album offers an “accurate snapshot” of her life. “I think that people probably expect this really happy-go-lucky, love, mushy, gushy record from me. That’s not the case,” she said.\n\nHit Songs\n\nBallerini’s songs have proven immensely popular on country music charts, even as her work largely hasn’t struck a chord in the mainstream. (Her biggest hit on the Billboard Hot 100 is “Peter Pan,” which peaked at No. 35.) Peaking in June 2015, “Love Me Like You Mean It” was the first of her seven singles that have become Top 10 Hot Country Songs. Those are:\n\n“Love Me Like You Mean It”\n\n“Peter Pan”\n\n“Dibs”\n\n“Legends”\n\n“Yeah Boy”\n\n“Miss Me More”\n\n“Hole in the Bottle”\n\nAdditionally, Ballerini is credited with five No. 1 Country Airplay songs. They include “Half of My Hometown,” a 2020 collaboration with Kenny Chesney, as well as the first four tracks listed above. When “Love Me Like You Mean It” reached the top spot in July 2015, Ballerini became the first female artist since Carrie Underwood to accomplish the feat with her debut single.\n\n“The coolest thing about that is I remember when ‘Jesus, Take the Wheel’ came out, and how impactful that was not only to country music but to me,” she told the Argus Leader, referencing Underwood’s 2005 hit. “To watch her career since then… makes me just want to keep going.”\n\nTV Shows: The Voice and More\n\nKelsea Ballerini has appeared on The Voice as a fill-in mentor and will join the panel full-time starting in 2025.\n\nBallerini has appeared as a guest on numerous TV shows, including the drama series Nashville in 2016, Songland in 2019, and the children’s staple Sesame Street in 2021. She also performed her singles “Blindsided” and “Penthouse” during a March 2023 episode of Saturday Night Live.\n\nBallerini hosted the CMT Music Awards from 2021 through 2024, emceeing three times with Kane Brown and once solo. She notably used the platform to show her support for the LGBTQ community, performing with drag queens from the reality series RuPaul’s Drag Race in 2023. “I love performance, and I love self-expression, and I love inclusivity,” she told Entertainment Tonight.\n\nStarting in spring 2025, the singer will serve as a celebrity coach for the NBC reality competition The Voice alongside John Legend, Michael Bublé, and Adam Levine.\n\nBallerini is also a published author. Her book, , released in 2021.\n\nBoyfriend Chase Stokes and Ex-Husband\n\nActor Chase Stokes and Kelsea Ballerini, seen here in April 2024, began dating after the singer reached out on Instagram.\n\nBallerini is currently dating actor Chase Stokes, known for his role as John Booker Routledge, or simply John B., on the Netflix drama Outer Banks. Stokes first confirmed their relationship during a March 2023 appearance on Today.\n\nThe pair were first spotted together earlier that year in January. Ballerini revealed during an appearance on the Call Her Daddy podcast that she reached out to Stokes through an Instagram message. “I was ready to open back up [after my divorce]… I just felt, why not? I’ve never really dated; I don’t know how it works,” she said. “I’ve never seen his show, but I just knew of him, and I just swan dove right on in.”\n\nBallerini and Stokes made their red carpet debut at the CMT Music Awards in April 2023 and have attended multiple events together, most recently the 2024 Met Gala in New York City. They frequently post updates from their life on social media.\n\nPrior to connecting with Stokes, Ballerini was married to Australian singer Morgan Evans. They wed in December 2017 but announced their separation in August 2022. The couple officially divorced that November.\n\nBallerini later said their relationship fractured over their opposing views on starting a family. “He was like, ‘I don’t want to be an old dad,’ is what he kept saying. And I was like, ‘I’m not there yet, and I can’t do that to save this and give you something that I’m not ready for,’” Ballerini said.\n\nNet Worth\n\nCelebrity Net Worth estimates Ballerini’s total fortune at around $6 million.\n\nQuotes\n\nSongwriting is the most selfish part of what I do. I write songs for me.
