You may be looking for \"Ashley\", a song.\n\nAshley Nicolette Frangipane (born September 29, 1994), known professionally as Halsey, is an American singer-songwriter, record producer and make-up artist.[1] Gaining attention from self-released music on social media platforms, she was signed by Astralwerks Records in 2014 and released her debut EP, Room 93, later that year. Halsey uses she/her, they/them pronouns.[2]\n\nHalsey's debut studio album, Badlands, was certified 2x Platinum by the RIAA, along with four of its singles.[3] In 2016, they rose to stronger prominence as a featured vocalist on The Chainsmokers' single \"Closer\", which topped the charts of over fifteen countries and was later certified Diamond in the US.[4] Their second studio album, Hopeless Fountain Kingdom, consisted of more \"radio friendly\" music than their previous releases. It topped the Billboard 200 and featured two US top-20 singles: \"Now or Never\" and \"Bad at Love\". Halsey's third studio album, Manic, released in 2020 has been certified Platinum[5] in the US and its lead single, \"Without Me\", became her first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 as a lead artist.[4] Her fourth studio album, If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power, was announced on June 28, 2021.[6]\n\nHalsey has sold 22 million records in the US alone, based on certifications.[7] Their awards and nominations include four Billboard Music Awards, one GLAAD Media Award, a Guinness World Record, a MTV Video Music Award, a Kid’s Choice Award, and a Grammy Award nomination. Halsey is noted for her distinctive singing voice, and her music is usually based on her personal experiences.\n\nIn January 2021, they launched their own cosmetics brand called About-Face of which they are the CEO and head make-up artist.[1]\n\nOutside of her career, she has been involved in suicide prevention awareness, LGBTQ+ movements, sexual assault victim advocacy and is a big advocate of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nHalsey was born on September 29, 1994, and grew up in New Jersey. She is of Italian, Hungarian, and Irish descent on their mother's side and African-American on her father's side. She has two brothers, Sevian and Dante Frangipane.\n\nGrowing up, Halsey played the violin, viola, and cello until moving onto the acoustic guitar when she was 14.[8] They have revealed that as a child, they were very into comic books and superheroes. In one of her first interviews, Halsey stated she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder around the age of 17. She was hospitalized for 17 days after she attempted suicide.[9]\n\nIn 2012, she graduated from Warren Hills Regional High School in Washington, New Jersey. When she was 19 she had been accepted at the well-regarded Rhode Island School of Design however, she couldn’t afford to go. They were kicked out by their parents after quitting schools leaving them homeless. She had a lot of financial struggles and also a history with drugs after living on the streets for a while. Eventually, they’d go stay with their grandmother who had taught them to play \"Memory\" on the piano when they were four.[10]\n\nCareer (music)[]\n\n2012 – 2014: Beginning of music career and \"Ghost\"[]\n\nFrangipane started writing music when she was 17, and in 2012 she began posting videos to social media sites such as YouTube and Kik, and in particular Tumblr, under the username of se7enteenblack.[8] She gained popularity on the platform after a parody of Taylor Swift's \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" titled \"The Haylor Song\" went viral.[11][12] Moreover, they also released a song called \"SOS\" which is also about Harry Styles and Taylor Swift's former relationship. Halsey has since apologized for making the songs.[13] During this time Halsey also released a song titled \"For Ruby\", a charity single to raise money for the five-year-old Ruby Owen fighting a brain tumor. The song raised approx. $45,000 however, Ruby Owen ultimately lost the fight and died in January 2013. Halsey has also auditioned for the X-Factor but was not cast and had planned to release a song called \"Tilt You Back\" as her first single.[14] While living on the streets, Halsey got invited to a party at a Holiday Inn in Newark where they met a \"music guy\" who later\" introduced her to another \"music guy\" (presumably Anthony Li) who'd invited Halsey to his house to create a song for a commercial for a yogurt.[15] During that meeting Halsey wrote her debut single \"Ghost\".[10] On February 3, 2014 Halsey uploaded the song to her SoundCloud account[16] and by around 3 a.m the song went viral and five different record labels had contacted her.[10] The song was charting by morning and Halsey signed to Astralwerks Records, a record label owned by Universal Music Group, and distributed by Capitol Music Group, UMG and EMI.\n\n2014 – 2016: Room 93 and Badlands[]\n\nMain article: Room 93\n\nHalsey began touring with The Kooks in August 2014 and performed various original songs.

The EP charted in the lower regions of the US Billboard 200 and at number three on the Top Heatseekers chart.[8] On March 3, 2015, a \"1 Mic - 1 Take\" version of the Room 93 EP was released.

She also supported Imagine Dragons on the Smoke + Mirrors Tour during the North American leg between June and August 2015.\n\nMain article: Badlands\n\nOn August 11, 2015 Halsey suffered a miscarriage at her Vevo LIFT performance.[18][19][20] They later accredited the miscarriage to her endometriosis.[8] On March 9, 2015 her debut single \"Ghost\" was re-released once more to promote her upcoming debut album. On July 10, 2015 \"New Americana\" was officially released by Astralwerks as the album's second single. Her debut studio album, Badlands, was released on August 28, 2015. It peaked at number two on the Billboard 200, and sold 115,000 copies in its first week.[4] The album was a metaphor for her mental state at the time, stating that each song meant something different to their. Halsey wrote all of the songs on the album when she was 19, while production was handled by a number of producers, including then boyfriend, Norwegian producer Lido.[8] As of August 2020, it has sold over 2 million copies in the United States.[21] Four singles have been released from the album: \"Ghost\", \"New Americana\", \"Colors\", and \"Castle\".

She is also featured on the song \"Free Love\" which also pays tribute to the victims. On July 29, 2016, Halsey released a song with the American EDM duo The Chainsmokers titled \"Closer\".

In 2018, the song received a diamond certification by the RIAA for selling 10 million units in the United States.[23]\n\n2017 – 2018: Hopeless Fountain Kingdom[]\n\nMain article: Hopeless Fountain Kingdom\n\nIn January 2017, she released the single \"Not Afraid Anymore\" which appears on the soundtrack of the film [24]. On February 28, 2017 Halsey revealed that she had sent invites to 100 fans in London to hear four new songs off of their next record and mentioned that “we cried”.[25] During June 2015, Halsey had already hinted that they began working on her second studio album. At one of the last shows of her Badlands Tour a short video was shown which ended with the quote “You can find me in the kingdom,” which fans suspected was a hint about the singer’s upcoming music. Following the show Halsey also tweeted the same quote.[26] On March 7, 2017, she announced the title of her next album, Hopeless Fountain Kingdom.[27] The album was released on June 2, 2017.

Although over a year later on June 21, 2023, Halsey performed a series of string ensemble shows in Newark, Hollywood, Gary and Sacramento, which could be considered as part of the Love and Power Tour.[62][63]\n\n2022 – present: H5[]\n\nMain article: H5\n\nIn January 2022, Halsey wrote and produced a song, titled \"So Good\". When the song was withheld from release due to Capitol Records needing to test the song's \"virality\", while on tour, Halsey posted a TikTok video criticizing Capitol Records on May 22, 2022, for not being allowed to release \"So Good\" without an \"accompanying campaign or TikTok video to make it go viral.\" Five days prior, without the approval of Capitol, Halsey played a snippet of her song in a TikTok video. In the days following her post, questions arose regarding whether or not Capitol was going to take legal action against her. Music industry attorney Erin M. Jacobson mentioned in an article by TIME that \"it is rare that a label would sue one of its own artists, especially when the label plans to continue working with that artist. Further, using such a short piece of the record could also be seen as a promotional use.\"[64] Capitol Records eventually conceded on May 31, 2022, amid criticism and scrutiny from a variety of music artists, and set a release date for the song of June 9, 2022. Although some believed that the release controversy was a marketing stunt, Halsey maintained that it was not fake.[65] In 2023, Halsey left Captiol Records and signed with Columbia Records, after the news, Halsey took to Tumblr to post that they were hard at work on music, \"There were some restrictions I was under, for a lot longer than it seemed, but they are no longer in the way. I’m sure you can fill in the blanks. I’m always writing aimlessly and lawlessly as you know. But “album mode” is a whole other arena and the games are just beginning.\"[66] In July 2023, Halsey stated that \"As of right now I’m approaching it kinda how I approached manic. No strict genre parameters or anything.
