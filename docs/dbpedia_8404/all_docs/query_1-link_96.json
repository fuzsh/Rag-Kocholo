        "text": "Wayne F. Halsey, age 81, of North Fond du Lac, died Wednesday, April 17, 2024, at St. Agnes Hospital surrounded by his children and family. He suffered with Parkinson's disease for more than 10 years. He was born on January 1, 1943, in Brandon, WI, the son of Lester and Adelaide (Sauer) Halsey. Wayne graduated from Brandon High School in 1961. On January 27, 1962, he married Barbara Manthie in Ripon, WI. Wayne worked as an engineer on the Soo Line Railroad for many years until retiring on January 1, 2004.\n\nSurvivors include his wife Barbara of Fond du Lac, his brother Loren Halsey of Appleton, son Wayne Halsey Jr. of Bellevue, NE, daughter Debbie (Mark) Remich of Hubertus, WI and daughter Jill Tofel of Saukville, WI.\n\nHe was a proud Goompa to five grandchildren: Jessica, Kyle, David, Mellissa, and Dylan.\n\nIn addition to being a loving, generous, and kind person, Wayne was an avid Chicago Cubs fan, Green Bay Packers fan, and Wisconsin Badgers fan. He was very proud that all of those teams rose to success during his lifetime.\n\nHe enjoyed coin collecting and his passion was restoring antique gasoline engines.\n\nWe will all miss his quiet, gentle soul and the many inside jokes we shared as a family.\n\nA celebration of Wayne's life will be held on Saturday, June 29, 2024, from 2-5 pm at Uecker-Witt Funeral Home.\n\nServices are in the care of Uecker-Witt Funeral Home, 524 North Park Avenue, Fond du Lac, WI, 54935.
