        "text": "British conductor Adam Hickox (born in 1996) has been described by the Boston Musical Intelligencer as a “consummate, well-mannered musician of skill”. He brings to the podium an impressive and elegant fluidity of technique and mature interpretations of a wide range of repertoire which is fast building him a reputation both on the concert stage and in the opera house. In December 2023, following his successful debut at Glyndebourne Autumn Opera conducting Donizetti L’Elisir d’amore, he was appointed Principal Conductor of The Glyndebourne Sinfonia which will see him returning to Glyndebourne to conduct opera productions and concert performances as part of the autumn seasons 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe 23/24 includes many debuts for Hickox – these include the Philharmonia Orchestra at London’s South Bank Centre, the Deutsche Symphony Orchestra Berlin at the Berlin Philharmonie, the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, Norwegian Opera, BBC Philharmonic, Iceland Symphony, St Gallen Symphony orchestras amongst others and returns to the Royal Philharmonic, Rotterdam Philharmonic and BBC Symphony orchestras, all of whom he is now conducting regularly.\n\nIn recent seasons, Hickox has conducted the Orchestre de Paris, BBC Scottish Symphony, BBC Symphony in the studio and at the Barbican Centre in a concert celebrating the works of the legendary author Ian McEwan, the Ulster Orchestra, Orquesta Sinfónica de Castilla y León, Gävle Symphony and the National Symphony Orchestra (Ireland). In the opera house, he has conducted Tosca at Opera North, a new production of Hansel and Gretel at the Royal Scottish Conservatoire and in the coming seasons will make his debut at Hamburg State Opera.\n\nHickox studied music and composition with Robin Holloway at Gonville and Caius College Cambridge, and conducting with Sian Edwards at the Royal Academy of Music. He was Assistant Conductor of the Rotterdam Philharmonic from 2019-2022 working closely with Lahav Shani, and in 2021 he was invited to Tanglewood as one of the Festival's two Conducting Fellows, where he worked alongside Nelsons, Blomstedt and Gilbert with the TMC Orchestra, as well as giving performances of his own at the Koussevitzky Music Shed. Hickox also took part in the fellowship's corresponding residency with the Gewandhausorchester Leipzig.\n\n2023/24 season, 353 words. Not to be altered without permission."
