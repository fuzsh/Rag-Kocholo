        "text": "Just as May gave way to June, Halsey posted an unflinching video depicting their illnesses, and released a poignant song about themselves: \"The End.\"\n\nBut the end of what, exactly? The end of making music, which Halsey dragged themselves from poverty to doggedly pursue? God forbid, the end of a life? No, they're referring to something even more bracing: the end of all things.\n\n\"If you knew it was the end of the world / Could you love me like a child? / Could you hold me in the dark,\" Halsey sings in the chorus of the aching ballad. \"If you knew it was the end of the world / Would you like to stay a while? Would you leave when it gets hard?\"\n\nListening to the brutally honest, detail-stuffed \"The End,\" you practically squint under fluorescent hospital lights: it's one of the most personal, and risk-taking, singles Halsey has ever penned. And there are a lot more where that came from. Along with the song, Halsey also announced they've recorded a new album, the title of which they haven't disclosed just yet.\n\n\"Let's try something different this time and start at 'The End,'\" the three-time GRAMMY nominee wrote on Instagram, before sharing a carousel of photos and videos detailing their brutal health journey. Here's everything GRAMMY.com could find about their forthcoming fifth album.\n\nFirst Things First: They're On A New Label\n\nIf you need a refresher, Halsey had a very public break with their previous label, Capitol Records, whom they were with for eight years. The snafu was over their single, \"So Good,\" which Halsey claimed was on ice until \"they can fake a viral moment on TikTok.\"\n\nA year later, Halsey left Capitol, and soon inked a deal with Columbia Records. Their fifth album will be their debut with Columbia.\n\nThey're Eyeing A \"Rebirth\" — And A Path To Wellness\n\nWithin said Instagram carousel, Halsey reveals the state of their physical vessel — and their burning desire to get right with their body.\n\n\"I'm giving myself two more years to be sick,\" the 29-year-old says, rubbing their legs to soothe the pain. \"At 30, I'm having a rebirth, and I'm not gonna be sick, and I'm gonna look super hot and have so much energy, and just get to re-do my twenties in my thirties.\"\n\n\"Long story short, I'm Lucky to be alive,\" they wrote in the caption. \"Short story long, i wrote an album.\" As such, expect the new album to tackle all of the above, and unfold it into unexpected shapes and dimensions.\n\nThey've Unveiled A New Website\n\nAlong with all this, Halsey has revealed a mysterious website, ForMyLastTrick.com. Peruse its array of digital badges; they undoubtedly, cryptically tie into their new album, from a cigarette butt (they quit a few years ago) to a cartoon X-ray machine to a Casper-like ghost clutching a sign: \"You won't find me here.\" Whatever the intent behind that statement, you'll find a lot of Halsey in this collection of symbols.\n\nIt's Going To Be Emotional\n\nLast fall, Halsey hinted that their fifth album would be a highly personal, internal affair. \"Not pictured: me splitting myself in two everyday so that I can give you my deepest wounds (and a handful of perfect joys) for the 5th time in 10 years,\" they wrote on Instagram.\n\nThankfully, Halsey's in one piece — and seemingly on the creative roll of their lifetime. As the \"chaos and confetti of big singles and album releases\" continues, keep checking this piece for up-to-date information on Halsey's latest offering.\n\n15 Must-Hear Albums In June 2024: Charli XCX, Kehlani, Peso Pluma, Normani & More\n\nJuly has graced us with a diverse array of new music from all genres, lighting up dance floors and speakers everywhere.\n\nThe last weekend of the month brings exciting new collaborations, including another iconic track from Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding, as well as a fierce team-up from Paris Hilton and Meghan Trainor. Halsey and Muni Long offered a taste of their forthcoming projects, while Jordan Davis and Miranda Lambert each delivered fun new country tunes.\n\nIn addition to fresh collabs and singles, there's a treasure trove of new albums to uncover. Highlights include Ice Spice's Y2K!, Rakim's G.O.D., Sam Tompkins' hi, my name is insecure, Wild Rivers' Never Better, Tigirlily Gold's Blonde, and kenzie's biting my tongue.\n\nAs you check out all the new music that dropped today, be sure you don't miss these 10 tracks and albums.\n\nmgk & Jelly Roll — \"Lonely Road\"\n\nAlthough fans anticipated Machine Gun Kelly's next release to mark his return to hip-hop, no one seems to be complaining about \"KellyRoll.\" Embracing the trend of venturing into the country genre, mgk teams up with fellow GRAMMY-nominated artist Jelly Roll on their newest track, \"Lonely Road.\"\n\nThe genre-blending track interpolates John Denver's classic \"Take Me Home, Country Roads.\" However, unlike Denver's sentimental ode to the simplicity of rural life, mgk and Jelly Roll reinterpret the track through the lens of romantic relationships that have come to a, well, lonely end.\n\nAs mgk revealed in an Instagram post, \"Lonely Road\" was a labor of love for both him and Jelly Roll. \"We worked on 'Lonely Road' for 2 years, 8 different studios, 4 different countries, changed the key 4 times,\" he wrote. \"We finally got it right.\"\n\nHalsey — \"Lucky\"\n\nIn another interpolation special, Halsey samples not one but two classics in their latest single, \"Lucky.\" The song's production features elements of Monica's 1999 hit \"Angel of Mine,\" while the chorus flips Britney Spears' fan-favorite \"Lucky\" into a first-person narrative.\n\nWhile Halsey has always been a transparent star, their next project is seemingly going to be even more honest than their previous releases. After first revealing their journey with lupus with the super-personal \"The End\" in June, \"Lucky\" further details their struggles: \"And I told everybody I was fine for a whole damn year/ And that's the biggest lie of my career.\"\n\nThough they haven't revealed a release date for their next project, Halsey referred to her next era as a \"monumental moment in my life\" in an Instagram post about the \"Lucky\" music video — hinting that it may just be their most powerful project yet.\n\nRead More: Everything We Know About Halsey's New Album\n\nParis Hilton & Meghan Trainor — \"Chasin'\"\n\nAhead of Paris Hilton's forthcoming album, Infinite Icon — her first in nearly 20 years — the multihyphenate unveiled another female-powered collaboration, this time with Meghan Trainor. Co-produced by Sia, \"Chasin'\" is a lively pop anthem about discovering self-worth in romantic relationships and finding the strength to walk away from toxicity.\n\n\"She is the sister I always needed and when she calls me sis, I die of happiness inside,\" Trainor told Rolling Stone about her relationship with Hilton. Coincidentally, Trainor first wrote the track with her brother, Ryan, but the pop star was waiting for the right collaborator to hop on the track — and Hilton was just that.\n\n\"We made something truly iconic together,\" Trainor added. \"It was a bucket list dream come true for me.\"\n\nEmpire Of The Sun — 'Ask That God'\n\nA highly awaited return to music after eight years, Australian electro-pop duo Empire Of The Sun are back with their fourth studio album, Ask That God.\n\n\"This body of work represents the greatest shift in consciousness our world has ever seen and that's reflected in the music,\" says member Lord Littlemore in a press statement.\n\nLike their previous work that transports listeners to a different universe, this album continues that tradition with trancey tracks like lead single \"Changes\" and the thumping title track. Ask That God offers a chance to reflect on the blend of reality and imagination, while also evoking the radiant energy of their past songs.\n\nCalvin Harris & Ellie Goulding — \"Free\"\n\nDance music's collaborative powerhouse, Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding, are back with another summer hit. Their latest track, \"Free,\" marks the fourth collaboration between the duo — and like their past trilogy of hits, the two have another banger on their hands.\n\nThe track debuted earlier this month at Harris' show in Ibiza, where Goulding made a surprise appearance to perform \"Free\" live. With Harris delivering an infectious uptempo house beat and Goulding's silky vocals elevating the track, \"Free\" proves that the pair still have plenty of musical chemistry left.\n\nPost Malone & Luke Combs — \"Guy For That\"\n\nPost Malone's transition into country music has been anything but slow; in fact, the artist went full-throttle into the genre. The New York-born, Texas-raised star embraced his new country era with collaborations alongside some of the genre's biggest superstars, like Morgan Wallen and Blake Shelton. Continuing this momentum as he gets closer to releasing F-1 Trillion, Post Malone teams up with Luke Combs for the new track \"Guy For That.\"\n\nThe catchy collaboration tells the story of a relationship that has faded, where the protagonist knows someone who can fix almost anything, except for a broken heart. It's an upbeat breakup song that, like Post's previous F-1 Trillion releases, can get any party going — especially one in Nashville, as Malone and Combs did in the track's music video.\n\nForrest Frank & Tori Kelly — \"Miracle Worker\"\n\nJust one month after Surfaces released their latest album, good morning, the duo's Forrest Frank unveiled his own project, CHILD OF GOD — his debut full-length Christian album. Among several features on the LP, one of the standouts is with GRAMMY-winning artist Tori Kelly on the track \"Miracle Worker.\"\n\nOver a plucky electric guitar and lo-fi beats, Frank and Kelly trade verses before joining for the second chorus. Their impassioned vocals elevate the song's hopeful prayer, \"Miracle Worker make me new.\"\n\nTheir collaboration arrives just before both artists hit the road for their respective tours. Frank kicks his U.S. trek off in Charlotte, North Carolina on July 31, and Kelly starts her world tour in Taipei, Taiwan on Aug. 17.\n\nXG — \"SOMETHING AIN'T RIGHT\"\n\nSince their debut in 2022 with \"Tippy Toes,\" Japanese girl group XG has been making waves and showing no signs of slowing down. With their first mini album released in 2023 and now their latest single, \"SOMETHING AIN'T RIGHT,\" the group continues to rise with their distinctive visuals and infectious hits.\n\nThe track features a nostalgic rhythm reminiscent of early 90s R&B, showcasing the unique personalities of each member. As an uptempo dance track, it's designed to resonate with listeners from all across the globe.\n\n\"SOMETHING AIN'T RIGHT\" also serves as the lead single for XG's upcoming second mini album, set to release later this year.\n\nMustard — 'Faith of a Mustard Seed'\n\nFor nearly 15 years, Mustard has been a go-to producer for some of rap's biggest names, from Gucci Mane to Travis Scott. On the heels of earning his first Billboard Hot 100 chart-topper as a producer with Kendrick Lamar's \"Not Like Us,\" he's back with his own collaboration-filled project.\n\nFaith of a Mustard Seed features a robust 14-song track list with contributions from Vince Staples, Lil Yachty, Charlie Wilson, and more. The LP marks Mustard's fourth studio album, and first since 2019's Perfect Ten.\n\nIn an interview with Billboard, Mustard shared that the album's title is an ode to late rapper Nipsey Hussle, who suggested the title during one of their final conversations before his untimely death in 2019. And once \"Not Like Us\" hit No. 1, Mustard knew it was time to release the long-in-the-making album.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nSince the 2021 release of SOUR, critics and listeners alike have touted Olivia Rodrigo for her knack to eloquently pen the relatable woes of adolescence and the pitfalls of falling in love too hard. Her latest single, \"vampire,\" is no different.\n\nDespite trading in her \"drivers license\" teenage loverboy for an older man, the perfectly executed expression of agony remains. As Rodrigo wails on the chorus, \"You made me look so naïve/ The way you sold me for parts/ As you suck your teeth into me/ Bloodsucker, famef—er/ Bleeding me dry like a g——n vampire.\"\n\nBut before there was Rodrigo, there was Avril Lavigne, Taylor Swift, and Alanis Morissette — none of which would be where they were without pioneers of diaristic songwriting, Carole King and Carly Simon. Thanks to the immortalization of their music, we can relive the shift from poetic disclosures of hurt, which King exemplifies on \"It's Too Late,\" to more unrepentant, straightforward jabs (like Kate Nash says on \"Foundations,\" \"Don't want to look at your face 'cause it's making me sick\") and harrowing battle cries (as Miley Cyrus roars, \"I came in like a wrecking ball\").\n\nBelow, revisit 15 songs by empowered women, from 1971 all the way to 2021, who reclaimed the breakup narrative with their fervent sentences of damnation — because, as the age-old saying goes, hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.\n\nCarole King — \"It's Too Late\" (1971)\n\nWhen Carole King released \"It's Too Late\" in 1971, it marked a new era of songwriting. Discussions about divorce were generally unheard of, but even more so when initiated by a woman. Yet, King carried on to unapologetically release \"It's Too Late,\" which later won a GRAMMY for Record of the Year and is lauded by Rolling Stone as one of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nOn this folky track, King and her husband's inevitable parting is on the horizon, but she isn't resentful per se. Instead, she's more troubled by the embarrassment of her husband's growing discontent, admitting, \"I feel like a fool.\" And at this point, she's ready to move on and can be grateful for the times they've shared.\n\nCarly Simon — \"You're So Vain\" (1972)\n\nIn her '70s chart-topper, Carly Simon narrates the tale of an arrogant man who believes every woman is enchanted by his aura. But the folk songstress wants to make it very clear she's not impressed by his embellished stories or luxurious closet.\n\nUsually, it's easy to guess the subject of a breakup song, but \"You're So Vain\" has led to decades of speculation. Many have assumed it could be about James Taylor, who Simon married in 1972 and divorced in 1983, or Mick Jagger, who provided vocals to the track (a theory that was later debunked). To this day, she has only revealed the track's inspiration to a select few, including Taylor Swift, who names Simon as one of her role models.\n\nJoan Jett And The Blackhearts — \"I Hate Myself For Loving You\" (1986)\n\nJoan Jett might not give a damn about her bad reputation, but she despises nothing more than her ex-lover making her look like a lovesick fool.\n\nOn \"I Hate Myself for Loving You,\" the '80s chanteuse wraps herself around a classic glam rock beat, unveiling her contempt for a man who's neglected her. Stripped of her pride, Jett begins to resent herself for holding onto her feelings — as evidenced by the song's title.\n\nShe tries to hide her dwelling desires (\"I want to walk, but I run back to you\") but ultimately fails to rid herself of the emotions, leaving her to fantasize about the sweet justice of one day roping him back in, just to leave him.\n\nAlanis Morissette — \"You Oughta Know\" (1995)\n\nIt's impossible to talk about scathing breakup songs without acknowledging Alanis Morissette's quintessential heartbreak anthem, \"You Oughta Know.\" At the time of its release, the Jagged Little Pill single contained some of the most honest and vitriolic lyrics in existence.\n\nMorissette begins with an illusive statement, \"I want you to know that I'm happy for you,\" which, by the second verse, crumbles into a revelation, \"I'm not quite as well, you should know.\" As she culminates into her most confessional, the instrumental rises into an addicting ruckus, with Morissette revealing the thoughts most of us would be too ashamed to admit: \"It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced/ And are you thinkin' of me when you f— her?\"\n\nShania Twain — \"That Don't Impress Me Much\" (1997)\n\nShania Twain has a particular superpower of delivering each of her lyrics with an air of lightheartedness and confidence. So, when you hear a track like \"That Don't Impress Me Much,\" her disappointment and irritation becomes undetectable.\n\nA quick examination of Twain's story proves — despite the song's bouncy melodies — she's jaded by her ex's preoccupation with his vehicle, appearance and intelligence. Sure, he might be perfect on paper, but he lacks the qualities of a forever lover, and his unmerited ego should be reserved for true big shots like Elvis Presley and Brad Pitt.\n\nMichelle Branch — \"Are You Happy Now?\" (2003)\n\nIn the opening verse of \"Are You Happy Now?,\" Michelle Branch pleads, \"No, don't just walk away/ Pretending everything's okay, and you don't care about me.\" At first, she is in disbelief that her once admirer would swiftly brush her off, but as she reaches the chorus, she begins to question whether his actions were a lie all along.\n\nHer mind racing, Branch teeters between shameless questions of \"Do you really have everything you want?\" and \"Could you look me in the eye and tell me you're happy now?\" But by the song's end, she gets the most satisfying payback of all — peace without him: \"I'm not about to break/ 'Cause I'm happy now.\"\n\nAvril Lavigne — \"My Happy Ending\" (2004)\n\n\"My Happy Ending\" finds 2000s pop-punk maven Avril Lavigne grasping onto the shards of a broken relationship and trying to pinpoint where everything went wrong. She could have said the \"wrong\" thing, or her partner's misfit friends might have spoken negatively about her. But there is one thing she does know with certainty: there is no way to pick up the pieces.\n\nComing to terms with the truth, Lavigne repositions her anger toward the other person for stripping her of her fairytale ending, sarcastically acknowledging him for their time spent together over a somber piano: \"It's nice to know you were there/ Thanks for acting like you care/ And making me feel like I was the only one.\"\n\nKelly Clarkson — \"Gone\" (2004)\n\nKelly Clarkson has traversed almost every emotion in love, from her epic breakup anthems like \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\" to her most recent LP chemistry. But \"Gone\" may just be her most unrelenting to date.\n\nIntroduced by its Breakaway counterpart \"Since U Been Gone,\" the mononymous \"Gone\" extends Clarkson's journey of healing — this time, with a more explicit and mature diatribe against her ex's character. Rather than using trivial attacks, Clarkson instead chooses to call out his assumption she'd run back into his arms, later declaring an end to her toleration: \"There is nothing you can say/ Sorry doesn't cut it, babe/ Take the hit and walk away, 'cause I'm gone.\"\n\nLily Allen — \"Smile\" (2006)\n\nWith \"Smile,\" Lily Allen gets her sweet revenge through the sight of her former flame's tears and misfortune. But the lyrics of Allen's breakthrough single doesn't exactly clarify the specifications of her antics, only an explanation for its origins.\n\nAfter a cheating scandal ends her relationship, her mental health plummets — until he comes crawling back for her mercy. Upon hearing his pleas, she comes to a realization: \"When I see you cry, it makes me smile.\" And as the conniving music video shows, anyone who cheats on her will get their karma — perhaps in the form of organized burglary, beatings, and a laxative slipped into their morning coffee.\n\nKate Nash — \"Foundations\" (2007)\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of her mentor Lily Allen, Kate Nash vividly paints the tragedy of falling out of love, made prismatic by her plain-spoken lyrics (\"Your face is pasty 'cause you've gone and got so wasted, what a surprise!\") and her charming, thick London accent.\n\nIn this story, Nash has not quite removed herself from the shackles of her failing relationship. In fact, she'd like to salvage it, despite her boyfriend's tendency to humiliate her and her irresistible urge to sneer back with a sarcastic comment. By the end of the track, Nash, becoming more restless, packs on new ways to inconvenience him — but in the end, still wonders if there's any saving grace to preserve their once blazing spark out of a fear of loneliness.\n\nP!nk — \"So What\" (2008)\n\nThe year P!nk wrote \"So What,\" she already had a bevy of platinum singles under her belt. With a gleaming social status and peaking career, she was apathetic to the temporary separation from her now husband, Carey Hart. Feeling the highs of newfound singlehood, P!nk was ready to incite personal tyranny, whether that meant not paying Hart's rent, drinking her money, or starting a fight.\n\nIronically, Hart appears as the antagonist in the music video, which P!nk revealed via her official fan website was a testament of their growth: \"Carey hadn't heard the song before he did the video. That's how much he trusts and loves me [...] He gets it. He gets me,\" she said.\n\nTaylor Swift — \"Picture To Burn\" (2006)\n\nTaylor Swift has long solidified herself as the reigning queen of love songs, from ballads honoring the most committed relationships to diss tracks of heartbreaking adolescent flings. The latter houses one of the earliest (and most twangy) hits in Swift's sweeping catalog: \"Picture to Burn.\"\n\nIn this deceivingly upbeat tune, Swift vows to seek vengeance on a boyfriend after he leaves her to date one of her friends — from getting with his friends to having her father give him a piece of his mind. And along the way, she will gladly dish out a few insults: \"You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying/ So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time/ As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn.\"\n\nMiley Cyrus — \"Wrecking Ball\" (2013)\n\nClosing the door on her Hannah Montana days, Miley Cyrus' \"Wrecking Ball\" saw the childhood pop star in her most grown-up and vulnerable state to date. Months before the release, Cyrus had called off her engagement to her longtime boyfriend, Liam Hemsworth, paving the way for her thunderous performance on the Bangerz single.\n\nJust as affecting as Cyrus' belting vocals is the track's iconic music video. Cyrus climaxes with a deafening cry — \"All you did was wreck me\" — as she swings across the screen on an actual wrecking ball, breaking down all her physical and metaphorical walls.\n\nHalsey — \"You should be sad\" (2020)\n\nBy the mid-2010s, the industry had put angst on the back burner in exchange for feel-good EDM and trap beats. Well, that is, at least, until Halsey entered the picture.\n\nAfter just two years in the limelight, Halsey had cultivated a vibrant assortment of sonic melodrama — from the dirt and grime of toxic, failed love on tracks \"Bad at Love\" and \"Colors\" to the Bonnie and Clyde-esque heated passion of \"Him & I.\"\n\nIn 2020, Halsey rounded out her discography with the genre-bending, introspective Manic, where a track like \"You should be sad\" commands your attention with matter-of-fact, vindictive comments: \"I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you/ 'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you.\"\n\nGAYLE — \"abcdefu\" (2021)\n\nUnlike most love songs, GAYLE refuses to point her fury on \"abcdefu\" solely toward her heartbreaker. The then-16-year-old singer, instead, rages against his mother, sister and pretty much anyone (and anything) he's associated with — other than his dog — across a searing melody with a bewitching bassline.\n\nEarlier this year, GAYLE revealed to GRAMMY.com that she was \"angry at him and was angry at the people who enabled him and his behavior.\" That animosity was palpable in \"abcdefu,\" creating a magic as empowering as it is cathartic — and, like many songs that came before it, proving that there can be power in pain.\n\nBehind The Scenes Of The Eras Tour: Taylor Swift's Opening Acts Unveil The Magic Of The Sensational Concert\n\nOlivia Rodrigo probably never imagined that a drive through the suburbs would become a rallying cry for anyone who's ever mourned a relationship. But when she released her debut single, the racing power ballad \"drivers license,\" in January 2021, suddenly she had the biggest song in the world.\n\n\"drivers license\" broke streaming and chart records upon its release, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and inspiring memes across social media. While it wasn't exactly uplifting — Rodrigo vividly details the devastation of trying to move on from an ex, and laments the milestones they were supposed to celebrate together — the song became universally celebrated, sending listeners into a nostalgic haze of first heartbreaks. Everyone was screaming, crying and dancing at the same time.\n\n\"drivers license,\" one could say, is the latest centerpiece of \"sad girl\" pop — the specific aesthetic of artists who write songs through a dreamy, yet raw lens of rage, pining, heartbreak or rejection. The music itself creates a spectrum of emotions where you might want to sway at one point, but scream like Zach Braff and Natalie Portman at the rock quarry in Garden State at another.\n\nThough Rodrigo is one of the stars at the center of \"sad girl\" pop, it had been percolating long before the explosion of \"drivers license.\" After all, artists like Fiona Apple and Alanis Morrisette were the poster girls for it in the mid-to-late '90s. But one could argue that this iteration of \"sad girl\" pop found its roots in the 2010s, thanks to artists like Lana Del Rey, whose palpable aching and loneliness became inescapable anthems like \"Video Games\" and \"Summertime Sadness\"; Taylor Swift, whose first crossover success Red spawned the still-heart-wrenching fan favorite \"All Too Well\"; Robyn, who created the ultimate crying-at-the-club banger \"Dancing on My Own\"; and MARINA, care of the depressed-Barbie era of her album Electra Heart.\n\nEven with all of its origins, \"sad girl\" pop didn't truly begin to form its own sort of subgenre until Billie Eilish and her whispery, gloomy music emerged in 2016. Others have steadily begun following suit: Sasha Alex Sloan emerged with a debut EP aptly titled Sad Girl two years later; Gracie Abrams' intimate, diaristic tracks served as major inspiration for Rodrigo (who later recruited Abrams as a tour opener); Tate McRae has turned her insecurities into aspirational, sad-pop anthems like \"she's all i wanna be.\"\n\nWhile \"sad girl\" pop isn't exactly new (most music trends are cyclical, of course), the way that people are clinging to it is. \"There's a cliche about pop that it represents a retreat from reality, an escapist fantasy world where listeners get to leave their fears and anxieties in a vision of Katy Perry's 'Teenage Dream' or fun.'s 'We Are Young,'\" says Nate Sloan, host of Switched on Pop and assistant professor of musicology at USC Thornton School of Music. \"But modern listeners — especially young people — are pushing back against that paradigm, celebrating artists like Billie Eilish, Halsey, and girl in red, who don't shy away from the troubles of the world but sublimate them into their music.\"\n\nTheir music, in turn, helps them cope with their own \"lived realities.\" It's equal parts celebration of the artist and found community for someone who, in a world away, relates.\n\nWhich is why the rise of \"sad girl\" pop feels synonymous with the current state of the world. To varying degrees, we've all endured the trauma of a pandemic that hasn't ended, particularly the mental and emotional toll of isolation and anxiety that has transpired. There's also been the weight of police brutality, school shootings and the impending death of democracy for people to bear. Finding comfort in nostalgia — especially within pop culture — was natural for many.\n\nSome retreated to the music, TV or films they listened to when they were teenagers, while others sought relief in music that evoked the feeling of being young and carefree. It's also why recent vulnerable, melancholy pop tracks became such a balm — and ultimately solidified the power of \"sad girl\" pop.\n\nBut the group that seems to be drawn to this niche pop aesthetic are teenagers. It makes sense: Gen Z is coming of age at a time when there's less of a stigma around discussing mental health. Celebrities and artists are arguably more open than ever about their struggles — Shawn Mendes, for instance, has often shared his battle with anxiety, sharing a super honest message with fans in April; Selena Gomez opened up about her bipolar diagnosis in 2020, and launched a multimedia company dedicated to mental health this year.\n\nAnd it isn't just young women dominating this niche area of pop. Male artists like Conan Gray, Dean Lewis, Jeremy Zucker and Lewis Capaldi are delivering bedroom pop anthems ranging from angsty to wistful, overall unafraid to showcase raw vulnerability. Their music has proven to similarly resonate, with Capaldi's pained breakup ballad \"Someone You Loved\" hitting No. 1 on the Hot 100 in 2019 and Dean Lewis' \"Be Alright\" reaching No. 1 on Billboard's Adult Pop Songs chart that same year.\n\nRead More: How James Bay Found The Courage To Be Vulnerable For New Album 'Leap'\n\n\"Shame is gradually being removed, so people are talking more about their feelings and their mental health — and audiences can relate to it,\" says Jodi Milstein, MA, LMFT, LPCC, music therapist.\n\nWhen their emotions are reflected back to them in a song by a public figure, sometimes that's the key to getting help and seeking therapy. \"A lot of times, we can't tell people, 'you need to do this, this and this to feel better.' We just have to set an example,\" Milstein explains.\n\nGen Z is much less filtered than other generations, and more candid about their own mental health struggles, as a 2018 survey by the American Psychological Association and a 2019 report by the American Psychiatric Association showed. And it's not uncommon to see them pouring their hearts out on TikTok or Instagram. But their connection to hyper-vulnerable music is also the result of where they are in their lives. Because their brains are still developing, they \"tend to have a more difficult time modulating their emotions,\" says Sloan.\n\n\"At the same time, they feel things more deeply than adults might, especially music,\" he continues. \"Studies have shown that the developing brain creates strong neural pathways between music and emotion in the teenage years, so that the music we listen to at that phase of our lives tends to stay with us, no matter how far we get from that period.\".\n\nDespite the lyrics — or even the mood — of the artist, \"sad girl\" pop is no different than other subgenres of music. \"What's true of 'sad girl' pop is true of all music: it's essential to try and hear a piece of music as expression, not fact,\" Sloan adds.\n\nIn other words, girl in red may be singing about depression in \"Seratonin,\" but it doesn't mean that the listeners themselves are depressed. They could be, but they could also find catharsis or joy in hearing someone detail a similar experience. And at a young age, especially, there's so much power in being seen and heard by a song.\n\n\"Several studies have shown that when listeners listen to sad music, they can experience [it] as if it was kind of empathizing with them,\" says Jonna Vuoskoski, associate professor in music cognition at the University of Oslo. \"Music is almost like a virtual friend.\"\n\nBut while the music is resonating, there is a flipside to \"sad girl\" pop. The label, which has helmed the conversation around this music, can be diminishing to the artists who are pouring their feelings into these songs. Despite all of the aforementioned artists whose vulnerability has helped their listeners heal, filing music under \"sad girl\" writes off a person's — particularly a woman's — emotional trauma as something not to be taken seriously.\n\nIt can also glorify the idea that it's \"cool\" to be sad, which is rarely the intention of these artists. When it comes down to it, their songs are about as personal and vulnerable as one could get. They're creating deeply moving material — and an importantly deep connection with those who listen.\n\n\"They're speaking up for themselves — they're setting limits or setting boundaries,\" says Milstein. \"On Instagram and Tik Tok, people get on there and will say, 'Hey, this happened to me, and I'm not gonna deal with this anymore.' People have been more expressive. You see other people actually talking about [this] stuff, which before you didn't see that.\"\n\nFrom Abrams to Rodrigo, these artists aren't singing about their insecurities and pain for cachet: They're simply young women (and men) trying to navigate young adulthood. What they're sharing is courageous — and should they decide to move out of the \"sad girl\" box they've been placed in, we should be ready to grow with them.\n\nHow Tate McRae Turned A \"Full Identity Crisis\" Into Her Debut Album, 'I Used To Think I Could Fly'"
