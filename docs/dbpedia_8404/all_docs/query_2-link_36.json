        "text": "On May 19, 2020, CNN reported:\n\n\"Ravi Zacharias, who spent his life defending Christianity through books and lectures, has died. He was 74.\n\n\"Zacharias died at his home in Atlanta on Tuesday, Ravi Zacharias International Ministries (RZIM) said, 'He was a leading figure among Christian Apologists'\"– a branch of Christian theology that defends Christian doctrines against objections.\n\n\"Zacharias founded Ravi Zacharias International Ministries in 1984, and 'launched a global team of nearly 100 Christian scholars and authors who continue to speak, resource, train and address the questions of millions around the world,' a news release said.\"\n\n“(Ravi) saw the objections and questions of others not as something to be rebuffed, but as a cry of the heart that had to be answered,” said Michael Ramsden, president of Ravi Zacharias International Ministries.\"\n\nShortly after his death, allegations of instances of the apologist's moral failures began to surface. RZIM, which was carrying on his worldwide ministry, became concerned as more details of impropriety continued. The organization hired the law firm of Miller and Martin to investigate the complaints.\n\nThe report of the firm destroyed the ministry which issued the following statement: \"We are devastated by what the investigation has shown and are filled with sorrow . . .\" The statement also said that the ministry would call for \"organizational repentance.\"\n\nOn March 10, 2021, \"Christianity Today\" quoted Zacharias' daughter:\n\n“RZIM cannot and should not continue to operate as an organization in its present form. Nor do we believe we can only rename the organization and move forward with ‘business as usual,” said Davis, who has led the ministry since his death.\n\n\"RZIM’s speakers have had invitations rescinded since allegations against Zacharias were reported in September. Over the past several months, donations slowed to the $35 million–$40 million ministry as it investigated and ultimately confirmed abuse by its late founder.\n\n\"The investigation found 'guilt beyond anything that we could have imagined,' Davis acknowledged on Wednesday.\"\n\nThe multi-layered scandal then ignited a dilemma for Calvinists to whom people looked to answer the question, \"Where is Ravi Zacharias?\" In one video posted on YouTube, leading Calvinists met to discuss the matter. What was causing the question and the meeting was a single letter in the alphabet, \"P,\" as used in the Calvinist anacronym, TULIP, the Perseverance of the Saints.\n\nCalvinist Robert Rothwell summarizes the \"P:\"\n\n\"All those who have truly believed in Him will not finally fall away from faith. True believers in Christ might seem to abandon Him for a time, but if they have truly believed in Him, they will always come back to Him. Those who profess faith but then fall away finally, never actually believed in Christ in the first place.\"\n\nThere are several problems with the above definition: How long is \"for a time?\" How is \"truly/actually believed\" defined? The Bible never uses the term, \"truly/actually believe,\" a person either believes or he does not believe. And what about the fact that we have the record of the outrageous and scandalous final years of the life of Solomon, the author of Proverbs, Song of Solomon, and Ecclesiastes?\n\nThe summary of the end of the king's life is one of an apostate: \"He had seven hundred wives (!), princesses (!), and three hundred concubines (!), and his wives turned his heart away. For when Solomon was old, his wives turned his heart away after other gods; and his heart was not wholly devoted to the Lord his God, as the heart of David his father had been!\" I Kings 11:3-4. Was Solomon never \"actually\" a believer? According to the \"P,\" the author of those books was not.\n\nThe question of, \"Where is Ravi Zacharias?\" prompted the making of a YouTube video in which three Calvinists questioned the salvation of the world-famous apologist. John MacArthur, Abner Chou, and Justin Peters discussed question, \"Is Ravi Zacharias in hell?\n\nMacArthur started the conversation by asking, \"Can a Christian behave like that? Can we question his salvation?\" Chou answered, \"Zacharias was not repentant and wasn't fighting against the sin.\" STrike 2.\n\nMacArthur said that he wanted to add something: \"In order to live that way, you have to be sinning on multiple levels; lying, hiding, living a false life, all massive sins.\" Strike 2.\n\nChou spoke again: \"If someone came to you and admitted those sins in his life, would you tell him he was going to hell? Yes.\" Strike 3. He's out.\n\nMacArthur and Justin Peters echoed each other by saying, \"He never quoted the Scriptures; they were not a part of his life, and that was a dead give-away.\"\n\nIn another video, Peters said about Zacharias, \"I never did like him; he was always traveling, traveling, traveling, never sitting under the teaching of the Word. He was an Armenian and ecumenical.\"\n\nOK. Let's take a look at this. Notice that the comments are heavily involved with an examination of Zacharias' behavior, not his beliefs. As MacArthur said during the discussion, \"The fruit speaks.\" Two of the participants kept pointing to I John (without quoting any verse in it) using it incorrectly as containing tests for salvation whereas John, right up front, says that he's going to be writing about fellowship with God, not tests to see if his readers are saved. (cf. I Jn. 1:3)\n\nThe comments during the discussion focused on the wrong issue--works. Once that occurred, the ship is sailing on the deep and wide Sea of Subjectivity, the assurance of salvation vanishes when we comment the next sin, which we will (I Jn.1:8). Our assurance disappears when we say to God, \"I'll never do that again!\" and then we all prove ourselves to be liars because we \"do that again.\"\n\nThe issue is Zacharias' belief, not his behavior. The points the three raised have to do with sanctification, not salvation. In a discussion about sanctification, the points they raised are valid ones, that is, by traveling, traveling, traveling all the time, Mr. Zacharias was not under a regular and consistent ministry of the Word by a Bible-teaching pastor. This is a common snare for a Christian celebrity, as Zacharias was. But it's a trap for a Christian businessman as well.\n\nAt some point in his life, Ravi Z may have trusted Christ alone as the Son of God who died for his sins and rose from the dead. If so, he trusted in the \"Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.\" If so, he believed that \"God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believes in Him might have eternal life.\"\n\nIf so, we can say with Paul, \"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved.\"\n\n\"But evil men and impostors will proceed from bad to worse.\" (II Timothy 3:13)\n\nThe rebellion of fallen humanity against God is not static; it will continue to metastasize as time passes. The message Paul writes to Timothy is, paraphrased, \"Cheer up; things are always going to get worse on this planet until Christ returns.\"\n\nPeople who study history have an annoying habit: when someone mentions some current event, here comes the history major to intone, \"Yes, but that's not the first time that's happened,\" and then he'll proceed to give us a lecture to cure our ignorance. But when it comes to II Timothy 3:13, he can't lecture us because the growing rebellion has never been as evil as it is and will be as each day goes by. So, our over-educated and rude historian friend must fall silent.\n\nIn the times in which we live, this predicted rebellion gets worse with daily outrages. For example, has the opening of the recent Olympics in Paris ever been as rebellious as it was in 2024? The opening \"ceremony\" was so disgusting that to describe it is, in and of itself, an exercise in depravity.\n\nHas the so-called pride flag ever been carried and proudly displayed with relished ostentation in outer space to be televised as it orbits the earth in the space station as it was in December 2021?.\n\nHave children as young as kindergarten age ever been taken by their proud parents to sit and listen to a story time of perversion as given by depraved people in a public library? Has the People's House (aka the White House) ever been bathed in \"pride colors\" on the day the president signed the Respect for Marriage Act. (Notice the misnaming of the bill.)\n\nGoing back and referring to the Olympic Games' opening ceremony, a reporter went out on the street to get the opinions of the ceremony of passersby. Their response? \"It was a beautiful ceremony.\" \"It was so wonderfully inclusive.\" \"I liked it.\" Each of those responses summed up all of those shown, a further indication that France is dead spiritually.\n\nHas any opening ceremony featured a participant reclining on a dinner platter in an attempt to imitate Dionysus, the pagan god of drunkenness and orgies?\n\nFrom a news article after reviewing the reaction to the ceremony, we read this: \"First lady Jill Biden had high praise for the opening ceremony at the Paris Olympics. She called the opening ceremony 'spectacular.' Biden remarked that the U.S. would have to work hard to top Paris' opening ceremony when the games are held in Los Angeles in 2028.\"\n\nBut now for the rest of the story. As has been the tradition going back to the 1990s in Atlanta, the worldwide audience must sit still and listen with reverence to the worst song ever written, \"Imagine\" by John Lennon. (One noted author and commentator called it a Communist song. Therefore, in this case Lennon is like Lenin.) At it's core, the song is like the aforementioned ceremony, it's a secular hymn of rebellion.\n\nSpeaking of the French, they are considered to be the most anti-Christian nation in Europe. Annually, there are three anti-Christian attacks everyday in France, an average of 1,095 per year!\n\nThe sad part of that stat is that France is part of the West and the civilization of the West was built on Christianity. Ingrates, one and all.\n\nAccording to the Bible, all of this rebellion will grow until it will climax as predicted in II Thessalonians 2:3-4: the anti-Christ in the Temple declaring himself deity. He will be the ultimate rebel in the human race. All of the rebellion that outrages us today is the preparation for the coming of the anti-Christ whom the world, minus the raptured Christians, will welcome with open arms and adoring eyes.\n\nBut for blessed relief from reading all of the above, cleanse your eyes out with I Thessalonians 4:13-18.\n\nA business called Ali's Cookies is 18 miles from me. I've never been there to taste their wares; all I know is that it's located near the once hallowed halls of Emory University where the combined undergraduate tuition, fees, room and board for the academic year 2024-2025 will be $83,715. If that were to magically stay the same for four years of matriculation, the cost an undergraduate degree at Emory would be $338,860! (Start saving your shekels.)\n\nIt's in this elite academic atmosphere that the bakery sells its delectables nationwide. However, the profits for the bakery have dropped 50%; no business can exist with that free-fall. If your favorite radio station lost half its advertisers, the result would be silence on the airwaves.\n\nThe owners are getting mail on fire with hate, with words not fit to see the light of print. Vandals have defiled its walls with slogans vile and disgusting. Death threats to intimidate, defeat, and discourage are nonstop. In spite of this, the owners have said they love America and they aren't going anywhere.\n\nThere's a reason for these outrages: the owners are Jewish. They've harmed no one; they've broken no laws. There are those who hate them only because they exist.\n\nThere is nothing new under the sun, said Solomon.\n\nThe year was 1933:\n\n\"On April 1, 1933, the Nazis carried out the first nationwide, planned action against Jews: a boycott targeting Jewish businesses and professionals. Members of the Storm Troopers, with boycott signs, blocked the entrance to a Jewish-owned shop. One of the signs exhorts: 'Germans! Defend yourselves! Don't buy from Jews!'\n\n\"They targeted the offices of professionals such as doctors and lawyers. They painted the Star of David in yellow and black across thousands of doors and windows, with accompanying antisemitic slogans. Signs were posted saying, \"The Jews Are Our Misfortune.\" Throughout Germany, acts of violence against individual Jews and Jewish property occurred; the police intervened only rarely.\"\n\nIt isn't just the bakery. In Los Angeles:\n\n“It’s mayhem,” wrote a resident of a predominantly Jewish community that experienced an outbreak of violence on Sunday afternoon, June 23 as anti-Israel demonstrators descended on the area.\n\n\"Social media and citizen video along with firsthand reports describe a melee that combusted outside of Adas Torah Synagogue following a morning procession of demonstrators carrying Palestinian flags and wearing keffiyehs.\n\n\"One video shows a brutal beating of a women in the middle the street. Some of the protesters also purportedly wore symbols affiliated with terrorist organizations Hamas and Hezbollah and many had their faces covered with masks and scarves.\n\n\"Calls for violence against Jews exten ded to nearby streets, and while there was a police presence, many report that the officers were told to stand down and not intervene.\n\nWhat month and year is this in America? Is it June 2024 in America?. No, the month and year in America is April 1933.\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nIf you would like to send the owners a card with a note of encouragement, the address is:\n\nAli's Bakery\n\n1561 N. Decatur Rd. NE\n\nAtlanta, GA 30307\n\nPulitzer Prize winner Barbara Tuchman writes about the-great-used-to-be-in England and, although I took a course in college called, \"The History of England,\" our professor, Dr. Jacqueline Collins, never told us any of the following.\n\nThe year is 1538 and Henry VIII is on the throne. He issues a proclamation: \"One book of the whole Bible is to placed in every church in England.\" He orders the clergy to \"place the Bible in some prominent spot where your parishioners may most commonly resort to the same, and read it. You shall deprive no man from reading or hearing it but you shall expressly stir, provoke encourage, and exhort every person to read the same.\"\n\nHis reason for the decree was that the Bible had been translated into English and was accepted as the highest authority for an autonomous English church. Starting with this decree, the history, traditions, and moral law of the Hebrew nation became part of the English culture. For the next 300 years, the Bible was the most powerful influence on the English culture.\n\nMatthew Arnold said: \"The Bible linked the genius and history of us English to the genius and history of the Hebrew people.\" Wherever the Reformation took hold, the Bible replaced the pope as the final spiritual authority. Wherever the papal bull had ruled, the Word of God as revealed in the Hebrew revelation--Abraham, Moses, Isiah, Elijah, Daniel, down to Jesus and Paul now governed.\n\nThomas Huxley wrote: \"Consider the great historical fact that this book, the Bible, has been woven into the life of all that 's best and noblest in English history, that it has become the national epic of Britain.\"\n\nAfter the publication of the King James Bible in 1611, the adoption of the Bible was complete. Writers habitually used phrases like, \"the national Bible\" and called it \"the greatest of English classics.\" Another called it, the most venerable of the national heirlooms.\"\n\nTuchman also said, \"No other book penetrated so deeply the bone and spirit of English life.\"\n\nWhen Sir Walter Scott, author of Ivanhoe, lay dying, he asked Lockhart to read to him. Lockhart asked, What book?\" Scott replied, \"There is but one.\" (The Bible) So deeply had the Bible embedded itself in the British DNA that the King James Version influenced both the literature and the speech of England. It was THE book of English culture, causing one author to say that England had a \"mania\" for the Old Testament.\n\nIt was England that produced Wycliffe and Tyndale, men who learned the Greek and Hebrew languages to get the Bible into the hands of the \"vulgar,\" the common man, even to the plow boys of the realm\n\nWhat endeared the Bible to the British was its monotheism and its presentation of an orderly society based on the rules of social behavior between man and man and man and God.\n\nEveryone came to know the Bible and everyone honored it. \"It was in many a home, in fact, it was the only book in most. It was read over and over until its words and images were as familiar as bread.\" (Tuchman) British children learned long chapters by heart and knew the geography of Palestine better than their own.\n\nJohn Ruskin, in his autobiography, wrote on page 1 that at the bidding of his mother he had to read the entire Bible through, every syllable, every hard name, and all aloud from Genesis to Revelation, once a year and then begin again at Genesis 1:1 the next day. Lord Balfour, of the Balfour Declaration was trained in the Old Testament by his mother.*\n\nSo it was in the -great- used- to- be that God used a people from a tiny island to continue the transmission of the message of the Bible, generation after generation after generation.\n\nOne could only wish for a professor who teach the history of England from that perspective. Professor Collins did not.\n\n_______________________________________________\n\n*The Balfour Declaration was a public statement issued by the British Government in 1917 announcing its support for the establishment of a \"national home for the Jewish people in Palestine.\n\nThe tide of Jew hatred keeps crashing onto the shores of American institutions of lower learning which go by the names of \"University\" and \"College.\" The Jew hatred evidences itself in the destruction, defacing, and commandeering of buildings, forcefully prohibiting Jewish students and professors from their classes, opposing police, threatening Jews, and, in one case, killing a Jew.\n\n\"A California Superior Court judge ruled Wednesday that there is enough evidence for Moorpark College professor/pro-Hamas agitator Loay Alnaji to go to trial on charges of manslaughter in the death of Paul Kessler, a Jewish man who was involved in a counterprotest on November 5, 2023. Alnaji was involved in a confrontation with Kessler on that Sunday afternoon when he allegedly hit Kessler in the face with a bullhorn, causing Kessler to fall and fracture his skull. Kessler died approximately seven hours after the altercation.\"\n\nThere is an aspect of Jew hatred (\"antisemitism\" is a euphemism) that's going unnoticed which is clearly explained in the most neglected section of the Bible--the 12 Minor Prophets. (Jonah is the rare exception of this neglect.)\n\nLook at Obadiah. Yes, Obadiah. Who among us has heard a sermon or even a quote from the prophet who seems to be the most minor of the Minor Prophets? Obadiah, under divine inspiration, presents the overlooked factor in Jew hatred in its 21 verses. In verses 11-12, we see the iceberg toward which our uneducated and biblically illiterate elites are steering their ship of hate.\n\nI quote from Obadiah as God directs His anger at Edom, a once powerful nation now in history's boneyard:\n\n\"On the day that you stood aloof,\n\nOn the day that strangers carried off his wealth,\n\nAnd foreigners entered his gate\n\nAnd cast lots for Jerusalem—\n\nYou too were as one of them.\n\n12 “Do not gloat over your brother’s day,\n\nThe day of his misfortune.\n\nAnd do not rejoice over the sons of Judah\n\nIn the day of their destruction;\n\nYes, do not boast\n\nIn the day of their distress.\"\n\nThere were two sins involved in their hatred of the pupil of God's eye, Israel. The first is in verse 11: \"You stood aloof\" when the enemy came against Israel. The nation of Edom, the descendants of Esau, didn't come to the aid of their \"brother\" Israel, the descendants of Jacob. By not rendering aid and comfort to the Jews, they \"were as one of [the enemy].\" Not to render aid to Israel in a time of her distress is a punishable factor of Jew hatred.\n\nThen there was the matter of Edom's gloating over Israel's defeat and rejoicing in the day of her destruction. Gloating over Israel's misfortunes is another aspect of Jew hatred, an action of which God takes note.\n\nWhen we turn our attention to students and outside agitators involved in the campus chaos, it astounds us that their deluded minds gloated over and made heroes out of the savages, who in an early October attack, killed men, women, children, and babies, slaughtering, burning, kidnapping, and beheading as many as possible.\n\nIn the gloating, the students and agitators used their bodies to express the jubilation of their Jew hatred as their arms carried the flag of the depraved and their necks bore the scarves of the barbaric.To them, their dress was their sartorial splendor, their badges of honor in their gloating.\n\nBut it wasn't merely that. When we listened or read of their interviews, we noted a blatant tone of arrogance, the arrogance of the know-it-all-attitude-of-youth. Obadiah sounds an alarm about the arrogance that goes hand in hand Jew hatred. They speak with the dogmatic tongue. The prophet wrote : \"The arrogance of your heart has deceived you . . . You say, 'Who will bring me down?'\" Obadiah brings the terrifying answer, \"God will!\" (vss. 3-4). Romans 3:18 is the divine evaluation of their arrogance: \"There is no fear of God before their eyes.\"\n\nAn employee of the White Star Line, at the launch of the Titanic on May 31, 1911, said, \"Not even God Himself can sink this ship.\" One year later, when the British ship Titanic steamed out of Southampton on April 10, 1912, bound for New York , unbeknownst to the watching world, the captain and crew were on a collision course steering the largest man made object on earth straight toward her destruction.\n\nObadiah warned us.\n\n\"The question everyone is asking right now is an easy question: Why are these students — the most privileged people in the history of the world, no skill set, no problems — playing the part as terrorists and standing for murderous groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the like? Why are they overtly chanting anti-Semitic slogans? Why are they doing all of this? The answer is very simple. They want revolution.\" So wrote Ben Shapiro.\n\nThat's true. But let's ask one more question: \"Why do they want revolution?\" And the answer takes us right back to where we should be--the Bible.\n\nSETTING THE SCENE\n\nEven a cursory look at the Jews and the college campuses leaves a normal person saying, \"This is wrong!\" We see hostile students blocking Jewish students who have paid their ridiculously high tuition from going to class.\n\nFrom Columbia's website: \"Charges for all full-time entering MSW students are estimated to be a flat tuition rate of $26,036 per semester and are eligible to enroll for 10.5 to 19.5 credit hours each term.\n\n\"Students enrolled in the part-time programs will be charged $1,834 per credit. Students also are charged $1,834 per credit for credits over 19.5. NOTE: Tuition charges for students in the 5-term International Students Program are estimated to be $27,490 each for the Fall 2023 and Spring 2024 terms.\"\n\nJewish students are not only blocked from going to class, but are also harassed, in some cases physically assaulted, and they are the targets of slurs, insults, and chants to the extent that the campus rabbi told them to, \"Get out! Get out now!\" because they weren't safe.\n\nA mob of frenzied Jew-haters students busted windows, entered a campus building, took a hostage or two, and barricaded themselves inside. (They went on to demand the university feed them for the duration of their takeover!). That's just the tip of the iceberg. UCLA is in a state of anarchy. On that campus, one Jew hater addressing the mob using a bullhorn screamed, \"Israel and America are terrorist nations! Praise be to Hamas! Praise be to the freedom fighters!\" She was sending out her hallelujahs for those who murdered, mutilated, and beheaded innocent men, women, and babies at a music festival. All this from the \"educated.\"\n\nELITE REACTION\n\nYet, from celebrities and our elites, we either hear crickets or insanity such as this: \"Now even if you don’t agree with the subject of their protests, as long as they are peaceful, students should be allowed to protest. It’s their First Amendment right.\" (Stephen Colbert) He criticized universities that have called on law enforcement to use deescalation tactics and remove encampments put up by entitled students.\n\nHe failed to mention several instances where violence broke out between the protesters and police officers. Jewish students have cited feeling scared for their safety on campus, with many saying they have been verbally and physically assaulted by the mobs. Jew haters were seen waving signs that read “Final Solution,”— the official title of Nazi Germany for the policy of killing 6 million Jews. As one Jewish student, looking over world history, said, \"In every generation, they want to kill us.\"\n\nWe heard this from a NYC council member who called the police action a \"colossal disgrace, a horrifying affront to democracy and free speech, and an abject failure of public safety.\" This is twisted logic on steroids.\n\nOn what planet would breaking ,entering, shattering windows, vandalizing,erecting barricades, and kidnapping be deemed good? On what planet would this not be considered evil?\n\nTO THE QUESTION\n\nSo, what in the world is going on to have people actually condoning and believing that such criminal activities are the right thing to do.\n\nThis brings us to the deeper question, \"Where is all this coming from?\" This is where we go back to the Bible, to II Thessalonians 2: \"Because they did not accept the love of the truth so as to be saved. 11 For this reason God will send upon them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false.\"\n\nThe context of the verses is the worldwide response to the Anti-Christ during the Great Tribulation period, yet future. However the verse does express a principle: after a nation continues and continues its rebellion and rejection of the saving message of the gospel, God will send upon them \"a strong delusion\" as one translation puts it.\n\nWhat we are seeing is something God-sent--a delusion. It's a delusion they brought upon themselves for their rebellion in rejecting the truth. Romans 1:18ff deals with the same issue. A society can reach a point of insurrection against God and His Word, that He declares, \"If this is what you want . . .\" and He sends delusion.\n\nA result of this is that you can't reason with the delusional. They bought it on themselves.\n\nA suggestion for an experiment: print thousands of flyers with Genesis 12:3 printed on them; fly over the Jew haters campus camps and drop them. Then hover over the campus and watch the students/outside agitators go berserk in their rebellion.\n\nBased on Genesis 12:3, one person put it succinctly: \"They don't know Who they're messing with.\"\n\n.\n\nAs one author has suggested, don't call it \"antisemitism.\" That word has a multisyllabic soft sound. Call it what it is, Jew-hatred. Jew-hatred has erupted on many college campuses, Columbia University, Yale, Harvard, New York University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford, the University of Chicago, Princeton, the University of Virginia, Emory University, Brown University, Tufts, Michigan State University, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, SUNY Purchase, SUNY Rockland, Swarthmore, Brown, Cal Poly, The University of Texas (no surprise there) and the University of Southern California. All of those institutes of \"higher\" learning earned an \"F\" regarding protecting Jewish students.\n\nAt New York University, a frenzied mob of Jew-hating students clashed with police in hand-to-hand combat that looked like what it was, anarchy. Columbia's Jewish students were blocked from classes even though they paid tuition like everybody else. The university rabbi at Columbia told Jewish students: \"Get out! Get out now!\"They were in danger. The atmosphere of white hot Jew-hatred is so bad, the administration has surrendered--no more on-campus classes for the rest of the semester. The Jew-haters won and now are vowing to stay on.\n\nThe University of Southern California has canceled its main graduation ceremony. The school canceled the valedictorian’s planned commencement speech last week after the Muslim student, Asna Tabassum, was accused by multiple organizations of openly trafficking in Jew hatred on social media where a link she promoted featured propaganda that called for the complete eradication of Israel.\n\nLook at this current generation. It's a generation about which some are saying is the first generation in America to gain adulthood completely isolated from the Bible. (Others say they're the second generation in such an illiterate condition, but there's no need to quibble, the result is the same.)\n\nThe point is that this generation has been taught that Genesis is filled with, in the words of C. S. Lewis, \"fabulous stories.\" Yes, THAT C. S. Lewis. By \"fabulous\" he meant \"incredible\" as in, \"not credible.\" He didn't mean great sweeping accounts. He held to the idea that, \"There’s no reason why God, who spoke to ancient Israelites “in their weakness, after the manner of their language could not adapt familiar myths so 'that they might come to understanding.'\"\n\nThen, being taught that Genesis is a book of adapted mythology from the pagans around them, there's only one result possible: there was no call of Abraham, there was no God-promised land given to his descendanats, and, while you're at it, you can give a never-mind to Genesis 12:3b: \"Those who curse you [Israel] I will curse\" as a warning from God.\n\nHere's a guarantee: had the present generation been taught a literal hermeneutic in interpreting the Bible; had they been instructed in classical dispensationalism a la` Ryrie, Chafer, Walvoord, and Pentecost, there would be no the uproar, no chaos on American campuses, a chaos which is now showing up even in indoctrinated high schools as students walk out of class to show their support for Hamas. We would hear no chants of \"Death to Israel. Death to America\" in our land.\n\nThe chickens just won't stop coming home to roost.\n\nAmerican churches should be standing in support of Israel but where are they? They are soaked in Amillennialism which the Reformers like Luther and Calvin taught. Luther, in his later years, wrote a book, \"On the Jews and Their Lies,\" an 80+ page rant of promoting Jew-hatred to the point of violence.\n\nKurt Hendel, professor emeritus of Reformation history at the Lutheran School of Theology in Chicago, said of the Nazis, \"In November 1933, the Nazis marked the 450th anniversary of Luther’s birth with a nationwide 'German Luther Day.' Nazi Party leaders praised Luther’s “ethno-nationalist mission,” and called their movement 'the completion of the German Reformation in the Third Reich.' Nazi propagandists also celebrated the fact that the infamous Kristallnacht night of violence against Jews [destroying their synagogues] in 1938 fell on Luther’s birthday.\"\n\nOne Jewish professor at Columbia University summed it up-- \"I went to bed on October 7, 2023, and woke up the next morning in 1933.\"\n\nFrom one coast to the other, we are witnessing myriads of students, faculty, and outside Jew haters creating mayhem and chanting slogans in support of a terrorist organization of Jew-haters that, on October7, 2023, murdered 1,400 innocent people, and had orders to kill everyone they saw, including beheading victims and cutting off their legs.They went from home to home, from room to room, throwing grenades and killing everyone, including women and children. Hamas ordered them to crush their heads and cut them off. Further photographic evidence shows a burned baby, gunmen shooting the dead bodies of civilians in cars, militants in the process of beheading a body with a hoe, and burnt corpses thrown in a dumpster.\n\nWe are seeing the fulfilling of Romans 8:28 live and in living color: \"And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind,\"Depravity\" as in supporting the the savages who behead, burn and kill women children, and infants.\n\nFrom university to university, we are not seeing educated minds. We are staring at depraved, deranged, and demonic minds on a rampage of evil."
