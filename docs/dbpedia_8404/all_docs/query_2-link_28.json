        "text": "Mark first joined the Law School in 2000. From 2005 to 2007 he taught criminology at the University of Melbourne. He is Joint Chief Editor of the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology and is Research Section Head, Criminology and Criminal Justice, College of Business, Government and Law. Mark's key areas of interest include youth offending, repeat incarceration and rehabilitation, gun violence, Aboriginal social exclusion, and desistance from crime. He has received five successive Australian Research Council (ARC) grants enabling study of these and related issues. From 2004 to 2013, Mark conducted Australia's longest and most in-depth study of repeat incarceation and desistance from crime among a group of young men aged 15 to 29 years. The book based on that research (Young Offenders: Crime, Prison and Struggles for Desistance) won the 2017 Christine M Alder Book Prize. He has also undertaken consultancies for state and local governments in areas ranging across graffiti vandalism, restorative and therapeutic justice, correctional corruption, offender reintegration, mentoring and serious repeat youth offending. He serves on the editorial boards of the International Series on Desistance and Rehabilitation (Routledge) and the International Journal for Crime and Justice. In 2017 he was awarded a four-year ARC grant for the project Reducing Aboriginal Imprisonment: An Offence-Specific Study. The project will examine the relationship between repeat imprisonment and several of the key communties in South Australia and the Northern Territory to which Aboriginal people return following release from custody for assault and/or offences against justice procedures (e.g. for breaches of bail or parole).\n\nResearch\n\nNationally Competitive Grants\n\nARC Discovery [DP150100619] (2015-2017), $234300 (with Andrew Goldsmith (Flinders University) & David Bright (UNSW))\n\nUnderstanding and preventing gun violence: A qualitative study\n\nARC Discovery [FT120100284] (2013 to 2016), $727146\n\nGenerations through prison: A critical exploration of the causes, experiences and consequences of intergenerational incarceration\n\nARC Discovery [DP0984562] (2009-2013), $501903\n\nGenerativity in young male (ex)prisoners: Caring for self, other and future within prison and beyond\n\nARC Discovery [DP0556471] (2005-08), $161000\n\nUnderstanding recidivism and repeat incarceration among young male offenders: A biographical and longtudinal approach\n\nSelected Consultancies & Commissioned Reports\n\nGoldsmith, A., Halsey, M. & Groves, A.
