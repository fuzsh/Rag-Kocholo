        "text": "The body which oversees refereeing in England has denied claims made by Mark Halsey over the reporting of incidents during matches.\n\nFormer referee Halsey claims he was told by the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) to say he hadn't seen incidents in matches.\n\nHalsey, who retired in 2013, made the claim during a Twitter debate over Sergio Aguero's appeal against a three-match ban for elbowing Winston Reid.\n\nHalsey wrote: \"I have been in that situation, when I have seen an incident and been told to say I haven't seen it.\"\n\nWhen Halsey was pushed further he revealed: \"To be fair to the FA... it's not them. It comes from within the PGMOL.\"\n\nBut a PGMOL statement read: \"Match officials submit their reports, including critical incidents, directly to the FA. Match officials ensure that their reports are a full and accurate description of the incident.\n\n\"There is no pressure from the PGMOL to include or omit anything.\""
