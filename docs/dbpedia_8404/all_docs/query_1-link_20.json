        "text": "Mark Halsey was born in Hull, East Yorkshire in 1961.\n\nHe completed a foundation course in art at the Hull College in 1981. Following this he worked in industry as a decorative designer while at the same time gaining recognition as a portrait painter as well as a figurative/abstract artist. Over the next few years Mark began to develop his own particular style and his work was increasingly shown in regional galleries throughout the north of England.\n\nMark's work has regularly been sold in art fairs in London, Glasgow, Amsterdam, Singagpore and New York. Mark has undertaken many commissions for wine bars, offices and hotels. His work can also be seen in many TV dramas having been purchased by Granada Studios in Manchester\n\nMark practices martial arts, meditation, and Reiki, all of which have opened his mind and provided him with a wealth of inspiration for his work."
