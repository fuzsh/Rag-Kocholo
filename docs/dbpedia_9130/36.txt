The Volunteer Centre Osijek is an organisation dedicated to the development of volunteerism, as well as to structuring continuous support for volunteers and organisations in need. The centre is in Osijek, the capital of the eastern Croatian region of Slavonija and Baranja. It was founded in December 2005 on the International Day of Volunteers. This was the result of a joint effort made by the members of the Regional Advisory Board for the Development of Volunteerism. The Volunteer Centre Osijek envisions a society where citizens are motivated to make positive changes in their communities and thus contribute to the quality of their lives in a quicker, more efficient, and yet more human way. Its mission is to involve citizens in community life through civil society development and organised volunteer work in the region.
