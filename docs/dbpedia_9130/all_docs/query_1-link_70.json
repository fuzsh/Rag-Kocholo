        "text": "Want to see a different side of Croatia? Slavonia is the region for you. Through these seven cities, you’ll learn about its natural beauty, historic cities, and unique cuisine.\n\nIsobel Coughlan\n\nIf you’re ready to immerse yourself in raw countryside beauty, traditional folklore, and fairytale-like streets, Slavonia, Croatia, is the hidden gem you’ve been looking for. Of this country’s four regions, it’s the least traveled path. But it’s time to change this.\n\nScroll down to discover the natural beauty and rich culture of the top seven cities in Slavonia. Plus, we have tips for packing, route planning, and the weather. Keep reading, and you’ll be a Croatia pro in minutes.\n\nSlavonia, at a glance\n\nSituated in the northeast of Croatia, Slavonia is a region most tourists skip. But as beautiful as the coastline is, this region’s authentic culture, rural villages, and warm hospitality should be on your list as well.\n\nSlavonia is famous for its agricultural significance. However, the real star of the show is the local wine. This region is known for refreshing white wines from the Grasevina grape. Imagine sipping a cold glass while admiring rolling hills. Divine.\n\nThis area is also known for folklore and traditional festivals. There’s always music and dancing. If you want to connect with Croatia’s myths and legends, this is the place to do it.\n\nGeographically, this region sits next to the Danube and Drava rivers and the Sava River on its south side. It borders Hungary, Serbia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The closer you reach the borders, the more unique the culture becomes!\n\nA note before you book: Slavonia isn’t on the major Croatian tourist trail. So, don’t expect everyone to speak English! Some prior travel experience is helpful when visiting this region.\n\n7 Cities In Slavonia, Croatia You Must Visit\n\nGet ready to see Croatia’s non-tourist side. Here are the top seven cities in Slavonia to visit.\n\nVukovar\n\nVukovar, also known as the Heroic Town on the Danube, is a must-visit stop in Slavonia.\n\nIt’s on the Croatia-Serbia border and was significant in the 1990s Yugoslav Wars.\n\nToday, life in Vukovar is peaceful, and the city is intact. But a few decades ago, it was completely different. Looking closely, you can see remnants of the war and the siege — just look at the destroyed water tower.\n\nVukovar is all about history and remembrance.\n\nWhile here, you can visit Eltz Manor (an 18th-century Baroque palace), the Vukovar City Museum, Syrmia County Palace, and the church of Saint Nicholas.\n\nEven the city center is beautiful. The exquisite buildings are from the Austro-Hungarian empire and still have their original facades.\n\nWant to take a day trip to Serbia? You can jump from Vukovar to Belgrade in 2 hours and 40 minutes via bus. Don’t forget your passport!\n\nDakovo\n\nNext up is Dakovo, a town in the center of Slavonia.\n\nCompared to other cities in Slavonia, Dakovo is more remote and rustic — that’s precisely why you should visit. Here, you can enjoy a blend of natural beauty and traditional Croatian culture without bumping into big cruise ship tour groups (*ahem* Dubrovnik).\n\nHighlights of Dakovo include:\n\nDilji Mountain\n\nDakovo Ethnographic Museum\n\nThe city center\n\nSt. Peter’s Cathedral\n\nWhile here, book yourself into a Lipizzaner horse show. These happen at the Dakovo State Stud Farm all year round.\n\nYou can jump from Zagreb to Dakovo in approximately 3 hours and 15 minutes via bus. Perfect if you’re flying to the capital.\n\nPožega\n\nIntroducing Požega, a Slavonian town situated between rolling hills and low mountains. If you’re dreaming of a countryside experience, you’ll find it here.\n\nFertile farmland, sprawling vineyards, and quaint villages surround Požega. In autumn, this area is dubbed the “Golden Valley,” thanks to the rich golden-yellow colors of the local flora. You’ll want a window seat on this journey.\n\nThings to do in Požega include:\n\nVisiting family farms for produce tasting (wine, veal steaks, Slavonian ham and chutneys).\n\nHiking up Požeška Gora Hill for unbeatable views of the Slavonian Mountains.\n\nLearning about the culture from the City Museum of Požega.\n\nMonastery of the Sisters of Charity\n\nMany visitors choose to see the region by bicycle. This is the best way to get from tavern to tavern, but cycling with a belly full of hearty food and wine is easier said than done!\n\nZagreb to Požega takes 2.5 hours via bus. You can reach this countryside gem in no time.\n\nVinkovci\n\nIf you want to dive into Slavonian history and folklore, Vinkovici is the town for you.\n\nFun Fact: Vinkovci has been inhabited for over 8,000 years — it’s the oldest inhabited town in Europe!\n\nThat’s right. Vinkovici dates back to the Neolithic age.\n\nIt’s also the birthplace of two Roman emperors (Valentinian I and Valens). It was part of the Ottoman and Habsburg Empires. In the 18th century, it became part of the Slavonia Military Frontier, and today, it’s part of independent Croatia. Wow.\n\nPopular attractions in Vinkovci include:\n\nSaints Eusebius and Pollio Church\n\nVinkovci Town Museum\n\nChurch of St. Elias on Meraja\n\nSopot Archaeology Park\n\nMake sure you take a break and sample the local cuisine. Top dishes include goose, fish, and kulen (a sausage made from minced pork). You can wash these down with rakija, a Balkan fruit brandy.\n\nWant to learn more about the Austro-Hungarian Empire? Skip from Vinkovci to Graz to discover Austria. Take your passport!\n\nOsijek\n\nSlavonia isn’t just small country towns and rolling hills. Osijek is the fourth-largest city in Croatia and the largest in the region. Unsurprisingly, this makes it Slavonia’s cultural and economic center and the best place to visit for a night out.\n\nWalking through the city streets, you’ll notice the distinct Viennese-style buildings. But if you look even closer, you’ll see bullet holes from the Yugoslav Wars. If you want to learn about the wars and pay your respects, Osijek should be on your list.\n\nWhile in Osijek, you should explore the Tvrda. This part of the city dates back to the Middle Ages and was transformed into a fortress by the Austrians.\n\nYou can also visit the nearby Kopacki Rit Nature Park, Osijek Zoo (the largest in the country), the Museum of Slavonia, the Church of St. Anthony, and the Upper Town.\n\nFancy region-hopping? If you head from Osijek to Porec, you can travel from Slavonia to coastal Istria.\n\nThis takes 8.5 hours via bus. You’ll see the sea in no time.\n\nSlavonski Brod\n\nSituated in the south of Slavonia, Slavonski Brod marks the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nThis city is known for its iconic Brod Fortress. This formidable building was created in 1714, and you can still visit it today. Within the fortress, you’ll find the Tambura Museum, which is packed with multimedia exhibits and interactive workshops.\n\nIf you want to see the heart of Slavonski Brod, head to the Korzo town square. This historic square is massive, and those with a keen eye will notice it’s even larger than Zagreb’s Jelacic Square. This is a great place to sip freshly brewed coffee while taking in Croatian life.\n\nPro tip: In the winter, Korzo Square has a small ice rink. Don’t miss it!\n\nOther popular things to do in Slavonski Brod include:\n\nCity center walking tours\n\nSlavonski Brod cemetery\n\nBike tours\n\nTasting local Tiritilli cookies (sweet cookies made with fruit jams, walnuts, and poppy seeds)\n\nWant to compare the squares? Zagreb to Slavonski Brod only takes 2 hours and 15 minutes by bus.\n\nLipik\n\nLast but not least is Lipik. This little town is on the eastern border of Slavonia and is not as well known as the larger cities on this list. But it’s a must-see spot for genuine small-town life.\n\nMost visitors in Lipik stop by to take in the country view, enjoy local spas, and generally detox from busy modern life. It’s also a hotspot for fishing enthusiasts, as you can fish in the nearby Pjeskara and Raminac lakes.\n\nYou can also explore stunning churches, such as the Church of St. Catherine the Martyr and the Virgin in Gaj and the Church of St. Anthony in Antunovac.\n\nSince it’s a small town, Lipik isn’t as connected as Croatia’s big cities. It’s easiest to get to if you own a car, so add this to your road trip itinerary. Zagreb to Lipik takes just under two hours via car or taxi.\n\nAlternative must-see places in Slavonia\n\nTraveling for longer? Here are some other top places you need to see in Slavonia.\n\nPapuk – Papuk is the largest mountain in the region, and you’ll find it next to Pozega. The area is a member of the European Geoparks Network and UNESCO’s Global Geoparks Network, proving its prowess. Perfect for hikers, nature lovers, and explorers.\n\nKaranac — Situated 30 minutes north of Osijek, Karanac initially looks like a standard small town. But it’s actually a cultural hub tourists flock to. Here, you can admire preserved old-fashioned architecture, sip on local wines, and feast on traditional foods (such as snails in nettle sauce or fried locust flowers!)\n\nKopački Rit Nature Park — Located northwest of Osijek, the Kopački Rit Nature Park is a true hidden gem. This swamp park boasts 238 hectares of pristine wetland and over different species of birds. A visit here is like a trip to a different planet.\n\nWeather in Slavonia, Croatia\n\nKnow before you go.
