        "text": "A 'Tvrđa' for defensive purposes\n\nWhen you visit the 'Tvrđa' ('citadel') in Osijek, which stands on the right-hand bank of the river Drava, not far from its confluence with the Danube and overlooking the surrounding marshes, you will understand why the site has such strategic and defensive importance. The site was originally occupied by the Romans, who built the town of Mursa on it. And later it was occupied by the Slavs as it kept them safe from the risk of flooding. Osijek was subsequently destroyed then rebuilt by the Ottomans in the 16th century before eventually being retaken by the Habsburgs.\n\nIt was during this era that the construction of the citadel began, the intention being to ensure the city would not be lost again! The Austro-Hungarians therefore chose to build this defensive bastion on the heights of Osijek and enclose the centre of the 18th century town within its thick walls. The succession of beautifully baroque-fronted buildings, squares and cobbled streets here form a highly attractive architectural ensemble, which is gradually being restored.\n\nAll the museums you could wish for and Gornji Grad, the high town\n\nThere are several museums within the citadel walls. It would take quite a while to visit them all, but you can always opt just for the Archaeological Museum, which houses a collection of antiquities dating from the Roman era through to that of the Celts. As for the Museum of Slavonia, this is a good place to visit if you want to learn about the region's history and heritage. There is also the Gloria Maris Museum to visit too, though its maritime theme can seem somewhat out of place."
