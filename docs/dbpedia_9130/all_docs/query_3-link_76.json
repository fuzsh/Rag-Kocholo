        "text": "European Capital of Culture is a thriving cultural programme of the European Union, with benefits for the cultural life of cities and regions and also for the economic development of some of the titleholders. Development of cultural and creative sector – cultural and creative industries – is an integral part of the economic development of cities who decide to run for the European Capital of Culture title. (Cultural) tourism and the overall economy of the region are also developed directly through the project. In 2020, for the first time in history of the project, one city from the Republic of Croatia will hold the European Capital of Culture title. This is a great opportunity for Osijek as a regional center – there is a possibility of redefining and reprogramming city development strategies and the possibility of a new positioning within the European Union. The paper provides an overview of the connections of the European Capital of Culture and urban and regional development through the growth of the cultural and creative sector, and also brings a draft of a successful development strategy for Osijek and the region in the context of this programme. The purpose of the survey is to identify trends in the development of the creative sector within the European Capital of Culture, and the attempt to forecast what would be the positive effects of the programme on Osijek. It provides an overview of the possible directions of development in the city's independent candidacy, regional and macro-regional candidacy (Osijek - Eastern Croatian – Pannonian candidacy).\n\nThe paper will explore cultural policies and strategies for sustainable urban development in Croatian cities that have announced candidacy for the European Capital of Culture 2020. Comparative study will show how individual cities use their local cultural resources, a common European heritage and creative potential of their citizens in sustainable development and international cooperation. The research will focus on cultural specificities of each city, their cultural identity and cultural diversity, which make them unique on the cultural map of Europe. On the other hand, we will explore the elements of a common European identity, multicultural history and heritage. Culture is thereby considered an essential driver and enabler of sustainable urban development based, in a broader context of cultural economy, on the strategic use of local culture, local resources and local participative democracy.\n\n\"The title of European Capital of Culture brings an opportunity for physical and symbolic transformation of designated cities and it is increasingly accompanied by urban marketing strategies that exceed the duration of the events programme. Not only does the designation have a positive effect on citizens pride and media coverage, but it is also seen as a means of attracting inward investment and increasing the number of visitors. Nominated cities also take advantage of some of these benefits. Such approaches also involve a political economy in which the concepts of culture and creativity have come to assume a central role. This paper presents a review and critical appraisal of the variety of urban transformations involved through selected case studies. In this competition, cities put culture at the heart of regeneration and become a centre of entertainment and exhibition, where, according to Urry and McCannell, there is almost no limit for a city to transform all its social, historic and natural elements into attractions. This process implies the construction of a number of cultural facilities and projects, it also involves the restoration of historic monuments and the regeneration of run-down neighbourhoods including historic cities, the waterfront or former industrial sites.\"\n\nThe Role of Cultural Institutions in Creating the Policy for Candidacy of the European Capital of Culture Jasna Jovanov, Department of Geography, Tourism and Hotel Management, Novi Sad, Tijana Palkovljević, Lolita Pejović, The Gallery of Matica srpska, Novi Sad The title of the European Capital of Culture is recognized as an opportunity for renewal and modernization of cultural institutions as the promoters in the nomination procedure, improving their appeal to the audience. This event, which lasts for one year is designed to highlight the cultural esources, regional characteristics and integration of the city’s various cultural segments into the uropean cultural matrix. The prerequisite for the candidacy is primarily the awareness of the local ommunity on the need and importance of involve ment in this process and different benefits that ould result. Defined cultural policy of the region and the city profiles the identity of all institutional and non-institutional participants and improves the interdepartmental cooperation between Culture and Tourism. Positive attitude and cooperation of these segments is a prerequisite for the candidate status and participation in further processes. The preparation for obtaining the candidate status opens possibilities of expanding citizens’ knowledge on cultural offer and its lesser-known elements. At the same time, the city would be recognized by its culture, being a participant of wider cultural processes. The preparations for the candidacy of Novi Sad for the European Capital of Culture 2020 started at the beginning of 2012. In this process, two main target groups have to be considered: local residents and tourists. Therefore, in order to propose a concept which will fulfill the needs of both target groups, the aim of this paper is to present the program potentials of cultural institutions, with special reference to museums, their role and importance during the nomination process and within the event, concerning the tourist offer of the city and the region. Keywords: European Capital of Culture, museums, tourism, Novi Sad\n\nThe European Capital of Culture, one of the most visible and well-known cultural initiatives of the European Union, has evolved over the last 25 years from a one-year interdisciplinary cultural festival into a possible tool for urban change and development. Many cities participating in the competition see the title not only as a way to broaden the cultural offer of the city, but also to initiate sustainable change with culture as the determinant of development. The recent competition in Poland brought together 11 candidate cities competing for the title in 2016. Many of them, aware of the latest trends in urban politics, included support for creativity and creative industries in their proposed strategies. Although 10 of the cities lost the competition (with Wrocław as the winner), one can argue that there was a benefit in the participation anyhow – the change in the paradigm of thinking about the connections between culture and socio-economic development on the city level. The article will aim at verification of the creative city concept in the cities’ bids for the title, presenting a new trend in the urban cultural policy of Polish big cities."
