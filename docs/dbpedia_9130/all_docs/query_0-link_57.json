Abovementioned projects have been mainly related to the development of energy efficiency, entrepreneurship platforms, economic development, environmental protection, renewable energy, and others. City of Osijek holds a substantial experience in the project implementation. It would often be conducted in partnership with the Regional development agency – Slavonija and Baranja (RRA), as well as with other cities in the Osijek-Baranja County.
