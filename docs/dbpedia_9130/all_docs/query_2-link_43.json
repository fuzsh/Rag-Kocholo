        "text": "One of the lesser visited places in Croatia is Osijek, the country’s 4th biggest city. It is a beautiful and historic city, thus there’s lots to see and do. This includes a beach on the river, lots of art nouveau architecture and a fortress. Osijek is in the Slavonia region of Croatia and is relatively near to the Bosnia and Serbia border.\n\nThe River Drava runs through Osijek and farmland and beautiful countryside also surround the city. Agriculture of the region influences the quality and freshness of produce in the city’s markets. The Slavonia region of Croatia has a unique style of cuisine, which is delicious. You can find many places in the city serving these local specialities.\n\nOsijek is an interesting place to visit and is a great option for slow travel. It seems to be much cheaper than the Croatia Seaside for food, drink and accommodation.\n\nThings To Do in Osijek, Croatia\n\nThere are lots of options for things to do in the city which kept me busy. Be aware the city is in transition and some of the main sights are being renovated.\n\nSee The Red Fico War Memorial\n\nRed Fico is a unique monument and war memorial in Osijek. It is a tribute to a world famous act of defiance in the early stages of the Croatian War of Independence. Basically, a resident was protesting the incoming forces by putting a red fico in the way of oncoming T55 tanks.\n\nThe Red Fico was destroyed by the tank, which was captured on video. This moment became a symbol of the resilience of the Croatian People. 20 years later, they created the memorial. On the monument, the Fico is now running over the tank. It’s well worth a walk out of the city to see the unique memorial.\n\nFind The Notable Art nouveau Buildings In The City\n\nA fun thing to do is to rent a Bolt e-scooter and seek out the notable Art nouveau architecture in the city. I found a map highlighting 30 buildings in the city and I decided to find them all. These are quite spread out, so I rented a Bolt scooter to speed up my quest.\n\nMany of these buildings are stunning to see with some fantastic details ad colours. Many have new uses, including shops, eateries and offices. However, some are in need of some love and renovation.\n\nIf you are short on time and want to see the best examples of these, head to Europska avenija which has a row of stunning buildings.\n\nExplore The Old Town Area Tvrđa\n\nThe old town of Osijek, Tvrđa, is a citadel with lots of interesting features. It is currently being regenerated, thus there are parts that are closed. You can see some though, including big town squares, the bastion and gates. I think when completed, it will be a lovely place. On my visit, I saw the church and popped in both museums.\n\nThey started construction of the fortress in 1712 after defeating the Ottoman army in 1687. By 1715, they had completed the bastions and gates. They further added more bastions and completed the inner town. Once complete, it became the most advanced Habsburg fortress on the Ottoman Empire’s border. Sadly, all that remain is two bastions with towers and a gate.\n\nApparently, Tvrda is the best-preserved and largest collection of Baroque buildings in Croatia. It is all within a Habsburg star fortress, which reminded me somewhat of the Alba Carolina citadel. The World Monuments Fund describes Tvrda as a unique example of an eighteenth-century baroque military, administrative, and commercial urban centre. It’s also on the tentative list for Croatia to become a world heritage site.\n\nSightseeing at Trg Svetog Trojstva\n\nTrg Svetog Trojstva is a square inside the Tvrda fortress and is a great place for sightseeing. Pleasant buildings surround the square and it also has some nice statues. It’s a popular place to enjoy a coffee or beer.\n\nThe square’s original name was Vinki Trg or Wine Square. This is because wine was delivered twice weekly for soldiers and innkeepers. The dominant feature of the square is a baroque statue of the Holy Trinity. Sadly, on my visit, this was covered and being restored. One of the prettiest buildings in the square is the main city guard watchtower. This now houses the archaeology museum.\n\nVisit Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul\n\nDominating the new part of the city’s skyline is the Cathedral of St Peter and St Paul. This is a neo-gothic church which was built in 1898 and is rather striking from the outside.\n\nThey built it with mostly brick, of which there are over 3.5 million bricks used in its construction. This is the tallest building in the country outside of Zagreb, the capital. It’s rather big inside too and can accommodate 3000 people for mass.\n\nYou can enter the church via a side door which is overlooked by three gargoyles. Inside is equally pleasant and has lots of neo-gothic features. The walls also have some bright frescoes featuring both old and new Testament stories. On my visit, I had the place to myself and had a good mooch around.\n\nSightseeing at Ante Starčevića Square\n\nIn the centre of the city, near to the cathedral is Ante Starčevića Square. Ante Starčevića Square is a nice place to hang out and sit on various benches in the area. The square has a central fountain and is a bit of a heat trap on warm days.\n\nThere’s lots of pleasant buildings surrounding the square. They used most of these as retail outlets, including a big Konzum supermarket and a Mlinar bakery. My favourite building at the edge is Art nouveau in style and is currently a pharmacy. There is a bus/tram stop at the square, so it’s easy to get to other parts of the city from here.\n\nVisit The Museum of Slavonia\n\nThe Museum of Slavonia is in the main square of Tvrđa the Hapsburg citadel. It’s rather interesting inside and has lots of artefacts from the Roman era onwards. They have en eclectic set of exhibits in the museum including one about local radio.\n\nThe museum also covers furniture of the region, including an impressive selection of dining chairs. Other sections that piqued my interest were some fantastic ornamental clocks and clothing.\n\nThey clearly marked the exhibits in Croatian and English, so easy to follow, with a few exceptions. I enjoyed the museum and having it to myself was rather nice.\n\nEnjoy Slavonian Food in the Eateries of the City\n\nOsijek has some great restaurants including those that serve Slavonian and Croatian Food. There are options for restaurants throughout the city, including riverside eateries on boats to more low key places in the city. They usually have both inside or outside seating and provide table service. There are also options for dog friendly places for drinks or food, including cafes and bars.\n\nThere are three standout dishes that are in many of the local restaurants. This includes Perkelt od soma, Slavonski Čobanac and Fiš paprikaš. All dishes include one of my favourite ingredients, Paprika. This is because Hungarian cuisine influences the area. You can also choose many traditional Croatian dishes too.\n\nVisit The Farmers Market\n\nThe Slavonia region of Croatia is known for its agricultural produce and lots of the country’s food is grown here. Thus the local farmer’s market is brimming with quality food produce. You can purchase a variety of locally grown or produced food and drink items here.\n\nDo Wild Swimming in The River Drava at Cocacobana Beach\n\nOn the far bank of the river Drava is Cocacobana beach, a great place to spend time. This is a sandy beach with volleyball courts, beach bars and a swimming area. The beach is pleasant and a nice place to spend time on warm days.\n\nYou can wild swim in the river, however the river’s speed and current can be a bit intimidating. Expect to be carried downstream quickly by the current.\n\nOsijek Catacombs & Crown Fortress\n\nA fun thing to do is to walk along the River Drava to find the Osijek Catacombs AKA the Crown Fortress. You can walk through the Catacombs to see them up close for free. This is from the 18th century and it served as a quarantine. Soldiers stayed there after returning from the European battlefields, before they were allowed to go to the main fortress across the river.\n\nMost of the site is ruins, however, they have only renovated the powder room, where plays and concerts are occasionally held. Overall, the catacombs and crown fortress are well worth a walk to see.\n\nSt. Michael’s Church\n\nA pleasant building to see when in Tvrda, the old town is St. Michael’s Church. It’s a beautiful two spired baroque church that is bright yellow. It’s in a pleasant town square which has other nice buildings and a few statues to see.\n\nSt Michael’s Church dates back to 1725, when the Jesuits laid the first stone. They built it on the foundations of the former Kasimpasa mosque, which the Ottomans built. Finally, it was finished in 1768. More recently, the church was damaged in the Croatian War of Independence, but has been renovated since then.\n\nThe church is a Roman catholic parish church which is open for mass daily. At other times, it’s not open to visitors, which is a shame. However, you can see the interior through a gate at the front door. Inside, they have 7 altars and some baroque art.\n\nSee The Pejačević Castle Ruins & Mausoleum\n\nAnother place to see in Osijek is the Pejačević Castle Ruins. They are slightly out of town to the east and worth a detour if on the river bank near the new football stadium. You can’t visit the site unfortunately, but the building looks interesting, albeit in need of some love. This is one of many classical manor houses owned by the Pejačević’s a noble family. They completed the building in 1801 after the family acquired the estate in 1750.\n\nThe Pejačević Family also has a mausoleum in the nearby Retfala cemetery. Sadly, both have been neglected. Hopefully, one day, they find a new use and returned to their former selves.\n\nVisit The Chapel of the Queen of Peace\n\nOn the banks of the River Drava is the Queen of Peace Chapel, a poignant memorial. The site shows the names of war casualties. Memorial plaques with the names of Greater-Serbian aggression casualties were placed in the Queen of Peace Chapel. I visited as part of a longer walk between the bridges on the river. It’s in a beautiful setting and a stark reminder of recent history.\n\nWatermill On The River Drava\n\nWhen walking on the city side of the River Drava, you can see a wooden watermill, which is pretty interesting. This wooden watermill is a replica of one from bygone eras. Osijek is part of the Miller’s Route, an EU heritage project that also crosses through Hungary.\n\nThe watermill has a little cottage, which used to show how the grain is ground. Historically, the city had 60 watermills, the last one of which closed in 1944. Overall, a pleasant feature to see on the river. However, the watermill was closed during my visit.\n\nParade of Croatian greats at Tvrda\n\nA nice place to visit while exploring Tvrda is the Parade of Croatian greats. Basically, it’s a pleasant park with a fountain and lots of statues. It’s a great place to sit and enjoy the views of the nearby Baroque architecture. There’s a Mlinar bakery nearby, thus a good place to sit and enjoy a snack.\n\nCross Pješački Most Pedestrian Bridge and Enjoy The Views\n\nPješački Most is a Pedestrian and cycling Bridge across the River Drava in Osijek. It’s a beautiful suspension bridge that they built in 1981. It quickly became a symbol of the city and is nice to see while walking across the riverbanks.\n\nThe views of the bridge are splendid, this includes towards the new town, the old town and along the river. You can also see the beautiful local countryside too. As a bonus, the bridge is a great place to enjoy the sunset.\n\nVisit The Archaeology Museum\n\nIn Tvrda, the old town and fortress of Osijek is the local Archeology museum. They house this in a beautiful Baroque building in the main stare of the citadel.\n\nThe museum is well worth a mooch around and is a fun thing to do. Inside there are various collections covering everything that was found during excavations of the area.\n\nThe archaeology museum covers a few floors and has some great exhibits and most had text in English, so was easy to follow without a translation app. The collections of stone from old churches, coin and pottery were particularly interesting.\n\nWatch The Sunset\n\nA fun thing to do wherever you travel is to watch the sunset after a nice day’s sightseeing. There are various places to enjoy the late sun in Osijek.\n\nMy favourite is walking along the river Drava and you get some really colourful skies. There are also bars on boats there you can enjoy the spectacle.\n\nHiking & Birdwatching\n\nOver the footbridge from the city is a lovely hiking area, this has trails along the river and into some pleasant woodland. There are various trails to choose from for hikes. They also have hides at various points which are ideal for birdwatching or wildlife spotting. You can find various other hiking trails from the city on Komoot.com.\n\nVisit Both Football Stadiums\n\nA fun thing for some people to do is to visit football stadiums when travelling. Osijek has two at the moment, the old stadium and a brand new one by the river. I took a lime scooter to visit both in a day and they were quite nice. The old one has lots of football related street art nearby, which was fascinating.\n\nBother were nice to see from the outside in different ways. NK Osijek plays at the new stadium and if you time your visit right, you may be able to get tickets to watch a match. You can arrange tickets on their website.\n\nThe Zoo\n\nAnother popular attraction in the city is the local zoo, which is alongside the river. This is the biggest zoo in Croatia and rather popular. It also has a big aquarium to see to water life too. They have various animals to see, from the small guinea pigs to lions. You can find out about visiting on their website.\n\nBazeni Copacabana\n\nA fun place that i enjoyed some fun in the water was Bazeni Copacabana. Bazeni Copacabana is an outdoor pool and a water park, which is quite popular. This is easier than swimming on the river beach and a bit more relaxed. There are options for seating by the pool here and some places to purchase refreshments.\n\nOther Places of Interest\n\nSee The Monastery and church of St. James\n\nCatch A Performance in the Croatian National Theatre\n\nRelax in One of The Many Parks in The city\n\nShell Museum and Water World\n\nUseful Information For Travellers\n\nSome information to help backpackers and slow travellers make the most of their stay in Osijek.\n\nCash is useful here, especially in the cafes, bars and markets of Osijek. There are a few ATMs that give free withdrawals.\n\nThere is a self-service launderette to do your laundry near to the Red Fico war memorial.\n\nKonzum is the best supermarket in the city for variety, especially the ones in the town centre.\n\nE-scooters and bikes are easily rented and a great way to explore the city.\n\nLots of people speak great English, much better than my basic Croatian. The menus in restaurants often include English as an option. Thus is easy to get by.\n\nAccommodation & Where To Stay in Osijek Croatia\n\nThere are many options in Osijek for dog friendly places to stay. There were pet friendly options on both Airbnb and Booking.com We opted to rent an apartment for two weeks, so we had space and somewhere to cook and relax. We chose to stay at Studio Apartman Park as it was good value and had fantastic reviews.\n\nStudio Apartman Park – A Dog Friendly Apartment\n\nStudio Apartman Park is a quirky place with everything a traveller needs except for a washing machine. I easily solved the washing machine issue, as there was a launderette within walking distance. It’s nicely decorated and comfortable. The owner is friendly and helped us settle in, even inviting us out for a beer on our first night.\n\nThey were completely dog friendly and had no extra rules or charges for staying with a dog. The bar next door was dog friendly. However, before our visit, the host warned us the bar was party central on the weekends. The music was moderately loud, but nothing that prevented us sleeping. Henry wanted to visit every time we passed.\n\nThe bed was comfy, and the bedroom had great storage for an extended stay. The lighting throughout was hi-tec and controlled by remote control, as was the speaker system throughout the apartment.\n\nThe lounge area was pretty unique. It was on a balcony overlooking the bedroom and kitchen. This was a favourite spot for the dog, as he could be uber-nosey. The lounge sofa was decent and good for a nap. IT was also a good place to get some blogging done using their fast Wi-Fi.\n\nThe kitchen in the apartment had everything needed to create good meals. In fact, it was one of the best equipt kitchens we’ve stayed at.\n\nThe kitchen doubled up as a dining room, with a big piano for good measure. This was one of many quirky features at Studio Apartment Park. Overall, this was a fantastic dog friendly place to stay in Osijek.\n\nIs Osijek in Croatia Worth Visiting?\n\nIf you like off the normal tourist trail places, then Osijek is lovely. It’s also a fantastic destination for food lovers and those that appreciate the laid back coffee bar culture in Croatia. The city is undergoing regeneration, thus I expect the principal tourist attractions to be highlighted more. There are also some great options for day trips from the city, including to Vukovar, a city on the River Danube."
