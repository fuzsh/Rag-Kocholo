        "text": "Lead photo: Grad Osijek (London-Osijek-London Ryanair flight)\n\nJune 3, 2023 – The first plane of the Irish airline Ryanair on the route London-Osijek-London landed at Osijek Airport with 185 passengers. It thus started the direct route Osijek-London that will fly twice a week.\n\nAs Index writes, the largest European low-cost airline announced the direct line Osijek – London (Stansted Airport) – Osijek at the beginning of this year. The announcement marked their return to the Osijek Airport after a full seven years.\n\nFlights scheduled until October\n\nIn the summer flight schedule, Ryanair should operate between Osijek and the UK capital twice a week, on Mondays and Fridays.\n\nA B737-800 aircraft from Ryanair’s fleet with a capacity of 189 passengers will operate the route. Flights have been announced until the end of October this year, with more than 16,000 seats available. Flights are scheduled in the afternoon and evening, and can be booked through the official Ryanair website.\n\nOsijek-London ticket price\n\nThe price of the first flight from Osijek to London is promotional and costs 30 euros (226 kuna). The price of the return flight on Monday, June 5, would be 18 euros more expensive. Currently it costs 48.99 euros (369 kuna).\n\nSimon Thomas, UK Ambassador to the Republic of Croatia, attended the reception of the cabin crew and passengers on the flight from London as well as the departure of the return flight from Osijek Airport. He emphasized the already excellent friendly relations between Slavonia and Great Britain. He further stated that now there is one more thing to connect the two.\n\n“I hope it will boost tourism in both directions. The local population goes to London and the British come here to enjoy the famous Slavonian hospitality. In addition, this will promote business ties between our two countries,” said Thomas.\n\nOsijek mayor: we will continue investing in our airport\n\nOn behalf of Ryanair, the director for CEE and the Baltics, Alicja Wójcik Gołębiowska, expressed her satisfaction that their company has returned to Osijek. She added that she hopes this flight would be the first of many. She further emphasised hopes the network will expand and enable better connections for the Osijek region and Croatia.\n\nThe prefect of Osijek-Baranja, Ivan Anušić, reminded that in addition to this new line Osijek-London, there is another direct international line Osijek-Munich that has been operating for a while. Mayor Ivan Radić emphasized that Osijek-Baranja County and the City of Osijek subsidize flights to Munich and London.\n\n“As you know, we have recently had fast flights to Zagreb, Zadar, Rijeka and Dubrovnik again. We will continue to invest in our airport,” announced Radić.\n\nBy the way, in addition to Croatia Airlines’ line to the Bavarian capital Munich, this is the second international line to Osijek Airport in this year’s summer flight schedule.\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nthe fields marked with * are required"
