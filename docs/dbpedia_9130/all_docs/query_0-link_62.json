County authorities will contribute HRK 12 million and the rest is to be financed by city and municipal authorities.\n\nHe added that several capital projects are on the cards including a regional fruit and vegetable distribution centre and projects in tourism and so on.\n\nMayor Vrkic underlined that this year, Osijek was the most successful continental tourism destination.\n\nHe added that Osijek was the first city in Croatia to provide micro-computers for 5th grade pupils and that free transport was provided for all young athletes attending sports meetings in the country.\n\nHe added that this year the city administration allocated HRK 25 million for welfare programmes and next year that amount would be increased to HRK 30 million.\n\nText: Hina\n\nNews | Plenkovic Andrej"
