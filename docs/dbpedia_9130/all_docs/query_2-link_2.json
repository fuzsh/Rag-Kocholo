        "text": "Why go?\n\nSituated by the river Drava, just 20km from the Serbian border, Osijek does not have the glittering Mediterranean coastline that some people associate with Croatia. But, with a history that includes prehistoric settlements, Roman ruins and Austro-Hungarian opulence, the city certainly doesn’t lack attractions. The break-up of Yugoslavia brought war to the region, but 20 years on the city is back on its feet. Reawakened to tourism, it is ready to show off its culinary and cultural charms to the world. Get there now – before all the tourists do.\n\nWhat to do\n\nTvrda, with its crumbling Baroque architecture, old centre and medieval fort, retains an other-worldly charm. Scale the ramparts for a view across the Drava, then pop into the small art gallery below, where you’ll find an unexpectedly fascinating exhibition of shells from the world’s rarest sea creatures. Nearby, the Franciscan Church of the Elevation of the Holy Cross opens on appointment to showcase its delicate interior. In contrast, the stark yellow facade and Ottoman-inspired turrets of St Michael’s Church are best appreciated from the outside. Have a coffee in the central square, then view the Roman and neolithic finds in the Archaeology Museum and the Museum of Slavonia (mso.hr); they are positioned at opposite ends of the square. Follow Europska Avenija, lined with parkland and colourful Secessionist mansions, to the Upper Town, where the Gallery of Fine Arts (mso.hr) holds a selective collection of Croatian and international pieces. The shopping district nearby is home to the city’s towering brick cathedral, and across the street the Croatian National Theatre stages ballets and operas. Osijek is located in one of Slavonia’s wine regions, Baranja, so drive or take a taxi to one of the cellars that welcomes visitors. Belje (vinabelje.hr) will soon have a hotel on site – it produces a fascinating graševina blend made from regular and late-harvest grapes. Josic (josic.hr) has a cosy tasting bar where you could spend hours – try the cuvée, a blend of cabernet franc, cabernet sauvignon and pinot noir. Back in the centre, watch the sun set as you walk by the river or cross the pedestrian bridge for a view on high of this historic city.\n\nTravel Information\n\nTravel Information\n\nOsijek is a two-hour flight from London to Zagreb aiport, and then a two hour, 30-minute drive.\n\nGetting There\n\nCroatia Airlines (020 8563 0022, croatiaairlines.com) flies daily to Zagreb from London Heathrow and Gatwick.
