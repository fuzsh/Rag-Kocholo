        "text": "Many people automatically think of the coast and summer vacation while basking in the warm Adriatic sun when they think of Croatia. But that is only a part of Croatia!\n\nThere are so many parts of this beautiful country that deserve more attention and recognition, and Slavonia might be the first of that kind. Eastern region of Croatia is like a magical golden river made of endless wheatfields and the most friendly people you could imagine.\n\nAnd this region has its capital that hides so many amazing stuff to see- Osijek!\n\nA city that is largest and most populated in the region lies on the Drava river and is definitely a place to see before this area becomes more and more popular, and that might be soon!\n\nSo, where to start with Osijek?\n\nIn the old age here was the Celtic and Roman city of Mursa. For the first time in history, the name of the town in the Hungarian version Eszek is mentioned in 1196, and the Germans call it Esseg. During the Middle Ages at the time of the Croatian-Hungarian kingdom, Osijek lived as a wealthy trading and craft town, and in the summer of 1526, it was conquered by soldiers of the mighty Ottoman (Turkish) empire.\n\nSince the end of the 17th century, Osijek has been returned to Croatia as part of the Habsburg (Austro-Hungarian) empire. A great fortress was built along the river Drava; the city was restored in baroque style. In the 19th century, Osijek experienced a great economic and cultural flourishing. The building of the Croatian National Theater, the County Palace, the St. Catherine’s Cathedral was built.\n\nHistory of Osijek followed the history of Croatia in the 20thcentury and all the changes of the government that happened after the very bad times during World War II and in socialism.\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, the horrors of previous wars were a far-reaching past that can never be repeated. The city lived full of lungs, changed and became more open; the future seemed better than ever before. Unfortunately, in 1991, Osijek was attacked again. With the proclamation of independence in Croatia, the military units of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia entered Osijek. The city has been devastated for months, but its inhabitants at all times of the war tried to live as if peace was “already tomorrow”. Osijek then once for all showed that it would remain, as well as the most famous city graphite, saying, “The unbowed city”!"
