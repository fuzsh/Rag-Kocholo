        "text": "I stared at the strip of fried carp – long and wiggly like an eel’s tail. Well, if it’s good enough for the King…\n\nIt turned out to be delicious. I enjoyed it with a soundtrack of jolly folk music and the background of a rustic, craft-jumble-sale looking restaurant.\n\nWith the décor and golden-field landscape outside the window, I could easily have imagined myself in Hungary, Poland or Slovenia. But I was in eastern Croatia, in the region of Osijek-Baranja (historically known as Slavonia), a three-hour drive east from the capital Zagreb and close to the Serbian border.\n\nAs most tourists in Croatia zip straight to the island-speckled Adriatic coast, inland regions such as this receive only around three per cent of international visits.\n\nThe area is completely different – in culture, cuisine and landscape – from the seaside and practically unknown to Britons. Except among our Royal Family.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II visited in 1972 to see the Lipizzaner horses bred for dressage and carriage-racing at the 518-year-old State Stud Farm in Đakovo, a town in central Slavonia.\n\nThe royal connections don’t end there. The late Queen’s great-grandfather Franz, Duke of Teck, was born and christened in Osijek – the regional capital – while the esteemed local Traminac wine was served at her coronation and has been repeatedly ordered by the Windsors (including for both William and Catherine and Harry and Meghan’s weddings).\n\nThe region has just become easier to reach too – in April, Ryanair launched the only direct UK flight that will run throughout the summer to the end of October.\n\nMy partner and I arrived to a scene of glowing sunflower and corn fields. Because of its rich, fertile soil, Slavonia attracted a parade of princes and dukes when it was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, who came to set up agricultural estates and vineyards. Many of their grand castles and manors still dot the landscape.\n\nAs soon as we arrived in Osijek’s cobbled old town, we grabbed city rental bikes for €0.66 (56p) per 30 minutes (nextbike.hr) and began our tour. As we pedalled along the mighty Drava River, locals were swimming to cool off from the 35°C summer heat. We stopped at the Cathedral of St Peter and St Paul (as Charles and Camilla did on their 2016 visit), and swooned at the art nouveau mansions wrapped in tangles of wild roses and ivy along Europska avenija (European Avenue).\n\nBack in the old town, we meandered around faded baroque revival buildings – even more charming for their peeling state and the fact the streets were almost devoid of people in peak summer (when nearly everyone is by the sea).\n\nPrices were extremely reasonable too: €3 (£2.55) for a pint at General Von Becker’s, one of Osijek’s many craft breweries, and €62 per night for our modest, but perfectly comfortable, room at Hotel Maksimilian in the heart of the old town.\n\n“Food, drinks and accommodation cost probably half as much here as they would by the coast,” guide, Renata Forjan, told us. The region is also known for nature. The highlight is Kopacki rit Nature Park, one of Europe’s largest wetlands, which is home to more than 300 types of birds as well as beavers, otters and jackals.\n\nAround a 20-minute drive from Osijek (€20 in a taxi), Kopacki rit is a mosaic of lakes, ponds and marshes. You can’t explore on foot, so we jumped onto a boat tour (€12pp; pp-kopacki-rit.hr), gawping at trees with so many cormorants in the branches they looked like dangling fruit and cooing as we caught a glimpse of one of the park’s white-tailed eagles.\n\nAfterwards we stopped for lunch at Baranjska kuca, where I conquered my carp aversion. Mains cost a wallet-friendly €11.\n\nStanko Skrobo – whose family runs the restaurant and attached accommodation – showed us the “Street of Forgotten Time”, a row of wooden huts representing different craftsmen’s workshops, set up as they would have been 100 or so years ago.\n\nEverywhere we went, I experienced a sense of peace, homeliness and authenticity. And while residents spoke English, everyone seemed to be Croat.\n\nWhile agriculture remains a key industry in Slavonia, residents are increasingly opening up to tourists with accommodation and food offerings on their farms and vineyards.\n\nThis year the region also welcomed its first higher end accommodation, Hotel Materra, on the edge of Osijek. Despite its modernist architecture and glossy spa, Materra remains connected to its agricultural heritage, serving wines and other regional produce (the owner is a farmer in the area and much comes from his land) and built using local materials.\n\nWe relaxed in the sauna, looking through the window at the expanse of fields from which the melting pork in our pasta lunch in Materra’s restaurant had almost certainly come.\n\nThe trip ended with a final glass of aromatic grasevina – Slavonia’s best-known white wine. It wasn’t Queen Elizabeth’s local favourite, I thought, but it’ll certainly do."
