        "text": "Osijek is cultural-educational, administrative and economic center of the region and also, the capital of Osjeï¿½ko-baranjska County.\n\nOsijek, the capital and the biggest town of Slavonia, is situated on the right side of the river Drava, 22 km from its mouth into the Danube. The slightly higher right side, safe from flood, well adjusted crossing over the Drava, and swamp countryside, were a safe shelter even in prehistoric age. On the area of current town there are several archeologic sites of different prehistoric ages and cultures, from younger stone age, copper age, bronze age up to iron age.\n\nAlthough the area of Osijek has been settled since the prehistory, the first urban settlement was built by the Romans. The numerous archeological sites, together with objects that have natural, historic and art values, are kept in Slavonian Museum in Osijek, established in 1877.\n\nHappenings end events in Osijek"
