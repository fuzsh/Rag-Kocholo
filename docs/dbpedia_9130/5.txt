Osijek – Baranja County Download as PDF Add to basket

Osijek-Baranja County is situated in the northeast of the Republic of Croatia, in a predominantly flat area around the lower course of the Drava River to its confluence with the Danube. The county extends from Donji Miholjac and Našice in the west to Erdut in the east, and from the Croatian-Hungarian border in the north to Brod-Posavina County and Vukovar-Srijem County in the south. It covers a few large regions – Baranja in the northeast, Podravina and the Našice region in the west and the Đakovo region in the south.

The county covers an area of 4,155 km2 and has 263 settlements with a total population of 259,481. In terms of legal status, it is a regional self-government unit, administratively divided into seven cities/towns and 35 municipalities. The City of Osijek is the county’s industrial, administrative, academic, legal, health, sports and cultural centre, the largest city in Slavonia and the fourth largest city in Croatia.

Osijek-Baranja County has an extremely favourable position in terms of geostrategy and traffic, with a well-developed road and railway infrastructure (1,700 km of roads and 180 km of railways) and transport corridors. The Pan-European Corridor Vc connects Central Europe with the Adriatic Sea, while the A5 motorway, connecting directly to the A3, connects the county with Zagreb, the Croatian capital. The Danube, the Drava and ports in Osijek, Batina and Aljmaš are part of the network of European rivers. Osijek Airport is an international regional airport, located 20 km away from Osijek. The excellent road and railway infrastructure as well as the vicinity of the Drava, the Danube and river ports give the Osijek Airport enormous potential for the transport of goods and services.

Rich and well-preserved natural resources, high-quality soil (260,778 hectares of arable land), water supplies and a moderate continental climate make this area very suitable for agriculture. Farming and livestock breeding, vegetable farming, fruit farming and viticulture are well-developed. Osijek-Baranja County is rich in thermal waters and various types of wood, including oak, ash, beech, poplar and other. Numerous irrigation systems are being developed in the county and the construction of the Osijek-Baranja County Regional Fruit and Vegetable Distribution Centre is nearly completed, with the latter aiming to ensure the infrastructure required for receiving and trading in agricultural products intended particularly for small farmers.

Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, founded in 1975, is the third oldest and largest Croatian university. There are 17 components operating as part of the University, including the Faculty of Economics, Faculty of Agrobiotechnical Sciences, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Information Technology, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Faculty of Food Technology, Faculty of Law, Academy of Arts and Culture and others. Excellent structure of education, availability of formal education and networking with scientific and research institutions are the comparative advantages of this area.

Osijek-Baranja County is the capital of continental tourism in Croatia. Its unique tourist offer gives visitors an opportunity to enjoy cultural, active, gastronomy and ethnic, religious, medical and cycling tourism. It has a perfect combination of nature, intangible cultural heritage, rural life and memorable food and ethnic experiences, blending into a unique tourist product that all visitors appreciate, recognise and keep returning to. Kopački Rit Nature Park, a world-renowned nature reserve and a wetland home to over 2,300 biological and 300 bird species, is a true pearl of eastern Croatia’s natural heritage.

Agriculture and the food industry are the most important economic sectors leading the development of Osijek-Baranja County. However, the tourist sector, which has enormous potential, has also received great attention and experienced accelerated growth in recent years. When it comes to the county’s development, special emphasis is placed on green transition and digital transformation, environmental impact minimisation, climate change mitigation and implementation of new technological systems in all parts of social and business life.

The economy of Osijek-Baranja County is dominated by the processing industry, especially the food processing industry, characterised by the availability of raw materials and processing capacities as well as a long-standing tradition of production. The metal, chemical, wood and paper industry are also well-developed, just like agriculture, civil engineering, trade and tourism. The ICT industry is thriving particularly in Osijek. The county’s economic activity is dominated by micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises.

Entrepreneurial zones are the core of economic growth and development. In about 30 zones across the county, which are equipped with the necessary infrastructure, entrepreneurs can be given favourable business conditions, such as free or subsidised land, reduced municipal contribution or even full exemption from municipal contribution payment. The county has also developed a network of business support institutions, particularly business centres, incubators and accelerators. The construction of the Economic Centre in Osijek is almost complete as well and its goal is to develop a new business infrastructure and increase economic activities, with a focus on business events, fairs and conferences.

Osijek-Baranja County is a favourable location for domestic and foreign investment. The County Administration is competent for providing expert and administrative support to all potential investors. It can also ensure cooperation and networking with all competent institutions, making it possible for investments to be realised more efficiently and quickly. The creation of a stimulating business environment via regional and state support measures increases the competitiveness of this area and builds an excellent foundation for sustainable growth and development.
