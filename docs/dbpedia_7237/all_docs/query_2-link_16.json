Now, years later, his cover is cracked and B ryson learns that The Directorate was not what it claimed -- that he was, i n fact, a pawn being used against his country's interests. The Directorate is headed for a dangerous endgame, and the CIA recruits Bryson to stop them . But after years on the sidelines, Bryson's field skills are rusty, his co ntacts unreliable, his instincts suspect, and he no longer knows who - if a nyone - can be trusted."
