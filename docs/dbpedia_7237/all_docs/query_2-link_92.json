        "text": "Miami - Suspense writer Robert Ludlum, the prolific author of \"The Scarlatti Inheritance\" and other complex spy thrillers that routinely topped bestseller lists, died on Monday in Naples, Florida after suffering a massive heart attack, a family spokesperson said. He was 73 years old.\n\nLudlum, a master of the Cold War espionage genre whose novels sold more than 220 million copies in 40 countries and 32 languages, had recently had heart surgery and appeared to be making good progress until the heart attack.\n\n\"I can confirm that Robert Ludlum passed away today of cardiac arrest,'' said Debbie Curry, a spokesperson for Naples Community Hospital where Ludlum was taken from his home.\n\nBorn in New York City on May 25, 1927, Ludlum was raised in Short Hills, New Jersey and left home as a teenager to act on stage. He studied at Wesleyan University, where he met his future wife, Mary Ryducha. They had three children.\n\nHe worked as an actor and theatre producer for 20 years before turning to spy novel writing as a lark, wondering at age 40 if he could have any success at it.\n\nHis first book, \"The Scarlatti Inheritance\" in 1971, was an instant hit and it was followed by many others including \"The Osterman Weekend\", \"The Matlock Paper\", \"The Matarese Circle\", \"The Parsifal Mosaic\" and \"The Apocalypse Watch\".\n\nIn an online question-and-answer session with fans on Barnes&Noble.com in November 1997, Ludlum said he still wrote longhand on a yellow pad of paper. \"I'm of the old-fashioned type who can make money writing from planes, trains or jail,\" he said.\n\nLudlum said he usually spent about three months researching a book and about 15 months writing it.\n\n\"Most of it is whatever minor imagination I have, and the travelling I do with my wife,\" he said. \"It's nothing magical, but I simply love telling stories.\"\n\nOne of his most popular characters was Jason Bourne, a world-travelling adventurer featured in 1980's \"The Bourne Identity\", \"The Bourne Supremacy\" in 1986 and \"The Bourne Ultimatum\" in 1990.\n\n\"The Bourne Identity\" is headed for big-screen release by Universal Pictures later this year with a cast led by Matt Damon.\n\nLudlum published two novels, \"Trevayne\" in 1973 and \"The Cry of the Halidon\" in 1974, under the name Jonathan Ryder. They were ultimately re-released under the Ludlum name.\n\nIn interviews Ludlum often said his theatrical training helped him to set up scenes and plot complicated books that the reader enjoyed the way he might a good show.\n\nAlthough occasionally criticised for aping the styles of fellow thriller writers John Le Carre and Tom Clancy, Ludlum's popularity was unquestioned and he was a staple of airport bookstore reading racks.\n\nSteve Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive and one of the world's richest men, named Ludlum as his favourite author in a published interview.\n\nLudlum's latest book, \"The Prometheus Deception\", his 22nd novel, was published last year and appeared this year on the New York Times, Los Angeles Times and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists.\n\nA typically convoluted Cold War tale, \"The Prometheus Deception\" has retired hero Nicholas Bryson infiltrating his former shadow agency to halt a scheme to stockpile weapons for use against the United States in a plot for world domination.\n\n\"In terms of style, the Ludlum hallmarks of ham-fisted clich√©, risible dialogue and the scattergun use of italics and exclamation marks all are happily in evidence,\" The Express newspaper in Britain wrote in a book review recently.\n\nThe novel was published in the United States by St Martin's Press, which lured Ludlum away from Bantam Books after more than 20 years with a lucrative multi-book publishing deal two years ago. Ludlum was to receive $4 million per book, according to published reports."
