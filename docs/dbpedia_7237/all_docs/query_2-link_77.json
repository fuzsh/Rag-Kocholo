        "text": "Robert Ludlum (May 25, 1927 – March 12, 2001) was an American author of 27 thriller novels. The number of copies of his books in print is estimated between 290 million and 500 million.[2][3][4] They have been published in 33 languages and 40 countries. Ludlum also published books under the pseudonyms Jonathan Ryder and Michael Shepherd.[5]\n\nContents[]\n\n[hide] *1 Life and career\n\n1.1 Writing analysis and criticism\n\n2 Selected bibliography\n\n2.1 By Ludlum, published during the author's lifetime\n\n2.2 Credited to Ludlum, published posthumously\n\n2.3 Covert-One series\n\n2.4 Janson series\n\n2.5 Sequels to Ludlum books\n\n3 Filmography\n\n4 See also\n\n5 References\n\n6 External links\n\nLife and career[edit][]\n\nLudlum was born in New York City, the son of Margaret (née Wadsworth) and George Hartford Ludlum.[6] His maternal grandparents were English.[7] He was educated at The Rectory Schoolthen Cheshire Academy and Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. While at Wesleyan, Ludlum joined the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity. After becoming an author later in life, Ludlum would set his mystery novel Matlock Paper at the fictitious Carlyle University in Connecticut, a thinly-disguised Wesleyan.[8][9]\n\nPrior to becoming an author, he had been a United States Marine,[10][11] a theatrical actor and producer. His theatrical experience may have contributed to his understanding of the energy, escapism and action that the public wanted in a novel. He once remarked: \"I equate suspense and good theater in a very similar way. I think it's all suspense and what-happens-next. From that point of view, yes, I guess, I am theatrical.\"[12] Many of Ludlum's novels have been made into films and mini-series, including The Osterman Weekend, The Holcroft Covenant, The Apocalypse Watch, The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum. Covert One: The Hades Factor, a book co-written with Gayle Lynds, was originally conceived as a mini-series; the book evolved from a short treatment Ludlum wrote for NBC. The Bourne movies, starring Matt Damon in the title role, have been commercially and critically successful (The Bourne Ultimatum won three Academy Awards in 2008), although the story lines depart significantly from the source material.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Ludlum lived in Leonia, New Jersey, where he spent hours each day writing in his home.[13]\n\nLudlum died on March 12, 2001, at his home in Naples, Florida, whilst recovering from severe burns caused by a mysterious fire which occurred on February 10.[14][15][16]\n\nWriting analysis and criticism[edit][]\n\nLudlum's novels typically feature one heroic man, or a small group of crusading individuals, in a struggle against powerful adversaries whose intentions and motivations are evil and who are capable of using political and economic mechanisms in frightening ways. The world in his writings is one where global corporations, shadowy military forces and government organizations all conspire to preserve (if it is good) or undermine (if it is evil) the status quo.\n\nLudlum's novels were often inspired by conspiracy theories, both historical and contemporary. He wrote that The Matarese Circle was inspired by rumors about the Trilateral Commission, and it was published only a few years after the commission was founded. His depictions of terrorism in books such as The Holcroft Covenant and The Matarese Circle reflected the theory that terrorists, rather than being merely isolated bands of ideologically motivated extremists, are actually pawns of governments or private organizations who are using them to facilitate the establishment of authoritarian rule.\n\nLudlum used the same fixed titling pattern of The [Proper Noun] [Noun] (where the proper noun functions as a noun adjunct) for most of his books. Subsequent to his death, books written by other authors have carried the phrase Robert LudlumTM on their covers, thus asserting the name Robert Ludlum as a trademark.[citation needed] The actual author (not technically a ghost writer) is identified inside.[citation needed]\n\nSelected bibliography[edit][]\n\nBy Ludlum, published during the author's lifetime[edit][]\n\nThe Scarlatti Inheritance (1971)\n\nThe Osterman Weekend (1972)\n\nThe Matlock Paper (1973)\n\nTrevayne (1973, writing under the pen-name Jonathan Ryder)\n\nThe Cry of the Halidon (1974, writing under the pen-name Jonathan Ryder)\n\nThe Rhinemann Exchange (1974)\n\nThe Road to Gandolfo (1975, writing under the pen-name Michael Shepherd)\n\nThe Gemini Contenders (1976)\n\nThe Chancellor Manuscript (1977)\n\nThe Holcroft Covenant (1978)\n\nThe Matarese Circle (1979)\n\nThe Bourne Identity (1980)\n\nThe Parsifal Mosaic (1982)\n\nThe Aquitaine Progression (1984)\n\nThe Bourne Supremacy (1986)\n\nThe Icarus Agenda (1988)\n\nThe Bourne Ultimatum (1990)\n\nThe Road to Omaha (1992)\n\nThe Scorpio Illusion (1993)\n\nThe Apocalypse Watch (1995)\n\nThe Matarese Countdown (1997)\n\nThe Prometheus Deception (2000)\n\nCredited to Ludlum, published posthumously[edit][]\n\nThe Sigma Protocol (2001, the last novel written entirely by Ludlum)\n\nThe Janson Directive (2002)\n\nThe Tristan Betrayal (2003)\n\nThe Ambler Warning (2005)\n\nThe Bancroft Strategy (2006)\n\nCovert-One series[edit][]\n\nMain article: Covert-One series\n\nWritten by other authors.\n\nThe Hades Factor (by Gayle Lynds) (2000)\n\nThe Cassandra Compact (by Philip Shelby) (2001)\n\nThe Paris Option (by Gayle Lynds) (2002)\n\nThe Altman Code (by Gayle Lynds) (2003)\n\nThe Lazarus Vendetta (by Patrick Larkin) (2004)\n\nThe Moscow Vector (by Patrick Larkin) (2005)\n\nThe Arctic Event (by James H.
