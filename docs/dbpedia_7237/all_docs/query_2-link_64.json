        "text": "Untethered Heroism; Deception Reimagined A Literary Analysis on Prometheus Bound\n\nWhen does kindness extend to Heroism? On what grounds does one consider heroism in the face of disobedience and deception? The play Prometheus Bound written by Aeschylus who was a Greek tragedian wrote the play at the height of his career at Athens in the early 5th century B. Only seven of the 76 plays that are attributed to him have been preserved which then includes Prometheus Bound. The literary piece pressed in this analysis is entitled Prometheus bound. Some may find a different version of this literary piece but the one I used is the common piece found in the mainstream educational resources. In Greek mythology, One of the titans that Zeus banished to Tartarus because he couldn't accept the titans battling against him in the famed Battle of the Titans, also known as the Titanomachy, was Prometheus. Zeus sent Prometheus to Tartarus at some point in time. Prometheus, on the other hand, was not personally involved in the conflict; therefore, Zeus rescued him from Tartarus and tasked him with the endeavor of creating a man from earth and water. Prometheus was successful in completing the assignment, but while he was working on his invention, he developed a preference for men. He didn't care much about the Gods or the order in which they were arranged, and despite the fact that they were nice to him, he felt much more at ease when he was around immortals. Zeus' intention was not to endow mortals with exceptional levels of power.\n\nBut Prometheus began heading in the opposite direction, and he made the decision to steal fire, which was one of the attributes that Zeus was especially frightened about. The story of Prometheus and his the of fire from Zeus prompts us to ponder on the query of what would have happened to humanity if Prometheus had not done what he did? If this were true, then should this action become a deal breaker between the authority and its subject. However, the wayward Titan from Greek mythology was the one who stole it, and even though mankind praised him for his deed, the God who rules over all gods exacted a severe punishment on him. Despite the fact that this was not the first time that Prometheus conned Zeus chained Prometheus to the rock where the eagle was to consume his endlessly replenished liver every day because the Mighty God believed that this act committed by Prometheus was one of the most heinous crimes ever committed. But as the story progresses and present in the rational mind we find ourselves questioning that the story of Prometheus and Zeus did not conclude with the imposition of that penalty. Is the penalty for Prometheus an adamant one to exclude him of his greatness towards his creations? Or is it merely an act of deception towards the gods? To open the analysis, it is important to break down the roles played by Prometheus in accordance with his actions and his act of becoming a hero and a mere thief. Prometheus as a hero. The story of Prometheus, as it was originally told, can be understood to suggest that there is good and evil to be found in human life. (In addition to being a hero to humanity, Prometheus is also a prankster.) As a result of his work as an advocate for humanity, the educated population of Athens held him in high regard. In addition to this, he is a representation of the shi that took place in Greek civilization away from a dependence on the gods and toward a more autonomous (and possibly unsettling) existence. The increase of atheism in Athenian culture necessitated a more complex mythology, which led to Aeschylus' later presentation of the Prometheus tale. It illustrates a system in which supernatural forces impact events, but mortals still have to contend with the environment in which they live. This effort then to promote the tail of Prometheus is the Ancient Greeks way to provide an explanation for how humans first acquired fire given by the hero they considered, Prometheus. Although he is\n\nassigned Prometheus and Epimetheus the task of giving the gis that would ensure the survival of mankind and other creatures, Zeus's punishment of Prometheus was unjust and should not have been carried out. To conclude this analysis, it is important that we seek to act towards its trajectory. Throughout the analysis, it is found that the heroism in Prometheus Bound must be treated in a reimagined manner. We may have condemned the act of stealing but the intention lies on the surface that the creation of Prometheus were the ones at stake in Zeusâ€™ cruelty and injustice. So does this make Prometheus a hero? Yes. Heroism may be found in different lenses and different sources but it is always meeting the ends of the intention that we find the answer to this question. Prometheus is a hero, bounded by the injustice of a god."
