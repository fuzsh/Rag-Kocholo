        "text": "Robert Ludlum, the author of best-selling suspense novels like ''The Bourne Identity'' and ''The Matarese Circle,'' died here today. He was 73 and lived in Naples.\n\nThe cause of death was believed to have been a heart attack, said Matthew Shear, a spokesman for Mr. Ludlum's publisher, St. Martin's Press.\n\n''It's a horrible loss for all of his fans and for his publisher,'' Mr. Shear said. ''Fortunately, he had been working on several books, and to honor him we're going to continue to publish him.''\n\nReaders can expect at least three more novels, Mr. Shear said.\n\nMr. Ludlum started his career in the theater, working as an actor and a producer until he published his first book, ''The Scarlatti Inheritance,'' in 1971. That best-selling novel, about a group that financed the Third Reich, was followed by 20 novels. The novels sold more than 110 million copies.\n\nGovernment secrets and corruption were a recurring theme in his spy adventures, which were known for unbelievable twists and turns that kept readers turning pages and critics sometimes rolling their eyes.\n\nA critic for The Washington Post once said: ''It's a lousy book. So I stayed up until 3 a.m. to finish it.''\n\nIn ''The Chancellor Manuscript,'' Mr. Ludlum fictionalized J. Edgar Hoover's death, unraveling an assassination plot.\n\nOne of his most popular series began with ''The Bourne Identity,'' which tells the tale of a spy suffering from amnesia who is hunted by assassins. The spy, Jason Bourne, repeatedly escaped death, leaving himself and readers guessing why he would be the target of killers.\n\nTwo other novels followed in the series: ''The Bourne Supremacy'' and ''The Bourne Ultimatum.''\n\nAfter his first two novels, Mr. Ludlum wrote ''The Matlock Paper'' and ''Trevayne'' under the pen name Jonathan Ryder. In 1974, he published ''The Rhineman Exchange'' as Michael Shepherd."
