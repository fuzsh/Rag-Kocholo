        "text": "Nicholas Bryson spent years as a deep cover operative for the American secret intelligence group, The Directorate. After a disastrous mission, Bryson was retired to a new identity.\n\nNow, years later, his cover is cracked and Bryson learns that The Directorate was not what it claimed - and that he was, in fact, a pawn being used against his countryâs interests.\n\nThe Directorate is headed for a dangerous endgame and the CIA recruits Bryson to stop them. But after years on the sidelines, Brysonâs field skills are rusty, his contacts unreliable, his instincts suspect and he no longer knows who - if anyone - can be trusted."
