        "text": "Eric Stoltz is a theater-trained actor and producer who has starred in both independent and studio films. He was born on September 30, and is of Irish, German and Scottish ancestry. Eric was raised in both American Samoa and Santa Barbara, California, where by the age of fourteen, he was earning money by playing piano for the local musical theater productions, including \"Mame\" starring Anthony Edwards, whom he co-starred with as Jeff Spicoli's stoner friends in Ich glaub' ich steh' im Wald (1982). The two became friends, and then college roommates when both attended the University of Southern California. Dropping out in his junior year, Eric joined a repertory company that did 10 plays at the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland. Moving to New York in 1981, he studied with Stella Adler and Peggy Feury, and soon appeared in his first film, Ich glaub' ich steh' im Wald (1982). In the 1980s, he garnered attention (and a Golden Globe Award nomination) starring as Rocky Dennis in Die Maske (1985), and in John Hughes' Ist sie nicht Wunderbar (1987). In 1988, he made his Broadway debut in Our Town (1989), for which he was nominated for a Tony Award.\n\nIn the 1990s, he went back and forth from stage to film, building up an eclectic resume that included studio films (Pulp Fiction (1994)), independent films (Sundance Festival Winner Waterdance (1992)), and films that he himself produced (Mr. Jealousy (1997)). He also continued to appear on the New York stage both on Broadway (\"Three Sisters\", \"Two Shakespearean Actors\") and off-Broadway (\"The Importance of Being Ernest\", \"The Glass Menagerie\"). He continued to work in television as well, doing a recurring role as Helen Hunt's ex on Verrückt nach dir (1992), a year on Chicago Hope: Endstation Hoffnung (1994), and in the television and cable movies Im Angesicht der Freiheit (1996) (directed by Arthur Penn), Ein Killer in der Familie (1983) (with Robert Mitchum) and Ayn Rand - Leben und Liebe für die Literatur (1999) (with Dame Helen Mirren). Since 2002, he has concentrated mainly on directing, having done a television movie, several short films, several independent films, and television series such as Grey's Anatomy: Die jungen Ärzte (2005), Boston Legal (2004), Nashville (2012) and Glee (2009). In 2014, he became the producing director of the CBS drama series, Madam Secretary (2014).\n\nHis low-keyed intensity, deep-voiced somberness, pale skin, puffy-eyed baby face and crop of carrot-red hair are all obvious and intriguing trademarks of TV star David Caruso. A hugely popular item in the 1990s as a result of a smash crime series, he got way too caught up in all the hoopla surrounding him. Those working with him on the innovative cop series were not exactly unhappy when he decided to abandon ship after only one season in order to pursue movie star fame. Despite his own predictions, the show prospered quite well after the loss of his focal character...but it would be a major understatement to state that Caruso did not fare as well.\n\nTV to film crossover fame is tricky and David did not have the right formula to pull it off. Bad judgment calls, bad publicity after his departure from his TV series, a couple of poor film vehicles, and virtual unemployment in its wake eventually led him back to the small screen again a somewhat humbler person. Not many are given a second chance but Caruso, the enigmatic talent that he is, found gold a second time as (again) a wan, brooding lead in a hip, unconventional cop series.\n\nDavid Stephen Caruso was born in Forest Hills, Queens, New York, the son of Charles Caruso, a magazine and newspaper editor, and Joan, a librarian. The Irish Catholic youngster attended elementary and middle school at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs and then Archbishop Molloy High School, both in Queens.\n\nFollowing high school graduation in 1974, he toyed with some commercial work. A few years later he began to make a slight dent in films. He first appeared in Getting Wasted (1980) and Alien Shock (1980), which led to a succession of secondary roles in such 80s movies as Ein Offizier und Gentleman (1982), Rambo (1982) (as a sheriff's deputy), Nachts werden Träume wahr (1984), Blue City (1986), Krieg in Chinatown (1987) and Twins - Zwillinge (1988). But the break into full-fledged TV stardom proved elusive. It was argued that the thin and lanky actor was not handsome enough to become a leading man in film and didn't have the charisma credentials to carry a big movie.\n\nMaking his unbilled debut in a daytime episode of \"Ryan's Hope\", TV proved to be a more inviting medium and police stories seemed to be the name of the game for him. He had a strong recurring role as a gang leader on Polizeirevier Hill Street (1981) and showed to good advantage in the series Crime Story (1986). This sudden notoriety on police TV gave way to some even stronger stuff in streetwise film crimers such as King of New York (1990) as a cop gone bad, and Sein Name ist Mad Dog (1993), in which he earned excellent marks as a cynical urban cop. But his star-making role came via TV and his portrayal of Detective John Kelly the critically-acclaimed series New York Cops: NYPD Blue (1993). Audience adoration was immediate.\n\nHis volatile but principled character on the gritty, boldly-written, unconventional show earned him impressive and sexy notices with a Golden Globe Award and Emmy nomination placed in his hands. Confident now that he could be a magnetic force in front of a movie camera, stories began to circulate that the instant fame had gone to his head, that he was moody, demanding and difficult on the set, and that he was quickly alienating not only his co-stars but the show's directors and writers.\n\nReady to prove all those naysayers wrong about his chances in film, Caruso made tabloid headlines when he announced his decision to leave the highly-rated show after only one season (and only four episodes into the second season) to pursue film stardom. Rumors also bounced around that he left following unresolved salary negotiations. For whatever reason, he wasted no time in scouting out movie vehicles for himself. Again, he focused on his specialty -- crime thrillers. The first, Kiss of Death (1995), in which he played a petty thief trying to go straight, did not go over well box-office-wise despite its good reviews, and the second, Jade (1995), in which he portrayed a homicide detective, was a grisly, unappetizing thriller that was given the thumbs down almost immediately. As a comeuppance for coming up short, he was nominated for the dubious \"Razzie\" award as the \"Worst New Star\" of those two films. With no movie releases at all in 1996, by the time The Hunt (1997) was released, in which he played a jewel thief who is betrayed by his sexy partner-in-crime (Kelly Lynch), the TV star had lost all of his movie star momentum.\n\nIn 1997, Caruso made an inauspicious return to the small screen as the placid title prosecutor Michael Hayes - Für Recht und Gerechtigkeit (1997), a law series, but it was a very short-lived experience. Audiences had become fickle and indifferent to his \"heralded comeback\". Finding a serious lack of offers, he returned to supporting others in films such as Russell Crowe in Lebenszeichen - Proof of Life (2000), and copped a couple of leads for himself in such low-budgeted films as Session 9 (2001) and the Canadian film Black Point (2002).\n\nBut in 2002, he found TV magic once again behind a badge as Lt. Horatio Caine in the popular CSI spin-off series CSI: Miami (2002). Strongly anchoring the show, which focuses more on crime methodology and whodunnit twists than character development, Caruso has nevertheless earned cult fame for his slick demeanor and deliberately slow speech patterns, reminding one of William Shatner's heady, methodical approach to Captain Kirk. Known for his deep, dry tones and parade of droll one-liners, many of which include him slipping on his dark shades during mid-sentence, he has been the subject of many a late-nite parody and satire.\n\nA difficult interviewee who has admitted to keeping his monumental ego in check since his return to TV, he has been little seen since the \"Miami\" series ended in 2012 after ten season. David has been married and divorced three times, which includes a brief 1980s union to actress Rachel Ticotin. He has a daughter, Greta, from that union. On the sly, Caruso was a co-owner of now long-defunct Steam, a clothing and furniture store in Miami, Florida. He and his current girlfriend (since 2005), Liza Marquez, have two children -- son Marquez Anthony and and daughter, Paloma Raquel.\n\nAcademy Award-winning filmmaker Ron Howard is one of this generation's most popular directors. From the critically acclaimed dramas A Beautiful Mind: Genie und Wahnsinn (2001) and Apollo 13 (1995) to the hit comedies Eine Wahnsinnsfamilie (1989) and Splash: Jungfrau am Haken (1983), he has created some of Hollywood's most memorable films.\n\nHoward made his directorial debut in 1978 with the comedy Gib Gas... und laßt euch nicht erwischen (1977). He began his career in film as an actor. He first appeared in Die Reise (1959) and Music Man (1962), then as Opie on the long-running television series The Andy Griffith Show (1960). Howard later starred in the popular series Happy Days (1974) and drew favorable reviews for his performances in American Graffiti (1973) and Der Scharfschütze (1976).\n\nHoward and long-time producing partner Brian Grazer first collaborated on the hit comedies \"Night Shift\" and \"Splash.\" The pair co-founded Imagine Entertainment in 1986 to create independently produced feature films.\n\nHoward's portfolio includes some of the most popular films of the past 20 years. In 1991, Howard created the acclaimed drama \"Backdraft\", starring Robert De Niro, Kurt Russell and William Baldwin. He followed it with the historical epic In einem fernen Land (1992), starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Howard directed Mel Gibson, Rene Russo, Gary Sinise and Delroy Lindo in the 1996 suspense thriller Kopfgeld - Einer wird bezahlen (1996). Howard worked with Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Ed Harris, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise and Kathleen Quinlan on \"Apollo 13,\" which was re-released recently in the IMAX format.\n\nHoward's skill as a director has long been recognized. In 1995, he received his first Best Director of the Year award from the DGA for \"Apollo 13.\" The true-life drama also garnered nine Academy Award nominations, winning Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Sound. It also received Best Ensemble Cast and Best Supporting Actor awards from the Screen Actor's Guild. Many of Howard's past films have received nods from the Academy, including the popular hits Backdraft - Männer, die durchs Feuer gehen (1991), \"Parenthood\" and Cocoon (1985), the last of which took home two Oscars.\n\nHoward directed and produced Das Comeback (2005) starring Oscar winner Russell Crowe, with whom he previously collaborated on \"A Beautiful Mind,\" for which Howard earned an Oscar for Best Director and which also won awards for Best Picture, Best Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress. The film garnered four Golden Globes as well, including the award for Best Motion Picture Drama. Additionally, Howard won Best Director of the Year from the Directors Guild of America. Howard and producer Brian Grazer received the first annual Awareness Award from the National Mental Health Awareness Campaign for their work on the film.\n\nHoward was honored by the Museum of Moving Images in December 2005, and by the American Cinema Editors in February 2006. Howard and his creative partner Brian Grazer, were honored by the Producers Guild of America with the Milestone Award in January 2009, NYU's Tisch School of Cinematic Arts with the Big Apple Award in November 2009 and by the Simon Wiesenthal Center with their Humanitarian Award in May 2010. In June 2010, Howard was honored by the Chicago Film Festival with their Gold Hugo - Career Achievement Award. In March 2013, Howard was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame. In December 2015, Howard was honored with a star in the Motion Pictures category, making him one of the very few to have been recognized with two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nHoward also produced and directed the film adaptation of Peter Morgan's critically acclaimed play Frost/Nixon (2008). The film was nominated for five Academy Awards including Best Picture, and was also nominated for The Darryl F. Zanuck Producer of the Year Award in Theatrical Motion Pictures by the PGA.\n\nHoward has also served as an executive producer on a number of award-winning films and television shows, such as the HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon (1998), Fox's Emmy Award winner for Best Comedy, Arrested Development (2003), a series which he also narrated, Netflix's release of new episodes of \"Arrested Development,\" and NBC's \"Parenthood.\"\n\nHoward's recent films include the critically acclaimed drama Rush: Alles für den Sieg (2013), staring Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl, written by Peter Morgan; and Made in America (2013), a music documentary he directed staring Jay-Z for Showtime.\n\nHoward's other films include Im Herzen der See (2015), based on the true story that inspired Moby Dick; his adaptation of Dan Brown's best-selling novels Illuminati (2009), and The Da Vinci Code - Sakrileg (2006) staring Oscar winner Tom Hanks; the blockbuster holiday favorite \"Dr. Seuss' Der Grinch (2000)\" starring Jim Carrey; \"Parenthood\" starring Steve Martin; the fantasy epic Willow (1988); Nightshift - Das Leichenhaus flippt völlig aus (1982) starring Henry Winkler, Michael Keaton and Shelley Long; and the suspenseful western, The Missing (2003), staring Oscar winners Cate Blanchett and Tommy Lee Jones.\n\nRecently, Howard directed Inferno (2016), the third installment of Dan Brown 's Robert Langdon franchise and The Beatles: Eight Days a Week - The Touring Years (2016), a documentary about the rock legends The Beatles. He also produced the second season of Breakthrough - Aufbruch in unsere Zukunft (2015), Mars (2016), and directed the first episode of Genius (2017), based on the life of Albert Einstein, all for NatGeo.\n\nSpencer Tracy was the second son born on April 5, 1900, to truck salesman John Edward and Caroline Brown Tracy in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. While attending Marquette Academy, he and classmate Pat O'Brien quit school to enlist in the Navy at the start of World War I. Tracy was still at Norfolk Navy Yard in Virginia at the end of the war. After playing the lead in the play \"The Truth\" at Ripon College he decided that acting might be his career.\n\nMoving to New York, Tracy and O'Brien, who'd also settled on a career on the stage, roomed together while attending the Academy of Dramatic Arts. In 1923 both got nonspeaking parts as robots in \"R.U.R.\", a dramatization of the groundbreaking science fiction novel by Czech author Karel Capek. Making very little money in stock, Tracy supported himself with jobs as bellhop, janitor and salesman until John Ford saw his critically acclaimed performance in the lead role in the play \"The Last Mile\" (later played on film by Clark Gable) and signed him for The William Fox Film Company's production of Up the River (1930). Despite appearing in sixteen films at that studio over the next five years, Tracy was never able to rise to full film star status there, in large part because the studio was unable to match his talents to suitable story material.\n\nDuring that period the studio itself floundered, eventually merging with Darryl F. Zanuck, Joseph Schenck and William Goetz's William 20th Century Pictures to become 20th Century-Fox). In 1935 Tracy signed with MGM under the aegis of Irving Thalberg and his career flourished. He became the first actor to win back-to-back Best Actor Oscars for Manuel (1937) and, in a project he initially didn't want to star in, Teufelskerle (1938).\n\nDuring Tracy's nearly forty-year film career, he was nominated for his performances in San Francisco (1936), Vater der Braut (1950), Stadt in Angst (1955), Der alte Mann und das Meer (1958), Wer den Wind sät (1960), Urteil von Nürnberg (1961), and Rat mal, wer zum Essen kommt (1967).\n\nTracy had a brief romantic relationship with Loretta Young in the mid-1930s, and a lifelong one with Katharine Hepburn beginning in 1942 after they were first paired in Woman of the Year by director George Stevens. Tracy's strong Roman Catholic beliefs precluded his divorcing wife Louise, though they mostly lived apart. Tracy suffered from severe alcoholism and diabetes (from the late 1940s), which led to his declining several tailor-made roles in films that would become big hits with other actors in those roles. Although his drinking problems were well known, he was considered peerless among his colleagues (Tracy had a well-deserved reputation for keeping co-stars on their toes for his oddly endearing scene-stealing tricks), and remained in demand as a senior statesman who nevertheless retained box office clout. Two weeks after completion of Stanley Kramer's Rat mal, wer zum Essen kommt (1967), during which he suffered from lung congestion, Spencer Tracy died of a heart attack.\n\nFilm and stage actor and theater director Philip Seymour Hoffman was born in the Rochester, New York, suburb of Fairport to Marilyn (Loucks), a lawyer and judge, and Gordon Stowell Hoffman, a Xerox employee, and was mostly of German, Irish, English and Dutch ancestry. After becoming involved in high school theatrics, he attended New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, graduating with a B.F.A. degree in Drama in 1989.\n\nHe made his feature film debut in the indie production Kreuzfahrt vor Manhattan (1991) as Phil Hoffman, and his first role in a major release came the next year in My New Gun (1992). While he had supporting roles in some other major productions like Der Duft der Frauen (1992) and Twister (1996), his breakthrough role came in Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights (1997).\n\nHe quickly became an icon of indie cinema, establishing a reputation as one of the screen's finest actors, in a variety of supporting and second leads in indie and major features, including Todd Solondz's Happiness (1998), Makellos (1999), Der talentierte Mr. Ripley (1999), Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia (1999), Almost Famous - Fast berühmt (2000) and State and Main (2000). He also appeared in supporting roles in such mainstream, big-budget features as Roter Drache (2002), Unterwegs nach Cold Mountain (2003) and Mission: Impossible III (2006).\n\nHoffman was also quite active on the stage. On Broadway, he has earned two Tony nominations, as Best Actor (Play) in 2000 for a revival of Sam Shepard's \"True West\" and as Best Actor (Featured Role - Play) in 2003 for a revival of Eugene O'Neill (I)'s \"Long Day's Journey into Night.\" His other acting credits in the New York theater include \"The Seagull\" (directed by Mike Nichols for The New York Shakespeare Festival), \"Defying Gravity,\" \"The Merchant of Venice\" (directed by Peter Sellars), \"Shopping and F*@%ing\" and \"The Author's Voice\" (Drama Desk nomination).\n\nHe was the Co-Artistic Director of the LAByrinth Theater Company in New York, for which he directed \"Our Lady of 121st Street\" by Stephen Adly Guirgis. He also directed \"In Arabia, We'd All Be Kings\" and \"Jesus Hopped the A Train\" by Guirgis for LAByrinth, and \"The Glory of Living\" by Rebecca Gilman at the Manhattan Class Company.\n\nHoffman consolidated his reputation as one of the finest actors under the age of 40 with his turn in the title role of Capote (2005), for which he won the Los Angeles Film Critics Award as Best Actor. In 2006, he was awarded the Best Actor Oscar for the same role.\n\nOn February 2, 2014, Philip Seymour Hoffman was found dead in an apartment in Greenwich village, New York. Investigators found Hoffman with a syringe in his arm and two open envelopes of heroin next to him. Mr. Hoffman was long known to struggle with addiction. In 2006, he said in an interview with \"60 Minutes\" that he had given up drugs and alcohol many years earlier, when he was age 22. In 2013, he checked into a rehabilitation program for about 10 days after a reliance on prescription pills resulted in his briefly turning again to heroin.\n\nLeslie Howard Steiner was born in London to Lilian (Blumberg) and Ferdinand \"Frank\" Steiner. His father was a Hungarian Jewish immigrant, and his English mother was of German Jewish and mostly English descent. Leslie went to Dulwich College, then worked as a bank clerk until the outbreak of World War I, when he went into the army. In 1917, diagnosed as shell-shocked, he was invalided out and advised to take up acting as therapy. In a few years, his name was famous on the stages of London and New York. He made his first movie in 1914: (The Heroine of Mons (1914)). He became known as the perfect Englishman (slim, tall, intellectual, and sensitive), a part that he played in many movies which set women to dreaming about him. His first sound movie came out in 1930: Outward Bound (1930), an adaptation of the stage play in which he starred. In Never the Twain Shall Meet (1931) and Liebesleid (1932), he played the Englishman role to the hilt. His screen persona could perhaps best be summed up by his role as Sir Percy Blakeney in Die scharlachrote Blume (1934), a foppish society gentleman.\n\nIt was Howard who insisted that Humphrey Bogart get the role of Duke Mantee in Der versteinerte Wald (1936), a role that Bogart had played in the stage production. As he became more successful, he also became quite picky about which roles he would do, and usually performed in only two films a year. In 1939, he played the character that will always be associated with him, that of Ashley Wilkes, the honor-bound, disillusioned intellectual Southern gentleman, in Vom Winde verweht (1939).\n\nHowever, war clouds were gathering over England, and he devoted all his energy on behalf of the war effort. He directed films, wrote articles and made radio broadcasts. He died in 1943, when the KLM plane he was in was shot down by German fighters over the Bay of Biscay.\n\nChuck Norris is familiar to fans worldwide as the star of action films such as Chuck Norris - Hitman (1991), Delta Force (1986) and Delta Force II: The Colombian Connection (1990). He also starred in Braddock - Missing in Action (1984) and its sequels, Die Feuerwalze (1986) and Sidekicks (1992). He was an executive producer of Walker, Texas Ranger (1993) as well as the star.\n\nChuck Norris was born in Ryan, Oklahoma, to Wilma (Scarberry) and Ray Norris, who was a truck driver, mechanic, and bus driver. The eldest of three children, he helped his mother raise his two younger brothers in Torrance, CA, where his family moved when he was 12. Norris attended North Torrance High School from its inception in September, 1955 until his graduation in June, 1958. He is one of several storied alumni from the school. Other NHS alumni include Bob Hite (1943-1981), who was the lead singer of \"Canned Heat,\" Chris Demaria, who was a professional baseball player in the Kansas City Royals and Milwaukee Brewers organizations, Chris Mortensen, an analyst with ESPN, Hip-Hop DJ \"Key-Kool\" (Kikuo Nishi), and Wee-Man (Jason Acuna) of \"JackAss fame.\"\n\nNorris joined the Air Force after graduating from high school. During a stint in Korea, he began to study the Asian martial art of Tang Soo Do. After returning home, he worked for Northrop Aviation and moonlighted as a karate instructor. Two years later he was teaching full-time and running a number of martial-arts schools. His students included Steve McQueen, Priscilla Presley and the Osmonds.\n\nNorris's fight career lasted from 1964-1974. Norris started off by losing his first three tournaments but, by 1966, he was almost unbeatable. Among the numerous titles he won were The National Karate Championships (1966), All-Star Championships (1966), World Middleweight Karate Championship (1967), All-American Karate Championship (1967), Internationals (1968), World Professional Middleweight Karate Championship (defeating Louis Delgado on 24 November 1968), All-American Championship (1968), National Tournament of Champions (1968), American Tang Soo Championship, and the North American Karate Championship. Norris compiled a fight record of 65-5 with wins over champions Joe Lewis, Skipper Mullins, Arnold Urquidez, Ronald L. Marchini, Victor Moore, Louis Delgado, and Steve Sanders. Of the five men to beat Norris, three were Allen Steen, Joe Lewis, and Norris's last career defeat to Louis Delgado in 1968. Norris retired as undefeated Professional Full-Contact Middleweight Champion in 1974.\n\nNorris, who was urged to get into acting by his friend Steve McQueen, skillfully incorporates his martial-arts knowledge into his series and feature film projects, stressing action and technique over violence. He is the author of the books \"The Secret of Inner Strength\" and \"The Secret Power Within - Zen Solutions to Real Problems\". He works for many charities, including the Funds for Kids, Veterans Administration National Salute to Hospitalized Veterans, the United Way, Make-a-Wish Foundation and KickStart, a nonprofit organization he created to help battle drugs and violence in schools. He also starred in the television movie Blood in Blood Out - Verschworen auf Leben und Tod (1993), broadcast on CBS.\n\nHe lives on a ranch when not filming.\n\nDanny Kaye left school at the age of 13 to work in the so-called Borscht Belt of Jewish resorts in the Catskill Mountains. It was there he learned the basics of show biz. From there he went through a series of jobs in and out of the business. In 1939, he made his Broadway debut in \"Straw Hat Revue,\" but it was the stage production of the musical \"Lady in the Dark\" in 1940 that brought him acclaim and notice from agents. Also in 1940, he married Sylvia Fine, who went on to manage his career. She helped create the routines and gags, and wrote most of the songs that he performed. Danny could sing and dance like many others, but his specialty was reciting those tongue-twisting songs and monologues.\n\nSamuel Goldwyn had been trying to sign Kaye to a movie contract for two years before he eventually agreed. Goldwyn put him in a series of Technicolor musicals, starting with Up in Arms (1944). His debut was successful, and he continued to make hit movies such as Das Doppelleben des Herrn Mitty (1947) and Der falsche Revisor (1949). In 1954, he appeared with Bing Crosby in Weiße Weihnachten (1954), which was based on the Irving Berlin song of the same name. In 1955, he made what many consider his best comedy, Der Hofnarr (1955), with the brilliant Pellet with the Poison routine. Like all things, however, the lifespan of a comedian is limited and his movie career waned. In 1960, he began doing specials on television and this led to his own TV series, The Danny Kaye Show (1963), which ran from 1963 to 1967.\n\nSome of his last roles were also his most memorable, such as an intense Holocaust survivor in Kreuz der Gewalt (1981) and as a kind but goofy dentist in an episode of Die Bill Cosby Show (1984). He also worked tirelessly for UNICEF."
