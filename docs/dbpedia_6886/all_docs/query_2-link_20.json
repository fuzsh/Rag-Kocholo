They later worked together in Verdammte süße Welt (1965) and Dieses Mädchen ist für alle (1966) and became good friends. She also played herself in a cameo in his film Bill McKay - Der Kandidat (1972). Eventually they lost touch, and Redford did not attend Wood's funeral after she died in a suspicious boating accident, at 43, in 1981.\n\nAs of 2014, has appeared in four films that were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar Butch Cassidy und Sundance Kid (1969), Der Clou (1973), Alle Männer des Präsidenten (1976) and Jenseits von Afrika (1985).

When Coppola demurred, preferring his first choice of Tony Award-winning Broadway actor Al Pacino, Evans explained that Redford could fit the role as he could be perceived as \"northern Italian.\" Evans lost the struggle, Pacino was cast and a star was born.\n\nRobert Young, who was a star at MGM in the 1930s and starred in the TV series \"Father Knows Best\" and \"Marcus Welby MD\", was a cousin of his mother."
