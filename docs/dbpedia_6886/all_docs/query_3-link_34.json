        "text": "He is a true Hollywood great, an icon of a generation and one of the most beautiful men ever to grace the big screen.\n\nYet there were no glittering galas to honour Robert Redford ’s 80th birthday last week as the famously modest star told family and friends he wanted no fanfare surrounding the milestone.\n\nHe said: “I don’t like marking time like that, I like to keep rolling forward.”\n\nRedford has no plans to retire and refused to allow his birthday to interrupt­ an exhausting stream of interviews scheduled to promote his new hit movie Pete’s Dragon.\n\nBut although he is happy to talk at length about his films, his Sundance Film Festival and the causes he champions­, Redford keeps quiet about the many sadnesses he has endured away from the cameras.\n\nEven his biographer Michael Callan, who spent 14 years interviewing Redford and had full access to his family, friends, and decades’ worth of private diaries and letters, could not persuade the actor to open up about his emotional wounds.\n\nOnly rarely is there a glimpse of what helped make him the multifaceted­ star the world knows.\n\nRedford said: “People think it’s been easy for me. That’s hard to live with. It’s so untrue.”\n\nBut he added: “I am not into shared soul searching.”\n\nBorn on August 18, 1936 in Santa Monica, California, Redford’s dad Charles was a milkman who worked long hours.\n\nSo his uncle David, a talented athlete fluent in four languages, became a father figure, teaching his young nephew how to throw an American­ football.\n\nBut then David died in Luxembourg, where he was serving with General Patton’s Third Army, when his Jeep came under fire while crossing a bridge in 1945.\n\nMore personal agony was to come. When he was 18 his mum Martha died, aged 40, after having stillborn twins .\n\nStruggling with grief, he turned to drink and was expelled from the University of Colorado.\n\nHe lost his baseball scholarship for stealing beer from pals’ storerooms and breaking into empty homes to booze all night.\n\nLost, he enrolled in the American Academy of Dramatic Art, fell in love with acting and a Mormon girl called Lola van Wagenen, in 1957.\n\nBarely a year after the pair eloped to Las Vegas they had a son, Scott, and moved to an apartment in Manhattan while Redford performed in his first Broadway play.\n\nOne night in November 1959, Redford kissed his 10-week-old son Scott goodnight, and laid him in his cot but by next morning the baby was dead, a victim of cot death.\n\nRedford said later: “It was really hard. We were very young. I had my first theatre job, which didn’t pay much. We didn’t know anything about sudden infant death syndrome so as a parent you blame yourself. It creates a scar that never completely heals.”\n\nOne can only imagine how the couple felt three years later when their second son Jamie was born seven weeks’ premature­, suffering a respiratory problem which almost proved fatal.\n\nThen in his teens Jamie developed ulcerative colitis, and he not only needed his colon removed but two liver transplants by the time he was 30.\n\nWhen the first transplant failed a desperate search for a compatible organ took place which Redford later called his worst 12 weeks.\n\nEven as the star’s fame grew, away the traumas kept coming.\n\nIn 1983 his daughter Shauna’s fiancé was found dead, shot in the back of the head.\n\nRedford later said: “The hardest thing is when your children have problems. There have been so many hits on our family no one knows about and I don’t want them to for my family’s sake.”\n\nRedford’s big screen breakthrough came in 1967 in Barefoot in the Park, starring opposite Jane Fonda , who was smitten with him.\n\nShe said: “I was so in love with Bob. Nothing ever happened between us but he was fabulous­ to kiss. I had a mad crush. I couldn’t wait for the cuddling scenes. The only bad thing is he doesn’t like to do love scenes.”\n\nHe then starred opposite Paul Newman in the unforgettable Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\n\nThe studio had huge names such as Marlon Brando , Warren Beatty and James Coburn in mind for the part. But after meeting Redford, Newman told execs to go for the lesser-known man as he “wanted to work with an actor”.\n\nThe blue-eyed idols hit it off so well that Newman, who had already been cast as Sundance, agreed to switch roles.\n\nThe film was an £80million box office phenomenon - then a massive hit - and formed the start of an unshakeable­ friendship lasting until Newman’s death from cancer in 2008.\n\nNewman supported Redford through the breakdown­ of his 28-year marriage to Lola - with whom he has three children­, Artist Shauna, 55, writer and producer Jamie, 54, and actress Amy, 45.\n\nBut their easygoing friendship centred around laughs. Redford gave Newman a dented, engine-less Porsche wrapped in a bow as a joke for his 50th birthday.\n\nNewman had the car crushed and sent back to Redford. In turn Redford had the lump modelled into a garden sculpture­ and delivered to Newman, who lived just a mile away in Connecticut.\n\n“We played these tricks on each other and the idea was you would never acknowledge the trick played on you,” said Redford.\n\n“So we never mentioned that Porsche. The durability and length of this friendship has created a pretty deep root. He was a real friend.”\n\nAfter being hailed an Adonis for his role as Sundance, Redford - who was denied the part of Benjamin Braddock in The Graduate as he had never been rejected by a woman - began to see his chiselled good looks as a millstone.\n\nHe said: “This constant reference to me being the way I looked made me crazy, like I was being put into a cage.\n\n“You say, ‘No, I’m an actor.’ I came into this because of the craft of acting. It was a matter of pride to be convincing. But instead, I hear about my blond hair.\n\n“The nice thing about getting older is you don’t have that so much anymore.”\n\nRedford, with a £150million fortune thanks to smashes like The Way We Were, All the Presidents’ Men and Indecent­ Proposal, is now a grandfather of seven and lives with second wife Sibylle Szaggars amidst breathtaking scenery at his 6,000-acre ranch in Utah.\n\nWhen work allows, his family will gather there to mark his birthday. But there will be no glitz. As that’s the way Hollywood’s quiet man likes, who has secretly been through so much, likes it."
