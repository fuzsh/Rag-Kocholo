        "text": "Los Angeles, CA – BBC Earth Films announced today that Earth: One Amazing Day, the long-awaited sequel to Earth, will be released in theaters nationwide on October 6, 2017. The big screen, feel good, family-friendly adventure showcases the everyday relationship between various species on the planet and is narrated by Academy Award® winner Robert Redford.\n\nOver the course of one single day, Earth: One Amazing Day tracks the sun from the highest mountains to the remotest islands, from exotic jungles to urban jungles. Astounding breakthroughs in filmmaking technology bring the audience up close and personal with a cast of unforgettable characters: a baby zebra desperate to cross a swollen river, a penguin who heroically undertakes a death-defying daily commute to feed his family, a family of sperm whales who like to snooze vertically, and a sloth on the hunt for love. Told with humor, intimacy, emotion, and a jaw-dropping sense of cinematic splendor, Earth: One Amazing Day spectacularly highlights how every day is filled with more unseen dramas and wonders than you could possibly imagine— until now!\n\n“As a storyteller and filmmaker I often look to nature for sources of inspiration,” said narrator Robert Redford. “In Earth: One Amazing Day, BBC Earth Films captured the natural world and its inhabitants using the perfect combination of storytelling and cutting-edge technology. The scenes and images are as inspirational as they are beautiful, and I was honored to be a part of the film.”\n\nEarth: One Amazing Day is directed by Richard Dale (BAFTA and Peabody winner, The Human Body) and Peter Webber (The Girl with the Pearl Earring). The film is scored by Alex Heffes (Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, The Last King of Scotland) and scripted by leading screenwriter Frank Cottrell-Boyce (London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony, The Railway Man). The film is produced by Stephen McDonogh (Walking With Dinosaurs 3D and Louis Theroux’s award-winning feature My Scientology Movie) and executive produced by Neil Nightingale (Enchanted Kingdom and Wild Africa).\n\nEarth: One Amazing Day is MPAA Rated G with a running time of 88 minutes. Theatrical booking services for Earth: One Amazing Day, including in select Dolby Cinema™ and Dolby Atmos™, to be provided by Atlas Distribution Company.\n\nFor more information about Earth: One Amazing Day, visit www.earthoneamazingday.com.\n\nTRAILER: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJuuv7BTlQA\n\nAbout BBC Earth Films\n\nBBC Earth Films is the theatrical arm of BBC Earth, the global factual brand for BBC Worldwide.
