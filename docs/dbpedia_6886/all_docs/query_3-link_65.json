        "text": "A team group of Blackburn Rovers in 1895, with Tom Brandon sitting proudly in the centre of the front row\n\nTom Brandon was one of the most prominent Scottish footballers of the 1890s, a powerful full back who was capped against England and won the FA Cup with Blackburn Rovers. Yet despite his rugged image he is remembered in a surprisingly unique way, as he must be the only player ever to have a dancing school named after him.\n\n​ I write this on the 80th anniversary of his death, having uncovered the mystery of his life story. For years, Brandon was thought to have emigrated to the USA after losing a court case when he was shamed for abandoning his wife and son. However, there was no further trace of him and it was assumed he had died there. Quite by chance I found he had later returned to Scotland, and settled into a new life in Edinburgh, where he died in 1941. He was one of the last players to be discovered while I was researching The Men Who Made Scotland.\n\nBrandon was born in the Ayrshire mining village of Glengarnock, near Kilbirnie, in 1867. His Irish Catholic parents registered him as William but as he was known throughout his life as Tom I believe they added Thomas at his baptism. He had a fine football pedigree as his elder brothers Robert and James were also professionals on both sides of the border, as was a cousin called Harry, but Tom was the finest of them all. The family moved when he was very young to Kilbarchan in Renfrewshire, where he started his football career with local clubs Johnstone, Port Glasgow Athletic and St Mirren where he played alongside his brothers.\n\nTom Brandon\n\n​Tom was recognised as a talent early on and was selected several times for Renfrewshire from 1887, also winning the Renfrewshire Cup with St Mirren in 1888. He was considered the finest full back in Scotland when he was signed by Blackburn Rovers in 1889, who spent freely that summer to attract the best. Their investment paid off as Rovers won the FA Cup in 1890 but Brandon was discovered to be ineligible under the rules of the time, and after playing in every other game that season he had to be dropped for the semi-final and final.\n\nHowever, he did win an FA Cup medal in 1891 when Rovers retained the cup, beating Notts County in the final, and was selected for the Football League against the Football Alliance. By then, he had signed a controversial pre-contract agreement to move to Sheffield Wednesday, and part of the deal was him taking over the Woodman Inn.\n\nHe returned to Blackburn in September to get married to Elizabeth Duckworth, whose sister had already married fellow internationalist George Dewar. Appointed club captain, he fulfilled two years with Wednesday then wanted to return to Blackburn in 1893 but his club refused to grant him a transfer, as they were entitled to do under Football League regulations. As a way out of the impasse he signed for Nelson, in the Lancashire League, until Wednesday caved in and took a fee for his transfer to Rovers in December – one of the earliest examples of a transfer fee, with the amount widely quoted (and then denied) as £150.\n\n​ He made his international debut in 1896 when the SFA finally ended its policy of selecting only Scottish-based players, and Brandon was one of several to feature against England. Although he did well in a 2-1 victory at Celtic Park, it turned out to be his only cap as his life took an unfortunate turn.\n\nThat summer he hit the headlines for the wrong reasons, as he was charged with persistent cruelty to his wife, who appeared in the witness box with a black eye and was duly granted a separation order and a weekly maintenance payment. Tom remained in Blackburn but his career was clearly waning, and he played his last match for Rovers in March 1900.\n\nHe returned to St Mirren that autumn but within a month he was back in court, charged with arrears on maintenance for his wife and was sent to prison for one month with the option to settle the arrears. He chose the latter, made his last appearance for Saints in January 1901 and left the country.\n\nTom Brandon's gravestone at Warriston Cemetery in Edinburgh\n\n​He was soon reported to be living in Rhode Island, USA, and that was the last anyone heard of him.\n\nHowever, it appears that after the First World War he returned to Scotland to go back to work as a coal miner. He settled in central Edinburgh with his new partner, Mary Kemp, and while she called herself Mrs Brandon they never married. He lived with her and her family in Keir Street until his death.\n\nBetty Brandon (real name Elizabeth Morrison) standing on the right, with her young dancers from the popular Betty Brandon School of Dancing in Edinburgh\n\nUnusually, the Brandon name lived on after his death. Mary Kemp had three daughters from her first marriage to William Morrison, and one of them was Betty, a talented dance teacher. When she set up a dance school in the 1930s she decided to name it after her mother's partner, so the Betty Brandon School of Dancing was founded. It became renowned as one of the best dance schools in Edinburgh for many years, and many hundreds of young girls and boys passed through its doors until at least the 1970s, little suspecting the footballer origins of the school's name.\n\nTom Brandon rests in Warriston Cemetery, his gravestone lying flat after falling from its plinth. It is the last reminder of a man who made a lasting impact not just as a footballer but in other fields as well.\n\nWilliam Thomas Brandon\n\n​Born 3 October 1867 at 136 Glengarnock, Ayrshire, to Robert Brandon and Eliza Smith.\n\n​Died 24 November 1941 at 18 Keir Street, Edinburgh.\n\nTo mark Black History Month, this is the story of a pioneering black rugby player.\n\nEdwin Oxley was one of Scotland’s leading rugby players in the 1930s, captain of Edinburgh side Heriot's FP, yet he was never capped by his country. According to some accounts, including his old school, the reason for this snub was that he was black.\n\nHowever, while he was undoubtedly discriminated against in a time of endemic racism, there is perhaps a more prosaic reason for his non-selection for Scotland: he was born in England. In fact, he spent the first 13 years of his life in Staffordshire before he was able to join his birth mother in Edinburgh.\n\nHis father was James Oxley, a black medical student from Trinidad at Edinburgh University. While in Scotland he had a relationship with Isabella Nichol, the unmarried daughter of a local joiner, and when she fell pregnant she went far away to Burton-on-Trent to have the baby, presumably to avoid the inevitable stigma of an illegitimate child, and a black one at that.\n\nThe Heriot's FP team of 1929, Scottish champions for the second successive year. Edwin Oxley is in the back row, second from right.\n\nBorn on 4 May 1907 in a small terraced house in Burton, the infant Edwin was fostered to a local family, his foster mother Mary Lukin taking care of him until he was 13, while he attended school in the town.\n\nMeanwhile his parents did marry in Edinburgh early in 1910, using the Scottish system of 'marriage by declaration' but it appears to have been purely for practical reasons as six weeks later his father sailed for America, never to return. Dr James Edwin Tyndall Oxley, who had just graduated with first class honours in medicine, settled in Pennsylvania, where he married for a second time in 1919 (apparently without seeking a divorce) and raised another family. He died in 1927 of pneumonia.\n\nEdwin's mother, meanwhile, remained in Edinburgh and he finally joined her there in 1921, enrolling at George Heriot's, a fee-paying school. Clearly her financial circumstances had improved and it may be that the father sent money to cover the boy's education.\n\nAt school he was given the nickname Sam, short for 'Sambo', which went unquestioned at the time and stuck throughout his life. He stood out as probably the only black pupil but, as an athletic and personable young boy, he fitted in well, and ended up captaining the school rugby team as well as playing for its cricket eleven.\n\nWhen he left school in 1927 it was a daunting time for a black man to enter adult life in Edinburgh. This was the year of the infamous 'colour bar' in the city, imposed by some bars and restaurants against African and Asian students. Although that racist ban caused such condemnation that it was soon withdrawn, it reflected a society where feelings about race could run high.\n\nIt was little surprise that he stuck to the people he knew, and continued to play rugby with Heriot's FP. They were then one of Scotland's top sides, and were the country's unofficial champions in 1928 and 1929. A wing forward, he remained with the club throughout the following decade, captaining the team for three seasons and regularly praised in the media, but whenever representative sides were named, he was never in the mix.\n\nPraise for Oxley in The Scotsman after his appearance for Edinburgh & Glasgow in 1935 (British Newspaper Archive)\n\nIt is easy to speculate that the Scottish Rugby Union, a notoriously reactionary body, would have baulked at the idea of picking a black man for Scotland. At the time, it was not the done thing to challenge the selectors, yet one wonders if they knew he was English-born and had a simple excuse at the ready.\n\nAt the very least, he would have been a natural fit for the Edinburgh team in the annual inter-city clashes with Glasgow (and would not have been the first black player for Edinburgh, as James Robertson did so in the 1870s). But perhaps because the inter-city matches were seen as trials for the international team, he never got the nod.\n\nHis only honour was being picked for a one-off Glasgow & Edinburgh Select which faced the All Blacks at Old Anniesland in October 1935. The match was narrowly lost 8-9 but although he did well he was not named in the next Edinburgh fifteen – 'a notable omission' according to one newspaper.\n\nA fine assessment of Oxley's worth in The Scotsman after another Sevens success in 1938 (BNA)\n\nOne area where Oxley excelled was Rugby Sevens, and he led Heriot's to a superb haul of medals in the prestigious Borders tournaments. With him in the team, they won at Jedforest three times, Melrose twice, Langholm four times, Hawick and Selkirk once each.\n\nHe finally retired from the game in 1939 and was immediately taken onto the Heriot’s selection committee, retaining his link to the club for many years.\n\nMeanwhile he went into business as a commercial artist, running Oxley Studios in Cockburn Street, and his work sometimes turns up at auction. In 1947 he married Inga Peace, a fashion illustrator, and although they had no children they remained together until his death. Sadly, he died early in 1969, aged 61, after taking an overdose.\n\nThis linocut by Edwin Oxley of George Heriot's, his old school, was sold at Ramsay Cornish auction house in 2020\n\nWhile Oxley's story is little known, thankfully he has not been forgotten, and the Heriot's School Magazine The Quadrangle recently published a lengthy article about him. They paid tribute to his achievements: \"We know that Eddie Oxley was a great player who was undoubtedly deprived of an international career because he was black; that this charismatic man was a gifted artist and a creative and successful businessman. What we don't know is how he coped with and felt about the social mores of the time; with being a black man operating in, and apparently embraced by, polite Edinburgh society; a person patronised with what we now know as the 'casual racism' of his popular moniker 'Sam', and yet loved and revered by so many people.\"\n\nFrom my researches in recent years, it is clear that Eddie Oxley is just one example of Scotland's hidden history of black sportsmen and women, who overcame discrimination to make their mark in sport. I hope that bringing their achievements to a wider audience will inspire a greater appreciation of the challenges they faced, and I am convinced that there are more stories waiting to be uncovered.\n\nEdwin James Oxley, rugby player.\n\nBorn 4 May 1907 in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire.\n\nDied 19 January 1969 in Balerno, Edinburgh.\n\nThere used to be a strict rule in British international football, that you had to be born in the country you would represent. That's why Scots such as John Goodall and Joe Baker played for England, while English-bred players such as Alex Donaldson and Jack Lyall were capped by Scotland. Until the agreement changed in the 1970s to allow parental birthplaces to be considered, very few slipped through the net - I wrote recently about the cases of Willie Watson and James McKee.\n\nHowever, there was one notable exception when the Scottish Football Association was quite happy to break the rule. Jimmy Wardhaugh of Hearts was capped twice for Scotland and nine times for the Scottish League despite a birthplace on the 'wrong' side of the border in Northumberland.\n\nWardhaugh was a goalscorer supreme in the outstanding Hearts team of the 1950s, part of the 'Terrible Trio' alongside Alfie Conn and Willie Bauld. Known as Twinkletoes for his quick feet, he scored no less than 376 goals for the club, a record that stood until it was beaten decades later by John Robertson.\n\nNot surprisingly, Wardhaugh came into contention for international honours and his first call-up was for the Scottish League in January 1951. This prompted a lively debate in the press: was he really Scottish?\n\nBerwick Advertiser, 18 January 1951, discusses Wardhaugh's nationality and birthplace (British Newspaper Archive)\n\nWardhaugh himself confirmed he had been born in the hamlet of Marshall Meadows, the first settlement south of the Scotland-England border. He had moved to Edinburgh as a young boy and spent virtually all his life there, stating unequivocally: 'I am a Scot'. In football and geographical terms, however, despite spurious claims that the cottage where he was born was actually a few yards inside Scotland, there was no doubt about it: he was English.\n\nThen, to general surprise, George Graham, the Secretary of the SFA, weighed into the debate with a curious piece of logic. He told the press: 'The SFA does not work to a foot-rule or feel itself bound by a matter of a few yards which are debatably English or Scottish ground. We have always regarded the Tweed as the border. Berwick Rangers are a Scottish club - they are playing at Brechin in the Scottish Cup next Saturday. And Wardhaugh is a Scotsman who I can say quite categorically will be brought into the selectors' reckoning when future teams are being chosen.'\n\nGeorge Graham, normally a pedantic stickler for rules, gave no explanation for this policy of blurred national boundaries. He also managed to contradict himself in his statement, as Berwick Rangers' home at Shielfield Park is actually south of the River Tweed, in Tweedmouth.\n\nHowever, there were no complaints from the FA about his eligibility, and Wardhaugh scored on his debut for the Scottish League, against the League of Ireland. Despite his goal-scoring prowess he had to wait a while to be selected for the full national team, and finally made his Scotland debut against Hungary at a packed Hampden on 8 December 1954. He was capped just once more, against Northern Ireland on 7 November 1956.\n\nCuriously, however, Wardhaugh was not born in Marshall Meadows, even though he claimed he was. Accounts of his life have always stated that was his birthplace, but they are all wrong. I recently ordered up his birth certificate and it clearly says James Alexander Douglas Wardhaugh was born on 21 March 1929 in Berwick itself, at 65 High Street (now named Marygate). This was the home of his mother's family, the Egans, who lived in a flat above a chemist shop; the building is still there although the business is now a charity shop.\n\nWinniefred Egan had married Alexander Wardhaugh at Berwick Barracks in January 1928. Alexander, born in Tweedmouth, was a career soldier who had been in uniform since 1912 and was serving with the Royal Scots Greys, based at Redford Barracks in Edinburgh, by the time Jimmy was born. Winnie was born in northern India while her own father was serving there, and was brought up in Berwick.\n\n​ When Alexander retired from the Army in 1933 the family remained in Edinburgh, where Jimmy was brought up and spent the rest of his life. ​There is nothing to indicate that the Wardhaughs ever lived in Marshall Meadows, although it is possible the mother and baby stayed there for a short time.\n\nJimmy Wardhaugh's birth certificate records his birthplace as 65 High Street, Berwick upon Tweed\n\nThe SFA's recognition of Berwick as part of Scotland, for footballing purposes, appears to have been a one-off. Later internationalists to have been born in the town, Trevor Steven and Lucy Bronze, have played for England without any quibble. Also born in Berwick was Thomas Burn, who represented the 'Great Britain' football team in the 1912 Olympic Games; he played for the England amateur team yet his club side was London Caledonians.\n\nIn Jimmy Wardhaugh's case, England's loss was Scotland's gain. There is nothing unusual today about an English-born player with Scottish connections playing for Scotland, but in the 1950s he was a unique exception, thanks to the SFA's loose grip of geography.\n\nAlthough he only won two caps, Jimmy remains a legendary figure at Tynecastle. His goals and teamwork helped Hearts to win the Scottish Cup in 1956, the Scottish League in 1958, and two League Cups. After retiring in 1961 he remained in football as a journalist until his sudden death on 2 January 1978, aged just 48.\n\n* With thanks for David Speed, historian at Heart of Midlothian FC, for his input. I also recommend reading Tom Maxwell's book The Lone Rangers on the issue of nationality for a football fan in Berwick.\n\nIt's amazing what can turn up. This silver buckle, attached to its original belt, was presented in 1865 by the 14th Earl of Eglinton for competition by cricket clubs in Cunninghame, north Ayrshire. I believe this was the world's first knock-out cricket tournament, a distinction which has apparently not previously been recognised.\n\nIn fact the Earl presented three prizes that summer: a silver ball for the winners, the silver-mounted belt for the runners-up, and a cricket bat for third place. Having added the belt to my collection following a chance find on eBay, I decided to look into its history, and the wider sporting patronage of the Earls of Eglinton in the Victorian era.\n\nThe Eglinton silver belt, won in 1865 by Irvine Eglinton cricket club\n\nIt was first announced in the Ardrossan and Saltcoats Herald on 13 May 1865: 'CRICKET - The Earl of Eglinton has resolved to come out as a patron of this fine manly game and has intimated to the cricketers in the district of Cunninghame that he intends giving them three prizes, to be competed for annually.'\n\nThe prizes attracted five local cricket clubs to enter the competition. It was an awkward number for a knock-out competition, but the ties were drawn and in the first round Ardeer beat Kilmarnock Junior on 3 June, then Kilwinning Monkcastle beat Kilmarnock Winton on 17 June, while Irvine Eglinton were given a bye. In the second round, effectively the semi-final, Irvine Eglinton beat Ardeer on 1 July while Kilwinning Monkcastle received a bye.\n\nThis set up a final which was played on 22 July at the Earl's own cricket pitch at Eglinton Castle. Kilwinning Monkcastle took the honours, and the silver ball, by beating Irvine Eglinton by 45 runs after two innings.\n\nReport of the first Eglinton cricket final in the Kilmarnock Weekly Post of 29 July 1865 (BNA)\n\nThere was still a need for a third place match, and Ardeer won the silver-mounted bat on 19 August, defeating Kilmarnock Winton by 17 runs.\n\nThe Eglinton prizes for Cunninghame clubs continued each year until 1882 when the silver ball was won by Beith. by this time, there was no mention of a silver belt for the runners-up, and the current whereabouts of the silver ball is (I believe) unknown.\n\nHence the little belt and buckle, which I now own, appears to be Scotland's oldest surviving cricket trophy. There were earlier cricket cups in England, but only for direct competition between two teams. I can find no earlier instance of a knock-out tournament.\n\nThe original winners of the belt, Irvine Eglinton, had been founded in the town in 1858, and not surprisingly the club's patron was the Earl of Eglinton himself. The club was one of the leading sides in Ayrshire in the 1860s but had a chequered history, having to bounce back from losing its ground to coal mining in 1867 and then became homeless again in 1874, after which it was wound up.\n\nThe 14th Earl was clearly a cricket enthusiast and delighted at the success of his tournament, so in 1867 he went one bigger and provided a trophy for the whole of Ayrshire (or more formally for Carrick, Kyle and Cunninghame). He had announced the previous summer that he would offer a silver cup, value £40, and the first edition of the competition attracted eleven entries. The first winners were Irvine Eglinton, defeating Ayr in the final. In succeeding years the winners always came from Ayr until Ayr CC won it three years in a row to take permanent possession of the trophy in 1875. It was in fact three trophies, a silver gilt claret jug with two goblets, all in the same velvet-lined box.\n\nThe Eglinton Cup, still held by Ayr CC, came back into public view in 2017 when it took pride of place at a Scottish cricket exhibition within the Football Museum at Hampden Park.\n\nAyr cricket historian Norman Simpson with the Eglinton trophy (Ayrshire Post, 4 August 2017)\n\nAt that time, the Eglinton cup was hailed as the world's oldest cricket trophy but I think I can now dispute that claim by two years (although whether a silver belt can claim to be a trophy is another question).\n\nThe 14th Earl of Eglinton and Winton, pictured in 1881\n\nWhile the 14th Earl, who died in 1892 aged 50, can be credited with creating the first cricket tournaments, it has to be said he was a sporting lightweight compared to his father, who had an extraordinary record of patronage that endures to this day.\n\nThe 13th Earl of Eglinton (1812-1861) is perhaps best known for his extravagant Eglinton Tournament which he hosted in 1839. However his lasting legacy was in sport. Described as 'the generous patron of every manly exercise', over the following two decades until his death he lavished his wealth on a huge variety of prizes which encouraged sporting competition in Scotland and far beyond.\n\nHis personal passion was horse racing and he kept a large racing stud, the greatest exponent being Flying Dutchman which won the Derby and the St Leger in 1849. The Earl also provided the Eglinton Cup at the Curragh racecourse in Kildare while he was Viceroy of Ireland.\n\nIn bowls, he donated the Eglinton Gold and Silver Bowls for clubs in Ayrshire (1854) and the magnificent Eglinton Silver Jug (1857) for annual competition between Ayrshire and Glasgow. These are all still competed for today.\n\nIn curling, he presented the Eglinton Jug in 1851 for Ayrshire clubs and it is also still going as a vibrant competition.\n\nIn golf, the Earl was a founder of Prestwick Golf Club in 1851 and provided the silver belt which was won on the course by Willie Park at the very first Open Championship in 1860. It continued to be the prize for the winner of the Open each year until Tom Morris junior won it outright in 1871, and it was replaced with the famous claret jug. The belt now resides in the R&A World Golf Museum in St Andrews.\n\nA group of bowlers on the bowling green at Eglinton Castle circa 1870, including the 14th Earl of Eglinton fourth from right.

He founded the Eglinton Hunt and gave the Eglinton Hunt Cup to Ayr races. What is more, Eglinton Castle was superbly equipped with a rackets hall, a cricket pitch, a curling pond and a croquet lawn. Most of the castle is now ruins in the country park, but the rackets hall is a rare survivor, the oldest indoor sports building in Scotland.\n\nOverall the patronage of the 13th Earl of Eglinton helped to encourage Scottish sport in many fields. After his death, the 14th Earl was less extravagant but he still made a key contribution to cricket and I am delighted to have discovered one of his original prizes.\n\nDid you hear the one about the Englishman and the Irishman who played for Scotland against Wales? It sounds crazy but it actually happened in 1898.\n\nAt a time when the Scottish FA only selected players born north of the border, William Watson and James McKee helped Scotland to a 5-2 win over Wales. Watson was in goal, while McKee scored two of the goals.\n\nWhat was not reported at the time, and has only recently come to light, was that they were not Scottish: Watson was born in South Shields, while McKee first saw the day in County Down. Both moved to Lanarkshire as boys and had effectively 'gone native'.\n\nThis is one of the discoveries I made while researching 'The Men who made Scotland', my new Who's Who of Scotland Internationalists.\n\nWilliam Watson (back row, second from right) with a victorious but unidentified five-a-side team and its prizes. Maybe Dykehead or East Stirlingshire (courtesy of Bill Aitchison)\n\nWilliam Watson was born in Westoe, South Shields, in 1873 and moved to Shotts with his mother and brothers in the 1880s after the death of his father. He became a goalkeeper with local team Dykehead then signed for East Stirlingshire in 1895, helping the team to the Scottish Qualifying Cup final. By now he was living in Falkirk, where he got married, started a family and was working as a miner. He joined the town’s other team, Falkirk FC in 1897.\n\nJames McKee, meanwhile, had been born in Moira, County Down in 1871. He was still an infant when his family moved to Shotts, and was brought up in the same area as Watson, also playing for Dykehead. He went on to a reasonably successful career as a goal-scoring centre forward, while never hitting the heights: he joined Hearts in 1895 but played just a couple of first team games (scoring in both), moved to Darwen in the English second division a year later, and came back to Scotland with East Stirlingshire in 1897.\n\nBoth players benefited from the SFA's policy in the late 19th century of putting out three distinct elevens for the home international series, with the players chosen to face Ireland and Wales regarded as 'second strings', often provincial players who were not really good enough to face England but deserving of recognition nonetheless. It was an era when players from Montrose, Alloa and East Stirlingshire could play for Scotland.\n\nThis reflected the standard of Watson and McKee, who had both won county caps for Stirlingshire, which put them in the reckoning for international honours. They were duly selected for an international trial at Cathkin in early March 1898 and although McKee had to withdraw through injury, when the selectors announced the team to face Wales, both were included.\n\nWillie Watson's secret revealed in the Evening Citizen in April 1961 (courtesy Bill Aitchison)\n\nScotland's internationals in 1898 were played on three consecutive weekends, with Scotland using a total of 28 players. The series starting in Motherwell on 19 March with eight debutants in the line-up against Wales: William Watson (Falkirk); Nicol Smith (Rangers), Matthew Scott (Airdrieonians, captain); William Thomson (Dumbarton), Alex Christie (Queen's Park), Peter Campbell (Morton); James Gillespie (Third Lanark), James Miller (Rangers), James McKee (East Stirlingshire), Hugh Morgan (St Mirren), Robert Findlay (Kilmarnock).\n\nThe game drew a small crowd of around 3,500 to Fir Park, and they saw a comfortable victory for the home team. Scotland went four goals up, two from Gillespie and two from McKee, before the Welsh got one back just before half-time through the delightfully named Thomas Thomas. In the second half Gillespie completed his hat-trick and Morgan-Owen scored from a corner to make it 5-2.\n\nOnly two of the Scotland eleven would win a second cap that season (Thomson faced Ireland and Miller played against England) and most would never be selected again, including Watson, McKee and hat-trick hero Gillespie.\n\nFor Watson, indeed, this was almost his final football act. He gave up the game in the summer of 1898 and returned to Shotts, where he lived with his wife and a large family, employed as a hewer down the coal mine. It was heavy work which probably contributed to his early death of chronic bronchitis in 1929, aged 56.\n\nJames McKee pictured towards the end of his career at New Brompton (Gillingham)\n\nMcKee, however, had plenty to look forward to. He won the Scottish Qualifying Cup with East Stirlingshire and signed for Bolton Wanderers in 1900 where he was first choice centre forward. In three years he played 81 first division matches, scoring 19 goals, then joined Luton Town for a year, and spent two seasons at New Brompton (Gillingham). He retired from playing in 1906 and returned to Scotland, working as a miner in Harthill where he spent the rest of his life. He never married and was a keen supporter of the local junior team, Polkemmet.\n\nMcKee revealed his Irish birth in the Sunday Post of 29 March 1942 (British Newspaper Archive)\n\nA few years before his death in 1949, McKee told the press that he was the only Irishman to have played for Scotland, but the remark does not seem to have been followed up.\n\nWatson and McKee stand out as there were remarkably few exceptions to the requirement for Scotland players to be born in Scotland, apart from a few 'colonial' caps like Alex Bell (South Africa), Andrew Watson (Guyana) and Eadie Fraser and Joe Kennaway (both Canada).\n\nIn fact, in almost a hundred years between the formation of the Scottish FA in 1873 and the change to eligibility rules in 1971, there were only two other 'rest-of-UK' players. Willie Maley of Celtic, born in Newry, was capped twice in 1893 thanks to a Scottish family background. The other was Jimmy Wardhaugh of Hearts, who played twice for Scotland in the 1950s despite being born on the wrong side of the Berwickshire border.\n\nThis makes it all the more astonishing that two non-Scots played in the same match. There can be little doubt that neither Watson nor McKee would have been capped had the SFA selectors known they were 'foreign'."
