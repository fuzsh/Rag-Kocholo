        "text": "Robert Redford was once described as one of the ‘most attractive’ men in Hollywood and continues to captivate women with his riveting charm and on-screen charisma. He was once a television-cum-stage actor, but achieved humongous success as an actor in Hollywood with films like ‘The Way We Were’, ‘The Milagro Beanfield War’ and ‘Quiz Show’. He received a number of honors throughout his lifetime and even though he is a business plutocrat and environmentalist today, he continues to have women toadying over him, owing to his great panache. The recipient of the honorable ‘Legion d’Honneur’, Redford is the perfect embodiment of ‘old-meets-new’ and continues to enthrall audiences with his captivating presence. Not only was he an actor, he also branched out in a number of other fields related to cinema, particularly film direction and production. During his prime, he starred in a number of classics including ‘The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid’, ‘The Horse Whisperer’ and ‘The Conspirator’. Following these successes, he became a bankable star and the kind of roles he played cemented his position in Hollywood forever. To know all about the childhood, profile career and timeline of this personality, scroll further and keep reading."
