        "text": "At the heart of the American western cinema lies the myth. And the western myth is closely linked to the frontier, that boundary between civilization and wilderness that is constantly being negotiated. The frontier mythology is an integral part of scholarly writing on the western, and especially works well with the classical western of the studio era, where the dichotomy of wilderness and civilization had been considered the key to the genre. The following study will go back to the original term frontier, Frederick Jackson Turner’s concept of frontier mythology and Matthias Waechter’s re-reading of this mythology, and will seek for a new angle to discuss recent westerns in the light of current events. This is necessary as most of the exemples may look like westerns, but most of them are only told in the mode of a western or use the classical form and iconography to aim for something different than in earlier decades. Genre cinema has become more of a discourse today which is not cre...\n\nThis chapter analyzes two recent popular Westerns, Andrew Dominik’s The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007) and Tommy Lee Jones’s The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada (2005). In these films, the Western myth is replaced by a new myth, the ‘American Dream’, in which the lone legend is re-cast as family man and breadwinner. The old American frontier, as well, assumes a new dimension, moving from a utopian ‘frontier’ understood as the symbol of discovery, exploration, and Manifest Destiny, to a dystopian and defensive vision of a national border that must be protected against ‘illegals’. The chapter argues that Westerns, in offering themselves as alternative worlds to\n\nIn the American West was a landmark in the career of New York photographer Richard Avedon and in the history of photography. It consisted in a series of larger-than-life black-and-white portraits of men and women living in rural America, posing in front of an immaculate white background and gazing intently at the camera. Instead of playing to the traditional myth of the openness and grandeur of the West as the title might imply, Avedon had focused his camera on people who were the antithesis of that myth: miners, housewives, farmers, and drifters. Unveiled in 1985 at the Amon Carter Museum, which had commissioned the project, the work was acclaimed and criticized with equal fervor. This paper focuses on the materials employed and the aesthetic choices made by the artist for the printing, mounting, and display of the photographs and their impact on the long-term preservation of the work."
