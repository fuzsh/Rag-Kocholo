But he admits he cannot escape his tartan roots.\n\nHe joked: \"I live in a castle and wear a kilt all the time. As everyone knows, I'm half Irish and half Scottish.\"\n\nWith his blond hair and blue eyes he's always been seen as a typically Californian glamour boy.\n\nBut yesterday Robert, 60, revealed that his dad Charles, like Sean Connery, had been a Scottish milkman.\n\nCharles Redford moved to California in 1936 when he realised he would never make enough money to support a family in the Depression. He followed several Scottish friends out to Santa Monica and set up his own milk delivery business.\n\nIt was there that his son, Charles Robert Redford Jnr, was born a year later.\n\nRedford said: \"I've been to Scotland and my family history has told me a lot about the country. My tartan is Stewart.\"\n\nBut life was just as tough in California and his dad and mum, Martha, struggled to bring up sons Robert and William in what was then a tough, Spanish- speaking town on the outskirts of Los Angeles.\n\nThe boys rarely saw their father because he was always working.\n\nRedford said: \"He was gone in the morning when I went to school and in the afternoon when I came home, so I felt like I never saw him.\"\n\nHis mother, Martha, was the light of his life - he described her as a \"joyous person\" - and pandered to his every whim. It took him years to get over her death when he was just 18.\n\nThe Redford family fortunes improved after the Second World War when Charles landed a job as an accountant at Standard Oil and the family moved to Van Nuys, an industrial town just outside LA.\n\nBut it was here that the young Robert fell in with a gang called the Barrons who broke into Hollywood millionaires' homes for kicks\n\nHis dad dubbed him \"an irresponsible mummy's boy\". Years later, recalling how he had collected his wayward son from police stations, he said: \"I remember one night being called to the local police station to bail him out after he'd been caught on the roof of a convent school for girls.\n\n\"It was another one of his breaking-in pranks that had gone wrong.\"\n\nExasperated, Charles got Robert a summer job working at Standard Oil's shipping yard. By this time Charles was a highly- respected executive and the foreman was happy to oblige.\n\nRobert repaid his father by constantly crawling into crates and catching up on his sleep. He was sacked after several warnings.\n\nCharles said: \"The yard manager, who fired Bob, told him: `Son, you'll never make it with Standard Oil - in fact, you'll never make it anywhere.'\n\n\"The yard manager never lived down that remark. But I must say that, at that time, I would have agreed with him.\n\n\"Bob was very much a mother's boy when he was growing up. He and his mother were inseparable.\n\n\"I was concerned that Bob would grow up irresponsible and I always tried to impress the work ethic on him. He could never keep a job.\n\n\"His mother would defend him saying: `Oh, there's plenty of time for that. Let him enjoy being young.'\"\n\nRobert had just enrolled at the University of Colorado to study baseball when his beloved mother died.\n\nHe dropped out shortly afterwards and went to Europe, where he eked out a living doing pavement paintings for tourists.\n\nMeanwhile his father remarried. His new bride, Helen, was the mother of Robert's best friend, Bill Corder.\n\nFather and son were finally reconciled after Robert decided to become an actor and proved he, too, had the tough Scottish work ethic to make it big.\n\nHe now has one of the best reputations in Hollywood as a director and an actor who has given fine performances in movies like Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, All The President's Men and The Sting.\n\nLater, he turned to directing and won a Best Director Oscar in 1981 for Ordinary People.\n\nHe also set up the Sundance Film Festival for young directors and scriptwriters, named after his 7000- acre ski resort ranch.\n\nLast year he began to give some of his unique experience back to Scotland. He gave the go- ahead for Moonstone, the first European version of Sundance which uses directing and screenwriting labs for young moviemakers.\n\nAndrew Byatt, of the Scottish Actor's Studio, visited Robert at the Sundance Festival and proposed the screenwriting labs in Scotland.\n\nHe said: \"Robert knows and loves Scotland very much. He told me that, when he was younger he cycled around Scotland.\"\n\nHis love of his dad's homeland has drawn Redford to projects that could bring him closer to his dream of making a movie in Scotland.\n\nRedford is notoriously choosy about his films. Like The Horse Whisperer - which premieres at the Edinburgh Film Festival - he has to feel it to be right.\n\nThat is why, in 1993, he chose A River Runs Through It. For him, the script worked because of the Scottish connection.\n\nThe film, which starred Redford lookalike Brad Pitt, is about a Scottish minister's family and their passion for fly- fishing.\n\nRedford said: \"The Scots are a very particular people. They have humour and are wonderful story-tellers -yet they have enormous difficulty in expressing feelings and emotions.\"\n\nRecords on Charles Robert Redford have vanished into history, but he could have been employed by co- operative giants St Cuthberts, of Fountainbridge, Edinburgh.\n\nTheir Bread Street depot was the first workplace of the city's most famous screen hero, a certain Mr Sean Connery.\n\nThe stars and their tartan ties\n\nEveryone in Hollywood, it seems, wants to be a Scot - no matter how flimsy their claims to Caledonian heritage.\n\nComic actress Whoopi Goldberg - real name Johnstone - even said she should be declared a Glaswegian after a visit to the city's Mayfest.\n\nShe said: \"I'm sure I have Scottish blood in me. Johnstone is a real Scots name, and with everything that goes on in my body, it would be no surprise to find a Scotsman in there.\"\n\nGoldberg's former boyfriend Ted Danson also sought out his roots when filming Loch Ness four years ago.\n\nHe discovered his mum, Jessica, was born a MacMaster and his great-grandfather was a labourer in Angus.\n\nBatman star Michael Keaton's real name is Douglas and he lays claim to a distinguished lineage.\n\nHe said: \"I'm half-Scots and honoured to be related to the Black Douglas, loyal friend to Robert The Bruce\n\n\"I'd love to visit Scotland and find out more about him.\"\n\nMel Gibson, of course, played another Scots hero, William Wallace, in Braveheart.\n\nHe said: \"I've got a very Scottish family name, so I may well have Scottish blood.\"\n\nBut one Hollywood star with closer links to Wallace is Ben Affleck, who won an Oscar for Good Will Hunting.\n\nHe reckons he can trace his family back to clansmen who fought with Wallace.\n\nHe said: \"My great-great grandfather was an Affleck who came over to America in the late 1800s.\n\n\"The Affleck family was originally called Auchinleck and people are always reminding me of my Scottishness.\"\n\nVeteran star Mickey Rooney, 77, was born Joe Yuille in Brooklyn after his family left Glasgow to emigrate across the Atlantic.\n\nOn a trip to Scotland two years ago, Rooney said: \"I'm so thrilled to be in my homeland. I'm going to see my roots.\"\n\nOther film stars with tartan links include Charlton Heston, Steve Martin, Robert Duvall, David Duchovny, Donald Sutherland, Carmen Ejogo and Neve Campbell."
