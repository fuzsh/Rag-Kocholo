        "text": "Originally Posted by easthome\n\nThey are not 'Celtic people' they are Europeans with a mixture of god knows what dna - this is not the 6th century AD, each person in Scotland is related to over a MILLION ancestors just 20 generations ago - for all Scots to be 'Celtic people' all of the millions of Scots alive today will need to have all of their MILLION+ ancestors each to have been 'Celtic', do the maths its not happening, unless ALL the Scots have spent the last 2000 years breeding with nothing but other Scots then they are not all 'pure breed Celts'. You can say 'red heads are amongst those that burn the easiest' or even 'Scottish redheads are amongst those that burn the easiest' but it is not true to say 'Scots burn the easiest'. A red headed Spaniard will burn quicker than a dark haired Scot! Can I ask you something Saxonwold? What percentage of Scots would you say have red hair and freckled skin?\n\nOriginally Posted by Bernie20\n\nI'm a person who has fully Irish ancestry for generations. I'm very fair skinned and burn easily. I would categorise myself as \"Celtic\" which means Irish, Scottish, Welsh etc. I don't believe I'm an exception as far as skin type. Most people from the British Isles are fair skinned because they have lived in an environment of little sunshine for centuries. Sure there are people that have come to the Isles recently. I'm Irish and I don't think people like Phil Lynott and Samantha Mumba as less Irish but they obviously have ancestry from outside the British Isles. Most people that are from the British Isles have no outside ancestry for generations. If you constantly try to imply that they do then you are not being honest. When people talk about skin type they are talking about an adaption to climatic conditions. People in the British Isles are not less adapted to their climate than people in Africa.\n\nIt doesn't mean that anyone cannot be included in the modern definition of British but you must realise when people are dicussing a \"British\" skin type they are talkng about a person who has fully ancestry in the British Isles. Surely it is not that difficult to understand? I live in Australia but my phenotype is Irish not Australian Aboriginal. My skintype in Australia is considered \"Celtic\" which means fair and freckled and is not adapted to the climatic conditions of Australia. If I was indigenous to the Australian climate I would not have that skin type but would be dark brown. It has nothing to do with being pure bred but people did adapt to the climate they and their ancestors lived in otherwise there would not be the diversity we see in people. Obviously if some has ancestry from somewhere else they are not indigenous. If someone was part-Aboriginal they would be better adapted to the Australian conditions than someone who is completely foreign like myself."
