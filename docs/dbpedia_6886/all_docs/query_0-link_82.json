        "text": "The First Lady's great-great-great-grandmother, a slave called Melvinia, was made pregnant in 1859 at the age of about 15 by Charles Shields, one of her owners' sons, according to a comprehensive new book.\n\nShields, who was about 20 at the time, was a descendant of Andrew Shields, a protestant Irish immigrant who fought against the British in the American revolutionary war in the late 18th century.\n\nMrs Obama was not aware of the family tree uncovered by the book's author, Rachel Swarns, who also alerted a series of white cousins around the US to their genealogical link to the White House.\n\nSwarns, a New York Times journalist, said several black descendants were concerned Melvinia had been forced into a relationship with Shields.\n\nWhite descendants said they hoped that was not true.\n\n\"I'm appalled at slavery,\" Sherry George, a 61-year-old cousin of Mrs Obama, told the author. \"I know that times were different then. But the idea that one of our ancestors raped a slave ... I would like to know the answer, but I would not like to know that my great-grandfather was a rapist.\"\n\nMrs Obama's bloodline was traced back to Melvinia in 2009 by Megan Smolenyak, a genealogist who has also traced Barack Obama's maternal ancestors back to Moneygall in Ireland.\n\nBut who had fathered Melvinia's biracial son Dolphus, Mrs Obama's great-great grandfather, remained a mystery until Ms Smolenyak and Swarns spent two years researching and carrying out DNA tests.\n\nThey are now confident that the father was Charles, a son of Henry Wells Shields, the cotton, corn and sweet potato farmer who owned Melvinia after inheriting her from his father-in-law in 1852.\n\nValued at $475, Melvinia was transported at the age of about eight from South Carolina to Mr Shields's 200-acre farm in Clayton County, Georgia, where she worked as one of three slaves.\n\nHowever, Swarns discovered that in her 30s or 40s, she returned to South Carolina and was reunited with a couple of fellow slaves from the estate she had worked on as a child before being moved to Georgia.\n\nHer son Dolphus married the couple's daughter, Alice, who is Mrs Obama's great-great-grandmother. Together they moved to Birmingham, Alabama, where Dolphus, who had learned to read and write, worked as a carpenter.\n\nOne of their sons, Robert, who worked as a labourer, had a son, Purnell, who moved north to Chicago, where he fathered Marian, Mrs Obama's mother.\n\nThe ancestry of Melvinia, who died in 1938 in her 90s, remains unclear.\n\nSwarns found that her death certificate stated \"don't know\" in the space for her parents' names.\n\nAnother of Mrs Obama's white distant cousins, Joan Tribble, told the author that she was shocked to discover that her ancestors had owned slaves. \"You really don't like to face this kind of thing,\" said Mrs Tribble, who is 69 and lives in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia. \"I can't really change anything\"."
