It is the second most frequently used given name of ancient Germanic origin.[2][3] It is also in use as a surname. Another commonly used form of the name is Rupert.\n\nAfter becoming widely used in Continental Europe, the name entered England in its Old French form Robert, where an Old English cognate form (Hrēodbēorht, Hrodberht, Hrēodbēorð, Hrœdbœrð, Hrœdberð, Hrōðberχtŕ) had existed before the Norman Conquest. The feminine version is Roberta. The Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish form is Roberto.\n\nRobert is also a common name in many Germanic languages, including English, German, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish, Scots, Danish, and Icelandic. It can be used as a French, Polish, Irish, Finnish, Romanian, and Estonian name as well.\n\nVariations\n\nPopularity and trivia\n\nThe name Robert was a royal name in France, Germany, Scotland and England during the medieval period, and was the name of several kings, dukes, and other rulers and noblemen. It was one of the most popular male names in medieval Europe, likely due to its frequent usage amongst royalty and nobility. To this day, Robert remains one of the most frequently given male names.\n\nRobert was in the top 10 most given boys' names in the United States for 47 years, from 1925 to 1972.[4] While some names become less frequently used due to negative associations, Robert is still widely used despite its connection to many negatively evaluated historical figures.\n\nIt is the fourth most common name in the United States, according to 100 years of Social Security Administration naming and mortality data.[5] There are 3,085,000 males and 13,571 females[6] with this name, for a total of 3,098,571 people with this name.\n\nIn Italy during the Second World War, the form Roberto briefly acquired a new meaning derived from, and referring to the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo Axis.[7]\n\nThe name's second component, *berhta-, is the original root for the modern English word \"bright\".[8]\n\nPeople named Robert\n\nRoyalty\n\nKings of Scotland\n\nRobert the Bruce (1274–1329) (\"Robert I of Scotland\"), king and national hero of Scotland, legendary for his victory at the Battle of Bannockburn, one of the most prominent and skilled warriors of his time who freed Scotland from the English rule during the Wars of Scottish Independence\n\nRobert II of Scotland (Robert Stewart) (1316–1390), one of the principal commanders at the Battle of Halidon Hill\n\nRobert III of Scotland (c. 1337/40–1406)\n\nKings of France\n\nRobert I of France (c.866–923)\n\nRobert II of France (972–1031)\n\nKing of Naples\n\nRobert, King of Naples (1276–1343)\n\nKing of Germany\n\nRobert of Germany (Rupertus, Rex Romanorum) (1352–1410)\n\nKing of Hungary and Croatia\n\nCharles I Robert (1288–1342)\n\nKing of Bulgaria\n\nRobert of Bulgaria, Tsar of the Kingdom of Bulgaria (1894–1943), one of the principal commanders of European theatre of World War II\n\nDukes of Normandy\n\nRobert I, Duke of Normandy (1000–1035), also known as Robert the Magnificent or Robert the Devil; father of William the Conqueror\n\nRobert Curthose (c.1051–1134, son of William the Conqueror, claimant to throne of Kingdom of England.\n\nDuke of Chartres\n\nPrince Robert, Duke of Chartres, Crown Prince of France (1840–1910)\n\nDuke of Parma\n\nRobert I, Duke of Parma (1848–1907)\n\nCount of Flanders\n\nRobert I, Count of Flanders (c.1035–1093)\n\nRobert II, Count of Flanders (c.1065–1111).\n\nCrown Prince of Bavaria\n\nRobert I, crown prince of Bavaria (1869–1955), also known as Prince Rupprecht, last heir apparent to the Bavarian throne.\n\nLatin Emperor\n\nRobert I, Latin Emperor (d. 1228), Emperor of the Latin Empire and Constantinopole\n\nRobert II of Taranto (died 1364), Angevin Dynasty, King of Albania and titular Latin Emperor\n\nDuke of Burgundy\n\nRobert I, Duke of Burgundy (1011–1076)\n\nRobert II, Duke of Burgundy (1248–1306)\n\nDuke of Sicily and Prince of Benevento\n\nRobert Guiscard (c. 1015–1085), Norman nobleman, adventurer and explorer, leader of the conquest of southern Italy and Sicily\n\nPrinces of Capua\n\nRobert I of Capua (died 1120), ruling Prince of Capua\n\nRobert II of Capua (died 1156), ruling Prince of Capua\n\nRobert III of Capua (1153–1158), Prince of Capua\n\nCounts and Lords of Artois\n\nRobert I, Count of Artois (1216–1250), first Count of Artois\n\nRobert II, Count of Artois (1250–1302), one of the principal Commanders of Franco-Flemish War, Battle of Furnes and Battle of Golden Spurs\n\nRobert III of Artois, one of the principal Commanders of Battle of Saint-Omer\n\nRobert III of Artois (1287–1342), Lord of Conches-en-Ouche, of Domfront, and of Mehun-sur-Yèvre, Earl of Richmond\n\nFranconian Babenbergers/Robertian Capetians\n\nRobert II, Count of Hesbaye (died 807), of Worms, Germany (a.k.a.
