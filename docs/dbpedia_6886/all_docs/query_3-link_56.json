        "text": "The Redford Center, a non-profit organization co-founded by activists and filmmakers Robert Redford and James Redford, has selected six environmental filmmakers and film projects for additional funding as part of its Redford Center Grants program. A total of $400,000 will be distributed among these filmmakers, supporting their collective mission to bring attention to environmental issues around the globe.\n\nThe six awarded films cover diverse environmental challenges and solutions. Black Snow uncovers the human cost of coal mining in Siberia, while Bring Them Home follows the journey of the Blackfeet Nation in restoring a wild buffalo herd. Two films explore Mexico, Kay and The Queendom. The former focuses on a Mexican community combating overexploitation and illegal fishing, and the latter delving into the world of fungi in Mexicoâ€™s forests. Meanwhile, Seeing Green explores the intelligence of plants through the stories of scientific renegades, and Undamming Klamath documents the largest dam removal project in history. The Grants Advisory Board selected these projects for their potential impact and innovative storytelling.\n\nOperating on a two-year cycle, the Redford Center Grants program is funded by such organizations as The New York Community Trust, Walton Foundation, Alnoba Lewis Family Foundation, Code Blue Charitable Foundation, Farvue Foundation, Hobson/Lucas Family Foundation, and GoPro, along with numerous individual donors.\n\nAccording to the Center website, the grants have awarded more than $1.3 million in funding for nearly 50 projects, many of which have gone on to receive awards, premieres, and distribution from Netflix, Hulu, HBO, PBS, National Geographic, Sundance Film Festival, Jackson Wild, DC Environmental Film Festival, and others. In addition to financial support, Redford Center Grants provides professional development and access to a board of advisors comprising esteemed environmental and film industry leaders."
