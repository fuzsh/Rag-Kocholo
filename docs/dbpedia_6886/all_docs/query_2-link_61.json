        "text": "A Bridge Too Far - Trailer\n\nLegendary actor Sean Connery brought an end to his James Bond role in 1971 after appearing in Diamonds Are Forever (even though he did return again ten years later for Never Say Never Again). After that, the Scottish star began focusing on some other pictures that excited him. Six years later, he took on a main role in the exciting 1977 picture A Bridge Too Far - which hit ITV 4 screens earlier this month. But when he was initially offered the role of Major General Roy Urquhart he turned it down.\n\nConnery was very interested in the role, and the historical nature of the movie. The film depicted the failed Allied operation in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands during World War II. But the actor was concerned the movie would glorify the military disaster, so he passed on the film.\n\nHowever, director Richard Attenborough would not take no for an answer. He sent Connery the script and urged him to read them. After Connery read the script, he changed his mind. He signed on to play General Urquhart and got stuck into the role.\n\nBut things didn't stay too happy on set for long.\n\nOnce filming began, Connery sat down and started getting to know the other actors in the picture. He was in the movie with some incredible actors including Robert Redford, James Caan, Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier - to name just a few.\n\nBut once the thespians began speaking about their wages, things got heated.\n\nIt didn't take long for Connery to learn that Hollywood star Robert Redford. was earning \"considerably more money\" than he was. And he was utterly furious. (Via IMDB)\n\nTo add insult to injury, Redford's wage looked even bigger considering his role as Major Julian Cook was an extremely small part in A Bridge Too Far.\n\nAfter learning this, Connery felt he had no choice but to act.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He refused to shoot any more scenes until his wages were amended. Eventually, he got his way.\n\nAfter a short while, the actor's wage was \"adjusted to his satisfaction\". He then allowed shooting to resume, content with the knowledge that he was earning as much as Redford, who was working half as much as he was overall.\n\nThis was another stressful footnote in the production of A Bridge Too Far, which had Attenborough struggling to finish the movie over 24 months.\n\nThe director - and star of Jurassic Park - reportedly worked 18-hour days for almost two years straight to get the movie just right.\n\nWhen Attenborough finally finished the film he went to bed and slept for three days.\n\nIt's no wonder, considering how much pressure was on the director. The movie, at the time, was the most expensive picture ever produced and was shot on location at the spots where the events happened in real life.\n\nThankfully, all of his hard work was worth it. A Bridge Too Far was nominated for eight BAFTAS, four of which it won, including Best Sound, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Film Music and Best Cinematography."
