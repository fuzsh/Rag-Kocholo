Before it was released in cinemas, people tended to be proud of having Irish heritage, but Scottish lineage soon became just as popular and trendy thanks to Hollywood.\n\n\"With the Homecoming celebrations this year and a continued Scottish presence in modern culture and the arts, I can't see that changing any time soon.\n\n\"The appeal of looking for Scottish ancestry will be popular for many years and I'm sure we'll see a lot more people highlighting their family history's links back to Scotland.\"\n\nHere's just some of the famous faces with ancestors who once called Scotland home.\n\nBARACK OBAMA\n\nAs with all presidential candidates these days, no branch of Obama's family tree was left unchecked by genealogists.\n\nIn the 44th president's case, the Scottish link is said to come from maternal ancestor Edward Fitzrandolph, who emigrated to America in the 17th century.\n\nHe is also said to be descended from William the Lion, who ruled Scotland between 1165 and 1214.\n\nEMINEM\n\nThe controversial rapper's great-great grandmother comes from Scotland. The Detroit-born hip hop star's granny, Betty, revealed the family can trace their roots back to Edinburgh woman Ailsa Macalister.\n\nShe came to New York with her family in 1870, before moving on to Kentucky two years later.\n\nREESEWITHERSPOON\n\nThe star of Walk The Line can trace her roots to Edinburgh-born Presbyterian minister John Witherspoon, who emigrated to America in 1768.\n\nEight years later, he was one of only two Scottish signatories to the American Declaration of Independence.\n\nHe also spent time in the Ayrshire town of Beith before emigrating, giving developers an excuse to name a new development there Witherspoon Grove.\n\nELVIS PRESLEY\n\nFour years ago, a Scottish author claimed tohave traced Elvis's family tree to blacksmith Andrew Presley, who moved to America from Paisley in 1745.\n\nHis parents married in the Aberdeenshire village of Lonmay in 1713.\n\nMost of the Presleys in Scotland in the 18th and 19th centuries came from Aberdeenshire.\n\nRONALD REAGAN\n\nThe 40th US president had ancestors who came from Paisley. Claud Wilson and his bride, Peggy Downie, were married in the town's Castlehead Church in 1807.\n\nAnd that was why Reagan attended a service in the church in 1991 with his wife, Nancy, wearing a tartan jacket and singing Amazing Grace with other worshippers.\n\nJAY LENO\n\nThe US talk show king was born James Douglas Muir Leno. His mum, film-maker Catherine Muir, emigrated to America with her family from Greenock when she was 11.\n\nShe married Jay's Italian father, Angelo Leno, and the couple settled in Massachusetts.\n\nROBERT REDFORD\n\nThe 72-year-old actor and director says his father was an Edinburgh milkman who emigrated to California, where he later switched careers and became an accountant for an oil company.\n\nIt was there he met his wife and Redford's mother, Martha.\n\nGLEN CAMPBELL\n\nThere can be few Americans who are prouder of their Scottish roots than the country music legend.\n\nWhen he was young, his father would tell him of his Scottish ancestry and the whole family would sing Scottish songs.\n\nGlen can trace his family back seven generations to the Argyll Campbells, and he took up playing the bagpipes after first visiting Scotland in 1974.\n\nJOHNNY CASH\n\nThe man in black once described Scotland as his \"ancestral home\" on TV. Indeed, he is descended from a Scottish seaman namedWilliam Cash, who settled in Salem, Massachusetts, in 1612.\n\nBut the family can trace their roots right back to 12thcentury king of Scotland, Malcolm IV.\n\nCash's singer song writer daughter Roseanne admits she still has a strong connection to Fife where the family originated from.\n\nDONALD TRUMP\n\nSince announcing plans to build a massive pounds 300million golf and leisure resort in Aberdeenshire, Trump has been keen to point out that his mother, Mary MacLeod, came from Stornoway.\n\nBorn in 1912, she grew up on a croft on the Isle of Lewis with parents William and Catherine, before moving to New York in her twenties.\n\nIt was there she met Donald's father, Frederick Trump, who would himself soon become a millionaire.\n\nBILL CLINTON\n\nClinton might not sound like a Scottish name, but the former president was actually born William Jefferson Blythe.\n\nHis father, of the same name, died in a car crash before he was born, and the young Bill later took his stepfather's surname, Clinton.\n\nAnother line of Clinton's family tree has the surname Ayers, and both give him Scottish-Irish ancestry. Along with Obama and Reagan, Clinton is one of 15 US presidents to have Scottish roots.\n\nCelebrate your history\n\nTHE Homecoming Scotland celebrations began with the 250th anniversary of the birth of Robert Burns and will continue until St Andrew's Day on November 30.\n\nHere's a taste of some of the events taking place during 2009.\n\nThe Burns celebrations include a touring exhibition entitled Zig Zag: The Paths Of Robert Burns, which features manuscripts, paintings and museum artifacts.\n\nCreative Burns in Kilmarnock will showcase a series of major new commissions by leading Scottish artists.\n\nAncestry is celebrated throughout the country in events such as In The Footsteps Of The Reivers Festival, which celebrates the history of the Borders.\n\nScotland's People Centre, in the heart of Edinburgh, has access to millions of documents dating from the 16th century, including births, deaths and marriages.\n\nThe Angus And Dundee Roots Festival will provide a focus for people with ancestral roots in the region.\n\nNorth East Clan Fortnight starts on July 18 with a ball held in the 13th century ancestral clan seat of Drum Castle.\n\nThe Gathering 2009 takes place in Edinburgh on July 25 and 26, featuring members from 140 clans, Highland Games and a mass of pipers.\n\nThe Spirit Of Speyside Whisky Festival, which starts on May 1, offers 10 days of unique events.\n\nStarting on September 18, The Isle Of Barra Whisky Galore Festival will bring the spirit of the legendary film to this Hebridean outpost.\n\nVisit www.homecomingscotland2009.com\n\n'A lot of the interest is because Scotland has a public profile around the world'\n\nCAPTION(S):\n\nHONOURED: Robert Burns; CAPITAL: Eminem has an Edinburgh connection; CALEDONIAN LINKS: Clockwise from top left, Johnny Cash, Donald Trump, Robert Redford, Barack Obama, Elvis Presley and Reese Witherspoon"
