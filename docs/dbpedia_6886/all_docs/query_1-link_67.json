Welcome to the world of the “mock jocks”, those phoney Scots we love to adopt because they are famous, glamorous and ate a piece of shortbread in 1992.\n\nFor the record, the facts are these: Moore is not from Greenock. She was born Julie Anne Smith, and her father’s military background meant she was brought up in 12 countries. None of them was Scotland. None of them is trying to claim her as their long-lost Oscar-nominated daughter.\n\nMoore’s mother, a psychiatric social worker, left Scotland for New Jersey when she was two. Her mother that is, not Julie Anne, who only visited Dunoon at the turn of the 1990s,"
