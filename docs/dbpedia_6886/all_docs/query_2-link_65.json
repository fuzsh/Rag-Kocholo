        "text": "By Scott Ross\n\nAs ever, click on the highlighted links for complete reviews &cet.\n\nA Star is Born (1937) The first of (so far) four identically-titled variations on the theme of upward/downward pop stardom. The movie seems to get remade every 20 or 30 years, as popular tastes and styles and the modes of stardom change; I suppose the next edition will highlight internet “influencers.”\n\nI missed the Streisand-Kristofferson edition in 1976 and, having no interest in either Bradley Cooper or Lady Gaga, do not expect to see the most recent iteration, but I have seen the picture that predated and seems to have inspired A Star is Born, the 1932 George Cukor-directed What Price Hollywood? in which the doomed romance was between a young starlet (Constance Bennett) and an older, alcoholic director (Lowell Sherman). The most striking aspect of Cukor’s picture is the way, a moment before Sherman pulls the trigger on the gun with which he shoots himself, a remarkable series of flashing images fills the screen — the final, fleeting thoughts of a suicide. (It’s the sort of thing that ought to make the auteurists swoon.) There is nothing as interesting in the 1937 A Star is Born, although admirers of the 1954 Judy Garland musical remake will note that it follows the second half of the original extremely closely, with nearly identical sequences and dialogue, or anyway until James Mason’s swim out to sea and the assault on Garland by her fans at his funeral. The first half is more labored, and dated, not least in Janet Gaynor’s twinkling performance, her tight, marcelled look, the clichéd opening scenes and the ugly early Technicolor process in which the movie was photographed, which likewise contributed to the artistic failure, also in 1937, of Nothing Sacred, like Star is Born directed by William A. Wellman, produced by David O. Selznick and starring Fredric March.\n\nMarch, one of America’s most interesting actors (if, like Robert Ryan, never quite the popular star he should have been) grounds the role of Norman Maine so thoroughly that his decline, which can seem like a scenarist’s contrivance, becomes devastating; the haunted look he expresses as he embraces Gaynor a final time, is among the most breathtaking human images in American movies. Wellman, who worked on the story with Robert Carson, directed intelligently and with surprising sensitivity, especially in the camper honeymoon scene between March and Gaynor. The screenplay, credited to Carson, Dorothy Parker and Parker’s husband Alan Campbell, gets better as it goes along, although, as with the character in 1954, I don’t buy the studio head Oliver Niles (Adolphe Menjou) as a gentle, kindly old thing — just try to imagine Samuel Goldwyn or Harry Cohn, purring the way Menjou does. Worse, however, is Lionel Stander’s miscasting as the production chief Matt Libby. In the Garland-Mason version, Jack Carson as Libby expressed as much charm as nastiness, and his readings had an almost Cowardian sophistication; Stander barks and growls like a New Jersey dockworker who has unaccountably found himself employed behind the notions counter at Harrod’s. Aside from March, the best acting is done by May Robson in the impossible role of Gaynor’s no-nonsense grandmother Lettie. Andy Devine, of all people, plays Gaynor’s Hollywood confidante while Peggy Wood, Guinn “Big Boy” Williams, Francis Ford, Edgar Kennedy and Clara Blandick, later immortal as Dorothy Gale’s Auntie Em, have small but telling roles. Kenneth Howell, appearing as an injured teenage drunk in the courtroom sequence, looks heartbreakingly young to have smashed up his life so badly, and is movingly grateful for the suspended sentence the judge (Jonathan Hale) bestows on him.\n\nHatari! (1962) An overlong but extravagantly entertaining collaboration between John Wayne, Howard Hawks and the scenarist Leigh Brackett about a team of hunters in Africa. The kicker is that they are not shooting the animals but capturing them for zoos, which must have seemed refreshing in 1962, although it’s less reassuring today, when increasing numbers of people see zoos as little more than prisons for exotic beasts, maintained for the public’s dubious (and frankly, repulsive) benefit. We wouldn’t put a human being behind bars for our own edification, so why should a rhinoceros be any different? The means by which Wayne’s team traps the creatures are also antiquated: Running the animals to exhaustion in all-terrain vehicles. (They use tranquilizers now.) Yet the chase sequences, thrillingly filmed by Russell Harlan and kinetically edited by Stuart Gilmore, are among the most exciting Hawks ever directed, with the actors clearly doing the work and putting themselves in danger while doing so. (Although Wayne was reportedly, and quite understandably, terrified sitting in that external seat with nothing to protect him from danger but a seatbelt, he doesn’t show it.) In typical Hawksian manner, into this largely male enclave comes an attractive outsider (Elsa Martinelli) while two of the team (Hardy Krüger and Gérard Blain) battle each other for the affections of a girl (Michèle Girardon) who isn’t interested in either of them. The Girardon subplot is mildly diverting but Martinelli is so obviously out of her element (whatever that might have been) that she becomes a beautiful embarrassment; her character is meant to be appealing but you cringe every time she goes on one of her irrational crying jags. By the end of it, arrived at via an unfunny chase sequence, you long for Wayne to kick her in the seat of her pants, or at least send her back to Italy. Instead, he marries her. Go figure.\n\nHenry Mancini composed a lively score, with a sinuous, percussion-driven main theme and some charming interludes including the famous “Baby Elephant Walk.” Sometime around 1965 I heard Mancini’s infectious recording on the radio and it so delighted me I began walking around hunched over with my arms in front of my face for a trunk and the tips of my fingers brushing the floor, moving joyously in time to the music. I can’t touch the floor that way today, but the piece still makes me smile.\n\nThe Killer Elite (1975) A standard ’70s thriller from Sam Peckinpah’s late, booze-and-coke period, elevated by its cast and their director’s self-identification with the material. The script by Marc Norman and Stirling Silliphant follows the basic contours of its source, the pseudonymous novel Monkey in the Middle, in which the espionage agent Mike Locken is not killed but deliberately wounded by an assassin, accepts a new assignment during his physical rehabilitation to smoke out the killer and gradually comes to realize he’s being played by his duplicitous superior. In the book, the figure Locken is assigned to protect and to spirit out of England is a charismatic African leader hopeful of taking advantage of unrest in his (fictional) nation to bring about a democratic change. In the movie it’s a Chinese dissident, although we’re never really sure where he comes from, where he’s hoping to go, what he expects to do or even what he represents to the people of his country. This is seen by Peckinpah’s critics as a sign of his contempt for the material he’s been offered and there may be some truth to that. To Pauline Kael (“Notes on the Nihilist Poetry of Sam Peckinpah,” The New Yorker, 4 January 1976) the attraction to the script for the filmmaker was his identification with the professional at its center, whored out by pimps (i.e., United Artists and Mike Medavoy, who got him the job as a favor) with whom he had to battle, eternally engaging in subterfuge and sly satire of the creeps to whom he owed his livelihood. I suspect that’s closer to the mark, especially considering the paranoia cocaine engenders in its users. Someone — and I have no idea whether it was Norman, Silliphant or Peckinpah — made the wounding assassin Locken’s best friend and colleague, upping the personal ante, and switched the locale to San Francisco and the African leader to a Chinese national. It was Silliphant, however, who insisted his wife Tiana Alexandra be cast as the man’s daughter, and she’s so bad in the picture, and was from what one hears aggressively unpleasant to boot, that her role was reduced in scope and made to look ridiculous, as when she informs James Caan’s Locken, unbidden, that she’s a virgin and is promptly told by him that he doesn’t give a shit.\n\nGiven these conditions, and limitations, and Peckinpah’s coke addiction, the wonder is that The Killer Elite is so entertaining. (Watching the picture a second time with the commentary track on, the Brahman snottiness of Paul Seydor, who makes his own contempt for it quite clear from the beginning, made me like the thing even more.)* The picture sometimes looks cheap — considering his filmography, the budget for this one was shockingly low — and is, overall, less violent and bloody than might be expected. (The sequence in which Caan’s wounds are operated on is the most disturbing in the movie.) Yet there are moments in it that resonate, especially the imposing setting for the climax: The U.S. Navy “mothball fleet” off Suisun Bay. Those huge, empty battleships, slowly rotting in the California sun, provide such a ghostly, unnerving backdrop I’m surprised the government permitted Peckinpaw to film there. There is beautifully lucid cinematography by Philip Lathrop and splendid performances by Caan, Robert Duvall as his betrayer, Arthur Hill as their commander, Gig Young as his superior, Mako as the enigmatic Chinese and Bo Hopkins as Locken’s chief gunman. Burt Young gives a Burt Young performance as Locken’s driver, complete with unintentional mispronunciations, and as Caan’s love-interest Kate Heflin has, alas, the same physiognomy as her father Van. The typically dark Jerry Fielding score is one of his finest of the period.\n\nSons of the Desert (1934) With Way Out West one of Laurel and Hardy’s two best features. The boys want to travel to their lodge’s convention in Chicago, Ollie’s wife won’t let him go, the pair pretend they’re sailing to Honolulu on a rest-cure cruise for Ollie and, once they get back, are horrified to discover that the ship they are supposed to be on has sunk at sea. At an hour and 4 minutes it’s among the most tightly-packed of sound comedies and the comic sequences are beautifully worked-out. (The credited screenwriter was Frank Craven, later the originator of the Stage Manager in Thornton Wilder’s Our Town, and the uncredited scenarists included Stan Laurel, Charley Chase, Glenn Tryon, Hal Roach and the director, William A. Seiter.) Chase has a great role as an obnoxious conventioneer, Mae Busch is exceptionally funny as Ollie’s formidable wife, Dorothy Christy is both handsome and commanding as Stan’s gun-toting spouse and the sharp of eye can spot Ellen Corby in the Chicago nightclub to which the boys retire and the young Robert Cummings in the steamship office. The print on the recent Laurel & Hardy: The Definitive Restorations Blu-ray is a revelation, making Kenneth Peach’s sharp black-and-white images fairly shimmer.\n\nSons of the Desert, by the way, later became the name of the International Laurel & Hardy Society, founded by the team’s first important biographer, John McCabe, in 1965. Al Kilgore devised the official escutcheon and Stan himself suggested the motto which translated from the Latin is, appropriately, “Two minds without a single thought.”\n\nDownhill Racer (1969) A curious mix of (then) new-style filmmaking and old-fashioned dramaturgy. Brian Probyn’s widescreen cinematography is, in the skiing sequences, astounding, and must have been a knockout on a big theater screen; the camera gives the viewer so close a view of the experience of racing you feel as if you have become the athlete. I don’t know how this was managed, particularly since Downhill Racer predates by years the development of the Steadicam, but I assume that, somehow, the movie camera was attached to either skis or skier. You may feel, at the end of each sequence, as if you have stopped breathing until the concluding seconds.\n\nUnfortunately, all of this technical virtuosity is wedded to a screenplay by the novelist James Salter (A Sport and a Pastime) that wallows in cliché, fitfully camouflaged with trendy sex, his specialty. Chappellet, the cold, ambitious athlete at its center (the ambitious are always cold in American movies) is a cipher, the worldly European (Camilla Sparv) with whom he has a seemingly passionate affair is a fraud, his coach (Gene Hackman) could have been played by Pat O’Brien in the 1940s and there is little reason, aside from the movie’s undeniable visual excitement, to care whether Chappellet wins his Olympic race or not. The skier, played with a combination of intensity and cool by Robert Redford, regards his fellow Olympic team members as impediments to his own achievement, and even discovering that he came by his taciturn nature honestly — that his farmer father (Walter Stroud) is as closed off and uncommunicative as his son — does little to make us care about the skier. Considering the parade of platitudes he was given to recite, Hackman makes the coach a vivid presence, and the other skiers include Kenneth Kirk, Jerry Deexter and the young Dabney Coleman. Kenyon Hopkins, who did splendid work as the composer for 12 Angry Men, The Hustler and, especially, The Fugitive Kind, wrote a score of crashing badness for Downhill Racer, one that over-emphasizes every action and reaches crescendos of barely-contained hysteria just before the picture’s several skiing accidents. It’s almost shockingly poor music to have come from so gifted a source and one wonders whether the director, Michael Ritchie, trying to salvage his dramatically inert movie, insisted on it.\n\nThe Love Parade (1929) One of the very few early talkie musicals that not only still holds up but gives you a real sense of how much the musical could accomplish in the hands of people who knew what they were doing. Maurice Chevalier plays a Graustarkian Count assigned to a diplomatic post in Paris who (we are told) has succumbed so thoroughly to the the charms of the City of Light he’s lost his original accent and gained a thick French one. When he’s recalled to his country as a result of his scandalous behavior, the Queen (Jeanette MacDonald), whose lack of a husband is the primary concern of the entire nation, falls for him. At this point, the logical next step for the people who wrote these sorts of things would have been to have placed impediments between the two that prevented their union. Here they marry, and only then do their problems begin.\n\nThis sort of nonsense requires enormous charm from the performers and a corresponding level of wit from the creators to keep you engaged instead of asking niggling logical questions that take your attention away from the people on the screen. The Love Parade had what was needed in all departments: From Maurice Chevalier as the Count, from Guy Bolton’s script, from the Victor Schertzinger-Clifford Grey song score and, especially, from Ernst Lubitsch’s direction. (Even Jeanette MacDonald, by whose looks I am slightly repelled and towards whose Melpomenic extravagances I am at best lukewarm, is rather engaging.) Bolton was an old hand at such things; with P.G. Wodehouse and Jerome Kern he had originated the small, “modern” Broadway musical in the Princess Theatre shows of the 1920s, which eschewed the operetta style, replacing its big choral elements with more intimate numbers and developed in colloquialism an alternative to the fustian pomposity of the Victor Herbert and Rudolph Friml school. The Love Parade doesn’t take itself seriously for a moment; it has the witty irrelevancy of a Wodehouse fable, and this extends to the often blissfully silly songs, such as when Chevalier sings “Paris, Stay the Same” and is toasted by the many soignée women with whom he’s been involved. Not only does his valet (Lupino Lane) take up the refrain, echoed by the chambermaids with whom he has been dallying, the valet’s French bulldog and his grieving bitches also join in.\n\nIf I have a complaint about the picture it’s due to Lane’s broad, extravagantly loose-limbed style of performance, so beloved of West End theatregoers of the time. I was equally annoyed 35 years ago by the reproduction of that style in the revival of his inexplicably popular musical Me and My Girl whose idiotic book, stunningly to me, Stephen Fry was credited with revising. Lane on screen almost makes me pine for El Brendel; fortunately, he’s paired with the charming Lillian Roth. While the songs are, overall, not as catchy as the numbers Rodgers & Hart wrote three years later for Love Me Tonight, Schertzinger and Grey came up with a charming title song and, in “Dream Lover,” a standard that recurs in orchestral versions in seemingly dozens of later Paramount pictures including Billy Wilder’s American debut as a writer-director, The Major and the Minor. Grey’s lyrics, like Bolton’s dialogue, are dazzlingly brazen sexually, achieving with strong innuendo what rappers would one day spell out explicitly. (Guess whose lyrics are more enchanting?) “Nobody’s Using It Now” could have been written by Cole Porter at his most erotically playful — it reminds me a bit of both “Nobody’s Chasing Me” and “I Sleep Easier Now” from Porter’s later Out of This World — and “My Love Parade” is nearly as intoxicating as the Rodgers & Hart “Lover.” Although The Love Parade was only his third talkie, Lubtisch brought such assurance to the picture you’d think he’d been making musical comedies for years. It contains the qualities we most associate with him: The deliciously louche attitude toward sex, the sunniness of outlook and the astonishingly adult intelligence of the material. This may have been the picture that caused Lubitsch to remark that he’d been to Paris, France and to Paris, Paramount and preferred the latter.\n\nThief (1981) Michael Mann’s striking debut as a writer-director has the cool, dark, blue-accented cinematography we associate with pictures like Manhunter and Heat, although Mann only worked with the cinematographer Donald E. Thorin this once. James Caan, is the titular figure, and he gives an intense, perfectly-scaled performance of a man who because of his background is incapable of surrendering his independence, an inflexible philosophy that virtually ensures the loss of everything he values. Caan’s Frank (no last name is ever given) is frighteningly, if explicably, mercurial, and at the climax he destroys the entire edifice he has painstakingly built from a prison fantasy of what constitutes a successful life. Thief is rigorously logical, and intelligent. It’s also beautifully cast, with Tuesday Weld as Frank’s tremulous yet forceful wife, Willie Nelson in the small but affecting role of Frank’s prison mentor, Jim (billed as James) Belushi as his closest cohort and, in a quietly terrifying performance, Robert Prosky as the mob boss who slowly insinuates himself into Frank’s life, with cataclysmic results. The movie is impressively shot and put together, and when you see something like the gaudy lights of mercantile Chicago reflected off the hood of Frank’s shiny luxury model car as he makes a fateful night drive the image achieves a kind of metallic poetry and metaphorical potency denied to what my friend Eliot M. Camarena refers to as the “Look-a-me!” gyrations of a Martin Scorsese.\n\nPack Up Your Troubles (1932) This cleverly conceived Laurel and Hardy feature, written by the old L & H hand H. M. Walker and competently directed by George Marshall and Raymond McCarey (Leo’s brother) is sometimes charming but ultimately a little too sentimental for its own good. It trades on Chaplinesque emotion (specifically from The Kid) and even, in its First World War trench sequence, a bit on Chaplin’s social realism (Shoulder Arms) and you nay wish it was a great deal funnier than it is. There are, however, compensations, as there nearly always are with Stan and Ollie, especially during a sequence in which the pair manage, innocently, to utterly demolish a wedding. While she’s no Jackie Coogan, little Jacquie Lyn is remarkably ingenuous as the orphaned daughter of a dead soldier and the good supporting cast includes Don Dillaway, Mary Carr, James Finlayson, Grady Sutton, C. Montague Shaw, Billy Gilbert, Adele Watson and, in an unsettling scene, Richard Cramer as a wife-beating thug. As usual, Stan did uncredited work on the script, and (also as usual) I presume the more gruesome gags in the picture were his.\n\nAmerican Masters — Mike Nichols (2016) Whenever I see the photo, above, of Nichols as a child with his mother in Germany I am struck by the pensiveness of his expression. Is the future director judging the family sedan critically, with an eye to how he might make it perform better? Whatever else may be said of Nichols’ work, in movies and in the theatre, it was and is seldom less than intelligent; you can no more imagine him directing a slobby, panting sex comedy like Porky’s than you can picture Stephen Sondheim composing “You Light Up My Life,” except perhaps as a parody.† Rediscovering as an adult my early appreciation for Mike Nichols’ often extraordinary achievements caused me to realize that, along with a goodly amount of the usual dross children and the young embrace and which embarrasses them to confront in their later maturity, there was much I rightly appreciated from a young age. Unfortunately, I had then allowed others — usually but not always, critics — to turn me from my early enthusiasms, or in any case to find them suspect. I number among those pleasures, happily regained in adulthood, the work of Billy Wilder, Blake Edwards, William Goldman, Bob Fosse, Peter Bogdanovich and Alfred Hitchcock, the early enthusiasm for which my reading of (among others) Pauline Kael, John Simon, Dwight MacDonald and the forenamed Mr. Goldman, had dampened. (Although they were correct about his ponderous later work.) In the middle of Goldman’s seminal 1968 book The Season: A Candid Look at Broadway lies a withering chapter on Nichols’ alleged facile slickness, which I blush to admit caused me, at 16, to look at movies I had previously venerated (The Graduate, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?) with a jaundiced eye. In his splendid biography of Nichols, Mark Harris suggests it might take an entire book to try getting at what Goldman was so outraged about. Was Nichols’ then nearly unbroken string of successes what really chapped Goldman’s ass?\n\nIf William Goldman expected Mike Nichols’ piper to be paid eventually, he soon got his wish: The expensive, ill-advised 1970 movie of Catch-22 ended one of the longest winning-streaks in American popular culture, from the early success of Nichols’ partnership with Elaine May to his direction of a string of Neil Simon’s theatrical hits (Barefoot in the Park, The Odd Couple, Plaza Suite) to the movies that cemented his status as a seemingly unstoppable wunderkind. (Frankly, if there was a facile artist at work here, it was more often Simon than Nichols.) Carnal Knowledge, with Jules Feiffer, was a modest hit, but The Day of the Dolphin and The Fortune bombed, and Nichols returned to the theatre, where he remained for years. We don’t have his theatre work to study, of course, as we do his movies, but despite what his critics saw as shallow facility (shades of the fraternity’s collective attitude towards Fosse… and William Goldman) what Nichols was really up to, and what he understood better than nearly anyone, was human behavior. It’s at the core of his and May’s often wildly funny improvisations; no matter how hard they make us laugh, their routines first cause us to us recognize their characters’ sharply-delineated humanity. That’s what made them so damned funny. When, during a sketch at the 1959 Emmy awards May presented Nichols (as one Lyle Glutz) with a trophy for being “the most total mediocrity in the industry” and his character exulted, “This is the proudest moment of my life!” you just knew that it was.\n\nMay includes that moment in the “American Masters” portrait of Nichols, which she put together, and it’s one of the few performance clips in the show. Whatever its lofty intentions, the series has an unfortunate tendency. not just to hagiography (and in that Mike Nichols is no exception) but to formula: Here is the artist, and we will now present countless talking-heads to praise him. Instead, May’s “American Masters” segment relies largely on video footage from a Julien Schlossberg interview with Nichols to tell his story — or rather, to let Nichols tells Nichols’ story. There are few pleasures in contemporary life as complete as watching a Mike Nichols interview, and hearing him reminisce about his life, his aimless (or anyway, formless) early experience with the Compass Players (later the Second City), the years with May and what he thought he was doing in the theatre and in movies, as opposed to what commentators believed he was up to, is as satisfying a way to spend an hour as any divertissements I have enjoyed in years. May’s brief snippets of other interviews add little to our understanding of Nichols, and two of them put me in a minor rage; the only thing more maddening than having to listen to that part-time actor (and, apparently, full-time CIA asset) Tom Hanks blather on about Charlie Wilson, who as much as anyone aside from Zbigniew Brzeziński was responsible for the ongoing disaster of American involvement in the Middle East,‡ is hearing Hanks’ pal Spielberg talk about his teenage auteurism, as if he were the only young person in history to have made an 8-millimeter home movie. Fortunately, there are few such lapses, and they are brief. May honors her old compatriot, one-time lover and lifelong friend in a way I suspect he would have appreciated, or at least not been too embarrassed about.\n\nBrief Encounter (1945) There are few popular movies as thoroughly worked-out as this Noël Coward-David Lean collaboration about a pair of married strangers who meet by chance in a railway refreshment room, fall in love, flirt with a physical dalliance and part in an agonizingly ironic manner. Yet despite its schematic nature, and some embarrassingly over-cooked dialogue, particularly for Trevor Howard as the masculine partner in the love-affair, the picture has a strangely compelling integrity. You care, not only for the guilt-ridden lovers but for the lives they have built with others and which neither is sanguine about upsetting and the end, when it comes, is almost unbearably moving.\n\nLean, whose directorial career at this point in the 1940s was entirely yoked to Coward’s writing (In Which We Serve, This Happy Breed and Blithe Spirit preceded Brief Encounter) directed as if the script had no theatrical origin. Coward — in association with Lean, Anthony Havelock-Allan and Ronald Neame — adapted it from the one-act Still Life, one of the nine playlets making up his three-part omnibus Tonight at 8:30 in which he’d starred with Gertrude Lawrence, but his director seldom sees a proscenium arch. Only at the climax, when he plays with lighting effects to heighten the anguish Johnson is going through does he betray any overt sense of theatre, and he immediately upends this, almost literally, by tilting the camera to suggest the emotional upheaval the character is going through as she stands unsteadily and hurtles herself at the refreshment room door. Brief Encounter is a picture that, while staged on fabricated sets, feels unbound by conventional settings (much of it was filmed at the Carnforth railway station in Lancashire). It is also unconcerned with prevailing modes of beauty: although Johnson is an attractive woman neither she nor Howard can be said to be a glamour-puss, and when her character is overtaken by a suicidal urge, Lean films her in the aftermath in the most unflattering manner imaginable, her hair flying over her face and forehead, giving the figure a look of utter despair that matches what she is feeling, and what the actress is expressing, at that moment.\n\nJohnson, who in her private journals expressed strong reservations both about the script and her own performance, has exceptional poise and nothing she does strikes the wrong note. In a way her character represents a comforting, repressed portrait of married middle-class British respectability; Laura Jesson is the sort of person I doubt Coward associated with past his adolescence but which he felt compelled, I suppose, to uphold, since her type doubtless represented more than half his core theatrical audience. What’s admirable about her is her resilience, which has strength but not rigidity. She feels guilt over her attraction to Howard’s Alec Harvey, and she only ever permits her feelings to take her so far and no further… but even here I’m not being entirely fair to her, since she would succumb to Alec’s gentle blandishments but for an unfortunate event of mistiming. There is much we project onto Johnson, especially in the beautifully staged sequence on the train where she gazes from her window at the passing scenery and fantasizes a life with Alec. Except for her smile of pleasure toward the end she could be thinking of almost anything and the scene would work. (She, and Trevor Howard, are also blessedly mature, then as now most often an impediment to a financially successful romance.)\n\nHoward is equally impressive, although he has occasionally to struggle with some of the script’s most purple dialogue. (Although billed as “Noël Coward’s Brief Encounter,” there is no screenplay credit in the main titles, and it’s notable that Lean, Havelock-Allan and Neame, not Coward, shared the Academy Award nomination the picture received for its script.) Lean and others later claimed Howard was one of the stupidest men they’d ever known, which I admit shocked me a little as I had always thought he projected rare intelligence. In later years Lean wished he’d cut the scenes between the refreshment room proprietor played by Joyce Carey and Stanley Holloway’s ticket inspector but they give the story a needed levity, providing sharp contrast as well to the clandestine lovers. Robert Krasker’s cinematography is among the best war-time jobs on either side of the Atlantic, crisp yet expansive, and although the use of Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2 feels a bit overdone, especially now that his sort of heavy romanticism has largely faded from popular consciousness. Still, its yearning qualities are nicely expressed by the pianist Eileen Joyce.\n\nCharley and the Angel (1973) I was taken to see this comic Disney fantasy almost exactly 51 years ago and enjoyed it enough to request that our local library order a copy for me via inter-library loan of the book on which it was based, Will Stanton’s The Golden Evenings of Summer. Stanton’s book is essentially a collection of short stories in which the narrator recalls one Depression summer of his pubescence, but it’s not a children’s novel although a child of 12, as I then was, could certainly read and enjoy it. I read it again when I was in my early 20s, have just re-read it, and it remains one of the funniest books of my experience. Stanton had not merely the imaginative slant on life, even fancifully remembered life, that helps constitute great humorous writing, but a sense of the absurd and of comic rhythms. Like a great comedian he knew how to phrase a joke, how to build a comedic line, and how to explode it at the punch. In a way his novel reminds me of My Life and Hard Times, although I don’t claim Stanton is the equal of James Thurber. His collection of vignettes about life in a small Iowa town in the early 1930s has, however, the same outlandish sense of good humor Thurber imbued to his fictionalized family memoir of an Ohio boyhood.\n\nI don’t know if there was any way to translate Stanton’s literary achievement, minor though it may have been, to a performance medium. Possibly a nice play could be made from the stories in The Golden Evenings of Summer, although it would lose a great deal of physical detail and action, particularly regarding the two brothers, aged 12 and 10, and the broken-down jalopy they buy from a disgruntled farmer for a nickel. Probably the only means of replicating much of what makes the book so treasurable would be to use narration to retain some of Stanton’s more amusing observations and to connect the individual stories, as Woody Allen did with the vignettes in Radio Days. That’s if you want to perform an act of transliteration; if you want instead to make a Christmas Carol-type fantasy in which a cold husband and father becomes, with the threat of an early demise hanging over his head, a better man thanks to the intervention of a heavenly presence, you make Charley and the Angel.\n\nWhat’s best about the picture from a thematic point of view are the occasional lines and characters the screenwriter, Roswell Roger, took from Stanton’s book, although even there it’s a matter of ellipses, as when George Lindsey’s handyman Pete shows up: His dialogue, and the shape of the character’s outlines, are either from the book or in imitation of its style, but he’s a “funny type” merely. Missing is his entire raison d’etre as a character, and the boys’ relationship to him. Similarly the filmmakers lost the numerous family discussions in the book, which become a dizzying comic motif, Father’s stubborn pragmatism butting up against not only Mother’s no-nonsense stoicism but as well daughter Leonora’s blank self-absorption (a dazed “What?” is how she inevitably answers any direct question put to her) and younger son Rupert’s zany yet somehow unassailable 10-year old’s logic. Where in the book the boys run unwitting errands for bootleggers in that 5-cent jalopy, in the movie the gangsters turn on them, taking the family hostage so that father Charley (Fred MacMurray) can prove his worth by saving them. (Need I add that this is preceded by the then-standard comic chase which seemed to climax every Disney comedy of the era?) The picture is also curiously uncertain about its own time-frame. At the beginning mother Nettie (Cloris Leachman) observes that summer is coming to a close yet later it’s made clear that Father’s Day has not yet arrived.\n\nSo much for what the movie isn’t. For what it is, Harry Morgan provides an amiable blend of amiability and, if this is not an oxymoron, disappointed playfulness as the celestial visitor. MacMurray lends his inimitable voice and fatherly comic mien to Charley, and if he does no more than what he’d done a dozen times before, that was why he was hired. As Nettie, Leachman was a surprising but pleasing choice, although after years of enjoying her as Phyllis Lindstrom, in 1973 I found her dark chestnut hair-job a little disconcerting, and still do. If Leachman was a bottle-blonde she was correct to be so; the honey shade she usually sported softened the sharpness of her features and made her look a bit less hard. As the older and younger brother respectively, Vincent Van Patten and Scott Kolden are likeable, but Kurt Russell is largely wasted as their sister’s beau. The typically strong Disney supporting cast includes, aside from Lindsey, Edward Andrews, Richard Bakalyan (as one of the gangsters, naturally), Mills Watson (as the other one), Barbara Nichols, Liam Dunn, Larry D. Mann, George O’Hanlon, the funny-voiced Susan Tolsky as a young biddy, Ed Begley Jr., Pat Delaney and Bob Hastings, with Harold Peary heard as the unctuous host of a children’s radio show. Charles F. Wheeler’s photography is rather good, as are the special effects. Vincent McEveety’s direction is serviceable, but the art direction (John B. Mansbridge and Al Roelofs), set decoration (Frank R. McKelvy) and costumes (Shelby Tatum) are remarkable. The sets look absolutely lived in, and the period furniture and appliances are first-rate.\n\nCharley and the Angel isn’t a bad picture as these things go, but considering the quality of its source, “not bad” isn’t nearly good enough.\n\nThe Barkleys of Broadway (1949) If this dull backstager had been simply one of many lousy musicals produced at MGM in the 1940s and ’50s it would be mildly disappointing and no more. As the final screen teaming of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, however, it is unforgiveable.\n\nPlanned as a follow-up to the 1948 Easter Parade and, like it, as a vehicle for Astaire and Judy Garland, the picture involves a married couple of bickering musical-comedy stars and the sudden aspirations of the Missus to become a legitimate actress. The movie’s director, Charles Walters had, quite understandably, no interest in dealing with Garland’s neuroses again after being driven mad by them on the previous picture, and someone had the brilliant notion of casting Rogers in Garland’s stead. While, despite her own dramatic U-turn (Kitty Foyle, in which she played an unwed mother and for which she was given an Academy Award) her delightful way with a comic line remained as undimmed as her protean abilities on the dance floor, the Rogers of 1949 was, inevitably, less lithe than the Ginger of 1939. This is especially noticeable in the “They Can’t Take That Away from Me” dance during a charity show where she’s attired in a low-cut, spaghetti-strap ballroom gown and her big shoulders suddenly overwhelm your vision. Rogers’ shoulders had, through her avidity for tennis, became far larger than Astaire’s and while she’s as graceful in dance as she ever was, with her flowing locks done up in tight braids around her head she looks disturbingly like a rather daring linebacker in drag. Worse, at the climax, when as Sarah Bernhardt she elects to recite the “Marseillaise” for her Paris Conservatory audition (something Bernhardt never did) she is made to look utterly ridiculous, her voice rising hysterically in what she imagines is passionate patriotism. When the sequence begins we expect Rogers to make a shambles of things, the way she demolished a radio broadcast while under hypnosis in Carefree, and when she launches into her absurd dramatic hyperbole we’re dismayed. Yet this is presented as proof of Dinah Barkley’s genius as a Dramatic Actress, and the Broadway audience (including the rightfully skeptical Astaire) goes predictably bananas, shouting “Bravo!” at this junior high school idea of greatness.\n\nAside from a few sharp lines and the occasional wisecrack assigned to Oscar Levant as Astaire’s musical collaborator, you’d never guess unless you knew that the unimaginative screenplay was the work of Betty Comden and Adolph Green. (Sidney Sheldon made uncredited contributions, but I doubt even he can be entirely blamed for the grinding witlessness of the thing.) Even Harry Warren’s music disappoints; there isn’t a good song in the batch, aside from “They Can’t Take That Away from Me,” which anyway was George Gershwin’s, and Ira Gershwin’s lyrics for the picture are on the same dispiriting level as Warren’s wan compositions. This is another of those mid-century musicals set in the theatre in which you can’t make out what sort of show they’re performing: Astaire and Rogers keep discussing plot scenes, but all we ever see are revue-type spots, the nadir of which, “My One and Only Highland Fling,” is the only truly bad musical number Astaire and Rogers ever performed. When Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers are in a scene and instead of being focused on the song you’re concentrating on the scrupulousness of Astaire’s sanitary etiquette with a communal dipping spoon, something is terribly wrong. There’s a number staged by Hermes Pan in a theatrical repair shop with articulated shoes that seems to owe something to, on the one hand, “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice” and on the other to The Red Shoes, but which has no real point except to present Astaire dancing with animated footwear. (And anyway, it couldn’t be performed anywhere but a movie set, so why is it allegedly being done on a Broadway stage?) The movie’s big ballad (“You’d Be Hard to Replace”) is drippy and the only number that really cooks is a percussive instrumental, “Bouncing the Blues,” which, all too briefly, returns the viewer to the great RKO days.\n\nI hadn’t meant to go on at such length about as rotten a movie as The Barkleys of Broadway but I guess my devotion to Astaire and Rogers is deeper, and more constant, than that of the people who threw this stinking mélange together. I’m only glad I viewed it at home; if I’d seen it in a theater I’d have been tempted to force my way into the projection booth and put a match to the print.\n\n*That’s not to mention Seydor’s constant, irritating references to Peckinpah as “Sam.” Writing books and producing documentaries on a man’s work long after he’s dead does not entitle you to evoke his forename as if he’d been your great pal.\n\n†Interestingly, Sondheim wrote the songs for a “mini-musical” version of Jules Feiffer’s satirical comic strip fable “Passionella” Nichols staged as part of a Feiffer evening in 1962. They were friends for decades but seldom after, alas, and except for the birdcage for which Sondheim wrote a couple of new songs and placed one old one (“Love is in the Air”), artistic collaborators. When “Passionella” resurfaced as part of Nichols’ 1966 Broadway musical The Apple Tree, the lovely score was by Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick.\n\n‡Charlie Wilson’s War (2007) which really was facile, was not a movie Nichols wanted to direct, and he was afterwards sorry he’d made it.\n\nText copyright 2024 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nKing Rat (1965) An evocative, thoughtful yet curiously uninspired adaptation by Bryan Forbes of James Clavell’s debut novel, the first in his so-called Asian Saga. (The book, and the movie, are fictionalized memoirs of Clavell’s experience as a British prisoner of war in the Japanese camp at Changi.) This is one of those movies which while it honors its source and is by no means bad is difficult to work up much enthusiasm for. It’s a quality I’ve noticed before in Forbes’ work, notably Scéance on a Wet Afternoon (1964); considering the excellence of the Mark McShane novel on which it was based, the picture should have been a classic but lacks some almost indefinable element — the je nais se quoi of art — that might have lifted it into the Pantheon. The same is true of King Rat. It’s decently enough done, and it’s certainly well cast (George Segal, James Fox, Tom Courtenay, John Mills, Leonard Rossiter, Denholm Elliott, Alan Webb) but it’s a bore to write about. Forbes is workman-like, and earnest, but the divine spark was never lit in him. He lacks, say, both the crazy inspiration of a John Huston and the image-mad power of a David Lean. The result is work that holds your interest and is thoroughly respectable, but who wants respectability from a movie? Segal, Fox and Courtney embody their roles perfectly, although the latter’s is noticeably truncated, and the black and white photography is by Burnett Guffey, who two years on from this would light Bonnie and Clyde. The John Barry score, with its odd use of the cimbalom for a story taking place in Singapore is nonetheless splendid, anchored to one of his indelible main themes, which captures the essential melancholy and aloneness beneath King’s gregarious façade. But Clavell’s book, once you’ve finished it, haunts you. At the end of the movie all you’re liable to be thinking about is what you want for dinner.\n\nBreakheart Pass (1975) A dandy mystery thriller in the guise of a conventional Western which despite the then extremely popular Charles Bronson in the lead somehow failed to find its audience. Based by Alistair MacLean on his 1974 novel, which itself reads like an extended treatment for a screenplay, the picture has pace, intelligence, excitement, and character: Everything we look for in a good escapist movie and including as well a plot whose modest but intriguing complications would almost certainly preclude its being made today.\n\nEven so, Bronson was reportedly unhappy that the true nature of his character’s role in the story was revealed earlier than MacLean chose to do in his book and he was right to be upset; as much as anything else in the novel it’s the central mystery of just who the hell “John Deakin” is that keeps the reader happily turning the pages. But the picture has much to compensate for the lapse, including glorious Idaho location cinematography by the great Lucien Ballard; top-notch editing by Byron Brandt that takes in a blood-curdling sequence involving runaway train-cars filled with Union soldiers*; and a cast of old pros: Ben Johnson, Richard Crenna, Charles Durning, Ed Lauter, David Huddleston, Roy Jenson and Eddie Little Sky. Bronson’s wife Jill Ireland represents the younger generation, as the plucky dame who becomes Bronson’s confederate, and the former boxer Archie Moore (once a very fine if physically mis-cast Joe Mott in the live television version of The Iceman Cometh) has a fight with Bronson on top of the speeding locomotive traveling over elevated tracks above an unforgiving gorge that is the last word in white-knuckle stuff. Tom Gries directed with understated flair, and Jerry Goldsmith wrote one of his characteristically intense, propulsive scores.\n\nAt the time of the movie’s release Kevin Thomas in the Los Angeles Times called Breakheart Pass “a fun if familiar picture but is played so broadly on such an elementary level that it can hope to satisfy only the most undemanding of viewer.” I presume Thomas meant that superfluous “of” to distinguish his intellectual capacities as far greater than those possessed by us mere undemanding types. And by sheerest coincidence while writing this I came across, in the liner rotes for Film Score Monthly’s release of the Quincy Jones score for The Split (1968) a quote from the same critic in which he uses the self-concocted word “incredibilities.” Apparently Thomas was himself undemanding, at least as far as correct grammar was concerned.\n\nBullitt (1968) Steve McQueen’s allure eludes me. A performer who continually asks to have his lines reduced may be, as McQueen labeled himself, a “reactor,” but he’s not an actor. John Wayne called himself a reactor too, and while he knew he registered most forcefully without dialogue, or when it was minimal, he wasn’t afraid of words. As for the man’s alleged “cool,” what we most often see in him is a blankness onto which the audience projects whatever it thinks he’s thinking. And while I prefer to avoid comparing actors, which seems to me an exercise in futility, if you imagine every role for which McQueen became famous cast instead with Paul Newman, I think you can see what I mean about his essential lack. As Frank Bullitt he’s rather good, in his limited way, although it’s the picture itself, and the way it was written, directed, photographed and scored, that give Bullitt its most memorable qualities.\n\nAlan R. Trustman and Harry Kleiner’s screenplay, based on a clever, conventional 1963 police procedural novel by Robert L. Fish (writing as “Robert L. Pike”… get it?) set in New York City, is sharper, more elliptical and more ambiguous than its source, except in the area of ethnicity: The movie, as was common practice at the time (due perhaps to the threat of protest by Mafia front groups, or the interference of J. Edgar Hoover?) de-emphasized the presence of Italian mobsters in the narrative; “Johnny Rossi” in the Fish novel becomes “Johnny Ross” in Bullitt, and La Cosa Nostra is only ever referred to as “The Organization.” Still, I suspect a reasonably knowledgeable pubescent in 1968 could have figured out what was being implied. What resonates are the characters, and the way Bullitt chafes against the system, especially as represented by the politically ambitious San Francisco D.A. played, with mercurial oiliness, by Robert Vaughan. Lt. Frank Bullitt’s iconoclasm is made clear by the distinctive way he wears his gun holster (a trick McQueen picked up from Detective Dave Toschi, who would later become famous for his role in the SFPD’s investigation of the “Zodiac” killings) and by his Highland Green Mustang GT, which gets a memorable workout in the movie’s justifiably famous second act chase. The use of San Francisco, where nearly all the picture’s scenes were filmed, is equally distinctive, and makes you wonder why so few American movies were ever made there.\n\nThe chase, in which Bullitt pursues the killers played by the veteran stuntmen Paul Genge and Bill Hickman, deserves every plaudit it’s been given (in spite of that green Volkswagen Beetle that keeps popping up beside McQueen as he speeds over the hills and which he repeatedly passes) but William A. Fraker’s beautiful deep-focus cinematography offers far more than chases. The British Peter Yates directs with quiet assurance; the supporting cast, which includes Don Gordon, Robert Duvall, Georg Stanford Brown, Al Checco and a luminously beautiful Jacqueline Bisset as Bullitt’s architect girlfriend, is splendid; and the score by Lalo Schifrin is one of the era’s finest. Anchored to a main title theme that can trace its lineage to Schifrin’s own “Mission: Impossible,” the score is largely diegetic. But when underscore is required, the composer delivers his characteristically snaky rhythms and casually infectious melodies in a way that is both un-insistent and compelling; take special note of the way that theme accompanies Pablo Ferro’s distinctive credits. If Bullitt is “cool,” it’s largely Schifrin who makes it so.\n\nPrince of the City (1981) Like Serpico (1973), this Sidney Lumet-directed (and co-written) picture, based in reality, moves up the time-frame and changes the names of the participants. The former I assume was a result of budgetary constraints, the latter due perhaps to our strange libel laws. Despite these compromises, it’s an extremely well-crafted movie which while it skirts greatness is nonetheless as impressive today as it was when it was new. All the more so since this sort of big, expansive picture, made without unnecessary flourishes and concerning itself with what Faulkner called “the human heart in conflict with itself,” and which alone, he felt, made for good writing, is seldom produced any longer. It’s a slightly fictionalized account of the travails of Bobby Leuci, whose activities exposing corruption in the NYPD and motivated by his overwhelming sense of guilt over his own were recounted in Robert Daley’s 1978 book. Lumet (and Jay Presson Allen, his co-scenarist) move the action from the late 1960s and early 1970s to what appears to be the late ’70s and alter the identities of the participants, including a young Rudy Giuliani. Although Lumet and Allen are scrupulous about not vilifying the people involved, it is virtually impossible to view the sanctimonious, entrapment-happy Federal prosecutor played by Bob Balaban with anything less than disgust, an emotion his real-life progenitor also engendered in the readers of Daley’s book.\n\nPrince of the City runs nearly three hours and famously has over 100 speaking roles yet never feels long. Although Allen had originally wished only to produce the picture, in part because she was uneasy about the book’s structure, she and Lumet did an artful job of juggling a complicated narrative even as they, to a degree, fictionalized it for popular consumption. For Lumet, this sort of picture was as natural as the summer sun and it’s doubtful any of his contemporaries could have planned and delivered such a long, complex movie with such economy and fluidity. Treat Williams, known primarily at that time for his stage work and, on film, for his smashing performance as Berger in the underrated Miloš Forman-directed movie of Hair (1979) and who is in nearly every scene of the movie, gives an exceptionally layered performance as “Danny Ciello,” conflicted, guilt-ridden, arrogant, loyal, compassionate and all too believably human. Also in the large cast: Jerry Orbach (in his first good movie role as one of the men Danny is loath to rat out), Paul Roebling, James Tolkan, Lindsay Crouse, Ron Karabatsos, Lee Richardson, Lane Smith, Lance Henriksen and Cynthia Nixon. (Alan King, who had recently starred for Lumet and Allen in their very funny adaption of her novel Just Tell Me What You Want has a cameo as himself.) The superb, muted and deliberately claustrophobic photography is by Andrzej Bartkowiak.\n\nLumet was never sure how he felt about Bobby Leuci, an ambivalence pretty obviously shared by Robert Daley in his original book. Was he sincere in his desire to confess, and to root out police corruption, or was he an opportunist? Or (and this seems likeliest) both at once? That quality, of not taking sides, is one that runs through the projects Sidney Lumet directed and it deepens his best work, which very much includes this movie. When, at the end, as Danny is about to give a police lecture and a young detective on hearing his name rises and leaves saying, firmly but quietly, “I don’t think I have anything to learn from you,” the moment is exactly right; the look on Treat Williams’ face suggests that while the dismissal stings, Danny can’t blame the cop in the least for wanting no part of him.\n\nThe Great Waldo Pepper (1975) A slightly flawed masterwork of collaboration between William Goldman and the director George Roy Hill containing some of the most exhilarating airborne flight sequences ever filmed.\n\nThe Man Who Killed Don Quixote (2018) Terry Gilliam famously attempted to film this comic/dramatic fantasy, in a significantly different version, in 2000, the disasters attending it documented by Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe in what became their fascinating Lost in La Mancha. Gilliam should have quit while he was behind. And since he is one of the most inventive and ingenious filmmakers alive, I get absolutely no pleasure from saying that.\n\nLacking both the time and the inclination to assay what I consider, on a reading admittedly aborted after several hundred pages, one of the most overrated of all “classic” novels, I’ll simply note that Don Quixote is not merely overlong but annoying, repetitive, weirdly discursive and often downright dull. Doubtless its literary satire meant something to 17th century readers, particularly in Spain, but we moderns are left mostly with famous narrative scraps: The Don and the madness which leads him to believe he is a knight-errant; his chaste devotion to his mythical Lady Dulcinea; the resolute peasant pragmatism of his squire Sancho Panza; the battle with the windmill. And if I am put off by Gilliam’s source, I am even more alienated by his choice of leading man. If there is a more charmless, unappealing young actor around these days than Adam Driver, I don’t know who he might be.\n\nIf the picture was a mess, it might at least have been an entertaining mess. If you didn’t know Terry Gilliam was the director and co-author (with Tony Grisoni) I would defy you to guess he was behind the camera. Only fleetingly is there ever a sense of inspiration, or a flash of that daring and intoxicating go-for-broke fantasy which is the sine qua non of Gilliam’s style. Instead the movie feels formless and inert, as if it had been worked on too long and compromised beyond its maker’s ability to come to grips with the material. Only rarely are you amused or intrigued, and never moved. The only saving graces are Jonathan Pryce’s performance as the old man who embodies Quixote, the ethereal beauty of Joana Ribeiro as the object of Driver’s affections, the lovely music by Roque Baños and the often-exquisite cinematography by Nicola Pecorini. Even they aren’t enough to salvage the last shreds of your interest.\n\nWhat is sometimes more tragic than a dream deferred, is a dream realized.\n\nMurder by Death (1976) Neil Simon’s spoof of literary and cinematic murder mystery sleuths is, like a Mel Brooks movie of the period, a scattershot affair; much of what was funny then is still quite funny now, and the big laughs tide you over the more airless passages. It’s a movie that couldn’t be made today, and not merely because its cast is irreplaceable. (Well. Truman Capote should have been replaced, with an actor, but that’s another matter.) What I’m referring to is Simon’s parody of Charlie Chan, and Peter Sellers’ casting in the role. Never mind that “Sidney Wang” takes off, not from Earl Derr Biggers’ intelligent and articulate Chan but from the “Confucius say…” Hollywood movie version of him, or that he is made no more ridiculous than the figures in the picture based on Sam Spade, Hercule Poirot or Nick and Nora Charles (Elsa Lanchester’s “Miss Marbles” is for some reason treated less savagely, although she is more Girl Guide than little old lady). It’s the “Yellowface” issue, and the deliberate comic stereotype, that would doom the character today.\n\nThat’s not to mention two of the movie’s best and funniest characters, the blind butler and the deaf-mute maid. When I was 15, the sight of Nancy Walker “screaming her head off” nearly put me on the theater floor, and I fell completely in love with Alec Guinness’ sightless but unflappable manservant. I still find nothing offensive about them. Again, Simon isn’t poking cruel fun at the blind or the deaf but at the absurdity of these characters being employed as domestics. That Guinness, blissfully unaware that the woman can neither hear nor speak and Walker, equally uncomprehending of his blindness, are unable to communicate is a sick-joke that is inherently hilarious and is made more so by the peerless comic playing of those two old pros. The others (Sellers, Lanchester, David Niven and Maggie Smith as “Dick and Dora Charleston,” James Coco as the gluttonous “Milo Perrier” and Peter Falk and the marvelous Eileen Brennan as “Sam Diamond” and his Girl Friday) each have moments in which to shine, especially Falk and Smith. His Bogart imitation is more than creditable, and her sparkling way with a funny line reaches a kind of apotheosis when Niven whispers the meaning of necrophilia into her ear and she smiles wickedly before offering a masterpiece of upper class understatement. And when Simon has the inspired gall to invoke an old vaudeville line, Smith gives in to it, gloriously. Estelle Winwood, who was apparently never young, is even funnier as an elderly nurse than she was as “Hold Me, Touch Me” for Mel Brooks in The Producers and only Capote disgraces himself, although he’s less annoying now than he was when the picture was new if only for the opportunity he affords to study one of the more outré literary figures of the post-war era without having to worry that he’ll write another bad book.\n\nThe director, Robert Moore, was very successful in the theatre, where he staged among other things The Boys in the Band, Deathtrap, They’re Playing Our Song, Woman of the Year and Simon’s collaboration with Burt Bacharach and Hal David Promises, Promises. He had no particular style as a moviemaker but he knew how to frame a scene to the best advantage of his gifted cast, and how to pace what they do and say. In this he was aided immeasurably by the marvelous “old dark house” set designed by Stephen Grimes, Dave Grusin’s witty underscore and the wonderful poster and main title caricatures of the cast by Charles Addams.\n\nThe Ninth Configuration (1980) Among screenwriters and novelists, William Peter Blatty was perhaps the greatest argument against a strict Jesuit education. In a world which needs the healing laughter of a good comedy far more than an impassioned sermon on the afterlife, this gifted comic writer felt he wasn’t doing enough to convince the world that his God exists. Hence, the book and movie The Exorcist, and even the phenomenal success of those didn’t satisfy him. Going back to a previous novel (Twinkle, Twinkle, “Killer” Kane) that he felt was too formless Blatty sharpened and re-worked it as The Ninth Configuration, book and movie. And here I may seem to contradict my own critique of Blatty because, in spite of its author’s hectoring about faith, the final result is among the wittiest of post-war pictures, containing nearly as many quotable lines as All About Eve. Yet for all its strengths, which include a first-rate cast, it’s still a sermon, and not a very subtle one.\n\nFilmed in Hungary due to its financer, PepsiCo’s, stipulations, The Ninth Configuration concerns a government-run asylum peopled with psychological drop-outs from the Vietnam war and what happens when a new director, Colonel Kane, is brought in to run the place. In a series of Shavian arguments, Kane and the astronaut Captain Cutshaw engage in debate about, among other things, the nature of life, the existence of a deity and the possibility of life after death, surrounded by the most entertaining collection of creative loons this side of a Marx Brothers epic. It’s a one-of-a-kind movie, crammed with marvelous performances, scintillating dialogue and surprising moments of near-slapstick hilarity. And if the ending feels a last desperate act of proselytizing you may not mind when the rest of it is so unique and engaging.\n\nAlthough Blatty originally and disastrously cast the Scottish Nicol Williamson as Kane, Stacy Keach proved an inspired substitution, as did Scott Wilson as Cutshaw. Best among the supporting players are Ed Flanders as the asylum’s quietly acerbic resident physician with an agenda of his own, Jason Miller as an inmate determined to adapt Shakespeare for dogs and Neville Brand as the exquisitely frustrated Regular Army C.O. The splendid ensemble cast also includes George DiCenzo, Robert Loggia, Joe Spinell in an inspired performance as Miller’s carping assistant and, as a pair of sadistic motorcycle thugs, Steve Sandor and Richard Lynch. Aside from the evangelistic ending, I have only two additional complaints: I wish Moses Gunn’s role was larger, and that there was a little more of Barry De Vorzon’s very good music score. But if Blatty’s bent to religious propaganda was obsessive, it has to be admitted that he could certainly be an enjoyable nudze.\n\nSeven Days in May (1964) John F. Kennedy, who had been very keen on the movie of Richard Condon’s novel The Manchurian Candidate, which John Frankenheimer directed, was also enthusiastic about the potential of this adaptation of the Fletcher Knebel/Charles W. Bailey II thriller, to be directed by Frankenheimer as well. Kennedy had good reason to be; like the fictional President of the book, he was surrounded by traitors. Chief among these on the military front were the rabid anti-Communist General Edwin Walker and Kennedy’s own Air Force Chief of Staff, General Curtis LeMay, a monstrous psychopath who in addition to being the main model for the Burt Lancaster character here, was also the likely prototype for Dr. Strangelove‘s General Jack D. Ripper. Whether LeMay was involved in Kennedy’s assassination is, as with so many aspects of that murder, unproven (and probably unproveable). That he certainly shed no tears over JFK’s grave may be inferred with impunity. Kennedy knew to his cost that some of his worst enemies were not outside Washington but within his own Administration.\n\nThe President, alas, did not live to see the final product, for which he’d offered Frankenheimer the use of the White House, and by the time it hit the nation’s screens in 1964, the movie was doomed to low receipts by a ticket-buying public quite understandably wary of yet another violent coup, even if this one was fictional. Rod Serling’s adaptation is taut, and respectful of an almost perfectly-plotted novel, in which the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Lancaster) plans the removal of the President (Frederic March) over a treaty with the Soviet Union. The picture is beautifully cast, with March giving one of his finest screen performances. Although the character’s name, Jordan Lyman, is a little too close to Lyndon Johnson for comfort, Lyman is, thankfully, no LBJ. March depicts with delicacy and precision a decent man who knows his actions are unpopular but who obeys the dictates of his conscience. That’s how you know the movie is fiction.\n\nLancaster gives one of those performances of his which, like his J.J. Hunsecker in Sweet Smell of Success, are measured, inflexible, cold, and vaguely terrifying; his final face-off with March is one of the great scenes in 1960s American movies. Ava Gardner has a good scene with Kirk Douglas, Martin Balsam as March’s Chief of Staff makes you genuinely sorry when he’s removed from the narrative, Hugh Marlow and Whit Bissell are appropriately oily as two of the conspirators, John Houseman gives a nicely judged performance (his first on film) as a shady Admiral, and a young woman called Colette Jackson contributes a wonderful cameo as a bar-girl perspiring in the Texas heat. Douglas is asked to play it stalwart and well-intentioned as the Marine Corps Colonel who unwittingly stumbles onto the plot against the President and gives roughly the sort of performance you’d expect; if you like him, which I do, you’ll enjoy it well enough. Best of all in the supporting cast is Edmond O’Brien as a bibulous Senator enlisted to investigate the existence of a secret military base, his rich, slightly ham-actor baritone memorably caressing his lines. Interestingly, while the time of the movie’s action is unspecified (the poster says 1970 or 1980 “or possibly tomorrow”) Frankenheimer approached it as if it was indeed the future, with video hookups and devices that would not have seemed all that out of place in 2014… (DARPA probably developed them 50 years before that.) Jerry Goldsmith composed a brief, effective score performed solely by percussive instruments. For some reason everyone who writes about this music feels compelled to say “piano and percussion,” as if they’re not the same.\n\nVictor/Victoria (Broadway, 1995) The ill-advised stage musical adaptation by Blake Edwards of his wonderful 1982 comedy, filmed for Japanese television on its Broadway opening night. Edwards had the notion when the movie was still relatively new, and Robert Preston was attached as well as Julie Andrews until he had second thoughts, deeming the project unworkable and “an ego-trip” for Edwards. To make matters even more dismal, Henry Mancini died while the show was being written, his and Leslie Bricusse’s new songs are, almost to a number, boring, and the two written by Frank Wildhorn are even worse. Andrews famously lost her singing voice as an indirect result of reprising her movie role here, the Rob Marshall choreography is his usual uninspiring mélange of borrowed styles, Tony Roberts overdoes his nelly queen interpretation of Toddy appallingly, and the only surprises are Gregory Jbara’s wonderful performance in Alex Karras’ old role and Rachel York’s wildly funny interpretation of Lesley Ann Warren’s.\n\nThe Wind and the Lion (1975) Early 20th century history re-written as a paean to Theodore Roosevelt, and as only John Milius could have conceived it. Yet somehow, beyond its support of gunboat diplomacy and its hagiography of one of the worst imperialists in American history, it’s so intelligent, and so entertaining, you almost forgive its determined machismo. This is due in large part to the actors: Sean Connery as the Berber Raisuli who kidnaps an American widow and her young children, John Huston as John Hay and the great Brian Keith in a wonderful turn as TR — less the Roosevelt of history perhaps than of Milius’ besotted imagination; of the real TR the British Ambassador once warned his superiors, “We must never forget that the President is seven years old.” As the widow, Candice Bergen gives her standard slumming job, but the movie’s most appalling performances are those of Geoffrey Lewis as the Moroccan US Consul-General Samuel R. Gummeré and, even worse, Steve Kanaly as the most avid of the American invaders. The widescreen cinematography by Billy Williams is glorious, and Jerry Goldsmith’s score is one of his very best, with a genuinely rousing recurrent main theme and a gloriously rhapsodic liebeslied for Connery and Bergen. The form of the narrative is right out of a Boy’s Own adventure, but Milius’ attempts to tell it through the eyes of Bergen’s son (Simon Harrison) are ineffective; a dream sequence near the end which strives to make this notion concrete falls about as flat as an un-stuffed qatayef. But Milius does get points for depicting the love story tacitly and the kidnapped boy and girl not as the usual squeamish and terrified victims but as the cold-bloodedly curious beings children of their age actually are.\n\nSpeaking of children, in her scenes as the young Alice Roosevelt, Deborah Baxter seems so completely infatuated by Father that the look on her face as she gazes at him borders on the incestuous. Or was that meant by the filmmaker as a comment on the future Mrs. Longworth’s pathology?\n\nThe Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean (1972) John Milius again, this time as screenwriter solely, with John Huston directing. Hollywood (very much including Milius) liked to depict Bean as a hanging judge but history tells us he was no such thing. Walter Brennan won one of his 37 assorted Academy Awards playing Bean in the William Wyler-directed The Westerner opposite Gary Cooper, where his death was every bit as fabricated as the mythic end the screenwriter concocted for him here. For Milius and Huston, Roy Bean becomes a kind of Pecos Bill figure, and when at the climax he disappears into a burning building on horseback chasing down his nemesis and never re-emerges, he’s been given a mythic exit out of American folklore cross-pollinated by its Classical European counterpart. It’s an odd picture, which Milius, who had originally hoped to direct it with Warren Oats, claims Huston and his star, the “cutsie-pie” Paul Newman, ruined. But it’s also an engaging one, once you acclimate to its tall-tale characters and structure. Despite Milius’ complaints, Newman gives into the nonsense completely and he’s vastly entertaining. The large, starry cast includes Anthony Perkins as an itinerant preacher, Tab Hunter as an early victim of Bean’s jurisprudence, Anthony Zerbe as a dangerous San Antonio hustler, Ava Gardner as Bean’s idol Lillie Langtry, Ned Beatty as his barkeep, Jacqueline Bisset as his daughter and, as if Bisset wasn’t stunning enough, a luminous Victoria Principal as his common-law wife. Roddy McDowall fulfills, in his unique fashion, the role of Bean’s pompous banker antagonist and the best of the actor cameos are those by Stacy Keach as the psychotic Albino “Bad Bob” and Huston himself in a rich comic bit as Grizzly Adams. (If you’re of my generation it might interest you to know that Bean’s pet bear is Bruno, who performed on television as “Gentle Ben.”) There’s also a terrible, headache-inducing atonal score by Maurice Jarre which includes a pretty but pointless ballad performed by Andy Williams over a dopey picnic sequence that smacks of the producer trying to recapture the joy of Newman’s musical bicycle ride with Katharine Ross in Butch Cassidy. Need I say that it doesn’t?\n\n*At 79, Yakuma Canutt ended his storied career as the picture’s second unit director and oversaw that sequence.\n\nText copyright 2021 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nWilliam Goldman’s very original tragicomic Western, since 1969 the template for all too many increasingly sour, smart-ass “buddy” movies, marvelously directed by George Roy Hill and beautifully filmed by Conrad Hall. Interestingly, Goldman wrote it for Jack Lemmon as Butch and Paul Newman as Sundance, and his characterization of Butch, almost universally regarded even by his victims as exceptionally amiable, sounds like Lemmon; you can easily imagine him speaking those lines of Newman’s, if with perhaps more world-weariness and humorous aggravation. Perhaps even more interesting, in retrospect, Newman was initially skeptical of his ability to express the sort of comic shine required of Butch’s lines and which he delivers with such assurance in the picture. Playing Butch seemed to have cracked open something in him that had been hiding just below the surface; he was much lighter, and far funnier, afterward. Since Robert Redford ultimately made a good showing in thepicture, the one unfortunate aspect of the billing switch from Newman as Sundance to Newman as Butch was the loss of Goldman’s original title: The Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy is a much better one.\n\nButch was mildly revolutionary in that its heroes, recognizing the implacable deadliness of the “Superposse” sent against them, do not stay and fight but, wisely, escape to South America. (Unnamed and un-lamented studio suit to Goldman: “All I know is, John Wayne don’t run away.” I hope he enjoyed hearing 20th Century-Fox’s cash register ring.) And, unusually, after opening to almost uniformly hostile reviews the picture still managed to quickly find its audience; it was not only one of the biggest hits of its year, but was for a time one of the top 10 highest grossing movies of all time. (Adjusted for inflation, it’s still at Number 40.) Not, as everyone but the gullible understands, that box-office success equates to artistic quality. Yet the movie seems to me an ideal evening’s entertainment, one of those rare popular hits that not only still looks and sounds good but which, given the state of American moviemaking now, looks and sounds even better than it did before.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like Robert Redford, who apparently still nurses a grudge against his one-time friend and movie collaborator*, to the point where, in interviews on the Fox Blu-ray he can only bring himself to refer to Goldman as “the writer,” I would say (and Goldman would have agreed) that the bad things in the movie tend to be his. I am far more forgiving of them, however, than Goldman himself apparently was, and I count few such defects in his screenplay, either as written or as Hill filmed it. Of two of the script’s nicest moments, one (the sequence where Butch, Sundance and the latter’s lover Etta Place see a movie purporting to show the men’s violent deaths) was filmed and cut and the other (a bicycle ride through a ghost town) only approximated. Goldman was not a perfect writer, but he was superb on structure and chiefly, as I see it, the problems lie in a few of his lines, and one particular scene, rather than in the action or the narrative arc.\n\nThe worst of these bits of dialogue — and one for which Pauline Kael rightly slanged the screenwriter —is the speech by Etta (Katharine Ross) in which she defines being 26 and single and a schoolteacher as “the bottom of the pit.” However true that might have been to the feelings of a spinster in the West at that time, when women, especially unwed women, were judged far more harshly societally than they are today, that line detracts from the eloquence of the monologue’s point, and the glib way Etta expresses it sticks out more with every passing year.† (To be charitable, perhaps Goldman was expressing his feelings at finding himself, while writing the script, working as a visiting professor at Princeton?) But worse than that, I think, is our introduction to Etta, staged as the prelude to a rape at gunpoint, the onus removed only at the last moment when she chides Sundance for being late. There’s something so repellent (and so unnecessarily so) about that ugly bit that it takes the whole of the bicycle sequence toremove its bad taste. And even there, Hill couldn’t resist a shot of Ross playing with her hair while gazing into the camera, as if Etta was a Vogue model in a hayloft layout. I grant Hill’s lapse is understandable; there was almost no one prettier in American movies during the late 1960s than Katharine Ross.\n\nOn the other hand, it must be acknowledged how well Goldman and Hill use Etta throughout the picture, and how absolutely without cliché the conception of her is. Even if it may be argued that she is more plot device than person — Butch and Sundance are better defined, and more full-bodied — she is never shrill, or weepy, or damsel-in-distress annoying, or any of the usual things women in AmericanWesterns tend, unless the pictures were made by artists, to be.‡ Indeed, once the three arrive in Bolivia, Etta becomes an active part of the gang, abetting Butch and Sundance in their bank robberies. (Hard to imagine even one of Howard Hawks’ Western heroines doing that.) The single problematic area concerning her presence in the picture is that the relationship between Etta, Butch and Sundance carries a whiff of uncertainty — that what’s really going on here is a ménage à trois, but that as with Bonnie and Clyde no one involved had the guts to show or imply it.\n\nAside from the items above, Butch is a picture in which everything else works, and works in a way that makes it nearly impossible to second-guess its makers or to suggest another approach that might havebeen better. Even the brief, anachronistic Burt Bacharach score, with its Swingle Singers-like vocalise, doesn’t feel out of place.§ Hill, himself a musician, was instrumental in the way the music sounds, even unto suggesting that the song for the bicycle sequence evoke Gershwin’s “I’m Bidin’ My Time” from Girl Crazy (although the Hal David lyric has nothing to do with the picture or the sequence, and makes the number feel like just another sausage from Burt & Hal’s Hit Machine.) That the instrumental score is so correct for his movie indicates how unerring Hill’s musical instincts were, as does his later embrace of the equally anachronistic Scott Joplin music for The Sting which, among other things, helped bring about a popular reevaluation of Joplin’s almost forgotten oeuvre. That Bacharach’s score is only 12 to 13 minutes in length also suggests how right Hill was; the music is so effective, and indelible, you think there’s two or even three times that amount in the movie.\n\nHall’s glorious, desaturated images, and the unfailing rightness with which he frames them, give Butch much of its richness.¶ Hill, always the sharpest of directors, varies the pace throughout but doesn’t allow it to lag, or permit the action to become lugubrious; the picture has almost a nervous energy aboutit although Hill’s direction is never hurried nor his cutting frenetic. He takes his time, and pulls you gently into his rhythms. Even the sepia New York City montage, cut together from stills of the stars manufactured when Fox refused Hill permission to film on its Hello, Dolly! sets, is done with restraint and perfectly timed to Bacharach’s carnival-like, “good-time” music. (This brief sequence is certainly more enjoyable than anything in Dolly apart from Louis Armstrong.) The way the filmmaker introduces Sundance, holding on Redford’s face for well over a minute, is instructive; it told the audience of 1969, without insistence, that this fellow with the mustache was going to be someone to watch.\n\nAnd then there are the actors. This is one of those pictures so well cast that its performances feel inevitable, from Newman’s enormously likable Butch, Redford’s mercurial Sundance and Ross’ charming Etta down to the smallest role of a guard, a Bolivian bandit or a bank manager. The supporting roles are mostly brief, but they’re wonderfully lived in: Strother Martin’s self-described “colorful” mineboss, Henry Jones’ expansive bicycle salesman, George Furth as the hapless railroad clerk Woodcock, Kenneth Mars as a marshal unable to work up a posse, Cloris Leachman as a cheerfully babbling prostitute, Percy Helton as a terrified old whorehouse retainer and, especially, the wonderful Jeff Corey as Sheriff Bledsoe. The way he says the warning line, “Don’t you understand that?” to Butch andSundance, not as a question but as a statement of fact — their time is ending and they can’t see it —illuminates the difference between a journeyman actor and an artist.\n\nI wish the early preview audiences hadn’t laughed too much, forcing Hill and Goldman to not only cut some of the comedy to rescue their ending but also to reduce things like the writer’s opening statement, dropping the wonderfully off-hand “Not that it matters but” from “Most of what follows is true” and eliminating the nickelodeon sequence, which ended with Etta walking away from the men whose fictional deaths she’d just witnessed, and out of the picture.\n\nSince we began with Goldman — since the picture begins with his having written the screenplay, in effect on his own reconnaissance — it’s fitting we end with him. Image junkies and auteurists (usually the same thing) like to pretend that people only remember the visuals in the movies they love, but it’s lines people repeat to each other when a film gets mentioned, not illustrations. And Butch Cassidy and the Sundance certainly has its share. A punchline: “Why, you crazy — the fall will probably kill ya!” An epigram: “Boy, I got vision. The rest of the world wears bifocals.” And of course, Butch’s irritated question about the Superposse that, over time, becomes first a haunting refrain, almost a threnody, and, finally, a kind of frightful, awestruck mantra: “Who are those guys?” He may have gotten some details wrong, fudged others and made up the rest (“Most of what follows is true…”) but the screenwriter told us more or less who two guys were. However and wherever they died, I daresay if Goldman hadn’t, almost no one today would remember they’d lived at all.\n\n*And if Goldman was such a lousy hack screenwriter, why did Redford agree to star in five movies the man wrote?\n\n†Someone on the Blu-ray commentary (it might be Hill) says he suspects Etta was a whore, but Goldman demurs. He felt — and I agree with him — that the few photos we have of Etta show a woman too pretty and healthy-looking to have been a frontier prostitute. As hard a life as a whore’s is now, it was infinitely worse then; it aged girls fast, and few young women of 26 would appear as youthful and attractive as Place does in her pictures.\n\n‡If you want to see women who are full human beings rather than attitudes in Westerns that pre-date the modern feminist era, try (to name just the first few that occur to me) Linda Darnell in My Darling Clementine, Shelley Winters in Winchester ’73, Maureen O’Hara in Rio Grande, Julie Adams in Bend of the River, Angie Dickinson in Rio Bravo, Tina Louise in Day of the Outlaw, Diana Lynn and Theresa Wright in Track of the Cat and virtually the entire cast of Westward the Women.\n\n§Among the session singers were the bass (and erstwhile Tony the Tiger voice) Thurl Ravenscroft and Sally Stevens, whose distinctive soprano is especially prominent in the movie’s third musical interlude, which Bacharach titled “South American Getaway.” Stevens was a favorite of Jerry Goldsmith, among others; you can hear her on the soundtracks of Klute and Dirty Harry (for both of which she provided eerie, unsettling wordless vocals) and on the song “Flying Dreams” in The Secret of NIMH.\n\n¶Hall got the Oscar for them. Goldman won for his screenplay, Bacharach and David for Best Song, and Bacharach also took home the score award. Hill and the picture were nominated; John Schlesinger and Midnight Cowboy won in those categories, which as these things go seems more than fair.\n\nText copyright 2020 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nThe Way We Were was so popular in its day, and is so warmly remembered by those who saw it when it was new, that the glow of memory has transmuted it into something it isn’t, and never was. Far from a great romantic drama, it is a potentially great romantic drama effectively sabotaged, mostly by the usual spineless obduracy of its director, Sydney Pollack.\n\nOnce upon a Hollywood time the producer Ray Stark wooed the playwright and screenwriter Arthur Laurents to concoct a project for Barbra Streisand. Laurents based his original treatment on a firebrand Jewish coed he’d known at college in the 1930s. Because he’d been impressed with the 1969 They Shoot Horses, Don’t They? the scenarist, to his everlasting regret, insisted that Pollack be their director. Pollack in turn wanted the lead male role for his pal Robert Redford. And thereby, as is said, hangs a tale.\n\nAs is plainly evident from the compelling novel Laurents published in 1972 based on his own original script, The Way We Were is Katie Morosky’s story. Hubbell Gardner, her goyische obsession (and eventual husband) is a supporting actor merely. Indeed, his charming emptiness is part of the point; their romance is doomed because Katie sacrifices her ideals for a beautiful, bright man who is, while politically astute, a passive, empty, uncommitted vessel into which she pours her romantic/erotic desires. And Katie’s political engagement is in the novel front and center, even when, as a Hollywood wife, she’s neglecting it.\n\nThe story works in the book in a way it never gets a chance to on-screen, where Redford’s involvement overbalances the narrative and Pollack, after a disastrous preview, panicked and cut nearly every political moment of importance, even shredding the climactic motivation for the dissolution of the Gardners’ marriage, as the pregnant Katie realizes her past has become a danger to her screenwriter husband’s present and offers to permit a divorce if they can just stay together long enough for her to deliver their child — a thing she couldn’t imagine doing in any other circumstance. By deliberately trimming these lines, and only these lines, of Katie’s, Pollack subverted the picture, and Streisand’s performance. But then, Pollack became well-known in Hollywood (perhaps as a result of The Way We Were) as a consummate writer-fucker.\n\nPollack, who when he appeared on the other side of the camera was a fine actor, as a director was little but a gifted hack who, early on, made a couple of good pictures (They Shoot Horses… and The Scalphunters) and later a few more (Three Days of the Condor, Tootsie and Absence of Malice) but whose work in the main is a catalog of mediocrity with a certain pictorial prettiness. He was not, to be charitable, what one could without laughing call a deep thinker. Unlike that other Sidney, the late and much lamented Lumet (himself once an actor) Pollack seemed not to have an analytical bone in his body, and very little narrative logic. I remember, in 1986, howling with laughter to hear him praising the Motion Picture Academy for its “courage” in decreeing his expensive Hallmark Valentine Out of Africa Best Picture of its year, as if the movie was some radical departure from the accepted norm instead of exactly and precisely the sort of big, swoony romantic pap upon which in those days the Academy habitually bestowed its imprimatur. Some well-respected filmmakers (Chaplin, Keaton, Welles, Lumet, Laurence Olivier, Elia Kazan, Martin Ritt, Blake Edwards, Carl Reiner, Mike Nichols, Roman Polanski, Elaine May, Sidney Poitier, Clint Eastwood, Gene Wilder, Warren Beatty, Kenneth Branagh and even Redford himself) were or are actors,* and the really good ones have a feeling for how to present other actors to their best advantage. Certainly these men (and women, if we include Streisand herself) are not known for sabotaging their stars’ performances as Pollack did to Streisand, not once but twice. The second instance was a sequence he cut in which Katie, driving on the UCLA campus, sees a passionate young girl agitating against the actions of the House Committee on Un-American Activities who both reminds her of her youthful self and stands as a living upbraid to her own increasing complacency.\n\nLaurents knew he was in trouble when Pollack gushed that he had come up with the best romantic screenplay anyone had written in years, “and you’re a homosexual!” Due to his commitment to Redford, Pollack insisted that Hubbell be given equal weight with Katie thus (in my admittedly minority opinion) fatally compromising the project. When Laurents eventually walked away from his own film — directors who moan about having to do this should talk to a few of the writers they habitually drive to that extreme — Pollack ultimately brought on no fewer than 11 additional writers including some very fine ones like Alvin Sargent, Paddy Chayefsky, and Herb Gardner, only the first of whom would seem to have had any natural affinity for the material. Along the way someone (Sargent?), trying to resurrect the shreds of a character (poor Bradford Dillman’s) who, while peripheral in the book, at least has a presence there but who is nearly translucent in the finished picture, shoehorned in the movie’s most annoying wheeze: Hubbell and J.J. challenging each other to come up with “best”s. (“Best whiskey,” “Best year.”) As a recurrent motif it’s even more irritating than the sight of Streisand pushing Redford’s bangs across his forehead as if he was a little boy about to have his portrait photo taken, and equally as true to life.\n\nAlthough it was probably cold comfort, considering the damage Pollack would ultimately do to his screenplay, once the director’s team of re-writers got through ruining the very script Pollack had raved about, Laurents was prevailed upon to return to the project, and was in a position to charge Stark & Co. through the nose for his continued participation. I like to think Laurents wrote Katie’s splendid rejoinder to Hubbell late in the movie, in the sequence at Union Station where supporters of the Hollywood Ten are attacked by shrieking McCarthyite conformists. The exchange highlights both the limits of Hubbell’s thinking, and the essential soundness, even if it sometimes lacks humor, of Katie’s:\n\nHubbell: I’m telling you that people — people— are more important than any goddamn witch hunt. You and me! Not causes. Not principles.\n\nKate (Exasperated): Hubbell, people are their principles!\n\nOr their lack of them.\n\nWatching the Union Station sequence in 2020, the terrified mass in the movie that physically assaults the defenders of free speech (including, of course, the freedom of the attackers to oppose free speech…) is eerily and unsettling close to the equally ill-informed and frightened of today shouting into the faces of their fellow citizens for the unpardonable sin of not blindly obeying the edicts of governors, mayors and un-elected officials threatening them with arrest should they balk at slapping 95% ineffective pieces of cloth over their faces, whatever their reasons for failing to submit might be, including ill health, psychic distress or simple good sense. Plus ça change…\n\nHowever butchered it was in the making, and bearing Pollack’s less-than inspired staging of most of its scenes, the picture still looks handsome, thanks to the sharp imagery, beautifully balanced color and unerring eye of its cinematographer Harry Stradling Jr., the splendid period production design by Stephen B. Grimes and set decoration of William Kiernan — there’s an especially nice touch at the beginning when Larry Parks’ name rather pointedly appears on a theatre marquee — and Dorothy Jeakins’ and Moss Mabry’s subtle costume designs which perfectly re-create the sartorial look of the late ’30s, mid-to-late 1940s and early 1950s. The Oscar-winning score by Marvin Hamlisch struck me as bloodless in 1973 and seems even thinner now, particularly when I reflect that one of the composer’s direct competitors for the award was Jerry Goldsmith’s superb score for Papillon, and that among the non-nominated scores that year were Enter the Dragon (Lalo Schifrin), Scorpio (Jerry Fielding), The Thief Who Came to Dinner and Oklahoma Crude (both by Henry Mancini), Theatre of Blood (Michael J, Lewis), Cahill, United States Marshal (Elmer Bernstein), George Martin’s distinctly non-John Barryesque James Bond Live and Let Die and my own personal favorite of that year, Michel Legrand’s marvelous score for The Three Musketeers. The brief song Hamlisch composed with the lyricists Marilyn and Alan Bergman (and which soon became annoyingly ubiquitous) is, on the other hand, strongly and exceptionally plangent, although I have a quarrel with one of its essential lines:\n\n“Memories may be beautiful and yet\n\nWhat’s too painful to remember\n\nWe simply choose to forget\n\nSo it’s the laughter\n\nWe will remember…”\n\n(©COLGEMS-EMI Music)\n\nThis, in my experience, is wholly incorrect. The memory of laughter fades; it’s the pain you can’t forget.\n\nLaurents’ published novel (and, one presumes, the screenplay on which he based it) fleshes out all the characters. The movie flattens them. And as with the fabled night in Tootsie which Larry Gelbart said “would have to last a hundred hours,” Pollack’s sense of time is so imprecise that the movie Hubbell is hired to adapt from his own first novel seems to be taking years to write. Aside, to a degree, from Patrick O’Neal as Hubbell’s director, Herb Edelman as Katie’s New York radio producer and Viveca Lindfors as a character very like Salka Viertel (in whose literary salon most writerly emigres of the period congregated) no one else in the picture has a chance to land a performance, or even to make us aware of their existence. I suppose it’s a relief that the movie omits the sequence in which Katie, devastated by her unrequited feelings for Hubbell, lets her Young Communist League pal Frankie, who is in his turn in love with her, fuck her outside the gym on prom night. Yet without that rather terrible scene, we don’t understand why Frankie informs on Katie later. And since we never see James Woods again, I would bet most people who saw the picture didn’t even remember his character’s name, when all it would have taken was an artfully edited insert near the end to remind us. Pollack’s incompetence in these areas is often genuinely shocking; it’s as if, having stitched together so many writers’ scripts, he had no idea what he was shooting, and had to discover it in the editing, after he’d made a mess of things. Either that or he was so contemptuous of the audience he figured he could get away with any inconsistency or plot gap. It’s up to the stars to pull us in, and while Redford does what he can to make Hubbell matter, it’s really Streisand who holds the thing together.\n\nKatie is so earnest, so (to use a word often applied to Streisand in her youth) strident, particularly at the beginning, that she could easily become unbearable. Her ironic attachment to Redford’s Hubbell softens her, but doesn’t turn her into a mindless twit. (Although it’s a mark of Pollack’s failure as a director that he never makes us aware, as Laurents does in his book, that despite Katie’s assumptions Hubbell’s family background is as lower-middle class as her own.) While both stars are too old to be believable in the long college flashback early in the picture — Redford was 36 in 1972 and Streisand was 30 — she carries it off better than he does. She also has a quietly devastating moment when, putting up the drunken Hubbell for the night she climbs into bed with him and he makes love to her, perfunctorily, as if he’s performing a ritual, like putting the cat out for the night. There are few things more dispiriting in the realm of sexual love than lying naked beneath someone you’ve adored forever and being grateful nearly to tears for what’s (finally!) happening while at the same time fully cognizant that he’s so wasted he can barely remember his own name, let alone yours. The emotions that pass over Streisand’s face during this sequence encompass everything Katie is feeling without for a second doing too much or pushing too hard for effect; they would do any actress proud, let alone one not, at that time, known for her abilities in drama. (And yet the Academy gave its award that year to Glenda Jackson, for an anemic comedy no one remembers.)\n\nStreisand never quite forgets Katie’s passions, even, in the Hollywood section of the picture, when she’s less attuned to them. Hubbell quite rightly accuses Katie of humorlessness, although it’s impossible to imagine how she could have laughed off, as he suggests she should have, her public humiliation in the sequence where she speaks at the student strike for peace. And somehow Streisand even makes Katie’s masochistic yen for Hubbell less pathetic than merely heart-breakingly human, although the Jewish-girl-with-the-nose-pining-for-the-gorgeous-guy routine was wearing more than a little thin by 1973. She’d been doing it to death, and continued to for years when, aside from her voice and her comic touch, what her fans most loved about her was that she was different. We didn’t want her demure, or small-featured, or conventionally pretty. And if Katie’s early stridency makes her a bit of a pill, I still prefer it to that soft-toned, eye-batting and rather blatantly condescending manner Streisand adopts when she’s trying to sell us on her latest political kick, usually while also hawking a record album. At least Katie Morosky had the guts to call her listeners fascist.\n\nInterestingly, it almost seems now as though there was never a time when the phrase “the way we were” didn’t exist. It’s given to very few writers to come up with a title, or a term, that defines a concept with such sharpness and clarity that it becomes an immediate and lasting part of the language. Fitzergald’s “The Jazz Age,” coined for an essay in 1931, instantly codified the decade he was so instrumental, with The Great Gatsby, in fixing in amber. And in the modern era, who, aside from that rapidly dwindling minority called readers even remembers that it was the then-young novelist Douglas Coupland who in 1991 created the term “Generation X”? In the same way, few now know that Arthur Laurents gave us our favorite clause to describe the loves and the mores of our youths. But because The Way We Were was a movie, and one which for all its flaws is both popular and enduring, at least more people know where his phrase came from. It’s not much but in what Gore Vidal aptly called The United States of Amnesia, surely that is something.\n\n*I don’t include Woody Allen in this company because I would have to accept that he was, or has ever been, anything like an actor. Watch The Front sometime if you want proof of what a classic non-actor he is. Mel Brooks, likewise, was a comic personality, not an actor, And if Ron Howard is indeed “well-respected” as a director, it only goes to prove why those who value serious American movies live so close to despair.\n\nText (except for the Bergmans’ lyric) copyright 2020 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nNote: For fuller reviews of some of the movies below, click on the highlighted titles.\n\n“The Sign of Four / The Hound of the Baskervilles” (1983) A pair of Sherlock Holmes adaptations by Charles Edward Pogue for British television starring the irreplaceable Ian Richardson which, while not precisely faithful to Conan Doyle, are rich in atmosphere and, in Richardson, boast perhaps the finest Holmes before Jeremy Brett sealed the franchise.\n\nUnderworld U.S.A.

Most of the Fuller pictures from that time are curios, quasi-successful but tamer affairs than those that came before. This one, suggested by some Saturday Evening Post pieces by Joseph F.
