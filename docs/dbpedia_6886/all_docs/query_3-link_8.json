His legacy lives on through his children, art, filmmaking and devoted passion to conservation and the environment.\"\n\nJames died on Friday from bile-duct cancer in his liver at the age of 58. His wife, Kyle, confirmed the news last week by sharing a tribute to her husband on Twitter, writing, \"James died today. We’re heartbroken. He lived a beautiful, impactful life & was loved by many.\"\n\nGiulio Marcocchi /Getty Images Robert Redford and his son, James\n\n\"As his wife of 32 yrs, I’m most grateful for the two spectacular children we raised together,\" she said, adding, \"I don’t know what we would’ve done w/o them over the past 2 yrs.\"\n\nRELATED: Robert Redford's Son James Redford, Filmmaker and Activist, Dies at 58 After Cancer Battle\n\nOn Monday, Kyle told The Salt Lake Tribune James had died from bile-duct cancer in his liver. Kyle said her husband’s liver disease had returned two years ago and that the cancer was discovered last November while he was awaiting a liver transplant.\n\nJames, a filmmaker, struggled with health problems since his childhood. He was diagnosed with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis, a rare autoimmune disease affecting the liver, according to his IMDb page.\n\nAfter receiving two liver transplants in 1993, founded the James Redford Institute for Transplant Awareness, a nonprofit created to educate the public about organ and tissue donation.\n\nM.

They had four children together: Scott, who died just two months after his birth in 1959 from sudden infant death syndrome; daughter Shauna, 59, James, and Amy, who turns 50 on Thursday.\n\nJames is survived by his wife, Kyle, and their two children, Dylan and Lena."
