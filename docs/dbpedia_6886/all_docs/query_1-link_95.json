The ancestors of the McCready family lived in Ayrshire.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the McCready family\n\nThe surname McCready was first found in Ayrshire (Gaelic: Siorrachd Inbhir Àir), formerly a county in the southwestern Strathclyde region of Scotland, that today makes up the Council Areas of South, East, and North Ayrshire, where they held a family seat from early times and their first records appeared on the early census rolls taken by the early Kings of Britain to determine the rate of taxation of their subjects.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the McCready family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our McCready research.

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Semper paratus\n\nMotto Translation: Always prepared.\n\nCitations +\n\n\"What are the 5,000 Most Common Last Names in the U.S.?\".
