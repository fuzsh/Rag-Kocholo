        "text": "Turbulent times\n\nOf ancient origins, ‘Parker’ derives from an Old French term indicating ‘keeper of the park’ – but the ‘parks’ in question would not have been the green and open spaces that are open to the public today, but the ‘parklands’ of royalty or the nobility.\n\nThis was an important and trusted post that in many cases was hereditary, while ‘Parker’ also became a nickname for a gamekeeper.\n\nIt also has strong Anglo-Saxon connections, and this means that flowing through the veins of many bearers of the name today may well be the blood of those Germanic tribes who invaded and settled in the south and east of the island of Britain from about the early fifth century.\n\nKnown as the Anglo-Saxons, they were composed of the Jutes, from the area of the Jutland Peninsula in modern Denmark, the Saxons from Lower Saxony, in modern Germany and the Angles from the Angeln area of Germany.\n\nIt was the Angles who gave the name ‘Engla land’, or ‘Aengla land’ – better known as ‘England.’\n\nThey held sway in what became England from approximately 550 to 1066, with the main kingdoms those of Sussex, Wessex, Northumbria, Mercia, Kent, East Anglia and Essex.\n\nWhoever controlled the most powerful of these kingdoms was tacitly recognised as overall ‘king’ – one of the most noted being Alfred the Great, King of Wessex from 871 to 899.\n\nIt was during his reign that the famous Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was compiled – an invaluable source of Anglo-Saxon history – while Alfred was designated in early documents as Rex Anglorum Saxonum, King of the English Saxons.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxons meanwhile, had usurped the power of the indigenous Britons – who referred to them as ‘Saeson’ or ‘Saxones.’\n\nBut the death knell of Anglo-Saxon supremacy was sounded in 1066 with the Norman Conquest of that year.\n\nIt was on October 25 that the Anglo-Saxon king, Harold II, encountered a mighty invasion force, led by Duke William of Normandy, that had landed at Hastings, in East Sussex.\n\nThe Normans suffered heavy losses in the subsequent battle, but through a combination of the deadly skill of their archers and the ferocious determination of their cavalry they eventually won the day.\n\nHarold, last of the Anglo-Saxon kings, was among the many dead whose bodies littered the bloody battlefield.\n\nWilliam was declared King of England on December 25, and the complete subjugation of his Anglo-Saxon subjects followed.\n\nWithin an astonishingly short space of time, Norman manners, customs and law were imposed on England – laying the basis for what subsequently became established ‘English’ custom and practice.\n\nBut beneath the surface, old Anglo-Saxon culture was not totally eradicated.\n\nSome aspects were absorbed into those of the Normans, while faint echoes of the Anglo-Saxon past is still seen today in the form of popular surnames such as Parker.\n\nIt is first found in England in Somerset, where an Anschetil Parker is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 – indicating that, rather than being an employee of a landholder, he held land in his own right.\n\nThe name figures prominently in the historical record.\n\nBorn in Norwich in 1504, Matthew Parker was the Archbishop of Canterbury whose noted inquisitiveness about all matters relating to the Church earned him the nickname of “Nosey Parker” – now a common term for someone who ‘pokes their nose’ into other people’s affairs.\n\nGraduating from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in 1525 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, he was ordained as a priest two years later.\n\nHis rise through the ecclesiastical establishment was rapid and, along with fellow theologians Thomas Cranmer and Richard Hooker, was a co-founder of what became recognised as a distinctive tradition in Anglican, or ‘English Church’, theological thought.\n\nThe main driving force behind the statements of Anglican doctrine known as the Thirty-Nine Articles, he was also a collector of ancient English manuscripts that include a version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and the Book of St Augustine Gospels.\n\nThis was at a time of great dissension between the Church in Rome and the English Church, and Parker’s main reason for locating and collecting the manuscripts was to lend weight to the claim that the English Church was, historically, independent from Rome.\n\nHe certainly lived in turbulent times.\n\nAs chaplain to Anne Boleyn, he was close to the court of Henry VIII – the ill-fated wife of the monarch who was executed in 1536 on trumped-up charges of adultery, incest and heresy.\n\nA year after her execution, Parker was appointed chaplain to Henry himself and, following the accession to the throne of Elizabeth, daughter of Anne Boleyn and Henry, he was appointed by her in 1559 as Archbishop of Canterbury – serving in this powerful post until his death in 1575.\n\nIn a later century, George Parker, 2nd Earl of Macclesfield, was the astronomer instrumental in what was, at the time, the highly unpopular change-over in England from the Julian, or Old Style, calendar to the Gregorian calendar.\n\nThis came into effect in 1752 and led to claims that it had effectively ‘robbed’ the people of eleven days.\n\nBorn in 1695 and elected a Fellow of the prestigious scientific think-tank, the Royal Society, in 1722, it was from his family seat of Shirburn Castle, Oxfordshire, that he carried out both astronomical observations and chemical experiments. Later elected president of the Royal Society, he died in 1764.\n\nOn the high seas, Sir Peter Parker, 1st Baronet, was the noted Royal Navy officer born in 1721.\n\nAppointed captain in 1747, he later commanded HMS Buckingham, and was knighted in 1772.\n\nHe is best known for his exploits during the American Revolutionary War of 1775 to 1783 when, aboard HMS Bristol, he led a naval attack against fortifications on what is now Fort Moultrie that protected Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nBut he was forced to call off the attack after sustaining heavy casualties, including the loss of HMS Actaeon, which was grounded\n\nLater serving under Admiral Lord Howe in the invasion and capture of New York City, he went on to become Commander-in-Chief, North American Waters and then as Commander-in-Chief, Jamaica.\n\nA patron and friend of Horatio Nelson, the naval hero who was killed at the battle of Trafalgar in October of 1805, he acted as Chief Mourner at his funeral.\n\nHaving succeeded Lord Howe as Admiral of the Fleet in 1799 and also having been created a baronet, he died in 1811.\n\nContinuing a family naval tradition, he was the grandfather of Admiral Sir Charles Parker, 5th Baronet.\n\nBorn in 1792 and entering the Royal Navy at the age of only 12, he went on to serve in a number of theatres of operation; promoted to Admiral in 1863, he died six years later.\n\nFrom war at sea to land warfare, Charles Parker, born in London in 1870, was a recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for valour in the face of enemy action for British and Commonwealth forces.\n\nIt was during the Second Boer War of 1899 to 1902 that, as a sergeant in ‘Q’ Battery, Royal Horse Artillery, he performed the actions for which he was awarded the honour.\n\nIn March of 1900 at Sanna’s Point, South Africa, he and two other members of his gun crew – who were also awarded the VC – were instrumental, under heavy enemy fire, in man-handling their gun back to their own lines; he died in 1918.\n\nBorn in 1881, Walter Parker was an English recipient of the VC during the First World War.\n\nHe had been a lance-corporal in the Royal Marine Light Infantry, Royal Naval Division, when on the night of 30 April/1 May 1915 at Gaba Tepe, Gallipoli, in Turkey, he volunteered to take much needed supplies to an isolated trench containing about forty comrades, some of whom were wounded.\n\nThe approach to the trench was being raked by vicious enemy machine-gun fire and a number of other men had already been killed attempting to reach it – but Parker was successful.\n\nHe delivered the supplies and tended the wounded until the trench was finally evacuated.\n\nWounded in the action and invalided out of the service, he died in 1936, while his VC is now on display at the Royal Marines Museum in Southsea.\n\nFame and infamy\n\nOne bearer of the Parker name with a particularly tragic claim to fame was Cynthia Ann Parker, who as a child was kidnapped by a war band of Comanche American Indians after they massacred most of those living in a family settlement.\n\nAdopted by the Comanche, she lived with them for 24 years before being discovered by Texas Rangers – by which time she had all but forgotten her previous existence and subsequently found it extremely difficult to re-adjust.\n\nBorn in about 1824 in Crawford County, Illinois, she was aged nine when her grandfather was recruited by the government to establish a fortified settlement with his family and others in north-central Texas and build a log fort – that became known as Fort Parker.\n\nIn May of 1836, the fort was attacked by a raiding band of Comanche who killed her grandfather and a large number of other settlers. Cynthia and five other children were led off by the band, but one escaped and managed to alert the authorities.\n\nA number of rescue operations were mounted by the Texas Rangers – all to no avail. But all the captives – apart from Cynthia – were eventually released after ransoms were paid.\n\nAdopted by a Comanche couple who raised her as their own daughter, she integrated into the life of the tribe and was given the Comanche name of Naduah, meaning “someone found” or “keeps warm with us.”\n\nShe even married a Comanche chieftain, Peta Nocona, and bore him three children who included the last free chief of the tribe – who later became known as Quanah Parker.\n\nIt was not until 24 years later, after a small group of Texas Rangers surprised a band of Comanche in what became known as the battle of Pease River, that Cynthia was discovered in a nearby camp – one of the Rangers having been alerted by her blue eyes.\n\nRemoved from the camp, she was later positively identified and taken by an uncle to live with him and his family in Birdville, Texas.\n\nThe story caused a national sensation, the consensus being that Cynthia had been ‘redeemed from savages’ – but she could not re-adjust to the ways of white society and on at least one occasion attempted to escape and return to her Comanche family.\n\nHeartbroken and pining over her separation from them, she stopped eating and died in 1870 – ten years after being removed from her beloved family.\n\nOn a much more positive note concerning the affairs of the American Indians, or Native Americans as they are now more properly known, Arthur Caswell Parker was a noted authority on their culture in addition to being an archaeologist and historian.\n\nBorn in 1881 on the Cattaraugus Reservation of the Seneca Nation, in western New York State, he was of mixed Seneca and European descent.\n\nHis mother, who ran a school on the reservation, was of mixed Scots and English descent, while his father, Frederick Ely Parker, was of mixed Seneca and white American descent.\n\nLater adopted into the tribe as an honorary member and given the Seneca name Gawaso Wanneh, meaning “Big Snowsnake”, he absorbed not only their culture but also that of other tribes.\n\nReceiving his formal education in White Plains, New York, he later became special assistant archaeologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.\n\nHe went on to become an honorary trustee of the New York State Historical Association and, in 1935, was elected first president of the Society for American Archaeology; a co-founder of the Society of Americans, he also helped to found the National Congress of American Indians ten years before his death in 1955.\n\nAn Arthur C. Parker Scholarship is awarded annually by the Society for American Archaeology to help train Native Americans in the discipline.\n\nTwo infamous bearers of the otherwise proud name of Parker were Robert Leroy Parker, better known as the outlaw Butch Cassidy and Bonnie Parker, known as one half of the duo Bonnie and Clyde.\n\nBorn in 1866 in Beaver, Utah, of mixed English and Scottish parentage, Robert Leroy Parker acquired the nickname “Butch” because he worked for a short period as a butcher in Rock Springs, Wyoming.\n\nThe surname “Cassidy”, meanwhile, was adopted by him in honour of his friend and mentor Mike Cassidy, a horse thief and cattle rustler.\n\nAlways on the move, Butch was constantly involved in a number of petty crimes and was imprisoned on a number of occasions.\n\nBut it was as the leader of the outlaw gang known as the Wild Bunch – that included Harry Alonzo Longabaugh, better known as the Sundance Kid – that he gained particular notoriety throughout the American Old West, through a series of bank and railroad robberies.\n\nWith the authorities, including the Pinkerton Detective Agency, hot on their heels, the gang split up and Butch and Sundance, along with the latter’s lover, Ethel “Etta” Place, headed for a remote area of Argentina in 1901.\n\nTipped off that the Pinkerton Agency may have learned of their whereabouts, the trio hastily departed for Chile for a time before returning to Argentina.\n\nRobbing a bank in Villa Mercedes, west of Buenos Aires, they then fled and returned to Chile before seeking refuge in Bolivia; Etta, meanwhile, had endured more than enough of a life on the run and, with her lover’s blessing, secretly returned to the United States.\n\nAfter stealing the payroll of a silver mine in November of 1908, Butch and Sundance were tracked down a few days later by Bolivian Army soldiers to a lodging house in San Vicente.\n\nA shoot-out ensued and the partners in crime were killed and then buried in San Vicente cemetery in unmarked graves.\n\nTo this day, however, doubt exists as to the true identity of the two men who were shot to death in the lodging house – with some sources claiming that they were not Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and that Butch, at least, made it back to the United States.\n\nHighly fictionalised, their exploits are the subject of the 1969 film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, starring Robert Redford and Paul Newman.\n\nBorn in 1910 in Rowena, Texas, the daughter of a bricklayer who died when she was aged four, Bonnie Parker turned to a life of crime after meeting already convicted criminal Clyde Barrow, nine years her senior, in January of 1930.\n\nTravelling in a series of automobiles and heavily armed with an arsenal of weapons that included automatic rifles, the couple embarked on a crime spree throughout the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Louisiana.\n\nOn some occasions accompanied by others, they were responsible for a string of robberies and murders, including those of two young highway patrolmen and another police officer – but there have been conflicting accounts of what role, if any, Bonnie Parker had in the actual murders.\n\nParker and Barrow were finally ambushed and shot to death in their automobile by a posse of two Texas and two Louisiana police officers in May of 1934 on a rural road in Bienville Parish, Louisiana.\n\nBonnie and Clyde have since been the subject of a number of articles, books and films that include the 1967 Bonnie and Clyde, starring Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty in the title roles."
