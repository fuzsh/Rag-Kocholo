        "text": "One of the greatest problems in teaching The Great Gatsby is the extent to which the novel has been overshadowed by its film adaptations. My students have already seen the Baz Luhrman 2013 film adaptation, just as a previous generation of readers found their experience warped by Robert Redford’s Jay Gatsby. As a result, readers enter the novel primed to take joy in the very aspects of America that the novel repudiates: the clothes, the music, the architecture, the cars of the Gilded Age. Popular culture has blissfully purified the novel of Fitzgerald’s social commentary and moral questions, leaving new readers to expect and celebrate the conspicuous consumption and amoral excess of a society on the brink of collapse.\n\nAt the apex of the 2013 film’s vogue, Gatsby mythology seeped into popular culture through Pottery Barn, and Brooks Brothers, and elsewhere. Fancy a spot of Nick Carraway tea, anyone? American culture has become mesmerized by the spectacle of Gatsby. Like Gatsby’s party guests, we have become like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars.\n\nBecause the novel has become consumed by its own mythology, students tend to take Nick Carraway, the novel’s unreliable narrator. at face value, instead of seeing the glaring gaps in the story he weaves. Readers find themselves unable to see beneath the novel’s surface and become drawn into Carraway’s morally obtuse romanticism. Yet to understand The Great Gatsby, Nick Carraway must be analyzed, for he is central to the novel, ever-present yet always hiding behind his adoration for the titular Jay Gatsby.\n\nThis year, I’ve helped students get beneath Nick’s innocent veneer by focusing on moments in the text that may at first seem insignificant. These are moments of ambiguity and obfuscation that initially do not even give readers pause. Yet it is through such moments that we can see who Nick Carraway really is (or isn’t) and untangle his narrative web and start to see what we are really reading.\n\nIn the remainder of this post, I’m going to share some moments in the text that at first glance appear mundane, but my students have found provocative upon closer examination. You’ll find them itemized below, along with some questions I like to ask my students to stimulate their curiosity. You can pose these questions to students however best fits your classroom: to the whole class, to small groups of students, or as part of individual written assignments. In some cases, I can help my students reach reasonable interpretations of these passages. At others, Carraway remains inscrutable. For this reason, I sometimes title this lesson, “Weird Sh*t Nick Carraway Says.”\n\n“The Dukes of Buccleuch”\n\n“. . . we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business my father carries on today.” (3).\n\nNick makes this statement about his family history so smoothly that my students generally move past it without much thought. So I ask them to paraphrase the passage in their own words, as if they were speaking to someone they’d just recently met. Usually, they remain stymied about what Nick’s getting at, so I ask them to break the passage down into two parts separated by the “but” after the first comma.\n\nFirst, what does Nick mean by tradition? Students gravitate to the definition of tradition as something passed down from generation to generation. Now I might ask, “are traditions always true?” Obviously not, they’ll say. Is there anything wrong with passing down traditions? Not necessarily, they might reply. Every family has traditions.\n\nWe might next try to understand a bit more about this at first glance innocuous tradition by asking “who were the Dukes of Buccleuch?” Nobody knows, so someone googles it and finds that, basically, it’s a super prestigious family title first created in Scotland in 1663. The current Duke of Buccleuch, they might also find, currently owns over 200,000 acres of land in the UK.\n\nThis new information revises our question. What does it mean for a family to say that they are descended from mega-wealthy aristocrats when their actual progenitor was a hardware salesman? Eventually, the class reaches the conclusion that Nick knows he is not descended from the Duke of Buccleuch and has no qualms about lying to people about it. Nick appears obsessed with aristocracy and thinks people will be impressed by his imaginary lineage. At the end of the third chapter, Nick will declare himself “one of the few honest people I’ve ever known. But here on the third page of the novel, Nick has already casually admitted that he is less than scrupulously honest.\n\nAt this point in our analysis, my students begin to think of Nick as what they like to call “sus.” But this passage gets weirder if we keep reading and keep thinking. Nick says he isn’t actually descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but instead from an ancestor who immigrated to the United States in 1851 and “sent a substitute to the civil war.” What does Nick mean by “substitute?” This question yields another google, and students find that during the U.S. Civil War, people who were drafted could evade service by paying a standard fee to the government and then privately hiring someone to take their place in the army. This was a controversial practice at the time, but what implications do this fact hold for Nick and his lineage in 1923, when the novel takes place?\n\nI don’t know the answer to this question, but it seems to matter. At the very least, my students find that this whole substitute business adds another layer of sus. Are we to conclude that Nick’s ancestor holds no firm moral stance on the issue of human slavery? And if so, does this imply Nick can tolerate a high degree of moral ambiguity? Also, for which side of the war did this progenitor hire a substitute? Did Nick’s ancestor hire someone to fight for him on behalf of the Confederacy? I don’t know. Maybe. It seems like it matters, though.\n\n“If Personality”\n\n“If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away” (2).\n\nNick uses this sentence to introduce Jay Gatsby to readers on the novel’s second page. It’s another passage that readers can easily gloss over. It’s a passage that Fitzgerald might mean for us to gloss over because the romantic lyricism of the second part of the passage obscures the highly questionable statement in the first clause. Incidentally, film versions of the novel do not include the first clause.\n\nWhat does it mean, I ask students, to say that “personality” is “an unbroken series of successful gestures?” This example has worked well in teaching close reading because of the opportunity to examine multiple keywords and think about how they work together: “unbroken,” “successful,” and “gestures.” Moreover, I ask students, “is this what “personality” is to you?” Generally, students say it isn’t. They usually say that personality might be observable, but it runs deeper than a mere “gesture.” Main takeaway: Nick has a hard time seeing beneath appearances.\n\n“A small flat-chested Jew”\n\n“A small flat-chested Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment, I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.”\n\nFitzgerald employs this thick visual imagery to describe Meyer Wolfsheim, one of Gatsby’s primary “business” partners (in crime). We don’t commonly think of The Great Gatsby when we think of race in literature, but such blatant stereotypical language has to give us pause. What is at stake here, we might ask our students, in this physical description of a man identified as Jewish? Once this passage is pointed out, it doesn’t take long for students to recognize that despite the distaste Nick shows for Tom Buchanan’s racism earlier in the novel, he himself is pretty racist.\n\n[The 2013 film adaptation tries to avoid anti-semitism by not explicitly referring to Wolfsheim as a “Jew,” but it uses so many visual stereotypes that it’s hard to overlook race. Incidentally, the movie takes racism a step further: Wolfsheim tells Nick “you smell so good,” which, coupled with Wolfsheim’s penchant for jewelry made of human teeth, implies cannibalism, which has been an accusation reserved for only the most savage enemies of civilization. ]\n\nFor a deeper and thoroughly historicist analysis of the novel’s racial discourse see Teutsch, “The Master Race?”\n\nOther Likely Suspects\n\n“I realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no choice but to cut him off there.” Here Gatsby has just invited Nick to participate in some vague opportunity to “pick up a nice bit of money.” “It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing,” Gatsby says. What does Gatsby’s description of his proposal imply about it? Why would this have been one of the “crises” of Nick’s life? What does he mean by “different circumstances?” What is Nick’s basis for declining Gatsby’s offer? (83).\n\n“. . . I was standing up beside the bed and he was sitting between the sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands” (38). Wait what? Holding a “great portfolio?” I would direct you to David Guinta’s insightful piece on Nick’s sexuality if you think you want to unpack this one. Depending on your teaching environment, you might not.\n\n“I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter.” (47). The age of this “girl” is not clear, but generally the phrase “little girl” designates someone pretty young, like ten at the oldest. Why is there a little girl at Gatsby’s party, at this time of night? It seems strange, yet Nick does not remark upon this fact. In the next sentence, Nick says, “I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and profound.” Enjoying himself because of the champagne, or because of the “little girl?” What could be so “significant” or “profound” about this little girl?\n\nI find this last example among the inscrutable things Nick says. But at times it’s the asking that matters. Asking questions helps students build curiosity. Asking questions helps students grasp one of the key tenets of the modernist literary movement of which The Great Gatsby is an exemplar. In modernist literature interpretation is subjective, the truth is ambiguous, right and wrong get gray, and traditional boundaries (race, sexuality, class) are questioned.\n\nAnd in asking questions about these strange things Nick Carraway says, we can teach close reading. Perhaps it isn’t just the mythology of Gatsby that stymies readers, but insufficient training in the art of close reading. Readers are charmed by Nick’s admiration for Gatsby, unable to see what’s beneath. We hesitate to ask questions of the man who declares himself to be “one of the few honest people I have ever known.” But Nick’s declaration itself requires close reading."
