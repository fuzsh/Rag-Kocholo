        "text": "Americans use it as a term, so it's a thing. Just because people don't use it as a term in the UK doesn't invalidate its use or its reality in the US.\n\nHow incredibly ethnocentric and self-centered of you to believe otherwise, OP!\n\nIf this weren't a troll thread, which it is -- the OP has been furiously trying to rile people up with trite anti-UK threads for two days now involving teeth and food -- one could easily google it on one's phone and say to the imaginary PhD, \"Oh look, a thing.\"\n\nIn what century does someone not have access to the internet to look up and show someone else that something is indeed \"a thing\"? Does the OP think most people don't know of this newfangled information superhighway?\n\nHow old is the OP that she can't imagine a scenario where anyone can type 'Scots Irish' into a phone and show the history of Scots Irish? OP is one of those fat lezzies on disability who can only afford a flip phone \"for emergencies only. I don't want to be available all the time!!!\"\n\nThe information age skipped right over OP, sitting at an ancient desktop, trying to make another OCD anti-English-person thread\n\nI only recently found that I am Scots irish. My grandparents were Catholics from Northern Ireland. I knew my grandmother's grandfather had been an Anglo-Irish Protestant who married a catholic and was disowned by his family. But my mother only recently found out that her grandmother on her father's side had been Scottish. Her father never mentioned that his mother was from Scotland. He wanted everyone to believe he was 100% Irish.\n\n\"Scotch\" is used to describe the whisky made in Scotland. And the eggs.\n\nA pope gave the English king license to \"Christianize\" Ireland. After Henry VIII made himself defacto pope of his own church, Catholics resisted conversion. Loyal Scots were sent to displace the native Irish in Ulster, especially resistant to the English king's whims. Thus, the Plantation of Ulster, under Hank, his daughter Elizabeth, the genocidal Cromwell and his glorious revolution, the restoration of monarchy under Dutch William of Orange, etc.\n\nThese are the forebears of the Protestant Loyalists, for whom six of Ulster's nine counties were carved out of Ireland. Picture Mandela agreeing to cutting a white-Afrikaaner-majority territory out of South Africa before liberation, and leaving a group of Blacks still left under Apartheid\n\nSo, this loyal population of Scots planters was useful in populating the American colonies. \"Scots-Irish\", distinct from Highlanders, etc.\n\nIronically, \"Scot\" was a name for the Irish that somehow got attached to Cakedonia, the land beyond Hadrian's Wall.\n\nGlasgow is very similar to Belfast, and answering \"Do ye support Glasgow Celtic or Glasgow Rangers?\" in a manner not to the questioner's liking might get you bashed or worse.\n\nCraig Ferguson's family was partly Irish-moved-to-Scotland. Miss him, not a fan of his Sassenach replacement.\n\nBlack Irish usually are attributed to intermarriage with Spanish traders and invaders.\n\nShanty--almost anyone of Irish Catholic descent started out as shanty; Catholics were excluded from professions for decades. There wasn't much of a middle class or aristocracy. An exception were the Irish who settled in what's considered Central NY State in the late 18th century. Shanty is contrasted with Lace Curtain--people who were well off middle class or wannabes--usually somewhere after the immigrant generation.\n\nScots-Irish--almost entirely Protestants from Northern Ireland; orange Irish. Most people you meet from the South who claim to be Irish are really Scots-Irish. Jim Webb wrote a book about them. Basically they're the guys who kill their wife and kids when she leaves him. There's a reason that Green Irish (people of Catholic derivation) don't consider orange Irish to be real Irish.\n\nMy grandparents both referred to themselves as Scotch. They both grew up in Cape Breton, N.S., though my Grandfather was born in Boston (his parents were working there over the winter). Everyone in both their families spoke Gaelic as a first language (my Grandfather didn't speak English until he started school). Neither has Irish blood that I know of, although my Grandfather's clan name originates in Ireland. My Grandmother's clan was never Irish.\n\nWe always thought we were Irish. Turns out the surname is Scottish. And being protestant, it's pretty well a certainty we only stopped over in Ireland for a few generations on our way to the new world.\n\nSo glad to have dodged that catholic bullet and also to have ended up on this side of the big water where we don't really partake of sectarianism.\n\nThe plantation system was started in Ireland with the potato. The absentee landlords needed someone to collect rents and bully the local population. They certainly couldn't allow Irish to do it because the Irish would make common cause with their fellow countrymen, so they imported score presbyterians to do it. The English wanted as little contact as possible between themselves and the Irish. These Scots were called \"overseers.\"\n\nWhen plantations were started in America, the Scots Irish immigrants were used as overseers. They were really good at the job. They were insular, dour, \"thrifty\" and xenophobic. They treated the black slaves as badly as they treated the Irish, keeping them in abysmal conditions with scant food. The difference was that the scots and the English didn't mind if millions of Irish died, since it would make things easier for them to empty out the land of as many papists as possible. But black slaves had to be imported to America, so they were worth more than the Irish were worth in Ireland.\n\n[quote] Finally, the plantations and their related agricultural development radically altered Ireland's ecology and physical appearance. In 1600, most of Ireland was heavily wooded, apart from the bogs. Most of the population lived in small townlands, many migrating seasonally to fresh pastures for their cattle. By 1700, Ireland's native woodland had been decimated; it was intensively exploited by the new settlers for commercial ventures such as shipbuilding, as much of the English forests had been destroyed and the navy was becoming a great power.\n\nIt's funny, they've tried reforesting in Scotland and Ireland. The scots are ok with it and allow trees to be planted in large numbers in the countryside. But the Irish want nothing to do with it. They don't like trees and they don't want them. Trees drop leaves, requiring raking. They attract animals and the Irish are not the animal lovers that the English are. They went for centuries without pets because they didn't have enough to feed themselves. The only animals they see a need for are food sources (sheep, pigs, chickens) or horses (which are not treated well). They don't want any damned animal-filled trees blocking what little sunlight there is, requiring them to rake up leaves or pine needles. Trees come down in a storm, possibly on a house. No thank you!\n\n[quote]A friend of mine got berated by a British \"friend\" a few days ago after they described themselves this way.\n\nNot surprising. They'd love to a) forget this particular group of people existed since they come off poorly in history (treatment of the Irish and Blacks), and b) forget they don't dictate language and culture the way they did back when \"Scots-Irish\" originated.\n\nIf it helps OP, tell your friend to tell the Brit snot very condescendingly \"or rather, let's speak of 'Ulster Scots' so you'll feel at ease\".\n\nI am Scots-Irish. My grandfather whose name I share gave me a very Irish name, but he himself had a thick Scottish Brogue. My grandmother had a \"Mac\" Scotty name, both were Catholics. Most Scottish people are Presbyterian, and they were the first people I ever heard make Catholic, or Irish jokes.\n\nScots are the sweetest, kindest folks, but usually very troubled and depressed, just to be alive I've observed. Still, never expecting ANYTHING to be easy, or painless does save a lot of time wondering.\n\nR69 Thomas Keneally's \"The Great Shame\" is probably more readable. Ireland's population basically halved from around the era of the American Civil War, a demographic catastrophe which changed it forever.\n\nGoogle \"An Gorta Mor\"-The Great Hunger, and rack rents in Ireland.\n\nThe Ulster Plantation doesn't refer to plantations per se, but to the planting of loyal Scots Protestants to colonize the rebel heartland.\n\nIreland was the laboratory where the English Imperialists honed the tactics with with which they colonized much of the world and her peoples\n\nThe \"Scots-Irish\" were, as has been pointed out, the Bull Conners that did their dirty work. Although, in fairness, many Ulster Protestants are lovely people. But the Orange Order lot are Bib Jones, KKK level fuckers.\n\nEvery word of R62 is true. They were/are miserable, sectarian xenophobes in Ireland and they carried that culture to the U.S. Anyone \"proud\" of being descended from these cretins is scum. Our worst enemies on the right, particularly the religious right, are overwhelmingly Scotch-Irish or influenced by their Southern/Appalachian culture. Pat Robertson is Ian Paisley; they're cut from the same cloth. Disgusted that they claim any part of being \"Irish,\" they are interlopers there and despise the native culture and people.\n\nThe above may have been the experience for some Scots-Irish in America (as overseers for plantations) but the vast majority of Appalachian Scots-Irish were NOT slaveowners.\n\nNow as for their religiosity, I have no idea whether a direct correlation can be drawn from the Northern Ireland experience to the American one. Seems a stretch to me. The surnames may overlap, but an awful lot can change in 250 years.\n\nIf you are poor and of Irish ancestry you are Shanty Irish (because most likely you and your family lived in a shanty.)\n\nMiddle class Irish are Venetian blind Irish (because middle class household could afford Venetian blinds)\n\nUpper class Irish were Lace Curtain Irish\n\nI have been listening to the election overage in the UL and in particular northern Ireland. A large number of Catholics are crossing over to vote for the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland. These Catholic voters support the DUP because of its stand against abortion on demand. These Catholic voters also are middle class and fear a loss of economic standing if Westminster could cede Ulster to Dublin; the UK pumps a lot of money into Northern Ireland, something that the Republic could not afford to do.\n\nLikewise, there are Protestant Republicans who want to severe ties with Westminster and join with Dublin. These voters don't want to be governed by a Parliament and Prime Minister that is located across the Irish Sea on another island. They would rather be governed by an administration on their own island.\n\nThese Catholic Unionists and Protestant Republicans tend to be younger voters. Their parents and grandparents tend to vote along established sectarian lines.\n\nSo much mis-information in these posts it's hilarious. No, dear, the lace-curtain Irish are not called that because they made lace. No, dear, saying the Scots have different size cocks than the Irish is like saying people in Buffalo are bigger than people in Rochester. No dear Brits, just because you're born on the old side of the Atlantic doesn't mean you know anything, including how to play nice with other countries and peoples."
