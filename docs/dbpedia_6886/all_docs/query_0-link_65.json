        "text": "Now the farmer can lower his guard: a new version of Peter Rabbit has allowed Beatrix Potter's most famous character to discover travel, and venture as far as Scotland.\n\nThe quintessentially English rabbit is revealed to have long-lost Scottish connections in a new version of the classic children's story, written by Emma Thompson, the actress.\n\nBut the new adventure of Peter Rabbit is likely to raise eyebrows for another reason, as the book is the first to suggest a political subtext to his adventures.\n\nThompson has outed herself as an opponent of Scottish independence on the eve of publication of The Further Tale of Peter Rabbit â€“ just as it is disclosed that Peter has a Scottish heritage which he relishes.\n\nThompson's new book sees Peter fall asleep in a basket of onions, in which he is unwittingly carried to Scotland where he meets Finlay McBurney, a Scottish rabbit dressed in a kilt, who is described as a \"gentle giant\" and newly-discovered \"distant Scottish relative\" of Peter.\n\nThe story explores the close relationship between the English and Scottish \"cousins\". During his trip to Scotland, Peter takes part in the \"rabbit equivalent of the Highland Games\", where he competes in \"radish hurling\".\n\nIn an interview to promote her latest film, Brave, in which she plays a fictional Scottish queen, Thompson, whose mother Phyllida Law, the actress, is Scottish, warned against creating \"barriers\" to divide Britain \"in an ever-shrinking world\".\n\nThompson, 53, said: \"I understand the romance of it. I understand the passion for it, given that the relationship between the two countries has been so belligerent and so difficult ... I find it difficult to accept it [independence] when borders are still causing so many problems. Why insist on building a new border between human beings in an ever-shrinking world where we are still struggling to live alongside each other?\"\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress has previously said she would be \"incapable of living without Scotland\". She married the actor Greg Wise in 2003 in Dunoon, Argyll and the couple spend half the year at their nearby home with their daughter Gaia. They also have an adopted adult son, Tindyebwa Agaba.\n\nThompson's book is the 24th in the series of Peter Rabbit stories which Potter wrote and illustrated between 1902 and 1930.\n\nPotter's imagined settings for her books are widely believed to be based in the Lake District, where she wrote most of the stories celebrating the English landscape and wildlife.\n\nThe Further Tale of Peter Rabbit will be published on September 6 to mark the 110th anniversary of the original book, which depicted the misadventures of Peter Rabbit after he disobeys his mother's orders and sneaks into a forbidden garden, gorging on vegetables before being chased away.\n\nPublished by Frederick Warne in 1902, it became one of the bestselling classics of all time and led to Potter developing a host of other characters including Mrs Tiggywinkle, Jemima Puddle-Duck and Squirrel Nutkin.\n\nAfter being approached by Frederick Warne to write a new Peter Rabbit instalment, Thompson said: \"I've always loved Beatrix Potter, as a child and then as a mother and all the years in between as well.\n\n\"When Mr Rabbit invited me to write a further tale, I was more honoured than I can say. I hope I don't let him or his extraordinary creator down.\"\n\nThe new book will feature art work by the illustrator, Ellie Taylor, who was raised in Scotland."
