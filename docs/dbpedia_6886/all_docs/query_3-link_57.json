        "text": "Introduction to Angus & Kincardineshire\n\nIn the present-day structure of local government, Angus Council covers the old county of Angus, and Aberdeenshire Council covers the old county of Kincardineshire. It is not intended to provide any significant content for the City of Dundee, which is covered by Dundee City Council.\n\nThis page and the pages for the individual parishes of Angus and Kincardineshire went online in January 2011. There are individual pages for every parish, except Dundee:\n\nParishes in Angus (Forfarshire)\n\nParishes in Kincardineshire (The Mearns)\n\nFormer parishes\n\nSee also List of towns & villages, with links to the relevant parish.\n\nAs parts of the parishes of Alyth and Coupar Angus lay within Angus, and the parish of Fowlis Easter was transferred from Perthshire to Angus, there are also pages for these parishes.\n\nObtaining photos of monuments in kirkyards will be a high priority, and monumental inscriptions will be added individually as they become available. These inscriptions will be linked to images of the monuments in due course.\n\nApart from information about general sources for family history for Angus and Kincardineshire on this page, the material is arranged by parish. As is clear from various remarks in the 1851 census, parish boundaries were still somewhat uncertain as late as the middle of the 19th century, and there were various detached pieces of parishes. So the civil parishes, whose boundaries are shown on older 20th century Ordnance Survey maps published before 1980, are the basis for the arrangement used here.\n\nAs this site is intended as a finding aid, I have not attempted to provide detailed sources for individual items of information provided on the site. But see a Summary of the sources used.\n\nFinally, the National Archives of Scotland, until quite recently known as the Scottish Record Office, are now calling themselves the National Records of Scotland, following their amalgamation with the General Register Office for Scotland. However, the web-sites have not yet been changed, though there is a new home page providing access to both at National Records of Scotland. One can only speculate on the date of the next change of name ...\n\nGeneral sources of information for Angus & Kincardineshire\n\nSee also Wikipedia: Angus; Wikipedia: List of Places in Angus; and Wikipedia: Kincardineshire.\n\nAerial photographs\n\nArchives\n\nBirths, baptisms, banns, marriages, deaths, burials\n\nBirths, Baptisms, Banns, Marriages, Deaths & Burials, before 1855 (Presbyterian Church Registers)\n\nBirths, Marriages & Deaths, 1855 to present\n\nBurial registers, 1855 to present\n\nCatholic registers\n\nCemetery records, 1855 to present\n\nEpiscopal Church records\n\nMonumental inscriptions on gravestones\n\nOld Parish Registers of the Church of Scotland (OPRs)\n\nBooks\n\nBurial registers, 1855 to present\n\nCemetery records, 1855 to present\n\nCensus records\n\nChurches - photographs, architecture & history of the buildings\n\nChurch records\n\nAdministrative records of the Church of Scotland - records of Synods, Presbyteries & Church Sessions\n\nAdministrative records of Seceding Presbyterian Churches - records of Synods, Presbyteries & Church Sessions\n\nBirths, Baptisms, Banns, Marriages, Deaths & Burials, before 1855 (Presbyterian Church Registers)\n\nCatholic registers\n\nEpiscopal Church records\n\nHeritors' records - records of the landowners in a parish who were responsible for maintenance of church property\n\nMinisters\n\nOld Parish Registers of the Church of Scotland (OPRs)\n\nClock & Watch Tax records\n\nCoats of arms\n\nCommissioners of Supply\n\nCourt records - including Burgh Court, Commissary Court, Regality Court and Sheriff Court records\n\nCurrency, weights and measures\n\nDictionaries of the Scots language\n\nDirectories (street and trade)\n\nEducation records\n\nEntails\n\nFarm Horse Tax records\n\nFasti\n\nField names\n\nGazetteers\n\nGravestones, Headstones\n\nGuildry Incorporations\n\nHearth Tax records\n\nHistory\n\nSee the general Books page and also the books listed on pages for individual parishes.\n\nThere are also some short articles about the Howe of the Mearns in Kincardineshire at The History of the Howe, though much of that site is broken.\n\nInventories of the moveable estate of deceased persons\n\nLand and its ownership\n\nLand owners\n\nEntailed estates\n\nMaps & plans\n\nRegisters of sasines - changes of the ownership of land\n\nServices of heirs - or Retours - heirs to land\n\nLaw\n\nLeases of land\n\nLibraries\n\nListed buildings\n\nMaps & plans\n\nMeasures, currency and weights\n\nMilitary\n\nMilitia\n\nMinisters\n\nMiscellaneous web-sites\n\nMonumental inscriptions\n\nMuseums & galleries\n\nNewspapers\n\nNobility, Peerage\n\nNotaries' Protocol Books\n\nPaintings & photographs of places and people\n\nParliament to 1707\n\nParochial Board records\n\nPaupers\n\nPeerage, Nobility\n\nPhotographs of places and people; aerial photos\n\nPoll Tax records\n\nPoor\n\nPopulation figures\n\nProtocol Books of Notaries\n\nRegisters of deeds\n\nRegisters of sasines - changes of the ownership of land\n\nRetours - or Services of heirs - heirs to land\n\nRoads - evidence for old roads\n\nSasines - changes of the ownership of land\n\nSchool records\n\nScots Law\n\nServices of heirs - or Retours - heirs to land\n\nSocieties\n\nSoldiers\n\nStatistics of parishes of Angus & Kincardineshire\n\nLand area of Angus parishes\n\nPopulation statistics of Angus parishes\n\nStatistical Accounts of Scotland\n\nSurnames\n\nTacks of land i.e. leases\n\nTailzies\n\nTax records\n\nClock & Watch Tax records\n\nFarm Horse Tax records\n\nHearth Tax records\n\nPoll Tax records\n\nWindow Tax records\n\nTeinds i.e. tithes\n\nTenancies & tenants\n\nTestaments (wills & inventories)\n\nTombstones\n\nTowns & villages - list of relevant parishes\n\nValuation rolls\n\nVillages & towns - list of relevant parishes\n\nWar memorials and war graves\n\nWeights, measures and currency\n\nWills\n\nWindow Tax records\n\nArchives\n\nIf you plan to visit an archive in person, check beforehand to make sure that the material of interest to you is housed on site or can be brought for your visit.\n\nAngus (Forfarshire)\n\nInconveniently located at Restenneth, a mile east of Forfar.\n\nAngus Archives\n\nThere is no repertory of holdings available at that website.

The growth of Aberdeen, Dundee and other towns also gave rise to later changes to the boundaries of civil parishes.\n\nRegisters of deeds\n\nThe Books of [the Lords of] Council & Session, more familiarly known as the Register of Deeds, held in the National Records of Scotland [NRS ref. RD...] is a huge and only partly indexed collection of legal documents that were - and are - deemed worthy of preservation: bonds, contracts, factories, etc. They are not records of land ownership, which are the Registers of sasines.\n\nThere are published annual indexes, 1661-1696, a few of which can be found at the Internet Archive, e.g. Index to Register of Deeds, 1663. These published indexes are accessible by personal visit to the NRS, and are also held by local archives, libraries and family history societies. The NRS also holds unpublished indexes since 1770 and some earlier 18th century indexes.\n\nThere are also registers of deeds amongst the records of the royal burghs of Arbroath, Brechin, Dundee, Forfar and Montrose.\n\nRegisters of sasines\n\nThese registers record change of ownership of land and other heritable property.\n\nFor records of tenants of farms, see Tenants & tenancies.\n\nThe Registers of Sasines are not available online (nor are any Indexes to them, with one small exception). Only some of the records have been indexed.\n\nThere are three groups of registers: Particular Registers, for every individual county such as Angus or Kincardineshire; a General Register for the whole country; Burgh Registers for each of the Royal Burghs, such as Arbroath, Forfar and Montrose.\n\nThere are the following Particular Registers of Sasines for the counties (excluding property within the royal burghs):\n\nRegisterDatesNRS ref.

These indexes are accessible by personal visit to the NRS, and are also held by local archives, libraries and family history societies\n\nThere are unpublished indexes for Angus from 1701. From 1661, there are unpublished indexes for Aberdeenshire & Kincardineshire. These indexes are accessible by personal visit to the NRS.\n\nGeneral Register of Sasines\n\nThere was also a General Register of Sasines, Reversions, etc. for transactions anywhere in Scotland, especially transactions that involved land in more than one county [NRS RS1/... for the years 1617-1652; RS2/... for 1652-1660; RS3/... for 1660-1868]. There is a published index for 1700-1720, available at Index to General Register of Sasines.\n\nBurgh Registers of Sasines\n\nThere are also burgh registers of sasines for the royal burghs of Arbroath [NRS, in the B4 series], Brechin [NRS B8], Dundee [in Dundee City Archives, ref. DCA B19], Forfar [NRS B26], Inverbervie [NRS B33] and Montrose [NRS B51/3]. There are partial indexes for those of Forfar and Inverbervie. None of the indexes or registers has been published.\n\nRoads\n\nThere is an excellent collection of material, with maps and photographs, at Old Roads of Scotland.

Indexes & summaries of these records from 1544 to 1859 have been published on 2 CDs by the Scottish Genealogy Society and can be bought from the Scottish Genealogy Society's online shop:\n\n\"Retours of Services of Heirs: Inquisitionum ad Capellam Domini Regis Retornatarum Abbreviatio, vols I-III, 1544-1699\"\n\n\"Decennial Indexes to the Services of Heirs in Scotland, vols I-IV, 1700-1859\"\n\nThe first of these discs, in addition to general services of heir, for which the lands are not named, also has separate listings of special services for named lands, a total of 618 for Angus, between 1545 and 1700, and 192 for Kincardineshire, between 1580 and 1700. The disc also lists tutories, i.e. appointments of tutors for orphans and curators for the mentally incapable.\n\nThe format of the information on these two discs, which cover records for the whole of Scotland, is quite different. All the information is in the form of scanned images from printed books, and therefore there is no search facility on either disc, though there are indexes of surnames and places for the first disc. Most of the information on the first disc is in Latin, and it takes some practice to use the disc with confidence. See this slightly out-of-date guide to using the discs. Decennial indexes for the period beginning 1860 are only available by visiting the National Records of Scotland in Edinburgh.\n\nFor Angus, see this summary of the Special services of heir in Angus, 1545-1700\n\nFor Kincardineshire, see this summary of the Special services of heir in Kincardineshire, 1580-1700\n\nThe Services of Heirs for 1544-1700 are available - and searchable unlike the above CDs - at Google Books. Note that Angus is listed under `Forfar' in these books.

Inevitably, the quality of the Old and New Accounts is very variable, being dependent on the knowledge and the enthusiasm of the parish ministers who wrote them.\n\nOld Statistical Account (OSA)\n\nThe Old Statistical Account of the 1790s was the fruit of a proposal by Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster. The accounts of the parishes of Angus and Kincardineshire, written by the parish ministers, are scattered through the various volumes of the Old Statistical Account.\n\nThe volumes of the OSA are available as follows:\n\nvol. 1 vol. 2 vol. 3 vol. 4 vol. 5 vol. 6 vol. 7 vol. 8 vol. 9 vol. 10 vol. 11 vol. 12 vol. 13 vol. 14 vol. 15 vol. 16 vol. 17 vol. 18 vol. 19 vol. 20 vol. 21\n\nNew Statistical Account (NSA)\n\nThe New Statistical Account is an updated version of the above, produced by the parish ministers in the 1830s and 1840s. Volume 11 contains the accounts of the parishes of Angus and Kincardineshire.\n\nFor the NSA, see New Statistical Account, vol. 11, which is fully searchable, though not all the hyperlinks work correctly. Note that the accounts for Kincardineshire follow those for Angus, and that the page numbering restarts for Kincardineshire.\n\nThere is also a plain text version at Plain text version of NSA vol. 11, that suffers from the usual scanning problems.\n\nThird Statistical Account\n\nWilliam Allen Illsley (ed.) - County of Angus (Arbroath: Herald Press, 1977: ISBN 0-90358915-X)\n\nDennis Smith (ed.) - County of Kincardine (Edinburgh: Scottish Academic Press, 1988: ISBN 0-7073-0503-9)\n\nTailzies (Entails)\n\nThe Register of Tailzies [NRS ref. RT/1] records property that was entailed and passed, on the death of the proprietor, to a predetermined succession of owners. A list of tailzies registered for lands in Angus and Kincardineshire, from the 1685 Act of Parliament down to 4 Feb 1784, is at Landowners.\n\nTax Records\n\nClock & Watch Tax Records\n\nFor the period 5 Jul 1797 to 5 Apr 1798 only.

GD...] or in the National Register of Archives for Scotland. There is no guarantee that a record of a tenancy will be extant. Leases granted to tenants are known as tacks, and 19 years was the usual duration of a tack.\n\nNames of tenants are sometimes given on plans of estates.

Most early testaments are simply inventories of the goods of the deceased; it is unusual for there also to be a will. A testament testamentar is a testament that includes a will; a testament dative is one for which the executors have been appointed by a court, rather than nominated by the deceased; even if the deceased leaves a will, if the executors have not been nominated in the will, the testament is dative.\n\nAll original testamentary records for inhabitants of Angus & The Mearns can be seen, without charge, by visiting, in person, the National Records of Scotland in Edinburgh. A small charge is made for paper copies.\n\nIndexes to all extant pre-1926 testamentary records (wills & inventories of moveable property) for inhabitants of Angus & The Mearns can be searched free of charge at ScotlandsPeople. Digital copies of the documents can be purchased at that site, or, if required, paper copies can be purchased. More recent testaments are only available by personal visit or by writing to the NRS.\n\nWills of Soldiers, 1914-1948, are also available at ScotlandsPeople.\n\nThe parishes of Angus & The Mearns, before the Reformation in 1560, mostly belonged to either the diocese of Brechin or the diocese of St Andrews. The pre-reformation Commissary Courts of the individual dioceses continued in existence after the Reformation and continued to administer the registration of testaments until 1823. Thus, before 1823, most testaments were registered in the court books of either the Commissariot of Brechin [National Records of Scotland, NRS CC3] or the Commissariot of St Andrews [NRS CC20]. Some early testaments were registered in the books of the Commissariot of Edinburgh [NRS CC8], irrespective of the residence of the deceased. After 1823, Angus testaments were registered in the Sheriff Court Books of Forfar [NRS SC47], those of Kincardineshire in the Sheriff Court Books of Stonehaven [NRS SC5].\n\nThe following indexes to testaments registered by the Commissary Courts down to 1800 are among those available online. Note that the indexes at ScotlandsPeople are probably more complete and possibly more accurate than the old indexes listed below. In particular, where testaments are listed in these old indexes as having been lost (except for entries in minute books), this refers to loss of the registered copies of the testaments; the original documents (warrants), that were copied into the registers, MAY still exist.\n\nVarious formats can be accessed from links on each of the following pages:\n\nAberdeen, 1715-1800 - earlier records were destroyed by fire\n\nBrechin, 1576-1800\n\nDunblane, 1539-1800\n\nDunkeld, 1682-1800\n\nEdinburgh, 1514-1600 - but only a handful of testaments before 15 Oct 1567\n\nEdinburgh, 1601-1700\n\nEdinburgh, 1701-1800\n\nSt Andrews, 1549-1800\n\nFor further background on testaments, see here.\n\nValuation rolls\n\nValuation rolls of properties in the County of Angus, for the years 1855, 1865, 1875, 1885, 1895, 1905, 1915, 1920, 1925, 1930, 1935 & 1940 only, can be seen at ScotlandsPeople.\n\nFor background on these rolls, see SP: Valuation rolls or NRS: Valuation Rolls.\n\nWar graves & war memorials\n\nThe Scottish Military Research Group\n\nThe Scottish Military Research Group - Commemorations Project\n\nThe Scottish War Graves Project - archive of former site\n\nCommonwealth War Graves Commission\n\nOther links\n\nGeneral Register Office for Scotland - Register House, Edinburgh\n\nGENUKI: Angus - generally very disappointing and out-of-date\n\nGENUKI: Kincardineshire - generally very disappointing and out-of-date\n\nHistoric Environment Scotland - combines former \"Historic Scotland\" and \"Royal Commission on the Ancient & Historical Monuments of Scotland\"\n\nNational Trust for Scotland\n\nOld Roads of Scotland: Angus - with maps and photos\n\nOld Roads of Scotland: Kincardineshire - with maps and photos\n\nPhotopolis: Old Dundee in photographs\n\nRecords of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707\n\nScotlandsPeople - \"The official Scottish genealogy resource\"\n\nScotlandsPlaces - \"Bringing authentic information and images together to help you discover places in Scotland\"\n\nGazetteer for Scotland - a project by the University of Edinburgh & the Royal Scottish Geographical Soc.\n\nScottish Handwriting - \"Online Tuition in the Palaeography of Scottish Documents\"\n\nThe Statistical Accounts of Scotland - see these links\n\nOther pages of this site relating to Angus or Kincardineshire\n\nFreeholders of Angus & Kincardineshire in 1788, 1790, 1811, 1813, 1827 and 1836\n\nSpecial services of heir in Angus, 1545-1700\n\nSpecial services of heir in Kincardineshire, 1580-1700\n\nOfficers of the Forfarshire Militia in 1813\n\nHeirs of line of Alexander Lindsay, 1st Lord Spynie\n\nThe early history of Boysack in Inverkeilor parish\n\nThe Fithies of Boysack and their Kin - miscellaneous notes on Fithie families\n\nStrachan family connexions - James Strachan of Mincing Lane & Tooting (d. 1808) and James Leigh Strachan-Davidson (1843-1916), Master of Balliol College, Oxford\n\nSummary of sources used for this site\n\nAlmost all the information on this site, apart from the monumental inscriptions, can be found easily elsewhere online, if you know where to look.
