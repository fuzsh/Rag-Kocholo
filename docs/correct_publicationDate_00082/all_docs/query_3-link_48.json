        "text": "For many decades I have remembered reading a science fiction story that I had thought was A Canticle for Leibowitz. Having just watched an Extra Credits video about that novel, I realized I have been incorrect, and I'll need to read it. In the first place, the story is barely like I remembered, and in the second, I think the story I remember is by Robert Heinlein. It turns out Canticle was by Walter M. Miller.\n\nMy memory of the story is vague. What I think I remember involves monks in a dystopian future. I'm pretty sure that the protagonist, a monk, at one point plants evidence about himself that he gambled or some such violation. He may have been guided by a mentor to do so. It would not be good for the corrupt leadership to think of you as a totally pure man. Having a known weakness would actually avoid undesired focus on you.\n\nI skimmed through a list of Heinlein Story names, but nothing rung a bell. Does anyone know the story I am partially remembering?\n\nPossibly Heinlein's If This Goes On—.\n\nThe hero isn't exactly a monk, but lives a rather monkish life as part of a military order who provide guards for the Prophet Incarnate, a religious dictator.\n\nAt one point,a more experienced and cynical character slips an incriminating note to the hero, but fears he may have let the eye (read CCTV) see it. He discreetly substitutes another note containing a scheme for winning at dice — also an offence, but far less serious than subversion. He advises the hero that if he thinks he is under suspicion, always try to make the evidence point to a lesser offence, rather than trying to prove lily-white innocence as \"human nature being what it is\" his chances are better. It is later revealed that the authorities did indeed spot the note, and he gets a fatherly warning from his CO about the perils of gambling.\n\nanswered Jun 12, 2019 at 3:27\n\nMike StoneMike Stone\n\n13k11 gold badge4747 silver badges7878 bronze badges"
