The characters are well developed. The author presents the world through the characters' points of view expertly. The setting, a post-nuclear war America, is interesting and the author's vision of a future culture looking back on the technology of today(Well the 1960's when the book was written) is very interesting. The book is broken up into three sections, three time periods, with the monks of St. Leibowitz providing the common thread. Ultimately this is a sci-fi book that is as well conceived and as well written as any piece of literature. Miller Jr. won the Hugo award for this work and it was well deserved."
