        "text": "Isaac Edward Leibowitz was a Jewish electrical engineer working for the United States military at a facility somewhere in the American southwest, presumably in 1960's. Leibowitz survives the nuclear war, or “Flame Deluge”, that destroys human civilization. He regrets his role in the holocaust and becomes a smuggler of books, which have been burned and banned as part of the world’s “Simplification”.\n\nLeibowitz is betrayed and murdered by the “Simpletons”. But his fellow \"bookleggers\" form the Albertian Order of Leibowitz of the Catholic Church, which becomes the instrument of preservation of reading, writing, and knowledge.\n\n“Canticle” begins six centuries after the war. At the successful completion of his Lenten vigil in the desert, Francis Gerard of Utah will be permitted to take his final vows as a Brother of the Order of the Blessed Leibowitz.\n\nHe accidentally finds a buried fallout shelter. Digging their way into it, the monks find the lunch pail and tool box of the “Beatus” (Latin for “Blessed”, the stage before sainthood), a list for things to take home to “Em”, a design in white lines on blue paper, and some “charms”. These allow Leibowitz's sainthood.\n\nBut his rescued books are not read, just preserved as part of the “Memorabilia”. The \"drawing\" (a blueprint of a weapons-control component) and \"charms\" (transistors), are simply relics.\n\nEarth rebuilds but is again destroyed by nuclear war. The Order sends humans to a new home in the stars, just in time."
