Spanning thousands of years, the story chronicles humanity's attempt to rebuild from the ashes of nuclear war. It unfolds within a Catholic monastery, where the monks of the Albertian Order of Leibowitz toil to collect and preserve scientific knowledge, awaiting a time when humanity is again ready—and worthy—to wield it. Suffice to say, the tale does not end well.\n\nHardcover. First Edition, First Printing. Octavo, bound in quarter cloth with mauve colored boards. New York: Lippincott, 1960. Hugo Award winner (1961). Pringle, Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels (30). #10763.\n\nFine in near fine dust jacket with some darkening and soiling along spine but only visible on the verso side. Externally, the jacket is bright and attractive, with only slight rubbing and minor wear to extremities. A lovely copy."
