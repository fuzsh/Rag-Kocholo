        "text": "Hi everyone! I never did keep up with my Struggling Through the Classics articles but they dominate the blog’s Google Searches, so thank you all! Up next is a classic that I was lucky to buddy read with some awesome sci-fi enthusiasts. Let’s jump right in.\n\nHere’s an outline so you know what to expect from this post:\n\n1) Book Facts & Synopsis\n\n2) Major Themes\n\n3) My Overall Thoughts\n\n4) Ease & Enjoyment Level\n\n5) Is It Still Relevant Today\n\n6) Verdict: is it worth the struggle?\n\nBookish Quick Facts\n\nTitle: A Canticle For Leibowitz\n\nAuthor: Walter M. Miller Jr\n\nPublished: 1959\n\nLength: 320 Pages\n\nNotable: Won the 1961 Hugo Award for Best Novel\n\nHere’s the Synopsis\n\nIn the depths of the Utah desert, long after the Flame Deluge has scoured the earth clean, a monk of the Order of Saint Leibowitz has made a miraculous discovery: holy relics from the life of the great saint himself, including the blessed blueprint, the sacred shopping list, and the hallowed shrine of the Fallout Shelter.\n\nIn a terrifying age of darkness and decay, these artifacts could be the keys to mankind’s salvation. But as the mystery at the core of this groundbreaking novel unfolds, it is the search itself—for meaning, for truth, for love—that offers hope for humanity’s rebirth from the ashes.\n\nFrom Am*zon\n\nMain Themes\n\nOk. For the historical background, Miller was a WWII veteran who was part of the airstrike which decimated the oldest Christian monastery in Italy. It was a protected historic site and the overall impact of this (and the war in general) on Miller’s spirit was profound.\n\nThe main theme of A Canticle For Leibowitz is mainly cited to be the cyclical nature of humanity, and I think that needs to be broken into two points. One is (good side) how we claw at the preservation of hope and humanity even in the worst of nuclear times. The other (evil side) is how despite having this knowledge of consequences, humans inherently keep pushing destruction even if it’s going to reset us back to a dark age.\n\nWe will destroy and we will preserve.\n\nThe cyclical nature of the plot is pretty obvious, right down to the fathers being named from Arkos to Zerchi. The monks have preserved this knowledge from texts and blueprints, not even knowing what it is, just for the time when the world becomes enlightened again.\n\nThere are other more pointed themes like church vs state, euthanasia, how we handle tests of personal faith, and how religion shapes and endures over the centuries.\n\nI’ve been thinking a lot about whether the book is a satire or not, and I think it’s more along the lines of black humor when dealing with terrible subject matter. So yes, it’s satirical, but is it meant to be a satire?\n\nMy Thoughts\n\nOverall I did enjoy the read, although it was not an easy one. I might not have finished if I wasn’t buddy reading with some highly intelligent people who pushed me through it with their insights and comments.\n\nThe hardest part for me personally is not having the religious background to really know what he’s talking about sometimes. I feel like I probably missed a lot of the religious commentary, both historical and moral\n\nThe book shifts between satirical, hilarious banter, bumbling monk shenanigans, running eyeball jokes, and more truly enjoyable reading, with these long passages of incredibly dense reflection on religion and sociopolitical happenings. There was little inbetween of “Wow, this is great’ and “I need visine because my eyes have glazed over”.\n\nI love that the monks are kind of just bumbling along in the dark doing what they think is their sacred calling. It’s a shot in the dark in more ways than one. The naivety is true and hilarious since they have no context for their task except that it probably might be useful someday.\n\nThe Sacred Shopping List and the Poet’s Eyeball probably had me cracking up the hardest. As I said, enjoyable but difficult at times.\n\nReading Ease & Enjoyment Level\n\nI already covered this above for the most part. It’s a difficult book for sure but has plenty of enjoyable content. It’ll keep you thinking. Some parts are enjoyable, some is way too dense for me, and there’s not much of a gray zone.\n\nIs It Still Relevant Today?\n\nOh yes, with the wars and genocides and many conflicts still going on. Nukes comes up in the news all the time in various context and I kind of can’t believe it’s still a thing. We are truly doomed to keep repeating our past mistakes it seems!\n\nA Canticle For Leibowitz influenced parts of the Fallout game as well so if you are a fan of that, it’s worth reading. It’s also a screaming warning to preserve knowledge and not to ever go down nuclear roads again.\n\nIs It Worth the Struggle?\n\nNow we get to the crux of it all.\n\nYes, It was a struggle. Yes, I think it was worth it\n\nWhen reading Hugo or other award winners I always like to ask myself if I think it deserves the award: I say yes, as it is still being read and discussed so many years later\n\nIf you’d like a different form of review, a buddy reader reviewed HERE\n\nHe also has a link in case you’d like to join future buddy reads or come talk scifi in general\n\nIf you’d like to check out some more of my classical struggles:\n\nZorba the Greek\n\nThe Hunchback of Notre Dame\n\nThe Scarlet Letter\n\n1984\n\nDr Jekyll & Mr Hyde\n\nLet me know what you think!"
