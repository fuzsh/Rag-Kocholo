LIPPINCOTT COMPANY\n\nHardcover with dust jacket in good condition.\n\nDust jacket is in fair shape; colors are vibrant; Price of $4.95 in tact on front panel. Dust jacket torn in several places [edge tears, surface tear on spine] and some larger sealed tears]-- some staining on back. Housed in protective mylar\n\nBook itself is very good. Binding is tight. Spine slightly cocked in one spot. Boards are clean w/ some mild darkening to edges. Pages read as new. w/ the exception of some fait spotting along spine on title page. [see photos]\n\nOverall a very clean and tight copy of this rare edition!\n\nIn a nightmarish ruined world slowly awakening to the light after sleeping in darkness, the infant rediscoveries of science are secretly nourished by cloistered monks dedicated to the study and preservation of the relics and writings of the blessed Saint Isaac Leibowitz. From here the story spans centuries of ignorance, violence, and barbarism, viewing through a sharp, satirical eye the relentless progression of a human race damned by its inherent humanness to recelebrate its grand foibles and repeat its grievous mistakes."
