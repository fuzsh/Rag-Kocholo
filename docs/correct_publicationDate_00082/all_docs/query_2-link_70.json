Miller Jr. originally released on the Nishi netlabel in 2005, this revised Director&#39;s Cut was produced in 2016 from the original masters. \r\n\r\nThe original novel told the story of the Earth&#39;s fall, rise, and fall after a nuclear war, following a group of monks in the desert of the Southwest of what was formerly the United States, who dedicated themselves to preserving the knowledge that had been lost after the Great Flame Deluge. The story was divided into three sections, taking place in three different time periods:\r\n\r\nPars PRIMA: FIAT HOMO, circa 2600 Anno Domini.\r\nPars SECUNDA: FIAT LUX, circa 3174 Anno Domini.\r\nPars TERTIA: FIAT VOLUNTAS TUA, circa 3781 Anno Domini.\r\n\r\nMy album follows the story of the book chronologically, merging music and proposed sound design for the book, which has never been adapted for film. A radio dramatisation was produced by NPR in the United States in the 1980s.",
