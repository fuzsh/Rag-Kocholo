        "text": "A Canticle for Leibowitz\n\nAuthor: Walter M. Miller Jr.\n\nGenre: Science Fiction\n\nYear: 1959\n\nRating: 10 of 10\n\nI had intended to read this book for a long time and I wish that had not put it off for so long. Strikingly beautiful writing and a profound story about the cycle of human folly. I often gravitate to science fiction that deals with spiritual issues (there is not enough of it) and this book delivers in that regard. The book is written in three sections, each centuries apart. This structure has the interesting effect of not really having a main character, not a human one at least. The story focuses around an abbey and the building is essentially the main character. This device becomes even more interesting when you read Miller’s bio. During the war he was involved in the destruction of one of the oldest western monasteries. In a chilling way one cannot help but think that this beautiful book was written as an atonement for the crimes of war. Some of the passages I had to read and reread because of the density and depth of the ideas being expressed. This is one of those stories that will have me contemplating its meaning for a long time. Do yourself a favor and read this one.\n\nPurchase: Buy!"
