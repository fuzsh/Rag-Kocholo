        "text": "In December, I had this idea to start a book club with my close friends and see where it goes, because I need to connect with other bookworms üòÇ December was Science Fiction month and after a vote in the book club we decided for : A Canticle for Leibowitz by Walter M Miller Jr.\n\nAfter a few first pages reading this book, one thing for sure, it is not an easy read. You start from having no clue what‚Äôs this world about but the only reasonable thing to do is to adapt and cope and hope for the better. The rhythm then came naturally to me and I was absorbed by the humour and witty replies.\n\n‚ÄúComparable in theme and prose to Dune and Foundation, A Canticle for Leibowitz deserves its spot in that sci-fi toplist. Following the story of a monastery through the ages as a preserver of faith, hope and knowledge, Miller Jr. tells a timeless tale that draws parallel with the actual historical role of religion.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì William\n\nThe pace is definitely not for everyone, it‚Äôs heavily religious and slow building.\n\n‚ÄúAlthough A Canticle for Leibowitz is considered by many a science fiction classic, I found the Walter M. Miller Jr. slow approach to easing readers into the overarching storyline and predictability to be a hindrance namely to the author‚Äôs testament to the age-old adage that history inevitably repeats itself and consequently to what could have been my overall enjoyment of the novel.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì Alexa\n\nThe book is separated into three sections which can be seen as novellas. The separation of the three marks the different in times and the denunciation of a endlessly cycle of humanity."
