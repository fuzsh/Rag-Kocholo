        "text": "Hello! Up for sale is a Hardcover copy of the landmark Science-Fiction novel A CANTICLE FOR LIEBOWITZ by Walter M. Miller, Jr. This novel won the Hugo Award for Best Novel & is widely-regarded as one of the greatest works of Science Fiction. Originally published in 1959 in serialized format, this edition was republished in 1975 by Gregg Press as part of the \"The Gregg Press Science Fiction Series\", which was intended to republish classics of the genre for new audiences. The books in the series were uniformly bound in green buckram with titles stamped in gold on a red background. Edited by David Hartwell, the book contains an introduction by Norman Spinrad. The book is in Good condition, with light wear. There are no dings, scratches or bumps to the boards, however there are a few markings to the boards as well as to the bottom edge of the pages, including what appears to be some very light moisture stains at the bottom corner of some of the latter pages. A prior owner wrote on the rear endleaf in ink. There is no dustjacket, as issued. Please let me know if you have any questions!"
