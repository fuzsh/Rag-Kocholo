        "text": "Title: A Canticle for Leibowitz\n\nAuthor: Walter M. Miller Jr\n\nPublisher: Orbit\n\nDate: 2020 (1959)\n\nGenre: Science fiction\n\nSummary: In a nightmarish ruined world slowly awakening to the light after sleeping in darkness, the infant rediscoveries of science are secretly nourished by cloistered monks dedicated to the study and preservation of the relics and writings of the blessed Saint Isaac Leibowitz. From here the story spans centuries of ignorance, violence, and barbarism, viewing through a sharp, satirical eye the relentless progression of a human race damned by its inherent humanness to recelebrate its grand foibles and repeat its grievous mistakes.\n\nI went into this book not knowing what to expect, except some sort of post-apocalyptic world, and I was immediately drawn in by Miller’s vision and his use of religion. I’ve never read anything like this and it was amazing.\n\nThe book is split into three sections, each a separate story, but they come together to make a coherent whole that explores how civilisation rebuilds after a nuclear war.\n\nI think the first section was my favourite and it’s set in a Catholic monastery in the desert of the southwestern United States. Brother Francis, a 17-year-old novice living in the twenty-sixth century, encounters a vagrant Wanderer (who I thought was Miller’s interpretation of the Wandering Jew but I could be wrong) in the desert and this encounter results in Francis discovering an ancient fallout shelter containing artifacts belonging to Leibowitz, his order’s founder. This section, Fiat Homo (“Let There Be Man”), was such a strong opening for me because it felt oddly familiar (in regards to our own history) and yet I had no idea what was going on. I’d been dropped unceremoniously into a world that I couldn’t recognise and yet humanity still seemed somewhat the same. I was discovering this world alongside the monks who were trying to piece together the history of their own world and I loved this form of worldbuilding. Brother Francis was such a compelling character and I grew to love him, in a very strange way. His naivety, his curiosity, and his eagerness were endearing characteristics and I wanted him to succeed.\n\nThe second section was interesting but, in my opinion, somewhat harder to follow. I didn’t enjoy it as much as I did the first section. It’s supposed to be the ‘Renaissance’ after the medieval-like age that was depicted in the previous section and it’s an age of rediscovery. It just seemed so brief compared to the first section. I’m not sure how it actually compares in terms of page numbers but the first section was drawn out and everything was explored in detail whereas this section seems to race forward. I guess that’s fitting, considering the eras that they mirror, but I feel like it lacked the depth of the first section.\n\nThe final section was upsetting. I know that this is a post-apocalyptic social science fiction novel and it’s not supposed to offer me any hope at the end but damn, the ending was rough. I don’t want to spoil it but the cyclical nature of human society is one of the book’s major themes and the ending was so, so sad. I did like how Miller included some of the major debates of his (and our) time though because it not only acts as commentary on the time in which he was writing but it also acts as commentary on human civilisation as a whole.\n\nAs a whole, this is an intelligent, well-written book and I’d highly recommend it. It’s truly wonderful and I’ve never read anything like it before.\n\nThe StoryGraph | Bookshop.org UK*"
