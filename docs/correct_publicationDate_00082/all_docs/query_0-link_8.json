        "text": "Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott, 1960. First edition. A Fine copy of the book, in like dust jacket, retaining the scarce publisher's promotional wrap-around band with reviews by Ray Bradbury and Carlos Baker. Book is nearly pristine with just a hint of foxing to the closed page block. Dust jacket in exceptional condition with only the most trivial rubbing at the spine folds. Wrap-around band also in Fine condition. Very scarce in superior condition, including the wrap-around band.\n\nWalter M. Miller’s groundbreaking first novel, published in 1960. \"A Canticle for Leibowitz\" follows an order of monks who preserve the knowledge of humanity in the wake of a nuclear holocaust. The work was extremely influential - and science fiction critic David Cowart lauded it “…for many readers as the best novel ever written in the genre.” The work was partly inspired by Miller’s own horrifying wartime experiences as a bomber crewman in Italy, during World War II. The book would win a Nebula Award for best novel in 1960. “…[A]n extraordinary novel.” (Contemporary review in the Chicago Tribune) Fine in Fine dust jacket. (Item #1655)"
