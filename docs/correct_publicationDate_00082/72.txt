Walter M. Miller Jr. wrote A Canticle for Leibowitz fifteen years after serving as a soldier during World War II. The novel was inspired by Miller’s regret at having taken part in the destruction of Montecassino Abbey, the oldest monastery in Europe. This classic work of science fiction begins in the candlelit abbey of Saint Leibowitz, set in what appears to be the Dark Ages. That is, until the discovery of a dilapidated fallout shelter reveals that this story is not, in fact, situated in the Middle Ages, but in the aftermath of the “Simplification.” This anti-intellectual movement incited book burnings and championed radical illiteracy in response to a nuclear holocaust that brought the human race to the brink of extinction. Now, it is up to the Albertian Order of Leibowitz, a community of Catholic “bookleggers,” to safeguard the “Memorabilia”—a fragmented archive of human knowledge—until humanity is ready for it again. At once fatalistic and hopeful, A Canticle for Leibowitz cautions humankind to temper technological development with an unwavering reverence for the human spirit. Fans of Cixin Liu, Pierre Boulle, and Ray Bradbury will appreciate this thought-provoking tale that strives to liberate humanity from a cycle of destruction as old as time.
