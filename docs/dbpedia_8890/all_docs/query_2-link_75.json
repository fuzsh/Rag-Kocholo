        "text": "Mick Hucknall of Simply Red fame is selling his Sicilian country home at the foot of Mount Etna, which includes a former mill and the estateâs \"Il Cantanteâ vineyard.\n\nThe historic millstone dates back to 1760 and sits in its own private museum within two-story rural property. Other exhibits include an old press and old winemaking equipment dating back to the 19th century.\n\nThe 400 square metre home boasts 11 rooms and five bathrooms and has two separate entranceways. The rear garden has views overlooking the Ionian Sea.\n\nSinger-songwriter Mick Hucknall first spent a holiday on Sicily and fell in love with the country house. He bought the property and cultivated the âIl Cantanteâ vineyard on several hillsides around Mount Etna together with the wine grower Salvo Foti.\n\nThe property is for sale for EUR 650,000 (US $890,000) and is being brokered by Engel & VÃ¶lkers.\n\nThe two-story property's historic millstone dates back to 1760"
