        "text": "Born and raised in Manchester, Mick's favourite football team in Manchester United and 'simply red' is a nod to the team's colours.\n\nThere he is just hanging out with Sir Alex Ferguson, the former manager of Man Utd.\n\nThis is possibly one of the most fun facts of all time but when Martine and Mick were dating, she had had a few drinks too many and managed to vom all over his lovely hair.\n\nIn her own words, this is what happened:\n\n\"I was quite nervous to be on a date with him. I just kept drinking, and I wasn't really eating, and then the next thing we're getting in a car and as the engine went over, my mouth went 'Grrr'.\n\n\"He said, 'Sorry?', thinking I said something, and I just went 'Borrrrr'. All over him.\"\n\nYou can read more about that pukey night here.\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian, he estimates that he slept with 3, 000 women in the space of three years.\n\n\"When I had the fame, it went crazy... Between 1985-1987, I would sleep with about three women a day, every day. I never said no. This was what I wanted from being a pop star. I was living the dream and my only regret is that I hurt some really good girls.\"\n\nAll through school, Mick says that he was bullied over the colour of his hair. In an interview with the Guardian, he compares the abuse that redheads get to racism.\n\n\"I've read some amazingly derogatory things about me over the years and I've sat there and thought: if you replaced \"ginger\" with \"black\" or even \"Asian\", you'd be up in front of a judge.\""
