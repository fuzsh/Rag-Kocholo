        "text": "It’s ending. Simply Red‘s last show is tonight, and I’ve only seen them live once!\n\nI know that my European friends think that we in the U.S. get all the good concerts. Not true, for a lot of the music that I like. Remember when we vilified Michael Jackson? He was touring everywhere but the U.S. One of my favorites, Marcus Miller, is always touring Europe. Such was the case for my group, Simply Red. Last year, they had only 2 U.S. shows….L.A. and New York City. I looked at the logistics for both, and waited until I found out that the L.A. show was sold out, and ticket agencies were selling them for over $300.00! I was crushed. Had I known it would be their last time in the U.S., I might’ve taken on a second job to get there.\n\nYes, I dig them. I think during the MTV days, watching Mick Hucknall’s pitiful looking self in videos had me curious about this man. He reminded me of a couple of my nephews. Did he have a bit of “brother” in him, I wondered? Dude had a soulful sound about him. But he was not attractive, in the days of the pretty boys like Duran Duran.\n\nBefore their album “Stars” came out, with the title song and “Something Got Me Started”, I was mesmerized by the song “It’s Only Love”. As much as I love Barry White, I had no idea that it was a cover of Barry’s song. Doesn’t matter, to this day, I love Mick’s version, too. I actually purchased “Stars” on cassette…yes-cassette. “I hope you comprehend”.\n\nMy cousins were visiting Miami once, and happened upon a Simply Red show, and they said that it was great. They are NOT Simply Red fans, believe me. So I kept my eyes on the papers, wondering when they would come to Chicago, where I was living at the time. Well, about 5-6 years later, I saw it-Simply Red at the House of Blues! I snatched up 2 tickets, convincing Deidre to go with me. We viewed the concert from the “Foundation Room” at the very top of the venue, and Mick was singing his butt off! The band was tight! Mick could not dance! Aiyeeee! Such a soulful sound with such non-soulful movement! Poor thing.\n\nI went home satisfied, that they finally made it across the pond, and continued to look for their concerts. To no avail. The Simply Red site had them in every corner of the world, but here. I saw the DirectTV concert from Taormina, Sicily, from the Greek Theatre that I had visited with my Mom years ago. Damn it! Come to the U.S.!\n\nSo, Simply Red will be no more as of December 20th. Their last show is at London’s O2 Arena, even with the snow. I heard that there would be a simulcast–yeah, there is, for England and Europe, not for me.\n\nI am hoping that Mick tours as a solo act. I hear he has confessed to bedding over 3000 women in his 25 years of touring. Really?!\n\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/dec/02/mick-hucknall-simply-red\n\nThen again, he was once engaged to Catherine Zeta Jones, so he must have a certain appeal!\n\nHis current honey knows something too…\n\nAnd truthfully, I was shocked by this CD Cover. Looking good, Mick!\n\nGoodbye to Simply Red….I hardly knew ye, live. I truthfully do hope that I’ll get a chance to check Mick out again, in the States, in a more intimate setting. ‘Cause I’m so not over you……\n\nPassionately Yours,\n\nLoryG"
