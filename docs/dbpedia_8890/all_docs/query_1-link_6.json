        "text": "Who is Mick Hucknall?\n\nMick is an English singer-songwriter. He achieved worldwide fame in the 1980s as the lead singer of soul-pop band Simply Red.\n\nHe is often described as one of the greatest 'blue-eyed soul' singers.\n\nHe first found his love for music when attending the Lesser Free Trade Hall show in Manchester in June 1976 where the Sex Pistols were playing their first gig.\n\nMick soon formed his first band The Frantic Elevators in the late 1970s.\n\nHow old is Mick Hucknall and where is he from?\n\nMick was born on June 8, 1960. He celebrated his 61st birthday in 2021.\n\nHe was born in Saint Mary's Hospital, Manchester, and is an only child.\n\nHis mother abandoned the family when he was aged just three, which later inspired him to write 'Holding Back the Years'.\n\nHe was brought up in Denton by his father Reginald (1935â€“2009), a barber in Stockport\n\nIt wasn't until the mid-1990s that he reconnected with his mother Maureen, who was by then living in Dallas. In 2008, he revealed that he had seen her twice since she left the family."
