        "text": "Happy Sunday! It’s a rainy weekend in my neck of the woods of central New Jersey, U.S.A. Because of that and high winds, Rock the Farm, a great annual tribute music festival for an important cause I’ve frequently covered, most recently here, was rescheduled until next June – certainly the right decision under the circumstances but still a bummer!\n\nAll of that makes me feel even more like firing up the imaginary music time machine and escape the present reality for some time. Regardless of the weather or other things that may be on your mind, as always, I hope you’ll join me on the trip, and we can have a great time together!\n\nCount Basie Orchestra/Splanky\n\nFor our first stop today, we shall set the time controls to January 1958. Picking a winter month in New York City may seem a surprising choice to escape bad present weather, but when the music is great, you can have sunshine on any rainy day. And greatness is certainly what jazz pianist Count Basie and the Count Basie Orchestra, delivered on The Atomic Mr. Basie. Initially titled Basie, aka E=MC2 and reissued in 1994 as The Complete Atomic Basie, this studio album by Basie and his big band features compositions and arrangements by jazz trumpeter Neal Hefti. Here’s the groovy Splanky – feel free to snip along!\n\nHumble Pie/I’ll Go Alone\n\nNext let’s head to August 1969 and As Safe As Yesterday Is, the debut album by Humble Pie. While the English rock band had been formed in January that year by guitarists and vocalists Peter Frampton and Steve Marriott, formerly of The Herd and Small Faces, respectively, the record’s release was delayed due Marriott’s Small Faces touring commitments and Frampton’s legal problems with his old management. By the time As Safe As Yesterday Is appeared, Humble Pie already had recorded enough material for at least three albums. I’ll Go Alone is one of two tracks solely written by Frampton who also sang it. Back in July, I finally caught him alive. While Frampton is battling a progressive muscle wasting disorder and performed seated, he still sounded great!\n\nHarold Melvin & the Blue Notes/If You Don’t Me By Now\n\nTime to pay a visit to the ’70s, more specifically August 1972, which saw the release of an album featuring one of the most beautiful Philly soul ballads I can think of: If You Don’t Know Me By Now by Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes. The song appeared on the group’s debut album I Miss You, which was later reissued as Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes. Yes, it’s lush, but what a vocal gem – I don’t wanna sound overly sentimental, you just don’t hear much singing like this anymore. If You Don’t Know Me By Now was co-written by songwriting and production team Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff who formed their own label Philadelphia International Records and are credited for creating the Philly sound. In 1989, Simply Red recorded an incredible cover of that song and scored a major international hit.\n\nTalking Heads/And She Was\n\nIt’s hard to follow the beauty of Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes, but our trip must continue. And on we go to June 1985 and Little Creatures, the sixth studio album by art pop and new wave band Talking Heads. Overall, it became their most successful album, with more than 2 million copies sold in the U.S. alone and top 20 chart positions in multiple countries, including no. 1 in New Zealand. The big hit single off that album was Road to Nowhere, which was very popular in Germany and got the group on my radar screen. Here’s the follow-up And She Was, which like Road to Nowhere and the majority of the other tracks was penned by front man David Byrne, a vocalist with a distinct style.\n\nLyle Lovett/She Makes Me Feel So Good\n\nBy now you may have noticed we’re going chronologically this time. Does the lack of the traditional zig-zag time travel reflect my reluctance to go back to the present? Perhaps a bit, though my primary thought is it can’t hurt to change things a little every now and then. Okay, on the ’90s and an artist I pretty much know by name only: Lyle Lovett. The singer-songwriter from Houston, Texas oftentimes appears to be categorized as country. While I no longer regard this label as terrible, I believe there’s much more to his music. Case in point: She Makes Me Feel So Good, a Lovett composition that has a neat jazzy groove with soulful vocals. This great track is from Lovett’s fourth studio album Joshua Judges Ruth, released in March 1992.\n\nMelissa Etheridge/Juliet\n\nFor our sixth and final stop, we’re making a big jump back to the present and a great rock artist fellow blogger Dave from A Sound Day covered earlier this week, which inspired this pick: Melissa Etheridge who I instantly loved when I first heard Bring Me Some Water, off her eponymous debut album from May 1988. Etheridge is currently doing a 10-week residency at New York Broadway venue Circle in the Square Theatre. In an obvious nod to that engagement, she released a cover of On Broadway as part of an EP with the same title on August 25. In addition to the well-known song credited to Barry Mann, Cynthia Weil, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, Etheridge’s latest EP includes two originals. Here’s one of them, Juliet. It’s great she’s still out there rockin’!\n\nWhile I enjoy shaking up The Sunday Six a bit every now and then, what hopefully will never change is including a Spotify playlist of all the tracks we visited during the trip, so here you go! Hope you’ve had some fun on today’s trip and will be back for more music time travel next Sunday!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube; Spotify\n\nHard to believe it’s Sunday again, and we’ve reached the second weekend in spring. In typical tri-state (New Jersey, New York, Connecticut) fashion, we’ve had some wild temperature swings, and for tomorrow, the weatherman has forecast a whooping daytime high of 35 F – keeping fingers crossed they’re wrong like most of the time! Meanwhile, let’s keep the weather behind us and embark on another journey celebrating the music of the past and the present with six tunes.\n\nCarlos Santana/Bella\n\nI’d like to start today’s trip with a beautiful instrumental by Carlos Santana, one of the first guitarists I admired after I had started to pick up the guitar as a 12 or 13-year-old. Santana’s first compilation Santana’s Greatest Hits from July 1971, which spans the band’s first three albums, was one of the vinyl records my six-year-older sister had at the time. While I’m most familiar with the band’s classic period and it remains my favorite Santana music, I’ve also come to like some of their other work. Bella, co-written by Sterling Crew (keyboards, synthesizer), Carlos Santana (guitar) and Chester D. Thompson (keyboards), is from a solo album by Carlos, titled Blues for Salvador. Released in October 1987, the record is dedicated to his son Salvador Santana, who was born in May 1983 and is one of three children he had with his first wife Deborah King. Salvador Santana is a music artist as well, who has been active since 1999 when he collaborated with his father on composing El Farol, a Grammy-winning track from Santana’s hugely successful Supernatural album that came out in June that year.\n\nSteely Dan/Home at Last\n\nLast night, I saw an outstanding tribute band to Steely Dan, Sting, Stevie Wonder and Gino Vannelli. I’ve covered Good Stuff on previous occasions, for example here. After having felt skittish about going to concerts for the longest time, I’ve recently resumed some activities. It felt so good to enjoy some top-notch live music! As such, I guess it’s not a surprise that Messrs. Walter Becker and Donald Fagen are on my mind. While they have written many great songs, the one album I keep coming back to is Aja, a true masterpiece released in September 1977. Here’s Home at Last. That’s kind of how I felt last night!\n\nThe Chambers Brothers/Time Has Come Today\n\nAll righty, boys and girls, the time has come to go back to the ’60s and step on the gas a little with some psychedelic soul – coz, why not? The inspiration for this next pick came from a playlist titled 60s Rock Anthems, which I saw on Spotify. Regardless of whether you consider Time Has Come Today by American psychedelic soul group The Chambers Brothers a “rock anthem,” I think it’s a pretty cool tune. The title track of their debut album from November 1967 became the group’s biggest hit single, climbing to no. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. The trippy song was co-written by brothers Willie Chambers (vocals, guitar) and Joseph Chambers (guitar), who made up the band together with their brothers Lester Chambers (harmonica) and George Chambers (bass), along with Brian Keenan (drums). Since the studio cut came in at 11 minutes, they edited it down to 2:37 minutes for the original single. Subsequently, there were also 3:05 and 4:45-minute single versions. Since we don’t do things half-ass here, of course, I present you with the full dose – sounds like a tasty stew of early Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix!\n\nThe Style Council/Shout to the Top\n\nAfter the previous 11-minute psychedelic soul tour de force, I thought something more upbeat would be in order. The other day, I remembered and earmarked British outfit The Style Council. Formed in late 1982 by singer, songwriter and guitarist Paul Weller (formerly with punk rock band The Jam) and keyboarder Mick Talbot (formerly of Dexys Midnight Runners, among others), The Style Council became part of a wave of British pop outfits that embraced blue-eyed soul and jazz. Others that come to mind are Simply Red, Matt Bianco and Everything But The Girl. Shout to the Top, written by Weller, was the group’s seventh single that came out in October 1984. It was included on the band’s sophomore album Our Favourite Shop from June 1985 and part of the soundtrack of the American romantic drama picture Vision Quest released in February of the same year. Warning, the catchy tune might get stuck in your brain!\n\nBlue Rodeo/5 Days in May\n\nOur next stop takes us to the ’90s and some beautiful Neil Young-style Americana rock. Blue Rodeo are a relatively recent “discovery.” The first time I featured the Canadian country rock band, who has been around since 1984, was in early December 2021. Borrowing from this post, they were formed by high school friends Jim Cuddy (vocals, guitar) and Greg Keelor (vocals, guitar), who had played together in various bands before, and Bob Wiseman (keyboards). Cleave Anderson (drums) and Bazil Donovan (bass) completed the band’s initial lineup. After gaining a local following in Toronto and signing with Canadian independent record label Risque Disque, the group released their debut album Outskirts in March 1987. Co-written by Keelor and Cuddy, 5 Days in May is from Blue Rodeo’s fifth studio album Five Days in July, first released in Canada in October 1993. It only appeared in the U.S. in September of the following year. The band has since released 16 additional studio albums. I reviewed their most recent one, Many a Mile, here.\n\nFoo Fighters/Medicine At Midnight\n\nOnce again, we’ve reached the final stop of our musical mini-excursion. Late on Friday sad news broke that Taylor Hawkins, who had been the drummer of Foo Fighters since 1997, passed away at the age of 50. The tragic event happened just before the band was scheduled to play a gig in Bogota, Colombia as part of their South America tour. The cause of death is still under investigation but may have been heart-related. I generally don’t follow the Foos and as such know next to nothing about their music. But I think Dave Grohl is a pretty cool dude, and I sympathize with what must be a difficult loss to him and his bandmates, the Hawkins family and Foo fans. An AP story quoted Grohl from his 2021 book The Storyteller: “Upon first meeting, our bond was immediate, and we grew closer with every day, every song, every note that we ever played together…We are absolutely meant to be, and I am grateful that we found each other in this lifetime.” Here’s the title track from Foo Fighters’ tenth studio album Medicine at Midnight released in February 2021. Like all other tracks on the record, it’s credited to the entire band.\n\nHere’s a Spotify playlist featuring all of the above tunes.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Associated Press; YouTube; Spotify\n\nThis is the fourth installment in a row of my recently introduced feature that highlights six random songs I like. I’m becoming cautiously optimistic I can keep up the pace and make this a weekly recurring series.\n\nClannad/Caisleán Õir\n\nIrish folk group Clannad was formed in 1970 in the parish of Gweedore located on the Atlantic coast in northwest Ireland by siblings Ciarán Brennan, Pól Brennan and Moya Brennan, together with their twin uncles Pádraig Duggan and Noel Duggan. Initially known as Clann as Dobhar and since 1973 as Clannad, according to Wikipedia, the group has adopted various musical styles over the decades. This includes folk, folk rock, as well as traditional Irish, Celtic and new-age music, often incorporating elements of smooth jazz and Gregorian chant. Clannad’s eponymous debut album came out in 1973. They have since released 15 additional studio albums, the most recent of which, Nádúr, appeared in September 2013. The group remains active to this day, with Ciarán, Moya, Pól and Noel still being part of the line-up. Pádraig passed away in August 2016. Caisleán Õir is the breathtaking opener of Macalla, their eighth studio album from 1985. It became one of their most successful records, partially because of a collaboration between U2’s Bono and Clannad vocalist Moya Brennan on the tune In a Lifetime. Macalla brought Clannad on my radar screen in the mid-’80s. The vocals on Caisleán Õir, co-written by Ciarán Brennan and Máire Brennan, still make my neck hair stick up. I recommend using headphones for that tune!\n\nFretland/Could Have Loved You\n\nFretland are an Americana band from Snohomish, Wa., which I featured last May in a Best of What’s New installment. Unfortunately, it appears the situation hasn’t changed, and publicly available information on this band continues to be very limited. Fretland were founded by singer-songwriter Hillary Grace Fretland (vocals, guitar). The line-up also includes Luke Francis (guitar), Jake Haber (bass) and Kenny Bates (drums). Could Have Loved You is the opener and title track of the band’s upcoming sophomore album scheduled for March 26. Here’s the official video of the pretty tune, which was written by Hillary Grace Fretland. Her voice reminds me a bit of Sarah McLachlan.\n\nJohn Mellencamp & Carlene Carter/Indigo Sunset\n\nHeartland rock and Americana singer-songwriter John Mellencamp, one of my long-time favorite artists, needs no introduction. To country music fans, the same is probably true for Carlene Carter, the daughter of June Carter Cash and her first husband Carl Smith, who just like June was a country singer. June’s third husband, of course, was the man in black, Johnny Cash. With so much country in the gene pool, it’s perhaps not surprising Carlene became a country artist as well – and a pretty talented one I should add! During Mellencamp’s 2015–2016 Plain Spoken Tour, where Carter opened each show for him, the two artists started writing songs together. Eventually, this resulted in Sad Clowns & Hillbillies, Mellencamp’s 23rd and most recent studio album of original material, which was released in April 2017. Here’s one of the tunes Mellencamp and Carter wrote and performed together, the beautiful Indigo Sunset. I absolutely love this song. Check out the incredibly warm sound. I also think Mellencamp’s and Carter’s voices go perfectly with each other, even though they couldn’t be more different.\n\nSimply Red/If You Don’t Know Me By Now\n\nBritish pop and soul band Simply Red were formed in Manchester in 1985. They came very strongly right out of the gate with their studio debut Picture Book from October 1985. The album, which spawned various popular singles including Money’s Too Tight (to Mention) and Holding Back the Years, brought the group around smooth lead vocalist and singer-songwriter Mick Hucknall on my radar screen. After a four-year break between 2011 and 2015, they remain active to this day and have released 12 albums as of November 2019. Their amazing cover of If You Don’t Know Me By Now was included on their third album A New Flame that appeared in February 1989. It became hugely successful, topping the charts in the UK, Switzerland and New Zealand, and placing within the top ten in various other countries, except the U.S. where it stalled at no. 22. If You Don’t Know Me By Now was co-written by songwriting and production duo Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, who are credited for developing the so-called Philly sound. The tune was first recorded and released in 1972 by Philly soul group Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes. Man, Hucknall’s got soul – so good!\n\nAmerica/Ventura Highway\n\nFormed in London in 1970, folk and pop rock group America was one of the bands my sister unknowingly introduced me to as a 7 or 8-year-old. She had their first greatest hits compilation History: America’s Greatest Hits, a fantastic introduction to the group. I realize the trio that originally consisted of Dewey Bunnell (vocals, guitar), Dan Peek (vocals, guitar) and Gerry Beckley (vocals, bass) sometimes is dismissed as a copy of Crosby, Stills & Nash. Even if you think that’s true, I’d consider it to be a compliment; because that comparison largely stems from America’s harmony singing. How many bands can you name that sing in as perfect harmony as CSN? Or America, for that matter? Anyway, Ventura Highway, written by Dewey Bunnell, is the opener of America’s sophomore album Homecoming from November 1972. Every time I hear that song, I picture myself driving in some convertible on the California coastal Highway 1, with the free wind blowin’ through my hair. BTW, America exist to this day, with Bunnell and Beckley still being around. Peek, who left the group in 1977 and became a born again Christian, passed away in July 2011 at the age of 60.\n\nCream/Strange Brew\n\nYou didn’t really think I could do a Sunday Six without at least one ’60s tune, did ya? Of course, you didn’t! I trust you’ve heard about British rock trio of ingenious bassist and vocalist Jack Bruce, guitar god Eric Clapton and drummer extraordinaire Ginger Baker. Co-written by Clapton, producer Felix Pappalardi and Gail Collins, Strange Brew is the opener of Cream’s second studio album Disraeli Gears that came out in November 1967. If you had asked me, I would have bet Sunshine of Your Love was the highest-charting song from the album. Not so, at least not in the U.K. – turns out Strange Brew climbed to no. 17 there, while Sunshine of Your Love peaked at no. 25. In the U.S. it was different. Sunshine surged all the way to no. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100, while Brew didn’t chart at all. Funny how these things can go – perhaps it was too strange for American taste!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube\n\nFrequent visitors of the blog perhaps may be a bit surprised that I chose to highlight Picture Book by Simply Red. After all, sometimes it may appear I just can’t get enough of classic rock and blues. And while it’s certainly true these two genres form my core wheelhouse, I also enjoy other music.\n\nReleased in October 1985, Picture Book was the debut album by Simply Red. I’ve always dug it for its smooth soul and funky sound and Mick Hucknall’s distinct lead vocals. Before getting to some of the record’s music, I’d like to briefly touch on the band’s background.\n\nSimply Red were formed in Manchester, England in 1984. Surprisingly, and I had not known about this until I read it on Wikipedia, most of the initial members came from musical backgrounds that were very different from Simply Red. Lead vocalist Mick Hucknall’s previous music venture was a punk band called The Frantic Elevators. That band was founded in 1976 and in addition to Hucknall (vocals) included Neil Moss (guitar), Brian Turner (bass) and Kevin Williams (drums). After seven years, The Frantic Elevators called it quits – ironically after the release of their fourth and final single Holding Back The Years had finally gotten them some attention.\n\nFollowing the demise of the Elevators Hucknall teamed up with band manager Elliot Rashman, and they put together a band of local session musicians, which became Simply Red. Their initial line-up consisted of Hucknall (lead vocals), David Fryman (guitar), Tony Bowers (bass), Fritz McIntyre (keyboards and vocals), Tim Kellett (brass, live backing vocals) and Chris Joyce (drums). Bowers, Kellett and Joyce each had previously been members of post-punk bands.\n\nIn 1985, Simply Red got a record deal with Elektra and started working in the studio. After recording one tune, Red Box, which would become the B-side of their first single Money’s Too Tight To Mention, Fryman left the band and was replaced by Sylvan Richardson on guitar. Let’s get to some music from Picture Book.\n\nHere’s the opener Come To My Aid, a funky tune with a catchy melody. Co-written by Hucknall and McIntyre, the track also appeared separately as the album’s second single in August 1985.\n\nOne of my favorite songs on Picture Book is the second track Sad Old Red. I love the jazz and blues groove of the tune, which was written by Hucknall. It’s the kind of music that makes you snip your fingers.\n\nNext up: A fantastic cover of Heaven, which was co-written by David Byrne and Jerry Harrison of the Talking Heads and initially appeared on the band’s third studio album Fear Of Music from August 1979. I like the original but feel Simply Red kicked it up a notch by turning the tune into a beautiful soul ballad.\n\nThe second great cover on the album is the above mentioned Money’s Too Tight (To Mention). The song was co-written by brothers John Valentine and William Valentine who performed as The Valentine Brothers and first recorded it in 1982.\n\nThe last tune I’d like to call out is Holding Back The Years, the previously noted tune by The Frantic Elevators. Co-written by Hucknall and the band’s guitarist Neil Moss, the song also became Simply Red’s most successful single, topping the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and peaking at no. 2 on the U.K. Singles Chart.\n\nSimply Red went on to record nine additional studio albums before disbanding in 2010. By that time, Hucknall was the only remaining original member and Simply Red essentially had become his solo project. In 2015, the band reunited and has since released a new studio album, Big Love, in May 2015 and conducted two anniversary tours.\n\nSources: Wikipedia, YouTube"
