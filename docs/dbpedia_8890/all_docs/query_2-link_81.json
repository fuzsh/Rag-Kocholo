        "text": "Get ready to celebrate the remarkable legacy of one of the UK’s most treasured bands.\n\nIconic soul and pop band Simply Red earmark their forthcoming 40th anniversary by announcing an incredibly special UK & Ireland arena tour for September & October 2025.\n\n\"Simply Red are turning 40! We’re looking forward to marking this special milestone with you all in 2025 on our UK tour” says Mick Hucknall.\n\n“Fans can expect to hear all their favourite Simply Red tracks from 1985 to the present, and enjoy a memorable night celebrating the incredible journey that we've been on together over the past four decades.\"\n\nFew bands have enjoyed the success and longevity of Simply Red. With over 60 million albums sold worldwide, five UK #1 albums, 1.8 billion streams across streaming platforms worldwide, and over 1 million YouTube subscribers, Simply Red remain one of the UK’s most successful and well-loved bands. Their 1991 classic Stars was the best-selling album for two years running in Britain and Europe, and all 13 of Simply Red’s studio albums, including their latest release ‘Time’, have been UK Top 10’s."
