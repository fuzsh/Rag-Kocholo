        "text": "Fan Reviews\n\nMarch 5th 2024\n\nGreat experience, unbelievable voice. It seemed a little odd that when the concert finished, after two hours of show, the band left the scene and the fans just stood up and left without demanding them to return for another song, something that in Greece would go without saying... Hope to be able to watch them in Greece sometime to find out!\n\nAssago, Italy@\n\nMediolanum Forum\n\nstefano\n\nNovember 25th 2023\n\nReally this was one of their best live concert! I would suggest They just should play more songs from the last album TIME...\n\nNichelino, Italy@\n\nPalazzina di Caccia di Stupinigi\n\nPaul\n\nSeptember 18th 2023\n\nIts been a very long time since I was at a live concert but my daughter bought me this VIP Front row experience through events channel for the Pula Coliseum concert in June and built a Croatia trip around this concert. I cannot begin to convey in words how incredible this was for me. Emotional and so surreal to see Simply red on stage in a Roman Coliseum at sunset and to hear my most cherished hits from many different decades was incredible. The acoustics, energy, and being on front row was the best anyone could ask for. I will hopefully, join you again in Glasgow for next year's tour. From Mick Hucknall-Simply Red's song sums it up like this-\"You make me feel brand new\"... Paul W.\n\nPula, Croatia@\n\nPula Arena\n\nPepe\n\nAugust 7th 2023\n\nSpectacular, marvelous show, incredible musicians. I had not experienced a concert like it. Hats off. oeoeoeoeoeoeoeeoe\n\nMurcia, Spain@\n\nPlaza De Toros De Murcia\n\nAlan\n\nJuly 12th 2023\n\nMick and the band sounded awesome since we last saw them in Amsterdam in 2017. The venue could use some much better air conditioning systems, though. Felt really sorry for those guys having to sweat through their set, but they never complained.\n\nKiel, Germany@\n\nSparkassen-Arena Kiel\n\nPascale\n\nJune 24th 2023\n\nSuper concert dans un amphithéâtre clairement overbooké. Ambiance de folie. Petit homage á Tina vers la fin. Tout était parfait !\n\nLyon, France@\n\nTheatres Romains De Fourviere\n\nJoni\n\nJune 23rd 2023\n\nMy very first solo concert attendance! After 20+ years, it was worth the wait, and about damn time! I was literally wondering - just last year - how long has it been since their last visit (almost 17 years!), when this fell right into my lap! All those bygone years of hearing \"If You Don't Know Me By Now\" mere moments after walking into a favorite bar of mine, time and time again, turned out to be foreshadowing this! While, in hindsight, I thought those were nothing but creepy coincidences. Even if I tried as hard as I possibly could, describing the feeling - of finally being at a concert by oneself - would be impossible. I was so moved, I even did something I otherwise tend not to do when with someone: stood up and danced (more like grooved), and sang alogn the songs I knew by heart...or just happened to have recognized. The latter was done rather quietly, as I believe my voice has weakened since childhood, or so I'm told. Sometime near the end, in the middle of a song (by Ike & Tina Turner I think it was) no less, the sound suddenly cut out! Even poor Mick was confused, who - while waiting for it to be restored - jokingly looked at his \"invisible watch\" a couple of times; you can't beat a classic. The longer we waited, the more impatient we've becoem; thankfully, we didn't have to wait for all that long. Given that it was around 10PM at that point, I guess he decided to wrap it up, and did so with a perfect song! One which seemingly followed me everywhere I went: \"If You Don't Know Me By Now\"! Some two guys, that were next to me, complained about the show being over so soon. The guy just turned 63 (about two weeks prior), give him a break! Speaking of age, and in my opinion, he still looks - and sounds - the same! But boy, does he love to dance... I'm just sad that my mom, a self-proclaimed biggest fan of theirs, decided not to attend due to ticket prices...\n\nPula, Croatia@\n\nPula Arena\n\nDecember 10th 2022\n\nSimply Red was outstanding. Too bad those concerts start too late to take the train to he venue.\n\nWilrijk, Belgium@\n\nSportpaleis\n\nP-JAYCE\n\nNovember 14th 2022\n\nWar der Wahnsinn, absolut toll. Super Sound und mega Stimmung, nächstes Mal gerne wieder 🫶🏼\n\nHamburg, Germany@\n\nBarclays Arena\n\nJofred\n\nNovember 8th 2022\n\nMagnifique ! super ambiance, super chanteur et musiciens sympathique et haut niveau ! merciiii Frédérique\n\nParis, France@\n\nZénith de Paris\n\nKirita\n\nNovember 7th 2022\n\nC’était fabuleux, je ne l’avais jamais vu en concert ! J’ai juste adoré ! 😍😍😍\n\nParis, France@\n\nZénith de Paris\n\nJan\n\nAugust 31st 2022\n\nVocally this guy is amazing, and always engages with the audience. Love his music, and great show. We had seats, as can't stand for too long these days. It was very well organised! The only downside was the price of food and drinks as usual at this type of event.\n\nTaunton, United Kingdom@\n\nVivary Park\n\nBrian\n\nAugust 22nd 2022\n\nThey didn't play as long as I thought they would play Miss 20 to 25 minutes Only played 1 hour and 23 minutes Think that's not enough But they made a wonderful concert, and he still sings like a god The placed to get food and beer/drinks was a mess, they only get 1 star for that If you wanted something to eat 1 1/2 hours waiting time and only one place to pay Not the same for something to drink, but also long time waiting\n\nHolstebro, Denmark@\n\nMusikteatret Holstebro\n\nKarin\n\nAugust 17th 2022\n\nAmazing! I have loved Simply Red since I was a kid and it felt unreal to listen to my favorite songs. Mick was amazing and the band was on fire. Loved every minute\n\nStockholm, Sweden@\n\nSkansen\n\nSuperloopy101\n\nAugust 8th 2022\n\nReally great fun. Played all the hits. Good sound. Decent venue. Mick's voice is still top notch. (Only negative was that the entry was carnage - not well organised at all.)\n\nColchester, United Kingdom@\n\nColchester Castle Park\n\nAlex\n\nMarch 3rd 2022\n\nWhat a voice! Mick Hucknall is high class performer and you couldn't find a fault with the band. Mica Paris was very poor but Simply Red were 5 out of 5.\n\nLondon, United Kingdom@\n\nThe O2\n\nJan\n\nFebruary 14th 2022\n\nHe was amazing as always. Voice hasn't changed one bit. Love that he engaged with his audience. He has such a back catalogue of hits, he could have done a couple of hours easily xx\n\nBirmingham, United Kingdom@\n\nResorts World Arena\n\nCarol\n\nFebruary 13th 2022\n\nAbsolutely brilliant. We had a great time, very emotionally at times but great to feel normal again. Thanks so much Mick and gang xx\n\nManchester, United Kingdom@\n\nAO Arena\n\nBryan\n\nFebruary 7th 2022\n\nGreat gig was worth every penny spent on it and geting there was full off the greatest hits music.\n\nManchester, United Kingdom@\n\nAO Arena\n\nKatja\n\nOctober 19th 2015\n\nIt was a great concert in Orange. We were very impressed and surprised - Micks voice haven't changed at all. We got to hear all the songs that we love from the 30 years of Simply Red. We hope to see Simply Red in Denmark again.\n\nOdense SØ, Denmark@\n\nSparekassen Fyn Arena\n\nView More Fan Reviews"
