        "text": "“Stars,” “Holding Back the Years,” “If You Don’t Know Me by Now”… Simply Red is a pop hit machine rooted in soul heritage. The band has been successful since the release of their first album Picture Book in 1985. Mick Hucknall’s four-octave voice quickly became as iconic on the airwaves as his famous red curls. With a thirteenth album in the works, his voice has not lost any of its superb quality. The band has been to Montreux seven times since 1986, and even released an EP recorded at the festival in 1992 that reached number 11 in the British charts. Of the four tracks on this mini-album, three were covers of jazz, soul and rhythm & blues classics. A musical heritage that Mick Hucknall and his bandmates have always claimed, in Montreux more than anywhere else."
