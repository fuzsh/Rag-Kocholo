        "text": "Simply Red is a British soul band that sold more than 50 million albums over a 25-year career. Their style draws influences from blue-eyed soul, new romantic, rock, and jazz. In 1985, Mick Hucknall and Elliot Rashman had assembled a band of local session musicians, and began to attract record company attention. Around this time, the group adopted the name Simply Red, after Hucknall's nickname, which denoted hair color.\n\nThey appear as part of Red Squadron in Blue Harvest with Hucknall providing his own voice during role call."
