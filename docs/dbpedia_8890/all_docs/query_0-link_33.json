        "text": "Simply Red is a British soul and pop band that has sold over 50 million albums worldwide and has had five number-one albums in the UK. The band is led by singer and songwriter Mick Hucknall, who is known for his distinctive voice and red hair. But how did Simply Red become one of the best-selling pop and soul groups of all time? Here is a brief overview of their history, achievements, influences, style, and albums.\n\nHistory\n\nSimply Red was formed in Manchester in 1985 by Mick Hucknall, who had previously been in a punk group called The Frantic Elevators. The band’s name was inspired by Hucknall’s hair colour and his love of Manchester United. The original line-up consisted of Hucknall on vocals, David Fryman on guitar, Tony Bowers on bass, Fritz McIntyre on keyboards, Tim Kellett on trumpet, and Chris Joyce on drums.\n\nThe band’s debut album, Picture Book, was released in 1985 and featured their first hit single “Money’s Too Tight (To Mention)”, a cover of a song by The Valentine Brothers. The album also included “Holding Back the Years”, a re-recorded version of a song that Hucknall had written with The Frantic Elevators. “Holding Back the Years” became a worldwide smash hit and reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 in 1986.\n\nThe band’s second album, Men and Women, was released in 1987 and featured more soulful and funky songs, such as “The Right Thing” and “Infidelity”. The album also marked the departure of Fryman and the arrival of new guitarist Sylvan Richardson. The band’s third album, A New Flame, was released in 1989 and featured their second US number one hit “If You Don’t Know Me by Now”, a cover of a song by Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes. The album also included “It’s Only Love” and “A New Flame”.\n\nThe band’s fourth album, Stars, was released in 1991 and became their most successful album to date. It sold over 10 million copies worldwide and was the best-selling album in the UK for two consecutive years. It featured original songs written by Hucknall, such as “Stars”, “Something Got Me Started”, “For Your Babies”, and “Thrill Me”. The album also showcased the band’s new line-up, which included Heitor T.P. on guitar, Shaun Ward on bass, Gota Yashiki on drums, Ian Kirkham on saxophone, and Tim Vine on keyboards.\n\nThe band’s fifth album, Life, was released in 1995 and continued their commercial success. It featured more upbeat and dance-oriented songs, such as “Fairground”, which became their first UK number one single. The album also included “Never Never Love”, “We’re in This Together”, and “So Beautiful”. The band’s sixth album, Blue, was released in 1998 and featured more experimental and diverse songs, such as “Say You Love Me”, “The Air That I Breathe”, “To Be Free”, and “Thank You”.\n\nThe band’s seventh album Love and the Russian Winter was released in 1999 and featured more pop-oriented songs, such as “Ain’t That a Lot of Love”, “Your Eyes”, “The Sky Is a Gypsy”, and “More Than a Dream”. The band’s eighth album, Home, was released in 2003 after a four-year hiatus. It featured more soulful and jazzy songs, such as “Sunrise”, “Fake”, “You Make Me Feel Brand New”, and “Home”. The band’s ninth album, Simplified, was released in 2005 and featured acoustic versions of some of their classic songs, such as “Holding Back the Years”, “Stars”, “For Your Babies”, and “Smile”.\n\nThe band’s tenth album, Stay, was released in 2007 and featured more contemporary songs, such as “So Not Over You”, “Stay”, “Oh! What a Girl!”, and “Good Times Have Done Me Wrong”. The band announced their disbandment in 2010 after a farewell tour. However, they reformed in 2015 for a 30th anniversary tour, which included 35 European dates and a new album called Big Love. The band’s eleventh album, Blue Eyed Soul, was released in 2019 and featured more soulful and funky songs, such as “Thinking of You”, “BadBootz”, “Sweet Child”, and “Tonight”. The band’s twelfth album, Time, was released in 2023 and featured more contemporary and acoustic songs, such as “Better With You”, “Earth in a Lonely Space”, “Time”, and “The Sky Is a Gypsy”.\n\nAchievements\n\nSimply Red have achieved remarkable success in their career, both commercially and critically.
