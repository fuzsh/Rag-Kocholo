We’re looking forward to marking this special milestone with you all in 2025 on our UK tour” says Mick Hucknall. “Fans can expect to hear all their favourite Simply Red tracks from 1985 to the present, and enjoy a memorable night celebrating the incredible journey that we've been on together over the past four decades.\"Few bands have enjoyed the success and longevity of Simply Red. With over 60 million albums sold worldwide, five UK #1 albums, 1.8 billion streams across streaming platforms worldwide, and over 1 million YouTube subscribers, Simply Red remain one of the UK’s most successful and well-loved bands. Their 1991 classic ‘Stars’ was the best-selling album for two years running in Britain and Europe, and all 13 of Simply Red’s studio albums, including their latest release ‘Time’, have been UK Top 10’s.\n\nMick Hucknall formed Simply Red in 1985 working-class Manchester, and enjoyed early success with first single ‘Money’s Too Tight To Mention’ and the Brit Award-nominated album ‘Picture Book’ (the first of 13 nominations, and 3 Brit Award wins). This was followed by a decade of superstardom and global hits. Today Simply Red continue to sell out tours across the globe. Their live show is renowned for its exceptional quality, with Mick Hucknall long-established as one of the great vocalists of contemporary music.\n\nTo celebrate this impressive 40-year milestone, Simply Red head back out on the road in 2025, telling the musical story of Simply Red so far – from ‘Picture Book’ to ‘Time’, and everything in between."
