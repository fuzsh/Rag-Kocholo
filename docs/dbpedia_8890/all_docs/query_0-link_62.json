        "text": "Simply Red are back! Four years since the triumphant Blue Eyed Soul, one of the UK’s most treasured bands return with a brand new studio album Time – out May 26th on Warner Music. A new song, “Shades 22” is released today – Watch the video HERE.\n\nOver 12 vivid, heartfelt, life-giving tracks that mix soul, funk, R&B and blues, Time demonstrates an unerring ear for, feel for and passion for songs that move the emotion and the imagination. Recorded in London with longstanding producer Andy Wright and the close-knit cadre of musicians with whom he’s formed a matchless touring band, Mick Hucknall is back – and not just with the label, Warner Music, with whom he began Simply Red’s musical adventure. He’s writing from, and about, himself.\n\n“When we were in lockdown, I went, well, jeez, who am I actually?” he remembers. “What makes me tick? And I realized: you are a songwriter. So why don’t you write some songs about who you are? That’s really the essence of this album.”\n\nWatch “Shades 22”\n\nWith a career spanning 12 studio albums as Simply Red (five of them UK Number Ones), two solo albums, back-to-back ASCAP Most Performed Song honors (1987 and 1988) for Holding Back The Years, consecutive Brit Awards (1992 and 1993) for Best British Group, a Brit for Best British Male (1993), the 1997 MOBO for Outstanding Achievement, two Ivor Novellos (1992 Songwriter of the Year; 2002 Outstanding Song Collection), and some 60 million album sales, Mick is ready to continue the ride into the next chapter.\n\nPreviously released single “Better With You” Here\n\nTime is full of golden moments from a golden talent. Come for the poppy confessional and stay for the honest accounts of where Mick Hucknall finds himself: a happily married father, as an ever-inspired singer and songwriter.\n\n“Music is one of those wonderful communicators. Each and every person can have an interpretation of a song that can mean something to them. To be able to create something that is then shared with millions of people all over the world – what a joy. How can anything be more rewarding and fulfilling than that?”\n\nTime Track Listing\n\nBetter With You\n\nJust Like You\n\nLet Your Hair Down\n\nShades 22\n\nIt Wouldn’t Be Me\n\nNever Be Gone\n\nToo Long At The Fair\n\nSlapbang\n\nHey Mister\n\nJust Like You (Pt. 2)\n\nButterflies\n\nEarth In A Lonely Space\n\nLive, after a stellar 2022 which saw the band perform 73 shows to over 600,000 people across Europe, the band show no sign of slowing down and will play a host of European Summer shows this year 2023. With more to be announced, the 28 dates will see Simply Red take on summer venues across Europe, performing all of their Greatest Hits and confirming their reputation as one of the great live acts of today."
