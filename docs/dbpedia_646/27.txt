Haymarket SAC has announced the appointment of Amrit Rai as its group publisher.

Rai's professional journey includes 25 years in the media industry and half a decade in the non-profit sector.

In the media business, her two previous engagements were as the publisher of ELLE India and as the business head of Bloomberg Television India.

"I have known Amrit for over 25 years when we worked together at the Business India Group and I am delighted to have her on board to spearhead Haymarket SAC’s next phase of growth. Amrit is a bold, ambitious and driven leader who is never satisfied with the status quo. She is ready to drive the change that is needed in today’s disruptive media world,” said Hormazd Sorabjee, managing director, Haymarket SAC.

Prior to joining Haymarket SAC, Rai has led business development for PYXERA global in India where her main responsibility was to build the corporate pro bono social engagement programmes and accelerate social change, through private, social and public partnerships. She is also a member of the CII India@75 taskforce, an initiative to push the agenda of volunteering in India. It was a vision document developed by CK Prahlad.

On weekends, Rai works as an honorary trustee of the Salaam Baalak Trust Mumbai - a day and night shelter that helps the street children of India. She is also a visiting faculty member in the post graduate diploma course in CSR at Nirmala Niketan, Mumbai.
