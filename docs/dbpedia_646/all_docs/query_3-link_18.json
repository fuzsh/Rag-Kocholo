        "text": "The Khande batte De Pahul is not a Man made maryada....it was introduced by GURU GOBIND SINGH JI at Vasakhi 1699.\n\n1. This Pahul ceremony is so IMPORTANT that even the GURU is not exempted. GURU GOBIND RAI JI took this Pahul and became GURU GOBIND SINGH JI....and was called Waho Waho gobind Singh Aapeh GUR...aapeh GUR-CHELA.\n\n2. WHAT a person \"thinks\" has got nothing to do with maryada/pahul/gurbani etc.\n\nIF we blame the Pahul Ceremony for some \"amrtidharees\" thinking they are better than others... What is there to stop a \"Gurbani reading person\" from thinking he is way better than you or me ?? SO shall we all then STOP reading GURBANI ??\n\n3. This \"propoganda\" AGAINST the Khande Batte De pahul/Amrtidharees is spread by the people who DONT WANT the restrictions of...KESH/KANGHA/KIRPAAN/KACHERRA/KARRA. So they calim they are Sikhs of the NINE GURUS, and want to pay attention to GURBANI only. This is a FALSE ASSUMPTION becasue GURBANI from GURU NANAK JI sahib onwards contains ample evidence of the FIVE K's as IMPORTANT fro Gurmatt and Sikhee.\n\nGuur nanak ji decared..Je to prem khelan ka chao sir dhar tali gali mere aou... and GURU GOBIND SINGH JI at vasakhi 1699 DEMONSTRATED just THAT by asking for FIVE HEADS on a Platter. The TRUTH is that ALL TEN GURUS are the SAME JYOT....no one can be a Sikh of Guru nanak Ji IF he DISOWNS GURU GOBIND SINGH JI. That would be like saying ..\"I am my grandfathers grandson..BUT not MY Father's SON \"\n\nJarnail Singh\n\nGurfateh\n\nDas is intersted to know that where in Guru Granth Sahib Ji we are told to have 5Ks. Or say Turban.\n\nWell Sabat Surat Dastar Sira is something being told to Muslims Holymen that unbroken concentration should be speacl kind of turban on his head.\n\nIt is rather apparnt ly anti to his wearing turban.\n\nlikewise we have Khob Teri Pagri told sonewhere else in Adi Guru Granth sahib ji and Dwarka Nagri ben also told there.\n\nThere perhaps Akal is been told in all and Dwarak of Akal is universe.\n\nAnd Pagri is glory.\n\nKhintha Kal Kuari Kaya Juagt Dandan Parteet of Guru Granth Sahib ji tell that inside of making Bhes or Attire we need to concentrate more on spritual persuits.\n\nEven similar things are writtan in Dasham Granth even in Akal Ustat it is writtan that by 'mere' keeping hairs we may not get Akal.\n\nSo How do we get to know about Amrit Sanskar and are as per Guru Granth Sahib Ji are 5ks also rituals.\n\nIn fact it is trai Mudra of Kachchh Kes Kirpan which was perhaps even before the world Khalsa.\n\nBy the way word Khalsi or libration perhaps is used in Guru Granth Sahib Ji\n\nAnd we do not have term Wahi Guru Ji Ki Fateh\n\nin there.\n\nDue to so much saying on relying only on Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji only like we have Arya Samjis having Vedas only we see many of our young man cutting hairs and saying that holy Guru Granth Sahib Ji does not approve it.\n\nComing back to Turban,Khalsa,5ks and similar matters.\n\nVars of Bhai Gurdas 1st talk obout perhaps 6th Guru wearing Turban and Rattan singh Bhangu also talk of Tenth master removing caps and let turban replace it(Even at misl period Sukh Singh Miran Kotiya and Charhat Singh sukker chakiya wore Iron Helmet as battle gear) so Turban was a mark as transiton from cap wearing Saints(we have Seli(woven ) Topi(Cap) of one of our Guru in one of the Gurudwara.\n\nAs Khalsa was made after the Guru Granth Sahib Ji so needless to say that if we say as per logical anti miralce missioanier point of view then Guru Granth Sahib Ji can not tell future or Miracle(al though we have instance where both forecate and miralces are writtan in guru Granth sahib ji but are attributeed to Akal).\n\nTo Be continued..\n\nGurfateh\n\nThen it is simple that when we were to be made rulers we were given a dress code and new name.\n\nAnd power to fight for deprived.\n\nRaj Karega Khalsa is from Karni Nammah which is by First master but not in Guru Granth sahib Ji.\n\nKes were been told to be kept to Bhai Mardana but Das is not aware of source but First Master did keep sword which was found from Oriisa and kept at Takhat Patna Sahib.\n\nAmrit or Pahul is mentioed in Mangal Prakash and Bijai Mukt Sakhi 10 both are called Sau Sakhis.\n\nBhai Gurdas Second ie Kesar Singh s/0 Shaheed Baba Gurbax Singh Nihung of Damdami Taksal also talks about taking Pahul of Khanda or nector of sabre.\n\nRegarding trerm Khalsa it is in Sarbloh Granth.\n\nOnce only it is found in the last part of Dasham Granth where Tenth Guru Talks of Khalsa's seeing him in Lakhi Forest like Bufflos see Grazeer.\n\nIt is similar to Jesus being shepheard of followers.\n\nThen term Khalsa is used to describe Jagat Jot Jape Nis Basur.\n\nRembers the alive light(Akal) day and night.\n\nThere are Asphotak Kavyas ie poems which were loose or scattered and hap hazerdly perhaps compiled in last of Dasham Granth Sahib.\n\nLast of it is Sikhi Rahit in Farsi.\n\nIt tells of Five Ks and 3hs to be forbiddan ie Huqqa,Hazamat and Halal.\n\nAnd then applying Henna is like blackening of face.\n\nIf we go by Guru Granth sahib Ji then our making mere Sikhi form with 5ks is mere ritual or Admaber so is Amrit Sanskar.\n\nThat is OK for house holder who is concerned to himself and his family or say fellow Satsangis(Congragaton) and in fact Gurmat by Tenth master was to elminate the division by forms of Yogis,hindus or Muslims.\n\nBut that could have been obtained if all of them have same form which conceal racial or regiaonl variaton.\n\nSo when ruler and aggressive class who was ploticaly arising to change the system of opppression by world was to be made so term Purely a worshipper of God ie Khalsa was used with 5ks and Turban marking the figthing ruler.\n\nIn fact Das is yet tom see that where in Guru Granth sahib Ji taking Vak or serman of the day or other occaision is writtan or where does is it is writtan for Santookh or Praksah or chaur or PariKarma or Kirpan Bheta or even Matha Tekna to Guru Granth Sahib Ji.\n\nSo at the end Guru Granth Sahib Ji say that to reach the God we ned to have devotion and with cleverness of logic which itslef is illogical we can not have blessing of Guru.\n\nThat makes Gurmat unique as only Logic is Vedanta and Gurmat becomes higher to Vedant by Devotion of the God which is similarly described by Vedanta.\n\nGurmat is not Vedanta only due to devotion.\n\nAnd where we have devotion we have no questons.\n\nso like in military descipline we are told to carry out task withour questioning to bulit our leadership so leadeaders or Sirdars are made by uniform of self decipline which is 5ks and like in military it is here also does not ask for logic but motivation and spirit to follow.\n\nAnd Baptism is nothing but enlistment.\n\nSay we have instance of Rath or chariot in Guru Granth Sahib Ji that does not undermines the importance of Car at present so Khalsa was advance state of Sikhs at the times Gurus before Tenth Master.Wars of Sixth master were for self defence but Tenth Master did caried out advance and aggresive warfare like the War of Naduan or Seding Prince(SahibZada) to attack Hoshiyarpur.\n\nThere is hardly the name of Tenth Guru in Guru Granth Sahib ji so should we deem that we had no Tenth Guru? Off course not.\n\nAll Ten Gurus were the medium of guidance to hummanitiy by Akal in the form of word or Sabd.\n\nAnd as per Bani of Bahi Gurdas First Sikhs were Guru and Gurus were Sikh and we find the Bani of Bhatts,Baba Sunder Ji and Bhai Mardana Ji in Sri Gurgranth sahib ji and all were Ihlaam or Words of God sent to them.\n\nAnd we are not like Wahbis who could say that God can nver sent words after Holy Kuran if it is same for Guru Granth Sahib Ji then God Akal is not omnipotant which goes against the sprit of Gurmat where Akal is without any limitation.\n\nIn fact at prsent in the form of Khalsa Singhs it keeps on guiding us.\n\nExplantion of of Guru Granth Sahib Ji by Prof Sahib singh Ji ,who was a Khalsa is also deed of Akal.\n\nConcluded.\n\nGurfateh\n\nWell as per research done by Budhadal people Guru wrote a full book called Sarbloh Granth after leaving Anandpur Sahib.\n\nDas could not get mention of Amrit Sanskar but few intersting things.\n\nLike\n\nGuru had five beloved four were his sons and Fifth is the Khalsa.\n\nGuru Has Twelwe forms\n\nTen Gurus ,Guru Granth Sahib Ji andd Khalsa.\n\nKhalsa or Sikh even were having Triye Mudra of Kachchh Kes Kirpan.\n\nDas is yet to come accross Gurus own writing regarding Vaisakhi 1699.\n\nBut yes recorded messages by Guru in Mangal Prakash or Sau Sakhi by Baba Gurbax Singh Ji Ram Kaur(from Baba Budha family) does talk of nector of Sabre or Khande Da Pahul.\n\nWe need to rember that as per Sarbloh Granth Khalsa is not Tantric,Yogi etc.etc. but term of Khalsa is used in most of the writings of Guru(incluidng Lakhi Jungle episode) after he left Anandpur Sahib and there was very little time between the vaishaki 1699 and leaving Anandpur Sahib as only after breacking the caste(Sarboh Granth talks of Khalsa above or better than four Varnas or caste here) did Pahri hindu kings with instigation of Parmandand or Pamma Pandit called Mughuls to attack Guru.\n\nIt is possible that self writtan record by Guru could have been drwaned in Sirsa river and Guru did not wated time to write it again as all were awre of this revulutionary event.\n\nLike passing over of Seat from Eight Master to Ninth Master by calling Baba Bakaley was recorded by others and not Guru not For Ninth to Tenth so from Tenth to Eleventh(Khalsa) was recorderd by Eleventh ie Khalsa only."
