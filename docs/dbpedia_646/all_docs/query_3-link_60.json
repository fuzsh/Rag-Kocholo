        "text": "Khande Di Pahul not only embodies the primary objects of Sikh faith and the promises connected therewith, but also is itself a promise to lead a pure and pious life to unite with Almighty Lord. It is about inward cleansing of the conscience and seeking unity with Akaal Purkh Vaheguru. The word Pahul is a derivative from the substantive, Pahu- which is an agent which brightens, accelerates or sharpens the potentialities of a given object.\n\nAfter the initial Panj Pyaare Dhan Guru Gobind Singh Ji Maharaj made it clear that, where there are five Gursikhs, is where I am as well.\n\nAmrit is only given if the Panj Pyaarai give you aageya (blessing). You can be denied. You can be told you are not ready.\n\nThe mentality you should have going into an Amrit Sanchar, is that you’re asking Guru Sahib, that maharaj do kirpa on me, my head is yours, my life is yours, whatever you do, whatever you see fit, I accept. You have to wear the Panj Kakaars, Kes, Kashera, Kaada, Kanga, and Kirpaan. Your Kashera must be cotton, your Kaada and Kirpan must be iron, and your Kanga must be wooden.\n\nAmrit is made by reading the Panj Baniya (5 morning prayers) whilst mixing patasee (sugar cookies) with water, with a Khanda(double edged sword. Amrit is only made in sarbloh (iron) iron bowl, and an iron khanda\n\nIf Guru Sahib allows you to take Amrit. Amrit will be splashed 5 times, in your head, eyes, and then you are to drink the Amrit 5 times as well.\n\nOnce you are blessed with Amrit, the Panj Pyaare tell you your Rehit (daily discipline) and gift you Mool Manter and Gurmanter. And what you are allowed and not allowed to do. Keep the mentality that this life is longer yours, you have given your head to Guru Sahib."
