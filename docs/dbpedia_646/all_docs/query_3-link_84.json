        "text": "Gur Fateh!\n\nHari Ji thanks for your comments, again I concur, the amount of so-called Ramgharias out there who haven't clue about the origins of the Misl or about Jassa Singh Ramgharia is amazing at best.\n\nThey think of it as a jaat and what really bugs me is the insistence by these Ramgharias to dilute the truth about Jassa Singh, never is he ever referred to correctly as Akali Nihang...instead we see a whole series of misleading titles such as Maharaj Jassa Singh Ramgharia!!! Since when???\n\nJassa Singh Ahluwalia was the Sultan-e-quam, sure Jassa Singh Ramgharia at the height of his life had vast amounts of land, wealth and armed forces (hence the need for 3 misls to get together and turn against him...rather like what happens today in Gurudawara politics and then people complain why do we have Ramgharia Gurudawaras or Ravidasia Gurudawaras!).\n\nNonetheless, Jassa Singh Ramgharia, may have been the leader in his realms (Sardar, Sardar Bahadur even), but I have not seen any reference to him as Maharaja dated earlier than the last 50 years!!!\n\nMoreover, today's so called Ramgharia councils are far cry from the calibre that existed of similar insitutions say 50 years ago in East Africa or even India...today, all we see are glaring attempts to be more sterilised and this shows through nonsense comments such as Jassa Singh Ramgharia believed and promoted Democracy (since when can an army commander run his army or even a battlion on the basis of democracy???).\n\nThe pictures we see of Jassa Singh Ramgharia, again are so misleading, being an Akali Nihang Singh, would he have really worn a turban more akin to Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala?\n\nI express the foregoing as my personal opinions only and welcome any feedback or corrections that anyone may have to offer...\n\nFinally g_singh, I agree discrimination for religious purposes on the basis of caste is counter to Sikh principles, however I would care to point out that is not what is being done here...we are discussing lineage, history and in this instance that of the Ramgharia Misl, Tarna Dal Nihangs.\n\nAlso remember, the Gurus themselves being Khatris only married Khatris and in fact counter to the modern day arguments of dropping family surnames totally, it should be noted that these were used by Gurdev Pita Guru Gobind Singh himself:-\n\n\"Asi khalari Gobind Singh...Sodhi Rai!\"\n\nAs per finding info on Jassa Singh Ramgharia, let me say the majority of English language writings on him are pretty poor. Sunder Singh Ramgharia's essay on the matter is worth reading though.\n\nForgive any errors on my part,\n\nNiranjana"
