        "text": "Amrit Rai\n\nThe Line Paintings\n\nMy art used to be about my inner life but thankfully some things get simpler with age. As that inner life has grown more spacious – The spill-over of it into my art has become more refined. It is enough now to become fascinated with line, color and placement, and any meaning made comes from those elements relating to each other in a shared space.\n\nStill, art being a mirror does reflect my inner life even if not by volition. The truth is that what wants to be expressed has very little to do with subjective narrative and everything to do with emptiness and space.\n\nColor, line and occasionally pattern assert themselves out of a listening for what and where they want to emerge. One might suppose that the line paintings are decorative, but decoration is never at the forefront of my motivation or process. The lines are both subject and object to me. They come from the desire to reduce rather than make meaning. They are born from nature and instinct, the way a flower emerges out of the ground from a seed lying deep below it.\n\nPainting now is closer to how it was for me as a child. I am propelled by the act itself and my disappearance in it— sensing, seeing, placing, and emptiness.\n\nAmrit Rai\n\nClick here to return to images\n\nExhibitions & Collections\n\nEXHIBITION HISTORY\n\n2011 Amrit Rai, Hillside Gardens, Mill Valley, CA\n\n1999 Formless, Freddie Fong Contemporary Art, San Francisco, CA\n\n1997 Recent paintings, Freddie Fong Contemporary Art, San Francisco, CA\n\nSpirituality in Art, Freddie Fong Contemporary Art, San Francisco, CA\n\n1993 Artists Images of AIDS, College of Marin Fine Arts Gallery, Kentfield, CA\n\n1992 Solo Exhibition, Barclay Simpson Fine Arts, Lafayette, CA\n\nBarclay Simpson Fine Arts group show, Barclay Simpson Fine Arts, Lafayette, CA\n\n1991 10th Anniversary Show, Barclay Simpson Fine Arts, Lafayette, CA\n\n1990 Amrit Rai, Janus Galley, Santé Fe, NM\n\nLA/90, International Contemporary Art Fair, Los Angeles, CA\n\nExhibited by Barclay Simpson Fine Arts.\n\n1989 Art London 89, International Art Fair, London, England\n\nBarclay Simpson Fine Arts, Lafayette, CA\n\nCOLLECTIONS ( Selected)\n\nHans Schoepflin, Basel, Switzerland\n\nArcher McComas & Lageson, Walnut Creek, CA\n\nSharon & Barclay Simpson, Orinda, CA\n\nVicky Tong, London, England\n\nCho J.K., London, England\n\nGil & Ann Berkeley, Lafayette, CA\n\nSusan & Al Spore, Moraga, CA\n\nFreddie Fong, San Francisco, CA\n\nPatricia Chacon, London, England\n\nNamita Gill, Victoria, Australia\n\nRandi & Jonathan Gray, San Francisco, CA\n\nCOMMISSIONS\n\n2012 Hillside Gardens Cottage, 3 paintings\n\n2011 Schoepflin Stiftung, Loerrach, Germany.
