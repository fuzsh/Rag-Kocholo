        "text": "Note:-\n\nThrough Amrit, the novice is born again, but this time on a spiritual level instead of physical level.\n\nWherever the word baptism ceremony is used, it means Amrit initiation ceremony.\n\nGuru and Disciple in one\n\nAfter this ceremony of initiation of Amrit, the Guru kneeled down before the five Beloveds and begged of them to initiate him into the new order of Khalsa. The Amrit was thus prepared by the Panj Pyaras and after initiation, Gobind Rai became Guru Gobind Singh. He became a Guru and disciple in one at the same time. Bhai Gurdas writes about Amrit Chhakna,\n\n“Take Amrit prepared with double edged sword, so that your life may become blessed.\n\nThe Khalsa adores the company of holy men, while the bystander is miserable.\n\nHail ! hail ! Guru Gobind Singh who is both Guru and disciple.”\n\nਪੀਵਹੁ ਪਾਹੁਲ ਖੰਡੇ ਧਾਰ, ਹੁਇ ਜਨਮ ਸੁਹੇਲਾ ॥\n\nਗੁਰ ਸੰਗਤਿ ਕੀਨੀ ਖਾਲਸਾ, ਮਨਮੁਖੀ ਦੁਹੇਲਾ ॥\n\nਵਾਹ ਵਾਹ ਗੋਬਿੰਦ ਸਿੰਘ, ਆਪੇ ਗੁਰ ਚੇਲਾ ॥\n\n(ਭਾਈ ਗੁਰਦਾਸ ਵਾਰ ੪੧)\n\nThe concept of Guru Chela was prevalent throughout the Guru period. Guru Nanak bowed before Guru Angad Dev Ji while anointing him as the second Guru. In fact, it is not bowing before the physical body but it is bowing before the glow of Divine Light.\n\nThis transformed the nation of pacifists into Sant Sipahis (Saint soldiers) and armed the Sikh nation to make the supreme sacrifices for upholding liberty, equality and fraternity. It changed the psychology of the Sikh mind. Amrit laid emphasis on the refined inner life through spirituo-ethical living and Five Kakars (Bana) gave Sikhs the ethical, social and temporal thinking from outside. The Panj Pyaras (Five Beloveds) were to prepare and administer the Amrit to the neophytes.\n\nGuru did not deviate from the spirit\n\nAll the nine Sikh Gurus from Guru Nanak Dev Ji to Guru Guru Tegh Bahadur Sahib Ji carried on the dipensing of Amrit upon their followers through Charan Pahul Amrit. The Gurus used to prepare baptismal water with the sanctifying touch of their lotus feet. Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Guru revealed Amrit in 1699 by authorising the five accomplished and authentic Sikhs to give Amrit through baptism. Guru Gobind Singh himself took Amrit from Panj Pyaras, the five elect and conferred Guruship upon Sri Guru Granth Sahib. The new initiation was in letter and spirit the same.\n\n“He changed the formal rites of preparation of Amrit from the initiation by the living Gurus personally to initiation by the Five Elect Khalsa. The basic principle of Amrit remained the same.”\n\n(The meaning of Sikh baptism -Amrit Ki Hai by Bhai Sahib Randhir Singh, p-34).\n\nAmrit Chhakna\n\nIt denotes drinking of nectar. It is another name of Sikh initiation (baptism). It is a ceremony of induction into Khalsa brotherhood. The Amrit is administered in presence of Sri Guru Granth Sahib. The candidates take full bath, wear five Kakars and present themselves before the Guru Granth Sahib for initiation of Amrit.\n\nFive Sikhs representing five beloveds who lead virtuous life and strictly observe the Sikh discipline are chosen to prepare and administer the Amrit. The candidates for baptism are apprised of the Amrit conditions for acceptance before the ceremony is started. They are apprised about the pure and virtuous life they must lead. When the candidates agree to live by the discipline and code of Sikh conduct, the Panj Pyaras start preparing the Amrit.\n\nA Sarb Loh (Iron-steel) cauldron (Bata or bowl) is filled with clean water. Some Patashas (sugar crystals / plums) are poured into the water. The Five Beloveds then sit in Vir Asan (sit on ground with left knee down and the right knee up) around the cauldron.\n\nThe mixture is stirred with two edged Khanda and Panj Pyaras recite path of five Banis (Japji Sahib, Jaap Sahib, Sawayae, Chaupai Sahib and Anand Sahib) from Sri Guru Granth Sahib and Dasam Granth with attention and full concentration on the Amrit preparation in Cauldron. The solution thus prepared is called Amrit (nectar of immortality).\n\nThe “Sarb Loh Bata” signifies the strength of heart and mind. The chanting of hymns create strong faith and cohesion in the devotees. The Khanda creates a spirit of valor and bravery. The Patashas create strength, courage and grace of sweetness. The Five beloveds create a spirit of unity and democracy. They are mirror of God and the devotees can see through them, their way of life. The evils of caste, color and creed are vanished. The mortal gets both Bani and Bana to attain Truth and be one with the Almighty God.\n\nFive handfuls of Amrit are given for drinking, five handfuls are sprinkled over the hair and another five are sprinkled into the eyes of each of the devotee who offer to be initiated.\n\nEach time the recipient says “Wahe Guru Ji Ka Khalsa, Wahe Guru Ji Ki Fateh”. The devotees chant “Wahe Guru” Mantar. (All such devotees are then asked to drink the Amrit from the same Bata (steel bowl) to shed previous caste, colour and creed. By eliminating the caste differences, a sense of oneness and equality is created in the neophytes who take rebirth in the new order of Khalsa brotherhood.) Prayer is offered at the start and end of Amrit ceremony and Hukam Nama (Divine order) is read from Sri Guru Granth Sahib. After completion of the ceremony, Karah Parsad is distributed. The Sikh now becomes Singh and Khalsa. He enters the corporate life of community called Panth.\n\nIt is to be taken into mind that Amrit Chhakna is not the end purpose. It is the start of journey on a right path to attain pure and pious life which is essential to attain God. It is not something external\n\n“Nanak there is but one Name Nectar. Any other Nectar there is not.\n\nNanak, the elixir of the Name is within and is attained by grace of God.”\n\nਨਾਨਕ ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤੁ ਏਕੁ ਹੈ ਦੂਜਾ ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤੁ ਨਾਹਿ ॥\n\nਨਾਨਕ ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤੁ ਮਨੈ ਮਾਹਿ ਪਾਈਐ ਗੁਰ ਪਰਸਾਦਿ ॥\n\n(1238)\n\n“The Shabad alone is the essence of the nectar, realizable through the Divine grace.”\n\nਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤੁ ਏਕੋ ਸਬਦੁ ਹੈ ਨਾਨਕ ਗੁਰਮੁਖਿ ਪਾਇਆ ॥\n\n(644)\n\nThe novice must have “lent period” during which he must prepare to go the way of Guru and a voluntary firm decision to change life style and must be desirous and willing to live by the values and virtues of Gurmat. Then and then only, the novice will become worthy to get the gift of Almighty Lord' grace and attain eternal unity.\n\nKhande Di Pahul not only embodies the primary objects of Sikh faith and the promises connected therewith, but also is itself a promise to lead a pure and pious life to unite with Almighty Lord. It is about inward cleansing of the conscience and seeking unity with Supreme Lord through His Grace.\n\nFive deliverances of the Guru for the neophytes from the day of Amrit initiation\n\nJanam Nash\n\nFreedom from previous family influences and caste effects.\n\nDharam Nash\n\nFreedom from previous religious practices and customs.\n\nKaram Nash\n\nFreedom from rituals, prejudices and past bad deeds.\n\nBharam Nash\n\nFreedom from duality and rituals prescribed by previous caste.\n\nSharam Nash\n\nFreedom from shyness and stigma of occupation and disappearance of previous hereditary professional distinctions.\n\nThe new entrants are called neophytes\n\nAccording to Dr Jasbir Singh Ahluwalia,\n\n“Looked from this angle the initiation ceremony of Khande-da-Amrit (whereby a Sikh is admitted into the order of the Khalsa) is of the nature of sacrament, and not ritual in the ordinary sense of term....... The testament of the Shabad and the sacrament of the Amrit are not two different ways; these are two aspects of one and the same thing; partaking of the Amrit is realizing the Shabad in a sacramental form.”\n\n(Sovereignty of the Sikh Doctrine by Jasbir Singh Ahluwalia, p.73-74 and 75)\n\nMere wearing of five Kakars is of no use if an Amritdhari Sikh does not lead an honest and pious life according to the teachings of ten Gurus and Sri Guru Granth Sahib.\n\nGuru Nanak Dev says,\n\n“When a Hindu comes in the house of a Hindu, he recites Mantras and puts the cotton thread around the neck of the incoming Hindu. Though he puts the sacred thread around his neck, he commits evil actions. His ablutions and washings for purification are of no avail.”\n\nਹਿੰਦੂ ਕੈ ਘਰਿ ਹਿੰਦੂ ਆਵੈ ॥\n\nਸੂਤੁ ਜਨੇਊ ਪੜਿ ਗਲਿ ਪਾਵੈ ॥\n\nਸੂਤੁ ਪਾਇ ਕਰੇ ਬੁਰਿਆਈ ॥\n\nਨਾਤਾ ਧੋਤਾ ਥਾਇ ਨ ਪਾਈ ॥\n\n(951)\n\nSimply, getting initiation without practicing the proper way of life, is of no use. Every neophyte is required to follow the set principles and Sikh concepts laid by the Gurus. Mere keeping of outer look will amount to show ritualistic tendencies and nothing else. The novice must be clean both from inside and outside.\n\nGuru Arjan Dev says,\n\n“When there is no love with God’s Name, then, these rituals are sinful.”\n\nਪ੍ਰੀਤਿ ਨਹੀ ਜਉ ਨਾਮ ਸਿਉ ਤਉ ਏਊ ਕਰਮ ਬਿਕਾਰ ॥\n\n(252)\n\nAbout Bhekh\n\nGuru Arjan Dev says,\n\n“Small is man’s service and great is his demand. He does not obtain presence of God but says he has arrived there. He rivals those who are accepted by the beloved Lord. This is but stubbornness of the false fool. He ostensibly wears the religious garb, but does not practice Truth.”\n\nਸੇਵਾ ਥੋਰੀ ਮਾਗਨੁ ਬਹੁਤਾ ॥\n\nਮਹਲੁ ਨ ਪਾਵੈ ਕਹਤੋ ਪਹੁਤਾ ॥\n\nਜੋ ਪ੍ਰਿਅ ਮਾਨੇ ਤਿਨ ਕੀ ਰੀਸਾ ॥\n\nਕੂੜੇ ਮੂਰਖ ਕੀ ਹਾਠੀਸਾ ॥ ਰਹਾਉ ॥\n\nਭੇਖ ਦਿਖਾਵੈ ਸਚੁ ਨ ਕਮਾਵੈ ॥\n\n(738)\n\n* “Rehani rahe soi Sikh mera,\n\noh Sahib mein uss ka chera.”\n\nਰਹਣੀ ਰਹੈ ਸੋਈ ਸਿਖ ਮੇਰਾ ॥\n\nਵਹ ਠਾਕੁਰੁ ਮੈਂ aੇਸ ਕਾ ਚੇਰਾ ॥\n\n(Rehtnama Bhai Desa Singh)\n\n**\"Reht bina nah Sikh kahave, Reht bina dar chotan khave\".\n\nਰਹਤ ਬਿਨਾ ਨਹਿ ਸਿੰਘ ਕਹਾਵੈ ॥\n\nਰਹਤ ਬਿਨਾ ਦਰ ਚੋਟਾ ਖਾਵੈ ॥\n\n(Rehtnama Bhai Desa Singh)\n\nTaboos for the Sikhs\n\nNot to remove hair from any part of the body.\n\nNot to use Tobacco and intoxicants.\n\nNot to eat Kutha meat.\n\nNot to commit adultery.\n\nA Sikh is not to show disrespect and cut his hair which is God's endowment.\n\nUse of Alcohol, drug, intoxicants and tobacco is strictly prohibited in Sikhism. These addictions drive a person away from realities of life and give birth to mental, moral, social, legal, and physical deterioration.\n\nRitualism and sacrificing the animals for the purpose to eat their meat is a taboo. Eating of Kutha meat is not allowed as per Sikh Reht Maryada. Many of the Sikhs strongly believe that eating of meat is not allowed at all in Sikhism.\n\nAdultery is not allowed at all in Sikhism. A Sikh is never allowed to share bed with any other person except the duly married spouse. A Sikh is required not to be involved in pre-marital and extra-marital relationship including sexual promiscuity. Sexual fidelity in Sikhism is confined to one's marital spouse which develops moral personality. These taboos are the pitfalls in the personality development and spiritual attainment of a mortal.\n\nIs Amrit Chhakna essential for a Sikh ?\n\nEvery Sikh is under obligation and is required to enter into the order of Khalsa Brotherhood. This is a pledge to remain under control, authority and governess of the Ultimate Reality. Amritdhari has the honor of being a member of the Panth, a disciplined force of God. Bani and Bana, both are essential for a Sikh to attain the Truth but Bana alone is not the passport to attain God.\n\nA Sikh must live life according to terms of Sikhism. There is general understanding that novice must have “lent period” during which he must prepare to go the way of Guru and a voluntary firm decision to change life style and must be desirous and willing to live by the values and virtues of Gurmat . Then and then only, the novice will become worthy to get the gift of Almighty Lord' grace and attain eternal unity.\n\nSome people are of the view that initiation may be administered to a boy or girl when he or she reaches an intelligent age.\n\nAccording to Bhai Gurdas,\n\n“Whosoever gets initiation of the Guru and follows the Guru’s instructions is in fact a real Sikh.”\n\nਗੁਰ ਦੀਖਿਆ ਲੈ ਸਿਖ ਸਿਖ ਸਦਾਇਆ ॥\n\n(Bhai Gurdas Var 3.11)\n\nThe life may become successful and blessed, if you take Amrit of double edged sword\n\nਪੀਵਹੁ ਪਾਹੁਲ ਖੰਡੇ ਧਾਰ, ਹੁਇ ਜਨਮ ਸੁਹੇਲਾ ॥\n\n(Bhai Gurdas Var 41)\n\nWhether Amrit Chhakna is Ritualism ?\n\nOne who performs external gesture without inner committment to the ideas being expressed under philosophy of Amrit, is performing ritual. Without practice of the teachings in life and without cleaning inside and outside, such like initiation will be termed as ritualism.\n\nAmrit is not ritualism when novice promises and submits to the will of Gurmat, leads clean, pure and pious life according to concepts and philosophy of the Guru and emerges from the ordeal endowed with a totally different being from that which he possessed before his initiation.\n\nFor more reading,"
