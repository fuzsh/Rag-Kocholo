He is the son of Munshi Premchand, a pioneer of modern Urdu literature and of Hindi literature. A prolific writer, Rai made his literary debut with novel Beej in 1952 and went on to write an acclaimed biography of his father, Premchand, Kalam ka Sipahi (1970),[1] which later won him the Sahitya Akademi award for 1963.[2]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nRai co-edited Chitthi Patri (1962), a two-volume book on the letters of Premchand along with his biographer, Madan Gopal. In 1982, he donated a collection of his father's 236 letters to the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library (NMML) at Teen Murti House, Delhi.[3] His A House Divided is an influential account of how the shared Hindi/Hindavī linguistic tradition became differentiated into Modern Standard Hindi and Urdu.[citation needed]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nRai died in Allahabad, in August 1996 at the age of 75. He had suffered a paralytic stroke earlier in March.[2]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nRai, Amrit. Premchand: A Life. Harish Trivedi, translator.
