        "text": "The literature on South Asian kingship has typically explored the idioms in which kingship—a king’s assertion of his right to rule—was articulated, while assuming ready consent to such assertions of royal authority among a king’s subjects, vassals, peers, and overlords. This paper re-examines the nature and limits of South Asian kingship by investigating the modes in which Man Singh Kachhwaha, a prominent regional chief in the Mughal Empire, claimed royal status. I examine how target audiences—consisting of literati, peers, rivals, and the Mughal overlord—may have received an ambitious chief’s claims to kingly status in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. This essay reinterprets the abundant evidence from Man Singh’s reign to reveal the character of kingship in South Asia as much more circumscribed and contingent than has often been assumed, and as continually open to challenge and contestation.\n\nThis paper examines the description of Mirza Raja Jai Singh, a Mughal mansabdar and a Rajput raja through the Satsai, a text written by Biharilal who was attached to the Amber court. Even though Bihari received court patronage and adhered to the literary standards and dignity of the language befitting his position as a court poet, we find that he addresses concerns far wider in range than weaving love tropes in nakh-shikh poetry. The paper hopes to use several padas to give us an insight into Bihari’s concept of power and kingship. Bihari eulogizes his patron by making several interesting comparisons between Jai Singh and divine beings like Kamadev and Krishna. Jai Singh is projected as a complete ruler who is not only skilled in the art of war but a master in the art of seduction. But it is the description of Jai Singh vis-à-vis the Mughal emperor that makes Bihari’s poetry propitious for understanding Mughal-Rajput relations in the seventeenth century.\n\nIn 1589, Padmasāgara wrote the first Sanskrit account of the Mughal rise to power within a short poem titled Jagadgurukāvya (Poem on the Teacher of the World). The work primarily eulogizes the life of a Jain religious leader named Hīravijaya, but Padmasāgara devotes one-third of the text to detailing the military exploits of Humayun and Akbar. Moreover, Padmasāgara departs significantly from known Indo-Persian historiography and imagines a startlingly innovative storyline for the early days of the Mughal Empire. Through this substantial rewriting, he furthermore consistently depicts the coerced establishment of Mughal rule as engendering the flourishing of Indian cultural and religious traditions. In this article, I provide the first detailed account of Padmasāgara’s presentation of the battles of Humayun and Akbar to secure their claims over the subcontinent. I then seek to understand the motivations that fuelled this particular narrative by placing Jagadgurukāvya in the context of Gujarati relations with the Mughal court, Jain religious interests and historical sensibilities in early modern India. In his account of the early Mughal Empire, Padmasāgara crafts a political vision in which history is not constituted by a set of unchangeable facts but rather by a range of potential cultural implications that can be best realized through literature. His ambitious narrative about the recent past has important implications for how we understand early modern Sanskrit historiography and its relationship to Mughal power."
