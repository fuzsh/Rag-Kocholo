        "text": "Hundreds yesterday turned out to bid farewell to former Wolf’s Warriors softball Captain Amrit Rai who was cremated at Ruimzeight, West Coast Demerara. Rai passed away at the Georgetown Public Hospital Corporation\n\n(GPHC) while receiving treatment following an incident that took place on Saturday night last at Met-en-Meer Zorg, West Coast Demerara.\n\nFollowing a funeral service at his home, Rai’s body was taken to Zeeburg Cricket Club where he was a member for viewing before proceeding to the cremation site where members of the softball fraternity formed a bat arch before the final rights were performed.\n\nRai will go surely down in the record books as one of finest batsmen of his era and has led Wolf’s Warriors to several major titles including the “Guyana Softball Cup 4” in November 2014.\n\nRai who was regarded as one of the finest Captains in the sport, was a calm individual and always encouraged his players to strive for greater heights. His last major tournament was the inaugural Prime Minister Cup that was held in October where he represented SVC Allstars of New York. Kaieteur Sport extends condolences to his family."
