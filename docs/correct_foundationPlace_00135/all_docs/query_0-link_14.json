These are Green Beret Problems. Major General Gil Ferguson, Commanding General of 1st Special Forces Command, joined Fran Racioppi for a conversation on the culture of the Regiment, how the Special Forces Groups are preparing for regional conflicts with unknown enemies at unknown times, and how Green Berets are solidifying themselves as the go-to option in the deep sensor fight against our peer adversaries. General Ferguson also explains the SOF-Space-Cyber Triad, where he sees Special Forces in a decade, and what needs to stay the same as our units evolve. Episode 142 is live!

Who’s getting cut and the interpretation of the effect it will have on the Regiment has been a divisive issue; especially at a time when global tensions are heightened. Florida Congressman and Green Beret Michael Waltz is fighting to keep the force intact. From Normandy’s Mont Saint Michel drop zone, he joined Fran Racioppi fresh from his C-47 jump and in full WWII battle uniform to discuss the world order, China, NATO, immigration, the effects of reductions in Special Forces and what to expect over the next four months in a charged US election cycle.
