However, Apple has manufacturing facilities and assembly lines in other countries, such as:\n\nUnited States,\n\nIreland,\n\nBrazil.\n\nSome components used in Apple products are also sourced from other countries, such as:\n\nJapan,\n\nSouth Korea,\n\nTaiwan.\n\nThe most advanced processor chips are made there.\n\nA Closer Look at Apple products\n\nApple continues to innovate and stay ahead of the curve to keep its dominant position in the market with their products.\n\nSome of the products everyone knows:\n\niPhones: a line of fancy smartphones with great features that include the latest models, such as the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max.\n\niPads: a line of tablets, such as the iPad Pro, and older models.\n\nMacs: a line of personal computers that include desktop and laptop models, such as the Mac Pro and MacBook Air.\n\nApple Watches: a line of smartwatches that connect with iPhones and other Apple devices that can track fitness, display notifications, and make phone calls.\n\nAirPods: a line of wireless earbuds that can connect to iPhones and other devices.\n\nWhat’s cool is the company is constantly introducing new user-friendly products and updating them.\n\nIn the following, let’s see what is happening with Apple’s sales of iPads and Macs.\n\nApple iPad sales\n\nApple iPad sales were down slightly in 2022.\n\nAnyways, the iPad accounted for nearly 8% of the revenue.\n\nThis is Apple’s revenue generated from iPad sales from 2012 to 2022.\n\nFinding: iPads are still popular, but not that much.\n\nYou may have noticed iPads being used in businesses as point-of-sales systems and replacing paper copies. Maybe this is a new target market for Apple.\n\nAlso, iPads might be more appropriate for kids to keep them busy on streaming platforms, such as Netflix or with games, instead of iPhones.\n\nBut for us adults, it’s a smartphone era, right?\n\nApple Mac sales\n\nYear 1998 was the year when Apple Mac was introduced and launched.\n\nIt quickly become a bestseller with +800,00 units sold in the same year.\n\nOne of the most defining feature of Macs is their operating system – macOS, which gives them a recognizable distinction in the marketplace and is sought out by users, especially in the tech, media, and design world.\n\nLet’s look at how much revenue Apple has generated from Mac sales.\n\niPhones – all you need to know!\n\nApple iPhones have revolutionized how we see the telecommunications and overall technology industry.\n\nHere’s the timeline from the first iPhone released in 2007.\n\nHow many people use iPhones?\n\nMore than 1.8 billion people use Apple devices all around the globe, with over 1 billion of those being iPhones.\n\nHere are better-detailed stats:\n\nDemographics of iPhone users\n\nThe demographics of iPhone users are changing year by year.\n\nHere are some of the latest demographics:\n\nFemales make up 51% of iPhone users, while males make up the remaining 49%\n\nThe 16–34 age group has the highest usage of iPhones\n\n35% of iPhone users also own an Apple Watch\n\nThe average income of iPhone users in the US is 85,000 USD\n\nHow much of Apple’s revenue comes from iPhone?\n\nApple makes most of its revenue from iPhone sales.\n\nThe numbers show how iPhone sales revenue is exponentially growing.\n\niPhone users in US\n\niPhones are most popular in the US, which is most likely due to their success as a product and marketing, not just because Apple is also an American company.\n\nToday, there are more than 130 million iPhone users in the US.\n\nIn 10 years, the number of iPhone users in America has doubled.\n\nMarket share of smartphones in US\n\nApple is the most used smartphone brand in America.\n\nIn fact, the iPhone is also the most sold and desired phone in the US.\n\niPhone market share in Europe\n\nWhat about iPhone sales in Europe?\n\nIn Europe, Samsung holds the largest market share at 32.96%.\n\n27% of Europeans use iOS, which also means that 27% of devices are iPhones.\n\nFollowed by Apple at 30.96% and Huawei at 15.65%.\n\nEverything points to the fact that Apple is getting closer to Samsung.\n\nEven in Europe.\n\nNow let’s look at Apple’s services!\n\nApple offers a variety of services to its customers.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the services that Apple offers:\n\nApple Music: a subscription-based music streaming service that offers access to millions of songs and albums.\n\nApple TV+: a subscription-based streaming service that offers access to original television shows and movies.\n\niCloud: a cloud storage and data synchronization service that lets users store and access their documents, photos, and other data across all their devices.\n\nApple Card: a credit card that can be used for purchases and offers Apple users rewards and benefits.\n\nHere is Apple’s revenue generated from services by quarter:\n\nApple competitors\n\nWhy is Apple one of the top companies in the world?\n\nOf the top 20 technology companies in 2022 according to their brand value, Apple was ranked as the most valuable technology company worldwide with a brand value of 947.06 billion USD.\n\nThese are Apple’s top competitors:\n\nGoogle ranked second with a brand value of 766.78 billion USD, while Microsoft ranked third with a brand value of 611.46 billion USD.\n\nHere’s the list of the most valuable technology companies:\n\nApple car?\n\nDo you think Apple plans to manufacture an electric car similar to Tesla? Considering the significant Tesla sales success, everything is possible…\n\nMany believe that Apple has been secretly working on one for many years now.\n\nHere is a thought: What about if Apple buys Elon’s stake in Tesla?\n\nSince electric car sales keep increasing year by year, it’s more likely that Apple will launch its products without buying Tesla.\n\nThis way, Apple would be present in the innovative automotive industry.\n\nIt’s almost inevitable!\n\nNumber of Apple employees\n\nHow many people work at Apple?\n\nThe number of Apple’s full-time employees in 2022 was 164,000.\n\nApple employs more than 160,000 people worldwide, with a diverse workforce regardless of gender, skin color, or religion.
