        "text": "Steve Jobs' Garage\n\nApple Computer Manufacturing Plant from 1976-77\n\n2066 Crist Drive, Los Altos, California -- N 37o 20' x W122o 04'\n\nPerhaps the world's most famous garage\n\nThe first 50 Apple 1s were built in Jobs' parents' spare bedroom (at 11161 Crist Drive in Los Altos, the house number changed to 2066 when the land was annexed from the county to the city in late 1983). That consignment of Apple 1s were sold to Paul Jay Terrell's Byte Shop for $500 each. The partners had to take out loans in order to meet the Byte Shop order. Just a few months later Apple moved upscale  in to Jobs' parents' garage. - from http://www.macworld.co.uk\n\nSteve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, along with Ronald G. Wayne form the Apple Computer Company on April Fools Day, 1976\n\nAt 2066 Crist Drive, an ordinary ranch house\n\nwhere an extraordinary revolution took place\n\nSteve Jobs and Steve Wozniak\n\nstarted building Apples in a spare bedroom\n\nLater expanding to the garage\n\nMecca of many Mac fanatics\n\nOn January 3, 1977, Apple Computer is incorporated by Jobs, Woz, and their new partners and chairman, Mike Markkula. In addition to plotting its marketing strategy, Markkula invests $250,000 in the fledgling enterprise. Additional financing will come later from a group of venture capitalists that includes Venrock Associates, Arthur Rock and Co., and Capital Management Corp.\n\nApple moves from Jobs garage to a building on Stevens Creek Boulevard in Cupertino, California"
