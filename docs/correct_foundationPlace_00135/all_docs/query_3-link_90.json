        "text": "FoundationDB gives you the power of ACID transactions in a distributed database.\n\nGet StartedDownload FoundationDB\n\nMulti-model data store. FoundationDB is multi-model, meaning you can store many types of data in a single database. All data is safely stored, distributed, and replicated in the Key-Value Store component.\n\nEasily scalable and fault tolerant. FoundationDB is easy to install, grow, and manage. It has a distributed architecture that gracefully scales out, and handles faults while acting like a single ACID database.\n\nIndustry-leading performance. FoundationDB provides amazing performance on commodity hardware, allowing you to support very heavy loads at low cost.\n\nReady for production. FoundationDB has been running in production for years and been hardened with lessons learned. Backing FoundationDB up is an unmatched testing system based on a deterministic simulation engine.\n\nOpen source. We encourage your participation in our open source community! Join us in technical and user discussions on the community forums, and learn how to contribute."
