        "text": "Thousands of businesses and millions of people in more than 50 countries and regions are part of our supply chain, contributing their skills, talents, and efforts to help build, deliver, repair, and recycle our products.\n\nOur suppliers are required to meet the strict standards of the Apple Supplier Code of Conduct, no matter where they operate or what type of goods, services, or labor they provide to Apple.\n\nWe encourage everyone across our supply chain to share feedback. And we’re focused on ways to amplify their voices. We interview and survey hundreds of thousands of supplier employees, and provide hotlines so they can anonymously raise concerns directly to Apple. We use this feedback to support our suppliers in strengthening their operations and providing the best possible experience for their employees.\n\nWe investigate reported concerns quickly, with Apple experts typically arriving onsite within 24 to 48 hours. Apple has zero tolerance for retaliation, and any supplier found to have retaliated against an employee for raising a concern faces immediate consequences, up to and including termination of their business with Apple. We require our suppliers to promptly address any issues, and we regularly check on their progress until we confirm that all necessary actions have been taken.\n\nIf suppliers are unwilling or unable to correct any issues, they risk removal from our supply chain. Since 2009, we have removed 25 manufacturing supplier facilities and 231 smelters, refiners, and manufacturers of materials from our supply chain for failing to meet our standards.\n\nEveryone has the right to work in a safe and healthy environment where they’re treated with respect and dignity. We uphold these rights with every decision we make, including the suppliers we choose to work with, the materials we select for our products, and the processes and equipment we use to make them. We work closely with our suppliers to uphold the highest standards of labor and human rights everywhere our business reaches.\n\nOur standards apply globally, regardless of where people live or work or which job they do. We require our suppliers to educate their employees on their workplace rights, including how to share feedback if their rights aren’t being respected. With the help of experts, nonprofit organizations, government agencies, and workers themselves, we consistently strengthen our requirements and programs to make sure they continue to meet the needs of people across our supply chain.\n\nBefore a prospective supplier enters our supply chain, we assess their ability to meet our standards and identify areas for improvement. We hold suppliers accountable for our strict standards through regular, rigorous onsite assessments. Conducted by independent third-party auditors, these assessments look at every detail of a supplier’s operations through worker and management interviews, detailed site walkthroughs, and thorough reviews of documentation.\n\nSuppliers must fix any violation of our standards under the supervision of Apple experts and take steps to prevent the issues from happening again. Any suppliers that are unable or unwilling to improve their operations to meet our requirements risk removal from our supply chain.\n\nWe also support our suppliers’ continual learning and improvement by having Apple experts share knowledge, advise on best practices, and design learning plans customized to the needs of each site.\n\nApple has no tolerance for forced labor. Our policies that prevent forced labor apply globally, regardless of a person’s job, location, or how they were hired. We require that job recruitment processes be free and fair, prohibiting practices such as charging fees to secure a job — even where it’s allowed by law. We’ve partnered with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), a United Nations agency, to create easy-to-use tools that help suppliers recruit people ethically and with respect for their human rights.\n\nOur work to prevent forced labor extends throughout the employment journey, and we verify that suppliers are meeting our standards every time we engage with them, including during assessments.\n\nLearn more about our efforts to prevent forced labor (PDF)\n\nThrough the Apple Education Hub, people across our supply chain are able to access technical education and resources on topics such as personal development, leadership, computer science, coding, robotics, recycling, and advanced manufacturing. These programs enrich supplier employees’ workplace experiences and provide the skills needed to pursue opportunities in highly technical fields. For example, graduates of our Swift coding program have launched apps on the App Store, meeting the high bar required for publication.\n\nWe partner with leading experts such as the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning (CAEL) in the United States, Zhejiang University in China mainland, and St. John’s Medical College in India to ensure that our programs are innovative, meaningful, and connected to relevant opportunities in local job markets.\n\nEducation is a powerful equalizing force, and we are committed to providing opportunities for the people in our supply chain to learn and grow. In 2022, we announced a $50 million Supplier Employee Development Fund (SEDF) to further invest in people in our supply chain. Through the fund’s Apple Education Hub, we’re expanding access to educational opportunities for supplier employees and their surrounding communities.\n\nIn partnership with local academic institutions and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the Apple Education Hub helps supplier employees develop the skills necessary to pursue new opportunities in our supply chain, as well as better manage their health and well-being.\n\nWe’re committed to cultivating a supply chain where people can thrive — inside and outside work. This means providing the people in our supply chain with the tools needed to focus on their physical and mental health. Since 2017, millions of supplier employees have benefited from training on essential topics such as nutrition, reproductive health, early disease detection, and mental health. These programs are tailored to meet the needs of local supplier employee populations, equipping them with important knowledge and skills to take control of their own health, which they can then share with their communities to multiply the impact.\n\nAs we continue to drive innovation in our products, the machines used to build them must also advance. That’s why we’re always reviewing and strengthening our machine safety programs to help keep the people who operate manufacturing equipment safe on the job. We require suppliers to design safer equipment from the start and to conduct regular trainings on topics such as the use of safety devices, inspection basics, automation safety, and hazards associated with moving parts. We also require suppliers to regularly inspect equipment and safety procedures to confirm that machines remain in safe working condition and that the rules put in place to keep people safe are being enforced and followed. If we do find issues, we work with suppliers to correct them and prevent them from happening again.\n\nEveryone has the right to be safe at work, and we work hard to verify that the materials, machines, and processes used to make our products safeguard the health and safety of the people in our supply chain. We consistently update our industry-leading health and safety standards and confirm that our suppliers meet those standards through regular inspections. We also partner with our suppliers to build a workplace culture that puts health and safety at the forefront every day, including by offering training materials and providing ways for employees to speak up if they identify opportunities to improve safety practices.\n\nKeeping workers and customers safe is a top priority that guides the decisions we make about the materials we use in our products. We require our suppliers to follow our industry-leading chemical safety standards to make sure that employees, communities, and the environment are protected against chemical hazards. This includes working together to use safer materials in our products and manufacturing processes, such as in the cleaners used during product assembly. By collaborating with leading experts and nonprofit organizations, we’re accelerating the adoption of safer chemicals across the electronics industry, fostering safer working conditions for people far beyond our own supply chain.\n\nApple’s worldwide corporate operations have been carbon neutral since 2020, and we’ve set a goal to become carbon neutral across our entire supply chain, including the lifetime use of our products, by 2030.\n\nReaching our Apple 2030 goal means we first need to continue reducing the carbon emissions from our manufacturing processes. To make this happen, we’re designing our products to be less carbon-intensive, increasing our use of recycled and renewable materials, and transitioning our entire supply chain to 100 percent renewable energy. We’ll then use carbon removal to address the small amount of remaining emissions, starting with high-quality nature-based solutions, like those in Apple’s Restore Fund.\n\nWe’ve also called on our suppliers to decarbonize their Apple production by 2030, and we’re helping them get there through targeted programs and training that aim to improve their energy efficiency and identify sources of high-quality renewable energy.\n\nLearn more about Apple 2030\n\nThe global impacts of climate change are becoming more apparent by the day. Our approach to protecting the planet considers not only the environmental implications of every decision we make, but also the impact of those decisions on people, particularly those living and working in communities disproportionately affected by climate change. That’s why we consider our supply chain in the context of the local communities where our suppliers operate.\n\nLow-income and historically marginalized communities too often bear the brunt of the effects of climate change. As part of our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative (REJI), we created the Impact Accelerator for Black-, Latinx-, and Indigenous-owned businesses focused on environmental solutions. The Impact Accelerator is just one way we’re helping ensure that those most affected by environmental challenges are also helping design solutions that dismantle the systemic barriers to addressing them.\n\nWe’re dedicated to minimizing our resource use and waste as we build our products. We require our suppliers to avoid sending waste to landfills by implementing recycling and reuse programs and developing innovative materials and recycling strategies. Today, all established final assembly sites for major Apple products are Zero Waste Certified.\n\nWater is a critical resource shared by people and ecosystems around the world, and we’re working to protect it for future generations. Through our Clean Water Program, we’re helping suppliers reduce their water usage, promote water recycling, and prevent water pollution. Since the launch of this program in 2015, 20 of our suppliers’ facilities have achieved certification through the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS), the world’s leading water stewardship organization. Earning this certification requires suppliers to adopt industry-leading water conservation and stewardship practices while also engaging with their community to protect resources across their local water basin.\n\nOur goal is to one day build our products using only recycled and renewable materials and eliminate our reliance on mining. Each year, we move closer to that goal, with more components being made with 100 percent recycled or renewable materials. Effectively disassembling and recycling our products after their use is also a key part of our work to support a circular economy. These processes help recover valuable materials that can be used again, making the best use of limited resources and enabling us to design and build the next generation of devices to be even better for people and the planet. That’s why we help our suppliers efficiently and safely recycle our products, by providing Recycler Guides and conducting assessments to verify that they’re meeting our standards.\n\nWe maintain strict standards for the responsible sourcing of materials — whether primary or recycled. Since Apple doesn’t directly purchase or procure primary materials, we work closely with our suppliers to uphold these standards and work with partners to improve conditions in and around mining communities."
