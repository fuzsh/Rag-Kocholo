        "text": "Steve Jobs founded Apple in his garage with co-founders Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in Los Altos, California in 1976 as a computer technology company.\n\nThe company was launched on April Fools Day and went public in 1980, making Jobs (and many others) multi-millionaires. The Apple I, II and Macintosh computers completely revolutionized personal computing, and the Apple II became the first mass-marketed personal computer in the world.\n\nApple has grown exponentially since then, and currently has the largest market capitalization out of any company in the world, coming in at $2.8 trillion.\n\nBut Apple didn’t always use to be the well-oiled computer technology machine that it appears to be today. The company has had its share of leadership fumbles and was very close to shutting down at one point in the 1990s. Take a look at the village of executives who have led Apple throughout the company’s 46-year history.\n\nHow many CEOs has Apple had?\n\nSince the company was launched in 1977, Apple has had six different leaders leading as its CEO at different times. Although Jobs was a co-founder and an early employee, he didn’t serve as the chief executive at his own company until 1997, when he stepped in as an interim CEO.\n\nIn fact, Jobs was actually pushed out of the company entirely in 1985 after a power struggle occurred between him and Apple’s then-CEO, John Sculley.\n\nMichael Scott (1977-1981)\n\nNo, not that Michael Scott. The first CEO at Apple, Michael Scott started out as employee number seven, though even that fact has been disputed. He was recruited by Mike Markkula, Apple’s third employee and later CEO, to lead the company, as the other two co-founders (Jobs and Steve Wozniak) were seen as too inexperienced to be running a business.\n\nScott steered the early Apple team through a period of tremendous growth. The Apple II computer was released in June 1977 under his leadership, and led Scott to ban the use of typewriters in Apple’s offices.\n\nBut he also oversaw a challenging period for Apple, and was the CEO responsible for what Apple employees refer to as “Black Wednesday.” In early 1981, Scott fired more than half of the Apple II engineering team.\n\nHere is the timeline of the remaining five chief executives who each had a turn leading one of the most successful computer companies in the world.\n\nMike Markkula (1981-1983)\n\nMarkkula is often referred to as the “forgotten founder” of Apple. As its third employee, Markkula was also an early investor of Apple, investing $250,000 to get it off the ground. He brought much-needed corporate guidance to a founding team that had none. Markkula previously worked at Intel as a product marketing manager, and had managed to retire early after making a small fortune on his stock options.\n\nAs a CEO, Markkula helped market the first two Apple computers and continue to boost the company with credit and venture capital.\n\nMarkkula rejoined the company as chairman of the board from 1985 to 1997, leaving once a full board shakeup occured when Jobs assumed the role of CEO.\n\nSteve Jobs and John Sculley pose next to a Macintosh computer in 1984.

Over the next four years, Apple saw three different chief executives, and it resulted in cumulative losses of $1.7 billion for the company. Sculley was also the CEO that pushed Jobs out of Apple, after a power struggle over how Jobs ran the operational teams.\n\nA former CEO of PepsiCo, Sculley was brought into the top position at Apple to lend his marketing expertise and help the company sell more computers.\n\nWhile he oversaw quite a large chunk of time in Apple history, the reputation of his tenure at Apple never quite recovered. His product strategy ultimately led to high engineering, manufacturing and marketing costs, and this influx of products caused confusion in the market. Unfortunately for Sculley, Conde Nast’s Portfolio actually ranked him as the 14th worst CEO of all time.\n\nMichael Spindler (1993-1996)\n\nSpindler was brought in to replace Sculley after a particularly tumultuous chapter in Apple history.\n\nHe worked his way through the ranks at Apple over in Europe, until he led as President of its European operations. He replaced Scully as CEO in 1993. Spindler’s tenure at Apple was short-lived and ultimately not very successful. The failure of both the Newton and Copland operating systems were both credited to Spindler.\n\nHe did, however, lead discussions for a possible takeover between Apple, IBM, Sun and Philips before Gil Amelio came in to replace him three years later.\n\nGil Amelio (1996-1997)\n\nDespite already being on Apple’s board of directors, Gil Amelio took over as CEO in 1996 for a short year, the shortest CEO stint in Apple history.\n\nBefore Apple, Amelio was President of National Semiconductor, the same company that Apple’s first CEO Michael Scott had worked at before his tenure at Apple.\n\nUnder his guidance, Amelio helped turn over Apple’s low-quality products and introduced Mac OS 8. Amelio also bought Steve Jobs’ NeXT for $429 million.\n\nBut within a year, Apple’s stock plummeted to a 12-year low, and board members were getting increasingly dissatisfied after three consecutive unsuccessful CEO appointments.\n\nAs Mike Markkula recalls in his interview with the New York Times, “it became evident that the Board of Directors were so unhappy with Amelio’s leadership less than a year that they began discussing the need to find a successor.”\n\nThis proved to be a difficult crisis for Markkula, who, as he tells it, was planning on leaving before that point, making his resignation after Amelio was forced out tainted with disgrace.\n\nFormer Apple CEO Steve Jobs speaks during an Apple Special Event at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts January 27, 2010 in San Francisco, California.

He went on to start his own rival computer company called NeXT, and later purchased and served as the CEO of Pixar Animation Studios, overseeing the production of Toy Story. He returned to Apple in 1996 as an advisor and eventually became CEO and Chairman until his resignation in 2011.\n\nJobs was behind the invention of the iPod, and also helped create the new Mac OS X, the iMac, iTunes and the early version of the iPhone. He also had his hands on the product development of the iPad and engineered Apple’s sleek and company designs that it’s associated with today.\n\nHe stepped down in 2011, after a cancer diagnosis left him unable to fulfill the role.\n\nTim Cook filled in for Jobs as an interim CEO twice before officially taking over the role in 2011."
