The company has developed many widely successful products, like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\n\nApple continues to invest heavily in product innovation to upgrade its offerings and stay ahead of the competition. In 2024, it plans to launch a new virtual reality (VR) headset, the Apple Vision Pro. The new product could help drive more growth for the consumer technology product giant.\n\nIn addition to technology products, Apple has a growing services business (e.g., iCloud, AppleTV+, and Apple Music). The company's streaming platforms, cloud solutions, and other services generate recurring revenue, helping offset some of the variability of product sales.\n\nThe company's service offerings are growing faster than product revenue. And they deliver higher-margin revenue for Apple, making them an important profit growth driver for the company.\n\nCloud Computing\n\nCloud computing is a network of interconnected servers and data centers working together to deliver a service through the Internet.\n\nThe Apple ecosystem of products and services has created unparalleled customer loyalty. Apple fans often purchase the latest version of its iPhone as soon as it's available. They stay subscribed to its growing number of services, helping steadily increase revenue, earnings, and cash flow. The growth should enable Apple stock to continue its upward climb.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on buying shares of Apple and some factors to consider before investing in the technology stock.\n\nHow to buy\n\nHow to buy Apple stock\n\nYou can buy shares of Apple in any brokerage account. If you still need to open one, these are some of the best-rated brokers and trading platforms. If you haven't placed a trade before, here's our guide to six steps for buying stocks.\n\nHere's an example of how to buy Apple stock using the five-star-rated platform Fidelity, which makes it easy to buy stocks. Its website offers a video tutorial and a step-by-step guide. Here's a screenshot of how to place a stock trade with Fidelity:\n\nImage source: Fidelity.\n\nOn this page, you would fill out all the relevant information, including:\n\nThe number of shares you want to buy or the amount you want to invest to purchase fractional shares\n\nThe ticker symbol (AAPL for Apple)\n\nWhether you want to place a limit order or a market order. The Motley Fool recommends using a market order since it guarantees you buy shares immediately for the market price at that moment.\n\nMarket Order\n\nA market order is an order to buy or sell a stock or other asset at the market's current available price.\n\nOnce you complete the order page, click the \"Place Order\" button at the bottom and become an Apple shareholder.\n\nShould I invest?\n\nShould I invest in Apple?\n\nBefore investing in Apple, you need to determine whether the company's stock is a good one to buy. Here are some reasons why you might want to consider buying Apple stock:\n\nYou love Apple's products and want to invest in the company that makes them.\n\nYou believe Apple's shares can continue to outperform the S&P 500.\n\nYou understand how Apple makes money.\n\nYou think Apple can continue developing innovative products that increase its revenue, income, and free cash flow at healthy rates.\n\nYou believe Apple can continue growing its higher-margin services offerings at a strong pace.\n\nYou want to invest in a financially strong company.\n\nYou want to earn some dividend income and believe Apple can continue growing its payout.\n\nYou think Apple does a great job allocating its copious cash flows to increase shareholder value, including its preference for share repurchases.\n\nYou believe Apple's strategic investments in digital content, payment processing, cloud services, and advertising will accelerate growth.\n\nYou have faith that CEO Tim Cook can continue growing shareholder value.\n\nYou understand the risks of investing in Apple stock, including that it could lose value.\n\nYou think the upcoming 2024 release of Apple's new Apple Vision Pro will be a catalyst to drive the company's profits and stock price higher.\n\nImage source: Apple.\n\nOn the other hand, here are some factors to think about that might lead you to decide against buying Apple stock:\n\nYou're not a fan of Apple's products.\n\nYou're not sure Apple can outperform the market.\n\nYou think Apple's days of product innovation are in the rearview mirror.\n\nYou need a higher dividend yield than Apple currently offers.\n\nYou are a younger investor and want to invest in a company earlier in its growth cycle than Apple.\n\nYou're worried about the economy and think a recession could affect demand for Apple products.\n\nYou're concerned that a competitor could start eating into Apple's dominant share of the smartphone market.\n\nYou don't think Apple's upcoming VR headset will move the needle for the company's earnings or stock price.\n\nProfitability\n\nIs Apple profitable?\n\nIncome growth helps fuel stock price appreciation over the longer term. It's an ideal area for beginning investors to focus on before buying shares of any company.\n\nApple is an extremely profitable company. It recorded $89.5 billion in revenue and $22.9 billion in net income in the fourth quarter of its 2023 fiscal year. While revenue dipped by 1%, earnings per share grew by more than 10%. The company posted record iPhone revenue for the fourth quarter, while services revenue reached an all-time high. Apple's steadily rising profits have helped drive its stock price skyward over the years:\n\nImage source: YCharts.\n\nApple generates most of its revenue from selling products (78% in fiscal 2023). However, services are an important profit-growth driver.\n\nServices revenue is growing faster than product revenue (9.1% versus a 5.7% decline in fiscal 2023) and has a higher gross margin (70% versus 37%). It's growing into a meaningful profit contributor. Services supplied 36% of Apple's gross profit in fiscal 2023 on only 22% of its revenue.\n\nApple's income should continue to rise. The technology giant is investing heavily in developing innovative products (like the Apple Vision Pro) that its fans must have as soon as they become available. It also continues expanding its service offerings, providing the company with more recurring revenue.\n\nApple does an excellent job of converting revenue into cash flow. The technology titan generated $110.5 billion in cash from operating activities in fiscal 2023, giving it the funds to invest in growing its business and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases -- all while maintaining one of the strongest financial profiles in the world.\n\nDividends\n\nDoes Apple pay a dividend?\n\nApple has paid a dividend on its stock since reinstating the payout in 2012. The company started paying dividends in 1987 but suspended the payout in 1995. Since reinstating the shareholder payout a decade ago, Apple has increased its dividend every year. Apple paid $15 billion in dividends in fiscal 2023.\n\nIn addition to paying dividends, Apple repurchases a significant amount of its stock each year. Apple spent $77.6 billion on share repurchases in fiscal 2023. The repurchases reduced its outstanding shares by 3.1%.\n\nExchange-Traded Fund (ETF)\n\nAn exchange-traded fund, or ETF, allows investors to buy many stocks or bonds at once.\n\nETF options\n\nETFs with exposure to Apple\n\nInstead of actively buying Apple shares directly, you can passively invest in the technology company through a fund holding its shares.\n\nAs of late 2023, Apple was the biggest company in the world by market capitalization, at more than $3 trillion. Because of its huge market cap, it's a very widely held stock.\n\nApple is in several stock market indexes, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 Index. As a result, index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that benchmark their returns against those indexes hold Apple stock.\n\nAccording to ETF.com, 448 ETFs held 1.3 billion shares of Apple as of late 2023. The ETFs with the most shares were:\n\nData source: ETF.com.

As of late 2023, shares were around $200 each. The price point suggests Apple stock could have much higher to rise before the company considers another stock split.\n\nRelated investing topics\n\nHow to Invest in Microsoft Stock\n\nGet step-by-step guidance on investing in Microsoft stock and learn the ins and outs of this technology company.\n\nHow to Invest in Google Stock\n\nGet step-by-step guidance on investing in Google (aka Alphabet) stock and learn the ins and outs of this behemoth tech company.\n\nHow to Invest in SpaceX in July 2024\n\nLearn how to invest in Elon Musk's space exploration company.\n\nHow to Invest in OpenAI\n\nAll you need to know about how to invest in OpenAI, creator of ChatGPT.\n\nThe bottom line on investing in Apple stock\n\nApple is the world's largest company by market cap.
