SUN Bucks works just like CalFresh, but for the summer. Children who qualify for free or reduced-price school meals through a school meal application or an Alternative Income Form, or get CalFresh, CalWORKs, or Medi-Cal, are automatically enrolled. You don't need to do anything to sign up. SUN Bucks provides $40 per month for food for June, July, and August 2024 ($120 total). As of July 2024, more than 3.2 million SUN Bucks cards have been issued, with more than five million total cards expected to be distributed to families across California over the coming months. Over $162 million in food purchases have been made by families across the state. Access the news release (English, Spanish) and videos (English, Spanish). Learn more about SUN Bucks.\n\nTaking Steps to Better Serve Foster Youth\n\nCalifornia has made transformative changes to the way the State cares for children and youth in the foster care system. The Continuum of Care Reform (CCR) was founded upon the collective belief among stakeholders involved in California’s child welfare system that all children served by the foster care system need, deserve, and have an ability to be part of a loving family, and not to grow up in a congregate setting. When CCR implementation began in 2017, an interim foster care rate structure was created. However, statute requires a new payment structure by January 1, 2025. To this end, the Department recently unveiled a rate reform proposal, which was informed by feedback from current and former foster youth, county placing agencies, Tribes, and other interested parties.\n\nCalifornia is proposing to restructure rates so that they are based on the needs of each child, not placement type. By restructuring the system this way, California can help address historical racial inequities and help break the cycle of intergenerational poverty and trauma.\n\nRead a detailed summary of the proposal\n\nReport Highlights Success of Project Roomkey\n\nThe California Department of Social Services has announced the release of a report that highlights the success of Project Roomkey, the State’s groundbreaking program that provided non-congregate shelter options, such as hotels and motels, for people experiencing homelessness, to protect human life, and to minimize strain on the health care system during the pandemic. The Department also issued an issue brief (English, Spanish) and news release (English, Spanish) on Project Roomkey.\n\nBeware of EBT Theft and Scams\n\nCalifornia has been experiencing an increase in occurrence of Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) theft. In an effort to educate EBT cardholders and mitigate this activity, the California Department of Social Services is providing security tips for those who use EBT cards to receive food and cash assistance in the following linked video. If you think your benefits may have been stolen, you should immediately call the customer service telephone number on the back of your EBT card, (877) 328-9677, or contact your county social services agency.\n\nA new mobile app and web-based portal called ebtEDGE provides new features for EBT cardholders in California, allowing them to better protect their CalFresh and CalWORKs benefits. The free app is available for download in the Apple App store and Google Play store. Web-based access is available here.\n\nVIDEO: Watch Out for EBT Scams!\n\nVIDEO: Tenga Cuidado Con Las Estafas De Las Tarjetas EBT!!!\n\nCash Assistance Program for Immigrants (CAPI)\n\nYou may qualify for cash assistance if you are an immigrant living in California and are:\n\n65 years or older, or\n\nblind, or\n\ndisabled\n\nCAPI is a program that is based on meeting certain immigration, income, and resource requirements. Please visit the CAPI program website for more information and how to apply!\n\nAlert: Important Change to Public Charge Rule\n\nImmigrants and their loved ones across California can seek and accept medical care, food assistance, and public housing without fear or confusion about public charge consequences thanks to a public charge rule published by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which went into effect December 23, 2022. Under the final rule, participation in CalFresh, public housing, or Medi-Cal (except for long-term care), will not be considered as part of the public charge determination. Also, a reminder that medical testing, treatment, and preventive services for COVID-19, including vaccines, are not considered for public charge purposes. For additional information, please see the following:\n\nJoint statement from California health and human services leaders in response to the federal public charge changes.\n\nPublic Charge Guide for individuals and families with questions about the these changes in federal policy: (English) ( Español)\n\nIndividuals in California seeking assistance are encouraged to consult one of many state-funded organizations that provide legal services to immigrants. Here is a list of immigration services providers funded by CDSS.\n\nFree Access to State Parks and Beaches for CalWORKs Recipients\n\nRecipients of California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) benefits are eligible for free access to state parks and beaches through the Golden Bear Pass program.
