        "text": "I keep getting Bill Payment APPLE COM ONE / APPLE PARK WAY US CUPERTINO CAUS showing up on my bank statement; these purchases are for $19.00, and seem to repeat every 4-6 days. These do NOT show up in my Apple Wallet, but my debit card is being charged. Does anyone else have this issue, and does anyone know what can be done about it? I hate seeing Apple siphon off my money in my bank account when I don't subscribe to any Apple service.\n\n[Re-titled by Moderator]\n\nI had a charge on my bank statement of $74.19 yesterday saying the same thing but nothing in Apple purchases. Called Apple and made a report considering they said they couldn’t find anything under my account. I did discover Cupertino is where the main Apple office is located which is suspicious. Now I have to cancel my card and dispute the charges. Something is 🐟 with Apple….\n\nI keep getting bill payments from Apple.com showing up on my bank statements I would like to know why I getting billed for something I didn’t order it’s scam I like stop charging me and get my money back it’s two times at $3.99\n\nI have also been receiving these charges with no purchases. As big as this company is wouldn’t it be the right thing to do by looking into this problem and correcting it? If not there will be many growing angry customers . You should be more open to helping instead of just trying to politely sweep us under the mat. At least try to look like you give a ****!\n\nThis is primarily a user-to-user support forum; other Apple users like you. We don't have access to information about charges to your account. Apple has a support article about charges — see each of the steps in the following instructions. They include information on contacting Apple Support if the other steps don't help. See: If you see 'apple.com/bill' on your billing statement - Apple Support\n\nI’ve had this problem before and had to cancel my card, I called and gave all my email addresses and it’s still happening, what the he..? Apple has all this money and stilling from people that don’t have any.\n\nThat is the billing location for some purchases of apps, subscriptions, services and products. Apple bills from locations around the world. Are you in the US, if so please contact Apple Support at 1-800-MY-APPLE. If outside the US, please contact the nearest Official Apple Support,\n\nChoose your country or region - Official Apple Support\n\nI have a very similar problem all different amounts from some apple one Cupertino don't even know what that is had to get my card replaced twice six or seven weeks waiting for it each time with my money locked down because of waiting on a card and it then it just happens again after 2 or 3 days of getting my new card I don't know what to do no one will help me\n\nYes, contactless payments make up a significant percentage of transactions in US. The statistics below are from 2022, I believe. But the real question is how consistently do they use contactless payment methods? Several still don’t accept Apple Pay, Amazon and Home Depot to name a few.\n\n>>Approximately 51% of American adults are now using at least one form of contactless payment. This figure includes both mobile wallets and tap-and-go credit cards. In response to this trend, many merchants are upgrading their payment processing technology so that they can accept contactless payments.<<\n\nhttps://finicalholdings.com/us-contactless-payment-statistics/\n\nThank you , I too apologize. What lead me here was my search I did for one Apple Park way bill scam search I did. I found I wasn’t the only one having this problem. I read . I wasn’t ranting. When money is being sucked from your account every 2 days , you know something is wrong.\n\nThese charges are normal. They’ve been on my accounts for decades. In, fact Apple has published an entire support article on what you’re perceiving to be an issue.\n\nIf you see 'apple.com/bill' on your billing statement - Apple Support\n\n>>Apple.com/bill appears on your billing statement when you buy an app, music, movie, or other content from Apple. It also appears when a subscription renews and when a family member buys apps or content from Apple.<<\n\nIt sounds like your Apple ID Account password has been compromised. Please follow the path below,\n\niPhone > Settings app > [Your Name] at top of screen > Scroll down the list of devices and remove any devises that aren’t yours.\n\nIf you know all the devices and can account for their whereabouts please reset your Apple ID Password.\n\nChange your Apple ID password - Apple Support"
