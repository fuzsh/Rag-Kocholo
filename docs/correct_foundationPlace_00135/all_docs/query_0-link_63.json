        "text": "The Lily Lolo Stardust Illuminator is a 100% natural mineral powder that illuminates your face or body with a slightly iridescent touch. Minerals have the power to reflect light. Thanks to this powder, your complexion is radiant with beauty!\n\nApply your Lily Lolo Stardust Illuminator after your foundation on the top of the cheekbones, the bridge of the nose, the brow bone, the lips and on the body at the neckline and shoulders.\n\n100% natural mineral makeup. Without parabens.\n\nHow to use the Lily Lolo stardust illuminator :\n\nCan be used on the face to add a touch of sparkle and enhance your cheekbones or any prominent part of your face.\n\nCan be used as a \"lip repulper\" by being discreetly placed in the middle of the lower and outer lips, after application of your favorite gloss. Indeed, the iridescent reflects the light and your lips are refilled, plumped.\n\nCan be mixed with your body cream for an iridescent effect. Ideal for the shoulders, the back and the cleavage!\n\nFinally, can be placed on the brow bone to enlarge your eyes.\n\nUsage tips :\n\nPut some powder in the lid of the pot.\n\nAfter applying your foundation, place it on the face.\n\nThe illuminator plays on the areas of shadows and clarity of the face.\n\nIt has two properties: illuminate certain areas and refine parts of the face. The application differs according to the morphology of the face and what everyone wants to illuminate or camouflage.\n\nGenerally it is good to put on the most convex part of the forehead, the cheekbones, the wings of the nose and the top of the chin: this corresponds to the three anchoring points of the 3, which must be emphasized.\n\nThe passages between each key point of the face are brushed with the brush to provide clarity while contrasting with previously created shadows."
