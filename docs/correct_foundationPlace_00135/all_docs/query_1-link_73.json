        "text": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A judge has ordered computer-maker Apple Inc. to pay more than $506 million in a patent infringement case brought by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation after the two sides agreed on final damages.\n\nA jury in 2015 found Apple infringed on a patent held by the foundation, which supports research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nThe patent involves chip technology developed at the university. The technology was used in processors installed by Apple in a number of products.\n\nThe Wisconsin State Journal reports that last month, U.S. District Judge William Conley upheld a $234 million damage award made by the jury. He ordered the foundation and Apple to work on a final figure based on the number of units sold that contained the technology.\n\nCupertino, California-based Apple has appealed the jury's findings.\n\n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
