This modest 1950's California ranch-style home in a suburban Bay Area neighborhood carries a local historical designation. The single-story house on quiet Crist Drive in Los Altos is where a young Steve Jobs built the first Apple computers in the mid-1970s in his family's garage.

Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, along with Ronald G. Wayne, formed the Apple Computer Company on April Foolsâ€™ Day, 1976. Apple Headquarters moved from Jobs' garage to a building on Stevens Creek Boulevard in nearby Cupertino where the rest is history.
