In the bellringing community he is well-known (although some would say notorious) for the design of the Ellacombe Chiming Apparatus, still to be found in many Anglican churches and beyond, and also for the energetic gathering and publication of data on bell-towers and their contents in his region, as well as writings and lectures on bellringing matters, on which he was a leading authority at the time. His enthusiasm also spread to horticulture, the vicarage garden becoming a living laboratory.\n\nHenry Thomas Ellicombe, son of William Ellicombe and his wife, Hannah Rous, was born on 15 May 1790 and was baptised at Alphington in Devon on the 3rd of June.[1]\n\nHe entered Oriel College, Oxford, in 1808, graduating B.A. in 1812.[2]\n\nHenry initially pursued a career in engineering at Chatham Dockyard, under Marc Brunel (DNB) until 1816, when the Navy Board suddenly made him redundant, for obscure reasons. Marc Brunel returned from France and pleaded to have him re-instated, which might have briefly succeeded had not Henry already taken umbrage and decided to revert to the original family calling in the Church, obtaining the necessary M.A. at Oriel.[3]\n\nOn 3 April 1818 at St Margaret, Rochester in Kent he married Ann Nicholson,[4] daughter of William Nicholson and his wife, Isabella Maudsley. It was probably the birth of her youngest child that caused her death, for the baby was baptised on the same day that Ann was buried, 15 March. [5][6]\n\nHis service to the Church of England spanned a curacy at Cricklade, Wiltshire, then Bitton, Gloucestershire, until 1835 when he became vicar of Bitton, finally removing to Clyst St. George, Devon as its Rector in 1850, where he died in 1885.\n\nHis fertile mind was applied with vigour to antiquarian interests, botany and architecture. Most notably, his involvement with the art of English bellringing was long and varied, notably including the design and construction of an apparatus to replace bellringers (or at least those who did not adhere to his reforming edicts). It is thought that, while he may have learnt basic ringing at Alphington or at Oxford, he may not have actually rung changes until about 1867, by which time he had written extensively about bells and ringing. He is best regarded as an academic rather than practical campanologist.\n\nOne of his publications, Practical Remarks on Belfries and Ringers, was outspoken on the subject of 'belfry reform', a particular aspect of the church reform which had been championed by the Oxford Movement. He led the way in wresting control of the English bell-tower from the hands of townsfolk and influential gentry, and steering the main purpose of bellringing towards the service of the Church, rather than exercise, competition, and visits to the alehouse. An idea of a Bitton workman led his engineering mind to the design of the Ellacombe Chime, the first of which was installed at Bitton in 1822, apparently driven by the need for one man to sound the bells somehow whilst banning the regular ringers from ringing for church services that they did not attend.(The Bitton chime)\n\nHe was returned to Bitton for burial on 4th August 1885,[7] and is commemorated with his wives on a wall tablet inside the church[8].\n\nResearch Notes\n\nDNB[9] states he had six children from his first marriage, but so far we have discovered only four daughters and one son, with a further son and daughter from the second marriage.\n\nSources\n\n↑ Baptismal record Alphington Devon (3 June 1790 Henry Thomas Ellicombe born 15 May 1790, son of William Ellicombe and Hannah) Viewed at Ancestry.

This was set up in 1822. The method was suggested to me by Sam. Watts, a clever workman, and is supposed to be the first thing of the sort. Since that time the same contrivance has been set up in about two hundred towers. It is so arranged above as not to interfere with the gear for ringing. The lines being brought down to the floor, a child may easily call the people to the Services of the day. Before this the tenor bell only was tolled, which has a melancholy sound, instead of the sweet, mellow, and subdued tones which the bells cheerily throw out when they are chimed. The difficulty of getting a sufficient number of hands to do this daily, or it may be only on Sundays and Saints' days, with unbroken regularity for both services, is often found to be impracticable, especially in country places; and therefore, this simple contrivance is very valuable to all who consider chiming one of the most legitimate uses of bells. It is available for any number of bells, and lately it has been fixed at Worcester Cathedral for chiming the twelve bells for the daily Services. The chiming gear being distinct from the clappers, it does away with the lazy practice which is so common, but so destructive, of \"clocking\" the bells, or tying ropes to the clappers, by which so many fine bells have been cracked. The place for the manual should be the ground floor of the tower, which is also the proper place for the ropes to be brought down for the ringing.\"\n\nPublications by H T Ellacombe\n\nThe history of the parish of Bitton, in the county of Gloucester.
