        "text": "The twenty one year period, from the disastrous Flanders campaign (1793-5) to victory in the Peninsular War (1808-14), saw a complete reversal of fortunes for the British Army. Poor staff work was a major contributor to the failures of the 1790s, with a contemporary French observer, Dupin, noting that British officers on the Quartermaster-General’s (QMG) staff had been in ‘total ignorance’ of their duties at the time. Following the appointment of the Duke of York as Commander-in-Chief, the QMG function was subject to a series of a reforms. Such was their impact, the same observer stated that by the end of the Peninsular War this group had been transformed into ‘one of the finest bodies of staff officers in Europe’. This fact has all but been forgotten over time, with generations of historians giving Wellington the credit for the detailed management of his army to the exclusion of all others. This dissertation therefore asks the primary research question ‘What impact did the reform of the Quartermaster-General’s Department have on the performance of the British Army, 1795- 1814?’ It starts by exploring the problems that existed in the Quartermaster-General’s Department in the 1790s. It concludes there were three main issues: a lack of experienced, trained staff; a lack of knowledge of its operational surroundings; and an absence of pioneers and pontoniers to facilitate the smooth movement of the army. It then considers the reforms introduced by the Duke of York to address these shortcomings. There is an examination of how the QMG leadership was overhauled and populated with energetic senior officers following a reformist, scientific agenda. It looks at the background to the establishment of the Royal Military College and outlines its mission to train senior officers in specialist staff work and junior officers in the basics of military reconnaissance and sketching. The retention of skilled Royal Military College graduates during peacetime in ‘permanent assistant’ Quartermaster-General roles to provide a core of QMG officers in times of war is also discussed. It then looks at how a reformed Quartermaster-General HQ 2 became the centre for the acquisition, storage and dissemination of military knowledge. The foundation of the Depot of Military Knowledge is covered in detail. Finally it considers the creation and early evolution of the combat engineering unit, the Royal Staff Corps (RSC), consisting of skilled artificer soldiers commanded by highly trained officers with engineering skills. The impact of the Quartermaster-General reforms on the efficiency of the army is then considered in two scenarios - the Defence of Great Britain against French invasion (1803- 1805) and the Peninsular War (1808-1814). The central role the Quartermaster-General’s Department played in the Defence of Britain (1803-1805) and its coordination and preparation of comprehensive defence plans is examined. The importance of the Depot of Military Knowledge and its staff in centralising and collating regional memoranda and reconnaissance reports is reviewed. The activities of regional QMG staff, many of whom were Royal Military College trained, in developing plans and reconnoitring and mapping vulnerable coastlines, is outlined. The major role the Royal Staff Corps played in raising defences around Britain and Ireland is explained. The origin and construction of the formidable Royal Military Canal is considered, as is the Royal Staff Corps’ contribution to the many fieldworks in the threatened Southern, London and Eastern districts. New light is shone on considerable work undertaken in Ireland. It highlights that had Napoleon invaded in 1805, many of the defences he faced would have been built by the Royal Staff Corps. In answer to the research question it concludes that the Quartermaster- General’s Department had a significant impact on the performance of the army. The department’s role and impact on army operations in the Peninsular War is then considered. By analysing and cataloguing over 300 maps found in major UK archives, it proceeds to illustrate the department’s considerable efforts reconnoitring and mapping large swathes of Portugal and Spain. It identifies that the subsequent mastery the Quartermaster- General’s Department obtained of army mobility and manoeuvrability was as a result of the knowledge gained. It reviews the role played by the department in gathering (and sometimes decrypting) enemy intelligence. It concludes that the range of topographic and logistical military knowledge gathered combined with enemy intelligence had a direct impact on the tactical and strategic decisions made by Wellington. 3 It demonstrates the important role played by the Depot of Military Knowledge as a key driver of knowledge gathering activities and examines the two-way flow of knowledge between the Peninsula and London and the dissemination of knowledge within Britain. The widespread activities of the Royal Staff Corps are covered. In particular, an in depth study of its bridging activities is made and their tactical and strategic impact is assessed. In answer to the research question it concludes that in the unforgiving terrain of the Peninsula where mistakes cost time, opportunities, equipment and lives, the Quartermaster-General’s Department had a significant impact on the tactical and strategic performance of the army. It also reveals that both the Depot of Military Knowledge and the Royal Staff Corps played a more significant role than previously assumed by many historians."
