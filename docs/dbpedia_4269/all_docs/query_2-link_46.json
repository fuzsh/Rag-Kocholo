Amid all the discussion of balanced budgets, let us not forget the record. Expenditures for the fiscal year ended June 30, last, totaled $7,200,000,000 if the bonus costs are eliminated. Those now estimated by the President for the current fiscal year on the same basis total $7,900,000,000, an increase of (5) Despite his vague assurance before.

Nor is the \"challenge\" to business to employ a large number of men whether they are needed or not particularly reassuring on the point. Such in brief appears to be the situation and the outlook regarding the policies of President Roosevelt's second term. At least such is the prospect as that term is about to begin. It is a perfectly logical outcome of the President's first term in office and of the overwhelming approval which was given at the polls last November. Individual measure here and there may presently give occasion for surprise, or they may not, but events are demonstrating the folly of supposing that by endorsing previous policies or even by condoning them an effective basis could be laid for persuading the President to alter his course.
