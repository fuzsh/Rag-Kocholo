        "text": "STANTONSBURG — The house that Jack Sherrod built is a hidden history.\n\nBuilt as a wood structure in 1886, the entire building has been encapsulated into brick and has had multiple additions over the years, but Leonard Paul Sherrod Jr., great-grandson of the builder, knows what’s underneath.\n\nSherrod and other family members are preparing for a grand reunion on Sept. 1-3 to be held at the Sherrod homestead.\n\n“We are refurnishing, repairing, remodeling when necessary and getting it ready to be used as a venue for the upcoming September reunion,” said Sherrod, who was born in Wilson in 1933 and graduated from Charles H. Darden High School in 1952.\n\nA picnic and a banquet are planned at the event, which Sherrod has titled “Exploring Our Family History.”\n\n“There is so much history,” Sherrod said. “Not only is it family history, it is African-American history, and in some small portion, American history.”\n\nThat history begins with Jack Sherrod and his wife, Cassie. Both had been slaves, yet 20 years afterward had managed to build a home on what is now Watery Branch Church Road south of Stantonsburg near the confluence of Wilson, Greene and Wayne counties.\n\n“He had been a slave until the end of the war,” Sherrod said. “As a freed man, he acquired this land and built a home on it. He could not read, nor write, but he could build things. He had this God-given talent for building things. It is not written, but certainly said, that he built a lot of structures in this area. He was a builder. It took him two years to build this house.”\n\n…\n\nLast week, Sherrod stood in the graveyard behind Watery Branch Free Will Baptist Church. The graves of Jack and Cassie Sherrod are right there, with those of other deceased family members, about 200 yards away from and within sight of the homestead.\n\n“To be able to stand there in your yard and see where your great-grandparents are buried, that raises a lot of emotions within me,” Sherrod said. The house that he built and I can see his grave from the front yard.”\n\nRestoring the homestead is a passion for Sherrod.\n\n“I think the Lord put this in my spirit to be a part of preserving this property because it has been in the family for so long and it is such a rich history that I could not stand by and let it go,” he said.\n\nFrom “Hidden History: Family Celebrates Home of Patriarch, a Former Slave,” by Drew C.
