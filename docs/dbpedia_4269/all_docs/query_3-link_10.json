He was baptised at St Jude in South Kensington on 3 October 1887. [2]. He was educated at Clifton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he won the Chancellor's Medal for English Verse and was elected president of the Cambridge Union Society. In June 1910 he was offered a fellowship at two colleges simultaneously. He chose that at Corpus Christi College where he became college lecturer and director of studies in history. In 1912 he became librarian, taking charge of the college's collection of manuscripts and incunabula created by Matthew Parker at the dissolution of the monasteries. [3]\n\nHe claimed exemption from being drafted in WWI due to 'physical disability'. In the spring of 1915 he went to work at the Foreign Office, where he joined the news department. Here he had the advantage of knowing America, for in 1913 and 1914 he had been a visiting lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1916 he returned to lecture at the same university, and while there he married, Elizabeth Levering Jones (b. 1892), eldest daughter of Joseph Levering Jones, a corporate lawyer of Philadelphia. They had no children. In 1917 he returned to America as part of the foreign secretary Arthur Balfour's mission. He remained in New York until 1919 as director of the British bureau of information, a post in which he fostered Anglo-American relations and for which he was made KBE (1919). [4]\n\nHe returned to Cambridge in 1919, and was appointed praelector in diplomatic history at Corpus. He lectured on the history of international relations and the development of International Law. [5] As a scholar of International Relations, he was also politically active within Cambridge and successfully stood as the Conservative Party Member of Parliament for Cambridge University from 1923 to 1929. In 1925 he joined the Conservative ministry as parliamentary private secretary to Sir Samuel Hoare, the Secretary of State for Air. He was a member of a Home Office committee on legal aid and a prominent member of the 1927 Donoughmore commission, which investigated the constitution of Ceylon. [6]\n\nHe died of cancer of the liver and stomach on 2 May 1929 aged 41. [7] His death was registered in Marylebone. [8]. At that time he was living at 21 Bentinck St, Marylebone, London, England.\n\nHis publications include[9]:\n\n1913.
