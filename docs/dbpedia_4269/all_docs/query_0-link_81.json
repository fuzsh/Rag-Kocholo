It began, nearly eighteen years ago, when I first looked at the shorthand of Pepys's diary to see what it would yield for the history of pronunciation. During the years, with that obvious logic which is obvious only to the person involved, the interest has increased until, like the Man Who Came to Dinner, it sits in my mind like the owner. Where it will end, who knows ? Perhaps I shall begin to keep a diary myself. The logical sequence in the present case is that, having published three years ago a descriptive list called American Diaries, it was patent that I should go back to where I began and compile a similar list of British diaries. The flattering welcome that reviewers and buyers gave to the American list was a fatal encouragement, and when in 1946 the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation awarded me a fellowship, the die was cast. Before setting forth the methods used in assembling the material, and so explaining away my sins of commission and omission, I had better make my justification for compiling a bibliography devoted simply to diaries. The reviewers of the earlier list, being mostly historians, welcomed the material it provided for general historical studies. Out of my affection, I could say a word in season about this attitude, which reminds me of the outlook of industrialists who, seeing a mountain torrent, can only dream dreams of hydroelectric power plants. But I am enough of a historian and antiquary myself to admit that one obvious use for these diary lists is as guides for general historical and antiquarian studies; for studies of popular ideas, fashions, taste, manners. Since I got into diary reading through linguistics, it also behooves me to mention the unequaled value of diaries as records, comparatively uncontaminated by stylistic conventions and fashions, of the everyday language of the times in which they were written. The diaries are splendid raw material for social historians and historical HIS BOOK\n\nCvii]\n\nviii\n\nPreface\n\nlinguists, and I hope they will make fuller use of them by reason of this book than they have done hitherto. In a way, however, the book presents alternatives to social histories, for most of which I have little affection. In them, the fads, foibles, and fashions of former times are separately patterned out, too often like cold cuts in a butcher's window: in the diaries listed here, they occur as items in the seemingly unpatterned successions of daily living, and are still breathing. The glazed plates and judicious annotations of the histories of costume compare ill with say, Pepys's descriptions of his new suits and the pompous delight and extravagance or the particular motives and occasions that went with their purchase. Sentiment and sentimentality, fancy, conformity, annoyance, vanity, the spirit of the moment and the occasion, are the soul of social history, but it is only in diaries and their like that the soul may be found. Similarly, the list should prove useful to scholars searching out new facts and opinions about people, events, and movements; about writers, painters, musicians, clergymen, generals; about counties, towns, and villages; about wars, politics, religion, literature, art, agriculture, economics, industrialism. I shall be happy if my book proves helpful to seekers after truth and new facts. I hope, too, that among its users may be some shrewd and imaginative enough to use it for another end to which it is well suited, the study of errors, misstatements, delusions, and rumors, which facts are at least as important and interesting as the narrower basic truths. But mostly I offer the book as a guide to reading about a great many people in the way that they thought, felt, and acted, and entertained ideas about themselves. Biographies are the usual doors of escape from the general patterns and large views of general history into the details that suggest the patterns. But only the Worthies are embalmed: the farm laborer, the dull wastrel, the town councilor, merit no biography. Here in the diaries, however, are people of all kinds, even the unworthy and the unwashed; here, scepter and crown are level with shovel and spade. The Middle Ages not having been an age of diaries, the reader will have to rest content this side the tomb with that grotesque con-\n\nPreface\n\n«\n\nvention, that algebraical formula, which is the medieval serf and plowman of Professor Owst's medieval preachers and Professor Owst's medieval colleagues. For a later period, though, the diaries provide what sociologists like to call a cross section of Englishmen, Scotsmen, Welshmen, and (despite the protests of a certain Eire-ish librarian and a certain IRA-te editor) Irishmen, from the sixteenth century until just before World War II. For those who are wont to ride with Gallup (not so many, these end-of-1948 days) and love the cross-sectional mind with its two monosyllabic opinions and percentile ignorance, for psychologists, sociologists, historians, genealogists, biographers, the book will have its various values. All I hope is that people who are interested in other people merely as individuals will use it, too. One historian who reviewed the American list, while welcoming the guidance it provided for historical research, doubted the value of a diary as a diary. I am not quite sure what was meant by \"value,\" nor indeed what was meant at all. But if it was meant that there is nothing peculiar or special about a diary to distinguish it from other forms of personal writing, then I protest with the weight of all my experience. One of the curiosities that has grown with this bibliomania of mine is turned on how people write about themselves. I have long been a reader of letters, and recently I have been reading autobiographies a great deal: very soon, I shall be burdening the bookshelves with a guide to them. The diary and the autobiography have this in common: they are both written by people about themselves. But the autobiography has a history and the diary has none. I once tried to write a history of the diary, only to find that I could produce nothing but a chronology. Except for religious diaries and certain literary productions resulting from the reading of Pepys, Amiel, Barbellion, diaries are mostly written without reference to other diaries and without influence from them, and so the form has no history except in the most general sense. It is far otherwise with autobiographies. Autobiographers tend to read biographies and other people's autobiographies before writing their own; and it is under this tutelage that they present their patterns of living—judicial pictures which share the lineaments\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\nand conventions of the most similar lives the writers knew. Autobiographies are nearly all literary works, written for publication and having, though rarely acknowledging, a literary parentage. There is not too much exaggeration in saying that they usually present type portraits made up of a careful selection of personal details. There is, it must be admitted, something of this selectiveness and patterning in diaries, too; and some diaries are written with an eye to publication. No diarist tells all, not even Pepys; the diarist omits and includes details of his living and thought according to the dominant views he has of himself. But a diarist rarely maintains one view of himself, and a diary which has a consistent pattern is a literary work and no diary at all. Any true diary includes a multitude of details about daily thoughts, emotions, and actions which would be pruned out in the careful topiary of a biography or autobiography. The diarist can see only the pattern of a day, not the pattern of a lifetime; if he is a true diarist, one day is likely to be at odds with another for any reader who thinks of people as having fixed characters. People in diaries, like people in real life, are prone to do and to think a variety of odd contrary things that would be regarded as inconsistent and inartistic in the patterned behavior of literature, biography, or autobiography. That for me is the real peculiarity and specialness, as well as one of the chief fascinations, of the diary as a way of writing. Only one other form of personal writing compares with it in this respect—the letter. But letters are intended for readers, and are likely to be colored by the relationship which exists between the correspondents: many a letter writer molds himself to the character which he thinks the recipient has of him. This in itself is a nice curiosity of human behavior which biographers might well take more heed of. At any rate, it makes letters much more artistic and patterned than diaries. In advancing these very fine and large generalizations on the nature of certain kinds of writing, I am well aware that they must be jettisoned in favor of any particular example, but in the generalizations lies my chief justification for assembling a book devoted solely to diaries. The methods used to collect the material for this book were at\n\nPreface\n\nXI\n\nbottom the same as those used for the American diary list, but more extensive since I was collecting autobiographies as well as diaries. First, the obvious bibliographical sources were combed: Arthur Ponsonby's three books on English, Irish, and Scottish diaries, and the Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature. A search was made all through the Dictionary of National Biography for titles and clues; and I scanned all the bibliographies on the open shelves of the Henry E. Huntington Library, the bibliographies and footnotes in all works on history, antiquities, literature, and biography on those same shelves, and the indices to Notes and Queries (which, apropos of my purposes, unfortunately provided more queries than notes). This preliminary work was complemented by searching subject and regional bibliographies in the libraries of the University of California at Los Angeles and at Berkeley, the Harvard libraries and the British Museum reading room, the catalogues of the London Library and a number of British town libraries, and about two thousand booksellers' catalogues of the last thirty years. Since it had been my experience that titles mislead almost as often as they guide, the collection of titles was conducted with proper allowance for the art of obscuration by title: as a result, several hundred titles later proved useless, although many items were caught which might otherwise have been missed. Here I might put in a plea for the penny plain as against the tuppence colored in titles: of such possible titles as The Diary of Humphrey Potter, iyo8-iyi2; Queen Anne's Bounty; The Diary of Humphrey Potter, 1J08-1J12: or, Queen Anne's Bounty, I like best the first, should not object to the third, and loathe the second as a varnished gloss which gives nothing but a spurious sheen. Such false titles grow more common, and it is well that scholars, at least, should not succumb to the increasing vulgarization of the times. With the titles so gathered, a short-title catalogue of diaries was prepared for checking against library holdings. In this checking I followed the same method as I used for the American diaries. In several great libraries which provide open access I thumbed through every available book that might be suspected of harboring a diary,\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\nrelying upon my eye (somewhat practiced by now) to catch the characteristic dates and shapes of the diary form. As I explained before, the method has its defects; the more popular books are occasionally missing from the shelves when the searcher's thumb arrives, his eye may not keep pace with his thumb, some books are kept off the open shelves, and even the greatest libraries are far from complete, especially in privately printed books. I hoped, however, that all the obvious and a proper proportion of the minor and obscure diaries had been caught by the preliminary bibliographical searching. In this way, the collections of the following libraries in the United States and England were examined: University of California at Los Angeles and at Berkeley, Huntington Library at San Marino, Widener Library at Harvard, Yale University Library, Library of Congress, Cambridge University Library (the only one of the British \"copyright\" libraries that provides open access to its collection), London Library, Royal Empire Society Library, Friends' Society Library in London, Library of the Society of Genealogists in London. I also glanced through a few public lending libraries in London; but I had no time to examine the local collections in provincial libraries. The material so found was nearly three times as extensive as that in the preliminary list; nevertheless, there remained in the preliminary list a considerable number of titles which had not been covered by the book-search method. When the book searching had been done, these unfound tides were examined against the catalogues of the British Museum Library, Bodleian Library, Widener Library, Yale University Library, and New York Public Library, and the union catalogue of American libraries housed in the Library of Congress. Since practically all the titles were in one or another of these libraries, it was possible to check nearly all the titles originally collected against the books themselves. Apart from some items which I am sure are ghosts, the titles I have been unable to locate are marked by an asterisk in the list. My book on American diaries excluded unpublished manuscripts, and I had originally intended to exclude them from this book, too. The collection of unpublished diaries and microfilms of unpublished\n\nPreface\n\n*iii\n\ndiaries which Professor Wallace Notestein has gathered at Yale University was come upon so early in my work, however, and proved so tempting, that I decided to include as much material about unpublished diaries as I could gather without too great expense of time. I have examined the manuscript collections of the following libraries and gathered details of all the unpublished British diaries I can find in them: Harvard Library, Yale University Library, New York Public Library, Library of Congress, Clements Library at the University of Michigan, Huntington Library; British Museum Library, Royal Empire Society Library, Bodleian Library, Cambridge University Library, Friends' Society Library, India Office Library, John Rylands Library in Manchester, Edinburgh University Library, National Library of Scotland, Signet Library. Since it was obvious that there might be a great deal of similar material in other and smaller libraries in Great Britain and Ireland, I decided to seek help from the librarians. I sent about a thousand letters to town, university, cathedral, school, and learned-society libraries listed in the handbooks of the Library Association and the A.S.L.I.B., and to city and county archives. Not the least of the pleasures accompanying my work on this book was the warm and generous response that the librarians and archivists made to this circular letter; many of those who had no diaries to contribute wrote expressing their regrets and their interest in the project; a gratifyingly large number were prompt to send in excellently full details of their holdings. Each item so obtained is here listed with the name of the librarian or archivist who provided the information; with this acknowledgment of indebtedness go my sincere thanks, which I hope at some time to express in person. A few libraries were unable to provide the information, for lack of staff, or because they held so many diaries that they could not deal with them suitably by correspondence. Occasionally, however, I was then fortunate enough to enlist the help of a local student or scholar; thus, Mr. R. V. Osbourn, assistant lecturer in English in the University of Manchester, was kind enough to prepare full descriptions of the rich collections of the Manchester Central Library and Chetham's Library; Mr. A. Farrington listed the holdings\n\nXIV\n\nPreface\n\nof the Royal Irish Academy; Mr. William Mackey those of Trinity College, Dublin, Mr. E. Gwynne Jones those of the University College of North Wales, and Mr. I. J. Sanders those of the National Library of Wales. The Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research often came to my rescue with its regular listings of the locations of historical MSS. There remained a few of the larger town libraries which I think may own manuscript diaries but which, quite understandably, have not yet responded. I have sought to include, however, all information from them which reached me before the book went to press. Mr. W. Hassall of the Bodleian Library suggested that I should try to include details of privately owned manuscript diaries. I was hesitant about attempting this because of the unlikelihood of getting anything more than a scattering. When I finally decided to do so, it was because Yale University's microfilm collection included a fair number of privately owned items, Arthur Ponsonby had included several such diaries in his books, Colonel Malet had generously allowed me to have copied the details of the privately owned diaries listed in the National Register of Archives, and anything I could add would be so much to the general good, even if it were not very much. With proper trepidation, I sent about two hundred letters to national, town, and county newspapers and journals in Great Britain and Ireland. Despite the paper shortage, a large proportion of the newspapers were generous and scholarly minded enough to publish the letter. If the response from their readers has been rather less than I hoped, the interest of the editors was heart warming to a student who hankers after assurance that his own enthusiasms do not seem entirely crazy to other people. Although I have made reasonably extensive efforts to obtain an adequate representation of published and unpublished British diaries, I make no claim to having achieved completeness. I have noticed too many items that ought to have been included in the American list to hazard any such claim. In the course of examining the books in the historical, literary, periodical, biographical, religious, travel, regional, genealogical, and other appropriate sections of the libraries I worked in, I have undoubtedly missed a good many diaries: I trust\n\nPreface\n\nxv\n\nthey are fewer than I fear they may be. I imagine that many diaries have been published in genealogies, town and county histories, and biographies which I have not seen, or which I thumbed through too hastily, and that local collections own many privately printed local items that I have not seen. Although diaries are sometimes published in newspapers and journals, I have lacked the courage and time to scan newspapers and I have examined thoroughly only the more promising popular weeklies and monthlies. I have gone carefully through all the appropriate learned periodicals and local historical and antiquarian society proceedings, however. The privately owned diaries listed here are probably only a small percentage of those that actually exist, and it is likely that there are manuscript diaries in various libraries which either did not receive my appeal or were unable to respond to it. Completeness is not only not claimed, but probably never could reasonably be claimed for such a list. But if readers will send me enough addenda, I promise to make them into a supplement. The method of handling the material is the same as in the book on American diaries. I have excluded travel narratives which are not day-by-day records, chronicles, commonplace books, ships' logs (though not diaries kept at sea, which seem to me to have a significant personal element), reminiscences, autobiographies, minutes, accounts, muster rolls, memoirs, all of which are sometimes called journals by their editors and publishers. I have also excluded parliamentary diaries and explorers' journals. I have dropped the impossible distinction between \"diary\" and \"journal\" which I unsuccessfully tried to maintain in the earlier book, and the books and manuscripts included here are diaries in my definition: a personal record of what interested the diarist, usuallly kept day by day, each day's record being self-contained and written soon after the events occurred, the style usually being free from organized exposition. As I intend to publish two other descriptive bibliographies of personal writings, one of British autobiographies, the other of Commonwealth diaries and autobiographies, I have imposed a geographical restriction on the material included here. Diaries relating to the British\n\nxvi\n\nPreface\n\ndominions and colonies will be included in the Commonwealth list, as also will diaries relating to Asia, the whole of Africa, and Latin America: this strange imperialism is purely for my own convenience. Sea diaries have been put into one or the other list as seems most appropriate. Diaries kept in the United States and American possessions up to i860 are already treated in my former book, and so are the diaries of English travelers in the United States; these will therefore be included in neither list, and those American travel items which I have found to supplement the earlier book I have given to Professor Ada Nisbet, who is publishing a bibliography of British Travellers in America. On the other hand, I have included here the diaries of American travelers in England and, although I have made no attempt to search all the American libraries for American manuscript diaries, the list contains a fair representation of published and unpublished material of the kind. In general, the book includes diaries written by Englishmen, Scotsmen, Welshmen, and Irishmen in the British Isles, in Europe, and on the high seas, and also the diaries of American and other travelers in the British Isles, so far as they have been published in England and in English. The published diaries included here are often extracts included in biographies, histories, genealogies, and other books which are themselves not diaries. Such extracts are admitted only when they are extensive enough to establish some idea of the diaries as separate entities; a diary which has been published only in brief quotations has been excluded, unless the whereabouts of the original manuscript is known. I have given a few biographical details about the diarists whenever such information was available without special research. It has usually been derived from the diaries themselves, editorial notes, or data in biographies and autobiographies; or from the Dictionary of National Biography, Who's Who, and Who Was Who, the Cambridge Bibliography, and the Library of Congress catalogue. I have tried to give the dates of the diaries by months and years, as in the manuscript or as actually published; where I have included a\n\nPreface\n\nxvii\n\ndiary which I have not actually examined and of which I do not know the dates I have included the item according to the date of publication. All dates are given in New Style. As in the book on American diaries, I have added two or three lines describing the chief contents of each diary; these notes are intended to give a rough characterization of the document and to indicate the chief subjects, places, and persons with which it deals. Whenever it seemed worth while to do so, a word or two of evaluation has been added. These notes and comments are those of a general reader who is an enthusiast about diaries, not those of a specialist in history. It is hoped that the evaluations will indicate where the chaff lies and where the grain, but no exactness is claimed for such judgments, which are often the impressions of only ten or fifteen minutes of rapid reading. In noting contents, I have usually indicated my own special interests in literature and language, as well as the subjects of more general and historical interest. The diaries are arranged chronologically, by years, according to the date of the first entries. Diaries beginning in the same year are arranged under that year alphabetically by the diarists' names, with Anonymous taking first place. Reviewers of the American list welcomed this arrangement, but pointed out the defect that a reader seeking diaries about particular events or periods had to begin searching many years before the date of his interest, since some diaries cover a lifetime. T o minimize this labor without adding too great a litter of cross references, I have supplied an index of diaries which extend over more than ten years, with their time extent; this means that, apart from this index, only ten years of the bibliography need be examined for any particular event. I reckon ten years by the interval between the year of the first and the year of the last entries; thus, a diary covering the period May 1706 to November 1715 would not be regarded as a tenyear diary, but would be excluded from this time index. Gaps of time within a diary are ignored for the purposes of this reckoning. For the benefit of biographers, genealogists, and some others, I have also given a name index of all the diarists except Anonymous.\n\nxviii\n\nPreface\n\nThe request of several reviewers for a subject index was so much easier to make than to satisfy that I have rejected the idea, as I did when handling the proofs of the American list. I then tried several possible ways of indexing the material, but discovered none that would be really useful. The diaries deal with a large proportion of all the counties, towns, and villages in the British Isles and many in Europe; they mention thousands of people, and touch on almost every topic of human interest. I know of no useful way of indexing such material. Before the date of each diary I have given an adjective of characterization: public, religious, political, literary, military, travel, personal, social, and so on. There is no advantage in grouping these in an index when they can be so easily traced in the list itself, and there is danger in a subject index which by noting certain subjects and not others suggests that the others may not be dealt with. Every diary includes a multiplicity of subjects which I have been unable to note; my annotations are suggestive, not comprehensive. It must not be assumed that because a document is called a religious diary it does not include secular material; almost certainly it does. I trust that it will not be too great a chore to read through the list itself or those parts that are appropriate; it will do historians no harm to be reminded that at the same time as, say, Nelson was writing, so were a crowd of villagers, clergymen, Quakers, private soldiers, men of letters, and housewives; it might even be possible to learn a good deal about Nelson by learning about other pebbles on the English shore. It is a pleasant duty to acknowledge here the chief of my debts. To the late Lord Ponsonby's books on diaries, Mr. Bateson and his cohorts on the Cambridge Bibliography, the unwitting booksellers who sent out catalogues, a small army of bibliographers, I owe the debt of all those who labor in the same fields. To the librarians of the collections in which I worked and their assistants I tender warm thanks for unvarying kindness and helpfulness; the world of books owes more to the learned and quiet men who keep them than it is easy to acknowledge. To the many librarians of municipal and local libraries who sent me details of their manuscripts and to those who regretted they had\n\nPreface\n\nxix\n\nnone I express my sincere gratitude for help given and interest shared. To the many newspaper editors who gave of their sadly limited space in publishing my request for privately owned diaries, and to the owners who responded, I render grateful acknowledgment. Special thanks are due to several scholars and students who have helped check material: to Miss Patricia Hann of London, Miss Audrey LaLievre, Mr. Arthur Munday, and Miss Audrey Rich, all of Cambridge ; Mr. George Mayhew of Harvard, Miss Gertrude Ruhnka and Dr. Jane Robinson of Los Angeles, and my former student, Professor Linda Van Norden of the University of California at Davis. To the following scholars I am greatly obliged for suggestions and generous help when needed: Professor Wallace Notestein and Professor Helge Kokeritz of Yale, Professor Douglas Bush of Harvard, Professor Miles Hanley and Mr. Louis Kaplan of Wisconsin, Professor Ada Nisbet of Los Angeles, Professor J. T . Higgins of the Illinois Institute of Technology, Professor James R. Sutherland of London, Professor Bruce Dickins of Cambridge, Professor H. B. Charlton and Mr. R. V. Osbourn of Manchester, Mr. W . Hassall of the Bodleian Library, the Rev. Frank Baker of Warsop, and Colonel G. Malet of the National Register of Archives. Mr. Edw. Hall, who has given a splendid collection of MS diaries to the Wigan Central Public Library, generously sent me his index cards covering it; I regret that space does not allow me to reproduce his loving and often witty notes in full. T o the Cambridge don who, seeing my huge pile of books,—myself hidden in the stacks—confided to his donnish friend, \"Feller comes from America; raving mad; last one came from Poland,\" goes the gratified mirth of my cockney heart. T o the Irish librarian who regretted he had no diaries but suggested that if I were including Irish material I should call the book \"Irish and English Diaries,\" and the Derry editor who printed my covering letter without the appeal itself but with a note of doubt that the learned professor had ever been to school, my gratitude for joining up with Cambridge to prove that, come high water and Americans, some things Irish and English and delectable never change.\n\nXX\n\nPreface\n\nTo my brother George and Peggy his wife, to Fergus O'Connor, Margaret Robertson, Mara Mack, Fernand and Ann Renier, and many others I give once more my warm regards and thanks for endless kindness and hospitality during my stay in England in the cold winter of 1947 and its splendid summer. The book would hardly have been possible had it not been for the generous financial help of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation and the University of California. Mr. Henry Allen Moe, the secretary of the Foundation, was an ever-bubbling fountain of kindness, and the Guggenheim Fellowship was a regular comfort. The Regents of the University of California not only granted me sabbatical leave for 1946-1947, but also for three years have given generous research grants which have made possible a good deal of assistance in checking the list. To Professors Sigurd B. Hustvedt and William Taylor, who took over some of my teaching while I was on leave, my best thanks. To Mr. W. H. Alexander and other members of the University of California Press, and to my wife Lois, who have all notably urged and assisted me toward the holy grail of accuracy, the humble thanks of a most fallible Lancelot.
