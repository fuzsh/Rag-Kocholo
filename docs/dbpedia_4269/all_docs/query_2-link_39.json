There was also a fourth book, The Treatise of the Virtue of Medicines, redacted by his students from notes taken during his lessons, which was translated in French in 1729. This volume, in in-8e format, of 471 pages, did not have the same success as his other books. It is anyway very interesting, because it shows that Boerhaave, even if he were Professor of Chemistry was not at all an iatrochemist but behaved as an iatromechanic.\n\n[Boerhaave and medication].\n\nPubMed\n\nLafont, Olivier\n\n2011-01-01\n\nHerman Boerhaave (1668-1738) was a well known physician from Leiden, who was essentially known in France for three of his books, which had been translated into French, and had much success during thel8th century, Elements of Chemistry, Aphorisms and Materia Medica.

Boerhaave's work, which systematized and synthesized the knowledge of the time, represents a shift from a humoral to a hydraulic model of the body in medicine and culture around 1700. This epistemological reconfiguration of early modern physiological thinking is exemplified with respect to the changing meanings of milk. While over centuries the analogy between blood and milk played an essential role in understanding the hidden workings of the nutritional faculties, following the discovery of the blood circulation the blood-milk analogy was transformed into a chyle-milk analogy. Yet Boerhaave's interpretations show that the use of new knowledge tools did not simply displace the old ways of reasoning. Instead, analogies continued to serve as epistemic instruments. Old theories and new insights overlapped, and contemporary knowledge assimilated past ideas. Copyright Â© 2011.

He was a medical teacher in Leiden, Holland, reaching great fame and celebrity in his city and around, extending outside of Europe into China. His contemporaries would name him \"Europe's professor\". He obtained his academic degrees in philosophy, chemistry and botany, but continued in medicine which more befit his nature. This brilliant man declared himself in favour of experimental knowledge instead of theory and, following Thomas Sydenham, he greatly contributed in making clinical medicine more systematic. In some extent he was the founder of academic hospitals. Boerhaave was an affectionate, cheerful and correct man, an admirable example of moderation, vigour, humbleness and devotion. In the last months of his life, suffering a painful disease, he showed his strength by letting his soul master himself, and resigned to the will of God.\n\n[Gaubius and medical chemistry].\n\nPubMed\n\nvan Gijn, Jan; Gijselhart, Joost P\n\n2011-01-01\n\nHieronymus David Gaub (1705-1780) was the son of a protestant cloth merchant in Heidelberg. Disliking a pietistic boarding school in Halle, Germany, he came to stay with a paternal uncle who was a physician in Amsterdam. Hieronymus studied medicine in Harderwijk and in Leiden, under the guidance of Herman Boerhaave (1668-1738). In 1731 he was appointed reader (and in 1734 professor) in chemistry at the Leiden medical faculty. After Boerhaave's death he also taught medicine, but without access to hospital beds. Gaubius correctly envisaged that chemistry would become an important discipline in medicine, but was limited by the technical constraints of his time. In his textbook of general pathology (1758) he attributed disease to disturbances of not only fluids, but also solid parts, although symptoms remained the basis of his classification. The book would remain influential for several decades, until the advent of pathological anatomy.\n\nBoerhaave on Fire\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDiemente, Damon\n\n2000-01-01\n\nIn 1741 an English translation of Herman Boerhaave's celebrated textbook Elementa Chemic was published under the title A New Method of Chemistry. True to its time, this book included elaborate discussions of the elements earth, water, air, and fire. This article offers to teachers for classroom use a selection of passages from Boerhaave's chapter on fire. Now, today's teacher of chemistry is apt to feel that little of significance to the modern classroom can be gleaned from a two-and-a-half-centuries-old text, and especially from a topic as old-fashioned as fire. But this view is decidedly shortsighted. Boerhaave offers demonstrations and experiments that can be instructively performed today, quantitative data that can be checked against modern equations, and much theory and hypothesis that can be assessed in light of modern chemical ideas. In the readings presented here I have found material for discussion in class, for investigation in the laboratory, and for a few homework assignments. Modern students are well able to comprehend and paraphrase Boerhaave, to check his results, appreciate his insights, and identify his shortfalls. From him they learn firsthand how painstaking and difficult it was to imagine and develop the concepts of thermochemistry. To read from his chapter on fire is to stand witness to the birth and infancy of thermodynamics as conceived in the mind of a great chemist from the age when coherent chemical theory was just beginning to emerge.\n\nBoerhaave's syndrome in a patient with an upside down stomach: A case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaito, Shin; Hosoya, Yoshinori; Kurashina, Kentaro; Matsumoto, Shiro; Kanamaru, Rihito; Ui, Takashi; Haruta, Hidenori; Kitayama, Joji; Lefor, Alan K; Sata, Naohiro\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSpontaneous esophageal perforation, or Boerhaave's syndrome, is a life-threating condition which usually requires emergent surgery. An upside down stomach is defined as a gastric volvulus in a huge supradiaphragmatic sac. In general, this condition can result in ischemia and perforation of the stomach. This is the first report of a patient with Boerhaave's syndrome and an upside down stomach. A 79-year-old woman presented with sudden epigastric pain following hematemesis. Evaluation of the patient showed both an esophageal perforation and an upside down stomach. Surgical drainage and irrigation of the mediastinum and pleural cavities were undertaken emergently. Due to the concurrent gastric volvulus, a gastrostomy was placed to fix and decompress the stomach. The patient had an uneventful hospital course and was discharged. Boerhaave's syndrome is a rare but severe complication caused by excessive vomiting, due to a sudden elevation in intraluminal esophageal pressure resulting in esophageal perforation. Acute gastric volvulus can result in ischemia and perforation of the stomach, but has not previously been reported with esophageal perforation. The most likely mechanism associating an upside down stomach with Boerhaave's syndrome is acute gastric outlet obstruction resulting in vomiting, and subsequent esophageal perforation. Perforation of the esophagus as well as perforation of the stomach must be considered in patients with an upside down stomach although both upside down stomach and Boerhaave's syndrome are rare clinical entities.

It must be regarded as an emergency condition that requires early diagnosis as well as very aggressive and rapid implementation of treatment in order to avoid serious complications and death. Methods of treatment for spontaneous esophageal perforation continue to be a matter of controversy. However, all authors emphasize that ultimate success depends largely on the time taken to establish the diagnosis. The authors of this study describe a rare case of duodenal ulcer perforation accompanied by Boerhaave syndrome. PMID:26702287\n\nA functional role of Rv1738 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis persistence suggested by racemic protein crystallography\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBunker, Richard D.; Mandal, Kalyaneswar; Bashiri, Ghader\n\nRacemic protein crystallography was used to determine the X-ray structure of the predicted Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein Rv1738, which had been completely recalcitrant to crystallization in its natural L-form. Native chemical ligation was used to synthesize both L-protein and D-protein enantiomers of Rv1738. Crystallization of the racemic {D-protein + L-protein} mixture was immediately successful. The resulting crystals diffracted to high resolution and also enabled facile structure determination because of the quantized phases of the data from centrosymmetric crystals. The X-ray structure of Rv1738 revealed striking similarity with bacterial hibernation factors, despite minimal sequence similarity. As a result, we predict that Rv1738,moreÂ Â» which is highly up-regulated in conditions that mimic the onset of persistence, helps trigger dormancy by association with the bacterial ribosome.Â«Â less\n\nA functional role of Rv1738 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis persistence suggested by racemic protein crystallography\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nBunker, Richard D.; Mandal, Kalyaneswar; Bashiri, Ghader; ...\n\n2015-04-07\n\nRacemic protein crystallography was used to determine the X-ray structure of the predicted Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein Rv1738, which had been completely recalcitrant to crystallization in its natural L-form.

Rv1738, a protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is strongly implicated in the onset of nonreplicating persistence, and thereby latent tuberculosis, resisted extensive attempts at crystallization. Chemical synthesis of the L- and D-enantiomeric forms of Rv1738 enabled facile crystallization of the D/L-racemic mixture. The structure was solved by an ab initio approach that took advantage of the quantized phases characteristic of diffraction by centrosymmetric crystals. The structure, containing L- and D-dimers in a centrosymmetric space group, revealed unexpected homology with bacterial hibernation-promoting factors that bind to ribosomes and suppress translation. This suggests that the functional role of Rv1738 is to contribute to the shutdown of ribosomal protein synthesis during the onset of nonreplicating persistence of M. tuberculosis.\n\nOn the discovery of UREA.

The substance was further characterized by Hermann Boerhaave from Leiden (1688-1738) in Elementa Chemiae where he described the whole procedure for isolating it from urine of healthy persons. The French scientists Fourcroy and Vauquelin, in 1808, named it \"ure\" whereas Jean-Etienne Brard from Montpellier established its chemical composition in 1817. The synthesis of urea was accomplished by Friedrich Whler (the first organic substance to be synthesized). Finally in 1851 Friedrich Th. von Frerichs introduced the term \"Uraemia\".\n\nRemembrance of immunology past: conversations with Herman Eisen.\n\nPubMed\n\nEisen, Herman N; Schlesinger, Sondra\n\n2015-01-01\n\nHerman Eisen and Sondra Schlesinger spent several days together in September 2007 in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, talking about immunology, focusing on his remembrances of the field over the more than 60 years of his involvement.

Furthermore, in the CpG ODN 1668+virus-injected group, significantly higher levels of MyD88 (6Â h, 1Â d, 4Â d and 7 dpi), IL1Î² (1Â d, 2Â d and 7 dpi) and perforin/granzyme (1 dpi) expression were observed, whereas these genes were not significantly expressed in the virus-injected group at that time points. Mx, ISG15 and PKR were significantly highly expressed at 4Â d and 7 dpi and reduced when low viral loads at 10 dpi in the CpG ODN 1668+virus-injected group. Conversely, in the virus-injected group, Mx, ISG15 and PKR expression were significantly higher than the control group until 10 dpi. However, MHC class I, CD8, Fas, Fas ligand and caspases (3, 8 and 9) expression levels showed no statistically significant differences between virus- and CpG ODN 1668+virus-injected group. In summary, CpG ODN 1668 administration in fish induces innate immune response or cell death pathway, which could be a major contributing factor to effective fish control over viral transcription on 4Â d to 10 dpi. Expression of MyD88, IL1Î², perforin and granzyme-related immune gene response is critical factor for inhibition of RBIV replication. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The tenets of queer theory provide scholars with a model to interrogate how sexuality and other differences play a fundamental role in rhetorical practice. Focusing on differences rather than similarities, queer critics seek to dismantle hierarchies by blurring the definitions of specific identity categories. A framework for queer rhetorical criticism is described and illustrated with a variety of examples from popular culture. The model is further illustrated through an examination of the body of work of Pee-wee Herman.\n\nA Paradoxical Partnership in Higher Education: The Alliance between Alfred C.

BS recognition is difficult, while rapidity of diagnosis, along with extension of the lesion, affects type and outcome of treatment. BS was classically treated by thoracotomy, but laparoscopic (LS), thoracoscopic (TS) surgery, and nonsurgical procedures as endoscopic stent positioning or use of glues have been described. Still, there is no model treatment, and selection of the most appropriate therapeutic procedure is complex in the absence of standardised criteria. We successfully managed a patient affected with BS by LS approach and present our experience along with a review of treatment options so far described. Our treatment integrated positioning of an oesophageal isoperistaltic endoluminal drain (IED), that we routinely use in oesophageal sutures at risk of leakage, and of which there is no previous report in the setting of BS. A 68 year old man presented to our attention with true BS, suspected on chest-abdominal CT scan and confirmed by upper GI contrast swallow test, showing leakage of hydro-soluble contrast from the lower third of the oesophagus. Of note, pleural cavities appeared intact. We performed an urgent laparoscopy 12 hours after the onset of symptoms. Laparoscopic toilet of the inferior mediastinum and dual layer oesophageal repair with pedicled omental flap were complemented by positioning of IED, feeding jejunostomy and two tubular drains. The patient had a slow but consistent recovery where IED played as a means of oesophageal suture protection, until he could be discharged home. We think that, when integrity of the pleura is documented, LS should be priority choice to avoid contamination of the pleural cavities. We have to consider every type of oesophageal repair in BS at risk of failure, and every means of protection of the suture is opportune. In our patient the oesophageal suture, covered with a flap of omentum\n\nBroadband Upgrade for the 1.668-GHz (L-Band) Radio Astronomy Feed System on the DSN 70-m Antennas\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHoppe, D.; Khayatian, B.; Lopez, B.; Torrez, T.; Long, E.; Sosnowski, J.; Franco, M.; Teitelbaum, L.\n\n2015-08-01\n\nCurrently, each of the three Deep Space Network (DSN) 70-m antennas provides a narrowband, 1.668-GHz (L-band) receive capability for radio astronomy observations. This capability is delivered by a large feedhorn mounted on the exterior of one of the feedcones. It provides a single polarization into a pair of redundant low-noise amplifiers. Recently, funding was obtained to upgrade this system to wideband (1.4-1.9 GHz) dual-polarization operation. This required development of a new feedhorn, polarizer, orthomode transducer (OMT), and waveguide transitions. In this article, we describe the design and laboratory testing of these components.\n\n[The vitalism of Paul-Joseph Barthez (1734-1806)].\n\nPubMed\n\nHan, Hee Jin\n\n2010-06-30\n\nDescartes (1596-1650), the iatromechanism of Herman Boerhaave (1668-1738), the iatrochemistry of Jan Baptist van Helmont (1579-1644), the animism of Stahl, and the organicism of Theophile de Bordeu (1722-1776). On the contrary, Barthez devoted himself to synthesize diverse doctrines and his vitalism consequently illustrated an eclectic character. Always taking a skeptical standpoint regarding the capacity of biomedical science, he defined his famous concept of 'vital principle (principe vital)' as the 'x (unknown variable)' of physiology. He argued that the hypothetical concept of vital principle referred to the 'experimental cause (cause experimentale)' verifiable by positive science. Thus, the vital principle was not presupposed as an a priori regulative principle. It was an a posteriori heuristic principle resulting from several experiments. The 'positivist hypothetism' of Barthez demonstrates not only pragmatism but also positivism in his scientific terminology. Furthermore, Barthez established a guideline for clinical practice according to his own methodological principles. It can be characterized as a 'humanist pragmatism' for the reason that all sort of treatments were permitted as far as they were beneficial to the patient. Theoretical incoherence or incommensurability among different treatments did not matter to Barthez. His practical strategy for clinical medicine consisted of three principles: namely, the natural, analytic, and empirical method. This formulation is indebted to the 'analytic method (methode analytique)' of the French empiricist philosopher Etienne Bonnot de Condillac (1714-1780). In conclusion, the eighteenth.century French vitalism conceived by Barthez pursued pragmatism in general, positivism in methodology, and humanism in clinics.\n\nUntangling the Herman-infrared spectra of nitrogen atmospheric-pressure dielectric-barrier discharge\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nÄermÃ¡k, Peter; AnnuÅ¡ovÃ¡, Adriana; RakovskÃ½, Jozef; MartiÅ¡ovitÅ¡, Viktor; Veis, Pavel\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThis study presents the first application of the N2 Herman-infrared (HIR) ro-vibrational model for the metrology of the atmospheric-pressure dielectric-barrier discharge. Our recent findings of suitable conditions for observation of the unperturbed HIR system (AnnuÅ¡ovÃ¡ et al Contrib. Plasma Phys. 2017) gave us the opportunity to develop and test a numerical representation of this complex system composed of 75 branches. Commonly, the HIR covers a part of the near infrared spectra (690â850 nm) with its bands mixed with the N2 first positive system (1PS), which hinders applications of these systems for optical metrology of the discharge. In this work, we present a complex ro-vibrational model of the 1PS and HIR systems, which allowed us to untangle their spectra and retrieve the rotational temperature and vibrational populations of the systems for the first time. The latter was achieved by coupling the PGHOPHER simulation package with molecular constants obtained from high-resolution experiments. To test the model, the results and precision were compared to the retrievals based on the models of the NO Î³ and N2 second positive systems using the LIFBASE and SPECAIR programs, respectively.\n\n['Anatomia actuosa et apta'. The mechanist 'proto'-physiology of B.S. Albinus].\n\nPubMed\n\nvan der Korst, J K\n\n1993-01-01\n\nAlready during his tenure as professor of anatomy and surgery (1721-1746) and before he became a professor of physiology and medicine at the University of Leiden, Bernard Siegfried Albinus held private lecture courses on physiology. In these lectures he pleaded for a separation of physiology from theoretical medicine, which was still its customary place in the medical curriculum of the first half of the eighteenth century. According to Albinus, physiology was a science in its own right and should be solely based on the careful observation of forms and structures of the human body. From the 'fabrica', the function ('aptitudo') could be derived by careful reasoning. As shown by a set of lecture notes, which recently came to light, Albinus adhered, initially, to a strictly mechanistic explanatory model, which was almost completely based on the physiological concepts of Herman Boerhaave. However, in contrast to the latter, he even rejected the involvement of chemical processes in digestion. Although his lectures were highly acclaimed as demonstrations of minute anatomy, Albinus met with little or no direct response in regard to his concept of physiology.\n\nG1738R is a BRCA1 founder mutation in Greek breast/ovarian cancer patients: evaluation of its pathogenicity and inferences on its genealogical history.\n\nPubMed\n\nAnagnostopoulos, Theodore; Pertesi, Maroulio; Konstantopoulou, Irene; Armaou, Sofia; Kamakari, Smaragda; Nasioulas, George; Athanasiou, Athanassios; Dobrovic, Alex; Young, Mary-Anne; Goldgar, David; Fountzilas, George; Yannoukakos, Drakoulis\n\n2008-07-01\n\nWe have performed screening in 287 breast/ovarian cancer families in Greece which has revealed that approximately 12% (8/65) of all index patients-carriers of a deleterious mutation in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, contain the base substitution G to A at position 5331 of BRCA1 gene. This generates the amino acid change G1738R for which based on a combination of genetic, in silico and histopathological analysis there are strong suggestions that it is a causative mutation. In this paper, we present further evidence suggesting the pathogenicity of this variant. Forty breast/ovarian cancer patients were reported in 11 Greek families: the above eight living in Greece, two living in Australia and one in USA, all containing G1738R. Twenty of these patients were screened and were all found to be carriers of the same base substitution. In addition, we have detected the same base change in five breast/ovarian cancer patients after screening 475 unselected patient samples with no apparent family history. The mean age of onset for all the above patients was 39.4 and 53.6 years for breast and ovarian cancer cases, respectively. A multi-factorial likelihood model for classification of unclassified variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 developed previously was applied on G1738R and the odds of it being a deleterious mutation was estimated to be 11470:1. In order to explain the prevalence of this mutation mainly in the Greek population, its genealogical history was examined. DNA samples were collected from 11 carrier families living in Greece, Australia and USA. Screening of eight intragenic SNPs, three intragenic and seven extragenic microsatellite markers and comparison with control individuals, suggested a common origin for the mutation while the time to its most recent common ancestor was estimated to be 11 generations (about 275 years assuming a generational interval of 25 years) with a 1-lod support interval of 4-24 generations (100-600 years).

The aim of this school was to put medicine on new scientific foundations-promoting unprejudiced clinical observation, botanical and chemical research, and the introduction of simple but powerful remedies. One of the products of this school was Anton StÃ¶rck (1731-1803), appointed Director of Austrian public health and medical education by Empress Maria Theresia. Following the tradition of the Vienna School, StÃ¶rck was the first scientist to systematically test the effects of so-called poisonous plants (e.g., hemlock, henbane, meadow saffron). Discovering new therapeutic properties in previously dreaded plants, StÃ¶rck used himself as a subject in experiments to determine tolerable dose levels. As a result of his investigations, StÃ¶rck was able to successfully treat his patients using the drugs he discovered. Samuel Hahnemann's later writings, including his \"Organon\", show that he was considerably influenced by StÃ¶rck's ideas. In fact, Hahnemann's clinical teacher at Vienna was a follower of StÃ¶rck, Joseph Quarin. Hahnemann's elaborate system of validating homeopath material can be seen as a development and refinement of the techniques he learned in Vienna.\n\nMeasurements of Band Intensities, Herman-Wallis Parameters, and Self-Broadening Line-Widths of the 30011 - 00001 and 30014 - 00001 Bands of CO2 at 6503 cm(exp -1) and 6076 cm(exp -1)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGiver, L. P.; Brown, L. R.; Wattson, R. B.; Spencer, M. N.; Chackerian, C., Jr.; Strawa, Anthony W. (Technical Monitor)\n\n1995-01-01\n\nRotationless band intensities and Herman-Wallis parameters are listed in HITRAN tabulations for several hundred CO2 overtone-combination bands. These parameters are based on laboratory measurements when available, and on DND calculations for the unmeasured bands. The DND calculations for the Fermi interacting nv(sub 1) + v(sub 3) polyads show the a(sub 2) Herman-Wallis parameter varying smoothly from a negative value for the first member of the polyad to a positive value for the final member. Measurements of the v(sub 1) + v(sub 3) dyad are consistent with the DND calculations for the a(sub 2) parameter, as are our recent measurements of the 4v(sub 1) + v(sub 3) pentad. However, the measurement-based values in the HITRAN tables for the 2v(sub 1) + v(sub 3) triad and the 3v(sub 1) + v(sub 3) tetrad do not support the DND calculated values for the a(sub 2) parameters. We therefore decided to make new measurements to improve some of these intensity parameters. With the McMath FTS at Kitt Peak National Observatory/National Solar Observatory we recorded several spectra of the. 4000 to 8000 cm(exp -1) region of pure CO2 at 0.011 cm(exp -1) resolution using the 6 meter White absorption cell. The signal/noise and absorbance of the first and fourth bands of the 3v(sub 1) + v(sub 3) tetrad of C-12O-16 were ideal on these spectra for measuring line intensities and broadening widths. Our selfbroadening results agree with the HITRAN parameterization, while our measurements of the rotationless band intensities are about 15% less than the HITRAN values. We find a negative value of a(sub 2) for the 30011-00001 band and a positive value for the 30014-00001 band, whereas the HITRAN values of a(sub 2) are positive for all four tetrad bands. Our a(sub 1) and a(sub 2) Herman-Wallis parameters are closer to DND calculated values than the 1992 HITRAN values for both the 30011-00001 and the 30014-00001 band.\n\nProximal Leakage After Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy: an Analysis of Preoperative and Operative Predictors on 1738 Consecutive Procedures.\n\nPubMed\n\nCesana, Giovanni; Cioffi, Stefano; Giorgi, Riccardo; Villa, Roberta; Uccelli, Matteo; Ciccarese, Francesca; Castello, Giorgio; Scotto, Bruno; Olmi, Stefano\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe purpose of this paper was to search for predictive factors for proximal leakage after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in a large cohort from a single referral center. One thousand seven hundred and thirty-eight patients, collected in a prospectively held database from 2008 to 2016, were retrospectively analyzed. The correlation between postoperative leakage and both preoperative (age, gender, height, weight, BMI, and obesity-related morbidities) and operative variables (the distance from pylorus at which the gastric section was started, operative time, experience of surgeons who performed the LSG, and the surgical materials used) was analyzed. The experience of the surgeons was calculated in the number of LSGs performed. The surgical materials considered were stapler, cartridges, and reinforcement of the suture. Proximal leakage was observed in 45 patients out of 1738 (2.6%). No correlation was found between leakage and the preoperative variables analyzed. The operative variables that were found to be associated with lower incidence of leakage at the multivariate analysis (pÂ <Â 0.05) were the reinforcement of the staple line (or overriding suture or buttressing materials) and the experience of the surgeons. A distance of less than 2Â cm from the pylorus resulted to be significantly related to a higher incidence of fistula at the univariate analysis. In this large consecutive cohort study of LSG, proximal staple line reinforcement (buttress material or suture) reduced the risk of a leak. The risk of a proximal leak was much higher in the surgeons first 100 cases, which has implications for training and supervision during this \"learning curve\" period.\n\nInvestigations on the \"Extreme\" Microbial Methane Cycle within the Sediments of an Acidic Impoundment of the Inactive Sulfur Bank Mercury Mine: Herman Pit, Clear Lake, California.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOremland, R. S.; Baesman, S. M.; Miller, L. G.; Wei, J. H. C.; Welander, P. V.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe inactive Sulfur Bank Mercury Mine is located in a volcanic region having geothermal flow and gas inputs into the Herman Pit impoundment. The acidic (pH 2 - 4) waters of the Herman Pit are permeated by hundreds of continuous flow gas seeps that contain CO2, H2S and CH4. We sampled one seep and found it to be composed of 95 % CO2 and 5 % CH4, in agreement with earlier measurements. Only a trace of ethane (10 - 20 ppm) was found and propane was below detection, resulting in a high CH4/C2H6 + C3H8 ratio of > 5,000, while the Î´13CH4 and the Î´13CO2 were respectively - 24 and - 11 per mil. Collectively, these results suggested a complex origin for the methane, being made up of a thermogenic component resulting from pyrolysis of buried organics, along with an active methanogenic portion. The relatively 12C-enriched value for the CO2 suggested a reworking of the ebullitive methane by methanotrophic bacteria. We found that dissolved methane in the collected water from 2-4 m depth was high (~ 400 ÂµM), which would support methanotrophy in the lake's aerobic biomes. We therefore tested the ability of bottom sediments to consume methane by conducting aerobic incubations of slurried bottom sediments. Methane was removed from the headspace of live slurries, and subsequent additions of methane to the headspace over the course of 2-3 months resulted in faster removal rates suggesting a buildup of the population of methanotrophs. This activity could be transferred to an artificial medium originally devised for the cultivation of acidophilic iron oxidizing bacteria (Silverman and Lundgren, 1959; J. Bacteriol. 77: 642 - 647), suggesting the possibility of future cultivation of acidophilic methanotrophs. A successful extraction of some hopanoid compounds from the sediments was achieved, although the results were too preliminary at the time of this writing to identify any hopanoids specifically linked to methanotrophic bacteria.

R.; Stoneburner, B.; Saltikov, C.; Oremland, Ronald S.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe involvement of prokaryotes in the redox reactions of arsenic occurring between its +5 [arsenate; As(V)] and +3 [arsenite; As(III)] oxidation states has been well established. Most research to date has focused upon circum-neutral pH environments (e.g., freshwater or estuarine sediments) or arsenic-rich âextremeâ environments like hot springs and soda lakes. In contrast, relatively little work has been conducted in acidic environments. With this in mind we conducted experiments with sediments taken from the Herman Pit, an acid mine drainage impoundment of a former mercury (cinnabar) mine. Due to the large adsorptive capacity of the abundant Fe(III)-rich minerals, we were unable to initially detect in solution either As(V) or As(III) added to the aqueous phase of live sediment slurries or autoclaved controls, although the former consumed added electron donors (i.e., lactate, acetate, hydrogen), while the latter did not. This prompted us to conduct further experiments with diluted slurries using the live materials from the first incubation as inoculum. In these experiments we observed reduction of As(V) to As(III) under anoxic conditions and reduction rates were enhanced by addition of electron donors. We also observed oxidation of As(III) to As(V) in oxic slurries as well as in anoxic slurries amended with nitrate. We noted an acid-tolerant trend for sediment slurries in the cases of As(III) oxidation (aerobic and anaerobic) as well as for anaerobic As(V) reduction. These observations indicate the presence of a viable microbial arsenic redox cycle in the sediments of this extreme environment, a result reinforced by the successful amplification of arsenic functional genes (aioA, andÂ arrA) from these materials.\n\nKSC-2013-1668\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2013-02-27\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - In the Space Station Processing Facility at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, engineers prepare experiments for loading aboard the SpaceX Dragon capsule for launch to the International Space Station.

We conducted a retrospective, population-based study of a sample of 1738 patients diagnosed with a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the department of Bas-Rhin (northeastern France) between 1982 and 1997. Our study aimed to describe symptoms at presentation, stage, histological distribution, treatment modalities, and survival, according to sex. Tobacco exposure differed significantly according to sex: 28.9% of women were nonsmokers versus 1.4% of the men. More NSCLC were metastatic at diagnosis in women than in men (41.1% versus 29.9%). Adenocarcinoma predominated in women (54.4%), whereas squamous cell carcinoma predominated in men (65.9%). Invasive procedures, such as transthoracic needle biopsy, contributed more frequently to histological diagnosis in women. Men and women underwent the same procedures for disease staging, excepted for the abdominal computed tomography scan, which was performed more frequently in women. Treatment also differed: in resectable disease, fewer pneumonectomies were performed in women; in locally advanced disease, the mean doses of thoracic irradiation were significantly lower in women (48.0 grays versus 55.5 grays); in metastatic-stage disease, fewer women received platin-based chemotherapy, but this difference was not significant. Sex was not a significant prognostic factor in our study, contrary to most North American studies, where women seem to have had better survival rates. This study emphasizes gender differences in smoking exposure, presentation (stage, histological subtype), and diagnostic and therapeutic management of NSCLC.\n\nKSC-2009-1738\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2009-02-19\n\nVANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. -- On Launch Complex 576-E at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory, or OCO, has been erected atop Orbital Sciences' Taurus XL rocket for a Feb. 24 launch.

Recent advances in immunostimulatory treatments based on conserved microbial components led us to assess the potential of oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) for decreasing the sensitivity of neonates to Cryptosporidium parvum infection. Neonate mice were treated orally or intraperitoneally (ip) with CpG ODNs or non-CpG ODNs 24 h before C. parvum infection, and parasite load and cytokine up-regulation were evaluated. CpG ODN 1668 and non-CpG ODN 1668 administered orally, as well as CpG ODN 1668 administered ip, induced an 80%-95% decrease in intestinal parasite load 6 days after infection. Intraperitoneal and oral pretreatment with CpG ODN 1668 led to a strong initial up-regulation of cytokines and CD69 messenger RNA in the intestine and a decrease in parasite load by a Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)-dependent mechanism. By contrast, oral administration of non-CpG ODN 1668 decreased parasite load by a TLR9-independent mechanism. The control of neonatal C. parvum infection by ip or oral administration of ODNs is feasible by 2 different mechanisms: (1) the well-known interaction involving CpG/TLR9, leading to the production of cytokines and lymphocyte activation, and (2) a new unknown mechanism that is independent of TLR9 and effective orally.\n\nNear-Infrared Spectroscopy of the Y0 WISEP J173835.52+273258.9 and the Y1 WISE J035000.32-565830.2: the Importance of Non-Equilibrium Chemistry\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLeggett, S.

A FLAMINGOS-2 R = 540 spectrum was obtained for W0350, covering 1.0 < ? micrometer < 1.7, and a cross-dispersed GNIRS R = 2800 spectrum was obtained for W1738, covering 0.993 - 1.087 micrometer, 1.191 - 1.305 micrometer, 1.589 - 1.631 micrometer, and 1.985 - 2.175 micrometer, in four orders. We also present revised Y JH photometry for W1738, using new NIRI Y and J imaging, and a re-analysis of the previously published NIRI H band images. We compare these data, together with previously published data for late-T and Y dwarfs, to cloud-free models of solar metallicity, calculated both in chemical equilibrium and with disequilibrium driven by vertical transport. We find that for the Y dwarfs the non-equilibrium models reproduce the near-infrared data better than the equilibrium models. The remaining discrepancies suggest that fine-tuning the CH4/CO and NH3/N2 balance is needed. Improved trigonometric parallaxes would improve the analysis. Despite the uncertainties and discrepancies, the models reproduce the observed near-infrared spectra well. We find that for the Y0, W1738, T(sub eff) = 425 +/- 25K and log g = 4.0 +/- 0.25, and for the Y1, W0350, T(sub eff) = 350 +/- 25K and log g = 4.0 +/- 0.25. W1738 may be metal-rich. Based on evolutionary models, these temperatures and gravities correspond to a mass range for both Y dwarfs of 3 - 9 Jupiter masses, with W0350 being a cooler, slightly older, version of W1738; the age of W0350 is 0.3 - 3 Gyr, and the age of W1738 is 0.15 - 1 Gyr.\n\n50 CFR 679.90 - Allocation, use, and transfer of Amendment 80 QS permits.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-10-01\n\n..., NMFS, P.O.

The positive effects of this new method for preventing smallpox were already known in the Netherlands around 1720, one of whom was the Dutch physician Boerhaave. In spite of this, it took another 30 years before variolation was used in the Netherlands. Despite receiving positive advice and information from his learned English friends Sloane and Sherard, Boerhaave did not apply nor advise the use of variolation. There were various arguments for this restrained approach. In 1754 Thomas Schwencke found that conditions were favourable for the introduction of variolation in The Hague. There was support from the House of Orange-Nassau (the current royal family in the Netherlands) and from a learned society; a highly motivated clergyman acted as ambassador for the new technique and the court physician Schwencke was willing to take the lead. A similar combination had previously been effective in England, though the ambassador there was not a clergyman but an influential noble lady.\n\nNear-infrared spectroscopy of the Y0 WISEP J173835.52+273258.9 and the Y1 WISE J035000.32â565830.2: The importance of non-equilibrium chemistry\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nLeggett, Sandy K.; Tremblin, Patrick; Saumon, Didier; ...\n\n2016-06-03\n\nHere, we present new near-infrared spectra, obtained at Gemini Observatory, for two Y dwarfs: WISE J035000.32â565830.2 (W0350) and WISEP J173835.52+273258.9 (W1738).

Since such a complete set of any given exponent can constitute the identity operator, the exponent may be varied from time to time without loss of generality as long as it is set common to all the Gaussians. However, a finite truncation of the coherent state expansion should result in different values of the propagator depending on the choice of the exponents. Furthermore, approximation methodology to treatmoreÂ Â» with the exact propagator can also depend on this choice, and thereby many different semiclassical propagators may emerge from these combinations. Indeed, we show that the well-known semiclassical propagators such as those of Van Vleck, Herman-Kluk, Heller's thawed Gaussian, and many others can be derived in a systematic manner, which enables one to comprehend these semiclassical propagators from a unified point of view. We are particularly interested in our generalized form of the Herman-Kluk propagator, since the relative accuracy of this propagator has been well established by Kay, and since, nevertheless, its derivation was not necessarily clear. Thus our generalized Herman-Kluk propagator replaces the classical Hamiltonian with a Gaussian averaged quantum Hamiltonian, generating non-Newtonian trajectories. We perform a numerical test to assess the quality of such a family of generalized Herman-Kluk propagators and find that the original Herman-Kluk gives an accurate result. The reason why this has come about is also discussed.Â«Â less\n\nDistribution of inhomogeneities in the interstellar plasma in the directions of three distant pulsars from observations with the RadioAstron ground-space interferometer\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPopov, M.

I.\n\n2016-09-01\n\nThe RadioAstron ground-space interferometer has been used to measure the angular sizes of the scattering disks of the three distant pulsars B1641-45, B1749-28, and B1933+16. The observations were carried out with the participation of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope; two 32-m telescopes at Torun, Poland and Svetloe, Russia (the latter being one antenna of the KVAZAR network); the Saint Croix VLBA antenna; the Arecibo radio telescope; the Parkes, Narrabri (ATCA), Mopra, Hobart, and Ceduna Australian radio telescopes; and the Hartebeesthoek radio telescope in South Africa. The full widths at half maximum of the scattering disks were 27 mas at 1668 MHz for B1641-45, 0.5 mas at 1668 MHz for B1749-28, and 12.3 at 316 MHz and 0.84 mas at 1668 MHz for B1933+16. The characteristic time scales for scatter-broadening of the pulses on inhomogeneities in the interstellar plasma Ïsc were also measured for these pulsars using various methods. Joint knowledge of the size of the scattering disk and the scatter-broadening time scale enables estimation of the distance to the effective scattering screen d. For B1641-45, d = 3.0 kpc for a distance to the pulsar D = 4.9 kpc, and for B1749-28, d = 0.95 kpc for D = 1.3 kpc. Observations of B1933+16 were carried out simultaneously at 316 and 1668 MHz. The positions of the screen derived using the measurements at the two frequencies agree: d 1 = 2.6 and d 2 = 2.7 kpc, for a distance to the pulsar of 3.7 kpc. Two screens were detected for this pulsar from an analysis of parabolic arcs in the secondary dynamic spectrum at 1668 MHz, at 1.3 and 3.1 kpc. The scattering screens for two of the pulsars are identified with real physical objects located along the lines of sight toward the pulsars: G339.1-04 (B1641-45) and G0.55-0.85 (B1749-28).\n\nConversations With Wargamers\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2009-01-01\n\nDATES COVERED (From To) 4 .

CpG ODNs are known as immunostimulant, can improve the innate immune system of fish providing resistance to diseases. In this study, we evaluated the potential of CpG ODNs to induce anti-viral status protecting rock bream from different RBIV infection conditions. We found that, when administered into rock bream, CpG ODN 1668 induces better antiviral immune responses compared to other 5 CpG ODNs (2216, 1826, 2133, 2395 and 1720). All CpG ODN 1668 administered fish (1/5Âµg) at 2days before infection (1.1Ã10 7 ) held at 26Â°C died even though mortality was delayed from 8days (1Âµg) and 4days (5Âµg). Similarly, CpG ODN 1668 administered (5Âµg) at 2days before infection (1.2Ã10 6 ) held at 23/20Â°C had 100% mortality; the mortality was delayed from 9days (23Â°C) and 11days (20Â°C). Moreover, when CpG ODN 1668 administered (1/5/10Âµg) at 2/4/7days before infection or virus concentration was decreased to 1.1Ã10 4 and held at 20Â°C had mortality rates of 20/60/30% (2days), 30/40/60% (4days) and 60/60/20% (7days), respectively, for the respective administration dose, through 100 dpi. To investigate the development of a protective immune response, survivors were re-infected with RBIV (1.1Ã10 7 ) at 100 and 400 dpi, respectively. While 100% of the previously unexposed fish died, 100% of the previously infected fish survived. The high survival rate of fish following re-challenge with RBIV indicates that protective immunity was established in the surviving rock bream. Our results showed the possibility of developing preventive measures against RBIV using CpG ODN 1668 by reducing RBIV replication speed (i.e. water temperature of 20Â°C and infection dose of 1.1Ã10 4 ).

Over 15 years ago, there was little agreement on the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (Perry and Klerman 1978), but efforts to specify the constructs and respective criteria for the borderline diagnosis spurred a plethora of systematic research. The result is that, next to antisocial personality disorder, borderline has become one of the best-documented and validated personality disorders (Perry and Vaillant 1989). One important shift has been that good descriptive studies have gradually led to studies of etiological factors, such as childhood physical and sexual abuse, and severe neglect (Herman et al. 1989; Perry and Herman 1992), which in turn have led to empirically based treatment approaches (Herman 1992; Perry et al. 1990). Despite inclusion in The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III and DSM-III-R), narcissistic personality is still at the beginning of this process of description, empirical testing, and validation (Gunderson et al. 1991). This study empirically examines three descriptions of narcissistic personality in order to look for common underlying dimensions that may have etiological and treatment significance.\n\n38 CFR 17.38 - Medical benefits package.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n... is deemed to promote health if the care will enhance the quality of life or daily functional level of... current quality of life or daily functional level of the veteran, prevent the progression of disease, cure... restore the quality of life or daily functional level that has been lost due to illness or injury.

This chaotic situation was reversed by the foresight and breadth of vision of the Empress Maria Theresa, who initiated considerable reform in Austria by actively recruiting the best minds of the time to reduce the intellectual and technologic differences. Her ability to entice one of Boerhaave's most eminent pupils, Gerard van Swieten, to leave Leiden for Vienna, particularly benefited the Vienna Medical School. In 1745 van Swieten assumed responsibility for reconfiguration of the patronage and nepotism-ridden medical system of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. As a first task, he swiftly expunged the influence of the Jesuits and other religious orders from medicine and established formal training and examinations, transforming the medical discipline into a meritocracy. Excelling as a physician and an innovative teacher, he also established a close personal relationship with the Empress and became her medical confidante. To a large part, the success of this first great Viennese medical school was owed to de Haen, who left Leiden to implement Boerhaave's method of clinical teaching. As a result of these innovations and with considerable support from the Empress, the University of Vienna, particularly its medical school, within a few decades achieved recognition throughout Europe as a seat of learning and scholarship. Van Swieten would not be remembered today if his contribution had been only scholarly or scientific achievements. He propelled Austrian medicine to a level commensurate with that of other European states of the day by 27 years of dedicated and industrious service.\n\nTreatment of Postoperative Leaks of the Upper Gastrointestinal Tract with Colonic Self-Expandable Metal Stents.\n\nPubMed\n\nSousa, Paula; Castanheira, AntÃ³nio; Martins, Diana; Pinho, Juliana; AraÃºjo, Ricardo; Cancela, EugÃ©nia; Ministro, Paula; Silva, AmÃ©rico\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThe use of self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) for the treatment of postoperative leaks of the upper gastrointestinal tract is already established. However, there are discrepancies between the relatively small caliber of the esophageal stents available and the postsurgical luminal size, which may determine an inadequate juxtaposition. As colonic stents have a bigger diameter, they might be more adequate. Additionally, stents with a larger diameter might have a lower risk of migration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and complications associated with the use of colonic fully covered SEMS (FSEMS) in the treatment of postoperative leaks in critical patients. All patients with postoperative leaks of the upper gastrointestinal tract treated with colonic stents (HanarostentÂ® CCI) between 2010 and 2013 were retrospectively included. Four patients with postoperative leaks were treated with colonic SEMS. The underlying surgeries were a gastric bypass, an esophagogastrectomy for Boerhaave syndrome, a primary repair of esophagopleural fistula due to Boerhaave syndrome, and an esophagectomy due to esophageal cancer. The leaks were detected on average 17 days after the initial surgery. All patients needed admission to a critical care unit after index surgery. Stent placement was technically feasible in all patients. The median residence time of the stents was 7 weeks, and no complications were verified when they were removed. There were no cases of stent migration. The treatment was successful in all patients, with complete healing of the leaks. The placement of colonic FSEMS seems to be successful and safe in the treatment of postoperative leaks of the upper gastrointestinal tract.\n\nHydropneumothorax Due to Esophageal Rupture.\n\nPubMed\n\nShiber, Joseph R; Fontane, Emily; Ra, Jin H; Kerwin, Andrew J\n\n2017-06-01\n\nA brief review of the historical aspects of esophageal rupture is presented along with a case and current recommendations for diagnostic evaluation and treatment. A 97-year-old woman complained of acute dyspnea without prior vomiting. Chest x-ray study showed a large right pneumothorax with associated effusion. A thoracostomy tube was placed with return of > 1Â L turbid fluid with polymicrobial culture and elevated pleural fluid amylase level. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated overt leakage of oral contrast into the right pleural space. She was treated with ongoing pleural evacuation, antibiotics, antifungals, and total parenteral nutrition. The patient and family declined surgical resection as well as endoscopic stent placement. In 1724, Boerhaave described spontaneous rupture of the esophagus postmortem; Boerhaave syndrome remains the name for complete disruption of the esophageal wall in the absence of pre-existing pathology typically occurring after vomiting. It most commonly occurs in the distal left posterolateral thoracic esophagus. Contrast esophagram is considered the \"gold standard\" for diagnosing esophageal rupture although CT esophagography also shows good diagnostic performance. Treatment includes nil per os"
