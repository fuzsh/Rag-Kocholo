He and Iris Butler were\n\nmarried 6 January, 1927. Her husband's brother was Marshal of Royal Air\n\nForce the 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford, KG.\n\nHer early married years were spent at Meerut, and in the early 1930s\n\nGervas Portal went to Bombay as Commanding Officer of the governor's\n\nbodyguard. He subsequently served as Comptroller of the Household of the\n\nNizam of Hyderbad.\n\nAfter the outbreak of WW2, Iris Portal became a nurse at Delhi, then\n\nfollowed her husband to Ranchi to work in a military hospital on the\n\nborder with Burma.\n\nShe finally left India in 1943 and her husband followed three years\n\nlater. They settled in Norfolk. Iris was a prominent member of the local\n\nSt John Ambulance, the British Legion, and a Commissioner in the Girl\n\nGuides. She contributed reviews to the local Norfolk newspaper.\n\nGervas Portal died 3 December, 1961. Iris Portal began to fill her days\n\nby researching her first book, *Rule of Three* [1967], a study of Queen\n\nAnne and her favourites, Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough and Abigail Hill.\n\nHer next tome was *The Viceroy's Wife: Letters of Alice, Countess of\n\nReading, from India 1921-1925* [1969].\n\nShe shared her vivid reminiscences of days of the Raj with writers such\n\nas Charles Allen, for his book *Plain Tales from the Raj* [1975].\n\nIris Portal is survived by her two daughters.\n\n--"
