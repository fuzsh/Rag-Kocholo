In November 1734 he was paid £2 12s 6d for a mahogany dining table 4ft 3in. by 5ft, and in August 1738 18s for a settee for the Earl's dressing room. A garden seat and ‘a framed stand for the gardener to clip the garden hedges with’ were paid for in July 1740. These appear rather minor items for which a local craftsman might be employed. In 1732 however an account was submitted by Gainge, of which no details survive, for £513 17s 4d of which amount £498 5s was settled, suggesting a much larger scale of operation and the possibility that he was a London craftsman.

Although insurance cover of £300 was taken out only £100 of this was in respect of stock, utensils and goods in trust. A year later however the figures had risen to £650 and £250 respectively. In January 1809 the business was trading from 3 Peters Ct, St Martin's Lane and a year later from 15 Green St, Leicester Sq. The first mention of the business in directories is in 1819 and from this date until 1827 is simply recorded as George Gairdner, though upholstery is added to the trade previously offered. From 1819–25 the address was 132 Long Acre, but from 1823 80 Tottenham Ct Rd is also listed and this was to continue after 1825 as the sole address. The insurance cover in 1823 on the Tottenham Ct Rd premises was £600 of which £390 was for utensils and stock. In 1839 the business was trading as George Gairdner & Sons, u.

May have been in partnership with William Gale from 1777 though he is not mentioned in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings. Although the existence of the business appears to have been relatively short it did attract influential customers. In the period 1775–77 the 2nd Earl of Shelburne was supplied with goods to the value of £556 3s for either his London house or Bowood, Wilts. Lord Mahon paid Gale £617 6s 6d in the years 1776–77 and the Rev. Mr Drake of Shardeloes, Amersham, Bucks. provided patronage in 1777. Of this latter commission we have details of the items supplied.

In 1827 their house is given as 6 Shaw's Brow and in 1835 Anthony was living at 6 Beau St, the number changing to 11 in 1839. By 1833 the partnership appears to have ended and Anthony continued the business himself. His stock also diversified and in that year he offered additionally ‘a valuable & choice Collection of Ancient & Modern PAINTINGS’, picture frames, artists’ colours and materials, optical and mathematical instruments, spectacles, jewellery, fishing equipment and ‘Ornamental Shells, Curiosities etc. Napoleon Medals in Silver & Bronze Coins etc.’ [D; Liverpool Mercury, 23 November 1821, 13 September 1833]\n\nGalley, Andrew, 166 Ratcliffe Highway, London, looking-glass manufacturer (1839).

The business was clearly in existence well before this date and London Gazette, 28–31 January 1709/10 advertised that Richard Lewis an app. cane chairmaker, born in Shropshire, had absconded from his master at ‘The Crown’ in St Paul's Churchyard. It is highly likely that Gammage was the master involved. Gammage was dead by March 1725 in which month his widow advertised that she had for disposal ‘All Sorts of Chairs and Couches, Mahogenny Wood, Virginia Walnut, English Walnut, and Walnut-Tree Wood for Gun Stocks’. She indicated that she was ‘designing to leave off trade’. From 1725–30 the premises were used as a tavern retaining the previous trade sign, but in the latter year they reverted once more to a chairmaking and furniture business when John Brown took them over.

His son Timothy was app. to him and declared free on 3 May 1724, and was probably a partner by the early 1730s when the business was referred to as Timothy Ganning & Co.

He claimed to have in stock ‘A Choice Collection of French Carved Picture, Chimney & Pier Frames, also French Carved Console & Pier Tables, Cabriole Chairs, Sofas &’ and offered a service of restoring frames and mirrors. He also relined and restored paintings. Garbanati attracted influential clients. In June 1807 Sir John Geers Cottrell of Garnons, near Hereford paid him £5 13s 6d for looking-glass frames though it is not known if these were for Garnons or his London house in Hertford St. In June 1826 the Duke of Norfolk was supplied with ‘a Handsome French Frame’ for £6 12s.

William Gates was a cm who specialized in fine inlay and engraved woodwork. He succeeded John Bradburn as a tradesman to the Great Wardrobe, his warrant from George III being dated July 1777. Gates's first recorded commission from the Royal Household came in 1778 when he supplied ‘a very neat mahogany cistern’ for the dining room of the Queen's House, St James's Park, at a cost of £8 10s.\n\nLike many English 18th-century cm Gates's life has glaring gaps through lack of information. In 1779 Gates was insured for a total of £1,000 which covered stock and goods. [GL, Sun MS vol. 275, p. 289] In March 1780 he was listed as bankrupt. [Gents Mag.] Gates obviously weathered this crisis for he kept his Royal Warrant and the Lord Chamberlain's Office returns for the quarter ending January 1781 list him as having supplied a ‘Sattinwood writing table with a Tambour top’; this table was inlaid and engraved with the feathers of the Prince of Wales, and cost £24 19s.\n\nTwo seminal pieces in Gates's oeuvre are ‘2 very fine Sattinwood inlaid commode tables to stand under piers with semi-circular fronts’. These were supplied in 1781 to the Prince of Wales, later George IV, for his apartments in the Queen's House, St James's Park (Buckingham Palace). The cabinets cost £80 plus an extra £3 1s 6d for two leather covers. Each commode has three drawers in the frieze, two doors in the centre, which open to reveal drawers, and two doors either side enclosing cupboards. The doors are inlaid with ovals enclosing tall urns; the semi-circular tops have urns in the centre with Neo-classical floral scrolls emerging from the base. They are still in Buckingham Palace. [Burlington, July 1931, pp. 22–27] Gates also made other, less elaborate furniture, an example of which is the ‘Clothes Press with fluted Cornice and carved Paterae’ supplied for £20 to a Mr Hawkins of Kew, Surrey.\n\nIn 1738 William Gates formed a short-lived partnership with Benjamin Parran, the nephew of Benjamin Goodison. During 1784 Gates lost his Royal Warrant. This may have had a connection with the fact that George, Prince of Wales, was allowed his own household and his accounts were no longer controlled by the Lord Chamberlain's Office. It is not known why the Prince should have withdrawn his patronage but it must have had a detrimental effect on Gates's career. In 1784 he moved from the fashionable cabinet makers’ street of St Martin's Lane to 30 St Albans Hill. [D] He continued in business and at least by the turn of the century was associated with Charles Elliott. The date of his death, like that of his birth, is not known.\n\nTo judge from the surviving examples of his work Gates was one of the foremost inlay workers of his day. He probably designed his own pieces but in at least one case he worked to a drawing supplied by the Prince of Wales. This was in 1780 for a pair of ‘superb tripods or thermes’. Apart from cabinet making, Gates may have been involved in building speculation for in 1774 he took out a policy with the Sun Insurance Co. on a house in Owens Row, Islington.

[D] Succeeded by William Charles Gee.\n\nGee, John, London, chairmaker and turner (1779–c. 1824) also listed as Gee & Sons (1809) and Gee, Thomas Ayliffe (1804– 09?). In about 1779 John Gee replaced Thomas Ayliffe as partner to Benjamin Crompton, who had been Turner in Ordinary to George III since 1762. On 14 October 1787 Gee was sworn in as turner ‘jointly with Thos. Ayliffe his partner’, but his name, unlike Ayliffe's, does not appear in the Court and City Register until 1799. Ayliffe was the fourth member of his family to be a turner to the King, so Gee was probably the junior partner. In 1790 Lord Wilton bought chairs for the Music Room at Heaton Hall, Lancs. ‘2 June 1790 Aycliffe & Gees Bill for chairs etc. £49 8s.’. [Preston RO, DD/Eg 153/1–8] From 1799, when he is described as ‘Chair-maker, 49 Wardour Street, Soho’, Gee is listed in London directories. In 1803 [D] he is called ‘Chairmaker & Turner to His Majesty’ and this title occurs regularly in entries up to 1823; in most directories, however, this appointment is omitted. Gee is also included in the list of master cabinet makers attached to Sheraton's Cabinet Dictionary, 1803. The last directory listing for Gee is 1823–24. On 8 November 1804 Thomas Ayliffe Gee was appointed Turner in Ordinary to the King jointly with his father and briefly, in one directory of 1809 the firm is listed as ‘Gee & Sons, Turners & chair makers’. John Gee's name is shown in the Court and City Register until 1831, well after his apparent retirement. Charles Holme Bridges, who succeeded Gee at 49 Wardour St in 1824 received a royal warrant in 1822 but is first entered as a turner in the 1832 Register. Gee's productions have been identified through stamped marks: ‘J GEE’, ‘GEE’, l GEE’, ‘Jn. G’ and a crown, J within G, and ‘GEE WARDOUR ST’ have been noted. Certain chairs are stamped with initials: ‘RR’, ‘GL’, ‘GH’, ‘IT’ and ‘WG’ have been noted. These are probably the marks of individual chairmakers in Gee's employ. His seems to have been a substantial undertaking. The following summary list records chairs by Gee in the order of their emergence: Pride's of London, 1962, 6 chairs, painted trophies on green and brown background, stamped ‘J GEE’. [C.

Son of James Gibbons who was free of the Drapers’ Co., 12 September 1638. The father moved to Holland and Grinling was born in Rotterdam in 1648. James Gibbons returned to England in 1659 and his son probably travelled with him. He is said to have been employed initially as a ship carver and lived at Deptford. It was here that Evelyn claimed to have discovered him working on a copy of ‘The Crucifixion’ of Tintoretto in wood, which so impressed the diarist that he brought him to the attention of Charles II. Evelyn's first contact with Gibbons is recorded as 18 January 1671. An alternative version of the introduction of Gibbons to royal attention named Sir Peter Lely as the agent, the royal portrait painter having seen some carved work executed at the new playhouse in Dorset Gdns known as the Duke's House. It was certainly from the 1670s that his work was increasingly recognised by London society. He was admitted a member of the Drapers’ Co. by patrimony in 1672 and later took office as Renter-Warden, 1704–05; Second Warden, 1712–13; and First Warden, 1714–15. He worked for the Crown at Windsor Castle and was subsequently appointed Master Carver in Wood to the Crown. This post he held from the reign of Charles II through to that of George I. His fame rests mainly on his work as a woodcarver and many commissions for fixed woodwork are known or attributed to him. His workshops also produced a considerable range of work in stone, particularly for Blenheim Palace, some of which is noted in Gunnis. His involvement in furniture making is less well recorded. A walnut and limewood sidetable said to have been made by Gibbons for John Evelyn and included in an inventory of Wotton House, Surrey in 1702 was sold by Christie's in their sale of 17 March 1977. Gibbons's addresses in London are recorded as Belle Sauvage Ct, Ludgate Hill until 1677 and ‘King's Arms’, Bow St, Covent Gdn thereafter. [Gunnis; Heal; D.

In April 1730 he received payment of £4 15s for chairs supplied to the East India Co. for East India House in Leadenhall St. A further £4 was paid by the same Co. in September 1732 for ‘eight chairs’. In 1742 the business was named as Gibson & Grimstead. It is possible that Christopher Gibson may have taken over the business of Joseph Grimstead who is recorded trading at ‘The King's Arms’ in St Paul's Churchyard, 1707–12. The Grimstead who was his partner in 1742 was no doubt related to Joseph Grimstead. An engraver's proof for Gibson's trade card exists giving some idea of an upholsterer's premises of this period. Stock shown includes cane chairs, chairs and a stool with upholstered seats, an angel bed, a mirror, funeral hatchments and numerous bales of cloth. The engraving shows two ware-rooms overlooking a courtyard and a wide flight of steps leading up to the first floor. Gibson's business is last recorded in 1745, and by 1747 the premises at the sign of ‘The King's Arms’ was in the occupation of James Brown, u and cm.

It was also indicated that he intended ‘to give up the Pawn-broking Business entirely.’ In 1775 he insured his house for £400. One commission for Harewood House, Yorks. is recorded. On 13 April 1776 he charged £3 4s for gilding a girandole.

The long period of trading of this business suggests that there must have been two George Gibsons involved. George Gibson snr was the son of James Gibson of the parish of St Andrews, Holborn, Gent. He was app. to Thomas Palmer and Joseph Reed, merchant tailors, 5 January 1770. He was admitted freeman of the Upholders’ Co. by servitude, 2 February 1774, and is first recorded in trade directories in 1789. His trade card [Leverhulme Coll., MMA, NY] describes the business as an ‘Upholstery, Cabinet, Looking Glass and Carpet Warehouse’ and stated that he also undertook the trades of appraiser, auctioneer and undertaker. Insurance records list the address as 54 Ratcliffe Highway but this may be his dwelling house. In 1775 he also used an address near ‘The Dolphin’, Long Alley, Moorfields insured for £200 of which £100 was for utensils, stock and goods. Cover was raised to £300 with £140 for utensils and stock in the following year and for 1779–80 were £500 and £250 respectively. Took as app. George Norris White, 1790–1802.

In 1791 he insured his house only for £400 and in the following year arranged cover for £900 which included his house, utensils and six tenements. In 1801 the sum insured was £600 of which £360 was for utensils and stock. By 1805 cover had been reduced to £540 of which stock and goods in trust accounted for a mere £50.

Took out insurance cover on a house at Southwell for £150 between 1742–49. In 1749 he moved to Mount St, Golden Sq. which was to be his address from this date until the termination of the business. His earliest commission was in connection with the interior design and furnishing of the new Mansion House. In 1752 he supplied ‘eight rich carved frames with glass & branches gilt with Burnish gold’ for the Great Parlour for which £84 was charged and ‘six Brackets richly carved’ for the Vestibule which cost an additional £15. Apart from fixtures ‘one large table’ was supplied for the Great Parlour at £20 8s. The mirrors and brackets are still in place but other furniture no longer survives. For work at the East India House, Leadenhall St he received £86 3s in August 1756 and £86 1s in October of the same year. At this period he was also working for Sir John Hinde Cotton of Madingley Hall, Cambs. and received payments of £60 both on 3 December 1756 and 23 September 1757.\n\nDuring the 1760s and 70s he worked on a number of commissions in houses whose interiors were the design responsibility of Robert Adam. From March 1767 to December 1768 he was engaged on carved work at Berkeley Sq. (Lansdowne House) for Lord Shelburne ‘by order of Messrs. Adams Esq.’ The total account came to £313 4s 3½d and included ‘carving a table frame enriched for hall £3 13s’, ‘making, carving and gilding in burnished gold a large glass frame with ornaments at top and bottom £33’ and ‘making, carving and gilding in burnished gold a circular table frame under ditto, fully enriched £30’. At the same period he was working at Croome Court, Worcs. and Mersham-le-Hatch, Kent. At Osterley, Middlx, he was engaged on carving work for Robert Child as early as 1773 and in that year received £32 15s in payment. In May of the following year he submitted an account for two pedestals for the Entrance Hall ‘Inriched with Oak Leaves and Rafled Leaves &c.’ charged at £17 11s. These are still in the possession of the Earl of Jersey's family. The last Osterley commission known was the carving in 1784 of four elm pineapples for the top of the corner turrets which cost £24. The only commission unconnected with Adam houses in this phase yet noted was the carving of a looking-glass frame for Charles Rogers of Laurence Poultney Lane, London at a cost of £4 8s. This was paid for on 8 June 1768.

His customers were said to be mainly ‘women of the town, many of whom bought his furniture in weekly instalments of a guinea or half a guinea.’ When in prison Gilchrist tried to persuade his app. to smuggle tools into this building in the hope that he could, with Stephenson's assistance, continue production. This was frustrated by the app.'s successive appeals for his discharge.

Further chairs, a tea box and repairs and alterations between August 1752 and June of the following year amounted to £32 6s 7d and in 1754 a large mahogany dining table and stools etc. were charged at £9 19s 6d. Another member of the same family to patronise this maker was Henry Hoare of Stourhead, Wilts. Between April 1753 and June 1756 he paid a number of sums for furniture. These included settlement for five Chinese chairs at £1 10s each on 11 April 1753, and the large sum of £176 1s on 16 March 1754 for chairs and furniture. Edmund Gilding died on 12 August 1757 at his house in Red Cross St. [V & A Lib., 86. NN. 3; Wilts. RO, MS 383.6; London Chronicle, 16 August 1757]\n\nGilding, Francis, 113 Aldersgate St, London, cm and u (1759– 96). Son of Edmund Gilding of Red Cross St to whose business he succeeded. The manufactory he operated was substantial. In 1759 he took out a licence to employ thirty non-freemen for six weeks, and in 1778 and 79 took out further licences to employ fifty non-freemen for periods of up to three months. Apart from the Aldersgate premises he had other workshops. On 29 May 1790 he took out insurance cover for £6,000 on premises at Newcastle House, Clerkenwell Close, £5,000 of which was in respect of stock. On 18 June 1791 warehouses and workshops in Long Lane, Smithfield, were insured for £2,000. A number of Gilding's apps are known. In 1767 he took as app. Alexander Boote, son of John Boote of Ardington Berks., Gent. and received the substantial premium of £84. James Bagley, son of William Bagley of Arton, Cheshire, was app. in the same year, paying £63. On 5 May 1772 he took as app. Francis Banner, son of John Banner, freeman plumber of London. Francis Banner lived with Gilding in his house and subsequently became his partner. The only other app. known is Thomas Handiside who was accepted on 4 December 1792 on payment of a premium of £102. Francis Gilding subscribed to Thomas Malton's Treatise on Perspective, 1778, and is recorded in 1790–91 as a Fellow of the Society for Arts and Manufactures. His partnership with Francis Banner is first recorded in 1786 but the last years of the business were marked by crisis. In December 1790 was reported a terrible fire at his warehouse and in 1795 he was declared bankrupt. It is significant that Francis Banner was not named in the bankrupty proceedings which may suggest that the partnership had been dissolved before these commenced.\n\nTwo of Francis Gilding's customers are known. On 5 October 1768 he charged Charles Turner, Esq. of Stretton Hall, Staffs., £2 6s for a mahogany dining table. A more significant commission was that of Lord Howard of Audley End, Essex, who received an account in August 1786 for goods supplied from 22 October of the previous year amounting to £21 10s 6d. The main items were a ‘Square back Bergere Elbow Chair’ charged at £3 13s 6d, ‘a Solid Mahogany Eliptic Side board’ at £4 4s and ‘a Neat Elbow Chair’ and four stools en suite which together cost £12 1s 6d.
