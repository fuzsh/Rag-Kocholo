Educated at Harrow School and Balliol College, Oxford, Butler entered the Indian Civil Services soon afterwards, in 1890. He served as governor of United Provinces from 3 January 1921 to 21 December 1922. Butler later went on to serve as Governor of Burma from 2 January 1923 to 20 December 1927; he had already been lieutenant-governor of Burma from 28 October 1915 to 22 September 1917, and held the title briefly again from 21 December 1922 to 2 January 1923. On that date, the position became that of \"Governor\".\n\nThe Government of India in 1910 appointed Butler as the first Member for Education with a seat on the Viceroy's Executive Council. He was also the first president of Delhi Gymkhana, founded in 1913.\n\nButler was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Star of India (CSI) in 1909, knighted as a Knight Commander (KCSI) of the same order in 1911, and promoted to Knight Grand Commander (GCSI) of the order in 1928. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in November 1901, and was promoted to a Knight Grand Commander (GCIE) of the same order in 1923.\n\nThe Harcourt Butler Technological Institute, Kanpur was established in 1921. It was named after him. The Institute was granted university status in September 2016. Harcourt Butler Higher Secondary School (now known as Harcourt Butler Senior Secondary School), New Delhi, was named after him in 1917. It was earlier called Bengali Boys School.\n\nButler helped the opening of the University of Medicine 1, Yangon, on 2 February 1927. From 1927 to 1929 he chaired the Butler Committee on the governance of the British Raj in relation to the princely states. He passed away in 1938.\n\nSources\n\nWikipedia biography [1]"
