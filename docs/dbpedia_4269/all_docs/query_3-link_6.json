        "text": "Richard Austen Butler, Baron Butler of Saffron Walden, KG CH DL PC (9 December 1902 – 8 March 1982),usually signed his name R. A. Butler and was known as Rab as a result.\n\nBritish Conservative politician, one of only two British politicians (the other being John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon) to have served in three of the four Great Offices of State (Chancellor of the Exchequer, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary) but never to have achieved the Premiership, for which he was twice passed over.\n\nBorn in Attock Serai, Attock in India (now in Punjab, Pakistan) to Sir Montagu Sherard Dawes Butler and Anne Gertrude (née Smith).\n\nHis maternal uncles were Charles Aitchison Smith, Sir George Adam Smith and Sir James Dunlop Smith. His father later remarried resulting in a half-sister, Iris Mary Butler, who became Iris Portal upon her marriage.\n\nButler's was a family of Cambridge dons and Indian Governors; as a child his right arm was injured in a riding accident, leaving his hand not fully functional. His limp handshake and inevitable lack of military experience (and stooping donnish manner at a time when many politicians were former officers) were political handicaps in later life.\n\nEducated at Marlborough College and Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he was President of the Cambridge Union Society in the summer term of his third year; in March 1924, as a newly-elected President, he entertained the Opposition Leader Stanley Baldwin at a debate.\n\nWhile at Cambridge he read French (in which he obtained a First), German and, in his fourth year, History and International Relations, in which he obtained one of the highest Firsts in the University. He specialised in the study of Sir Robert Peel, a man whose actions had split the Conservative Party and who may have greatly influenced Butler's later political trajectory. Butler also took part in the ESU USA Tour, the debating tour of the United States run by the English-Speaking Union.\n\nAfter a brief period as a Cambridge don, teaching nineteenth century French history, he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Saffron Walden in the 1929 general election. Butler held this seat until his retirement in 1965.\n\nIn his autobiography \"The Art of the Possible\", Butler attributes his political gifts to his grandmother Mary Kendall of Pelyn, Lostwithiel, Cornwall. He wrote a lengthy paragraph on the Kendall family who for many generations past had been active in the politics of Cornwall and England.\n\nButler held a series of junior Ministerial posts throughout the 1930s, often enacting controversial policy decisions. After a brief period as Parliamentary Private Secretary (i.e. personal assistant) to the India Secretary Samuel Hoare, he was given his first ministerial job as Under-Secretary of State for India (1932–37) at the time the Indian Home Rule Act was being debated in Parliament amidst massive opposition, led by Winston Churchill, from rank-and-file Conservative supporters. In 1937-8 he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour.\n\nSubsequently he was (appointed 1938) Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in Neville Chamberlain's government. Butler's close association to the government's policy of appeasement of Nazi Germany may have been instrumental in limiting his political career. Butler himself would later claim that appeasement had been aimed at buying time for Britain to rearm and that he had little input into the direction of foreign policy and that power was really held by Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, with the Prime Minister speaking in the House of Commons for the major aspects of government foreign policy instead of Butler, who was the sole Foreign Office minister in the Commons (an arrangement devised to respond to criticism of appointing a peer as Foreign Secretary rather than a reflection on Butler).\n\nButler disliked Churchill. After Churchill had made a confident war speech on 12 November 1939, Butler told Jock Colville that he \"thought it beyond words vulgar\". Colville recorded in his diary on 10 May 1940, when Churchill was replacing Chamberlain as Prime Minister:\n\nRab said he thought that the good clean tradition of English politics, that of Pitt as opposed to Fox, had been sold to the greatest adventurer of modern political history. He had tried earnestly and long to persuade Halifax to accept the Premiership, but he had failed. He believed this sudden coup of Winston and his rabble was a serious disaster and an unnecessary one: the 'pass has been sold' by Mr. C., Lord Halifax and Oliver Stanley. They had weakly surrendered to a half-breed American whose main support was that of inefficient but talkative people of a similar type.[5][6]\n\nDavid Lloyd George intended a compliment when describing Butler as \"playing the part of the imperturbable dunce who says nothing with an air of conviction\".\n\nHe married Sydney Elizabeth Courtauld in 1926. She was the daughter of Samuel Courtauld, and heiress to part of the Courtauld textile fortune. They lived at Stanstead Hall (aka Stansted Hall) in Essex. Their children were\n\nThe Hon Sir Richard C Butler KT DL (1929–2012),\n\nAdam Courtauld Butler (1931–2008), who was also a politician,\n\nHon Samuel James Butler (1936-) and\n\nSarah Teresa Butler (1944-).\n\nFollowing the death of Sydney from jaw cancer in 1954, Rab Butler married Mollie Courtauld (née Montgomerie) in September 1959. Mollie had been previously married to Augustine Courtauld (Sydney's cousin), who had died in March 1959. Mollie and Rab lived very happily at their London Houses in Lord North Street and Smith Square, the Master's Lodge at Trinity College Cambridge, Gatcombe Park in Gloucestershire (inherited by Rab from Samuel Courtauld, Sydney's father) and a holiday house on the Isle of Mull.\n\nIn 1976, Gatcombe Park was sold to the Queen as a home for Princess Anne (HRH The Princess Royal), and Mollie and Rab bought back Spencers, the old Courtauld family home in Essex where Mollie had previously resided with Augustine Courtauld. Mollie continued living at Spencers after Rab's death in 1982 and up until her own death on February 18, 2009 at the age of 101.\n\nSpencers came onto the market in February 2010, one year on from the death of Lady Butler.\n\nIn summer 1941, Butler received his first cabinet-level post when he was appointed President of the Board of Education by Winston Churchill. He was also the chair of the War Cabinet Committee for the Control of Official Histories. The position was widely seen as a backwater in wartime, with Butler having been promoted to it to remove him from the more sensitive Foreign Office. He proved to be one of the most radical reforming ministers on the home front, shaking up the education system in the Education Act 1944, which is often known as the Butler Education Act. At the end of World War II, Butler briefly served as Minister of Labour for two months in the \"Caretaker\" administration of Winston Churchill.\n\nButler had been designated to be one of the regional representatives of King George VI, as part of the secret plan of resistance had Britain been occupied by the Nazi forces.\n\nAfter the Conservatives were defeated in the 1945 general election, Butler emerged as one of the most prominent figures during the rebuilding of the party. He served a record term as Chairman of the Conservative Research Department from 1945 to 1964. When the Conservative party returned to power in 1951, he was appointed to the senior post of Chancellor of the Exchequer. Butler followed to a large extent the economic policies of his Labour predecessor, Hugh Gaitskell, pursuing a mixed economy and Keynesian economics as part of the post-war political consensus. The Economist commented on these similarities by referring to a hybrid Chancellor, \"Mr Butskell\", from which the term Butskellism derives.\n\nButler planned to move to system of free-floating the pound (\"Operation ROBOT\"), but it was scuppered by Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden who feared that the inflation and the unemployment would make the move political suicide.\n\nIn 1953, Butler acted as head of the Government when Winston Churchill suffered a stroke, whilst his successor Anthony Eden was undergoing an operation overseas. Churchill slowly recovered and retired in 1955, handing power to Eden with no controversy.\n\nButler's career did not prosper under Eden. He described Eden as \"half mad Baronet, half beautiful woman\" and once agreed with a journalist that Eden was \"the best Prime Minister we have\".\n\nAlthough Butler continued to act as a deputy for Eden on a number of occasions, he was not officially recognised as such. He chaired the Cabinet in Eden's absence.\n\nIn January 1957, Eden resigned as Prime Minister. At the time the Conservative Party had no formal mechanism for determining a new leader, so The Queen had the ultimate choice as to who should succeed Eden as Prime Minister. The Queen took advice from senior Ministers, as well as Churchill (who backed Macmillan), Edward Heath and Lord Salisbury. The advice was overwhelmingly to appoint Macmillan as Prime Minister instead of Butler. Butler himself later confessed in his memoirs that while there was a sizeable anti-Butler faction on the backbenches, there was no such anti-Macmillan faction.\n\nMacmillan sought to placate Butler by appointing him as Home Secretary. He had wanted Foreign Secretary. In his memoirs, Macmillan claimed that Butler \"chose\" the Home Office, an assertion of which Butler drily observed in his own memoirs that Macmillan's memory \"played him false\".\n\nButler held the Home Office for five years, in which he demonstrated his radical reforming credentials through a number of pieces of legislation, but his liberal views on hanging and flogging did little to endear him to rank-and-file Conservative members. Butler also held various additional posts on different occasions throughout this period, including Leader of the House of Commons, Lord Privy Seal, and Conservative Party Chairman, the latter job prompting a newspaper analogy with Nikita Khrushchev's rise to power through control of the Soviet Communist Party.\n\nIn the \"Night of the Long Knives\" reshuffle in 1962, Butler became Deputy Prime Minister and First Secretary of State. Macmillan used the occasion to promote younger men such as Reginald Maudling (Chancellor of the Exchequer) and Edward Heath (in charge of the EEC entry negotiations), from amongst whom he hoped to groom his successor.\n\nThe following year, Macmillan was taken ill on the eve of the Conservative Party Conference and resigned as Prime Minister, asking the party bigwigs to \"take soundings\" of Cabinet Ministers and MPs to select a consensus candidate as the leader through the \"customary processes\".\n\nIn the confusion of the next few days, Butler found himself sidelined after delivering a poor Conference speech. In the end, Macmillan recommended Home for the premiership.[\n\nHome appointed Butler as Foreign Secretary, in which post he served until his party lost office at the 1964 general election.\n\nAt the age of 62, Butler left office for the last time with one of the longest records of ministerial experience amongst contemporary politicians. Butler remained on the Conservative front bench for the next year, when he was appointed Master of Trinity College Cambridge. The same year, he was awarded a life peerage as Baron Butler of Saffron Walden. He then sat as a cross-bench peer in the House of Lords. He had declined offers of an hereditary earldom, both by Alec Douglas-Home in his resignation honours list and by Harold Wilson.\n\nAt the time of his retirement from Parliament he was the longest continuously serving member of the Commons and Father of the House. As Master of Trinity, Butler was publicly promoted as a mentor and counsellor to Charles, Prince of Wales when he was enrolled in university; a humorous cartoon of the time showed Butler telling the Prince that he was to study a specially made-up History course \"in which I become Prime Minister\". Butler also actively served as the first Chancellor of the University of Essex from 1966 until his death in 1982 at Great Yeldham, Essex. He is buried in the churchyard of the parish church of St Mary the Virgin in Saffron Walden.\n\nButler's son Adam served as a Member of Parliament from 1970 to 1987 and as a junior minister under Margaret Thatcher.\n\nStyles and honours\n\nMr Richard Butler (1902–1929)\n\nMr Richard Butler MP (1929–1939)\n\nThe Rt. Hon. Richard Butler MP (1939–1954)\n\nThe Rt. Hon. Richard Butler CH MP (1954–1965)\n\nThe Rt. Hon. The Lord Butler of Saffron Walden CH PC (1965–1971)\n\nThe Rt. Hon. The Lord Butler of Saffron Walden KG CH PC (1971–1982)\n\nLord Butler of Saffron Walden was twice offered an hereditary earldom and would have been styled as the Earl of Saffron Walden if he had accepted such an offer. Instead, he chose to accept a life peerage for reasons which remain unknown.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rab_Butler\n\nThe best Prime Minister we never had!\n\nRab Butler was responsible for the 1944 Education Act that created the pattern for post-war secondary schooling in Britain. He was a key figure in the Conservative Party in the 1950s.\n\nRichard Austen Butler - who was always known as 'Rab' - was born on 9 December 1902 in India. He was educated at Cambridge University and in 1923 became Conservative member of parliament for Saffron Walden. He held a number of junior ministerial positions in the 1930s. In February 1938, he became under-secretary of state for foreign affairs, and in this position he was a resolute supporter of the prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, and his policy of appeasement.\n\nIn 1941, however, Butler became president of the board of education in Winston Churchill's wartime coalition. Here he oversaw the Education Act that popularly bears his name - the act that introduced free secondary education for the first time in the UK. It was the only significant piece of legislation relating to post-war social reform that was passed by the coalition government. After the Conservative Party's defeat in 1945, Butler used his position as head of the party's research department to promote moderate policies that accepted many of the Clement Attlee government's social reform and public ownership measures.\n\nWhen the Conservatives returned to power in 1951, Butler became chancellor of the exchequer. While Butler worked within the mixed economy and welfare state inherited from Labour, he was not averse to reshaping them along more traditionally Conservative lines. As a result, Labour's progressive taxation policy was revised, welfare benefits were made less universal, and in 1952 Butler briefly contemplated floating the pound on the foreign exchanges. From 1957-1962 Butler was home secretary, and he also served as foreign secretary in 1963-4. However, he twice failed to become Conservative party leader, losing out to Macmillan (1957) and Alec Douglas-Home (1963). This was partly because his consensual Toryism was viewed with suspicion by some party members, but also because he lacked the ultimate ambition and ruthlessness to seize the opportunity presented to him. Butler became a life peer in 1965 and died on 8 March 1982.\n\nRichard Austen Butler, Baron Butler of Saffron Walden, KG, CH, DL, PC, generally known as R. A. Butler and familiarly known as Rab, was a British Conservative politician.In 1965, Butler retired from politics, and was granted a life peerage as Baron Butler of Saffron Walden. In 1965 he became Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, and he and Mollie were popular occupants of the Master's Lodge until his retirement in 1978. The Butlers were supportive and loyal to staff and sympathetic and generous hosts to students and academics alike. Both of them kept a kindly eye on Prince Charles during his time at Trinity, between 1969 and 1971, and Butler's KG in 1971 was a public recognition of this fact. The Prince subsequently placed on record his thanks to the Butlers for their unfailing help, kindness and abundant hospitality. Lord Butler died in 1982 but even after his death, the Queen continued to invite Mollie back to the annual Garter Day luncheons at Windsor Castle.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rab_Butler\n\nRichard Austen Butler, Baron Butler of Saffron Walden, KG CH DL PC (9 December 1902 – 8 March 1982), who invariably signed his name R. A. Butler and was familiarly known as Rab, was a British Conservative politician. Butler was one of only two British politicians (the other being John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon) to have served in three of the four Great Offices of State (Chancellor of the Exchequer, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary) but never to have achieved the Premiership, for which he was twice passed over.\n\nEarly life\n\nButler was born in Attock Serai, Attock in India (now Punjab, Pakistan) to Sir Montagu Sherard Dawes Butler and his wife, Anne Gertrude (née Smith). His maternal uncles were Charles Aitchison Smith, Sir George Adam Smith and Sir James Dunlop Smith. His father later remarried and thus he gained a half-sister, Iris Mary Butler, who became Iris Portal upon her marriage.\n\nButler's was a family of Cambridge dons and Indian Governors; as a child his right arm was injured in a riding accident, leaving his hand never again fully functional. His limp handshake and inevitable lack of military experience (and stooping donnish manner at a time when many politicians were former officers) were political handicaps in later life. He was educated at Marlborough College and Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he was President of the Cambridge Union Society in the summer term of his third year; in March 1924, as a newly-elected President, he entertained the Opposition Leader Stanley Baldwin at a debate.\n\nWhile at Cambridge he read French (in which he obtained a First), German and, in his fourth year, History and International Relations, in which he obtained one of the highest Firsts in the University. He specialised in the study of Sir Robert Peel, a man whose actions had split the Conservative Party and who may have greatly influenced Butler's later political trajectory. Butler also took part in the ESU USA Tour, the debating tour of the United States run by the English-Speaking Union.\n\nAfter a brief period as a Cambridge don, teaching nineteenth century French history, he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Saffron Walden in the 1929 general election. Butler held this seat until his retirement in 1965.\n\nMember of Parliament\n\nIn his autobiography \"The Art of the Possible\", Butler attributes his political gifts to his grandmother Mary Kendall of Pelyn, Lostwithiel, Cornwall. He wrote a lengthy paragraph on the Kendall family who for many generations past had been active in the politics of Cornwall and England. It has been remarked of this family, that they have perhaps sent more members to the British Senate than any other in the United Kingdom.\n\nButler held a series of junior Ministerial posts throughout the 1930s, often enacting controversial policy decisions. After a brief period as Parliamentary Private Secretary (i.e. personal assistant) to the India Secretary Samuel Hoare, he was given his first ministerial job as Under-Secretary of State for India (1932–37) at the time the Indian Home Rule Act was being debated in Parliament amidst massive opposition, led by Winston Churchill, from rank-and-file Conservative supporters. In 1937-8 he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour.\n\nSubsequently he was (appointed 1938) Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in Neville Chamberlain's government. Butler's close association to the government's policy of appeasement of Nazi Germany may have been instrumental in limiting his political career. Butler himself would later claim that appeasement had been aimed at buying time for Britain to rearm and that he had little input into the direction of foreign policy and that power was really held by Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, with the Prime Minister speaking in the House of Commons for the major aspects of government foreign policy instead of Butler, who was the sole Foreign Office minister in the Commons (an arrangement devised to respond to criticism of appointing a peer as Foreign Secretary rather than a reflection on Butler).\n\nButler disliked Churchill. After Churchill had made a confident war speech on 12 November 1939, Butler told Jock Colville that he \"thought it beyond words vulgar\".[4] Colville recorded in his diary on 10 May 1940, when Churchill was replacing Chamberlain as Prime Minister:\n\nRab said he thought that the good clean tradition of English politics, that of Pitt as opposed to Fox, had been sold to the greatest adventurer of modern political history. He had tried earnestly and long to persuade Halifax to accept the Premiership, but he had failed. He believed this sudden coup of Winston and his rabble was a serious disaster and an unnecessary one: the 'pass has been sold' by Mr. C., Lord Halifax and Oliver Stanley. They had weakly surrendered to a half-breed American whose main support was that of inefficient but talkative people of a similar type.\n\nDavid Lloyd George intended a compliment when describing Butler as \"playing the part of the imperturbable dunce who says nothing with an air of conviction\".\n\nPrivate and family life\n\nRab married Sydney Elizabeth Courtauld in 1926. She was the daughter of Samuel Courtauld, and heiress to part of the Courtauld textile fortune. They lived at Stanstead Hall (aka Stansted Hall) in Essex. Their children were The Hon Sir Richard C Butler KT DL (1929-2012), Adam Courtauld Butler (1931-2008), who was also a politician, Hon Samuel James Butler (1936-) and Sarah Teresa Butler (1944-).\n\nFollowing the death of Sydney from a very painful jaw cancer in 1954, Rab Butler married Mollie Courtauld (née Montgomerie) in September 1959. Mollie had been previously married to Augustine Courtauld (Sydney's cousin), who had died in March 1959. Mollie and Rab lived very happily at their London Houses in Lord North Street and Smith Square, the Master's Lodge at Trinity College Cambridge, Gatcombe Park in Gloucestershire (inherited by Rab from Samuel Courtauld, Sydney's father) and a holiday house on the Isle of Mull.\n\nIn 1976, Gatcombe Park was sold to the Queen as a home for Princess Anne (HRH The Princess Royal), and Mollie and Rab bought back Spencers, the old Courtauld family home in Essex where Mollie had previously resided with Augustine Courtauld. Mollie continued living at Spencers after Rab's death in 1982 and up until her own death on February 18, 2009 at the age of 101.\n\nSpencers came onto the market in February 2010, one year on from the death of Lady Butler.\n\n1944 Education Act\n\nIn summer 1941, Butler received his first cabinet-level post when he was appointed President of the Board of Education by Winston Churchill. He was also the chair of the War Cabinet Committee for the Control of Official Histories. The position was widely seen as a backwater in wartime, with Butler having been promoted to it to remove him from the more sensitive Foreign Office. Still,he proved to be one of the most radical reforming ministers on the home front, shaking up the education system in the Education Act 1944, which is often known as the Butler Education Act. At the end of World War II, Butler briefly served as Minister of Labour for two months in the \"Caretaker\" administration of Winston Churchill.\n\nResistance plans\n\nButler had been designated to be one of the regional representatives of King George VI, as part of the secret plan of resistance had Britain been occupied by the Nazi forces. Little even today is known about this proposed plan. 201, 202 and 203 Battalions of the British Home Guard would have been the foundation of this British resistance.\n\nPost-war\n\nAfter the Conservatives were defeated in the 1945 general election, Butler emerged as one of the most prominent figures during the rebuilding of the party. He served a record term as Chairman of the Conservative Research Department from 1945 to 1964. When the Conservative party returned to power in 1951, he was appointed to the senior post of Chancellor of the Exchequer. Butler followed to a large extent the economic policies of his Labour predecessor, Hugh Gaitskell, pursuing a mixed economy and Keynesian economics as part of the post-war political consensus. The Economist commented on these similarities by referring to a hybrid Chancellor, \"Mr Butskell\", from which the term Butskellism derives.\n\nButler planned to move to system of free-floating the pound (\"Operation ROBOT\"), but it was scuppered by Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden in a rare intervention of his in domestic politics. Eden feared that the inflation and the unemployment would make the move political suicide.\n\nIn 1953, Butler acted as head of the Government when Winston Churchill suffered a stroke, whilst his successor Anthony Eden was undergoing an operation overseas. Many have speculated that Butler could have become Prime Minister had he persuaded Churchill to retire at this point, but Butler lacked the ruthlessness that would have been necessary to accomplish this. He may have been concerned about opposition to a \"Man of Munich\" becoming Prime Minister. Churchill slowly recovered and retired in 1955, handing power to Eden with no controversy.\n\nButler's career did not prosper under Eden, about whom a number of Butler's sardonic witticisms surfaced. He described Eden as \"half mad Baronet, half beautiful woman\" and once agreed with a journalist that Eden was \"the best Prime Minister we have\". His penultimate budget slashed taxation immediately before the 1955 general election but soon afterwards it became apparent that the economy was \"overheating\" (inflation and the balance of payments deficit were rising sharply), and his final budget undid several of the tax cuts, leading to charges of electoral opportunism. In December 1955, Butler was moved to the post of Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Commons.\n\nAlthough Butler continued to act as a deputy for Eden on a number of occasions, he was not officially recognised as such and his successor as Chancellor, Harold Macmillan, was assured by Eden that Butler was not senior to him.\n\nStill, this Butler chaired the Cabinet in Eden's absence. However, Butler's stock stumbled during the Suez Crisis, particularly during Eden's absence in Jamaica, during which time Butler was seen to give weak leadership.\n\nButler and Macmillan\n\nIn January 1957, Eden resigned as Prime Minister. At the time the Conservative Party had no formal mechanism for determining a new leader, so The Queen had the ultimate choice as to who should succeed Eden as Prime Minister. The Queen took advice from senior Ministers, as well as Churchill (who backed Macmillan), Edward Heath (who as Chief Whip was aware of backbench opinion) and from Lord Salisbury, who interviewed the Cabinet one by one and with his famous speech impediment asked each one whether he was for \"Wab or Hawold\" (it is thought that only between one and three were for \"Wab\"). The advice was overwhelmingly to appoint Macmillan as Prime Minister instead of Butler. The media were taken by surprise by this choice, but Butler himself later confessed in his memoirs that while there was a sizeable anti-Butler faction on the backbenches, there was no such anti-Macmillan faction.\n\nMacmillan sought to placate Butler by appointing him to a senior position, albeit as Home Secretary rather than Foreign Secretary, the job he wanted. In his memoirs, Macmillan claimed that Butler \"chose\" the Home Office, an assertion of which Butler drily observed in his own memoirs that Macmillan's memory \"played him false\". Butler held the Home Office for five years, in which he once more demonstrated his radical reforming credentials through a number of pieces of legislation, but his liberal views on hanging and flogging did little to endear him to rank-and-file Conservative members. Butler also held various additional posts on different occasions throughout this period, including Leader of the House of Commons, Lord Privy Seal, and Conservative Party Chairman, the latter job prompting a newspaper analogy with Nikita Khrushchev's rise to power through control of the Soviet Communist Party.\n\nThe succession to Macmillan\n\nIn the \"Night of the Long Knives\" reshuffle in 1962, Butler at last received the formal titles of Deputy Prime Minister and First Secretary of State. However, Macmillan used the occasion to promote younger men such as Reginald Maudling (Chancellor of the Exchequer) and Edward Heath (in charge of the EEC entry negotiations), from amongst whom he hoped to groom his successor. The following year, Macmillan was taken ill on the eve of the Conservative Party Conference and resigned as Prime Minister, asking the party bigwigs to \"take soundings\" of Cabinet Ministers and MPs to select a consensus candidate as the leader through the \"customary processes\".\n\nIn the confusion of the next few days, Butler found himself sidelined after delivering a poor Conference speech. Lord Hailsham was rejected after using the Conference to campaign openly for the job in a manner considered vulgar at the time. Support gathered around outside candidate Lord Home. Much ink has been spilled on how badly the consultation process was rigged, but in the end, Macmillan recommended Home for the premiership.\n\nMany were outraged over the way that Butler had been passed over yet again. Hailsham and Maudling were dissatisfied by the choice but agreed to serve under Home. Enoch Powell and Iain Macleod (who later claimed in print that the leadership had been stitched up by a \"Magic Circle\" of old Etonians) both refused to serve under Home and sought to persuade Butler to do the same in the belief that this would make a Home premiership impossible and result in Butler taking office. However, Butler refused to join Powell and Macleod; he even alleged in a letter to The Times that to have done so might have led to a Labour government (this suggestion was later dismissed as absurd by Harold Wilson, then Opposition leader).\n\nSome have attributed Butler's actions to his university study of Conservatives, and to his resultant fear of splitting the Tory party. Powell, a former brigadier, observed that they had given Butler a loaded revolver which he had refused to use on the grounds that it might make a noise, a metaphor which speaks volumes about how Butler's lack of military experience affected his colleagues' image of him.\n\nIt is worth observing that despite Butler's immense experience, he was not an overwhelming choice as leader. In leadership elections a generation later, it has often been the case that the initial frontrunner (David Davis in 2005) or the \"obvious\" and publicly popular candidate (Michael Heseltine in 1990 or Kenneth Clarke in 1997 and in 2001) loses at the final hurdle to a \"second-best\" candidate who enjoys a wider consensus of support in his own party. Anyway, there is no doubt that the episode of Home's elevation was a public relations disaster for the Conservatives, who had to elect their next leader (Edward Heath in 1965) by a transparent ballot of MPs.\n\nHome appointed Butler as Foreign Secretary, and it was in this post he served until his party narrowly lost office at the 1964 general election. Many believed that the Conservatives would have won under Butler's leadership, but during the election campaign, he had shown his lack of stomach for the fight by remarking to a journalist that the campaign was \"slipping away\". Harold Wilson said that Butler would have won the 1964 General Election.\n\nRetirement from politics\n\nAt the comparatively early age of 62, Butler left office for the last time with one of the longest records of ministerial experience amongst contemporary politicians. Butler remained on the Conservative front bench for the next year, when he was appointed Master of Trinity College Cambridge. The same year, he was awarded a life peerage as Baron Butler of Saffron Walden. He would then sit as a cross-bench peer in the House of Lords. He had declined offers of an hereditary earldom, both by Alec Douglas-Home in his resignation honours list and by Harold Wilson.\n\nAt the time of his retirement from Parliament he was the longest continuously serving member of the Commons and Father of the House. As Master of Trinity, Butler was publicly promoted as a mentor and counsellor to Charles, Prince of Wales when he was enrolled in university; a humorous cartoon of the time showed Butler telling the Prince that he was to study a specially made-up History course \"in which I become Prime Minister\". Butler also actively served as the first Chancellor of the University of Essex from 1966 until his death in 1982 at Great Yeldham, Essex. He is buried in the churchyard of the parish church of St Mary the Virgin in Saffron Walden.\n\nButler's son Adam served as a Member of Parliament from 1970 to 1987 and as a junior minister under Margaret Thatcher.\n\nIn fiction\n\nIn the alternate reality depicted in John Wyndham's short story Random Quest, where the Second World War did not happen, Rab Butler is the prime minister. The story was written in 1954, when the latter was a serious possibility.\n\nButler also becomes World War II prime minister in the 2007 alternate history novel Resistance by Owen Sheers. However, he leads a collaborationist puppet government after Germany has largely conquered the British Isles.\n\nSimilarly, Butler, along with Lord Halifax, engineers a June 1940 British surrender to Germany (and ultimate occupation) in the background to the alternate history novel The Big One, ultimately leading to his assassination by resistance forces."
