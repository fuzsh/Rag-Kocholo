        "text": "<strong>List</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>British</strong> <strong>Consular</strong> <strong>Officials</strong> <strong>in</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>Ottoman</strong> Empire and its former territories, from <strong>the</strong> sixteenth century to about 1860 July 2011 Introduction The follow<strong>in</strong>g list has grown from a set <strong>of</strong> rough notes compiled by David Wilson while he was help<strong>in</strong>g to catalogue <strong>the</strong> papers <strong>of</strong> Sir John Elijah Blunt at <strong>the</strong> University <strong>of</strong> Birm<strong>in</strong>gham. The orig<strong>in</strong>al aim was simply to identify people mentioned <strong>in</strong> those papers, but it soon became obvious that <strong>the</strong>y were connected by a complicated network <strong>of</strong> family relationships extend<strong>in</strong>g over several generations. A more detailed account <strong>of</strong> those most closely connected with <strong>the</strong> Blunt family is be<strong>in</strong>g prepared separately, but it is hoped this draft list may be useful for people research<strong>in</strong>g o<strong>the</strong>r families or particular consulates, s<strong>in</strong>ce <strong>the</strong>re does not appear to be a s<strong>in</strong>gle reliable source <strong>of</strong> <strong>in</strong>formation with such a wide coverage. In prepar<strong>in</strong>g this list, it was found that many <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> sources are unreliable, <strong>in</strong>complete or contradictory; this led to <strong>the</strong> adoption <strong>of</strong> a format which tries to show clearly where each piece <strong>of</strong> <strong>in</strong>formation came from. This does produce a ra<strong>the</strong>r cluttered effect, with a lot <strong>of</strong> brackets, but it makes it simple to remove redundant material or <strong>in</strong>sert new as <strong>the</strong> project develops. Quite a lot <strong>of</strong> material from earlier drafts has already been removed as <strong>the</strong> picture became clearer. The aim has been to <strong>in</strong>clude all appo<strong>in</strong>tments from <strong>the</strong> foundation <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> Levant Company <strong>in</strong> 1581 up to 1 Jan 1860, although some later appo<strong>in</strong>tments are also listed. The end po<strong>in</strong>t was chosen as be<strong>in</strong>g a time after <strong>the</strong> Crimean War when <strong>the</strong> Levant <strong>Consular</strong> Service had more or less settled down after <strong>the</strong> various upheavals that followed <strong>the</strong> transfer from <strong>the</strong> Levant Company to <strong>the</strong> Foreign Office. Many <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> references given here are to documents <strong>in</strong> The National Archives or o<strong>the</strong>r collections which have not been seen personally by <strong>the</strong> compiler and are only known from <strong>in</strong>formation <strong>in</strong> catalogues or references <strong>in</strong> o<strong>the</strong>r publications. From <strong>the</strong> few which he has seen personally, it is obvious that <strong>the</strong>re is much more detail to be found, for example <strong>in</strong> <strong>the</strong> orig<strong>in</strong>al papers <strong>of</strong> Levant Company, and close exam<strong>in</strong>ation <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong>se should remove many <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> uncerta<strong>in</strong>ties <strong>in</strong> <strong>the</strong> present list. For <strong>the</strong> period before 1825, pr<strong>in</strong>ted lists <strong>of</strong> consuls occasionally appeared <strong>in</strong> various almanacs and similar publications. As <strong>the</strong>se obviously copied each o<strong>the</strong>r, <strong>the</strong> orig<strong>in</strong>al source <strong>of</strong> each list is difficult to identify and by <strong>the</strong> time it appeared <strong>in</strong> any particular publication it might well be considerably out <strong>of</strong> date. Ano<strong>the</strong>r po<strong>in</strong>t to be remembered is that with <strong>the</strong> difficulties <strong>of</strong> travel and communication at that time, <strong>the</strong>re might be considerable delays between a consul be<strong>in</strong>g appo<strong>in</strong>ted and tak<strong>in</strong>g up his post – and between one dy<strong>in</strong>g and <strong>the</strong> appo<strong>in</strong>tment <strong>of</strong> a successor. Also, some ‘appo<strong>in</strong>tments’ appear to have been re-appo<strong>in</strong>tments, such as those made after <strong>the</strong> accession <strong>of</strong> George III or after <strong>the</strong> handover from <strong>the</strong> Levant Company to <strong>the</strong> Foreign Office. While bear<strong>in</strong>g this <strong>in</strong> m<strong>in</strong>d, attempts were made to ascerta<strong>in</strong> <strong>the</strong> date when each consul was appo<strong>in</strong>ted and when he f<strong>in</strong>ally left a post – by transfer, retirement, or death. However <strong>in</strong> many cases it was only possible to f<strong>in</strong>d references to him be<strong>in</strong>g <strong>in</strong> post <strong>in</strong> a particular year, and this is where more work is needed. In 1825, at <strong>the</strong> time <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> w<strong>in</strong>d<strong>in</strong>g-up <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> Levant Company, a list <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> Company’s <strong>of</strong>ficers was pr<strong>in</strong>ted (FO 881/2353). Although this <strong>in</strong>cludes some early vice-consuls and consular agents, <strong>the</strong>re were probably several more <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong>se who had been act<strong>in</strong>g more or less <strong>of</strong>ficially for <strong>the</strong> Company. Over <strong>the</strong> next thirty years, several more extensive lists were presented as Parliamentary Papers, and <strong>in</strong> 1852 <strong>the</strong> regular publication <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> Foreign Office <strong>List</strong> began. The first few editions are somewhat unreliable but by <strong>the</strong> 1860s this gave fairly comprehensive <strong>in</strong>formation about who <strong>the</strong> consuls were and where <strong>the</strong>y were posted. However <strong>the</strong>se <strong>of</strong>ficial lists rarely provided any genealogical <strong>in</strong>formation. Attempts have been made to remedy this lack by us<strong>in</strong>g a wide variety <strong>of</strong> sources, <strong>of</strong> vary<strong>in</strong>g reliability. Where no reference is shown it is usually because a primary source (such as a church register) was not given, but <strong>in</strong> some cases <strong>the</strong> <strong>in</strong>formation was collected at an early stage <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> project, and <strong>the</strong> source was not recorded – <strong>in</strong> ei<strong>the</strong>r case <strong>the</strong> <strong>in</strong>formation needs to be verified. Ambassadors are only mentioned briefly here because <strong>the</strong>y have been well documented elsewhere. Because <strong>the</strong>y too have been fairly well documented elsewhere, dragomans have usually only been mentioned here when <strong>the</strong>y also carried out o<strong>the</strong>r functions. However some o<strong>the</strong>r non-consular staff such as treasurers, chapla<strong>in</strong>s and surgeons have been <strong>in</strong>cluded because <strong>the</strong>y were <strong>of</strong>ten people who are <strong>in</strong>terest<strong>in</strong>g <strong>in</strong> <strong>the</strong>ir own right. Much more detailed study <strong>of</strong> primary sources will be required before <strong>the</strong> list becomes really reliable,. but it is hoped that even <strong>in</strong> its present form it may be <strong>of</strong> some use to o<strong>the</strong>r researchers – and that it will at least highlight <strong>the</strong> danger <strong>of</strong> rely<strong>in</strong>g on any s<strong>in</strong>gle source <strong>of</strong> <strong>in</strong>formation, however authoritative this might appear to be. The list is be<strong>in</strong>g made public at this stage <strong>in</strong> <strong>the</strong> hope that o<strong>the</strong>r researchers will help to fill some <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> gaps that rema<strong>in</strong>, to correct any mistakes and suggest improvements, and particularly to add more personal details <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> consuls and <strong>the</strong>ir families."
