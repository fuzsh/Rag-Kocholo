If you are not sure, or want to find a group of people, some of the other criteria may be more useful.\n\nPeople are listed alphabetically by surname, with first names and dates of birth and death (or a fl. date of known activity) to help distinguish between people of the same name.\n\nThis criterion will find all people of the same surname or pseudonym.\n\nChoose an item from the drop-down list. If you don’t want to apply this criterion, leave the box showing ‘any surname’.\n\nThis criterion is most useful for finding a group of related people, or for narrowing down a search where you don’t know the precise identity of the person you’re looking for.\n\nThe list shows all the surnames recorded in Lucerna, listed alphabetically.\n\nThis criterion will find all people whose name contains a given group of characters.\n\nType the text you want to find into the box. If you don’t want to apply this criterion, leave the box empty.\n\nThis search is most useful to find a group of people with similar names, or if you are not sure of a person’s full name or the spelling of their name.\n\nThis criterion will find people recorded as having been associated with a given organisation.\n\nChoose an item from the drop-down list. If you don’t want to apply this criterion, leave the box showing ‘any organisation’.\n\nThis criterion is most useful for finding a group of people, or for narrowing down a search where you don’t know the precise identity of the person you’re looking for.\n\nThe list shows all the organisations recorded in Lucerna for which there are also records of related people, listed alphabetically by the name of the organisation."
