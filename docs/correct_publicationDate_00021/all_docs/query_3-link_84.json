        "text": "F.A.Q.\n\nQ: What is your writing cred?\n\nI qualify for SFWA, and I am a member of Codex Writers.\n\nI’ve sold short stories to Escape Pod and several anthologies of fiction.\n\nMy articles are featured in a Writer’s Digest Books anthology, as well as Fantasy Magazine.\n\nI was invited into the curated Wattpad Stars program.\n\nMy Torth series has over 700,000 views on Royal Road.\n\nI’m a graduate of the Odyssey Writing Workshop, where I studied under George R.R. Martin, Catherine Asaro, Barry B. Longyear, and other genre writers.\n\nI won two Honorable Mentions in the Writers of the Future Contest.\n\nI will be eligible for the Astounding Award in 2024!\n\nQ: You’re an animator. Why don’t you write graphic novels or animate your own films?\n\nIf only there were enough years in a lifetime to accomplish everything I want to accomplish! But I have a day job, plus I write epic series. I wish I had a crew of assistants. Then I’d get a lot more done.\n\nI did create four student films. They’re on my YouTube channel. I also shoved a fifth incomplete short film online. My student films have been screened at film festivals such as Annecy International.\n\nQ: Have you written any screenplays or teleplays?\n\nI have a rough draft of a feature-length sci-fi thriller, and a few episodes of an animated primetime comedy show. I’d love to see any of my novels or short works adapted for film!\n\nQ: On Goodreads, why do you rank so many books with four or five stars? If you read evenly, you should have just as many negative as positive reviews.\n\nI don’t read evenly. I only read books that sound interesting to me, or that trustworthy friends have recommended. Life is too short to waste on books that I have to struggle through.\n\nQ: How long are your novels?\n\nThe novels in my Torth series range from about 120,00 words to 240,000 words. That’s roughly 400 — 800 pages in paperback format.\n\nQ: Would you recommend going to the Odyssey Writing Workshop?\n\nYes! This was an awesome experience, and I have only good things to say. It exceeded my expectations in every way.\n\nHowever, you will be challenged to grow as a writer, no matter how talented you already are. If you go to Odyssey expecting nothing but praise, accolades, and recommendations to editors at major publishers, then you’ll be disappointed. No one escapes Odyssey without some brutally honest feedback.\n\nIf you go, be prepared to meet people who are extremely ambitious, talented, and serious about their writing–just like you, I assume. Fortunately, writers seem to be among the most good-natured and supportive creative types. The competitive atmosphere is there, but I found it to be a help rather than a hindrance, pushing me to write better, faster, and to try new methods.\n\nSince there are only 16 students in every annual class, I understand that each year has a different dynamic. Some years seem to be more friendly, others more prolific, others more multi-cultural, or skewed younger/older, or more published, or skewed towards screenwriting, or award-winners, etc. This is just a general factor rather than something for you to worry over. Odyssey also provides an ongoing supportive program for all graduates, bringing them together regularly, and keeping in touch through a mailing list and gatherings at conventions. The roster grows annually by 16 new graduates.\n\nQ: Would you recommend going to CalArts for Character Animation?\n\nI got a lot out of the program, and it was one of the most formative experiences of my life. However, you’ll only get out of it what you’re willing to put into it. If you’re expecting to smoke weed or goof off, you’ll be disappointed by the high-stakes ambition of your peers. Everyone who lasts for more than a year in the Character Animation program is serious about their future career in the film or game industry. That means they’re very competitive. If you don’t like that sort of peer group, or if you’d rather not challenge yourself to grow as an artist, then you won’t like the environment. This advice may sound like common sense, but not everyone is completely honest with themselves. Be true to yourself. There is no shame in choosing a career that speaks to you personally, rather than a career that your family or friends expected for you. If you’re not 100% sure you want to spend the rest of your life as an animator or artist, then examine your self-doubts.\n\nAs for choosing CalArts over, say, Ringling or Animation Mentor … things were a bit different back in the last millennium, when I went there! Animation Mentor didn’t exist back then, and very few schools taught animation at all, let alone 3D animation. My top choices were CalArts and Ringling. I was accepted by both, and I chose CalArts mostly because it had a stronger reputation, and it was founded by Walt Disney. I’ve heard from Ringling graduates that their dorms were a bit run-down and unpleasant, but otherwise, it’s a very similar experience, albeit with more of a 3D focus.\n\nQ: Why are you taking so long to reply to my email?\n\nI have trouble keeping up with email. It’s a chronic, lifelong condition that I’ve been unable to cure. I’m very sorry.\n\nRest assured that I have read your email, unless it bounced (check to see if you received an error message). I reply quickly to simple, non-spam questions. If your email merits a thoughtful response, then I am grateful that you took the time, and I will eventually write you a response in kind, if I feel that I can give you a worthwhile answer."
