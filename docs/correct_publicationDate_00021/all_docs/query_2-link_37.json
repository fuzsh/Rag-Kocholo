        "text": "I’m off writing up new posts. (Is my last post not proof of that?) So, you get the last bit of Vernor Vinge material in the archives.\n\nRaw Feed (2003): “The Cookie Monster”, Vernor Vinge, Analog Science Fiction and Fact, October 2003.\n\nVinge is very aware that this story is operating in a long tradition in sf, specifically the artificial world set up for amusement or research purposes. He even has his characters name some examples: Theodore Sturgeon’s “Microcosmic God”, Frederik Pohl’s “Tunnel Under the World“, John Varley’s “Overdrawn at the Memory Bank”, Robert Charles Wilson’s Darwinia, Moravec’s ‘Pigs in Cyberspace'” (I assume that’s Hans Moravec), Galouye’s Simulacron-3, David Brin’s “Stones of Significance” and Kiln People.\n\nI’m familiar with most of these as being about worlds simulated in mechanical simulacra or computers and the related theme of personality recordings and uploadings (which then can be inserted into a computer simulation). I don’t recognize Vinge’s own self-referential mention of “deathcubes”.\n\nI generally like this theme. In literary sf, I’m quite fond of the similar “News from D Street” by Andrew Weiner and Barry B. Longyear’s “Adagio”, but this story didn’t do much for me.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nSince I recently covered Pohl’s co-authored Preferred Risk, I thought I’d continue to chip away at my project to read all of Pohl’s science fiction.\n\nReview: Planets Three, ed. Frederik Pohl, 1982.\n\nYou know, we had a nice Solar System once. Then those grubby space probes and lunar landers wrecked some prime literary real estate.\n\nThat was back in the days when Frederik Pohl was first writing, hiding behind a bunch of pen names that shielded him and his sometime collaborators. Nice bit of plausible denial ability that. You can hide the newbie work if it it’s crap and take credit for the good stuff later. One of those handles was James MacCreigh. The big honcho in sf at the time was John W. Campbell. That guy thought writers needed American type names and, being a Campbell, he naturally thought the Scots-American sort was the best. Not that it did this Pohl guy any good. Campbell never sprang for any of Pohl’s solo work no matter what John Hancock he put on the manuscript.\n\nThis Pohl guy comes clean about all this in his “Introduction”. He just flat out tells you this was work from his first fifteen years being a writer, stuff he got published after the war. He’s not going to tell you any of these three stories are great stuff. You make that call. He just tells you they’re “space opera”, “action science fiction”. He polished them and sent them out into the world. Best he could do at the time.\n\nYeah, these are action adventures. We got heroes. They get beautiful women (or something close enough) at the end.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nAfter reading David B. Riley’s Bonded Agent, I wondered if this novel would be another rare case of an insurance claims adjustor showing up in a science fiction story as a hero.\n\nReview: Preferred Risk, Frederik Pohl and Lester del Rey, 1955, 1980.\n\nThis was better than I expected and not as satirical as the C. M. Kornbluth’s and Pohl’s collaboration The Space Merchants.\n\nIt was, of course, the advertising industry that dominated the world in that novel. Here it’s an insurance company, simply called the Company. As Pohl explains in his afterword, “The Art and Agony of Collaboration”, Pohl’s conceptual inspiration for the story is that, rightly or wrongly, money guides peoples’ behavior. What if you had a system where someone made a profit mitigating the evils of life?\n\nThe Company is that someone, a single insurance company that came to dominate the world after the Short War (seemingly a nuclear exchange between the US and USSR). It not only writes policies for life insurance. It has food and medical policies too. And, as our hero Tom Willis would be happy to tell you, it’s eliminated war and want.\n\nAt least that’s what he’d say if you asked him when he arrives in Naples, Italy in the wake of a local war fought between that city and Sicily. The world has balkanized under the Company and only America has maintained something like its old size.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nMy look at the work of David B. Riley ends on a high note.\n\nReview: Bonded Agent, David B. Riley, 2016.\n\nThere was a type of science fiction story that was common in the 1950s that showed how today’s professions would change in the future. I still, very occasionally, come across examples of this type of story.\n\nThe profession at the center of this story is one I’m not sure has ever been covered before in science fiction: an insurance claims adjustor (unless it’s in Frederik Pohl’s and Lester Del Rey’s satirical look at the insurance industry, Preferred Risk, which I have not read).\n\nThat’s not the only thing in this enjoyable and fun novel that reminded me of a novel from the 1950s. It’s also sparse and fast moving and has plenty of humorous interaction between humans and aliens.\n\nEven though this novel started out as a short story, it’s much tighter than Riley’s other novels and incorporates some ongoing threads successfully throughout all its episodes.\n\nOur heroine is Sarah Meadows. She graduates with honors from the Martian School of Economics, gets her license to sell insurance, and starts working for Gompers Insurance.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nAnd, with this, the archive is tapped out on my “reviews” of Frederik Pohl.\n\nRaw Feed (2004): Jem, Frederik Pohl, 1978, 1979.\n\nThis may be the first Pohl I ever read. I started this novel when it was first serialized in Galaxy but never finished it then. (The kind person who donated science fiction magazines to my high school library didn’t supply that issue.)\n\nIt’s an interesting book on four levels.\n\nIt has a rather dated flavor, specifically of the ‘70s with its division of the earth into three power blocs based on the resource they export — fuel, food, and people. The inspiration for this is obviously the real-world OPEC, and the book also bears characteristic Pohl concerns: overpopulation and/or resource exhaustion and/or pollution. The first two were popular sf themes at least through the mid-1980s. These days the greenhouse effect is the environmental apocalypse of the day. Pohl’s world has traditional enmities and alliances reshuffled. America, a food exporter (the food bloc is Earth’s second richest power bloc), is now allied with some former Soviet countries and has cool relations with Britain.\n\nThe second interesting thing is, despite this ‘70s flavor, the novel has a very 19th century and early 20th century feeling — specifically, as nuclear war gets closer and closer on Earth — of World War One. The three power blocs try to compete to exploit and colonize Jem to gain greater power relative to their competitors in a manner reminiscent of the colonization of the world by Europeans.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nIn keeping with looking at what my archives have to say on Frederik Pohl works, here’s a review of an anthology he appeared in.\n\nRaw Feed (2000) Armageddons, eds Jack Dann and Gardner Dozois, 1999.\n\n“Preface”, Jack Dann and Gardner Dozois — Brief introduction to the anthology which talks about the beginnings of apocalyptic sf and how apocalyptic notions once relegated to mostly sf are now common thoughts in the public at large.\n\n“Fermi and Frost”, Frederik Pohl — I’d heard of this story before. It’s relatively famous. Published originally in 1985, I suspect this is one of the sf stories to specifically evoke the idea of “nuclear winter” (though the term is not used). I don’t know how closely Pohl followed the scenario of Carl Sagan and other inventors of the idea of nuclear winter. For instance, I’d never heard of the destructive, soil destroying (via erosion) rains though they logically follow. Pohl chillingly lays out the details of his apocalyptic scenario, adds an interesting beginning where he lays out alternative fates for nine-year-old Timothy Clary – “But that is in fact what did happen!” he says after detailing an alternative where Clary survives (in Iceland which, given its volcanism, actually turns out to be one of the better places to survive nuclear war). Pohl adds a wry, cautionary note at story’s end where he details a plot development where man lives, survives, saves “the science and beauty of life” and greets aliens. But the story ends, “At least, one would like to think so.” Fermi is evoked in the title because the death of humanity is a possible answer to the Fermi Paradox. This isn’t a new idea. Carl Sagan proposed self-destruction as a reason why an alien civilization wouldn’t be around to communicate with us. This is a well-told story, but there’s nothing in here to really distinguish it from many another nuclear war story.\n\n“A Desperate Calculus”, Gregory Benford — Gregory Benford had an article in Reason a few years ago very similar to this story (originally published under the name Sterling Blake, a Benford pseudonym I was unaware of). The premise behind both is that a group of environmentalists might decide to cure environmental degradation in the overpopulated, poor Southern hemisphere by introducing plagues. In the article, Benford postulated revived, lethal smallpox. Here, the environmentalists introduce (under cover as medical doctors, amongst other things) a disease that mostly renders women infertile. Mostly, but they’re willing to accept some collateral damage in deaths of the elderly. In both article and story, Benford postulates that the wealthy North won’t exactly rush aid to the South. At story’s end, the North has developed a vaccine against the plague but isn’t going to rush it to the South. In the article, Benford makes it clear he regards this scenario as plausible and probable and disapproves of such nasty tactics. (He, however, is worried about environmental degradation and lessening biodiversity. I’m sure he supports the idea, depicted in this story, of simply sweeping huge amounts of organisms in the threatened areas of the South and freezing them for possible DNA resurrection.) The morality of the story is much less clear (possibly because the plague is not intended to be lethal). The tone is more matter of fact and not moralizing, and much of the tale seems to be an exchange of letters between lovers Todd (working in the Bio-Salvage Program) and Amy (an epidemiologist) about their work against the backdrop of a spreading superflu. It is only at the end of the tale that we find out they are carriers of the superflu and that their correspondence is part of the coded communication of a conspiracy of about a 100. In the unlikely event that future bioterrorists are lacking in imagination, modern sf has provided a lot of plausible ideas – including this one – to try.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nMore Pohl “reviews” from the archives.\n\nIncidentally, I have read the sequel Mars Plus by Pohl and Thomas T. Thomas. Alas, I made no notes on it.\n\nRaw Feed (1994): Man Plus, Frederik Pohl, 1976.\n\nThis is a very good book, deservedly a Nebula award winner.\n\nNot only does it show the influence of Pohl’s liberal democrat politics, but it’s also very much a product of mid-seventies pessimism. The future of this book extrapolates the continual march of Socialism through Australia and elsewhere (including Pakistan and England); China and Russia are both major powers, “collectivist dictatorships” ruling almost everywhere except Sweden and Israel. The United States seems to be the bastion of the “Free World”, but it is plagued by shortages of fuel and water (Oklahoma’s a dust bowl again), and New York City is under martial law. (Another example of James Gunn’s dictum about sf authors liking to trash their hometowns). Overpopulation and food and water shortages plague the world. As U.S. President Fitz-James “Dash” Desnatine says, the whole world is a disaster area.\n\nWarned by computer projections of sociological, economic, political, and technological trends that nuclear war is quickly becoming very probable (Sf writers seem to have never outgrown their love of and hope for an Asimovian type of psychohistory which can predict the future and put social planning – important if you’re a liberal – on a rational basis. Unfortunately, reality hasn’t seemed to cooperate much). The same computer projections state that putting a man – or, more precisely – a cyborg on Mars will avert war. The Man Plus project to build that cyborg – and the life of Roger Torraway the man who is altered and who lands on Mars – is the main thrust of this novel.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nIt’s another Pohl review from the archives.\n\nRaw Feed (1989): The Years of the City, Frederik Pohl, 1984.\n\nI primarily read this book as a utopia, and it reads favorably in that light as well as a work of science fiction extrapolation.\n\nLike most utopian writers — with the exception of Edward Bellamy’s Looking Backward — Pohl feels the need to tamper with the family and sexuality. Utopian writers correctly, view sexuality and the family unit as a basic political, social, and economic building block of society. Pohl is relatively staid in utopian terms.\n\nHe just proposes communes (for some — Pohl is a humanitarian, libertarian whose utopian ideal has people following individual paths to happiness), group marriages, and some homosexuality.\n\nPohl expresses his interest in science and technology in this utopia. Computers, innovative urban architecture (Fuller domes and underground construction), and alternative energy schemes form the technological basis of society. There are many utopian novels which naively see technology as the key to utopia or propose silly methods of altering human nature. Pohl is not guilty of either.\n\nHis concern is proposing political and social solutions to modern ills. While the book is too libertarian and pro-democratic for me, I liked it a lot and liked some of his proposals. I liked the idea of a civil servant draft (though I did question people being drafted as judges [in 2023, having heard from lawyers about widespread lack of legal understanding and corruption among judges, I don’t have a problem with this now]), of a cafeteria approach to paying for services, and I particularly liked the proposal of paying five percent more in taxes and being able to determine where it all goes. (I can hear the screams of protest for that one — the rich determining the national budget. It would also mean government agencies would, in effect, have to advertise.)\n\nContinue reading →\n\nIt’s going to be a while until I post some new reviews, so you know what that means. It’s time for another Raw Feed.\n\nI’m partial to Frederik Pohl and mean to, eventually, read all his stuff.\n\nMy copy of this book is autographed by Pohl when he appeared at the University of Minnesota to speak. It’s a battered, second hand paperback. That, or the title itself, may have been why my wife detected a slight curl of disgust when I presented it to Pohl.\n\nIn my defense, I didn’t have a lot of money for a nice hardback of a book that was then 22 years old, and I happened to be reading it at the time.\n\nRaw Feed (1988): The Age of the Pussyfoot, Frederik Pohl, 1969.\n\nThis seems to be Pohl’s response, in part, to Brave New World by Aldous Huxley and, perhaps (I’ve never read the work) H. G. Wells’ The Shape of Things to Come. This seemed particularly true when Forrester went to the religious ceremony underground which seemed like Huxley’s Violent Passion Surrogate.\n\nPohl’s entire point, though, and his reason for responding to other anti-utopias, was to show you can’t go back to another time in history — only try to shape the present to a desired image. This point was particularly emphasized with the Luddite society who wants to take only some technology away.\n\nPohl, more than any other writer who has tackled the corpsicle revived theme (at least of versions I’ve read), conveys the disorientation of his protagonist. Pohl’s society is not very willing to suffer Forrester gladly. There is no kind guide to the future (only hard experience) unlike Edward Bellamy’s Looking Backward.\n\nPohl is an expert at creating a picture of the future with a few deft strokes. He postulates giant changes but also (perhaps even more disorienting) strange, small changes like stepping on someone’s feet being a dueling offense. The device of the children was humorous and quite good. They give Forrester useful information but insulted him like real children.\n\nContinue reading →"
