        "text": "Alternadad by Neal Pollack\n\nI am still not sure how I ever got a copy of Alternadad by Neal Pollack but it rested on my bookcase for probably a decade before I found the time to pick it up and give it a chance. Now that I can read non-fiction again, I figured I …\n\nContinue\"Alternadad by Neal Pollack\"\n\nDevolution by Max Brooks\n\nI received Devolution by Max Brooks as a gift while I was on vacation. Since I had read the Zombie Survival Guide and WWZ, I was excited and almost jumped right in, but I was diving into the Wizard King series and wanted to keep at it. I love everything …\n\nContinue\"Devolution by Max Brooks\"\n\nTrial of the Wizard King by Chad Corrie\n\nTrial of the Wizard King by Chad Corrie is the second book in the Wizard King series. I am reading the first two books back-to-back which is a privilege I have rarely enjoyed of the past 10+ years of writing book reviews. After the Created Series which I read in …\n\nContinue\"Trial of the Wizard King by Chad Corrie\"\n\nReturn of the Wizard King by Chad Corrie\n\nReturn of the Wizard King by Chad Corrie is a fantasy novel which was released last year. I have already bought the second one and assume the third will be available soon. If you happened to read my last book review you are aware my reading habits have recently changed …\n\nContinue\"Return of the Wizard King by Chad Corrie\"\n\nThe Book of the Created by Robert Boyczuk\n\nThe Book of the Created by Robert Boyczuk is the amazing third novel in the Created Series. If you have not read my recent reviews of the first two novels perhaps take a moment to bounce back on this site and check them out. Unlike many trilogies I have …\n\nContinue\"The Book of the Created by Robert Boyczuk\"\n\nDesert Oracle by Ken Layne\n\nDesert Oracle by Ken Layne came out recently, and, unlike my normal modality, I read something current. I enjoyed this even if this book tended to cover topics several decades old. The author showed us a good sense of humor and did not take himself too seriously. Genre: Science Fiction/Non-Fiction …\n\nContinue\"Desert Oracle by Ken Layne\"\n\nJennifer Ainsley: The Final Demon War by Sidney Stone\n\nJennifer Ainsley: The Final Demon War by Sidney Stone has been waiting to be reviewed for a while. I thought it was not the first book in the series, so it collected dust in my shelves. Perhaps the title the Final Demon War made me think it was the last …\n\nContinue\"Jennifer Ainsley: The Final Demon War by Sidney Stone\"\n\nTasha’s Cauldron of Everything\n\nTasha’s Cauldron of Everything was released before the end of last year. This book is hosted by Tasha who is a powerful witch raised by Baba Yaga herself. She gives a fun, if snarky, commentary throughout this manual. For game purposes, this new book is similar to Xanathar’s Guide to …\n\nContinue\"Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything\"\n\nNyxia by Scott Reintgen\n\nNyxia by Scott Reintgen was a hidden gem in my bookcase which I am glad I gave a try for this was a great book to start the new year with. This book was a real page turner which had me breaking some of my reading rules because I …\n\nContinue\"Nyxia by Scott Reintgen\"\n\nAlligator by Lisa Moore\n\nAlligator by Lisa Moore is a literary masterpiece. I bought this book at the downtown Powells in Portland about 15 years ago when my daughter was going to college there. I guess it stayed on one of my, oh so many shelves, for a while, mostly because I like to …\n\nContinue\"Alligator by Lisa Moore\"\n\nThe Made Up Man by Karen Heular\n\nThe Made Up Man by Karen Heular is an odd novel I put off reading for a long while. However, I am honestly attempting to read every book I have ever been sent to review, so here goes. Alyson’s life is all but destroyed when her longtime lover leaves her …\n\nContinue\"The Made Up Man by Karen Heular\"\n\nACID by Emma Pass\n\nACID by Emma Pass is set in a dark Orwellian future where a rich minority forces their believes and rule on a dispossessed and abused majority. The tale focused on Jenna Strong but it is hard for me to remember her name since it changes so many times throughout the …\n\nContinue\"ACID by Emma Pass\"\n\nThe Last Kids on Earth and the Zombie Parade by Max Brallier\n\nThe Last Kids on Earth and the Zombie Parade by Max Brallier is a young adult book geared for middle school kids and perhaps more for boys than girls. Some might call this a little horror novel or even dystopian, but I am going to go with Dark Fantasy with …\n\nContinue\"The Last Kids on Earth and the Zombie Parade by Max Brallier\"\n\nSherlock Holmes Vs Cthulhu by Lois H. Gresh\n\nSherlock Holmes Vs Cthulhu by Lois H. Gresh is an entertaining mix of classic Holmes deduction meeting the dark horror of the Cthulhu mythos.

Watson’s first-person voice documents their exciting ride into …\n\nContinue\"Sherlock Holmes Vs Cthulhu by Lois H. Gresh\"\n\nJoyland by Stephen King\n\nJoyland, by Stephen King, is a Mystery/Crime which came out a few years ago and I never got around to reading it because I try to focus my reviews on Speculative Fiction. I found out I had made a mistake because this is an outstanding novel. It has an ease …\n\nContinue\"Joyland by Stephen King\"\n\nDead Man’s Hand, an Anthology of The Weird West\n\nDead Man’s Hand, an Anthology of The Weird West was a true joy to read, at least for a man such as myself, living in the southwest and addicted to Speculative Fiction. This anthology had it all, Steampunk, Fantasy, Dark Fantasy, and I was so pleased to find several stories …\n\nContinue\"Dead Man’s Hand, an Anthology of The Weird West\"\n\nDungeons and Dragons Dungeons Master Guide for 5E\n\nHey look, if anyone is paying attention, you might remember me stating the Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes would be the last Dungeons and Dragons handbook I would be reviewing for a while, but I forgot about the Dungeon Master’s Guide which I had actually not finished. Somewhat strangely, even though …\n\nContinue\"Dungeons and Dragons Dungeons Master Guide for 5E\"\n\n‘Lo People, Her Tangh-i-ness has known about Manifesting and the Law of Attraction intuitively, but what has been delightful was to come across those who could express some of the occurrences that were happening kind of haphazardly. Genre: Science Fiction Publisher: Vast Five Released: 2013 Stars: 3.5 Stars Reviewer: …\n\nContinue\"\"\n\nDungeons and Dragons Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes for 5E\n\nThis is the next in my series of reviews of Dungeons and Dragons 5E Manuals. It may end up being my last for a while for as far as I know, this is the final book which does not involve a locale or a module. I remain mostly uninterested in …\n\nContinue\"Dungeons and Dragons Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes for 5E\""
