(207) 778-6739 For Jude, Jannettja, Tony, and Sophie; Fay, Mike, and Jeremy, And Jean. Battles won, victories in progress. A tribe is no more Than a thought Chaining the thinker To eternal war with those Fettered to thoughts Of a different sort. Hissied-do'timan, Meditations on Blood CHAPTER 1 Miati Ki hides in the rubble above us at the lip of the dry strea m bed. I see only its right boot and the top of its energy pack. The sun is hot and the heat radiating from the desert sand and boulders flails my face and steals my breath. Only the dense humidity remembers that this was once a jungle. There are no birds, no flowers, no trees. Everything beautiful and gentle that once flew or grew here left this part of the Shorda countless lives ago. Still, the stinging greenflies have survived. They will outlive us all. Pina is eating the last of its share of the rations we captured. As it took its share of the rations, Pina made a joke, holding it to its lips. \"This is the fruit of the Irrveden, for which the Mavedah fought, that we eat at the second repast.\" I laughed with the others at the words of the repast ceremony, from times when there were formal repasts, tables, and food. Back before any of us were born. When I was very young, before my parent's death, Yazi Avo would recite the ceremony at meals, when there were meals. I laughed, but Pina's joke made me want to cry. I hold to my ear the little receiver I keep in my pocket. Its screen is broken, but it still produces audio. The Mavedah station at Mijii Heights still sends, which means the eastern flank of the Front's invasion of the Shorda is still stalled. The music is that rapid effervescent confusion of human\n\nand Drac folk music we call zidydrac and the humans call mancho. The recording was made before the war. I scan for the Amadeen Front's mobile station, or one of the others. Sometimes I can get the Black October station, but not today. Nothing new supporting the rumors of another attempt at a truce. Even if a truce should take place it would be only a matter of days before The Rose, Black October, or some other uncontrollable faction of the Front violates it, throwing us all back into war. Still, there would be a day, possible more, without death. Ki's hand makes signs to us. First the fist, one finger pointed down, then all three fingers together followed by a fist. Chaki Anta is back. There had been an explosion at the bunker. We all heard it, saw the smoke and dust carried by the wind over the lake. Qat Juniki told us about it before it died. A human had come out of the bunker, his hands above his head, and Chaki Anta took the man's surrender. The human's hands were held as fists. \"I saw the wire,\" said Juniki. \"I told the man to open his hands before he came any closer. I told him in English. I told him again. When he opened them, the world vanished.\" A walking bomb with a dead man's switch. Such a human way of killing. Juniki thought Chaki Anta had been killed, but now Anta is back. As I turn off the receiver I am relieved. Anta is an old fighter, a survivor of many raids and battles. It helps me to know that not everyone dies in this war. My relief is mixed with dread, for when Anta comes back, our killing and dying resume. We will soon move into a fight. No one says any of this but it is in everyone's eyes. We swallow the last of our ration bars. I see Pina take a touch of happy paste with its tongue. Its eyes close as the drug spins Pina away on a transitory cloud of joy. I look at my ration bar and wonder why food is so scarce but happy paste is everywhere. In the end we will probably die of malnutrition within the mist of a spittle dream. We looted the ration bars from the humans, but they are good to eat. They are viyapi rations the humans looted from us. Some of the human rations are good, too. I like the containers of fruit and the candy bars, but they are rare. There is something in plastic envelopes called scrambled eggs and ham that even the humans refuse to eat. For that reason, of course, scrambled eggs and ham are all that they have left. Their rations, like ours, are left over from the war. Chaki Anta slides and stumbles down the dust of the stream bank, followed by Ki. Anta's face is deep ochre, an old scar along the left side of its forehead. Although our commander smiles with its mouth, its deep yellow eyes betray all of the dead they have seen. Anta nods as it points toward the east with its battered energy knife. \"Only a few left in that bunker at the foot of the bluff. I heard firing coming from inside. They were not shooting at me or at anything outside the bunker.\" Its brow climbs in an expression of hopeful possibility. \"I think they were fighting among themselves.\" His cold smile becomes a cold grin. \"We will get Taaka Liok a present and end them this time.\" Chaki Anta's eyes narrow. \"We are the Twelve.\" \"The Front Twelve,\" we mutter back more out of habit than pride. Our eagerness drowned in oceans of blood years ago, buying presents for Taaka Liok with our blood. My whole life in the Mavedah has been spent\n\nserving at the pleasure of this mysterious warmaster, who in turn serves at the pleasure of the Denvedah Diea. I glance down at the helmet in my hands. It carries on its once sand-red surface the scars of thirty years of death. Only five of those years are mine. The sensors and readout still work, but the voice link is scratchy. I can do without the voice link. Hand signals are silent, instant, clear, and do not send out electro-magnetic pulses for eager probes to pick up. Besides, I prefer to dedicate my hearing to my immediate surroundings. That is where the threats to my life lie. The helmet is military issue, of the Tsien Denvedah back in the war. It is twice as old as I am. The names of seven Mavedah soldiers are scratched in the surface exposing the dull brown fiber beneath. Ritan Vey Ada Nitoh Lioseh Akiva Ivat Mikotath Sed Tura Riwis Achavneh Enot Fal. We all know the stories of the great hero Ritan Vey, once second warmaster of the Tsien Denve of the Ninth Shordan, conqueror of New Aetheria. Only a few of us remember Enot Fal. Fal's first day after training saw it crushed beneath the treads of an Amadeen Front tank in the attack on Stokes Crossing in the Southern Shorda. I had no helmet of my own, so I claimed Fal's. I wonder who will get the helmet after I am gone. It is irrational of me, but I am afraid to scratch my own name into this pathetic monument. Besides, the seven names already there are burden enough to carry. We are the Front Twelve, Anta had told us long ago. Tsien Siay. The pride of the Okori Sikov. There are only five of us left now. Ragged, tired, and thin from meager rations. We were twelve at the beginning of the battle six days ago. When the last of us falls, perhaps there will be another twelve to replace us. Children, ancients, and fools. Onward marches the grand Mavedah. I slip my shoulders into the straps of my energy pack and adjust the piece of plastic foam between the pack and the small of my back to ease the chafing. Something I learned from a dead human. I glance sideways to see if my few remaining comrades somehow detect the treason that echoes in my thoughts. Anta is positioning its energy knife in the harsh sunlight to absorb that last bit of energy before we go. Miati Ki is strapping on its equipment, most of which was salvaged from dead Amadeen Front soldiers. How can we be so different from the humans, yet so alike? We can use the same weapons, wear the same rags, eat the same food, scratch the same rashes and slap at the same parasites. After decades of close horror, we even speak each others language. But, breathing the same air -- that is something that demands death. Varo Pina and Skis Adoveyna are waiting for the order, their eyes tired and yellow, staring at the top of the bank. I can see that Pina already sees its own death. I want to touch its hand, to tell Pina that we will survive, but my friend would reject my words. My friend Varo Pina knows it must die. It has talked about nothing else for days. I think it wants to get done with the experience. \"I am calm about death,\" Pina once said to me. \"Waiting for death is the strain.\" Once, in the dust of memory, Pina and I loved. Neither of us conceived. The humans have us there. If a Drac is certain it will be dead or otherwise unable to care for its young, it cannot conceive. To humans, though, the prospect of death and deprivation seems to drive them into a fertile frenzy. We are told that it is a primitive survival mechanism to preserve the species. They also live longer than Dracs, barring\n\ntraumatic intervention. I no longer have those feelings for Pina, and Pina has no feelings left for me. I wonder if any of us have any feelings left for anything. Without speaking, Chaki Anta puts on its helmet and signals Miati Ki and me to take the front. I do not hesitate. Instead I take my energy knife, climb the bank, reach the lip, and begin crawling through the rubble, checking automatically for remote sensors and probes. It has been a long time since any of us saw a working remote or probe, but we stay cautious. There are still scanners and missiles. Humans also have eyes and those big ears. I note the position of the sun. By the time we reach the bunker it will be behind us, burning our backs but glaring into the eyes of the humans. I can see the bunker by peering through a crack in the ruin of a stone wall. The heat radiating from the wall washes my face. The fortification is to my front, the bluff farther on and more to my left. To my far left is a low hill. To my right stretches the lake named Sharing in both Drac and human languages. The lake was named a long time ago, before the war, back in a fantasy time when Dracs and humans were supposed to have lived and worked together. \"Yazi Ro,\" the voice link scratches into my ear membrane. \"Keep moving.\" My head is filled with so many minds, but my body follows Anta's orders as though it has its own will. I crawl from behind the broken wall, around a pile of still smoking wreckage, until I reach the body of one of the Twelve's fallen. A primitive projectile caught the Drac beneath its left eye. The back of its head is missing exposing an ochre goo that was once a brain. What do you leave behind, comrade? A parent? A child? Did you have someone who loved you? Does anyone care how you died? that you died? for what you died? What did you die for, my nameless comrade? If I meet my own death this moment, I am at a loss to say for what I died. I am an automation; a creature that responds to orders. Perhaps I die for glorious habit. There must be a grander way than that to record me in my line's archives, if they still exist. The language Dracon, however, is suited more to facts than fantasy. There are few ways to express an event except with truth. To spin dreams the language English was designed. Here lies Yazi Ro, dead because it couldn't go no mo.' Pooped, perhaps, from a penchant for proclivity. Yazi Avo, my parent, taught me my English. Avo once said that if there is ever to be peace, we must first talk. I laugh at this now. All either species knows how to do with words is to wound. My parent had a crippled foot, mangled in an Amadeen Front raid when it was not even half a year old. I look at the body of my comrade. The young one, barely an adult of five years, was given to the Twelve just before the battle to fill out our number. Young, but a good soldier, nevertheless. I saw its knife take down at least three humans before the bullet found its mark. A strange way to measure occupational proficiency. Two paces beyond the nameless Drac is a nameless human who must have been dead for quite awhile. I cannot tell if it is male or female. Its skin is swollen and black, the eyes crusted with thirsty greenflies, their swollen iridescent bodies like so many droplets of jade. Human dead turn black when they lie in the sun for a few days. The odor is beyond description. I make a wide path around it. To the human's side I see the white flash of an anksnake\n\nbeneath the body, out of the direct sun, feeding on the corpse's guts. They only go for decaying flesh, so I am in no danger from the snake. But it might have startled me. Had I cried out, or raised up, or used my weapon, that would have been the end for all of us. But I do not draw attention to myself and must pay attention to the instant. Again I face the bunker. It is an ugly fire-blackened shelter of poured stone. It has rounded corners, gun ports, and a huge hole blasted into its left front. To the right of the hole a deep red rose is painted, the sign of the Amadeen Front. The three remaining weapon ports are spaced evenly to the right of the hole. Between the bunker and my position is a field of rubble. I see a dark shape just for an instant. It runs from in front of the bunker to a position among some rocks part way up the bluff. I am not certain, but more than one human seems to be there. I glance to my left and wait until I catch a glimpse of Ki forty paces away. Ki turns its head toward me for a moment and I raise my hand and point. Ki looks forward, sees the rocks, and nods. It begins bearing toward the left and the rocks, while I continue toward the bunker. So many times have I faced death to do more death. And after the effort and sacrifice there are still more humans to kill, more comrades to watch die, more fire to burn, more things to destroy. The bunker ahead of me is part of a village that exchanged hands four times this year alone. How many hundreds or thousands of lives has this ruined heap of debris cost? I cannot even guess. And for what reason? It sits astride a road crossing with surfaces impossible to traverse by wheeled vehicles that no longer function. My knee strikes a small rock which clatters into a larger rock. I freeze. Motionless, no breathing, willing my heart to quit its pounding. I'm almost afraid to move my eyes for the notice their motion might draw. Still my gaze quickly searches the ground between me and the bunker. Broken walls, rubble, twisted towers of metal. I can see nothing threatening. The pebble had not made a loud noise, but if the humans have a listening post out or a sensor buried nearby, the noise would be loud enough. Without looking at it, my right hand steals down the length of my weapon one finger's breadth. It reaches the power switch, and I energize my knife. Neither the switch nor the weapon powering up make a sound, but I can feel the power pulse. I am grateful I took advantage of the time in the sun waiting for Anta's return to add to the charge. The touch gauge shows seventy three percent. My voice link crackles in my ear, startling me. It is Miati Ki reporting to Chaki Anta. \"Anta,\" Ki whispers to the old fighter. \"There are four of them in those rocks behind and to the left of the bunker. Their field of fire covers almost all of the ground in front of Yazi Ro.\" The words, once I allowed myself to understand them, made my skin writhe. Another crackle, then Chaki Anta's voice. \"Ki, have they seen you?\" \"No, but they see Yazi Ro. They are staring at Ro this moment, weapons trained. I think they wait to see the rest of us before they open fire.\" \"What weapons?\" asks Anta. \"Two rifles and a captured energy knife. I cannot see what the fourth has.\"\n\n\"Stay in place, Ki,\" answers Anta. \"I'm coming up on your left with Pina and Adoveyna.\" By the breath of a kiz, I am fisher's bait! I fight down the urge to bolt and run. It seems insane. As the battle started there were hundreds in this sector. Now it has come down to four humans and five Dracs? Is this when I die, when it is all but over? \"Stay in place, Ro,\" comes Anta's voice. \"Give no sign that you are aware of the humans in the rocks.\" \"As you order, Anta.\" Fine words from my leader and a terribly brave response, but I've already given a sign by signaling Ki. How do I take that back? Perhaps no human saw it. Or if one of them did, perhaps that one mistook my gesture for something else. \"Look, the Drac is saying hello.\" A mind in fear takes comfort where it may. I swallow against the moisture in my mouth. Human mouths grow dry with fear. Dracs fairly drool. I occupy my mind trying to figure out which is worse. To drool or not to drool, that is the question. My grip on my weapon has my fingers aching, but I cannot relax them in fear of the movement. I need to void. I know it is only the fear and I force the feeling away. Only the urge to void goes. The fear stays. There is no more communication on the voice link. With patience that threatens to tear my neck muscles, I turn my head so very slowly to my left, my eyes straining to see around the left frame of my visor. It takes forever, but once more I can see where Ki had been concealed. Instead of Ki, however, there is Pina. It is crawling very rapidly toward the rocks. Anta must have already passed. Adoveyna follows Pina without a pause. Will they take down the humans before the humans become impatient waiting for me to make my move? It is said that some humans pray to gods. I feel the lack. My view of Adoveyna is lost as it crawls behind some rubble. I slowly turn my head to face the bunker but I stop as I see something above and far behind where I lost sight of Skis Adoveyna. The small hill is little more than a support for shattered stumps and the remains of a few smashed dwellings, a thin smoky mist rendering everything in shades of gray. Earlier in the day the rise had been roasted and pulverized. Still, there was something that shouldn't be. A fifth human? More? Had I seen a piece of wire or cloth waving in the slight breeze? A stray beam of light reflected from --- \"Anta,\" I whisper into the voice link. \"Anta, to your far left, up on that hill, I saw movement.\" \"Where?\" it asks, but before I can answer, the kow-kow sounds of a human rifle shatters the silence. The sounds are soon joined by Pina screaming into the link and the humans in the rocks opening up with the energy knife, the broad swath of its blade coming right toward me. Someone screams, \"Kill them!\" Quickly I roll until a large block of cut stone is between me and the knife, still giving the humans on the hill a view of me. Two of Anta's remaining knives fire at the rocks beneath the bluff while the third fires irregularly at the hill. I turn, place my back against the stone block, aim my own blade toward the hill, and press the trigger. I feel the tremendous energy\n\npulses as they warm my hands. When I am certain the humans are at least down, I jump up and turn to run toward the bunker. A deafening explosion erupts in front of me, blinding me for a moment, filling my lungs with choking dust and gasses. Before I open my eyes or check to see if I have all of my limbs, I realize that the fourth human in the rocks has a missile launcher. My eyes open and the sky above is gray with dust and smoke, cut with the green glowing blades of energy knives and the white streaks of pulse weapons. As the deadly silence ends, returning my hearing to me, the feeling comes back to my body. The first of it is a skull-cracking pain in my head, a stinging tingle all across my skin. I cautiously lift my hands to feel my head, grateful to find that it is still covered by my helmet. I sit up, then kneel as I pick up my weapon. It is still charged and operative. Without thinking, I climb to my feet and spring forward, the breath coming hard in my lungs as I braid my way among the broken stones and twisted metal. A loud kang sound from a piece of metal near my head catches me by surprise and I recoil from it, roll to my left, and come up aiming my blade at the bunker. There are two, no five flashes from the dark opening. The ground around me erupts with geysers of stone dust as shattered bits of metal buzz around me. An energy flash from behind comes close enough to sear the flesh on my left shoulder. There is at least one more human with a knife. I throw myself into a slight depression, whirl about, and fire my knife at the hill once more. Twice, three times, and I see my blade catch an energy pack. There is a blinding blue light, then nothing but a steaming hole in the ground. There doesn't seem to be anyone left firing from the rocks or the hill and I roll to my right, jump up, and wash the bunker opening with my knife. After I release the trigger, I squat behind some wreckage and check the hill as I touch the knife's charge indicator. Still nothing on the hill and my weapon is at forty-nine percent. I glance a little more to the right, and look at the rocks. They are black where before they were reddish tan. I see no movement. \"Anta?\" I call into my voice link. There is nothing but static. \"Anta? Ki? Pina? Adoveyna?\" I get to my feet and try again. \"Tsien Siay, report!\" They cannot all be dead. We have been at this far too long, endured too many things. If the human demons that spawned this hell have any sense of justice, all of the Twelve cannot be dead. With my chin I switch the sensor in my helmet to read thermal input. Looking at my visor I see a bright orange place on the hill where I laid on my blade causing the human's energy pack to go up. There is another bright orange place among the rocks where the second knife was. When it went up, the four humans went with it. Below the rocks there is a dimming orange dot, the cooling body of a dead human. In the rubble field below, where my comrades were hiding, there are another four orange dots, dimming, as the heat leaves their bodies. Before feelings crush me, I remind myself that the lack of an exploded energy pack sign means that in all probability, their knives still work. I must disable them before I leave. I am alone. For a moment I am confused about what to do. Should I rage and throw myself into the monster's mouth to avenge my dead comrades? Do I cower in terror, hoping that no one will notice me? Do I surrender and trust to the good intentions of the Amadeen Front? Do I simply abandon this\n\nplace, go back to Lurack and say, \"Mission accomplished, Ovjeta. Everything is dead.\" --- I hear a sound from the bunker and I whirl around, my knife at the ready. The heat sensor shows two beings dead in the ragged opening. Further inside are at least six older dead and deep inside are two hot live ones, very close together. I realize I am standing in full view of the bunker, and I squat down, amazed that I am alive. Perhaps the two humans who are alive are wounded. For some reason they didn't take me out when they could. I want to call Anta's name again, see the bodies of my comrades with my own eyes. I rebel at relying on a mere instrument to tell me my comrades are dead. But what would be the purpose? Then, what was ever the purpose of any of it? How can a being tremble in fear of losing its life one moment and care not a dot the next? I stand in full view of the bunker, my weapon held at my side, and walk toward the opening, hardly curious at the form my death will take. At the opening I step over the lip of the hole torn in the wall and walk in. I pause inside and look around. It is still. After six days of battle, there is something obscene about so much silence. It allows too many things to be felt. They stand before me in a row: fear, sadness, outrage, emptiness, and hate. How I long to rest my head upon my parent's lap and beg Yazi Avo to quiet the buzzing in my brain. I take a breath; exhale. Another. It is not the moment before; that moment when I had living friends and living enemies. It is not the moment to come, when whatever it is that I must do has already been done. It is this moment. I squeeze my eyes shut and try to remember something comforting --- something perhaps even useful --- from the Talman. How little of the book I remember. My parent tried to teach me, but it was killed by the Front long before I completed my first year. I keep the golden cube of my parent's Talman suspended from a chain around my neck, but I rarely read it. After all, it was the masters of the Talman Kovah who proved that this war cannot end. No adulthood rites, no presentation before the family archives, not for Yazi Ro. Not for any of us condemned to Amadeen. Two humans are dead on the dusty cement floor at my feet. The older of the two caught the slice of my energy knife through the upper right quadrant of his head. The younger one is almost a child the way humans reckon such things. She was cut in two through the chest. Bodies. Nothing. Two more corpses upon a mountain of dead. There is a golden pendent on a golden chain around the neck of the young one. I expect it to be a cross, that sign of the human prince of peace. I see, instead, the cube of a Talman taken from some dead or captured Drac. My rage paints everything in reds and blinding whites. Instinctively I touch the trigger on my knife and watch as her head rolls free from her torso. I take the chain from the stump of her neck and look at the cube. It carries a line sign, but I do not know it. I look around inside the concrete and steel structure. Nothing but the mounts remain of the crew served weapons that had been bolted to the floor. There are scraps of cloth hanging over the weapon ports. Human curtains. They are made from the tan, white, and red camouflage cloth the humans use. There are chairs very similar to Drac chairs, and a table very similar to the one I ate from before my parent, my siblings, and my home were destroyed so very long ago. The inside is blackened and chipped from weapons firing. I am numb from fatigue and from the\n\npains in my head. I wonder how many human homes and lives I have destroyed. Some things are beyond counting. Something strange about the scene makes me pause. The chipping took place after the fire. The blackening is from burning, probably ignited by an energy knife. The chipping is caused by bullets. The Twelve had no rifles. The rifle fire had to have come from inside. Anta had said the humans might be fighting among themselves. Perhaps that is why so many of them were not in the bunker when we attacked. I take another deep breath, and as I do so I vaguely remember the sensor. I look at it again and the orange dots are now larger, the walls of the bunker reflecting warm from the sun and the energy weapons. Two of the humans are still alive, and the only thing to be served on Amadeen is death. Against the back of the firing gallery is a room. In it are six of the human beds, raised on legs, and draped with cloths. Three of the beds have bodies tossed across them. Three more bodies are crumpled on the floor near them. The ones on the beds carry knife wounds, the slashes and dismemberment unmistakable. The ones on the floor carry bullet wounds. Another room to the left off the gallery is for food preparation. Nothing alive in there. The ones alive are hiding beneath the bed on the far right. I place my weapon between my knees and hold it while I remove my helmet. The room smells foul, the human blood sickeningly sweet. Cement dust is in the air causing light filtering through cracks in the bunker to make dustbeams. The place is filled with greenflies, already feasting upon the pools of red human blood. Strange how the insects have an equal affinity for yellow Drac blood. The Talman says that only form changes, nothing ever dies. It looks like a lot of death to me. I look at the bed beneath which the two humans are hiding. There is a rifle on the tattered sheets, the stock shattered. The readout on my sensor shows one of the humans to be too small to be an adult. Of course, there are also very small humans called dwarfs and midgets who are just as deadly. Still, one of them might be a child. Prisoners? By the bloody book, why burden myself with prisoners? It is so much less complicated if they simply die. Would they take me prisoner, or would they render me into muck and thank their bloody gods. Perhaps they will, instead, kill me. It is time to ride the monster. I hook my helmet onto my weapons belt, the weight off my neck making my head feel light. Holding my knife in my right hand, I place my left beneath the end of the bed. \"Now is when you must kill me,\" I whisper. I flip the bed over and bring my knife up to bear. All I can see is a single form. A human female from what I can see of her back. She is curled into a lump. She is not armed. \"Get up,\" I order in English. \"Get up and face me.\" She doesn't comply. Instead she shakes her head back and forth, a human sign of resistance. \"Get up,\" I repeat. I reach down to grab her shoulder, my knife pointing at her head. Just before I touch her, I hear a baby cry. So easy to have a soft heart. So easy to say, here is a parent and child. Take pity, Ro. What has a mere baby done to you? Have mercy. How many Dracs have had their wombs ripped open, their barely formed children dangled by their umbilicals before the still living eyes of their parents? How many humans have smashed the heads of how many Drac children upon rocks and exchanged money bets upon how far the blood splashes? With all of my strength I grab her shoulder and throw her onto her back, her baby still\n\nclutched in her arms. I lift my knife to cut them both in two, then I see the baby. It is a Drac baby only a few days old. The woman's eyes stare at my face. Tears make her eyes glitter in the half dark. She knows she is about to die. She knows the baby is about to die. \"Please,\" she whimpers. \"Please.\" What about the dead, I want to ask her. What about all of the dead? And how did you acquire a Drac infant, woman? Whose womb did you slit? Filthy, hairy, foul smelling thing, what right do you have to ask pity from me? I say none of it. I gesture toward the infant with my knife and say something very stupid. \"It is not human.\" She shakes her head. \"No,\" she answers. \"It's mine.\" Mine. It's mine. I lower myself until I am sitting cross-legged on the floor, my knife across my knees. A howl begins from inside me, from deep beneath the core of my soul. It expands until it fills every crack and crevice of my being. When the pressure is more than will can contain, it explodes from my mouth. A bellow, a scream, a cry. I cry for them, the human female and the abandoned Drac infant. I cry for the Twelve, for my parent and siblings. I cry for the Planet Amadeen, and for one of its many weary soldiers, Yazi Ro. CHAPTER 2 \"Its name is Suritok Nan. Its parent told me just before it died. Fourth in its line, but its parent told me none of the line names. No one will be able to piece them together now.\" We sit outside the bunker on the rubble, the woman cleaning the face of the Drac child on her lap. I sit watching her, my mind far from a decision about her continued existence. Her skin is smooth and the color of mud, the hair on her head short, black, and curled. She too has ear flaps and that bulb of a human nose, all of those fingers. The Drac child's skin is the color of sunlight, its face smooth, hairless, and puffed with birth fat. I can see, though, that the woman only sees a child; that the child only sees a parent. It is something I cannot even imagine existing, but there it is. I look away. The woman and the child are not the only things that have been left undone. I must find the bodies of my comrades, take their Talmans, destroy their weapons. \"Nan's parent,\" continued the woman, \"it didn't even have time to tell me its own name before it died. The Talman it carried was gone.\" She moves her shoulders and lets her gaze fall. \"Stolen, probably,\" she continues. \"You can get over a hundred tags for a Talman and chain back on the Dorado.\" A hundred tags. Tags are script money issued by the Front. According to captured humans, a hundred tags is enough to buy a melon. So much for eleven thousand years of wisdom. I look at the Talman and chain I had taken from the girl I beheaded. They are still in my hand, a bit of human blood on it. Perhaps this was the one taken from Nan's parent. Probably not. I look again at the woman's face. Why should a human be so concerned about the heritage of a Drac infant? Perhaps her show is for my benefit. She thinks I might let her go. Her and her Drac child. After all, I let her live. So far. Perhaps she will do whatever she thinks will induce my compassion. Humans lie, and sneak, and trick: all skills we have learned from them along with butchery, cruelty, and\n\nhorror. I notice the power switch on my knife is still energized. The weapon's charge is down to fourteen percent. Stupid. Suddenly I am very tired. I want to find a safe, dark place, curl into a ball, wipe my memory, and sleep for a thousand years. I turn off the switch. \"What are you going to do with us?\" A decision seems to make itself. I stand, take a step, and stop next to the pair. Extending my hand, I hold out the Talman and chain to her. \"It probably belongs to another line, but the words are the same.\" Tears, another thing we have in common with the humans, blur my vision. \"The line died with the soldier who carried this.\" She takes it, nods her thanks, and places the chain around the child's neck. I do not ask her if she can read Drac. I stay behind at the crossroads and watch the woman's back as she walks toward the north stepping over the rubble and around the holes, the baby still in her arms. The sun is almost gone, the sky red as the desert dust. I face the west and wonder what I should do. I should make my way back to the Sikov commander and report. They are all dead, Ghah Jov: Anta split from its crotch to its right shoulder by an energy knife; Ki, its pieces splattered across the ground where a rocket's blast carried them; Pina riddled with bullets, the tracks in the sand showing how it dragged itself across the ground before it died; and Adoveyna stretched out on the ground without a mark on its body as though it were sleeping. When I lift Adoveyna I feel the blood on my fingers. Ah, yes. I must report the village of Riehm Vo liberated. I should report as well the woman who I let return to her own people, in addition to the baby Drac I allowed her to take with her. I can imagine Jov's brow rising as it waits for the soldier before it to explain several counts of treason. Should I tell it the woman herself killed two humans who were determined to kill the Drac child? That was the firing Anta had heard when it scouted the position. Should I tell Jov that if I had, instead, brought her with me back to the Sikov, the woman would be executed and the baby thrown into a holding center for children with no lines to await training as future killers for the Mavedah? Jov could not see what was wrong with that. A few days ago I would not be able to see it either. But now I see Nan sleeping in love's arms, a rest so complete all I can do is quench my envy by letting them stay together. I cannot go back to the Sikov or the Mavedah. Let them believe all of us died. I turn and look at the woman in the distance. I believe she can protect the baby from her commanders in the Front, but she could not protect me. I would be killed, or forced to commit treason, and then killed. She stops, turns, and faces me. Lifting a hand, she waves it. A human gesture. I raise a hand and hold it as she faces north again and continues walking, the baby still in her arms. The road turns behind some ruins and she is gone. I lower the hand and look down at the energy knife in my other hand. I should have gotten the name of the woman. Those who change the entire course of a life need to be named. I glance up at the sky and see the sun reflected from one of the several orbiting quarantine stations that ring Amadeen. It hangs in the sky like an evening star. In it sit the humans and Dracs who monitor the instruments that detect and destroy ships that attempt to rise from the surface or attempt to land on the surface from space.\n\nFar beyond that belt of death is where I must find my answers. There are none left on Amadeen. I will not see Jov to report the liberation of all this rubble. I must avoid the Mavedah. Instead, there is a traitor I must see. I pull the control block from the knife, crush it beneath my boot, and throw the knife far from the edge of the road. I turn to the west and walk, leaving my helmet and armor in the dust. CHAPTER 3 Zenak Abi's name is a curse leveled at those who would betray species and line to follow a fantasy. Yet I betray all to which I have sworn to find something my pain tells me must be there. I cross the Mavedah lines in the dark, the sounds of battle coming from the north. There is no challenge. The humans are far away from these posts and moments to sleep too precious. Later, at an unfamiliar settlement where no one recognizes me, I offer a Madah outcast some rations in exchange for information. The vemadah gives me the information I need and fades into the shadows. I gave it the Talmans of my dead comrades and the vemadah will see that their deaths are recorded for the benefit of anyone who might care. Anta's sibling, Trahn, may be still alive. The rest of them, though, came from the holding center for the lineless. The Twelve was their line. In the village of Namdas nestled in the foothills of the Silver Mountains, I see the market where farmers and merchants buy and sell things as though there is no fire in the sky. Namdas has only been hit twice during the past few years, both times by accident; shortfalls of missiles intended for the Mavedah headquarters farther to the east. I think to buy some of the sweet grain cakes there on sale, but I have no money and only my knife to trade. I keep my knife, drink at a well, and take the road into the mountains. As the hot dawn fills the sky, I see the house. It is in the woods above Namdas, high on the slope of Mt. Atahd. The smell of trees fills the air. The house is little more than a rouga, what the humans call a hutch or shack. In the dust outside the shack two Drac children play at killing. \"Nu geph, Irkmaan!\" growls the older child as it brandishes a wooden energy knife made from a drying board. The other child, holding a stick as though it is a rifle, sullenly falls down feigning a welcome death, its release from having to take the role of the human. When it resurrects and demands the exchange of weapons and roles, the older child refuses. A protest, another demand, the name kizlode is hurled followed shortly by a swift kick and the pair grappling in the dust. I am rooted to the spot by a memory of two years past. There was one of many truces in effect. Standing guard on eleven humans, holding them in case the negotiations for the proposed prisoner exchange actually succeed. The humans talk among themselves, one saying that he cannot see how the war can ever end. He tells his companion the wounds are too many, too old, and too deep. He describes how his children and the children of his friends play. For fun they play at killing Dracs the way these children before Neleh Ve's shack play at killing humans. There was no prisoner exchange that time. Tuva Culik, the compound warden, came running from its office, its skin pale with rage. Culik had heard that the humans had begun executing their prisoners. From Culik's belt\n\nthe warden pulled a pulse weapon and fired into the humans. The humans roared and charged the fence. I cut into them with an energy knife. Two other guards joined in and the four of us fired into the eleven unarmed humans until there was nothing left but a lumpy puddle of steaming muck. Afterward, silence. Then another message. It was a false rumor. The humans still honored the agreement. Tuva Culik had been wrong. We had murdered the eleven humans. When the Front heard about what we had done to their comrades, the rumor was righted. The humans executed forty-four soldiers of the Mavedah and the truce was ended. Culik had been proven right after all. \"Tuka nue!\" commands an adult voice weary with scolding. The children halt their war and face a Drac adult who is holding a bundle of hand washed clothes in its arms. It carries no weapons. \"Neleh Ve?\" I ask. Its eyes, the lids narrowed, study me for a moment. Without removing its gaze from my eyes, the Drac gestures with its head toward the house and says to the children, \"Tean, benga.\" With the children in the shack, the Drac shifts the washing, resting it on a hip, leaving its right arm free. \"I am Neleh Ve.\" \"Yazi Ro,\" I answer. \"It is good to see children again.\" \"The battle cry of the childless,\" says Neleh Ve without changing expression. \"Is there something you want?\" \"I look for the Jetah Talman, Zenak Abi.\" Amusement touches Ve's lips. \"What use has a soldier of the Mavedah with a master of paths?\" \"Perhaps the path of the Mavedah no longer serves me.\" I frown at Ve and invite a wound with my question. \"I have no weapons, no armor. How do you know I was Mavedah?\" \"Your eyes, Yazi Ro. They belong to a killer.\" I take the wound and add it to my collection. \"Zenak Abi,\" I repeat. \"Where may I find the Jetah?\" Ve gestures with its head toward the mountain. \"Up there somewhere.\" I look up at the mountain, its peaks capped with snow. \"It is a big mountain. Is there a particular trail I should follow?\" \"Go and if Abi wants to talk with you, it will find you. Be warned, though, that the Jetah can defend itself.\" \"I mean the Jetah no harm. I only seek information.\" \"So said many who sought to slay the traitor.\" Neleh Ve turns and begins spreading its wash on the drying boards. I am dismissed. Neleh Ve has no reason to believe differently about me. There is no reason why I should concern myself about what it thinks. I feel the need, though. I\n\nfeel the need to tell Ve that I am no longer one of them. My only proof, though, is that I have killed no one today. I aim my steps up the mountain as the children in the shack resume their pretend killing. I still hear their voices as I turn on my receiver and listen to a little zidydrac before the music is interrupted to inform us that the village of Riehm Vo has been retaken by the Front. I think about the dead woman I beheaded and know that I have added luster to some Amadeen Front soldier's resolve to exterminate every Drac from the face of the planet. As the music returns, I place the receiver on a rock and leave it there, the music fading as I climb. There are trees on the mountain, great towering things with craggy black skin and reddish green leaves as wide as my hand is long. Among the rocks and grasses are flowers, berry bushes, and blossoming vines that reach high into the trees. The air is cooler and there is a breeze. I can hear the sounds of battle, but they are distant, not as loud as the dark brown furred shade nit at my feet. Its sound is a chip-chip and it sits within a thicket on its hind legs, its thin black tail wrapped around its legs, making its sound, warning me not to approach. I search my pockets. The creature defends its territory. It is not begging me for ancient battle rations. Still, I find an end of ration bar, pinch off a piece, and toss it to the nit. It springs back, increases its cry in volume, and paws at the air with its front legs. I back away a step and, after a moment, the creature quiets, leans forward and sniffs at the piece of food. Darting out to pick it up, the nit rushes back to the safety of the deep thicket. As it eats I turn and look around me. Something inside me is outraged at this corner of Amadeen that has missed the warring. Where is the justice that claimed the lives of Anta, Ki, Pina, and Adoveyna, yet lets a bloody shade nit live? I cross my legs and sit where I am. I have no argument with justice. I lost my belief in such things long before my parent died. My argument is with reality. My comrades should not be dead. Instead we should all be here on the side of this mountain, cooling ourselves in the shade, tossing bits of food to the nits. There is a pain in me so intense that I cannot afford to let it claim me. Suddenly I feel something dig into my back. \"I see I have a visitor,\" says a voice from behind me. \"Let me see your hands, child, and do not clutter them with weapons, I beg you.\" I sit up and hold my hands out to my sides as I condemn myself as a fool. \"Zenak Abi?\" I ask. With steps as silent as the mist, it moves slowly around me until I can see it. The Drac is old but looks to be strong. It wears pieces of camouflage uniforms, human trousers, a Drac jacket and boots, a soft human brimmed hat. All that remains of a Talman master's robe, the blue stripe at the hem, it wears draped around its neck. In its hands it holds a long walking stick. \"I am Abi. Who might you be?\" I lower my hands to my sides and climb to my feet. \"I am Yazi Ro.\" I think for a moment and then add, \"I used to serve in the Mavedah. The Okori Sikov of the Ninth Shordan.\" The old one's brow rises in amusement. \"Eh, a proud band, the Okori Sikov.\" Abi lowers the end of its staff to the ground. Grasping it with both hands, the Jetah rests its weight on it. \"And what is a hero of the Okori Sikov doing so far from the fighting?\" I feel the heat coming to\n\nmy face. \"Your mockery is out of place, old one. I come here for answers, not to provide you with entertainment.\" It grins at me, the broken edge of its upper mandible quite visible. \"Perhaps I cannot remember the answers,\" Yazi Ro, \"unless I am entertained.\" I turn, see the trunk of a fallen tree, and go to it. I sit down, cross my arms, and rest my elbows on my knees. I do this to avoid slitting open the old fool with the knife hidden in my boot. I feel twice the fool for coming here. Perhaps my questions have no answers. Abi squats down before me, leans the stick between its neck and shoulder, and studies me. The longer the Jetah stares at me, the more foolish I feel. Just as I am about to rise and flee from the mountain, Abi says, \"What is your question, soldier? Ask it honestly and I will provide you with an answer as honest as your question.\" I remain quiet as my anger wrestles with my thoughts leaving nothing clear. My question? Who knows what my question is? Why is there a war? Why is peace impossible? Why was I born into the center of this holocaust? Why are my comrades dead? Why is my parent dead? Why is life and the world excrement? I can feel the tears dribble down my face. My question. What is my question? My mind is blanked by the futility of it all. \"Very well, old fool. Why do you wear human trousers?\" Zenak Abi's face becomes very serious. It nods once, then levels its gaze at me. \"The purpose, child,\" Abi says in English, \"is to cover my ass.\" I am stunned, then I laugh. Through this crack in my grief all of the laughter I had confined for years exploded. When I could see again, Zenak Abi, too, was laughing. CHAPTER 4 Abi leads me high up the mountain, deep into the frozen cleft between two peaks where the boulders stand on the ground like so many frost giants. The snow is fresh and ankle deep. I am not used to the cold and I feel my muscles growing numb, my thoughts coming slow and thick. It is the beginning of dark by the time we reach the entrance to Abi's cave. Before I enter I look down from the mountain toward the east. There the gentle hills of the Shorda spread to the horizon. Dull glows of red and orange beneath the haze show the death machines have not yet run out of fuel. They make me feel the fool yet again. So much blood, so much pain, so many years. If the fighting could have been stopped others would have stopped it long ago. Who is Yazi Ro to stop a war? Ro who still has bloody hands. I turn and enter the cave, pulling the cover cloth down behind me. Inside it is much warmer. We sit on boxes and other containers salvaged from some ruin. One side of my container is cut, allowing me to sit on a springy seat of leafy branches and rest my back against the side opposite. Abi cooks cakes on the griddle it has made, filling the chamber with the smells of wood smoke and sweet spice. \"Have you heard anything about the new truce?\" I ask. \"There have been rumors. Nothing from the broadcast stations. Some say a rumor is all it is.\" Abi slides two of the cakes onto a large leaf and hands them to me. \"Before the truce could be signed, the Tean Sindie attacked the negotiation site, took everyone hostage, executed all of the humans, and admonished the Mavedah negotiators never again to negotiate with the monsters of the Front. Some tea?\" The Tean Sindie;\n\nchildren of the racehome world; the \"pure Mavedah\" whom no one seems able to control. They could have let the truce happen for a few days. Just a few. I eat my cakes hot, allowing the warmth to radiate from my center to my limbs. It is quiet in the cave. Safe. I do not feel that I have to stand guard every second. Next to life on the dirt, the security I feel within that frozen mountain is strangely obscene. With my belly full and my muscles relaxed for the first time since the founding, I put the Tean Sindie, truces, and Amadeen out of my mind and let sleep overtake me. At first I awaken, see Abi sitting on its crate, then drowse as images of love and war flit through the edges of my perception. A last look at Abi reading a book, then I give in, too weary to resist my dreams. \"The Selector,\" hisses a voice. Choi Leh stands there above the children paying no attention to the sounds of firing outside. Leh is massive, a horrible burn scar on the left side of its face, its left arm limp and dead at its side. Choi Leh's leather clothes and boots are worn, his armor and weapon scarred. Ravin Nis, the Jetah of the lineless children, watches Choi Leh, eager to please, terrified not to. We all want to please the Selector, but our reasons are different. If we are chosen to fill the ranks of the Mavedah, we will eat. Leh steps down from the dais and begins to walk among us, its stride long, and determined. The word passes among the children in whispers: \"Mavedah. Mavedah.\" \"This one,\" says Leh nodding toward Vulrih Apisa, the largest of us. Hateful Apisa is cruel and a bully, but now its face is proud. \"See here,\" says its expression. \"I was the first chosen. I do matter. I am something.\" Ravin Nis takes Apisa by the arm and points toward the dais. \"This one,\" says Choi Leh, pointing at another, Nis following with whispered instructions to go to the dais. Choi Leh picks four more, then pauses before Bikudih Ri. Ri is small but eager to please. Leh lifts its good arm and smacks Ri's head, sending the child to the floor. Choi Leh waits a moment watching Ri cry then moves on. At last Choi Leh stands in front of me. I know I am very young, not as large as most, and the Mavedah Selector must doubt me. There will be a test. It looks down at me, its burns more horrible now that they are close. \"My face,\" it growls. \"Do you see something in it?\" \"It is burned,\" I answer, still looking into its eyes. They are dark, more brown than yellow. \"Do you find it beautiful?\" Leh asks. \"I find it ugly.\" Choi Leh takes a swing at my head, I squat, and as the arm flashes above my head, I drive my head into Leh's middle, right where I think its belly slit is. Leh cries out as it falls to the floor on its backside. Leh holds its middle, gasps, springs to its feet, and gives me another look. \"This one,\" Leh tells Ravin Nis, then the Selector moves on. .. I awaken, sit up and look all around for threats. There is no one but the Jetah Talman, Zenak Abi. It is still reading, but it speaks. \"It is time, Yazi Ro, to ask me your question. The one that is not\n\nabout my trousers.\" I lean forward, rub my face, and take a breath. Letting the breath escape, I lean back in the chair. Question. Do I even have a question? \"I am not certain what to ask, Jetah.\" Abi marks the book with a strip of blue cloth, closes it, and places it on his lap. Its eyes search me out. \"What do you know of me?\" \"You are insane and a traitor.\" The Jetah's brow mounts a puzzled frown. \"I would think, Ro, that I cannot be both.\" I look down and clasp my hands together. It is not important, I think. They are only words; the most traitorous things of all. \"Jetah, it is said that before there was a war, you lived with the humans.\" \"True. Many of us did. The university they had in Hulon on the Dorado continent was Amadeen's largest center of learning before the war. I taught there and had many human friends, teachers, and students. Does that make me a traitor?\" \"No.\" I lean forward and point with my hands at the air. \"I cannot imagine such a time.\" Abi holds a hand to its chin and purses its lips. \"You carry your years like a chain. How many? Ten, eleven?\" \"I am seven, Jetah.\" \"Seven,\" repeats Abi, shaking its head after the manner of a human. \"When I was your age I had already graduated from the Talman Kovah in Sendievu.\" \"On Draco?\" I ask in surprise. Everyone I had ever known had been born on Amadeen. \"Of course. I came to Amadeen at the age of nine. That was eleven years before the war.\" Abi grins at me. \"You look astonished, Yazi Ro.\" I frown as I do my addition. \"You must be over fifty years old!\" \"Fifty-three on Draco. A little older in Amadeen years. My age doesn't set any records.\" I stand and pace before Abi. \"Almost everyone I know is under ten. My parent was killed when it was only four. There are a few Mavedah warmasters in their twenties. One warmaster I met, Olta Cius, was twenty-nine at the time. It was the oldest Drac I ever met, until now.\" Zenak Abi wipes a hand over the top of its head, sighs, and says, \"We have established, Yazi Ro, that I am insane, traitorous, and terribly ancient. However, at this pace we will both be too old to retain a coherent thought by the time you get to your point.\" I halt my pacing and look down at the Jetah. \"Then, here it is. I have heard two things in the camps. First, it is said that when Zenak Abi studied the paths it did not see all paths locking Amadeen into this war. It is said you found a talma to peace.\" Abi rubbed its chin and held up a single finger. \"Half true. All paths do not prove this war necessary. I proved no path to peace, however.\" \"There must be a way!\n\nThere must be an end to this.\" \"I would like to think so, young one,\" Abi says in a mocking tone. \"Still, there is nothing that raises your fervent 'must' to the level of scientific possibility.\" I see Abi's amused face and ask myself: is the world nothing but bloody games played with pain-filled living pieces? My frustration overcomes any pretense at old-fashioned courtesy. \"You and your blue stripe have had thirty-two years, you old wheeze! What have you been doing all this time?\" I find our faces only a handlength apart and feel something poking me in my middle. I look down and Abi is holding one of the human projectile hand guns. It is pointed at me. I stand and take a step back. \"Sit down in the chair, Yazi Ro. You will find it much more comfortable.\" I do not move. \"Very well, I will find it more comfortable. Sit!\" commands the Jetah, brandishing the pistol. I sit in the chair, my gaze on Abi's eyes. The Jetah smiles, aims the gun at his own head, and pulls the trigger. A click, and nothing. \"Out of ammunition,\" it says, almost in apology. \"To answer your question, what I have been doing for the past thirty-two years is trying to keep myself and a few friends alive. We've spent the decades one step ahead of the agents of the Mavedah and the Amadeen Front, hiding in places such as this.\" \"I found you easily enough.\" Abi smiles and says, \"If you will invoke your vast powers of memory, Yazi Ro, you will, I think, recall that it was I who found you.\" Abi gestures with its gun at the walls of the cave. \"As for my work, Yazi Ro, where do I hang my charts? Where are my screens, my computers, my colleagues and assistants, my subspace link to the Talman Kovah? All of this time, young one, you had a better chance at achieving peace than did I.\" \"Peace?\" I ask, even more confused. Abi nods as it tucks the useless weapon within its jacket. \"You could have put down your weapon and stopped killing. That would have decreased the number of dead bodies you have been generating. I couldn't even do that because I wasn't killing anyone. What is the second thing you heard?\" The rumors my comrades would pass among one another as we would sit talking around a faltering glow disk at night. Are they all only words? Audio blips with which we fill time until the next mission? Is this the monster, the thief of victory, of our discussions? \"I heard, Zenak Abi, that you know a way through the blockade. You know how I can get off Amadeen.\" Finally I get the old fool's attention. It clasps its hands and crosses its legs after the manner of a human. \"If I could perform such a miracle, Yazi Ro, where might you go? What would you do? A vacation? Perhaps some shopping in Sendievu?\" The answer came to me as I spoke the words. \"I would go to Draco, stand before the Jetai Diea at the Talman Kovah, and demand they find an end to war for this sorry world.\" \"Ah, peace is it? And would you kill to achieve this, little Niagat?\" Again I feel the heat coming\n\nto my face. \"I am not here to trade myths from The Talman, you old. . . one. What I will do to achieve peace is my concern alone.\" Again Zenak Abi mocks me with its smile. \"There are many who would be clean of Amadeen, Yazi Ro. Parents, both human and Drac, who want their children safe. There are the wounded who cannot get the treatment they need. There are all of those who are starving, multitudes who no longer want to wallow in death. Supposing that I can perform this miracle, why should I ignore their pleas in favor of yours?\" \"Zenak Abi, the danger, the wounding, the starvation will all end come the peace.\" \"Come the peace.\" Abi stands and walks until it is standing over me, its face no longer mocking. \"And you, young killer, the blood of humans still on your hands, are you the one to convince the Ovjetah and the gentle masters of the Talman Kovah that they are mistaken? That their years of study, training, and experience are for nothing? That they simply overlooked a path that you in your youthful ignorance and brash pride have found? The Talman Kovah advises the political, business, military, scientific, and philosophical institutions of hundreds of worlds, and here comes a ragged Mavedah killer, barely an adult but bereft of adulthood, to demand that they accomplish that which they already know to be impossible. Tell me, Yazi Ro, why they would even allow you within sight of the front entrance?\" I turn my face away from the Jetah and look into a deep shadow. A thousand times I am the fool. In the center of my being there is this conviction that the horror on Amadeen is so wrong, in itself that should force a path into existence, a talma along which Amadeen can achieve peace. A thousand times a fool. On the edge of my lips is the word \"unfair.\" This war, the horrors, the impossibility of peace, unfair, unfair. I do not say this aloud, for doing so would invite another little homily from The Talman. I do not remember the story or from which koda it comes. Something about one of Maltak Di's little games. One of the lessons of the story, though, is that a belief in fairness is evidence of either brain damage or stupidity. Tears again. Perhaps there is no end to this. My parent, my friends, my comrades are dead, in a parade of corpses with many regiments yet to follow. Do I rejoin the parade or hide like Zenak Abi on some mountaintop? Can I live knowing so many are dead, so many are dying? My ghosts would sing too loudly in a place as peaceful as this cave. It is from the humans we learned about ghosts. No kovah, steeped in scientific path detection, would accept a fancy such as ghosts. Yet I have heard them. I see them now. I care for no one's opinions on what I know until that one has carried its own blade on Amadeen. Abi places its hand upon my head, and it is warm. \"Lean back,\" he commands. \"Lean back and relax. I'll introduce you to a little something I picked up from a human.\" I lean away from the Jetah's hand and frown at its smiling face. \"What are you going to do?\" \"There is a problem with you. Perhaps I can help.\"\n\n\"A disease?\" I ask. Abi laughs, thinks for a moment, then says, \"Perhaps something worse, Ro. First, I am going to relax you. Next I may find a way for you to achieve your greatest wish. Somewhere along this path I will probably get you killed. Now lie back and relax.\" Peace or death. Either one is more attractive than the present. I lean back, close my eyes, and allow the soft strokes of the Jetah's hand to lull me toward a strange sleep. Long before I get there I hear a strange noise: a motion of leather across paving stones. I try to move, to place myself at the ready, but I cannot move. I am helpless before my own thoughts. CHAPTER 5 There is a gray light that becomes a mist swirling around the trunks of trees, reaching upward toward me. It surrounds me and the features of everything fade into oblivion. I try to call out, but there is no sound. There is a smudge of yellow deep within the mist. I stare at it and watch it grow until a horizon appears, the outlines of humble dwellings etched against the clouds. I am back in Gitoh, watching as the blades of green light reach to burn another human gunship from the sky. The grating sounds of the alarm blocks seem to vibrate my bones. \"Ro! Ni tean! Ro!\" My parent rushes into the room and jerks me away from the window. In the center of our home, Yazi Avo cries and speaks angrily to me. It pulls me to its chest, squeezes me tightly, and nuzzles my neck. \"I am sorry, Ro. I was so frightened. Please listen. When the alarm blocks sound, you must stay away from the windows and doors.\" I tell Avo that I am all right and nothing will happen to me. The fighting was far off. I won't get hurt in my own home. Later I learn that my friend Idoh watched almost the entire battle from its window before a stray pulse from the gunship turned Idoh into pulp. There are moments with my parent, reading and reading again our three old books, an embrace, sleeping safe in the arms of Yazi Avo. On the edge of the new spring comes The Battle of Gitoh, so many Amadeen Front soldiers cutting through us because only a few Mavedah were there to serve the air defense weapons. The smoke, screams, and flames. The silence. Pushing Avo's lifeless body off of my own. Only a charred corner from one of Avo's books remains. I cry my cries and I cannot understand how anyone, Drac or human, can listen and not take pity on the children. Long after my cries end, a soldier of the Mavedah comes and takes me to a track wagon. There are other children in it. All of us are alone. When the track begins moving, taking us out of Gitoh, no one says anything to us. A few of us huddle together and cry. Most of us sit watching, waiting for the next horror, hoping the next time to be better prepared. The kovah for lineless children, the Selector before us. The terrors of training, the endless battles, fights, attacks, ambushes, maimed and dead comrades, the few I know and the multitude I do not. I carry my own knife into the cries of human children. I see them, their\n\nlarge dark eyes filled with tears, their faces twisted with grief. They cry their cries and they cannot understand how anyone, human or Drac, can listen and not take pity on the children. There is nothing to be served by trying to explain to them. They will have to learn for themselves. There is a broken doll in the dust before the burning fortifications at Butaan Ji. A little girl a step away, her dead eyes staring up at the sun. A man sitting next to her, singing strange words in a cracked voice. The pain in the song's words need no translator. He turns his head and looks at me, his eyes wet, pleading, his voice forcing out the song. He is not wounded and he has a weapon. The weapon remains on his lap. I lift my knife and give him a splash through his chest. He falls to the ground dead and I wonder why he did not try to save himself. In my mind I still hear the song he sang. The night mission to attack Steel Town on the Dorado, looking down from the exit bay of the ancient combat flyer. The surface below is covered with clouds but they illuminate here, there, and here again as explosions below make the clouds glow. In the distance there are other glows, and still more. Wherever I look down upon Amadeen it is exploding or burning, and we are to go into that. As we begin our dive, Pina reaches out and holds my hand. The nameless commander of another unit sees us and looks away, something guilty in its eyes. The woman at the bunker and her Drac infant. A field of death and destruction, a killer of the Mavedah who can no longer kill for a continuation of this madness. The infant's name is Suritok Nan. The woman did not tell me her name. I let her go no longer able to see what I had to see to kill. What will her little Drac infant become? Perhaps it will be the key to a future peace between the Dracs and humans. Perhaps it will invent a potion that renders all species into the same family. More than likely it and its human mother were killed within moments of leaving me. In my center I see things of mine. Love is a small thing. Pity smaller still. Hate is larger. It is a mountain, its crest black against a sky of fire. Towering above it, though, is this thing that makes me sick, the thing that makes me stupid, less than an adult. It is a lumbering, clumsy, raging monster bellowing \"Look at the suffering, the waste! Things should not be this way! It's unfair!\" This is what makes Yazi Ro a fool. If I get to Draco and stand before the Talman Kovah, putting this planet's pain on display for the masters, is there anything I can achieve other than laughter or impatience? I will only howl at reality and thrash myself bloody upon its disinterested plane. What can there be left, then, for Amadeen? The mist clears, returning me to Zenak Abi's cave. There is an ache in my eyes, the taste of dust in my mouth. There is a man before me. He is short and very serious-looking. He stands next to the Jetah, both of them warming themselves at the fire. They are discussing me yet their words come from very far away. A feeling fills my throat. The human. There is something very wrong with Zenak Abi talking with a\n\nhuman as if they are old comrades. The Jetah holds a small package. The human holds a smaller package. I sit up as the wrongness of what I see becomes clear. The human is standing there without guilt. He is not cowed, apologetic, filled with remorse, wary, nothing to suggest the weight of the crimes he carries or the awful debt he owes to the Dracs in the chamber. A part of my intellect knows that it is possible that this particular human might be innocent of any crimes. This particle of reason, though, cannot weigh against the universe of my hate. And still they talk. The sense of their words has to do with sending Yazi Ro -me -- to Draco. There must be a confusion, but they repeat it: Yazi Ro to go to Draco. \"Why?\" I try to ask, but my word is slurred, sounding like the whimper of one of the dogs the humans brought to Amadeen. Abi faces me. \"Eh, you are back on Amadeen, are you? Take a few deep breaths, Ro. Work your muscles. You've had a sedative.\" \"Sed --?\" I push myself up from the chair, my arms and legs strangely heavy and slow to respond to my commands. \"What sedative?\" I grasp the back of the chair as the chamber seems to whirl. The feeling passes and soon my head clears. \"This should be plenty,\" says the man holding the smaller package, a thick envelope. \"The price has been going down as the demand falls off.\" \"Yazi Ro,\" says Abi, \"this is Thomas. He is going to arrange for you to go to Draco.\" The world takes on another spin and I drop back into the chair. \"Draco?\" The things that went through my mind are still with me. \"Why?\" I gesture with suddenly numb fingers toward my head. \"This thing that happened, the dream, it showed me what a useless gesture going to Draco is.\" I look around feeling that perhaps my head is none too clear. \"What happened to me?\" I point at the brown thing with the serious expression. \"Why this human? What is he doing here?\" \"In answer to one of your questions,\" says Thomas, \"it's called mind fusion. In an electro-chemical sense Zenak Abi's brain and yours became one for a moment.\" He removes a small silver disk from his jacket pocket and shows it to me. \"This is the gadget. It's a neural field amplifier.\" Replacing the disk in his pocket, he says, \"The sedative should wear off in a couple of minutes.\" \"I took nothing. No sedative.\" Abi holds up its hand. \"I applied it when I stroked your head.\" I should feel outraged but I am too tired, too confused. The Jetah of peace carries a gun and drugs those who seek its help. When I want to go to Draco, I cannot. Now that there is no purpose, I can. Perhaps this is a test; some sort of examination to see if I am worthy to join their cult. If I pass the test I get to join some secret society of the fungus-brained. Abi and the human shake hands and upon the completion of the human ritual, Thomas leaves the chamber. The Jetah adds some wood to the small fire and speaks to me. \"I apologize, Yazi Ro, for administering the sedative without your permission. It was\n\nnecessary for me to see as you see. I needed to know if I can trust you.\" \"Trust me? For what? A voyage to Draco? There is no reason to go to Draco.\" I hold my hands to my head. \"Is that not the lesson in this dream you and the human thrust into my brain?\" Abi turns from the fire and studies me for moment. As the Jetah thinks, it walks to its chair and sits. Abi clasps its hands together and leans forward, resting its elbows on its lap. \"We put nothing into your head, Ro. The process allows you to have singularly instructive dreams. What the amplifier allowed me to do was to take your neural event field and place it within mine. It enabled me to remember, see, and feel as do you. As to your question, it is pointless for you to go before the Talman Kovah and threaten to throw a tantrum if they don't discover a path to peace. That is what your own brain told itself, and I agree.\" \"Then what?\" I ask, gesturing with my hand toward the entrance through which the human withdrew. \"Why would you and this friend of yours have me go to Draco?\" Abi looks at the package in its hands. \"There is a chance, Ro. I do not have the means to ascertain how slim a chance it is, but there is a chance for this peace you want. Before the quarantine cut me off from communication with the Talman Kovah, my work showed that there are event chains that are not proven to end in war.\" I shake my head. \"I don't know enough about anything to see any light in that.\" The Jetah mentally pushes aside a mountain of explanation with a wave of its hand. \"There is a chance for this peace. Bring my work to the kovah and suggest they consider it in the light of the new book of the Talman accepted by the Three Hundred and Eleventh Jetai Diea, there is a chance.\" \"The Talman? A new book?\" I almost wanted to laugh. I waved my golden cube at the Jetah. \"Here you are excited over one more myth being tossed on the pile. I thought I was a fool until I met you, you old wind.\" Zenak Abi leans back in its chair, studies me for a moment. \"This myth just might interest you, young one. It was written about us -- those on Amadeen -and it was written by a human.\" I look down at the golden cube of pages that I wear because of a weakness: a vague attachment to my parent. The Talman, book of paths, the stories of Dracs from the advent of a god of fire eleven thousand years ago to what? The Jetai Diea, the most brilliant Talman scholars and scientists that exist, have added a new story to The Talman. A story written by a human. On proper Drac worlds, where rites of adulthood still are conducted, the young have to memorize it and be able to recite this new koda as part of the rites of adulthood. What does a human have to say that is worth memorizing by countless future generations of Dracs? \"Zenak Abi, what is the name of this new koda? It would be the Koda Nusinda, correct?\" \"Yes. The book has been entered by the Jetai Diea as the Koda Nusinda, The Eyes of Joanne Nicole.\"\n\n\"Do your mysterious sources say what is so special about this particular human's eyes?\" The Jetah puts on that mocking smile once more. \"I am told she was blind and, therefore, could see better than the Ovjetah of the Talman Kovah.\" \"Blind.\" I stare at the Jetah while my mind envisions my presentation before the Jetai Diea. Here is what I have for you today, my masters: the work of a demented old traitor with outdated files and no equipment, inspired by a blind human, and brought to you by a Mavedah killer who never stood the rites yet who knows that the effort is wasted before it begins. Too often my bitterness does my thinking for me. \"What was so special about her eyes, Zenak Abi?\" \"She saw the path to end the war between the Dracon Chamber and the United States of Earth.\" \"Leaving just one minor loose end,\" I added. \"Amadeen.\" Zenak Abi looked into the flames of his fire for a moment and says, \"Her name was Joanne Nicole. This woman took a quadrant-wide war that was killing billions and left one that was killing thousands. She entered with hundreds of worlds at war and departed with one world at war with itself. For this she was branded an enemy by the Dracs, a traitor by the humans, and imprisoned. Your sneers will be of more meaning when you, Yazi Ro, have done as much.\" I close my eyes and wonder at the currents and eddies of the universe, swirling and tossing fragments of life this way and that, toward ends that are forever unknowable. Am I tied to this new book of The Talman and to the humans? How is that combination tied to peace on Amadeen, if it is. Or is it all a wish, something of vapor that will vanish with the first breeze? I sigh and let my hands rest upon my lap. \"What would you have me do, Abi?\" Abi holds up its package. It is not much larger than a book and wrapped in waterproofed colthi skin. \"Bring my work to the Talman Kovah. When you return to Amadeen, bring me a copy of the Koda Nusinda, The Eyes of Joanne Nicole.\" \"Bring it back to Amadeen?\" I ask, my brows climbing my forehead. \"If I should make it to Draco what makes you think the dirt of this planet would ever again see my shadow?\" The Jetah turns its head and looks once more into the flames. \"You'll come back, Yazi Ro. There is nothing more certain.\" CHAPTER 6 At night another human called Rick Macfarland and a young Drac named Dulo Rin guide me along frozen, wind carved trails until we cross the mountain. Toward the dying stars the rest of the Silver Mountain range reaches to the horizon, each pair of glistening peaks enclosing a tiny sanctuary where a few beings, Drac and human, subsist in relative peace. Here and there on the mountain sides and in the patches of\n\nvalley green, are the scars left by bombs, knife slashes, and fires. I see many scars in various stages of healing, though, the feathery pillow trees and lace vines softening the sharp broken edges of destruction. In time Amadeen can heal itself, if the beings upon it somehow end the horror. After a few hours climbing down, we are again in trees. At a place half of the way down the mountain I see a small settlement through the trees, shacks and hootches hidden by brush among the trees, Dracs and humans living together, their children playing. The children are still playing at war, but there are both Dracs and humans on each side of the battle; progress of a sort. These are the friends Zenak Abi talked about trying to keep alive. Deep in the woods I see eyes watching us. There are armed guards throughout the forest. Dracs and humans. Could it be possible that Dracs and humans used to live and work together? Would it be possible for them to do so again? Does peace require that I erase from my mind all of the horrors I have witnessed? Can Black October put aside the assassination of Amadeen Front Chairman Gordon Rose? And the slaughter of Rose's mate? And his three little girls? Can the Mavedah or Tsien Sindie forgive the gutting of the Amadeen Chamber deputies? The Ft. Lewis Massacre? The death of Yazi Avo? There is a small voice in the back of my brain. It asks me, \"Are you worthy, Yazi Ro?\" I know the voice. It is Dekiban Lo, Jetah of the Nokbuk Kovah, the Mavedah training academy where the Selector sent the lineless children it chose. One would gasp with exertion, and Lo would be in the poor kiz's ear with, \"Are you worthy, Mikla Namik?\" Another would cry in pain, and Lo would shout, \"Nias Toh, are you worthy?\" One would drop from exhaustion and Lo would whisper, \"Are you worthy, Yazi Ro?\" There is a mission before me, one more in an endless line of missions. I have time, however, to judge this one before I perform it. Is this effort to bring peace to Amadeen or is it just to risk my life in a meaningless attempt to achieve a fantasy? If it is the latter, then it is no more than what I have already done countless times. If it is the former, there is still that question without an answer: Are you worthy, Yazi Ro? There is the whine of an assault lander. As it falls slowly from the night sky, it shows no lights. I reach out and tap Dulo Rin's shoulder. It turns, Rin's features barely visible in the starlight. I point toward the sound and the Drac turns back and continues down the trail. \"That is your ride,\" it says. \"We must hurry. They won't wait forever.\" As we approach the small lander, there is a question in my heart. Who are the corrupt ones from the quarantine force that will take me off Amadeen? Will they be human or Drac? I have seen humans trade and barter among themselves and with the Mavedah soldiers who guarded them. Humans are corrupt and corruptible by nature. They shamelessly offer bribes to anyone who might serve their wants. I cannot imagine that kind of corruption in a Drac. As we approach the open ramp of the lander's entrance I can see three beings at the bottom of the ramp. There are no lights showing. Rick hands the thick envelope to one of them, then fades into the shadows. I look around for his Drac companion but Dulo Rin is gone. Two of the lander's crew turn, walk up the ramp, and enter. \"Are you the passenger?\" asks the one with the envelope. \"Yes,\" I answer. The one with the envelope holds out a hand toward the ramp and I begin climbing toward the\n\ndarkness of the lander's interior, satisfied somehow because the extended hand was human. Inside the remaining two members of the crew greet me with impenetrable expressions and impatient gestures. They are Dracs. I am to hide in a compartment beneath the floor plates in the small cargo bay. There is a plastic foam mattress and a blanket at the bottom of the compartment. There is a plastic container for water and another for waste. \"These are our bargain no-frills accommodations,\" says one of the Dracs. The other picks up a floor plate from where it was leaning against the bulkhead and says in English, \"Hop in and I'll check with the captain about the in flight movie.\" I do not understand their jokes and I do not join them in their laughter. I would not laugh in any event. They are Dracs, corrupt, and I am filled with shame. As I sit on the foam mattress, the two Dracs and one of the humans slip the plates into the deck and bolt them down, the noise hurting my head. When the silence comes it is dark and I am left alone with my fears. Will these corrupt humans and Dracs simply dump me in space, divide their dishonest gains and never be discovered in their murder? Will I be captured by the quarantine force and be punished? If there is trouble with the flight, will anyone have the time to remove the deck bolts and set me free? If I make it to Draco, will I be ignored, my pleas to address the Talman Kovah disregarded? Or will I be scorned and cast out as one who never stood the rites before its line's archives? I feel a vibration through the mattress, and soon a sharp whine assaults my hearing. My hands cover the sides of my head, but the whine seems to come from everywhere. A sudden jolt followed by a brain numbing roar, and I feel myself being pushed into the plastic foam. Soon I cannot hold up my head and my arms feel as though they are made out of stone. Still the pressure increases until I cry out from the pain. With all my strength I push myself until I fall over on my side. I fall on the foam but with such force my head feel like a split melon. I am paralyzed for an eternity, my breaths ragged and shallow, the air growing deadly cold, the blanket out of reach. Am I worthy? This is no longer my question. I have never been in space before and I think I am going to die. CHAPTER 7 At the orbiter, feeling more dead than alive, the two Dracs drag me out of the hidden compartment, dress me in a brown one-piece uniform, and smuggle me out of the lander as part of the lander crew. Without speaking they hurry me through passageways, down stairs, across hanger decks, and through more passageways. In moments I am in a pale green uniform disguised as a member of the orbiter crew. A Drac and a human I do not recognize take me through more passageways until we reach a gigantic hanger deck housing a sleek black swept-winged craft five times longer than the lander. The human pulls me into an alcove and holds out a black and gray uniform while the Drac takes turns at preparing some kind of identity badge and keeping watch. \"Do you have any skills?\" asks the Drac. \"We need to place you in the crew.\" I think for a moment and say, \"I know how to kill and stay alive.\" The Drac smuggler gives me a cold look and the human interrupts by asking, \"You can do maintenance on all kinds of Drac sidearms, can't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, as well as a considerable variety of human weapons.\" Another cold look, this time from the human. The Drac enters a number of codes into my badge, tests them with a small light set into a stick, and nods at the human. The human faces me and says, \"My friend here has diddled with the data and entered you as a member of the crew of the Tora Soam.\" The Tora Soam. The ship is named for the most destructive Drac traitor who ever carried Aydan's Blade. What insanity could cause such a bizarre misapplication of honor? \"Do you understand?\" urges the human. \"Yes. Where is this ship?\" I ask. \"Off station.\" Seeing my look of confusion, he points toward one of the view ports. \"Out there, in orbit with the station about a hundred klicks away. Gavey klicks?\" \"I understand.\" He nods his head toward the ship that fills the hanger deck. Several dignitaries and their attendants are standing together, talking and waiting. \"This is one of the Soam's shuttles. When the crew starts to board, we'll attach you to a friend of ours who'll get you on board and settled in. Our friend has found you an open slot to fill. In case anyone asks, tell them your real name and that you are in Maintenance Six, Ordinance. This's a diplomatic ship to Draco -- only couriers and paper wizards -- so nobody should need your services. You'll have your own quarters and rations, so stay out of sight, keep your mouth shut, and you'll do fine.\" The smugglers' friend is Binas Pahvi, one of the Tora Soam's fourth officers. The money Zenak Abi paid for my passage does not exchange hands. Instead the human hands Pahvi a heavy container of Amadeen's sole export: happy paste. I can imagine a trail of spittle dreams from Amadeen across the galaxy to Draco. Pahvi has what the humans call devil eyes. I am kept out of sight as much as possible, but I think nearly everyone on the crew knows what is going on. Perhaps they all receive a share of Zenak Abi's payment. Perhaps they don't care. It is an attitude I do not understand. Those who have the grit of Amadeen in their pores learn that death trails uncaring steps. It is the first of many reminders that war makes its own race of children, aliens to those who have not had the same parent. Those crewing the orbiter and the Tora Soam are not warriors with missions. Instead they are laborers and technicians for putting in time pay. The ship's armory is a small compartment opening onto the weapons bay and onto the armorer's quarters. It consists of a workbench and lockers filled with tools and supplies. The tools have no wear on them, the supplies have never been opened, and most of the ship's complement of weapons is still in sealed shipping bags. The weapons that are unpacked and assembled are either filthy, out of power, or both. This obscene lack of preparedness is nothing to me. I have no stake in the mission of the Tora Soam. I stay in my tiny quarters and while away the time with human and Drac theatricals on my monitor. When I can no longer stand the shows, I play the games offered on the monitor until I feel my brain turning into excrement. In desperation I begin unpacking,\n\ncleaning, and powering up the ship's sidearms. It is good work and I find more meaning in it than in my mission to the Talman Kovah. There are both humans and Dracs among the Drac diplomatic mission and among the crew. All of them are young, humans and Dracs both. Too young to have fought on Amadeen before the quarantine, too young to carry the scars of the USE-Dracon War. They serve the joint quarantine force keeping the fighting on Amadeen out of sight and the blood off the boots and sandals of the politicians. There is one member of the crew who did serve on Amadeen before the quarantine. It is the captain and pilot of the Tora Soam, Aureah Vak. Vak is almost as old as Zenak Abi. It has been thirty years since it fought on Amadeen, but I see its eyes every time I look into a mirror. Too old to fly combat now, the pilot ferries passengers from Draco to the Amadeen orbiter and from the orbiter to Draco. Yet the war Vak fought is still alive to its ghosts. Before first watch every cycle Aureah Vak comes to the armory to clean, oil, and test its sidearm and the small pistol it keeps in a hidden boot holster. Both weapons are human projectile pieces. Vak will not let me touch its weapons although the cleaning and repair of such things is supposed to be my work. As one weapon is disassembled for cleaning and inspection, the other is loaded, cocked and on the workbench close to Aureah Vak's hand. Vak's gaze never leaves the weapon it is cleaning, but I am certain the captain knows exactly where I am and what I am doing. On the captain's fifth visit, it speaks beyond its usual curt greeting. \"There is something familiar about you, Yazi Ro. Do you remember meeting me prior to this flight?\" \"No, captain,\" I answer. \"Strange. You are too young, but it is almost as if you were one of my comrades in the Tsien Denvedah as we died on Amadeen.\" I say nothing as his gaze moves until it stops on me. \"Were you in the fight against the pirates around the Aakava System four years ago?\" Without waiting for a response, the captain looks back at the cleaning bench and finishes assembling its weapon as it says, \"There are stories about members of the quarantine patrol and command smuggling certain humans and Dracs off of Amadeen. The smugglers do not care about the species, as long as the price is paid.\" Vak loads the weapon, cocks it, and places it next to his small pistol. Reaching over to the small pistol, Avi takes the pressure off the hammer, removes the clip, and ejects the round from the chamber. In a moment the gun is so many pieces undergoing cleaning and inspection. I am certain that the captain knows the truth about me, and there is no purpose to be served in running or killing the captain, supposing that could be done. Still, I say nothing. It is Vak's game and I let it make the moves. \"What do you want, Yazi Ro?\" \"Want, Captain?\" The pilot's eyes glare at me. \"You are not stupid, denmavedah.\" Now I know it knows. \"Answer me my question, Ro. More than anything else in the universe, for what does your heart crave?\" It matters not if I reveal myself to this one. Vak knows about me. What it does not know is how the endless fire of Amadeen has left me. The\n\nword is strange in my mouth. \"Peace. More than anything else my heart craves peace.\" The captain's aged brow ascends as Vak looks at me with surprise on its face. \"Not vengeance? Have you lost no friends? No family? Was there no one you loved?\" I stare at the deck as waves of images assault my mind. My parent, so many comrades, the last of the Twelve. And someone -- another one -- I loved. Night patrol near Douglasville on Dorado's southern coast. Lota Min crawling ahead, I following. Japu wanted us to probe the enemy position and search for a weakness. In the dirt, knees and elbows raw. Then it happens. One of us makes a noise or crawls too close to a Front listening post. Perhaps a remote probe. The humans, sometimes they begin firing to keep us awake or on the off chance that someone might be near their positions. Very wasteful of ammunition, but this time they catch us. The sky fills with blinding white fire crossed with the bright green streaks of human tracers, the deafening crunch of sonic warheads. Dazed, half blinded by the flares, I see Min crawling into a crater using only its arms. A roar fills my hearing as I see the destruction of a beam disrupter racing toward me. A huge hand comes from above and flattens me into the dirt. In panic I crawl toward the crater, the beam distrupter sizzling the air above the back of my neck. At the lip of the crater a sonic warhead exploding drives my mind into darkness. There are worlds to move before I can open my eyes. Dirt from my face, something heavy across my legs. I can feel something sharp digging into my back. My arms and hands are numb but I manage to clear the dirt from my eyes. My helmet is gone. I open my eyes and see the stars looking back at me. There are no flares, no firing, nothing but a slight breeze from the distant shore and the rasp of Min's breaths. There is the twisted barrel of a weapon blotting out some of the stars, its cooling vanes crumpled like so much foil. I turn my head and see that its tracked undercarriage shares the crater with us. I turn to look at the weight on my legs. Lota Min's body is lying across me. Min's head is back, its eyes closed. I struggle until I get my arms to push me up until I am sitting. I whisper Min's name but I hear nothing but the breaths, raw and rapid. I gently hold Min's head as I move my legs from beneath it. As I move I pray to the universe to keep Min from crying out. The universe answers and Min seems to take no notice of the movement. My legs free, I lower its head to the ground, crawl to the side of the crater, and crouch to see the surrounding terrain. Slowly I move my gaze around, peering into shadows, watching for lights, movement, differences in the night's weave. I move to the other side of the artillery piece and look again. \"Ro.\" Min's voice is weak, my name on its lips a blade into my heart. \"Ro?\" I look around once more then crawl to Min's side. \"Be still. We are not safe.\" I look over Min's body. Below its waist, centered on its groin, there is a hole as large as my head. It is as though a great hand had scooped out Min's reproductive organs and the tops of its thighs. The light from the stars reflects from the surface of the blood pooling there. There are tears on my face as I raise a hand and stupidly hold it in the air, not knowing what to do. \"Yazi Ro. I have so much pain. Am I hurt badly?\" \"Oh, Min.\"\n\n\"The truth.\" Min grabs my arm and squeezes it gently. \"The truth, Ro.\" Badly? My eyes fog with the tears. This one time the entities who dispense fairness and injustice must soften and change this absurd result. But what did that human say about the negotiations: If nothing changes, nothing changes. \"You are hurt, Min. You --\" I cannot say it. I have said the words so many times to strangers, comrades, friends, lovers, even to a few humans. Min whispers, \"I am dying?\" \"Yes.\" \"Where is happy paste when you need it?\" it gasps. I place my hand over Min's as I see its other hand steal to the Talman hanging from its neck. \"Not now,\" Min pleads. \"There are too many things unsaid, undone. Not now.\" All I can do is hold its hand, perhaps say one of the unsaid. \"You take my love and my heart with you, Min.\" \"Do not leave me, Ro.\" Before I can answer, there is a noise. Nothing subtle, no slight change on the wind this. It is a note followed by another, the music soft, haunting. The notes move across the battlefield, into the shadows and depressions, each sound drenched in tears and blood. I am immersed in sadness, yet I push it aside to let my fear stretch its wings. It is, after all, a human playing the sad wooden pipe. Min opens its mouth to ask about the sound, but I touch my finger to its lips and whisper, \"Silence. The humans are very close.\" The song on the pipe is beautiful in its suffering. The musician's tears caress each note as it steals out over the broken land. The human has lost someone and I find myself aching for the creature's pain. The notes grow louder and Min grasps my harness at the throat and pulls me down until its lips are close to my ear. \"You have my love. Ro.\" Min brushes my ear with its lips. \"Go now. Hide.\" Min releases my harness, I brush its face with my lips, and begin to crawl toward the savaged artillery piece, picking up my helmet as I move. Perhaps the musician, absorbed in the sad song, will pass us by. Beneath the carriage of the destroyed weapon I put on my helmet, adjust the sensor, and watch the rim of the crater. Soon a head appears, the body beneath it propelling it tangent to the crater. Closer and in my sensor I see the human from the waist up. It is a male in full combat armor. The armor is scarred and painted black with streaks, dots, and broken lines in orange, brown, and turquoise. Around the man's neck is a small beaded bag with a primitive design of a bird on it. The human has a Drac energy knife slung on his back. Both of his hands play the wooden pipe into which he blows. There is a leather cord leading from the pipe to his neck. If I only had a weapon, I whisper to the universe. My weapon and Min's, though, are both somewhere outside the crater, damaged probably beyond all repair. I hold my breath hoping that Min will stay quiet. Perhaps the human's helmet sensor does not work, or his sensor is not energized, or in his grief he is not paying attention to it. He might pass us by. The sad song suddenly stops. More quickly than I can\n\nsee, the human drops the pipe, allowing it to dangle by its cord, and the energy knife swings down and seems to leap into the human's hands. He sees Min. I hold my breath and my skin tingles as I look around me for a weapon. I cry in frustration for I cannot find even a rock. A shielded light illuminates Min's shattered form. I glimpse between the carrier slides of the carriage and see the human holding a thinlite. The human slings the knife and speaks, his words not English. He speaks to Min, then raises his hands and speaks to the stars. Finished with the stars, he reaches down, takes his musical instrument, and plays a strange tune as he does a bizarre little dance. My fear eases slightly as I decide that the man is some sort of witch or healer trying to help my comrade and lover. Just as I allow myself a breath, however, the song and dance stop, the knife is in the human's hands, and he uses it to sever Min's right foot from its ankle. Min screams and the human sings once more at the stars. The song continues as he moves the razor thin beam through Min's left ankle. Then Min's wrists, then fist-sized pieces of leg and arm until Min is raving from the pain. Soon though Min falls unconscious, but the human does not stop cutting until there is nothing left but a pool of bloody lumps at the bottom of the crater. Done with his task, the human leaves, and the flute once more sends its haunting notes over the battlefield. I stumble from my hiding place, my eyes red from rage. To Min I swear that the humans I kill from now on I will render into liquid one pain racked cell at a time. Revenge. Blood-soaked, shattering, screaming vengeance. Yes, I have served at the feet of that deity. I tortured to death enough humans to crew my nightmares for eternity. \"Captain,\" I say to Aureah, \"I am choked with revenge. It eats at me until there is nothing. You ask me, though, what I want most. More than anything else, captain, I want an end to the horror. I want to see the last of it. I want peace. It has to be. It has to be.\" I feel tears on my cheeks and I am confused at their appearance. Vak's glance drops as it assembles its weapon, loads it, and places it in its holster. The captain stands, glances at me and says, \"Yazi Ro, I have inspected the weapons bay and I have seen the weapons you cleaned and repaired. Would you consider remaining a member of this crew? You could make a home here. It wouldn't be much of a home, but if you had better you wouldn't be here.\" There is a strange ache in my chest. In the locker next to my cot there is Zenak Abi's package to the Jetai Diea of the Talman Kovah. What obligates me to deliver it? My word? The illusion of peace? I can toss the package into the waste, forget about it, and become a space traveler. With credentials from serving on the Tora Soam, I could finish the cruise and then sign on with another ship traveling to mysterious, exotic worlds. The war will become an unpleasant remembrance. And what is Zenak Abi's work but another illusion? If the greatest scientists who study and plan the paths of circumstance cannot find how to accomplish peace on Amadeen, how could a renegade, traitorous, pistol packing Jetah master with no equipment find the answer? One more spittle dream in a universe of illusion. \"Consider it, Ro,\" says the captain as it turns and leaves the compartment. Before I can answer or give my thanks, it is gone. I feel myself uttering a very human sounding sigh. There is nothing to consider. Perhaps once I make my delivery to the Jetai Diea I can\n\nconsider a berth on a ship and a new life. Until then I am still owned by Amadeen. And it was, after all, my word. CHAPTER 8 The customs officials in Sendievu examine my badge coding and pick through my belongings, eventually passing me through after Binas Pahvi passes one of the officials a small package. I no longer care how far the corruption extends. Once through, I ask directions, shoulder my bag, and begin walking the streets of Sendievu, this fabled city of silver and glass. The Talman Kovah is a squat structure of tans, browns, and pale blues with a huge white dome rising from its center. Its entrance is busy with Dracs, humans, and members of other species entering and leaving, each individual seemingly fixed on his, her, or its self importance. I stand, watching from a beautiful park that extends toward the south down a gentle slope to a wide river lined with flowering trees. Along other streets are establishments selling food, clothing, gifts, furniture, books, appliances, toys, and land. Many of the establishments are either human or offering human goods. There are posters showing humans and Dracs embracing in friendship and at least one theater showing Drac translations of human plays. Peace, plenty, prosperity, and fellowship purchased by cutting Amadeen off from the universe. I cannot get out of my mind how much destruction I could cause on this street had I my energy knife. I lean against a smooth-barked tree, lavender fronds spreading out over my head, shading me from Draco's Sun. There is a human in the park. He is very dark, very old, and very crippled, his head hair long and gray. He sits in his wheeled chair s"
