A strange thing happened when he opened one of these. Somehow the sun would shift, hours disappeared, and he felt different.\n\nThose experiences would shape Wilsonâs life as he tried to balance his goals of becoming a scientist, and his natural gift of being a writer. Like a machine he plowed ahead, winning a PhD in robotics from a leading university; and like a dreamer he continued to write, starting with non-fiction and short stories, and evolving into bestselling novels and movies."
