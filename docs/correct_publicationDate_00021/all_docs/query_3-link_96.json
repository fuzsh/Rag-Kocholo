        "text": "Isaac Asimov’s Science Fiction Magazine Nov-Dec 1978 is rated 57%.\n\nAVERAGE STORY: 3.14\n\n14 Stories : 0 great / 6 good / 4 average / 4 poor / 0 DNF\n\nIt is not my intention to start reviewing old issues of Science Fiction magazines. It doesn’t do much of a service to my readers and the quality of stories is likely lower than curated volumes. This reading was inspired by Rich Horton, Editor of some great Best of the Year Collections, who posted on Facebook about reading SF stories published in your birth year and month. That was November 1978 for me, and Isaac Asimov’s Science Fiction Magazine has always been my favorite SF magazine.\n\nUnfortunately this was very early in this magazines life. If this issue is indicative of this era, it was not yet the superb magazine that it would eventually become.\n\nIt seemed to rely on the specific personality and tastes of Asimov himself and not the good ones. This issue is overflowing with very stupid pun and punchline stories, with no purpose beyond being a joke. There are also an abundance of “puzzle stories,” including some that don’t give the solution until the next issue.\n\nThis issue also had a very significant number of “first ever sale” stories from writers who wouldn’t amount to much. I didn’t recognize the names at all. Perhaps Isaac Asimov envisioned himself as filling the role of John Campbell and nurturing young writers, or maybe these were authors you could get on the cheap.\n\nThere are some good things here that aren’t stories: a very nice profile on the life and work of Illustrator George Edward Barr, a long Book Review section by Charles N Brown, and a grumpy editorial by Asimov where he criticizes Close Encounters of the Third Kind and laments working as a critic.\n\nBut those are slim pickings and I don’t recommend seeking out this issue."
