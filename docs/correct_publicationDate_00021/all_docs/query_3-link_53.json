        "text": "It’s this week’s bit of weird fiction being discussed over at LibraryThing.\n\nReview: “The Town of Cats”, Hagiwara Sakutarō, trans. Jeffrey Angles, 1935.\n\nThis is the sole short story from Sakutarō who is better known as a poet and novelist.\n\nThe narrator starts off by telling us how travel bores him these days, every place seems the same unlike his younger days. He’s taken to using morphine and cocaine. (Opium is harder to get in Japan and takes too much paraphenalia). The drugs did his health no good, so, following his doctor’s orders, he began to walk around his neighborhood every day.\n\nHe has an absolutely terrible sense of direction and absent-mindedly wanders about. Once, he had to ask for directions only to be told hes was practically at his house. Once he found himself in a charming neighborhood, clean and neat and its store windows full of unususal merchandise. In the blink of an eye, the neighborhood disappeared to become an ordinary place. It was like a mirror image with things that were on the south side of the street in the beautiful place now on the north side. It’s like looking at image from the reverse side of a piece of paper.\n\nThen we get to the main story.\n\nThe narrator goes to a hot springs spa in Hokuetsu one autumn. There he also wanders on walks.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nReview: The Mocking Program, Alan Dean Foster, 2002.\n\nIt’s a rainy night in the Montezuma Strip and Inspector Angel Cardenas and his partner Fredoso Hyaki are looking at a carcass picked over by organleggers. The ID says he’s George Anderson. His DNA says he’s Wayne Brummel from Harlingen, Texas. A call to his address is answered by Susan Anderson – not his wife, but she’ll show up the next morning at the morgue to identify what’s left of him.\n\nExcept she doesn’t. So Angel and Hyaki go to visit her. And almost get killed in an elaborately booby-trapped house, a house that Anderson and her twelve-year daughter Katla have fled.\n\nAngel finds out Susan used to be married and Brummel was an employee of her husband. Said husband was Cleator Mockerin, a big time mobster that several countries have never been able to convict of anything though the want to. Susan and Brummel stole money from Mockerin and fled to live under assumed identities. Now Mockerin evidently has several hired guns looking for Susan – and especially Katla who appears to be a very bright girl who assisted her father in his business.\n\nThe trail will lead from the alleys and sex clubs of Montezuma Strip to Costa Rica to Mockerin’s underwater lair.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nAs a frequent visitor to The Brian Stableford Site, I certainly had heard of this novel. However, until I read The Cthulhu Palimpsest, I was unaware that it is, as far as I know, Stableford’s sole self-published work. More importantly, I learned it’s set in the same universe as his August Dupin series.\n\nSally Startup provides the parallax on this one.\n\nReview: Echoes of Eternity, Brian Stableford, 2016.\n\nIt’s 1830 in Paris and 11 PM in the Cathedral of Notre Dame Cathedral at the end of the octave of Easter.\n\nBrother Barnabas, a Dominican monk, is making the rounds. He’s a learned man, a sometime agent of the Inquisition who goes to literary salons. He’s surprised to see one Doctor Prospero there. He knows the Englishman behind that pseudonym is one of the occultist he spies on in those salons. He’s somewhat ambivalent about seeing Prospero. Perhaps he can save Prospero’s soul from damnation unlike Erich Zann’s.\n\nProspero plays violin in various Parisian theaters and has been looking for Zann’s music and doesn’t buy Barnabas’ claim the man’s music and violin disappeared after his death. He’s also interested in finding the real Harmonies de l’Enfer. But Prospero isn’t in the cathedral at this late hour for religious instruction or solace.\n\nHe’s there to hear the Quasimodo Peal. That was the ringing of the bells every Sunday, including Quasimodo Sunday – the Sunday following Easter.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nReview: The Cthulhu Palimpsest: A Romance of Termination, Brian Stableford, 2024.\n\nI hesitated for a long time over the possibility of producing the long-projected final volume, in spite of the nagging dissatisfaction of its incompletion, but, still having to fill in time after my supposed retirement from writing, occasioned by old age and ill-health, I finally decided to make the attempt. The race against dementia and death was a close-run affair, and the margin of victory not much more than a short head, but I limped to the finish line, sustained by bloody-mindedness and the closeness of the Necronomicon to my stubborn heart . . . and if I have contrived to persuade someone to publish it posthumously, here it is.\n\nNo, it’s not a fictional narrator opening some Lovecraftian narration. That is the conclusion of the late Stableford’s introduction, “The Back Story”, to his final work. It is indeed the capstone of his Auguste Dupin series that opened with The Legacy of Erich Zann. Not only does the series pay homage to Stableford’s literary hero Edgar Allan Poe and H. P. Lovecraft’s Cthulhu Mythos but works in various historical figures from early 18th century France and elements from various 19th century works of the occult and weird fiction. These are “metaphysical fantasies” and dense works. I won’t say they are totally unique. I haven’t read every book ever written in various languages. But they are like nothing I’ve read. The series works in many of Stableford’s late career interests besides Poe and Lovecraft: evolutionary processes, French literature and culture, early scientific theories, and the effects of art on human consciousness.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Stableford says the series has “sold miserably” in English, but it has done considerably better in French translations, and Stableford dedicates the work to the late Robert Reginald and his Borgo Press that first published the work.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nI’m a bit late with this week’s subject of weird fiction being discussed over at LibraryThing.\n\nYou’e never heard of William Simms? Neither had I until recently when I came across a statement by Edgar Allan Poe that this was the greatest ghost story ever written by an American author.\n\nSimms has been forgotten these days, but, at one time he was a popular American author known for romantic and gothic historical tales set before and during the American Revolution. He was a “sectionalist” author and his work was set in what was then the southwest American frontier. But changing literary tastes and Simms support for the South and slavery had eclipsed his literary star by the time he died in 1870.\n\nReview: “Grayling; or, ‘Murder Will Out?’”, William Gilmore Simms, 1845.\n\nThe story opens with a lamentation on the “cold-blooded demon Science” and how no one likes ghost stories these days, that they are believe in every “ology” except “pneumatology”. Moderns laugh at “Faust” and the “Old Woman of Berkley” and would laugh at the Witch of Endor if they dared. The diminishing “faith in shadows” threatens moral virtue. This is even worse for the writer of romances. Authors now only want to deal with the real, only with matters “vulgar and susceptible of proof”. They find their subjects among “convicted felons” to show they are devoted to nature and truth.\n\nModern taste is becoming coarse because it no longer venerates the past. The “love of the marvelous” is necessary to cultivate and the fine arts. No artist, doubts the author, lacks some belief in the “invisible world”. Ghost stories are so out of vogue that to hear about a ghost visitation is now a novelty.\n\nThe author tells us he’s going to give us a story he’s heard many times from his grandmother, and she believed every word of it. She was a resident of Carolina in the American Revolutionary War. She saw many atrocities during the war. At the time of the story, it had recently concluded, but the land was still in a “state of ferment”.\n\nThe state was overrun by idlers, adventurers, profligates, and criminals. Disbanded soldiers, half-starved and reckless, occupied the highways, outlaws, emerging from their hiding-places, skulked about the settlements with an equal sentiment of hate and fear in their hearts; patriots were clamouring for justice upon the tories, and sometimes anticipating its course by judgments of their own; while the tories, those against whom the proofs were too strong for denial or evasion, buckled on their armour for a renewal of the struggle.\n\nMen go about armed and don’t travel far without an escort. The Graylings live i.n the “Ninety-Six” district. The head of the family died in the war. Mrs. Grayling has two children: James and Lucy, fourteen and five respectively when their father died. James joined the rebel side and fought with his mother’s brother, Joel Sparkman, in Picken’s Brigade. A rifleman, James fought fiercely against the British, Loyalists, and the Cherokees. However, off the battlefield, he is kind-hearted and bashful.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nFree books are like free food at work. Just ‘cause it’s free, doesn’t mean I’m going to take it. However, when this title showed up in when of those email offers, I got it since I’m in the midst of reading science fiction crime and detective stories, and I’m partial to stories set on Mars.\n\nReview: The Secret Order of Scepter & Gavel, Nicholas Ponticello, 2024.\n\nThis was an adequate book, a good enough way to pass a few hours.\n\nPonticello has a pleasing enough style though the sardonicism of his narrator Herbert Hoover Palminteri starts to wear at the end of the story as well his constant references to how fast various characters can run a mile (he’s an ex-track athlete). Perhaps we are to infer that, like his mother, he suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\nThe structure and plot is of the sort with inherent interest. How did our narrator, who once thought he might end up as something like the “ambassador to Europa” end up permanently sentenced to be a lowly paid janitor on Mars?\n\nJumping back and forth in time between events starting at Vanderough University in about 2039 and the Mars of 2070 has has enough interest to pull the reader along.\n\nThe first manned mission to Mars was in 2030 and Vanderough University dedicated itself to turning out students who would participate in Mars colonization. Prescott Harrington, head of the Secret Order of Scepter and Gavel, recruits Palminteri and his roommate, Prescott’s brother Jake. They have a roommate, Lee Knowles who has a pivotal role to play as does Frank Harding. He’ll expose the scandal of the gavelmen and end up as Governor of Mars with Lee as his campaign manager.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nReview: Flatlander, Larry Niven, 1995.\n\nThis is an expanded version of Niven’s early collection The Long ARM of Gil Hamilton and adds the novel The Patchwork Girl and “The Woman in Del Rey Crater”.\n\nHamilton is a policeman, an agent for the United Nations Amalgamated Regional Militia (ARM), and the crime he investigates is mainly organlegging. I probably don’t have to explain to you what that is. We often call it “organ theft”. You know the deal: the urban legends with a man waking up in a hotel room with a scar and a note saying he’s now missing a kidney. Under the color of law, it’s “organ harvesting” as when executed criminals in China are farmed out for spare parts or, even more darkly, people disappearing to supply the medical needs of some ailing CCP member. Indeed, the death van featured in what’s very likely the world’s creepiest PSA, “You Will Be Confirmed Dead in 130 Seconds”, seems there to make sure those parts are fresh.\n\nIn the collection’s “Afterword”, Niven says organlegging goes back to 1964 with organs taken from people executed in India. I haven’t been able to substantiate that, but you can certainly find plenty of news stories about the “organ trade” in India and Nepal these days. Even when this book was published, the Chinese government was doing it with executed prisoners, and the practice is more common now. Niven says people constantly send him stories about it and, indeed, the one time I met him, he mentioned he was involved with international organizations trying to stop the illegal trade.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nYes, I’ve again looted the Innsmouth Free Press archive for this Retro Review\n\nThomas, Jeffrey Ghosts of Punktown. Dark Regions Press, 2014. Paperback: USD $12.74; Kindle: $2.99. ISBN: 978-1-62641-012-1.\n\nOn my first big trip to Punktown, I learned three things.\n\nPunktown is not a place for families.\n\nPunktown is not the place to find love.\n\nPunktown is not the place to find your life’s purpose.\n\nThomas says these are mostly “flat-out horror stories,” whatever their science fiction trappings. But the horror isn’t the strange aliens or the violent gangs. It’s what isn’t here.\n\nThat’s a normal human face for Jeremy Stake, also a character in Thomas’ Deadstock and Blue War. He’s a veteran of that war, a mutant ability to copy alien visages crucial in his deep penetration missions behind enemy lines. But, after he returns to Punktown, his face is locked into the semblance of an alien soldier he killed, and that draws the attention of another, unstable vet. “In His Sights” is a nicely told story full of lyrical details that also seems somewhat haunted by the Vietnam War.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nIt’s another Retro Review that first appeared on the Innsmouth Free Press website (hence the unusual formatting). This one is from 2014.\n\nSammons, Brian M. and Barrass, Glynn Owen, eds. Eldritch Chrome: Unquiet Tales of a Mythos-Haunted Future. Chaosium, 2013. $17.95. ISBN: 978-1568823898.\n\nPast, present, or future, you’re always screwed in a Lovecraftian universe. Even victories are only temporary and sanity precarious. Computers, capitalism and corporations only add to the problem.\n\nThe literary genes of the Man from Providence have proven quite good at splicing themselves into other genre genomes. Out in the disrupted publishing ecosystem we have now, they’ve swapped their memes with all kinds of other stories. Thus we have western Mythos, Sword and Mythos, private-eye Mythos, and historical Mythos. Innsmouth Free Press’s own Future Lovecraft even had some cyberpunk stories. Eldritch Chrome advertises itself as being all “Cyberpunk-Cthulhu tales.”\n\nIf you insist all the stories in a theme anthology actually use that theme, you are going to be disappointed in this book. My definition of cyberpunk is a near-future science fiction story of high-tech and low-life. The editors see cyberpunk as gritty film noir-type stories of people living at the bottom rung of an “electronic society gone awry.” My fellow old timers may even expect mutations on the sort of story appearing in William Gibson’s Burning Chrome. The book’s introduction even makes a broken promise to have a story by cyberpunk pioneer John Shirley, who co-authored a story in that collection. Some of these stories fail to conform to any of those three expectations.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nIf there is such a thing as “blogger block”, I seem to be suffering from it, at least to the extent of making necessary notes.\n\nSo, you get a retro review from almost 10 years ago during my Innsmouth Free Press days.\n\nYou can no longer get this book. Its publisher no longer exists, and it existed only in a kindle edition. However, Hodge’s website says a new edition is coming out this year. (And, no, I did not check to see if the musical accompaniment is still available.)\n\nReview: Whom the Gods Would Destroy, Brian Hodge, 2013.\n\nDamien Phipps has some family problems. He has some questionable memories, too.\n\nDid his mother really handcuff him to a steering wheel when he was four? Did he really escape to see her and his older half-brother beat a man, lashed to a tree, under a night sky ablaze with light?\n\nA troubling memory of mystery and blood, sure, but also the start of a lifelong interest in astronomy, which Damien is pursuing as a grad student. But his life, while not bad, isn’t secure. His stripper girlfriend questions how long he’ll stay with her. Employment opportunities post-graduate school aren’t that plentiful.\n\nWhat he doesn’t need, definitely doesn’t want after escaping them as a teenager, is any contact with his family – the crazy and abusive mother, his sleazy and manipulative brother Cameron, or the father he has no memory of.\n\nBut Cameron shows up, talking an unconvincing reconciliation with Damien and promising him a job in a private astrobiology project. Damien just needs to come to Portland to hear the pitch.\n\nContinue reading →"
