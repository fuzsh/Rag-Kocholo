        "text": "1. I have yet to read anything by Barry B. Longyear, best known Enemy Mine (with David Gerrold) (1985) and Sea of Glass (1986). Circus World (1981) seems like a fun series of linked short stories published in 1978 and 1979 about the descendants of a crashed circus ship.\n\n2. My Poul Anderson collections grows and grows. Sometimes I’m not sure why I bother procuring them… I mean, it was only $1. See the index for my extensive (and apparently contentious) reviews of his work i.e. Tau Zero (1971). And eww, a gauzy cover by Gene Szafran….\n\n3. A complete unknown—and Kathleen M. Sidney’s only SF novel (she wrote three additional short stories according to isfdb.org).\n\n4. Vintage French SF in translation! With a fantastic cover by Max Ernst. In addition to writing SF, Philippe Curval produced fascinating photo collage SF cover art. I’ve featured his art previously on the site: Part I and Part II.\n\nLet me know what you think of the books and covers in the comments!\n\n~\n\n1. Circus World, Barry B. Longyear (1981)\n\n(John Rush’s cover for the 1981 edition) Continue reading →\n\nCarl V. Anderson over at Stainless Steel Droppings often picks up books for me when he peruses the used book stores in his region (I pay for them of course! haha). Thanks again! Over the next few months or so I’ll be posting a range of the ones he acquired for me—three of the four here.\n\nI always want more Kate Wilhelm….\n\nPoul Anderson’s invented world “shared” by other SF authors…\n\nA collection (masquerading as a fix-up novel?) by Barry B. Longyear—whose work I have never read…\n\nAnd Rick Raphael’s most well known work—another “new” author…\n\nThoughts?\n\n1. The Clone, Theodore L. Thomas and Kate Wilhelm (1965)\n\n(Hoot von Zitzewitz’s cover for the 1965 edition) Continue reading →"
