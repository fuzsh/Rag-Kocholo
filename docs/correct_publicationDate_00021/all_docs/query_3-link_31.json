        "text": "The point of my recent Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler reading is that I thought McQuay might have written this novel in a similar style though it’s not a detective story. After all, before this book, he wrote four Matthew Swain novels, a science fiction hardboiled detective series. That definitely was inspired by Chandler. But, no, there’s no real influence of Hammett or Chandler on this one.\n\nThis isn’t my first time reading McQuay. One of Arthur C. Clarke’s late career books (basically, outlined by Clarke, Richter 10, was actually written by McQuay. Not only did I make no notes on it, but it left no trace in my memory.\n\nI haven’t gone out of my way to read books set in Arabic or Islamic dominated futures, but this book was written earlier than others I’ve read: part of George Alec Effinger’s Budayeen series (1987), Donald Moffitt’s Crescent Sky series (1989), and Tom Kratman’s Caliphate (2008). Their attitude about the desirability and quality of life with such a prospect varies.\n\nReview: Jitterbug, Mike McQuay, 1984.\n\nUnlike with movies, it’s hard to tell what a publisher expected from a book, but I get the impression they expected this book to sell well. It was shepherded at Bantam Books by new, hotshot editor Lou Aronica. It has all the earmarks of a hoped-for bestseller. It was 406 pages of story – long for the time, has a map of the parts of the world (North America and the Arabian Peninsula) where the story takes place, a table of organization for the Light of the World corporation which runs the world, a glossary of terms (mostly Arabic and Islamic), a timeline running from 570 to 2151, and a long description of the symptomology, transmission, infection paths, and origin of the Jitterbug virus (in an oh-so 1980s, pre-HIV way, it’s a modified herpes virus). The cover art (was Mick Jagger the model for glowering character in the center?) looks like it was for a contemporary, exotic epic.\n\nAnd, yet, this book has faded from thought. It was never reprinted. McQuay died at a young age which probably didn’t help.\n\nNow, there are plenty of forgotten books. A quick look around the Web of a Million Lies doesn’t provide much reason why this is better remembered. You would expect some complaints about “Islamophobia”, but I didn’t see any. There are some people complaining about its “problematic” view of women. (Beware of any reviewer using “problematic” in any way but ironically.)\n\nContinue reading →\n\nI’m off writing up new posts. (Is my last post not proof of that?) So, you get the last bit of Vernor Vinge material in the archives.\n\nRaw Feed (2003): “The Cookie Monster”, Vernor Vinge, Analog Science Fiction and Fact, October 2003.\n\nVinge is very aware that this story is operating in a long tradition in sf, specifically the artificial world set up for amusement or research purposes. He even has his characters name some examples: Theodore Sturgeon’s “Microcosmic God”, Frederik Pohl’s “Tunnel Under the World“, John Varley’s “Overdrawn at the Memory Bank”, Robert Charles Wilson’s Darwinia, Moravec’s ‘Pigs in Cyberspace'” (I assume that’s Hans Moravec), Galouye’s Simulacron-3, David Brin’s “Stones of Significance” and Kiln People.\n\nI’m familiar with most of these as being about worlds simulated in mechanical simulacra or computers and the related theme of personality recordings and uploadings (which then can be inserted into a computer simulation). I don’t recognize Vinge’s own self-referential mention of “deathcubes”.\n\nI generally like this theme. In literary sf, I’m quite fond of the similar “News from D Street” by Andrew Weiner and Barry B. Longyear’s “Adagio”, but this story didn’t do much for me.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nSince I’ve been touching on the matter of detectives and science fictional noir, I thought this Raw Feed was appropriate\n\nRaw Feed (1992): Dover Beach, Richard Bowker, 1987.\n\nA surprisingly touching and poignant book.\n\nBowker’s post-apocalypse America (victim of a limited nuclear war and anti-intellectual riots) is grim but also comprised of many likeable characters. There’s Bobby Gallagher a tough black marketer, scavenger in the ruins for technology and art; yet he won’t kill and has a fondness for our hero, Wally Sands.\n\nOur hero has a charming dream – he wants to be a private eye in a post-apocalypse world, heir to the literary gumshoes he loves – and possesses two useful mutations (Oh to have those two!): a photographic memory and the need to sleep only one or two hours a day.\n\nGwen is the patient lover of our hero. She, with Gallagher conspires to make possible our hero’s dream and supports his ambition.\n\nThere is Art, the purveyor of porn in a post-apocalypse world, seller of golden accounts of life before the war, but his real love is his endearing interest in science fiction novels about the apocalypse like David Brin’s The Postman. He urges our hero to be an author.\n\nIn fact, many people offer our promising young hero career advice. Gallagher wants him to become a black marketer. Roommate Stretch, a dwarf of ambition, a man dedicated to rebuilding the government and civilization, wants him to join him as a civil servant.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nMy look at Stableford’s doctoral thesis continues. My review of this chapter, the book’s longest at 48 pages, is going to be shorter than normal. While thematic criticism is my favorite type of science fiction criticism, I’m not going to spend a lot of time on this chapter because much of it is very much like the thematic entries in the first edition of The Science Fiction Encyclopedia. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if some of them were cut and pasted from Stableford’s entries for it or vice versa. However, I did not do my blogger due diligence and check my copy of that book. My boxes of books aren’t labelled that exactly and there are scores of them. And I’ve lifted a lot of them lately\n\nI’ll also note that Stableford talks about now more obscure stories because over 40 years of sf history has been added since he wrote this book.\n\nReview: The Sociology of Science Fiction, Brian Stableford, 1987.\n\nChapter V is titled “Themes and Trends in Science Fiction”.\n\nThe first section is on “Machines” and opens with a quote from Miguel de Unamuno stating that Don Quixote was right to attack the windmill as a dangerous enemy. Stableford goes on to say,\n\nToday the marriage of man and machine, after a long courtship, has been consummated. The honeymoon is over, and we begin to doubt whether we have done the right thing. Science fiction tells the story of our passage from infatuation to the brink of disillusionment with remarkable clarity.\n\nThis section includes coverage of things that have been categorized into entries like “automation”, “computers”, “cyborgs”, and “robots” in the online Science Fiction Encyclopedia. Stableford sees the development, particularly in the case of the robot stories, as largely pro- technology authors losing faith in man and not machines, in our ability to morally and intellectually handle them post-WWII.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nAfter finishing Burn-In, I decided to read this book since it also has a story from that novel’s co-author August Cole.\n\nI thought it was one of the many books I got a review copy of and hadn’t reviewed yet, so I thought I’d chip another bit off that list.\n\nIt turns out it was just a freebie from the Atlantic Council, and you can get your free copy at the link below.\n\nReview: War Stories from the Future, ed. August Cole, 2015.\n\nYou don’t usually see a Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States of America introducing a science fiction anthology, but Martin Dempsey was just that. He has a master’s degree in English and praises sf not for its predictive abilities but its provocation and power to develop “the professional imagination” and as “a mental laboratory”.\n\nThe book proved weirdly appropriate for the age of COVID – at least as presented in the panicked minds of the Sanitary Dictatorship in charge of various countries and their propaganda organs.\n\n“A Visit to Weizenbaum” from Jamie Metzel gives us a story where the use of tailored bioweapons requires Isolation Soldiers. They live in very sealed compounds for 18 months, their bodies monitored for signs of infection and entertained with virtual reality systems. Unfortunately, the rest of the story isn’t that interesting. It’s a therapy session with a soldier missing his beloved Elizabeth.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nSince I don’t have anything new to post right now, I’ll respond to a mention of this collection on Classics of Science Fiction. And a reminder unusually relevant with this one — Raw Feeds come with spoilers.\n\nRaw Feed (2001): Man in His Time: Best SF Stories, Brian Aldiss, 1989.\n\n“Introduction” — Aldiss talks briefly about how he was influenced by the first Shakespeare play he read, The Tempest, and how the short story, unlike the novel, has no hero and, again unlike the novel, is never about the search for truth but features a truth of the author’s. Aldiss, responding to a critic’s remark that his stories don’t as much explain as mystify, sees mystification as a tool to reveal the truth that we do not know everything about the universe.\n\n“Outside” — This story is dated 1955 (It’s unclear if that’s a date of composition or date of publication.), so it’s possible that it may have been inspired, if Aldiss saw the magazines they were published in, some of Philip K. Dick’s earlier work (he is an acknowledged fan of Dick), specifically the Dick story “Imposter” which has published prior to 1955. On the other hand, it’s possible he came up with the idea for this story all by himself or was inspired by A.E. van Vogt, Dick’s model for some of his earlier stuff. The story here, a man sharing a house with some other housemates, a house that none of them ever leaves, that none of them even has the desire to leave though they can’t see out of it (and get their supplies from the “store”, a small room by the kitchen), and the man eventually discovering that the house is an observatory where humans observe captured, would-be alien Nititian infiltrators (they kill humans and shape themselves into exact replicas), and the man discovering that he is, in fact, one of those Nititian, is pretty Dickian. The protagonist was so passive because Nititians tend to adopt themselves to the psychological coloration of the humans around them. In this case, a human observer in the house was in the passive, watching mode.\n\n“The Failed Men” — An interesting story, a witty look at the uncleavable union of culture and language. The humans of the 24th Century, called the Children by those of that future, are roped into the Intertemporal Red Cross mission made up of humans from many different periods in the future, to save the bizarre, strange case of the Failed Men, a culture of the 3,157th century. They are deformed in shape, and have, for some unknown reason, buried themselves in the Earth. They literally have to be dug out to help them. The 24th Century protagonist, and his comrades from the same century, find the Failed Men so disturbing that psychiatric hospitalization is required. There are hints that some action of the ancestors created the Failed Men, but no one can be sure. No one has been able to fathom the motives for the path they took. It may have been religious or a failed attempt at transcendence. The Failed Men are no help in explaining their action. Their language is a melange of abstractions, some seemingly redundant, some seemingly contradictory — at least, to a non-native speaker. Continue reading →\n\nSince I recently brought up Arthur C. Clarke’s The City and the Stars, I thought I’d also mention Clarke’s earlier version of the story and Gregory Benford’s sequel.\n\nRaw Feed (1991): Beyond the Fall of Night, Arthur C. Clarke and Gregory Benford, 1990.\n\nMy reactions to this book follow three veins: comparing Part 1, Clarke’s “Against the Fall of Night” with the expanded version The City and the Stars, Benford’s sequel to Clarke’s novella in its own right, and the combination as a whole.\n\nAs an alternative to The City and the Stars, I liked the latter better than “Against the Fall of Night”. The novel gave full rein to Clarke’s mournful vistas of an ancient Earth where man huddles fearfully. The novella has the same feel but Clarke simply doesn’t have as much space to portray these emotions. Also the novel had many interesting details, notions, and speculations: the psychological and social effects of no new births in Diaspar — just recycling of personalities with undesired memories edited out — and immortality, the instant creation of desired forms of matter (for role-playing games and much else), the sex games of Diaspar’s inhabitants and their evolved state, the mysterious Jester and the more mysterious matter of Alvin actually being born not recanted, the creation of the Mad Mind and Vanamonde (dealt with here but not in as great detail), and the religion of the Master and the enforced silence of his robot servant to spare him embarrassment. The mere length of the novella lessens the tone and emotion that goes so far in making the novel a classic.\n\nI’m not sure if Benford’s addition really stands alone, but I liked it. From what I’ve heard of his novels (I’ve only read his collaboration with David Brin in Heart of the Comet), this story has his characteristic concern with man’s evolution and his place in the vaster evolution of life and intelligence. The vistas of millennia are reminiscent of Olaf Stapledon I suppose, but this part reminded me most of the bizarre future of Brian Aldiss’ Hothouse. Benford’s life forms are just as bizarre, even more rationalized (particularly the creatures whose consciousness exist in the magnetic fields of the galaxy), but less well described. Which is just as well. Benford’s creatures are too vast, too alien to be minutely described like Aldiss’. They can just be suggested. Continue reading →\n\nThe Charles Sheffield series continues.\n\nRaw Feed (1997): Georgia on My Mind and Other Places, ed. Charles Sheffield, 1995.\n\n”Introduction” — Short, no nonsense, no-frill introduction for a collection of stories ranging from “silly to personal and serious.”\n\n”The Feynman Solution” — This is a fantasy. The mechanism of time travel is never rationalized beyond the point of artist Colin Trantham saying he’s a sort of positron which physicist Richard Feynman described as an electron traveling back in time. The story involves Colin, suffering from a brain tumor (the major scientific interest of the story is the descriptions of cancer therapies, their successes, methods of operation, and failings) and seeing visions of increasingly ancient and mostly extinct life which he draws with his usual precision. The relationship between Colin and his paleontologist sister Julia and his oncologist James Wollaston (eventually Julia’s lover) was well handled. The Tranthams, like Bey Wolf in Sheffield’s Proteus novels, love to quote all kinds of things from Samuel Johnson to movies. I suspect Sheffield does this too.\n\n”The Bee’s Kiss” — Like Sheffield’s “C-Change”, this story involves aliens who are concealing things. A very skilled voyeur is forced by a tyrant (after the voyeur is caught spying on him) to spy on some enigmatic aliens, the Sigil. It turns out the aliens have become alarmed after learning humans use sexual reproduction. The Sigil are asexual and use a parasitic means to reproduce like Earth’s sphinx wasp. This story has good psychological insight into a voyeur. Continue reading →\n\nThe Charles Sheffield series continues.\n\nRaw Feed (1997): The McAndrew Chronicles, Charles Sheffield, 1983.\n\n“Introduction” — Sheffield notes his confusion at separating the science from the pseudoscience be encountered as a teenager reading science fiction. He says no stories in this book violate current scientific theories.\n\n”First Chronicle: Killing Vector” — Introduction of the absent-minded and brilliant physicist McAndrew and his work in kernels (charged, rotating Kerr-Newman black holes). The McAndrew name and kernels seem to link this story to the Proteus Universe of Sheffield’s. A terrorist being transported on the ship McAndrew works on is sprung by his confederates though his plan goes very awry (he’s booted out of the universe) because of his incomplete knowledge of physics. The terrorist Yifter is head of the Hallucinogenic Freedom League which kills a billion people by putting hallucinogens in many of the water supplies of the world. This seems to point to a conception date for this story of sometime in the seventies [publication in Galaxy magazine in 1978, actually]. References to bio-feedback machines regenerating lost limbs, the central technology of the Proteus stories, are also mentioned made here.\n\n”Second Chronicle: Moment of Inertia” — McAndrew invents a balanced drive spaceship capable of traveling at 50g acceleration. The trick is not generating that much power. It’s accelerating that quickly and keeping the passengers alive. McAndrew uses a moveable disk of superdense matter to cancel out the acceleration forces with gravity (the equivalence principle of Einstein). However, during the ship’s trial voyage, the disk gets stuck so McAndrew can’t decelerate safely. The narrator of the senses (his friend and occasional lover) saves him. [No, 22 years later I no longer have any idea of what the “narrator of the senses” means. I don’t have the book in front of me.] Continue reading →\n\nIf you’re a regular reader of science fiction reviews and criticism, you may have heard of the “Dos Passos technique”.\n\nJohn Brunner was the first to use it in science fiction in 1968’s Stand on Zanzibar. The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction describes them as “modernist.\n\nOther writers followed. Of the top of my head, I can think of Joe Haldeman’s “To Howard Hughes: A Modest Proposal” and David Brin’s Earth as using it. Some recent works by Kim Stanley Robinson, which I haven’t read yet, have been said to use it.\n\nI’m a fan of the technique and think it quite effective, so, in 1997, I decided to let Dos Passos show me what his technique was.\n\nThe John Dos Passos memorial website says\n\nDos Passos considered himself foremost a writer of contemporary chronicles. He chose the moniker of “chronicler” because he was happiest working at the edge of fiction and nonfiction.\n\nBoth genres benefited from his mastery of observation—his “camera eye”— and his sense of historical context. Dos Passos sought to ground fiction in historic detail and working-class, realistic dialogue. He invented a multimedia format of newsreels, songs, biographies, and autobiography to convey the frenzy of 20th century America’s industrialism and urbanism.\n\nDos Passos, incidentally, sort of fell out of favor with American literati because he stopped, unlike many of them, being a dupe of communist propaganda.\n\nDos Passos himself may have disagreed with my wish that more writers take up his style. In a 1918 letter, he said:\n\n“About style—I think that reading people in order to get ‘style’ from them is rather soft-headed. Your style is like the color of your hair or the cut of your pants—half accident, half act of God—to take thought to change or improve it results usually in rank affectation.”\n\nRaw Feed (1997): The U.S.A. Trilogy, John Dos Passos, 1930, 1960.\n\nI read this trilogy — The 42nd Parallel (1930), Nineteen Nineteen (1932), and The Big Money (1936) — to get some appreciation of the style so successfully used by John Brunner and Joe Haldeman, and I found that style interesting.\n\nI liked the Camera Eye sections – impressionistic vignettes sometimes told from the point of view of some of the characters and sometimes they seem to feature viewpoint characters never seen elsewhere in the trilogy.\n\nThe Newsreel sections were compelling, and the very best thing about the trilogy is a series of biographies of historical personages. Told in a variety of styles, a variety of tones, they sometimes approach prose-poems and are always interesting and very revealing in the large and small details of the people’s lives (cultural, political, scientific, and business figures).\n\nThese techniques, together with straight fictional prose, create, as they do in sf novels, a definite sense of place and time – here America in the first approximately 25 years of the 20th Century.\n\nUnfortunately, while this book evokes a time and place (I was particularly interested in the accounts of labor agitation and Wilson’s Versailles negotiations), it doesn’t work as drama.\n\nMany of the characters blurred together in my mind. (The most memorable was Charley Anderson from Fargo, and Minnesota’s Twin Cities is a setting of some of the story). All were on the make – at least in The Big Money.\n\nUnplanned pregnancies play a major part in the plot as they probably did in the real lives of people during the time of this trilogy since artificial contraception was often illegal, and, for that reason, I probably confused the female characters more often than the male, but all the fictional characters suffered from lack of memorable distinctions.\n\nI’m glad I read this book to examine Dos Passos’ wonderful, groundbreaking, influential style and the history I learned. However, the trilogy didn’t work as drama."
