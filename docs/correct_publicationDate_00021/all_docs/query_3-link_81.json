        "text": "5/5 (Masterpiece)\n\n“The men heard, and they rejoiced to find an enemy they could conquer at last. One night, as planned, they pulled all the women from sleep, herded them together, and harangued them, saying, remember, you caused the Wasting” (3).\n\nSuzy McKee Charnas’ Walk to the End of the World (1974) is the first of four novels in The Holdfast Chronicles sequence (1974-1999) that charts the slow forces of change in a post-apocalyptical future where women (“fems”) are chattel. Kate Macdonald, in her wonderful review of Ammonite (1993) characterized Nicola Griffith’s novel as “instantly […] feminist: not stealth, or muted, or sub-conscious.” Walk to the End of the World falls squarely, and powerfully into this category. Told with intensity and vigor, Charnas brands the reader with her vision, a searing and festering landscape where white men have either exterminated the remaining “unmen” (the “Dirties”) or subjugated them (the “fems”) after a manmade cataclysm. Complex societal institutions maintain control in a mostly illiterate world via appeals to collective memory, intensive drug facilitated indoctrination, and the deconstruction of the family unit in favor of exclusively homosocial relationships.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nCarl V. Anderson over at Stainless Steel Droppings often picks up books for me when he peruses the used book stores in his region (I pay for them of course! haha). Thanks again! Over the next few months or so I’ll be posting a range of the ones he acquired for me—three of the four here.\n\nI always want more Kate Wilhelm….\n\nPoul Anderson’s invented world “shared” by other SF authors…\n\nA collection (masquerading as a fix-up novel?) by Barry B. Longyear—whose work I have never read…\n\nAnd Rick Raphael’s most well known work—another “new” author…\n\nThoughts?\n\n1. The Clone, Theodore L. Thomas and Kate Wilhelm (1965)\n\n(Hoot von Zitzewitz’s cover for the 1965 edition) Continue reading →\n\n(Geoff Taylor’s cover for the 1978 edition)\n\n3.25/5 (collated rating: Vaguely Good)\n\nThe Custodians and Other Stories contains Richard Cowper’s most famous short SF (both received Nebula nods): “The Custodians” (1975) and “Piper at the Gates of Dawn” (1976), later published side-by-side with his Nebula-nominated novel in the same sequence The Road to Corlay (1978).\n\nMy limited exposure to Cowper’s work so far—i.e. the hilarious post-apocalyptical black comedy on the British class system replete with intelligent dolphins and giant submarines, Profundis (1979)—suggests an author who can weave a solid story in a range of SF sub-genres from time travel Continue reading →\n\nWhile in Scotland a few weeks ago I could not help but peek into a few used book stores! As an American, I am intimately acquainted with the common US publishers (Ballantine + Signet + Avon + et al) but do not own very many 70s/80s UK editions (Pan + Grenada + Panther, etc). Thus, there was something special about snatching a copy of Best SF Stories from New Worlds 8 (1974) as it was one of the few in the series never published in the US…\n\nEnjoy the cover art!\n\n[I am not sure what to make of the Jim Burns’ cover… I have the feeling that it appeared on Good Show Sir a while back]\n\nThoughts?\n\n[If you are in Edinburgh and want new SF/F stop by Transreal Fiction—and talk to the owner Mike!]\n\n1. The Moment of Eclipse, Brian W. Aldiss (1970)\n\n(Vincent Di Fate’s cover for the 1985 edition) Continue reading →\n\n(Art Sussman’s cover for the 1960 edition)\n\n3.25/5 (collated rating: Vaguely Good)\n\nI have long been a fan of both Judith Merril’s fiction and edited volumes. The eponymous novella in the collection Daughters of Earth (1968) is one of more delightful visions from the 1950s I have encountered. Merril reframes biblical patrilineal genealogy as matrilineal–i.e. humankind’s conquest of space is traced via the female descendants of an august progenitor. The story is brilliant in part due to a remarkable metafictional twist, the story itself is compiled from historical documents to serve as an instructional template for future generations of women. Despite substantial editorial control that forced Merril to include a rather hokey plot on two hokey planets, the story remains memorable for the well crafted feminist Continue reading →\n\nOn twitter [my account here — please follow! I post interesting things!] I posed the following question:\n\nWhich SF author—for the purposes of this site’s focus, an author starting pre-1980—deserves a new (or reprint) single author collection?\n\nGUIDELINES (please read): Said author cannot have a single author collection published within the last 10 years (you can fudge this a bit). It also should be noted that many eBooks aren’t available in the United States (SF Gateway for example). If the recent eBook edition isn’t available in the US, I guess the author fits the bill (*cough* — John Sladek).\n\nNote: If you are thinking about doing some checking before you make your choice (see guidelines) I recommend using isfdb.org as it has mostly up to date publication histories for all but self-published authors.\n\nMy vote: Miriam Allen deFord (active from — SF Encyclopedia LINK\n\nPublished collections: Xenogenesis (1969) and Elsewhere, Elsewhen, Elsehow (1971)\n\nReason: Miriam Allen deFord (1888-1975) was one of the major voices in SF magazines from 1946 – 1978. She never made the transition to novels and thus might have lost some readership as a result. The stories in Xenogenesis (1969) shows an often radical voice right from her first story in 1946. Although they might not be as polished as some of her more Continue reading →"
