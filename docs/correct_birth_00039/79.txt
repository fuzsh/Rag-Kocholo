World number one Novak Djokovic received praise on social media after a video emerged of the Serb playing tennis with a group of kids on the streets of Belgrade.

The Serb, who won his eighth Australian Open last month, is taking time out from competing to be in his homeland to promote an event connected with his Foundation, alongside wife Jelena.

And upon spotting the children playing tennis in the streets of his home city Belgrade, without a net, he decided to join them.

The 32-year-old reportedly said: 'It was spontaneous, I was coming back with rackets, the first time I saw the kids playing tennis without a net.

'Then I told them I was going to bring a net between two lamp posts to hook them up and play nicely.

'It was great, for such moments one lives. Now, as a father, I invoke these situations to play with the children, and it is my pleasure to see the children play tennis, hit the wall, that's how we all started.'

One user responded to the video by saying: 'The greatest ever. On and off the court.'

Another was equally as glowing: 'A simple, down to earth guy who loves his countrymen very much. No ego and all the humility in the world. Such a beautiful person. Wish all sports stars were like him.'

And none other than Bear Grylls was also a fan of Djokovic's heartwarming gesture, tweeting: 'Love this.'

The world number one is due to be back in competitive action next week in Dubai, before playing at the Masters events in Indian Wells and Miami next month.
