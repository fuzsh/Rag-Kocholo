        "text": "In the eyes of his uncle Goran, Novak Djokovic's popularity is beyond debate. \"Let's call him a national treasure, he belongs to Serbia and the world,\" he said earnestly in his spacious office overlooking Stari Grad, Belgrade's \"old town.\" The amiable, salt-and-pepper-haired 50-year-old has his own explanation for his illustrious nephew's success on the tennis court. What's the secret behind Djokovic's formidable eye and defensive qualities? According to him, the answer lies in Kopaonik, a ski resort perched at 1,700 meters above sea level, in the mountains of southern Serbia, where the future champion spent part of his childhood and took his first strokes with a racket.\n\n\"The court was shallow and in the forest; Novak had no choice but to return the ball as quickly as possible, as the higher the altitude, the faster the ball travels. And he glides so well across the court, even on hard surfaces, because he knows how to ski perfectly,\" said this former professional skier, who is vice-president of the Serbian Tennis Federation, modest in comparison to its wealthy French counterpart, with 156 clubs and 2,500 members (compared to the FFT's 7,500 clubs and one million members).\n\nBut his nephew's achievements – currently vying for a 23rd Grand Slam title at Roland-Garros from May 28 – have undeniably boosted this individual sport in a country where football, basketball, volleyball and even water polo are historically far in front. \"While we can be proud of Monica Seles, it was Novak's generation, all his victories and the national team's Davis Cup title [in 2010, beating France in the final], that made tennis explode in popularity in Serbia.\"\n\nSasa Ozmo, a journalist for Sport Klub, a TV channel that broadcasts sport in the Balkans, was already following tennis before Djokovic's rise. \"It wasn't comparable, it was a marginal sport then. He got older people watching tennis on TV. Here, there are people following his matches aged from seven to 77,\" he said, sitting at a café in Novi Beograd, the \"new Belgrade,\" on this rainy day in mid-May.\n\nDjokovic lives not far away, in the part of the city built in 1948, when he returns to the city where he was born almost 36 years to the day before the 2023 edition of the Paris tournament. It's not unusual to see him playing in the street with the local children. He also owns a restaurant with his family in the area, somewhat isolated between the highway and the Stark Arena, the huge complex where Partizan Belgrade's basketball matches take place. A picture of the player, Australian Open trophy in hand, his jacket bearing the number \"22,\" covered the full height of the building after he equaled Spaniard Rafael Nadal's record for Grand Slam titles at the end of January."
