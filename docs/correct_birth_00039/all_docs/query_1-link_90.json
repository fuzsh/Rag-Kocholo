He's an amazing guy, the pride of Serbia and we're so proud of him.\"\n\nMORE: What NBA championship means for Nikola Jokic's legacy\n\nAround the same time, Jokic was quoted praising Djokovic as a Serbian hero and \"ambassador.\"\n\n\"He's the guy who represents Serbia in a much bigger scene. He's the Serbian ambassador,\" the basketball player said. \"He's the idol to the kids in Serbia not just for the things on the court but [also] for the things his foundation is doing. …\n\n\"I want to be like him. He's doing something great for kids, for Serbia, for everything. We cannot be compared.\"\n\nThe pair, both nicknamed \"the Joker,\" shared sentiments with each other as the NBA finals unrolled, Djokovic loudly cheering on his fellow Serbian from afar.\n\nHere's what you need to know about their relationship, including where they're from and the contact they've made:\n\nNovak Djokovic-Nikola Jokic relationship\n\nDjokovic and Jokic were both born in what was then Yugoslavia, before the country split amid political turmoil. Djokovic is from Belgrade, while Jokic is from Sombor.\n\nThey both got into sports young, and were catapulted into the spotlight in their young adult years — Djokovic was 16 when he turned pro in 2003, and Jokic was 18 when he was drafted by the Nuggets in 2012.\n\nDjokovic told FanDuel that he had gotten Jokic's phone number in late May and planned to reach out to him.\n\nJokic went to check for a notification of congratulations after the Game 5 victory, during the postgame interviews, dropping the F-bomb over the amount of buzz his phone was receiving.\n\nMORE: Highlights of Nikola Jokic's NBA championship celebration\n\nThe pair have met before. Djokovic, an avid basketball fan, sported Jokic's jersey to his 2021 French Open semifinal match in Paris after Jokic won his first NBA MVP award that season.\n\nThey also attended a basketball camp in Belgrade together in the summer of 2020, according to Insider.\n\nBoth now sit at the pinnacle of their respective sports, and while each has plenty of admirers in his own right, the mutual admiration obviously is strong as well."
