        "text": "Novak Djokovic won his first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in 2008. And now in 2023, after winning his third French Open title, Djokovic has become the first man to win 23 Grand Slam titles.\n\nIn an era of men's tennis where either you were a Roger Federer fan or a Rafael Nadal fan, Djokovic created a space for himself. And then he went on to break the Swiss and the Spaniard's stranglehold on the game through a combination of exceptional skill, mental resilience, and consistent performances. And now he has surpassed both the greats and is considered the greatest men's tennis player of all time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Sunday (June 11), Djokovic clinched his 23rd Grand Slam singles title, breaking a tie with Nadal, and moving three ahead of the retired Federer, with a 7-6 (1), 6-3, 7-5 victory over Casper Ruud at Court Philippe Chatrier in Paris.\n\nDjokovic's journey to becoming the best in tennis has been a tough and remarkable one. Throughout his career, he has faced numerous challenges and obstacles, both on and off the court, but his unwavering determination and exceptional skills have helped him rise to the top of the sport.\n\nShaped by hardships\n\nChildhood: Born on May 22, 1987, in Belgrade, Serbia, Djokovic started playing tennis at a young age and showed immense talent and potential from the beginning. Djokovic grew up in war-torn Serbia, and his family often struggled to make ends meet. After spending early years of his childhood in Serbia, Djokovic moved to Niki Pilic's academy in Munich, Germany in 1999. However, breaking into the elite ranks of tennis was no easy feat.\n\nDealing with Federer and Nadal Dominance: Djokovic's career coincided with the dominance of Federer and Nadal, two of the greatest players in tennis history. Breaking through their stranglehold on the sport and making his mark was a significant challenge. Djokovic had to find a way to consistently compete against them and overcome the psychological barrier of playing against the tennis greats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhysical and mental health struggles: Djokovic has had his fair share of physical and mental health issues. In 2011, he battled a serious shoulder injury, which affected his performance and required extensive rehabilitation. He has also dealt with respiratory issues and allergies that have affected his play on certain occasions. Djokovic has also opened up about his struggles with mental health. He has said that he has experienced anxiety and depression, and that he has sought professional help for these issues.\n\nVaccination status: Djokovic's vaccination status has been a major source of controversy in recent years. He has refused to get vaccinated against Covid-19, which has led to him being banned from competing in several tournaments, including the Australian Open.\n\nA career timeline of Djokovic\n\n2003: Djokovic turned professional at the age of 16.\n\n2005: He made his breakthrough on the ATP Tour by reaching the quarterfinals of the Wimbledon Championships.\n\n2007: Djokovic won his first ATP title in Adelaide, Australia, and reached the final of the US Open, where he lost to Federer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2008: Djokovic won his first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open, defeating Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the final.
