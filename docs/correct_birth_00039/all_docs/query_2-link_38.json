        "text": "On Sunday, Novak Djokovic celebrated winning a historic 24th major title when he defeated Daniil Medvedev for the US Open trophy. Since then, the Serbian hasnât taken a second to slow down.\n\nItâs been a whirlwind 72 hours to say the least for Djokovic. Monday involved the usual post-champion media opportunities, as Djokovic did on-air appearances for the likes of CBS Morning News and NBC's The Today Show before flying home.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 36-year-old and wife Jelena were on hand for a special family event. Djokovicâs brother Djorde and wife Saska welcomed guests to commemorate the christening of son Aleksandar, born in March.\n\nBy the evening, Djokovic experienced a different set of emotions when he joined the Serbian national basketball team at Belgradeâs Stari Dvor (âOld Palaceâ). Stepping out on its illustrious balcony, the ATPâs all-time leader for weeks as world No. 1 was brought to tears by the resounding welcome he received from locals who showed up to honor their sporting heroes.\n\nCome Wednesday, Djokovic was back on the road to fly the flag for his nation. Touching down in Valencia, Djokovic arrived to join his teammates for the Davis Cup Finals group stage. A day earlier, Serbia swept South Korea 3-0 to kick off their bid to advance out of Group C.\n\nDjokovic made his competition debut in 2004 and has dazzled over two decades with a 38-7 record in singles. He notably led Serbia to a breakthrough title in 2010."
