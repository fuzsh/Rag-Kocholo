        "text": "Novak Djokovic is a Serbian tennis player, who was number 1 tennis player in the world for 2000 weeks in total. He was born in Belgrade in 1987 and started playing tennis when he was 4. At the age of 13 he started training in Munich, Germany, and when he was 14 he began his international career by winning his first international contest, in single, double, and team competitions. He managed to win his first ATP contest in 2004, and in 2007 he rose to semifinals of Wimbledon and France Open. In 2011, after winning 43 games in a row (which was then for the first time in tennis history), he became Number 1 tennis player of the world, at US Open. In the mid-2010s he was constantly competing with other players like Andy Murray, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and others. Rio Olympics of 2016 started a decline in his career as he lost his match on the very second day of the competition. Novak Djokovic is an honorary member of Serbian Orthodox church and is a polyglot, who can speak Serbian, Italian, German, and English. He is married to Jelena Ristic and has a son, Stefan, born in 2014."
