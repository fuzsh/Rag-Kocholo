        "text": "what did novak djokovic do at wimbledon 2024?\n\nNovak Djokovic reached the final of Wimbledon 2024. It was his 37th Grand Slam final. Of the previous 36, he won 24 and lost just 12.\n\nIt was Djokovic’s 10th Wimbledon final. He won seven of his previous nine and was looking to equal Roger Federer‘s record of eight Wimbledon titles this year. The Serb was also hoping to become the player with the most Grand Slam titles in history (only Margaret Court currently shares his 24-major haul).\n\nDjokovic lost 6-2,6-2, 7-6(4) to Carlos Alcaraz in the final, in a rematch of their five-set epic in the final last year.\n\nEn route to the final, Djokovic beat Kopriva, Fearnley, Popyrin, Rune, De Minaur (via a walkover) and Musetti.\n\nDid NOVAK DJOKOVIC undergo surgery prior to WIMBLEDON 2024?\n\nYes. The Serb underwent knee surgery following an injury at Roland-Garros. However, Djokovic was back on the court quickly and did play at Wimbledon, where he went on to reach the final.\n\nWhat HAPPENED TO Novak Djokovic at roland-GARROS in 2024?\n\nNovak Djokovic broke two records at Roland-Garros, becoming the all-time leader in Grand Slam match wins with 370 and the leader in slam quarter-finals reached with 59. Roger Federer is second in both categories.\n\nHowever, Djokovic was unable to play his quarter-final match against Casper Ruud due to a knee injury sustained during his five-set win over Francisco Cerundolo in the round of 16. An MRI revealed a medial meniscus tear and Djokovic was forced to withdraw the next day. He had surgery shortly after.\n\nWhat did Novak Djokovic accomplish AT THE 2024 Geneva OPEN and why did he play it?\n\nPlaying his second round match (after an opening round bye) against Yannick Hanfmann, Djokovic scored his 1,100th career win with a 6-3, 6-3 win over the German on his 37th birthday.\n\nThe win made Djokovic only the third player in men’s tennis history to reach 1,110 wins after Jimmy Connors (1,274) and Roger Federer (1,251). The Serb also now holds the best win-loss percentage record in men’s tennis at 83.5%, ahead of Rafael Nadal and Bjorn Borg.\n\n83.5% – Novak Djokovic 1,100-218\n\n82.8%: Rafael Nadal 1,075-224\n\n82.4%: Bjorn Borg 654-140\n\nDjokovic announced that he would be taking a wildcard into the ATP 250 event in Geneva the week before Roland-Garros. This was a surprising move, considering how selective Djokovic is with his calendar these days, and the fact that it is a week before a Grand Slam.\n\nThe world No 1 said of his decision to play in Geneva, “The reason why I chose to come and play is because I feel like at this moment, there is no better practice for me than match play.”\n\n“I feel like I need more matches, even if it’s one match, two matches, three, four hopefully. It’s good for me, because that’s the way for me to try to find that kind of form that I need for Roland-Garros.”\n\nWhat happened to Novak Djokovic at the 2024 Rome Masters?\n\nNovak Djokovic beat Corentin Moutet in his opening match at the Rome Masters in May 2024. After the match while signing autographs, he was struck on the head by a bottle that fell from a fan’s backpack in the stands.\n\nTwo days later, he was knocked out of the tournament by Chile’s Alejandro Tabilo, 6-2, 6-3. Djokovic said afterwards that he had not felt his usual self on court and was now intending to have medical tests to discover whether the blow to his head had caused any damage.\n\nWhat did Novak Djokovic win at the 2024 Laureus Awards?\n\nNovak Djokovic was named Sportsman of the Year at the 2024 Laureus Awards, held in Madrid. It is the fifth time he has won the accolade. This annual award recognises the three Grand Slams he won in the previous season, taking his total to 24.\n\nWhat happened to novak djokovic in indian wells in 2024?\n\nDjokovic decided to play in Indian Wells, his first time there since 2019. But after scraping through his opener, he was beaten 6-3, 6-4 by Luca Nardi, a lucky loser from Italy, ranked No 123. It was the first time Djokovic has ever lost to a player ranked outside the top 100 in a Masters 1000 or Grand Slam event. Djokovic then pulled out of Miami, saying he needs to balance family life with the ATP Tour.\n\nwhat did djokovic do at the 2024 monte-carlo masters?\n\nDjokovic reached the semi-finals of the 2024 Monte-Carlo Masters, marking his first appearance in the last four of this tournament since his title-winning run back in 2015.\n\nIn the semi-finals, he lost to Casper Ruud 6-4, 1-6, 6-4. It was the Norwegian’s first win against the Serb and his first win against a world No 1.\n\nEn route to the last four, Djokovic defeated Safiullin, Musetti and De Minaur without dropping a set.\n\nWhat happened to Novak Djokovic at the 2024 Australian Open?\n\nJannik Sinner beat Novak Djokovic in the semi-final of the 2024 Australian Open, 6-1, 6-2, 6-7 (6), 6-3. The Serbian did not have a single break point in the match – the first time that has happened to him in a completed Grand Slam match.\n\nThe last time Djokovic had lost in the Australian Open was 2018, when he lost in the fourth round to Hyeon Chung in straight sets.\n\nWhat happened with Novak Djokovic at the 2023 Davis Cup?\n\nNovak Djokovic had a winning streak in singles in the Davis Cup that stretched back to 2011’s semi-finals, but lost that proud record in a semi-final defeat to Jannik Sinner, 6-2, 2-6, 7-5. To compound his disappointment, he then lost the deciding doubles, with Kecmanovic against Sinner and Lorenzo Sonego as Italy reached the final.\n\nWhat did Novak Djokovic do at the ATP Finals in 2023?\n\nNovak Djokovic became the first man to win the ATP Finals seven times when he beat Jannik Sinner 6-3, 6-3 in the final in Turin. Djokovic had lost to Sinner in the group stages but dropped just eight points on serve as he clinched the title, breaking free of a tie with Roger Federer. It was his 98th career title.\n\nIs Djokovic the G.O.A.T.?\n\nWhile some may have different opinions about who is their favourite player or candidate for the greatest player of all time, on all important parameters, Djokovic comes out on top as the G.O.A.T. (greatest of all time).\n\nA comment by 14-time Grand Slam champion Pete Sampras, made in November 2021, is the latest strong comment that points to Djokovic being the best tennis player of all time.\n\n“I do think what Novak’s done over the past 10 years, winning the majors, being consistent, finishing No. 1 for seven years, to me it’s a clear sign that he is the greatest of all time,” Sampras said.\n\nAlexander Zverev, the player Djokovic beat to reach the 2021 US Open final, called the Serb mentally the greatest player in the history of the sport following his five-set loss in the semi-final at Flushing Meadows.\n\n“There is a reason why he’s won 20 Grand Slams [at that time],” Zverev said. “There’s a reason why he’s spent the most weeks at world No. 1. There’s a lot of reasons for that. I think mentally he’s the best player to ever play the game. Mentally in the most important moments I would rather play against anybody else but him.”\n\nNiki Pilic, the former French Open runner-up who coached Djokovic from the age of 12, said there was no doubt in his mind that the Serbian will go down as the best player of all time. “Djokovic has won the most Masters titles, he is the only player to have won every Slam at least twice, and at one point he had almost 17.000 ATP points – in that moment, he accumulated more points than Murray, Nadal and Federer combined. I am not being biased, Novak is the best of all time,” he told a Croatian newspaper.\n\nDjokovic himself has demurred, saying he considers the debate “disrespectful” to those who played in previous eras.\n\nHow many Grand Slam titles has Djokovic won?\n\nDjokovic’s triumph at the 2023 US Open was the 24th Grand Slam singles title of his career. That makes him tied for the most Grand Slam singles titles in the history of the sport along with Margaret Court. The Serb holds the record for the most slams won in the Open Era.\n\nThe Serb has won more titles at the Australian Open than any other player. He owns 10 titles in Melbourne and is 20-0 combined in semi-finals and finals at Melbourne Park. The Serb is also a ringer on the Wimbledon grass, where has now won seven titles – the same as his childhood hero Pete Sampras. He is the only man to complete the career Grand Slam three times, having done it for a third time by winning Roland-Garros in 2023.\n\nList of all-time Grand Slam singles winners\n\nNovak Djokovic and Margaret Court – 24\n\nSerena Williams – 23\n\nSteffi Graf and Rafael Nadal – 22\n\nRoger Federer – 20\n\nHow many ATP Tour titles has Novak Djokovic won?\n\nNovak Djokovic has won 98 titles on the ATP Tour, putting him third on the all-time list, behind Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103). He won his first ATP Tour title in Amersfort, the Netherlands, in 2006 and his most recent victory came at the ATP Finals in Turin in 2023, where he won the title for a record seventh time.\n\nWhat did Novak Djokovic do at US Open 2023?\n\nNovak Djokovic won his 24th Grand Slam title at the US Open 2023, defeating Daniil Medvedev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the final.\n\nThe victory sees Djokovic tie Margaret Court’s all-time record of 24 Grand Slams, and is his fourth title at the US Open.\n\n“Last couple years I felt I had a chance, a shot at history. Why not grab it if it’s presented?” said Djokovic after winning the title.\n\nPrior to the final, the 36-year-old defeated Ben Shelton in the semi-finals 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (4) and Taylor Fritz, the ninth seed, in the quarter-finals, 6-1, 6-4, 6-4. Earlier in the tournament, Djokovic has been forced to come back from two sets down against compatriot Laslo Djere, defeating the 32nd seed 4-6, 4-6, 6-1, 6-1, 6-2.\n\nWhat did Novak Djokovic do at Wimbledon 2023?\n\nNovak Djokovic made the final of Wimbledon 2023, finishing runner-up to Carlos Alcaraz in a superb five-set battle.\n\nHe beat Jannik Sinner of Italy 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (4) in the semi-final to reach his ninth Wimbledon final. By reaching the semi-finals, Djokovic equalled Roger Federer’s all-time record of 46 Grand Slam semi-final appearances.\n\nWhat did Novak Djokovic do at Roland-Garros in 2023?\n\nNovak Djokovic won the title by beating Casper Ruud 7-6 (1), 6-3, 7-5 in the final, meaning he won his 23rd Grand Slam – a record in men’s tennis.\n\nWhat did Novak Djokovic do at the 2023 Australian Open?\n\nA year after he was deported from Australia over his decision not to be vaccinated against Covid-19, Novak Djokovic returned to Melbourne Park, and won a record 10th Australian Open title.\n\nHis 6-3, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (5) win over Stefanos Tsitsipas put him alongside Rafael Nadal on a men’s record 22 Grand Slam titles and means he will also return to the world No 1 ranking.\n\n“What a journey it’s been. I have to say this has been one of the most challenging tournaments I’ve ever played in my life, considering the circumstances,” said Djokovic, wearing a jacket with 22 emblazoned on it. “Not playing last year, coming back this year. Only my team and my family knows what we have been through in the past five weeks. This is probably the biggest victory in my life, considering the circumstances.”\n\nWhy was Djokovic deported from Australia in 2022?\n\nNovak Djokovic was deported out of Australia in January 2022 after a legal battle over his entry into the country and, as a result, the Serb was unable to play the Australian Open in 2022.\n\nThe world No 1 was told by Tennis Australia that he could have an exemption to play the tournament because he had tested positive for Covid-19 in December 2021. However, when he landed in Australia, Djokovic was questioned by Australian border officials, had his visa revoked and was then held in a detention centre in Melbourne while his case was debated.\n\nDjokovic spent most of the week before the Australian Open in the detention centre as he appealed against the decision to revoke his visa. He won the first appeal but after the Australian government revoked it for a second time, he lost the appeal, the government asserting that letting Djokovic play would give anti-vaccination sentiment a boost.\n\nDjokovic returned to action in the ATP event in Dubai in February, losing in the quarter-final and relinquishing his No 1 ranking to Daniil Medvedev. He did not play in the Masters 1000 events in Indian Wells and Miami because unvaccinated people are not allowed to travel to the United States except in select circumstances but has been able to play in Europe during the clay court stretch.\n\nWhat did Novak Djokovic do at the ATP Finals in 2022?\n\nNovak Djokovic made history at the ATP Finals in Turin in November 2022 when he became the oldest man, at 35, to win the season-ending event. The Serb beat Casper Ruud 7-5, 6-3 to win the title for the first time since 2015 and the sixth time in all, equalling the record held by Roger Federer.\n\nIs Djokovic vaccinated against COVID-19?\n\nThe Serb has not been vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus, which caused him to miss the 2022 US Open. The decision divided opinion across the globe about his decision but the Serb remained steadfast in his belief that he did not want to take the vaccine.\n\nIn February 2022, Djokovic was asked during an interview with the BBC if he was willing to sacrifice the chase for history at events like the French Open at Wimbledon that year in order to avoid getting the jab, the Serb replied: “Yes, that is the price that I’m willing to pay.”\n\nWhy did Novak Djokovic not play the 2022 US Open?\n\nDjokovic was not allowed to participate in the 2022 US Open because of his decision not to be vaccinated against Covid-19. United States law, at the time, said that only vaccinated non-residents would be allowed into the country. Not being able to defend his title saw him drop to No 7 in the rankings.\n\nHas Djokovic ever won the calendar-year Grand Slam?\n\nNo, but he came awfully close in 2021. After winning the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon, Novak Djokovic got to within one win of joining Rod Laver (1962 and 1969) and Don Budge (1938) as the only men to win all four majors in the same year.\n\nBut his quest for history – and a then-record 21st Grand Slam title ended when he was beaten in straight sets by Daniil Medvedev in the final.\n\nHow many Grand Slams can the Serb win?\n\nWhile the Serb himself has not publicly spoken about how many Grand Slam titles he will end up with eventually, his former coach Marian Vajda believes that there are no limits for Djokovic.\n\nIn an interview in the summer of 2019, Vajda said, “We try to live in the present moment, because projecting too far can only be counterproductive. I could say two, three or four years, who knows, all I know is that he is not close to stopping. I do not want to limit him, let him play another year, then another, and then another.”\n\nMeanwhile, tennis coach Patrick Mouratoglou believes that Djokovic is in prime physical condition and could win up to 25 to 30 Grand Slams while competing for the next three to four years.\n\nWhat are his biggest achievements?\n\nDjokovic’s 24 Grand Slam titles puts him two ahead of Rafael Nadal at the top of the list for most men’s singles Grand Slam titles list, and four ahead of Roger Federer.\n\nThe Serb has won 10 Australian Open titles, seven Wimbledon crowns, three Roland-Garros titles and four US Open titles. He has also won a total of 98 career titles, including a record 40 Masters 1000 crowns – most recently the 2023 Rolex Paris Masters.\n\nOn November 6, 2021, his win over Hubert Hurkacz at the Paris Masters ensured he would end the year ranked world No 1 for a record seventh time. For good measure, he beat Daniil Medvedev to win Paris for the sixth time. In November 2023, Djokovic then extended his year-end No 1 record by clinching top spot for the eighth time in his career, courtesy of an opening match win against Holger Rune at the 2023 ATP Finals.\n\nDjokovic has also broken the all-time ATP record for weeks at No 1, earlier held by Roger Federer at 310 weeks. Djokovic spent his 311th week as world No 1 in March 2021. As of November 19, 2023, Djokovic has spent a record 399 weeks as the world No 1. He returned to the world No 1 spot on September 11, 2023.\n\nHas he ever won the Olympic gold medal?\n\nNo, the Serb was beaten in the semi-finals in 2008 and 2012. He won the bronze medal in 2008 but missed out in London in 2012, was beaten in the first round by Juan Martin del Potro in 2016 and in Tokyo in 2021, he lost to Pablo Carreno Busta in the bronze medal match, having been upended by Alexander Zverev, of Germany, in the semi-finals.\n\nThe Serb has often spoken about his desire to win an Olympic gold and has his eyes set on the 2023 Olympics in Paris.\n\nWhen was Novak Djokovic born?\n\nNovak Djokovic was born in Beograd, Yugoslavia, on May 22, 1987.\n\nWhat is his nationality?\n\nDjokovic is Serbian. He often speaks about his pride to represent his country around the world. “Our country’s image has been really bad,” he explained in an interview for French newspaper L’Equipe in 2014. “So I try to best represent my country, give a positive image, show that we are proud and hospitable.” Djokovic regularly represents Serbia in international competitions. He won the Davis Cup in 2010 and the ATP Cup in 2020 for Serbia, as well as the Hopman Cup (2008, 2013).\n\nHe has also competed at four Olympic Games and won a bronze medal in singles back at the 2008 Beijing Games.\n\nWho is Novak Djokovic’s wife?\n\nJelena Djokovic (formerly Ristic) is Novak’s wife. The couple met in high school and started dating in 2005, when Novak was only 18. They got married in July 2014, in Sveti Stefan, Montenegro.\n\nHow many children does Novak Djokovic have?\n\nThe couple have two children. Their son Stefan was born in Nice on October 21, 2014. Their daughter Tara came into the world on September 2, 2017.\n\nWho is Djokovic’s coach?\n\nAfter 15 years with Marian Vajda in his team, he split with the Slovakian on March 1, 2022.\n\nDjokovic’s most recent coach was Croatia’s Goran Ivanisevic, the Wimbledon champion in 2001 and a former world No 2. Djokovic worked with Ivanisevic for six years, beginning in 2018, before they parted ways in March 2024. He has yet to announce who his next coach will be.\n\nVajda had been coaching Djokovic since June 2006. Before Vajda, Djokovic had worked with Dejan Petrovic and Riccardo Piatti. Periodically helped by Mark Woodforde and Todd Martin, Vajda formed a high-profile coaching duo with Boris Becker from 2014 to 2016. Djokovic split with Vajda in May 2017 and hired Andre Agassi as his main coach. The partnership lasted for just one year. Vajda came back alongside Djokovic in the spring of 2018 and was then joined by Ivanisevic in July 2019.\n\nWho are Novak Djokovic’s parents?\n\nHis father Srdjan is Serbian and his mother Dijana, born in Zagar, is Croatian. They owned the society Family Sports, which ran three restaurants and a tennis academy. Srdjan was a professional skier, like Djokovic’s uncle and aunt, and a decent footballer. He tends to speak out to take his son’s defence or sometimes to criticise his opponents. Djokovic has two brothers, Marko and Djordje. They also played professional tennis, but were not able to successfully transition to the main ATP Tour level.\n\nWhen did Djokovic begin to play tennis?\n\nNovak Djokovic first picked up a racquet at the age of four. Spotted during the summer of 1993 by Jelena Gencic, a former tennis and handball player who then became his coach for six years, he was sent in 1999 to the Pilic Academy in Oberschleißheim, nearby Munich, Germany. In 2001, Djokovic was crowned European junior champion in singles and doubles. He also placed as runner-up at the World Championship with Yugoslavia. His idol was Pete Sampras when he was growing up.\n\nHow is Novak Djokovic’s name pronounced?\n\nThe English translation for his family name is somewhat true to its phonetic pronunciation: “Djo”, as in “Johnny”, “Ko” as in “Koala”, then “Vitch”, as the C at the end has an accent in Serbian. As for his first name, “No” is pronounced “Gno”, as in “Gnome”, and “Vak” is said as in “Vacuum” – Gno-vak Djo-ko-vitch.\n\nHow much prize money has Novak Djokovic won in his career?\n\nAs of July 15, 2024, Djokovic has won $182.4 million. You can find his very latest prize money stats on the official ATP Tour website.\n\nWho is Novak Djokovic’s agent?\n\nDjokovic was represented by Edoardo Artlaldi from 2008 to 2023, but confirmed on November 1, 2023, that they had parted company. Artakdi and his wife, Elena Capellaro, who controlled his media affairs, are no longer part of the team. Djokovic’s new agent is Mark Madden."
