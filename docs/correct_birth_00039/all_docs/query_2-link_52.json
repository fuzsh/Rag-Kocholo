        "text": "As Novak Djokovic sets out to capture his record 25th Grand Slam title at Wimbledon 2024, it’s essential to get to know the incredible woman behind the tennis legend, Jelena Djokovic (née Ristic). Born and raised in Belgrade, Serbia, Jelena’s journey from a small village to the world stage is both heartwarming and inspiring. As of 2024, Jelena is 37 years old, and her estimated net worth stands at $2 million.\n\nWhere Did Jelena Djokovic Grow Up?\n\nJelena Djokovic was born in 1986 to Miomir and Vera Ristic. She grew up in Belgrade with her older sister, Marija, who she often refers to as her best friend. Jelena has fond memories of spending time at her grandparents’ home in Ljig, Serbia, where she enjoyed her grandmother’s homemade doughnuts by the local swimming pool.\n\nHow Did Jelena’s Education Shape Her Career?\n\nAt 18, Jelena moved to Italy to attend Bocconi University in Milan, where she studied luxury brand management. Her education didn’t stop there; after graduating, she pursued a master’s degree at the International University of Monaco. This solid educational foundation enabled Jelena to develop a keen business acumen, which has been instrumental in her various professional endeavors.\n\nHow Did Jelena Meet Novak Djokovic?\n\nJelena met Novak Djokovic in high school, where both attended a sports academy in Serbia. Their relationship began in the early 2000s, with their first date taking place at a sports bar in Monte Carlo, which Jelena recalls as being particularly awkward. Despite the challenges of being young and financially constrained, they devised creative ways to maintain their relationship.\n\nHow Did Their Relationship Evolve?\n\nAfter graduating, Jelena and Novak moved in together in Monte Carlo, where Jelena pursued her master’s degree. The couple dated for many years before marrying in 2014 at the Aman Sveti Stefan Resort in Montenegro. Jelena was pregnant with their first child at the time. Novak reminisced about seeing her in her wedding dress, describing the moment as perfect. Jelena, overwhelmed with emotion, felt similarly blessed to have Novak as her partner.\n\nHow Many Children Do Jelena and Novak Have?\n\nJelena and Novak have two children: their son Stefan, born in October 2014, and their daughter Tara, born in September 2017. Jelena is often seen in Novak’s player’s box at his matches, accompanied by their children. The family is known for their close-knit bond and support for one another, both on and off the court.\n\nWhat Is the Novak Djokovic Foundation?\n\nIn 2007, Novak and Jelena founded the Novak Djokovic Foundation. Jelena is deeply involved in the charity, focusing on early childhood education. Her biography on the foundation’s website describes her as an avid learner with a passion for helping others. She strives to live by values such as gratitude, honesty, respect, kindness, forgiveness, and love. Despite her busy schedule, Jelena finds time to indulge in her love for reading, often devouring books.\n\nWhat Impact Has Jelena Had on Novak’s Career?\n\nNovak Djokovic has often credited his family for his success on the tennis court. Jelena’s unwavering support has provided him with a stable and loving home environment, which he believes is crucial for maintaining his performance. “Whether I’m winning or losing, she’s always there,” Novak has said. “Family’s always there. When I go back home, I’m not a tennis player anymore. I’m a father and a husband.” Novak also humorously suggests that other players should follow his lead: “Get married, have kids, let’s enjoy this.”\n\nHow Does Jelena Balance Her Roles?\n\nBalancing her roles as a mother, wife, and businesswoman is no easy task, but Jelena manages it with grace. Her commitment to the Novak Djokovic Foundation reflects her dedication to making a positive impact on society. Additionally, her background in luxury brand management and her continued pursuit of knowledge demonstrate her multifaceted capabilities.\n\nWhat’s Next for Jelena Djokovic?\n\nAs Novak continues to chase his tennis dreams, Jelena remains a constant pillar of support. Her journey from a small village in Serbia to the global stage alongside her husband is a testament to her strength and resilience. Jelena’s story is a beautiful reminder of the power of love, support, and perseverance. As Novak aims for his 25th Grand Slam title, Jelena’s role in his life and career is undeniable, making her an integral part of his success story."
