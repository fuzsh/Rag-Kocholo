        "text": "After his 2021 French Open title-winning victory Saturday over Stefanos Tsitsipas at Roland Garros, Novak Djokovic seems poised to topple Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal (each has 20) as tennis’s all-time Grand Slam winner. Seems like it’s one of those sports statistics when it’s: not if, but when.\n\nMeanwhile, his fellow Serbian, Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic (whose season ended on a low note with his ejection in Denver’s Game 4 loss to the Phoenix Suns), was recently named the 2021 NBA MVP.\n\nHere are the details on the sports world’s two biggest Jokers, Serbia legends and their huge accomplishments in 2021."
