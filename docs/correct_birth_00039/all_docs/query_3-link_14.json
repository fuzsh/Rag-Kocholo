        "text": "Only the best for the best. As of June 2023, Novak Djokovic officially broke the record for most weeks as the world’s number one tennis player—378—beating out longtime record-holder Steffi Graf. The Serbian-born athlete began his professional career in 2003, quickly rising the ranks in the international tennis scene to join the likes of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal as one of the most dominating players in the game. He has since propelled himself to the next level of superstardom, earning his 10th Australian Open title and a record-breaking 23rd major title at the French Open in early 2023. Given his incredible international accomplishments, it should come as no surprise that Djokovic has invested plenty of his fortune in luxury real estate around the globe, with homes in Monte Carlo, Miami, New York City, Marbella, and even his hometown of Belgrade. Below, take a peek inside the stunning residences that Djokovic has called home over the years.\n\nEarly 2000s\n\nFollowing the lead of numerous pro athletes like Stefanos Tsitsipas and Caroline Wozniacki, Djokovic picked up a residence in Monte Carlo for an undisclosed amount shortly after going pro in 2003. According to reports, the athlete began spending a significant amount of time in the picturesque locale when he was 17 due to his tournaments and his coach’s residence there. What little is known of the property includes that it rests on a hill overlooking the Mediterranean sea, and that Djokovic considered it his main residence for about 15 years before relocating to Spain in 2020.\n\nIn Monte Carlo, the pro athlete frequented the Monte-Carlo Country Club, telling Yahoo! News in 2023, “It is a club I know very well. Quite a few top players reside in Monaco and use this club as a training base. The club transforms incredibly during the weeks of the tournament, but it is a great feeling to sleep in your own bed.” He still owns this property.\n\n2017\n\nThat same year, the tennis pro shelled out $5.77 million for a penthouse in another Renzo Piano–designed building, this time in Miami. “I love the design of these two buildings and their location is fantastic,” Djokovic said in a statement at the time. “Both New York and Miami are on my travel list every year, and it will be exciting to have a place to come back to.” The impressive glass-fronted condo measured 2,421 square feet and featured three bedrooms and three-and-a-half bathrooms, with unobstructed views of the Atlantic Ocean. Building amenities included a plunge and infinity pool, a library, and a state-of-the-art gym and spa. Djokovic never actually spent time in the home, however; it completed construction in December 2019 and he promptly listed it for $7.15 million just one month later. The pad finally sold the following year right after his 19th Grand Slam title at Roland Garros, for slightly less than asking at $6 million.\n\n2018\n\nDjokovic’s next real estate purchase took him back to his roots in Belgrade, Serbia. There, he picked up a penthouse apartment overlooking Lake Pavlova for $675,000. The unit features three bedrooms and three-and-a-half bathrooms, a large living room, and a terrace with a pool. The tennis pro reportedly invested a good amount of time and money into modernizing the pad much as he had also, over the years, been using his success to help bolster Serbia as a tourist destination. In 2009, for instance, Djokovic and his family built the Novak Tennis Center, which features 14 courts—11 of which are clay—meant to serve as both a tourist attraction and a local gathering spot. Other Djokovic-inspired points of interest include Novak 1 Cafe & Restaurant, opened by his parents after his career success, and Square Nine, the city’s only luxury five-star hotel, where Djokovic reportedly stayed with his family while his apartment was undergoing renovations.\n\n2020\n\nDjokovic’s latest purchase is also his newest home base: a $10 million Moroccan-style mansion in Marbella, Spain. The tennis champion’s residence comprises nine bedrooms and eight bathrooms, and he’s shared some peeks into his home through his Instagram posts (especially given that he and his family hunkered down there for the majority of the pandemic). Glimpses into the home reveal marble floors, crystal chandeliers, and open, arched doorways. There is also a massive home theater, a Turkish bath, a large indoor gym, and of course, a spacious tennis court where Djokovic has been known to practice tennis with his two young children."
