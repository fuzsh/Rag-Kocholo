        "text": "Grand Slam Champion\n\nIn 2008 Djokovic won his first Grand Slam tournament, the Australian Open. He thereby became the first Serbian man to win one of tennis’s four most prestigious singles championships. In December 2010 Djokovic led the Serbian Davis Cup team to the country’s first Davis Cup title. His Davis Cup victories marked the beginning of a 43-match winning streak—the third longest such streak among men in the Open era (since 1968). Djokovic’s remarkable streak included a second Australian Open title in January 2011. His streak ended with a French Open semifinal loss to Federer. However, Djokovic’s strong play helped him rise to the number-one world ranking shortly after he defeated Rafael Nadal to capture the 2011 Wimbledon championship. Djokovic later defeated Nadal in the U.S. Open final to claim his third Grand Slam title of the year.\n\nDjokovic again bested Nadal to win the 2012 Australian Open. In 2013 Djokovic defeated Andy Murray to win his fourth Australian Open title. He captured another Wimbledon championship the following year when he beat Federer in a five-set final. He again beat Murray to earn his fifth career Australian Open in 2015, which made Djokovic the all-time leader in Australian Open men’s singles championships during the Open era. After losing to Stan Wawrinka in the 2015 French Open final, the top-ranked Djokovic bested Federer to win his third Wimbledon championship. Djokovic also beat Federer in the 2015 U.S. Open final to capture his 10th career Grand Slam title.\n\nDjokovic beat Murray in straight sets in the final of the 2016 Australian Open. He again bested Murray in the final of the 2016 French Open, a victory that gave Djokovic his first French Open championship. With his win at the French Open, Djokovic became the eighth man in the history of the sport to complete a career Grand Slam by having won each of the four major tennis tournaments. He was the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold those four titles simultaneously. Djokovic later reached the finals of the 2016 U.S. Open but lost a four-set match to Wawrinka.\n\nDjokovic failed to advance past the quarterfinals in the first three Grand Slam tournaments of 2017. In July he announced that he would not play the remainder of the year in order to treat an elbow injury that had been bothering him. Djokovic returned to top form in 2018, when he won his fourth Wimbledon title with a straight-set victory over Kevin Anderson. Djokovic subsequently defeated Juan Martin del Potro to earn his third U.S. Open championship. In January 2019 Djokovic beat Nadal in the final of the Australian Open. The victory gave Djokovic his seventh career Australian Open singles title, the most in the history of that tournament. The following July he once again met Federer in the Wimbledon final. The two dueled for 4 hours and 57 minutes before Djokovic halted Federer in a fifth-set tiebreaker. The match was the longest singles final in the history of Wimbledon.\n\nAt the 2020 Australian Open Djokovic successfully defended his title with a five-set victory over Dominic Thiem of Austria. Later that year Djokovic returned to the French Open final, where he lost to Nadal in straight sets. In February 2021 Djokovic defeated Daniil Medvedev of Russia to garner his third consecutive Australian Open title. At the French Open in June Djokovic met Nadal in a semifinal match that became an instant classic. After losing the first set 3–6 to Nadal, Djokovic came back to win the next three sets 6-3, 7-6, 6-2. Their dramatic match had threatened to extend past a nationwide curfew imposed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, French government authorities granted a special exception so that spectators at Roland Garros Stadium in Paris could stay through the end of the match. Two days later, in the final, Djokovic turned in another epic performance. He rallied from two sets down to defeat Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece in five sets.\n\nDjokovic continued his dominant play with a four-set victory over Matteo Berrettini of Italy in the Wimbledon final in July 2021. The win pushed Djokovic’s number of career Grand Slam singles championships to 20. The mark tied him with Federer and Nadal for the most Grand Slam men’s singles titles of all time. Nadal later broke the tie by winning the 2022 Australian Open. Djokovic had intended to compete in that tournament. Before play began, however, the Australian government canceled his visa “in the public interest” because Djokovic was not vaccinated against COVID-19. The government concluded that Djokovic had not acquired a valid medical exemption before traveling to Australia and that he had listed inaccurate information on his travel declaration form. Djokovic was subsequently deported from Australia after a federal court there dismissed his appeal of the government’s decision.\n\nAt the 2022 French Open Djokovic lost in the quarterfinals to Nadal, who went on to win the tournament. Djokovic rebounded that year at Wimbledon, where he successfully defended his title. Facing Australian Nick Kyrgios in the final, Djokovic dropped the first set but won the next three to secure the 21st Grand Slam singles title of his career.\n\nIn 2023 Djokovic returned to Australia, which had relaxed its COVID-19 rules. He won his 10th Australian Open title by defeating Tsitsipas in straight sets. With the win, Djokovic again tied Nadal for most Grand Slam men’s singles championships. At the French Open several months later, Djokovic claimed sole possession of the record with a win over Casper Ruud of Norway in the final. By capturing his third career French Open title, Djokovic became the first men’s player to have won each of the Grand Slam tournaments at least three times. At Wimbledon in July, Djokovic lost a five-set thriller to Carlos Alcaraz of Spain in the final. In September Djokovic earned his fourth career U.S. Open title and 24th Grand Slam championship with a straight-set victory over Medvedev."
