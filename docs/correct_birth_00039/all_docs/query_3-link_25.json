        "text": "Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic may hold the most Grand Slams ever, but one prize that has eluded him so far has been the coveted Olympic gold. Djokovicâ€™s sole Olympics medal came in Beijing 2008, where he won bronze. He missed another bronze after unceremoniously losing in Tokyo 2020.\n\nIn an era dominated by Nadal and possibly about to be dominated by Carlos Alcaraz, Djokovic has won three French Open titles on the clay court at Roland Garros. But after a crushing loss to Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final, Djokovic will have his work cut out to earn a first Olympic gold."
