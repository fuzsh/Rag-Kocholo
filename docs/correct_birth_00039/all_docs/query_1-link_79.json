        "text": "Novak Djokovic has opened up on his war-impacted childhood and the \"trauma\" that still effects him today.\n\nThe 24-time grand slam champion sat down with Nine's Today host Karl Stefanovic for an in-depth interview amid his Australian Open run, which ended at the hands of eventual winner Jannik Sinner on Friday.\n\nDjokovic was born in the Serbian capital of Belgrade and spent much of his childhood seeing war around him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nREAD MORE: Sinner seals emotional maiden slam with 'epic' comeback\n\nREAD MORE: The 'special' Aussie who guided Sinner to title\n\nREAD MORE: Medvedev makes unwanted grand slam history\n\n\"We've been through two wars... for four years from 1992 to '96 no Serbian athlete could travel abroad for any competitions,\" Djokovic explained.\n\n\"It was very challenging times. It just toughens you up.\n\n\"It could have gone another way, but I believe it was kind of a destiny as well for me to play tennis and to be able to achieve these great things.\"\n\nDjokovic, 36, is widely considered the best men's tennis player ever and has 24 major trophies to prove it.\n\nHis on-court mental fortitude is a feature of his champion ways, and can be credited in part - he says - to his troubled childhood.\n\n\"I don't know to what extent, but there is definitely some connection to my upbringing,\" he said.\n\n\"I was 12 when we had bombings nonstop for two and a half months, day and night.\n\n\"At time it appears, mostly when I hear fireworks. When I hear that sound it really reminds me of those bombs exploding, grenades and stuff.\n\n\"It's not super pleasant, I still have a bit of trauma.\"\n\nDjokovic fell short of adding a 10th Australian Open title to his already-record haul.\n\nStefanovic asked Djokovic if he's dealing OK with leaving his wife and two children at home while he goes on tour.\n\n\"Not really, to be honest. I do struggle with that more and more as the time goes on,\" Djokovic said.\n\n\"Australia is a long trip, probably the longest trip we have in the entire year. Being away for five weeks is quite a lot.\n\n\"My son is nine, my daughter is six, every day, every week they change, there's a lot happening.\n\n\"My daughter's first tooth went out and I wasn't there for that. But it's all about balance.\""
