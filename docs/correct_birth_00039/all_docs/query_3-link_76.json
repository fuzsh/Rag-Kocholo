        "text": "Novak Djokovic succumbed to the brilliance of a red-hot Carlos Alcaraz yesterday, losing the Wimbledon final in three straight sets.\n\nThe Serbian player was bidding to draw level on eight Wimbledon titles with Roger Federer but failed as he was beaten emphatically.\n\nDjokovic is now 37-years-old and after having surgery on his knee just weeks ago, this was still a good fortnight for him at the tournament.\n\nAlcaraz was in scintillating form yesterday and the seven-time champion had no answer to his sheer brilliance.\n\nAfter the final, Djokovic had some kind words for Alcaraz – sharing something he noticed that had changed about him from the final they played 12 months ago.\n\nNovak Djokovic noticed what had changed about Carlos Alcaraz this year\n\nEyebrows were raised when Alcaraz won the toss and chose to receive before a ball had even been hit. But his plan worked to perfection.\n\nAlcaraz took the opening set in 41 minutes winning it 6-2, with 14 of those minutes taken up from Djokovic’s very first service game.\n\nThe seven-time winner lost the game and that really did set the tone for the rest of the match.\n\nMore Tennis News\n\nDjokovic said in his press conference after his defeat: “The first game was incredible. One of the longest first games I have ever played. That set the tone.\n\n“He was coming out from the blocks ready to battle and play his best level right away. That wasn’t the case last year, where I started better and had a comfortable first-set win.\n\n“But today, from the first point, he was there, he was ready for me.”\n\nWimbledon 2024 saw a changing of the guard\n\nDjokovic is running out of time to eclipse Roger Federer and win the two titles he needs to be the most successful male player at Wimbledon of all time.\n\nHe is stuck on seven titles and he must wonder if, with every passing defeat at SW19, his chances of winning another one are over.\n\nAlcaraz has now beaten him in the last two finals and if last year’s was a classic this one was anything but.\n\nIt was probably the first time in his career at Wimbledon that Djokovic has been truly outplayed in a final – and he won’t have enjoyed it one bit.\n\nAlcaraz is now very much the man to beat and on current form, he’s going to take some stopping at Wimbledon in future years."
