        "text": "Novak Djokovic has arrived home in Serbia to be greeted by fans, hordes of international media, and warnings from France about his participation in the French Open.\n\nLocals inside the terminal at Belgrade airport asked for his picture and autograph, before he was whisked away through a VIP exit.\n\nThe athlete's movements have been closely tracked by the global media and his avid Serbian supporters who wanted to offer him a hero's welcome.\n\n\"We came here to support Novak Djokovic in his fight against the Australian government,\" Mihijlo Vejkl told the ABC.\n\n\"In Serbia when he plays it means everything to us, it's like a holiday in our country.\"\n\nAt the exit of the airport, groups chanted \"Djokovic, Djokovic, Djokovic\" while jumping and waving the Serbian flag.\n\nOthers carried signs that said: \"Welcome Nole.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry for him, because he's so good — I could cry, because he just didn't deserve this,” Djokovic fan Maja Marjanović told the ABC.\n\nLoading...\n\nBut his local fans were outnumbered by dozens of media crews that had travelled from around the world to capture the final chapter in his visa saga.\n\nThe men's world number one left Melbourne after a tumultuous 11-day stay in Australia, that saw his visa cancelled twice, and two court challenges.\n\nUltimately, the Federal Court ruled in favour of Immigration Minister Alex Hawke using his ministerial powers to deport Djokovic on public interest grounds.\n\nMr Hawke cancelled Djokovic’s visa for a second time because he believed his presence in Australia would \"provoke anti-vaccination sentiment\".\n\nHis visa was initially cancelled by Australian Border Force officers at Melbourne airport for failing to meet vaccine entry requirements, but the Serbian athlete won a court appeal against that decision.\n\nThe result means Djokovic, who was seeking a record 21st men's grand slam singles title, will have to watch from afar as longtime rival Rafael Nadal looks to do just that.\n\nFrench Open will offer 'no exemptions'\n\nDjokovic's COVID vaccine status could cause him more headaches in the future.\n\nA spokesperson for France's Ministry of Sport has warned there would be no exemption for unvaccinated players at the upcoming French Open in May.\n\nThe country recently introduced COVID passes requiring individuals to receive two vaccination doses before they can enter many venues, including Roland Garros.\n\n\"The rule is simple. The vaccine pass will be imposed, as soon as the law is promulgated, in establishments that were already subject to the health pass,\" the ministry said in a statement.\n\n\"Now, as far as Roland Garros is concerned, it's in May, the situation may change between now and then and we hope that it will be more favourable, we'll see, but clearly there's no exemption.\"\n\nThe country’s Sports Minister, Roxana Maracineanu, backed the hardline approach.\n\n“It will become compulsory to enter public buildings already subject to the health pass (stadium, theatre or lounge) for all spectators, practitioners, French or foreign professionals,” she wrote on social media.\n\nThe country’s vaccine pass system also applies to hospitality and entertainment venues like cafes, restaurants and museums.\n\nThe debate over vaccine status at major tournaments has stirred controversy in the tennis world.\n\nNadal said that “the best players should be on the court”, while addressing media at Melbourne Park.\n\n''That's better for the sport, without a doubt, and if Novak Djokovic is playing here it is better for everybody,\" he said.\n\nThe Spanish player has previously spoken in support of vaccinations but said the situation at the Australian Open with Djokovic had \"been a mess\"."
