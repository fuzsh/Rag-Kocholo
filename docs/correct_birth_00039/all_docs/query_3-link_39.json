        "text": "Novak Djokovic was beaten in a one-sided Wimbledon final by Carlos Alcaraz – but there are still \"two big goals\" ahead for the 24-time Grand Slam winner this summer.\n\nDjokovic made a remarkable return from knee surgery to make the final at SW19, but he was no match for Alcaraz, who won in straight sets to claim his fourth major.\n\nDjokovic admitted afterwards that he has not been at the level of Alcaraz or world No. 1 Jannik Sinner this year.\n\nOlympic Games Paris 2024\n\nNadal: 'No decision' made on US Open despite appearing on entry list\n\n18/07/2024 at 21:45\n\nHowever, Djokovic is hoping to return to his best ahead of the Paris 2024 Olympics and the hard-court swing in North America.\n\nDjokovic focused on ‘two big goals’\n\nAfter being in a race against time to make Wimbledon following knee surgery, now the challenge for Djokovic is switching from grass back to clay.\n\nIt’s just three weeks before the tennis event starts at the Paris Olympics on July 27.\n\nThe competition will be played at Roland-Garros, the home of the French Open, and there are several clay tournaments taking place beforehand.\n\nRafael Nadal, who skipped Wimbledon to focus on preparing for the Games, is playing in Bastad this week to get some clay action under his belt.\n\nDjokovic is not currently entered into any events and looks as though he will next be on court at the Olympics representing Serbia.\n\nSpeaking after the Wimbledon final, Djokovic said: “I still have intentions to play Olympic Games, hopefully have a chance to fight for a medal for my country. On a completely different surface obviously, going back to the place where I got injured some weeks ago. Let's see.\n\n“Let's see how physically and mentally I'm going to feel. Hopefully I can find the right tennis because I'm going to need all I have and more to go to the final of the Olympic Games.\n\n“The Olympic Games and US Open are the two big goals for the rest of the year for me really. I'm hoping I can be at my best on those two tournaments.”\n\nThe US Open, the final major of the year, starts on August 26, three weeks after the conclusion of the tennis event at the Olympics.\n\nIf Djokovic goes far in Paris then he might only be able to squeeze in one hard-court event ahead of the US Open – either the Cincinnati Open, which starts on August 12, or Winston-Salem, which starts on August 18.\n\nThere is also the Canadian Open, but that starts on August 6, two days after the Olympic tennis final.\n\nATP summer calendar\n\nWeek startingTournament/sJuly 15Hamburg Open, Hall of Fame Open, Swiss Open, Bastad OpenJuly 21Croatia Open, Atlanta Open, Generali OpenJuly 27Olympic Games, Citi OpenAugust 6Canadian OpenAugust 12Cincinnati OpenAugust 18Winston-Salem OpenAugust 26US Open\n\nDjokovic: I want to keep playing\n\nEven though Djokovic was well beaten in the Wimbledon final there was no indication that he will be following Andy Murray in stepping away from the sport.\n\nThe 37-year-old, who is tied with Margaret Court for the most Grand Slam titles in history, said he intends to keep playing.\n\n“As far as coming back here, I mean, I would love to. I don't have anything else in my thoughts right now that this is my last Wimbledon. I really want to play at least whatever…I don't know.\n\n“I don't have any limitations in my mind. I still want to keep going and play as long as I feel like I can play on this high level.”\n\nHighlights: Nadal and Ruud beat Andreozzi and Reyes-Varela in doubles at Nordea Open\n\n- - -\n\ndiscovery+ is the streaming home of the Olympic Games, and the only place you can watch every moment of Paris 2024 this summer\n\nOlympic Games Paris 2024\n\nTennis at the Olympics: Headline doubles teams and confirmed pairings\n\n18/07/2024 at 07:04"
