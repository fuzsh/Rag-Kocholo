        "text": "The Sporting Scene\n\nWith Novak Djokovic, It Is Always a Struggle\n\nIn the U.S. Open final, against Daniil Medvedev, he battled and even seemed to tire before, as usual, emerging victorious.\n\nThe Sporting Scene\n\nAt Wimbledon, Carlos Alcaraz Defeated Novak Djokovic by Being Himself\n\nIn the most absorbing Grand Slam championship match on the men’s side in years, what mattered most was in-the-moment decision-making.\n\nThe Sporting Scene\n\nNovak Djokovic Is Making His Own History Now\n\nBy winning the French Open again, he broke a tie with Rafael Nadal for the most career Grand Slam titles on the men’s side—and he isn’t done.\n\nReplay\n\nNovak Djokovic, the Hard-Court King, Conquers His Tenth Australian Open\n\nDespite drama over a hamstring injury, a scandal regarding his father’s behavior, and criticism of his vaccination status, the Serbian great took home the men’s singles title.\n\nThe Sporting Scene\n\nRoger Federer’s Generous Farewell\n\nThe game’s greatest player invited his supreme rival—and many others—to his final match.\n\nThe Sporting Scene\n\nRoger Federer’s Beautiful Game\n\nThe great tennis champion, who has announced his retirement, got as close to the sport’s formal ideal as anyone ever has.\n\nThe Sporting Scene\n\nNick Kyrgios Does What He Wants. At Wimbledon, It Wasn’t Enough\n\nThe Australian tennis star played well, but still lost to Novak Djokovic in the final. Does he care?\n\nThe Sporting Scene\n\nDjokovic’s Strange Australian Odyssey\n\nThe tennis champion’s resistance to the COVID-19 vaccine has brought about an international fiasco at the Australian Open.\n\nDouble Take\n\nSunday Reading: The Extraordinary Game of Tennis\n\nFrom the magazine’s archive: a selection of pieces on the game and some of its most vivid personalities.\n\nThe Sporting Scene\n\nDjokovic Finally Won the Crowd, but Daniil Medvedev Won the U.S. Open\n\nMedvedev’s victory felt like tennis thrusting itself toward a future of fresh champions. It’s time.\n\nThe Sporting Scene\n\nNovak Djokovic, French Open Winner and Likely the Best Ever\n\nAlong with Barbora Krejčíková, Djokovic was a singles champion in Paris this past weekend. He has now won nineteen majors, just one fewer than Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer.\n\nThe Sporting Scene\n\nRafael Nadal’s French Open Victory Over Novak Djokovic Extends Tennis’s Best Rivalry\n\nGreat competitors don’t always yield great matches, and Sunday’s contest was lopsided.\n\nThe Sporting Scene\n\nNovak Djokovic Solves the Mind-Body Problem to Win the Australian Open\n\nIs there any modern athlete who better reflects—and, in some strange way, seems to understand—the connection between the mind and the body?\n\nThe Sporting Scene\n\nNovak Djokovic, a Spoiler and a Champion at Wimbledon\n\nAs Djokovic, the No. 1 player in the world, beat Roger Federer on Sunday, he wasn’t always at his best, but he was too flexible to break.\n\nThe Sporting Scene\n\nFederer and Nadal’s Wimbledon Rematch Showed Just How Alike the Two Greats Have Become\n\nThe more they play, and the more they distance themselves from almost everyone else, the more they seem to share.\n\nThe Sporting Scene\n\nWhy Novak Djokovic Played a Doubles Match Hours After a Singles Upset\n\nTop singles players don’t play doubles anymore, or not much, and certainly not immediately after losing in the third round of a tournament that they have won five times before.\n\nThe Sporting Scene\n\nIn the Australian Open Final, Novak Djokovic Cruises to a Lopsided Victory Over Rafael Nadal\n\nThe pair faced off for the fifty-third time, the most of any two players in the Open era, but Djokovic appeared to be the omniscient narrator of the match, defeating Nadal 6–3, 6–2, 6–3.\n\nThe Sporting Scene\n\nAt the U.S. Open, Novak Djokovic Isn’t the Most Beloved Player, But He Is the Best\n\nIn the three-hour final, there was no drama, really, just a creeping sense of inevitability. That’s how Djokovic accomplishes what he does."
