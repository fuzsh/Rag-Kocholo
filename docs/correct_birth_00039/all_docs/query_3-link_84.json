        "text": "Eurosport expert Boris Becker has given his reaction to the breaking news that Novak Djokovic has withdrawn from the French Open due to the knee injury he suffered in the fourth round.\n\nThe top seed was left in considerable pain as he valiantly battled through the injury to defeat Francisco Cerundolo in their marathon encounter on Court Philippe-Chatrier that ran from Monday afternoon into the evening.\n\nDjokovic warned during his post-match press conference that he did not yet know if he would be able to continue his run at Roland-Garros due to the setback with an MRI scan set for Tuesday.\n\nRoland-Garros\n\nAlcaraz 'already a hall of famer' after French Open title, says Zverev\n\n09/06/2024 at 19:36\n\nAs a result of his medical examinations and with the painkillers having subsided, the decision was announced on Tuesday afternoon that the 24-time Grand Slam champion would no longer be able to participate in the tournament.\n\nBecker, who coached Djokovic earlier in his career and remains a big supporter of his, expressed his dismay at the news as he gave his reaction.\n\n\"This is bad news for all Djokovic fans, and I'm one of them,\" Becker told Eurosport Germany. \"You could almost guess it after the match against Cerundolo, which he played with a limp.\n\n'In trouble' - Djokovic suffers injury as McEnroe reacts to 'absurd' schedule\n\n\"The painkillers made the fifth set easier, but he had already warned that evening what the next morning would be like. He already had knee problems at the last few tournaments but never spoke about them.\n\nThat's obviously very bitter for him. I wish him a speedy recovery so that he is fit again for the grass-court season.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's a serious injury and it won't go away tomorrow. That leaves me a bit speechless.\n\n\"You need your knees on grass, you really do slip all the time. A torn medial meniscus is a serious injury and the question naturally arises as to whether surgery is necessary.\"\n\nHe then continued on the Eurosport Germany show 'Matchball Becker': “It's a serious injury, footballers often have it - and it won't be gone tomorrow. The question is: how do you treat it? Conservatively without surgery or does he have to have it treated arthroscopically?\n\n'He's suffered so much' - Djokovic withdrawal reaction from Corretja and Wilander\n\n\"Wimbledon starts in four weeks, then the Olympics in six, seven weeks. That's the worst possible time to have an injury. Especially such a bad one. There will now be a lot of discussion in the Djokovic camp about what the right treatment is.\n\n\"After an operation like that, if he needs one, you're on crutches at first, then you lose muscle. It takes weeks, if not months, before you have 100% confidence in your knee again. It's a very difficult situation for Novak Djokovic.”\n\nBecker then turned his attention to the fact that Jannik Sinner is set to be declared the world No. 1 as a result of Djokovic being unable to go any further in the tournament.\n\n\"It's a historic moment in tennis - a new No. 1 who is playing at the moment and doesn't even know about it yet,\" he said by way of a tribute.\n\n\"It's crazy. Italy will celebrate him!\"\n\nHenman says Djokovic's 'fortitude' is just incredible\n\n- - -\n\nYou can watch every day of the 2024 French Open live and on-demand on discovery+\n\nRoland-Garros\n\nExclusive: Alcaraz 'had a lot of doubts' before momentous comeback\n\n09/06/2024 at 19:25"
