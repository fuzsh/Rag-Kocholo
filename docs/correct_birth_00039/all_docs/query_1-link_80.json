        "text": "The name Novak Djokovic is no stranger to anyone who loves tennis. Curious about what this tennis star stands for?

Nole is a common nickname for the word Novak in Serbian language.\n\nInterview with Novak “Nole” Djokovic\n\nFor the Novak fans and pros who already knew all the facts above and were hoping to learn a little more, you’re in for a treat! We sat down with our beloved Ambassador to learn more about his training, routine, and hobbies. Read on!\n\nAs one of the best athletes of all time, how do you push yourself? How do you constantly beat your limits?\n\nNovak: It starts with the intention. My intention has always been to try and win every tournament I play in and also, to be the best player in the world. There is of course, a lot of expectations and pressure that goes along with that but I think that’s also a driving force and something that has motivated me throughout my career.\n\nFrom young, I knew I was ready to dedicate myself fully to tennis and the life of a professional athlete. In our sport, that involves a lot of time away from home and sometimes, you can’t help but feel lonely. But these are definitely the moments that strengthen your character, defining who you are, and what you’d like to achieve. In those moments, I choose to focus on my goals and tell myself my dreams are achievable.\n\nHow do you deal with negative thoughts/emotions in the face of defeat?\n\nNovak: When your match points are down, or you’re just a few points away from losing the match, you can’t help but feel that you are close to losing and that plays with your mind. People sometimes think that when you’ve been at the top of your game for a long time, you don’t have fear or moments where you doubt yourself anymore and that’s just not true. We absolutely have them and I have them as much as anybody else, really. What helps me cope with these moments better is just the experience, having been in these situations more than most of the other players. That, and my ability to deal with these emotions in the best possible way when they surface.\n\nIt’s not a guaranteed method and it doesn’t always work but in my case, I’m fortunate that most of the times when I’ve had tough moments and been close to defeat, I’ve managed to turn things around through believing in myself and my abilities.\n\nWhat role does hydration play in maintaining your performance? Or rather, how do you incorporate hydration into your daily routine, be it on or off the court?\n\nNovak: Hydration plays an extremely important role. It’s one of the most integral parts of health in general, but even more so as a professional athlete. As an athlete, you have to monitor the amount of liquids you take every day—whether it’s water, electrolytes, minerals, vitamins or antioxidants—and try to balance your diet with that plus training and recovery. It’s really a full-time job, even when you’re off the court.\n\nIf you want to be the best and stay the best in the world, you really have to think about every aspect of your life, your diet and how hydration affects your performance. Needless to say, if you don’t hydrate before a match, you’re setting yourself up for failure because when you walk into the court, you should already feel well hydrated and ready for your match. As a professional athlete, you should never allow yourself to get into situations where you are dehydrated. Of course this can’t be helped sometimes when it’s in extreme heat, or you’re in extreme conditions but hydration is super important to every athlete.\n\nCan you walk us through your post tournament training?\n\nNovak: Post tournament, I’m normally focused on active recovery, using the natural properties of water to relax the joints or muscles that have been over-exerted in high physical activity during the tournament. I normally try to get into water—the sea if I can, or a pool. Massage treatments also help with circulation and the recovery process. For mental recovery, I try to spend time with loved ones and enjoy quality time with them, getting out of the tennis world for a little bit… It’s important to balance things out!\n\nHow do you get back into active preparation for a tournament, or rather switch from post routine to restart tournament preparation?\n\nNovak: In general, you need to hydrate very well during the tour but also after. I try to remind myself and people around me to drink enough electrolytes and of course, the nutrition and diet. It's super important in my kind of holistic approach and well-being.\n\nTurning on the engines again, I like to give myself a gradual start. Before a competition, I’d spend a few days in the gym and outdoors. I really like to be outdoors, doing activities be it jogging, biking… whatever it is. Swimming as well. I like to be connected with nature and I think this gives you strength as well, not just physically and mentally but emotionally too.\n\nFrom there, it’s increasing the intensity step by step, doing some isometric exercises and then working my way into the court where I gradually increase the intensity of sparring. The closer you get to the tournament, the more points you play because you want to test yourself—you’d move around a bit, and get close to that sort-of competitive level you need in order to play your best. For now I’m taking it very easy, trying to find time for nature and giving myself some headspace to get myself back on track through mental preparation.\n\nWhat is your favorite leisure activity? Besides tennis of course?\n\nNovak: I love hiking. I grew up on a mountain here in Serbia and spent a lot of my childhood climbing mountains, hills and just going up and down, spending time in the forest. That’s kind of a natural habitat for me. I love being in nature and if I haven’t been in a few days, I already feel that I’m missing it. I think it’s super important. Obviously everything in life is, it’s relative and very individual plus we are all different. But I think that we need to collectively pay more attention to nature or rather, how we treat nature.\n\nNature is who we are, it’s part of us and we are part of nature. We sometimes underestimate the power of a walk in the park, a swim in the sea, a bike or kayak trip, or whatever it is. Any kind of activity outdoors that exposes yourself to the sunlight, that allows you to be in nature and breathing in the essential nutrients that you need.. This really recalibrates me in a way. It brings me peace, serenity and at the same time, refreshes my energy so I’m ready for the next activity."
