Dealing with Hispanism in both Latin America and the United States, the volume's multidisciplinary essays range from historical studies of the hegemonic status of Castillian language in Spain and America to the analysis of otherness and the uses of memory and oblivion in various nationalist discourses on both sides of the Atlantic. Wide-ranging though they are, these essays are linked by an understanding of Hispanism as a cultural construction that originates with the conquest of America and assumes different intellectual and political meanings in different periods, from the time of national cultural consolidation, to the era of modernization, to the more recent rise of globalization.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMapping Hispanism\n\nMabel Moraña\n\nPart I.

Luis A. Ramos-García\n\nThis collection investigates the politics of cultural pluralism and identity construction within the increasingly outspoken Latino theater community in the United States. The essays reveal the nurturing relationships between people, theater, and culture that have allowed Chicano, Nuyorican/Puerto Rican, Cuban, Cuban-American, and other Latino artists to gain critical and professional respect in recent years. Works by influential writers, such as Rodrigo Duante, Cherrie Moraga, Javier Cardona, John Leguizamo, and José Rivera are analyzed in historical context, along with the trajectories of pioneering theater groups, including Pregones, The Puerto Rican Travelling Group, Teatro Campesino, Intar Theater, La Tea, and Repertorio Español.\n\nIntroduction\n\nU.S.-Latino Theater: Confronting the Issues\n\nLuis A.

An Interdisciplinary Cultural Perspective\n\nEd. Emil Volek\n\nAfter years of marginalization in the international debate on global change, Latin American scholars present their own response to the theories and practices of postmodernity in this collection of essays. The editor of this volume has assembled contributions across a range of interdisciplinary perspectives that illuminate contemporary Latin American culture by high-lighting from within many changes scarcely noticed in Europe and the U.S. Issues discussed in light of these recent changes include the notorious Latin American conflicts with modernity, the vexing problems of cultural identity, strategies of resistance to global trends, and the pervasive misconceptions about Latin American culture perpetuated within the United States and Europe. Together the essays clarify that Latin America is neither what is used to be nor what it is expected to be, but rather a new reality long overlooked by the world beyond.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIs Changing Reality, Changing Paradigm: Who Is Afraid of Postmodernity?\n\nEmil Volek\n\nPart I.

Ofelia Ferrán and Kathleen M. Glenn\n\nThis volume tracks the development of the feminine cultural tradition in Spain and shows how this tradition reshaped and defined Spanish national identity. Focusing on literature and film by Spanish women from the turn of the century to \"Generation X,\" this collection of essays examines how concepts of gender and difference have shaped the individual, collective, and national identities of Spanish women. The contributors also examine mass media productions by women in Spain that significantly modified the meaning and representation of female sexuality, affected the representation of the female body, and prompted new attitudes toward feminism, nationalism, and gender relations.\n\nIntroduction\n\nA World of Difference(s): Women’s Narrative and Film in Twentieth-Century Spain\n\nOfelia Ferrán and Kathleen M.

Eukene Lacarra Lanz\n\nThis collection of essays examines the politics of gender and desire in premodern Iberia. The editor brings together a group of noted specialists in Arabic, as well as Castilian, Catalan, and other Romance languages, to investigate the changes that affected marriage and sexuality over the course of a millennium, from approximately 650 to 1650 A.D. The contributors utilize a variety of literary and philosophical texts, legal documents, and medical treatises to explore a broad range of topics, such as shrew taming, wedding rituals, wet-nursing, cross-dressing, sodomy, and moral pornography. The volume's interdisciplinary approach traces the origins and genealogies of the predominant discourses on these subjects that engaged the minds of medieval and premodern writers, moralist, politicians, and scientists alike.\n\nIntroduction\n\nEukene Lacarra Lanz\n\nPart I.

Teresa Longo\n\nThis collection gathers a diverse group of critical and poetic voices to analyze the politics of packing and marketing Chilean poet Pablo Neruda and Latin American poetry in general in the United States. The ground swell of enthusiasm in America, the contributors argue, has relied upon a vastly oversimplified, romanticized, and depoliticized interpretation of Neruda's celebrated poetry as panacea—offering healing visions of community, hope, and wonder. The essays rediscover the richness to be found in the work of Neruda and his peers as a challenge to their commodification and misrepresentation in the American literary marketplace. This volume refocuses the lens through which we read, translate and write about Neruda-and Latin American culture-in the United States.\n\nIntroduction\n\nPoetry Like Wonder Bread\n\nTeresa Longo\n\nPart I.

Joan Ramon Resina\n\nAlthough Spanish and Portuguese literatures are rich sources of urban knowledge, compared to studies of cities like London, Paris, Vienna, or Rome, critical literary and cultural approaches devoted to modern Iberian cities have been notably scarce. Iberian Cites locates regional patterns of urbanization articulated in or around highly symbolic centers, calling attention to the extraordinary combination of factors, personal and collective, temporal and instantaneous, planned and coincidental, logical and ideological, virtual and representative, that make up the experience of the city. In this work, Joan Ramon Resina and a group of distinguished scholars from an array of disciplines remind readers that Hispania, the ancient geographic matrix of people of Iberia, is still a system of interrelated cultures.\n\nIntroduction\n\nJoan Ramon Resina\n\nTough Beauty: Bilbao as Ruin, Architecture, and Allegory\n\nJoseba Zulaika\n\nSantiago de Compostela or the Obsession with Identity\n\nJavier Gómez-Montero\n\nA Walk about Lisbon\n\nMiguel Tamen\n\nGetting to Salamanca (and Away): One Approach, Nine Vistas, and a Retrospective that Does Not Take Place\n\nHans Ulrich Gumbrecht\n\nMadrid’s Palimpsest: Reading the Capital against the Grain\n\nJoan Ramon Resina\n\nMadrid: From “Años de Hambre” to Years of Desire\n\nMichael Ugarte\n\nA Sad Diagnosis of a Sad Town: Granada and the Dream of the Recumbent Woman\n\nJuan Carlos Rodríguez\n\nModern Spaces: Building Barcelona\n\nBrad Epps\n\nA Walk through Identity in the Gardens of Catalonia\n\nMaria Jesús Buxó i Rey\n\nValencia: Cultural Spaces, Economics, and Territory\n\nRafael L.

Mercedes Durán-Cogan and Antonio Gómez-Moriana\n\nIn contrast to the dominant trends in Latin American Studies—which privilege either the literary, or the so called \"areas studies,\" with its exclusive focus on political and economics issues—the basic assumption of this collective work is that the intricate web of discourse and other societal/symbolic practices in a given society results from, and nourishes, a complex dynamics of forces at play in the marketing of the Social. This dynamics, in its totality, constitutes a complex object of knowledge that this volume examines as a crossroads where historical contexts, economic and socio-political processes, and artistic representations interact.\n\nIntroduction\n\nNational Identities and Sociopolitical Changes in Latin America\n\nAntonio Gómez-Moriana and Mercedes F.
