        "text": "New publication post: Bio-based polymeric films from organic waste. \"Citrus waste has been used as a source of bioplastics for research in different ways. Because the juice industry produces significant amounts of residue each year, it would be advantageous to use the byproducts in the creation of new materials. Researchers have long explored eco-friendly methods to convert citrus and other organic waste into polymers for producing biodegradable films. The goal of this study is to create biofilms from orange waste (OW) and ginger waste (GW) using an ultrafine grinder and study the films’ properties. Since pectin has the ability to gel, and because cellulosic fibers are strong, citrus waste has been studied for its potential to produce biofilms. After being washed, dried, and milled, orange and ginger waste was shaped into films using a casting process. Tensile testing was used to determine the mechanical properties of biofilms, while dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to determine their thermal properties. As the number of grinding cycles increased, the suspension’s viscosity increased from 29 mPa.s to 57 mPa.s for OW and from 217 mPa.s to 376 mPa.s for GW, while the particle size in the suspension significantly decreased. For OW and GW films, the highest tensile strength was 17 MPa and 15 MPa, respectively. The maximum strain obtained among all films was 4.8%. All the tested films were stable up to 150 °C, and maximum degradation occured after 300 °C.\" Thanks all the colleagues who were involved in the work. @MDPIOpenAccess (https://lnkd.in/dQD8da2K)\n\nThe global #bioplastics production will more than triple between 2021 and 2026, from around 2.4 million tons in 2021 to 7.5 million tons in 2026, according to market data compiled by European Bioplastics. The development of #biodegradable, #biobased #polymers and #plastics from #renewable sources such as plants, animals, and microorganisms are gaining engrossing attention nowadays as an essential element to protect the environment from the harmful toxic effects of non-biodegradable synthetic polymers/plastics. 2nd Annual World Biopolymers and Bioplastics forum will bring together more than 150+ industry experts in Amsterdam on Feb. 28-29 to discuss the latest developments, cutting-edge technologies, new challenges and opportunities in #bioplastics and #sustainable #biocomposite. Our @Bart Vanhof will present a case study about ‘Decarbonization Targets Driving Introduction of Bio-attributed Plastics´on Wednesday Feb. 28 at 09:50 AM. Don’t miss this opportunity to know about the topics surrounding the World Bioplastics and Biopolymers event including the benefits, policy, structure, challenges and drive. Grab this opportunity to network and exchange ideas with intellects who specialize in this special sector and industry. https://lnkd.in/d-uHprTT\n\nOur infrastructure: Pilot plant to produce plastics based on lactic acid. The entire plant is used to produce the biodegradable plastic polylactide from the fermentatively obtained raw material lactic acid. The ability to carry out the entire process on a single-digit kg scale is unique in Europe! Furthermore, the individual modules of the plant can be used for various other synthesis processes. The plant is located at the Fraunhofer-Institut für Angewandte Polymerforschung IAP and is operated by our research department \"Circular Polymers\". A detailed description of the plant can be found at 👉https://lnkd.in/djiXX2xV In the coming weeks, we would like to introduce you to the technical equipment of the Fraunhofer CCPE. This will give you an insight into the equipment our scientists use on a daily basis to shape the path to the circular economy! #infrastructure #circulareconomy #fraunhoferccpe #CircularPolymers #Lactide #PLA #biobased\n\n\"Now for something completely different.\" One advantage of doing broad searches of the literature is that sometimes you come across a paper that teaches you about things you never even imagined. For example, who knew that a 1:1:1 ratio of sucrose:fructose:glucose would be a liquid at room temperature (see Figure 1)? I sure didn't. This excellent review by Ling and Hadinoto describes deep eutectic solvent as great solvent in extraction of biological macromolecules. Quoting from the abstract: \"Greater awareness of environmental sustainability has driven many industries to transition from using synthetic organic solvents to greener solvents in their manufacturing. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged as a highly promising category of green solvents with well-demonstrated and wide-ranging applications, including their use as a solvent in extraction of small-molecule bioactive compounds for food and pharmaceutical applications. The use of DES as an extraction solvent of biological macromolecules, on the other hand, has not been as extensively studied. Thereby, the feasibility of employing DES for biomacromolecule extraction has not been well elucidated. To bridge this gap, this review provides an overview of DES with an emphasis on its unique physicochemical properties that make it an attractive green solvent (e.g., non-toxicity, biodegradability, ease of preparation, renewable, tailorable properties). Recent advances in DES extraction of three classes of biomacromolecules—i.e., proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids—were discussed and future research needs were identified. The importance of DES’s properties—particularly its viscosity, polarity, molar ratio of DES components, and water addition—on the DES extraction’s performance were discussed. Not unlike the findings from DES extraction of bioactive small molecules, DES extraction of biomacromolecules was concluded to be generally superior to extraction using synthetic organic solvents.\"\n\nSafety and sustainability are key when it comes to the development of bio-based solutions in the paint and coating sector. As consumers especially in the realm of DIY application, furniture and clear coatings and wall paint are in close contact with the material, these need be risk-free. But how do we secure that bio-based paint and coatings are more sustainable and have positive impact on communities and environments? Learn more about it in our upcoming webinar by the #PERFECOAT project 📅 10 June, 1-2pm, online 😀 Registration: https://lnkd.in/e_TxSQ7Q With experts: Kamal Azrague (SINTEF) – Sustainability Assessment Menthods and LCA Assiya Kenzhegaliyeva (SINTEF Digital) – Social Sustainability Assessment Andy Booth (SINTEF Ocean) – Toxicology and Safety Assessment Kindly funded by the Circular Bio-based Europe Joint Undertaking (CBE JU) JU.

We also contribute to the circular economy by the effective reuse and recycling of raw materials, such as the molecules of high biological and therapeutic value, extracted from tissues of biological origin. The use of in vitro assays supports evironmental #sustainability and #circularity and complies with the European efforts to facilitate the 3R’s (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement of animal experiments). Moreover, the employment of green manufacturing technologies such as #DELOS, which doesn’t need metals or carbon, and such as a microreactor, which can reduce the environmental impact of the harsh down processing conditions (pH, temperature, use of detergents, etc.) contribute to environmental protection and sustainable economy. Finally, we will implement Safety-and-Sustainability-by-Design (#SSbD, led by BNN - BioNanoNet) aspects for the development and processing of these smart materials. NABIHEAL follows the “Do no significant harm principle” as a sustainable project without harmful impact on the environment.\n\n💖#Materials #SpecialIssue #Paper 📝\"Influence of Molecular Weight on the #Enzymatic #Degradation of #PLA Isomer Blends by a #Langmuir System\" Authored by Donghyeok Im, Vishal Gavande, Hak Yong Lee, and Won-Ki Lee. Polylactides (PLAs) and lactide copolymers are biodegradable, compostable, and derived from renewable resources, offering a sustainable alternative to petroleum-based synthetic polymers owing to their advantages of comparable mechanical properties with commodity plastics and biodegradability. Their hydrolytic stability and thermal properties can affect their potential for long-lasting applications. In this study, authors have studied the effect of molecular weight on stereocomplexation. A solution polymerization method was introduced for synthesizing the desired molecular weights of PLLA and PDLA. 🔗 https://lnkd.in/gprViEqE #biodegradable #polymer; stereochemical #polylactides; stereocomplex; #enzymatic degradation; #Langmuir #monolayer (The paper is collected in the following special issue, \"Bio-Based Materials and Their Environmental Applications\" https://lnkd.in/gcDrQ4Vf)\""
