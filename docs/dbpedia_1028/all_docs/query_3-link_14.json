        "text": "''Therese'' was shown as part of the recent New York Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Vincent Canby's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 2. The film opens today at the Lincoln Plaza Cinema, 63d Street and Broadway.\n\n''THERESE,'' Alain Cavalier's cool, unsentimental, astonishingly handsome consideration of the life of St. Therese of Lisieux (1873-1897), is a far cry from ''The Song of Bernadette.'' Here are no heavenly choirs, no visions bathed in celestial light, no skeptics suddenly transformed into believers by miraculous, not otherwise explicable phenomena.\n\nInstead, ''Therese'' is resolutely objective. It examines the religious faith and exaltation of Therese Martin, later to be known as the Little Flower of Jesus, in the pragmatic way with which she herself seems to have accepted the experience of her conversion. As played - radiantly and with a good deal of humor - by Catherine Mouchet, Therese remains a mystery not to be analyzed but to be accepted as a fact of church history.\n\n''Therese'' is one of those rare films whose visual beauty is not ornamental or a substitute for something else. It's been composed by Mr. Cavalier, and photographed by Philippe Rousselot, as if it were a series of tableaux, set against what appears to be a neutral, yellowy-green backdrop, on a stage so shallow that the camera's only choice is to move from side to side and, on occasion, into a close-up. Though ''Therese'' initially looks theatrical, it doesn't look like filmed theater."
