        "text": "MsC 302\n\nManuscript Register\n\nTWENTIETH CENTURY - FOX FILMSCRIPTS\n\nCollection Dates: 1929 -- 1971\n\n200 linear ft.\n\nThis document describes a collection of materials held by the\n\nSpecial Collections Department\n\nUniversity of Iowa Libraries\n\nIowa City, Iowa 52242-1420\n\nPhone: 319-335-5921\n\nFax: 319-335-5900\n\ne-mail: lib-spec@uiowa.edu\n\nPosted to Internet: March 2001\n\nAcquisition Note: This collection was accessioned in 1972, at a time when the New York corporate offices were closing and when corporate storage areas in the New York area were being eliminated. Dr. Richard Dyer MacCann, then Professor of Film in the Division of Television, Radio, and Film, Department of Speech and Dramatic Art at the University of Iowa, persuaded company officials that these materials should be preserved, and worked with Leslie W. Dunlap, Dean of Library Administration, and the company's legal staff to produce an agreement on the conditions under which they could be used.\n\nAccess and Restrictions: The company retained permanent title to the materials while agreeing to place them permanently on deposit with Iowa. Other clauses in the agreement were intended to assure that the scripts were used almost exclusively by University students and faculty, and clause 6 specified \"No copying, duplication or reproduction of the Film Material shall be permitted without our written consent,\" while clause 7 read, \"Access to the \"locked and secured area\" in which the Film Material is located will be only by letter or written permit to the Librarian.\"\n\nToward the end of the year 2000, current officers of the corporation and the Libraries agreed to the following procedures governing access to individual items in the collection:\n\n1. The scripts may be consulted in the Special Collections reading room by members of the University community and others. All readers must complete a Manuscript Reader's Registration Form.\n\n2. To obtain photocopies of or from any script, readers (whether onsite or off) must complete the Libraries' Manuscript Reader's Registration Form and must obtain authorization from the Corporation. The company official currently designated to respond to requests is Tom Kennedy, Vice President for Legal Affairs. (P.O. Box 900, Beverly Hills, CA 90213-0900; phone 310-369-8630; FAX 310-369-4118; email: <tom.kennedy@fox.com>). In general, those making inquiry to him will be required to complete and return to the company a Screenplay Loan Agreement. If the Agreement is accepted by the Corporation and the request then approved, the company will in turn authorize the Libraries to produce a photocopy at the reader's expense. These are the only circumstances under which the making of copies is permitted.\n\nDigital Surrogates: Except where indicated, this document describes but does not reproduce the actual text, images and objects which make up this collection. Materials are available only in the Special Collections Department.\n\nCopyright: Please read The University of Iowa Libraries' statement on \"Property Rights, Copyright Law, and Permissions to Use Unpublished Materials\"\n\nUse of Collections: The University of Iowa Libraries supports access to the materials, published and unpublished, in its collections. Nonetheless, access to some items may be restricted by their fragile condition or by contractual agreement with donors, and it may not be possible at all times to provide appropriate machinery for reading, viewing or accessing non-paper-based materials. Please read our Use of Materials statement. Prior to using collections, all readers are required to complete and submit a registration form.\n\nAbbreviations: For an explanation of the abbreviation and dating conventions used in the finding aids, see Abbreviations.\n\nScope and Contents\n\nThe Twentieth Century-Fox Film Scripts Collection is housed in approximately 200 linear feet of archival boxes. The material is divided into three sections: film scripts, files on the Roxy Theater, and a file on the Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation. Nearly 1,500 titles from the years 1929 --1971 are represented in the Twentieth Century-Fox Film scripts collection. Film materials include motion picture screenplays (both American and foreign) and television scripts, includidng 100 episode scripts of \"Peyton Place\" and 40 episode scripts of \"The Tammy Grimes Show\". The screenplays range from typescript drafts to dialogue and cutting continuity scripts. Many of the continuity scripts, particularly the \"Edited Books,\" are marked in a variety of pencils and inks with notes which suggest they were used in the process of sub-titling prints for overseas distribution. The annotations may prevent clear photocopies being made.\n\nIn the early days of motion picture production, studios owned their own theater chains. Twentieth Century-Fox owned the Roxy Theater of New York, then the largest theater in the world with a seating capacity of 6,200. Files on the Roxy theater include: tax assessments from the 1940's, correspondence and general business agreements. Rounding out the collection is a small section of papers on the Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation. These papers contain: annual reports of 1969 --1970, an insurance manual for the corporation and general business agreements.\n\nTwentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation is an American film producing and distributing corporation formed by the merger of two companies in the early half of the century. In 1915 William Fox began the Fox Film Corporation; and in 1925 he bought controlling interest in the Roxy Theater of New York, N.Y. Fox Film Corporation merged with Darryl F. Zanuck's Twentieth Century Pictures in 1935 to form the present day Twentieth Century Fox Corporation.\n\nInventory\n\nNote: This inventory is being annotated box by box as there is opportunity to do so. See, e.g., Box 240.\n\nThe following abbreviations are used:\n\nSP = screenplay. These are physically the most straight-forward of the scripts. Scene information and dialogue are presented in narrative form. They may be typed, mimeographed, photocopied, or otherwise printed. Nearly all are on 8 1/2 x 11 inch paper.\n\nCS = continuity script. These scripts are on pre-printed sheets with muptiple columns. Dialogue is presented in the left-most column. Other information (e.g., frame or foot number) may be present in the remaining columns. Some of these scripts are heavily annotated, often in two or more colors of pencil and two or more inks. C/A = annotations are present; C/NA = only printed information is present.\n\nCDS = continuity script labeled \"Continuity and Dialogue Taken from the Screen.\" These scripts are generally in a two-column format (camera and scene notes on the left, dialogue on the right) and are mimeographed on 8 1/2 x 11 inch paper. The paper was typically somewhat soft, and it has now mellowed with age, becoming a cream with sometimes a very light brown tint. Mimeograph rarely prints cleanly and sharply. Photocopies of these scripts are generally readable but often dark and not all letters will show clearly.\n\nCDM = continuity script labeled \"Continuity and Dialogue Taken from the Moviola\". Similar to CDS but on preprinted sheets 10x14 inches in size.\n\nEdited Book = a CDS or CDM continuity script which has been very heavily annotated for various purposes. Most are on pre-printed 10x14 inch paper. While they can be photocopied, the print area must be reduced, and the heavy annotation may not be understandable; ink and pencil colors will not show, creating further confusion.\n\np = page. Some scripts are page-numbered, in which case the number on the final page is recorded here. Others were paged by reel. All page counts recorded here should be regarded as approximate as pages were sometimes missed in numbering and our page counts may not always be accurate.\n\nMANUSCRIPT INVENTORY\n\nIn the following inventory, the screenplays are arranged alphabetically. When you click on a box, it will take you to the screenplays in that range, where title, writer, date, and original story are listed, where known.\n\nScreenplays whose title begins with\n\nA Boxes 1 -11\n\nB Boxes 12-41\n\nC Boxes 42-66\n\nD Boxes 66-95\n\nE Boxes 95-101\n\nF Boxes 102-124\n\nG Boxes 124-138\n\nH Boxes 139-159\n\nI Boxes 160-173\n\nJ Boxes 173-182\n\nK Boxes 182-186\n\nL Boxes 186-206\n\nM Boxes 206-236\n\nN Boxes 236-242\n\nO Boxes 242-252\n\nP Boxes 252-270\n\nQ Boxes 271-272\n\nR Boxes 272-287\n\nS Boxes 287-332\n\nT Boxes 332-360\n\nU Boxes 360-363\n\nV Boxes 364-370\n\nW Boxes 370-392\n\nX,Y,Z Boxes 392-397\n\nBox 1\n\nTitle: A-Haunting We Will Go\n\nScreenplay by: Lou Breslow\n\nDate: June 2, 1942\n\nOriginal story by: Lou Breslow and Stanley Rauh\n\nTitle: The Abductors\n\nScreenplay by: Ray Wander\n\nDate: January 15-1957 or May 28, 1957\n\nWritten by: Ray Wander\n\nTitle: Abdulla's Harem\n\nScreenplay by: George St. George, Boris Ingster, and Fathy Ghanem\n\nDate: March 30, 1956\n\nFrom the original story \"My Kingdom For A Woman\" by: Ismet Regeila\n\nTitle: The Abominable Snowman of the Himalayas\n\nScreenplay by: Nigel Kneale\n\nDate: September 9, 1957\n\nBased on the play \"The Creature\" by Nigel Kneale\n\nBox 2\n\nTitle: Accent on Love\n\nScreenplay by: John Larkin\n\nDate: June 18, 1941\n\nOriginal story by: Dalton Trumbo\n\nTitle: Adam and Eve\n\nScreenplay by: Leo McCarey\n\nDate: ?\n\nTitle: Adorable\n\nScreenplay by: Paul Frank and Billie Wilder\n\nDate: May 8, 1933\n\nTitle: The Adventures of Hajji Baba\n\nScreenplay by: Richard Collins\n\nDate: October 19, 1954\n\nSuggested by the novel \"The adventures of Hajji Baba\" by: James Morier\n\nTitle: The Adventures of Sadie\n\nScreenplay by: Noel Langley\n\nDate: May 31, 1955\n\nBox 3\n\nTitle: The Adventures of a Young Man (Ernest Hemingway's Adventures of a Young Man)\n\nScreenplay by: A.E.
