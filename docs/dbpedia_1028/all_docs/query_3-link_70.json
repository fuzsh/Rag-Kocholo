        "text": "Interview by Olivia Bush\n\nWhen did you start your YouTube channel & how many subscribers do you have now?\n\nI Started my YouTube channel five years ago in 2012 & the last time I looked I had a little over 118,000.\n\nWhat editing software do you use?\n\nI used to use imovie, but three years ago I updated to Final Cut Pro.\n\nWhat inspired you to start YouTube?\n\nIt really happened progressively. On the first day of school my mom would always film me and what I was doing and wearing so I was really used to being in front of the camera. One year my mom got me one of those small flip screen video cameras that were really popular. Me and my friends would film videos on that and I would pretend I had a YouTube channel but I never uploaded any of those videos. Then one day when I got home from school I decided to upload one and it really just took off after that.\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about doing YouTube and why?\n\nIt exposes you to different kinds of people. You get to meet new friends and get exposed to companies. You are surrounded with this community of people that you look up to, that will be there to help you. Kind of like a family.\n\nHow do you manage YouTube and college?\n\nI thought it definitely would be harder than high school, but it wasn’t as hard as I thought. In the second semester I scheduled my classes to have Tuesdays and Thursdays off. Those days are dedicated to business and work days. I mostly vlog during the day so I do most of my editing at night.\n\nIs YouTube something that you see yourself doing after college/ for a living?\n\nI do major creative media, so yes, I am hoping YouTube will still be big and I hope that it could possibly expose to big companies and for me to get a job with them.\n\nHow did you get over that nervous feeling of vlogging in public?\n\nIt’s a little weird still and a little uncomfortable. If I’m out with friends I will vlog and not feel awkward because I am with someone. I also live in a college town so when I’m vlogging by myself people know and look at me and they know what I’m doing but it is still a little awkward.\n\nWhat is one thing that YouTube has taught you/ what have you learned from YouTube?\n\nDefinitely not care what everyone thinks and that there will always be haters. My mom would always tell me to delete the negative comments and overtime I have learned not to care what people think and I have realized that I am doing YouTube for myself, not for others.\n\nWhat is your favorite video you have uploaded and why?\n\nMy favorites are definitely travel diaries. These videos are about three minutes maximum and they are montages of your trip. They have so many memories and flow really well with the music and just looks cool.\n\nWhat video have you been most proud of that you have uploaded and why?\n\nMy college week in my life I have been most proud of. This is because it was very different. I wasn’t uploading all week and I have never done that. It was a very interesting experience and rewarding because people really liked that video."
