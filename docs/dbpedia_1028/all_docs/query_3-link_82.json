        "text": "British thesp Richard E. Grant makes a socko debut as writer-director with “Wah-Wah,” a semi-autobiographical dramedy of English colonial life in Swaziland seen through the eyes of a teenage boy. Flavorsome performances by a seasoned cast, held in check by Grant’s traditional but well-crafted, always cinematic direction, make this a classy pickup for upscale auds Stateside, with broader appeal in European territories and those with an affinity for tales set in the British Commonwealth. Big-hearted pic proved a crowd-pleasing opener at the Edinburgh festival Aug. 17.\n\nGrant grew up in South Africa, where he studied drama, and only came to London in 1984, two years before his movie debut in cult classic “Withnail and I.” With “Wah-Wah,” he clearly knows whereof he speaks and, as well as an obvious love for the African landscape and the various types that once peopled it, there’s the same talent for wry observation that marked his film diaries, “With Nails.”\n\nThough the pic is set in a similar milieu as “White Mischief,” with colonials leading a charmed life of boozing and fornication, there’s an appealing lack of bitterness to Grant’s take on a later period. His characters evolve and forgive in a very human way rather than remaining locked into stereotypes.\n\nIn the summer of 1969, during the dying years of British colonial rule, 11-year-old Ralph Compton (Zachary Fox) accidentally sees his mother Lauren (Miranda Richardson) shagging his dad’s best friend. At a snooty cocktail party, Ralph’s dad Harry (Gabriel Byrne), who’s the well-liked minister for education, publicly berates his friend and embarrasses Lauren. Lauren walks out on her family next morning, and Harry hits the bottle.\n\nTo hide the pain and give his son a fresh start, Harry sends Ralph off to boarding school. On his return some two years later, Ralph (now played by Nicholas Hoult) finds his father a changed man, rangier and more relaxed — and married to a Yank, former air hostess Ruby (Emily Watson), whom he’s known for only six weeks.\n\nRalph, now a festering mass of teenage resentment, doesn’t take kindly at first to his brash young stepmom, despite her constant pricking of Brit pomposity. But when she dubs old-fashioned English phrases like “toodle-pip” and “hubbly-jubbly” as “wah-wah,” a secret language that marks her as an outsider, the kid starts to warm to her rebellious, emancipated spirit.\n\nWith the country on the cusp of independence, the ex-pat community decides to stage an amateur performance of “Camelot” as a parting gift to the Swazis. Helmer Grant’s experience as an actor shines through in the ensemble rehearsal scenes, with characters like the stuck-up Lady Hardwick (Celia Imrie, a tad over-ripe) played off against more down-to-earth Brits like Gwen Traherne (Julie Walters, terrific), the abandoned wife of Lauren’s lover.\n\nBy now, Harry is drinking more and more. He alienates Ralph and finally, Ruby, as well as imperiling his health. Then, as independence day approaches, Lauren returns, in an effort to reclaim her family.\n\nPlayed a notch above emotional reality, but never tipping over into melodrama or pure comedy, the script juggles its characters with considerable skill as relationships shift and re-form. Above all, the film has a wonderful sense of ensemble in the portrayal of its inbred community, and the focus stays tight on the people rather than political events. Expectedly, events climax at the performance of “Camelot,” with a graceful coda that’s all the more moving for its simplicity.\n\nIt’s almost invidious to single out individual perfs, though Byrne gives a far more textured, committed one than usual, catching Harry’s quicksilver mood changes; Watson, sporting a convincing Yank accent, brings surprising depth to an initially caricatured role; and Richardson, as Lauren, also manages her switches from devoted mother to acid-tongued bitch with scary ease. Hoult grows into the role of the teenage Ralph, though the physical difference between him and the younger Fox is too great for such a short time away.\n\nAfter the project was turned down by all sources of British public coin, Gallic money completed the package, resulting in a mixed Anglo-French crew whose work blends seamlessly. Widescreen lensing by Pierre Aim catches the amber quality of southern African light, and Isabelle Dedieu’s editing is as tight as a drum; production and costume design by Gary Williamson and Sheena Napier catch the period in a filmy way that matches the performances, and Patrick Doyle’s score supplies warm emotional accompaniment. Period songs (both 1960s and earlier) keep the pot bubbling.\n\nFor the record, the film is the first to be entirely shot in Swaziland."
