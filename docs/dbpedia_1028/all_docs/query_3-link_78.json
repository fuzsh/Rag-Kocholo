That kind of affection was reserved for foreigners”, says director Wanuri Kahiu, and tells a story that has nothing to do with the belief that “good Kenyan girls become good Kenyan wives”. Kena and Ziki long for something more. Their fathers are political rivals in the local elections, but the girls remain close friends, supporting each other to pursue their dreams in a conservative society. When love blossoms between them, things get much more complicated. In their traditional society, their relationship is unacceptable and strictly forbidden by law. They will thus have to choose between happiness and safety. The first Kenyan film to be chosen for Cannes’ official selection."
