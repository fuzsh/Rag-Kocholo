        "text": "Martin Provost (b. 1957) started his career in his native France as a stage and screen actor, and he was a member of the Comédie française. He turned to screenwriting and filmmaking twenty years ago when he made his directorial film debut “Totilla y cinéma” (a.k.a. “Tortilla and Cinema”), but only after “Séraphine” (2008), based on the life of French painter Séraphine de Senlis, played by Yolande Moreau, he got recognized and became one of France’s leading filmmakers who—first and foremost a writer—prefers to script his own work.\n\nHis latest effort as a director-screenwriter was “Sage femme” (2017, a.k.a. “The Midwife”), a character drama starring two titans of French cinema—Catherine Frot as a dedicated midwife working in a maternity clinic. She befriends Catherine Deneuve, a free-spirited and former mistress of her deceased father.\n\nMr. Provost was a jury member at the Festival International du Film Francophone de Namur in Belgium, where this interview was conducted.\n\nMr. Provost, is it a necessity for you that your films are based on your own screenplays?\n\nThat’s interesting because I recently talked to a producer about a new project, based on a screenplay written by somebody else. I can’t tell you much about it at this point, but it’s true, writing has always been terribly important to me—I also wrote for the theater and wrote several novels. I always have the urge to write every day. So my films always begin whenever I start writing the script; that’s when the adventure begins for me. A screenplay is never a finished product, unlike a novel for example. Everybody needs it on the set, and for me, it’s even a helpful tool for editing my films. So I like writing, it inspires me, and my favorite places to write are a train or a plane—small places that are moving. They inspire me a lot.\n\nYou’re an excellent writer for actresses, like Carmen Maura, Yolande Moreau, Emmanuelle Devos, and in your latest film, “Sage femme” [a.k.a. “The Midwife”], you had cast Catherine Deneuve and Catherine Frot. In each of your films, women get magnificent, often powerful roles, on their plate. I’m sure that’s by choice?\n\nYes, I seem to ignore the concept of the traditional leading man [laughs]. Well, after all, this is the 21st century, and all you see are leading men. On any film poster, you can see them, and where are the women? That’s why it’s more difficult for actresses to find strong roles. But there’s also another and more personal reason. I was born in the French region of Bretagne [a.k.a. Brittany]. My mother and my grandmother have always been very strong women, I was always surrounded by women, they raised me—as my father was in the Navy, I didn’t see him the whole time—and they all liked me, so I have been very familiar with women for as long as I can remember. And in Bretagne, the women are in control of their own life; they are really in charge. They may be fishermen’s wives who do the grocery shopping and take the children to school, but they also manage their own lives because they are so powerful. So maybe that explains why I prefer to focus on female characters in my films. But I’m not the first filmmaker to do that; there have been many more, such as Federico Fellini.\n\nWhen watching your films, like your latest feature, “Sage femme,” it’s hard to imagine any other actress playing the characters portrayed by Catherine Deneuve and Catherine Frot.\n\nThat’s because I write those parts for each one of them. That’s how I made my two films with Yolande Moreau: I had met with her and got to know her. If we would never have met, I’m sure I wouldn’t have made those films. The same with “Violette”; the screenplay was written for Emmanuelle Devos. And when I wrote the script of “Sage femme,” I had Catherine Deneuve and Catherine Frot in my mind and between my ears because they were going to play those roles. I could hear them talking while I was writing, I could hear them saying their lines. So I really had to enter into their own world to make sure the dialogue became theirs. When we were shooting “Sage femme,” Catherine Deneuve once told me, ‘This dialogue that you have written, this is totally me. You really took the words right out of my mouth.’ So that’s my working method, and I like that very much.\n\nIs it easy for you to make your films and in the meantime compete with the big-budget blockbusters at the box office?\n\nIt’s never easy to make films, but considering the position I’m in right now, I am very fortunate to make the films I want to do. Before I did “Séraphine” [2008], it was pretty difficult for me, but since then, it has been a lot easier. “Séraphine” was a turning point in my career, so yes, for the past ten years, I have been able to do what I wanted to do. Even though things have changed in the meantime, fortunately a lot of films are still being made in France. But when I think about the filmmakers I grew up with… Yasujirô Ozu for example, when he began in the 1920s and 1930s, he made about three films a year, and so many of them turned out to be masterpieces. And it takes Jean-Claude Carrière only a week to write a screenplay, can you imagine? Now it often takes a year to finish a screenplay. So it has become a whole different ballgame to make a film now. You write a screenplay because you want your financiers to read it, and then it needs to be a piece of literature. But making a film is also a technical process. If you write a technical screenplay—as you’d shoot the film—nobody would be able to read it because such a script would include all the different and various constructions for the entire cast and crew. But when your producers say, ‘Okay, this is the budget I got, now we need to make a few choices or compromises,’ then you have to ask yourself, ‘What kind of film do I want to make? What are the choices I will make?’ And once you’re on the set, or you shoot a scene in the streets of Paris, things might look entirely different from what you had imagined. How do you deal with that? What do you do? So you have to make choices all the time—life is all about making choices.\n\nHow do you work with your actors then? You rehearse a lot?\n\nWe go through the entire script; with Catherine Deneuve and Catherine Frot we only needed to go through it once, and that was enough. Catherine Deneuve has her own working method; she is very free. Don’t let her enter a room the way you want it. Give her enough space and freedom, and it works out perfectly. I learned a lot from her.\n\nFrance is one of the most cinephile countries in the world. Has that ever been something you took into consideration?\n\nAbsolutely, I grew up during the golden era of French cinema, with François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, and so many others. The other day, I saw “Jeune femme” [2016], directed by Léonor Serraille, and I liked it tremendously; it was such a wonderful film. She had won the Golden Camera at the Cannes Film Festival. So I am very proud to be part of this world of filmmaking. On the other hand, and let’s not forget that, there’s also a whole world of cinema beyond the borders of France.\n\nFestival International du Film Francophone de Namur, Namur (Belgium)\n\nOctober 2, 2017\n\n“Sage femme” (a.k.a. “The Midwife,” 2017, trailer)\n\nFILMS\n\nNEA, a.k.a.
