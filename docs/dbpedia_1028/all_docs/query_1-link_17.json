        "text": "Les Peregrines ~ Jeanne Bourin ~ 9/02 ~ Books in Other Languages (French)\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nRoslyn Stempel\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nMmeW\n\nGinny\n\nGinny\n\nbetty gregory\n\nGinny\n\nJustin\n\nRos; I am going to join you and Eloise on this one. Jeanne Bourin writes French so simply that anyone with a little skill can read quite well. I read Les Peregrines some years ago and am more than willing to do it again. She writes what I call french-french ie; she is a French speaking person writing in French. That is quite different than a French translation of a English work. In french- french one finds French constructs which are not quite same as English constructs. However, I found that it does not take long to get used to French-French. I am looking forward to the pleasure, Ros, and I hope the start date is not long after Eloise returns from Spain.\n\nJustin\n\nRos; We are going to find it necessary to do something about accents. Eloise tried to help me with accents a while back but I was unable to follow through successfully.\n\nJustin\n\nGinny: I see you are the guiding light for this work. Sorry, I thought Ros was doing it. I'm with you.\n\nJustin\n\nBetty Gregory; Reading is slow at the beginning but by page four you're knocking off sentences and by page twenty or so paragraphs seem easy and before you know it you're doing several pages in a sitting. Try it. You'll like it. Besides, I know that Eloise will make it all seem tres facile.\n\nGinny\n\nRoslyn Stempel\n\nRoslyn Stempel\n\nJustin\n\nRos; Les Peregrine is a romantic novel dealing with Medieval France and the Crusades. You pegged it. I guess it's not literature but it may be more appealing than Sartre's stuff to a group that has not looked at anything written in French since High School or college. The problem will be one of getting used to reading in french without having to cope, as well, with the existentialist qualities of Sartre.I think, as a group, we can do one or the other but not both. Jeanne Bourin will attract more participants. The nice thing about Bourin is that we have lots of historically interesting periods to chose from. We can live in the 12th century or the 16th century or in the 11th century as is proposed. By the way, what is the number of the list. Is it back with Beowulf's funeral?\n\nJustin\n\nEnglish speakers who would try to reawaken earlier courses in French in order to read Les Peregrine can adopt some tricks that have helped me in the past. Use an index card as a bookmark. Let the index card contain all the forms of the verbs; faire, etre, and avoir. On the back add all the common adverbs you can fit in the space with their translation. Very handy little document. It saves numerous trips to the dictionary. Buy a small edition Collins French English. Some of us use Le Robert Micro and you will too after your vocabulary buillds up. You will also find that an author's vocabulary is quite limited. There are words one prefers so they are used over and over again. You will get used to these and readilly recognize them. You will probably start out reading and translating every word but soon you will read for gist and translate crucial words. Les Peregrine is going to be fun because it deals with a family that accompanies a warrior to Constantinople on one of the Crusades. It was either Louis' or Richard's. I forget. But the trip itself is worthwhile and the land they invade is well described. If you attempt the reading I know you will stay with it and what's more you will have opened a whole new world of French literarure for your self and the French catalogue is very rich.\n\nRoslyn Stempel\n\nMmeW\n\nJustin\n\nMmeW; Yes I have tried with out success. Perhaps, I am not doing it properly. I depress control and hold it while I depress \"'\", then I depress e or a but nothing happens. Control plus ' results in a no print.\n\nRoslyn Stempel\n\njane\n\nMmeW\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nJustin\n\nMme. I have been able to make the character map work but the \"control ' \" has not yet given way to my touch. I will continue to try. It was nice to hear from Eloise, I know she will be much help for everyone when she gets back.\n\nGinny\n\nRoslyn Stempel\n\nI intend to finish the book and find it moderately entertaining but can't pretend to be truly enthusiastic about it partly because of its heavily religious orientation. As you know I am not a Christian.It's possible to see the Crusades as a succession of brutal massacres rather rhan as a holy war, depending on one's point of view. I think some of the historical detail is interesting and want to read more about the period.What do you think will be points worth discussing in the book? Ros\n\nGinny\n\nMmeW\n\njane\n\nMME W: A bookmark or favorite will always take you to the exact \"page\" you bookmarked. That's why that method is not suggested here at SN. If you would click on Subscribe instead, when you come to SN and click Check Subscriptions, you'll be taken to the first new post since you were there last. Another way is to simply come to Books and Literature and come to this discussion manually. Clicking on it from the Main Books page, will bring you to the first new post since you were here last...as long as you're logged in to SN, of course, so the software knows who you are.\n\nGinny\n\nMmeW\n\nHah! I think I've got it. If you remove the /+postnumber at the end of the URL, you can bookmark it and it comes up at the last page. That must have been what I did last time. We shall see where it comes up when things are going fast and furious.\n\njane\n\nGinny\n\nTheron Boyd\n\nMmeW\n\njane\n\njane\n\nMmeW\n\nGinny\n\njane\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nJoan Grimes\n\nJoan Grimes\n\nMmeW\n\nMy Les Ps arrived a few days ago (third time was the charm)! But I'm waiting till August to read, being a bear of very little brain (or short-/long-term memory.\n\njane\n\nMme W: It's great you have it finally. I've not started to look yet...hmmm..guess maybe I should pretty soon.\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nGinny\n\nMmeW\n\nGinny\n\nMmeW\n\nGinny, I have never had to do that before.? How strange. Or maybe I never noticed it before. How do you change the size?\n\njane\n\njane\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nGinny, as I was browsing through 'Les peregrines' one young woman mentions how beautiful 'La Chanson de Roland' was. I thought about you.\n\nGinny\n\nMmeW\n\njane\n\nOh, my, Mme...I'll assume you said something nice above since I can't begin to read it.\n\nGinny\n\nmssuzy\n\nGlad I discovered this site, but where do I find Les Peregrines en francais? My local bookstores don't have it. Ebay? I was in Carcassonne last summer. Obviously the city has been named after Dame Carcas, one of the few French heroines in history. That city has been completely renovated to look as it did in the Middle Ages. You can probably find it on a website in France (wanadoo). There were 9 crusades that I remember, starting in 1095 with the Pope's Council in Clermont-Ferrand - 70 kms north of my hometown - in the middle of France. There were also 2 \"children's\" crusades, which you don't find too much in the history books. I think it was a great political idea, rally against the \"Infidels\" - and around the Roman Catholic Church - and take your feuding elsewhere. The Middle Ages are a fascinating period to me; but, in Carcassonne I deplored the tourism attack, all the plastic swords and helmets and assorted \"souvenirs\" everywhere. Dame Carcas would be astounded! If you want to read La Chanson de Roland in French, good lluck, it's not easy even for the French, we had to read it in school as one of the great medieval classics. Brrrr...!\n\nGinny\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nGinny\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\npatwest\n\njane\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nMmeW\n\nMmeW\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nGinny\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nGinny\n\nJustin\n\nSuggested method: Read in French. Post in English with occasional French inserts. Encourage the fluent people to comment on the postings. Just to get us started. They will have a few laughs at the start. I suggest a page the first week, two pages the second week, and then increase until we are unable to handle the translation. Someone will shout stop.Slow down. By the way, I think , the word for Pilgrim is \"Pelerinage\".Peregrine is the word for traveler. There were lots of them on the roads in 12th century. There were also bandits on the roads. I am looking forward to starting on 9/1.\n\nJustin\n\nIt would be nice if someone like Malryn who is familiar with the secret places on the internet, would provide us with maps as we go along. Les Peregrines is first a journey, then a long visit with distant relatives and finally a battle.\n\nGinny\n\nGinny\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nMmeW\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nGinny\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nMmeW\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\npatwest\n\nA new link to Plot Summaries ~ submitted by Eloise is in the heading.. A nice overview\n\nMmeW\n\nRobby, yes, but much more polite--\"it's all the same to me.\" Je m'en fiche is more I don't give a d***.\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nMmeW - Right\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nGinny\n\nJustin\n\nJustin\n\nLet's see if I can find the accents. Je suis desole. What I did was this: I clicked on Start, Programs, Accessories, system tools,and character map. Then I selected e in the character map and copied the character.Then clicking on edit and paste, I received e where I wanted it to be. Is there a shorter route to accents?\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\npatwest\n\nJustin\n\nOne must not think that because we put a map of the Third Crusade in the heading that Les Peregrine is concerned with that crusade. 1099 is the year of the first crusade. It was instigated by Pope Urban and was carried out by the nobles in conjunction with ordinary citizens. In that sense, it was different from the Second and Third Crusades which were run by Monarchs. In the First Crusade the kings of Europe and the papacy were at odds. The Pope at this time was flexing his muscles against the sovereigns of Europe. Urban wanted to be top dog and as a result, it was the nobility and citizenry who responded to his call for help in opening the way for pilgrims to the shrines of Palestine. It was however, a put up job because pilgrim access was not ended until the crusaders attacked.\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nJustin\n\nIncidently, I think, the crusades continue to contribute to the animosity between Islam and the West.\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nJustin\n\nThe Crusades were seen by the arabs as Frankish Invasions. Amin Maalouf wrote \" The Crusades through Arab Eyes\", a work that helps to shed balanced light on this period. It was Saladin who said, \"Regard the Franj! Behold with what obstinacy they fight for their religion, while we, the Muslims, show no enthusiasm for waging holy war. The tables, today, seem to have turned. Have they not?\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nJustin\n\nJustin\n\nGinny\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nGinny\n\nGinny\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nYes Ginny and the accompanying text explained the Labyrinth's purpose. It was built for people who stayed behind so they could spend time in prayers while they were meandering and imagining that they were among the Crusaders.\n\nMmeW\n\nJustin\n\nMmeW:Merci.\n\nJustin\n\nDesol`e. Is the timing wrong.\n\nJustin\n\nIn the mid to late twelth century, there was a fire in Fulbert's Basilica in Chartres. The entire church was demolished except the west facade with its two towers and the Royal portal and a crypt which housed a tunic of the Virgin Mary. The faithful believe that the Virgin stopped the fire before it reached her crypt which contained some dozen or so survivors of the fire as well as her tunic. It was this church that the parcheminier and his family attended before starting on their dangerous plerinage and not the great cathedral we see to day.\n\nJustin\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nGingerWright\n\nGingerWright\n\nJustin\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nYes Ginny, I'll be here if anyone wants me.\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nGinny, on my keyboard, which might be different from yours, my ^ circumflex is next to the 'p' and if I do shift, I get the ¬ trema like in....Elose\n\nMmeW\n\nGinny, I have no idea what the international keyboard is, but have you tried Cntl+Shift+6, release and type the a? On the Mac it is Cntrl+Shift+i, then a.\n\nJustin\n\n^a, ^a A a aa a What am I not doing right? MmeW\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nGinny\n\nMmeW\n\nMmeW\n\nAlso, just from what I've read, I think the Crusaders consist of the armies of the dukes AND the pilgrims accompanying them. They hope to overwhelm the infidel. Foucher de Chartres says: ...seul notre nombre fait notre force.\n\nMmeW\n\nMmeW\n\nMmeW\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nJustin\n\nJustin\n\nJustin\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nGinny\n\nMmeW\n\nJustin\n\nThe works of Burin can be read as a simple little tales of le Moyen Age or they can be read in depth as we tend to read a book. Burin is an excellent historian and to get full benefit from her tales one must have some knowledge of the history of the Middle Ages. Much of what has happened before the encampment on the beach at Brindisi is referred to in just the first few pages. Par example: In discussing those crusaders of weak resolve Foucher mentions the battle at Rome against l'antipape Guibert. That battle at Rome is part of the investiture struggle which began in earnest in 1075. Gregory Vll, sometimes called Hildebrand, was Pope. He had declared earlier that the Roman Church had never erred, the pope is supreme, and that he alone may depose an emperor. No synod may be called unless he calls it. He may depose, transfer or reinstate bishops. He alone is entitled to the homage of all princes. That's tough stuff for an emperor to swallow and Henry lV of Germany, said \"no way\" and called a synod which in 1076 deposed Gregory Vll. In 1084 Henry entered Rome and had himself crowned by Gregory's replacement and Henry's appointee, Guibert, the antipape. In 1085, Robert Guiscard, a normand baron from southern Italy and friend of Gregory put an army together including saracens and attacked Henry and the antipape. Gregory fled to Salerno leaving the field to Henry and the antipape. I think this is the reference that Foucher de Chartres makes to the antipape Guibert and la lutte fratricide.\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nMmeW\n\nElose, what do you think \"hors la loi\" means insofar as the church is concerned? Does outlawed=excommunicated or what?\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nGinny\n\nRoslyn Stempel\n\nGinny\n\nRoslyn Stempel\n\nMmeW\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nGinny - You should not be having any problems with accents if you have the International Keyboard. Is it only one accent or several that does not work? I have a permanent problem with the accent grave, when I want one on the 'u' as in 'ou est-il'. The accent is on the key, but what comes out is ` and I can't put it over the 'u'. Oh! well!\n\nRoslyn Stempel\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nGinny\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nGinny\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nGinny\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nMmeW\n\nGinny\n\nJustin\n\nEloise: Help us out here. On page 20, I read\" Je me suis renseigne aupres d'un des patrons des nefs huissieres qui nous attendent au port.\" I translate that to mean \" I am directed to one of the captains of the guide ships who awaits us at the door.\"\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nJustin\n\nEloise; Oh well, I got some of it right anyway. Thanks.\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nGinny, no, no. There is something wrong with your International keyboard. It's not you.\n\nJustin\n\nEloise: The next line tells us, \" during the crossing the hatchway formed a closed door with the seams solidly closed and caulked.\" You may recall that during WWll we used small boats with ramps that dropped at the bow and other ships with doors that swung open at the bow. They drew very little water even though the connection was below the water line. I suspect that bailing was necessary during storms on ces nefs. By the way, that was a fine observation about Bourin. I have read several of her works and confirm your observation. She understands the religious influence in her characters and makes them express a medieval mindset.\n\nMmeW\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nGinny\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nJ'essaye de me rattraper.\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nNon, j'essaye de me rattraper.\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nOk, mais il faut un 's'  la deuxime personne du singulier, \"tu essayes\". Gotcha.\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nJe ne parle pas l'Allemand. Allez Stop.\n\nJustin\n\nRobby: Vous nous voulez tutoyer?\n\nMmeW\n\nJustin\n\nI must have misread Eloise's correction of Robby's comment. Robby wrote \"Je essaye de me ratraper\". Eloise wrote \"J'essaye de me ratraper.\" Je was contracted to read J'. Not so?\n\nMmeW\n\nSorry, Justin, Robby first wrote: J'essaie de \"catch up.\" It was that one that I was looking at, and THAT J'essaie was right, not j'essaye (or je essaye).\n\nJustin\n\nIs J'essaye not the first person singular present indicative form of essayer? I know Canadian French is different but can it be off so much that the form of the verb changes from French-French. I wish I were not so rusty.\n\nJustin\n\nGarin's children are well educated. Pere Ascelin who is representative of the Bishop of Chartres, is brother-in-law to Garin. He has taught the children to read and to write and to understand latin. It was a rare thing in the middle ages for people, including the nobility, to read and write latin. That was the language of the church and the skills of a churchman. The monks held in monesteries the available codexes or codices and scrolls. They were the writers, the scribes of the period. A saxon language was spoken as was middle French among the common people.Ginny should be able to tell us about the use of latin at this time- 1097.\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nMmeW - I am so glad you still remember grammar. From now on, I will refrain from teaching French, Ouf! what a relief. Justin grammar is the same in all the francophonie, just like English is in the anglophone countries.\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nRobby, c'est une belle carte de l'Italie merci. Bouche close est plus joli que bouche fermee c'est tout. Il y a aussi bouche cousue.\n\nMmeW\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nJustin\n\nJustin\n\nJustin\n\nRobby; You raise a good question. Where is everyone at the moment? I am reading at the bottom of page 20 where we learn that Pere Ascelin has taught latin to the children of Garin.\n\nJustin\n\nRobby: J'applaudi votre effort pour ecrire en francais et maintenant j'essaye vous accompagner.\n\nMmeW\n\nJustin\n\nMmeW\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nRoslyn Stempel\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nJustin\n\nGinny: Peut etre, la teinte de la croix cousue sur les vetements et on a porte depuis huit mois a tache le peau ces noyes.\n\nGinny\n\nGinny\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nGinny\n\nJustin\n\nGinny: Graver means to impress and to imprint as well as to engrave. Par example; Cette idea se grava dans sa memoire.\n\nJustin\n\nNous voyons sur page vingt-et-un gue des moines itinerant etaient l'hommes de \"mail\" de moyen ages.\n\nMmeW\n\nJe me demande si la croix brodee sur leurs vtements qu'ils portaient depuis huit mois n'avait pas laisse une empreinte, une marque, une trace sur la peau. Les pelerins voulaient que a soit quelquechose de surnaturel, venant de Dieu. Mais vraiment c'etait l'empreinte de la broderie, portee si longtemps. Thus \"gravee\"?etched in a way by being worn so long. Could that happen?\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nJustin\n\nEloise: It is my mutilation of the French language that is confusing you. What I thought I said was that these poor drowned folks had worn their dye stained and embroidered crosses so long ( for eight months) without bathing or changing clothes that the inprint of the cross appeared on their skin. I thought that is what \"graver\" meant.\n\nJustin\n\nEloise: \"L'homme de mail de Moyen Age\" is another imaginative attempt to say in French what is so easy to say in English. Itinerant monks served as mailmen in the Middle Ages.

The time period we are dealing with, 1097, is not in the dark ages,in my judgement. The birth of Abelard in 1079 is, for me, the beginning of the twelth century renaisance. What does the term \"Dark Ages\" mean? It is a time when learning stopped. In the mid-fifth century, the Romans lost to the Germans in the same way the British of a later time period lost to the American colonists at Lexington and Concord- guerilla warfare. From that time on Byzantine influence diminished in Europe. Great central governments were overrun by invaders and for the next five hundred years people were more concerned with absorbing or fighting off the invaders. There was little time for learning so it retreated into the monasteries and there it remained until Abelard and the Scholastics came along. There were exceptions during this period that's why scholars vary in their views. In Senior net we have just finished Beowolf which was retained because it entered a monastery during the \"Dark Ages\".\n\nGinny\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nRoslyn Stempel\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nJustin\n\nJustin\n\nRos: Very nice to have you in here.

The preceding year, Peter The Hermit, and some one from Germany, put together about 12,000 people and a dozen knights and set off for Constantinople. On the way they held a pogrum for Jews in Germany and butchered great numbers of people. When they arrived in Anatolia, Alexius, The Greek King of Constantinople, saw that they were not what he had asked Urban to supply and tried to ship them back. Instead these banded rabble attacked the City of Nicea. Skilled archers came out of the city and annihilated them. This was the advance guard of the first Crusade.\n\nJustin\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nGinny\n\nmssuzy\n\nBonjour a tous. Do we speak English or French on this site? I got the book yesterday and have already devoured 146 pages. That tells you if I like it or not. Le Moyen-Age est l'une de mes epoques preferees, although I both like and detest it. How insensitive and selfish of the Pope - and others - to send all these poor people off on this monstruous equipee! Something like what's happening in reverse with the \"martyrs\" of Islam? One thing that irks me in the book, although it is very well written, is the language J. Bourin uses. I am 100% certain that these people, the peasants, did not speak in this fancy language. They most likely used a local patois, which is never mentioned. I also don't see anywhere mention of the feudal system, which practically enslaved them. I admire all of you who are not native speakers, this book is using a lot of terms which only exist in the dictionary. I spent the day in Constantinople, and am now at the races, got to go see who is winning. Justin, how come you know so much about those infamous Crusades?\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nJustin\n\nJustin\n\nmssuzy\n\nBonjour, you courageous readers of Les Peregrines. Justin, Anseau le Bel had 5 sisters, not 2, this is just something that \"m'a saute aux yeux\". And yes, it's always a lot more difficult to actually speak or write a language, that comes last, after listening and understanding. So you are on the right track. Back to the language: I agree that J. Bourin had to write this novel in French-French, as someone mentioned earlier, but all these Croises did not speak French, not even medieval French. Again, every region, every province, every village within each of the above, spoke its own patois which, believe me, had nothing to do with the official language as we know it. Patois is lost with the new generation, but older people in the villages still speak - I would understand the patois of my grandparents if I heard it again. I grew up bilingual, french and patois. And \"medieval\" French had run-in sentences, no punctuation; plus the vocabulary was very different from what we know now. This explains why all these people had one common language, latin, which is also why the \"quartier latin\" in Paris. The \"educated\" layer of society, namely the clergy, communicated in that language. But enough with that, I'm going back to Constantinople. Au revoir.\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nJustin\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nRoslyn Stempel\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nmssuzy\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nGinny\n\nGinny\n\nmssuzy\n\nBonjour a tous. Today I was no longer in Constantinople, but with the Croises, further down the road. Ginny asks if all the Croises felt that same fervor? How can we know? They were supposed to, that's what we know. I am glad to see that at least one woman in France had enough good sense not to go: Anseau's mother - with 5 small daughters. Can you imagine the mother of 5 babies and toddlers and little people on those roads? Apparently, women did not HAVE to go, as men did. As far as food (provisions), all along the tale Garin's family buys or recives things. The uncle (representing the low clergy) had useful connections all along. The soldiers? Well, they did what every soldier everywhere always did:take, accapparate, steal wherever they were. It was called, to justify it, to live off the land. I saw it first hand in France. Things have not changed that much. These 3 beautiful daughters are probably suposed to represent virtue, purity, innocence, and the attacks against these virtues during particularly unpleasant circumstances of life. I can't help comparing les Croises with young Palestinians or Afghans now. Anyone else does too? Ginny, you asked before when the feudal system came to France, and that bugs me. I don't have a date but will look it up. However, the way I remember from school and reading is that it was a simple evolution: between the end of the Roman Empire around the 5th c. and that of Charlemagne crowned in 802, we had all sorts of tribulations with the Carolingiens and Merovingiens kings (I can never remember which came first). They battled one another a lot and whoever won some battle was given a province, a duche or whatever. They then proceeded to build a chateau to protect that land and its people, or more likely their newly acquired title and position; and so began an interdependence between Lords or seigneurs and the \"little\" people, peasants at the bottom, artisans, military etc. Does that make sense? Croises are calling me, I'll be back later.\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nJustin\n\nRoslyn Stempel\n\nJustin\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nGinny\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nGinny\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nmssuzy\n\nBonjour! Ce livre est tellement passionnant que je n'ai pas pu le poser, j'en suis aux dernieres pages. Et je le redis, je vous admire tous qui continuez a le lire avec un dictionnaire, je ne crois pas que j'aurais cette ardeur. Le vocabulaire est extraordinaire et J. Bourin un auteur etonnant dans les descriptions qu'elle nous donne. C'est pourquoi je ne peux pas m'arreter. Quand j'aurai termine, je recommencerai plus lentement pour gouter et savourer les passages preferes comme on deguste ou savoure un excellent dessert, pour faire durer le plaisir. Question \"salle de bain\" m'amuse beaucoup. Ca m'a rappele les deboires d'une amie, francaise, qui travaillait dans le lobby de l'Ambassade des E.U. a Paris. Des Americains sont entres et lui ont demande \"Where is the bathroom?\" et elle, tres francaise et de surcroit nouvelle, leur a repondu \"We don't have any\". S'ils avaient demande \"les toilettes\", elle aurait compris tout de suite. Quant aux pelerins, ils faisaient sans doute, certainement meme, comme beaucoup de Francais avant les autoroutes: on arrete la voiture. l'homme se tourne et femmes et enfants disparaissent dans le fosse ou derriere un arbuste.

M.Garin mort sur une pelerinage  la Terre Sainte et avant entrant la Terre Sainte. Mose aussi. Le groupe lui accompagnant continua seule vaincre la Terre Sainte. Mose aussi.

Les semblables sont nombreuses.\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nMmeW\n\nGinny, I think the reason that Berthe is so upset about the burial at sea is that church cemetary ground is consecrated ground, so the burial at sea was just like throwing Garin in the trash. Plus there would be no grave to visit.\n\nJustin\n\nMmeW: I concur. In addition to the features you mention there is also the immediate finality, the complete disappearance of the body in it's canvas bag in a matter of seconds and the thought that the fish will eat the remains. I have experienced several multiple burials at sea. They were all quick and efficient. I didn't think much about the burials at sea at the time because we were also puting bodies in large holes dug in the sand by bulldozers just to get them out of the sun and underground in a hurry. When one dies or is killed when young the immediate finality of the thing can be shocking unless one has very many pressing things to do at the same time. It is only later, that one remembers things and is sad about loss. I never envied the burial squad it's job nor would I have liked to be a piper among the sideboys in a burial at sea. When watching, it is then that one remembers and the lonliness begins.\n\nJustin\n\nPre Ascelin demande, apres le mort de M.Garin, \"comptez-vous poursuivre ce plerinage\"? Pourquoi \"comptez\"?

(Darned if I remember where I saw this.) But I think in a way the death of Garin is the inciting incident. Up till then they were proceeding in a regulated way on the crusade and suddenly everything was different for this family. Their response to this \"change in plans\" will \"mettre en relief la famille\" and propel the novel forward to more crises.\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nMmeW\n\nI saw that last night, Elose, but things are back to normal here now (for me).\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nJustin\n\nNous visitons l'opulence de Constantinople dans le livre deux.

In the Eleventh century much painting in fresco served to inform the illiterate about church themes and biblical stories. Manuscript illumination was primarily for missals, for abbey bibles and for psalters which were the religious tools of the wealthy. Sculpture was the primary art form of le Moyen Age.\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nJustin\n\nEloise; Je pense vous avez raison dites il y'a le contraste entre celles croises et ceux de Constantinople.

Roslyn, I don't see theh primary goal of this novel as Jerusalem; to me, it is entertaining the reader, and that, Jeanne Bourin does wonderfully. The language is not easy for non French native speakers, I grant you that, but it is beautifully written, and it kept my attention, I couldn't put it down until the end. Maupassant wrote wonderful stories, and probably easier to read. By the way, has anyone seen Le Misanthrope de Moliere? It's playing in Washington, in English unfortunately, but it's one of the great classics. Has anyone seen the movie \"8 women\" in French?\n\nJustin\n\nJe se trouve jouissant l'ecriture beaucoup.

Ginny, thank you for your comments, I wish we had more time to tlak but everybody was very busy. Anyway, there will be other times... \"nus\" means naked; \"soupirer\" is to sigh, not to whisper, and I feel these people had plenty to sigh about. Could we, westerners, possibly live as they did? No. And what motivated all these pilgrims, as I consider these crusades to be pilgrimages: Faith, Hope for salvation? Duty? Obedience? And I am only thinking of the innocent masses, not the politicians, clergy or warlords, or brigands. By all means, continue till the end, through the family crises, through losses and relationships changes, through pain and joy; that's what makes a good novel so hard to put down. The Crusades are the necessary background, but what makes the novel interesting is the story of people, ordinary people like ourselves placed in extraordinary situations.\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nRoslyn Stempel\n\nRoslyn Stempel\n\nMais si, Mme.Eloise, on sait deja que ce Bohemonde est vraiment \"beau mec\") -- a hunk--et \"matou\" -- a tomcat -- qui aimerait beaucoup gouter un morceau, \"bonne bouche,\" si delicat et charmant que la petite Alais.

C'est le message de Saint Paul dans la Bible. Son message  les Corinthians contient avis  etat de femmes. Couvrez votre le tete. L'Elise latin demande les femmes couvrent les ttes  msse.

She was said to have discovered a relic of the true cross of Christ. Justinian is a fifth century Roman emperor based at Constantinople. His image and that of Theodora appear in a mosaic in a church in Ravenna, Italy which was the capitol of the Roman west.\n\nGingerWright\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nRoslyn Stempel\n\nGingerWright\n\nJustin\n\nRoslyn Stempel\n\nJe veux chercher l'origine des couvertures pour les tetes de femmes. Aux juives orthodoxes les femmes dans le synagogue portant toujours un morceau de fabrique sur la tete, comme le kipah des hommes. On croit que Dieu les a ordonne de couvrir la tete afin de montrer l'humilte. Les femmes catholoques aussi couvrent la tete, mais pas les hommes, sauf le pretre, l'archeveque, etc,\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nJustin\n\nRoz: Oui, je comprend, mais quel est l'origin. Pourquoi? La tete de femme, est il si raide il la doit couvrit ou est il aussi tres jolie et donc une tentation pour les hommes?\n\nJustin\n\nIn the Alexiad translated by Dawes, I find the following description of Bohemond, the Crusader by Anna Comnena.The work is dated in the early twelth century. \"He was a marvel for the eyes to behold, and his reputation was terrifying.A certain charm hung about this man but was partly marred by a general air of the horrible.For in the whole of his body the entire man shewed implacable and savage both both in his size and glance, methinks, and even his laughter sounded to others like snorting.\n\nJustin\n\nEloise: Try Corinthians 2. Look particularly at Chapter 11, verses 4-15. St Paul doesn't think much of women. Marriage, par example, is to be resorted to only to avoid fornication. He prefers that men remain single as he is single.\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nMarilou\n\nJustin\n\nMarilou: Trs bien.

It will have more of the original characteristics than we see to day. The Church will have been damaged by the Saracens confirming in the minds of the Crusaders the evil nature of the Saracens and the reason for them being there in Jerusalem.\n\nJustin\n\nThe laity were often confined behind a choir screen during Mass. In the case of The Holy Sepulchre there was no confining screen and it was not possible to have then attend Mass and yet be outside in the cloister. Had I the opportunity I would have erased the sentence in my first post referring to the cloister. It is not accurate.\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nJustin\n\nBuildings have encroached upon the Church of the Holy Sepulchre to such an extent that all that is visible on the exterior is the entrance of the west transept and the back of the rotunda. The choir and apse which is visible in the picture above is probably from the early 12th century and the rotunda from a much earlier period, perhaps even a Constantinian period. Capitals appear to be duplicated and column bases are simplistic in both parts of the church but the flooring and the marble in the side altar and other stone is clearly much older in the rotunda.\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nRoslyn Stempel\n\nJustin\n\nI am a man with a wife, three daughters, four grandaughters, and a female-spayed cocker. The heavy influence of women in my life has fostered an awareness of women's needs and attitudes which makes me a nontypical male. When my girls were interested in dance, I did several seasons of ballet theatre. When my girls were interested in voice, I did several seasons of opera. I still enjoy opera. If I had had boys it would have been baseball games and hockey. I have read Pamela and Clarissa, Moll Flanders, and Vanity Fair. I see these as women's books. I have also read Jane Austin and Willa Cather. I enjoyed these works perhaps because I am familiar with female motives and responses but also because I was interested in the technical aspects of Richardson's works. I do not enjoy reading trivial material and so do not read the \"romance\" novelists. I rarely watch movies and almost never watch fictional TV. I must come away from a book feeling enriched in some way. I think that's possible with books written by but not necessarily for women.\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nJustin\n\nBerthe La Hardie est malade. Quelq'un doit rester avec elle. Qui?

Ses hommes entr la ville  nuit et la matin prochain le drapeau de l'emperor byzantine parait a l'hampe. Les hommes de France restent dehors les murailles. Ces admettent paisiblement mais une fois a l'interieur, ils tuer tout le monde-les grecs et les turcs. L'armee du sultan et le sultan sont dehors les murailles. Ils abandonne la cite et ils retrait a un autre ville  battre encore. C'etait les grecs qui rende la ville  la basileus. Mde. Bourin dit une histoire different.\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nJustin\n\nMaalouf is an Arab historian who gives us a view of the invasion of the French in the Middle East in the eleventh century that can not be seen from the point of view of a French crusader. The Turks were defenders of lands they had but a few years earlier taken from the Greeks. The population of Nicaea was yet 80% Greek and 20% Seljuk Turkish soldiery. The Turks, that night in Mid June, were off fighting a more traditional enemy.The Sultan was with them. The Greeks back in Nicaea, surrounded by the French, capitulated to the Byzantine Emperor, and put themselves under his protection. They were, in the main, good catholics of the eastern persuasion. The Greeks flew the flag of the Emperor in the morning and expected to be saved from destruction. The Crusaders, camped outside, had no such notion. When they were invited in to the city they managed to destroy the city in the search for booty and also to anilhilate every man woman and child. Many were killed in interesting ways that I won't bother you with.\n\nGingerWright\n\nI am enjoying all of your posts. Thanks\n\nJustin\n\nEloise: I also think we have problem. Have you emailed all those who have participated in the past? They may not be interested in discussing the crusades or if they are, they wish a more scholastic venue. They may not feel they have anything to learn from posting in French. They may find Bourin trivial. I don't know, but if we are to continue, we must have more posters. I don't want the first effort to post in a foreign language to fail by stopping in the middle.

Nature calls, then religion responds. God's creation does it's thing and then man in his religious intuition , often at variance with the intent of God, passes judgement. Jesus never said anything about marriage and divorce. He simply provided the wine to make the revelers friendlier.\n\nJustin\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nJustin\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nJustin\n\nJustin\n\nJustin\n\nYou may find it interesting to know that the very chapter we have been talking about- chapter 24, is the basis for much of the glorious work in glass and stone done at cathedrals such as Amiens, Laon, Noyon, Sens, Soissons etc. in the 12th and 13th centuries. There was great emphasis at that time on the imminent prospect of death. It could come at any time to anyone, noble or serf, so one had better be ready for it. Art iconography of the period very often showed bodies in a state of decay with the admonition \"this could be you in a few days.\" The message was the old boy scout motto- Be prepared.\n\nJustin\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nJustin\n\nI know what \"fait au tour\" means but \" La Tour des Vents\". What does that mean? The turn of the winds, perhaps, a change in direction. Help, Eloise.\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nJustin\n\nMerci vous beaucoup, on et tout, pour un annee du conversation.\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nJustin\n\nEquiping a knight was a costly business. If one measures the cost in cows, 47 were required to arm, cover, and mount a knight upon a charger. A helmet cost six cows, a coat of mail cost 12 cows, a sword cost 7 cows, and a horse cost 12 cows. How about that?\n\nGingerWright\n\nJustin\n\nIn 1054 at the Council of Narbonne, Christians who broke the Peace of God were threatened with excommunication. Further, the Council declared that no Christian may kill another Christian, for there is no doubt that he who kills a Christian spills the blood of Christ. The Truce of God prohibted warfare and killing on Good Friday, Holy Saturday, and Ascension day. As I remember, our little family with Bohemond, left for Anatolia in Easter week. Little did we realize the constraints they were operating under. Further, either Bourin or the knights have chosen to ignore these religious laws. I think, in reality, the Church found it expeditious to ignore these rules in the quest to retrieve the \"Terre Sainte\".\n\nJustin\n\nIn the eleventh century knights were ordained. Knighthood was a sacrament administered by the church. The would be knight purified himself by bathing and fasting. The sword was placed on the altar.It was offered as a defense fo churches, widows and orphans against the scourge of pagans and that it may be just in attack and defense. The new knight was dubbed with the last blow he could receive and not return. He promised to attend Mass everyday and fast frequently. He pledged to use the sword to defend the Holy Church against infidels, to defend the widow and orphan, and not to kill a vanquished or helpless enemy in battle, not to give evil counsel to a lady, and to give aid to a fellow being in distress. This code may be found carved in stone in Chartres Cathedral. I wonder how these guys felt at Nicaea and at Antioch where they killed Greek Christians by the barrel full.\n\nGingerWright\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nGinny\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nGinny\n\nJustin\n\nMaalouf says the Turkish spies were roasted alive. Their screams were to be a warning to the Turks not to send any more spys. Tant pis, I think the spies were Greek catholics who were expected to blend well with the French catholics. The Greeks did that because their familes were held inside the walls as hostage for their return.\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nGinny\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nJustin\n\nEloise: Conditions in the middle east were in a state of flux at the time. The Seljuk Turks were new comers to the area. The Byzantines, most of whom were Greek Catholic and Armenian Catholic, were predominant. The Seljuk Turks took Antioch just three years before the Crusaders appeared. The city at the time of capture belonged to Alexius Comnenus. Thats why he appealed to the Pope for help. The great majority of the population in Antioch both at the time of capture by the Turks and when the French laid seige, were Greek catholics. The Byzantine Emperor was Greek (orthodox) Catholic. When the French laid seige to Antioch there were only a few Turks in town and they were primarily soldiers. When the Emir wanted spies he certainly would not go to Turkish soldiers. Their appearance would be a dead give away. I must check my sources but I am quite sure he chose his spies from among the Greek Catholic inhabitants of Antioch.He could easily manipulate these people by holding the family hostage. When Maalouf says they are Turkish spies, he means they are spies for the Turkish cause, not that the spies are Turks. Comnene's people were among the French so the Antioch Greeks could mix without outward clues to give them away. The spies were quite successful for some time before they were caught.\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nGinny\n\nSharon E\n\nElose, je suis desolee que vous tes malade.

Des mercredi soleil couchant jusqu au lundi suivant soleil levant, l'Eglise avait interdit de se battre. Pourquoi ces chevalliers le refuse de connaitre maintenant sur pelerinage?\n\nGinny\n\nJustin\n\nThe Holy Lance is purported to be the one used by a Roman Centurian at the crucifixion of Christ to put him out of his misery. The wound was probably intended as a coup de gras. As I understand it, this puncture was common in crucufixions. There are many stories about the finding of the Lance in Antioch. Some say it was planted by the finder. Others say that it was just some rusty old spear that was dropped by a Byzantine and has no significance other than that. Others say it is the lance that pierced the side of Jesus and that the finder had a holy vision telling him where to look. Who knows? Having said all that one must also say that the finding of the lance rejuvenated the crusaders into plodding on to Jerusalem.\n\nElose De Pelteau\n\nJustin\n\nIci nous sommes a le bataille pour l'Antioche.
