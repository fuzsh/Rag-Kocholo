“Daudet’s Windmill,” a fetchingly lensed anthology of tales from the fanciful works of 19th-century writer Alphonse Daudet, takes the Classics Illustrated approach to revered literature. Prospects beyond French-speaking territories and classrooms look slim.

Daudet (Jean-Pierre Lorit, looking like a cross between grunge and dandy) scratches the nib of his pen on parchment in extreme close-up, prompting reminiscences and flights of imagination.

At its best, film resembles Pier Paolo Pasolini’s omnibus pix, sans the lascivious edge. Pic’s most lyrical passages are Daudet’s visit to a friend’s elderly grandparents and an extended fantasy about a precocious infant king on his deathbed. Final tale about a priest’s nervous visit to hell is a stagy, kitschy vision of corny devils roasting a man on a spit.

Irene Jacob is a pale, fleeting presence as Daudet’s mother in childhood flashbacks.

Pavel and d.p. Nino Celeste — who worked wonders in 1990’s “The Van Gogh Wake” — obviously relish the opportunity to bring historic tableaux to life. But however lovely the widescreen provincial vistas, too many passages smack of didactic illustration.
