Rafiki

59th TIFF: Greek Premiere

“Rafiki” means friend in Swahili – this is a word commonly used by Kena and Ziki, two young women that want to hide their erotic passion from the conservative Kenyan society, and particularly from their families, who are political rivalries in the local elections. An irresistible pop/feel-good romance about the daze and impulse of the first love – augmented through the magic filters of the colorful, bustling, complex streets of Nairobi – which was banned in its production country, but still fights for a change in the landscape of human rights in East Africa, beyond the boundaries of the cinema hall.
