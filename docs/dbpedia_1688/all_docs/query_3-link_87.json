        "text": "Theo Walcott struck twice to fire Arsenal to a comfortable victory over FC Basel.\n\nWalcott took his tally for the season to five in seven Gunners appearances this season.\n\nWinger Walcott headed in his first on seven minutes after Alexis Sanchez latched onto Santi Cazorla's clever pass and clipped over a cross.\n\nThe same duo linked up to make it 2-0 after 26 minutes. Walcott fired in his second off the post after a lightning quick one-two with Sanchez.\n\nArsenal saw out the game with minimal fuss though created enough chances to have won by a much more comfortable margin.\n\nHere's five things we learned:\n\n1. Wenger demands for a Chelsea repeat\n\nArsene Wenger challenged his side to prove they can produce the level of performance they showed against Chelsea again and they didn't let him down.\n\nThey were totally dominant against Basel and once again bewildered their opponents with some stunning football.\n\nFew sides would be able to live with Arsenal in this form.\n\n2. Chances of finishing top\n\nArsenal tend to give themselves an uphill task in the Champions League.\n\nThey have then ended up scraping through in second, facing one of the big boys in the last-16 and going out.\n\nBut they have given themselves a great chance of topping this group by starting this group campaign well.\n\nVictory over FC Basel made it four points from their first two games, including a draw in arguably their toughest game at PSG, ahead of their double header against Bulgarians Ludogorets.\n\n3. Basel's form and record counts for little against Arsenal\n\nIt might not have seemed it given the limp challenge they put up but beating FC Basel without conceding is not something to be sniffed at.\n\nThis was their first defeat in 12 games this season for the Swiss champions who top their league having won nine out of nine back home.\n\nThey had also only lost one of 10 Champions League encounters against English sides and never failed to score against a Premier League team in this competition â€“ until tonight.\n\n4. Theo is on fire\n\nThere have been a few occasions when it seemed everything had clicked for Theo Walcott, only for it to turn out to be a false dawn.\n\nBut with each game this hot streak in front of goal and run of form looks more and more convincing.\n\nWalcott scored twice to take his tally for this season to five goals in seven appearances for Arsenal this season.\n\nHe spoke with real passion, honesty and determination ahead of FC Basel's visit about the change of attitude that has sparked his brilliant form this season.\n\nThe 27 year-old backed that up with another all-round performance full of attacking menace and excellent defensive work-rate.\n\nIf he can keep it up it will be good news for him, Arsenal and England.\n\n5. Good night for Granit, tough one for Taulant\n\nThis was a night to remember for the Xhaka family with brothers Granit and Taulant going head-to-head again.\n\nBut only one of them will look back on the night fondly because of their performance.\n\nGranit, in for the injured Francis Coquelin, staked his claim for a regular place by helping Arsenal dominate in midfield and win the game, with his efficient passing key to Arsenal's victory.\n\nBut his older brother Taulant was too slow to react to Theo Walcott's run for Arsenal's opener and never looked comfortable up against Alexis Sanchez."
