        "text": "A football team in Switzerland has had to cancel its 'goal of the month' celebration because no goals were scored.\n\nWith four defeats out of four games, the Swiss team Basel posted on their social media to say \"No goals in October = No goal of the month\".\n\nThe team's luck went from bad to worse since the new season started in July - they currently sit at the bottom of the Swiss football league, with just one win in 11 games.\n\nLast year was a different story for the team, who finished fifth in the league to qualify for European competition, and also reached the semi-finals of the Conference League.\n\nHowever this year Basel have been knocked out of the Europa Conference League in the second qualifying round by FC Tobol of Kazakhstan.\n\nThe team have now parted ways with their previous manager Heiko Vogel, and have appointed Fabio Celestini in his place.\n\nThe new manager is aiming to turn their luck around before their next match against SC Kriens in the Swiss Cup on 18 November.\n\nThe team are hoping they'll at least have some goals to choose from for their next 'goal of the month'."
