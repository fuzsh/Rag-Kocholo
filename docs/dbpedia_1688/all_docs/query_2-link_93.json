        "text": "Rookie\n\nOVR: 1\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2009\n\n(PS5) Kobe Era (2002-03) Roster Set/MyNBA Upload Scenario\n\nI have taken the time to create a rough roster set for 2002-03. All player names are included with accurate contracts. All KEY MISSING PLAYERS (ie Sheed, reggie miller, Artest, cwebb, Jamaal Magloire, dale Davis, tayshaun and many more) have been created/uploaded to have proper attributes, tendencies, badges and appearance likeness.\n\nAll other missing players have “rough” attribute adjustments and tendencies (basketball reference and memory for data). The majority of these players will have appropriate skin tones, appropriate hair styles, facial hair, shooting hand but will not have appearance likeness.\n\nI have also tested multiple MyNBA 2002-03 season run throws and set the simulation so teams shoot more threes (they were not shooting enough based on stats in 2002-03 and Field Goal Percentages were out the wahzoo because of the lack of threes).\n\nI have edited Kobe and TMAC to try to prevent them from shooting 62 percent from the field.. they still still shoot very high percentages, but not in the 60s..\n\nThis is a pretty good roster set and it is solid enough to help with immersion until our great community creators complete their roster sets for this era.\n\nI hope this helps some who are complete immersion freaks.\n\nPSN: blessed2be_here\n\nRoster: NBA 2K3 Day 1\n\nMyNBA Upload Scenario: NBA 2K3\n\n__________________\n\n313rd\n\nLast edited by jarviswise; 09-29-2022 at 11:32 PM.\n\nRookie\n\nOVR: 1\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2009\n\nRe: (PS5) Kobe Era (2002-03) Roster Set/MyNBA Upload Scenario\n\nA couple more notes.. Vin Baker by default is 20 years old on the 2k roster. A friend told me this and I updated roster.\n\nOver 40 players added that are real “likeness”,: attributes, tendencies, badges, contracts and more.\n\nOverall total of 142 missing player info, contracts, and overall roster moves (IE: rafer added to the raptors).\n\nI have been using the Draft Class recommendations by @KingKen.. He does a great job of laying out which classes do not have generic players in the way of the real players.\n\nVarajao by default is 1 inch tall in 2k draft classes, so be aware of that.\n\nCheck Ken’s recommendations out here:\n\nhttps://forums.operationsports.com/f...eras-mode.html\n\nThe draft classes used in the MyEra Scenario is from D_Respect but with a few tweaks for my liking.\n\nInjuries have been added to players who missed the entire season: Dalembert, mcdyess, grant hill (played 6 games in real life), Terrell Brandon, and Hakeem retired but I wanted to leave you all the option of using him.\n\nPlayer Tendencies have been made to make stats more similar to 02-03.\n\nThe mynba scenario has changes to simulation: pace of play, fastbreaks, stat distribution, etc. that do a better job mimicking the the team and player stats of time period.\n\nI want to reiterated that it is by no means perfect but I’ve been working on the roster set since launch and have put some time into it.\n\nI hope this helps some out. I’m an immersion freak, so this is good stop gap until we have our great creators do more with the roster set.\n\nIt feels like I’m 9 years old playing Live 03 or 2K3. So all files are named that after 2k3 lol.\n\nPSN: blessed2be_here\n\nRoster: NBA 2K3 Day 1\n\nMyNBA Upload Scenario: NBA 2K3\n\n__________________\n\n313rd\n\nRookie\n\nOVR: 1\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2009\n\nRe: (PS5) Kobe Era (2002-03) Roster Set/MyNBA Upload Scenario\n\nIMMERSION, IMMERSION, IMMERSION! Thats what we are all here for!\n\nAfter doing a couple Chise more run throughs, I found that free agency is out of wack the first and second seasons. Why? The lack of restricted free agency. Baron Davis, Elton Brand, and Rip Hamilton (plus more) all signed with their original team (well not Rip, but you get the idea).\n\nSo to make free agency more realistic I have added rookie extension contracts to the following players: Rip, Elton Brand, Magette, Jason Terry, Baron Davis, Jamal Magloire, Artest, Mo Pete, Steve Francis, Manu, Shawn Marion and Wally Szerb.\n\nBoozer has one additional year added to his contract, he left the Cavs after 2003-04 season.\n\nI have also updated tendencies, some likeness, potential and attributes for the \"non-key\" mission players. So guys like Przbilla, Gadzeurc, Chris Wilcox, Earl Watson, Anthony Carter, Anthony Johnson, Kenny Thomas, Reggie Evans and more have been touched. Tyrone Hill's age has been adjusted as well because just like Vin Baker, 2k had him 10 years younger than they should be.\n\nUpdated to over 50 players added that are real “likeness”,: attributes, tendencies, badges, contracts and more.\n\nOverall total of 142 missing player info, contracts, and overall roster moves (IE: rafer added to the raptors).\n\nAgain, I hope this helps some out. I’m an immersion freak, so this is good stop gap until we have our great creators do more with the roster set.\n\nI will continue to update the roster set as needed, but will not post until/unless I do another major update to the roster set.\n\nPS: I'm a huge Kobe fan and I know 2K made this the Kobe era, but Tim Duncan wins MVP and Finals MVP in 2003. So Tim is the highest rated player in my roster set.\n\nReal players, real contracts, real rookie contract extensions, updates to attributes, tendencies, likeness and potential.\n\nPSN: blessed2be_here\n\nRoster: NBA 2K3 Day 1\n\nMyNBA Upload Scenario: NBA 2K3\n\n2003 Draft Class Used: 2003 Draft NBA 2K3\n\n__________________\n\n313rd"
