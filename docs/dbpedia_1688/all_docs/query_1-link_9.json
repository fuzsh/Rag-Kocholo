Formed in 1893, the club has been Swiss national champions 20 times, Swiss Cup winners 13 times, and Swiss League Cup winners once.\n\nBasel have competed in UEFA competitions every season since 1999–2000. They have qualified for the Group stages of the Champions League more times than any other Swiss club – a total of seven times – and are the only Swiss club to have ever qualified to the Group stages directly. In 2021 they set the new record for a Swiss team with the most successful international group stage campaign by reaching 14 points in their Conference League group.\n\nSince 2001, the club has played its home games at St. Jakob-Park, built on the site of their previous home, St. Jakob Stadium. Their home colours are red and blue, leading to a nickname of \"RotBlau\".\n\nHistory[]\n\nFoundation[]\n\nFC Basel was started by an advertisement placed by Roland Geldner in the 12 November 1893 edition of the Basler national newspaper, requesting that a football team be formed and that anyone who wished to join should meet up the following Wednesday at 8:15 in the restaurant Schuhmachern-Zunft. Eleven men attended the meeting, generally from the academic community, founding Fussball Club Basel on 15 November 1893.\n\nFounder members[]\n\n(Source: the documentation to the club's 50th anniversary)\n\nEmil Abderhalden was first team player in the early days, a famous physiologist and head of the physiological institute at the University of Halle in Germany.\n\nMax Born, nothing is known about his private life.\n\nJosy Ebinger was long-time player in the first team.

A rarely eager club member.\n\nFussball Club Basel 1893 has a long and illustrious history, that spans the period from 1893 to the present day. Having competed at the highest level of football in Switzerland for most of this time, FCB currently play in the Swiss Super League. The club was founded on 15 November 1893. At first the club played their home games in the Landhof stadium. During the mid- 1960's Basel then played their games in St. Jakob Stadium which was demolished in 1998. During the construction of the new stadium, between 1998 and 2001, the Stadion Schützenmatte was the clubs temporary home ground. Since 2001 Basel play home games at St. Jakob-Park, which is currently the largest club stadium in Switzerland.\n\nThe history of FC Basel[]\n\nDue to its size the history of FC Basel has been divided into five sections. For details on individual periods of the club's history, see the following articles:\n\nHistory of FC Basel (1893–1918)\n\nThe first section deals with the foundation, the early years, the forming of the Swiss Football Association (ASF-SFV), the first league championships and the years up to and during the first World War.\n\nHistory of FC Basel (1918–1939)\n\nThe second section is about the period between the two World Wars and the introduction of the Swiss Cup. FCB did not have much of an early footballing success; it took them 40 years to win their first trophy, winning the cup in 1933, as they defeated arch-rivals and reigning cup-holders Grasshopper Club Zürich in the final.\n\nHistory of FC Basel (1939–1965)\n\nThe third section starts with relegation, no promotion, missed promotion, promotion after all, another relegation, another promotion and the second cup title. It then spans the period of Jules Düblin as chairman, the first championship title and the third cup win.\n\nHistory of FC Basel (1965–2000)\n\nUnder the motto rise and fall, the fourth section deals with the era Benthaus, seven domestic league titles, the subsequent decline, relegation, six seasons of second-tier football and the long-awaited promotion.\n\nHistory of FC Basel (2000–present)\n\nThe fifth section deals with the financial backing that had been put into the club at that time, the move to the new stadium St. Jakob-Park, how success returned and how things have progressed to the present day.\n\nSupporters and rivalries[]\n\nFans[]\n\nFC Basel is known for having a big and loyal local following.[citation needed] When polls are conducted about the most passionate club football fans, FC Basel's fans usually make the top 200 if not top 100 in the world, resulting in what is by far the highest average attendance in Switzerland with around 30,000 fans[4] attending every home game and with the new extension being built that number is expected to rise to around 40,000. The fans have also made themselves a name in numerous international matches in recent years. World tennis legend Roger Federer is one of the club's most famous fans.\n\nIn November 2010 their supporters caused the game against FC Luzern to be stopped after they threw hundreds of tennis balls onto the pitch. This was in protest at the kick off times being moved to accommodate a tennis tournament on the TV schedule.[5]\n\nRivalry[]\n\nThe city of Basel and the city of Zürich have a long-standing rivalry. Therefore, FCB's most traditional and fiercest rivals are Grasshopper Club Zürich and FC Zürich. In the past few seasons, the rivalry between FC Zürich and Basel has been fueled by Zürich's narrow league championship wins over Basel. Supporters from both sides have caused trouble in the past years, with the worst incident happening in May 2006. Basel had won the league in 2003–04 and 2004–05 and were set to make it three in a row if they won or drew against Zürich at home on the last day of the 2005–06 season. Zürich took the lead after a late goal from Iulian Filipescu and consequently won the match and the league. After the final whistle, players and fans from both teams started fighting on the pitch and in the stands. This incident has fueled hatred and bitterness between fans from FC Zürich and FC Basel. There is controversy about which rivalry is bigger, the one with Grasshopper or FC Zürich, but it usually depends on the success of these teams.\n\nStadium[]\n\nFC Basel play their home games at the 37,500 capacity St. Jakob-Park.[6]\n\nUEFA have awarded the stadium a 4-star rating, the highest rating that could be given to a stadium of that capacity. St. Jakob-Park was opened in 2001, originally holding a maximum attendance of 33,433. The stadium was expanded with a new stand (sector G) and upgraded to 42,500 due to Switzerland co-hosting UEFA Euro 2008. After Euro 2008, a number of seats were removed, thus giving more space between them, and the capacity was reduced 37,500 seats.[7] The stadium is nicknamed \"Joggeli\" by the fans and has two restaurants, Restaurant UNO and Hattrick's Sports Bar, as well as a shopping centre which opened on 1 November 2001. It also has parking space for 680 cars and has its own train station. St. Jakob-Park hosted six matches during Euro 2008, including the opening game between Switzerland and Czech Republic, and a semi-final between Germany and Turkey. The most interesting feature of the stadium is the translucent outer layer, which can be illuminated in different colours for impressive effects; this effect was copied three years later for Bayern Munich's new stadium, the Allianz Arena.\n\nBefore St. Jakob-Park was built, FC Basel played home games in the Landhof (in the Quarter Kleinbasel) and, following the 1954 FIFA World Cup, in the newly built St. Jakob Stadium which was on the same site as the current stadium. During the construction period of St. Jakob-Park, Basel's home matches were played at the Stadion Schützenmatte.\n\nIn 2016, the UEFA Europa League final was played at St. Jakob-Park.[8]\n\nScript error: No such module \"wide image\".\n\nAffiliated clubs[]\n\nFC Concordia Basel – FC Basel are the parent-club of local side Concordia, who currently play in the 1. Liga Classic.[citation needed] Many of Basel's youth players, such as Patrik Baumann, Beg Ferati, and Simone Grippo, have had loan spells there. Basel have also signed a number players from Concordia, like Louis Crayton and Murat Yakin. Miroslav König, Riccardo Meili, André Muff, and Dominik Ritter are just a few ex-Basel players who have gone on to play for Concordia.\n\nChennai City FC – FC Basel owns 26% of the club.[9]\n\nColours and logo[]\n\nFC Basel's traditional kit is a red and blue shirt. Due to the fact that some of the founders were members of the \"Basler Ruder-Club\", whose colors were red and blue, they adopted those colours for their new club. FC Basel's outfit is completed by blue shorts with gold trim and blue socks with red trim. From this comes the nickname \"RotBlau\" which is Swiss German and German for \"RedBlue\". Their away kit is all white with two stripes down the middle, the left being red and the right being blue. FC Basel's kits were formerly manufactured by Nike, however in the summer of 2012 a new contract was formed with Adidas to produce the kits until 2017. The main sponsor is Novartis, a multinational pharmaceutical company which is based in the city of Basel. On the inside tag of the jerseys is inscribed \"Rot isch unseri Liebi, Blau die ewigi Treui, Basel unseri Stadt.\" This roughly translates to \"Red is our love, blue the eternal loyalty, Basel our city.\"\n\nThe famous \"Blaugrana\" colours of Barcelona are said to have originated from the Rotblau colours of FC Basel. FC Barcelona was founded by former Basel captain Joan Gamper. For the 2008–09 season, Basel changed their shirt to resemble the traditional Barcelona shirt (red and blue vertical stripes). Barcelona changed theirs to one half of the shirt red, the other blue, which happens to resemble the traditional Basel shirt.\n\nBasel's current logo is a shield, the left half red and the right half blue. The shield is outlined with gold and in the centre in gold letters it reads \"FCB\", for \"Football Club Basel\" or \"Fussballclub Basel\". The logo is worn in the centre of the shirt opposed to on the traditional left-hand side. Like the club colours of Basel, the logo has a striking resemblance to that of Barcelona's. There are theories that suggest that the founder of Barcelona, being at one time the captain of Basel, reincorporated the logo of Basel to that of Barcelona. The resemblances seem clear: both logos seem to incorporate the shield design, as do most other clubs. Most notably, however, is the FCB acronyms on both logos and the red-blue colours, outlined in gold. Additionally, the football that lies on the left side of the Basel logo seems to be the exact shape, type and colour as that of the Barcelona logo in the bottom centre. Because of this, many say that Basel was the inspiration in the process of founding Barcelona.\n\nRecords[]\n\nHighest stage reached in Champions League: Round of 16 (2002–03, 2011–12, 2014–15, 2017–18)\n\nHighest stage reached in UEFA Europa League: Semi-finals (2012–13)\n\nHighest stage reached in UEFA Europa Conference League: Semi-finals (2022–23)\n\nBiggest European home win: Basel 7–0 Folgore (24 August 2000, UEFA Cup qualifying round second leg)\n\nBiggest European away win: Fram 0–5 Basel (18 September 1973, European Champion Clubs' Cup first round first leg)\n\nBiggest European home defeat: Basel 0–5 Barcelona (22 October 2008, UEFA Champions League)\n\nBiggest European away defeat: Bayern Munich 7–0 Basel (13 March 2012, UEFA Champions League knockout stage)\n\nMost league appearances: Massimo Ceccaroni (398)\n\nMost league goals: Josef Hügi (244)\n\nRecord number of consecutive home games unbeaten: 59 (February 2003 to May 2006)\n\nRecord number of consecutive unbeaten games: 26 (2011–12)\n\nHighest home game attendance (St. Jakob Stadium): 60,000\n\nHighest home game attendance (St. Jakob-Park): 42,500\n\nMost capped foreign player: Teófilo Cubillas, 81 caps, Peru\n\nMost capped Swiss player: Alexander Frei, 82 caps\n\nIndividual records, league[]\n\nUpdated to league matches played on 22 May 2022.[10]\n\nTop league goalscorers # Nat.

The club FC Basel 1893 functions as a base club independent of the holding company and the AG. FC Basel 1893 AG is responsible for the operational business of the club, e.g. the 1st team, a large part of the youth department and the back office are affiliated there. All decisions that affect the club FC Basel 1893 are made within the AG.\n\nOn 11 May 2021 the FC Basel Holding AG chairman Bernhard Burgener and board member David Degen announced a transfer of ownership rights, after months of massive fan protests. The new situation meant Degen owned 92% of the shares and about 8% is held by four small investors.[11] At the AGM of FC Basel Holding AG on 15 June 2021, Bernhard Burgener, Peter von Büren and Karl Odermatt stood down from the board of directors. A new board of directors stood for election. From that date the board consisted of Reto Baumgartner (president), Dani Büchi (delegate of the board), David Degen (vice-president), Johannes Barth, Marco Gadola, Christian Gross, Sophie Herzog and Andreas Rey. Degen said he will sell a part of the shares within his management team.[12]\n\nOn 18 August the Holding AG announced how the shares had been divided between the shareholders. Degen himself kept 40%, Andreas Rey held 18,41%, his wife Ursula Rey-Krayer also held 18,41%. A group of four other investors, these being Johannes Barth, Marco Gadola, Dani Büchi and Dan Holzmann, together held 15,14%. The other 8,04% of the shares remained by another group of investors, these being Manor AG, J. Safra Sarasin, Novasearch AG, MCH Group AG and Weitnauer Holding AG.[13]\n\nOn 27 December 2021 an extraordinary AGM of the Holding AG was held and it was announced that the Board had reorganised itself. Ursula Rey-Krayer and Dan Holzmann were unanimously elected to the board of directors. At the same time, Sophie Herzog, Christian Gross, Johannes Barth and Reto Baumgartner resigned from the Board and were to focus upon their duties as members of the Board of Directors of FC Basel 1893 AG.\n\nSince that date the new Board of the FC Basel Holding AG consists of the following members: David Degen (president), Dani Büchi (delegate of the board), Marco Gadola, Dan Holzmann, Ursula Rey-Krayer and Andreas Rey (vice-president). With the meeting FC Basel Holding AG had an adjusted composition - the FCB shareholders were represented upon the Board of Directors of FC Basel Holding AG by those with the overall largest proportion.[14]\n\nThe Board of Directors of the FC Basel 1893 AG as it was announced in June 2021: Reto Baumgartner, (president), Johannes Barth. David Degen (vice-president), Carol Etter (delegate of the club), Marco Gadola, Christian Gross, Sophie Herzog and Andreas Rey.\n\nClub management[]\n\nThe club's 127th AGM tookk place in written form, during the week from Saturday 5 June and Friday 11 June. The results were communicated on Monday 14 June. On 13 April 2021 the club announced their proposal for the club management.[15] Club president Reto Baumgartner and the two directors, Dominik Donzé and Benno Kaiser, remained in the board and three new members were elected. These three being Carol Etter (sports lawyer), Edward Turner (financial specialist) and Tobias Adler (marketingspecialist). Their exact roles are to be decided. Carol Etter was elected as delegate of the board, to represent the club at the meetings of the Holding.[16]\n\nPresident Reto Baumgartner (to date) Director Dominik Donzé (to date) Director Benno Kaiser (to date) Director Carol Etter (new) Director Edward Turner (new) Director Tobias Adler (new) Ground (capacity and dimensions) St. Jakob-Park (38,512)[17]\n\n(37,500 for international matches)[18] / 120x80 m)\n\nUpdated to match played 18 November 2020\n\nSource: FCB Official Site\n\nTeam management[]\n\nOn 20 May 2021 the club announced that Patrick Rahmen had signed a new contract that made him head coach of the new FCB first team. Since 6 April he had been interim coach. Assistant coach Ognjen Zaric also prolonged his contract for the new season. Massimo Colomba stayed with the club as Goalkeeper Coach.[19] On 15 June 2021 the club announced, that Michael Silberbauer had been hired on a deal for the 2021–22 season, as the clubs new assistant coach under head coach Rahmen.[20]\n\nThe club announced on 31 December, that the contract with head coach Patrick Rahmen had been extended for a further year until summer 2023. Jointly the club and Rahmen had decided to sign on Boris Smiljanic as new assistant coach. The 32-year-old Spaniard Guillermo Abascal also joined the coaching team and work together with Ognjen Zaric as special coach. It was also announced that Michael Silberbauer had left the club by mutual agreement.[21]\n\nFollowing a number of bad results for the U-21 team, on 30 November the club had announced that with immediate effect FC Basel 1893 and its U-21 coach Marco Schällibaum had separated.[22] On 3 January 2022 FCB announced that they had signed Michel Renggli as new coach for their U-21 team.[23]\n\nOn 21 February, the club announced Patrick Rahmen's termination, due to \"unsatisfactory sportive development of the team and lack of clear perspective\". He is replaced by Guille Abascal in the interim. Furthermore, assistant coach Boris Smiljanic asked to dissolve his contract due to personal reasons. He is replaced by Marco Walker, who had most recently coached FC Sion.[24]\n\nFormer players Alex Frei and Davide Callà were announced as the new coach and assistant coach, respectively, for the upcoming 2022-23 season.[25][26] Both of them had previously played for Basel: Frei between 2009 and 2013 and Callà between 2014 and 2018. Together, the two of them led FC Winterthur to promotion in the 2021-22 Swiss Challenge League.\n\nPosition Staff Head coach TBC Assistant coach Davide Callà Special coach Ognjen Zaric Goalkeeper coach Massimo Colomba Team leader Gustav Nussbaumer Youth Team U-21 coach Michel Renggli Youth Team U-21 co-coach Daniel Stucki Youth Team U-21 co-coach Michaël Bauch\n\nPage Template:Refbegin/styles.css has no content.\n\nSource: FCB Official Site\n\nPlayers[]\n\nCurrent squad[]\n\nAs of 7 September 2023[27]\n\nPage Template:Football squad player/styles.css has no content.

It competes in the Nationalliga A.\n\nSuperleague Formula[]\n\nMain article: FC Basel 1893 (Superleague Formula team)\n\nFC Basel had a team in the Superleague Formula race car series where football teams lent their name to cars. GU-Racing International has operated the car for all seasons and Max Wissel has driven the car in all the races. FC Basel and Wissel won one race, in the 2009 season at Donington Park. The team have scored three other podiums in the series.\n\nYouth system[]\n\nBasel is known throughout Switzerland for having a good youth system.[28][29] It has produced Swiss internationals such as Erni Maissen, Adrian Knup, Alexander Frei, Marco Streller, Philipp, and David Degen. Since Basel moved into the St. Jakob-Park in 2001, they have strengthened their youth academy and many young talents like the Felipe Caicedo, Ivan Rakitić, Zdravko Kuzmanović, Xherdan Shaqiri, Yann Sommer, Eren Derdiyok, and Mohammed Salah have risen through the ranks there. Since 2001, more than 40 successful players have risen through the Basel youth system and joined their first team, including:\n\nFelipe Caicedo\n\nDavid Degen\n\nPhilipp Degen\n\nEren Derdiyok\n\nAlexander Frei\n\nFabian Frei\n\nJosé Gonçalves\n\nGökhan Inler\n\nTimm Klose\n\nBreel Embolo\n\nZdravko Kuzmanović\n\nIvan Rakitić\n\nXherdan Shaqiri\n\nYann Sommer\n\nValentin Stocker\n\nMarco Streller\n\nGranit Xhaka\n\nTaulant Xhaka\n\nHakan Yakin\n\nUnder-19 team[]\n\nThere is no official Basel U-19 team, because a U-19 championship does not exist in Swiss football. The team was quickly put together in the 2011–12 season from the youngest members of the first team, the younger Under-21 and the Under-18 teams who were eligible to play in the 2011–12 NextGen Series. Note: Results and dates can be found here 2011–12 NextGen series.\n\nBecause Basel qualified for the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League, the Under-19 team was again called to life and played in the 2013–14 UEFA Youth League. This time the members of this squad were solely members from the U-21 and U-18 teams, but the team only trained together once a week. Note: Results and dates can be found here 2013–14 UEFA Youth League. A year later Basel qualified for the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League. Therefore, they were eligible to play in the 2014–15 UEFA Youth League and they took the matter a lot more seriously than the year before. Reserve team manager Thomas Häberli was also appointed as U-19 coach. Häberli's U-19 squad was still a mix between the younger U-21 and the older U-18 teams, but the team had training together virtually daily. This resulted with improved results, the team winning four games from their six, but failing to qualify for the knockout phase on tiebreak. Note: Results and dates can be found here 2014–15 UEFA Youth League.\n\nBasel's first team qualified for the Champions League again in 2016–17, so the U-19 team was revived for the 2016–17 UEFA Youth League. Raphaël Wicky was U-19 coach. In the group stage they reached second position and advanced to the play-offs, but lost this against Rosenborg. Note: Results and dates can be found here 2016–17 UEFA Youth League.\n\nArjan Peço is the team coach in the 2017–18 UEFA Youth League. The team will advance to the next round. Note: Results and dates can be found here 2017–18 UEFA Youth League.\n\nOther youth teams[]\n\nThe club also have 12 further youth teams: Under-18, Under-17 (Team Basel/Jura), Under-16, Under-15, Under-14, Under-13 (Footeco), Under-12 (Junioren D9 Promotion), Under-11 (Junioren Ea), Under-10 (Junioren Eb), Under-9 (Junioren F), Under-8 (Junioren F), and Bebbi (Under-7).[30]\n\nEmployees of note[]\n\nFormer players[]\n\nMain article: List of FC Basel players\n\nCoaches[]\n\nSee also: Category:FC Basel managers\n\nNOTE: early history is largely unknown.\n\nPresident[]\n\nSee also: Category:Swiss football chairmen and investors\n\nAt the club's Extraordinary General Assembly on 16 January 2012, the 601 attending members appointed Oeri as honorary president.[32]\n\nSee also[]\n\nHistory of FC Basel\n\nList of FC Basel players\n\nList of FC Basel seasons\n\nFC Basel in European football\n\nFootball in Switzerland\n\nThe Football Club Social Alliance\n\nNotes and references[]\n\nNotes[]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nPage Module:Side box/styles.css has no content.\n\nRotblau.ch Statistics (in German) (archived 1 December 2005)\n\nFC Basel at Soccerway\n\nTemplate:SFL\n\nTemplate:FC Basel Template:Swiss Super League teamlist"
