During his career, Sheringham was regarded as a prolific striker and has also made numerous appearances for his home country. When it comes to club competitions, this EPL highest goal scorer made 755 club appearances and scored 288 club goals.\n\nEven though Sheringham retired in 2008, he still holds a record as the oldest player to have scored in an EPL — he did it when he was nearly 41 years old.\n\nSeason 1993-94\n\n(Source: Telegraph, Transfermarkt)\n\nMost Goals: 34\n\nPlayer: Andy Cole\n\nCountry: England\n\nClub: Newcastle United\n\nMost Assists: 13\n\nPlayer: Andy Cole\n\nClub: Newcastle United\n\nAndy Cole was Newcastle United’s most expensive transfer at the time, and the team paid £1.75 million to sign him. The investment paid off greatly since he led his team to promotion to the Premier League in the 1992-93 season. The following season, Cole scored 34 goals and helped his team qualify for the UEFA Europa League, which is also the record for most goals in the Premier League season (back when teams played 42 games per season).\n\nIn his career, Cole made 509 club appearances and scored 229 goals, most of which took place during his time in Manchester United from 1995 to 2001.\n\nCurrently, Andy Cole works as an attack coach for Southend, alongside Sol Campbell, who manages the team.\n\nSeason 1994-95\n\n(Source: Premier League)\n\nMost Goals: 34\n\nPlayer: Alan Shearer\n\nCountry: England\n\nClub: Blackburn Rovers\n\nMost Assists: 15\n\nPlayer: Matthew Le Tissier\n\nClub: Southampton\n\nAlan Shearer is widely regarded as one of the best strikers of all time.

He played for Chelsea between 2008 and 2012 and scored 38 times in 125 appearances.\n\nWhile he only has one EPL Golden Boot, Anelka was a regular on the list of top scorers whenever he played in the Premier League.\n\nHe played for 13 different clubs and made 508 appearances and scored 157 goals in total.

While Berbatov won only one EPL Golden Boot, he made several appearances on the top 10 top EPL scorers list.\n\nEven though he trained several times with CSKA 1948 and Beroe Stara Zagora, Berbatov announced his retirement in September 2019 after spending a year and a half without a club.\n\nTevez, on the other hand, spent the biggest portion of his career playing for Manchester City. Between 2009 and 2013, Tevez made 113 club appearances and scored 58 goals for the team. Similar to Berbatov, Tevez was often one of the Premier League top scorers, but he also won the Golden Boot just once.\n\nTevez is currently 35 years old and nearing 36, but that doesn’t stop him from playing football.

At the moment, he is ranked sixth on the list of EPL all-time scorers.\n\nHowever, unlike many players on the list, Aguero is still active and currently plays for Manchester City, which he joined in 2011. In other words, Aguero has the potential to climb the list and can potentially overtake Shearer, who holds the record, having scored 260 goals.\n\nSeason 2015-16\n\n(Source: Tottenham Hotspur)\n\nMost Goals: 25\n\nPlayer: Harry Kane\n\nCountry: England\n\nClub: Tottenham Hotspur\n\nMost Assists: 19\n\nPlayer: Mesut Ozil\n\nClub: Arsenal\n\nWhen it comes to EPL top scorers, Harry Kane was 5 goals short from winning the race in the 2014-15 season, having scored 21 goals to Aguero’s 26. However, in 2015-16, Kane scored 25, while Aguero was tied with Jamie Vardy with 24 goals.\n\nEven though he joined Tottenham Hotspur in 2009, he was often on loan to other clubs until Mauricio Pochettino was appointed head coach in 2014. Eventually, Kane started getting more time on the pitch and the rest is history — in 192 appearances for Tottenham, Kane scored 134 goals.\n\nCurrently, Harry Kane is ranked third on Tottenham’s top goal scorers list.\n\nSeason 2016-17\n\n(Source: Premier League)\n\nMost Goals: 29\n\nPlayer: Harry Kane\n\nCountry: England\n\nClub: Tottenham Hotspur\n\nMost Assists: 18\n\nPlayer: Kevin de Bruyne\n\nClub: Manchester City\n\nAfter winning the Golden Boot in the 2015/16 season, Kane continued to impress, and his performance earned him the title of the Premier League highest scorer yet again. He scored 29 goals, while Everton’s Romelu Lukaku managed to score only 25.\n\nTottenham ended up in second place during the 2016-17 season, and Kane was voted the PFA Fans’ Player of the Year. Apart from his success in the EPL, Kane also has an excellent record when it comes to international competitions — he has made 45 appearances and scored 32 goals.\n\nSeason 2017-18\n\n(Source: Premier League)\n\nMost Goals: 32\n\nPlayer: Mohamed Salah\n\nCountry: Egypt\n\nClub: Liverpool\n\nMost Assists: 16\n\nPlayer: Kevin de Bruyne\n\nClub: Manchester City\n\nSalah is one of the few players who have scored 30+ goals in one EPL season. He joined Chelsea in 2014 but barely played any games for the club. After being loaned to Fiorentina and Roma, where he also ended up as a permanent player, Salah was finally transferred to Liverpool for a fee of £36.9 million, which was the club’s record at the time.\n\nShortly after, Salah proved he was worth every penny, winning the Golden Boot in his first season and setting a new record as the player who scored the most goals in the Premier League season with 32 to his name.\n\nSeason 2018-19\n\n(Source: Who Scored, Footy Stats, Transfermarkt)\n\nMost Goals: 22\n\nPlayer: Mohamed Salah\n\nClub: Liverpool\n\nCountry: Egypt\n\nPlayer: Sadio Mane\n\nClub: Liverpool\n\nCountry: Senegal\n\nPlayer: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\n\nClub: Arsenal\n\nCountry: Gabon\n\nMost Assists: 15\n\nPlayer: Eden Hazard\n\nClub: Chelsea\n\nThe 2018-19 season was interesting and we had three English Premier League top scorers yet again.\n\nSalah shared the league’s top scorer position during the 2018-2019 season with his clubmate Sadio Mane, as well as Arsenal’s Aubameyang. The excellent performance of Liverpool strikers helped the team finish the season as EPL’s runners-up and win the UEFA Champions League, in which Salah scored a goal in the second minute of the match from a penalty kick.\n\nMane has been playing for Liverpool ever since 2016, and so far, he has made 107 appearances and scored 54 goals for the team. On an international level, Mane made 69 appearances for Senegal and scored 19 goals. Apart from winning the Golden Boot race in 2018, Mane ended up fourth for the Ballon d’Or reward – right behind Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, and his teammate, Virgil van Dijk in October 2019.\n\nWhen it comes to Aubameyang, he spent most of his career playing for Borussia Dortmund, for which he scored 98 goals in 144 matches. In 2018, he was transferred to Arsenal in a deal worth £56 million, where he plays to this day. So far, he scored 43 goals in 64 games for the Gunners.\n\nSeason 2019-20\n\n(Source: BBC, Premier League)\n\nWhile there’s a long way until the latest EPL season ends, we’re eager to see who’s going to win the next Golden Boot and engrave his name on our Premier League top scorers list.\n\nFor anyone who’s wondering who is the top scorer in the EPL now, the list is led by Jamie Vardy with 22 goals, and he is followed by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang with 19 goals. Danny Ings from Southampton is third with 18 goals. Last year’s Golden Boot winner, Mohamed Salah has scored 17 goals and is tied with his teammate Sadio Mane who’s scored the same amount.\n\nSources:"
