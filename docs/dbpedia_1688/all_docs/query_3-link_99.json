        "text": "Few Goals Expected\n\nProviding that Under 2.5 Goals are scored, then we will win with our betting prediction. Take the 2.02 that Grasshoppers and Basel will play out a low-scoring clash.\n\nMatch Preview & H2H\n\nGrasshoppers´s last Swiss Super League clash was against Luzern and the game finished in a 2-2 draw. The match was played at Letzigrund Stadion, with Nikolas Muci and Pascal Schuerpf scoring goals.\n\nBasel played Lugano in their last match and this was a home game at St. Jakob Park. The scoreline was a 2-1 loss in this Swiss Super League encounter, with Leo Leroy scoring for Basel.\n\nWhen Grasshoppers and Basel last played, it was a 1-0 win for Basel at Letzigrund Stadion.\n\nIn the past 10 encounters, we have seen Grasshoppers win five times and Basel land four victories. The other clash between the teams was a draw.\n\nGrasshoppers – Last 10 League Games\n\n2 wins, 5 losses and 3 draws, averaging 1.1 goals from 9.3 attempts and 3.3 shots on goal. Grasshoppers have had 47.2% possession, 358.5 passes and 5.0 corners per match. On average, the opposition have scored 1.3 goals from 12.9 attempts and 5.0 shots on goal, while earning 4.0 corners.\n\nPascal Schuerpf and Giotto Morandi lead the way with 3 goals, while Nikolas Muci has 1. Awer Mabil and Giotto Morandi are tied for the most assists on 2.\n\nBasel – Last 10 League Games\n\nBasel have won 4, lost 2 and drawn 4, with an average of 1.2 goals from 5.1 shots on goal and 13.6 attempts. They have averaged 49.3% possession, 405.9 passes, 5.0 corners taken and 5.1 corners against, while conceding 0.8 goals from 3.0 shots on goal and 10.5 attempts.\n\nThierno Barry got 6 goals, Anton Kade notched 2, while Leo Leroy and two other players scored 1. Albian Ajeti and Dominik Schmid have clocked up 2 assists each in the last 10 games.\n\nConfirmed Lineups\n\nGrasshoppers (confirmed lineup): Justin Hammel, Maksim Paskotsi, Kristers Tobers, Saulo Decarli, Theo Ndicka Matam, Amir Abrashi, Ayumu Seko, Awer Mabil, Giotto Morandi, Pascal Schuerpf, Nikolas Muci.\n\nBasel (confirmed lineup): Marwin Hitz, Adrian Leon Barisic, Jonas Adjei Adjetey, Finn van Breemen, Anton Kade, Leo Leroy, Leon Avdullahu, Dominik Schmid, Thierno Barry, Albian Ajeti, Benie Traore.\n\nExpert Analysis\n\nThe formbook is always a good place to start ahead of making football predictions. Team news is also an important port of call, while the stats we present always tell an interesting story.\n\nKey Grasshoppers vs Basel stats:\n\nIn 14 of the last 20 Grasshoppers matches, there have been Under 2.5 Goals\n\nGrasshoppers failed to score in 11 of their last 20 matches\n\nBack Under 2.5 Goals at 2.02 for this Super League game. The reason for our betting tip is that we’re expecting a low-scoring game including two goals or less.\n\nThere are similar bets available and that includes Under 1.5 Goals where you can get bigger odds but can’t allow two or more goals for your bet to win.\n\nPublished 04:22, 01 August 2024"
