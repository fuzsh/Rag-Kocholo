        "text": "Lucas Perez finished off an astounding Arsenal passing move to score the second goal of his emphatic hat-trick against FC Basel.\n\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger rang the changes for their final Champions League group match and was rewarded with the perfect response as his team romped to a 4-1 victory away from home.\n\nPerez, on his first European start for the Gunners, benefited from three assists via left-back Kieran Gibbs to complete a hat-trick as Arsenal’s squad depth continues to impress.\n\nThe result, coupled with the shock 2-2 draw in Paris between PSG and lowly Bulgarian side Ludogorets, means Arsenal have finished as group winners for the first time since 2011/12.\n\nThe perfect night for the north London club was capped off with the confirmation hat Perez’s second goal saw the Gunners reach peak levels of Wengerball:\n\nWenger, who was delighted to top Group A, heaped praise on Perez and his ability to ‘smell the goal’ after his treble.\n\n‘I think Perez took advantage of the fact we created good chances – he is a goalscorer you know, he has shown tonight he has a good smell for the goal,’ Wenger said after the match.\n\n‘I thought Ludogorets were a good side – they made a great result that helps us top the group, which was what we wanted,’ the Frenchman said upon hearing the news he had won Group A.\n\n‘We did the job in a convincing way, we were mobile and overall had a committed performance,’ he added."
