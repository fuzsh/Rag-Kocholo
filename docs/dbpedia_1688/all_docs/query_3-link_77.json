        "text": "Arsenal welcome FC Basel to Emirates Stadium tonight as they return to Champions League action following a steady start to the new Premier League season.\n\nWenger's men beat Chelsea 3-0 at home on Saturday and the Frenchman has called on his team to show consistency from 'competition to competition' as they look to build on an away point at the Parc des Princes in their European opener earlier this month.\n\nWenger will be without Francis Coquelin, who sustained a knee injury in the top flight victory over the Blues, while Olivier Giroud is suspended following his red card against PSG in the previous round of fixtures.\n\nWith the FA setting their sights on the Frenchman as they search for Sam Allardyce's successor, how will the Gunners fare tonight?\n\nArsene Wenger: \"The relentless team energy pleased me most [against Chelsea]; the fact that we kept going no matter what the result was, and that we respected what we planned together. That’s a sign of maturity. Our game is about style and steel, and we combined both.\n\n\"Every time it’s a new challenge but I believe the humility is to accept that you have to start from scratch again and show another performance. It might be a different game but we have to find the resources to win the game again.\""
