It was more of a surprise for me three or four years ago when they were not at that stage of the Champions League.\n\nAt the moment, I think Celtic are really up there at the top of football in Europe. They are on a par with the Italian, English and Spanish clubs.\n\nI definitely think they can go into the quarter-finals this time because they made it to the last 16 last year and only lost to AC Milan.\n\nGetting through the group for the first time is always difficult, but it helps in future when you have the knowledge you can do that.\n\nI have known Celtic for a long time and they are one of the major teams in Britain and Europe. I came up against them in my career and have always admired them.\n\nTrapattoni believes that summer signing Massimo Donati will make a big contribution to Strachans quest for glory at home and abroad.\n\nHe coached the Italian national side between 2000 and 2004 and had Donati in his youth ranks at the time of his 10million move from Atalanta to AC Milan in 2001.\n\nTrapattoni said: Massimo was one of the best players we had at the younger levels of the national team. Ive known him for eight years or so and he was always very important.\n\nMassimo has a good personality, hes still young enough and I think he can do very well at Celtic. He plays the ball confidently and I am sure he will have no fear of the game in Scotland.\n\nDonatis switch to the San Siro ended in frustration as he spent most of his time there farmed out on loan to the likes of Atalanta and Messina.\n\nTrapattoni said: Why did his move to Milan not work out as hoped? He was not a classic big star. In football, you have the fantasy players, the creative ones, but Massimo is the kind of player I was in my day.\n\n\"He is solid, like concrete, and thats the kind of thing that is needed in Scottish football. Scottish football is not South American football. In Europe, our football is different."
