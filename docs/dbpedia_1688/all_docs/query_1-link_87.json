        "text": "XAVI\n\n-Started in the ranks of Barcelona, and quickly integrated the first team. The fact that he was able to integrate a team of that stature is a strong indicator of his ability early on - otherwise, he would have been shipped off elsewhere.\n\nA starter is defined as a player who is in the starting 11 more than 50% of the time. An undisputed starter is a player that is not frequently on the bench or benched for tactical reasons.\n\nHere is what we find:\n\nXavi participated in a total of 16 Champions League Campaigns.\n\nWith the exception of 06/07, he is generally incorporated as a starter from 01/02 (21 years old) to 13/14 (33 years old) inclusive.\n\nOf these, he is only an undisputed /established contributor from 07/08 (27 years old) to 13/14 (33 years old).\n\nInternationally, we see a similar pattern: Benched for Euro 04 with no minutes, starter in 06 WC but subbed out in Ro16 early, Euro 08 - subbed out early in difficult group match + rested 3rd, subbed out early in quarters + semis. He is an undisputed starter for WC 10 (30 years old) and Euro 12 (32 years old) only\n\nSo, he is a marquee player - at most - from age 27 to 33, if we go by combined international + club criteria - he is an undisputed midfielder from (Euro 08 as part of 07/08 season) 08/09 to 12/13 - 5 seasons.\n\nSince he became a starter in club (12 years), he is an undisputed starter for 6 years in club (50%), and 3 to 4 years internationally (33%).\n\nIf we examine his G+A contribution in CL:\n\n9 G+A that affected the result of an individual match in knockouts (defined as match-determining - ie. team could be winning 2-0 on aggregate, but scores opening 1-0 in return leg - it is credited as match-determining).\n\nOf these, 1 goal (pen vs AC milan RO16), and 4 Assists - Total 5 G+A contributed to progression/win of the team.\n\nIn his entire CL career, Xavi ONLY made direct contributions to 4 match-ups / matches that played a role in the progression of the team in knockouts. These are: assist (2-2) in 6-3 destruction of Arsenal in 9/10 Quarters, assist vs Man Utd in 3-1 win in final, 2 assists vs AC Milan in 12/13 RO16 pen vs PSG.\n\nIf we are to look at the international stats, it will be even more damning.\n\nIn the 08/09 and 10/11 winning campaigns (the only campaigns he won), the only direct contribution that affects progression of his team is his assist vs Man Utd in the final (3-1 final score).\n\nIn the years where he is a starter (excluding when he is very young so as to not be unfair and excluding 14/15),\n\nhe only has 6 campaigns where he has any sort of direct goal contribution in knockouts (50%).\n\nIf we examine matches where he is subbed out / subbed / benched on in knockouts\n\n01/02: Quarters - Panaithakos subbed on at 54' while score 0-0. Team loses 1-0.\n\n02/03: Quarters - Juventus - subbed at 74' while team losing 0-1. Team equalizes after.\n\n05/06: First tournament he cannot participate in knockouts (due to injury) since starter. Team wins Champions League.\n\nWorld Cup 2006: 3-1 Loss to France in Rof16, subbed out at 72nd minute.\n\n06/07: Subbed at 65' in Ro16 vs Liverpool at 1-1, Liverpool scores 2-1. Eliminated in R016.\n\n07/08: Ro16 vs. Celtic: comes on as sub at 66' at 2-2, team wins 3-2.\n\nEuro 2008: Quarters - Plays 60 minutes, then subbed out. Team beats Italy on Pens.\n\nSemis - Opening goal in 3-0 win vs Russia. Subbed out at 69th. Goals 2 and 3 for Spain come AFTER he is subbed out.\n\n08/09: Plays all tournament. Team wins.\n\n09/10: Not in squad or rested for Ro16 return match (H) vs Stuttgard which Barca wins 4-0 (Away which he played was 1-1).\n\n10/11: Plays all tournament. Team wins.\n\n11/12: Assists 1-0 in return 7-1 win vs. Leverkusen (leading 3-1 in first leg), subbed at 53', team scores 4 more goals without him.\n\n12/13: Subbed out at 5-0 aggregate vs Bayern in humiliating loss in Semifinal.\n\n13/14: Plays all tournament. Team eliminated in Quarters.\n\nWorld Cup 2014: Plays opening 90 minutes in 5-1 loss to Netherlands. Benched for rest of competition.\n\n14/15: Starts 2 group games, benched for rest of tournament with a few mostly late sub-appearances (no G+A).

Incidentally, Xavi has a large volume of actions that cluster in blowout matches.\n\nSo, the question I am looking to answer is: what kind of IMPACT does Xavi have on results via direct goal contributions?\n\nWith respect to nomenclature:\n\nMatch-determining and decisive contribution and major contribution were used interchangeably - ensures win/draw or any goal/assist in a loss in that particular match. If a player scores in a 2-1 loss, it is defined as match-determining / decisive / major contribution.\n\nResult-determining and progression-determining were used interchangeably. We are analyzing G+A across the temporality of two legs. A 1-0 in a return match where the aggregate is 3-0 is match-determining, but it did nothing with respect to the overall outcome of the tie. I believe looking at match-determining stats still provides some value, since a match does remain an individual entity.\n\nTo answer your question, regarding substitutions:\n\nAs you can see from the data,\n\nwith the exception of these two matches (this is counting from 01/02 when he had matured into a starter):\n\nEuro 2008 Semifinal - Opening goal in 3-0 win vs Russia. Subbed out at 69th. Goals 2 and 3 for Spain come AFTER he is subbed out.\n\nand\n\nCL Ro16 Return 11/12: Assists 1-0 in return 7-1 win vs. Leverkusen (leading 3-1 in first leg), subbed at 53', team scores 4 more goals without him.\n\nThese two substitutions are tactical, but for the purposes of protecting a lead and/or resting the player.\n\nThe other substitutions all cluster in early moments in the game, are of a tactical nature, and represent situations where Xavi's team is chasing a goal.\n\nThe one exception may be his substitution vs France in 2006 with a nominal DM (I do not know much about this player Marcos Senna), which may have been an attempt to better secure the midfield battle or survive into extra-time.\n\nTo cite some examples, in Euro 2008 vs Italy, he is substituted very early for Fabregas. That is an attempt to introduce a midfielder with a more direct profile.\n\nI think the single most damning piece of information remains his substitution vs Bayern in 12/13 return loss (7-0 agg) and when he is dropped from the Spain squad in the 5-1 Loss to Netherlands in the opening match of 2014 WC. These are two instances where catastrophic losses were directly attributed to the nature of the Xavi-led midfield. The year after, Barca is eliminated in quarters. When Xavi is finally put to the side, Barca goes on to win the CL the next campaign. The truth is this represents a second tactical revolution that occurred - club football caught up to Barca's tactical advances, and Xavi quickly became obsolete. There was no drop-off in his performances, he just could no longer be part of a team vying for the upper echelons of football. Football had become more direct, and top teams learned to attack the spaces and work out of Barca's press.\n\nThanks. This clarifies where you’re coming from and how you’re using certain terms.\n\nYeah, that’s why I believe that we need to do an in-depth analysis to identify substitutions which clearly showcase a clear lack of faith in the abilities of Xavi and other midfielders to change the result, leading them to be taken off. I believe it would be a very interesting and eye-opening method to get more insights about these players’ importance to their teams.\n\nGreat insights here, especially regarding how tactical changes impacted Xavi’s importance to his teams. I think it says a lot about Xavi’s lack of flexibility.\n\nZIDANE (data below)\n\nIn Champions League:\n\nZidane played 9 seasons of Champions League football, reaching 5 semifinals.\n\nHe started 31 knockout matches out of a total of 31 available matches.\n\nHe virtually played every minute of the knockout matches with 2 exceptions:\n\n(1) Substitution at 45' vs Barca 01/02 2nd leg due to injury\n\n(2) Substitution at 74' vs Juve 04/05 2nd leg, likely tactical (not reported) while leading 1-0 on agg. Team loses 2-1 and is eliminated shortly after.\n\nIncluding group stages, there is only one possible tactical substitution (could have been to rest):\n\n78' min vs Roma at 0-1, likely tactical sub for Solari (chasing goal)\n\nThere are 0 instances of his team performing better without him on the pitch.\n\nWith Juventus, he has 10 G+A in 14 knockout matches (0.71 G+A / game)\n\nWith Real Madrid, he has 10 G+A in 17 knockout matches (0.59 G+A/ game). Prior to the 04/05 and 05/06 successive Ro16 eliminations, it is a 0.77 G+A/ game (10 in 13) rate, comparable to his historical rate at Juve.\n\nThis is a rate that would be worth comparing to the best attackers that have ever played in this competition.\n\n(For Comparison, Xavi has a G+A/game rate across the whole competition, including groups, of 0.28)\n\nOf these goals and assists,\n\nwith Juventus, 6 G+A are \"match-determining\"\n\nwith Real Madrid, 9 G+A are \"match-determining\"\n\nTotal 15 G+A match-determining across 31 knockout matches\n\nOf these,\n\n7 G+A progressed the team through the knockouts (or in the instance of 01/02, won the final)\n\nTo better put this into perspective:\n\nZidane participated in 17 knockout \"ties\" - including 3 finals.\n\n***This is based on the strictest definition of a G+A contribution - ie. G+A that did not numerically affect the final outcome, are excluded (\"ie no \"safetypad\" or \"statpad\" G+A)\n\nOf these, his team won / progressed in 10 ties:\n\nZidane directly contributed to progressing / winning 5 ties (50%):\n\n97/98 Quarters vs Dynamo Kiev\n\n98/99 Quarters vs Olympiacos\n\n01/02 Semis vs Barca\n\n01/02 Final vs Leverkusen\n\n02/03 Quarters vs Man Utd\n\nExamining the ties where his team did not progress :\n\n-No G/A in 2 finals his team lost.\n\n-Excluding 04/05 where his team was eliminated without him,\n\nZidane scored and assisted in 4 of the 5 ties where his team was eliminated in knockouts.\n\n@Estel @carlito86\n\nDATA\n\n96/97\n\nStarts 10/11 (not in squad for 1 group game)\n\nQuarters 2nd leg vs Rosenborg - subbed 83' at 1-0.\n\nSemis 2nd leg vs Ajax - subbed 82' at 4-1 (6-2 agg)\n\nGoal 1-0 in 2-0 win vs. Rosenborg (2-1 agg, leading via away goal at 1-1) in Quarters.
