        "text": "Fiorentina’s Antonin Barak struck deep into stoppage time at the end of extra time to take his side into the Europa Conference League final with a 3-1 win over FC Basel in the second leg of the semifinal on Thursday that secured a 4-3 aggregate victory.\n\nThe Italians made its first European final in 33 years and will face West Ham United in the showpiece match in Prague on June 7 after the Londoners beat AZ Alkmaar in their semifinal.\n\nFiorentina became the first club to reach the finals of four UEFA competitions, having played in the European Cup, UEFA Cup, and Cup Winners’ Cup finals. The Serie A team last reached a European final when they lost to Juventus in the UEFA Cup competition in 1990.\n\n“Tonight we played like a mature team,” Fiore manager Vincenzo Italiano told DAZN. “It’s my first season in Europe and reaching the final is a great satisfaction. This path to the final will always remain with us but now we have a mission to complete.”\n\nFiorentina was chasing the game after Basel won the first leg 2-1, but it had trouble finding space as the Swiss employed a deep defensive strategy and sought to counter-attack.\n\nHowever, as the half wore on Basel’s defence began to falter, despite enthusiastic support from the St Jakob-Park crowd, and the visitors looked more likely to score.\n\nFiorentina took the lead in the 35th minute when a corner was met by the unmarked Nicolas Gonzalez, who headed home to level the aggregate score at 2-2.\n\nJust before the break goalkeeper Marwin Hitz came to Basel’s rescue with a remarkable one-handed save from Giacomo Bonaventura’s effort to prevent another header from finding the net.\n\nZeki Amdouni then scored for Basel 10 minutes into the second half before Gonzalez responded in the 72nd with a well-placed shot, sending the match into extra time.\n\nHitz made another crucial save in the opening minutes of extra time when he blocked substitute Luka Jovic’s header with another stunning one-handed reflex save.\n\nThe match was stopped for eight minutes near the end of extra time so medical assistance could be given in the stands.\n\nThen nine minutes into stoppage time in the extra period Barak collected a loose ball inside the box and slotted it home from close range to send Fiorentina into the final.\n\nAfter nearly three decades, Italian teams have reached the finals of all three European competitions, with Inter Milan facing Manchester City in the Champions League showpiece and AS Roma meeting Sevilla in the Europa League final.\n\n“It’s wonderful, Italian football shows that it is returning to an important level. All three deserved to reach the final, we will all give heart and soul to achieve victory,” Italiano said."
