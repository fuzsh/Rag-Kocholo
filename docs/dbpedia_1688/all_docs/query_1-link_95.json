        "text": "the 2000-01 season was a very important one in the liverpool fc club history. after the great victories in the end-70s and up to the bid 80s, the club went through its toughest phase, having to deal with hooliganism, desasters and even death. a six-year ban from european competition was meant the club had to start almost from scratch in the search for glory; and to some extent, this season, the first of their four-year era, was a starting point to return to europe’s top; they place they had left after the ban.\n\nthese eleven players are eternalized with the achievements from 2001-2004:\n\nsander westervald (ned) – sami hyypiä (fin), stephane henchoz (swi), jamie carragher (eng), markus babbel (ger) – didi hamann (ger), danny murphey (eng), steven gerrard (eng), vladimir smicer (cze) – michael owen (neg), emile heskey (eng)\n\nspecial mentions are deserved for these other players: jari litmanen, robbie fowler, gary mcallister and patrick berger.\n\nafter eliminating traditional clubs like rapid bucharest, slovan liberec and olympiakos piraeus in the first rounds of the uefa cup, liverpool also overcame their first tough opposition, as roma. they solved the problem nicely by beating the italians in their home by 2-0 in the first leg. in the quarterfinals, a 0x0 in porto was a good result, and it proved to be enough. at home, midfielder danny murphey scored the opener, and michael owen closed up the match. liverpool were now in their first european semifinal since 1985!\n\nthere, a real top match awaited – liverpool travelled to the nou camp to face fc barcelona, with a packed crowed of 98,000 to cheer for the catalans. but no goals were recorded, and barcelona, at the time still with pep guardiola in midfield, already with puyol in the back, with frank de boer, rivaldo, overmars and patrick kluivert, were dissapointed and frustrated by liverpool’s defensive force. at home, a penalty converted by scotsman gary mcallister was enough to eliminate the spanish favorites, and liverpool reached the final against another spanish club: deportivo alaves, in their first ever european season, had eliminated internazionale in the round of 16 and were lucky to then play clubs their level.\n\nthe final went down as one of the best in european club football history. german right back markus babbel scored an early goal, and when steven gerrard scored the second after only 16 minutes, it seemed like a done deal. even alonso’s goal didn’t seem to worry the brits, since mcallister scored a 3-1 before half time. but two fast goals by moreno right after the break tied up the game and made it electric. robbie fowler scored what was supposed to be the decider, but “prince” jordi cruyff equalized one minute from time. extra time was needed to decide this one, and it was no penalty-shoot affair. in the era of golden goals, an own goal by geri decided the match in favor of liverpool, who finally knew what it felt like lifting a european trophy into the night sky – after so many years! 5-4 in extra time, what a feat!\n\nthe uefa cup champions went “up” to the uefa champions league in 2001-02, and a pretty tough group came out of the draw: boavista porto, dynamo kyiv and borussia dortmund would be their opponents! when liverpool only managed a draw with boavista in their first match, at home, some started to worry. but after four matches they had two victories, both against dynamo, and no losses. the final 2-0 victory over borussia dortmund gave them the group win, and they advanced to what was at the time the second group phase. in group b, galatasaray, as roma and fc barcelona were the opponents – two of which they had played in their winning uefa cup season. barcelona took revenge in their first match and beat liverpool 3-1 at anfield, in the first group match. when liverpool was unable to beat roma in italy (0-0) and galatasaray at home (0-0), it looked like the brits wouldn’t make it into the quarterfinals. the two next matches were also tied, including a repeat of the 0-0 in the bernabeu stadium. liverpool now had 4 points in 5 matches, but in this peculiar group, there had only been two victories in 10 matches: roma had beaten barcelona 3-0, besides that first loss for liverpool; galatasaray had tied all of their 5 matches. so a simple victory over roma would see liverpool through to the quarters, and the match was at home. with goals by finnish legend jari litmanen and striker emile heskey, liverpool did beat roma 2-0 and advanced with only 7 points.\n\nanfield was once against packed, and liverpool were favorites to eliminate bayer leverkusen, a german club with a good european record, but no domestic titles. sami hyypiä, who ironically now plays for leverkusen, scored the only goal in the home match, and a 1-0 is always a good result in the european cup. but then came one of these historical european nights, which seem fit for liverpool, for the better and the worst. michael ballack scored an early goal, but portuguese defensive player abel xavier qualized, forcing leverkusen to need at least 3 goals. ballack and berbatov did score the two needed goals, but jari litmanen’s goal to make it 2-3 seemed to be enough for liverpool. then came lucio’s historical goal, a 4-2 which decided the match in favor of the germans. liverpool were out, but their champions league hunger was now activated.\n\nliverpool had another go in 2002-03. in group b, valencia cf, fc basel and spartak moscow seemed a manageable group, and at least second place was the target. but after losing to the spaniards 0-2 in valencia and then only managing a 1-1 draw against basel at home, once again doubts arised. liverpool did beat spartak twice very convicingley, 5-0 at home and 3-1 away, and seemed on track again. but a hurtful 0-1 loss to valencia at home forced liverpool to beat fc basel in switzerland, if they were going through to the next group phase. after half an hour, though, basel were 3-0 ahead. liverpool now needed four goals to come back, and once again, it was just one of those nights. danny murphey and vladimir smicer scored two goals within 3 minutes, and when michael owen finally scored the equalizer, there were still 5 minutes left. the miracle wasn’t completed, though, and liverpool were eliminated from the uefa champions league – but did move on to the round of 32 of the uefa cup, where dutch club vitesse arnheim was eliminated.\n\nafter beating french opposition aj auxerre twice in the round of 16, liverpool had reached the quarterfinal of a european cup competition for the third time in as many seasons. there, they travelled to glasgow to play celtic. with a goal by emile heskey, a 1-1 draw was a great result. at anfield, though, liverpool were taken by surprise and lost 0-2, being eliminated from the competition – this time for good.\n\nthe 2003-04 season wasn’t much of a success. liverpool hadn’t qualified for the champions league, and they were eliminated in the round of 16 of the uefa cup, against traditional french team olympique marseille. milan baros’ goal was equalized by one didier drogba in the home match, and the same ivorian striker equlized emile heskey’s goal in marseille. liverpool lost 1-2.\n\nthe era had started with a title, and ended somewhat melancholically. but it was the starting point to an even more competent liverpool team which will appear higher up this ranking."
