        "text": "By Trevor Utley\n\n​\n\nFirst things first, congratulations to Leicester City's Jamie Vardy on breaking the Premier League record for consecutive games with a goal set by Ruud Van Nistelrooy. The Foxes striker has scored in 11 straight following Leicester's 1-1 draw with Manchester United (I predicted Leicester to win WOMP WOMP). While that may have been the battle of 1 vs 2, the biggest game of the weekend is coming up in about ten minutes. Chelsea and Tottenham will square off in yet another London derby. The last time these two clashed in the Premier League, Tottenham won a goalfest on New Year's Day by the score of 5-3. Even with Chelsea being habitual bus parkers, they get their scoring shoes on for this affair. But it isn't just England we're covering today, far from it. We start off in Switzerland as a current champion looks to bounce back from a snowy shock defeat.\n\nSWISS SUPER LEAGUE\n\nFC Basel 1893 vs FC Luzern (7:45 AM ET/beIN Sports 4)\n\nNow I will readily admit that I am a bit out of my depth when it comes to Swiss football. But I'm learning and when one is learning mistakes will happen. Take last week's game between St. Gallen and FC Basel. I predicted a demolition of the underdogs, but a freak snow storm put the kibosh on that. St. Gallen used the weather to their advantage as the conditions was quite conducive to their style of defensive football. Now I sit here this week hoping to not make the same error in judgment again. Leaders Basel take on fourth placed Luzern (or Lucerne) today at St Jakob Park. As the sharks swarm around 18 year old striker Breel Embolo, Barcelona and three London clubs have all shown interest, Basel look to push themselves further ahead of second placed Grasshoppers. Grasshoppers play later this morning in the Zurich Derby. Luzern is your typical Swiss side. They score a lot but give up just as many. Unless we have ourselves another white pitch, which shouldn't happen though there might be precipitation (thanks Accuweather!), I think the styles in play favors Basel immensely. So why I didn't get my 4-1 result last week, there isn't no reason I won't get a 3-1 this Sunday.\n\nPREDICTION: Basel 3 Luzern 1\n\nENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE\n\nSwansea City FC vs Liverpool FC (11:15 AM ET/NBC Sports)\n\nWith Chelsea and Spurs already underway, I have been forced to go with the pick of the heart today as my beloved Liverpool take on Swansea City in the match formerly known as the Brendan Rodgers Derby. The two teams couldn't be in more contrasting form. Liverpool is on cloud nine after beating Manchester City last weekend and Bordeaux in the Europa League on Thursday. They take on a Swansea City side that have won just one of their last six, that being against bottom of the table Aston Villa. There won't be any shortage of attacking football in today's game as both Jurgen Klopp and Garry Monk will have their men bombing up and down the flanks looking to feed the middle. Klopp may have to use a bit of a roster rotation with the Europa League game, but the lineup will at least feature on Brazilian in smashing form. Roberto Firmino and Philippe Coutinho were kindred spirits against City at the Etihad. The former was just as influential at Anfield in midweek. Coutinho wasn't even on the bench for the Europa League match, but will most likely feature today. For Swansea, Andre Ayew and Bafetimbi Gomis came out of the starting gates firing in goals and winning individual accolades. Since then, they've been bottled up with Ayew scoring just twice in a month and Gomis' last coming against Man U in August. I am going with the more in form side, even if I am deeply paranoid that by doing so will make me a gigantic jinx.\n\nPREDICTION: Liverpool 3 Swansea City 1\n\nGERMAN BUNDESLIGA\n\nBayer 04 Leverkusen vs FC Schalke 04 (11:30 AM ET/Fox Sports 1)\n\nIf one is going to have a conversation about in form strikers, you mustn't neglect what Javier \"Chicharito\" Hernandez is doing right now in Germany with Bayer Leverkusen. The Mexico international has scored 12 times in his last 16 appearances for the club and as per the usual with the goal poaching phenomenon the majority of those have been to either tie the game or take the lead. While Hernandez's run has been tremendous, the rest of Leverkusen's offense has been non-existent. The only thing keeping them ahead of their opponent today, Schalke, is two conceded goals. Schalke has been similarly disappointing this year as even with a deep talent pool they can only manage a place in the mid-table currently. Leverkusen normally would have the advantage at their home BayArena today, but they have nearly identical form on the road as they do at home. It just leaves my prediction down to this: if Chicharito scores, Bayer will win. If Schalke can keep him off the scoreboard then they will be victorious. So will he score?\n\nPREDICTION: Bayer Leverkusen 2 Schalke 1\n\nITALIAN SERIE A\n\nUSC Palermo vs Juventus FC (2:45 PM ET/beIN Sports)\n\nWe round up the day's action with a trip to Italy as Juventus continues their rapid ascent up the Serie A table. Left for dead by most after an inexplicably awful start to the season, Juventus now sit just two points off a Europa League spot ahead of today's trip to Palermo. They have won three games in Serie A in a row, the last against AC Milan, and need just a draw to top their Champions League group after defeating Manchester City during the week. As many of its other stars battle various ailments, Paulo Dybala has taken the mantle as main striker for the Old Lady. It will be a homecoming this afternoon for the Argentinian as he spent his first four years in Italy with Palermo, scoring 21 goals. The Bianconeri have been wary of lesser competition after it looked they took them for granted early on, and Palermo is just that. Juve hasn't lost to Palermo since 2011 and I don't think that will change today.\n\nPREDICTION: Juventus 2 Palermo 0\n\nNow there is plenty going on today to wet your football whistle. There are these fine games, plenty more matches from around the continent, the NFL if American football is more your cup of tea, and the second leg of the MLS Conference finals all go down today. So crack open a beer and make sure you give myself a follow @TREVORutley and the site @B3WHYC3 to follow along as I try to follow along with all the football lunacy with a wrestling show smashed right in the middle of it! Have at it folks\n\nBy Trevor Utley\n\n​\n\nWell yesterday went much better than expected. Liverpool massacred Manchester City on the road as their Brazilian contingent joga bonito'd their way all over the wannabe league leaders. Martin Skrtel of all people even did this. Barcelona seized control of La Liga by thrashing Real Madrid in El Clasico, leaving Atletico the chance to pick up the pieces today and leapfrog their citymates into second. Bayern Munich finally dispatched of their bogey team Schalke in impressive fashion to maintain their lead over Borussia Dortmund, who beat Schalke the matchweek prior, in the Bundesliga. The slate isn't as stacked today, but there are still plenty of important games to be played. So let's pop an AM brew-ha and let's head to Switzerland to get today's action flowing.\n\nSWISS SUPER LEAGUE\n\nFC St. Gallen vs FC Basel (7:45 AM ET/beIN Sports 3)\n\nLike Bayern yesterday in Germany, there is nobody catching Basel in Switzerland. They are seven points ahead of second placed Grasshoppers right now before they take on mid-table St. Gallen this morning. It provides a clash of styles, the offensive minded Basel against defensive St. Gallen. While in most instances people side with the defense (it wins championships, haven't you heard?), Basel is in another class right now in the Swiss Super League. I expect St. Gallen, Europa League participants in 2013-14, to try to park the bus against Basel, but it will be to no avail. He's not quite in Jamie Vardy territory yet, but Austrian Marc Janko is having himself one hell of a season out of nowhere in Basel. Not only was he part of the Austria side that shockingly ran Group G without a defeat, he leads the Swiss league in scoring with 10 goals in 11 games. The 32 year old was supposed to be just spare parts when he signed on a free transfer from Sydney FC, but he's been anything but. Basel cruise in this one and Janko makes it at least 11 in 12.\n\nPREDICTION: Basel 4 St. Gallen 1\n\nFRENCH LIGUE 1\n\nSM Caen vs Angers SCO (8:00 AM ET/beIN Sports 4)\n\nFrance is still healing from the atrocities committed last week, but I'll try to focus more on the brighter side of French football at the moment. The two teams most likely to be your pick on \"One of the these things is not like the other...\" upon viewing the Ligue 1 table, Caen and Angers, square off today with a Champions League place in the balance. Both teams could move up to third in the French first division with a victory. However both teams have been keeping their records intact in the most inherently boring fashion. Looking at Caen's goals versus and against is spooky. They've scored 8 and let in 8 at home, 6 and 6 on the road. They have yet to draw a single game this season. Angers has drawn four, and have similar scoring deficiencies. At least the game is at Caen, since Angers has scored three times as many goals on the road as they have at home. I really want to get into the French league to put my bias in the rear view mirror, and then a game like this comes along and just ruins it. So much for focusing on the brighter side. I need another beer.\n\nPREDICTION: Caen 0 Angers 0\n\nSPANISH LA LIGA\n\nVillarreal CF vs SD Eibar (10:00 AM ET/beIN Sports ñ)\n\nAs I stated earlier, Atletico Madrid has the chance to go second in the La Liga table this afternoon. That game will not be as fun though as the one this morning between Villarreal and Eibar. I know Eibar has been on the picks a lot this year but it's fun so deal with it. With Celta Vigo's loss to Deportivo La Coruna yesterday, the winner of this game will move into the final Champions League spot in Spain. Hell, even a draw will get it done for Villarreal. But I just picked a nil-nil draw, and picked three draws yesterday, this one is getting a result. Eibar have been the steadiest of competitors in the chasing pack this year, with their only losses coming against Barcelona and Atletico Madrid. They come into this game on a two-match winning streak and look to spoil the Yellow Submarine's resurgent season. They would also be putting a damper on the recent contract extension that Villarreal manager Marcelino just received keeping him at the Madrigal until the end of the 2010's. Other than that, Villarreal come into this game on a sour note. See they too were bested by Barca before the break, but unlike Eibar the yellow clad warriors didn't even put up a fight and the scoreline could have been much worse. So of course in a way that makes me uniquely dumb, I am going against the form chart again. I'd love to see Eibar playing games during the week next year, but I just think that the task at hand will be too much for them today as they drop game number three on the campaign.\n\nPREDICTION: Villarreal 2 Eibar 1\n\nENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE\n\nTottenham Hotspur FC vs West Ham United FC (11:00 AM ET/NBC Sports)\n\nIt seems there is a London derby on the Premier League fixture list each weekend, and this week keeps up that image. For you wrestling fans (who should be listening to the Andrew and Lou Show), this is the mid-card derby among the cavalcade of London derbies. Both Tottenham and West Ham have exceeded expectations this season, but still are viewed as second rate clubs to Arsenal and even the struggling Chelsea. With the way these two clubs are doing business, and playing football, that designation won't last for much longer. A fluky Kyle Walker own goal on opening day is the only thing keeping Tottenham from being unbeaten at the moment. Sure they have more draws than wins, but results are results and that is why Spurs are sitting just beneath the top four at the moment. West Ham sit just below them, only on goal differential, and have been the more streaky side. I've listed several times already on the picks the proverbial scalps that the Hammers have claimed. However, Slaven Bilic's men come out of the international break stagnant having lost to Watford and throwing away points to Everton. Dimitri Payet's absence looms large for West Ham, but it is the play of a Frenchman wearing white that will make the difference today. Hugo Lloris has been on an understandable emotional roller coaster since the attacks on Paris. The Tottenham captain was in goal for France's friendly versus England and was adamant about doing the same today. When in form, there are few better shot stoppers in the world, never mind the Premiership. I think Lloris feeds off the pro-French energy in the crowd today and gives the home fans a performance of the season as Spurs inch closer to the top four.\n\nPREDICTION: Spurs 2 West Ham 0\n\nITALIAN SERIE A\n\nFC Internazionale Milano vs Frosinone Calcio (2:45 PM ET/beIN Sports)\n\nLike City yesterday, Inter will know before their game with Frosinone as to what they need to do to get to the top of the Serie A table. Roberto Mancini's current men just hope that their result goes much better than his old one's. Well Frosinone is no Liverpool so Inter should have a much easier time that Manchester City did. Let's just hope that they can get their goal scoring boots on against the minnows of Italy. Inter have just managed a goal a game this year (12 goals in 12 games). Their league best defense, 7 conceded, has been their saving grace. You just wonder when the likes of Stevan Jovetic and Mauro Icardi will break out. I think today is that day. Even if Fiorentina win their game, Inter needs to show they can hang with the rest of the upper crust clubs in Serie A who have all scored over 20 goals this season. Sorry Frosinone, but it had to happen to somebody.\n\nPREDICTION: Inter Milan 4 Frosinone 0\n\nI hope you enjoy this bit of supplemental European football to your football of the American variety. Also, the MLS Playoffs are at the final four right now so rather than put yourself through KC/San Diego or San Francisco/Seattle, give those a watch as well. As always if you want to see a team here on the picks let me know on Twitter @TREVORutley or the site @B3WHYC3. Have a Sunday Football Funday! Ugh, that looks just as bad in type as it was to say."
