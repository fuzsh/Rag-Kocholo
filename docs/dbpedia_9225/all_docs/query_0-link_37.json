She remembers her first profound musical experience, when a beloved music teacher took her first grade class on a field trip to the Hollywood Bowl to sing onstage. After that, she was inspired for life, forever establishing a great reverence for music educators everywhere and the desire to contribute unifying art to a divided world.\n\nShe began her voice journey with Ms. Ania Balon-Kurpiewski, former singer with the LA Phil and music director at Our Lady of Lourdes Parish in Tujunga, California, where Jenny was first awestruck by sacred music. In 2015, Jenny then went on to study Opera at the Frost School of Music in Miami, Florida under the outstanding tutelage of Dr. Nobleza Pilar and Ms. Jeanette Thompson, both Fulbright Scholars and barrier-breaking artists. There, Jenny also studied under the notable direction of Alan Johnson, Jeffrey Buchman, Dr. Corin Overland, Dr. Coreen Duffy, Kevin Short, Anita Castiglione, Alberto De La Reguera and Dafnis Prieto. In 2017, Jenny performed in multiple concerts and master classes in Salzburg, Austria during the esteemed Salzburg Festival, markedly for world-renowned soprano Helen Donath.\n\nIn 2018, she sang for Miami's premier jazz radio station, WDNA, as a member of the Frost Latin Jazz Orchestra, a multiple Downbeat award winner that year. While living in Miami, she performed the role of Fraarte from Handel's Radamisto with Miami Music Festival, under the baton & studio of renowned soprano Sandra Lopez-Neill. During the festival, Jenny performed in master classes for Helden tenor Alan Held and vocal pedagogue, Manny Perez. Ms. Thompson also sang under the baton of Michael Rossi for a performance of Act II from Wagner's Lohengrin at the New World Center in Miami Beach, hosted by the Miami Wagner Institute. Upon discovering a love for teaching that same year, Jenny vowed to be a lifelong learner and music educator for decades to come.\n\nJenny's next chapter in voice performance and pedagogy serendipitously landed her in the Master's Voice Program at the Lamont School of Music in Denver, Colorado, which she graduated from in March 2022. There, Ms. Thompson zeroed in on her evolving fach (lyric coloratura mezzo/soprano) and staple repertoire in the studio of Catherine Kasch. Jenny has also collaborated with multifaceted pianists Sahar Nouri and Beth Nielsen, notably to perform music by minority composers like Florence Price. Fascinated by the stories of underdog Black American composers like Price, Ms. Thompson has pursued and presented her research on Black American classical composers at various conferences and lecture series, earning her the opportunity to present at the National MLA Meeting in 2021. You may read about \"Bias in the Canon: An Exploration into Whitewashing in America's Classical Music and Its Forgotten African-American Past\" here:\n\nhttps://digitalcommons.du.edu/musicology_student/46/\n\nMs. Thompson actively performs in the area, most recently joining Opera Colorado as a mezzo soprano at the Ellie Caulkins Opera House (May 2022).\n\nLast year, she sang the role of Zweite Dame from Mozart’s Die Zauberflöte with Lamont Opera Theater. In addition to DJing and writing in her \"free time,\" she remains a globally inspired teacher & researcher dedicated to the expansion of musical expression. Inspired by the Colorado music community, Jenny's vision for teaching blends groundbreaking voice science with holistic wellness, which she uses to build confident singers with solid technique, enhanced bodily awareness, artistic expression, freedom of the breath, and most importantly, vocal health. She currently resides in Denver, where she continually strives to bridge her passion of music with her love of service through education, research, and performance. Jenny has been actively teaching various age groups in her private studio throughout the Greater Denver area since moving here in 2019.\n\n“Music enhances the education of our children by helping them to make connections and broadening the depth with which they think and feel.
