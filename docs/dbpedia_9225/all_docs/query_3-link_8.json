        "text": "back to the wasteland\n\nMARIO CALIRE\n\nJUNE 24, 1974\n\nINFO:\n\nBIRTH PLACE: Buffalo, NY\n\nAGE: 26\n\nOCCUPATION: Drummer\n\nLISTENS TO: Massive Attack, Bob Dylan, Elliot Smith, Sheryl Crow, Bob Marley, Pearl Jam, Beastie Boys, Lauren Hill, Jeff Buckley, and The Beastie Boys\n\nEDUCATION: two years at Cal Arts (Mario was only 16 when he auditioned-he previously skipped a grade)\n\nOTHER GIGS: touring drummer for Liz Phair and Smashmouth\n\nGEAR: Singerland Drums, and Vater sticks\n\nMario is the baby of the band. He was the last one to join, at the very end of Bringing Down the Horse. If you look in the liner notes of BDTH, you see, \"all drums played by Matt Chamberlain.\" When the Wallflowers finished the record, they still didn't have a full-time drummer. Jakob and Andy Slater went out to look for someone to fill the job. They called in various people to audition, but had decided to keep looking. One night at an LA club, called The Mint, a young Mario Calire was playing with his band, 2-Piece, and Jake and Andy were watching in the crowd. They later called Mario to audition, and they liked his sound, so they asked him to join the band.\n\nFor more information about Mario, go to AFTER THE BLACKBIRD SINGS, Mario's \"unofficial\" site.\n\nQuotes:\n\n\"We're a lot sexier now.\"-Mario on what the most significant difference is between Breach and Bringing Down the Horse.\n\n\"He [Dylan] has obvious advantages to being the songwriter, but theres a whole other side of it, which is more work, less privacy, and so Im really happy with my role. I can walk around and most of the time people dont bother me or recognize me. But if you go with Jake, everybody hounds him. Thats just the way it is. Thats the flip side to success.\"\n\n\"My very first gig was hysterical, Mario recalls. I havent had as weird a gig since. We were playing background music for a miniature horse auction! Since then Ive done everything from all-nighters in smoky blues clubs to putting on a tux and playing at a wedding.\"\n\n\"My dad raised me with the attitude that you should be as versatile as you can in order to work. You can learn form every kind of music. Its all valid. My father was more of a blues, R&B, jazz, rock, funk, boogie woogie guy. I was raised on equal doses of that stuff, and I liked it all.\"\n\n\"A lot of times youre playing in front of nothing but strangers. The challenge there is to concentrate on the music. It may be the hundredth show youve played, but its the first time those people have seen you. Theyre playing good money to see you play, so you owe it to them to do a good job.\"\n\n\"I cant tell you how stoked I am!\" -Mario on his Singerland drums."
