        "text": "Today's Highlight in History:\n\nOn June 25, 1973, former White House Counsel John W. Dean began testifying before the Senate Watergate Committee, implicating top administration officials, including President Richard Nixon as well as himself, in the Watergate scandal and cover-up.\n\nOn this date:\n\nIn 1788, Virginia ratified the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIn 1876, Lt. Col. Colonel George A. Custer and his 7th Cavalry were wiped out by Sioux and Cheyenne Indians in the Battle of the Little Bighorn in Montana.\n\nIn 1888, the Republican National Convention, meeting in Chicago, nominated Benjamin Harrison for the presidency. (Harrison went on to win the election, defeating President Grover Cleveland.)\n\nIn 1910, President William Howard Taft signed the White-Slave Traffic Act, more popularly known as the Mann Act, which made it illegal to transport women across state lines for \"immoral\" purposes.\n\nIn 1938, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 was enacted.\n\nIn 1943, Congress passed, over President Franklin D. Roosevelt's veto, the Smith-Connally Anti-Strike Act, which allowed the federal government to seize and operate privately owned war plants facing labor strikes.\n\nIn 1950, war broke out in Korea as forces from the communist North invaded the South.\n\nIn 1962, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Engel v. Vitale, ruled 6-1 that recitation of a state-sponsored prayer in New York State public schools was unconstitutional.\n\nIn 1988, American-born Mildred Gillars, known as \"Axis Sally\" for her Nazi propaganda broadcasts during World War II, died in Columbus, Ohio, at age 87. (Gillars had served 12 years in prison for treason.)\n\nIn 1993, Kim Campbell was sworn in as Canada's 19th prime minister, the first woman to hold the post.\n\nIn 1998, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a line-item veto law as unconstitutional, and ruled that HIV-infected people are protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nIn 2009, death claimed Michael Jackson, the \"King of Pop,\" in Los Angeles at age 50 and actress Farrah Fawcett in Santa Monica, Calif. at age 62.\n\nTen years ago: The Recording Industry Association of America threatened to sue hundreds of individual computer users who were illegally sharing music files online. Former Georgia Gov. Lester Maddox, a symbol of Old South segregation, died in Atlanta at age 87.\n\nFive years ago: A divided U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Louisiana law that allowed capital punishment for people convicted of raping children under 12; the ruling also invalidated laws in five other states that allowed executions for child rape that did not result in the death of the victim. A jury in Woburn, Mass., convicted Neil Entwistle of first-degree murder in the deaths of his wife, Rachel, 27, and their 9-month-old baby, Lillian Rose. (Entwistle was sentenced the next day to two life prison terms without possibility of parole.) Wesley N. Higdon, 25, shot and killed five workers and himself at a western Kentucky plastics plant; a sixth victim survived.\n\nOne year ago: A divided U.S. Supreme Court threw out major parts of Arizona's tough crackdown on people living in the U.S. without legal permission, while unanimously upholding the law's most-discussed provision: requiring police to check the immigration status of those they stop for other reasons, but limiting the legal consequences. With BeBe Winans singing \"God Bless America,\" a final steel beam was lifted atop a new World Trade Center skyscraper in New York City.\n\nToday's Birthdays: Actress June Lockhart is 88.
