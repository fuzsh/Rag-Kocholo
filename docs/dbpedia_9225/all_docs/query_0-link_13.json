Though he has had minor roles in mainstream films such as Arizona Dream, The Funeral and Palookaville, he is most associated with independent movies, including Buffalo '66, which he wrote, directed, scored and starred in and The Brown Bunny, which he also wrote, directed, produced, starred in and photographed. In the early 2000s, he released several solo recordings on Warp Records.\n\nLawrence Wendell Pfohl (born June 2, 1958) better known by the ring name Lex Luger, is an American retired professional wrestler, television producer and football player currently working with WWE on their wellness policy. He is best known for his work with Jim Crockett Promotions, World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). Luger is a two-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion and one-time WWA World Heavyweight Champion. He is also a five-time NWA/WCW United States Heavyweight Champion who holds the records for consecutive days and total days as champion. Although he never won a championship in the WWF, he challenged for every title in the organization (including WWF World Heavyweight Championship matches at SummerSlam in 1993 and WrestleMania X in 1994) and was the 1994 Royal Rumble co-winner with Bret Hart. Pro Wrestling Illustrated readers voted Luger the Most Popular Wrestler of the Year in 1993. Luger is the second WCW Triple Crown Champion.\n\nWendie Malick (born December 13, 1950) is an American actress and former fashion model, known for her roles in various television comedies. She starred as Judith Tupper Stone in the HBO sitcom Dream On, and as Nina Van Horn in the NBC sitcom Just Shoot Me!, for which she was nominated for two Primetime Emmys and a Golden Globe Award. She also starred as Victoria Chase in the TV Land comedy series Hot in Cleveland. She is also known for her recurring role as Ronee Lawrence on the final season of Frasier.

Born in Buffalo, New York on May 2, 1952, her interest in acting was sparked at a young age. Armed with a Bachelor's degree from the Juilliard School, Baranski embarked on her acting journey in the late 1970s, demonstrating her craft across theatre, television and film. Baranski quickly established herself as a tour de force in the theater world, winning two Tony Awards for Best Featured Actress in a Play for her performances in The Real Thing and Rumors. However, it was her portrayal of Maryann Thorpe in the CBS sitcom Cybill that catapulted her into the spotlight, earning her an Emmy Award. Her versatility has been showcased in a diverse range of roles, from the prim and proper Diane Lockhart in The Good Wife to the flamboyant Tanya in the Mamma Mia! film series. Beyond her acting prowess, Christine Baranski is known for her philanthropic endeavors. She has dedicated substantial efforts towards arts education and promoting theater among the youth. Her contributions were recognized when she was awarded the Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts by Juilliard. Balancing a successful career while raising two daughters, Baranski's life serves as inspiration for many aspiring actors, proof that with grit, talent, and dedication, one can indeed succeed in the world of entertainment."
