The tour was one of the most profitable ever on a per-show basis, averaging over $5 million per concert. The joint tour came after the two had finished their own solo tours in 2013 and 2014 and the tour is named from Jay-Z's 2013 song \"Part II (On the Run)\", which features Beyonce. The tour grossed $96 million in the first 19 North American shows and $109.7 million in total and the show was broadcast in its entirety on September 20, 2014 on HBO.\n\nAlso, Today In:\n\n1966 - The Beatles started a two-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"Paperback Writer,\" the group's 12th U.S. No. 1 single.\n\n1966 - Jackie Wilson was arrested for inciting a riot and refusing to obey a police order at a nightclub in Port Arthur, Texas.
