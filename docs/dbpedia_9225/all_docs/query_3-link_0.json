        "text": "American drummer, based in Los Angeles\n\nMusical artist\n\nMario Calire is an American drummer, based in Los Angeles, known for his affiliations with The Wallflowers and Ozomatli and his wide-ranging freelance work.[1][2]\n\nA native of Buffalo, New York, Calire moved to California when his father, the keyboard and saxophone player Jimmy Calire, had a gig with the band America. Calire and his two brothers were raised in the bohemian Ojai Valley by his father and artist mother.\n\nCalire studied jazz and world music at the California Institute of the Arts. He played frequently around Los Angeles, joining The Wallflowers in 1995 and remaining during the band’s peak years, during which time the band won the Grammy Awards for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group for the song \"One Headlight\".\n\nIn 2003, Calire joined Los Angeles Latin band Ozomatli.[3] The album, Street Signs, won two Grammys and fueled a career resurgence bolstered by the band's live shows. During Calire's ten-years with the bad, Ozomatli toured throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, Burma, Mongolia, Egypt, Tunisia, Jordan, Lithuania and India. After an amicable split with Ozomatli, Calire began playing with The Wallflowers again as they toured in support of their 2012 record, \"Glad All Over\". He has since worked as a freelance drummer with artists like Rickie Lee Jones, Liz Phair, Nikka Costa, Brett Dennen, and Pat Green.\n\nHe is the brother of the animation director, Jamie Caliri.\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\n1999 Smooth Sailin' - Marty Grebb - drums\n\n2000 Blues for a Rotten Afternoon]] - Various Artists - drums\n\n2001 Big Slow Mover - Phil Cody - performer\n\n2001 The Ballad of Liverpool Slim - Jackie Lomax - drums\n\n2001 I Am Sam [Bonus Tracks] - Original Soundtrack - drums\n\n2002 I Am Sam [Japanese Bonus Tracks] - Original Soundtrack - drums\n\n2002 I Am Sam - Original Soundtrack - drums\n\n2002 Red Letter Days - The Wallflowers - drums, backing vocals, group member\n\n2002 Trampoline Records Greatest Hits, Vol. 1 - Various Artists - cymbals, drums\n\n2003 Broken Promises - Rusty Truck - drums\n\n2003 Coming Up [EP] - Ozomatli - drums\n\n2003 Evening of My Best Day - Rickie Lee Jones - drums\n\n2003 Liz Phair [Clean] - Liz Phair - drums\n\n2003 Liz Phair - Liz Phair - drums\n\n2003 Trampoline Records Greatest Hits, Vol. 2 - Various Artists - drums\n\n2004 Everything I've Got in My Pocket - Minnie Driver - drums\n\n2004 Street Signs - Ozomatli - drums, group member\n\n2005 Concord Picante 25th Anniversary Collection - Various Artists - drums\n\n2005 Look at All the Love We Found: A Tribute to Sublime - Various Artists - drums\n\n2005 Here Comes Memory - Tom Langford - drums\n\n2005 Over/Time [EP] - Ted Lennon - drums\n\n2005 Live At The Fillmore - Ozomatli - drums\n\n2006 Here Comes Memory - Tom Langford - drums\n\n2006 So Much More -Brett Dennen - drums\n\n2007 Don't Mess with the Dragon - Ozomatli - drums, group member\n\n2007 Jessica Callahan - Jessica Callahan - drums\n\n2007 SXSW Live 2007 - Various Artists - Drums\n\n2008 Luck's Changing Lanes - Rusty Truck - drums\n\n2009 Collected: 1996–2005 - The Wallflowers - drums\n\n2010 Fire Away - Ozomatli - drums, group member\n\n2012 Ozokidz - Ozomatli - drums, group member\n\n2014 Place In the Sun - Ozomatli - drums"
