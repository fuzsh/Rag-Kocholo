        "text": "Today is Monday, June 25, the 176th day of 2018. There are 189 days left in the year.\n\nToday’s Highlight in History:\n\nOn June 25, 1868, Congress passed an Omnibus Act allowing for the readmission of Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina to the Union.\n\nOn this date:\n\nIn 1788, Virginia ratified the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIn 1876, Lt. Col. Colonel George A. Custer and his 7th Cavalry were wiped out by Sioux and Cheyenne Indians in the Battle of the Little Bighorn in Montana.\n\nIn 1910, President William Howard Taft signed the White-Slave Traffic Act, more popularly known as the Mann Act, which made it illegal to transport women across state lines for \"immoral\" purposes.\n\nIn 1938, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 was enacted.\n\nIn 1947, \"The Diary of a Young Girl,\" the personal journal of Anne Frank, a German-born Jewish girl hiding with her family from the Nazis in Amsterdam during World War II, was first published.\n\nIn 1950, war broke out in Korea as forces from the communist North invaded the South.\n\nIn 1967, the Beatles performed and recorded their new song \"All You Need Is Love\" during the closing segment of \"Our World,\" the first-ever live international telecast which was carried by satellite from 14 countries.\n\nIn 1973, former White House Counsel John W. Dean began testifying before the Senate Watergate Committee, implicating top administration officials, including President Richard Nixon as well as himself, in the Watergate scandal and cover-up.\n\nIn 1981, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that male-only draft registration was constitutional.\n\nIn 1993, Kim Campbell was sworn in as Canada’s 19th prime minister, the first woman to hold the post.\n\nIn 1998, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a line-item veto law as unconstitutional, and ruled that HIV-infected people were protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nIn 2009, death claimed Michael Jackson, the \"King of Pop,\" in Los Angeles at age 50 and actress Farrah Fawcett in Santa Monica, California, at age 62.\n\nTen years ago: A divided U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Louisiana law that allowed capital punishment for people convicted of raping children under 12; the ruling also invalidated laws in five other states that allowed executions for child rape that did not result in the death of the victim. A jury in Woburn, Massachusetts, convicted Neil Entwistle of first-degree murder in the deaths of his wife, Rachel, 27, and their 9-month-old baby, Lillian Rose. (Entwistle was sentenced the next day to two life prison terms without possibility of parole.)\n\nFive years ago: President Barack Obama declared the debate over climate change and its causes obsolete as he announced at Georgetown University a wide-ranging plan to tackle pollution and prepare communities for global warming. Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed the whereabouts of National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden at a Moscow airport, but promptly rejected a U.S. plea to turn him over. Democratic Texas State Senator Wendy Davis began a one-woman filibuster to block a GOP-led effort to impose stringent new abortion restrictions across the nation’s second-most populous state. (Republicans voted to end the filibuster minutes before midnight, sparking a chaotic scene with demonstrators who succeeded in forcing lawmakers to miss the deadline for passing the bill.)\n\nOne year ago: In eastern Pakistan, an overturned oil tanker burst into flames, killing at least 150 people who had rushed to the scene to gather leaking fuel. In the U.S., tens of thousands of people waving rainbow flags lined streets for gay pride parades in coast-to-coast events.\n\nToday’s Birthdays: Actress June Lockhart is 93.
