She later married Anthony Tomasello and continued to live in Brooklyn until moving to Hopatcong, New Jersey just three months ago. She also worked with her two brothers and nephew in their toy factory decorating stuffed animals. Josephine spent many summers in the Lake Hopatcong area with her husband Tony and family since 1948 when they built their own summer home in Hopatcong.\n\nJosephine was predeceased by her husband Tony in 1972 and daughter Anna who died in 2016.\n\nSurvivors include her daughter, Vivian Tomasello, two grandsons, Anthony Graziani and his wife, Susana and Dante Graziani and his wife, Hope and four grandchildren, Anthony, Mario, Dante and Nunzio Graziani.
