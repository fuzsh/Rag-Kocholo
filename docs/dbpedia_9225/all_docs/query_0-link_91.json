        "text": "Page 4A TimM Guetta Tuesday June 2B 2013 Opinion ANOTHER VIEW Unwillingness to make debt deal keeps US economic rebound stalled The International Monetary und is that elite group of pinched nosed accountants who have been running around Europe for the last several years forcing countries such as Greece and Spain to cut their spending 'I hese arc not the guys you want to invite to your party They are the ones who snap on the lights at midnight and start telling everyone to gather up the beer cans and wine bottles for recycling So it is worth noting that the IM is telling the United Slates to spend more now while the economy is sputtering and to solve the debt problem by cutting spending over the longer haul with entitlement reforms I he global lender believes the sequestration spending cuts that Republicans forced on Washington are slowing economic growth and making it impossible to put the army of unem ployed Americans back to work It notes that the deficit is shrinking fast and suggests that unemployment is a killer problem that deserves more attention Slow growth today in America and Europe is making the jobof cutting debt more difficult because slumping economies yield less tax revenue Imagine that The IM predicts the United Stales economy will grow at an anemic rate of 19 percent next year without new policies nowhere near enough to seriously cut unemployment If the two parties were sensible enough to strike a grand bargain that increased spending today in return for modest austerity tomor row the rate of growth Would jump io 27 percent creating millions of jobs Obama is ready for a deal like that which is why he stepped up on Social Security But no reasonable deal has traction So for now millions of American families suffer long term unemployment the economy slumbers and the long term plan is to borrow more and more money from China enough to make you want to hand control to the pinched nose accountants The Star Ledfter New Jersey school board is at peace TODAY IN HISTORY The Associated Press broadcasts during World War II died in Columbus Ohio at age 87 As dysfunctional and combative as Hillsboro City Council can often appear to exact opposite in the world of local governing boards would be the Hillsboro City Schools Board of Education School board meetings are mar vels of amity and goodwill Their agendas are so tightly scripted they could qualify for Academy Award nominations The only thing pre Abernathy Umes Gazette Publisher public entities be they school boards city councils hospital boards county commissions etc etc is the ability to avoid drama surprise and public disagreements or arguments While this may be boring to the population in general and distressing to newspapers in particular it is the stuff of legend in the world of elected and public bodies venting a win in that category would be the complete Jack of drama or suspense There are no surprises at school board meetings The only things not carefully choreographed arc the identities of the board members who will move and second a motion sometimes a mild but friendly tussle over that along with Rick semi regular citi zen remarks But even those are amiably predictable what with standard homages to Martin Luther King Jr and Thurgood Marshall and his pleadings on behalf of his brother Glenn Rick is so polite about it you almost look forward to it Otherwise the school board is as peaceful as a lake on a quiet summer night This is not a com plaint mind you In fact covering city council and school board each month offers a unique experience in extremes kind of like walking out of a hot humid sweltering summer day into an air conditioned house with the thermostat set on 60 You just help but notice the huge difference or example Rick decision to retire as superintendent ol the local district was not a com plete shock since he has hinted al this decision to a number ol people for several months But his step down withdrawal treatment And there is nothing so wonder ful for a reporter as the detailed agendas handed out tb the media for any given school board meet ing Running several pages in length each item to be addressed is provided in detail with a box to mark how each member votes a somewhat unnecessary addition since there is never anything other than a unanimous vote (Occasionally someone abstains usually due to a familial relation ship with a contractor or employee which is high drama) It is tempting to simply reprint the detailed agenda provided by the school as the story covering the board meeting It would probably be more accurate since the only errors ever made by this reporter in covering a board meeting were the: ones made when he veered off the information pro vided to him in the agenda Lesson learned! Much of the credit for this mar agenda the likes of which have seldom if ever been duplicat ed by any governing board of any kind anywhere no doubt goes to Debbie Lawwell the treasurer and board clerk Debbie is so efficient that she types a draft of the minutes of the current meeting as it is hap pening and so confident in her Comparing city councils and school boards is not an apples to apples contrast City councils by their nature should not be as har monic as school boards can be But they can try a little harder While Debbie might deserve credit for the novella length agen das the state of nirvana belongs to Rick Earley Rick has been an excellent superintendent who as Buck Myers said in reading the board's thank you note presents a loss that is a great one What is clear with the Hillsboro school board is that its members hold the superintendent in high regard To be fair they do question him they do ask for explanations and they do suggest ideas But most of them are so directly involved in school activities of one type or another that they see for themselves how well things are running They know that Rick and his administration and his staff are doing 3 good job not just because he says so at board meetings but because (hey are in touch and involved Sometimes elected bodies that sail along peacefully from month to month are simply not doing their job or are ignoring issues that need addressed That is not the case with the Hillsboro school board The administration and the school board Today is Tuesday June 25 the 176th day of 2013 There arc 189 days left in the year Today's Highlight in History: On June 25 1973 former White House Counsel John Dean began testifying before the Senate Watergate Committee implicating top administration officials includ ing President Richard Nixon as well as himself in the Watergate scandal and cover tip On this date In 1788 Virginia ratified the US Constitution In 1876 Lt Col ColonelGeorge A Custer and his 7th Cavalry were wiped out by and Cheyenne Indians in the Battle of llie Little Bighorn in Montana In 1888 the Republican National Convention meeting in Chicago nominated Benjamin Harrison for the presidency (Harrison went on to win the elcc (Gillars had served 12 years in prison for treason) Ten years ago The Recording Industry Association of America threatened to sue hundreds of indi vidual computer users who were illegally sharing music files online ive years ago: A divided US Supreme Court struck down a Louisiana law that allowed capital punishment for people convicted of raping children under 12 the ruling also invalidated laws in five other states that allowed executions for child rape that did not result in the death of the victim One year ago: A divided US Supreme Court threw out major parts of Arizona's tough crackdown on people living in the US without legal permission while unanimous ly upholding the most dis cusscd provision: requiring police to check the immigration status of those they stop lor other reasons announcement of his resignation effective in January was somewhat out of the blue at last school board meeting But clearly it wasn't a surprise Io the school board Surprises at school board meetings arc against the rules In fact reading of his resignation statement was so quickly followed by board presi dent Bill Myers' reading of the letter of appreciation they practically stepped on each lines It Would have been better theatrically if Buck had given it a beat or two before launching into the letter of thanks Hillsboro school board meetings are so passive and congenial they should require DA approval as generics for Valium Courts could sentence oxyconlin addicts to attend school board meetings for minutes takihg that her notes in progress arc projected onto a big screen for all to follow along I keep wailing for her to type some thing before someone actually says it but so far she has avoided the temptation I also like the school board's policy in regard to public com ments The board allows the public to comment but informs them that they will receive a letter of reply if a reply is needed This keeps the meetings from being hijacked or turned into lengthy debates on impromptu issues before the planned business is ever addressed and prevents marathon meetings If a citizen concern needs board attention it can be added to the agenda of the next meeting Perfect One ol the keys to successful simply represent the best of coop eration communication and respect It is a nice thing to wit ness So what we have learned today is that the number one thing for the next superintendent of Hillsboro City Schools to do is to make sure the high standard of itemized school board agendas is maintained at all costs Nothing is more impor tant Rick please see that your suc cessor is trained properly The last thing this reporter wants to do at a school board meeting is to have to 7 lake notes plenty of that at city council

more than one incur red insertion The United States is a nation of immigrants rom the transconti nental railroad to technolog ical advancements on the informa tion superhighway immigrants have helped to build our nation The solution to the immigration chai lenges wc face be simple but now is the time to take a common sense approach to immigration reform That means ensuring that the immigration bill is also a jobs bill one that gives Americans workers a fair chance at fair wage jobs At recent roundtables in Columbus Cleveland Dayton and Toledo been asking Ohioans their immigration reform priorities There is almost unanimous agree ment that we must fix our broken immigration policy The bipartisan Senate plan fin ishes the job of securing our bor ders It also creates a fair but thor ough pathway to citizenship for the millions of undocumented immi grants that require them It also cre ates an employment verification system to crack down on employ ers who are hiring workers without documentation that prevents iden tity theft and brings jobs out of the shadows But while the proposal debating on the Senate floor is a critical step forward I believe there arc ways we can improve it further so our immigration policy is also a good jobs policy Sherrod Brown Mt gK jetmmtedna United States Senate That means ensuring that American companies seek out skilled American workers before seeking visas for foreign workers Right now the lB program serves an important but specific purpose When American employers cannot find the technical workers essential to their operations busi nesses can recruit foreign workers through this visa But we need to make sure foreign workers being hired at the expense of Americans why Senator Grassley (R IA) and I introduced a bipartisan bill called the lB and Visa raud and Abuse Prevention Act of 2013 Our bill requires employers to make good faith efforts to hire Americans first and much of it was included in the immigration bill under Senate consideration Our work helped ensure that the immigration bill included a provi sion to require that employers to give American workers the first crack at a job opportunity before it can be filled with a visa holder But during committee debate of the bill our provision was altered so that employers now only have to take steps to recruit American workers they no longer have to give hiring preference to equally or better qual ified American workers and can instead seek a visa for the foreign worker It is counterproductive to require employers to engage in additional recruiting steps designed to attract qualified US workers without also requiring them to hire these work ers if they apply If there arc qualified Ohioans who can do the work there is no need to fill a post with an IB worker why introduced an amendment to the immigration bill that will improve hiring prac tices of companies that temporarily hire foreign workers in specialty occupations Our bipartisan amendment requires employers to first offer a position to an equally or bet ter qualified American worker before seeking a visa to offer it to a foreign worker IB workers make a valuable contribution to bur nation but they should be hired when there is a demonstrable need not at the expense of a qualified Ohio worker who is ready willing and able to do a job Sherrod Brown is a US Senator for the state of
