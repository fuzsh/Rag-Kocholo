        "text": "“I didn’t want to be a footnote in all those books,” he insists. “His thing” — Bob’s thing — “is so huge. It’s been going on for so long. It’s in history books, in your schools. There’s countless biographies. In most of the books, there might be one page that mentions the names of his children. That’s it.” Jakob’s voice practically clangs with steely purpose.\n\n“I don’t want to be a page in the book.”\n\nJakob Dylan’s stage presence basically runs from his neck up. Front and center on a small stage at a Manhattan rehearsal facility, he stands at the microphone with neutral poise, strumming a vanilla-white Telecaster and giving nothing away in body language as the Wallflowers run through a few Breach songs in preparation for First Listen: the guitar-spangled, tour-grind memoir “Letters From the Wasteland”; “Sleepwalker,” a saw-toothed romp with a playful reference to Sam Cooke’s “Cupid” poking through the guilt; “Some Flowers Bloom Dead,” a folk-rock groove running under total emotional burnout.\n\nInstead, Jakob broadcasts his vocal and lyric temper with an economy of physical gesture. His singing is a low, muscular sizzle, closer in texture and dynamics to Jakob’s teenage heroes, Joe Strummer of the Clash and the Replacements’ Paul Westerberg, than to Bob Dylan. Jakob’s idea of lead-singer theater is a slight nod of the head here and there. When he hits a particularly juicy line or a prolonged vowel, his mouth will break into something that is part smile, part wince.\n\nAnd there are the eyes. “Sometimes I joke about it: ‘The blue eyes — that’s what the girls want,’ ” says Rami Jaffee, 31, an L.A. native with a warm, wise-cracking personality who is, besides Jakob, the only surviving member of the Wallflowers’ first, early-Nineties lineup. “Jakob’s eyes are worth more than all my fun keyboards.”\n\nEditor’s picks\n\n“I never had a Seventies phase: ‘Hello, Cleveland!’ ” Jakob says after rehearsal, rolling those eyes with distaste. “Stadium rock — I never spent any time working on that kind of skill. I’m very skeptical, too, when I see other guys doing that, pandering for love from an audience. It irritates me. You have to have faith in what you’re doing.” Yet until last year, when he started writing the eleven new songs on Breach (if you count the hidden bonus track, “Babybird”), Jakob’s confidence was a shaky thing.\n\nJakob had already been “up and down the mountain,” in Jaffee’s words, by the time of Bringing Down the Horse, released by Interscope in the spring of 1996. The Wallflowers’ 1992 debut on Virgin, The Wallflowers, a record of potent amateur passion, sold a feeble 40,000 copies; over the next three years, original members Tobi Miller, Barrie Maguire and Peter Yanowitz all drifted away. It took nearly as long for the band to become whole again.\n\nRichling, 30, is a high school friend of Jakob’s who became a Wallflower during the last bout of roadwork for the first album; he had previously studied film at Boston University and worked as a production assistant for the TV show Pee Wee’s Playhouse. Minneapolis-born Michael Ward, 33, co-founded the L.A. band School of Fish and had just finished touring as a sideman for John Hiatt when he joined the Wallflowers, initially as a studio guitarist for Bringing Down the Horse. Schooled in jazz drumming, Mario Calire, 26, of Buffalo, New York, was working in L.A. with a funky Meters-style band when he was hired between the completion of Bringing Down the Horse and the two and a half years of gigging that followed. The reconstituted Wallflowers played 275 shows in 1997 alone.\n\n“We did this tour with Counting Crows in the summer of ’97, playing five nights a week,” Calire says. “And almost every day off we had, we booked a gig somewhere on our own. We would drive way out of the tour route to do our own gigs. We played every city there is to play, shook every hand there is to shake.”\n\nThe grind paid off. Powered by the hits “6th Avenue Heartache,” “One Headlight” and “Three Marlenas,” Bringing Down the Horse sold 4 million copies in the U.S. Jakob and the Wallflowers also won a pair of 1997 Grammys for “One Headlight,” including Best Rock Song. Married and a father himself with two young boys, Jakob was no longer just a son-of-Bob. (Jakob and his wife, Paige, had a third boy in September. Citing privacy concerns, Jakob declined to publicly reveal the names of his children.)"
