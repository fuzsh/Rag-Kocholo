        "text": "Ventura Music Scene\n\nby Pam Baumgardner\n\nVenturaRocks.com\n\nPam@VenturaRocks.com\n\nI am amped up and happy to see the Ventura County Fair has announced their 2022 Grandstand Stage entertainment line up finally! The fair has always tried to “spread the love” by offering diverse genres for their attendees. You can’t just do rock, or country, or pop meaning you can’t please all the people all the time, but they do their best to offer a wide range of musical entertainment:\n\nWednesday, 8/3: Martina McBride\n\nThursday, 8/4: KC & the Sunshine Band\n\nFriday, 8/5: The All-American Rejects\n\nSaturday, 8/6: Blue Oyster Cult\n\nSunday, 8/7: Dia de la Familia concert\n\nMonday, 8/8: The Beach Boys\n\nTuesday, 8/9: Clay Walker\n\nWednesday, 8/10: Cheap Trick\n\nAll concerts are included in the price of admission and start at 7:30 pm, except for Sunday which starts at 3 pm. I can’t help but hope Uncle Jesse (John Stamos) will return to play with the Beach Boys again, and I’ll be honest, my heart stopped ever so briefly when I saw that Cheap Trick would be playing; they were a huge part of the soundtrack to my high school days.\n\nI love sharing cool news. The all-new Ventura Music Hall has committed to donating one dollar per ticket sold to community non-profits which means, they’re hoping to donate up to $40,000 annually! Their first donation of $10,000 was presented to the Ventura Music Festival during the venue’s ribbon cutting ceremony on June 16. Susan Scott, Ventura Music Festival’s Executive Director was quoted as saying, “Having a new live music venue in Ventura is a good thing and the Ventura Music Festival is delighted to be the first beneficiary of their unique grant awards to Ventura nonprofits.” I under stand their next recipient will be the Boys & Girls Club of Ventura.\n\nThe Tequila & Taco Festival will be held on July 9 – July 10 at Surfer’s Point Live at the Ventura County Fairgrounds parking lot. Along with one of my favorite libations, the event features live music with Sugar Ray, Adelaide and Smooth Sounds of Santana on Saturday, and then Bone Thugs n Harmony, la Sonora Dinamita, and Sambada on Sunday. For ticket information, go to TequilaAndTacoMusicFestival.com.\n\nThe Seabridge Summer Concert Series kicks off on Saturday, July 2, with Vinyl Gypsies, Jayden Secor, In Stone, Jazz on the Rocks and Brandon Ragan Project. The free event runs noon – 8 pm at the Seabridge Amphitheater located at 1185 Victoria Ave. in Oxnard below the Fishermen’s Catch.\n\nLibbey Bowl’s website has been updated which now lists all the great concerts for the summer. If you’ve never taken in a show there, do yourself a favor, select a concert and go for it. It’s such a relaxing space surrounded by oak trees, and after 5 pm the temperatures drop to a comfortable level where a light sweater may or may not be necessary by the time the show is over. Their annual free Independence Day concert will be held on Sunday, July 3 at 6 pm, but all other ticketed events begin at 5 pm with opening acts and the headliners usually by 7 pm. Here’s just a few shows lined up:\n\nFriday, July 8: Stephen Pearcy (Ratt)\n\nSaturday, July 16: Oingo Boing former Members\n\nSunday, July 17: ABC\n\nFriday, July 22: the Zombies with Rooney\n\nSaturday, July 30: Grateful Shred (Ojai Valley Land Conservancy benefit)\n\nSunday, July 31: Grateful Shred (Ojai Valley Land Conservancy benefit)\n\nOther Libbey Bowl concerts coming up include Three Dog Night, Michael Feinstein, Air Supply, Bruce Hornsby, Richie Kotzen, Blood Sweat and Tear, Starship with Mickey Thomas and more.\n\nIt looks like Pedals & Pints Brewing Company and Tarantula Hill Brewing Company in Thousand Oaks are presenting the inaugural Down the Rabbit Hole Festival of Music and Beer on Saturday, July 30 from 11 am to 11 pm and it will feature 10 bands between the two breweries. Tickets are $60 for both venues, which includes your first beer at both locations, and a free shuttle between the two. Bands on the bill are Robert Jon & the Wreck, Beaux Gris Gris & the Apocalypse, Shaky Feelin’, Jacob Marquez & the Good Vibes, a Dustland Fairytail, OPM, Weekend Celebrity, Garrett Lee Robinson, Those Animals and Better off Blonde.\n\nCongratulations to John and the crew at Leashless Brewing on their 5th anniversary. John has been consistently offering a place for people to enjoy live music Thursday through Sunday while providing their certified organic beers. To celebrate, they’ll be offering up three days of epic local reggae starting with Jacob Marquez and the Good Vibes on Friday, July 8, on Saturday, July 9, it’s Heavy Rotation, and then on Sunday, July 10, Levi acoustic.\n\nThis 4th of July, the City of Ventura brings back the downtown Street Fair along with the Pushem-Pullem parade which starts at 10 am. This is the only parade I’ve seen, where there are more people in the parade than viewers. Participants are invited to bring their bikes, scooters, strollers and wagons as long as they’re not motorized; it’s quite charming. The theme this year is “2022: Red, White & Blue!” Afterwards, the street fair typically offers a number of bands playing throughout downtown from 10 am – 4 pm.\n\nQuick Notes: Jodi Farrell’s next singer/songwriters’ dinner event at Pierano’s is Wednesday, June 29 with Dylan Brehm, Marina Miller, Emma Wright, Tamara Varney, Jodi Farrell, Luke Hannington, Ella Robles and Aaron Burch; your last chance to catch Luis Munoz before he leaves California will be on July 16 at Namba; Mario Calire is on the road with Jewel this summer and their first week out had the band performing on Late Night with Seth Meyers (Monday 6/13); Surf Rodeo runs July 15 – 17 on the southside of the Ventura pier, get tickets at SurfRodeo.org; the 27th season of the Ventura Music Festival runs July 29 through August 7; and the November 25 show with AFI at the Majestic Ventura Theater is sold out.\n\nDo you have any music-related news or upcoming shows you want help publicizing?

I got the grand tour and the place is amazing!!! We’ve been very fortunate to have Will Breman performing at local venues downtown Ventura (Winchesters and Grapes and Hops with a Twist) having been a semifinalist on NBC’s the Voice just a couple years ago (season 17). His mentor from the show, John Legend, just did a concert at the Santa Barbara Bowl last week and Legend brought Will on stage to perform Joe Cocker’s version of “With a Little Help from my Friends.” I spoke to Will about it and he told me, “Singing with John was literally the most perfect timing. Before the pandemic, I had bought tickets for my mom, because she was celebrating her 50th birthday. Ultimately my entire family got to go, which was wonderful. Mom and dad had zero clue [he’d be performing], and I could see them freaking out from their floor seats. Working with John in any respect has been straightforward and easy. At this point it was like catching up with a dear friend. I didn’t expect the nerves I got in the moment, but it had also been the first time in two years that I ever sang for an audience that big.” Freakin’ awesome, right?!! Will was kind enough to do an episode of VenturaRockSpot with me earlier this year, you can view it at VenturaRockSpot.com (along with dozens of other interviews). Will Breman will also be featured at the Topa Mountain Music 2021 Benefit Concert coming up at Ojai’s Libbey Bowl on October 9. Headlining the show will be the White Buffalo along with performances from Bryan Titus Trio, Lee Koch Band, Jems and more. Go to TopaMountainMusic.org for ticket information.\n\nSocial Distortion (including long-time band member and well-known musician in numerous bands around town, Brent Harding) just got added to the list of concerts for October at the Majestic Ventura Theater playing a date on Wednesday, October 6. Other shows include Drakeo the Ruler on October 1, Black Label Society on October 2, Yung Blue on October 5, two Pennywise shows, the one with the Dead Kennedys on October 7 and the one with Strung Out on October 8, and then it’s Elefante, Inspector on October 15. The venue is now requiring a negative COVID-19 test result within 72 hours of the event you’re attending or proof of vaccination for entry. Masks are also required at all times except while actively eating or drinking.\n\nI’m also happy to report there will be live music at Bombay’s on Saturday, September 25, starting at 6 pm in the back room and this one is all ages. With a small $5 cover, you’ll get Brian Mikasa with Ardi on drums performing new music along with opening sets from Kyle Hunt and Hol!day (Tyler Treves’ new project). It’s being branded as a listening party, so respect and give them your attention; should be a great way to kick off a Saturday night downtown.\n\nOjai Nest Fest scheduled for Lake Casitas on October 2nd has been postponed.\n\nQuick Notes: Maria Calire is out touring with Martha and the Motels; with less daylight, Margarita Villa has adjusted their live music to 7-10 on the weekends; Tony Ybarra is opening for Blood Sweat & Tears at the Canyon Club in Agoura Hills on September 24;\n\nTuesday Blues Day continues past summer at the Copa Cubana with Jerry Mcworter, Shawn Jones, Ed Berghoff and Sam Bolle; the Temptations play Libbey Bowl in Ojai on Sunday, September 26; Kyle Smith record release party will be held at the Six Chow House on Thursday, September 23; the monthly Bubbly, Brunch & Latin Jazz at the Ventura Harbor Comedy Club will feature Justo Almario, Abraham Laborial and Bill Maxwell on Sunday, September 26 was cancelled; and Surf ‘N’ Suds returns to San Buenaventura State Beach on Saturday, October 9, with music from Jacob Marquez and the Good Vibes along with Mestizo & DJ Hecktik.\n\nDo you have any music-related news or upcoming shows you want help publicizing?

The Ventura County Fair runs Wednesday, August 3, through Sunday, August 13, featuring tons of music in and around the fairgrounds (Seabreeze and Station stages) as well as the featured national acts on the Grandstand stage most evenings. The concerts are always included in the price of admission. Here’s the schedule: Thursday, August 3, a double bill with Smash Mouth and Sugar Ray; Friday, August 4, it’s the return of Huey Lewis and the News; Saturday, August 5, dust off your dancing shoes for KC and the Sunshine Band; Sunday is the traditionally Dia de la Familia and this year it features Chiquis Rivera, Noel Torres and Banda Carnaval; Monday, August 7, it’s country star Billy Currington; Tuesday at 1 it’s the Spinners, then 7:30 it’s Kenny “Babyface” Edmonds; Wednesday, August 9, it’s rock with Shinedown; and to wrap up the concert series it’s Wynonna and the Big Noise on Friday, August 11.

Speaking of the fair, the Ventura County Fair Parade rolls down Main Street downtown Ventura Saturday, August 5 at 10 am. There’s always plenty of music; I’ll be hanging out on the Squashed Grapes float along with the Barrelhouse Wailers.\n\nAnd speaking of Squashed Grapes, they have quite the week lined up with Lett, Mancini & Dutt on Wednesday, August 2, followed by Nees Bees featuring Nee Sackey and friends on Thursday, then it’s “Organtua” on Friday with Karl Hunter, and Jimmy and Mario Calire followed up on Saturday, August 5, with Tia Brazda (from Vancouver) who has been touring all over the United States and Canada this Summer.\n\nMusic Under the Stars is in full swing and it’s as popular as ever. Coming up Saturday, August 5, it’s Orquestra Charangoa and then Saturday, August 12, it’s a celebration of the music of Joni Mitchell. It’s better to get your tickets in advance, but if you can’t, be sure to check before heading out to ensure tickets are still available on the City’s website (www.CityofVentura.ca.gov).\n\nQuick Notes: The Golden China is hosting a Roots 805 Jam on Saturday, August 5th with Jah Mon Soul, Ras Rebel and Rising Son; The Queers along with The Ataris and Bad Samaritans play a pop punk show at Discovery on Sunday, August 6; Toad the Wet Sprocket is at the Libbey Bowl August 6; and The Museum of Ventura County’s “Speaking Of” lecture series will be featuring Fito de la Parra (Canned Heat Drummer) on Thursday, August 10.\n\nAnd finally, congratulations to Night Demon who landed themselves on the same bill as Ozzy Osborne, the Deftones and Prophets of Rage when they play Ozzfest this year, November 4 at Glen Helen Amphitheater. Now that freakin’ rocks!!\n\nDo you have any music-related news or upcoming shows you want help publicizing?

I received an advance copy, and trust me, you won’t be disappointed. They’ll be holding a CD release party at Grapes and Hops on Saturday, January 28 where the band will perform with Jade Hendrix on hand to warm up the room.\n\nThe Santa Barbara-based reggae-influenced alternative rock band, Iration, returns to the Ventura Theater on January 19 in support of their all acoustic album, Double Up. They’re calling it their “Lost & Found Winter Tour.”\n\n50 Sticks of Dynamite are super jazzed to once again open for The Young Dubliners, this time at Discovery Ventura, on Friday, January 20.\n\nAfter an earlier Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar workshop, there will be a special intimate evening performance with guitar masters Ken Emerson and Jim Kimo West at the Beatrice Wood Center for the Arts in Ojai on January 21. If you’re not familiar with slack key guitars, the instrument is one where you can play bass, chords and melody all at once. “It’s the most interesting acoustic guitar music in the world,” according to West.\n\nThe 11th annual Ventura Music Festival Student Jazz Competition will be held on Sunday, January 22 from 2-3:30 pm at the Pierpont Inn and it’s free to the public. The Students selected to perform for the judges and audience will be backed up by Bevan Manson on Piano, Tom Etchart on bass and Charles Levin on drums. Besides cash prizes, the winners will receive numerous opportunities to perform for the public throughout the year, including February 21st when the Ventura Music Festival announces the 2017 July Festival program at Ventura City Hall. Student Jazz winners will also perform during the Rising Stars Concert in May.\n\nWatch for the return of Bullet Made Statues with all original members at Bombay’s on Sunday afternoon, January 29 featuring Wes Pagano (acoustic guitar and lead vocals), Paul FitzGerald (bass), Mike Georgia (lead guitar), Tristan Hendy (keyboards), Rich Agren (drums), and Rene Ponce (percussion and backup vocals). Fitzgerald will be visiting from Spain, and Georgia will be coming down from San Francisco to make this happen. I understand other acts will be on the bill as well.\n\nAnd finally, after winning the Southern California Blues Society Battle of the Blues Bands in November, The Shawn Jones Trio (Jones, Sam Bolle and Mario Calire) will head to the International Blues Challenge in Memphis which runs January 31 through February 4th. Our hearts are with you boys; good luck!\n\nDo you have any music-related news or upcoming shows you want help publicizing?

All I have to say is the band totally nailed it!\n\nI ran into Ventura resident Nick St. Nicolas on July 4th. Nick and the boys of Steppenwolf are responsible for such quintessential rock anthems as “Born to be Wild” and “Magic Carpet Ride.” He’s been touring with the World Classic Rockers (with members of other iconic bands) and has several out-of-state dates lined up doing corporate gigs. He’s such a classy super nice gentleman; I’d love to get see him do an intimate acoustic show sometime!\n\nMusic Under the Stars finally kicks off on July 11 with Britain’s Finest, a Beatles Tribute Band, and then on July 18 it’s Porterhouse Bob serving up New Orleans Boogie & Blues. You can find a complete listing for their summer schedule on VenturaRocks.com.\n\nThe summer event of the season, Surf Rodeo, takes over Pierpont Beach on Saturday and Sunday July 11th and 12th. You won’t want to miss dozens of bands all day both days on the sand, a surf competition, a bikini cowgirl competition, a cornhole contest, vendors up and down Seaward from Pierpont Blvd to the sand, food, beverages, friends, family, and of course VenturaRocks.com will be representing! Go to SurfRodeo.org for ticket information.\n\nI have to admit being a fan of all three, I’m totally looking forward to the Tequila and Taco Music Festival on July 18 and 19 at the Collection in Oxnard. Foreverland, 14-piece tribute band to the music of Michael Jackson, will be performing. Other bands include Caliente Band 805, Instone, Zeal Levin and the Bomb. For more information you can go to TequiliaAndTacoMusicFestival.com.\n\nA couple of touring/studio notes: Mario Calire hits the road this summer drumming for legendary singer-songwriter and two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Famer, Stephen Stills. Shawn Jones has been touring Italy and Switzerland but he’ll be back late July, he’s also been recording new material. The Pullmen have been working on their latest Beast Records release, “Going Dark;” they’ll be returning to Europe for a Fall France tour this year.\n\nAnd finally, while catching 8Stops7 at the Pierpont Inn on July 2, I caught up with Chris Jay of Army of Freshmen, and longtime writer for the VC Reporter. We reflected on the state of music in Ventura and how there are ebbs and flows, venues come and go, bands peak then disappear, and through it all, supporting Ventura’s music scene are a number of media including The Ventura Breeze, The VC Reporter, The Ventura County Star and of course websites like VenturaRocks.com. What a privilege it is to be a part of such an amazing music scene. Ventura will always rock!\n\nIf you have any music related news or upcoming shows you want help publicizing?

Jimmy Calire, Mario Calire, and Hans Ottsen killed it. Jimmy brought his B3 and from the moment we saw it in the back of Jimmy’s van there was a hushed reverence. I’ve never seen a B3 with so much character. Both aesthetically and aurally. The power and sound of the organ was so fun to play off of. Especially when played by Jimmy. Mario’s drumming was so groovy and tasty. His technique and style are a joy to watch. I had the best vantage in the place, right next to him. He reminds me of all the reasons I love drums and drumming. Hans played one amazing solo after another and accompanied Jimmy’s playing perfectly. Jimmy even sang a couple of tunes and sounded amazing. I had no idea he had such a great voice. Plus Jimmy brought a bunch of his original tunes to the plate that seemed custom fit to this band. The guys all played their collective arse off. On top of that the show sold out! I can’t wait to do this again and I want thank the guys and everyone who came out. What a blast! My new friend Pam did a blog post with pictures from the gig on her site VenturaRocks. Thanks Pam! Much love to all who shared this awesome night. Thank you so much!\n\nKarl Hunter – Jimmy Calire – Mario Calire – Hans Ottsen\n\nMiscellaneous Shots\n\nThe Crowd\n\nWritten by Karl Hunter and originally posted on Facebook 3/20/14\n\nSo, the first KH quartet,back in November, was in the fusion vane. We played a bunch of Herbie Hancock tunes and went ballistic. It was a wild ride and a whole lot of fun! Rufus Philpot, Aaron McLendon, and Andy Langham killed it. It was amazing! I’m still listening to the recordings!\n\nThe second installment of the Karl Hunter Quartet is going to explore another one of my favorite sub-genres of jazz, the organ trio/quartet. One of my favorite musicians is Jimmy Smith. His playing is firmly rooted in the blues. But there is something about his phrasing on the B3 organ that is so unique. I’ve been listening to Jimmy a lot over the years and he did a lot if great records with amazing tenor players.\n\nWe had a rehearsal last night for Saturdays “organ”ic quartet gig and it went great. Jimmy Calire brought a bunch of his tunes and they are really great. Plus, I brought in some of my favorite Jimmy Smith classics. I brought all my horns with me, soprano, alto, tenor, Bari and I couldn’t put my tenor down. It just sounds so good in that organ setting. I’m really excited about Saturday’s gig. It’s going to be great!\n\nSpeaking of great, Mario Calire, Jimmy’s son, and an amazingly tasty drummer, sounds great, and always instinctively gets what each tune requires. He always keeps musicality at the forefront. His grooves always feel so good and make it so easy to play over. It’s no wonder that Mario was picked up to play with the Wallflowers at such a young age. His knowledge of the proper styles and grooves in jazz and Latin music is amazing and I look forward to learning a lot from him.\n\nHans Ottsen is also amazing and such a intuitive musician. Guitar has so many functions in Jazz and Hans knows precisely where and how to play each functionality. It’s a delicate balance between showcasing your own personal voice and serving the music and I’m learning a lot from Hans’ playing as he balances both beautifully. I love how his playing is both cerebral and inventive, and at the same time he’ll throw in that perfect phrase that fits the groove and genre to a tee. A perfect balance of paying respect and moving jazz forward.\n\nWhen I moved back into the “805” about 5 years ago, I settled in Ojai. And without fail, when I met someone, and mentioned that I was a musician, the response was always, “Oh, you must know Jimmy Calire.” Well, I didn’t at first, but I’m so glad I do now. Jimmy has been in the Ojai area for many years, he originally hails from Buffalo NY and came out to our sunny shores when he played with the band America. I always liked when I heard an America song. I knew they had a few hits etc. Big Bad Voodoo Daddy shared a bill with America several years ago, and while sitting on the side of the stage I was blown away by how many hits they had. One amazing hit after another. There wasn’t one song in their entire set that I didn’t know well. So I finally met Jimmy and got to hear his B3 organ playing and was blown away. A lot of piano players dabble in organ, but Jimmy is the real deal and makes it sing. He has tons of experience and it shows when he plays. He has the knowledge of harmony and passing chords that you don’t just learn playing real-book tunes in the practice room. You can tell Jimmy learned his craft the right way, on the bandstand.\n\nI’m feeling so much gratitude to be able to play jazz with so many great players lately. Jazz is a language, and there is no better way to become more articulate then to immerse yourself in the conversation.\n\nIf you are free this Saturday and would like to hear a few things we have to say musically, come down to Squashed Grapes in Ventura. It’s on Main Street, a half block east of Seaward. The experience there is amazing and the folks that work there seriously could not be any nicer or supportive. It really is a Ventura treasure. We start at 7:00. I hope you can join us.\n\n(Editor: Call Squashed Grapes for ticket availability: 805-643-7300. Also, while you’re at it, see our review & photo gallery for Karl’s last performance at Squashed Grapes).\n\nPrevious post from Karl November, 2013"
