        "text": "Gregory Martin Richling was born on August 31, 1970, in the small town of Los Angeles, California. He attended Winward School in L.A. with some strange boy by the name of Jakob Dylan. *Author's note - quick, write that name down - it might pop up later* Around the time he was 12, his love for music drove him to pick up a bass guitar and start playing. After high school Greg chose to go to college, and he attended Boston University. After freezing his @$$ off there for 4 years (oh yeah, and getting a degree), he moved back to sunny California. He worked odd jobs for a while, and then he got the call that would forever change his life. One day the phone rang and Greg picked it up. On the other end was Jakob Dylan, that kid who went to high school with Greg. Jakob invited Greg to join his band on a tour. The band was called The Wallflowers, and they were touring to promote their first album. Greg said sure and joined them on the tour. As it turned out, the Wallflowers had fired their first bass player and was looking for another one. While they were on tour, the Wallflowers like Greg so much (who wouldn't), that they asked him to join the band. Greg liked the other Wallflowers very much - Jakob was cool, and the keyboard player Rami was really fun - so, he accepted their offer. After touring was over, the Wallflowers began recording their next album. Since the original guitarist and drummer left to pursue other ventures (aka. Maypole and Natalie Merchant), the Wallflowers brought in a few other musicians to help record the album. One of these musicians was a guitarist named Michael Ward. Everyone liked Michael so much, that they asked him to join the band (*but only under the condition that he would shave his head - j/k*). At some point, the Wallflowers thought about changing their name. Greg's dad tried to help and suggested that the band call themselves Cold Fire. But, who really listens to their parents? The band decided to stick with the Wallflowers. After finishing the album and naming it Bringing Down The Horse, the band asked a young, skinny drummer named Mario Calire to join the band. Now complete, the Wallflowers hit the road for months and months of touring. Their hard work and dedication paid off, and Bringing Down the Horse was a huge success. It is rumored that one of the songs on the album, \"The Difference\", is supposed to be about Greg. However, Jakob never really answers questions about the true meaning of his songs, so we'll never know.\n\nGreg, being the nice guy that he is, decided to share his talent with other artists. He played bass on 3 songs on Fiona Apple's Tidal album, and is playing bass on her upcoming album Corrupt. He also played bass on Maypole's Product CD, and he and Rami can be heard on the track \"Fat\" on Joe Henry's upcoming album. Greg and the rest of the Wallflowers are currently recording their 3rd album. The target release date for this album is early 1999. In between the long hours in the studio and the few concerts they're doing this fall, Greg has managed to buy a house, listen to Pearl Jam (he's a big fan & guitarist Stone Gossard is a good friend), eat tons of sushi, and surf the net reading weird things that people write about him (like this). So, next year look for a new Wallflower album and new tour. If you're lucky enough to go to a concert, look for Greg (he's the one in between the guy with the cigar, and the guy with all the girls screaming at him). In true wallflower fashion, he basically stands quietly in the back, out of the spotlight. But, be sure and listen to his fabulous bass guitar playing and let out a cheer when he's introduced by Jakob. He deserves it!!\n\nGreggory Douglas Rishling was born August 32, 1870 in Los Angeles, Minnesota. He attended Winward School in L.A., but got kicked out because of bad grades. Jacob Dillon, a fellow classmate, laughed. Depressed because of his lack of intelligence, Greg went for a walk late one night. Suddenly he realized that he was lost. He walked on, hoping to find his way home, when he came across a chicken farm. It suddenly began to rain, so he ducked into one of the chicken coups. While waiting for the rain to stop, Greg began to hum some of his favorite rock songs. As he hummed, he began to notice some of the chickens cocking their heads in time with the music. Greg, amused, thinks \"hey, that's kinda cool\", and he starts cocking his head along with the chickens. Well, Greg and the chickens were having such a grand ole time, that he didn't even notice that it had stopping raining. When he finally realized that the sun had come out, Greg sadly said goodbye to the chickens. \"I'll never forget you,\" he vowed.\n\nYears later Greg got a phone call from an old schoolmate named Jacob Dylen. Jacob asked Greg to join his band because their bass player left, and now they were desperate. Greg reluctantly agreed. The band, called the Wallflowers, went into the studio shortly after Greg joined. They cut a new album and called it Burning Down The House - in reference to Jacob's drug habit. The band, consisting of Jacob, Greg, keyboardist Rammy Jaffe, lead guitarist Ward Michaels, and drummer Marie Calorie, then set out for a long tour. During the tour the band had a great time - especially Jacob who carried on steamy affairs with Sheryl Crow and Jewel. As the tour progressed, people began to notice that Jacob reminded them of someone. No one could really figure out who, so they let it pass. I mean who really cares if he's related to someone famous anyway?\n\nCurrently, Greg and the Wallflowers are on a 500-city world tour. Greg has recently turned down several requests by other artists for his bass playing skills. I mean he's a WALLFLOWER - like he'd want to play on some other artist's album. Though Greg, like the other Wallflowers, has become an egotistical loud-mouthed rock star, he never forgets his beloved friends, the chickens. He even suggested that the Wallflowers change their name to The Chickens, but they ignored his suggestion. Nevertheless, Greg pays tribute to his chickens at every concert - bopping his head along with the music, and thinking about that rainy day not long ago.\n\n***(Ahh, the tabloids - quality reporting at its finest!)***\n\nSo, What Do the Others REALLY Think Of This Guy?\n\nMICHAEL :\n\n(from Jenny McCarthy Show) \"...the ever dapper Greg Richling. Greg brings to the band a spirit of youth and enthusiasm....and stubble, most of the time!\"\n\nJAKOB :\n\n\"Greg was the (nice) bully who took my lunch money!\"\n\n(While introducing him at a concert) \"And on bass, my longtime friend and high school buddy, Greg Richling!\"\n\n(At the Paso Robles concert) \"As I stand here next to him, I can't help but look at him w/out seeing a ferris wheel right next to him. Would anybody like to on the ferris wheel w/ this guy? (crowd goes nuts) He likes fast rides, fast cars, exhilarating experiences all in general. And not afraid of a good smooth walk on the beach. Ladies and gentlemen...it's Greg Richling.\"\n\n~ (thanks Michelle)\n\n(At the Clarkston, MI concert 8/31/98) \".....Today is Aug 31st, 1998...BUT Aug 31st, 1970...you know EXACTLY where I'm going with this....Ladies and gentleman..I just hope I don't get too emotional here...It's this man's birthday.--Mr. Greg Richling!!!.......Come on now, it's his b-day.......IT ONLY HAPPENS ONCE A YEAR, COME ON IT'S HIS B-DAY....He's acting a lil' shy now, but I know he appreciates it. (greg nods)......\" \".....Did you hear that?? (people in the audience started singing Happy B-day)..........Greg,....Greg...Hey Greg...Can you do that again please?....I'm not completely sure of it myself, but I think it sounded a lil' bit like....Hap---py B--day, I'm not much of a singer, but I think it starts something like that......\" ( The crowd and Jakob sing Happy B-Day to Greg..and Rami plays a 'minor' version of the song giving it a deathbed feel) It was really funny!!!!\n\nMARIO :\n\n\"The bass player (Greg) and I hit it off right away.\"\n\n\"(Greg) plays in time every night, and he's got a great feel, so if we don't sound good as a rhythm section, it's probably my fault.\"\n\n\"And (Greg) plays the song, he doesn't do anything to show his licks. We try to get that out of our system at sound check.\"\n\nOn Stage and In the Studio...\n\n(From Musician Magazine) In the studio, Greg is a vintage man, usually playing a '74 Fender Precision or an Ernie Ball MusicMan Stingray. Both are played through vintage Ampeg amplifiers and a vintage Ampeg 8x10 cabinent. For live situations, Greg usually uses one of two Jerry Jones Longhorn basses (my that has a nice Texan ring to it... Jerry Jones... Longhorns... haha, get it? -CF), one copper and one sunburst. He uses a Walter Woods 450-watt head and two Bag End 15\" cabinents.\n\nSo Your Point Is??\n\nOk, seriously now - I LOVE the Wallflowers, and my FAVORITE one is Greg. That's why I decided to do this page for him. Why Greg? Well, I've always liked the bass - and it's all Paul McCartney's fault! Ok, just a couple of things I've heard about Greg that I've got to defend - No, he is NOT fat (the others, except Rami, are just way too skinny). Yes, he does talk (see a tape of MTV's FANatic or the Jenny McCarthy show). And that chicken-like head bopping thing that he does ... well, I know I made fun of it (you always tease the ones you like), but I've seen other bass players do it too. I think it's a bass player disease or something. Chickenboppingitis! Anyway, it's not weird or anything. It's just something he does. I'm really hoping that on the next album that they'll have a song with a dominate bass part - like the bass parts in \"Something\" by the Beatles or \"But Anyway\" by Blues Traveler. Awesome bass on those songs!! So, to rap it up, if you attend any Wallflower concert in the state of Texas, most likely I'll be there. I'll be in the crowd on Greg and Rami's side. (Gee I wonder why?) Rami's a lot of fun to watch too. I think he's my 2nd favorite Wallflower now because of his comment during the FANatic interview \"...Oh, EVERYONE needs to have Revolver by the Beatles!\" Go Rami!! Guess which CD I pulled out that night to listen to? But, I won't start raving about the Beatles here. Ok, so I actually will wrap it up now... If you've got any info on Greg that you'd like to share, please email me. Any concert stories or meetings with Greg & any other Wallflower is welcome too! Thanks for visiting!!\n\nThanks to Ann, Jessica, and Kristi for their Greg info and contributions!"
