        "text": "What’s goin’ on?\n\n3/2/24\n\nI’m excited today as I’ll be the guest Artist for the Dos Pueblos H.S. Jazz Festival. This is special for a myriad of reasons not the least of which is that Dos Pueblos is my Alma Matter. This is something the School and I have tried to make happen for many years but the circumstances with my schedule this year luckily made it possible, and I'm grateful. Practicing with the Current D.P. jazz band has been a combination of rewarding and bizarre. Bizarre because I’m standing in the same spot where I played with my band director Ike Jenkins and fell in love with jazz and playing music. There are lots of great memories in that band room. And it’s rewarding to give back to the band and see them get better. I’m really looking forward to doing a “master” clinic at 12:15 pm and the concert at 7:00 pm where I’ll play with the D.P. Jazz Band and the Lunch Break Band from Santa Barbara City College. It‘s directed by Andrew Martinez, who I played in Jazz Band with, back at Dos Pueblos when we were in high school together.\n\nIf you’re local come on out. It’ll be fun. I’ll be doing Big Bad Voodoo Daddy songs with both bands plus playing with the bands on some of their jazz band repertoire.\n\nApril 2023\n\nI’m doing some much-needed site maintenance and updating things. If you’re curious about what equipment (horns, mouthpieces, reeds etc.) I’m playing on, I just updated my “What gear Karl plays” section in the “About Karl” section of the site. I have a newly updated Gear List plus a section on my impressions of all the wonderful mouthpieces “Theo Wanne mouthpieces” sent me!\n\nJanuary 2023\n\nI’m enjoying the respite that January brings every year, after Big Bad Voodoo Daddy’s annual Christmas Tour. January is a good time to reevaluate and plan for the new year. BBVD is very busy, working on new music, new artwork, new merchandise, and the like. There’s a lot of excitement and energy being focused on new content. Covid definitely took its toll on our content output, but we’re making a concerted effort to make up for the lost time.\n\nI’ve been busy this month in my home studio recording horn parts and full horn sections for other folks. there's always a lot to learn in every project, be it arranging, or recording techniques. My setup is still bare bones but even with a single-channel preamp, I’m still able to get a lot done. This last year brought a lot of recording projects my way, and I’m feeling like I’m starting to develop a good workflow. Unfortunately, when you record something FOR someone else It’s not really appropriate to share those projects here as they aren’t mine to share.\n\nI’ve been playing in the house band this last year for the Tuesday night Jazz Jam sessions at “the Grape” in Ventura. It’s been an amazing experience and encouraged me to get serious about learning tunes again. We lost an amazing musician and friend this last year when Hans Ottsen passed away. He started and was the original host of the Grapes “gratitude jazz jam” Tyler Hammond, (Drums) Tom McMoran, (piano) Santino Tafarella (Bass) and I am keeping the vibe and inclusive intention of the jam that Hans developed. The Tuesday Night Jam has grown each week to become quite an event every week in Ventura. Every week is a packed house these days with lots of jammers and patrons making it an essential part of their week. I’m extremely grateful for the existence of “The Grape” and my friendship with the entire Grape family. It’s quite a tight-knit community that is also grateful for what an amazing venue it is. A good-sized, well-healed, venue that has jazz 5 nights a week.\n\nThis last year was an especially tough one because of Hans Ottsens’ death. Hans, Tyler Hammond, Danny Connell and I had a project called mPhaka that I felt was the most natural extension of my own personal taste and my own creativity in music. As if it was the music that I absolutely needed to make. I’ve always had an innate inclination towards odd meter and progressive music ever since I first discovered “Rush” and “Frank Zappa” and Don Ellis in Highschool. I haven’t yet really found another project or musicians besides Tyler that share that passion to any level like the camaraderie and the claborbrative sense that mPhaka had. Frankly, many jazz musicians hate playing in odd meters. It’s too bad, I absolutely love it.. All this said, If you like prog bands or odd-meter music you should check out the record we made. I’m really proud of it and how original it was I’m hoping to do more writing this year in the odd meter vein, perhaps if I write more music the folks who want to play it will come….\n\nI’ve been playing a lot with TD Lind and the Avaitors this last year and I’m looking forward to more shows next month. HIs original songs in the Americana/ Blues vein are highly original. He’s a fantastic songwriter and an amazing musician and performer.\n\nI just got back from Salt Lake City playing a concert for the celebration of the 25th anniversary of Caleb Chapman’s Soundhouse. He has an amazing program that has close to 300 students.. He brought back some of his favorite guest artists and clinicians for the concert. It was great to have some of the most amazing musicians around. Jeff Coffin (Sax) from the Dave Mathews Band, Ron Blake (sax) from the Saturday Night Live band, Tom “Bones” Malone (Horns) from Frank Zappa, the Blues Brothers Band, The David Letterman Band, and countless others, Steve Smith (Drummer from Journey, Jerry Cortez (guitar) from Tower of Power, Francisco Tores from Pancho Sanchez and Wayne Bergeron (lead Trumpet) from every top recording session in Los Angeles. It’s nice, all be it intimidating to rub shoulders with these greats,. I was a bit relieved to see that I wasn’t the only “professional” sax player that felt the stress of trying to find a reed that plays well at 4000 ft. elevation!\n\nEven as the year develops ad becomes busier I’m still accepting students, If you’re interested in Saxophone lessons or lessons on improvising click the “online lessons” button up top.\n\nBig Bad Voodoo Daddy is one of the most dynamic little big bands in the land. This 11th album is proof positive of that claim. Formed 24 years ago in Southern California they never fail to slay an audience. This tribute to Louie Armstrong, Louie Prima and Louie Jordan, the most important Louies in swing and jazz, the 13 songs here are all classic and given a classic turn by the fellas, all original members. Louie Armstrong was the first of the three to impact American culture and the first we hear from, literally. An old transcript has Pops introduce the song. The band then tears into it with fervor. Trumpeter Glen ‘The Kid’ Marhevka picks up where Louie Armstrong lets off. That’s the story of this record: seven adoring musicians with chops to spare. Louie #1 is also represented by the classic “Basin Street Blues,” played by pianist Joshua Levey, with drumming by Kurt Sodergren, before trumpet and horns break in. “Struttin With Some Barbecue” and “When the Saints Go Marching In” are Armstrong staples also here. Next Up are Louie Prima’s “Oh, Marie,” “Whistle Stop,” Five Months, Two Weeks, Two Days,” and a fantastic take on his signature tune, “Jump, Jive and Wail.” Plenty wailing going on, especially Karl Hunter’s tenor. The final Louie in the trilogy is the most prolific. Louis Jordan owned the late 1940s with the classics represented here. “Is You Is Or Is You Ain’t My Baby,” played very close to the original, and “Jack, You’re Dead,” sees the horns cookin’. “Choo Choo Boogie” is taken percussively down the track, with everybody shining. The sly “Knock Me A Kiss” is given a superb finger-snapping take and the last Jordan in the set, “Ain’t Nobody Here But Us Chickens,” one of the most recognizable of Louie #3’s tunes, gets piano and horns riled up behind some lively vocals. This is a treat for two reasons: The three Louies and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy wailing in tribute. This one’s a blast. 5 of 5 stars.\n\nTD LIND\n\n9/16/16 TD Lind is a serious force to be reckoned with. His soulful and powerful voice & impeccable time makes him one of my favorite musicians to play with ever. Check out TD Lind's new Video \"Bow Down\" !! I did the horns on this and a bunch of other great tracks on Tim's Record. This video came out great and features the political cartooning of Walt Taylor. I have a cameo of sorts as an animated Bill Clinton plays my saxophone solo on an animated sax!\n\nBig Bad Voodoo Daddy is playing a benefit for the La Cumbre Jumior High School performing arts theatre on Saturday. It's also a tribute to Ike Jenkins which I am more then honored to be able to participate in. He's absolutely the reason I'm a musician! Thanks Ike!!!\n\nThe santa Barbara INDEPENDENT article about IKE:\n\nBig Bad Voodoo Daddy Shows Some Love for Ike Jenkins\n\nSwing Champs Talk Growing Up with S.B.’s Most Beloved Music Teacher\n\nThursday, March 5, 2015\n\nby ALY COMINGORE\n\n“You can’t really talk about music education in Santa Barbara without talking about Ike Jenkins,” said Karl Hunter, and we couldn’t agree more. Alongside his Big Bad Voodoo Daddy bandmate Dirk Shumaker, Hunter is just one of the many (many, many) to have crossed the threshold of Jenkins’s classroom over the last four decades. “If it wasn’t for Ike, I never would have started playing music,” he said.\n\nThis Saturday, Hunter, Shumaker, and the rest of the Voodoo Daddy crew will headline a benefit concert for the La Cumbre Junior High School Performing Arts program at the school’s newly erected Performing Arts Center, which currently stands as the only public performance space on the Westside. Almost as importantly, though, the night is being billed as a tribute to Ike Jenkins, who this year celebrates 45 years of teaching music to the students of Santa Barbara.\n\nSince coming to La Cumbre Junior High in 1971, Jenkins has taught classes, conducted big bands, and imparted his love of music to young instrumentalists throughout the 805. He taught La Cumbre, then Dos Pueblos and Santa Barbara high schools, and he currently serves as the musical director for the Monday Madness Big Band at SBCC. He’s also as invested as ever in the state of music education in our public schools.\n\nWhile we can easily rattle off a long list of Jenkins’s accolades, we thought it best if you heard the word from those who witnessed the man in action. Below, Hunter and Shumaker reflect on the lifelong impact and friendship of Ike Jenkins.\n\n“I graduated from Dos Pueblos in 1989, and I had Ike for my last three years there. When I started, I was playing clarinet. I was terrible, and I didn’t care. Ike came in [to teach] the second half of that first semester, and once I heard his band and saw how he taught, I really got interested in music. After a year, maybe a year and half, I knew that I wanted to be a professional musician. It was that quick.\n\n“He respects his students. He really tries to figure out what they’re into and turn them on to things that they’ll like. He’s really into students being involved in what the music is. If they have ideas, he’s into it. And we learned a lot not just about music; we learned about how to dress sharp and how to act professional and how to be courteous because he’s such a nice guy himself. Every kid that was there was totally excited to be there and wanted to perform well for him because he’s like a friend. And he’s remained one of my best friends my whole life. He’s just an amazing person.” —Karl Hunter, sax and clarinet, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy\n\n“I was in junior high when I met Ike. It was 1978, and he was the music teacher at La Cumbre. I played trombone and was in the concert band and the jazz band, and he was the conductor. Coming from elementary school, where you just had one teacher, to La Cumbre, going into the band room and having him as the director was just spectacular. He had posters up on the wall and a record player. We’d listen to music. It was just amazing.\n\n“As a teacher, he’d always encourage us to listen — to the performance, to what the artist was doing — whether it was jazz or pop or show tunes or classical or choral music. The way he teaches, he really just speaks to young people. You want to learn from him. When I was younger, we all wanted to know what he was going to say. Some teachers you turn off, but Ike always had a way of really communicating with you. He really got under your skin and made you want to learn, which was awesome.” —Dirk Shumaker, bass, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy\n\n4•1•1\n\nBig Bad Voodoo Daddy headlines a benefit concert for the La Cumbre Junior High School Performing Arts program on Saturday, March 7, at 7:30 p.m. at the La Cumbre Junior High School Performing Arts Center (2255 Modoc Rd.).

I'm a guest artist and clinician and I'm going to have some great company. Tom \"Bones\" Malone, Brian Lynch, Will Kennedy, Dave Pietro, & Jerry Cortez.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/612189905549700/\n\nSo, the first KH quartet,back in November, was in the fusion vane. We played a bunch of Herbie Hancock tunes and went ballistic. It was a wild ride and a whole lot of fun! Rufus Philpot, Aaron McLendon, and Andy Langham killed it. It was amazing! I'm still listening to the recordings!\n\nThe second installment of the Karl Hunter Quartet is going to explore another one of my favorite sub-genres of jazz, the organ trio/quartet. One of my favorite musicians is Jimmy Smith. His playing is rooted in the blues. But there is something about his phrasing on the B3 organ that is so unique. I've been listening to Jimmy a lot over the years and he did a lot if great records with amazing tenor players.\n\nWe had a rehearsal last night for Saturdays \"organ\"ic quartet gig and it went great. Jimmy Calire brought a bunch of his tunes and they are really great. Plus, I brought in some of my favorite Jimmy Smith classics. I brought all my horns with me, soprano, alto, tenor, Bari and I couldn't put my tenor down. It just sounds so good in that organ setting. I'm really excited about Saturday's gig. It's going to be great!\n\nSpeaking of great, Mario Calire, Jimmy's son, and an amazingly tasty drummer, sounds great, and always instinctively gets what each tune requires. He always keeps musicality at the forefront. His grooves always feel so good and make it so easy to play over. It's no wonder that Mario was picked up to play with the Wallflowers at such a young age. His knowledge of the proper styles and grooves in jazz and Latin music is amazing and I look forward to learning a lot from him.\n\nHans Ottsen is also amazing and such a intuitive musician. Guitar has so many functions in Jazz and Hans knows precisely where and how to play each functionality. It's a delicate balance between showcasing your own personal voice and serving the music and I'm learning a lot from Hans' playing as he balances both beautifully. I love how his playing is both cerebral and inventive, and at the same time he'll throw in that perfect phrase that fits the groove and genre to a tee. A perfect balance of paying respect and moving jazz forward.\n\nWhen I moved back into the \"805\" about 5 years ago, I settled in Ojai. And without fail, when I met someone, and mentioned that I was a musician, the response was always, \"Oh, you must know Jimmy Calire.\" Well, I didn't at first, but I'm so glad I do now. Jimmy has been in the Ojai area for many years, he originally hails from Buffalo NY and came out to our sunny shores when he played with the band America. I always liked when I heard an America song. I knew they had a few hits etc. Big Bad Voodoo Daddy shared a bill with America several years ago, and while sitting on the side of the stage I was blown away by how many hits they had. One amazing hit after another. There wasn't one song in their entire set that I didn't know well.\n\nSo I finally met Jimmy and got to hear his B3 organ playing and was blown away. A lot of piano players dabble in organ, but Jimmy is the real deal and makes it sing. He has tons of experience and it shows when he plays. He has the knowledge of harmony and passing chords that you don't just learn playing real-book tunes in the practice room. You can tell Jimmy learned his craft the right way, on the bandstand.\n\nI'm feeling so much gratitude to be able to play jazz with so many great players lately. Jazz is a language, and there is no better way to become more articulate then to immerse yourself in the conversation.\n\nIf you are free this Saturday and would like to hear a few things we have to say musically, come down to Squashed Grapes in Ventura. It's on Main Street, a half block east of seaward. The experience there is amazing and the folks that work there seriously could not be any nicer or supportive. It really is a Ventura treasure. We start at 7:00. I hope you can join us.\n\nThe Debut of the \"Organ\"ic Quartet\n\nOn March 22nd 2014 the Karl Hunter quartet returns with an Organ quartet line up!\n\nI've always been obsessed with the sound of a Hammond B3 Organ. It's a powerful and versatile instrument that can wear so many shoes in a combo setting. There's something extra special about the groove that's created when the harmonic rhythmic \"comping\" is combined with bass lines by the same player. I've always loved the sound of Jimmy Smith, Joey DeFrancesco, Lonnie Smith, Jack McDuff, Jimmy McGriff and the new wave, John Medeski and Robert Walters. Like guitar there seems to be an inexhaustible energy in the organs sound that when used correctly can span from soft, delicate and beautiful to intense, aggressive and piercing.\n\nThe \"Organ\"ic quartets B3 sound will emanate from the very capable, venerable B3 master Jimmy Clarie - Jimmy is a esteemed fixture in the Southern California Jazz scene. He is most known for his touring with the band and prolific hit maker \"America\"\n\nJimmy's Son Mario Clarie is a chip off the ol' block also an amazing musician with his own impressive résumé. Mario was the original and current drummer for the Wallflowers and played for many years with the hip-hop Latin power house Ozomatli.\n\nHans Ottsen is a Ventura jazz Guitar Landmark. And a brilliant musician. I love his playing and musicality and is a perfect fit for this ol' school Organ quartet line up.\n\nLegendary Status?\n\nOn April 15th 2013 I will be the \"legend\" featured in the Santa Barbara City College \"Jazz Legend\" concert. I asked if they could call it \"This dude we know\" concert series as I'm more comfortable with that title, but they declined :-)\n\nI will be featured with all three Jazz bands. It's at the newly remodeled Garvin Theater on the Santa Barbara City College Campus. Hope to see you there!\n\nBBVD's latest album #1 on Itunes JAzz"
