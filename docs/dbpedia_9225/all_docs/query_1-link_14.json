        "text": "There has been a lot of anticipation over our coming to Wisconsin. And it started off powerfully. The Tent was filled to overflowing. Seats were set up outside to accommodate everyone who showed up.\n\nCatherine and her team opened the night, and it was an anointed time singing praise to God and ushering in the presence of God. The altar area was packed with people praising God. There was anticipation building for what God was going to do this night. You could feel it as you walked into the Tent.\n\nMario took the stage and began with prayer. He then began by speaking about the opening ceremony to the Olympic games, and how Christianity is the only religion that is allowed to be made fun of.\n\nMario told of how he had been scheduled to be part of a debate where his opponent intentionally mocked Jesus by pretending to be Jesus. The man said his goal was to show the world the oppression of religion, but Mario challenged him to do it as Mohammed. He asked why he could mock Jesus but not Mohammed and claim to be against religion, but not be willing to do that. The man cancelled the debate.\n\nMario said people had reacted to the opening ceremonies and a blasphemous recreation of the Last Supper. Mario said he looked deeper and saw people who were miserable. As if some force was making them do this terrible thing. He said the drag queens in that evil display were being driven by some force to humiliate themselves.\n\nHe then read the story of the woman at the well in John chapter 4, and then asked the audience in the Tent, “Is there a curse on you? A curse you don’t know about that gets you to do things you do not want to do?”\n\n“For the curse of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 6:23 NKJV).\n\nHe described how the woman at the well was not mad at Jesus, but mad at herself because she wasn’t going to the well for water but to meet men. She was asking herself, “What am I doing back here?” Mario went on to say that there are people everywhere who can’t reconcile the life they’re living and the life they want to live, because of evil at work.\n\n“For the good that I will to do, I do not do; but the evil I will not to do, that I practice” (Romans 7:19 NKJV).\n\nHe told the people they are going places they don’t want to go, and practicing habits they don’t want to practice. They are destroying themselves, and don’t even know why they do it. Then he reminded them that when the first man sinned, he was separated from God. He said the consummate cry of the human race is:\n\n“O wretched man that I am, who will deliver me from this body of death” (Romans 7:24 NKJV).\n\nMario said we in America have chosen a philosophical approach instead of choosing Jesus Christ. When sin takes over a person’s mind, the first thing that leaves is common sense. If we want to get the misery out, we’ve got to bring God back into our schools, back into our government, our morals, our family, and our way of life.\n\nMario said there is no protection against Satan in any religion except Christianity. He said there is a miraculous cure for what’s wrong with America – and it’s not too late. It should be shouted from the rooftops. We need to quit preaching things that don’t matter and start preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\n“Who, knowing the righteous judgment of God, that those who practice such things are deserving of death, not only do the same but also approve of those who practice them” (Romans 1:32 NKJV).\n\nMario said the number one disaster of the American soul is that we keep going when we know the results are going to be bad. It destroys both our health and our sanity.\n\nHe talked about how diseases have mutated to the point of no longer being affected by antibiotics. And said, likewise, our emotions. We have damaged our spirits so much that our depression can’t go away. He said the proof you don’t have the answer is that you need a chemical or an outside influence to get through a day.\n\nMario then said the most important thing is not being preached. Christianity is not a self-help program. Christianity is deliverance from the devil.\n\n“He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil” (1 John 3:8 NKJV).\n\nMario then told the people, “The moment of decision has arrived. The moment to allow God to break the power of evil off of your life and tell the devil you don’t want him anymore. To tell the Devil, “You are not going to make me suicidal, a cheat, a liar, or an addict anymore.” But that you are going to be a Spirit-filled child of God with a new destiny, a new reality.\n\nHe then asked those who wanted this freedom from pain and sin, to have a new life, to have power and be free of the devil, to raise their hands. He then had them stand and come forward.\n\nThis was one of the largest responses I believe I have ever seen. The crowd stretched all the way to either side of the Tent, far beyond the width of the stage. And they were lined up and down the aisles because there was no room for them up front. Hundreds responded to the call to be free of the hurt and despair they get from the devil and to have the life, and joy, and peace, that Christ has promised. It was such an amazing sight to see.\n\nHe then had them go outside to be ministered to by our amazing team of workers. There were so many that they overwhelmed our workers. We needed at least twice as many. They were waiting in the aisles for an opportunity to be ministered to. It was awesome seeing all these new souls set free.\n\nCatherine and her team then sang, “Look What the Lord has Done.” The place was jumping and rejoicing as they sang with her. It was such a wonderful time to celebrate what God had just done in the Tent. So powerful!\n\nAs the people began to return to their seats there was a marked shift in the atmosphere as Mario began to teach the people. He was explaining that when God moves and heals in the Tent, it is all God and that Mario himself has no power at all to heal.\n\nThen he began to call out some people. A man with diabetes and heart disease. Someone with cancer. A pastor with a terrible report about his heart and lungs. And reminded them that these healings would be only by the power of Jesus Christ.\n\nMario taught the people about the proper way to pray in the Spirit, that it is right and proper to do so in a corporate environment. He told the people when their body is sick, the greatest lesson is to begin to pray in the Holy Spirit.\n\nHe then pointed to one side of the Tent and said that knees were being healed. He told them to stand and four or five people began to stand and move their legs. He asked a woman to begin walking and two women stepped out, started to walk, and then ran out of the Tent at full speed! At least four other people began to move and walk around as their knees were made whole.\n\nThen Mario called out a woman with an ulcerated stomach, telling her that the burning was gone and asked her to stand up. He had her come toward the front and revealed there was an open wound in her abdomen that was being healed. She was also being healed in her eyes, ears, back, feet, hips, and hands. The power of God was all over her, it was evident that God was doing a true work in her body and her spirit.\n\nHe then pointed out three entire sections down one side of the Tent. And revealed that in those sections there were fifteen people with diabetes, stating that five of them also had heart disease. In the same section, there were seven people with migraine headaches. All fifteen raised their hands and it was a sign that increased the faith of the people.\n\nThen Mario pointed out a man, and said this was the completion of a miracle that had begun earlier and was now being finished. He had the man next to him put his hands on the man’s spine and chest, and Mario said his heart, lungs, and spine were being healed. And that there was something in his arteries that was opening up. Also knee pain and insomnia were being healed.\n\nNext Mario had the woman next to the man stand also, stating that she had been suffering for many years. But her suffering was ending. Her bones, muscles, and joints which had been deteriorating were being healed. Then Mario had them come out to the front and dance. Being very obviously healed, they began to jump and dance, as their bodies became more and more limber and the pain left them.\n\nThen he called out someone in the back with Multiple Sclerosis. A woman who was hunched over and struggled to stand stepped out slowly and cautiously, but as she moved down the aisle she began to raise up more and walk straighter. She raised her hands and walked all the way to the front of the Tent.\n\nMario next had people who were battling cancer to stand and asked the people around them to lay hands on them as he pronounced healing and cursed cancer. Then he had the people give God a loud shout of praise for their healing.\n\nFinally Mario had everyone who was in need of a miracle to raise their hands. Then everyone around them laid their hands on and began to pray for those nearest. People all over the Tent raised their hands and people around them began to lay hands on and pray for one another. I always love this moment when the people move from being spectators to being vessels of the power of God.\n\nThe night closed out with Lance Wallnau speaking to the people briefly, and then closing the meeting with prayer.\n\nIt was an amazing, powerful night. Mario declared that the next few nights will be filled with even more power. If it is at all possible, I would highly recommend you come and be in the Tent. It is powerful watching online, but there is nothing like being in the room when the presence of God shows up.\n\nThere are three nights yet to come: Monday, July 29 through Wednesday, July 31, beginning at 6:30 PM. If you can come early, you should, because the Tent is full well before the start time, and we often begin the service as soon as it is full."
