Click here for high resolution version.\n\nValencia, CA-April 9—Get ready for the new sounds of next-gen talents at CalArts Soundstream 2019. The annual student-driven showcase of original experimental, indie and pop music comes to West Hollywood’s legendaryTroubadour on Monday, April 29. The evening is presented by the Herb Alpert School of Music at CalArts, which has launched such stellar artists as indie sensation Julia Holter; Jiro Yamaguchi, Mario Calire, and Asdrubal Sierra of Ozomatli; and soulful songstress Laura Jean Anderson, as well as pop luminaries like Grammy Award-winning producer Greg Kurstin, co-writer of Adele’s mega-hit “Hello.”\n\nThe 2019 showcase will feature 8 bands comprised of musicians graduating from California Institute of the Arts ( CalArts ) in May. Since its inception, Soundstream has stood testament to the Institute’s famously innovative music school. With sounds ranging from neo-bubblegum to alt rock and electronica, this year’s showcase continues in that free-wheeling spirit, with performances from such rising bands and artists as Shandy & Eva, Dolly Dirtbag, Gillian Rae Perry, and Love Underwater.\n\nMusic industry representatives are invited to the showcase as part of the Institute’s mission to provide career development and professional training opportunities to its students. CalArts Music Source is another example of the Institute’s real-world training in professional practices. This student-run management agency is a project of the Herb Alpert School of Music and was developed to coordinate bookings for student musicians and offer a variety of talent for performance and private instruction."
