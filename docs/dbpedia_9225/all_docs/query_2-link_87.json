        "text": "Friday, June 25, 2021\n\nAs we gear up for the weekend, we're in the mood to finish out the week strong. Work and responsibilities take top priority today as we're called to tie up loose ends. There could be a touch of melancholy in the air though, which suggests that we'll need to go easy on ourselves. We also might need to apply some gentleness or healthy boundary setting in dealing with others too. Setting time aside for activities that soothe the body and soul is encouraged.\n\nARIES (March 21 to April 19): If looking to go in a new direction career-wise, this a great time to get the ball rolling. Trust the foresight you have, as it won't steer you wrong.\n\nTAURUS (April 20 to May 20): If you're craving a change of pace, a mini trip could provide you with one, as could taking up a new study or interest. Give yourself freedom to explore.\n\nGEMINI (May 21 to June 20): Focus on what you have control over and let the rest go. Keep this in mind for today, as not everything that comes across your screen or desk needs your attention.\n\nCANCER (June 21 to July 22): If you're ready to move forward in life, you're encouraged to take a cue from the innovators and creators around you. Don't shy away from the unconventional route.\n\nLEO (July 23 to Aug. 22): You can achieve progress and praise in your professional life when you allow the trailblazer within you to take the lead. Follow your hunches.\n\nVIRGO (Aug. 23 to Sept. 22): Your creativity is off the charts today, and you're encouraged to let your talents shine. The inspiration you bring to others is just what the world needs.\n\nLIBRA: (Sept. 23 to Oct. 22): As the focus turns to home, you're called to clear out the closets and get rid of stuff you don't need. Meanwhile, if you're ready to release the past, you can.\n\nSCORPIO (Oct. 23 to Nov. 21): A little flexibility and open-mindedness are called for today in dealing with the people around you. You never know who might have a gem of knowledge for you.\n\nSAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22 to Dec. 21): You may come to the realization that something you thought was important isn't. Take it as a cue to channel your energy into better things. You're due for an upgrade.\n\nCAPRICORN (Dec. 22 to Jan. 19): Wherever your cravings or impulses take you now, go with it. It's likely that you'll stumble onto something special, even if the path leads back to you.\n\nAQUARIUS (Jan. 20 to Feb. 18): You're ready to release something you've been holding on to, but it will most likely be easier than you thought. You're more than ready for a change.\n\nPISCES (Feb. 19 to March 20): Trying to keep up with what everyone else is doing won't get you too far. Today, it's all about embracing your originality and breaking away from the pack.\n\nBorn Today: Innovative and original, you aim to leave your own indelible mark on the world with your creative gifts and desire to make the world better for others, not just yourself. For you, it's not just about your ideas or dreaming about what's next on the horizon, it's also about putting in the time and dedication to bring those ideas and dreams to life. You can experience success this year in work and love by remaining true to who you are and leaning more into the people, places and things that bring you joy.\n\nToday's Birthdays\n\nActor June Lockhart is 96.
