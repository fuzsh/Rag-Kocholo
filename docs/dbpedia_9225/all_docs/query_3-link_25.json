Norton/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images via Getty Images)\n\nMichael Ward, who played guitar with the band The Wallflowers from 1995 to 2001, has died. He was 57.\n\nThe band announced the sad news on their official Facebook page on Wednesday, April 3. Details of his passing were not revealed, but it was likely unexpected, as he was scheduled to perform in Las Vegas on Friday, April 5.\n\n\"With love and gratitude the Wallflowers say farewell to the great and singular Michael Ward,\" they wrote alongside a snapshot of his custom guitar picks from the era and a few other photos from the band.\n\n\"Michael’s role and talents will forever remain a crucial part of the band’s history. His contributions to music began before his time with the Wallflowers and continued long after his time with the band,\" their brief tribute continued. \"Listening to Thin Lizzy on a sorrowful day. Rest now Mike. Much love to his family and his two children.\"\n\nWard's final year with the band was contentious at best. He was reportedly convinced to stay by their manager after his initial attempt to quit, leading him to finish out the 2001 Breach tour.\n\nAccording to MTV, Ward implied that he'd had a falling out with Jakob Dylan after the band stopped writing music together and the singer allegedly began taking too much control. But other creative differences led to the separation, too, and by Dylan's birthday this past December, the two appeared to be on good terms.\n\nIn addition to the Wallflowers, Ward was also known as a founding member of the band School of Fish. He also played and recorded with countless other musicians, includingGavin DeGraw, Adam Ant, John Hiatt and more."
