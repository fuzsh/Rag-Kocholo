The son of an Italian-American fisherman and seamstress from New York City, Clemente was interested and inspired by local surroundings and artists – a subject matter of much of his poetry and scholarship.

An alphabetical index of Clemente’s correspondents is also available.\n\nCharles Monroe Fishman was born on July 10th, 1942, in Oceanside, Long Island, the oldest of two children born to Morris (Murray) Fishman, Forman at Superior Printing Ink Company on Lafayette Street in New York City, and Naomi (Toby) Adès, a homemaker. Two years after Fishman was born, the family moved to Wheeler Avenue in the South Bronx, where it was joined by Anita, Murray’s daughter from a previous marriage. Anita, 12 years older than the future poet and 15 years older than Harriet, their younger sister, often acted as a baby sitter and, at times, as a second mother. In 1951, the family moved to Wantagh Long Island, where it resided for many years.\n\nIn the middle of his sophomore year at Levittown Memorial High School, Fishman began writing poetry out of sheer boredom and a volatile mix of anger, intellectual and emotional hunger, and an intense need for the comforts of language and beauty. His junior English teacher, Abraham Blinderman, read some of his early work and, in class one day, announced “Charlie is a poet.” Blinderman also sent those early poems to Poetry Magazine and received a personal rejection, which Fishman still has in a file somewhere. As a senior at Memorial, he read Kerouac’s On the Road and realized that he needed to squeeze himself out of the dusty coffin that school had become for him and, after graduating, left a part-time summer job finishing turn-tables for stereophonic record players to hitchhike across the country with his school friend, Harry Iceland. The following year, he hitchhiked the country again, this time solo, and stayed for a month with Anita’s family in Renton, Washington, while he wrote at night and floated, during long summer days, from one exhibit to another at the Seattle World’s Fair.\n\nFishman met his soulmate, Ellen Marcie Haselkorn, at a fraternity dance at Hofstra University (then Hofstra College), on his return from Renton to Long Island. They were dancing fools and very young and their first marriage, in August 1964, fell apart after a year and a half. By then, they were both teaching, and he decided to hitchhike once more — this time across Europe during his summer break. When he returned to the States before the start of the new school year, he called Ellen and they began seeing each other again. Their second marriage, in June 1967, proved to be another rollercoaster, but it produced two amazing daughters and countless memories that will not be forgotten. September 20, 2012 marked 50 years from the time they met. Every personal, national, and worldwide catastrophe, exaltation, and transformation that has happened in-between those dates have joined forces to make Fishman the poet, editor, scholar, and teacher he has become.\n\nIn May 1999, after Naomi’s death, Fishman replaced his given middle name with her maiden name, to honor her memory.\n\nClaire Nicolas White, born June 18,1925, in Groet, Netherlands, died May 26 in St. James. A woman of vast and varied talents, she was a poet, writer and teacher of ballet, French and writing. Daughter of stained-glass painter Joep Nicolas and sculptor Suzanne Nys, Claire spent her early childhood in the Netherlands and a convent school in France. When she was 14, her parents fled the Nazi menace. Her father had a commission to paint a mural in Rockefeller Center, New York, where the family felt at home in a European community of exiled artists and writers. Claire and her younger sister, Sylvia, attended the Lycée Français with the children and grandchildren of other refugees.\n\nWhen she’d arrived in New York, Claire spoke Dutch and French. By the time she graduated from Smith College, she’d fallen in love with English. In the poem, “Marriage II,” she wrote:\n\nBut English I wed for better or worse,\n\nmy reality, my daily companion.\n\nIn 1946, Claire, with her mother, sister and fiancé, drove to California to visit her mother’s sister, Maria, and her husband, writer Aldous Huxley. In a 2017 interview, Claire said that her famous uncle had encouraged her to follow her chosen path.\n\nAfter graduating from Smith College, she married Robert White, renowned sculptor and a grandson of the architect Stanford White. Speaking of the primacy of art in their relationship, Claire said, in that same interview, “Life is chaos; art is necessary to organize it.”\n\nClaire and Bobby had four children. Their oldest, Sebastian, became a physicist; Stephanie, a dancer; and Christian, a painter. Claire’s youngest child, Natalie, died in a car accident when she was only 17. Claire also had six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Until her last days, her close family, including many nieces and nephews, was a continual source of joy. She took pride in the way Sylvia and her son, Diego, have carried on the stained-glass legacy of the Nicolas family.\n\nBecause of family connections and her schooling, Claire was accustomed to meeting famous people. She wrote opera libretti for Vittorio Rieti, the composer, a great friend and the father of the artist Fabio Rieti, her Lycée classmate. Cartier-Bresson photographed her as a young woman. She took silent walks with the Indian writer and philosopher, Krishnamurti, who taught her how to concentrate on each step. Through Rieti, she met Igor Stravinsky and introduced him to Aldous Huxley. Through Stravinsky, she met the great choreographer, George Balanchine. When Bobby won a Prix de Rome, the couple befriended the writer William Styron and his wife in Italy.\n\nAnd yet Claire was not drawn to the limelight. She was fond of quoting the line in Emily Dickinson, “I’m Nobody! Who are you?” Putting down roots in St. James, she created an astonishing legacy, producing poems, libretti, plays, essays, memoirs, novels, art criticism (Art News, Newsday) and translations of Dutch and French literature. She mentored students of all ages at the Walt Whitman birthplace, in schools all over Long Island and in nursing homes. At Taproot Workshops & Journals, a nonprofit that encourages senior citizens to write in all genres, Claire was, according to its executive director, Enid Graf (in a letter to The New York Times,1995), “One of the organization’s finest teachers.” Claire was also the first editor of Oberon Poetry Magazine, founded in 2002 and still published by the Oberon Foundation.\n\nShe wrote into her 90s, both poetry and prose. Writer Orel Protopopescu, like many others in Claire’s orbit, considered her a mentor as well as a friend: “Until late last year, she was well enough to meet with our writing group weekly and would surprise us with unexpected turns of phrase, and a wry wit that was inimitably hers. Poems came to her with the regularity of dreams. There is a short poem called “The Tower” in which Claire describes an old wooden water tower close to her house. Its concluding lines encapsulate her philosophy of life:”\n\nRaymond R. Patterson was born on December 14th, 1929. . He was an African American poet, writer, and professor.\n\nBorn in Harlem, he was a graduate of the New York City Public School System. Patterson received his BA in Political Science from Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, where he was class poet, and won the Boretone Mountain Poetry Award for best poem written by an undergraduate. He received his MA in English from NYU. A prolific poet whose work was widely anthologized, Patterson was author of “26 Ways of Looking at a Black Man and Other Poems” published in 1969, and “Elemental Blues,” published in 1983.\n\nHe also wrote two opera librettos and an unpublished book-length poem on the life of Phillis Wheatley. Patterson read his works widely, from local venues to the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., and at the 60th Birthday Celebration of Chinua Achebe at the University of Nigeria. He collaborated with his wife in the creation of Black Poets Reading, a non-profit speakers’ bureau; he represented the U.Ss at the Struga Festival in Macedonia. He was an Umbra Poet who served on the executive boards of the Poetry Society of America, the PEN American Center, and the Walt Whitman Birthplace.\n\nPatterson was also a well-known figure on the Long Island poetry landscape, a dignified voice for poetry who served for many years as a mentor to many individual writers regionally. His poetry also appeared in publications like Transatlantic Review, Ohio Review and Beloit Poetry Journal, as well as in many anthologies including “The Poetry of the Negro,” “New Black Voices,” “The Norton Introduction to Literature,” and “The Best American Poetry of 1996.”\n\nPatterson joined the New York City College faculty in 1968 and was founder of its Langston Hughes Festival, which he directed from 1973 to 1993. Patterson was on the board of the Walt Whitman Birthplace for many years.\n\nRay Patterson died on April 5, 2001, at the age of 71. He is survived by a daughter, Ama Patterson, a sister, Carol Patterson Lewis of Plainfield, N.J., and two grandchildren.\n\nNorbert Krapf was born in 1943 in Jasper, Indiana, a German community. He graduated from Jasper High School and received a B.A. in English from St. Joseph’s College, Rensselaer, IN. He received his M.A. in English from the University of Notre Dameand also his Ph.D. in English and American Literature, with a concentration in American Poetry. He taught at the C. W.

He twice served in Germany as a Senior Fulbright Professor of American Poetry, at the Universities of Freiburg and Erlangen-Nuremberg. He was also a U.S. Exchange Teacher at West Oxon Technical College, England.\n\nIn June of 2008, he was appointed to a two-year term as Indiana Poet Laureate, in which capacity he continued his efforts to reunite poetry and music, brought Indiana poetry to TV and radio, give readings and talks in libraries and other venues, and visited schools to share with students his enthusiasm for reading and writing poetry and prose memoir. He also emphasized collaborations between poets and artists.\n\nOn Aug. 13, 2012, Indiana Univ. Pr. released Norbert Krapf’s ninth full-length collection, his 24th book, Songs in Sepia and Black and White, a collection of 101 poems with 58 black and white photos by Richard Fields, formerly of the Indiana Dept. of Natural Resources. Included is a section of 26 poems about music and musicians, “Practically with the Band.” Fifteen of the poems are about singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, a model for combining poetry and music. Other musicians to whom Krapf pays tribute are Woody and Arlo Guthrie, Leadbelly, John Lennon, Indianapolis bluesman Yank Rachell, and other Indiana musicians.\n\nNorbert Krapf’s papers, including his literary correspondence and manuscripts, are housed mainly in the Rush Rhees Library, Univ. of Rochester (see a 27-page index), but also in the special collections at IUPUI, Univ. of California San Diego, Stanford Univ., and the Univ. of New Hampshire. The Indiana Historical Society has a collection of audio- and videocassettes of his radio and TV and other readings and interviews that are being converted to CD, and the Dubois County Museum holds his collection of family history materials and documents, including memorabilia from grade school, Boy Scouts, high school, and college."
