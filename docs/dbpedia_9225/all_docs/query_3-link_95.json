        "text": "IT'S hard to imagine a location more conducive to chilly reflections on the aging of rock 'n' roll than this corner office high above the Sunset Strip. There are the lightly misted views of Century City law offices and Beverly Hills verdure; the desk, barren of all implements except a long-barreled pair of binoculars; the brass and crystal reliquaries commemorating Jimmy Buffet tours. But intimations of mortality are easily stirred in members of my graying generation by the fact that it is now necessary when mentioning a Dylan song to specify whether one means the work of Bob, Woodstock Nation's apocalyptic auteur, or of his youngest son, Jakob, the lead singer and Grammy-winning songwriter for the contemporary rock group the Wallflowers.\n\nThat the younger Mr. Dylan was born in the Woodstock year itself, 1969, has not lessened those intimations. And he has a sense that can only be called familial for the dip or swivel of melody that will turn an image as simple as a single headlight into a provocative pronouncement -- as well as an ear for the cadence that lurks as its own song in the hearts of words like leopard skin, say, or Babylon. What becomes evident in conversation is that Mr. Dylan, himself a father of three, is not without intimations of his own.\n\nHealthily lean as opposed to rock-star-skinny, he arrives for the interview in midnight-blue jeans that in their stiffness and stovepipe shape seem either to hark back to an era when denim still spelled solidarity with the working man or to speak to a cool present-day formality. In either case, they eschew any identification with the tatters, embroidery or flamboyant, distressed decades his father gave voice to. Mr. Dylan's manner, too, is upright, though good humored, even wry. There have been times, he allows, that he has had to remind nostalgic interviewers that he has a new record, ''Breach,'' the Wallflowers' first in four years.\n\nThe multimillion-selling ''Bringing Down the Horse'' (1996) bristled with assurance, its hits like ''Sixth Avenue Heartache'' and ''Three Marlenas'' tangles of images whose propulsive melodies making the absence of narrative negligible. But ''Breach'' seems, oddly, the work of a younger man -- despite the gruff foghorn of his voice, which is eerily reminiscent of his father's. Certainly the arrangements are sparer, on occasion almost fresh-scrubbed, with a single guitar line edging toward styles that Mr. Dylan refers to as ''old school.'' (Given that the term is routinely applied to artists from the late 1980's, one might call Mr. Dylan's example, the Delta bluesman Mississippi John Hurt, ''dawn-of-time school.'')\n\nAnd while the songs refrain from committing outright confession, many, like ''Hand Me Down'' or ''Baby Bird,'' open themselves to a personal reading. Perhaps it's simply that his images of vulnerability are often youthful -- ''those days before I met you, girl, were just like ice cream falling down on the shoes of my world'' -- or that the agonies of self-identification are not the sole property of adolescence. They can be as easily engendered by sudden acclaim.\n\nThe writing, he admits, did not come easily. ''Bringing Down the Horse'' was successful enough to keep Mr. Dylan and the rest of the Wallflowers -- Rami Jaffee, on keyboards, Greg Richling, on bass, Michael Ward, on guitar, and Mario Calire, on drums -- on the road for two and a half years. Having had the opposite experience in 1992, when their debut album, ''The Wallflowers, '' plagued by muddy vocals, slid rapidly out of sight, pulling their record contract with it, the group was in no mood to argue with momentum. But the long-running performance left Mr. Dylan feeling ''thoroughly unimpressed with myself.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
