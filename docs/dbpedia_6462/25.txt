Volvo B58 and B10M buses were a common sight in Adelaide’s outer suburbs from the 1980s until the early 2000s. Designed specifically to provide comfortable, quick service, they are much loved by enthusiasts for their loud ZF 4HP500 transmissions, and throaty Volvo THD100DC engines.

The B58 and B10Ms were ordered to replace the large variety of private buses inherited from many small private operators in the 1970s. They also received a special brown and cream livery; these buses became known as the “Brown Bombers”, a name which stuck around even after being repainted.

1445 entered service in 1981, from the State Transport Authority’s Lonsdale Depot. With the “express” body, it was designed for longer distance routes connecting the outer south to the Noarlunga Railway, and bus routes along South Rd to the city centre. Extra padding and armrests were provided for passengers to ensure their long trip was more comfortable. When the STA was succeeded by TransAdelaide, 1445 remained at Lonsdale, in the red and blue “Speedstripes”. In 2000, the outer south contract area was awarded to Southlink, who inherited all of the Lonsdale “Bombers”, including 1445. Retired in 2003, 1445 was replaced bay a MAN 18.280 with AMB CB64A bodywork; these are still in service at Lonsdale today.

After its retirement, 1445 was purchased by Grant’s Coachlines for use on school bus and charter work. It remained in its “speedtripes” during its time at Grant’s, until 2011 when it was retired. It was bought from Grant’s in 2011, and fully restored (including re-panneling and rust removal) by 2012. Today, 1445 is one of just a handful of registered preserved buses in SA.
