It was extended to Alice Springs by Commonwealth Railways in 1929, when it was renamed the Central Australia Railway.\n\nIn 1957, a new standard gauge line was built from Stirling North (near Port Augusta) to Marree on a new alignment west of the Flinders Ranges and the narrow gauge line between Hawker and Marree was abandoned. The remainder of the narrow gauge line between Stirling North, Quorn and Hawker was abandoned in 1972, although the Stirling North - Quorn section has been taken over by the Pichi Richi tourist railway. The narrow gauge line from Marree to Alice Springs was abandoned with the opening of the new standard gauge railway from Tarcoola to Alice Springs in 1980, which forms port of the Adelaide Darwin railway. The standard gauge line from Stirling North has since been abandoned north of Leigh Creek.\n\nEyre Peninsula lines\n\nThe lines on Eyre Peninsula were built to narrow gauge (1067 mm) as their primary purpose was to promote the development of the area.\n\nConstruction started with a railway between Port Lincoln and Cummins, opened in 1908. Growth of the network continued through until the 1950s. The system covers some 800 route kilometres, of lightly built permanent way [\"The Railways of South Australia's West Coast\" Buckland, J.L. Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, May, 1979 pp93-112] .\n\nBHP developed two separate systems.\n\nThe Tramway at Whyalla (1067mm gauge) for ore haulage, and a standard gauge tramway from Proper Bay to Coffin Bay on Southern Eyre Peninsula for mineral sand haulage. The Proper Bay operation was closed in 1989, and removed in 2000.\n\nNorthern Territory railway\n\nThe Northern Territory was part of South Australia from 1863 to 1911, when it was transferred to Commonwealth control.\n\nThe Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway was a narrow gauge (1067 mm) railway and ran from Darwin, once known as Palmerston, to Pine Creek.\n\nThe John Cox Bray Government in South Australian introduced the Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway Bill in 1883. The Â£959,300 contract went to C & E Millar of Melbourne on the proviso that they could use coolie labour. The line reached Pine Creek in 1888 and was officially opened on 30 September 1889. Singhalese and Indian gangs did the grubbing and earthwork and 3,000 Chinese labourers laid over 1 km of track per day. A total of 310 bridges and flood openings were built.\n\nThe Commonwealth Government took over the line in 1911 and renamed it the Northern Territory Railway. The line was extended to Katherine in 1917. Further extensions in the 1920s saw it eventually reach Birdum, just south of Larrimah, in 1929, when it was further renamed the North Australia Railway, to distinguish it from the Central Australia Railway, which reached Alice Springs from the south in the same year.\n\nAlthough a railway line from Alice Springs to Darwin had been discussed for many years, the North Australia Railway was closed in 1976. However eventually the standard gauge Adelaide to Darwin Railway was finally completed on 17 September 2003 with the line between Alice Springs and Darwin. The first freight train reached Darwin on 17 January 2004.\n\nAdelaide suburban network\n\nAdelaide's metropolitan rail network is the only one in Australia's five major cities that has not been electrified. Almost $500 million in funding has been provided in the 2008-09 State Budget for electrification and gauge conversion.
