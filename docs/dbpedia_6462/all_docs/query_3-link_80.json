        "text": "© John Noonan 2017\n\nA Brief History of the IET\n\nIn 2017, the IET operates a global Engineering Association from its headquarters at Savoy Place in London. With some 168,000 members worldwide, the Institution of Engineering and Technology is one of the premier societies for professional engineers. It covers the science, engineering and technology of communications, electronics, computing, software, control, information technology, power engineering and manufacturing. The IET has a history founded in the global evolution of Engineering, Manufacturing and Technological Associations that goes back as far as the 19th Century.\n\nIET HQ Savoy Place London\n\nIET's origins stem from the founding of the Society of Telegraph Engineers (STE) in London on 17th May 1871. On the 1st of January 1889, the STE formally changed its name to the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE). The IEE's membership more than tripled from 2,064 to 7,045 between the years 1895 and 1914 illustrating the growth of electrical activity around the globe. Following the merger of the Institution of Manufacturing Engineers (IME) with the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE) in 1991, the IEE became the authority responsible for awarding the James N Kirby Award. The Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) was formed in 2006 by the joining together of the IEE and the Institution of Incorporated Engineers (IIE).\n\nThe James N Kirby Award\n\nPaternalistic and charitable, James N Kirby had long admired American industry's culture of patronage. In 1967 he established the James N. Kirby Foundation for educational and charitable work, with a grant of $2 million, most of his personal fortune. 'I came up the hard way', he said, 'I suppose it is because of that I felt I had to plough something back'. The foundation, chaired by one of his sons, has distributed more than $5 million since its inception.\n\nTo mark the contribution of Sir James Kirby, CBE to manufacturing in Australia and to the Institution of Production Engineers (latterly the Institution of Manufacturing Engineers), its Australian Council in 1954 decided that a James N Kirby Award should be presented each year. The first James N Kirby Award was presented in 1956 in Sydney. Following the merger of the IME with the IEE in 1991 and the subsequent merger of the IEE and IIE in 2006 to become the IET, responsibility for the Award now rests with the Australasian Region Board of the IET.\n\nBorn in 1899 in Sydney, Sir James Norman Kirby CBE was one of Australia's leading industrialists. He became Chairman of the James N Kirby group of companies in 1924 and set up a $2,000,000 foundation in 1967. He was also Chairman or a Director of several companies and Government Boards including Qantas Airways, Wales Superannuation Funds Ltd., British Motor Corporation (Australia) and Australia General Electric to name but a few. His interest in Education and Research is also noteworthy as he was sometime Governor of the Science Foundation for Physics within the University of Sydney and also Director of the National Heart Foundation of Australia. He received the CBE in 1956 and was knighted in 1962.\n\nA condition of the award is that the recipient shall prepare and deliver a paper relating to his or her field of activity at a special meeting of the Institution of Electrical Engineers convened for that purpose. This shall be known as the James N Kirby Paper. The James N Kirby Award is one of the highest honours that the IET bestows in the Australasian Region.\n\nThe James N Kirby Award is presented to someone who has achieved outstanding eminence, distinction and public recognition in his or her sphere of Engineering activity.\n\nPrevious Recipients of the James N Kirby Award\n\n1956 JD Norgard; 1957 Sir Walter Scott; 1958 Sir Mark Oliphant; 1959 Dr L P Coombes; 1960 Sir Louis Matheson; 1961 Sir Henry Bland; 1962 Sir William Hudson; 1963 DL Hegland; 1964 Sir Ian McLennan; 1965 Sir Philip Baxter; 1966 Ronald Wagstaff; 1967 Sir Allen Fairball; 1968 TA Housley; 1969 Sir David Muir; 1970 Sir Archibald Glenn; 1971 Sir Charles Court; 1972 Sir Samuel Jones; 1973 Sir Henry Bolte; 1974 Prof Mansergh Shaw; 1975 Sir Charles McGrath; 1976 Sir Gordon Jackson; 1977 JR Siddons; 1978 AS Reiher; 1979 Sir Brian Inglis; 1980 Sir William Tyree; 1981 Sir Arvi Parbo; 1982 JB Martin; 1983 JD Elliot; 1984 Samuel Downie; 1985 Senator John Button; 1986 PJW Cottrell; 1987 Dr R H Brown; 1988 Prof Sir B Williams; 1989 William L Dix; 1990 Arthur Bishop; 1991 Kevin J Cashman; 1992 Martin Thomas; 1993 W H Clough; 1994 Gary A Paykel; 1995 Robert D Hill-Ling; 1996 Patrick Boland and Patrick McClusky\n\n2017 James N Kirby Award Winner: Rod Hook\n\nRod Hook is a highly respected and experienced leader having been involved in initiating and delivering outcomes in a wide range of sectors including infrastructure, transport, planning, environment and property services.\n\nFor much of his career, Rod was responsible for the Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure (DPTI) leading 3,500 staff and held the positions of South Australia’s Commissioner of Highways, the State’s Rail Commissioner and the State’s Coordinator-General. Rod is best known for his leadership roles in successfully delivering infrastructure that has changed the way people live, work and do business in South Australia, including:\n\nMajor redevelopment and renewal projects including Holdfast Shores Redevelopment, West Beach Boat Harbour, Adelaide Convention Centre Redevelopments and the Riverbank Footbridge\n\nMajor elite sporting facilities including the State Aquatic and Leisure Centre and the Adelaide Oval Redevelopment\n\nAdelaide’s public transport revolution including upgrades to Adelaide major rail corridors, electrification of the Seaford line, extension of Adelaide’s light rail network, acquisition of new trains, trams and buses and installation of bus lanes\n\nAdelaide’s major transport projects including the Port River Expressway bridges, the upgrade of LeFevre Peninsula rail freight corridor, the Northern Expressway, the Bakewell Bridge replacement, North-South road corridor works such as the Superway and the Gallipoli Underpass, the Southern Expressway and the Britannia Roundabout redevelopment\n\nEconomic infrastructure delivered in partnership with the private sector including the deepening of the shipping channel and grain terminal developments at Outer Harbor\n\nGreen infrastructure including Aquifer Storage and Recovery and Waste Water Re-use schemes and development of coastal and national parks.\n\nRod is also an experienced Board Director, having held diverse roles such as Chairman of the Australian Procurement and Construction Council and Board Member of Smart Infrastructure, the former Land Management Corporation/Urban Renewal Authority and the former TransAdelaide. Rod holds a Bachelor of Engineering Civil (Honours) from the University of Adelaide.\n\nA video record of Rod's presentation for the James N Kirby Award is provided as a component of this article.\n\nThe IET Australian Forum is proud to present Rod Hook with the James N Kirby Award for 2017. The James N Kirby Award consists of a silver medal bearing the Coat of Arms of the IET together with a framed certificate citing the achievements of the recipient. The recipient is required to present a paper relating to his or her sphere of activity which is subsequently published.\n\nAward Sponsors for 2017\n\nThe IET is always most grateful to the companies that sponsor the events we hold. The IET's events are organised by volunteers working with a restricted budget from the IET itself. Without the generous sponsorship we receive from local Engineering and other companies, the IET would find it difficult to hold the events it runs.\n\nThe IET acknowledges the generous sponsorship of three companies for the 2017 James N Kirby Award Dinner. Those three companies are:\n\nGOLD SPONSOR: Promanage, thanks to Gary Neave.\n\nSILVER SPONSORS: GHD thanks to Benjamin Wells, and Lucid Consulting thanks to Brent Pergallini.\n\nIn recognition of Promanage's Gold Sponsorship, one of their Directors gave a most interesting presentation. The presentation was given by Dr Josh Smith, one of Promanage's Directors. Josh's presentation was on the Project Management work he provided on behalf of Promanage to Sundrop Farms in the construction of an Innovative Hydroponic Vegetable Farming Operation powered by the Sun in the mid north of South Australia, near Port Augusta. Thanks also to David Alm of GHD for providing historical information about the Kirby Award.\n\nIET invites its members and non-members alike to show support for great South Australian companies like Promanage, Lucid Consulting and GHD.\n\nJohn Noonan, Secretary and Deputy Chair, IET SA/NT Local Network."
