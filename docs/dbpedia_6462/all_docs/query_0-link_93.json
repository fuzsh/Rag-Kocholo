        "text": "Confession time; I have been totally sucked in by the Climate Change scam – going around talking like a true believer without bothering to check the authenticity of the many talking heads spruiking this fable. I am still a supporter of renewable power sources and will probably write a bit about those later but for now I want to concentrate on an article to which my, less easily hoodwinked, wife has drawn my attention.\n\nI want you to read this article as I think that the composition of the body that has published it and the meticulous reference bibliography provided by the author leave no doubt as to the reliability of the document and its conclusions. I am particularly appalled by the part that BBC TV is shown to have played in this deception – although, having in the distant past has some glimpse of the underbelly of that organisation’s White City studios, I am not altogether surprised.\n\nI also had a small part in the developing Nuclear power industry in the UK when, in common with many others, I believed that we were creating the answer to the country’s forthcoming power needs. That was in the 1950’s and, so far as I am aware, nuclear power generation has yet to make any significant contribution there. I mention this simply because ‘Climate Change’ is being used as a reason to suggest nuclear power development in Australia – something that I regard as most undesirable and now see as totally unnecessary.\n\nPlease be patient; it took me two days to read through the article and study the many references. It is not trivial. I had hoped to simply include here the url used to download my own pdf but I cannot get it to work again. I have therefore been obliged to copy and paste the pdf, making it less attractive to read. My apologies – it really is worth the struggle though.\n\nOne more comment; I see from comments on the GWPF website that, despite the rigour of the article, some people are still so totally brainwashed that they can only make scathing comments.

Darwall’s Green Tyranny: Exposing the Totalitarian Roots\n\nof the Climate Industrial Complex and Lewin’s Searching for the Catastrophe Signal: The\n\nOrigins of The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change deserve special mention in\n\nthis connection. Booker’s relatively brief monograph asks a rather different but pro-\n\nfoundly important question. Namely, how do otherwise intelligent people come to\n\nbelieve such arrant nonsense despite its implausibility, internal contradictions, con-\n\ntradictory data, evident corruption and ludicrous policy implications. Booker con-\n\nvincingly shows the power of ‘groupthink’ to overpower the rational faculties that we\n\nwould hope could play some role. The phenomenon of groupthink helps explain why\n\nordinary working people are less vulnerable to this defect. After all, the group that the\n\nbelievers want to belong to is that of the educated elite. This may have played a ma-\n\njor role in the election of Donald Trump, which depended greatly on the frustration\n\nof the non-elites (or ‘deplorables’, as Hillary Clinton referred to them) with what they\n\nperceived to be the idiocy of their ‘betters’.\n\nBooker’s emphasis on the situation in the UK is helpful insofar as there is nowhere\n\nthat the irrationality of the response to this issue has been more evident, but the\n\nproblem exists throughout the developed world. The situation everywhere has been\n\nreinforced by the existence of numerous individuals and groups that have profited\n\nmightily from the hysteria (including academia, where funding predicated on sup-\n\nporting alarm has increased by a factor of about 15–20 in the US), but why so many\n\nothers have gone along, despite the obvious disadvantages of doing so, deserves the\n\nattention that Booker provides.\n\nProfessor Lindzen was Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at the Masschusetts Institute of Technology until his retirement in 2013. He is a member of the Academic Advisory Council of GWPF.\n\nAbout the author\n\nChristopher Booker has been writing on climate change and energy issues in the Sun-\n\nday Telegraph and elsewhere over the past 11 years. In 2010 his history of the science\n\nand politics of global warming, The Real Global Warming Disaster: is the obsession with\n\nclimate change turning into one of the most costly scientific blunders in history? was\n\nranked by The Bookseller as one of the UK’s three top best-selling books on the envi-\n\nronment in the previous decade, alongside titles by Al Gore and James Lovelock.\n\nBorn in 1937, he read history at Cambridge and was the founding editor of Private\n\nEye between 1961 and 1963. His other books have included The Neophiliacs: a study of\n\nthe revolution in English life in the Fifties and Sixties (1969), The Seven Basic Plots: why tell stories, a psychological analysis of storytelling (2004), The Great Deception, a history\n\nof the European Union (co-written with Dr Richard North), and Scared to Death: Why\n\nscares are costing us the earth (2007). In 1979 he made an acclaimed BBC television\n\ndocumentary, City of Towers, tracing the crucial influence of Le Corbusier on the post-\n\nwar redevelopment of Britain’s cities.\n\nAuthor’s personal note\n\nHaving now written extensively about the global warming issue for over a decade, I\n\nkick myself that I did not discover the book that inspired this paper until 2014. When\n\nI finally came across Irving Janis’s seminal analysis of ‘groupthink’, I realised just how\n\nmuch more it helped to explain about the story I and many others had been following\n\nfor so long.\n\nIn particular, if I had known about it when in 2009 I published my history of the\n\ngreat alarm over manmade climate change, The Real Global Warming Disaster, it might\n\nhave been a very different book.\n\nHere, more briefly, I look at that story again, brought up to date, but this time\n\nshowing how Janis’s theory adds a whole new dimension to our understanding of\n\none of the most remarkable and puzzling episodes in the history of both science and\n\npolitics.\n\nviii It is only by obtaining some sort of insight into the psychology of crowds that it can\n\nbe understood how powerless they are to hold any opinions other than those\n\nwhich are imposed upon them.\n\nGustave Le Bon, The Crowd\n\nAs long as one is within a certain phenomenology, one is not astonished and no\n\none wonders what it is all about. Such philosophical doubt only comes to one who\n\nis outside the game.\n\nC.G. Jung, Psychology and National Problems\n\nixExecutive summary\n\nBy any measure, the belief that the earth faces an unprecedented threat from ‘human-\n\ninduced climate change’ has been one of the most extraordinary episodes in the his-\n\ntory of either science or politics. It has led scientists and politicians to contemplate\n\nnothing less than a complete revolution in the way mankind sources the energy re-\n\nquired to keep modern industrial civilisation functioning, by phasing out the fossil-\n\nfuels on which that civilisation has been built.\n\nBut for 30 years the way this has all come about has given expert observers cause\n\nfor increasing puzzlement. In particular they have questioned:\n\n• the speed with which the belief that human carbon dioxide emissions were\n\ncausing the world dangerously to warm came to be proclaimed as being shared\n\nby a ‘consensus’ of the world’s climate scientists;\n\n• the nature and reliability of much of the evidence being cited to support that\n\nbelief;\n\n• the failure of global temperatures to rise in accordance with the predictions of\n\nthe computer models on which the ‘consensus’ ultimately rested.\n\nBut there was also the peculiarly hostile and dismissive nature of the response by\n\nsupporters of the ‘consensus’ to those who questioned all this, a group that included\n\nmany eminent scientists and other experts.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to use the scientific insights of a professor of psychol-\n\nogy at Yale back in the 1970s to show the entire story of the alarm over global warm-\n\ning in a remarkable new light. The late Professor Irving Janis analysed what happens\n\nwhen people get caught up in what he termed ‘groupthink’, a pattern of collective\n\npsychological behaviour with three distinctive features, that we can characterise as\n\nrules.\n\n• A group of people come to share a particular view or belief without a proper\n\nappraisal of the evidence.\n\n• This leads them to insist that their belief is shared by a ‘consensus’ of all right-\n\nminded opinion.\n\n• Because their belief is ultimately only subjective, resting on shaky foundations,\n\nthey then defend it only by displaying an irrational, dismissive hostility towards\n\nanyone daring to question it.\n\nThis paper begins by showing how strongly all these three symptoms were in ev-\n\nidence, right from the start, when, in the late 1980s, the belief that a rise in carbon\n\ndioxide levels was causing the earth dangerously to warm was first brought to the\n\nworld’s attention.\n\nIt shows how the rules of groupthink continued to be in evidence when, dur-\n\ning the period around the first report of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\n\nxiChange (IPCC) in 1990 and the Rio ‘Earth Summit’ of 1992, global warming became\n\nadopted as an international scientific and political ‘consensus’.\n\nThe presence of groupthink was confirmed at Kyoto in 1997, when practical steps\n\nwere first agreed to slow down the rise in world temperatures, by means that would\n\nrequire the richer, developed nations of the West to reduce their carbon dioxide emis-\n\nsions, while allowing the still ‘developing’ nations, such as China and India, to con-\n\ntinue increasing them until their economies had caught up with the West. Eventually,\n\nas the paper will show, this division between the West and the rest of the world would\n\nturn out to be the crux of the whole story,\n\nFor some years the ‘consensus’ theory continued to seem plausible, as carbon\n\ndioxide levels and global temperatures continued to rise together, just as the com-\n\nputer models on which the ‘consensus’ relied had predicted. In 1998 temperatures\n\nwere the highest on record, coinciding with an unusually strong El Niño event in the\n\nPacific.\n\nBut then came the ‘hockey stick’ controversy, which first drew charges that, to\n\nmake their case seem more plausible, supporters of the ‘consensus’ – strongly en-\n\ndorsed by the IPCC – were having to manipulate crucial scientific evidence. Their re-\n\nsponse to these allegations was further evidence of Janis’s third rule, that any attempt\n\nto challenge the ‘consensus’ must be ignored, rejected and suppressed.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2007, the ‘consensus’ still seemed to carry all before it, as its\n\nclaims for the threat posed to the planet by global warming became ever more exag-\n\ngerated and extreme, as exemplified in Al Gore’s documentary An Inconvenient Truth\n\nand the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report in 2007.\n\nBut it was at this time that more serious cracks began to appear in the ‘consen-\n\nsus’ case. There had been the continuing failure, since the El Niño year of 1998, of\n\nglobal temperatures to rise as the computer models had predicted: this was what\n\nbecame known as ‘the hiatus’ or ‘the pause’. There were telling examples of how irra-\n\ntionally supporters of the ‘consensus’ had reacted when they were, for the first time,\n\nconfronted by world-ranking scientists who were outside the groupthink.\n\nEven more important, there was the emergence through the internet of a new\n\n‘counter-consensus’, led by technical experts qualified to challenge every scientific\n\nclaim on which the ‘consensus’ relied. It was this which, in accordance with Janis’s\n\nthird rule, prompted supporters of the ‘consensus’ to vilify anyone daring to disagree\n\nwith them as just ‘climate deniers’ who were ‘anti-science’.\n\nIn 2009/2010, the ‘consensus’ suffered its three most damaging blows yet:\n\n• the release of the Climategate emails between the little group of scientists at\n\nthe heart of the IPCC establishment;\n\n• the collapse in Copenhagen of the long-planned bid to agree a new global cli-\n\nmate treaty, again essentially because of a division between developing nations\n\nand the West;\n\nxii• a series of scandals that revealed that the most widely-quoted and alarming\n\nclaims in the 2007 IPCC report had not been based on science at all, but on\n\nclaims made in press releases and false reports put out by climate activists.\n\nOn both the Climategate emails and the IPCC scandals the ‘climate establishment’\n\ndid all it could to hold the line, with a series of supposedly ‘independent’ inquiries\n\nstaged by its supporters. But the damage had been done. Between 2010 and 2014,\n\ndespite efforts by supporters of the ‘consensus’, such as the BBC and the UK Met Office,\n\nto keep the alarm going, it became clear that it was no longer possible to sustain the\n\nhysteria that had reached its climax in the years before Copenhagen.\n\nBut then, as this paper shows, came what amounted to a last throw by the ‘consen-\n\nsus’, with the approach of yet another major global climate conference in Paris in 2015.\n\nThe prelude to this, coinciding with another record El Niño event in 2015/2016, was\n\nsuch a rise in global temperatures as to prompt claims that ‘the pause’ had ended.\n\nBut expert analysts across the world found that wholesale ‘adjustments’ had been\n\nmade to the figures in the main surface temperature records, giving an impression\n\nthat the global temperature trend had been rising much more than was justified by\n\nthe original recorded data.\n\nThen came an event as significant as any since the alarm over global warming had\n\nfirst arisen. Documents supplied by every country before the Paris conference, known\n\nas INDCs, or ‘Intended Nationally Determined Contributions’, set out their intended\n\nfuture energy policies. Buried in technical details, these made clear that, however\n\nmuch the countries of the West might be planning to reduce their ‘carbon’ emissions,\n\nthe rest of the world, led by China and India, was planning by 2030 to build enough\n\nfossil-fuel power stations to increase global emissions by almost 50 percent. China\n\nwas intending to double its emissions, India to triple theirs.\n\nIn other words, the rest of the world had no intention of going along with the de-\n\nclared aim of Paris, to agree on the wholesale ‘decarbonisation’ of the world’s econ-\n\nomy. Yet astonishingly, so lost were developed countries in the groupthink that the\n\nWestern media failed to recognise what was happening.\n\nOne person who did was President Trump who, to the fury of all those still blinded\n\nby the groupthink, gave the refusal of the rest of the world to reduce its carbon diox-\n\nide emissions as his reason for pulling the US out of the Paris Accord (although even\n\nnow this was not picked up by those reporting on his decision in the West).\n\nBefore coming to its conclusions, this paper will briefly summarise some of the\n\nimmense political consequences of the alarm over global warming: the costs and\n\nfutility of the steps being taken, chiefly in the West, to switch from fossil fuels to ‘low-\n\ncarbon’ sources of energy.\n\nThe conclusions then follow, under three headings. The first summarises the na-\n\nture of the groupthink that has for 30 years come to dominate virtually all public dis-\n\ncussion of global warming in the West. The second considers the factors that will\n\nxiiimake it so difficult for the West to escape from this intellectual straitjacket.\n\nBut the final section highlights how the events of the past two years, culminating\n\nin Trump’s rejection of Paris, have in fact been the crux of the whole story. The rest\n\nof the world, led by the fast-growing economies of China and India, has made clear\n\nthat, whatever the West may continue to believe or do, it is carrying on regardless.\n\nThis was what Trump recognised when, in July 2017, he finally called the bluff of one\n\nof the most damaging examples of groupthink the world has ever known. From now\n\non, the story can never be the same again.\n\nxiv1 Introduction\n\nSince we have now been living with the debate on global warming for 30 years, it\n\nmight seem hard to imagine that any wholly new scientific perspective could usefully\n\nbe brought to bear on it. But such is the purpose of this paper, which seeks to use the\n\ninsights of a distinguished former professor of psychology at Yale to show the real\n\nnature of that debate in a startling new light, helping us to understand much that\n\nobservers have long found baffling.\n\nBy any measure, the consequences of the belief that human activity may be caus-\n\ning our planet dangerously to warm have marked it as one of the most extraordinary\n\nepisodes in history. Countless billions of dollars gone into attempts to confirm the\n\ntheory that human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are pos-\n\ning an unprecedented threat to the future of life on Earth. This idea has been found so\n\npersuasive by many of the world’s politicians that they have been prepared to commit\n\nus to spending trillions more on every kind of measure designed to avert that threat.\n\nTheir central aim has been, as they put it, to ‘decarbonise’ the world’s economy.\n\nThey want us to phase out the fossil-fuels on which mankind’s material progress has\n\nbeen based for 200 years, and to rely instead on ‘carbon-free’ sources of energy, such\n\nas ‘renewables’ and nuclear power. Together, they believe, this will bring about such\n\na reduction in human emissions of carbon dioxide that it will have a significant influ-\n\nence on the earth’s climate.\n\nThis, of course, is why the warming thesis has become so hugely important to all\n\nour futures: it has led to the widely accepted view that our planet can only be saved\n\nby a fundamental revolution in the way the human race manages its affairs, based on\n\neliminating precisely those sources of energy on which our modern industrial civili-\n\nsation has been built.\n\nBut there has long been a very serious puzzle at the heart of how the discussion of\n\nall this has unfolded. From the moment these views exploded to the top of the global\n\nagenda in the late 1980s, they might have seemed to carry all before them. But right\n\nfrom the start, a number of reputable scientists found them far from convincing or\n\nwell-founded. Yet so powerful was the momentum behind what had almost imme-\n\ndiately been proclaimed as a ‘consensus’ of scientific opinion that any questioning of\n\nit was swept aside.\n\nOver the years other experts emerged to challenge not just the ‘consensus’ it-\n\nself, but the methods being used to promote it: not least the graphs and predictions\n\nproduced by those computer models which were so central to the case for anthro-\n\npogenic warming. Equally questioned were the methods being adopted by politi-\n\ncians to counter the supposed threat, such as pouring colossal subsidies into new\n\nsources of ‘zero-carbon’ energy.\n\nBut however authoritatively many of these attempts to question the ‘consensus’\n\nwere put, they were automatically dismissed as scarcely worth answering. In other\n\n1words, the most obvious characteristic of the supposed ‘debate’ over climate change\n\nwas that it was never really a debate at all.\n\nThere was never any proper engagement between the two sides, because the\n\nsupporters of the ‘consensus’, who included all the world’s major scientific institutions\n\nand most of the media, simply could not accept that any further discussion was called\n\nfor. Scarcely had the story begun than we were repeatedly told that ‘the science is set-\n\ntled’.\n\nFor many observers, however, there was something very odd about this: not just\n\nthe absence of dialogue between the two sides, but the peculiar hostility shown by\n\nsupporters of the ‘consensus’ towards anyone who did not share their view. This was\n\nnot what might have been expected over what was, on any count, one of the most\n\nsignificant issues of the age. So what might explain it? Was there perhaps some clue in\n\nhuman psychology which might help better to explain the extraordinarily one-sided\n\nnature of this ‘non-debate’?\n\nAt this point, step forward Irving Janis, a professor of psychology at Yale University\n\nin the 1970s, the man who has given us the crucial missing perspective that may allow\n\nus to see this familiar story in a wholly new light.\n\n2\n\nJanis’s theory of groupthink\n\nI use the term ‘groupthink’ as a quick and easy way to refer to a mode of thinking\n\nthat people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when\n\nthe members’ strivings for unanimity override their motivation to realistically\n\nappraise alternative courses of action. Groupthink is a term of the same order as\n\nthe words in the newspeak vocabulary George Orwell presents in his dismaying\n\n1984 – a vocabulary with terms such as ‘doublethink’ and ‘crimethink’. By putting\n\ngroupthink with those Orwellian words, I realise that groupthink takes on an\n\nOrwellian connotation. The invidiousness is intentional, Groupthink refers to a\n\ndeterioration of mental efficiency, reality testing and moral judgment.\n\nIrving Janis, Victims of Groupthink, 1972\n\nJanis’s unique contribution to science lay in his disciplined analysis of what happens\n\nwhen human beings get caught up in an instance of what he called ‘groupthink’. Of\n\ncourse, this is a word now casually used all over the place, to dismiss the shared mind-\n\nset of any group of people with whose opinions one doesn’t agree. And Janis himself\n\ndid not originate the term, which is attributed to William Whyte Jr. in 1952. But Ja-\n\nnis minted it afresh by consciously adapting it from George Orwell’s ‘doublethink’ in\n\nNineteen Eighty-Four. And what made his contribution so valuable was that, in his\n\nbook Victims of Groupthink in 1972 (in a later edition shortened to just Groupthink ), 1\n\n2he showed that there is a scientific structure to the rules by which groupthink consis-\n\ntently operates.\n\nIn fact the only reason why his book is not much better known is that he does not\n\nhimself seem to have been aware of how much more generally relevant his insights\n\nwere than to just the subject of his original study. The subtitle of his book was A Psy-\n\nchological Study of Foreign Policy Decisions and Fiascos, and the examples he used to\n\nillustrate his thesis were all notorious failures of US foreign policy between the 1940s\n\nand the 1960s. These included the failure of America to heed intelligence warnings\n\nof the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in 1941, General McArthur’s fateful decision\n\nto advance into North Korea in 1950, President Kennedy’s backing for the CIA’s disas-\n\ntrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961, and President Johnson’s decision in 1965 to\n\nescalate the war in Vietnam. In a later edition he added President Nixon’s involvement\n\nin the Watergate affair.\n\nBut what Janis more generally showed through each of his carefully researched\n\ncase studies was how this form of collective human psychology operates according\n\nto certain clearly identifiable rules. Janis several times set out lists of the ‘symptoms\n\nof groupthink’, and his lengthy study included much analysis of its other attributes.\n\nBut for our present purpose, we can draw out from his work three characteristics of\n\ngroupthink that are absolutely basic and relevant to our theme. I carefully use here\n\nthe phrase ‘draw out from’ because Janis himself nowhere explicitly states that these\n\nare the three basic rules of groupthink. But they are implicit in his analysis throughout\n\nthe book, and form the core of his theory as to how groupthink operates.\n\n3 The three rules of groupthink\n\nRule one is that a group of people come to share a common view or belief that in some\n\nway is not properly based on reality. They may believe they have all sorts of evidence\n\nthat confirms that their opinion is right, but their belief cannot ultimately be tested\n\nin a way that confirms this beyond doubt. In essence, therefore, it is no more than a\n\nshared belief.\n\nRule two is that, precisely because their shared view cannot be subjected to ex-\n\nternal proof, they then feel the need to reinforce its authority by elevating it into a\n\n‘consensus’, a word Janis himself emphasised. To those who subscribe to the ‘con-\n\nsensus’, the common belief seems intellectually and morally so self-evident that all\n\nright-thinking people must agree with it. The one thing they cannot afford to allow\n\nis that anyone, either within their group or outside it, should question or challenge it.\n\nOnce established, the essence of the belief system must be defended at all costs.\n\nRule three, in some ways the most revealing of all, is a consequence of that in-\n\nsistence that everyone must support the ‘consensus’. The views of anyone who fails\n\nto share it become wholly unacceptable. There cannot be any possibility of dialogue\n\n3with them. They must be excluded from any further discussion. At best they may just\n\nbe marginalised and ignored, at worst they must be openly attacked and discredited.\n\nDissent cannot be tolerated.\n\nJanis showed how consistently and fatally these rules operated in each of his ex-\n\namples. Those caught up in the groupthink rigorously excluded anyone putting for-\n\nward evidence that raised doubts about their ‘consensus’ view. So convinced were\n\nthey of the rightness of their cause that anyone failing to agree with it was aggres-\n\nsively shut out from the discussion. And in each case, because they refused to con-\n\nsider any evidence that suggested that their two-dimensional ‘consensus’ was not\n\nbased on a proper appraisal of reality, it eventually led to disaster.\n\nThe collective refusal to heed intelligence warnings allowed the Japanese to at-\n\ntack Pearl Harbour with impunity. McArthur’s hubristic decision to advance into North\n\nKorea predictably brought China into the war, with deadly results. The reckless ac-\n\nceptance by Kennedy and his little circle of intimate advisers of a crackpot CIA plan\n\nto invade Cuba led inevitably to an embarrassing fiasco. The massive stepping up of\n\nUS forces in Vietnam produced a response that was to suck the US into ten years of\n\nfrustration and a growing nightmare, which only ended with their humiliating with-\n\ndrawal in 1975.\n\nBut Janis then followed this litany of failure with two examples of US foreign policy\n\ninitiatives that provided a complete contrast: the Marshall Plan in the late 1940s and\n\nthe ending of the Cuban missile crisis, which had threatened a new world war in 1962.\n\nHe showed how the difference had been that these initiatives were driven by the very\n\nopposite of groupthink. In each case, those responsible had deliberately canvassed\n\nthe widest range of expert opinion, to ensure that all relevant evidence was brought\n\nto the table. They wanted to explore every possible consequence of what was being\n\nproposed. And in each case the policy was outstandingly successful.\n\nOnce we recognise how these three elements make up the archetypal rules that\n\ndefine the operations of groupthink, we see just how very much more generally they\n\nhave applied, in different guises, all down the ages.\n\nAn obvious example comes in the shape of most forms of organised religion. Reli-\n\ngions are, by definition, ‘belief systems’, which, once established, have tended to be-\n\ncome very markedly intolerant of anyone who does not share them. These outsiders\n\nare therefore condemned as ‘heretics’, ‘infidels’, and ‘unbelievers’. To protect the right-\n\nthinking orthodoxy, they must be marginalised, excluded from mainstream society,\n\npersecuted, even put to death.\n\nAnother obvious instance has been those totalitarian political ideologies, such as\n\ncommunism or Nazism, that likewise showed ruthless intolerance towards ‘subver-\n\nsives’, ‘dissidents’ or anyone not following ‘the party line’ (in the Soviet Union it was\n\ntermed ‘correct thinking’). Again, such people had to be excluded from established\n\nsociety, imprisoned or physically ‘eliminated’.\n\n4Once we recognise this pattern, we can easily identify countless other examples,\n\nlarge and small, throughout history; from the treatment accorded to Galileo for ques-\n\ntioning the Church’s ‘consensus’ that the sun moved round the earth to the hysteria\n\nwhipped up in the USA in the early1950s by McCarthy and the Senate Un-American\n\nActivities Committee, against anyone who could be demonised as a ‘communist’ and\n\ntherefore a traitor.\n\nA perfect fictional depiction of groupthink in action is Hans Christian Andersen’s\n\nstory The Emperor’s New Clothes. When the emperor parades through the streets in\n\nwhat he has been talked into imagining is a dazzling new suit, all his deferential sub-\n\njects acclaim it as handsome beyond compare. Only the little boy points out that the\n\nemperor is not wearing any clothes at all, and is stark naked. And, of course, those\n\ncaught up in the ‘consensus’ all viciously turn on him for pointing out the truth.\n\nIn the epilogue I shall refer briefly to other instances of groupthink that have be-\n\ncome only too familiar in our present-day world. But before we apply Janis’s three\n\nrules to the ‘non-debate’ over global warming, we must also add one more very im-\n\nportant aspect of the way groupthink operates which he didn’t touch on, because it\n\nwasn’t relevant to the particular examples he was analysing.\n\n4 The power of second-hand thinking\n\nGreat power is given to ideas propagated by affirmation, repetition and contagion\n\nby the circumstances that they acquire in time that mysterious force known as\n\n‘prestige’. Whatever has been a ruling power in the world, whether it be ideas or\n\nmen, has in the main enforced its authority by means of that irresistible force we\n\ncall prestige.\n\nGustave Le Bon, The Crowd\n\nJanis was only really concerned with how groupthink affected small groups of peo-\n\nple in charge of US policy at the highest level. But when we come to consider the\n\nstory of the belief in man-made global warming, we are of course looking at how this\n\nwas shared by countless other people: academics, politicians, the media, teachers,\n\nbusiness executives, indeed public opinion in general.\n\nBut all these people only got carried along by the belief that manmade global\n\nwarming was real and dangerous because they had been told it was so by others.\n\nThey accepted as true what they had heard, read or just seen on television without\n\nquestioning it. And this meant that they didn’t really know why they thought why\n\nthey did. They hadn’t thought it necessary to give such a complicated and technical\n\nsubject any fundamental study. They simply echoed what had been passed on to\n\nthem from somewhere else, usually in the form of a few familiar arguments or articles\n\nof belief that were, like approved mantras, endlessly repeated.\n\n5Of course, we all accept a huge proportion of what we believe or think we know\n\nwithout bothering to check the reliability of whatever source we first learned it from,\n\nsuch as the idea that the Earth is 93 million miles from the Sun, or that Tokyo is the\n\ncapital of Japan. We just take on trust that such things are true because everyone else\n\ndoes so, and assume that, if necessary, they can be confirmed by hard evidence.\n\nBut when it came to the belief in man-made global warming, another factor was at\n\nwork, one which always becomes relevant when we are looking at any case of group-\n\nthink. Because this was a wholly new idea, its acceptance rested on how much author-\n\nity could be attributed to those putting it forward, and this was to become a crucial\n\npart of the story.\n\nLong before Janis came up with his theory of groupthink, similar ideas had been\n\nexplored in less scientific form by the French writer Gustave Le Bon, who in 1895 pub-\n\nlished a book called The Crowd. And one of his shrewdest observations was the crucial\n\npart played in changing the opinions of huge numbers of people by ‘prestige’: the\n\nparticular deference paid to those who are taking the lead in putting them forward.\n\nThis was never more evident than in the way the belief in manmade global warm-\n\ning came to win such widespread acceptance. The most obvious example was the\n\nunique prestige accorded to the body known as the UN Intergovernmental Panel on\n\nClimate Change (IPCC). The prestige of the IPCC lay in the fact that it was presented to\n\nthe world as the ultimate objective authority on the state of the earth’s climate, rep-\n\nresenting the views of all the world’s ‘top climate scientists’. If other scientists, politi-\n\ncians, journalists or anyone else wished to make a point about global warming, they\n\nonly had to cite the IPCC as their authority. Its pronouncements were to be treated as\n\ngospel. And even these people borrowed a little of the IPCC’s authority by the very\n\nfact that they were quoting it.\n\nBut how did the IPCC come to be given such unparalleled authority in the first\n\nplace? This becomes highly relevant when we look at how closely the rise of the belief\n\nin global warming and all that followed from it was shaped by Janis’s three basic rules.\n\n5\n\nGlobal warming and the archetype of groupthink\n\nWe start by re-examining how the belief in man-made global warming first came\n\nabout.\n\nRule 1: The creation of a belief-system\n\nOne of the most striking features of this belief was the dramatic suddenness with\n\nwhich it was sprung upon the world. The story began in obscurity in the late 1970s,\n\nwhen a tiny group of international meteorologists, led by Professor Bert Bolin from\n\nSweden, observed that global temperatures, after 30 years of modest decline, were\n\nonce again rising. In fact, Bolin had initially become convinced as far back as the late\n\n61950s that a rise in carbon dioxide must inevitably, thanks to the properties of carbon\n\ndioxide as a greenhouse gas, lead to global warming, at a time when such a theory\n\nwas wholly out of fashion. By the early 1970s, after three decades when global tem-\n\nperatures had been in such decline that many scientists were predicting the approach\n\nof a new ice age, Bolin was regarded as just an eccentrically marginal figure. 2\n\nBut by the late 1970s, he noted that not only were levels of carbon dioxide rising,\n\nso also once again were temperatures. This confirmed for him that the two must be\n\ndirectly connected, the first leading to the second. And the possible consequences\n\nfor the future of mankind, he concluded, were distinctly alarming. 3\n\nWhen, in 1979, Bolin put his case to the first ever ‘World Climate Conference’,\n\nstaged in Geneva under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization (the\n\nWMO), it seemed to his audience so convincing that it was agreed that a further con-\n\nference should be held, at which Bolin’s theory would be top of the agenda.\n\nWhen another meeting took place at Villach, Austria, in 1985, Bolin had prepared\n\na long paper, arguing that the problem of ‘human-induced climate change’ was po-\n\ntentially so serious that it called for urgent global action at the highest level. The\n\nconference endorsed all that Bolin said, and among those who found it particularly\n\npowerful was Dr John Houghton, an evangelical Christian who had formerly been\n\nprofessor of atmospheric physics at Oxford, but who since 1983 had been the head\n\nof the UK Met Office. He was now to become Bolin’s most influential scientific ally.\n\nBut they might still have got nowhere with their cause had they not won an even\n\nmore influential political ally, a very rich but strongly left-wing Canadian business-\n\nman, Maurice Strong. Since his teens, Strong had become convinced that the future\n\nof mankind lay in transforming the UN into a world government. He had also become\n\na very skilful political networker at the highest level. In 1972, thanks to his personal\n\nlinks with the head of the UN, he had been appointed to organise in Stockholm a\n\n‘world conference on the environment’; and this led him to being asked to set up, as\n\nits first head, a new UN agency, the UN Environment Program (UNEP).\n\nIn fact, Strong knew very little about the environment. But he had now come to\n\nsee it as the key to using the UN’s prestige to promote a sweeping left-wing agenda.\n\nHe argued that the natural resources of the earth were the common inheritance of all\n\nmankind, and that the rich Western countries, which had benefited so disproportion-\n\nately from exploiting them, must now be made to fund the poorer countries in the\n\nrest of the world, to help their economies to catch up.\n\nIn 1985, although Strong had by then stepped down as its director, it was UNEP\n\nwhich joined the WMO in sponsoring the Villach climate conference. The meeting\n\nwas chaired by Strong’s like-minded successor as head of UNEP, Dr Mustafa Tolba. In\n\n1987 the two men were able to push their agenda significantly further as members\n\nof the Brundtland Commission, the body that was to put the word ‘sustainable’ into\n\nthe jargon of politicians and officialdom for decades to come. Thanks to their evi-\n\n7dence and citing the recommendations from Villach, the Brundtland report laid par-\n\nticular emphasis on the dangers of ‘human-induced climate change’, warning that this\n\ncould raise global temperatures to such a level that it would have serious effects on\n\nagriculture, ‘raise sea levels, flood coastal cities and disrupt national economies’. The\n\nreport therefore called for a major global effort to curb emissions of carbon dioxide\n\nand other greenhouse gases.\n\nIn the same year, Strong played a key behind-the-scenes role in organising the\n\nconference in his native Canada that produced the Montreal Protocol, the first global\n\ntreaty to ‘protect the environment’, that succeeded in phasing out the use of CFCs,\n\nthe chemicals thought to be destroying the ozone layer. This process enabled Strong\n\nto see that, in global warming, he had found an even more powerful theme on which\n\nto push his long-time political agenda. And in the landmark year of 1988 everything\n\nseemed suddenly to be coming together.\n\nFirst, on a stiflingly hot July day in Washington that summer, a Senate committee\n\nheard a cleverly stage-managed rallying cry by another recent convert to the global\n\nwarming cause, James Hansen, who, as head of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space\n\nStudies (GISS), was in charge of one of the world’s key official temperature records.\n\nThe US media had been briefed to be present in force at this hearing, chaired by\n\nSenator Tim Wirth and including among the members of its committee, Senator Al\n\nGore. The journalists were promised that they would hear something pretty sensa-\n\ntional. Hansen’s wildly alarmist predictions that the world was heading for a global\n\nArmageddon duly made lurid headlines across USA and beyond, including cover sto-\n\nries in Time and Newsweek. Wirth and Hansen had certainly pulled off quite a coup in\n\nraising the threat of global warming to the top of the media agenda.\n\nQuite separately, however, in November that year in Geneva, took place the in-\n\naugural meeting of a new body, jointly sponsored by WMO and UNEP: the IPCC. Al-\n\nthough it was to be sold to the world as an impartial body of world scientists, the\n\nIPCC was never intended by those who set it up to be anything of the kind. The two\n\nmen more than any responsible for this were Bolin, appointed as its first chairman,\n\nand Houghton, chosen to chair ‘Working Group I’, which would contribute the all-\n\nimportant section on the science of climate change when the IPCC came to compile\n\nits first report. Not only were both men totally committed to the belief in ‘human in-\n\nduced climate change’, so were almost all the lesser mortals round the table at that\n\nfirst IPCC meeting, representing 34 nations, as can be seen from the statements each\n\nsubmitted on behalf of their respective governments. 4 Within just two years, it was\n\nproposed, the IPCC would present its first ‘assessment report’, in which the key in-\n\ngredient would be computer models programmed to determine the extent to which\n\nrising levels of carbon dioxide would warm the world. 5\n\nWhen this First Assessment Report appeared in 1990, the global headlines were\n\nled by a claim in its ‘Summary for Policymakers’ that the IPCC was ‘confident that the\n\n8increase in CO 2 alone’ had been responsible for ‘more than half the world’s recent\n\nwarming’ and that this would ‘require immediate reductions in emissions from hu-\n\nman activities of over 60 percent’.\n\n‘Based on current models’, the Summary predicted that, unless drastic action was\n\ntaken, global temperatures would increase through the 21st century by up to 0.5 ◦ C\n\nevery decade, an increase far greater than anything ‘seen in the past 10,000 years’.\n\nAlthough in the previous 100 years temperatures had increased by 0.6 ◦ C, the models\n\nwere now predicting the possibility of a not dissimilar increase every ten years. But\n\nthe Summary for Policymakers was drafted by Houghton himself. And a look at the\n\nhundreds of pages which it was purporting to summarise showed a rather different\n\npicture. Some of the scientists responsible for them had come to very much more\n\ncautious, if not contradictory conclusions. One passage, for instance, admitted that:\n\n…global warming of a larger size has almost certainly occurred at least once since\n\nthe last glaciation without any appreciable increase in greenhouse gases… [and]\n\nbecause we do not understand the reasons for these past warming events, it is\n\nnot possible to attribute a specific proportion of the recent, smaller warming to\n\nan increase in greenhouse gases.\n\nBut it was Houghton’s alarmist gloss on the actual findings of the report that, as was\n\nintended, caught the attention of the world’s media and politicians. And this was just\n\nwhat was wanted by their ally Strong, who was even now preparing for the unprece-\n\ndented spectacular he planned to stage in Rio de Janeiro two years later.\n\nThe so-called ‘Earth Summit’, which Strong organised and chaired in Rio in 1992,\n\nwas easily the largest conference the world had ever seen. It was attended by 108\n\nworld leaders, ranging from Cuba’s Fidel Castro to a rather more reluctant US Presi-\n\ndent George Bush Sr, along with 20,000 other official delegates. Also present in Rio\n\nwere 20,000 climate activists and members of green lobby groups, all paid for out of\n\nUN and government funds, as arranged by Strong himself. He masterminded every\n\ndetail of this extraordinary gathering, and ensured that it would set up a Framework\n\nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to guide the advance to a global ‘climate\n\npolicy’.\n\nIt was planned that in 1997 the UNFCCC would stage another mega-conference\n\nin Kyoto, where the nations of the world would sign a treaty agreeing to make drastic\n\ncuts in carbon dioxide emissions. Or, to be more precise, in accordance with Strong’s\n\nreal long-term agenda, this treaty would commit the ‘developed’ countries of the\n\nWest to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions (since they were considered chiefly\n\nresponsible for the problem), while paying out huge sums to the still-developing na-\n\ntions in the rest of the world, including China and India, to assist their economies to\n\ncatch up with the West.\n\nFor the tiny handful of meteorologists who, in the mid-1980s, had been discussing\n\nhow to get politicians to accept that global warming was a serious threat, all this\n\n9amounted to an amazing coup. In just four short years they had raised it to the top of\n\nthe world’s political agenda. The first world leader to come on board in 1988 had been\n\nBritain’s prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, who had been converted to the cause by\n\nthe UK’s ambassador to the UN, Crispin Tickell. He had won her over not least by cit-\n\ning Hansen’s evidence to the Senate committee. And she had then given enthusiastic\n\nbacking to John Houghton in his plans to set up the IPCC, and the funding to create\n\na new department of his UK Met Office, the Hadley Centre for Climate Change (later\n\nto become the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research). This would be re-\n\nsponsible, with the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia, for\n\nanother of what became the world’s four main global temperature records. 6\n\nIn America, the most prominent politician now totally committed to the cause was\n\nSenator Al Gore from Tennessee; a member of that Senate committee in 1988, who\n\nwas about to become US vice-president under Bill Clinton.\n\nIn Brussels in October 1991, the European Community (shortly to become the Eu-\n\nropean Union) had acclaimed the IPCC report for showing how, for the first time, there\n\nwas now ‘a consensus among scientists on the possible impact and risks of the green-\n\nhouse effect’. This came in a long document setting out A Community Strategy to Limit\n\nCarbon Dioxide Emissions, proposing a Europe-wide conversion to renewable energy.\n\nAll in all, it was clear that the need to ‘combat climate change’ was very much an\n\nidea whose time had come. But in light of the first step in Janis’s three-stage analy-\n\nsis, we must note that, even then, the scientific base for the theory of the ‘true be-\n\nlievers’ was in no way as secure as they pretended. The only ‘proof’ that they were\n\nright lay in the projections of those computer models, specifically programmed to\n\nassume that rising carbon dioxide was the most important factor driving global tem-\n\nperatures and therefore changes to the climate. Politically, they had certainly made\n\nastonishing progress. But, as was shown by the way Houghton had needed to ‘sex\n\nup’ his Summary for Policymakers, they were still having to push pretty hard to make\n\ntheir case seem as watertight as they would have liked. And it was already becom-\n\ning very evident that those who supported their cause were having to move on to\n\nthe second stage of the Janis rules, by insisting whenever possible that the case for\n\n‘human-induced climate change’ was now accepted by a ‘consensus’ of the world’s\n\nscientists.\n\n10Rule 2: Creating the illusion of a ‘consensus’\n\nOnly an insignificant fraction of scientists deny the global warming crisis. The time\n\nfor debate is over. The science is settled.\n\nAl Gore, 1992\n\nOne eminent scientist very much not part of the ‘consensus’ was Dr Richard Lindzen,\n\nthe Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-\n\nnology and one of America’s most respected atmospheric physicists. In 1992 he pub-\n\nlished a long informal paper entitled ‘Global warming: the origin and nature of the\n\nalleged scientific consensus’, the theme of which was the extraordinary pressure that\n\nhad built up in the late 1980s to create the impression that global warming was sup-\n\nported by an overwhelming ‘consensus’ of scientific opinion. He began by recalling a\n\nletter he had received in 1988 from a respected professor of economics named Lester\n\nLave, who had been one of the other witnesses called before the 1988 Senate com-\n\nmittee at which James Hansen had spoken so dramatically.\n\nUnlike Hansen, Lave had told the senators that the global warming hypothesis\n\nwas still ‘controversial’, that by no means all scientists were agreed on it, and that the\n\nscience was still very uncertain as to what the causes of climate change might be.\n\nSenator Gore expressed vehement irritation at this, claiming that anyone who said\n\nsuch a thing couldn’t know what he was talking about, and suggesting that there\n\nwas no point in the senators hearing any more of Professor Lave’s evidence. 7\n\nLave had been so surprised to be dismissed by the committee in such summary\n\nfashion that he had written to Lindzen, as one of America’s most distinguished clima-\n\ntologists, to ask whether he had got it wrong. Lindzen confirmed that the case for\n\nglobal warming was not only ‘controversial’ but also, in his view, ‘implausible’. 8\n\nTwo years later, when the IPCC produced its first report, as Lindzen described,\n\nhe had found it as a scientist deeply disturbing. He too had been shocked by the\n\nway Houghton’s Summary for Policymakers had largely ignored the ‘uncertainty’ ex-\n\npressed in parts of the report itself, by attempting ‘to present the expectation of sub-\n\nstantial warming as firmly based science’. 9 Indeed this had essentially been confirmed\n\nby Houghton himself, admitting that:\n\n…whilst every attempt was made by the lead authors to incorporate their com-\n\nments, in some cases these formed a minority opinion which could not be rec-\n\nonciled with the larger consensus. 10\n\nBut Lindzen’s chief objections to the report were based on the area of science in which\n\nhe himself had unrivalled expertise. He noted that the IPCC’s predictions of future\n\ntemperatures and climate behaviour were all based on computer models. And what\n\nparticularly struck him was that the programming of these models was much too sim-\n\nplistic. By giving pole position to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as the\n\n11main ‘forcing’ ingredient in driving future temperatures, and by failing to allow for\n\nother natural influences on climate, their findings were demonstrably misleading.\n\nIn particular, observed Lindzen, the models overlooked or seriously misjudged\n\nthe part played by far the most important greenhouse gas of all, water vapour, which\n\nmakes up more than 90 percent of their total volume. They also failed to allow for\n\nthe effect of the increased cloud-cover that would result from the greater humidity\n\ncaused by warming of the oceans. Each of these effects would lessen the impact of\n\nglobal warming. Account for them properly in the models, he argued, and it would\n\nbe seen that the ‘greenhouse effect’ caused by rising carbon dioxide levels had been\n\nwildly overstated. What was more, this could be demonstrated by running those\n\nsame computer models retrospectively, to show where, if they were right, temper-\n\natures should have been throughout the 20th century. It became glaringly obvious\n\nthat these crudely over-simplified programmes failed to explain the actual variations\n\nthat had taken place in 20th century temperature levels. In the 1920s and 1930s,\n\nwhen carbon dioxide emissions were comparatively low, temperatures had sharply\n\nrisen. But in the very years when emissions were rising much more steeply, between\n\n1940 and the 1970s, temperatures had fallen back, in what became known to clima-\n\ntologists as the ‘Little Cooling’. In fact, the assumptions on which the models were\n\nbased, said Lindzen, would have led them to predict a 20th century warming four\n\ntimes greater than that actually recorded (with most of the rise taking place before\n\natmospheric carbon dioxide had reached anything like its present level). On this ba-\n\nsis, how could any trust now be placed in their pretended ability to estimate future\n\nrises? As Lindzen bluntly put it, the models had ‘neither the physics nor the numerical\n\naccuracy to come up with findings which were not ‘disturbingly arbitrary’.\n\nBut even though this confirmed why Lindzen found the IPCC’s case for future\n\nwarming ‘implausible’ and seriously exaggerated, his lengthy paper on the nature of\n\nthe supposed ‘consensus’ in fact ranged very much wider. In particular, he focussed\n\non both the remarkable degree to which the notion of a ‘consensus’ had been used\n\nto dominate public debate and also the extraordinary pressure brought to bear to\n\nensure that anyone daring to question it was marginalised.\n\nFor a start, it had been notable how quickly other influential interest groups had\n\nrushed to join the cause. He described, for instance, how fervently global warming\n\nhad been taken up by the leading environmental campaigning organisations, such\n\nas Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the WWF. These pressure groups, which had\n\noriginally emerged out of the ‘environmental awakening’ of the 1960s, had now at-\n\ntained very considerable status and influence as ‘non-governmental organisations’\n\n(NGOs).\n\nThe chief original target of all these campaigning groups had been the need to\n\nsave the world from the ‘threat’ posed by nuclear weapons and nuclear power sta-\n\ntions. 11 But with remarkable unanimity, as the Cold War came to an end, they had\n\n12all suddenly switched the focus of their attention to this new threat to the planet. As\n\nLindzen put it:\n\n…these lobbying groups have budgets of several million dollars and employ about\n\n50,000 people. Their support is highly valued by many political figures. As with\n\nany large groups, self-perpetuation becomes a crucial concern. ‘Global warming’\n\nhas become one of the major battle cries in their fundraising efforts. At the same\n\ntime, the media unquestioningly accept the pronouncements of these groups as\n\nobjective truth.\n\nIn March 1989 the main NGOs had formed an umbrella organisation, the Climate Ac-\n\ntion Network, to co-ordinate their campaigning on global warming. This shadowy\n\nbody was to be used by Strong in 1992 to co-ordinate his recruiting of the 20,000\n\nactivists who attended his Rio summit.\n\nAt the same time, another such group, the Union of Concerned Scientists, which\n\nhad also originally been formed to campaign on nuclear issues, organised a petition\n\nurging the recognition of global warming as potentially the greatest danger faced by\n\nmankind. The eventual list of 700 signatories, including Nobel prizewinners and many\n\nmembers of the National Academy of Sciences, seemed hugely impressive. But ‘only\n\nabout three or four’ of them, according to Lindzen, were qualified climate scientists.\n\nAt the 1990 meeting of the National Academy, its president, referring specifically\n\nto this petition, went out of his way to warn members against ‘lending their credibil-\n\nity to issues about which they had no special knowledge’. 12 His warning was to be\n\nconspicuously ignored.\n\nLindzen also recalled how quickly the new cause had become fashionable among\n\nleading figures in showbusiness, such as the Hollywood actors Robert Redford, Bar-\n\nbra Streisand and Meryl Streep, all of whom made much-publicised calls, in Redford’s\n\nwords, for people to stop just ‘researching’ the warming threat and to ‘begin acting’\n\n(which, as Lindzen wryly observed, was not an unreasonable thing for an actor to\n\nsuggest).\n\nAlso now becoming obvious, however, was just how much new money was now\n\nbecoming available for research into climate change. Even though in 1989 President\n\nGeorge Bush Sr’s senior White House advisers had initially been sceptical on the issue,\n\nso great now was political pressure that in 1989 they authorised a staggering increase\n\nin the federal budget for climate change research. Over the next four years this was\n\nto increase from just $134 million to a total of $2.8 billion. 13\n\nBut, as Lindzen noted, it had soon become clear that any proposals deemed likely\n\nto be at all ambivalent over global warming were highly unlikely to be accepted. He\n\nrecalled how, in the winter of 1989, the National Science Foundation had withdrawn\n\nfunding from one of his MIT colleagues, Professor Reginald Newell, when his data\n\nanalyses failed to show that the previous century had seen a net warming (one re-\n\nviewer suggested that his results were ‘dangerous to humanity’). 14\n\n13This was an indication of just how ruthless the pressure had become to shut any\n\ncritics of the ‘consensus’ out of the debate. When Lindzen himself submitted a critique\n\nof the global warming thesis to Science, the journal of the American Association for\n\nthe Advancement of Science, his article was rejected as being of ‘no interest’ to its\n\nreadership. But, to his astonishment, Science then proceeded to attack his paper even\n\nthough it had not been published.\n\nAlthough the article eventually appeared in the Bulletin of the American Meteoro-\n\nlogical Society, its editor made ‘a determined effort to solicit rebuttals’, including one\n\nthat was an attack on Lindzen by Stephen Schneider, a scientist who in the 1970s had\n\nbeen a prominent supporter of the belief that the world might be heading for a new\n\nice age, but was now one of the leading advocates of warming.\n\nThe letters the paper aroused from the Bulletin’s readers, however, were predomi-\n\nnantly sceptical of the case for anthropogenic warming. Indeed, a subsequent Gallup\n\npoll of climate scientists belonging to the American Meteorological Society and the\n\nAmerican Physical Union showed that no fewer than 49 percent rejected it. Only 18\n\npercent thought that some warming was caused by man, while 33 percent were ‘don’t\n\nknows’.\n\nLindzen noted how a number of the scientists participating in the IPCC report had\n\n…testified to the pressure put on them to emphasise results supportive of the\n\ncurrent scenario and to suppress other results. That pressure has frequently been\n\neffective, and a survey of participants reveals substantial disagreement with the\n\nfinal report. 15\n\n‘Why, one might wonder’, Lindzen asked, was ‘there such insistence on scientific una-\n\nnimity on the warming issue’? After all, he observed,\n\n…unanimity in science is virtually non-existent on far less complex matters. Una-\n\nnimity on an issue as uncertain as ‘global warming’ would be surprising and sus-\n\npicious. Moreover, why are the opinions of scientists sought regardless of their\n\nfield of expertise? Biologists and physicians are rarely asked to endorse some\n\ntheory in high-energy physics. Apparently, when one comes to ‘global warm-\n\ning’, any scientist’s agreement will do.\n\nThe supporters of the ‘consensus’ were now clearly becoming impatient of anyone\n\nwho dared question their orthodoxy. This takes us on to the final stage of Janis’s three\n\nrules of groupthink: the ruthless way in which a ‘consensus’ must be defended against\n\nanyone who disagrees with it. This is necessary for upholders of the ‘consensus’, not\n\nonly in propaganda terms, showing a wider audience how any critics can safely be ig-\n\nnored, but in psychological terms, by reinforcing their own belief that the ‘consensus’\n\nis unquestionably right.\n\n14Rule 3: Putting ‘non-believers’ beyond the pale\n\nOnce Lindzen’s sceptical views had become known, as he described in his paper, he\n\nhad been singled out for venomous attack, even in books, such as World on Fire: Sav-\n\ning an Endangered Earth, published in 1991 by George Mitchell, the Democrats’ ma-\n\njority leader in the Senate. In fact Lindzen was far from alone in being given such\n\ntreatment. He and other ‘climate sceptics’ were now being regularly subjected to dis-\n\nmissive ridicule in the press, as in an article in the New York Times by Al Gore, in which,\n\nby somewhat ironic projection, he compared those who shared his views to Galileo,\n\nbravely standing for the truth against the intolerant consensus of his time.\n\nBut just how vicious in suppressing criticism the supporters of the ‘consensus’ had\n\nbecome was illustrated by the fate of two other eminent scientists who had also pub-\n\nlicly shown that they did not subscribe to the ‘consensus’. In the summer of 1992,\n\nAl Gore, by now the leading political crusader on global warming in America, was\n\nbidding to become the Democrat Party’s candidate for vice-president. As part of his\n\ncampaign he published a book, Earth in the Balance, claiming that global warming\n\nwas ‘the worst threat we have ever faced’. 16\n\nGore paid glowing tribute to the man who had first alerted him to this threat when\n\nhe was at Harvard in the mid-1960s: the distinguished oceanographer, Roger Revelle.\n\nBack in the 1950s, as head of a department at the University of California in San Diego,\n\nRevelle had been behind the setting up of the research station on top of the Hawai-\n\nian volcano Mauna Loa that measures the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n\nWhen the data had shown that these were steadily rising, it was this more than any-\n\nthing else that helped to set the great alarm over global warming on its way.\n\nWhen Gore wrote his book in 1992, he seemed unaware that, although Revelle\n\nhad recognised a possible connection between greenhouse gases and global tem-\n\nperatures, he had long been taking a very much more cautious view on global warm-\n\ning than that now being championed by Gore himself. In July 1988, after Hansen\n\nmade headlines with his testimony to Wirth’s Senate committee, Revelle had written\n\nto a member of Congress:\n\nMost scientists familiar with the subject are not yet willing to bet that the climate\n\nthis year is the result of ‘greenhouse warming’. As you very well know, climate is\n\nhighly variable from year to year, and the causes of these variations are not at\n\nall well understood. My own personal belief is that we should wait another ten\n\nor twenty years to really be convinced that the greenhouse effect is going to be\n\nimportant for human beings, in both positive and negative ways. 17\n\nFour days later Revelle had written to Wirth himself, cautioning that:\n\n…we should be careful not to arouse too much alarm until the rate and amount\n\nof warming becomes clearer. It is not yet obvious that this summer’s hot weather\n\nand drought are the result of a global climatic change or simply an example of\n\n15the uncertainties of climate variability. My own feeling is that we had better wait\n\nanother ten years before making confident predictions. 18\n\nIn 1990, at a conference of the American Association for the Advancement of Science,\n\nRevelle was approached by an old friend, Dr Fred Singer, then professor of environ-\n\nmental science at the University of Virginia, but who, back in the 1960s, had worked\n\nwith NASA to design and set up, as its first director, the US National Satellite Weather\n\nService. The two men discussed writing an informal paper together on global warm-\n\ning, which Singer went on to draft for submission to a small-circulation journal called\n\nCosmos. When he and Revelle met to discuss the proofs, they agreed several amend-\n\nments, and the article was published in April 1991. It was entitled ‘What to do about\n\ngreenhouse warming: look before you leap’. Their main argument, echoing the views\n\nthat Revelle had expressed earlier in his letters to the members of Congress, was that:\n\nDrastic, precipitous, and especially unilateral steps to delay the putative green-\n\nhouse impacts can cost jobs and prosperity and increase the human costs of\n\nglobal poverty without being effective. Stringent economic controls now would\n\nbe economically devastating particularly for developing countries. . . ’\n\nThey concluded that:\n\n…the scientific base for a greenhouse warming is too uncertain to justify drastic\n\naction at this time.\n\nThe article attracted little attention and three months later, professionally active to\n\nthe end of his life, Revelle died aged 82. Later that year, however, Singer was invited\n\nto contribute to a book on global warming and suggested that their article be repub-\n\nlished.\n\nThe following summer of 1992, when Al Gore was running hard to win the vice-\n\npresidential nomination, the New Republic picked up on the contrast between the\n\nreferences to Revelle in his new book and the views expressed in the article he had co-\n\nauthored with Singer. 19 This was prominently reported elsewhere in the media and,\n\nafter Gore won the nomination, was even raised in a televised election debate. Gore’s\n\nresponse was not only to protest that Revelle’s views in the article had been ‘taken\n\ncompletely out of context’, but to use one of his close associates, Dr Justin Lancaster of\n\nHarvard, to ask Singer to remove Revelle’s name from the article. This was somewhat\n\nimpractical, since it had already been published.\n\nHowever, Lancaster persisted in his efforts, not only claiming that Revelle had not\n\nreally been a co-author of the article and that his name had only been included ‘over\n\nhis objections’, but even suggesting that Singer must have been pressuring a sick old\n\nman whose mental capacities were failing.\n\nWhen, after Gore had become US vice-president, Lancaster repeated his charges,\n\nSinger in April 1993 sued him for libel. And this led to a remarkable revelation. When\n\nthe two sides exchanged documents, it emerged that it was Gore who had particu-\n\nlarly pressed Lancaster about Revelle’s mental state towards the end of his life: hence\n\n16Lancaster’s suggestions that Singer had been quite improperly exploiting Revelle’s\n\nloss of his faculties.\n\nBut Lancaster was now prepared to agree that Revelle had in fact been ‘mentally\n\nsharp to the end’. He also admitted that Revelle had shown him the article before it\n\nwas published, with the comment that there did not seem to be anything in it that\n\n‘was not true’. 20\n\nIn February 1994, an ABC News presenter, Ted Koppel, revealed on his Nightline\n\nprogramme that Vice President Gore had rung him in person, suggesting that he\n\nshould expose the sinister political and economic forces behind what he called the\n\n‘anti-environmental movement’. Gore had in particular urged him to expose the fact\n\nthat Singer and other scientists who had voiced sceptical views about global warming\n\nwere receiving money from the coal industry and other fossil-fuel interests.\n\nSuch charges were already becoming an all-too familiar feature of the debate.\n\nAnyone daring to express doubts about the ‘consensus’ might now face accusations\n\nthat they could only be expressing these views because they had been paid to do\n\nso by energy firms, ‘Big Oil’ or even the tobacco industry. 21 But when Koppel called\n\nGore’s bluff by reporting the call from the vice-president on air, this attempt to use a\n\nleading news programme to discredit his opponents provoked such political embar-\n\nrassment that, shortly afterwards, Lancaster settled his case with Singer by issuing a\n\nfull retraction and apology. 22\n\nThis sorry episode was a further graphic illustration of how those caught up in any\n\nform of groupthink are likely to respond to anyone who doesn’t agree with them. As\n\nJanis showed, because the only evidence they are willing to recognise is that which\n\nconfirms their own mindset, anyone who dissents must be discredited, stereotyped\n\nand caricatured as only doing so from some ignoble motive.\n\nRather than attempting to address the points dissenters are raising, these are rou-\n\ntinely countered by ad-hominem attacks on their character. Some dark reason must\n\nbe found to explain why such people should not be listened to, such as suggesting\n\nthat they are only questioning the ‘consensus’ because they are being paid to do so.\n\nBut such propaganda tactics can only be effective so long as the illusory ‘consen-\n\nsus’ continues to hold the moral high ground.\n\n176\n\nThe ‘idea whose time had come’\n\nIn searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution,\n\nthe threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the\n\nbill. . . all these dangers are caused by human intervention…the real enemy then is\n\nhumanity itself.\n\nThe First Global Revolution, Report by the Club of Rome, 1991 23\n\nSo far, we have looked in some detail at how the origins of this belief system provide\n\na perfect case study in the workings of groupthink, by demonstrating how all the\n\nthree stages of this archetypal pattern so quickly emerged from the very start of the\n\nglobal warming story. We shall shortly follow that story in a more summary form,\n\nlooking at just some of the more conspicuous examples of how consistently Janis’s\n\nrules continued to shape it over the years to come. But first we must briefly consider\n\ntwo of the deeper psychological reasons why the global warming ‘narrative’ had so\n\nwidely and rapidly taken hold in the late 1980s, as an ‘idea whose time had come’.\n\nThe first reason was the profound shift in collective consciousness that had taken\n\nplace in the late 1950s and 1960s, giving rise to what became known as ‘environ-\n\nmentalism’ and the ‘environmental movement’. This was the awareness that, for the\n\nfirst time in history, science had given mankind the power to destroy all life on earth.\n\nObviously, the supreme expression of this idea was the fearful shadow cast by the\n\npossibility of nuclear war. With the Cold War, the world was divided between two\n\ngreat camps, each armed with missiles carrying hydrogen bombs, capable not just of\n\nimmediate catastrophic destruction but of spreading radioactivity so widely that it\n\nmight render large parts of the planet uninhabitable.\n\nBut this realisation also coincided with a new awareness of the damage mankind\n\nwas already inflicting on nature and the natural environment, through toxic chemi-\n\ncals, the methods of modern agriculture, the ever-growing pollution of the seas by\n\nindestructible plastic wastes, the pressures of over-population and the evidence that\n\nso many species seemed now to be threatened by human activity with extinction.\n\nIn 1958 these fears had had given rise to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament,\n\nin 1961 to the founding of WWF and in 1962 to Rachel Carson’s hugely best-selling\n\nSilent Spring on the threat posed to wildlife by pesticides. By the end of the 1960s it\n\nhad led to the launching of the two most influential of all environmental campaigning\n\ngroups, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, both initially focused on the nuclear\n\nthreat.\n\nNo image caught the new mood of the time better than ‘Earthrise’, the picture\n\nof the soft blue Earth taken in 1968 from the Apollo 11 space mission, widely inter-\n\npreted as showing how vulnerable the earth had become to the destructive powers\n\nof humanity as ‘the only planet we’ve got’.\n\n18In 1972 came that first ‘World Environment Conference’, organised for the UN and\n\nshaped according to his own political agenda by Maurice Strong. In the same year,\n\nthe Club of Rome’s The Limits to Growth report, selling 37 million copies worldwide,\n\nused a computer model to show how population growth would soon outrun food\n\nproduction and natural resources, to threaten the survival of civilisation.\n\nAll this had created a mindset and a narrative which, by casting humanity as its\n\nown worst enemy, as ‘the cuckoo in the nest of creation’, was perfectly fitted by the\n\nlate 1980s to take on board this great new scare story: that, quite apart from all the\n\nother threats mankind was posing to the future of the planet, conceivably the worst\n\n(apart of course from a nuclear holocaust) was the possibility that runaway global\n\nwarming created by human emissions of greenhouse gases might lead to the de-\n\nstruction of all life on earth.\n\nThis was why, as the Cold War came to an end, with the sudden collapse of the So-\n\nviet communist empire removing the fear of nuclear war almost overnight, those en-\n\nvironmental groups that had been founded on their opposition to nuclear weapons\n\nand nuclear power, were able to morph seamlessly into seeing the need to fight the\n\nthreat of man-made global warming as their new great cause. They were also joined\n\nin this by WWF, on the grounds that global warming was a serious new addition to its\n\nprime purpose, to fight for species threatened with extinction.\n\nThe key to the success of the new cause was precisely that it made such an appeal\n\nto the moral sense. Those caught up in it were convinced that they were supporting\n\nthe ‘good guys’ in wanting to ‘save the planet’ from a quite unprecedented catastro-\n\nphe. But they were thus fitting into a very ancient and archetypal pattern of collective\n\nhuman psychology. Ever since the biblical story of Noah, history (or myth) had been\n\nfull of episodes where it was believed that mankind was facing some immense dis-\n\naster that threatened the end of the world. Common to all such millennial scenarios\n\nwas the conviction that this would be a punishment for the wickedness of the human\n\nrace in having taken a morally wrong turning. And a very powerful part of the appeal\n\nof this particular narrative was that it divided the world into the ‘bad guys’ who had\n\nset humanity on course for disaster by persuading it down the primrose path of de-\n\npendence on those evil fossil fuels, and the ‘good guys’ who had finally woken up to\n\nhow dangerously mistaken this had been. By joining this new holy cause, one was\n\nchoosing to side with ‘life’ rather than continuing blindly on a course which would\n\notherwise bring death to all life on earth – unless humanity could be persuaded to\n\nwake up in time, and to take the very drastic actions that alone could bring salvation.\n\nIf any form of groupthink relies on a conviction that it holds the moral high ground,\n\nthe ‘consensus’ over global warming was about to face its own first real moral chal-\n\nlenge. This was when, for the first time, a serious scandal came to light over the inner\n\nworkings of its most prestigious authority, the IPCC.\n\n197\n\nThe IPCC breaks its own rules: the ‘consensus’\n\nsurvives its first major scandal\n\nThe members’ firm belief in the morality of their group and their use of\n\nundifferentiated stereotypes of their opponents would enable them to minimise\n\nconflicts between ethical values and expediency. . . ‘Since our group’s objectives\n\nare good’, the members feel, ‘any means we decide to use must be good’ . . . Shared\n\nnegative stereotypes that feature the evil nature of the enemy would enhance their\n\nsense of moral righteousness and their pride in the lofty mission of the in-group.\n\nIrving Janis, Groupthink\n\nIf the IPCC is incapable of following its most basic procedures, it would be best to\n\nabandon the entire IPCC process, or at least that part that is concerned with the\n\nscientific evidence on climate change, and look for more reliable sources of advice\n\non this important question.\n\nProfessor Frederick Seitz, former President of the National Academy of Sciences 24\n\nThe scandal erupted in 1996, following the publication of the IPCC’s Second Assess-\n\nment Report, although on this occasion it had been decided to issue the Summary for\n\nPolicymakers some time before the release of the full report. One sentence in it had\n\ncaught worldwide headlines. It claimed that ‘the balance of evidence suggests that\n\nthere is a discernible human influence on global climate’. And the source for this was\n\ngiven as Chapter 8 of the Working Group 1 report. Sure enough, when the full report\n\ndid finally appear, a similar sentence was discovered buried away in its hundreds of\n\npages.\n\nBut no one was more surprised by this than several of the scientific contributors\n\nto those same pages, who had earlier signed off the text as an accurate record of\n\nwhat they had agreed. These now much-quoted words had not appeared in the draft\n\nthey formally approved at a meeting in Madrid in November 1995 (also attended by\n\n177 government delegates from 96 countries and 14 NGO representatives). 25 Partic-\n\nularly odd was that the only sources cited for the new wording were two papers co-\n\nauthored by one of the lead authors on this part of the report: a scientist employed\n\nby the US government named Ben Santer. In clear breach of one of the IPCC’s strictest\n\nrules, these two cited papers had not even yet been published.\n\nWhat astonished the scientists even more, however, was to discover that no less\n\nthan 15 key statements from their agreed text had been deleted. And each of these\n\nhad expressed serious doubt over the human contribution to global warming. They\n\nincluded, for instance, such statements as:\n\nNone of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute\n\nthe observed changes to the specific cause of increases in greenhouse gases.\n\n20and\n\nNo study to date has positively attributed all or part (of the climate change ob-\n\nserved) to (man-made) causes.\n\nThis all seemed so irregular that, a week after the full report appeared, the Wall Street\n\nJournal published a devastating article headed ‘Major deception on global warming’,\n\nby one of the most respected scientists in America, Professor Frederick Seitz, a for-\n\nmer president of the National Academy of Sciences. 26 Seitz quoted some of the 15\n\npassages that had been so damningly deleted, thundering that:\n\nIn my more than 60 years as a member of the American scientific community,\n\nincluding service as president of both the National Academy of Sciences and the\n\nAmerican Physical Society, I have never witnessed a more disturbing corruption\n\nof the peer-review process than the events which led up to this IPCC report.\n\n‘The major responsibility’ for what had happened, he suggested, must lie with the\n\nlead author, Santer. ‘IPCC reports’, Seitz observed, ‘are often called the “consensus”\n\nview’. But if they were to lead to ‘carbon taxes and restraints on economic growth,\n\nthey will have a major and almost certainly destructive effect on the economies of\n\nthe world’. He went on\n\nWhatever the intent was of those who made these significant changes, their ef-\n\nfect is to deceive policy makers and the public into believing that scientific evi-\n\ndence shows human activities are causing global warming.\n\nThe IPCC establishment was clearly very shaken at having been caught out like this.\n\nSo unimpeachable was Seitz’s reputation that his article could not simply be ignored.\n\nNor was it possible to discredit him personally (although that limp effort was made\n\nto associate him with Fred Singer, as co-authors of a paper which, it was insinuated,\n\nmust have been funded by allies of the tobacco industry).\n\nThe Wall Street Journal published defensive letters from both Bolin and Houghton,\n\nalong with one from Santer himself, (co-signed by Tom Wigley, another close adviser\n\nof Al Gore and former director of the University of East Anglia’s CRU), all denying that\n\nwhat had happened had been in breach of the IPCC’s rules.\n\nThis point was developed in a paper by another member of the IPCC establish-\n\nment, Stephen Schneider, who had also been present at the Madrid meeting. 27 He\n\ndid confirm that it was Santer who had been responsible for all the deletions and ad-\n\nditions. But he also described how, entirely within the rules (as he claimed), a little\n\ngroup of scientists had then gone off into a separate room to approve the changes. 28\n\nWhat only came to light two years later, in evidence to a Congressional committee,\n\nwas the sequence of events that had preceded the making of the changes. Before\n\nthe contributing scientists had signed off the text, Houghton, as the report’s editor,\n\nreceived a message from the State Department in Washington, which read:\n\nIt is essential that the chapters not be finalised prior to the completion of the\n\ndiscussions at the IPCC Working Group 1 Plenary in Madrid, and that chapter au-\n\n21thors be prevailed upon to modify their text in an appropriate manner following\n\nthe discussion in Madrid. 29\n\nThis instruction had come from the office of the man who was now the US Under-\n\nSecretary of State for Global Affairs: Timothy Wirth, the longtime close ally of Vice\n\nPresident Gore and chairman of those historic Senate committee hearings in 1988.\n\nTop of the US administration’s agenda at the time had been the effort to ensure a\n\nsuccessful outcome to the global climate conference due to take place in Kyoto in\n\n1997. For this they considered it vital that the IPCC should pronounce more forcefully\n\nthan before that there could no longer be any doubt that global warming was caused\n\nby human activity.\n\nBy any measure, this episode might have led observers to question whether the\n\nIPCC was quite the impartial, non-political body it was purported to be. But such was\n\nthe power of the groupthink, which now held so many in its grip – not least the media\n\n– that the dust soon settled. The authority of IPCC, as representing a ‘consensus of the\n\nworld’s top climate scientists’, emerged unscathed.\n\nIt is a fair guess that few of the 10,000 people who attended the UNFCCC’s mega-\n\nconference in Kyoto in December 1997 were not (in every sense) fully paid-up sup-\n\nporters of the ‘consensus’. They included 2000 official delegates – politicians, offi-\n\ncials and academics – supported by 5000 fully-funded climate activists and members\n\nof green lobby groups (44 from Greenpeace alone), plus 3000 representatives of the\n\nworld’s media, almost all of whom would have been sympathetic to the conference’s\n\naims. The star of the show was Vice President Gore, who descended by helicopter\n\non the main conference hotel just in time to give the opening keynote address. Also\n\nmuch in evidence, though no longer chairing the occasion, was Maurice Strong, And\n\nthe purpose of the gathering was to sign the world’s first full-scale global ‘climate\n\ntreaty’ which, after months of fierce behind-the-scenes haggling, was very much on\n\nthe lines originally drawn up by Strong.\n\nThe rich industrialised nations of the West, classified as ‘Annex 1 countries’, would\n\nagree to curb their carbon dioxide emissions, while the still ‘developing’ Annex 2\n\ncountries, including China and India, would be exempted, to allow their economies\n\nto catch up with the West. The one-sided nature of this deal put Gore on the spot,\n\nbecause it was precisely the reason why the US Senate had already voted 95-0 that\n\nAmerica could not accept such a treaty. But, to unanimous applause, Gore signed it\n\nanyway.\n\nEven though one of his close advisers, Tom Wigley, formerly director of the Univer-\n\nsity of East Anglia’s CRU, famously calculated that the emissions cuts signed up to by\n\nthe developed countries would only slow the rise in global temperatures by six years,\n\nthe political focus over the next few years was to persuade the requisite number of\n\ncountries to ratify the treaty to bring it into force. And it had already been agreed\n\nthat Kyoto was only a first step, to be replaced by another, much tougher treaty a few\n\n22years down the line.\n\nFor all this, it was vital for the IPCC to step up the pressure with its next report,\n\ndue in 2001. This was to lead to what would become, scientifically, the most revealing\n\nepisode in its history.\n\n8 The ‘consensus’ fudges the evidence\n\nHe who controls the past, controls the future. He who controls the present, controls\n\nthe past.\n\nGeorge Orwell, Nineteen Eighty-Four\n\nUp to now, it seemed the global warming theory was looking ever more plausible.\n\nAs carbon dioxide levels continued to rise, so did the trend in global temperatures,\n\nseemingly just as predicted. But the one problem which more than anything worried\n\nthe little group of scientists at the heart of the IPCC was the long-held assumption\n\nthat during the Middle Ages – the so-called Medieval Warm Period – the world had\n\nbeen even hotter than it had become in the late-20th century. Obviously, this was\n\ncenturies before it could have been blamed on man-made carbon dioxide. 30\n\nThe story of how the IPCC got around this problem has long been familiar and\n\nfully-documented. 31 It began in 1995 with a famous email from one of the little group\n\nof scientists at the heart of the IPCC, Jonathan Overpeck, to another scientist whom\n\nhe assumed agreed with the ‘consensus’. In it, Overpeck said ‘we have to get rid of the\n\nMediaeval Warm Period’.\n\nFour years later, bang on cue, there appeared in Nature a graph, produced by a\n\nhitherto unknown young PhD, Michael Mann, which supplied just what was needed.\n\nMann and two colleagues had wholly rewritten the accepted picture of historic world\n\ntemperatures. Their graph showed temperatures having steadily declined over the\n\npast millennium in an almost unwavering downward line, until suddenly, in the late\n\n20th century, they dramatically spiked upwards to by far their highest level in 1000\n\nyears (thus giving the graph the shape of the handle and blade of an ice-hockey stick).\n\nThe Medieval Warm Period had completely disappeared. So had the four-centuries-\n\nlong Little Ice Age. And it further helped that 1998 had been measured as the hottest\n\nyear since modern temperature records began, bringing the graph to its suitably ter-\n\nrifying climax.\n\nThis was everything those at the top of the IPCC could have wanted. When its\n\nThird Assessment Report appeared in 2001, the ‘hockey-stick’ not only led the first\n\npage of the Summary for Policymakers but at the launch of the report, Houghton\n\nappeared to the media in front of a huge blow-up of Mann’s graph. It also appeared\n\nfive more times in the report itself. It was this startling image as much as anything\n\nthat encouraged the Summary to go even further than its predecessors in claiming\n\n23that ‘there is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over\n\nthe past 50 years is attributable to human activity’, and to predict that, within 100\n\nyears, global temperatures could have risen by as much as 5.8 ◦ C, much higher than\n\nanything suggested before. 32\n\nBut it was also the strangely familiar hockey stick shape which, a year or two later,\n\ncaught the attention of Steve McIntyre, a Canadian expert in statistics. As an industrial\n\nconsultant, the shape of the hockey stick aroused his suspicion because he had often\n\nseen similar graphs produced by companies wishing to give an exaggeratedly opti-\n\nmistic picture of their future business prospects. When McIntyre and a Canadian eco-\n\nnomics professor, Ross McKitrick, used their expertise to analyse the way Mann had\n\nconstructed the graph, they became increasingly astonished. In essence it seemed\n\nthat Mann’s algorithm was ‘mining’ the underlying data for hockey-stick shapes, and\n\ntherefore would give a hockey stick result from whatever data was fed into it. In fact,\n\nalthough the graph purported to show temperatures over the past 1000 years for\n\nthe whole of the Northern Hemisphere, Mann’s initial ‘proxy’ temperature data had\n\nlargely consisted just of tree-rings from North America (a notoriously unreliable way\n\nto measure past temperatures). But almost the only trees from the sample which ac-\n\ntually had a hockey-stick shape had been one group of bristlecone pines in California.\n\nYet Mann’s algorithm had given these 390 times more weight than a tree-ring sam-\n\nple from Arkansas which had failed to show a ‘hockey stick’ shape. Finally, and even\n\nmore oddly, the temperatures for the closing decades of the 20th century were not\n\nbased on tree-ring proxies at all. They were thermometer-recorded data, and in the\n\nmuch-publicised version of the graph published in the IPCC’s 2001 report, they had\n\nbeen spliced onto the end of the tree-ring data. 33 It was only this combination of two\n\nwholly different data sources which gave the graph that final, eye-catching uptick.\n\nInitially McIntyre and McKitrick had great difficulty in getting any scientific journal\n\nto publish their findings. Nature, which had originally published the graph and had\n\nlong been a highly partisan advocate for the ‘consensus’, flatly refused to allow them\n\nto explain what their meticulous analysis had revealed. 34 But once they had found a\n\njournal willing to publish their findings, it became increasingly clear that the IPCC es-\n\ntablishment had again been seriously caught out, and this time on the very ‘evidence’\n\nit had made the single most widely publicised argument for their cause.\n\nWe later learned from the Climategate emails, leaked in 2009 from CRU, just what\n\nangst and anger this had aroused among that same intimately connected group of\n\nscientists who were now at the heart of the IPCC. In the exchanges of emails all their\n\nnames were there: Mann himself, Ben Santer, Tom Wigley, Stephen Schneider, Jonathan\n\nOverpeck, Kevin Trenberth, and Gavin Schmidt, who was Hansen’s number two at\n\nGISS and in charge of one of the two main global surface temperature records. At\n\nEast Anglia itself, their close ally, CRU director Phil Jones, was responsible for the other\n\nsurface record, HadCRUt.\n\n24What these emails also brought to light was that, just when Mann had been cre-\n\nating his ‘hockey-stick’, Jones’s CRU colleague Keith Briffa had already been trying to\n\nproduce a remarkably similar graph, also based on tree-ring ‘proxies’, this time from\n\nSiberia. But these had also frustratingly seemed to show a marked falling off of tem-\n\nperatures in the second half of the 20th century, which showed that they were not\n\nproxies for temperature at all. It was this problem that led to the most quoted of all\n\nthe Climategate emails, describing how they had used ‘Mike’s Nature trick’ to ‘hide the\n\ndecline’. In other words, they had cut off the tree-ring sequence just where it wasn’t\n\ngiving the picture they wanted, and then, like Mann, incorporated thermometer tem-\n\nperatures for recent decades, making them look much warmer than the medieval era.\n\nOnce out in the open, the ‘hockey-stick’ controversy continued tortuously to roll\n\non for two more years. Two of Mann’s closest academic colleagues, publicly champi-\n\noned by Houghton, pulled out all the stops to ensure that the next IPCC report, due\n\nin 2007, would include evidence confirming the accuracy of the ‘hockey stick’. 35\n\nIn fact, since 2001, there had been two significant changes at the top of the IPCC.\n\nHoughton himself had stepped down as head of Working Group I, responsible for the\n\nscience of climate change. In 2002, it had been given, for political reasons, a new\n\nchairman, Dr Rajendra Pachauri, the obscure director of a small, Delhi-based research\n\ninstitute, TERI. Pachauri had formerly been a railway engineer, before getting a PhD\n\nin the ‘economics of energy’. He had no background in climate science. 36\n\nIn 2006 Mann’s graph was the subject of two separate Congressional inquiries.\n\nOne included several of his supporters, who made sure that its findings were not too\n\nobviously damaging. The other commissioned a report from Dr Edward Wegman,\n\none of America’s most respected statisticians, which was fiercely critical of Mann’s\n\nmethodology. In a line which could almost have come from Irving Janis, Wegman\n\nwrote that Mann’s academic supporters were\n\n…a tightly-knit group of individuals who passionately believe in their thesis. How-\n\never, our perception is that this group has a self-reinforcing feedback mecha-\n\nnism.\n\nIn other words, the group’s method was to discuss, peer-review and cite each other’s\n\nwork, to maximise the authority of their shared view. But despite all their efforts, care-\n\nfully orchestrated by their allies inside the IPCC, and despite further breaches of the\n\nIPCC’s strict prohibition on citing papers not yet published, the final report’s defence\n\nof Mann was pretty well buried away. Its only repetition of his graph was so scrambled\n\ntogether with others in a ‘spaghetti’ diagram that it was barely visible.\n\nAlthough the ‘hockey stick’ had now been so widely discredited that it had all but\n\nsunk from view, it would continue to be used by supporters of the ‘consensus’ as if\n\nnone of this had happened. In the eyes of politicians and the media, the prestige of\n\nthe IPCC remained as high as ever.\n\n259\n\nWhen groupthink meets the outside world\n\nSir David King goes to Moscow\n\nThey revealed an absolute – and I stress absolute – inability to answer questions . . .\n\nwhen it became clear that they could not provide a substantive answer to a\n\nquestion . . . attempts were made to disrupt the seminar. At least four times during\n\nthe course of the seminar, ugly scenes were staged which prevented the seminar\n\nfrom proceeding normally. As a result we lost at least four hours of working time.\n\nVladimir Putin’s chief economic adviser speaking of the behaviour of the British\n\ndelegation led by Sir David King at an international conference on global warming\n\nin Moscow in 2004\n\nHistory can provide few more remarkable examples of the power of groupthink than\n\nthe scale on which, by the early years of the 21st century, the supporters of the ‘con-\n\nsensus’ had now taken over every major scientific institution in the Western world. 37\n\nEvery prestigious scientific body, led by the Royal Society in Britain and the National\n\nAcademy of Sciences in America, every reputable scientific journal such as Nature and\n\nScience, every university (and pretty well the entire education system) was by now not\n\njust committed to the official orthodoxy but evangelising for the cause.\n\nScientists from almost any discipline were vying to produce ever more scary sce-\n\nnarios of how polar ice would melt, sea levels rise, and droughts, floods, hurricanes\n\nand killer heatwaves become more frequent, not least because this was now the eas-\n\niest way to get access to public funding for any research which could be related, how-\n\never tangentially, to ‘climate change’.\n\nBut these scientists and academics were all operating from within the ‘consen-\n\nsus’ bubble. This meant that they only talked to each other, confident that they all\n\nshared the same a-priori assumptions. In their exchanges with their colleagues and\n\nat their endless publicly-funded conferences, they never met anyone who might dis-\n\nagree with them or ask awkward questions.\n\nBut we now recall two examples of what happened on the very rare occasions\n\nwhen those inside the bubble inadvertently came up against genuine experts from\n\noutside it. The first was the experience of Sir David King who, since 2000, had been\n\nthe chief scientific adviser to the British government under Tony Blair. In 2004, with\n\nthe US still failing to ratify Kyoto, Blair was bidding to take the international lead in\n\ngetting enough countries to ratify the treaty for it to come into force. And he now\n\nsent King into battle to support him.\n\nAs a specialist in surface chemistry, King had no qualifications in climate science\n\nwhatever. But in January 2004 this did not stop him writing in Science that global\n\nwarming was now the ‘most severe’ problem facing mankind, ‘a far greater threat to\n\nthe world than terrorism’. King attacked President George W. Bush for failing to bring\n\n26the US, as the world’s largest carbon dioxide emitter, into line (overlooking the fact\n\nthat it was the US Senate that had unanimously vetoed even signing the treaty, let\n\nalone ratifying it).\n\nIn March, King went much further, warning a committee of MPs that the South\n\nPole had already lost 40 percent of its ice and that the melting of the polar ice caps\n\ncould cause a shift in the Gulf Stream, which would lower temperatures in Britain and\n\nEurope by as much as 10 ◦ C. This ‘could happen quite suddenly’, said King, as could the\n\n‘switching off’ of the Indian monsoon. ‘There could be a point, and it is quite likely’, he\n\nwent on, where temperatures rose too high for tropical forests to survive, ‘so that they\n\nwould switch from being net absorbers of carbon dioxide to net emitters’. This could\n\ntrigger a repeat of what had happened 55 million years ago, when carbon dioxide\n\nrose to 1000 parts per million of the atmosphere. Most of the Earth was so hot that\n\nthis made ‘Antarctica virtually the only place on the planet which was habitable’. 38\n\nThe British politicians might have been ready to believe all this, but four months\n\nlater King found a very different audience when, at Blair’s request, he led a team of\n\nBritish scientists to Moscow, to take part in an international seminar organised for the\n\nRussian Academy of Sciences by President Putin’s chief economic adviser, Alexander\n\nIlarionov. King’s mission was to persuade the Russians to ratify Kyoto, which would\n\nat last bring the treaty into force. But Russia’s leading scientists could not have been\n\nmore opposed to the Western ‘consensus’ that carbon dioxide was the chief driver of\n\nglobal warming. And when King saw that the list of speakers invited to address the\n\nconference included some of the world’s leading scientists who were most sceptical\n\nof the IPCC ‘consensus’, he furiously described them as ‘undesirables’, saying that they\n\nshould not be allowed to speak. 39\n\nWhen it was insisted that the seminar would continue as planned, the gathering\n\nwas astonished by the behaviour of King and his colleagues. They ran on for much\n\nlonger than their allotted time, frequently interrupted other speakers, and on four\n\noccasions caused the proceedings to break up in such disorder that they had to be\n\nsuspended. The climax came when King himself was at the podium, putting forward\n\nthe ‘consensus’ view on one of its favourite memes: that global warming was respon-\n\nsible for the melting of the ice cap on Kilimanjaro. One of those in the audience who\n\ncould see that King had no idea what he was talking about was Professor Paul Reiter,\n\nthe world’s leading authority on insect-borne diseases, such as malaria. As an adviser\n\nto the World Health Organization, he had contributed to the IPCC’s 1996 report, but\n\nhad been strongly critical of its claim that global warming would cause a spread of\n\ndiseases. And he had already aroused King’s ire at the conference, by detailing where\n\nthe IPCC had got the science on his own subject so badly wrong.\n\nReiter now stood up to explain politely that King seemed unaware of the several\n\nexpert studies which had shown that the shrinking of the Kilimanjaro ice cap had\n\nnothing to do with global warming. The ice had been melting since the 1880s. Most\n\n27of its retreat had been in the years before 1950. Its cause had been local deforestation,\n\nwhich had led to a severe drop in precipitation. Unable to answer Reiter’s points, King\n\nbroke off mid-sentence of a halting reply and led his t"
