        "text": "MTT 1910 E-Type Tram No. 118 - Operational in Regular Traffic\n\n70 larger combination trams were built from 1910-12 for the expansion of the electric tramway system. They had a saloon at one end and cross bench seats at the other capabale of seating 54 passangers. These trams sat on two maximum traction bogies (small pony guide wheel and a larger driving wheel). They were often hired to take picnic parties to Magill or Burnside at a charge of 24 shillings for the whole group. The E-Type trams were all converted to the E1-Type Saloon Bogie in 1936.\n\nThe body of 118 arrived at St Kilda in 1982 after residing at Fishermans Bay near Port Broughton for about 25 years. It has been reconstructed to the original bogie combination style.\n\nE-Type No. 118 was officially launched on 23 May 2010 by Deputy Premier of SA Kevin Foley in conjunction with Margaret Anderson Director of History SA. History SA provided initial funding of $19,000 for the restoration of No. 118. Initial restoration work focused on dismantling the saloon at the crossbench end and strengthening the frame and restoration of the remaining saloon interior. The bulk of the work occurred over the five years prior to May 2010 mainly due to the generous donations of members who donated over $64,000 to the project.\n\nMTT 1912 D-Type Tram No. 192 - Operational in Regular Traffic\n\nThe 50 D-Type trams (121 - 170) had sliding doors fitted along the sides of the crossbench end, giving much greater protection to passengers in inclement weather. When the D-Types entered service they were the largest public transport vehicles in the streets and could carry 54 passengers seated with standing room for a further 100. In 1912 four similar cars were built in Adelaide for the Prahran & Malvern Tramways Trust in Melbourne. They were subsequently sold to the Hawthorn Tramways Trust. In 1922 they became Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board 127 - 130. They were acquired in 1927 by the MTT in Adelaide Trams 191 - 194.\n\nBy 1934 a centre aisle was cut through the centre bulkhead and four of the six crossbench seats of Trams No. 121 - 170 following a number of accidents to conductors collecting fares from the footboards. Trams 191 - 194 had the aisle cut through five of the six crossbench seats prior to their purchase. In their later years, the D-Type trams became a common sight on the tram lines serving the South Eastern suburbs of Erindale, Burnside, Linden Park, Kingswood. The D-Type trams were last used on 5 March 1958. Car 192 (formerly M&MTB No. 130) was one of the first cars at the Museum site in 1958. Refurbishment of the tram was completed in May 1979.\n\nMTT 1926 F1-Type No. 264 - Operational in Regular traffic\n\nThe F-Type/F1-Type Drop-centre trams were a highly successful design offering generous space and comfort. More modern running gear taking up less space meant that the car body was lower to the ground, making the tram easier to board. Six feet (180 cm) longer than the earlier D-Type and E-Type Trams. The F’s had 60 seats with space for a further 110 Standees. Six streams of passengers could board simultaneously. Their large capacity and superior riding qualities made them popular with the public. The Drop-centres were used over most of the tramway system and were especially suitable for heavy traffic like Horse Races, Football Games, the Royal Adelaide Show and beach outings.\n\n81 cars were built by Pengelley & Co and three were built in the MTT’s own workshops during the 1920s bringing the total up to 84 F/F1-Types, the most of any type of tram in Adelaide. 50 cars were repainted in the early 1950s in silver and carnation red to give a more modern appearance. The interiors were painted in Asbury green. They were last used upon the closure of the Adelaide street tramway system on 22 November 1958.\n\nCar 264 was used as a sleepout on a farm at Clare SA until retrieved in 1981 and reconstructed by 1986 using ex Melbourne ‘W2’ class tram bogies and electrical equipment.\n\nMTT 1928 F1-Type No. 282 - Operational in Regular traffic\n\nThe F-Type/F1-Type Drop-centre trams were a highly successful design offering generous space and comfort. More modern running gear taking up less space meant that the car body was lower to the ground, making the tram easier to board. Six feet (180 cm) longer than the earlier D-Type and E-Type Trams. The F’s had 60 seats with space for a further 110 Standees. Six streams of passengers could board simultaneously. Their large capacity and superior riding qualities made them popular with the public. The Drop-centres were used over most of the tramway system and were especially suitable for heavy traffic like Horse Races, Football Games, the Royal Adelaide Show and beach outings.\n\n81 cars were built by Pengelley & Co and three were built in the MTT’s own workshops during the 1920s bringing the total up to 84 F/F1-Types, the most of any type of tram in Adelaide. 50 cars were repainted in the early 1950s in silver and carnation red to give a more modern appearance. The interiors were painted in Asbury green. They were last used upon the closure of the Adelaide street tramway system on 22 November 1958.\n\nF1-Type No. 282 arrived at St Kilda in 1959. Restoration commenced in 1968 and the tram was ready for the opening of the Museum Tram Line in 1974.\n\nMTT 1924 G-Type No. 303 - Operational in Regular traffic\n\nG-Type trams also known as Birney Safety (named after their designer, Charles Birney) were built by J.G. Brill and Co. of Philadelphia USA in 1924 and entered service in Adelaide in 1925. Seating 32 passengers the G-Type trams were known mostly to patrons using the small, self-contained system radiating out from the Black Diamond corner at Port Adelaide to Semaphore, Largs, Rosewater, and Albert Park. These lines did not connect to the rest of the Adelaide system and tram service ran for eighteen years before being replaced by buses and trolley buses which ran from the City along Port Road. The four G-Type trams were exported to Australia and assembled in the MTT workshops and made up the smallest group of MTT trams with the shortest running life of only 10 years service. They were also the shortest cars operated by the MTT.\n\nFollowing the closure of the Port Adelaide tramway in 1935 they were sold for use at Geelong and become Geelong No. 30, 29, 27 & 28. They were transferred to the Bendigo system in 1947. No. 27 (ex 303) was badly damaged in an accident in 1956 and sold to a farmer near Maryborough, Victoria. The other three Birneys remained and are now operated by the Bendigo Tramways.\n\nTh Bendigo Trust obtained the body of 27 in 1975 and reconstructed it as Port Adelaide 303 using original mechanical components. The interior seating which had been sold to a local Bendigo resident was also obtained and reinstalled in the tram during its restoration. No. 303 entered service at St Kilda in August 1976.\n\nMTT Adelaide 1929 H-Type Trams\n\nNo. 351 - On Static Display\n\nNo. 352 - Operational in Regular Traffic\n\nNo. 360 - Operational currently Out of Traffic\n\nNo. 362 - On Static Display\n\nNo. 364 - On Static Display\n\nNo. 365 - Operational in Regular Traffic\n\nNo. 378 - On Static Display\n\nH-Type Trams (Commonly referred to as Glenelg Trams) No. 351 - 380 were built in 1929 specifically for the Glenelg tram line which commenced on 14 December 1929. They were large bogie end loading saloons and were classified as H-Type Trams. They could run in coupled sets, have power operated doors, folding steps and reversible leather seats. They were also used on the Henley North line from 1935 and then through to Kensington Gardens after these lines were through routed in 1952.\n\nAll H-Types were repainted in the silver and carnation red livery between 1952 and 1956. They were progressively refurbished from 1971 and returned to the Tuscan red livery. When operations were transferred from the Angas Street City Depot to Glengowrie depot in September 1986, pantographs replaced trolley poles for current collection.\n\nTrams No. 360 and 362 were not refurbished and arrived at St Kilda in 1982. Tram No. 362 was repainted in the silver and carnation red livery and entered limited museum service in 1983. No. 360 was refurbished to its original form in 1999 for the 70th anniversary of the Glenelg line and the H-Types.\n\nWhen the State Government called for tenders for the 16 remaining H-Types in 2005 which were being replaced by the modern Flexity tramcars, the Museum decided that Glenelg tram 364 would make an excellent addition to our existing H-Type trams at the Museum. No. 364 represents the 1980s style refurbishment of these trams and differs in several ways from our other H-Types.\n\nIn December 2005 H-Type No. 365 was delivered to the Museum for storage on behalf of its owner who intended to turn it into a 'Bed & Breakfast' in the Adelaide Hills. As No. 365 was one of the ten operational 1980s refurbished H cars being disposed of, it had been planned for the Museum to strip the tram for useful parts before the owner took the body away. The Museum's own 1980s refurbished H-Type No. 364 arrived in October 2006. The owner's plans for the tram did not go ahead and the tram was purchased by the Museum and on sold to a Museum member who resotred it to running condition in the 1980-90s STA (State Transport Authority) Livery.\n\nA one off unique H-Type is No. 378 which was turned into a restaurant on rails for use on the Glenelg Line. It was launched by the Premier John Bannon on 1 November 1990. Tram No. 378 ran for 2-3 years with pre-cooked meals. It operated as the Adelaide Tramcar Restaurant and featured a range of food options from elaborate three course dinners to simple afternoon teas. No. 378 generally ran up to 6 times a day.\n\nThe tram is a mechanically similar to the 1980s refurbished H-Types, but fitted with vigilance controls to allow its operation by one tramway staff member, It normally operated at series speed only to lengthen the journey and minimise the impact of any track imperfections.\n\nUnfortunately the enterprise was not financially viable at that time and went into bankruptcy. A couple of years later TransAdelaide attempted to revive the business by renaming the tram The Grand Lady with meals pre-cooked by the Grand Hotel at Glenelg but without much success. The tram was handed over to the History Trust of SA and arrived at St Kilda for storage and display in June 2007. It makes a visually different exhibit on Display at the Musuem.\n\nMTT 1952 H1-Type Tram No. 381 - Operational in Regular Traffic\n\nH1-Type No. 381 was the first of a projected order of 40 cars planned in 1939. However the first tram was not built until 1952 when a tramway abandonment policy resulted in the cancellation of the remaining cars.\n\nThe body was all steel and it was fitted with power operated doors. Four destination blinds were fitted to each end of the car, a style which was later used on the replacement buses. The interior was painted asbury green & cream and fitted with fixed bus seats. It was designated H1-Type. No. 381 entered regular service on the Henley North - Kensington Gardens line on 19 February 1953. It was withdrawn from service in December 1957 and stored.\n\nNo. 381 has had a much more successful record at the Museum. It was donated to the Museum and arrived on site on 13 August 1965. It became the 6th tram to enter service at the Museum entering service in July 1974 - 4 months after the official opening."
