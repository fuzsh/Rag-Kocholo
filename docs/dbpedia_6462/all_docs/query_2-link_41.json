It is thought, therefore, that the time has arrived when an attempt should be made to collect the main facts bearing upon this subject, in order to present them from an Australasian standpoint. With this in view, references to fossils occurring in the northern hemisphere are subordinated, seeing that these may be easily obtained on reference to the accepted text-books in general use.\n\nThe present work does not presume to furnish a complete record of Australasian palaeontology, since that would mean the production of a much more extensive and costly volume. Sufficient information is here given, however, to form a groundwork for the student of this section of natural science, and a guide to the collector of these “medals of creation.”\n\nThe systematic portion of this book has been arranged primarily from the biological side, since Palaeontology is the “study of ancient life.” Taking each life-group, therefore, from the lowest to the highest types, all the divisions represented by fossils are dealt with in turn, beginning with their occurrence in the oldest rocks and ending with those in the newest strata.\n\nIf a commendation of the study of fossils, apart from its scientific utility, were needed, it could be « 11 » pointed out that palaeontology as a branch of geology is, par excellence, an open-air study: and since it requires as handmaids all the sister sciences, is a subject of far-reaching interest. Microscopy and photography are of immense value in certain branches of fossil research, the former in the examination of the minute forms of mollusca, foraminifera and ostracoda, the latter in the exact portraiture of specimens too intricate to copy with the brush, or too evanescent to long retain, when out of their matrix, their clean fresh surfaces. With geology or palaeontology as an objective, a country walk may be a source of much enjoyment to its students, for “in their hand is Nature like an open book”; and the specimens collected on a summer excursion may be closely and profitably studied in the spare time of the winter recess.\n\nThe author sincerely trusts that students may share the same pleasure which he has derived from the study of these relics of past life; and that the present attempt to show their relationship both in geological time and biological organisation, may be the means of inducing many to make further advances in this fascinating subject.\n\nIn the production of this work several friends and collaborators have materially assisted, their aid considerably increasing its value. It is therefore with grateful thanks that the author acknowledges the help and encouragement given by Professor E. W. Skeats, D.Sc., who has not only been good enough to write the Introductory passages, but who has carefully gone over the MS. and made many helpful « 12 » suggestions. Mr. W. S. Dun, F.G.S., Palaeontologist to the Geological Survey Branch of the Department of Mines, Sydney, has also rendered generous help in giving the benefit of his full acquaintance of the palaeontology of his own State. To the Trustees of the National Museum the author is under special obligations for permission to photograph many unique fossil specimens in the Museum collection, comprising Figs. 3, 16-18, 20-22, 28-31, 35, 39, 40, 45, 46, 51-54, 57, 62, 78, 79, 127, 133, 136, 147 and 148. The author’s thanks are also due to Dr. E. C. Stirling, M.D., M.A., F.R.S., for permission to use Figs. 143, 144 and 145, whilst similar privileges have been accorded by Prof. A. G. Seward, F.R.S., Dr. F. A. Bather, F.R.S., and Mr. C. L. Barrett. Prof. T. W. Edgeworth David, F.R.S., has kindly cleared up some doubtful points of stratigraphy and further increased the author’s indebtedness by the loan of a unique slide of Radiolaria figured on p. 69. Mr. Eastwood Moore, to whom special thanks are due, has greatly added to the pictorial side of this work by his skillful help in preparing many of the illustrations for the press, as well as in the drawing of the several maps. The grouped sets of fossils have been especially drawn for this work by the author. They are either copied from authentic specimens or from previously published drawings; references to the authorities being given in the accompanying legends. Dr. T. S. Hall has kindly read the section on Graptolites and Mammalia. For many helpful suggestions and the careful reading of proofs, thanks are especially owing to Mr. W. E. G. Simons, Mr. R. A. Keble, and to my wife.\n\n« 13 »\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nGeological Department,\n\nThe University, Melbourne.\n\nW\n\nWilliam Smith, the Father of English Geology, used to apologize for the study of palaeontology by claiming that “the search for a fossil is at least as rational a proceeding as the pursuit of a hare.” Those of us who are accustomed to take the field, armed with a hammer, in the search for “medals of creation” and from time to time have experienced the sporting enjoyment of bringing to light a rare or perfect specimen are quite prepared to support his claim. But the student of fossils needs the help of a text book to guide him to the literature on the subject, to help him with his identifications or to indicate that some of his finds are new and hitherto undescribed. European and American workers have long been provided with excellent books treating generally of fossils, but the illustrations have been quite naturally taken mainly from forms occurring in the Northern Hemisphere. Our own fossil forms both plants and animals are numerous, interesting and in many cases peculiar, but the literature concerning them is so widely scattered in various « 14 » scientific publications that a warm welcome should be given to this book of Mr. Chapman’s, in which the Australian evidence is brought together and summarised by one, whose training, long experience, and personal research qualify him to undertake the task. Especially will teachers and students of Geology and Palaeontology value such an undertaking. Workers in other countries who have only partial access to the Australian literature on the subject should also find this a valuable book of reference.\n\nIn the study of fossils we are concerned with the nature, evolution and distribution of the former inhabitants of the earth. The study of Palaeontology may be justified as a means of scientific discipline, for the contributions the subject makes to the increase of natural knowledge and the unfolding of panoramas of ancient life. It also provides perhaps the most positive evidence in the story of evolution. So, too, the student of the present day distribution of animals and plants finds the key to many a problem in zoo-geography in the records of past migrations yielded by the study of fossils in different lands. The stratigraphical geologist is of course principally concerned with two important aspects of the study of fossils.\n\nThe masterly generalisation of William Smith that strata can be identified by their fossil contents established by close study of the rocks and fossils of the British Oolites has been confirmed generally by subsequent work. The comparative study of the fossil contents of rocks in widely separated areas has proved to be the most valuable means by which the « 15 » correlation of the rocks can be effected and their identity of age established. In some cases the recognition of a single fossil species in two areas separated, perhaps, by thousands of miles may suffice to demonstrate that the rocks are of the same age. For example, a graptolite such as Phyllograptus typus is found in many parts of the world, but has only a very restricted range in time. It has been found only in rocks of Lower Ordovician age. Its occurrence in Wales and in the rocks of Bendigo practically suffices to establish the identity in age of the rocks in these widely separated areas.\n\nGenerally, however, much closer study and a more detailed examination of a large number of the fossils of a rock series are required before the age of the rocks can be surely established and a safe correlation made with distant localities.\n\nThe stratigraphical generalisations to be made from the study of fossils however must be qualified by certain considerations. Among these are the fact that our knowledge of the life forms of a given geological period is necessarily incomplete, that the differences in the fossil contents of rocks may depend not only on differences of age but also in the conditions under which the organisms lived and the rocks were accumulated, and that forms of life originating in one area do not spread themselves immediately over the earth but migrate at velocities depending on their mode of life and the presence or absence of barriers to their progress.\n\nOur incomplete knowledge of the forms living in remote geological periods arises partly from the fact « 16 » that some forms had no permanent skeleton and were therefore incapable of preservation, partly to the obliteration of the skeletons of organisms through subsequent earth movements in the rocks or through the solvent action of water. Many land forms, too, probably disintegrated on the surface before deposits were formed over the area. Apart from these causes which determine that a full knowledge of the fossils from ancient rocks in particular, will never be acquired, our knowledge is incomplete by reason either of difficulty of access to certain areas or incomplete search. As a result of later discoveries earlier conclusions based on incomplete evidence as to the age of a rock series, have not infrequently been modified.\n\nThe study of the present distribution of animals and plants over the earth is a help in the attempt to decide how far the fossil differences in the sets of rocks are due to differences in the ages of the rocks or to differences in the conditions under which the organisms lived. The present, in this, as in many other geological problems, is the key to the past.\n\nWe know, for instance, that differences of climate largely control the geographical distribution of land animals and especially of land plants, and for that reason among others, fossil plants are generally less trustworthy guides to geological age than fossil animals.\n\nIn the distribution of marine animals at the present day we find that organisms of simple structure are generally more wide-spread and less susceptible to changes in their environment than are the more complex organisms with specialised structures. Hence we find, for instance, a fossil species of the « 17 » Foraminifera may persist unchanged through several geological periods, while a species of fossil fish has in general not only a short range in time but often a restricted geographical extent. If we consider the marine organisms found at the present day we find a number of free-swimming forms very widely distributed, while a large number are restricted either by reason of climate or of depth. Certain organisms are only to be found between high and low tide levels, others between low tide level and a depth of thirty fathoms, while many quite different forms live in deeper waters. If we confine our attention to shallow-water marine forms we note that certain forms are at the present day restricted to waters of a certain temperature. We find, therefore, a contrast between arctic and tropical faunas, while other types characterize temperate latitudes. Climatic and bathymetrical differences at the present day therefore lead to distinct differences in the distribution of certain organisms, while other forms, less sensitive to these factors, range widely and may be almost universally distributed. Similar conditions obtained in past geological times, and therefore in attempting to correlate the rocks of one area with those of another those fossils which are most wide-spread are often found to be the most valuable.\n\nAttention should also be paid to the conditions under which the deposits accumulated, since it is clear that rocks may be formed at the same time in different areas and yet contain many distinct fossils by reason of climatic or bathymetrical differences. Among living marine organisms we find certain forms restricted to sandy or muddy sea-bottoms and others « 18 » to clear water, and these changes in the conditions of deposition of sediment have played their part in past geological periods in determining differences in the fossil faunas of rocks which were laid down simultaneously. We not infrequently find mudstones passing laterally into limestones, and this lithological change is always accompanied by a more or less notable change in the fossil contents of the two rock types. Such facts emphasize the close connection between stratigraphy and palaeontology, and indicate that the successful tracing out of the geological history of any area is only possible when the evidence of the stratigrapher is reinforced by that provided by the palaeontologist. The fact that species of animals and plants which have been developed in a particular area do not spread all over the world at once but migrate very slowly led Huxley many years ago to put forward his hypothesis of “homotaxis.” He agreed that when the order of succession of rocks and fossils has been made out in one area, this order and succession will be found to be generally similar in other areas. The deposits in two such contrasted areas are homotaxial, that is, show a similarity of order, but, he claimed, are not necessarily synchronous in their formation. In whatever parts of the world Carboniferous, Devonian and Silurian fossils may be found, the rocks with Carboniferous fossils will be found to overlie those with Devonian, and these in their turn rest upon those containing Silurian fossils. And yet Huxley maintained that if, say, Africa was the area in which faunas and floras originated, the migration of a Silurian fauna and flora might take place so slowly « 19 » that by the time it reached Britain the succeeding Devonian forms had developed in Africa, and when it reached North America, Devonian forms had reached Britain and Carboniferous forms had developed in Africa. If this were so a Devonian fauna and flora in Britain may have been contemporaneous with Silurian life in North America and with a Carboniferous fauna and flora in Africa.\n\nThis could only be true if the time taken for the migration of faunas and floras was so great as to transcend the boundaries between great geological periods. This does not appear to be the case, and Huxley’s idea in its extreme form has been generally abandoned. At the same time certain anomalies in the range in time of individual genera have been noted, and may possibly be explained on such lines. For instance, among the group of the graptolites, in Britain the genus Bryograptus occurs only in the Upper Cambrian and the genus Leptograptus only in the Upper Ordovician rocks. In Victoria these two genera, together with typical Lower Ordovician forms, may be found near Lancefield preserved on a single slab of shale. In the same way, in a single quarry in Triassic rocks in New South Wales, a number of fossil fish have been found and described, some of which have been compared to Jurassic, others to Permian, and others to Carboniferous forms in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nAnother point which the palaeontologist may occasionally find evidence for is the existence of “biological asylums,” areas which by means of land or other barriers may be for a long period separated from the main stream of evolution. We know that « 20 » the present fauna and flora of Australia is largely of archaic aspect, as it includes a number of types which elsewhere have long ago become extinct or were never developed. This appears to be due to the long isolation of Australia and, as Professor Gregory happily puts it—its “development in a biological backwater.” We have some evidence that similar asylums have existed in past geological periods, with the result that in certain areas where uniform conditions prevailed for a long time or where isolation from competition prevented rapid evolution, some organisms which became extinct in other areas, persisted unchanged in the “asylum” into a younger geological period.\n\nThe broad generalizations that rocks may be identified by their fossil contents and that the testimony of the rocks demonstrates the general order of evolution from simple to complex forms, have only been placed on a surer footing by long continued investigations. The modifications produced by conditions of deposit, of climate and of natural barriers to migration, while introducing complexities into the problems of Palaeontology, are every year becoming better known; and when considered in connection with the variations in the characters of the rocks, provide valuable and interesting evidence towards the solution of the ultimate problems of geology and palaeontology, which include the tracing out of the evolution of the history of the earth from the most remote geological period to that point at which the geologist hands over his story to the archaeologist, the historian, and the geographer.\n\nERNEST W. SKEATS.\n\n« 21 »\n\nPART I.\n\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nNATURE AND USES OF FOSSILS.\n\nScope of Geology.—\n\nT\n\nThe science of GEOLOGY, of which PALAEONTOLOGY or the study of fossils, forms a part, is concerned with the nature and structure of the earth, the physical forces that have shaped it, and the organic agencies that have helped to build it.\n\nNature of Fossils.—\n\nThe remains of animals and plants that formerly existed in the different periods of the history of the earth are spoken of as fossils. They are found, more or less plentifully, in such common rocks as clays, shales, sandstones, and limestones, all of which are comprised in the great series of Sedimentary Rocks (Fig. 1).\n\nAccording to the surroundings of the organisms, whether they existed on land, in rivers, lakes, estuaries, or the sea, they are spoken of as belonging to terrestrial, fluviatile, lacustrine, estuarine, or marine deposits.\n\n« 22 »\n\n« 23 »\n\nThe name fossil, from the Latin ‘fodere’ to dig,—‘fossilis,’ dug out,—is applied to the remains of any animals or plants which have been buried either in sediments laid down in water, in materials gathered together by the wind on land as sand-dunes, in beds of volcanic ash, or in cave earths. But not only remains of organisms are thus called fossils, for the name is also applied to structures only indirectly connected with once living objects, such as rain-prints, ripple-marks, sun-cracks, and tracks or impressions of worms and insects (Fig. 2).\n\nPreservation of Fossils.—\n\nIn ordinary terms, fossils are the durable parts of animals and plants which have resisted complete decay by being covered over with the deposits above-named. It is due, then, to the fact that they have been kept from the action of the air, with its destructive bacteria, that we are able to still find these relics of life in the past.\n\nPetrifaction of Fossils.—\n\nWhen organisms are covered by a tenacious mud, they sometimes undergo no further change. Very often, however, moisture containing mineral matter such as carbonate of lime or silica, percolates through the stratum which contains the fossils, and then they not only have their pores filled with the mineral, but their actual substance may also undergo a molecular change, whereby the original composition of the shell or the hard part is entirely altered. This tends almost invariably to harden the fossils still further, which change of condition is called petrifaction, or the making into stone.\n\n« 24 »\n\nStructure Preserved.—\n\nPetrifaction does not necessarily destroy the structure of a fossil. For example, a piece of wood, which originally consisted of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, may be entirely replaced by flint or silica: and yet the original structure of the wood may be so perfectly preserved that when a thin slice of the petrifaction is examined under a high power of the microscope, the tissues with their component cells are seen and easily recognised (Fig. 3).\n\nEarly Observers.—\n\nRemains of animals buried in the rocks were known from the earliest times, and frequent references to these were made by the ancient Greek and Roman philosophers.\n\nXenophanes.—\n\nXenophanes, who lived B.C. 535, wrote of shells, « 25 » fishes and seals which had become dried in mud, and were found inland and on the tops of the highest mountains. The presence of these buried shells and bones was ascribed by the ancients to a plastic force latent in the earth itself, while in some cases they were regarded as freaks of nature.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci.—\n\nIn the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Italian observers came to the fore in clearly demonstrating the true nature of fossils. This was no doubt due in part to the fact that the Italian coast affords a rich field of observation in this particular branch of science. The celebrated painter Leonardo da Vinci (early part of the sixteenth century), who carried out some engineering works in connection with canals in the north of Italy, showed that the mud brought down by rivers had penetrated into the interior of shells at a time when they were still at the bottom of the sea near the coast.\n\nSteno.—\n\nIn 1669, Steno, a Danish physician residing in Italy, wrote a work on organic petrifactions which are found enclosed in solid rocks, and showed by his dissection of a shark which had been recently captured and by a comparison of its teeth with those found fossil in the cliffs, that they were identical. The same author also pointed out the resemblance between the shells discovered in the Italian strata and those living on the adjacent shores. It was not until the close of the eighteenth century, however, that the study of fossil remains received a decided impetus. It is curious to note that many of these later « 26 » authors maintained the occurrence of a universal flood to account for the presence of fossil shells and bones on the dry land.\n\nFossils an Index to Age.—\n\nA large part of the credit of showing how fossils are restricted to certain strata, and help to fix the succession and age of the beds, is due to the English geologist and surveyor, William Smith (Fig. 4). “The Father of English Geology,” as he has been called, published two works[1] in the early part of last century, in which he expressed his view of the value of fossils to the geologist and surveyor, and showed that there was a regular law of superposition of one bed upon another, and that strata could be identified at distant localities by their included fossils. Upon « 27 » this foundation the work of later geologists has been firmly established; and students of strata and of fossils work hand in hand.\n\nStratigraphy.—\n\nThat branch of geology which discusses the nature and relations of the various sediments of the earth’s crust, and the form in which they were laid down, is called Stratigraphy. From it we learn that in bygone times many of those places that are now occupied by dry land have been, often more than once, covered by the sea; and thus Tennyson’s lines are forcibly brought to mind—\n\n“There where the long street roars hath been\n\nThe stillness of the central sea.”\n\nElevated Sea-beds.—\n\nA striking illustration in proof of this emergence of the land from the sea is the occurrence of marine shells similar to those now found living in the sea, in sea-cliffs sometimes many hundreds of feet above sea-level. When these upraised beds consist of shingle or sand with shore-loving shells, as limpets and mussels, they are spoken of as Raised Beaches. Elevated beaches are often found maintaining the same level along coast-lines for many miles, like those recorded by Darwin at Chili and Peru, or in the south of England (Fig. 5). They also occur intermittently along the Victorian coast, especially around the indents, where they have survived the wear and tear of tides along the coast line (Fig. 6). They are also a common feature, as a capping, on many coral islands which have undergone elevation.\n\n« 28 »\n\n« 29 »\n\nSea-beds far from the Present Coast.—\n\nMarine beds of deeper water origin may be found not only close to the coast-line, but frequently on the tops of inland hills some miles from the sea-coast. Their included sea-shells and other organic remains are often found covered by fine sediment forming extensive beds; and they may frequently occur in the position in which they lived and died (Fig. 7). Although it is well known that sea-birds carry shell-fish for some distance inland, yet this would not account for more than a few isolated examples.\n\nRaised Beaches as Distinct from Middens.—\n\nAgain, it may be argued that the primitive inhabitants of countries bordering the coast were in the habit of piling up the empty shells of the edible molluscs used by them for food: but these “kitchen middens” are easily distinguished from fossil deposits like shelly beaches, by the absence of stratified layers; and, further, by the shells being confined to edible species, as the Cockle (Cardium), the Blood-cockle (Arca), the Mussel (Mytilus), and the Oyster (Ostrea) (Fig. 8).\n\n« 30 »\n\nSubmerged Forests.—\n\nEvidence of change in the coast-line is shown by the occurrence of submerged forest-land, known as “fossil forests,” which consist of the stumps of trees still embedded in the black, loamy soil. Such forests, « 31 » when of comparatively recent age, are found near the existing coast-line, and may sometimes extend for a considerable distance out to sea (Fig. 9).\n\nFrom the foregoing we learn that:—\n\n1.—Fossils afford data of the various Changes that have taken place in past times in the Relative Positions of Land and Water.\n\nChanges of Climate in the Past.—\n\nAt the present day we find special groups of animals (fauna), and plants (flora), restricted to tropical climates; and others, conversely, to the arctic regions. Cycads and tree-ferns, for example, seem to flourish best in warm or sub-tropical countries: yet in past times they were abundant in northern Europe in what are now temperate and arctic regions, as in Yorkshire, Spitzbergen, and Northern Siberia, where indeed at one time they formed the principal flora.\n\nThe rein-deer and musk-sheep, now to be found only in the arctic regions, once lived in the South of England, France and Germany. The dwarf willow (Salix polaris) and an arctic moss (Hypnum turgescens), now restricted to the same cold region, occur fossil in the South of England.\n\nIn Southern Australia and in New Zealand, the marine shells which lived during the earlier and middle Tertiary times belong to genera and species which are indicative of a warmer climate than that now prevailing; this ancient fauna being like that met with in dredging around the northern coasts of Australia (Fig. 10).\n\n« 32 »\n\nFrom the above evidence we may say that:—\n\n2.—Fossils teach us that in Former Times the Climate of certain parts of the earth’s surface was Different from that now existing.\n\nFossils as Guides to Age of Strata.—\n\nIn passing from fossil deposits of fairly recent origin to those of older date, we find the proportion of living species gradually diminish, being replaced by forms now extinct. After this the genera themselves are replaced by more ancient types, and if we penetrate still deeper into the series of geological strata, even families and orders of animals and plants give place to others entirely unknown at the present day.\n\n« 33 »\n\nFrom this we conclude that:—\n\n3.—Fossil Types, or Guide Fossils, are of great value in indicating the Relative Age of Geological Formations.\n\nGradual Evolution of Life-forms from Lower to Higher Types.—\n\nAs a general rule the various types of animals and plants become simpler in organisation as we descend the geological scale. For example, in the oldest rocks the animals are confined to the groups of Foraminifera, Sponges, Corals, Graptolites, Shell-fish and Trilobites, all back-boneless animals: whilst it was not until the Devonian period that the primitive fishes appeared as a well-defined group; and in the next formation, the Carboniferous Series, the first traces of the Batrachians (Frog-like animals) and Reptiles are found. Birds do not appear, so far as their remains are known, until near the close of the Jurassic; whilst Mammals are sparsely represented by Monotremes and Marsupials in the Triassic and Jurassic, becoming more abundant in Cainozoic times, and by the Eutheria (Higher Mammals) from the commencement of the Eocene period.\n\nIt is clear from the above and other facts in the geological distribution of animal types that:—\n\n4.—The Geological Record supports in the main the Doctrine of Evolution from Simpler to more Complex types; and fossils throw much light upon the Ancestry of Animals and Plants now found Living.\n\n« 34 »\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE CLASSIFICATION OF FOSSIL ANIMALS AND PLANTS.\n\nA\n\nAn elementary knowledge of the principles underlying the classification of animals and plants is essential to the beginner in the study of fossils.\n\nThe Naming of Animals.—\n\nIn order to make a clearly understood reference to an animal, or the remains of one, it is as necessary to give it a name as it is in the case of a person or a place. Before the time of Linnaeus (1707-1778), it was the custom to refer, for example, to a shell, in Latin[2] as “the little spiral shell, with cross markings and tubercles, like a ram’s horn;” or to a worm as “the rounded worm with an elevated back.” Improvements in this cumbersome method of naming were made by several of the earlier authors by shortening the description; but no strict rule was established until the tenth edition of Linnaeus’ “Systema Naturae” (1758), when that author instituted his binomial nomenclature by giving each « 35 » form enumerated both a generic and specific name. In plain words, this method takes certain life-forms closely related, but differing in minute particulars, and places them together in a genus or kindred group. Thus the true dogs belong to the genus Canis, but since this group also includes wolves, jackals, and foxes, the various canine animals are respectively designated by a specific name; thus the dog (Canis familiaris), the dingo (C. dingo), the wolf (C. lupus), the jackal (C. aureus), and the fox (C. vulpes). The generic name is placed first. Allied genera are grouped in families, (for example, Canidae), these into orders (ex. Carnivora), the orders into classes (ex. Mammalia), and the classes into phyla or subkingdoms (ex. Vertebrata).\n\nPlants are classified in much the same way, with the exception that families and orders are, by some authors, regarded as of equal value, or even reversed in value; and instead of the term phylum the name series is used.\n\nClassification of the Animal Kingdom.\n\nNAME OF PHYLUM. FORMS FOUND FOSSIL I.— PROTOZOA Foraminifera, Radiolaria. II.— COELENTERATA Sponges, Corals, Stromatoporoids, Graptolites. III.— ECHINODERMATA Crinoids, Starfishes, Brittle-stars, Sea-urchins. IV.— VERMES Worms (tube-making and burrowing kinds). V.— MOLLUSCOIDEA Polyzoa or Sea-mats, Brachiopods or Lamp-shells. VI.— MOLLUSCA Shell-fish: as Bivalves, Tusk-shells, Chitons or Mail-shells, Gasteropods or Snails, Pteropods or Sea-butterflies; Cuttle-fishes. VII.— ARTHROPODA Joint-footed animals: as Trilobites, Cyprids, Crabs and Lobsters, Centipedes, Spiders and Insects. « 36 » VIII.— VERTEBRATA Fishes, Amphibians, Reptiles, Birds and Mammals.\n\nClassification of Animal Kingdom.\n\nThe first seven groups of the above classification are back-boneless animals or Invertebrata; the eighth division alone comprising the animals with a vertebra or backbone.\n\nCharacters of the Several Phyla.—\n\nIn the first group are placed those animals which, when living, consist of only one cell, or a series of similar cells, but where the cells were never combined to form tissues having special functions, as in the higher groups.\n\nPROTOZOA.—\n\nThe Amoeba of freshwater ponds is an example of such, but owing to its skin or cortex being soft, and its consequent inability to be preserved, it does not concern us here. There are, however, certain marine animals of this simple type of the Protozoa which secrete carbonate of lime to form a chambered shell (Foraminifera); or silica to form a netted and concentrically coated shell held together with radial rods (Radiolaria); and both of these types are found abundantly as fossils. They are mainly microscopic, except in the case of the nummulites and a few other kinds of foraminifera, which are occasionally as large as a crown piece.\n\n« 37 »\n\nCOELENTERATA.—\n\nThe second group, the Coelenterata, shows a decided advance in organisation, for the body is multicellular, and provided with a body-cavity which serves for circulation and digestion. The important divisions of this group, in which the organisms have hard parts capable of being fossilised, are the limy and flinty Sponges, the Corals, and allied groups, as well as the delicate Graptolites which often cover the surface of the older slates with their serrated, linear forms, resembling pieces of fret-saws.\n\nECHINODERMATA.—\n\nThe third group, Echinodermata, comprises the Sea-lilies (Crinoids), Starfishes and Sea-urchins, besides a few other less important types; and all these mentioned are found living at the present day. Their bodies are arranged in a radial manner, the skin being strengthened by spicules and hardened by limy deposits ultimately forming plates. They have a digestive canal and a circulatory system, and are thus one remove higher than the preceding group.\n\nVERMES.—\n\nThe fourth group, Vermes (Worms), are animals with a bilateral or two-sided body, which is sometimes divided into segments, but without jointed appendages. Those which concern the student of fossils are the tube-making worms, the errant or wandering worms which form casts like the lob-worm, and the burrowing kinds whose crypts or dwellings become filled with solid material derived from the surrounding mud.\n\n« 38 »\n\nMOLLUSCOIDEA.—\n\nGroup five, the Molluscoidea, contains two types; the Flustras or Sea-mats (Polyzoa) and the Lamp-shells (Brachiopoda). They are at first sight totally unlike; for the first-named are colonies of compound animals, and the second are simple, and enclosed between two valves. They show in common, however, a bilateral symmetry. The mouth is furnished with fine tentacles, or with spirally rolled hair-like or ciliated processes.\n\nMOLLUSCA.—\n\nThe sixth group, the Mollusca, includes all shell-fish. They are soft-bodied, bilaterally symmetrical animals, without definite segments. The shells, on account of being formed of carbonate of lime on an organic basis, are often found preserved in fossiliferous strata.\n\nARTHROPODA.—\n\nThe seventh group, the Arthropoda, or joint-footed animals, are distinguished by their segmented, lateral limbs, and by having a body composed of a series of segments or somites. The body and appendages are usually protected by a horny covering, the ‘exoskeleton.’ The group of the Trilobites played an important part in the first era of the formation of the earth’s crust; whilst the other groups were more sparsely represented in earlier geological times, but became more and more predominant until the present day.\n\nVERTEBRATA.—\n\nThe great group of the Vertebrata comes last, with its chief characteristic of the backbone structure, which advances in complexity from the Fishes to the Higher Mammals.\n\n« 39 »\n\nA Simplified Classification of the Vegetable Kingdom.\n\nSERIES. FORMS FOUND FOSSIL. I.— THALLOPHYTA Sea-weeds: as Corallines and Calcareous Algae. II.— BRYOPHYTA Mosses, Liverworts. III.— PTERIDOPHYTA Fern-like plants, as Horse-tails, Club-mosses and true Ferns. IV.— PTERIDOSPERMEAE Oldest Seed-bearing plants, with fern-like foliage. V.— GYMNOSPERMEAE Plants with naked seeds, as Cycads (Fern-palms), Ginkgo (Maiden-hair Tree), and Conifers (Pine trees). VI.— ANGIOSPERMEAE Flowering plants, as Grasses, Lilies and all ordinary trees and plants.\n\nCharacters of the Plant Series.\n\nTHALLOPHYTA.—\n\nThe first series, the Thallophytes, are simple unicellular plants, and occupy the same position in the vegetable kingdom as the Protozoa do in the animal kingdom. Fossil remains of these organisms seem to be fairly well distributed throughout the entire geological series, but, owing to the soft structure of the fronds in most of the types, it is often a matter of doubt whether we are dealing with a true thallophyte or not. Many of the so-called sea-weeds (fucoids) may be only trails or markings left by other organisms, as shell-fish and crustaceans.\n\nBRYOPHYTA.—\n\nThe second series, the Bryophytes or moss plants, are represented in the fossil state by a few unimportant examples.\n\n« 40 »\n\nPTERIDOPHYTA.—\n\nThe third series, the Pteridophytes, includes the Ferns found from the Devonian up to the present day, Horse-tails and allied forms, like Equisetites, and the Club-mosses and Lepidodendron of the Carboniferous period in various parts of the world.\n\nPTERIDOSPERMEAE.—\n\nThe fourth series, the Pteridospermeae, comprises some of the earliest seed-bearing plants, as Alethopteris and Neuropteris. They occur in rocks of Upper Palaeozoic age as far as known.\n\nGYMNOSPERMEAE.\n\nThe fifth series, the Gymnospermeae, contains the most important types of plants found fossil, especially those of the primary and secondary rocks: they were more abundant, with the exception of the Coniferae, in the earlier than in the more recent geological periods.\n\nANGIOSPERMEAE.—\n\nThe sixth series, the Angiospermeae, comprises all the Flowering Trees and Plants forming the bulk of the flora now living, and is divided into the kinds having single or double seed-leaves (Monocotyledones the Dicotyledones respectively). This important group came into existence towards the close of the Cretaceous period simultaneously with the higher mammals, and increased in abundance until modern times.\n\n« 41 »\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE GEOLOGICAL EPOCHS: AND THE TIME RANGE OF FOSSILS.\n\nSuperposition of Strata.—\n\nF\n\nFossils are chiefly found in rocks which have been formed of sediments laid down in water, such as sandstone, shale and most limestones. These rocks, broadly speaking, have been deposited in a horizontal position, though really slightly inclined from shore to deep-water. One layer has been formed above another, so that the oldest layer is at the bottom, and the newest at the top, of the series (Fig. 11). Let us, for instance, examine a cliff showing three layers: the lower, a sandstone, we will Call A; the intermediate, a shale or clay bed, B; and the uppermost, a limestone or marl, C (Fig. 12). In forming a conclusion about the relative ages of the beds, we shall find that A is always older than B, and B than C, provided no disturbance of the strata has taken place. For instance, the beds once horizontally deposited may have been curved and folded over, or even broken and thrust out of place, within limited areas; but occurrences like these are extremely rare. Moreover, an examination of the surrounding country, or of deep cuttings in the neighbourhood, will tell us if there is any probability of this inversion of strata having taken place.\n\n« 42 »\n\n« 43 »\n\nThis law of superposition holds good throughout the mass of sedimentary rocks forming the crust of the earth.\n\n(1). Thus, the position of the strata shows the relative ages of the beds.\n\nDifferences in Fossil Faunas.—\n\nTurning once again to our ideal cliff section, if we examine the fossils obtained from bed A, we shall find them differing in the number of kinds or species common to the other beds above and below. Thus, there will be more species alike in beds A and B or in B and C. In other words the faunas of A and B are more nearly related than those of A and C. This is explained by the fact that there is a gradual change in specific forms as we pass through the time series of strata from below upwards; so that the nearer one collecting platform is to another, as a rule, the stronger is the community of species.\n\nGuide Fossils.—\n\nCertain kinds of fossils are typical of particular formations. They are known as guide fossils, and by their occurrence help us to gain some idea of the approximate age of rocks widely separated by ocean and continent. Thus we find fossils typical of the Middle Devonian rocks in Europe, which also occur in parts of Australia, and we therefore conclude that the Australian rocks containing those particular fossils belong to the same formation, and are nearly of the same age.\n\n(2). The included fossils, therefore, give evidence of the age of the beds.\n\n« 44 »\n\nValue of Lithological Evidence.—\n\nThe test of age by rock-structure has a more restricted use, but is of value when taken in conjunction with the sequence of the strata and the character of their included fossils.\n\nTo explain both the valuable and the uncertain elements of this last method as a determinant of age, we may cite, for instance, the Upper Ordovician slates of Victoria and New South Wales as an example of uniform rock formation; whilst the yellow mudstones and the grey limestones of the Upper Silurian (Yeringian series) of the same states, are instances of diverse lithological structures in strata of similar age. A reference in the latter case to the assemblages of fossils found therein, speedily settles the question.\n\n(3). Hence, the structure and composition of the rocks (lithology), gives only partial evidence in regard to age.\n\nStrata Vertically Arranged.—\n\nThe Stratigraphical Series of fossiliferous sediments comprises bedded rocks from all parts of the world, which geologists arrange in a vertical column according to age.\n\nA general computation of such a column for the fossiliferous rocks of Europe gives a thickness of about 14 miles. This is equivalent to a mass of strata lying edgewise from Melbourne to Ringwood. The Australian sediments form a much thicker pile of rocks, for they can hardly fall short of 37 miles, or nearly the distance from Melbourne to Healesville.\n\n« 45 »\n\nThis vertical column of strata was formed during three great eras of time. The oldest is called the Primary or Palaeozoic (“ancient life”), in which the animals and plants are of primitive types. This is followed by the Secondary or Mesozoic (“middle life”), in which the animals and plants are intermediate in character between the Palaeozoic and the later, Cainozoic. The third era is the Tertiary or Cainozoic (“recent life”), in which the animals and plants are most nearly allied to living forms. These great periods are further subdivided into epochs, as the Silurian epoch; and these again into stages, as the Yeringian stage.\n\nVertical Column of Fossiliferous Strata, Australia.\n\nERA.

The writer has obtained further evidence to support these conclusions from special studies in the groups of the cetacea, mollusca and the protozoa. The alternative classification of the cainozoics as given by one or two later authors, introducing the useful local terminology of Hall and Pritchard for the various stages or assises is as follows:—\n\nTATE AND DENNANT.\n\nStages.

Australia, New South Wales and Queensland as of Upper Devonian age. There is no doubt, from a broad view of the whole question as to the respective age of these beds in Australia, that the one series is continuous, and probably represents the Upper Devonian and the Lower Carboniferous of the northern hemisphere.\n\n4.—These limestones contain a fauna of brachiopods and corals which, at present, seems to point to the series as intermediate between the older Silurian and the Upper Ordovician.\n\n« 49 »\n\nERA.

We will now consider the groups of organisms, one by one, and note the particular parts of each which we may reasonably expect to find in the fossil state.\n\nMAMMALS.—The bones and teeth: as the Diprotodon remains of Lake Callabonna in South Australia (Fig. 14), of West Melbourne Swamp, Victoria, « 52 » and the Darling Downs, Queensland. Rarely the skin, as in the carcases of the frozen Mammoth of the tundras of Northern Siberia; or the dried remains of the Grypotherium of South American caves.\n\n« 53 »\n\nBIRDS:—Bones: as the Moa bones of New Zealand and the Emu bones of the King Island sand-dunes (Fig. 15). Very rarely the impressions of the feathers of birds are found, as in the ironstone occurring in the Wannon district of Victoria (Fig. 16), and others in fine clays and marls on the continent of Europe and in England. Fossil eggs of sea-birds are occasionally found in coastal sand-dunes of Holocene age.\n\nREPTILES.—Skeletons of fossil turtles (Notochelone) are found in Queensland (Fig. 17). Whole skeletons and the dermal armour (spines and bony plates) of the gigantic, specialised reptiles are found in Europe, North America, and in other parts of the world.\n\nFISHES.—Whole skeletons are sometimes found in sand and clay rocks, as in the Trias of Gosford, New South Wales (Fig. 18), and in the Jurassic of South Gippsland. The ganoid or enamel-scaled fishes are common fossils in the Devonian and Jurassic, notably in Germany, Scotland and Canada: and they also occur in the sandy mudstone of the Lower Carboniferous of Mansfield, Victoria.\n\nINSECTS.—Notwithstanding their fragility, insects are often well preserved as fossils, for the reason that their skin and wings consist of the horny substance called chitin. The Tertiary marls of Europe are very prolific in insect remains (Fig. 19). From « 54 » the Miocene beds of Florissant, Colorado, U.S.A., several hundred species of insects have been described.\n\n« 55 »\n\n« 56 »\n\nCRUSTACEA.—The outer crust, or exoskeleton, of these animals is often hard, being formed of a compound of carbonate and phosphate of lime on an organic, chitinous base. The earliest forms of this group were the trilobites, commencing in Cambrian times, and of which there is a good representative series in Australian rocks. Remains of crabs and lobsters are found in the various Cainozoic deposits in Australia (Fig. 20), and also in the Jurassic in other parts of the world.\n\nMOLLUSCA.—The Cuttle-fish group (Cephalopoda, “head-footed”), is well represented by the Nautilus-like, but straight Orthoceras shells commencing in Ordovician times, and, in later periods, by the beautiful, coiled Ammonites (Fig. 21). The true cuttle-fishes possess an internal bone, the sepiostaire, which one may see at the present day drifted on to the sand at high-water mark on the sea-shore. The rod-like Belemnites are of this nature, and occur abundantly in the Australian Cretaceous rocks of South Australia and Queensland (Fig. 22).\n\n« 57 »\n\nElephant-tusk shells (Scaphopoda) are frequent in our Tertiary beds: they are also sparingly found in the Cretaceous, and some doubtful remains occur in the Palaeozoic strata of Australia.\n\nThe shells of the ordinary mollusca, such as the snails, whelks, mussels, and scallops, are abundant in almost all geological strata from the earliest periods. Their calcareous shells form a covering which, after the decay of the animal within, are from their nature among the most easily preserved of fossil remains. There is hardly an estuary bed, lake-deposit, or sea-bottom, but contains a more or less abundant assemblage of these shell-fish remains, or testacea as they were formerly called (“testa,” a shell or potsherd). We see, therefore, the importance of this group of fossils for purposes of comparison of one fauna with another (antea, Fig. 1).\n\nThe chitons or mail-shells, by their jointed nature, consisting of a series of pent-roof-shaped valves united by ligamental tissue, are nearly always represented in the fossil state by separate valves. Fossil examples of this group occur in Australia both in Palaeozoic rocks and, more numerously, in the Cainozoic series.\n\n« 58 »\n\nMOLLUSCOIDEA.—The Brachiopods or Lamp-shells consist generally of two calcareous valves as in the true mollusca (Fig. 23), but are sometimes of horny texture. Like the previous class, they are also easily preserved as fossils. They possess bent, loop-like or spiral arms, called brachia, and by the movement of fine ciliated (hair-like) processes on their outer edges conduct small food particles to the mouth. The brachia are supported by shelly processes, to which are attached, in the Spirifers, delicate spirally coiled ribbons. These internal structures are often beautifully preserved, even though they are so delicate, from the fact that on the death of the animal the commissure or opening round the valves is so tightly closed as to prevent the coarse mud from penetrating while permitting the finer silt, and more rarely mineral matter in solution, to pass, and subsequently to be deposited within the cavity. At the Murray River cliffs in South Australia, a bed of Cainozoic limestone contains many of these brachiopod shells in a unique condition, for the hollow valves have been filled in with a clear crystal of selenite or « 59 » gypsum, through which may be seen the loop or brachial support preserved in its entirety.\n\nThe Sea-mats or Polyzoa, represented by Retepora (the Lace-coral) (Fig. 24) and Flustra (the Sea-mat) of the present sea-shore, have a calcareous skeleton, or zoarium, which is easily preserved as a fossil. Polyzoa are very abundant in the Cainozoic beds of Australia, New Zealand, and elsewhere (Fig. 25). In the Mesozoic series, on the other hand, they are not so well represented; but in Europe and North America they play an important part in forming the Cretaceous and some Jurassic strata by the abundance of their remains.\n\nWORMS (VERMES).—The hard, calcareous tubes of Sea-worms, the Polychaeta (“many bristles”) are often found in fossiliferous deposits, and sometimes form large masses, due to their gregarious habits of life; they also occur attached to shells such as oysters (Fig. 26). The burrows of the wandering worms are found in Silurian strata in Australia; and the sedentary forms likewise occur from the Devonian upwards.\n\nECHINODERMATA.—Sea-urchins (Echinoidea) possess a hard, calcareous, many-plated test or covering and, when living are covered with spines (Fig. 27). Both the tests and spines are found fossil, the former sometimes whole when the sediment has been quietly thrown down upon them; but more frequently, as in the Shepherd’s crown type (Cidaris), are found in disjointed plates, owing to the fact that current action, going on during entombment has caused the plates to separate. The spines are very rarely found attached to the test, more frequently « 60 » being scattered through the marl or sandy clay in which the sea-urchins are buried. The best conditions for the preservation of this group is a marly limestone deposit, in which case the process of fossilisation would be tranquil (Fig. 28).\n\n« 61 »\n\nThe true Starfishes (Asteroidea), are either covered with calcareous plates, or the skin is hardened by rough tubercles; and these more lasting portions are preserved in rocks of all ages. The shape of the animal is also often preserved in an exquisite manner in beds of fine mud or clay.\n\nThe Brittle-stars (Ophiuroidea) have their body covered with hard, calcareous plates. Their remains are found in rocks as old as the Ordovician in Bohemia but their history in Australia begins with the Silurian period (Fig. 29). From thence onward they are occasionally found in successive strata in various parts of the world.\n\nThe bag-like echinoderms (Cystidea) form a rare group, restricted to Palaeozoic strata. The plates of the sack, or theca, and those of the slender arms are calcareous, and are capable of being preserved in the fossil state. A few doubtful remains of this group occur in Australia.\n\nThe bud-shaped echinoderms (Blastoidea) also occur chiefly in Devonian and Carboniferous strata. This is also a rare group, and is represented by several forms found only in New South Wales and Queensland.\n\nThe well known and beautiful fossil forms, the Stone-lilies (Crinoidea) have a very extended geological history, beginning in the Cambrian; whilst a few species are living in the ocean at the present day. The many-jointed skeleton lends itself well to fossilisation, and remains of the crinoids are common in Australia mainly in Palaeozoic strata (Fig. 30). « 62 » In Europe they are found abundantly also in Jurassic strata, especially in the Lias.\n\n« 63 »\n\nHYDROZOA.—The Graptolites (“stone-writing”) have a chitinous skin (periderm) to the body or hydrosome, which is capable of preservation to a remarkable degree; for their most delicate structures are preserved on the surfaces of the fine black mud deposits which subsequently became hardened into slates. In Australia graptolites occur from the base of the Ordovician to the top of the Silurian (Fig. 31).\n\nAnother section of the Hydrozoa is the Stromatoporoidea. These are essentially calcareous, and their structure reminds one of a dense coral. The « 64 » polyps build their tiers of cells (coenosteum) in a regular manner, and seem to have played the same part in the building of ancient reefs in Silurian, Devonian and Carboniferous times as the Millepora at the present day (Fig. 32).\n\nANTHOZOA.—The true Corals have a stony skeleton, and this is capable of easy preservation as a fossil. There is hardly any fossiliferous stratum of importance which has not its representative corals. In Australia their remains are especially abundant in the Silurian, Devonian (Fig. 33), and Carboniferous formations, and again in the Oligocene and Miocene.\n\nSPONGES.—The framework of the sponge may consist either of flinty, calcareous, or horny material (Fig. 34). The two former kinds are well represented in our Australian rocks, the first appearing in the Lower Ordovician associated with graptolites, and « 65 » again in the Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks (Fig. 35); whilst the calcareous sponges are found in Silurian strata, near Yass, and again in the Cainozoic beds of Flinders, Curlewis and Mornington in Victoria.\n\nPROTOZOA.—The important and widely-distributed group of the Foraminifera (“hole-bearers”) belonging to the lowest phylum, the Protozoa, generally possess a calcareous shell. The tests range in size from tiny specks of the fiftieth of an inch in diameter, to the giant Nummulite, equalling a five shilling piece in size (Fig. 36). Their varied and beautiful forms are very attractive, but their great interest lies in their multifarious distribution in all kinds of sediments: they are also of importance because certain of the more complex forms indicate « 66 » distinct life zones, being restricted to particular strata occurring in widely-separated areas.\n\nMembers of the allied order of the Radiolaria have a flinty shell (Fig. 37); and these organisms are often found building up siliceous rocks such as cherts (Fig. 38).\n\nPLANTS.—The harder portions of plants which are found in the fossil state are,—the wood, the coarser vascular (vessel-bearing) tissue of the leaves, and the harder parts of fruits and seeds.\n\nFossil wood is of frequent occurrence in Palaeozoic, Mesozoic and Cainozoic strata in Australia, as, for instance, the wood of the trees called Araucarioxylon and Dadoxylon in the Coal measures of New South Wales (see antea, Fig. 3).\n\n« 67 »\n\n« 68 »\n\nFossil leaves frequently occur in pipe-clay beds, as at Berwick, Victoria, and in travertine from near Hobart, Tasmania (Fig. 39). Fossil fruits are found in abundance in the ancient river gravels at several hundreds of feet below the surface, in the “deep leads” of Haddon, Victoria, and other localities in New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania.\n\n« 69 »\n\nFOSSILIFEROUS ROCKS.\n\nSection I.—ARGILLACEOUS ROCKS.\n\nUnder this head are placed the muds, clays, mudstones, shales and slates. MUDS are usually of a silty nature, that is, containing a variable proportion of sand (quartz) grains. Such are the estuarine muds of Pleistocene and Recent age, containing brackish water foraminifera and ostracoda, and those shells of the mollusca usually found associated with brackish conditions. Lacustrine mud can be distinguished by the included freshwater shells, as Limnaea, Coxiella (brackish), Cyclas and Bulinus, as well as the freshwater ostracoda or cyprids (Fig. 40).\n\nCLAYS are tenacious mud deposits, having the general composition of a hydrous silicate of alumina with some iron. When a clay deposit tends to split into leaves or laminae, either through moderate pressure or by the included fossil remains occupying distinct planes in the rock, they are called SHALES.\n\n« 70 »\n\nClays and Shales of marine origin are often crowded with the remains of mollusca. The shells are sometimes associated with leaves and other vegetable remains, if forming part of an alternating series of freshwater and marine conditions. An example of this type of sediments is seen in the Mornington beds of the Balcombian series in Victoria.\n\nMUDSTONE is a term applied to a hardened clay deposit derived from the alteration of an impure limestone, and is more often found in the older series of rocks. Mudstones are frequently crowded with fossils, but owing to chemical changes within the rock, the calcareous organisms are as a rule represented by casts and moulds. At times these so faithfully represent the surface and cavities of the organism that they are almost equivalent to a well preserved fossil (Fig. 41).\n\nSLATE.—When shale is subjected to great pressure, a plane of regular splitting called cleavage is induced, which is rarely parallel to the bedding plane or surface spread out on the original sea-floor: the cleavage more often taking place at an appreciable angle to the bedding plane. The graptolitic rocks of Victoria are either shales or slates, according to the absence or development of this cleavage structure in the rock.\n\n« 71 »\n\nSection II.—SILICEOUS ROCKS.\n\nIn this group are comprised all granular quartzose sediments, and organic rocks of flinty composition.\n\nSANDSTONES.—Although the base of this type of rock is formed of quartz sand, it often contains fossils. Owing to its porous nature, percolation of water containing dissolved CO2 tends to bring about the solution of the calcareous shells, with the result that only casts of the shells remain.\n\nFLINTS and CHERTS.—These are found in the form of nodules and bands in other strata, principally in limestone. In Europe, flint is usually found in the Chalk formation, whilst chert is found in the Lower Greensands, the Jurassics, the Carboniferous Limestone and in Cambrian rocks. In Australia, flint occurs in the Miocene or Polyzoal-rock formation of Mount Gambier, Cape Liptrap and the Mallee borings. Flint is distinguished from chert by its being black in the mass, often with a white crust, and translucent in thin flakes; chert being more or less granular in texture and sub-opaque in the mass. Both kinds appear to be formed as a pseudomorph or replacement of a portion of the limestone stratum by silica, probably introduced in solution as a soluble alkaline silicate. Both flint and chert often contain fossil shells and other organic remains, such as radiolaria and sponge-spicules, which can be easily seen with a lens in thin flakes struck off by the hammer.\n\n« 72 »\n\nDIATOMITE is essentially composed of the tiny frustules or flinty cases of diatoms (unicellular algae), usually admixed with some spicules of the freshwater sponge, Spongilla. It generally forms a layer at the bottom of a lake bed (Fig. 42).\n\nSection III.—CALCAREOUS ROCKS.\n\nLIMESTONES FORMED BY ORGANISMS.—Organic limestones constitute by far the most important group of fossiliferous rocks. Rocks of this class are composed either wholly of carbonate of lime, or contain other mineral matter also, in varying proportion. Many kinds of limestones owe their origin directly to the agency of animals or plants, which extracted the calcareous matter from the water in « 73 » which they lived in order to build their hard external cases, as for example the sea-urchins; or their internal skeletons, as the stony corals. The accumulated remains of these organisms are generally compacted by a crystalline cement to form a coherent rock.\n\nThe chief groups of animals and plants forming such limestone rocks are:—\n\n(a) FORAMINIFERA.—Example. Foraminiferal limestone as the Nummulitic limestone of the Pyramids of Egypt, or the Lepidocyclina limestone of Batesford, near Geelong, Victoria (Fig. 43).\n\n(b) CORALS.—Ex. “Madrepore limestone,” or Devonian marble, with Pachypora. Also the Lilydale limestone, with Favosites, of Silurian age, Victoria (Fig. 44).\n\n« 74 »\n\n(c) STONE-LILIES.—Ex. Crinoidal or Entrochial limestone, Silurian, Toongabbie, Victoria (Fig. 45). Also the Carboniferous or Mountain limestone, Derbyshire, England.\n\n(d) WORM-TUBES.--Ex. Serpulite limestone of Hanover, Germany. Ditrupa limestone of Torquay and Wormbete Creek, Victoria.\n\n(e) POLYZOA.—-Ex. Polyzoal limestone, as the so-called Coralline Crag of Suffolk, England; and the Polyzoal Rock of Mount Gambier, S. Australia.\n\n(f) BRACHIOPODA.—Ex. Brachiopod limestone of Silurian age, Dudley, England. Orthis limestone of Cambrian age, Dolodrook River, N. E. Gippsland.\n\n(g) MOLLUSCA.—Ex. Shell limestone, as the Turritella bed of Table Cape, Tasmania, and of Camperdown, Victoria (Fig. 46), or the Purbeck Marble of Swanage, Dorset, England.\n\n« 75 »\n\n(h) OSTRACODA.—Ex. Cypridiferous limestone, formed of the minute valves of the bivalved ostracoda, as that of Durlston, Dorset, England (Fig. 47).\n\n(i) CADDIS FLY LARVAE.—Ex. Indusial limestone, formed of tubular cases constructed by the larvae of the Caddis fly (Phryganea). Occurs at Durckheim, Rhine District, Germany.\n\n(j) RED SEAWEEDS.—Ex. Nullipore limestone, formed by the stony thallus (frond) of the calcareous sea-weed Lithothamnion, as in the Leithakalk, a common building stone of Vienna.\n\n(k) GREEN SEAWEEDS.—Ex. Halimeda limestone, forming large masses of rock in the late Cainozoic reefs of the New Hebrides (Fig. 48).\n\n« 76 »\n\n(l) (?) BLUE-GREEN SEAWEEDS.—Ex. Girvanella limestone, forming the Peagrit of Jurassic age, of Gloucester, England.\n\nSection IV.—CARBONACEOUS and MISCELLANEOUS ROCKS.\n\nCOALS and KEROSENE SHALES (Cannel Coal).—These carbonaceous rocks are formed in much the same way as the deposits in estuaries and lagoon swamps. They result from the sometimes vast aggregation of vegetable material (leaves, wood and fruits), brought down by flooded rivers from the surrounding country, which form a deposit in a swampy or brackish area near the coast, or in an estuary. Layer upon layer is thus formed, alternating with fine mud. The latter effectually seals up the organic layers and renders their change into a carbonaceous deposit more certain.\n\nWhen shale occurs between the coal-layers it is spoken of as the under-clay, which in most cases is the ancient sub-soil related to the coal-layer immediately above. It is in the shales that the best examples of fossil ferns and other plant-remains are often found. The coal itself is composed of a partially decomposed mass of vegetation which has become hardened and bedded by pressure and gradual drying.\n\nSpore coals are found in thick deposits in some English mines, as at Burnley in Yorkshire. They result from the accumulation of the spores of giant club-mosses which flourished in the coal-period. They « 77 » are generally referred to under the head of Cannel Coals. The “white coal” or Tasmanite of the Mersey Basin in Tasmania is an example of an impure spore coal with a sandy matrix (Fig. 49).\n\nThe Kerosene Shale of New South Wales is related to the Torbanite of Scotland and Central France. It « 78 » occurs in lenticular beds between the bituminous coal. It is a very important deposit, commercially speaking, for it yields kerosene oil, and is also used for the manufacture of gas. The rock is composed of myriads of little cell-bodies, referred to as Reinschia, and first supposed to be allied to the freshwater alga, Volvox; but this has lately been questioned, and an alternative view is that they may be the megaspores of club-mosses (Fig. 50).\n\nThe coals of Jurassic age in Australia are derived from the remains of coniferous trees and ferns; and some beautiful examples of these plants may often be found in the hardened clay or shale associated with the coal seams.\n\nThe Brown Coals of Cainozoic or Tertiary age in Australia are still but little advanced from the early stage, lignite. The leaves found in them are more or less like the present types of the flora. The wood is found to be of the Cypress type (Cupressinoxylon). In New Zealand, however, important deposits of coal of a more bituminous nature occur in the Oligocene of Westport and the Grey River Valley, in the Nelson District.\n\nBONE BEDS.—The bones and excreta of fish and reptiles form considerable deposits in some of the sedimentary formations; especially those partly under the influence of land or swamp conditions. They constitute a kind of conglomerate in which are found bone-fragments and teeth (Fig. 51). These bone-beds are usually rich in phosphates, and are consequently valuable as a source of manure. The Miocene bone-bed with fish teeth at Florida, U.S.A., « 79 » is a notable example. The nodule bed of the Victorian Cainozoics contains an assemblage of bones of cetaceans (whales, etc.).\n\nBONE BRECCIAS.—These are usually formed of the remains of the larger mammals, and consist of a consolidated mass of fragments of bones and teeth embedded in a calcareous matrix. Bone-breccias are of frequent occurrence on the floors of caves which had formerly been the resort of carnivorous animals, and into which they dragged their prey. The surface water percolating through the overlying calcareous strata dissolved a certain amount of lime, and this was re-deposited on the animal remains lying scattered over the cave floor. A deposit so formed constitutes a stalagmite or floor encrustation. As examples of bone-breccias we may refer to the limestone at Limeburners Point, Geelong (Fig. 52); and the stalagmitic deposits of the Buchan Caves.\n\n« 80 »\n\nIRONSTONE.—Rocks formed almost entirely of limonite (hydrated peroxide of iron) are often due to the agency of unicellular plants known as diatoms, which separate the iron from water, and deposit it as hydrous peroxide of iron within their siliceous skeletons. In Norway and Sweden there are large and important deposits of bog iron-ore, which have presumably been formed in the beds of lakes.\n\nClay ironstone nodules (sphaerosiderite) have generally been formed as accretions around some « 81 » decaying organic body. Many clay ironstone nodules, when broken open, reveal a fossil within, such as a coprolitic body, fern frond, fir-cone, shell or fish.\n\nOolitic ironstones are composed of minute granules which may have originally been calcareous grains, formed by a primitive plant or alga, but since replaced by iron oxide or carbonate.\n\nThe Tertiary ironstone of western Victoria is found to contain leaves, which were washed into lakes and swamps (Fig. 53); and the ferruginous groundmass may have been originally due to the presence of diatoms, though this yet remains to be proved.\n\n« 82 »\n\nPART II.—SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY.\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nFOSSIL PLANTS.\n\nCambrian Plants.—\n\nT\n\nThe oldest Australian plant-remains belong to the genus Girvanella. This curious little tubular unicellular organism, once thought to be a foraminifer, shows most affinity with the blue-green algae (Cyanophyceae), an important type of plant even now forming calcareous deposits such as the calcareous grains on the shores of the Salt Lake, Utah, and the pea-grit of the Carlsbad hot springs. Girvanella problematica occurs in the Lower Cambrian limestones of South Australia, at Ardrossan and elsewhere.\n\nSilurian Plants.—\n\nAmongst Silurian plants may be mentioned the doubtful sea-weeds known as Bythotrephis. Their branch-like impressions are fairly common in the mudstones of Silurian age found in and around Melbourne. They generally occur in association with shallow-water marine shells and crustacea of that period.\n\nThe genus Girvanella before mentioned is also found in the Silurian (Yeringian) of Lilydale and the Tyers River limestone, Victoria (Fig. 54).\n\n« 83 »\n\nHaliserites is a primitive plant of the type of the club-mosses so common in the rocks of the Carboniferous period. This genus is found in some abundance in the Yeringian stage of the Silurian in Gippsland (Fig. 55).\n\nFig. 55—PALAEOZOIC PLANTS.\n\n(Approximate dimensions in fractions).\n\n« 84 »\n\n« 85 »\n\nFig. 58—UPPER PALAEOZOIC PLANTS.\n\nDevonian and Carboniferous Plants.—\n\nPlant-life was not abundant, however, until Upper Devonian and Carboniferous times. In the rocks of these periods we meet with the large strap-shaped leaves of Cordaites and a fern, Sphenopteris, in the first-named series; and the widely distributed Lepidodendron with its handsome lozenge-scarred stems in the later series (Fig. 56). Cordaites has been found in Victoria in the Iguana Creek beds (Upper Devonian), and it also probably occurs at the same horizon at Nungatta, New South Wales. Lepidodendron occurs in the Lower Carboniferous sandstone of Victoria and Queensland (Fig. 57): in New South Wales it is found at Mt. Lambie, Goonoo, Tamworth and Copeland in beds generally regarded as Upper « 86 » Devonian. Both of these plants are typical of Carboniferous (Coal Measure) beds in Europe and North America. The fern Rhacopteris is characteristic of Upper Carboniferous shales and sandstones near Stroud, and other localities in New South Wales as well as in Queensland (Fig. 58). These beds yield a few inferior seams of coal. Girvanella is again seen in the oolitic limestones of Carboniferous age in Queensland and New South Wales.\n\nCarbopermian Plants.—\n\nThe higher division of the Australian Carboniferous usually spoken of as the Permo-carboniferous, and here designated the Carbopermian (see Footnote 2, page 48), is typified by a sudden accession of plant forms, chiefly belonging to ferns of the Glossopteris type. The lingulate or tongue-shaped fronds of this genus, with their characteristic reticulate venation, are often found entirely covering the slabs of shale intercalated with the coal seams of New South Wales; and it is also a common fossil in Tasmania and Western Australia. The allied form, Gangamopteris, which is distinguished from Glossopteris by having no definite midrib, is found in beds of the same age in Victoria, New South Wales, and Tasmania. These plant remains are also found in India, South Africa, South America and the Falkland Islands. This wide distribution of such ancient ferns indicates that those now isolated land-surfaces were once connected, forming an extensive continent named by Prof. Suess “Gondwana-Land,” from the Gondwana district in India (Fig. 59).\n\n« 87 »\n\nE. M. del. (After J. W. Gregory). Fig. 59—Map of the World in the Upper Carboniferous Era.\n\n« 88 »\n\nTriassic Plants.—\n\nThe widely distributed pinnate fern known as Thinnfeldia is first found in the Trias; in the Narrabeen shales near Manly, and the Hawksbury sandstone at Mount Victoria, New South Wales. It is also a common fossil of the Jurassic of South Gippsland, and other parts of Victoria. The grass-like leaves of Phoenicopsis are frequently met with in Triassic strata, as in the upper series at Bald Hill, Bacchus Marsh, and also in Tasmania. The large Banana-palm-like leaves of Taeniopteris (Macrotaeniopteris) are common to the Triassic and Lower Jurassic beds of India: they are also met with in New Zealand, and in the upper beds at Bald Hill, Bacchus Marsh.\n\nFig. 60—MESOZOIC PLANTS.\n\n« 89 »\n\nJurassic Plants.—\n\nThe Jurassic flora of Australasia is very prolific in plant forms. These range from liverworts and horse-tails to ferns and conifers. The commonest ferns were Cladophlebis, Sphenopteris, Thinnfeldia and Taeniopteris. The conifers are represented by Araucarites (cone-scales, leaves and fruits), Palissya and Brachyphyllum (Fig. 60). The Ginkgo or Maiden-hair tree, which is still living in China and Japan, and also as a cultivated plant, was extremely abundant in Jurassic times, accompanied by the related genus, Baiera, having more deeply incised leaves; both genera occur in the Jurassic of S. Gippsland, Victoria, and in Queensland. The Jurassic flora of Australasia is in many respects like that of the Yorkshire coast near Scarborough. In New Zealand this flora is represented in the Mataura series, in which there are many forms identical with those of the Australian Jurassic, and even of India.\n\nCretaceous Plants.—\n\nAn upper Cretaceous fern, (?) Didymosorus gleichenioides, is found in the sandstones of the Croydon Gold-field, North Queensland.\n\nPlants of the Cainozoic.—Balcombian Stage.—\n\nThe older part of the Cainozoic series in Australasia may be referred to the Oligocene. These are marine beds with occasional, thick seams of lignite, and sometimes of pipe-clay with leaves, the evidence of river influence in the immediate neighbourhood. The fossil wood in the lignite beds appears to be a Cupressinoxylon or Cypress wood. Leaves referable « 90 » to plants living at the present day are also found in certain clays, as at Mornington, containing Eucalyptus precoriacea and a species of Podocarpus.\n\nFig. 61—CAINOZOIC PLANTS.\n\nMiocene Leaf-beds.—Janjukian Stage.—\n\nLater Cainozoic deposits, evidently accumulated in lakes, and sometimes ferruginous, may be referred to the Miocene. They are comparable in age with the Janjukian marine beds of Spring Creek and Waurn Ponds in Victoria. These occur far inland and occupy distinct basins, as at the Wannon, Bacchus Marsh (Maddingley), and Pitfield Plains. Leaf-beds of this age occur also on the Otway coast, Victoria, containing the genera Coprosmaephyllum, Persoonia and Phyllocladus. In all probability the Dalton and « 91 » Gunning leaf-beds of New South Wales belong here. Examples of the genera found in beds of this age are Eucalyptus (a species near E. amygdalina), Banksia or Native Honeysuckle, Cinnamomum or Cinnamon, Laurus or Laurel, and Fagus (Notofagus) or Beech (Fig. 61). In the leaf-beds covered by the older basalt on the Dargo High Plains, Gippsland, leaves of the Ginkgo Murrayana occur.\n\nIn South Australia several occurrences of leaf beds have been recorded, containing similar species to those found in the Cainozoic of Dalton and Vegetable Creek, New South Wales. For example, Magnolia Brownii occurs at Lake Frome, Bombax Sturtii and Eucalyptus Mitchelli at Elizabeth River, and Apocynophyllum Mackinlayi at Arcoona.\n\nFruits of the “Deep Leads.”—\n\nThe Deep Leads of Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania probably begin to date from the period just named, for they seem to be contemporaneous with the “Older Gold Drift” of Victoria; a deposit sometimes containing a marine fauna of Janjukian age. This upland river system persisted into Lower Pliocene times, and their buried silts yield many fruits, of types not now found in Australia, such as Platycoila, Penteune and Pleioclinis, along with Cupressus (Spondylostrobus) and Eucalyptus of the existing flora (Fig. 62).\n\nPleistocene Plants.—\n\nThe Pleistocene volcanic tuffs of Mount Gambier have been shown to contain fronds of the living Pteris (Pteridium) aquilina or Bracken fern, and a Banksia in every way comparable with B. marginata, a « 92 » species of the Native Honeysuckle still living in the same district.\n\nThe siliceous valves of freshwater diatoms constitute the infusorial earths of Victoria, Queensland, New South Wales and New Zealand. The commonest genera met with are Melosira, Navicula, Cymbella (or Cocconema), Synedra, Tabellaria, Stauroneis and « 93 » Gomphonema. They are, generally speaking, of Pleistocene age, as they are often found filling hollows in the newer basalt flows. In Victoria diatomaceous earths are found at Talbot (See Fig. 42), Sebastopol and Lancefield; in Queensland, at Pine Creek; in New South Wales, at Cooma, Barraba, and the Richmond River; and in New Zealand at Pakaraka, Bay of Islands. In the latter country there is also a marine diatomaceous rock in the Oamaru Series, of Miocene age.\n\nCOMMON OR CHARACTERISTIC FOSSILS OF THE FOREGOING CHAPTER.\n\nGirvanella problematica, Nicholson and Etheridge.

The former group, Protozoa, have all their functions performed by means of a simple cell, any additions to the cell-unit merely forming a repetitional or aggregated cell-structure. A familiar example of such occurs in pond-life, in the Amoeba, a form which is not found fossilised on account of the absence of any hard parts or covering capable of preservation. Foraminifera and Radiolaria, however, have such hard parts, and are frequently found fossilised.\n\nForaminifera: Their Habitats.—\n\nThe FORAMINIFERA are a group which, although essentially one-celled, have the protoplasmic body often numerously segmented. The shell or test formed upon, and enclosing the jelly-like sarcode, may consist either of carbonate of lime, cemented sand-grains, or a sub-calcareous or chitinous (horny) covering. The Foraminifera, with very few exceptions, as Mikrogromia, Lieberkuehnia, and some forms of Gromia, are all marine in habit. Some « 96 » genera, however, as Miliolina, Rotalia and Nonionina, affect brackish water conditions.\n\nSince Foraminifera are of so lowly a grade in the animal kingdom, we may naturally expect to find their remains in the oldest known rocks that show any evidence of life. They are, indeed, first seen in rocks of Cambrian age, although they have not yet been detected there in Australian strata.\n\nCambrian Foraminifera.—\n\nIn parts of Siberia and in the Baltic Provinces, both Cambrian and Ordovician rocks contain numerous glauconite casts of Foraminifera, generally of the Globigerina type of shell. In England some Middle Cambrian rocks of Shropshire are filled with tiny exquisitely preserved spiral shells belonging to the genus Spirillina, in which all the characters of the test are seen as clearly as in the specimens picked out of shore-sand at the present day.\n\nSilurian Foraminifera.—\n\nThe Silurian rocks in all countries are very poor in foraminiferal shells, only occasional examples being found. In rocks of this age at Lilydale, Victoria, the genus Ammodiscus, with fine sandy, coiled tests, is found in the Cave Hill Limestone.\n\nSo far as known, hardly any forms of this group occur in Devonian strata, although some ill-defined shells have been found in the Eifel, Germany.\n\nCarboniferous Foraminifera.—\n\nThe Carboniferous rocks in many parts of the world yield an abundant foraminiferal fauna. Such, for instance, are the Saccammina and Endothyra Limestones of the North of England and the North « 97 » of Ireland. The Australian rocks of this age have not afforded any examples of the group, since they are mainly of estuarine or freshwater origin.\n\nFig. 63—PALAEOZOIC and MESOZOIC FORAMINIFERA.\n\nCarbopermian Foraminifera.—\n\nIn Australia, as at Pokolbin, New South Wales, in the Mersey River district, Tasmania, and in the Irwin River district, Western Australia, the Permian rocks, or “Permo-carboniferous” as they are generally called, often contain beds of impure limestone crowded with the chalky white tests of Nubecularia: other interesting genera occur at the first named locality as Pelosina, Hyperammina, Haplophragmium, Placopsilina, Lituola, Thurammina, Ammodiscus, Stacheia, Monogenerina, Valvulina, Bulimina, « 98 » (?)Pleurostomella, Lagena, Nodosaria, Frondicularia, Geinitzina, Lunucammina, Marginulina, Vaginulina, Anomalina and Truncatulina. The sandy matrix of certain Glossopteris leaf-beds in the Collie Coal measures in W. Australia have yielded some dwarfed examples belonging to the genera Bulimina, Endothyra, Valvulina, Truncatulina and Pulvinulina; whilst in the Irwin River district similar beds contain Nodosaria and Frondicularia (Fig. 63).\n\nTriassic Foraminifera.—\n\nThe Triassic and Rhaetic clays of Europe occasionally show traces of foraminiferal shells, probably of estuarine habitat, as do the Wianamatta beds of New South Wales, which also belong to the Triassic epoch. The Australian representatives are placed in the genera Nubecularia, Haplophragmium, Endothyra, Discorbina, Truncatulina, and Pulvinulina. These shells are diminutive even for foraminifera, and their starved condition indicates uncongenial environment.\n\nJurassic Foraminifera.—\n\nThe Jurassic limestones of Western Australia, at Geraldton, contain many species of Foraminifera, principally belonging to the spirally coiled and slipper-shaped Cristellariae. Other genera present are Haplophragmium, Textularia, Bulimina, Flabellina, Marginulina, Vaginulina, Polymorphina, Discorbina, and Truncatulina.\n\nCretaceous Foraminifera.—\n\nIn the Lower Cretaceous rocks known as the Rolling Downs Formation in Queensland, shells of the Foraminifera are found in some abundance at Wollumbilla. They are represented chiefly by Cristellaria and Polymorphina.\n\n« 99 »\n\nCainozoic Foraminifera.—\n\nThe Cainozoic strata in all parts of the world are very rich in Foraminifera, and the genera, and even many species are similar to those now found living. Certain types, however, had a restricted range, and are therefore useful as indicators of age. Such are the Nummulites and the Orbitoides of the Eocene and the Oligocene of Europe, India and the West Indies; and the Lepidocyclinae of the Miocene of Europe, India, Japan and Australia (Fig. 64).\n\n« 100 »\n\nThe genus Lepidocyclina is typically represented in the Batesford beds near Geelong, Victoria by L. tournoueri, a fossil of the Burdigalian stage (Middle Miocene) in Europe, as well as by L. marginata. A limestone with large, well-preserved tests of the same genus, and belonging to a slightly lower horizon in the Miocene has lately been discovered in Papua.\n\nFig. 65—CAINOZOIC FORAMINIFERA.\n\nSome of the commoner Foraminifera found in the Cainozoic beds of Southern Australia are—Miliolina vulgaris, Textularia gibbosa, Nodosaria affinis, Polymorphina elegantissima, Truncatulina ungeriana and Amphistegina lessonii (Fig. 65). The first-named has a chalky or porcellanous shell; the second a sandy test; the third and fourth glassy or hyaline shells with excessively fine tubules; the fifth a glassy shell « 101 » with numerous surface punctations due to coarser tubules than usual in the shell-walls; whilst the last-named has a smooth, lenticular shell, also hyaline, and occurring in such abundance as often to constitute a foraminiferal rock in itself.\n\nPleistocene Foraminifera.—\n\nThe estuarine deposits of Pleistocene age in southern Australia often contain innumerable shel"
