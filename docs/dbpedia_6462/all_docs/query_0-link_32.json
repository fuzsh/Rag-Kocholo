        "text": "RAIL COMMISSIONER BILL\n\nIntroduction and First Reading\n\nReceived from the House of Assembly and read a first time.\n\nSecond Reading\n\nThe Hon. G.E. GAGO (Minister for State/Local Government Relations, Minister for the Status of Women, Minister for Consumer Affairs, Minister for Government Enterprises, Minister Assisting the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Energy) (17:55): I move:\n\nThat this bill be now read a second time.\n\nI seek leave to have the second reading explanation inserted in Hansard without my reading it.\n\nLeave granted.\n\nThe Rail Commissioner Bill 2009 provides for the establishment of the Rail Commissioner for the purpose of acting as a rail transport operator under the Rail Safety Act 2007 for the delivery of State Government rail infrastructure projects and to carry out any other function conferred on the Commissioner by the Minister for Transport.\n\nOne of the Strategic Objectives in the State Government's Strategic Infrastructure Plan is to encourage the shift to rail transport for passenger and freight movements where justified by environmental, economic or social imperatives. The Government has invested approximately $2 Billion over 10 years along with an additional $585 Million of Commonwealth funding contributions to implement this Objective through a number of major and minor rail infrastructure projects, to be delivered through the Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure.\n\nIn late 2007, the State Government determined that it would take responsibility for rail infrastructure assets previously owned by TransAdelaide, and for new major rail infrastructure works proposed on the train and tram network to allow TransAdelaide to concentrate on operating train and tram services. The infrastructure is now vested in the Minister for Transport.\n\nIn September 2008, the Rail Safety Act 2007 was introduced, as part of a process towards a national regulatory scheme for rail safety. The new legislation carries new requirements for those seeking accreditation as a rail transport operator. A person or entity may only seek accreditation under that Act if he or she can establish that he or she has the 'effective management and control' of the proposed railway operations. This requirement is distinguished from the previous Rail Safety Act whereby the test was about merely being an 'owner' or an 'operator'.\n\nThe 2007 Act thereby removed the requirement for contractors to hold accreditation as an 'owner' but rather may perform their duties under the accreditation of the rail transport operator with 'effective management and control' of the proposed railway operations. For the Government, this means that rather than continuing to hire contractors with rail accreditation under the Rail Safety Act 1996 to carry out its business, it had to reconsider and determine who would have the 'effective management and control' of the newly announced rail infrastructure projects.\n\nA statutory body corporate was considered the best option to ensure the required independence from the Minister for Transport.\n\nThe Bill incorporates a number of provisions (particularly in relation to the powers and functions of the Rail Commissioner) that are similar to provisions contained in the Highways Act 1926, the Passenger Transport Act 1994 and the Rail Safety Act 2007. In addition, it should be noted that this Bill is to be read in conjunction with the Rail Safety Act 2007.\n\nThe Rail Commissioner to be established under the Bill will be a body corporate with the statutory imperative to apply for and hold accreditation under the Rail Safety Act 2007. The Rail Commissioner will have the primary function of, and necessary powers to, deliver rail infrastructure projects as announced by the State Government. The Rail Commissioner will have the 'effective management and control' of these rail infrastructure projects, and will be subject to the limited direction of the Minister without derogating from the Rail Commissioner's 'effective management and control' of the projects. The Bill provides for a wider scope of operations to include rolling stock movement and maintenance, including movement for the purpose of operating a railway service. Although these functions will not be used immediately, there may be a requirement for the Rail Commissioner to have rolling stock accreditation for the testing and commissioning of the new trams if it is deemed that the Rail Commissioner has 'effective management and control' of that project.\n\nThe role of the Rail Commissioner at this point in time is to construct and deliver rail infrastructure projects, with the ongoing maintenance and management of the infrastructure being assigned to an appropriate accredited rail entity. This will generally be TransAdelaide, which will continue to act separately as another Government rail transport operator with its own accreditation for track maintenance and management and providing passenger transport services. It is the Government's wish that both the Rail Commissioner and TransAdelaide will work in partnership for the safety of rail in South Australia.\n\nAs an interim arrangement, so that rail construction contracts could be signed and work commenced, Rodney George Hook, the current Deputy Chief Executive of the Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure, was appointed by the Governor, pursuant to section 68 of the Constitution Act 1934, to be the Rail Commissioner with the powers to do all things relevant to the undertaking of rail infrastructure projects for a period of no more than 12 months, or until the Rail Commissioner Bill was enacted, whichever was sooner. Although the appointed Rail Commissioner under the interim arrangement has been exempt from Part 4 Division 2 of the Rail Safety Act 2007 which is the requirement to hold accreditation under that Act, he is required to act 'as if accredited' for the period of the interim appointment.\n\nThe present appointee will also be appointed as Rail Commissioner once the Bill is enacted. The appointment reflects the reporting arrangements in place within the Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure where Mr Hook, as Deputy Chief Executive of the Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure, has effective management and control of the rail infrastructure projects currently being delivered through the Department. The Bill allows for the appointment of one or more Deputy Rail Commissioners. These appointees will assist the Rail Commissioner to demonstrate 'effective management and control' and provide a significant role in the Rail Commissioner's governance structure.\n\nThe Bill provides that, with the approval of the Minister, the Rail Commissioner may make use of staff, equipment or facilities of an administrative unit of the Public Service or another agency or instrumentality of the Crown, under an arrangement with that body. It also specifies the responsibilities of the Rail Commissioner and the Commissioner's staff and gives them the power to undertake all works necessary to deliver the rail infrastructure projects as directed by the Government. The Rail Commissioner will use the resources within the Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure for staffing the office, and undertaking the rail infrastructure project works.\n\nThe Bill provides a structure and process, as well as capacity, to undertake the rail infrastructure projects, including the power to do associated roadworks and install traffic control devices. The Bill provides the Rail Commissioner with a high degree of autonomy when undertaking rail infrastructure projects; however Ministerial approval has been retained in accordance with other relevant statutes.\n\nThese rail infrastructure projects are a significant priority of this Government, and will allow the Government to achieve its Strategic Objective in relation to rail infrastructure for South Australia, particularly within the metropolitan area. The Rail Commissioner as a statutory authority will come under the scrutiny of the South Australian Rail Regulator and the Minister for Transport as required by the Rail Safety Act 2007. This demonstrates the Government's commitment to rail safety, the implementation of the new rail safety legislation as well as ensuring the delivery of safe and efficient transport infrastructure projects meeting the State Government's Strategic Objective for the benefit of commuters and the wider community.\n\nThe opportunity is also being taken in this Bill to rectify a technical irregularity with respect to the authority operating rolling stock on rail infrastructure that has been laid on a road; and with respect to constructing, repairing, altering and maintaining rail infrastructure placed on roads.\n\nThe Bill therefore amends the Railways (Operations and Access) Act 1997 and the TransAdelaide (Corporate Structure) Act 1998 to:\n\nallow rail transport operators to maintain and operate existing rail infrastructure and rolling stock on (as well as over, under, alongside, etc.) roads; and\n\nvalidate the existence of any rail infrastructure installed to date on a road by a rail transport operator; and\n\nenable rail transport operators to install and maintain rail infrastructure and operate on roads in the future with the Minister's approval (absolutely or conditionally).\n\nI commend the Bill to Members.\n\nExplanation of Clauses\n\nPart 1—Preliminary\n\n1—Short title\n\n2—Commencement\n\nThese clauses are formal.\n\n3—Interpretation\n\nThis clause contains definitions for the purposes of the measure.
