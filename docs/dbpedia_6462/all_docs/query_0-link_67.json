A regular service to Moonta began in September 1955 and a month later a Bluebird replaced the regular engine-hauled train to Mount Gambier.\n\nAs additional cars were constructed, their sphere of operation was extended to Port Pirie in 1958, and Terowie and Gladstone in 1959. They also operated to Tailem Bend and Victor Harbor. Unfortunately they were not able to arrest the slow decline in country passenger numbers. Services to Morgan were the first to cease in 1965, followed by Moonta in 1969, Tailem Bend in 1981, Gladstone in 1982 and Victor Harbor in 1984.\n\nAfter the regular Mount Gambier and Broken Hill services were withdrawn on 31st December 1990 the only remaining operation was an intermittent special to Broken Hill which ceased on the 31st.\n\nBack to top\n\nBrill Railcar No. 8\n\nSouth Australian Railways\n\nBroad Gauge\n\nDiesel\n\nClass operators: South Australian Railways\n\nCondition: Good\n\nProvenance: South Australian Railways\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nBuilt by: Brill Car Co, USA\n\nNumber in class: 12\n\nModel: 55 class\n\nEntered service: 9th June 1924\n\nWithdrawn: 1968\n\nEntered the museum: 22nd October 1968\n\nLength (over coupling points): 43’ 5’’ (13.23 metres)\n\nSeating capacity: 43\n\nTare Weight: Petrol: 12 tons 17 cwt (12,863 kilograms) - Diesel: 14 tons 9 cwt (14,457 kilograms)\n\nEarly in his career with the South Australian Railways, Commissioner Webb decreed that small country passenger trains should be replaced by passenger motors. The idea was not new; there had been the Caldwell Vale railcar that operated between Goolwa and Victor Harbor and a small railcar at Port Lincoln but the scale of the replacement was new.\n\nMr Webb did not just order one railcar as had been done before, but he initially ordered a fleet of 12 from the Indiana firm of Service Motors. These petrol railcars came direct from the maker’s order book in which they were listed as ‘Model 55’, the name by which they have been known ever since - to distinguish them from the later Model 75 (see Railcar 41). The earlier railcars were not forgotten in the numbering sequence, and the first of these cars was given the road number 4, the remainder of the class going to 15.\n\nThe first car to be delivered was painted in a special colour scheme of royal blue and lemon yellow. Others came in the more general colour scheme of lined chocolate. The maiden trip was to Willunga, during which run the car was stopped on the steep grade between Hallett Cove and Reynella, and then restarted to demonstrate to the notable passengers the efficiency of the railcar.\n\nDuring the 1930s the original 68 horsepower petrol engines were all removed and replaced by Gardiner 102 horsepower diesel engines, except for No. 7, which was given a Deutz 110 horsepower air-cooled diesel engine.\n\nThe cars were all built for the broad-gauge, but for a time Cars 4 and 10 were active on the narrow-gauge lines in the South East. During this period they were re-numbered 112 and 111 respectively. Generally, the class saw service on most broad-gauge branches, but were not popular because of their very rough riding. They were later relegated to suburban service, and their last years of service were spent providing the shuttle between Glanville and Semaphore, with occasional trips to the city.\n\nFor this service they invariably operated in pairs, using the small automatic couplers with which they had been fitted in 1934. Previously, they had been equipped with small tramway-type link and pin couplers.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the introduction of these small railcars paved the way for an immense change in the style of railway branch line operations in South Australia, and may even be said to have been the only way that some lines were able to be kept open for as long as they were. Their introduction marked the end of the country branch steam passenger train, and the beginning of a line of railcars that was to culminate in the luxurious air-conditioned Bluebird some 30 years later.\n\nBack to top\n\nBrill Railcar No. 41\n\nSouth Australian Railways\n\nBroad Gauge\n\nDiesel\n\nClass operators: South Australian Railways\n\nCondition: Excellent\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nProvenance: South Australian Railways\n\nBuilt by: S.A.R. Islington Workshops\n\nNumber in class: 39\n\nModel: 75\n\nEntered service: 1928\n\nWithdrawn: 1971\n\nEntered the museum: 9th March 1973\n\nLength (over coupling points): 58’ 6’’ (17.83 metres)\n\nTotal Weight: 27 tons (27,000 kilograms)\n\nEngine type: Cummins diesel\n\nSeating capacity: 34\n\nFollowing the introduction of the Model 55 railcars, Mr. Webb decided to introduce a fleet of the larger Brill Model 75 railcars to take over passenger services on the branch lines where lightly-loaded steam-hauled passenger trains were proving to be quite uneconomic.\n\nThe first car, Number 30, was built by the Brill Company in America, but the balance were all built to American plans by the South Australian Railways at Islington. Ultimately, the number series of the cars ranged from 30 to 59 on the broad gauge, with two number 44’s having been built, with the first being sold to the Victorian Railways; and 100 to 106 and 487 on the narrow gauge. A series of trailer cars was also built, being numbered in the 200 series on the broad gauge and in the 300 series on the narrow-gauge.\n\nThese rail cars and trailers were used mainly as intended on the branch lines, but were occasionally used on some main line services such as those to Port Pirie, and also on some off-peak suburban services. Regrettably, these cars were renowned for their rough riding qualities.\n\nAs built, these railcars seated 61, had petrol engines and a series of small windows similar to those of the 55-class. By the end of their lives, most had seen many changes. Six, including 41, were greatly changed in 1940 by the introduction of high-back semi-compartment type seating, which reduced the number of passengers to 34, and the replacement of the small windows by large main line type windows. These cars were promptly nicknamed the \"Milk Bar Cars\" because of the high-back seating.\n\nAll the railcars lost their petrol engines after 1957. Most received Gardiner 198 horsepower diesel engines in their stead, but 41 was one of three to be fitted with Cummins diesel engines. At the same time these railcars were fitted with remote control equipment to allow multiple unit operation.\n\nDuring the 1960s the cars were clearly near the end of their economic lives, and there were some plans made to replace them. However, instead of this happening, there were large-scale closures of country branch lines. This resulted in a need for fewer railcars and the more modern Bluebird air-conditioned cars were able to cope on their own. The last model 75 working was on the 13th October 1971, when 46 and Trailer 216 returned to Adelaide from Victor Harbor.\n\nThe preservation of 41 is thanks to the generosity of Mr. Graham Bettany who, in January 1973, gave the railcar into the care of the Museum. He had earlier purchased it from the South Australian Railways.\n\nBack to top\n\nBudd Railcar CB1\n\nAustralian National Railways\n\nStandard Gauge\n\nClass operators: Commonwealth Railways/Australian National Railways\n\nCondition: Very good\n\nProvenance: Commonwealth Railways & Australian National\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nBuilt by: The Budd Co., Philadelphia, Penn, USA\n\nNumber in class: 3\n\nModel: RDC-1\n\nEntered service: 6th March 1951\n\nWithdrawn: 31st December 1990\n\nEntered the museum: 7th August 1996\n\nLength (over coupling points): 85’ (25.908 metres)\n\nTotal Weight: 49.25 tons (50,038 kilograms)\n\nEngine type: GM 110 x 2 - 2 stroke\n\nCylinders: 6\n\nBore & stroke: 5\" x 5.6\" (127mm x 142mm)\n\nHorsepower: 275hp x 2 (205 kW x 2)\n\nWheel Arrangement: 1A-A1\n\nGear Ratio: 2.08:1\n\nTractive Effort (starting): 8,000 lbs (35.5 kW)\n\nTractive Effort (continuous): 2,000 lbs at 85 mph (8.9 kW)\n\nFuel capacity: 210 gallons (950 litres)\n\nMaximum Speed: 85 mph (136.7 km/h)\n\nAs part of its post war rehabilitation programme the Commonwealth Railways upgraded its short haul passenger services by introducing railcars on the runs between Port Pirie, Port Augusta, and Tarcoola. A contract for the delivery of three air-conditioned railcars was let to the Budd Company, Philadelphia, U.S.A. in October 1950. The railcars arrived in March 1951. They were the standard Budd RDC-1 design, and featured stainless steel bodies and air-conditioning. There were two compartments, with seating for 49 in one and 41 in the other. After entering service buffet facilities were fitted and seating improvements made, reducing the capacity to 70 passengers.\n\nRegular passenger services were introduced from May 1951 when the cars operated between Port Pirie Junction and Pimba. In 1952 the service was extended from Pimba along the military stores siding to the Woomera township. From July 1952 the cars made regular runs to Tarcoola, however this journey involved long stretches of unfenced track and damage was often caused through running down stock and kangaroos. The Budd car service to Tarcoola was discontinued on 25th January 1961, although the service was retained between Port Augusta and Woomera.\n\nCompletion of the new standard gauge line to Marree made it possible for Budd cars to work over that line, at first to Brachina, and ultimately to Marree.\n\nFollowing the opening of the Port Augusta to Whyalla line, Budd rail cars were also introduced on that service.\n\nAlterations in passenger traffic resulted in the cars being removed from service in 1976 and placed in storage until refurbished in 1985 for a new service between Adelaide and Whyalla. The Iron Triangle Limited ran its first regular trip on 21st April 1986. The Iron Triangle Limited was withdrawn from service on 31st December 1990.\n\nRailcar CB1 was donated to the museum by Australian National in 1996.\n\nBack to top\n\nJumbo Railcar Power Car 2006\n\nDepartment of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure\n\nBroad Gauge\n\nClass operators: State Transport Authority/TransAdelaide/Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure\n\nModel: 2000 Class\n\nBuilt by: Comeng\n\nNumber in class: 12\n\nNumber series: 2001 to 2012\n\nHeight: 4.27m\n\nLength (over coupling points): 25.5m\n\nWidth: 3.18m\n\nEngine type: 2x turbocharged Cummins six cylinder underfloor diesel engines\n\nHorsepower: 390 kW (520 horsepower) per engine\n\nTotal Weight: 68 tonnes (67 long tons; 75 short tons)\n\nEntered service: 17th November 1980\n\nMaximum Speed: 140 km/h (87 mph) (conservative) but limited to 90 km/h (56 mph) in service\n\nProvenance: DPTI\n\nSeating capacity: 64\n\nWithdrawn: August 2015\n\nCondemned: August 2015\n\nEntered the museum: 10th July 2016\n\nCondition: Excellent\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nThe 2000 - 2100 class are diesel hydraulic railcars and trailer cars that were built for the then State Transport Authority (STA) by Comeng, for use on the Adelaide metropolitan rail network. The 2000- 2100 class railcars were the first modern suburban railcars in South Australia, and the second in Australia to feature air conditioning, semi-automatic side doors and a PA address system. They were also the last diesel hydraulic type railcars built for a railway operating in South Australia.\n\nThe stainless steel body shell of the 2000 - 2100 class railcars was based on the American Budd SPV-2000, Metroliner and Amfleet car designs. The body shells were built by Comeng, in Granville New South Wales, and were railed to their Adelaide plant at Dry Creek for fitting out internally, except for prototype cars 2001 and 2101 which were completed in New South Wales.\n\nThe first power car (2001) entered service on the 22nd February 1980 and the last power car (2012) entered service on the 18th August 1981.\n\nThe class was dubbed ‘Supertrains’ by the media and the general public, but most railway staff and railway enthusiasts were quick to give them their more iconic nickname ‘Jumbos’. The 2000 - 2100 class railcars earnt this nickname due to their unique raised driving cab, which was very similar in principle to a Boeing 747 Jumbo aircraft.\n\nThe 12 2000 class power cars were originally built with two V12 MAN turbocharged diesel engines. These original diesel engines proved to be poor performers and were replaced by two Cummins turbocharged six cylinder diesel engines. The railcars were usually operated a two-car set (power car-trailer car) or three-car set (trailer car-power car-trailer car) configurations.\n\nIn the mid to late 2000s two 2000 class power cars (2003 and 2006) were refurbished internally and mechanically. From 2010 onwards a large percentage of the 2000 class power cars received the new Adelaide Metro Livery. In February 2014 the 2000 and 2100 railcars were no longer permitted to operate on the Belair and Seaford lines due to electrification of that part of the system. They were formally retired in August 2015. Two power cars and two trailers were preserved, with the remainder of the fleet being scrapped in June 2016.\n\n2000 class power car 2006 entered service on the 17th November 1980 and was withdrawn from service in 2015. During 2007 power car 2006 was refurbished inside and out, and was one of two power cars to be so treated. In June 2016 the Department for Planning, Transport and Infrastructure (DPTI) kindly donated cars 2006 and 2112 to the Museum.\n\nBack to top\n\nJumbo Railcar Trailer Car 2112\n\nDepartment of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure\n\nBroad Gauge\n\nClass operators: State Transport Authority/TransAdelaide/Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure\n\nModel: 2100 Class\n\nBuilt by: Comeng\n\nNumber in class: 18\n\nNumber series: 2101 to 2118\n\nHeight: 4.27m\n\nLength (over coupling points): 25.5m\n\nWidth: 3.18m\n\nTotal Weight: 42 tonnes (39 to 41 long tons; 44 to 46 short tons) empty\n\nEntered service: 17th November 1980\n\nMaximum Speed: 140 km/h (87 mph) (conservative) but limited to 90 km/h (56 mph) in service\n\nProvenance: DPTI\n\nSeating capacity: Passenger seating capacity: 98 (90 in 2112)\n\nWithdrawn: August 2015\n\nCondemned: August 2015\n\nEntered the museum: 10th July 2016\n\nCondition: Excellent\n\nOwnership: Port Dock Station Railway Trust\n\nThe 2000 - 2100 class are diesel hydraulic railcars and trailers that were built for the then State Transport Authority (STA) by Comeng, for use on the Adelaide metropolitan rail network.

Two designs were chosen, the 300 class, with a driving station at one end and the 400 class, which had a driving station at each end.\n\nThe body of each car consisted of a fabricated steel framework to which a steel skin was welded. Original livery was satin maroon body, silver roof and black bogies, though this was later changed to standard suburban red. Fabricated bogies manufactured by the Islington Workshops were used, though some cars did receive converted bogies that had previously been under Overland carriages.\n\nEach compartment in the passenger saloon was fitted with cold cathode fluorescent tubes and low voltage emergency lighting above fixed tubular steel framed seating. Until 1961 vinyl was used for seat covering, with the main colours being cherry red and Flanders blue, but green, brown and grey sometimes appeared. From 1968, to match the green side walls, a special blue-green upholstery was used.\n\nInterior walls were lined with plastic laminate in blue linen, tan linen or plain green. Flooring was either red linoleum or blue-yellow chequer board vinyl tiles.\n\nTraction power was provided by two six-cylinder diesel engines of the lay-over type. A hydraulic torque converter and gearbox connected the drive shaft to each bogie.\n\nA total of 74 units of the 300 class, and 37 of the 400 class were constructed between 1955 and 1971. Nicknamed Red Hens by the public, this type of railcar exclusively ran the Adelaide suburban service until the late 1970s when new railcars were purchased.
