        "text": "Partners that support our work at DCS\n\nWe are very grateful for the vital support all our partners provide.\n\nChaplaincy Service\n\nThe Prison Chaplaincy Service plays an important role in the religious and social welfare needs of prisoners. The service is also complementary to departmental objectives for a safe, secure and humane prison environment.\n\nThe service is led by the Principal Chaplain, who is supported by prison management and around 70 other chaplains who are either specifically trained or qualified, or who are local volunteer chaplains. Pastoral care is provided to prisoners and opportunities are given for worship, personal and spiritual growth, along with religious education.\n\nThe department has continued its commitment to supporting a number of faith based programs including Kairos, Alpha, Positive Lifestyles Program and Seasons for Growth, along with meditation and other faith based initiatives that promote faith, cooperation, wellbeing and human dignity.\n\nIn addition, we have continued a 20 year partnership with Edge Church, including the Life Skills Program at the Adelaide Women’s Prison. This program provides prisoners with access to a range of services and activities including:\n\nhaircuts\n\nchocolate making\n\ncard making workshops\n\njob interview preparation\n\npresentation workshops and\n\na wide range of art classes.\n\nThe providers of faith based services and their communities are acknowledged and thanked by the department for their efforts and their ongoing support.\n\nWe especially thank the regional communities in Cadell, Mount Gambier, Port Lincoln and Port Augusta for their exceptional support.\n\nTAFE SA\n\nWe recently expanded education and training opportunities for prisoners and offenders by forming a partnership with TAFE SA for delivery of a range of new programs.\n\nSouth Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI)\n\nWe have entered into an exciting partnership with the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI) in regards to a Wellbeing and Resilience Program.\n\nWomen’s Health\n\nWe have opened a women’s community reporting centre in partnership with Women’s Health.\n\nHousing SA and OARS Community Transitions\n\nThe Integrated Housing Exits Program (IHEP) commenced following the 2003 Social Inclusion Board Report, ‘Reducing Homelessness in South Australia: Everyone’s Responsibility’. The report identified ‘release from correctional facilities and remand’ as a high impact area for crisis intervention.\n\nAs a result, a partnership was formed between the department, Housing SA and OARS Community Transitions.\n\nWomen’s Centre at the Adelaide Women’s Prison [AWP]\n\nA joint partnership has been formed with:\n\nMossop Construction\n\nTotal Space Design\n\nThe Master Builders Association\n\nThis project is focused on the redevelopment of the Women’s Centre at the Adelaide Women's Prison.\n\nPart of the project is focused on women undertaking accredited training to enable them to participate in construction at the site.\n\nServices for Aboriginal Prisoners and Offenders\n\nThe Aboriginal Services Unit works across the department (at both strategic and operational levels) to provide advocacy for Aboriginal departmental staff, as well as oversee the development of culturally appropriate services, policies and procedures across the department.\n\nThe Unit also actively participates in the growth of partnerships and support for Aboriginal community organisations, and other government departments; and for the provision of targeted services to Aboriginal prisoners, offenders and their families.\n\nAdelaide Pre-release Centre community partnerships\n\nIn the past year $376 000 of value was provided to our communities via our prison-based community services\n\nThis includes work with:\n\nSecond Chances\n\nSalvation Army\n\nthe Greek Orthodox Church.\n\nWork opportunities\n\nThe APC also has established employment partnerships with:\n\nSeaview Joinery\n\nInstallex\n\n628 Blinds\n\nHaigh’s Chocolates\n\nThese partnerships place prisoners into meaningful paid employment and provide stability to assist with their reintegration into the community.\n\nThe prison’s garden also provides employment opportunities for prisoners through the supplying of fresh seasonal vegetables to the state’s prison kitchens.\n\nThe garden has also been a long-standing supporter of FOODBANK SA, and regularly donates substantial quantities of fresh produce for community distribution by charities, churches and even the Adelaide Zoo.\n\nThe Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources\n\nOff-centre employment for female prisoners includes:\n\nThe Parks Preservation Program where prisoners work within the Cleland Wildlife Park\n\nBlackhill Conservation Parks, in partnership with DEWNR\n\nThis program has been very successful, with a number of female prisoners obtaining both qualifications and employment.\n\nGreyhound Racing SA\n\nAs part of our partnership with Greyhound Racing SA up to eight greyhounds at a time are placed in a Greyhound Adoption Program. Prisoners complete the greyhound domestication training program prior to the greyhounds being adopted within the community.\n\nRepay SA Projects\n\nRepay SA projects, funded by DCS, generally comprise of work groups of four to eight offenders who are managed by supervisors.\n\nThese work groups undertake a range of projects throughout the community which involve partnerships with local and state government organisations, and community agencies. Revenue that is generated from some community service activities is reinvested to offset the costs associated with supervising Repay SA programs.\n\nRepay SA partnerships are in place with:\n\nHousing SA\n\nTransport SA\n\nTrans Adelaide\n\nThere are agreements with local councils including:\n\nPlayford\n\nNoarlunga\n\nMarion\n\nMt Barker\n\nSalisbury\n\nThere are also agreements between Repay SA and regional areas such as the Copper Coast and Wakefield Councils.\n\nDCS - SAAFL Prisoner Umpiring program\n\nPartnering with the South Australian Amateur Football League (SAAFL) the department has developed a program to engage prisoners as SAAFL Umpires.\n\nThis program aims to contribute to the rehabilitation of prisoners and to address the shortage of umpires available to officiate local games. One of the most significant factors that can contribute to a reduction in an offender’s risk of re-offending is the establishment of pro-social connections in the community.\n\nThis program provides an opportunity for prisoners to establish positive relationships and participation in the program may also help to build positive skills and encourage further training and enhanced employment opportunities upon release.\n\nThe program was established and implemented in a manner which ensured sustainability."
