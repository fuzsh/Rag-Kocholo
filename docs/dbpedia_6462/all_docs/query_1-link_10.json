        "text": "If you are organising a public or ticketed event and expect to have more than 5,000 people attend, you will need to notify Adelaide Metro so we can determine if there will be an impact to bus, train or tram services.\n\nThe information you provide will also determine if any special passenger transport services will be needed.\n\nVenue managers are required to advise the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport of special events, which falls under the Passenger Transport Act 1994.\n\nYou can notify Adelaide Metro by filling in by filling in our online form.\n\nAfter your submission, we will assess it within a month and advise you if:\n\nwe need a public transport plan,\n\nyou need to meet with us,\n\nno impact on existing services and no special services needed – so no further action required.\n\nIf a public transport plan is needed, Adelaide Metro will work with you and other relevant stakeholders to develop and submit it for approval. Depending on the type of event and impacts on services, a fee may apply (fees vary between events).\n\nFor more information, please call the Special Events team on (08) 87109 7230 or email DIT.PTSpecialEvents@sa.gov.au.\n\nAdelaide Metro is committed to listening to the community and strives to always provide great customer service. Your suggestions, commendations and feedback help to ensure we meet expectations and improve our network.\n\nYou can provide feedback online anytime or call the InfoLine to speak with a member of our customer service team.\n\nThe Department for Infrastructure and Transport provides information about major public transport infrastructure projects, including how you can provide feedback on them.\n\nYou can view the Department for Infrastructure and Transport’s Customer Service Charter, which outlines our commitment to providing the best possible customer experience for our customers."
