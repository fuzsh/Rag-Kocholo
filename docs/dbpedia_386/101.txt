KOTA KINABALU - A proposed merger between Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS) and Parti Solidarity Tanah Airku (Star) is worth considering but requires a thorough and thoughtful deliberation between party leadership, Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) Information Chief Datuk Joniston Bangkuai.

He said any idea or move that could promote unity and strengthen GRS deserved support but cautioned that the idea should be first deliberated and discussed thoroughly by the supreme council of both parties on the way forward.

"Considering Sabah’s dynamic political landscape, the fusion of PBS and Star could symbolise a strategic transformation. The key consideration is unity and that it can potentially reinforce the GRS state coalition,” he said in a statement here today.

Yesterday, Star President Datuk Seri Dr Jeffrey Kitingan revealed a suggestion to merge his party and PBS with the objective of fortifying their political foothold ahead of the next Sabah state election.

During the 16th state election in September 2020, PBS and Star secured seven and six seats respectively.

Beside PBS and Star, GRS coalition consists of Parti Gagasan Rakyat Sabah, Parti Maju Sabah, Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Sabah Bersatu, Parti Liberal Demokratik, and Parti Harapan Rakyat Sabah. - BERNAMA
