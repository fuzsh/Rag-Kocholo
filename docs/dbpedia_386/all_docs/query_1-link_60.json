        "text": "Focus this week has been on the new #Agong Sultan Ibrahim's strongly-worded maiden address to officiate #Malaysia #parliament first sitting in 2024, which he warned MPs against disrupting political stability. Indeed this is a great news for PM Anwar Ibrahim (and investors), who have been fending off veiled attempts by opposition PN coalition (of which key agitators include Bersatu ex-PM Muhyiddin Yasin and PAS Hadi Awang) to topple Anwar's unity government. Now Anwar will likely have better control of the parliament till 2026/2027 to focus on #policymaking , especially with the potential expansion his parliamentary majority (e.g. more defecting opposition from PN MPs). Politics aside, the King's maiden speech also marks a positive signal for Malaysia's #economy and #business environment. The King rightly highlighted several key concerns commercial and economic concerns that he wants Anwar's government to tackle (presumably in return for his critical royal support to provide Anwar with #political #stability and rein for #publicpolicy making), which he himself as a veteran businessman would likely benefit from. They include: üí∞ Improving Malaysia's fiscal position. The King pledge to personally \"vet\" government spending. At 82% national debt of GDP (i.e. RM1.5 trillion/USD 314 billion) caused by longtime unsustainable public subsidies, the country has been running on fiscal deficit and unable to spend on more productive development projects to stimulate growth. PN will now have limited room to criticize Anwar's targeted subsidies reform and Public Finance and Fiscal Responsibility Bill 2023. ‚õî Increasing transparency in public spending. Investors will rejoice at lesser risk of funny business when dealing with GLCs/GLICs. The King hinted and warned off corruption by \"curbing leakages and misappropriation of public funds\". üíπ Improving the country's investment competitiveness. To this end, the King supported Anwar's Madani plan to restructure economic and investment activity, and to cut \"red tape\" that he admittedly dislike. üë©üë©üëßüëß Social cohesion efforts that would contribute positively to local politics and security. The King wants the government to formulate a policy to foster greater national unity and harmony. Few interesting developments left out the King's speech but will c'nue to be under his radar: RCI to review the territorial dispute with SG (refer to my last RCI entry for its impact); SG-KL High Speed Rail; and the (low-profile beyond Malaysia but is religiously/politically explosive, albeit partly addressed in his social cohesion point to avoid 3Rs politicization) Federal Court's Feb ruling to annul 16 Kelantan Shariah laws. Still, Anwar is still not out of the woods yet. Moving forward, his vulnerability will stem from slow PADU central database inception, public acceptance of rising taxes/prices and - particularly - depreciating historic-low Ringgit further affecting cost of living. #governmentaffairs #businessanalysis\n\nAs we celebrate Malaysia‚Äôs 60th birthday, let us remember independence is always a work in progress, never a finished business. Independence is not about merely getting rid of foreign rulers, but about people being the boss of their government and master of their own destiny. We can be recolonised internally when our democracy is disabled and externally when our government sell out to foreign powers. Hence, independence requires the rule of law, where everyone including the head of government is equal before the law, and a clean government, where public funds cannot be plundered, and power cannot be bought. üîó Click the link below to read more https://lnkd.in/gUAdDMbd\n\n\" Indonesia Coalition Government under Jokowi like Malaysia under Anwar Coalition Government Did Not Improve Democracy Quality. Because they want to breed Political and Economic Patronage and Political and Economic Cartelism \" For Indonesia and Malaysia to become an advanced country. The Democratic Quality Needs to be Improved. Unfortunately that is not the Quality Priority by Jokowi Coalition Government which is happening now in Malaysia under Anwar coalition government. Because obviously elite politicians wants to maintain the current system. In which they will breed Economic Patronage in which they will be able to easily channel the fundings via back channels and they could practise freely the Political Cartelism.\n\nVisited Tan Sri Dr Haji Wan Junaidi Bin Tuanku Jaafar, President of the Dewan Negara, in my capacity as the Lead for the Parliament and State Legislative Assembly Reform Cluster of the CSOP4R. We proposed a number of key reforms, including: 1. Increasing the ratio of state-appointed Senators. Currently it is 2, we propose it is increased to 3 to improve check and balance. 2. Lowering the minimum age to become a Senator to 18, in line with the Dewan Rakyat. Current minimum age is 30. 3. 1/3 of Senatorships to be reserved for Sabahans and Sarawakians. To protect East Malaysian rights, without changing the composition of the Dewan Rakyat. We also presented our papers on bringing back the Parliament Services Act dan PSSC reforms. It was a positive conversation and we hope to strengthen the reform agenda. UNDI 18\n\nToday in Parliament! BERSIH, The Kofi Annan Foundation and Global Bersih launched the Report of the Roundtable on Deepening Democracy in Malaysia. This report includes valuable input from a high-level roundtable featuring a diverse group of participants, including ministers, parliamentarians, experts, and practitioners from various countries as well as representatives from media and civil society groups. The Report addresses these questions in five thematic panel discussions. Furthermore, the key challenges and major recommendations are concisely summarised in this report for brevity. As Malaysia‚Äôs democracy undergoes transition and consolidation, we intend to observe closely and respond to our democracy‚Äôs most pressing needs by learning from both Malaysia‚Äôs experience as well as best practices elsewhere in the world. üîó For further reading, access our report by downloading it here ‚¨áÔ∏è https://lnkd.in/gVamqTjy\n\nA codified Constitution for N Z Sir Geoffrey Palmer was adamantly supportive of the need for this very practical tool to protect our rights and our culture. The Treaty of Waitangi is not that. It had a specific purpose at its time. It does not meet the definition of a constitution for our nation. The very evident tensions in this country in 2023 prompt me to suggest it‚Äôs time for a government to start the process of developing a written constitution. The pandemic and the conflicts it prompted with the Bill of Rights, the cogovernance debate, the local government voting ages, the Maori electorates, the ownership of water, the protection of Maori Culture, the rights of other minorities and the equitable access to food and shelter are but some of the critical aspects of our democracy that require better protection. We don‚Äôt need more taxes to address these issues in terms of agreeing what we believe to be fair and inviolate. What do our political party leaders think about this idea? Is now a very opportune time to start this conversation?"
