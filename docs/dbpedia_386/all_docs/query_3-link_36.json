The picture is constantly changing, but in accordance with UK Government advice we have decided to cancel or postpone all upcoming CPA UK activities. Please find the full statement from CPA UK here.\n\nCPA UK, in collaboration with the Malaysian Parliament, is organising a committee workshop for members, clerks, and officials at the Dewan Rakyat, the lower house of the Malaysian Parliament. The programme will explore good practice in committee work, including the role and responsibilities of Chairs and Members, challenges related to inquiries, and ways to impact change through committee work. The delegation will also have meetings with parliamentary and governmental office holders.\n\nCPA UK is seeking two members or peers (current committee chairs or members preferred) to join the delegation which will be supported by CPA UK staff. The delegation will depart the UK for Malaysia on 17 March and arrive back in the UK on 22 March (TBC).\n\nTo register your interest, please complete the form below by COB Thursday 27 February."
