        "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: The Community Communications Department (J-Kom) should not be dissolved because it is not a political party mouthpiece and its officers aren’t politically appointed, says Teo Nie Ching (pic).\n\nAccording to the Deputy Communications Minister, J-Kom is not a new department as it was created in February, 2021, under the administration of the previous Perikatan Nasional government.\n\n“When it (J-Kom) was set up in 2021, I was in the Opposition. So this is not a new agency set up by the government.\n\n“All MPs and parties in the August House were once part of government, so do not ask me if J-Kom is a political mouthpiece and whether the appointed officers were contract appointments,” said Teo.\n\nALSO READ: J-Kom spent over RM5.5mil last year, says Fahmi\n\nTeo was speaking during her ministry’s winding up speech on the Supply (Reallocation of Appropriate Expenditure) Bill 2024 at the Dewan Rakyat on Tuesday (March 26).\n\nTeo was responding to several Perikatan MPs such as Machang MP Wan Ahmad Fayshal Wan Ahmad Kamal, Kuala Krai MP Abdul Latiff Abdul Rahman and Arau MP Datuk Seri Shahidan Kassim, who posed the question to her ministry.\n\nTeo also said that J-Kom will not be dissolved and the Communications Ministry will ensure that the department will carry out its functions.\n\n“And, it will not clash with other agencies under the Communications Ministry,” said Teo.\n\nALSO READ: Former Paya Jaras rep Khairuddin is new J-Kom DG\n\nShahidan attempted to ask another question to Teo, but he was told to sit down by Deputy Speaker Alice Lau who was presiding over the session at the time.\n\nThe Special Affairs Department (Jasa) was the precursor of J-Kom before rebranding in 2020 whose task is to disseminate messages and policies of the government to the people.\n\nPreviously under the Prime Minister’s Department, J-Ko was placed under the Communications Ministry on Dec 15 last year following the Cabinet reshuffle."
