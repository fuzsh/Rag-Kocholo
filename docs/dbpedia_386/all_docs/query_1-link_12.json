By Constitutional definition, all Malays are Muslim. More than a quarter of the population is Chinese. They have historically played an important role in trade and business.\n\nMalaysians of Indian descent comprise about 7% of the population and include Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists and Christians. About 85% of the Indian community is Tamil.\n\nNon-Malay indigenous groups make up more than half of Sarawak's population and about 66% of Sabah's. They are divided into dozens of ethnic groups but they share some general patterns of living and culture. Until the 20th century, most practiced traditional beliefs, but many have become Christian or Muslim.\n\nThe \"other\" category includes Malaysians of, inter alia, European and Middle Eastern descent.\n\nPopulation distribution is uneven, with some 15 million residents concentrated in the lowlands of Peninsular Malaysia, an area slightly smaller than the state of Michigan.\n\nHISTORY\n\nIn the first century AD, two far-flung but related events helped stimulate Malaysia's emergence in international trade in the ancient world. At that time, India had two principal sources of gold and other metals: the Roman Empire and China. The overland route from China was cut by marauding Huns, and at about the same time, the Roman Emperor Vespasian cut off shipments of gold to India. As a result, India sent large and seaworthy ships, with crews reported to have numbered in the hundreds, to Southeast Asia, including the Malayan Peninsula, to seek alternative sources. In the centuries that followed, rich Malaysian tin deposits assumed great significance in Indian Ocean trade, and the region prospered. As maritime trade among Middle Eastern, Indian, and Chinese ports flourished, the peninsula benefited from its location as well as from development of its diverse resources, including tropical woods and spices. Malay ships became prominent in that trade, and Malay ports served as transshipment centers. Indian trade brought Indian culture, economy, religion, and politics, with historic results for what is now Malaysia.\n\nThe early Buddhist Malay kingdom of Srivijaya, based at what is now Palembang, Sumatra, dominated much of the Malay Peninsula from the 9th to the 13th centuries AD. The powerful Hindu kingdom of Majapahit, based on Java, gained control of the Malay Peninsula in the 14th century. Conversion of the Malays to Islam, beginning in the early 14th century, accelerated with the rise of the state of Malacca under the rule of a Muslim prince in the 15th century.\n\nMalacca was a major regional entrepot, where Chinese, Arab, Malay, and Indian merchants traded precious goods. Drawn by this rich trade, a Portuguese fleet conquered Malacca in 1511, marking the beginning of European expansion in Southeast Asia. The Dutch ousted the Portuguese from Malacca in 1641 and, in 1795, were themselves replaced by the British, who had occupied Penang in 1786.\n\nIn 1826, the British settlements of Malacca, Penang, and Singapore were combined to form the Colony of the Straits Settlements. From these strong points, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the British established protectorates over the Malay sultanates on the peninsula. Four of these states were consolidated in 1895 as the Federated Malay States.\n\nDuring British control, a well-ordered system of public administration was established, public services were extended, and large-scale rubber and tin production was developed. This control was interrupted by the Japanese invasion and occupation from 1942 to 1945 during World War II.\n\nPopular sentiment for independence swelled during and after the war and, in 1957, the Federation of Malaysia, established from the British-ruled territories of Peninsula Malaysia in 1948, negotiated independence from the United Kingdom under the leadership of Tunku Abdul Rahman, who became the first prime minister. The British colonies of Singapore, Sarawak, and Sabah (called North Borneo) joined the Federation to form Malaysia on September 16, 1963. Singapore withdrew from the Federation on August 9, 1965 and became an independent republic. Neighboring Indonesia objected to the formation of Malaysia and pursued a program of economic, political, diplomatic, and military \"confrontation\" against the new country, which ended only after the fall of Indonesia's President Sukarno in 1966.\n\nFollowing World War II, local communists, nearly all Chinese, launched a long, bitter insurgency, prompting the imposition of a state of emergency in 1948 (later lifted in 1960). Small bands of guerrillas remained in bases along the rugged border with southern Thailand, occasionally entering northern Malaysia. These guerrillas finally signed a peace accord with the Malaysian Government in December 1989. A separate small-scale Communist insurgency that began in the mid-1960s in Sarawak also ended with the signing of a peace accord in October 1990.\n\nGOVERNMENT\n\nMalaysia is a constitutional monarchy, nominally headed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (\"paramount ruler\"), customarily referred to as the king. Kings are elected for 5-year terms from among the nine sultans of the peninsular Malaysian states. The king is also the leader of the Islamic faith in Malaysia.\n\nExecutive power is vested in the cabinet led by the prime minister; the Malaysian constitution stipulates that the prime minister must be a member of the lower house of parliament who, in the opinion of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, commands a majority in parliament. The cabinet is chosen from among members of both houses of parliament and is responsible to that body.\n\nThe bicameral parliament consists of the Senate (Dewan Negara) and the House of Representatives (Dewan Rakyat). All 69 Senate members sit for 6-year terms; 26 are elected by the 13 state assemblies, and 43 are appointed by the king. Representatives of the House are elected from single-member districts by universal adult suffrage. The 192 members of the House of Representatives are elected to maximum terms of 5 years. Legislative power is divided between federal and state legislatures.\n\nThe Malaysian legal system is based on English common law. The Federal Court reviews decisions referred from the Court of Appeals; it has original jurisdiction in constitutional matters and in disputes between states or between the federal government and a state. Peninsular Malaysia and the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak each have a high court.\n\nThe federal government has authority over external affairs, defense, internal security, justice (except civil law cases among Malays or other Muslims and other indigenous peoples, adjudicated under Islamic and traditional law), federal citizenship, finance, commerce, industry, communications, transportation, and other matters.\n\nPrincipal Government Officials\n\nPrime Minister, Minister of Finance, and Minister of Home Affairs--Dato' Seri Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad\n\nForeign Minister--Datuk Seri Syed Hamid Albar\n\nAmbassador to the U.S.--Dato' Ghazzali Sheikh Abdul Khalid\n\nAmbassador to the UN-- Dato' Hamsy bin Agam\n\nMalaysia maintains an embassy in the U.S. at 2401 Massachusetts Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20008, tel. (202) 328-2700; a Consulate General in the World Trade Center, 350 South Figueroa Street, Los Angeles, CA, tel. (213) 621-2991; and a Consulate General at 140 E. 45th Street, New York, NY 10017, tel. (212) 490-2722.\n\nPOLITICAL CONDITIONS\n\nMalaysia's predominant political party, the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), has held power in coalition with other parties since Malaya's independence in 1957. In 1973, an alliance of communally based parties was replaced with a broader coalition--the Barisan Nasional--composed of 14 parties. In 1995, the most recent general election, the Barisan Nasional was returned with an overwhelming majority, winning 162 out of the 192 parliamentary seats. In addition to the federal government, Barisan Nasional has also held power continuously in most state governments, though an Islamic opposition party now controls the state of Kelantan. In September 1998, Prime Minister Mahathir sacked Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Abraham and accused Anwar of immoral and corrupt conduct. Anwar said his ouster actually owed to political differences and led a series of demonstrations advocating political reforms. In September, the government detained Anwar and many of his supporters without trial under the Internal Security Act (ISA). Anwar and his associates were later released from ISA detention though Anwar remained imprisoned pending trial on four counts of corrupt practices, i.e. obstruction of justice. In April 1999, he was convicted on all four counts and sentenced to six years in jail in a trial viewed by domestic and international observers as unfair. He is currently on trial for sodomy. Anwar's ouster and imprisonment will affect Malaysia's general elections which are due by June 2000.\n\nECONOMY\n\nAfter nearly a decade of strong economic growth averaging 8.7% annually, Malaysia was hard hit by the regional financial and economic crisis in 1997-1998, but signs of recovery are appearing. The economy is expected to return to positive growth in 1999 after contracting by 7.3% in 1998. Growing consumer and investor confidence is reflected in increased auto sales, an increase in consumer credit and mortgage approvals, and a substantial increase in the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite Index from its record low of 262.70 in September, 1998. Increased public spending on social, education and health programs should also contribute to an improvement in the economy.\n\nIn July 1998, the government announced a comprehensive series of objectives for promoting economic recovery, termed the National Economic Recovery Plan. On September 1, 1998, Malaysia enacted selective currency controls and fixed the value of the Ringgit at RM3.8/US$1. The measures were implemented to eliminate offshore trading in the Ringgit and insulate the domestic economy from the effects of short-term speculative capital flows. Foreign direct investment flows, wages, dividends, interest, and rental income earned in Malaysia are exempt from the controls.\n\nThe government established three institutions in 1998 to speed recovery of the financial system. Danaharta, the asset Management Company, was established to purchase and manage non-performing loans. Danamodal was charged with recapitalizing banks. The Corporate Dept Restructuring Committee was set up to encourage collective debt workouts between debtors and creditors. The government has also promoted the consolidation of financial institutions through domestic mergers and has undertaken a number of measures to improve market transparency and corporate governance in order to restore market confidence and promote capital market development.\n\nMalaysia remains an important trading partner for the United States. In 1998, two-way bilateral trade totaled US$27.6 billion, with U.S. exports totaling US$10.1 billion and imports from Malaysia totaling US$17.5 billion. Malaysia was the United States' 12th-largest trading partner and its 8th-largest export market. In 1998, the United States was Malaysia's largest trading partner.\n\nAt independence, Malaysia inherited an economy dominated by two commodities -- rubber and tin. In the 40 years thereafter, Malaysia's economic record had been one of Asia's best. From the early '80s through the mid-'90s , the economy experienced a period of broad diversification and sustained rapid growth averaging almost 8% annually. By 1998, nominal per capita GNP had reached $3,201. New foreign and domestic investment played a significant role in the transformation of Malaysia's economy. Manufacturing grew from 13.9% of GDP in 1970 to 27.9% in 1998, while agriculture and mining, which together had accounted for 42.7% of GDP in 1970, dropped to 9.4% in 1998.\n\nDespite the toll taken by the global financial crisis, most market analysts and economists remain generally positive about Malaysia's long-term prospects, especially if the Malaysian government uses this opportunity to undertake financial sector reform.\n\nManufacturing accounts for 27.9% of GDP (1998). Major products include electronic components (Malaysia is one of the world's largest exporter of semiconductor devices), electrical goods, and appliances.\n\nThe government encourages Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). In 1998, the U.S. ranked first among all countries in FDI in Malaysia with approved new manufacturing investments totaling RM 6.4 billion (US$1.7 billion). The cumulative value of U.S. private investment in Malaysia exceeds $10 billion, 60% of which is in the oil and gas and petrochemical sectors with the rest in manufacturing, especially semiconductors and other electronic products.\n\nMalaysia's New Economic Policy (NEP), first established in 1971, seeks to eradicate poverty and end the identification of economic function with ethnicity. In particular, it was designed to enhance the economic standing of ethnic Malays and other indigenous peoples (collectively known as \"bumiputras\" in Bahasa Malaysia). Rapid growth through the mid-'90s made it possible to expand the share of the economy for bumiputras without reducing the economic attainment of other groups. One controversial NEP goal was to alter the pattern of ownership of corporate equity in Malaysia, with the government providing funds to purchase foreign-owned shareholdings on behalf of the bumiputra population. In June 1991, after the NEP expired, the government unveiled its National Development Policy, which contained many of the NEP's goals, although without specific equity targets and timetables.\n\nDEFENSE\n\nMalaysia has undertaken a major program to expand and modernize its armed forces, with significant procurement of state of the art equipment, including FA-18's and MIG fighters. Budgetary constraints imposed by the financial crisis have slowed procurement. In January 1999, the new defense minister announced the government is formulating a new national defense policy to chart the direction of the ministry in facing current and future challenges.\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS\n\nAs a founding member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN -- established 1967), Malaysia views regional cooperation as the cornerstone of its foreign policy. Malaysia was a leading advocate of expanding ASEAN's membership to include Laos, Vietnam, and Burma, arguing that \"constructive engagement\" with these countries, especially Burma, will help bring political and economic changes. In world affairs, Malaysia maintains close, cordial relations with the United States, the European Union, and Japan. Malaysia is an active member of the Commonwealth, the UN, the Organization of Islamic Conference, and the Non-Aligned Movement. Malaysia is also a member of APEC, and hosted the 1998 Leaders' Meeting. Malaysia maintains diplomatic relations with North Korea. In January 1999 Malaysia began a two-year stint as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.\n\nInternational Affiliations: UN and many of its specialized agencies, including UNESCO; World Bank, International Monetary Fund, International Atomic Energy Agency; General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade; Association of Southeast Asian Nations; Asian Development Bank; Five-Power Defense Arrangement; South-South Commission (G-15); Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC); Commonwealth; Non-Aligned Movement; Organization of Islamic Conference; and INTELSAT.\n\nU.S.-MALAYSIAN RELATIONS\n\nThe United States has maintained friendly relations with Malaysia since its independence in 1957. Despite occasional strident rhetoric, the U.S. and Malaysia have a solid record of cooperation in many areas, including trade and investment, counter-terrorism, and counter-narcotics.\n\nCultural and educational exchanges have been another fruitful area of cooperation. Malaysians studying in the U.S., now numbering about 14,000, still represent one of the largest foreign student groups enrolled in American colleges and universities. The United States has taken several steps to assist Malaysian students in the U.S. through the uncertainties of the recent economic downturn.\n\nTrade and Investment\n\nMalaysia's economy looks set for recovery in 1999. The U.S. is currently Malaysia's largest trading partner and largest investor. Malaysia possesses abundant resources and land, a well-educated workforce, adequate infrastructure, and a relatively stable political environment. The dramatic braking of economic growth, however, will affect U.S. export opportunities. Nevertheless, opportunities will remain strong in priority areas of development, including high technology fields, industrial automation, medical products and services, education/distance learning, and the environment. Of particular interest is the ongoing development of the Multimedia Supercorridor, Malaysia's effort to create Asia's version of Silicon Valley. Malaysia, a member of the World Trade Organization, has few restraints on trade goods. Its service sector, however, remains protected, particularly in financial services.\n\nPrincipal U.S. Embassy Officials\n\nAmbassador--B.
