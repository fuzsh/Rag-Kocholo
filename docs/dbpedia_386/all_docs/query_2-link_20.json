        "text": "KOTA KINABALU: Pacts or agreements between political parties are only useful if they enable the people’s needs and aspirations to be addressed, says a Parti Warisan leader.\n\nParty vice president Terrence Siambun said the memorandum of understanding (MOU) between Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS) and Sabah STAR on Thursday (April 18) was not particularly significant as such deals were common in any political landscape.\n\n“It is important to remember that the primary focus of any political agreement should always be the welfare and interests of the people,” he said in a statement on Friday (April 19).\n\nALSO READ: PBS, Sabah STAR sign MOU towards political unity for Sabah's native communities\n\n“Evidently, the MOU aims to serve their respective interests but it doesn't reflect inclusivity and collaboration with the other five component parties within Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS),” he said.\n\nThese partners are Parti Gagasan Rakyat Sabah (Gagasan Rakyat), the United National Sabah Organisation (Usno), Sabah Progressive Party (SAPP), Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Harapan Rakyat.\n\nSiambun asked if there had been any dialogue and cooperation involving all GRS components to ensure collective participation and equitable representation.\n\nHe said political agreements such as this often serve as mechanisms to streamline processes and enhance coordination within coalitions.\n\nALSO READ: Sabah STAR-PBS pact doesn't undermine GRS, say leaders\n\nHowever, their success ultimately hinges on the ability to translate into tangible benefits for the people, he added.\n\n“Sabah is fraught with issues that should take priority instead of political expediency,” Siambun said.\n\n“These range from economic development and infrastructure improvement to education and healthcare services. These should remain at the forefront of any political endeavour,\" he said.\n\nPBS and Sabah STAR signed their MOU with the objective of, among others, uniting the Kadazandusun Murut and Rungus native communities as well as working together in the coming state election due by October next year."
