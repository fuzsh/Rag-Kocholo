Its contribution to stability in Southeast Asia, the growth of U.S.-Malaysian economic and cultural ties, Malaysia's role in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, its self- reliant drive to develop its economy and preserve its independence, its participation in the Five-Power Defense Arrangement, and its strong commitment to the suppression of narcotics trafficking are in harmony with U.S. policy and form a solid basis for U.S.-Malaysian friendship.\n\nU.S. support for Malaysia has been demonstrated by cooperation in many areas, including narcotics enforcement, cultural exchanges, and a Fulbright educational exchange program initiated in 1963. (Malaysians, numbering about 16,000, represent one of the largest foreign student groups enrolled in American colleges and universities.) The United States also has supported Malaysia's defense efforts by providing for Malaysian participation in U.S. military education training programs and purchases of equipment under the foreign military sales program. The United States also actively promotes American trade and investment in Malaysia.\n\nTrade and Investment\n\nMalaysia's prospects for continuing growth and prosperity are excellent, with growth rates above 8% expected in the medium term. Malaysia possesses abundant resources and land, a well-educated work force, adequate infrastructure, and a stable political environment. It has been very attractive to U.S. investors, who have invested a total of $9 billion in the country, two-thirds of which is in petroleum development and electronic component production.\n\nThere are relatively few trade problem areas. Malaysia, a member of the World Trade Organization, has few restraints on trade in goods. Its service sector, however, constitutes about 44% of the national economy and remains highly protected, particularly in financial services.\n\nPrincipal U.S. Embassy Officials\n\nAmbassador--John R. Malott\n\nDCM--Anna Borg\n\nPolitical Counselor--Jeff Lunstead\n\nEconomic Counselor--Janice Fleck\n\nCommercial Attache--Michael Hand\n\nPublic Affairs Officer (USIS)(Acting)--Thomas Carmichael\n\nAgricultural Attache--Lloyd Fleck\n\nConsul--Hugh Williams\n\nThe U.S. embassy in Malaysia is located at 376 Jalan Tun Razak, 50400 Kuala Lumpur (tel. 60-3-248-9011).\n\nGOVERNMENT\n\nMalaysia is a constitutional monarchy, nominally headed by the Yang di- Pertuan Agong (\"paramount ruler\"), customarily referred to as the king. Kings are elected for five-year terms from among the nine sultans of the peninsular Malaysian states. The king also is the leader of the Islamic faith in Malaysia.\n\nExecutive power is vested in the cabinet led by the prime minister; the Malaysian constitution stipulates that the prime minister must be a member of the lower house of parliament who, in the opinion of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, commands a majority in parliament. The cabinet is chosen from among members of both houses of parliament and is responsible to that body.\n\nThe bicameral parliament consists of the Senate (Dewan Negara) and the House of Representatives (Dewan Rakyat). All 69 Senate members sit for six-year terms; 26 are elected by the 13 state assemblies, and 43 are appointed by the king. Representatives of the House are elected from single-member districts by universal adult suffrage. The 192 members of the House of Representatives are elected to maximum terms of five years. Legislative power is divided between federal and state legislatures.\n\nThe Malaysian legal system is based on English common law. The Federal Court reviews decisions referred from the Court of Appeals; it has original jurisdiction in constitutional matters and in disputes between states or between the federal government and a state. Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysian Borneo states of Sabah and Sarawak each have a high court.\n\nThe federal government has authority over external affairs, defense, internal security, justice (except civil law cases among Malays and other indigenous peoples, adjudicated under Islamic and traditional law), federal citizenship, finance, commerce, industry, communications, transportation, and other matters. The states of East Malaysia enjoy guarantees of state rights with regard to immigration, civil service, and customs matters. Control over oil and timber, and the distribution of revenues from taxes from these resources, as well as state autonomy in areas such as education and information, remain sources of controversy between the federal government and the states of East Malaysia, particularly Sabah.\n\nPrincipal Government Officials\n\nPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs--Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad\n\nForeign Minister--Datuk Abdullah bin Haji Ahmad Badawi\n\nAmbassador to the U.S.--Dato' Dali Mahmud Hashim\n\nAmbassador to the UN--Tan Sri Razali bin Ismail\n\nMalaysia maintains an embassy in the U.S. at 2401 Massachusetts Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20008, tel. (202) 328-2700; a consulate general in the World Trade Center, 350 South Figueroa Street, Los Angeles, CA, tel. (213) 621-2991; and a consulate general at 140 E 45th Street, New York, NY 10017, tel. (212) 490-2722.\n\nPOLITICAL CONDITIONS\n\nIn 1973, an alliance of communally based parties was replaced with a broader coalition--the Barisan Nasional--composed of 13 parties. Malaysia's predominant political party, United Malays National Organization, held party elections in April 1987; Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamad successfully defended the presidency against his challenger, Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah.\n\nIn October 1990, the Barisan coalition turned back an unprecedented opposition challenge spearheaded by Tengku Razaleigh's new party, Semangat 46. Razaleigh had brought together a loose opposition front composed of ideologically diverse parties, including Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS) which had bolted from the Barisan coalition on the eve of elections. Barisan won 127 out of 180 parliamentary districts but lost control of two states: the Islamic opposition party--Parti Se-Islam Malaysia--captured control of Kelantan, while PBS retained control of Sabah.\n\nIn March 1994, however, PBS lost control of Sabah when its assemblymen defected to the Barisan coalition. The party had won 26 out of the 48 state seats in the state election held in February 1994. PAS still controls Kelantan.\n\nThe Barisan coalition was returned with an overwhelming majority in the 1995 general election, winning 162 out of the 192 parliamentary seats. In October 1996, opposition party Semangat 46 was dissolved and its six parliamentarians joined UMNO. Barisan now has 171 seats in the parliament.\n\nTRAVEL AND BUSINESS INFORMATION\n\nThe U.S. Department of State's Consular Information Program provides Travel Warnings and Consular Information Sheets. Travel Warnings are issued when the State Department recommends that Americans avoid travel to a certain country. Consular Information Sheets exist for all countries and include information on immigration practices, currency regulations, health conditions, areas of instability, crime and security, political disturbances, and the addresses of the U.S. posts in the country.
