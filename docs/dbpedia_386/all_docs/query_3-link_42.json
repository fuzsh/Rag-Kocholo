        "text": "In the intricate constitutional monarchy system of Malaysia, there exists an intrinsic institution that defines the nation as a democracy – Parliament. As the epicentre of governance, Parliament acts as a nexus where state-elected representatives from all corners of the nation come to deliberate, discuss, and decide upon matters that chart the course of the country. Malaysia’s Parliament is divided into two houses: Dewan Rakyat (the Lower House or the House of Representatives) and Dewan Negara (the Upper House). Dewan Rakyat is made up of 222 Members of Parliament (MPs) elected by the public, while Dewan Negara is made up of 70 Senators, with 40 of them personally appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong.\n\nWhile both houses play essential roles in the processes of decision-making, passing, and reviewing legislation, Dewan Rakyat serves as the primary forum for these functions. Specifically, it passes Federal Laws and amends existing ones, examines the efficiency of government policies, and approves government expenditures. It is also here that the public has a platform to voice their opinions — this occurs during parliamentary hearings, where all MPs gather from Monday to Thursday to discuss pressing national issues. These gatherings often conjure images of intense debates, impassioned speeches, and important decisions on our screens. But despite being open for all to watch, parliamentary hearings remain veiled in an aura of mystery, obscured by the complexities of its processes.\n\nWhile parliamentary hearings bring the forefront of the proceedings into view, the groundwork for these discussions begins long before, behind the closed doors of their respective geographical constituency offices. Among these offices is that of YB Wong Chen, the elected MP for Subang Jaya, where I had the honour of interning. During this internship, I had the opportunity to demystify the intricacies of parliamentary hearings and gain valuable insights into the inner workings of the political arena."
