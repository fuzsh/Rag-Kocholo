        "text": "Several momentous events that have occurred during the 1970s have had a significant impact on the relationship between Islam, politics, and society. For instance, September 11th, the Taliban rule in Afghanistan, the Mujahedeen war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan (1979–88), the Iranian revolution (1978–1979). The Iranian revolution, and the current existence of extremist militant groups in the Muslim world like Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram in Nigeria, and the so-called Islamic State (also known as ISIS or DAESH) in Iraq and Syria. The fundamental principles of Islam and humanity have been violated by the violent acts performed by these organizations. In 1987, Marshall Bouton warned against exaggerating the significance of extremist actions because it may contribute to misunderstandings about Islam [1, 2]. Islam is thus perceived as being militant, anti-Western, and backward in both politics and society today. As Bouton emphasizes, individuals are also prevented from seeing the wider picture and comprehending the benefits of the relationship between Islam and society because of the emphasis focused on individual incidents [3]. This study examines the link between Islam and politics by assessing the place of Islam in Malaysian state politics in recognition of the need to move beyond stereotypes and headlines.\n\nIt is important to consider also that Islam become the official religion of the Federation (Malaysia), despite the fact that constitutional democracy is adopted. This means also still play a vital role in national affairs. There is also JAKIM at the federal level, and religious department headed by the Sultan, demonstrate that Islam’s prominent position in Malaysia’s political life. The United Malays National Organization (UMNO), which headed the ruling coalition, was founded in 1946. The coalition’s members had a significant emphasis on national economic growth and were educated in the west. But since then, Islam has come under increasing scrutiny in Malaysian Muslims’ daily lives as well as in the politics of the nation [4, 5]. These changes do not always cause Muslims to become more radicalized. Malaysia, on the other hand, has long served as a model of a pluralistic, moderate, and tolerant Muslim nation.\n\nHowever, contemporary public opinion in Malaysia suggests a rise in sympathies for extreme attitude, particularly in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. According to data from the US-based Pew Research Center, 11% of Muslims in Malaysia voiced support for ISIS in 2015 [6, 7]. Malaysia shockingly scored the highest in terms of support for ISIS at 5.2 percent as well as for the regional organization Jemaah Islamiyah (18.1%), which seeks to build an Islamic caliphate in Southeast Asia, according to a 2018 report by the research firm Merdeka Centre [8, 9]. The existence of religious extremism in Malay culture is concerning, despite the fact that the majority of Muslims in Malaysia still practice moderate forms of their faith (Mostly it’s mindset and attitude of the small minority). The political and governmental changes that have occurred since the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) crisis in 2015 and the loss of the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition by the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition make this particularly noteworthy. Since winning the 14th Malaysian General Elections (GE14) on May 9, 2018, the new coalition has been in power and is led by the ninety-three-year-old Dr. Mahathir Mohamad. Scholar examines, the rise in Islam’s influence in Malaysian politics is not the reason behind the emergence of radicalization in that country. It is the result of a number of variables, including regional dynamics, international imperatives (like the rise of ISIS), and internal politics.\n\n1.1 Islam and the Malaysian political structure\n\nThe only federation in Southeast Asia, Malaysia is a federal constitutional elected monarchy made up of thirteen states and three federal territories. The Westminster parliamentary system, which dates back to British colonial control, serves as the basis for the current political structure. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong, sometimes known as the Sultan (King), is the head of state. Nine Malay state hereditary rulers choose the Sultan for a five-year tenure. The selection process is not open to the other four states with titular governors. Malaysia’s political and governmental structure is seen to be quite well-established in comparison to other emerging nations. The parliament is divided into the Dewan Rakyat (House of Representatives) and Dewan Negara (Senate), with the prime minister serving as the head of state. Mahathir Mohamad, the former prime minister of Malaysia, is still involved in politics at the age of just under 100. Throughout the majority of his first term as prime minister, which lasted from 1981 to 2003, Mahathir—a lifelong supporter of Malay rights—frequently clashed with the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS). In light of this past, it may come as a surprise that Mahathir and the Islamist PAS are getting along in May 2023. Since Malaysia gained its independence in 1957, political discourse has placed racial politics at the center. Political figures and parties frequently target a particular racial demographic with their appeals. Mahathir uses the phrase “Malay unity” as a political catchphrase and utopia to rally support, regardless of whether or not such objectives are desirable or even realistic [10, 11].\n\nIt is critical to recognize that the Malaysian administration faces significant obstacles in its efforts to win over enough ethnic Malays. State elections in six of Malaysia’s thirteen states are set for July 2023; these elections will provide as a reliable gauge of the general level of support among Malays for Anwar’s government. Numerous opinion polls show that Malays and Bumiputeras are generally in favor of maintaining affirmative action for their ethnic group. Additionally, a number of clauses in Malaysia’s federal constitution provide a unique status for Malays and Bumiputera. It would be political suicide to completely remove Bumiputera affirmative action. Additionally, it would support Mahathir’s claims that Malays are oppressed.\n\nOver sixty years of BN control came to an end with the surprise triumph of the Pakatan Harapan (PH) alliance led by Dr. Mahathir Mohamad. The process of putting in place the new government went off without a hitch. The 2010 Population and Housing Census of Malaysia (Census 2010) indicates that there are roughly 28.3 million people living there, of which 91.8 percent are citizens of Malaysia and 8.2 percent are not. Although there are many different ethnic groups in Malaysia, most of the population is of Austronesian descent. They are native to the Malay Peninsula and are referred to as Bumiputras (67.4%). There are sizable communities of Chinese (24.6%) and Indians (7.3%) who are descended from immigrants who came under the British colonial authority. Since the racial riots in 1969, the Bumiputra have benefited from specific advantages in Malaysia, which the Malays and/or the Bumiputra perceive to be their territory. Conventionally, in Malaysia, Malays are thought of as Bumiputeras in general. While NEP is based on race rather than deprivation, certain pro-bumiputra measures do exist as affirmative action for bumiputras. For example, a 7 percent discount on homes or other property, even opulent apartments, is granted to all bumiputras, regardless of their financial situation, although low-income non-bumiputras are not eligible for this kind of financial support. Quotas for admission to government schools, eligibility for public scholarships, marking of university exams, special classes for bumiputras only before end-of-term exams, government jobs, and business ownership are some examples of additional preferential policies. The Malaysian New Economic Policy (NEP) era saw the establishment of the majority of the policies. The goal of many policies is to have a bumiputra portion of business stock, which should account for at least 30% of the total. Ismail Abdul Rahman put out this objective following the government’s inability to reach a consensus on an appropriate policy aim. It is the official religion of the Federation as stated in Malaysian Federal Constitution. Buddhism is practiced by 19.8% of people, followed by Christianity (9.2%), Hinduism (6.3%), and Buddhism (19.8%). Confucianism, Taoism, and other traditional Chinese faiths are practiced by 1.3 percent of people [12, 13].\n\nAccording to the statistics, Malaysia is a multi-religious nation, with Islam having the largest population. The first four prime ministers emphasized that Malaysia could operate as a secular state, despite the fact that Islam is the religion of the Federation, but other religions can also be practised safely and peacefully in any part of the Federation. The constitution guarantees religious freedom for all residents. Islam is represented in Malaysia via the Shafie’ school of thought (mazhab) and Asha’arite theology. Sultan Megat Iskandar Shah or Parameswara, Sultan of Malacca, embraced Islam and proclaimed it the court religion in 1414 CE (See Fig. 1 for details).\n\nAs the Sultanate expanded its control over the peninsula, this deed immensely aided the propagation of Islam [14, 15]. Since then, Islam has had a significant influence on politics and government.\n\nIslamic governance in the Malay Peninsula was village-based and overseen by local imams up until the late nineteenth century. Later, some sultans started enforcing Sharīʿah (Islamic Jurisprudence) for Muslim subjects and started consolidating Islamic institutions within the state bureaucracy in an effort to bolster Malay society against British colonial control. In the state of Kelantan, a Majlis Agama Islam dan Isti’adat Melayu (also known as Majlis Agama, or Council of Islamic Religion and Malay Customs) was founded in 1915 [16]. It served as a primary religious council with broad administrative and coercive powers that were only constrained by the Sultan’s ultimate authority. Later, other Malay states followed suit, which, according to John Funston, contributed to the development of a tight bond between the state sultan and Islam beginning in the early twentieth century. When Hizbul Muslimn (the Muslims’ Party) was founded in 1948, Majlis Agama Tertinggi Sa-Malaya (MATA, the Pan Malayan Supreme Religious Council) had already been constituted for one year. Their goals included establishing an Islamic State (Dar-ul-Islam) and gaining independence [17]. Persatuan Islam Sa-Tanah Melayu (the Pan Malayan Islamic Organization, subsequently known as Parti Islam Se Malaysia—PAS, The Islamic Party of Malaysia) was founded in 1951 and drew both opposition supporters and conservative members of the religious elite.\n\n1.2 Malaysia’s position on Islam\n\nIslam had little influence over governmental affairs until UMNO declared its independence on August 31, 1957. On May 10, 1946, in Johor Bahru, at the Third Malay Congress, the UMNO was founded. The party’s founding leader, Datuk Onn Jaafar, supported nationalist policies that protected Bumiputra interests while also advocating for tolerance and religious freedom. A coalition between UMNO and MCA (Malayan Chinese Association) was established in 1954, and it rapidly grew to include the Malayan Indian Congress (MIC). The coalition’s main goal was to attain independence, and after it did, it was crucial in creating the new nation-state government and crafting the constitution [18].\n\nTogether with the alliance’s non-Malay allies, UMNO decided the constitutional status of Islam in Malaysia after independence. A note was delivered in 1955 to the Reid Constitutional Commission, which was in charge of drafting the laws that would govern an independent Malaysia [19]. Islam remains obligation of both state and federal, that’s why Malaysia has JAKIM as institution to oversee the practice of Islam in Malaysia [20]. However, since the 1950s, the state has continued to be in charge of Islamic issues, and the Malaysian system is hailed as a model of moderate Islam [21]. The state Islamic departments (Jabatan Agama Islam) were created to handle Islamic affairs [22]. Under government supervision, Jabatan Agama Islam is an organization that carries out Islamic instruction in all of Malaysia’s states [23]. Jabatan Agama Islam Selagor (JAIS), whose domain is limited to the state of Selangor, is in charge of monitoring it for that region. The Department of Management and Services, the Department of Islamic Family Law, the Department of Islamic Study, the Department of Da’wah (preaching), the Department of Research and Development (R&D), the Department of Impeachment, the Department of Enforcement, the Department of Masjid/Musolla Management, the Preaching and Training Institute of Selangor, and the Department of Office of Islamic Institution of Selangor are its ten departments.” This organization’s primary goal is to create a great ummah (people) by offering excellent and efficient services for Islamic institutions, educating Muslims in Selangor, planning, carrying out, and observing preaching programs for all, planning and carrying out the development of Muslim families, upholding current Islamic law, and enhancing the greatness of masjids in the direction of the ummah’s unity and growth [1].\n\nIn every state, the sultan is in charge of everything pertaining to Islam, but the mufti, who renders final decisions, also has significant authority (fatwa). Early on after independence, the federal government showed little interest in matters pertaining to Islam [24]. The Majlis Kebangsaan Bagi Hal Ehwal Ugama Islam Malaysia (Malaysian National Council for Islamic Affairs) was established in 1968 by the Council of Rulers (Sultāns), and it has its secretariat in the Prime Minister’s Office [25]. Later, in 1974, Yayasan Dakwah Islamiah Malaysia (YADIM, Islamic Preaching Foundation of Malaysia) was founded as an Islamic research center and missionary organization. The Department of Islamic Development in Malaysia (Jabatan Kemajuan Islam Malaysia, JAKIM) was established in 1997 after it underwent additional enlargement. With the exception of a brief period between 1999 and 2004, when Mr. Abdul Hadi held the position of chief minister in the Barisan Alternatif coalition, the Terengganu state government was governed by the UMNO-led Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition from 1974 to 2013. But PAS and its Perikatan Nasional (PN) alliance have continued to rule the state of Terengganu ever since the BN lost the 2018 General Election [26].\n\nAfter the general election in 2022 in Malaysia, PAS is possibly the most powerful individual party in the nation at the federal level. It now controls 43 of the 222 seats in parliament, making it more prevalent than UMNO, the multiracial Democratic Action Party (DAP), and the Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) of Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Prior to 2018, the Malay nationalist party UMNO controlled Malaysian politics. Together with the Malay nationalist party Bersatu, PAS heads the opposition coalition PN at the federal level. In 2023, PAS performed exceptionally well in the six state elections, taking 105 of the 127 seats it ran for. Under the PN banner, it led a clean sweep of all 32 state seats in Terengganu, winning 27 of them while Bersatu took home the other five. Known as the Malay heartland, Terengganu, Kelantan, Kedah, and Perlis are four northern states where PAS presently controls the government. The conservative party is now aiming to form the government in the next general election, buoyed by recent political successes [27].\n\n1.3 Extremism ratio and Malaysia’s strategies\n\nRecent studies show an increase in extremist inclinations among Muslims in Malaysia and other Southeast Asian countries, albeit these tendencies are still very low [28]. According to a poll done by the USA-based Pew Research Center in November 2015, 11 percent of Muslims in Malaysia had a favorable opinion of ISIS, compared to 4 percent of Muslims in Indonesia [29]. According to the findings of a previous survey titled “Muslim Publics Share Concerns about Extremist Groups” that was conducted on September 10, 2013, almost a quarter of Muslims in Malaysia (27%) believe that attacks on civilians are occasionally or often permissible. However, if this figure is combined with the 12 percent who say that suicide bombings and other forms of violence are “rarely justified” in order to preserve Islam, then nearly 39 percent of the Malaysian Muslims polled hold this opinion. Significantly, just 18% of Indonesians responded to the same question (1% said “often,” 5% said “sometimes,” and 12% said “rarely”). ISIS allegedly attracted 500 Indonesian and Malaysian citizens, including women and children, and even formed “Katibah Nusantara” and “Katibah Masyaariq,” its Malay-speaking wings [30]. The counter-terrorism division revealed in November 2018 that since 2013, 102 Malaysians have traveled to Syria; at least 11 of them have returned, while 37 men have died in Syria and Iraq. It is believed that 54 Malaysians, including 23 men, 11 women, 12 boys, and 8 girls, are still in Syria [31].\n\n1.4 Radicalization driven by religion\n\nVarious facets of radicalization seem to have various effects on different people. According to their goals, radical groups have been divided into five categories in literature. Nationalist and separatist organizations like the Tamil Tigers, ETA, IRA, and PKK are at the top of this list. These organizations want to take control of some property or a safe zone for the neighborhood they represent. Extreme right-wing organizations like the Ku Klux Klan and Pegida, who fight to advance goals in order to safeguard the white race, are in second position. They are exhibiting an increasing hostility to immigrants and asylum seekers. The Red Brigades, the Red Army Faction, and the Revolutionary People’s Liberation Party-Front are examples of radical left-wing organizations operating in the period. These organizations support equal economic distribution and attempt to combat capitalism. Fourthly, there are organizations that concentrate on a single problem, such the Army of God Group and the Animal Liberation Front. Radical organizations with a religious motivation are the fifth and last category. They are organizations like DAESH and Al Qaeda that adhere to a rigorous interpretation of religion based on their goals and attempt to use this to justify their acts [32].\n\nBy departing from the truth, there is the use of skewed representations of religious facts and occurrences [33]. Additionally, there are a variety of societal and personal factors that might induce someone to radicalize. With issues like unemployment, illiteracy, social marginalization, homelessness, and a lack of social services, people’s despair grows tremendously, which creates the perfect environment for radicalism. It is clear that radicalization driven by religion may occur for a variety of causes, including those related to the economy, politics, society, and education. In developing nations where internal strife is frequent, ideological polarizations predominate, and anti-imperialism is a prominent force, radicalization is more likely to occur. Individuals with significant economic prospects can also become radicalized, despite the fact that both groups are possible. The West follows Islam for political reasons, particularly because of its jihadist ideology, and because it is believed to be the motivation behind Islamic terrorist groups. It has been observed that the Central Asia, Middle East, North Africa and Southeast Asia have undergone a change in order following the fall of the Soviet Union and the conclusion of the Cold War thanks to the Soviet influence and political Islam. Political Islam inevitably developed a military component as a result of this system.\n\nThe 1979 Iranian revolution was institutionalized by the bureaucratic elites, which led to intense hostility between Iran and the West. As time went on, tension on a global scale was brought on by Khomeini’s death fatwa prompted by Salman Rushdie’s novel The Satanic Verses. The Islamic revolution’s export problem has dominated Middle East strategy for a long time. The strict and intolerable laws in Iran have also contributed to the global proliferation of the threat posed by Islamic terrorism [34]. Due to fundamentalist activities and propaganda, the question of revolution’s export has been a major cause of worry for both Western and other Muslim countries. Diverse variations result from the social and cultural values’ rapid corruption. Supporters of violence are nourished by this circumstance and turn to activities that fuel radicalization, especially during difficult or depressing times. As a result, people with inadequate education, ideas, and violent elements fill the gaps.\n\n1.5 2021 and US terrorist reports on Malaysia\n\nMalaysia continued its counterterrorism operations to track down, apprehend, deport, and punish those believed to be supporting terrorist organizations. Malaysian law enforcement worked along with American and regional allies to bolster border security at points of entry in an effort to stop terrorist networks from establishing safe havens and identify and disrupt terrorists’ passage. As a GCTF member, Malaysia supports an all-government strategy to combat violent extremist organizations’ efforts to attract new members and spread misinformation. Moreover, according to country’s reports about terrorism by US [35], It said that although there were no terrorist attacks in Malaysia in the year 2021, countries like ISIS, the ASG (Abu Sayyaf Group), and al-Qa’ida continued to use Malaysia as a transit point and, to a lesser extent, a destination. Eight alleged Abu Sayyaf members from the Philippines were apprehended and deported on May 8 by Malaysian officials, who said they were preparing to conduct kidnapping-for-ransom operations in Sabah, an upcountry region of East Malaysia. Law enforcement further reported the execution of two suspected ASG subleaders on May 18 and the subsequent deportation of seven suspected ASG members. These individuals were reportedly planning to engage in abduction activities to raise money for ASG operations in the southern Philippines. In order to protect against kidnappings and cross-border threats, the Eastern Sabah Security Command intensified marine patrols while maintaining its “heightened alert” posture for the East Sabah region. The Security Offense Special Measures Act, the Prevention against Terrorism Act, and the Sedition Act are among the security-related legislation that the Malaysian government did not alter. Human rights organizations once more argued for the legislation’ repeal, noting worries that its clauses allowing imprisonment without trial were against international standards.\n\nFurthermore, the principal role in counterterrorism law enforcement is played by the Royal Malaysian Police (RMP) Special Branch Counterterrorism Unit. No suspects connected to terrorism were prosecuted or imprisoned, according to the media. Authorities said that during the COVID-19 epidemic, border controls and restricted in-country travel hampered the passage of terrorist networks, resulting in a downward trend in arrests. According to officials, Malaysia is still concerned about terrorists crossing its porous borders and maritime lanes. One Malaysian citizen was reported to have returned from Syria in 2021 by Malaysian authorities. According to reports, the government has so far brought 17 terrorist militants back to Malaysia from Iraq and Syria. According to media accounts, the returns consist of 13 adults and 4 kids, with 8 of the adults serving jail time. Those that were freed were accepted into a government-run rehabilitation program. Malaysian nationals are welcome to come home as long as they abide by regulations, checks, and a government-run rehabilitation program. Malaysia thinks that 56 fighters and their families are still in the Middle East and has apparently engaged with other nations to arrange their repatriations [35]. Executive Directorate of the Terrorism Center and Counterterrorism Committee. For participants from 13 countries, SEARCCT hosted an online seminar on youth and terrorism as a part of the yearly Malaysian Technical Cooperation Program. The center has held additional forums and seminars on current concerns including funding terrorism. Malaysia has kept up its assistance for regional and international organizations working to combat terrorism. The United Nations, the Global Counterterrorism Forum, ASEAN, the ASEAN Regional Forum, the Asia–Pacific Economic Cooperation, and the East Asia Summit all organized counterterrorism-related events that Malaysian representatives took part in.\n\nIn these whole scenarios from flashbacks to the presents, ISIS uses violence as a strategy to draw in young people and makes it newsworthy all around the world as a “trauma weaponizing” exercise. Emotional trauma is purposefully inflicted in order to propagate ideas of invincibility among the observing public as well as feelings of dread, hatred, and hopelessness within the communities that ISIS controls. According to Abdul Hamid, these strategies have been crucial in persuading significant numbers of Muslim youngsters, notably those from Southeast Asia, to make the lifelong trip of Hijrah (emigration) to regions of the Middle East governed by ISIS [36, 37]. Before traveling to the Middle East, the majority are radicalized by social media propaganda through contacts made on Facebook, Skype, or YouTube and even in video games. The ISIS produced a number of games in the name of entertainment but all these games leading to terrorist activities [39] and in the era of 2023 at this time this video has 89K viewers which is great number (See Figs. 2 and 3).\n\nWhen young people—who are not always uneducated—respond to radical appeals, it is a grim situation. 39 percent of Muslims in Malaysia feel that violence can be permissible against those who oppose Islam, and ISIS propaganda encourages terrorist strikes against Malaysia because it is ‘sinning’. In order to understand why young people in Malaysia are reacting to extremism and what can be done to stop it, the government must give both of these topics significant thought.\n\n1.6 Social climate and online radicalization\n\nThe digital revolution has brought online platforms into every part of people’s life. Extremist and radical groups are now using online media as a means of disseminating their political views and launching social movements. The establishment and maintenance of relationships with the target audience is accomplished by terrorist groups via political communication and propaganda techniques. With the growth and variety of technology-based mass media tools, they have enhanced their perception and propaganda power in online spaces. recruiting, money, logistics, and publicity. Shortland asserts that Jihadist extreme organizations congregate online using social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Telegram and recruit followers by holding religious debates. Particularly since the September 11th attacks, open and accessible networks rather than exclusive forums for jihadist organizations have gained prominence. However, many members of terrorist groups have resorted to the internet and put motivating comments on the websites they frequent in reaction to the rising anti-terrorism activities.\n\nIt is understandable that the events of September 11 marked a turning point in the way terrorist actions are carried out online and through social media. After this time, these networks became the focus of information gathering, counterterrorism operations, and law enforcement efforts. The quantity of people who use the internet often is the reason terrorist groups are so interested in social media. There will be 4.9 billion internet users worldwide in 2021. According to the Brookings Institution’s 2019 assessment on ISIS sympathizers on Twitter, there are at least 55,000 ISIS-supporting Twitter accounts can be found online (https://www.ntv.com.tr/dunya/bmden-internet-raporu), moreover, the site https://www.brookings.edu as well involved. It has been shown that most people who use internet platforms do not seek out material that could refute radical viewpoints, preferring to stick with concepts that support or are founded on their present convictions. In this way, the internet acts as an echo chamber, creating a society that is even more polarized and radicalized and exposing like-minded individuals in a disproportionate amount to arguments that support radicalization while disregarding competing viewpoints forms [40]. Due to interactions between individuals, when their spiritual requirements are met, they advance to the next step of the radicalization process. At this point, people are more prone to participate in delinquent or deviant conduct, according to the social learning hypothesis, when they are exposed to deviant attitudes through various channels. It is also recognized that the new social media platforms enable users to separate themselves from ideologically comparable groups, and that this isolation raises the risk of being exposed to violent ideas, particularly as more impressionable young people use these platforms on a regular basis. Users on these platforms are starting to characterize political violence and similar behaviors positively or neutrally because they interact with extremist views on the new social media. Young people take the next stage in radicalization when they realize that violence and pro-violent behavior are required as the process progresses [41].\n\nThe International Center for Combating Terrorism included in a study on radicalization and terrorism, It has been seen that some who converted to Islam in Western nations, particularly the United States, support extremism according to the jihadist interpretation and take part in international conflicts as foreign fighters. According to research by Wintrobe in the United States, 29% of a local sample of Jihadist were converts. The analysis of 124 radicalized samples of converts showed a 25-year-old median age. These people noticed that the Muslim world was being attacked by Western nations. Jahanzeb Malik, a member of the terrorist group Al-Qaeda who planned to blow up the American embassy in Toronto, said online that he thought western nations were attacking Muslims worldwide. He urged Canadians to support the Muslim world [42]. In a propaganda film shared on social media and jihadist websites in 2019, John Maguire called for Canadians to jihad against the west. He asserted that jihad is a duty for all Muslims and chastised the Canadian government of joining the alliance against ISIS. He claimed that two recent terrorist attacks in Canada were justified since Canadians took part in a military campaign against Muslims. He said this in his speech, which celebrated the two assaults [43]. According to research by Kleinmann, of the 51 persons who got radicalized and engaged in terrorist activity, one-third (17 people) switched to a different faith. Thus, it may be claimed that among converts, individual radicalization is more prevalent [44]. The role of the Internet in terrorist operations was investigated in a sample of 223 convicted terrorists in the United Kingdom. As a result, it has been well established that the Internet serves as a medium that facilitates attack preparation and violent radicalization. Additionally, it has been shown that because extreme behaviors are employed in both domains and these two areas encourage one another, drawing a separation might lead to a false dilemma [45].\n\n1.7 The roots of extremism\n\nThe growth of the Wahhabi strain of hardline Salafism in the area during the 1970s has led a change among Southeast Asian Muslims toward a more extremist religious position. One of the fundamental issues with Wahhabism is that its takfiri ideology, which results from an exclusivist definition of Islamic monotheism (tawhid), is tied to public order and stability. This has resulted in a great deal of killing against those who are seen to have strayed outside the bounds of the Islamic faith in many different places. Islam and kufr (infidelity), which Wahhabism advocates as two opposing sides, are at war with one another until the right order is achieved. According to Khaled Abou El Fadl, Islam is essentialized into Islamism, a racist and ethnocentric religion that uses force and violence as its most effective tools [46, 47]. Islam itself is not the issue; it is Islamism. In order to achieve the apparently noble goal of establishing an Islamic state (Islamiyah Dawlah), Islamists or followers of Islamism have intellectually politicized Islam in such a way that issues of faith, spirit, and morality—cardinal components of a religion—are outweighed by politico-legal considerations. A political Islamist, who is motivated by the conviction that, once its systems are applied, Islam offers comprehensive answers to all issues in life, always sees the establishment of a sharīʿah-based legal order on Earth as the pinnacle of the Islamic cause [48].\n\nIn contrast to Islam’s rich and varied intellectual legacy, the Malaysian state’s engagement in strictly essentialist politicization of Islam fosters popular support of extreme interpretations of Islam. A Malay Islamic state is the goal of the ethnocentric Islamic discourse in Malaysia, which is focused on Ketuanan Melayu (supremacy of Malay) and is now referred to as Ketuanan Islam (Islamic supremacy), according to Chin. This sense of superiority is the main cause of Malaysian Islam’s radicalization, which endangers Malaysia’s status as a democratic nation-state. The ‘Arabisation’ of Malay society is another effect of Wahhabism. Assimilation of cultures is common throughout the world, and over the history of Islam, the Malays have incorporated numerous Arab cultural and theological features. Although the Malay community, which was formerly famed for its progressive interpretation of Islamic teachings, has seen a rapid growth of religious conservatism, the word “Arabization” in this context refers to this phenomenon [49]. The latest surge of the phenomena of “Arabization” can be explained by the Muslims in Malaysia who feel inferior. The Malays, according to Syed Farid al-Attas, frequently have very poor self-esteem. They mimic the Arabs in every way because they believe they are more true Muslims than they are.\n\nModern Malay people struggle with feelings of insecurity and self-loathing, which may be one of the reasons they are susceptible to ISIS propaganda. They tend to mindlessly adopt even the most extremist views that come from the Arabs and see them as genuine Islamic teaching because of their lack of religious knowledge [50]. The leading political parties, primarily UMNO and PAS, have long cited their religious affiliations as a source of legitimacy. Islam has therefore developed into a crucial tool in the political sector to win over more voters and win over the populace. This political environment provides the ideal environment for utilizing religious credentials to gain favor with the people and at the lowest echelons of society and government. It is also possible to see the recent radicalization of certain Malaysian Muslims in a larger context as a response to the challenges facing the Muslim world. The Arab Spring, which saw people fight for true democracy and good government, has now turned most of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) into a hotspot of extremism and bloodshed. These uprisings were brought on by the administration’s ongoing disregard for the rights of its constituents.\n\nDuring the decolonization process, imperial nations handed up authority of their former colonies to local puppet regimes. Due to their political timidity and vanity, these governments were reliant on the wishes of their predecessors. Through peaceful Islamic principles like consultation, a democratic form of governance with fair elections, government accountability, and support for human rights, there have been few opportunities to change the unequal institutions. Problems have also been brought about by the introduction of contemporary election systems and democratic decision-making practices of the western variety in the Muslim world [51]. The majority of the Middle East’s autocratic leaders assert that they were chosen democratically. These elections, however, lack transparency and are frequently rigged by current or previous colonial powers. The evils and wrongdoings of the past have molded the modern Muslim world, which is still affected by outside forces [52]. Most of the MENA governments have authoritarian leaders that do not address the demands of their citizens or foster public trust, appreciation, and honesty between the political elite and the general population, which causes the public to suffer. For many years, the area was taken advantage of by individuals who were only interested in controlling wealth and resources and who cared little or nothing for the wellbeing of its people.\n\nPeople throughout the Muslim world are weary of the never-ending cycle of authoritarianism, political and economic exploitation, pervasive corruption, and poverty. The Arab Spring represented the optimism for good change held by many. Sadly, rather than doing good, it increased suffering, violence, and societal problems. The advent of ISIS at the conclusion of the Arab Spring proved that bringing western democracy to the Muslim world would not be a panacea for the region’s ingrained socio-political issues. Muslims all around the world are heartbroken and enraged by such a gloomy situation, which frequently prompts them to look for someone to hold accountable for the failings. The targeted citizens, loved ones, friends, and Muslims throughout the world experience rage and grief as a result of US and Russian drone operations against extremist groups. Since the September 11 attacks, Islamophobia in western nations and media escalation of this conflict have left many Muslims disillusioned with the results of the US-led ‘conflict on Terror’. These elements significantly contribute to the differences between “us” and “them” that are felt in the Muslim world [53]. As a result, Muslims worldwide, especially those in Malaysia, develop empathy with and concern for the issues faced by other Muslims. With a few rare exceptions, national and ethnic identities that were wholly secular could not coexist with religious identity or the sense of belonging to a single undivided ummah (religious community). The current separation of the globe into “us” and “them” is a result of the US-led “War on Terror,” [54] and it has increased Muslims’ allegiance to the global Muslim community, which frequently feels oppressed and denigrated. Instead of focusing on localizing this problem into regional and national problems, the phenomena of the radicalization of Malaysian Muslims should be assessed within the context of the current geopolitics and stability of the Muslim world [55].\n\n1.8 Overview and analytical verdict making\n\nMalaysia has been plagued by racial, religious, and reform polarization for decades, which has significantly influenced its political politics. Ethnic minorities have been recognized as second-class citizens ever since the country’s independence in 1957, while the ethnic Malay majority has had a unique status that is safeguarded by the constitution. The fact that two additional cleavages—over religion and divergent ideologies for political reform—overlap with and frequently exacerbate ethnic divisions is what makes Malaysia’s polarization so difficult. In order to gain support and seize power, political elites may attempt to minimize one or more of these rifts while simultaneously frequently appealing to these divisions to rally their followers. Ultimately, however, these divisive issues have thwarted attempts to achieve political agreements, hindered the passage of desperately needed reforms, and exacerbated political instability. Recent evidence of the destructive impacts of polarization may be seen in February 2020, when stark, identity-based differences played a role in the downfall of the most inclusive, secular administration in the history of the nation. Furthermore, polarization is increasingly permeating Malaysian society, endangering interethnic harmony and undermining social cohesion, despite the fact that it is mostly limited to the elite.\n\nMoreover, Racial polarization has grown even more intense on the topic of political change, which is founded in various views of state authority. The idea that Malay political elites are the community’s guardians and, as a result, have an inherent right to govern state resources however they see appropriate, including for their own personal gain, has been widely spread. This viewpoint, which is based on a feudal paradigm of governance, suggests that the populace needs to be obedient and devoted to those who are protecting them. This idea has been contested by other elites and Malaysia’s growing civil society, which has advocated for a more participatory system, insisting that the government should respect the opinions, interests, and rights of common people. They have directly criticized the actions of political elites by calling for restrictions on corruption and power abuse. Both parties, the self-proclaimed “protectors” and the “participants,” call for reform, but they have quite different notions about what reform entails and who it should empower. In order to retain and seize power, elites in Malaysia have engaged in extensive mobilization around divisive differences during the past twenty years [1]. Political campaigns have transformed into zero-sum games that have institutionalized a culture of political takedown. The state still acts as a conduit for elitist favor and even looting [2]. Political parties turn to divisive language and mobilization when they lose support in the middle to protect their base."
