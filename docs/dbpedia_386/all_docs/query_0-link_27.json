        "text": "KUCHING, March 23: A study on the proposed increase of Dewan Rakyat seats for Sarawak and Sabah will be carried out before it is presented to the Cabinet for consideration and approval.\n\nAccording to a news report from Sarawak Public Communication Unit (Ukas) today, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Law and Institutional Reform) Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said pointed out that amendments to Article 46 of the Federal Constitution related to the composition of members of the Dewan Rakyat will need the approval of two-thirds of the members.\n\nShe explained that the Election Commission (EC) is the party responsible for carrying out the Demarcation Review based on the requirements under Clause (2) Article 113 of the Federal Constitution.\n\nAzalina said this when answering a question from Serian MP Dato Sri Richard Riot Jaem during a question and answer session in the Dewan Rakyat yesterday (March 22).\n\nShe added that the study will take some time because it involves amendments to the law, particularly related to the Federal Constitution. — DayakDaily"
