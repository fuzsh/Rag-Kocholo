It was supported by IDEAS, civil society organisations (CSOs) and members of parliament (MPs) from across the political divide to advocate and establish expert grounds for the deliberation of issues in political financing.\n\nThis week, we feature the chronology of the APPGM on Political Financing, from its approval by the Secretary of the Dewan Rakyat on 20 April 2022 to recent developments in aiming for a Political Financing Act (PFA) to be passed into law.\n\nStay tuned as we feature more infographics on the contents of the draft Bill on Political Financing, submitted as a Private Memberâ€™s Bill to the Secretary of the Dewan Rakyat on 13 July 2022.\n\nFor IDEAS-related work and news, and opinions on political financing, visit IDEAS website\n\n#PFANow #PoliticalFinancing #AktaPendanaanPolitik"
