        "text": "Sabah branch of a political party of Malaysia\n\nUnited Malays National Organisation of Sabah (Malay: Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Bersatu Sabah), also abbreviated as Sabah UMNO, is a branch of the United Malays National Organisation in Sabah, Malaysia. Sabah UMNO supported and was part of the federal government under Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Sabah UMNO also had one elected representatives holding a deputy ministerial positions respectively in the Anwar Ibrahim cabinet.[1]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nEstablishment of the Sabah UMNO branch\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the 1990 state election when BERJAYA themselves were ousted by United Sabah Party (PBS), USNO Chairman Mustapha Harun returned to team-up with BERJAYA Chairman Harris Salleh in a merger of USNO and BERJAYA for his long-envisaged initiative to create the Sabah chapter of peninsula-based United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) with Mustapha himself became its first chief of UMNO Sabah.[2] In 1996, USNO was finally de-registered by the federal Registrar of Societies (RoS). Six of its legislators joined the Sabah UMNO while the rest joined the opposition PBS.[3]\n\nMass resignations of BN members and Sabah UMNO leadership from the party\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 11 December 2018, BN chairman and Sabah UMNO chairman Hajiji Noor along with Musbah Jamli, Japlin Akim, Ghulam Haidar Khan Bahadar, Mohd Arifin Mohd Arif, Isnin Aliasnih, Matbali Musah, Masidi Manjun, Nizam Abu Bakar Titingan, Abdul Rahim Bakri, Azizah Mohd Dun, Ronald Kiandee, Zakaria Edris, Yamani Hafez Musa, John Ambrose, Abdul Ghani Mohamed Yassin, and Wetrom Bahanda led and announced the mass resignations of BN members and the entire leadership of Sabah UMNO from the party and declared to be an independent politician. Hajiji said, \"Unfortunately, UMNO is now like it used to be. The existing leadership does not have a clear political direction. We are not sure where UMNO is headed. There are conflicting statements about his future, depending on who you talk to in the current leadership.\"[4]\n\nAfter the announcement, media reports suggested that Sabah UMNO had collapsed or been dissolved. However, UMNO President Ahmad Zahid Hamidi denied the suggestion and Sabah UMNO will not be disbanded due to the group's actions. He also stressed that Sabah UMNO would remain to exist and its leadership would be restructured by remaining members. On 12 December 2018 Member of Parliament for Kinabatangan, Bung Moktar Radin, was appointed as the new Sabah UMNO Chairman to replace Hajiji Mohd Noor. For other positions, Sepanggar Division UMNO Chief, Yakub Khan was appointed as UMNO Sabah Deputy Chairman, Kinabatangan Division UMNO Deputy Chief, Jafry Ariffin as UMNO Sabah Secretary and Tenom UMNO Division Chief, Raime Unggi as State UMNO Information Chief.[5]\n\nSabah political crisis\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 2023 Sabah political crisis\n\nOn 6 January 2023, state government of Sabah led by Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) collapsed when its coalition party Barisan Nasional (BN) withdrew its support.[6] The Leader of UMNO Sabah, a component party of BN, Bung Moktar Radin, Kinabatangan Member of Parliemnt and Lamag Assemblyman, cited a lack of confidence in the leadership of Chief Minister of Sabah Hajiji Noor in the withdrawal.[7]\n\nAs of 6 February, there are no changes in the status quo regarding the government of Sabah, following the decision of 5 UMNO MLAs (Shahelmey Yahya (Tanjung Keramat), Jasnih Daya (Pantai Dalit), Yusof Yacob (Sindumin), James Ratib (Sugut) and Mohd Arsad Bistari (Tempasuk)) who publicly supported Hajiji despite Bung's decision, and reshuffle of the state cabinet on 11 January as a result.[8]\n\nOn 12 February 2023, Barisan Nasional Secretary General, Zambry Abdul Kadir said Barisan Nasional decided to support the Sabah Government led by Hajiji Noor as Sabah Chief Minister.[9]\n\nOn 21 February 2023, Yusof Yacob, along with other 8 MLAs support Hajiji.
