        "text": "IPOH: As Malaysians, anyone has the right to go to court if they are unhappy over an issue, says Dewan Rakyat Speaker Tan Sri Johari Abdul.\n\nHe was commenting on Bersatu president Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin’s comment that the party would consult its lawyers and file legal action to contest the Speaker’s ruling that the six lawmakers that Bersatu stripped of membership need not vacate their parliamentary seats.\n\nJohari said that, according to the constitution, the Speaker’s decision in matters related to the August House is final.\n\n“However, as Malaysians, we have another avenue, which is the courts. So, every Malaysian has the right to go to court.\n\n“So for me, that is the right he (Muhyiddin) can use, but I have not heard anything concerning the matter so far,” he told reporters after visiting the Perak State Legislative Assembly here on Monday (Aug 5).\n\nThe working visit was his third, after Melaka and Negeri Sembilan.\n\nJohari added that it was Muhyiddin's right and that he did not want to touch on the matter.\n\nOn July 11, the six expelled Bersatu MPs got to keep their parliamentary seats when Johari reached the decision even though they had ceased to be party members.\n\nJohari had said that the Bersatu’s new regulations, which declared that the six had ceased to be members, had violated the Federal Constitution and laws related to Parliament."
