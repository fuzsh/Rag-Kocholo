        "text": "Three weeks ago, I was having a conversation with one of my friends in Malaysia through Instagram. I was giving a comment to her Instagram story regarding the turbulent current political situation in Malaysian government. And then, I mentioned a name of the politician which I reminded about Malaysia and that is Dato Anwar Ibrahim and I say that he should be the next Prime Minister of Malaysia to replace Muhyiddin Yassin who was usurping the seat after the disagreement came from Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad. But, her response when I mentioned Anwar Ibrahim makes me shock. According to her comment, as it turns out Anwar Ibrahim is like the two side of coin where there is a good side and a bad side. But that terms is coined out with the reality that the Malaysians were hating him due to much of his critics to the government while he also not providing any comprehensive solutions. As far as we know, currently Malaysia is still facing the political crisis and probably the longest one in the national history of Malaysia since 2020.\n\nBefore we know what’s happening in the Malaysia politics these days, we must look deeply about Malaysia and its political system to gain an understanding of the issue. Malaysia is known as one of the Muslim countries in Southeast Asia along with Indonesia, but the political system in Malaysia were based on race supremacy (in this case, the Malay supremacy) and the politicization of religion. Based on Malaysian demographics percentages, the Malays were dominant ethnic rather than Chinese and Indians who become a part of the minority ethnics. And mostly of the Malays were held the seats in the government, from federal to regional in each states which includes the members of Parliament and judicial members. The head of state of Malaysia known as Yang di-Pertuan Agong which is the elected monarch rotated through rulers of the nine states (Kedah, Perak, Perlis, Terengganu, Johor, Negeri Sembilan, Kelantan, Pahang and Selangor) while the head of government is the Prime Minister which also heading the cabinet and gained the majority of MPs in Parliament (Dewan Negara/Senate and Dewan Rakyat/House of Representatives). Since the independence on 31 August 1957, the Malaysian government and the parliament was ruled by UMNO (United Malays National Organisation) and its coalition parties called as Barisan Nasional/BN for almost 60 years until they were defeated in 2018 general election. Every Malaysian prime ministers from Tunku Abdul Rahman until Najib Razak were members of UMNO, including the Leader of the Opposition Anwar Ibrahim who was a former member.\n\nWhile Barisan Nasional become the ruling coalition party in the Malaysian government, factionalism was began to grew inside UMNO and it was started during the UMNO party leadership election in 1987. During this event, it was showed that there was a power struggle between Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamad and the politician Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah. The UMNO internal conflict was led to the 1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis which makes the Lord President of the Federal Court, Tun Salleh Abas were removed from his seat. And the factionalism is continued again when Anwar Ibrahim came aboard in Mahathir Mohamad’s cabinet in the early 1990s. He was a young prominent politician and to be considered as the protege by Mahathir himself and possibly the successor as the next Prime Minister of Malaysia. Anwar was proving himself as the capable politician under Mahathir’s government during 1997–1998 Asian Financial Crisis which was also hit Malaysia’s economy. As the Minister of Finance, he was entrusted by Mahathir to handle the Malaysia’s economy and the upcoming meetings with International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank who had a proposals to rescue the national economy. However, during 1998 crisis, Anwar reputations was deteriorated caused by the rumors that was spreading about allegation of his homosexual relationship which led to the accusation of sodomy case and makes Mahathir expel him from the cabinet. The scandal was the beginning of series of the political attacks towards Anwar Ibrahim — possibly ruined his political life— because he was also charged with corruption based on the rumors that was spread out by Khalid Jafri, former editor at newspaper Utusan Malaysia and failed magazine Harian National.\n\nMahathir was officially fired Anwar Ibrahim from the cabinet on 2 September 1998 and soon after he was fired, Anwar was entering guilty for the sodomy case trial. On April 1999, Malaysian High Court was sentencing Anwar to six-year imprisonment for corruption and sodomy although during the High Court sentences, there was a controversy regarding the evidence of Anwar Ibrahim committing the sodomy which was meddled by the government and law enforcement. On 2 September 2004, the Federal Court was decided to overturn the Anwar’s conviction and thus he was released from the prison. The Anwar sodomy case trial was viewed by international watchdogs such as Amnesty International as the form of “political motivated” which the Malaysian government were meddling with the evidences. Ever since then, Anwar Ibrahim becomes a political rival for Mahathir Mohamad and the UMNO/BN. The sodomy case trial of Anwar Ibrahim become a political weapon for UMNO/BN in order to kept the opposition parties out from power and ensuring them not to gaining the majority in the parliament.\n\nIn short, Anwar Ibrahim had a long path to power due to the challenges that came from the government who were under the grip of UMNO/BN. But, the Malaysians are began to support him while the other still despised him due to the sodomy case scandal. But for this time, the Goddess of Fortune was sided with Anwar and the opposition parties under the name of Pakatan Harapan. In 2016, Malaysia was hit by the 1MDB scandal which was involving Prime Minister Najib Razak and several others such as businessman Jho Low, movie production company Red Granite Pictures and Prime Minister Razak’s wife, Rosmah Mansor. The scandal was left Malaysia under economic crisis and debts with estimated amount RM 2.67 billion (approximately US$ 700 million) which was stolen by Prime Minister Razak from state-owned enterprises called 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) and it was allegedly used to funding the jet set lifestyle of Jho Low, the production of Martin Scorsese movie “The Wolf of Wall Street”, and to buy expensive jewels and bags for Prime Minister Razak’s wife.\n\nThe members of Parliament, either from Barisan Nasional or Pakatan Harapan, Najib cabinet members, former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and including Leader of the Opposition Anwar Ibrahim was criticizing the kleptocracy act that was committed by Najib Razak and was pressuring him to resign as the Prime Minister of Malaysia. But Najib still denies his involvement in the scandal and he was stated that the scandal was merely a political attack created by the opposition parties and for that he is not intended to resign as prime minister or UMNO leadership. Najib statements creates the distrust and anger from majority of Malaysians because the 1MDB scandal has crippled the national economy especially the state treasury which left Malaysia falls deep into debts. But, what is more complicated on this scandal was Najib was ordered the Ministry of Finance who had a responsible for 1MDB to starting the investigation with the ultimate goal to restore the government confidence in front of Malaysian people. However the investigations result from Ministry of Finance through Public Accounts Committee (PAC) was arrived at the Prime Minister Razak desk and he was covering up the investigation in order not to being arrested or charged by the court. In order to covering up his action, Najib was choose not to disclosed the investigation report and change the report status to become top secret under Official Secret Act.\n\nAs the 1MDB scandal becomes more complicated and full of plot twist, the UMNO were not realized that the scandal has contributing a political damage for the BN and gained more support for Anwar Ibrahim’s coalition party alliance, Pakatan Harapan (PKH). The damage was become more worsened for BN with the news regarding Najib Razak was targeted by the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) due to the new evidence that connecting the 1MDB fund has also been channeling through one of the America’s prominent investment banks, Goldman Sachs which two of their bank executives were alleged knowing the transaction that was conducted by Najib to the bank. In short, Prime Minister Razak dissolved the parliament and calls for the election on May 9, 2018 to ensure Barisan Nasional were still in power. However, as it turns out, the result of 2018 general election was unprecedented with the big victory and for the first time in history that the opposition parties coalition gained a majority in Parliament. PKH under Anwar Ibrahim leadership were winning the election which part of it was came from the stunning political move by Mahathir Mohamad who was left UMNO in 2016 during 1MDB scandal after the disappointment with Najib Razak government. Mahathir left UMNO along with several of its prominent members which also including with Najib former cabinet members such as Muhyiddin Yassin which become a prominent figure in 2020–2021 Malaysia political crisis.\n\nAfter Mahathir left UMNO, he was forming a new party called BERSATU (Partai Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia) along with former UMNO members and Najib cabinet ministers in September 7, 2016 and the party become aligned with the Anwar Ibrahim coalition, Pakatan Harapan which it was viewed as the surprising political maneuver by Malaysians and it was gained the international attention during 2018 election. Mahathir Mohamad was finally reconciled with his former enemy, Anwar Ibrahim who at that time was still in jail since 2014 due to allegation of second sodomy case. Mahathir’s political maneuver has boosting the supports for BERSATU and PKH itself before the election and the Malaysian are welcoming his action that and believe it will bring hope for the country to restore the confidence in the government and also repairing the national economy damage caused by Najib’s corruption through 1MDB scandal. After the 2018 election, Mahathir was successfully securing the royal pardon for Anwar Ibrahim to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong Sultan Muhammad V of Kelantan.\n\nMahathir Mohamad returns as the Prime Minister of Malaysia after 15 years the retirement since 2003. The Malaysian peoples and the international was considering Mahathir Mohamad return to the politics as an “epic comeback” along with his political move through forged an alliance with his enemy, Anwar Ibrahim in order to “overthrow” the dominance of UMNO/BN for 60 years. Mahathir Mohamad was taking an oath of office on 10 May 2018 and making him as the eldest head of government in the world (93 years old at that time) and the first Malaysian prime minister to served two non-consecutive terms (1981–2003 and 2018–2020) and also the first prime minister to served from two different political parties (UMNO/BN and BERSATU/PKH). Mahathir was stated that he will not held the prime minister seat for a long term and instead he was considering to handover the seat to Anwar Ibrahim in two years since he is the leader of PKH coalition. Since then, Anwar Ibrahim was nicknamed by the national and international media as the “Malaysian Prime Minister-in-waiting”.\n\nHowever, in the early 2020, tension were rise inside Pakatan Harapan due to the deadline that was set by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to handover the seat to the Anwar Ibrahim. On November 2019, Prime Minister Mahathir was stated that he will handover the seat to Anwar after the APEC Summit in Malaysia on November 2020. Tension were started by the political conflict that was started by deputy president of Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR), Azmin Ali who had a sour relationship with the president of PKR, Anwar Ibrahim. Azmin was accused by several members of PKR that he was blocking Anwar from the prime minister seat which it is been promised by Mahathir. As it turns out, the conflicts become grew bigger and had an political impact inside Pakatan Harapan coalition parties.\n\nThe internal conflict inside Pakatan Harapan that was grew bigger makes Anwar Ibrahim become alarmed on his position and trying to reaffirming on Mahathir’s promise to him. Then, Azmin Ali was launching a political maneuver in order to block Anwar Ibrahim for the succession as prime minister. He was beginning to make an audience with Yang di-Pertuan Agong Sultan Abdullah of Pahang on 23 February 2020 along with several party leaders such as Muhyiddin Yassin from BERSATU, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi from UMNO, Hadi Awang from PAS (Parti Islam Se-Malaysia), Abang Johari Openg from GPS (Gabungan Parti Sarawak) and Shafie Apdal from WARISAN (Parti Warisan Sabah), to discuss the recent political development and the possible of the formation of new government and the support for a new prime minister. Azmin maneuver was successfully blocking the possibilities of Anwar Ibrahim to succeed as the prime minister. The political maneuver which was conducted by Azmin Ali and Muhyiddin Yassin was known as the Sheraton Move since Azmin and other prominent opposition members such as UMNO, PAS and including Sarawak and Sabah parties were held a meeting in Sheraton Hotel at Petaling Jaya.\n\nThe Sheraton Move has already damaging the Mahathir’s government. Anwar Ibrahim had a meeting with Mahathir on 24 February 2020 to discuss the internal conflict and the “treachery action” conducted by Pakatan Harapan members such as Azmin Ali from PKR and Muhyiddin Yassin from Mahathir’s party, BERSATU. Mahathir was ensuring Anwar that the treachery action was not from his order and after the meeting, Anwar was held a press conference and stated that Mahathir had nothing to do with the internal conflict which includes one of his own party members, Muhyiddin Yassin. However, the conflict become more intensified as Anwar was firing Azmin from PKR along several members who joined Azmin faction. Then, Azmin Ali was held a press conference to announce a new alliance to breakaway from Pakatan Harapan coalition which brings to the collapse of Mahathir’s government. Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia has receiving the letter of resignation from Prime Minister Mahathir due to the collapse of the government ruling party coalition on the night at 9pm on the same day, then Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Sultan Abdullah of Pahang, was appointing Mahathir as the interim prime minister until the new appointment of prime minister from new coalition parties government formed by Azmin Ali. Mahathir was officially resigned on 1 March 2020 and was replaced by Muhyiddin Yassin, Mahathir’s number two in BERSATU.\n\nMuhyiddin Yassin gained support from the new alliance which consists of several political alliances such as Perikatan Nasional (PN), Barisan Nasional (BN), Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS) and Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS). The appointment of Muhyiddin Yassin as the prime minister was causing an outrage for Pakatan Harapan supporters and the confusion among the politicians due to the quick political change and it was making the supporters from Pakatan Harapan was protesting the unfair and treachery action by former allies in order to blocking Anwar Ibrahim to become Prime Minister of Malaysia. My Malaysian friend was also adding to her comments that since from the beginning, Mahathir was never intended to give the prime minister seat to Anwar. The politics that shaping the Malaysian government has been making the peoples become more weary especially when COVID-19 pandemic was hit the country on March and April 2020. The Malaysians including Anwar Ibrahim and Mahathir Mohamad was criticizing Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin for the lack of swift actions by the government to handle the COVID-19 pandemic as the positive and death case become more grew each day.\n\nThroughout 2020 and 2021, according to the data from World Health Organization (WHO), Malaysia has recorded COVID-19 cases about 1,640,843 confirmed cases with 15,211 deaths (until 27 August 2021) while the vaccination doses that has been administered about 29,886,548 doses. Even though the vaccination program was on progress, in 2021, Malaysia has recorded a surging confirmed cases and was surpassing Indonesia to become epicenter in Asia. Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin become more incapable to handle the COVID-19 pandemic, even he was already put a restrictions and lockdown back and forth in many times since he ascended to Putrajaya (Prime Minister’s Office and Malaysia seat of government). The incapable Muhyiddin’s government was also contributed from the political crisis that is still ongoing with several politicians that were BERSATU members was left the party and joined with Mahathir & Anwar’s bloc rather than “shaking hands” with UMNO which they viewed as a stain in Malaysia politics due to 1MDB scandal. In the end, the political crisis become a boomerang for Muhyiddin as Perikatan Nasional (PN) has left the coalition which was collapsing his government and led to his resignation on 21 August 2021. Muhyiddin Yassin was replaced by Perikatan Nasional leader and also member of the UMNO, Ismail Sabri Yaakob which marking as the return of UMNO in the government after two years being seated on the opposition bench in parliament.\n\nDespite of all the political crisis that happens in Malaysia, including the complicated relationship between Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad and Dato Seri Anwar Ibrahim, the one thing that we need to ask is does Anwar Ibrahim still have a shot to become the Prime Minister of Malaysia? Despite the COVID-19 pandemic still ongoing and the UMNO is returned to the government, does these situation will affect Anwar’s shot to become the prime minister? Well, we must realize that the political situation were still fluid and could change. The political crisis still ongoing. Now, Anwar Ibrahim and Mahathir Mohamad was on the same boat as the opposition leaders which makes both of them must consider every political move and make a careful calculation in order to put the Pakatan Harapan back into power and thus making the dream of Anwar Ibrahim to be a prime minister become true. Although both of them were not in the young ages and despise the hatred still haunted on Anwar Ibrahim, it is possible that Anwar Ibrahim would become the Prime Minister of Malaysia in the near future. It is the matter of how Anwar and Pakatan Harapan could convinced the Malaysian peoples once again that he can lead the country far more better without the political conflict and create the efficient, accountable inclusive and multicultural government. We had to remember that Malaysia still had many issues to address such as the 1MDB scandal accountability, racial issues inside the government which divided the society and politics, economy recovery and also health issues due to COVID-19 pandemic. Anwar Ibrahim may be hated by the UMNO politicians and supporters or some peoples, but his struggles for Malaysian democracy and inclusive government is a worth idea that needs to be put into realization."
