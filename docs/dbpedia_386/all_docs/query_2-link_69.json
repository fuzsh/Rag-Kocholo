        "text": "http://steadyaku-steadyaku-husseinhamid.blogspot.com (October 26, 2009)\n\nOn PKR Sabah\n\nby Hussein Hamid\n\nRe: People Parliment article “The End Days of PKR in Sabah”.\n\nQuote : “My source who was at the meeting at Merchant Square today said Anwar made it clear at the meeting that he was not going to have any of this. “No way in hell will I have Jeffrey as chief”, Anwar is reported to have blasted. Anwar, it seems, is determined to see a Muslim lead PKR in Sabah because, it is said, he insists that Muslims make up the majority in Sabah.”\n\nSteadyaku47 comments: I do not as a rule read other blogs. Just MT2Day , The Malaysian Insider and maybe some Local Media – just to keep myself current. This morning one of my friends, KS, sent me Harris posting ‘The End Days of PKR in Sabah” and asked for my comments. So comment I will – and I do so with the intention of putting the record right – as I know it -with apologies to Harris.\n\nWith all due respect to Harris I have known Anwar for over 50 years. I have yet to hear him use that “HELL” word even once. Not even when he speaks of Mahathir or UMNO! I am sure his close associates will vouch for this claim of mine. So I can say with conviction that he did not say, “No way in hell will I have Jeffrey as chief”,\n\nNow as to whether he will have Jeffrey as ‘Chief’ – is this the same Jeffrey as below:\n\nHe is known to be a controversial politician, having been detained under the infamous Internal Security Act on suspicion of plotting to secede Sabah from the federation of Malaysia. He is also known to have switched political parties a number of times, being a former member of Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS), Parti Bersatu Rakyat Sabah (PBRS), Parti Angkatan Keadilan Rakyat (AKAR Bersatu), and United Pasokmomogun Kadazandusun Murut Organisation (UPKO). In 2003, he applied to join the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) but his application was rejected. He is currently the Vice President of Parti Keadilan Rakyat.\n\nIn the Malaysian General Election 2008, he challenged his brother Joseph Pairin from Barisan Nasional–Parti Bersatu Sabah at the Keningau Parliamentary Constituency, but lost.\n\nWilkipedia\n\nIf he is then it is not only in Peninsular Malaysia that we are burden with one katak call “Ibrahim Ali’ but there is also one in Sabah. Now if my common sense dictates that I will not want this Ibrahim Ali to be on my team when I am going against another team call UMNO – why would anybody want Jeffery to lead any team against UMNO? You would need to be a moron to trust this guy with anything, much less the future of Pakatan Rakyat! And I know Anwar is not one! You need Jeffery like you would need a hole in your head.\n\nAnother quote from Harris article:\n\n“In a fax message addressed to PKR president Wan Azizah, 14 Sabah PKR division chiefs put their signatures to this message, naming just one man as their choice to lead PKR Sabah. Keningau division chief, Datuk Dr. Jeffery Kitingan, is the choice of the strongest PKR divisions in Sabah”.\n\nAgain I beg to differ. My credible sources indicated that more divisional heads support Ahmad Thamrin Hj Zaini (letters duly signed) compared to Jeffery (letters by Fax). All these letters (duly signed for Thamrin and faxed for Jeffery) were tabled at the meeting. Thamrin is aligned to Jeffery’s camp and was the Secretary to the KeADILan State Committee.\n\nAnother quote from Harris article:\n\n“Azmin’s out. The PKR division chiefs have made it clear that he’s not wanted”. There really is no need to malign Azmin. His mandate by Biro Politik Keadilan ends in October. Ditto for Mustafa Kamil in Sarawak!\n\nAnother quote:\n\n“Anwar, it seems, is determined to see a Muslim lead PKR in Sabah because, it is said, he insists that Muslims make up the majority in Sabah”. This is a most pathetic assumption to say that no Muslim is eligible. That all Muslims are deemed to be racists. I see this as a trend among those pseudo intellectuals, clearly with no roots in their own culture and tradition. Do they have any idea what impression the Sabah Muslims has of Jeffery?…and well deserved too if I may add!\n\nEnough said for now. What I have said above are based on facts that will be borne out in the time to come. As to what transpired when Anwar was in UMNO and with Mahathir I will leave it to Anwar himself to tell us. Time will reveal all that we need to know. After all we must leave Anwar with some things to tell when he does get to writing his memoirs!"
