KOTA KINABALU - Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) chairman Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor confirms four of his MPs submitted their answers to the Dewan Rakyat Speaker in regards to the claims made by Bersatu on four vacant parliamentary seats.

The Sabah Chief Minister said it was up to the Dewan Rakyat Speaker to make a decision about the matter.

"They (Bersatu) sent a petition and the four MPs had sent their answers or petitions to the Speaker.

"There are many external speculations however, the internal parties know what is happening.

"I am confident the Speaker will make the best decision because they fulfilled (conditions) not being involved in the Anti-Hopping Law," he said when met by reporters after he visited the homes of residents affected by large waves in Kampung Tanjung Aru, here, on Tuesday.

He said this when asked about the developments regarding Bersatu's actions in sending notices related to the vacancy of four parliamentary seats recently.

When asked about the development of the new party with former Bersatu members, the former Sabah Bersatu Governing Body Chief said the matter would be announced as soon as possible.

"Just wait, we will announce it as soon as possible," he said.

Sinar on Sunday reported Bersatu vice president Datuk Seri Dr Ronald Kiandee informed that Bersatu had sent vacancy notices among MPs under Article 49A(3) to the Dewan Rakyat Speaker.

The notice was to ensure the four Sabah Bersatu MPs who contested in the 15th General Election (GE15) under the GRS logo to vacate their seats.
