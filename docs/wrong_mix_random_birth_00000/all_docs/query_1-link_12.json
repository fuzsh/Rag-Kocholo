Discover many ways animals communicate. Register for either the 11:00 am OR the 1:00 pm session. Space is limited so registration is required; please call 515-462-1731 or register online. Sponsored by the Winterset Optimist Club.\n\nZen Rock Painting at 6:30 pm\n\nA quiet room, soothing music, simple painting with dots on smooth rocks . . . you need a night like this! No experience required ‚Äì it‚Äôs a one hour experience about the process of calming down and focusing rather than the finished product. Registration required or call 515-462-1731. Space is limited. This event is for teens & adults.\n\nThe Wellness Wednesdays in Winterset program on Wednesday, July 18th, will be a fun-filled Water Aerobics session at the Winterset Aquatics Center at 5:15 pm. This popular, high-energy water aerobics class will tone and sculpt your body with NO impact to your joints. Move to the rhythm of popular music and have fun while getting an invigorating workout. The two of us have been attending water aerobics semi-regularly this summer and we think that being in the water on a hot summer day makes exercising 1000% more fun! Megan will probably be at class on Wednesday if you need a buddy üôÇ\n\nDon‚Äôt forget that the Madison County Fair begins next Wednesday! The Madison County Herdsman 4H club will present a Truck Pull Wednesday evening at 7:00 pm. Admission for adults is $10, kids are $5 and under 6 get in free. You can also catch the Rough Stock Rodeo, the Circle Track Mud Run and a Mud Run during the fair. Not to mention the animals, exhibits and carnival. Click here for everything you need to know about the fair!\n\n‚ÄúAgriculture is our wisest pursuit because it will, in the end, contribute to the most real wealth, good morals, and happiness.‚Äù -Thomas Jefferson\n\nThe Winterset Stage has room still in their final Summer Stage Educational Workshop. No Words Allowed! will be held July 23rd through 26th and focuses on movement and mime. Classes are held Monday through Wednesday from 9:00 am to Noon, and Thursday from 9:00 to 5:00 with final performance for families and friends at 5:00 pm. Register at The Winterset Stage‚Äôs website or by calling 462-5156. Registration deadline is Monday, July 16th.\n\nBe sure to check out the Master Gardener class sponsored by the ISU Extension office. Application deadline will be here before we know it!\n\nSchool supplies are starting to show up in our local stores and the SchoolSupplies4KIDS Drive is in full swing at CRISP. You can sponsor a child for only $40 which will get them a backpack filled with the necessary 2018 grade-level supplies. Contact CRISP if you are interested in other opportunities to give or if you are in need of backpack for your child.\n\nFinally\n\nOur intrepid citizen, Meisha, has gone abroad and we will follow the travels here and on The Winterset Citizen facebook page as they unfold. Day One: It turns out that you don‚Äôt have to go very far to hear foreign accents and feel a little lost in the big wide world. Chicago is serving as the first stop on our travelers itinerary, a brief overnight visit and then on to other places. It‚Äôs an early day Friday with two flights, a 7 hour layover in NYC, and a 6 hour time difference on the docket. Can‚Äôt wait to get started!\n\nThank you for reading The Winterset Citizen.
