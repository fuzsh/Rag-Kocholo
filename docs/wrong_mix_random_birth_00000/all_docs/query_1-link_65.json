        "text": "We have so many talented Iowans!\n\nLast week, we told you about Haley Slaton, a Cedar Rapids woman that auditioned for the latest season of 'American Idol.' Haley revealed that her audition in front of the judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry, and Lionel Richie, would be airing on this Sunday's episode (March 20th). But, we're now finding out that she's not the only native Iowan that will be featured this weekend!\n\nSam Moss currently lives in Chicago, but she was born and raised in Winterset, Iowa. She decided to make a career out music during her time at Central College in Pella, Iowa before relocating to Illinois. According to the Des Moines Register, \"she teaches piano and runs her own business called Sam Moss Music, where she is commissioned to create songs of remembrance and for personalized special events.\" A video on Sam's official Instagram account revealed that she attended open call virtual auditions back on August 25th, and she found out two days later that she received a callback. She flew to Texas on October 1st for her live audition in front of the judges.\n\nSam's website describes her as a \"soulful singer-songwriter and mentor, on a mission to awaken a mindful, empowered, and heart-centered audience.\" She released a collection of self-produced songs on an EP called 'The Garden' in 2021, which you can purchase on her website HERE. Check out some videos of her gorgeous voice below!\n\nLike Haley, Sam's audition will also be featured on Sunday night, be we still have no idea whether either woman made it to Hollywood! We will find out for sure when the latest episode of 'American Idol' airs on ABC on March 20th at 7 p.m. We're rooting for both of them!"
