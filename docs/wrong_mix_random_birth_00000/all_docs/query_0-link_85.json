It Is You I Will Miss (Volumes 1 & 2)\n\nIt Is You I Will Miss is very much a winter mix. As with winter itself perhaps, once you’re in the thick of it, you’d never guess where you are now had its foundational roots in spring’s promising renewals and in the fierce, technicolor lushness of early summer. Of the first dozen songs I started with back in April, nearly all of them made it onto these final incarnations of It Is You I Will Miss. One of those songs was “Private Dancer,” a 1984 Tina Turner hit from the eponymous album that I grew up on, which was considered her post-divorce, post-Ike Turner Revue comeback. Tina Turner’s passing would not occur for another month and a half. In the aftermath of her death, I momentarily considered dropping “Private Dancer” from the mix list because I didn’t want its inclusion to feel like some overdetermined, cheesy homage. Or rather, I didn’t want it to feel like I was giving Tina Turner a nod only because she died. Then I decided I was overthinking, per usual: Tina Turner deserves to be given countless nods of gratitude for all the gifts she provided us with for so many decades—both as a tremendous musician and performer and as a human being. So “Private Dancer,” which remains a great song, stayed.\n\nIt’s been a busy year. The rest of the mix took much longer than expected. I had a growing list of song possibilities in a notes document in my phone, but not the time to put the thing together in an online player and blog post and make some curation and sequencing decisions.\n\nIn the intervening eight months since I jotted those first It Is You I Will Miss notes, a lot has happened.\n\nSome of what’s transpired is the heightening losses that come with the territory of being alive and middle-aged. Once you pass the 40-year mark, the pendulum of life milestones tends to shift increasingly from invites to birthdays, weddings, and baby showers to hospital visits, funerals, and memorials, sometimes dramatically. Death comes for us all, but it used to be at least one or two generations older and felt farther away. Now it’s showing up more often among my contemporaries, my friends, my peers. I know that who get sicks, lives, and dies; when; and how isn’t determined based on fairness or goodness or justice. Even so, the news in late July that Sinéad O’Connor had left this mortal plane at age 56 hit hard. Some of it was the loss of such a tremendous talent. But for anyone who came of age in the 1980s, the loss was and remains more than that. O’Connor took the music world by storm in 1987 when I was not quite 15. In the decade that followed, she continued to make her music and her activist views known with such ferocity and bravery and rage and gender-bending punk coolness that I don’t think my peers and I clocked at the time that she was only six years older than us. Realizing that my childhood friend Julie’s older sister Jenny was only a year younger than O’Connor really brought this home for me.\n\nNot everyone makes it. Sometimes we lose those who are relatively young. People my age have known that since our own youth. We grew up with the escalating Reagan-era arms race and looming threat of Cold War nuclear holocaust on the nightly news. We also moved through our entire sexual coming of age in the shadow of the most fatal years of the AIDS epidemic. And yet my partner and I make that obvious observation—not everyone makes it—to one another more and more now. As if now that we’re traversing the middle decades of life, we need to remind one another that we aren’t immune.\n\nEven without stark reminders of mortality, my own awareness that my own time on and in this cosmic journey is not infinite grows a little more acute each day. Encroaching menopause and the signs of wear and tear on a body with over a half-century’s active and occasionally foolhardy or reckless use shows up now, in all of my daily senses and sensations.\n\nMaybe because of those tiny changes and nuances in my body, I can feel my perspective on my own life and the world around me changing. It’s as though the last year has ushered in what I imagine will be a process of bringing all that’s come before into focus.\n\nI can’t say I’m thrilled with the anatomical slowing down or physical constraints that are part and parcel of aging, such as they are. However, what I will say in favor of having reached this particular life mesa is that my appreciation and gratitude for the facts and experience and even mysteries of my existence only deepens.\n\nI’ll take all the roadside scenic overlooks on offer, thanks very much:\n\nI have been with the same partner for more than half my life, and I love so much about the substantive, intimate shared existence we have built together over that time. I have now lived long enough to have a treasured and evolving adult relationship with my sister, who was inaccessible to me for so many years when she was growing up, so much so that it was hard for me to believe that might ever change. I work with some amazing, smart, and kind people in support of a worthwhile mission that attempts to makes the world a better, more equitable place; unlike at most of my past jobs, I feel more grounded than ever in my own awareness of who I am, what I do well, how I want to show up, and where my struggles and challengers are located and how they show up. In October, I went on a wellness weekend retreat with folks from a virtual weekly meditation group that I joined during the height of COVID lockdown. The meditation group had first formulated on Zoom, so I had only met two of these dear souls in person before. By the time the retreat took place, we’d been in deeply personal sessions together for nearly three years. One of the remarkable things about meeting them was that they were both old friends and new friends all at the same time the moment that we laid eyes on each other and leaned in for a hug.\n\nAs I write this, it is late in the day on December 1, and I am coming off of another World AIDS Day, an annual day of commemoration for those we have lost to AIDS. The list of names I recited in my head and heart today is long. The people in whose remembrance I traverse the world every day, in order to honor the memory of the years they were here, as well as all the years they weren’t given to live, years that I have had to become and simply to be. When I realized I’d finally be finishing and releasing It Is You I Will Miss on World AIDS Day, I added one last track—“Being Boring,” a 1990 Pet Shop Boys song that remains among the most poignant reflections on the losses so many of us carry because of AIDS.\n\nTomorrow is my 51st birthday, and I plan to embrace whatever the day brings. Since January, Peter Gabriel has been releasing a new song on the full moon of every month; in his infinite wisdom, he decided to release the complete new album comprised of those songs, i/o, today, on December 1. Now that’s what I call a great present. Happy birthday to meeeeeee.\n\nIt Is You I Will Miss has had me reflecting on the old and the new:\n\nold songs I have known for so long that relistening to them was like a genuine exploration, a slow, intentional deepening process of rediscovery—hello again, “Can You Feel It?” by The Jackson 5, “(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman” by The Kinks, “Let the Music Play” by Shannon, and “The Last Day of our Acquaintance” by Sinéad O’Connor;\n\nsongs by artists I have long loved that were somehow new to me—a T. Rex song I didn’t know? What?;\n\nnew songs and directions by artists I have followed, known, and loved for a long time—PJ Harvey, Peter Gabriel, Alison Goldfrapp, Everything But The Girl, Janelle Monáe;\n\nand songs by people I have never heard of until a few months or even a few days ago, some old and only new to me and some just plain new—thank you, Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens, Arlo Parks, Pattie Gonia.\n\nHow much joy and beauty have I experienced so far in this life and yet with still more to discover and explore every day. As a dear mentor said to me recently:\n\nHow lucky am I, how lucky are we.\n\nI’ve got a feeling this year’s for me and you.\n\nHow lucky indeed.\n\nIt Is You I Will Miss, Vol. 1:\n\nUmbra, Penumbra, Antumbra*\n\nCreated April 17, 2023–Nov. 30, 2023; posted Dec. 1, 2023\n\n* The mix title It Is You I Will Miss comes from a line of Louise Glück’s poem “Crossroads,“ from A Village Life (2009).\n\nUnholy—Sam Smith Feat.

Black Swans: A Diptych.\n\nAs part of my job leading communications and marketing for a non-profit, I oversee its social media channels. To curtail how long I stare at screens and for my own wellness, I limit my personal time on social media more and more. I’ve also considered abandoning my presence on certain social media channels altogether. Still, occasionally, I discover something beautiful or illuminating.\n\nRebecca Solnit is a funny, intelligent, thought-provoking writer and activist, and has been for a long time, so learning something remarkable from her isn’t surprising. However, Twitter being the cultural wildfire that it is, finding my most recent Solnit insight via a February 24, 2023, Twitter thread was unexpected. My delight was amplified by the fact that the thread itself was about how we as humans deal with surprises—the good, the bad, or the just plain unanticipated.\n\nSolnit observes that the term “black swan” refers to events that are rare and unexpected but have deep and impactful consequences. In many cases, these things may appear obvious in retrospect, but they come as a surprise when they happen. When I dug a little deeper into the history of this term’s symbolism, I read that its earliest usage in Western culture dates back to a second-century Latin expression written by the Roman poet Juvenal, which translated as follows: “a rare bird in the lands and very much like a black swan.” At the time Juvenal coined the phrase, the black swan was presumed to be an imaginary creature, a bird that didn’t exist. So “black swans” in language were symbolically about impossibility.\n\nIn the late 17th century, Dutch colonists exploring Western Australia came to be the first Europeans to see black swans, which were quite possible, as it turns out. At that point, the meaning of the term “black swan” transformed—from nonexistence to an assumed impossibility that later becomes disproven.\n\nIn both the recent Twitter thread and at greater length in a 2020 Lit Hub essay, “Rebecca Solnit on Black Swans, Slim Chances, and the 2020 Presidential Election,” Solnit is quick to point out that the world and life are full of black swans, some welcome and some unwelcome. But to focus solely on the type of black swan that appears is to miss the point. Solnit asserts, “What the black swans tell us is that our assumptions often blind us to the possibilities.”\n\nI’ve often feared uncertainty in that consistency can feel safer. When the shit of life comes raining down, I want to know who I can rely on to show up for me. Solnit’s point is that we would do well to avoid conflating improbability with impossibility. I would also contend that while it’s silly and reductive to romanticize all change as positive—some change ushers in and makes room for new growth, and some change is an earthquake that reduces everything, including our homes, to rubble—it’s also shortsighted to mistake familiarity for safety. If I reflect on the happenings of my life with an impartial eye, especially the most significant ones, predictability is no more a guarantee of security than anything else. We also know that life is change, as inevitable as a daily sunrise and sunset. To be alive is to fly amist flocks of black swans. Most change ruffles the feathers of our emotional selves, even when it later turns out to be a precursor to the greatest richnesses that life offers. What unsettles us today when it’s new and unexpected can turn out to be a harbinger of personal growth, renewal, and even protection. We don’t and won’t know its fuller nature and meaning until we embrace and surrender to the unpredictability and live it out.\n\nAs Solnit says, that, for me, too, is hopeful.\n\nBlack Swans, Vol. 1: What the Black Swans Tell Us*\n\nCreated Feb. 18, 2023–Mar. 12, 2023; posted Mar. 12, 2023\n\n* The Vol. 1 mix title What the Black Swans Tell Us was lifted from and inspired by a Twitter thread by the wise and brilliant writer and journalist Rebecca Solnit.\n\nLaguna Bacalar, Mexico, February 13, 2023.\n\nStrictly Business—EPMD\n\nFear the Future—St. Vincent\n\nRed Dress—TV On The Radio\n\nCall Ticketron—Run the Jewels\n\nHello—Martin Solveig (feat.

New Flavor.\n\nNearly three years have passed since the pandemic began. Time feels as elastic as ever to me, perhaps more so. Crawling. Then racing. Sometimes both at once. One minute, I was marking my 50th birthday in early December and sharing some good meals over the holidays. Then I blinked and it was late January on the calendar.\n\nA number of perpetual questions arise whenever the ticking of the clock seems to recede into meaninglessness:\n\nIs it cumulative effects of pandemic life?\n\nMiddle age?\n\nPerimenopause?\n\nInsomnia? Sociopolitical PTSD? Winter seasonal moodiness? Stress? Grief?\n\nIt’s all of the above, of course. The proportions shift, but the same factors remain play.\n\nAs distinct as the different pandemic phases and years have been—especially in NYC, where geography, dense population, and a dependence on public transportation have made us something of an ever-morphing COVID petri dish—I find myself starting to merge and conflate what occurred in what season, especially the last two. Was the St. Vincent concert last October or this past one? Did I really get my first COVID vaccine over a year and a half ago? Right before Christmas, I saw my closest friend since childhood for the first time since lockdown began, and we couldn’t for the life of us figure out when our last time together had been. I was told recently that subway ridership remains at a mere 50%, even in this “hybrid” phase we’ve been in these last 9 to 12 months. I’m commuting two or three days a week, and the 50% stat feels about right based on my own train trips.\n\nDay-to-day New York life right now gives off a surface air of familiarity and routine that harkens back to parts of pre-COVID life. But one need look no farther than my partner’s now-permanent home office, the number of Zoom meetings on my calendar, the sparse subway platforms even at rush hour, or the constant waves of restaurant closures—and the shortening and, by and large, less adventurous menus at the ones trying to do whatever they must to stay afloat (a widespread phenomenon across the food industry)—to know that urban life, and likely life everywhere, will be altered for an even longer haul.\n\nOne thing that remains a constant for me: The volume on life’s experiences, whatever they may be, is cranked higher across the entire emotional spectrum. Its flavors are more concentrated. That bouillon-cube life intensity can have an exhausting, cumulative effect, but it also means that my life-cup of gratitude for the pleasures of being alive, even down to small, mundane ordinary details, is brimming:\n\nThe grinding of coffee and the simple steps to brew a new pot in the French press.\n\nThe two cardinals who we call Mr. and Mrs. Bobby that come visit our living room window every morning.\n\nThe hrrrmmming sounds our dog Kina makes between naps and snuggles, and what each of them mean.\n\nThe stones I pick up on my pier walks—and which ones I keep and which I give back to the ocean. The sea-glass bits I find along the way.\n\nThe handful of trips I’ve made, the friends I’ve gotten to hug again, the desert and mountain hikes we’ve shared.\n\nThe live music I have been lucky enough to see and hear and bask in over the last 16 months.\n\nThe incredible artists whose work I’ve been discovering.\n\nIn one of Matt Groening’s 1980s Life In Hell comic strips, which used to appear in the long-defunct NYC newsweekly The Village Voice, a depressed character is questioning to a friend what the point of life is. The punch line is in the final frame: The friend hands the depressed guy an ice cream cone, who says, after he takes his first lick, “Hm. New flavor.”\n\nEven these past three years, perhaps especially these past three years, I have seen, heard, tasted, touched, and inhaled many new life flavors and deepened my sense of joy and gratitude for the familiar tastes I have always loved. I didn’t think it was possible to love the smell of the ocean or the vibrant texture of perfectly carbonated seltzer more than I did. But it is.\n\nSalt and the Liquid Swells Set in Motion By the Moon is an amalgamation of old and new flavors. The mix started in mid-November as a written list that I misplaced. I reconstructed the list from memory two months later, expanding it as winter set in and seasonal moods shifted. The mix title comes from a poet I’ve known since my MFA grad-school days in the late 1990s but from a poem I found for the first time this weekend. The opening track, “This Is the House,” is from the first Eurythmics album, released in 1982; I’ve had that LP on vinyl for nearly 40 years, and songs from it, including “This Is the House” have appeared on my early cassette mixes from the 1980s and early 1990s. The Elton John song is part of the soundtrack to my early childhood. Tedeschi Trucks Band was a gift that came my way right before lockdown; the live track that appears here is a cover from a show I was lucky enough to attend, the last performance in a week-long October residency at The Beacon. Two songs are new-ish tracks by talented musician friends. Songs by Health and Jimmy Reed were shared with me by my partner and a college friend with excellent taste. (I’m retroactively bummed we never had a radio show on KRLX together!) Sunflower Bean, Wet Leg, Broken Bells, and Phosphorescent were lifted from fabulous mixes made by friends. And until yesterday when I stopped to chat with Don, the Brooklyn neighborhood record seller I’ve bought music from since moving here in May 2000, I thought I had heard every song Sam Cooke had recorded; “You’re Always On My Mind” proved me wrong. The art images below are by a painter whose work has been a pandemic discovery and delight for me and a classic sculpture by Rodin that I love so much, I’ve been visiting it nearly every time I go to the Met for over 35 years.\n\nNew flavor.\n\nMay the sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami of the music elicit your delight and your dancing, bringing you to laughter and tears and then back again.\n\nSalt and the Liquid Swells Set in Motion By the Moon*\n\nCreated Nov. 14, 2022–Jan. 29, 2023; posted Jan. 29, 2023\n\n* The mix title was lifted from Dorianne Laux’s 2007 poem “Kissing Again,” which appears in its entirety below the playlist.\n\nThis is the House—Eurythmics\n\nMoment in the Sun—Sunflower Bean\n\nOne More Year—Tame Impala\n\nAnd It Rained All Night—Thom Yorke\n\nBlackstar—David Bowie\n\nFever—Velvet Dreaming\n\nStonefist—Health\n\nWet Dream—Wet Leg\n\nWake Me Up—Foals\n\nUnmoored—Outro\n\nWhen All’s Well—Everything But the Girl\n\nFever—Aldous Harding\n\nCheerleader—St. Vincent\n\nMy Babe—Spoon\n\nInhaler—Foals\n\nShakey Ground—The Temptations\n\nRemain Nameless—Florence + the Machine\n\nOctober—Broken Bells\n\nVisions of Gideon—Sufjan Stevens\n\nValley of the Ocean—SAULT\n\nGoodbye Yellow Brick Road—Elton John\n\nSong for Zula—Phosphorescent\n\nHold Me—Fleetwood Mac\n\nFine Line—Harry Styles\n\nBaby What You Want Me To Do—Jimmy Reed\n\nSign of the Times—Tedeschi Trucks Band (live, 10.08.22, NYC)\n\nGimme Sympathy (acoustic)—Metric\n\nSomebody Like Me—St. Vincent\n\nThe Pharoahs—Neko Case\n\nI’d Rather Go Blind—Etta James\n\nI Fall to Pieces—Patsy Cline\n\nDrinkin Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee—Stick McGhee & His Buddies\n\nI Love to Boogie—T.

Sex, yes, though squeezed in\n\nbetween the minor depths of anger, despair—\n\nstanding up amid the laundry\n\nor fumbling onto the strip of rug between\n\nthe coffee table and the couch. Quick, furtive,\n\nlike birds. A dance on the wing, but no time\n\nfor kissing, the luxuriant tonguing of another\n\nspongy tongue, the deft flicking and feral sucking,\n\nthat prolonged lapping that makes a smooth stone\n\nof the brain. To be lost in it, your body tumbled\n\nin sea waves, no up or down, just salt\n\nand the liquid swells set in motion\n\nby the moon, by a tremor in Istanbul, the waft\n\nof a moth wing before it plows into a halo of light.\n\nPraise the deep lustrous kiss that lasts minutes,\n\nblossoms into what feels like days, fields of tulips\n\nglossy with dew, low purple clouds piling in\n\nbeneath the distant arch of a bridge. One\n\nafter another they storm your lips, each kiss\n\na caress, autonomous and alive, spilling\n\ninto each other, streams into creeks into rivers\n\nthat grunt and break upon the gorge. Let the tongue,\n\nin its wisdom, release its stores, let the mouth,\n\ntired of talking, relax into its shapes of give\n\nand receive, its plush swelling, its slick\n\nround reveling, its primal reminiscence\n\nthat knows only the one robust world.\n\n—from Facts About the Moon, Dorianne Laux (2007).\n\nNovember 14, 2022\n\nA dear friend of mine with whom I’ve traded mixes over the years once said that listening to a mix I make is a little like going to a party or a dinner at which you only know the host and a handful of the guests. You walk in. You’re nervous, a little excited, curious, perhaps skeptical. Everyone else who arrives feels the same way you do. Somehow the stars align. Even though this unlikely group would never have convened were it not for its eclectic, odd host, everyone clicks and has a fantastic time.\n\nThat was one of the best compliments I’ve ever gotten.\n\n“The unlikely flavor combination that somehow hangs together” describes most of my aesthetic tastes—food, books, visual art, music, films, theater, architecture, you name it. Truth be told, it describes many of my personal relationships, too. I’ve always been someone who drifts between groups and individuals, most of whom would never have given each other the time of day much less connected and been friends.\n\nWhere We Live Now seems especially cut from that cloth. As I put the songs together, even I was struck by the shifts between tempos, genres, instrumentation arrangements.\n\nEveryone is welcome at this party. Bring a friend, and we’ll dance all night.\n\nWhere We Live Now\n\nCreated Oct. 10, 2022–Nov. 11, 2022; posted Nov. 14, 2022\n\nIndestructible—Robyn\n\nBissa—Fatoumata Diawara\n\nSelfish—Little Simz\n\nHad to Cry Today—Tedeschi Trucks Band (live, 12.4.21)\n\nBetter Things To Do—Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings\n\nDo It ('Til You're Satisfied)—B.T.

Intricate soundscapes pieced together in mosaic fragments over many months during snatches of time and space and thought long since forgotten. I began In the Dream I Don’t Tell Anyone in late May with about a dozen song discoveries that were in rotation on my phone at the time. That musical narrative thread was severed in July: a dead laptop, during a busy summer. Mu days were full of fits and starts and exertion in almost all parts of my life. I had my hands, head, and heart full of stilted and persistent attempts to explore new and unfamiliar territories and aspects of self.\n\nWhat seems to have emerged as In the Dream I Don’t Tell Anyone all these months later is a rippling musical cavern. The melody echoes criss-cross one another, moving back and forth for a long time, until the walls of ambient sound they create together become something that settles in the listener’s body like a hum. The tracks move between taut pop and rock ‘n’ roll songs. Sharp guitar licks and bass lines that you feel in your thighs. Live performances that sprawl with volcanic improvisation. Joyful noises of horns and strings that snarl and grind and soar with sex and sweat and wild abandon. Songs that break your private heart open and merge with whatever secrets you’re carrying in silence. Songs that announce themselves as thunderclap downpours, the ones that make you long to swim in the rain—then leave as suddenly as they arrived. Songs driven by feedback hums and gauzy guitars that flood over everything else you can hear. The internal electric current sparked from so many layers of sound is disorienting, and also beautiful and tiring and exciting.\n\nThe zig-zagging styles in In the Dream I Don’t Tell Anyone mimic the erratic weather patterns we had on the East Coast all summer. From dawn through the dark nights, many days were punctuated by six or seven distinct and disparate atmospheric waves. No matter what I wore, the common thread on any given day was that at some point, I’d be wearing the perfect outfit, and at some point, whatever clothes I was wearing would feel absurd and ill-suited to the climate.\n\nAll summer I had strange dreams in which the anxiety that stayed submerged during my waking hours surfaced like a breaching whale. Only the disruption of the breach made me realize that the unease had been under the surface all along, hovering, quiet and constant, just above the ocean floor of my most hidden self. Upon waking I would think, Oh yes. This is what trying to become more comfortable with the discomfort of life’s uncertainty without judgment or resistance feels like. Then I’d think—is even that right? What is this feeling? Is it one feeling or many? Is it pleasure? Is it pain? Is it the natural jagged trajectory of learning and making inevitable mistakes along the way? Is it loneliness? Is it peace? Is it sleeping? Is it awakening?\n\nI shared most of these dreams with no one. One dream I did share, right upon waking, because it was a longing, one I wanted to make real and live out in the sharing. The listener did not want me back. The fluid journey of boundless desire and dark radiance the dream had taken me on in my sleep was mine alone, out of sync with waking life’s reality. Outside the window of my bedroom, the morning was still full of the same rich beauty and birdsong as it had been when I first woke up, full of want, but now the misalignment between my sleeping dream life and my waking life inflamed me. Naked and vulnerable from rejection and raw, exposed hurt and disappointment, I had trouble thinking about the dream as an exploration, an imagined desire, rather than a personal failure. Even though I know better. Imagination leads us into unfamiliar territory, however wondrous it can be, and learning how to navigate the unknown and unmapped can be a painful process. I remind myself again and again that you can’t have failure around exploration. And what are our nighttime dreams if not explorations of the subconscious self? When you get tied to specific outcomes while exploring, the possibility of falling short comes with that territory. When your focus stays on the processes you are undertaking, the act of discovery itself, no matter the nature of what is unearthed, is the purpose and the meaning. Any and all outcomes stemming from the processes—good, bad, ugly, stunning—are incidental.\n\nBy the late spring, I had at least half a dozen title ideas for the mix, most of them lifted from song lyrics. I wrote them down in a mysterious place that I later could not find my way back to.\n\nThen a little over a week ago, Richard Siken’s poem “I Had A Dream About You” came my way. Reading it like walking into a clearing in a pine tree forest, one I hadn’t known I needed to visit, the mix of dead and green needles crunching underfoot and releasing their peppery scent. Like the weather, like my varied summer pursuits, the poem is rife with nested, episodic dream layers—all of them about eroticism and love and buried loss.\n\nSiken’s compulsion to excavate every dream layer in “I Had A Dream About You” was strong enough that he wrote and published two different versions of the poem five years apart. The first, which appeared in the Iowa Review, was twice the length of the one he later published in book form in his collection Crush. The later version of “I Had A Dream About You” contains no new material, just some resequenced stanzas and the haunted echo of many excised stanzas. Dreams forgotten. I was so fascinated by both versions, and the fact that they’re both effective, just different, I did a mark-up of the Iowa Review draft to sort out what Siken had revised and, word geek that I am, posted my findings on social media.\n\nThe earlier draft contains more kisses than the later one. It zooms in on bodies and spirits wrapped in prolonged embraces. It also looks straight at progressive physical decline and illness and says, Fuck you, slapping imminent grief away with an indignant, open hand. My social media posts about Siken’s edits honed in on the effects of the differences between the two drafts in more detail.\n\nToday, I am struck by what both incarnations of the poem shared. Both drafts of “I Had A Dream About You” contain secret dreams: “In the dream I don’t tell anyone, you put your head in my lap.” Both poems include love as a respite and a rescue: “In these dreams, it’s always you:/ the boy in the sweatshirt,/ the boy on the bridge, the boy who always keeps me/ from jumping off the bridge.” Both make requests—wishes—that are granted, at least in sleep: “I said kiss me here and here and here/ and you did.” Finally, both poems bloom into a secret, revealed in confidence on the page: “The dream I don’t tell anyone” becomes the dream that was told to you and only you, dear reader.\n\nIn the Dream I Don’t Tell Anyone*\n\nCreated May 17, 2022–August 22, 2022; posted Aug. 22, 2022\n\nFree—Florence + The Machine\n\nGumboots—Paul Simon\n\nBlack Cab—Jens Lekman\n\nA Lifetime To Find—Wilco\n\nLoving Cup (live)—Phish feat.

It also seems that in 1911, it was as big a deal and as pointed a political statement as it might be today that Ukrainka, who knew 10 languages and died at the age of 42 of tuberculosis, wrote the play in Ukrainian and not Russian.\n\nThings Ukrainian have been in the mix of cultural discussions of late for obvious reasons. What strikes me is how familiar much of what’s happening feels. It looks and feels like a strange xerox copy of the 1980s Cold War arms race and hair-raising apocalyptic threats of my childhood. The war in and on Ukraine also feels rooted in the same kinds of multi-generational, intercultural conflicts that have fueled immigration to the U.S. throughout its history. The same fears and desires that drove my immigrant family, and so many others, out of the countries where they were born to seek out what they hoped would be safer places to exist and be who they were openly. Filtered through the immediacy and distortions of social media, our experience of global news and modern world conflicts today may be unique, but the actual issues in play within these conflicts are old. I’d forgotten how much those clashes shaped my seminal years, my fears and hopes, and the lives of the last four or five generations of my family.\n\n“I have a heart that does not die.”\n\nI don’t speak or read Ukrainian. I don’t know whether that assertion is meant literally, figuratively, or both. But I suspect some residual traces of all we carry in our hearts remains in the shared atmosphere we move in, no matter what happens to our physical selves. In any case, I’d like to read the poems and plays of someone who writes like that.\n\nBeyond the horrors in the world news standing in stark contrast to the blooms coming up all around my neighborhood and the changes marking my day-to-day life, I can’t say why this spring mix felt different as I was making it, only that it did.\n\nMusic mixes used to be for an intended audience of two people—the giver and the receiver—with the best mixes being a reflection of both individuals.\n\nI also made some collective music mixes with college friends back in earlier Internet days.\n\nMixes for an unspecified group audience fall somewhere between those two categories. When making these collective, public pandemic mixes, inevitably some songs are reflections of people I love and think of all the time, living or dead—those whose presence in my life and in the world has forever changed my existence and my perspective, for the better. But I haven’t felt compelled before now to note those touch points of personal meaning in any shared capacity.\n\nThe Yaz (Yazoo, for my U.K. friends out there) tracks on I Have a Heart That Does Not Die are dedicated to my childhood friend Julie Hiraga Stolzberg (1972–2016), who was with me when I discovered this music in the mid-1980s, and to my adulthood friend Chris Vaughan, who I did not know in those years but who recognizes the private parts of my heart that these songs tap into.\n\nThese mixes are also dedicated to anyone and everyone who has ever experienced even a moment of pain, suffering, shame, despair, or fear over who they desire and who they love.\n\nShame and fear have no place where it concerns the deep wellsprings of our affections, desires, and eroticism. Nevertheless, the world can be a brutal place full of judgment. Attempts to codify those judgments into hate through oppressive legislation are running rampant in the U.S. right now. To those lost souls whose own fears and judgments keep them mired in compulsions to legislate their fears: “Gay” and “trans” are identities and states of being that are as much part of our world’s beauty and fabric as anything else. They always will be. Whether your views evolve or not, we exist, we love who we love and desire who we desire unapologetically, and we are not going anywhere.\n\nA wise friend of mine often observes that you can’t be in a state of fear and compassion at the same time.\n\nFor that reason, let those of us who are able and safe enough to do so shout “gay” and “trans” and all words reflecting who we are from the rooftops, in the books we read and write even as other people attempt to ban them, in the art we create and experience, in our schools and workplaces and places of worship, in the streets, in the music we sing and dance to. If you’re in an unsafe place right now, please know you’re not alone, and these dire times shall eventually change and pass. People who haven’t even met you care about you and what happens to you. These songs and this music and all the joys and tears and dancing that go with them are for you.\n\nI Have a Heart That Does Not Die*, Vol. I\n\nCreated Apr. 4–10, 2022; posted Apr. 17, 2022\n\n* title lifted from Ukrainian activist Lesia Ukrainka’s 1911 play Forest Song\n\nTogether (Crazy P Remix)—Jennifer Johns\n\nDancing Is The Best Revenge—!!! & Lea Lea\n\nStrange Relationship (original version, from the vault)—Prince\n\nI'm Movin' On—Chyvonne Scott\n\nLoving You Is Sweeter Than Ever—The Four Tops\n\nI Second That Emotion—Smokey Robinson and the Miracles\n\nNew York's My Home—Ray Charles\n\nYou Can't Judge a Book by the Cover—Bo Diddley\n\nI Hope You're Happy Now—Elvis Costello\n\nWild—Spoon\n\nFourth of July—Galaxie 500\n\nPour The Light In—The Reds, Pinks & Purples\n\nLawdy Miss Clawdy—Lloyd Price\n\nSing A Simple Song—Sly & The Family Stone (live, Summer of Soul, 06.29.69, Harlem, NYC)\n\nI Wanna Know If It's Good To You?—Funkadelic\n\n2 Rings Around Saturn—Steve Golub & Uggly Boy\n\nExecution—ANOHNI\n\nBurning Bridge—Kate Bush\n\nShriek—Wye Oak\n\nMoon In Your Mouth—Goldfrapp\n\nNo More 'I Love Yous'—The Lover Speaks\n\nGoing To A Town—George Michael (live, c. 2011)\n\nToo Pieces—Yaz\n\nTrain Song (Vashti Bunyan Cover)—Bon Iver feat.

The mere prospects of warmer weather facilitating outdoor gathering and light lingering longer into the evenings lifts the spirits of many people, myself included—even as we have zigged and zagged daily these last weeks between winter and thaw, with temperatures fluctuating by 40 degrees in 12–18 hours, sometimes with snow making a cameo.\n\nOne of the reassuring aspects of seasonal change is that even when it’s volatile and erratic, the signs are visible.\n\nBeing alive itself may be change. However, anyone who has tried to make conscious, intentional change inside of themselves knows that even a seemingly slight shift can take tremendous, mindful, repeated effort.\n\nLikewise, the markers of those shifts are often more difficult to parse out along the way than seasonal changes. For much of the journey, what turns out to be significant recalibration looks like and sometimes feels like nothing is in motion at all. Sometimes, change while we’re in the midst of it looks and feels like wheel-spinning, a trajectory along a perfect circle, revisiting its own elliptical arcs in infinite repetition. Along with that murkiness, distinguishing between our agency in shaping changing elements of our lives and what remains more constant for us is an inexact calculation. As I get older, I just know staying mindful to whatever comes requires meditative patience, discipline, intentionality, and a willingness to embrace uncertainty more than anything else.\n\nFor this reason I find it helpful to remind myself that things that don’t show any signs of movement are often moving—pushing forward into a new doorway or chapter that will reveal itself to us in its own time. I believe this is what my partner’s former therapist meant by his response, years ago now, when Jen observed during a session, “I think I’ve turned a small corner…” I imagine a small smile playing on his lips as he nodded in recognition and offered this gentle reply: “They’re all small corners.”\n\nSmall Corners\n\nCreated Feb. 23, 2022–Mar. 7, 2022; posted Mar. 20, 2022\n\nBring It To Jerome—Bo Diddley & J.

The eight-month #CurrentMix hiatus was the result of a personal tech fiasco of 2021—the death of an external drive that stored all the digital music I’ve gathered over 16 years. You read that correctly. I’ll spare everyone the pedestrian details; the lesson of that experience is “back all your shit up, always,” both analog and digital formats. Ironically, I was in the process of doing that when the drive went kaput.\n\nI spent a not-very-exciting six months seeing if various tech geniuses could bring the drive back from the dead, but it was unsalvageable—and it won’t even make a decent coffee coaster or a planter.\n\nI was frustrated by the loss, to be sure, but not as much as I might have imagined. Whether that calmness is some small middle-aged wisdom or it’s two years of pandemic life casting various life difficulties in a new perspective, who can say. What I do know: Amidst the other, far more dangerous threats that have come my way, this musical library setback isn’t worthy of more than some short-lived irritation and weariness. My emotional response is proportionate rather than cranked up to Spinal Tap Volume 11.\n\nThat this new mix coincides with another covid variant and spike, testing shortages, poor communication about murky policy from public health agencies, and something that’s approaching quarantine lockdown again is happenstance and also predictable, grim as that is.\n\nAgain, facing a daunting immediate horizon line, I find sustenance in creative expression. About six of the songs on Something In The Water were tracks I had planned for a May 2021 mix; the rest all came together this past weekend at the advent of this new year. A number are covers—unexpected reinterpretations that merge new flavors with familiar delights. Unconscious though it was, it seems no accident that a fair number of songs are also live performances—full of that ephemeral magic that only happens when people’s bodies, hearts, minds, and spirits are mingling together on shared energetic power lines.\n\nPandemic time being the elastic shape shifter it is, no summary will do the actual experiences of the past eight months justice. Like everyone else moving through these mercury fast, molasses slow covid days and nights, I have lived lifetimes. Last month alone was a lifetime. The outpouring below reflects but a smattering of the mercurial actualities:\n\nI have made Zoom/email/phone friends, some of whom I have yet to meet in person but who I consider as close to my heart as the ones I have known for years. I saw my family. I even had a sleepover that was 30 years in the making, a weekend with my sister, who I never believed would be part of my day-to-day adult life.\n\nI made it through crazy storms—one with no power and no heat—without any harm to me or those I love. On a bright sunny day the morning after one of those storms, I drove on an NYC highway that was an obstacle course of cars abandoned to mass flooding.\n\nI did my first in-person BRAKING AIDS bike ride in two years; it should have spanned three days and was only one for safety reasons, but I’ll take the one day of full-body hugs with my ride family and cherish it.\n\nI took more care to bring color and light into my home for the many moments when I’m unable to go and seek out color and light elsewhere.\n\nI made plans. Was I feeling excitement or terror—and sometimes, how does one know the difference?\n\nI walked in the cold, pouring rain and got soaked through and was joyous.\n\nI paid closer attention to my body, what it needs and what it carries. I discovered and am still learning more about how far it can bend to give and receive tenderness to and from other bodies, how it balances safety with freedom, how far it stretches toward the orbital pulls of mutual attention, desire, affection, understanding, intimacy.\n\nI cried. Often.\n\nI read, wrote, and edited words and pictures and did some work toward helping stories that matter to live.\n\nI laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed.\n\nI saw art exhibits and live music for the first time in two years.\n\nI sang.\n\nI hit snags with some people I love that I have yet to resolve. I reunited with dear friends from long ago, some of whom I had believed were tugged beyond reach for good by the undertow of geography and competing life priorities and relationships. I reconciled with others I love, people with whom I thought healing, transformation, renewed affection, and new beginnings were impossible.\n\nAt night I sometimes dreamed of beloveds long dead. I woke with my face streaked with tears, not in mourning, but from elation. What joy, to commune with voices and faces whose cadences, expressions, and movements my waking self fears I’m losing grasp of through all those years, then decades of absence. In the dreams, the mutual recognition and bliss were instant and intoxicating. It’s been so long since I’ve seen you, my oldest, dearest loves.\n\nI threw rounded stones into the ocean—some imbued with my heart’s troubles and sorrows and questions and some with my joys and gratitudes—because the bodies of salt water on this earth are vast enough to hold all my emotions, whatever they may be. Walking the shorelines, I picked up other stones and glass, worn smooth and soft by those same seas, to carry with me for sustenance and courage on the journeys I have yet to complete.\n\nI searched for love and peace and found myself still wanting. I have loved and been loved fully, sustaining and sure beyond any longing I carry. I have searched mysteries inside myself and found more questions.\n\nI have danced.\n\nI walked anywhere and everywhere. Long walks, often down to the pier, have sustained me throughout this strange pandemic existence. I find myself photographing the same views again and again. Initially that choice was circumstantial. The geographical confines of our daily lives has gotten smaller. What I can say without a shred of doubt or irony is that I have found innumerable worlds and galaxies of meaning in those clouds, those ocean tides, those lit and shadowed skies. My pleasure and surprise at those changes during each hour, each day—not as trifling as I had believed—are commensurate in their infinite scope. The photos below are from the day after Christmas, which would have been my maternal grandmother’s 99th birthday.\n\nAs Rainer Maria Rilke wrote, “No feeling is final.”\n\nWhat do we do when things we’ve built and loved collapse and disappear, as though they’ve never been? What do we do when what once enabled us to survive prevents us from embracing what will give us the true sustenance we have sought all our lives? We rest, take a deep breath, let go of what’s no longer useful, and gather what we love and what we’ve learned—and we begin again.\n\nSomething In The Water*\n\nCreated early May 2021 * Dec. 31, 2021–Jan. 1, 2022; posted Jan. 2, 2022\n\n* Title is lifted from Phoebe Bridgers’ “Garden Song,” which appears early in the mix below.\n\nDown—St. Vincent\n\nBe Sweet—Japanese Breakfast\n\nUncommon Weather—The Reds, Pinks & Purples\n\nGarden Song—Phoebe Bridgers\n\nWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps (live)—Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, Prince, Steve Winwood, and Dhani Harrison\n\nShip Of Fools—Elvis Costello\n\nMrs. Bartolozzi—Kate Bush\n\nValentine—Snail Mail\n\nRipple—Jane's Addiction\n\nSend To Robin Immediately—Robyn\n\nFoot On Necks—SAULT\n\nNeed Your Love—Curtis Harding\n\nDark Squirrels—Steve Golub\n\nWhat Is Hip?—Tower Of Power\n\n(dawn)—Goose\n\nBell Bottom Blues (live)—Tedeschi Trucks Band\n\nThe Melting Of the Sun—St. Vincent\n\nDis Generation—A Tribe Called Quest\n\nWhen I Hit The Floor—Lorne Behrman\n\nStrong Feelings—Dry Cleaning\n\nHit It and Quit It—Funkadelic\n\nWorking For The Knife—Mitski\n\nPretty Girls—Jennifer O'Connor\n\nIntrovert—Little Simz\n\nPromises, Movement 3—Floating Points, Pharoah Sanders & The London Symphony Orchestra\n\nPromises, Movement 4—Floating Points, Pharoah Sanders & The London Symphony Orchestra\n\nPromises, Movement 5—Floating Points, Pharoah Sanders & The London Symphony Orchestra\n\nFellowship (feat.

My concentration levels were so poor, my ability to read for pleasure disappeared for the first time in my life.\n\nWhat did reach me through all that darkness was music. The mixes, something I once did for individual friends and family but rarely for any collective audience, were initially a gift to my own emotional and mental health. After beginning the first one, I quickly realized that if the songs could offer even one other person I knew a similar grounding, they were worth sharing. So I dove into the world of online audio players and WordPress blog geekery and here we are.\n\nOne year and 25 mixes and counting later, the world and our country are still grappling with pretty grim and terrifying problems, including this pandemic. The time in lockdown has been rife with losses of all kinds—the inability to hug and physically touch those we love, jobs and indeed entire industries, physical and emotional health, homes, economies, and deaths of people we know and care about. Lots of death. More than a dozen people I know lost parents this past year, and that includes me and my siblings after the death of our father in mid-November. When I try to wrap my mind around all we have needed to do and to sacrifice in order to stay safe and protected, the gravity of the experience is indescribable and immeasurable.\n\nThat some of the worst collective suffering could have been avoided but for a band of amoral thugs running our government infrastructure into the ground these past four years has filled me with such fire, at times I felt that I might burn up from white-hot rage, my body, mind, and heart overtaken by fury and fight and indignation and burnt down to charred nothing. Sometimes I worry that the years of habitual fight—the familiarity and constancy of always having a sword at the ready, in my hand or on my back—have become an ingrained narrative and way of being. I worry that should true and righteous justice and revolution someday arrive and take hold, if such a thing is even possible, I’m not sure I would know how to let the resulting peace fully into myself. To do that, one needs to learn how and when to put the damn sword down.\n\nThe year has been a stark lesson in taking the longer view of pursuits for justice and a more compassionate world as multi-generational lifetime quests, and making time to nourish other quiet, meditative, and restorative parts of self. Partly that’s in service to sustainability, so I can show up again to fight when that’s necessary—tomorrow, and next year, and the year after that. It’s also in service to a more expansive self, so I can nurture something in myself other than being a warrior poised for battle all the time. I don’t mind life requiring some fight. God knows it’s how I was raised to approach things. But a world full of warriors always braced for the next fight is not the future I want. It’s not how I want to live or who I want to be in the world. Even those who fight well, fight hard, and stay the course for the long haul need some spaces of stillness and love and silence. Even warriors need to know how to be at peace.\n\nAnother ongoing lesson from the year has been about cultivating radical hope even amidst a wide field of ravaging battles. At the same time that the year revealed some of the most menacing and repugnant behavior that humanity can offer up, so much has also changed, and some catastrophic disasters, gravitational pulls from which I feared we would never, ever extract ourselves, were averted. I have no illusions about how damaged and deeply flawed and unjust our American systems are and remain, and how much hate and violence and bloodshed are embedded deep in the nation’s very soil and have seeped into the groundwater over centuries. The scale of how much work needs to be done to repair and heal what’s fragmented is daunting. And yet we’ve finally retreated, at least a step or two, away from some of the worst of what and who we are. What a relief to have a president and vice president who aren’t unstable narcissist bully murderers, apoplectic with their own greed and hate. What a relief for public health measures to slowly begin to prevail and for mass vaccination to offer us some greater mobility and human connection after months upon months of deprivation. Above all, I’ve also seen tremendous acts of beauty and generosity and compassion and love every day this past year. The pockets of joy, freedom, love, connection, relief, shared mourning, comfort, passion, and laughter have been every bit as incalculable in their abundance and in where they came from as the sorrows and sufferings.\n\nWe were built to try to first survive and then rebuild and thrive. We were built for small, extraordinary joys that reveal themselves to us, often, in quiet, ordinary forms. As I get older I find that my ability to shift from bare-minimum survival to what feels more like a full embrace of living depends on widening the capacity to remain open to delight and pleasure and hope and growth inside the self—even amidst swirls of impenetrable fog, gusts that howl, and volcanic terrors and shadows that amass outside us and sometimes find their way inside us. A few weeks ago, joy overtook me and radiated from me while I was walking through a rainstorm. The rain wasn’t erasing my disappointments or sorrows, as lovely as that fantasy is. The beauty of the moment was in my awareness that I could hold everything I felt, in all its extraordinary contradictions and multitudes, including the heavier emotions that hurt, and still feel surprise and hope and joy and even a measure of peace. Life is not “or,” it’s “and.” A friend described the sensation this way: Joy broke me open. And I fell in love with the world. The two April mixes below reflect that expansiveness of feeling.\n\nSometimes It Takes Darkness*\n\nCreated April 1–9, 2021; posted April 25, 2021\n\n* Title is lifted from the poem “Sweet Darkness” by David Whyte (from The House of Belonging, 1997).\n\nAll I knew about Sometimes It Takes Darkness when I began putting it together was that it would be full of electric guitars, of sounds that thrum with a defiant and fierce joy, or at least of its dogged pursuit through caverns of hardened rock and darkness. I wanted listening to it to feel molten and moving, with the same feverish rush imbued in these lyrics to Mitski’s “Pink in the Night,” which is the second to last track: “I hear my heart breaking tonight/ Do you hear it too? /It’s like a summer shower/ With every drop of rain singing/ ‘I love you, I love you, I love you/ I love you, I love you, I love you/ I love you, I love you, I love you!’ “\n\nWe Could Be Happy—SixNationState\n\nGet Off—Dandy Warhols\n\nMakes No Sense At All—Hüsker Dü\n\nJesus of Suburbia: i.

I’ve dropped the punctuation Phillips uses in his verse lines: “What will I do now, with my hands?”\n\nThe somewhat more recent counterpart to Sometimes It Takes Darkness, What Will I Do Now With My Hands is about walking through the garden of the self in early springtime, after a long, hardened winter. I am not where or who I was a year ago, and neither are you. This is the moment of trying to discover our selves again after many months of keeping our heads and hearts locked down in protection or exhaustion. What parts have succumbed to the harsh elements and how shall we mourn those losses? What new growth has taken root and re-emerged in place of what’s gone? And what mysterious blooms have, to our amazement, returned again another year?\n\nCrazy—Northern Portrait\n\nCrash—The Primitives\n\nYer So Bad—Tom Petty\n\nI'm A King Bee—Slim Harpo\n\nRocks Off—The Rolling Stones\n\nRock And Roll Baby—Mercy Baby\n\nMoney Won't Change You—Aretha Franklin\n\nBlame It On the Boogie—The Jacksons\n\nThe Breaks—Kurtis Blow\n\nGammal Sång—Veronica Maggio\n\nWe Can Work It Out—The Beatles\n\nThe End of the World Is Bigger Than Love—Jens Lekman\n\nMambo Sun—T.Rex\n\nSenses Working Overtime—XTC\n\nCa Plane Pour Moi—Plastic Bertrand\n\nInstaglo—The Invisible Cities\n\nWrecking Ball —Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band (Live at Giants Stadium, E.

The studio version of “America” on the album Bookends (1968); the live version included here is from The Concert in Central Park (1982 release, recorded at the live concert on September 19, 1981).\n\n† It’s funny which songs keep having recurrent, shifting resonance at different stages in life. I’ve been listening to Simon & Garfunkel and Paul Simon on his own all my life. I’ve seen “America” performed live twice, though neither occasion was the 1981 NYC Central Park performance. This is the second time I’ve made a mix that lifted its title from that song’s lyrics. In Dec. 2005, a year into George W. Bush’s second term, I made a two-part winter mix, perhaps among the last I made on cassette tapes. Vol. I/Cassette 1 was called Tell Me This Is The Future; Vol. II/Cassette 2 was called Michigan Seems Like A Dream To Me Now, a title that had literal as well as figurative meaning for me, referencing the two years I lived in Ann Arbor from 1998 to 2000 while I was getting my MFA in creative writing. When I made those cassette mixes over 15 years ago, we weren’t at the end of the long, dark tunnel as a nation; we were smack in the middle of Dubya’s two endless terms. In retrospect, those grim eight years seem like a cakewalk compared to what’s transpired these past four to five years, even as that period clearly played a precursor role in paving the way for the more recent, accelerating erosion of democratic values and institutions that we’ve been witnessing and living through.\n\nIn Dec. 2005, I was newly 33. My now wife was my girlfriend/partner of seven years, I hadn’t ever clocked 100 consecutive miles on a bicycle much less 300 over three days, and a shocking number of the people who I love as integral parts of my life and my heart today were individuals I had either recently encountered or not yet met. I had not yet worked in the non-profit field and probably thought I’d spend the rest of my working days making my living in book publishing. I did not believe I’d see marriage equality at the federal level in my lifetime, and I believed, or hoped, that the Bush presidency was as low, dismal, and frightening as the bar for American politics, policy, and power could get. The prospect of an Obama presidency was not even a dot on the horizon; for most of us outside of Illinois or D.C. Beltway politics, the future president was that impressive young senator who had knocked it out of the park with a great speech at the 2004 DNC, and not much more.\n\nMade 15 years apart, Michigan Seems Like A Dream To Me Now and Our Fortunes Together only share two songs, the one from which they derive their titles, and “Idioteque” by Radiohead, an accidental overlap I only became aware of when I dug up the cassette case for the former about 10 minutes ago. The two collections may share some overarching, lifelong themes, but the shapes, hues, and colors used to render those narrative and emotional arcs are markedly different, as different as the laundry list of details that comprise my life, my heart, my body, my spirit, my mind, and my views about the world and its meaning at 48.\n\nAs for the rest? The Magic 8-Ball, a monthly horoscope, Jan the Psychic, or a set of tarot cards can try to tell us our fortunes, or urge us to narrate them to ourselves in both wishes and what-if nightmares, but more often than not, the oracles cannot predict the future now. The reply is hazy. Sometimes for worse, but more often for better, most of my own predictions about what’s to come have been wrong, not because my interpretation of what I saw was wildly off, but because what I could see from my vantage point was a limited view, my perceptions based on a mere sliver of much larger systems and cosmic forces at work. I for one am trying, as I get older, to embrace the beauty and mystery inherent in that chaos and surprise. Along the way, I am working hard to not let my fear of all that is unknown stop me from pursuing what I want and believe and loving what I love. Whatever disappointments have colored my path along the way thus far and whatever heavy disconsolations I have carried in their wake, my heart has expanded and swelled from experiences of being seen, understood, and loved beyond all expectation, in ways and from sources I never dared to imagine. I have seen, understood, and loved others beyond all imagination, in ways I could not have envisioned—in many cases with luminous people I never expected would move close enough to me to fall into my orbit much less my heart. The only real constant is change, which, from our view at ground level, seems to take place with excruciating slowness and at light speed all at once.\n\nOh, what the years can bring. When the chasm of uncertainty about the future frustrates me, which it often does, I try to focus on my gratitude for the joys, large and small, that I experience all the time in my day-to-day life, even on my worst days. I try to keep my attention on who I am, who I want to be, and how I want to show up in the world, whether it’s sleeting and stormy and I’m choking to take a breath or it’s breezy and warm with the smells of grass, sea, soil, and sand washing over me, and on who and what bring me meaning and joy and matter most to me. As the wise, talking dog in my friend Charlie’s latest, wonderful novel The Sun Collective says, in an attempt to reassure one of the novel’s fretting, anxious human characters: “Love and loyalty. What else is there?” Indeed. “Let us be lovers, We’ll marry our fortunes together.”\n\nHoney—Robyn\n\nRide A White Horse—Goldfrapp\n\nBurn You Up—Thao with the Get Down Stay Down\n\nLet's Go, Lets Go, Let's Go—Bettye LaVette\n\nAin't Wastin Time No More—The Allman Brothers\n\nHeart of Gold—Charles Bradley\n\nLiving Proof—Cat Power\n\nDarling Be Home Soon—Tedeschi Trucks Band (live, Oct. 4, 2019, NYC)\n\nMake the Music Go Bang—X\n\nPrivate Idaho—The B-52's\n\nLove You Back—Metric\n\nBack Up Plan—Big Boi\n\nSituation—Yaz\n\nIdioteque—Radiohead\n\nKing Kunta—Kendrick Lamar\n\nPut The Blame On Me—Eurythmics\n\nBlk Girl Soldier—Jamila Woods\n\nFreak Like Me —Caroline Rose\n\nCool Yourself—Thao with the Get Down Stay Down\n\nOh!

Two related points about the band for folks who aren’t familiar with them:\n\n1) Brian Eno later said that while The Velvet Underground only sold 30,000 records during the six years they were together—and they only released four albums—everyone who bought those records at the time started a band. Eno is right. Whether The Velvets are your jam or not, they influenced a band or musician you love. And in most cases, including my own, many bands and musicians you love.\n\n2) The Velvets are worth a listen for the miracle of their displacement in time alone. I’ve been an ardent fan since the mid-1980s and even I still forget this because their sound doesn’t make any logical sense in sequential musical history. Upon first or even 500th listen, they sound like a band straight out of the 1970s. Early punk and art-house garage rock. Gritty. Generous with feedback. So what, you say? An arthouse crowd version of The Clash? Big deal. Here’s the kicker. The Velvet Underground made those sounds between 1964 and 1970. Years ahead of all the bands they sound like. The first studio album, The Velvet Underground & Nico, as famous for its Andy Warhol banana cover as for its contents, was released in 1967. The same year Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band was released. The same year that The Zombies recorded their brilliant 1968 release, Odessy and Oracle, which I mention because The Zombies were underrated as well and because several Zombies songs appear in this month’s mixes, too. I listen to these fantastic songs—and try to make sense of the fact that The Velvet Underground were contemporaries of all the huge 1960s bands. The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, The Doors, The Zombies, Jefferson Airplane, The Beach Boys. Even Pink Floyd makes more sonic sense in the late 1960s than The Velvets do. Where did The Velvets come from and who sent them to us? Punk music arriving at the height of hippie, flower power psychedelia, like a massive comet hurtling at us from outer space.\n\nSan Jacinto [2011]—Peter Gabriel\n\nDrew—Goldfrapp\n\nA Rose for Emily [with cello & flute]—The Zombies\n\nTiny Dancer—Ben Folds (live, July 2002)\n\nGeorgia To Texas—Leon Bridges\n\nSULA (Hardcover)—Jamila Woods\n\nIt Don't Come Easy—Bettye LaVette\n\nBaby, You're Right—James Brown\n\nTry A Little Tenderness—Otis Redding (live)\n\nCome Take Me—Betty Davis\n\nVoices Inside (Everything Is Everything)—Donny Hathaway (live)\n\nI Take What I Want—Sam & Dave\n\nWatershed—Indigo Girls\n\nDelia—Blind Willie McTell\n\nSome Kinda Love—Lou Reed & The Velvet Underground (live)\n\nI'll Call You Mine [mono mix]—The Zombies\n\nSleeping—The Band\n\nThe King Of Carrot Flowers Part 1—Neutral Milk Hotel\n\nSixties—The Essex Green\n\nCross Bones Style—Cat Power\n\nLove Out Of Lust—Lykke Li\n\nzombie girl—Adrianne Lenker\n\nI'm From Nowhere—Neko Case\n\nChanges—The Zombies\n\nAndalucia—Andrew Bird\n\nRagtime—Neko Case\n\nFictional Road Trips With You\n\nAn Imaginary Painting for a New, Better Year\n\nCreated December 18–29, 2020 & posted December 29, 2020\n\nTake Me With U—Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings\n\nFriday On My Mind—Easybeats\n\nSecret of The Sea—Billy Bragg & Wilco\n\nStylo—Gorillaz feat.

I wonder if I shall ever catch up.\n\nI think of the shining cheeks, the serious palettes\n\nOf my friends, and I am sure I am not of their company.\n\nThere was a time when I touched by the pallor of truth,\n\nWhen the fatal steps I took seemed more like the drift\n\nOf summer crossed at times by the scented music of rain,\n\nBut that was before I was waved to the side\n\nBy the officer on duty, and told that henceforth\n\nI would have to invent my pleasure, carve it out of the air,\n\nSubtract it from my future. And I could have no illusions;\n\nA mysterious crape would cover my work. The roll of a drum\n\nWould govern the fall of my feet in the long corridors.\n\n“And listen,” the officer said, “on any morning look down\n\nInto the valley. Watch the shadows, the clouds dispersing\n\nThen look through the ice into nature’s frozen museum,\n\nSee how perfectly everything fits in its space.”\n\nIII\n\nI have just said good-bye to a friend\n\nAnd am staring at fields of cornstalks.\n\nTheir stubble is being burned, and the smoke\n\nForms a gauze over the sun’s blank face.\n\nOff to the side there is a line of poplars.\n\nAnd beyond, someone is driving a tractor.\n\nDoes he live in that little white house?\n\nSomeone is playing a tape of birds singing.\n\nSomeone has fallen asleep on a boxcar of turnips.\n\nI think of the seasonal possibilities.\n\nO pretty densities of white on white!\n\nO snowflake lost in the vestibules of April air!\n\nBeyond the sadness—the empty restaurants,\n\nThe empty streets, the small lamps shining\n\nDown on the town—I see only the stretches\n\nOf ice and snow, the straight pines, the frigid moon.\n\nIV\n\n“I would like to step out of my heart’s door and be\n\nUnder the great sky.” I would like to step out\n\nAnd be on the other side, and be part of all\n\nThat surrounds me. I would like to be\n\nIn that solitude of soundless things, in the random\n\nCompany of the wind, to be weightless, nameless.\n\nBut not for long, for I would be downcast without\n\nThe things I keep inside my heart; and in no time\n\nI would be back. Ah! the old heart\n\nIn which I sleep, in which my sleep increases, in which\n\nMy grief is ponderous, in which the leaves are falling,\n\nIn which the streets are long, in which the night\n\nIs dark, in which the sky is great, the old heart\n\nThat murmurs to me of what cannot go on,\n\nOf the dancing, of the inmost dancing.\n\nV\n\nI go out and sit on my roof, hoping\n\nThat a creature from another planet will see me\n\nAnd say, “There’s life on earth, definitely life;\n\n“See that earthling on top of his home,\n\nHis manifold possessions under him,\n\nLet’s name him after our planet.” Whoa!\n\nThe Inmost Dancing, Vol. 2*\n\nCreated November 1–12, 2020 & posted November 25, 2020\n\n* The mix title was lifted from Section IV of Mark Strand’s 1992 poem “After Our Planet,” which appears in its entirety above.\n\nNow That I'm Gone—Charles Bradley & The Bullets\n\nLoveStoned / I Think She Knows Interlude—Justin Timberlake\n\nShe Got Me (When She Got Her Dress On)—Masters Of Reality\n\nGrounds For Divorce (acoustic)—Elbow (live)\n\nThis Tornado Loves You—Neko Case\n\nComputer Blue—Prince\n\nAnti Love Song—Betty Davis\n\nFour—No Joy\n\nI'd Rather Be High—David Bowie\n\nI Don't Blame You—Cat Power\n\nCold Pieces 5—Erik Satie\n\nThe Blackest Crow—Fayssoux\n\nThe Heart Of Saturday Night—Tom Waits\n\nGeorgia on my Mind—Willie Nelson and Ray Charles (live)\n\nHung Up on a Dream—Zombies\n\nMy Sweet Lord—George Harrison\n\nJudy and the Dream of Horses—Belle and Sebastian\n\nDon't Ever Leave Me—Connie Francis\n\nGood Morning Little Schoolgirl—Muddy Waters\n\nSweet Virginia—Jerry Lee Lewis (with Keith Richards)\n\nHear Me—Tedeschi Trucks Band\n\nHuman Touch—Elvis Costello & The Attractions\n\nParade of Punk Rock T-Shirts—Maritime\n\nLookin' For A Love—The Valentinos\n\nLet The Four Winds Blow—Fats Domino\n\nDarling Nikki—Foo Fighters\n\nYou Gotta Feel It—Kevin Drew\n\nApril Skies—The Jesus and Mary Chain\n\nRoll On—Dntel (feat.
