        "text": "ONE\n\n\"Live from Hollywood! The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson, the twenty-fifth anniversary. This is Ed McMahon, along with Doc Severinsen and the NBC orchestra, inviting you to join Johnny as we celebrate twenty-five years of late-night entertainment…. And now, ladies and gentlemen, HEEEEERE’S JOHNNY!\"\n\nJohnny Carson stepped from behind the multicolored curtain wearing a tuxedo. The five hundred guests rose from their seats in Studio 1. They clapped, screamed, whistled, and hooted exuberantly. Johnny walked forward to a star marked on the studio floor. Carl Doc Severinsen salaamed, twirling his hand downward from his forehead. McMahon paid homage too, pressing his hands together and bowing as if to a royal personage.\n\nThe camera panned across the audience, capturing snapshots of middle America. A family from Louisiana. A couple from Pennsylvania. A retired man from New Jersey. Two sisters from Seattle. Most of the audience had come to southern California on vacations. They had made this pilgrimage to The Tonight Show as important a part of their itineraries as Disneyland or the Universal Studio tour.\n\nThis morning, October 1, 1987, close to a hundred of the guests had been standing in line at the NBC studios in Burbank waiting for tickets when a major earthquake hit Los Angeles. Even that didn’t dislodge them. Then this afternoon they had stood in the heat of the San Fernando Valley for two hours or more before ushers let them into this cool sanctuary.\n\nThe applause didn’t end, but rose from crescendo to crescendo. No one else in show business or public life received such a nightly homage. In an age of disposable celebrities Johnny had come into American homes over five thousand times. He had been seen by more people on more occasions than anyone in American history. He had become a fixture of American life, a part of the cultural furniture. This evening alone, over 21 million people were watching the show.\n\nJohnny exuded boyish impishness, but his face was as weathered as an old Nebraska barn. He smiled warmly, but his posture sent out a far different message. He stood as if he had been jolted backward and had been frozen there, forever pulling away from anyone who got near to him.\n\nAt the age of sixty-one, Johnny was the ultimate creature of television. He had begun his career in Omaha in 1949, the first summer that television went on the air in Nebraska. He had worked in Los Angeles and New York as the networks had grown into the most powerful communications medium ever known. Now, the networks had begun to decline, viewers lost to cable networks and videotape recorders. It was unlikely that any other performer would ever have the same hold over the American night.\n\nJohnny finally raised his hands and gently motioned for quiet. That is very sweet of you, he said. Did you intentionally stand, or were you thrown out of your seats?\n\nJohnny’s monologue had a rhythm to it that was like a favorite song whose chords brought forth memories of good times. The audience sometimes laughed at the mere sound of his voice.\n\nOral Roberts felt the quake this morning, Johnny said. That wasn’t the punch line, but it was enough to set the audience laughing. Roberts had said that if his flock didn’t contribute $4.5 million, God could call him home, presumably a reference to heaven. For months Johnny had been satirizing the faith-healing evangelist. His jokes had helped to make Roberts a figure of widespread derision. Now the mere mention of his name was a joke. Oral turned to his wife in bed and said, ‘Oh, honey, the check must have bounced….’\n\nJohnny moved on, line after line, hardly waiting for the laughter to die down. People are not used to seeing me in prime time, he said, gesturing with his hands. Imagine President Reagan tuning in now and saying to Nancy, ‘Well it’s eleven-thirty, I should have been asleep two hours ago.’\n\nIn Washington Johnny’s nightly political jibes were repeated the next morning all over the capital. If he joked about a politician regularly, it was as ominous a sign as finding a dead fish on your doorstep in Sicily.\n\nJohnny created the illusion of daring. He was, in fact, a comedic politician, attuned to his viewers, leading them wherever they wanted to go. He had unchallenged power as long as he did not attempt to use it. Nightly he listened to the laughs and the groans from the live audience. They told him what was funny and what wasn’t, who could be laughed at and who couldn’t be.\n\nIn America ideas and values changed as quickly as hemlines and hairdos. Believe anything too deeply, strike too rich a characterization, and one was doomed to become passé. Johnny changed his jokes as he changed his wardrobe, never as hip as L.A., never as traditional as Omaha.\n\nJohnny’s monologues were part of the Zeitgeist. One day social historians will turn to his quips and commentaries in trying to understand popular American culture in the last third of the twentieth century.\n\nWould you have believed twenty-five years ago that now, today, in ‘87, we’d be seeing condom ads on television? Johnny said, turning to another favorite arena of humor. Now the next time you hear Ed say, ‘On your way home pick up a six-pack,’ he may not be referring to Budweiser.\n\nIn the show’s early years Johnny had peppered the program with sexual banter and innuendo rarely heard on television. He was the comedic equivalent of the birth-control pill, helping to popularize America’s sexual revolution. There are no revolutions without casualties; Johnny had made divorce a laughing matter, focusing on his own three ex-wives.\n\nThank you for being with us, Johnny said as the NBC orchestra cut into The Tonight Show theme and Ed announced the sponsors. The red light went off, and the first barrage of commercials played silently on the monitors.\n\nJohnny stood alone facing the studio audience. For an instant this was no longer Johnny Carson, television star, but a man standing there, and the audience squirmed uneasily. Usually someone shouted out a greeting. Johnny always said a few words.\n\n\"Thank you, you’re going to make this a pleasure,\" Johnny said, setting off another round of applause. Where were you all this morning about seven-forty-two? he asked, referring to the time of the earthquake. A score of people shouted out the same answer: waiting for tickets for the show.\n\n\"I felt so calm because of this guy at Channel Four,\" Johnny said, shaking his head. Kent Shocknek, the morning anchorman, had distinguished himself by ducking under the desk during one of the aftershocks. He dived under the desk and came up d-d-d-d-don’t … don’t … don’t, Johnny stuttered. Then he mentioned a female reporter on the local station. I think the most frightening thing was seeing Linda Alvarez without her makeup.\n\nJohnny walked over and sat down at his desk next to Ed McMahon. For a program that brought in up to 17 percent of NBC’s entire profits, The Tonight Show had a set that was surprisingly modest. The painted backdrop was of a gray stone fence and a Leroy Neiman-like blue sky, speckled with flashes of yellow. In front sat a jungle of potted palms and plants.\n\nJohnny’s desk looked as if it could have come from the office of a junior accountant, the chairs from rent-a-furniture. But on television they looked classy.\n\nThe two men sat quietly waiting for the light over the camera to come on again. Johnny usually began the show chatting with Ed before doing one comedy bit or another. This evening was different. Television is full of hoked-up celebrations, celebrity roasts, and award shows, but a quarter-century of dominating late-night television was an achievement worth noting.\n\nWe have spent a lot of these evenings together, Johnny said to the sixty-four-year old announcer. Johnny hated the typical show-biz talk show where performers who hardly knew one another affected an instant intimacy, according hugs and accolades and words of perfumed adulation to mere acquaintances. Ed had been Johnny’s announcer for twenty-nine years, his foil and shield, his claque, his laughter punctuating the night. I cannot imagine doing this show without you. You have been an absolute rock all these years.\n\nJohnny could have made this anniversary show a compilation of his greatest moments. But when others looked good, he looked better. So this evening began not with excerpts from Johnny’s performances, but with a series of clips from some of the great American comics who had appeared on The Tonight Show over the years. As routines with Groucho Marx, Red Skelton, Jack Benny, George Burns, and Bob Hope played on the monitor, Johnny lit a cigarette and sat back. He laughed and laughed. Then, when he showed himself in 1964 singing Our Love Is Here to Stay off-key with an exuberant Pearl Bailey, he half collapsed with glee. It was not like a politician admiring himself on television, but like a man watching another person.\n\nThe Tonight Show was the great hub of the entertainment industry. No matter where performers were going, they almost always stopped to sing a song, tell a tale, play a number or two. Johnny introduced a series of clips. Judy Garland. Liza Minnelli Diana Ross. Itzhak Perlman. Luciano Pavarotti. Benny Goodman. Buddy Rich. Louis Armstrong. Johnny could have chosen a hundred others as well.\n\nNot only entertainers appeared on the show. The Tonight Show had revealed to politicians the value of playing themselves in a few minutes of calculated casualness. Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, and Martin Luther King, Jr., all lightly bantered with Johnny.\n\nIn Hollywood the stars of films exist in a higher firmament than do mere television stars. Johnny was the exception. Wherever he traveled to parties and gatherings among the Hollywood elite, he received a recognition and deference as great as any movie star. He belonged as the host of the Academy Awards. He was a success beyond success. He had lived half a dozen lifetimes on television. More money, more talent, and more energy had been spent trying to defeat him than any other performer in history. Dick Cavett. Joey Bishop. Merv Griffin. Alan Thicke. David Brenner. Joan Rivers. They had come in droves, and he had turned them all back.\n\nThe staff and NBC personnel usually watched the taping of the program with only modest interest. This evening, however, they stood backstage mesmerized in front of the monitors, as if even they were having a new vision of the program.\n\nMost comedians considered their first appearance on The Tonight Show as a professional coming-of-age. Johnny could have shown clips from most of the major new comics of the last quarter-century. He cut the number down to five. Johnny’s guest hosts, Jay Leno and Garry Shandling, were automatics. So was David Letterman, since Carson Productions owned his program. That left room only for clips from Eddie Murphy and Steve Martin.\n\nThen Johnny played some of his own routines, and he was as funny as any of the other comedians. He was brilliant when all was not right with his world, when talking birds wouldn’t talk, a pie in the face ended up as a pie on the forehead or the chest, an animal relieved itself on his arm.\n\nThese anniversary shows had become an annual ritual each October. Usually little or no time was spent reliving moments with politicians or classical musicians or jazz greats, and the humor had a heavy diet of pie-throwing and slapstick. This evening, however, was an encyclopedia of American popular culture for the past quarter-century. It was not simply a bunch of clips, the best of Carson. It was an homage to an extraordinary achievement.\n\nIt has been a fabulous journey for me personally, Johnny said as the hour and a half drew to a close. And without sounding mawkish, about a year ago I was going to hang it up on the twenty-fifth year of this show. I don’t know why. Maybe twenty-five years is enough. And I found out I was having so much fun doing the show that we decided to stick around for a while. So if you stick around for a while, we’ll stick around for a while to do the show for you.\n\nWhen the applause subsided, Johnny ended the program with Fred Astaire singing Life Is Beautiful, a song whose music Astaire himself had composed. The Tonight Show staff could have looked through every foot of video in the vaults and not found a more stylish way to end the twenty-fifth-anniversary show. Astaire personified a peculiarly American kind of class.\n\nThe show was over, but every year Johnny gave an anniversary party for the staff and production company. He usually held it at the Beverly Hills Hotel, a pink stucco palace on Sunset Boulevard where as many deals as affairs are consummated. This year Johnny’s nephew, Jeff Sotzing, The Tonight Show’s associate producer, suggested holding the party on the Queen Mary. The giant British liner had come to its final resting place as a tourist attraction in the industrial port of Long Beach, thirty-six miles from Bur-bank. Johnny liked the idea, and the night after the anniversary show the party was held far from the Polo Lounge.\n\nIn Hollywood, wealth has been democratized, and many of the three hundred employees arrived in rented limousines. When they got out, a young lady in a tuxedo greeted them and took their pictures as if they were stars themselves. Then they walked along a red carpet, lined by velvet cords, and up a narrow escalator.\n\nJohnny’s company had taken over the entire second deck of the former Cunard liner, and had hired a security force worthy of a president. Plain-clothes and uniformed agents stood alert at the elevator, the escalator, the stairs leading up to the Queen Mary Hotel. Over the years Johnny had received death threats, but the security force was equally alert to attempts by journalists and other outsiders to crash the party.\n\nMagazine editors were ready to put Johnny on the cover of their publications for the twenty-fifth anniversary. Television producers prepared to interview him for their networks. Newspaper editors offered major profiles in Sunday papers. Almost no one in Hollywood would have turned down such publicity, but Johnny did not give a single interview.\n\nJohnny hated public affairs, even when he knew most of the people. But he played a worthy host, arriving before his guests. He staked out a corner of the bar beside his new wife, Alexis Mass, and did his best with the aimless chitchat.\n\nWhen the camera is off, Johnny seems diminished, washed out. He looks like the tenth copy of a videocassette. He is five-feet-ten-and-a-half-inches tall, but if it is possible to be a short five feet ten and a half, he is it. He is thin, almost scrawny, at 170 pounds, with the muscular physique of an athlete fifteen years his junior, yet his face and hazel eyes show every one of his years. His most unusual feature is his elegant long hands, a surgeon’s or a pianist’s hands.\n\nAlexis Mass was the Cinderella bride of the moment. Thirty-seven-year-old Alex had been detailed like a Beverly Hills Porsche, polished and glazed from the bottom of her designer shoes to the tip of her long, frosted hair. She appeared the beautiful young woman on Johnny’s arm, but underneath the relentless glamorizing was the fresh-faced, healthy look more common to the slopes and bars of Aspen than to the salons of Bel Air and Beverly Hills.\n\nJohnny had a drink or two. Then he and Alex and the guests walked into the Grand Salon for dinner. When the Queen Mary sailed between New York City and Southampton, the three-deck-high, 143-feet-long salon was the first-class dining room. It is an exquisite room, the largest ever built on a ship, paneled with golden-brown Peroba and Maple Burr.\n\nIn the center was a large dance floor and a band that played the up-tempo jazz that is Johnny’s favorite music. Set throughout the room were round tables for ten. Each table had a large floral centerpiece, linen napkins in the water glasses, and a gift for each guest, a German clock embossed HAPPY 25TH ANNIVERSARY THE TONIGHT SHOW.\n\nExcept for Johnny’s table, the dinner places were not reserved. The Carson production and NBC employees found their levels. The prop men sat with their kind. The musicians sat with the musicians.\n\nJohnny and Alex took their places. Behind them stood an immense map of the Atlantic Ocean that hung halfway down the room. To their left sat Ed McMahon and his young wife, Victoria. To their right sat Fred Freddy de Cordova, the Tonight Show’s executive producer, and his wife, Janet; they had been on the Queen Mary on its final journey to Long Beach in 1967. Doc Severinsen, the band leader, sat with his wife, Emily. Johnny’s lawyer and closest friend, Henry Bushkin, was at a nearby table with his then-current love, Mary Hart, the co-anchor of Entertainment Tonight.\n\nIn Hollywood a young wife is as necessary an accoutrement to celebrity as capped teeth. Thus, except for Janet de Cordova, these were all thirtyish ladies, a generation younger than their husbands.\n\nLooking out on the assemblage, Johnny did not see a particularly urbane gathering. Most of the guests were dressed like the crowd at the Norfolk, Nebraska, country club where Johnny’s dad used to play golf. As for Johnny, he may have had his own line of clothing and his name on the best-dressed lists, but he was wearing a blue blazer and gray bell-bottoms, a style that went out of fashion with Nehru jackets and love-ins.\n\nThis was an anniversary, after all, an occasion for reflection. At many of the tables there was an undertone of melancholy, regret. Since General Electric had taken over the network two years ago, the whole atmosphere at NBC had changed. At times the place resembled an air-conditioned sweatshop.\n\nEven as the guests ate their Cornish hen and poached salmon, other Tonight Show employees, cameramen and technicians, walked the picket line, on strike against NBC. Several men in the room planned to retire early. Whether people blamed GE, the economy, or the decline of the networks, NBC would never be the same. Future evenings like this would be rare indeed.\n\nWhen dessert was finished and the champagne was being poured, Freddy or Ed could have risen and given a toast to Johnny. But Johnny hated such things, and it was his party. So he stood up, strode quickly across the dance floor, and stood before the microphone.\n\nI want to thank you for coming, Johnny said as his champagne glass tilted dangerously to the side. If he had been the executive of a small company, he would have cursed himself and vowed to take a lesson in public speaking. A toast to twenty-five years of us.\n\nAn outsider might have thought that Johnny seemed estranged and distant. But these people with whom he worked knew that this was as openly emotional as he became.\n\nJohnny thanked the young woman who had put the evening together. Then he turned to a different subject. If you look at the back of your chairs, you’ll see at each table there’s one chair with a star on it. The person who has the chair gets to take the floral arrangement home.\n\nJohnny continued to talk, but people all over the room clambered up and started searching behind their chairs.\n\nWhen the room finally quieted down, Johnny’s thin voice barely carried across the cavernous room. We’re passing around chips for the casino, Johnny said. So you can gamble if you want, or dance to the band.\n\nJohnny made a second toast as perfunctory as the first; with that, the formal part of the evening was over. He went back and sat down next to Alex. Then he got up abruptly, and with a curt twist of his neck motioned his young bride to follow him. He moved off toward the Windsor Room. He left Alex in the casino and headed off by himself toward a room with the simple appellation Gentlemen.\n\nLike most celebrities, Johnny hated going to public rest rooms. He had insisted on a private bathroom on The Tonight Show years ago. This evening he made it to the row of five gleaming urinals before most of the other guests. Two men sidled up next to him, filling the two empty spots.\n\nIt’s a wonderful evening, Johnny said as he looked down at the white enamel.\n\nYes, it’s a wonderful evening, said the middle-aged gentleman to the left.\n\nWonderful evening, said the gentleman to the right. Simply wonderful.\n\nAs Johnny zipped back up, the gentleman on the left turned his head toward him, then looked down at the business at hand and shook his head admiringly. You sure pee faster than you used to, the man said.\n\nJohnny didn’t acknowledge the compliment. He turned and walked out of the men’s room, stiffing the attendant who stood with his brace of towels and perfumed scents.\n\nBack in the Windsor Room Alex was at one of the blackjack tables. Johnny sat down beside her. A dealer and three players were already seated at their table. No one else came to join them. No one rubbernecked, and despite subtle glances toward Johnny, the other guests maintained the illusion that he was just another player.\n\nJohnny’s youngest son, Cory, didn’t even approach his father. Nor did Rick, his middle son. Ed McMahon stood in his impeccably tailored blue suit at the edge of the room. He did not play. He wasn’t drinking. He looked as impassive as the rent-a-cops.\n\nJohnny’s guests had been given little bags full of play chips marked $500, $100, $25, $5, and $1. The big winners for the evening would be able to exchange the chips for fondue dishes and CD players.\n\nI don’t know how to play blackjack, Alex said, looking at her new husband.\n\nJohnny had played Las Vegas enough to pick up a few pointers about the game. Although he earned $20 million a year, he played for small stakes. He explained to Alex that the secret wasn’t to try to hit 21, but to make the dealer lose.\n\nNo, dear, the dealer has a small card there, Johnny said with pedagogical zeal. You got a five there. Don’t draw on a fourteen.\n\nNonetheless, Alex asked for another card, and proceeded to win the hand. Johnny continued playing conservatively, using his Las Vegas savvy. Twenty minutes later he had gone bust, losing all $2,500 in chips.\n\nJohnny didn’t sit watching Alex win hand after hand. He got up and walked over to one of the other tables. He took the cards from the dealer and began a series of card tricks.\n\nJohnny was comfortable when he performed. It was better than chitchat, better by far. He was in control. He spread the cards on the felt table, and in one motion turned them all over, and back again. Then he pulled the four queens from the deck, reinserted them, and shuffled the pack again. One by one, he pulled the queens from the deck. After appropriate oohhing and ahhing, Johnny did a second trick.\n\nNow, Snooky, I want you to pick a card, Johnny said to Snooky Young, the band’s longtime trumpet player. As Young listened, he moved his body back and forth on the stool. Remember which it was, in what order.\n\nSnooky Young was not about to screw this up. He methodically counted until he came to the fifth card. A ten of diamonds. He gave the deck back to Johnny, who shuffled it.\n\nNow what card was it? he asked the black musician.\n\nIt was the fifth, Snooky said.\n\nJohnny slapped down a three of spades. There’s your card, he said.\n\nA grimace of worry crossed Snooky’s face. No, it was a ten of diamonds.\n\nYou fucked up, Snooky, Johnny said. You fucked up.\n\nThen he turned to another young man. This time the trick worked. He did a couple more tricks, and left to a polite round of applause.\n\nAs Johnny began doing magic at the next table, the dealer whispered to the seated players, You saw how he did it. It was half a question, half a statement.\n\nYeah, of course, said one of the men. He was dealing from the bottom.\n\nYeah … the dealer said, and went on to discuss exactly how Johnny had accomplished his magic.\n\nJohnny had performed his tricks. But the guests had created the greater illusion. They had let Johnny believe that he had fooled them. Johnny went through life meeting overwhelming deference. His days were full of gentle pleasantries. People laughed at his jokes, even if they weren’t always funny. They applauded his magic tricks, even if they had them figured out.\n\nJohnny moved on to a third table, where his son Rick and his date were seated. Rick had been trouble, a lot of trouble. Booze and drugs. Drugs and booze. He was thirty-five years old, and he never had done much with his life. Johnny gave Rick work with his company. He also gave each of his three sons thirty-five thousand dollars a year. Rick’s long page-boy hair had started to turn gray. He was slightly overweight, and he had a somewhat bloated resemblance to his father. Johnny did the same tricks as at the other tables. Doc Severinsen stood watching, applauding and laughing as he did on The Tonight Show.\n\nNow, Rick, I want you to take a certain number of cards out of the deck, Johnny said. Remember how many. I’ll turn my back.\n\nThis was Rick’s moment. All his life Johnny’s second son had hungered for his father’s affection and attention. He peeled off five cards, stuffing three of them down the breast of his date, the other two down the dress of the lady to the right.\n\nJohnny turned back. Now, I’m going to lay the cards down one by one. When I come to the same number of cards that you took out, just remember that card. Don’t say anything. Just remember.\n\nWith his elegant, manicured hands Johnny began taking the cards from the top of the deck. One card. Two. Three. Four. Five.\n\nThat’s it, Rick said proudly. It was the fifth card.\n\nNo, Johnny said, mildly exasperated. You weren’t supposed to tell me, Rick. That’s the whole point.\n\nOh, sorry. Rick shrugged.\n\nWe’ll do it again, Johnny said, and turned his back to the table. You understand now. Just don’t tell me which one.\n\nThis time Rick pulled six cards from the deck, evenly dividing them between the bosoms of the two women.\n\nJohnny turned back and began to lay down the cards. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six.\n\nThat’s it! Rick exclaimed triumphantly, as if he had solved a great puzzle. That’s it! Number six.\n\nNo, Johnny said, his voice streaked with disdain. He looked at his son with a coldness that could have turned him into a block of ice. Then, without a word, Johnny whirled and left the table.\n\nSilence. Finally Rick spoke. It was really complicated, he said, his eyes scanning the other players, looking for understanding.\n\nYeah, Doc Severinsen said.\n\nJohnny joined Alex again. Then he stood and wandered around the room. He had known some of the people here for a quarter of a century or more. Yet he seemed so alone, so distant.\n\nKenneth Tynan, the late British writer, compared Johnny to F. Scott Fitzgerald’s Jay Gatsby. Tynan wrote, Gatsby, like Carson, is a Mid-westerner, a self-made millionaire, and a habitual loner, armored against all attempts to invade his emotional privacy.\n\nJohnny also bore a certain resemblance to another great figure in American literature: James Tyrone in Eugene O’Neill’s Long Day’s Journey into Night. As a brilliant young actor, Tyrone had started playing the same popular role over and over again, as Johnny had played his (That god damned play … it ruined me with its promise of an easy fortune. I didn’t want to do anything else, and by the time I woke up to the fact I’d become a slave to the damn thing….) Tyrone’s wife became a drug addict, and his sons lived in the darkness of his shadow.\n\nBut of course Johnny was not doomed, drunken James Tyrone. Nor was he Jay Gatsby. He was Johnny Carson, toast of America, king of the night.\n\nTWO\n\nJohnny Carson stood on the garage roof in a clown’s costume, looking as if he were about to cry. Johnny was supposed to be funny, but he couldn’t get his mouth and words to work together. He gnawed on his tongue and looked down on the folks spread out on the pasture behind the Brennans’ house. Mercifully he stepped back from the edge, and ended his first public performance.\n\nEvery summer the children put on a circus at Bill Brennan’s house. That was just one of the summer activities in Avoca, Iowa, during the early 1930’s. The town had only twelve hundred inhabitants, but plenty of adventure for a boy of seven or eight.\n\nJohnny and the other boys played in the cool darkness under the Carsons’ front porch. They went fishing on the banks of the East Nishnabotna River, south of the Fred Holtz Bridge, using tree branches for poles and worms for bait. One time before going fishing, Johnny borrowed a nickel from his dad to buy wieners at Blust Meat Market to roast, so it wouldn’t matter whether they caught any fish or not.\n\nEach summer the Conroy Brothers Show came to the fairgrounds, a real circus with ponies and trick mules and dogs and goats and aerial acts, and—best of all—free tickets passed out by the merchants along Main Street. The air show visited Avoca one year too, with tickets for a penny. And of course there was the Fourth of July, the biggest holiday of all, with fireworks and picnics and one year a big boxing show, with a thousand people cheering the fighters on. Then, in August, came the county fair, complete with a rodeo and a four-piece Indian band.\n\nEven if nothing else was happening at the fairgrounds, the swimming pool was there. Almost as long as a football field and far wider than one, the Avoca pool was one of the largest in Iowa. Season tickets for children were $1.25, and on those sweltering days of August, Johnny and the rest of the kids lived in the pool.\n\nJohnny was a scrawny, taciturn boy with inquisitive hazel eyes. His ears stuck out like antennae from the side of his long head. He had his father’s lanky build, his mother’s narrowly set eyes, pointed chin, and nose.\n\nJohnny’s father, Homer L. Kit Carson, was local manager of Iowa and Nebraska Light and Power. On long summer evenings Johnny would go down to the ball field and watch his dad lead the Light and Power team in the kitten softball league. In June 1932, when Johnny was seven, his dad’s team defeated Walnut 5 to 3. ’Kit’ has a ‘sneak’ ball that looks good, but is bad, noted the Avoca Herald. He keeps it about six inches above the ground, and sneaked over a strike because the umpire does not know whether it is knee high or not, and ‘Kit’ has a sneaking idea it is a strike and occasionally sneaks one over on the batter.\n\nJohnny watched his dad on the tennis court too. In the summer of 1933 Kit played Edwin Doll for the town championship. Doll had just graduated from high school, and Kit was spotting Doll about fifteen years in age. On that sweltering afternoon the smart money would have been on youthful stamina over experience. Johnny and his little brother Dick shagged balls, but only for their dad. As they scurried back and forth, young Doll chased after his own balls. Before he realized quite what had happened, Doll was walking off the court the loser, and the three Carsons were walking home triumphant.\n\nHome was a large two-story white frame house on the corner at 725 Cherry Street. Johnny’s mother, Ruth E. Carson, was a proper lady with a dramatic flair, and she ran her house as if she were the captain of a warship. She loved Johnny and his little brother, Richard, but she loved their older sister, Catherine, more. Mrs. Carson had wanted to have more daughters, and she coddled Catherine.\n\nWhen Kit and the boys returned from a softball game, Ruth might put in a few moments of what the neighbors called henpecking. She was as much the manager of this world as Kit was of Light and Power.\n\nThe father was a wonderful guy, remembers Bill Brennan, who is two years older than Johnny. He was conservative. The mother, Ruth, was more the extrovert. She was very good as a contortionist. There were parties where she would bend over and do a few tricks. It was good-natured fun. Sometimes my mother said that Kit would be fussed, mildly embarrassed at something Ruth would say. I think John’s theatrical stuff comes from the mother’s side.\n\nThe Carsons are an old American family, with roots in England and Ireland. Genealogists have traced the Carson ancestors as far back as 1521. In that year Thomas Kellogg was born in the English village of Debdon, Essex. A century later Daniel and Bridget Kellogg traveled to the American colonies and settled in Connecticut. Their offspring moved westward, drawn by hopes for a better life, for land and money. They settled in towns and countryside in Indiana and Nebraska.\n\nIn Nebraska Emiline Kellogg married Kit’s grandfather, Marshall Carson (born c. 1833). Marshall’s ancestors remain unknown, but he had more adventurous blood than most of the Kellogg clan. He and his bride traveled to the rude frontier of western Nebraska, where he staked a barren gold claim.\n\nMarshall eventually settled in Logan, Iowa. There, Johnny’s father was born in 1899. After a stint in the service during World War I, Kit took an uncle’s advice and entered the University of Nebraska to study dentistry. After a year he left to join a crew stringing up electric transmission lines. This was a man’s work, tough and dangerous. Among these rough-hewn, rowdy men, Kit was a rarity. He was soon called down from the lines to a managerial position. As lean and sparing in words as in appearance, he was a fair man with the workers and the clerical staff.\n\nRuth Hook, the woman Carson met and married in 1922, was born in Bedford, Iowa, in 1901. Better educated than her husband, she had attended Simpson College in Indianola, a rare feat for a woman of her generation. Originally Irish, the Hooks were also an old American family, arriving in America from London in 1668 and settling in Maryland.\n\nIf there are no esteemed explorers, no legendary storytellers, no men and women of historic vision in the Carson and Hook clans, there are also no horse thieves or murderers. Johnny’s father was not related to Kit Carson, the legendary western hero, but the nickname stuck to him.\n\nThe Carson family was full of hardworking tillers of the land. Legend had it that Mrs. Carson was related to Captain James Hook, who may have served with George Washington at Valley Forge. Hook lost a slice of his ear to an assailant’s knife; the good captain, a man of the Old Testament, proceeded to bite off his adversary’s ear. Another ancestor, Judge James Hardy, a quixotic Iowa jurist, might well have found that Captain Hook had meted out appropriate justice.\n\nThough the Carsons were not regular churchgoers, Johnny was nominally a Methodist. The Carsons were not active in civic groups, nor were they especially social. They minded their own business, and in the value system of Avoca, that was a high virtue.\n\nWhen outsiders see the small towns and large farms of the Great Plains, they assume that the roots of the people are as deep as the wells. The Carsons, though, were a transient family, moving from place to place as Kit was transferred from one executive position to another. Although his earliest memories are of Avoca, John William Carson was born seventy miles away in Corning, Iowa, a town of about eighteen hundred people, on October 23, 1925. In Corning the Carsons lived in an upstairs apartment before renting a tiny square house on Main Street.\n\nJohnny was scarcely a toddler before the Carsons were off again, to Clarinda, forty miles to the southeast, and then to Red Oak, thirty miles to the northwest. These towns had their broad main streets where the farmers came on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Each had its courthouse, and they were all stops on the railroad line. And they had their proud boosters.\n\nJohn Wayne was born in Winterset, another southwest Iowa town. This was truly John Wayne country, a land of flag-waving, God-fearing, churchgoing, hardworking, provincial, patriotic people. They were at times intolerant of those of a different hue or culture, but their locale had been a stop on the Underground Railroad. They were conservative, but they were also a spawning ground for the militant farmer movements; indeed, today Coming is the headquarters of the National Farmers Organization. They were at times disdainful of the poor, but they could be monumentally generous toward those in need, stricken down by illness, age, or bad luck.\n\nAs a people, they are extraordinarily reticent, secretive even, about personal matters. If decency and good manners are part of this reticence, a shade of hypocrisy is there too. Appearance is the truth that matters. A man bought his liquor in the next town, and sinned with the shades down. Memory was supposed to be a sieve that drained out all that was petty and small, leaving only a few sweet anecdotes. One talked of the present as of the past, as if the world were made of pleasantries. Inquisitiveness was rudeness.\n\nFew people in these towns remember the Carsons. Mabel Gaskill, who baby-sat for Johnny in Corning when he was a year and five months old, recalls him only as a cute little kid, the parents as lovely people. Helen Andrews, a neighbor, recollects only where they lived, and where they came from. Jim Logan, whose mother played bridge with Ruth Carson in Red Oak, recalls nothing either.\n\nJohnny’s parents were born and bred among these people, and their eldest son shared many of their traits. To learn the truth about a person, one did not ask baldly for the facts. As often as not, humor was the vehicle of truth. Even today, if one sits in the coffee shops or the American Legion halls, one hears a sly, subtle humor. Humor is a whole different medium of communication. When a man leaves the table, he is sometimes knifed in the back, not by a steely blade but by barbs that are just as sharp and just as destructive of his reputation.\n\nJohnny started kindergarten in Red Oak, where his father was the local superintendent of the Iowa and Nebraska Power Company. He had been in school only a month when the family moved to Avoca, forty-five miles to the north.\n\nKit Carson was not only a leading citizen, he was the manager of a company whose product was universally wanted, a product that dramatically changed the life of the people of Avoca and the countryside. Electricity and gas brought magical possibilities to the farmer: food that did not spoil, irons that did not have to be stoked with coals, light that was almost as bright as day, and steady heat in the winter. Kit Carson wasn’t like the banker, or the storekeeper, whose presence reminded people of debts and obligations and hungry stomachs.\n\nThe Carsons lived on the good side of town, and felt little of the Depression. Most others in Avoca and elsewhere were not so fortunate, and the more affluent townspeople did what they could to help. In the winter of 1932 they sent a railroad car of hay to the people of Armour, South Dakota, for their stock, and received a letter back telling of women and children almost starving. Out in the countryside the banks foreclosed on farm after farm. In May 1933 about a hundred farmers went to the courthouse in Le Mars, to accost the judge who had signed many of the foreclosure notices. They grabbed Judge C. C. Bradley from the bench and took him out into the countryside to see their lands. They covered him with axle grease and said that they would hang him, and then they choked him until he fainted.\n\nIf a boy had seen that, or heard his father tell such tales, he would remember. But Johnny has no such tales to tell. His boyhood friends Bill Brennan and Marion Weinmann didn’t suffer, either, during the Great Depression. But they can talk for hours of those who did.\n\nJohnny’s most vividly recalled memory of Avoca is the day he invited Peggy Leach to the movies. He was only eight, and the Carsons thought that their son was a bit precocious. Mrs. Carson telephoned and said Johnny was going to ask Peggy on a date, remembers Mrs. Leach, who lives in the same house on Main Street in Avoca as she did half a century ago when Johnny came to call. She said, ‘We’re not going to make anything of it.’\n\nJohnny remembers that he ran home from the theater leaving Peggy stranded. The object of Johnny’s affection has a different memory. I’m sure he stayed for the movies, says Peggy Leach Ebles. Catherine, his sister, went with us. I remember the afternoon very plainly. He had on a black turtleneck sweater and knickers. I don’t remember a thing about his running away.\n\nJohnny had no opportunity to pursue his friendship with Peggy Leach. Soon afterward, the Carsons left Avoca. It was third grade, and we had a going-away party in the room, says Peggy Leach Ebles. He was sitting on one of those old-fashioned desks.\n\nThe departure of Johnny’s father was notable enough to merit an article on the front page of the Avoca Herald: H.L. ‘Kit’ Carson who has been the manager of the local office for the Iowa-Nebraska Electric Light and Power Company has been given the management of the company’s office in Norfolk, Nebraska. This is a very nice promotion for Mr. Carson, and goes to prove where a young man is willing to work and give good honest service to his employer, there is a better opportunity ahead for him. Mr. Carson came to Avoca about three years ago…. He has served his company well. Norfolk is one of the largest towns in which the Iowa-Nebraska Electric Light and Power Company is serving the people. It is considered one of their best towns and the change from Avoca to Norfolk means much to Mr. Carson.\n\nNo moving van carried the Carsons’ possessions to Nebraska. Instead, Orvie Fisher hosed out one of the Jacobson Brothers’ stock trucks. We washed it out as clean as we could get it, Fisher says. We had moving pads and we tarped it.\n\nOn an October day in 1933, the Carson family drove due westward. The farmers had harvested the land, and the barns and silos were heavy with bounty. Nebraska is one of the most rural states in America, and the Carsons saw only a few small towns. The state had only two cities with populations over twenty-five thousand, Omaha and Lincoln.\n\nAs the car approached the outskirts of Norfolk, the family was entering what to them was a big city. With a population of slightly over ten thousand, Norfolk was the sixth-largest city in the state. The town wasn’t simply a stop on the rail line, it was a depot for three railroads: the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha; the Northwestern; and the Union Pacific.\n\nNorfolk was set amid fertile farmland in the Elkhorn River Valley. To the east and south stood other good-sized towns, but westward lay hundreds of miles of rolling grasslands, prairie land without a major town.\n\nFarmers and ranchers and village merchants drove scores of miles to trade and talk in Norfolk. The Norfolk Daily News billed itself as the best country daily in America. The thousand-seat Granada Theater was a secular temple with ornate fixtures and decorations. WJAG was one of the first radio stations in the country, beaming out across the plains with a thousand watts of power. The town even had a professional baseball team, the Norfolk Elks, of the Nebraska State League.\n\nKit Carson drove down Norfolk Avenue to the Norfolk Hotel, the finest structure in town—depot for such bus companies as the Corn Belt, the Arrow Stage Lines, and the Yellow Diamond, and nightly stop for traveling salesmen and visiting dignitaries. The Carson family was put into rooms on the top floor of the four-story brick building.\n\nYears later Johnny remembered how he had looked down and thought that he had never seen such a city. This Main Street was twice as wide as Avoca’s, with scores of cars parked perpendicular to the curb. He finally pulled back from the window and got ready for bed. He tried to sleep, but he lay awake for hours.\n\nThe next morning Mrs. Carson marched eight-year-old Johnny down to the Grant Elementary School and entered him in the third grade.\n\nAs they had in Avoca, the Carsons lived on the good side of town, in a house at 306 S. Sixteenth Street. Norfolk was settled in part by Germans, and the Carson dwelling had the stout structure that a provincial Bürgermeister would have approved. It was a two-story, three-bedroom frame house, dwarfed by the elm trees along the avenue. The home even had that midwestern luxury a sleeping porch. Johnny and Dick shared a room together, while their sister, Catherine, had her own bedroom.\n\nNorfolk, founded in 1866, was only a generation beyond the frontier. The oldest house in Norfolk, built in 1868 or 1869, sat on a lot a few blocks from the Carsons’ home. The Wild West lived in Norfolk in the person of Dr. Richard Tanner, the famous Diamond Dick of dime novels. Dr. Tanner drove his Model-T down Norfolk Avenue and told tales of frontier shoot-outs. Another citizen, Fred Patzel, brought fame to his hometown when he won the 1926 national hog-calling championship. His prize-winning call was to have been broadcast over WJAG. Alas, when Patzel let out his historic holler, he knocked the radio station off the air.\n\nWJAG considered itself the voice of the farmer, and the farmer was particularly interested in two things: weather and crop prices. This was a land of such extremes in climate as to make a Quaker swear. In summer you baked, and in winter you froze, and in spring you worried about the floods. Old-timers could remember a plague of grasshoppers, and the high-water mark from the flood of 1912 still stood on many buildings in downtown Norfolk.\n\nThe Nebraska climate was a mark of regional pride, the stuff of tall tales. But nobody joked about the Dirty Thirties. For half a decade Nebraska had been cursed by drought or near-drought. In 1934 only 14.31 inches of rain fell on the state, the least since 1864. The rich soil was turning to powder and dust, blowing in great dark clouds across the prairie. With the crash of 1929, wheat that had brought sixty-seven cents a bushel now brought only twenty-eight cents, corn once worth a dollar a bushel now sold for eight cents.\n\nThis was not the Carsons’ world though, and soon Johnny was as comfortable in Norfolk as he had been in Avoca. He did his Popeye imitation and made the kids laugh. He and his friends went to the YMCA, where Chief Moore, the longtime head"
