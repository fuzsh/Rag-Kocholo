        "text": "The wonderful Stevie Wonder…haha honestly that was an accidental pun, but it is true. I have loved Stevie Wonder for a lot of my young life. I am sure I heard his songs before I knew who he was, especially the song “I Just Called To Say I Love You”.\n\nHowever, if my memory serves me well, the first time I was consciously introduced to him as an artist was on The Cosby Show. He made a heartwarming appearance as a guest on the show, playing himself as an important part of the episode’s story.\n\nAt that moment, the way he carried himself as a person seemed to radiate goodness and positivity. This — in my opinion — is just as evident in his music.\n\nAs a spiritual person and someone who likes to be positive, I gravitate towards Stevie a lot as an artist. I feel like there are wonderful things to learn from his music. One of which is an awesome, upbeat song called “Isn’t She Lovely”.\n\nIsn’t She Lovely debuted on his 1976 album Songs in the Key of Life? It won album of the year at the 19th Grammy Awards. To this day, Songs in the Key of Life is Stevie Wonder’s best-selling and most critically-acclaimed album of his career.\n\nThe song Isn’t She Lovely was written as a beautiful expression of love from a special moment in Stevie’s life. That event was the birth of his first-born daughter, Aisha.\n\nHere is the song below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE56g61mW44\n\nThe Beautiful Irony\n\nIsn’t She Lovely an amazing song title for any song, let alone about the birth of someone’s firstborn child? However, there is a unique circumstance that makes this song have a deeper and more beautiful meaning/life lesson.\n\nThe circumstance that changed my whole perspective on this song, is the fact that Stevie Wonder is completely, physically blind.\n\nStevie Wonder has been blind all his life. He knows nothing of the colorful, beauty of this physical world. However, that does not mean he knows nothing about beauty, because I believe he does.\n\nHere is a man who has had the continual experience of not being able to see physical things but still contains the powerful gift of recognizing the purest form of beauty.\n\nIn the song, he sings lines like…Isn’t she lovely?… Isn’t she pretty…Truly the Angels’ best. Two of those lines people often associate with physical appearance, but he still says them even though he is blind. Why?\n\nThe Beauty Of Life\n\nFrom my perspective — in answering the previous question — the answer is that life is precious. Precious is a term used in the song, Stevie shows that you do need to see the physical circumstance of someone’s life to know that life is a valuable and beautiful thing.\n\nExercising The Gift Of Our Spiritual Eyes\n\nThe lesson that sticks out to me the most from this iconic song, is the importance of looking at people through our spiritual eyes. We constantly use our physical eyes to judge but sometimes due to the stereotypes of the world we judge and come to a conclusion inaccurately and prematurely.\n\nFor there are millions of beautiful people on this gorgeous earth of ours. Beauty should be recognized but gets lost in the physical expectation of beauty.\n\nPhysical beauty is aesthetically pleasing, but it is still subjective. However, spiritual beauty shines from the inside outcomes from the beauty of someone’s soul, and that kind of beauty is only called beauty because of the association it has with the fundamental principle of goodness.\n\nConclusion\n\nThat is the perspective this song gives me and I am grateful to Stevie Wonder for sharing it through his eyes. Stevie Wonder may be blind, but he has shown through his music that he sees things that some people with good eyesight do not."
