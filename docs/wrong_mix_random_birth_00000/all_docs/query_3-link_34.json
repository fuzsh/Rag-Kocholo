        "text": "Few artists are as universally appreciated as Stevie Wonder. The musical maestro, who found fame as an 11-year-old whizkid, Wonder has delivered countless albums of cultural significance over his six-decade-long career. With over 25 Grammys to his name and a heap of admirers, it can be rightly assumed that Wonder is one of the most gifted songwriters of all time.\n\nTragically struck with blindness as an infant, Wonder would overcome his disability to become one of the most celebrated sonic auteurs of his time. Signing a record deal at age 11 and touring with The Rolling Stones not long after, Wonder’s ability to not only play like a musical monster but craft songs like a Motown Mozart has given him a career that few can hope to compete with.\n\nA singular figure, Wonder’s influence on the landscape of pop culture is hard to ignore. Whether it is his wildly influential albums like Songs in the Key of Life, Innervisions and Hotter Than July or his era-defining songs ‘Superstition’, ‘Isn’t She Lovely’ and ‘For Once In My Life’, Wonder has shaped the world of music as we know it today.\n\nHowever, what is a little less known is the plethora of songs he has written for other artists during his career. Within the extensive list of collaborators below and the accompanying playlist, there is one sure-fire thing to take away: Stevie Wonder is perhaps the most highly regarded songwriter of his generation.\n\nOf course, not all of the songs below are hits. Bar perhaps his era-defining work on Rufus’ song ‘Tell Me Something Good’, which provided a soundtrack to many an infamous night, there are few that ever reached the heights of Wonder’s solo work — the less said, the better about his work with Raven Symone. However, the calibre of his songwriting partners or performers on the below track is truly astonishing.\n\nWhether it is his work with Syreeta, his songwriting for Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, The Supremes, Martha & The Vandellas, The Four Tops, The Temptations or countless others, it is safe to assume that the Motown revolution would not have taken place without the influence of Stevie Wonder.\n\nBut it wasn’t just in the halls of Gordy Berry’s label that Wonder delivered hits. He also regularly collaborated with the rock and roll world, working alongside Jeff Beck on his song ‘Thelonious’ while also helping Paul McCartney, The Beach Boys, John Denver and many more in their attempts at crafting the perfect track.\n\nWhile you can find the full list below, one thing is for certain: within the reels of impressive collaborations listed, there are few songs not made better by Wonder’s presence.\n\nSongs Stevie Wonder wrote for other artists:"
