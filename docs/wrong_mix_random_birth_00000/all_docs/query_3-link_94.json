        "text": "This is Motown Junkies, an unofficial guide to every Motown single ever released, or planned for release, on every US Motown label (or via Tamla Motown in the UK), featuring reviews of each A-side and B-side in chronological order. New reviews appear every couple of days.\n\nThink of it as an unauthorised track-by-track companion to the magnificent The Complete Motown Singles CD box sets, and beyond, with marks out of ten.\n\nI'm NOT Paul Nixon.\n\nFURTHER INFORMATION\n\nMore info about the blog (and me) can be found here. If you want to leave a comment on any review, please feel free to do so - all feedback, corrections, disagreements and encouragements gratefully received. If you've something you'd rather not say in public, I can be contacted at fosse8 at gmail dot com.\n\n(Oh, and if you arrived here looking for the Motown Junkies music group, they're nothing to do with me, I'm afraid - but they are very nice people, and they can be found at www.motownjunkies.com instead.)\n\nYou can jump straight to the full list of reviews so far in the Master Index, or browse by label instead.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more specific, you can click an artist's name in the \"Artist\" menu at the top of the screen to see a little biography and all the reviews we've done for them so far. Only people whose records I've already discussed appear there at the moment - more names will be added to the lists all the time as I work my way through Motown's history, so do keep checking back!\n\nAlternatively, the front page displays excerpts from the most recent reviews, and on the right hand side of the screen you'll see a list of the most recent entries and also a sampling of the most popular entries from the last 48 hours, as well as the latest comments left by visitors.\n\nDive in, explore and have fun!\n\nThis is an unofficial site, and is not affiliated in any way with Universal Motown, Hip-O Select or any of the artists referred to in the blog.\n\nWhere indicated, label scan images appear by kind permission of Lars \"LG\" Nilsson (as originally prepared for the Complete Motown Singles series).\n\nDigital images courtesy of Gordon Frewin are supplied for use at motownjunkies.co.uk by arrangement. All applicable rights reserved. No unauthorised republication is permitted.\n\nMany label images were kindly provided by Robb Klein, together with invaluable historical research.\n\nAll text Â© Motown Junkies, 2009-19.
