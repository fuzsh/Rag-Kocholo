        "text": "During his teens, Wonder proved himself onstage and in the studio as a singer, keyboardist, harmonica player, drummer and, with hits like “Uptight (Everything’s Alright)” and “Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I’m Yours),” as a songwriter. He revealed musicianship that was both richly and widely grounded — in gospel, R&B, jazz, show tunes, folk, pop, country, classical music and more — and playfully but determinedly recombinant. Even when he was a teenager, his music meshed and reconfigured genres.\n\nWonder’s first Motown Records contract ended as he turned 21 in 1971. Other labels were eager to sign him, and when he returned to the Black-owned Motown, he had won complete creative control for himself. From then on, he would write and produce his own songs, release albums when he decided they were finished and choose his own collaborators. He made an unexpected choice for starters: Malcolm Cecil and Robert Margouleff, a team of musicians, producers and engineers.\n\nIn what were still the early days of synthesizers, Cecil and Margouleff had constructed a Frankenstein monster of an instrument they called TONTO (which they retronymed The Original New Timbral Orchestra). It weighed more than a ton. Margouleff and Cecil had connected modules and keyboards from Moog, Arp and other manufacturers and figured out a way for the formerly incompatible devices to control one another. Billing themselves as Tonto’s Expanding Head Band, Margouleff and Cecil made a 1971 album of synthesizer pieces, “Zero Time,” and Wonder heard in it the possibilities for sounds he wanted to summon from his keyboards.\n\nIn their test run — a three-day weekend working together in the studio — Wonder wrote 17 songs. From 1972-74, with Wonder writing the songs and Cecil and Margouleff programming the sounds, they would make four landmark albums: “Music of My Mind,” “Talking Book,” “Innervisions” and “Fulfillingness’ First Finale.”\n\nJACOB COLLIER (musician) I did an arrangement of “You and I,” it was the first Grammy I ever won. It’s a totally epic ballad, and a totally perfect love song wide open for different kinds of interpretations. The idea of you and I can mean two lovers, it can mean a brother and a sister or a mother and a son, or someone who is not there, or two different parts of yourself — there’s so many different ways you can approach the idea of two.\n\nThe kind of inevitable-feeling modulations is one thing. He starts in F-sharp major, which is one of his favorite keys, and then he just slips into E flat halfway through the verse and you don’t even notice. He has that lovely gift of making it feel so natural.\n\nBack in ’72, there were these monophonic synths where you had to play each note one at a time. And there’s one of these really characterful little passageways that he carves into the song. At that time, the world was learning what on earth a synthesizer was, and I think Stevie was the first person who really made it sing like that. And he had this lovely way of intuitively layering sounds. Rather than them feeling like lots of layers that have different feelings, they all felt like the same expression of the same instrument, which is like Stevie. Stevie is an instrument."
