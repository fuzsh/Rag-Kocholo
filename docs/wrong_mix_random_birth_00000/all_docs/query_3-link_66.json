        "text": "Stevie Wonder\n\n“Just because a man lacks the use of his eyes doesn’t mean he lacks vision.”\n\nName: Stevie Wonder\n\nBorn: May 13, 1950\n\nFrom: Saginaw Michigan\n\nOccupation: Singer/Songwriter, Musician, and Producer\n\nWorks: “I Just Called to Say I Love You”\n\nAwards: Artist of the Decade (1985), Best Original Song (1985), Ambassador of Peace Award (1998), Lifetime Achievement Awards (2000-2002, 2004, 2007), President Medal of Freedom (2014), and many grammy nominations!\n\nFun Facts: Stevie Wonder was not born blind! He unfortunately lost his eyesight due to an experience he had as an infant. Wonder was born prematurely and experienced an overload of oxygen in his incubator, leading to the loss of his sight.\n\nStevie Wonder is an American musician who is best known for his Motown/R&B hit songs like “Superstition”, “My Cherie Amor”, and “I Was Made to Love Her”. What sets Wonder apart from other instrumentalists is that he is blind! Wonder lost his eyesight as an infant, but that did not stop him from stardom. Wonder learned how to play instruments, like the piano, harmonica, and drums, at his local church. This ignited his lifelong love of music! Wonder continues to play his songs to this day. Stevie Wonder also uses his platform to tackle critical social issues, like fundraising for “American Foundation for AIDS Research” (amfAR), celebrating the work done by Martin Luther King Jr. And Malcolm X., as well as being an advocate for people with disabilities.\n\nHandout\n\nTo download the Handout:\n\nClick on the image\n\nRight-click and select Save Image As…\n\nPrint\n\nWrite a description on the line and decorate.\n\nCut out and use for a selfie to share on our social media page.\n\nDownload a card and envelope template and write about an idea this leader inspires.\n\nCheck out more resources and ways to celebrate MLK can be found on these links as well as our official Day of Service opportunity to volunteer.\n\nThis ASI Special event is an ongoing volunteer-led project made by people like you, using multiple educational sources regularly being revised and updated.
