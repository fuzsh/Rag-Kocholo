        "text": "Entering his 20's in 1970, Stevie Wonder would truly come into his own as an artist. Now producing most of his own music on his own, Wonder renegotiated a more fair contract with Motown Records and soon began releasing his most successful albums to date. Going for a more experimental sound, Wonder worked with synthesizers in many of his songs, a first for R&B. His subsequent albums would be much more consistent thematically, which was uncommon for the genre. Talking Book, released in 1972 had two #1 hits: You Are The Sunshine Of My Life and Superstition, which is still Wonder's most popular song. Both songs went on to win awards at that year's Grammys.\n\nFinding further success in following albums Innervisions and Fulfillingness' First Finale, which both won album of the year when they were released, Wonder's biggest success was yet to come. In 1976, Songs In The Key Of Life was the culmination of Wonder's classic period. The album debuted at the top of the charts, and stayed at the top for more than three months. I Wish and Sir Duke both topped pop/R&B charts, and the double-album quickly became Wonder's crowning achievement. Sir Duke, the most popular song from the album, served as an ode to jazz greats like Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Ella Fitzgerald, that inspired him as a growing musician. The lyrically complex and socially conscious album explored themes of parenthood, poverty, and piety, and went on to win three Grammys, including album of the year.\n\nDuring his career, Stevie Wonder has amassed 25 Grammy awards and countless more nominations. Several of his albums made Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of all time, with Songs In The Key Of Life at number 4. In his older years, he has continued to release music, but at a slower rate than his peak in the 1970's. However, his undeniable talent and trailblazing spirit has had an undeniable impact on not only R&B, but popular music as a whole."
