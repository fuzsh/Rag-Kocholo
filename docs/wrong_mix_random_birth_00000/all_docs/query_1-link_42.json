This is where she is most inspired.\n\nMy Silly Granny is a heartwarming story of a little girl known as Sweetheart and her dear Granny who has dementia. On a visit, Granny explains to Sweetheart how a few simple acts of kindness can tap into her youthful spirit and help them both navigate the day with love and positivity. Her gentle, innocent voice explains how simple pleasures like laughing and singing can keep her in the present and what itâs like when she begins to lose track of things.\n\nThis book was written to provide some insight into how people with dementia behave in hopes of reducing childrenâs anxiety about their elderly relatives who may sometimes forget important things or act in strange ways.\n\nâ"
