        "text": "As I know I’ve already mentioned, since I turned 70 this past April, I’ve decided to stop worrying about repeating myself. So here I go again. Asking me to name my favorite music, or favorite composer, or favorite performer is something of a waste of time, as I tend to be most in love with whatever/whomever I’ve just been listening to. Besides, at this point of my life, I rarely listen to music just for pleasure. Rather, I’m typically listening to the music I’m writing about or preparing to lecture about. However, there is an exception to this work-related listening – when I actually listen to music for the sheer pleasure of it – and that’s when I’m in my car. Answer: 99% of the time, it’s jazz piano. And for the last 18 months (or so), it’s been almost exclusively albums featuring Bill Evans (1929-1980) playing solo, or with the guitarist Jim Hall as a duo, or with various of his trios… https://lnkd.in/gjaymrpv #DrBobPrescribes #BillEvans #Alone\n\n#MusicHistoryMonday: We mark the death on July 15, 1857 – 167 years ago today – of the Austrian composer, pianist, chronicler of Beethoven, and teacher Carl Czerny. For all his various and extraordinary contributions, Czerny must be considered an indispensable person to Western music during the first half of the nineteenth century! For a full explanation as to WHY I consider Carl Czerny to be as indispensable to the music and piano playing IN the nineteenth century as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt, and Howard T.

In some, he appeared solo. In others, he appeared with his wife and performing partner, Eydie Gormé (1928-2013). In still others, he appeared with his best pal, Sammy Davis Jr. I watched Steve Lawrence perform and be interviewed on his friend Johnny Carson’s Show (on which he appeared many times) and the Ed Sullivan Show (ditto). In fact, I spent an entire afternoon watching Steve Lawrence videos. It was an altogether shocking pleasure, one that evoked from me applause (is there anything more stupid, really, than applauding a YouTube video?), laughter, a few tears, and the most acute nostalgia: I hadn’t realized – or at least I hadn’t remembered – how much these mid-century entertainers had shaped by musical consciousness and cultural awareness. Well, I’ve been reminded. This post will share with you some of what I watched: https://lnkd.in/eqm4wh-B #DrBobPrescribes\n\n#MusicHistoryMonday: We mark the birth on July 8, 1935 – 89 years ago today - of the American Grammy and Emmy Award-winning singer, actor, and comedian Steve Lawrence, in Brooklyn, New York. He died just four months ago, on March 7, 2024, in Los Angeles. Steve Lawrence, you ask? Okay, I will admit that there is an ulterior motive here.

As we observed in that post, the renovation and construction is being carried out at the expense of the Lobkowicz family, an ancient and once super-wealthy Bohemian noble family… https://lnkd.in/gkfvSXWk\n\nLast week’s Dr. Bob Prescribes post dealt with the 1970s, the phenomenon that was disco, and the movie Saturday Night Fever of 1977. Likewise, yesterday’s Music History Monday post also dealt with the 1970s: the invention of the Walkman in 1979. As such, I’ve decided to stick with the 1970s in today’s #DrBobPrescribes as well, with music that – like disco - also reflects something of its time. However, rather than focus on the frivolous escapism that was disco culture, today’s post will feature music that mirrors some of the most profound issues of its time: Fredirec Rzewski, The People United Will Never Be Divided! ➡️ https://lnkd.in/g37UphTR\n\n#MusicHistoryMonday: We mark the introduction on July 1, 1979 – 45 years ago today – of the Sony Walkman. The Walkman was the first entirely portable, high-fidelity (or at least fairly high-fidelity) audio cassette player, an absolutely revolutionary device that allowed a user to listen to entire albums anywhere, anytime. Introduced initially in Japan, the higher-ups at Sony expected to sell 5000 units a month for the first six months after its release. Instead, they sold 30,000 units in the first month alone and then – then – sales exploded. All told, Sony has sold over 400 million Walkmen (“Walkmans”?) in cassette, CD, mini-disc, and digital file VERSIONS, and Sony remained the market leader among portable music players until the introduction of Apple’s iPod on October 23, 2001.

For Dr. Bob Prescribes? SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER? You betcha we’re doing Saturday Night Fever! The topic of this post was prompted by yesterday’s Music History Monday, entitled “Boogie Fever.” But make no mistake: today’s topic is not merely a fortuitous add-on to yesterday’s Music History Monday post but an entirely worthy musical and cinematic topic of its own. So for those prone to sneer, scoff not, as we will make a case for both disco and this movie as popular masterworks, iconic representations of a fascinating – if easily derided – genre of dance and dance music!"
