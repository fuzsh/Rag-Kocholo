        "text": "NEW YORK — Robert James Waller, whose best-selling, bittersweet 1992 novel \"The Bridges of Madison County\" was turned into a movie starring Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood and a Broadway musical, has died in Texas, according to his literary agency. The Iowa-raised author was 77.\n\nScott Cawelti of Cedar Falls told the Associated Press that Weller died early Friday at his home in Fredericksburg, Texas. He had been fighting multiple myeloma, a form of cancer.\n\nIn \"Bridges,\" which Waller famously wrote in 11 days, the roving National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid spends four days romancing Francesca Johnson, a war bride from Italy married to a no-nonsense Iowa farmer. One famous line from the book reads: \"The old dreams were good dreams; they didn't work out but I'm glad I had them.\"\n\nWaller's novel reached No. 1 on The New York Times best-seller list and stayed on it for over three years; the Eastwood-directed 1995 movie grossed $182 million worldwide.\n\nThe film version was greeted warmly by audiences and critics. The New York Times said that Eastwood had made \"a moving, elegiac love story.\" The New York Daily News said, \"On that short shelf of classic movie romances 'Seventh Heaven,' 'Brief Encounter,' 'An Affair to Remember' you can now place 'The Bridges of Madison County.'\"\n\nMany critics made fun of \"Bridges,\" calling it sappy and cliche-ridden. \"Waller depicts their mating dance in plodding detail, but he fails to develop them as believable characters,\" Eils Lotozo wrote in the New York Times in 1993. \"Instead, we get a lot of quasi-mystical business about the shaman-like photographer who overwhelms the shy, bookish Francesca with 'his sheer emotional and physical power.'\"\n\nReaders, however, bought more than 12 million copies in 35 languages. \"Bridges\" turned the unknown writer into a multimillionaire and made Madison County, Iowa, an international tourist attraction.\n\n\"I really do have a small ego,\" Waller told the New York Times in 2002. \"I am open to rational discussion. If you don't like the book and can say why, I am willing to listen. But the criticism turned to nastiness. ... I was stunned.\"\n\nRELATED:\n\nThe ultimate list of Iowa movies\n\nFrom 2014: Story gets new life on the stage\n\nReview: 'Bridges' musical crosses into new territory\n\nUNI looking to honor author Waller\n\n'Bridges of Madison County' manuscript heads to UNI\n\nThe novel prompted couples across the world to marry on Madison County's covered bridges. Around the town of Winterset, population 4,200, tourists arrived by the busloads, buying \"Bridges\" T-shirts, perfume and postcards. Thousands signed in at the Chamber of Commerce office, where they could use restrooms marked \"Roberts\" and \"Francescas.\"\n\nAfter the novel's success, Weller left Iowa, where he had grown up, and moved to a ranch in Alpine, Texas, 50 miles from the nearest town. He also divorced his wife of 36 years, with whom he had a daughter, Rachel Waller, and found a new partner in Linda Bow, who worked on the ranches as a landscaper.\n\nA musical was made of \"The Bridges of Madison County\" in 2014 starring Kelli O'Hara and Steven Pasquale with a score by Jason Robert Brown, but it closed after just 137 performances on Broadway. A national tour starring Elizabeth Stanley kicked off in 2015.\n\nWaller told The Des Moines Register's Jack Hovelson in 1992 that \"Bridges\" was \"written\" in his mind as he drove from Des Moines to Cedar Falls after photographing the covered bridges in Madison County.\n\n\"It's something that's difficult to explain,\" he recounted. \"As I drove home, it just came to me. I had some sort of Zen feeling, a high. When I got home, I threw my stuff on the floor and immediately started writing.\"\n\nTwo weeks later, \"Bridges\" was done, in rough draft. Shirley Koslowski of Waterloo read the manuscript, suggested some changes, and \"Bridges\" was ready for the publisher.\n\n\"It was like a fairy tale. The Universe gave me this book. It's a gift. My idea originally had been to make a few copies of \"Bridges,\" give them to friends who'd read it, then we'd have a good party,\" Waller said.\n\nBefore \"Bridges,\" Waller published two books of his essays, \"Just Beyond the Firelight\" and \"One Good Road Is Enough.\" A third book, \"Iowa: Perspectives on Today and Tomorrow,\" wasn't intended to be a book. It was the product of a study the Iowa General Assembly commissioned Waller to do on the state's future. All three were published by Iowa State University Press.\n\nIt was in his father's produce store in Rockford in north-central Iowa, where he grew up, that Waller acquired the feel for business that propelled him into that field as a professor and dean of the UNI School of Business from 1979 to 1986, and as an international consultant on problem-solving and business development.\n\nBefore all that there was basketball; a seven-year era of achievement and acclaim. He views it as a wasted seven years.\n\n\"I would have been much better off spending that time reading poetry,\" he said, rejecting the traditional claims that athletics build character, teach sportsmanship and prepare people for the competitiveness of life.\n\nAs a 5-foot-2 high school freshman desperate to please his father, Waller calculated the way to succeed was with a jump shot. He developed one that carried him to All-North Central Conference honors as a player at UNI.\n\n\"The jump shot for me was an art form,\" he said. \"Competition for me was always within myself. I never had the killer instinct. Athletics took up an enormous amount of time. I think it retards maturing.\"\n\nWaller's other books include \"Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend,\" which unseated \"Bridges\" on the best-seller list, \"Border Music\" and \"Puerto Vallarta Squeeze.\"\n\nIn addition, \"A Thousand County Roads: An Epilogue to The Bridges of Madison County,\" a sequel to his monster hit, was prompted by thousands of letters from people who wanted to know more about the characters. \"Finally, I got curious and decided I'd find out — I wrote the book,\" he told the AP in 2002."
