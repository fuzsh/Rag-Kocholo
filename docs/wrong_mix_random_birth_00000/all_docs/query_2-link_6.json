        "text": "Elton John is all the rage right now, you guys!\n\nHe had his first UK #1 since 2005 with \"Cold Heart\" featuring Dua Lipa.\n\nElton John is obviously a very accomplished musician, but getting Dua Lipa, one of the hottest musical talents out right now on a song with you probably didn't hurt his odds at a #1.\n\nHowever, when you listen to \"Cold Heart\" did you know it is actually a mashup of FOUR Elton John songs! Yes, FOUR!\n\nMy compliments to Pnau, the Australian trio that produced this amazing track! Weaving these songs together so seamlessly is *chef's kiss*.\n\nI heard \"Rocketman\" right away. That is probably the most obvious. \"Rocketman\" was a big hit for Elton John back in 1972.\n\nThen, probably, the second most obvious is \"Sacrifice\". \"Sacrifice\" was a hit for John in 1989.\n\nThe next two are a little more tricky.\n\n\"Kiss the Bride\" was a bit of a sleeper song for Elton John back in 1983.\n\nFinally, the fourth song wasn't even ever a single. It was an album cut called \"Where's the Shoorah?\" from the 1976 album, Blue Moves.\n\nSo, how did you do? Did you know all four?\n\nDon't feel bad if you didn't. My mind was blown!\n\nI've seen Elton John in concert and consider myself a fan and I didn't even get \"Sacrifice\" on my own. I'm disappointed in myself.\n\n\"Cold Heart\" is the first single off of Elton John's latest album, The Lockdown Sessions. The album is full of collaborations with artists like Lil Nas X, Young Thug, Brandi Carlile, Jimmie Allen, Nicki Minaj, Stevie Wonder, and Stevie Nicks, just to name a few."
