Oswalt plays Roger, a regular guy who's always been suspicious of Adams (Armisen), his pretentious next door neighbor. One day Roger comes home to find Adams standing in his kitchen in his underwear. The allegorical conflict that ensues explores themes like fear of the other and anti-intellectualism that are very much of the moment in America today.\n\nFilmmaker Bio: Tom J Stern is showrunner/director of the Netflix Original Film Kevin Hart’s Guide to Black History (starring Kevin Hart, Tiffany Haddish, Lil Rel Howery, Tom Kenny, Weird Al Yankovic and others), as well as The Toys That Made Us, an 8 part documentary series also on Netflix. In 1987, while at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts, Tom collaborated with underground Austin rock legends Butthole Surfers on the short film Cherub. Also while at NYU he began a partnership with Alex Winter which lasted eight years – their college film Squeal of Death caught the attention of Sam Raimi who then developed a feature comedy script with them. After graduating the pair went to Hollywood and directed IMPACT Video Magazine, which featured cutting edge artists and performers such as Bill Hicks, Survival Research Labs, Public Enemy, Robert Williams, Jane’s Addiction, and another short film with Butthole Surfers. Tom got his first mainstream show business job writing for the Jim Henson Hour on NBC. After that he collaborated with Alex Winter on the MTV Sketch Comedy show The Idiot Box, which he co-wrote, co-directed, and co-starred in.

The birthplace and hometown of her family since the early 19th century, where her grandmother, considered by Portugali a \"Zen master,\" founded her hotel -- in a small stone building around a patio at the end of an alley in the old city that no longer exists.\n\nFilmmaker Bio: Nili Portugali is a well-known practicing Architect; senior lecturer; researcher and published author. Her multidisciplinary work, both in practice and theory, is closely connected to the holistic-phenomenological school of thought. She is a 7th-generation descendant of a family living in the holy 'Kabbala' city of Tsefat, Israel since the early 19th century. She was a senior lecturer at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, Jerusalem and at the Faculty of Architecture and Town Planning at the Technion, Haifa. She has been a guest lecturer at MIT, Harvard, Carleton University, Oxford University, TU Stuttgart; TU Dresden; TU Delft; and Tsinghua University China.

Following a mother and daughter's intimate journey of (re)discovering their connection to their culture while living in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, we will see what repercussions Aisha's educational choices will have on her family and community - ultimately exposing how the decision to self-direct one's education can continue to broader decolonization. In a world where school diplomas are supposed to offer access to the next rung on the social and economic ladder, can those who don't fit the dominant public school model still survive - and thrive?\n\nFilmmaker Bio: Jadis Mariette Dumas is a multidisciplinary artist working for over 7 years as an independent filmmaker and editor, specializing in documentary and video art. Primarily self-taught, she also completed Capilano University's Documentary Film Programme. Since then she has been a videographer and editor on various films being shown through international festivals, and is excited to be sharing her first feature film on decolonizing education, premièring at Montreal's RIDM this year.

This short film was created from segments of the feature film, Wake Up Sleeping Beauty, which we filmed during the pandemic lockdown, in September of 2020. Because the film was commissioned by the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health, we had to follow the strictest Covid-19 guidelines; which asked that no two actors could ever be in the same room at the same time. The film was made entirely via green screen, and stitched together to give the feel that the actors are occupying the same physical space.\n\nFilmmaker Bio: Shila Ommi, born in Tehran, has lived in Los Angeles since 1979. She is an actor with starring roles in Apple TV’s 'Tehran' and 'Little America'. She has directed and produced award winning plays in Los Angeles, and for over a decade toured internationally in an Iranian-American theater production company performing plays in Persian.\n\nCast: Darya Mina, Hedyeh Falsafi, Darya June Ellis, Ashfin Katanchi, Roxana Rastegar, Sharareh Shahbazi, Azar Miremadi - Director: Shila Ommi - Writer: Mastaneh Moghadam - Cinematographer: Hitoshi Inoue - Editor: Hitoshi Inoue - Composer: Arjang Rad\n\nThis video reveals the resurgent San Francisco Bay Area culture of zines – artistic publications that are self-made, accessible, intentionally tactile and NOT the Internet. We meet remarkable zine authors in their studios, a major art museum curator, and avid zine festival goers and promoters.\n\n​\n\nFilmmaker Bio: Fiona McDougall is the Creative Services and Video Producer at OneWorld Communications, where she oversees and coordinates all media production: TV broadcast PSAs, digital informational and educational videos, radio, print, photography, and web/online.

He has had individual and collective exhibitions of painting, photography, video art, installations and audiovisual performances in major cities and universities all over the world.\n\nDirector: Luis Carlos Rodríguez\n\nA parodic cinema trailer voiceover is paired with footage of a beach in south-west Ireland, filmed in the summer of 2019. The image and sound really have no connection with each other, which is the point, and hopefully the badly delivered bombast of the voiceover is humbled by shining banality in amateur camerawork, seaweed, surf, and sand. This is the third in a series of 16mm films called Crumbs, which I use to explore and experiment with different techniques and textures. The dog is called Monster. The camera had a buggered shutter.\n\n​\n\nFilmmaker Bio: Jack Wornell is an artist/filmmaker who makes short, landscape-based films exploring the tension between the humdrum and the ecstatic in everyday life. Using a lo-fi and eclectic approach, across a variety of film and video formats, his work seeks the transcendent in mundane objects and overlooked places, such as motorways, edgelands, road signs, and rubbish, often in the urban landscape of London where he lives. Material is often shot with no exact project in mind, and finds form and meaning in the process of editing. Each work has its own filmic language, but they all in some way evoke the messy, contradictory experience of place. His films have been screened at London Short Film Festival, Barbican, Whitechapel Gallery, BFI, Transient Visions, Exploding Cinema, Flatpack Festival, and Aesthetica Film Festival.\n\n​\n\nDirector: Jack Wormell - Writer: Jack Wormell\n\nTony Rios is a character actor always cast as the bad guy in TV shows and all he wants is to be a romantic lead in a Hallmark movie. During the pandemic his luck changes after meeting his number one fan virtually, Grace, while she’s repairing his computer over a Zoom call.\n\n​\n\nFilmmaker Bio: Salvador Paniagua is a filmmaker and photographer who is currently developing the television show Funny Brown People with A Good Home Pictures and Kontakto Entertainment. He recently sold his script But She Wasn’t Perfect to PixL Television.

He has traveled across the state of California filming and photographing the daily lives of farmworkers, as well as deep into the Sequoia National Forest documenting an outdoor education trip for Chadwick School students. His short documentary about Sacramento’s first Latino mayor, Joe Serna, was featured at the Sacramento Latino Film Festival.

This piece ponders on the act of looking at a plain brick wall, which starts to tell its story in a rhythmic burst of colours. The videopoem presented here is part of an album called Dark Myriad (Тьма Тем). The project aims to integrate the audio-visual elements into inseparable rhythmic and rhyming compositions. This approach strives to reach a universal type of poem, where the natural language of the spoken word is only a part of the composition and the knowledge of this language does not limit the understanding and appreciation of the piece. The project builds on Eta Dahlia’s previous videopoem album Little Flowers (Цветочки) and develops the visual aspects and techniques of creating a unified videopoetic experience. The title Dark Myriad comes from an ancient Slavonic numbering system and signifies the biggest possible number, which is linguistically associated with darkness and its perceived infinity.\n\n​\n\nFilmmaker Bio: ​​Eta Dahlia is a Russian poet and filmmaker based in London. His work combines minimalist Russian poetry with a range of audio-visual media. He works with spoken word, video, images, colours and music, integrating these elements into inseparable rhythmic and rhyming compositions to create coherent and complete multimedia poetic pieces. Through these interdisciplinary pieces Eta strives to reach a universal type of poem, where the understanding and appreciation of a piece is not limited to its original language. Recently, Eta's work has been exhibited in the UK as well as in the US, France, Germany, Italy, Romania and Mexico. His first videopoetry album Tsvetochki was selected by over twenty festivals worldwide and was awarded a number of prizes.\n\nCast: Iris Colomb, Ivan Isakov - Director: Eta Dahlia\n\nA commercial hype reel shredding the magic of the mechanism by which the dominant myth defends itself from deconstruction through the fabrication of dreams while simultaneously reproducing itself, duplicating, spreading, feeding, and manifesting into a structured ideology; this is a stretching of these ingredients across a digital canvas.\n\nFilmmaker Bio: Meg Case and Brad Porter are American artists and filmmakers. Having attended undergraduate and graduate film schools throughout the United States, they both went on to create commercials, short films, music videos, and independent feature films. Having spent 15 years in this global independent filmmaking community, while teaching as an associated professor of filmmaking at universities in Michigan and England and working as freelance artists in the commercial image-making industry, they have witnessed the pervasive and destructive ideologies and subsequent culture of traditionally-imagined independent filmmaking. Their work seeks to dismantle the manipulative nature of the “filmmaking” industry which capitalizes on producer/consumer systems of coercion, a culture which knowingly utilizes mind-numbing aesthetics to create an uninformed yet entertained (mindless) consumer. Their works explore the intersection of exploitative power structures and the continual becoming of each person through the liberating medium of experimental filmmaking.\n\nDirectors: Meg Case and Brad Porter - Cinematographers: Meg Case and Brad Porter - Editors: Meg Case and Brad Porter - Composers: Meg Case and Brad Porter\n\nA man suddenly gets a call from a stranger threatening the life of his girlfriend if he doesn't do what he’s told.\n\n​\n\nFilmmaker Bio: Ross Kolton is a Filmmaker and Editor in Los Angeles.

As the men struggle to survive, the power play between them devolves from the darkly comedic and absurd into crashing fear and existential terror.

Rrose's films are precisely honest. Their power derives from the juxtaposition of crisply evocative rhythms and imagery that is both personal and deep. The overall form of many of them is to begin the entrainment of thinking in one direction and then shift direction to carve a precise shape in thought. The levels of introspection this creates are like the stages in discourse.The complexity of the relationship between the direction of thought and the rhythms that propel it are wonderful.” - Daniel Barnett\n\nDirector: Rrose Present - Cinematographer: Rrose Present - Editor: Rrose Present - Composer: Oriol Perucho\n\nAn experimental animated short using clay and razor blades.\n\nFilmmaker Bio: David Hauptschein is a Chicago-based playwright, screenwriter, and visual artist.

As they grow up, they find their way back out. Sigurd Culhane never left. Directing has allowed him to embrace the stories constantly swirling through his mind, bringing them to life. Driven by the shock of abruptly losing his father and subsequently being raised by a strong, single, viking [read: Danish] mother, Sigurd is drawn to projects with strong female leads in worlds that dance around the surreal, horrific, supernatural, and/or fantastical. Though generally on the darker side, he enjoys bringing a balance with the injection of humor; just as he does in life, countering sometimes harsh realities and bouts of depression with making those around him laugh. After receiving his MA in Film from Syracuse University’s Newhouse School, he began making short films with the goal of leaving his audience with a visceral emotional - and sometimes even physical - reaction.\n\nCast: Colleen Foy, Patrick Tamisiea, Greg Santos, Max Crandall, Sam Mark - Director: Sigurd Culhane - Writers: Chris Valdez, Patrick Tamisiea - Cinematographer: Andrew Aiello - Editor: Paul Alderman - Composer: Leland Cox\n\nInspired by childhood videos shot in the late 1980s, “Growing Up Movies” is a new series featuring home video footage shot by kids who grew up to be actors, directors or writers. The show utilizes the old footage along with original cast members, now adults - reprising their old roles.

Chaos ensues and it’s all captured on video. Flash-forward to present day and after all these years, the case has still not been resolved. This experimental web series joins members of the original “cast” (who were young kids when the old movies were shot) with talented comedians + YouTube and social media stars playing the lawyers, arbitrator, host, and witnesses. With a retro look, thrown back to the late 1980s, Assholes In Arbitration pokes fun at old daytime shows like “The People’s Court,” while using the original videos as evidence in a legal showdown that spans the decades.\n\n​\n\nFilmmaker Bio: Greg Garthe’s debut as a feature film director and producer, LAST CALL, starring Travis Van Winkle, Ryan Hansen, Christopher Lloyd, Tara Reid, and Tom Arnold, was released in the summer of 2015 across multiple platforms on VOD and DVD.

As a child, she used to watch the Oscars, imagining one day telling a story that could matter on a global scale.

After a brief detour in the world of ballroom dance, Nonie ended up on a film set practically by accident. After pursuing acting for a few years, she found she kept writing stories in her head that she wished would be made. Realizing Hollywood would never read her mind, and finally believing her mother that “the world needs more feminist writers,” Nonie began writing.

Without seeing each other, without touching, bodies move to the rhythm of boredom. As dawn reaches its madness, they break the status quo and surrender to become one with the dream of a new day. STATU QUO is a hybrid short film created thanks to the exceptional participation of ten Montreal dancers who have performed, in front of our cameras, for the very first time since the Covid 19 pandemic began. In the streets of Montreal, they have improvised a dance, alone or together. This film is a testimony of the bonds that unite them and the common story written by their bodies. Without choreography or stage direction, this film questions and observes openly the body, hence alive, permanent and as an outlet. An infinite source of expression, the body becomes a militant and liberating tool which materializes our emotions beyond our common standards.\n\nFilmmaker Bios: Lamia Chraibi was born in France and raised in Morocco.

But that simply isn't true - it's happening right now, in slow motion, in everyday life, as our natural resources are depleted, and we continue to access each other through screens rather than actual contact. Thus, this video, composed entirely of cinemagraphs, shows one part of the image in motion, and the other part, frozen in time - a fixed point in an era of social, political and ecological collapse. These are memories - memories of a time when change was possible, when things could be rolled back. That's no longer possible now, as we view images of a time lost to authentic recall.\" - Wheeler Winston Dixon “Moments to remember are just like other moments.

A ritual for creating new worlds and situations for fragmented bodies, signals pass through the joints of animated and genderless bodies and body parts entangling the body-signal-actions both materially and conceptually as these control mechanisms interfere with pre-animated content. Perpetually shifting surfaces and skins serve as sites of projection and interference, contributing to the further \"queering\" of the state of these bodies and fragments that are stretched and submerged into and outside of the environment they inhabit, as they encounter desire, distress, and ritualized oscillations. Signals that generate sounds and compel movement, the making of the images, and the body, further challenges the stability and integrity of the space in its otherworldliness and the spatial relationships it establishes with the audience. At the edge between crisis and satisfaction, the work adopts the role of Millet's own \"gleaners,\" making-do on the boundary between sustenance and the devoid.\n\n​\n\nFilmmaker Bio: Benjamin Rosenthal (b.1984, New York, NY, Lives and Works in Kansas City, Missouri) holds an MFA in Art Studio from the University of California, Davis and a BFA in Art (Electronic Time-Based Media) from Carnegie Mellon University.

The close-ups, which excise context from the frame, suggest portraiture. We encounter these animals at eye level and observe them looking at us. Even without context, lawn sculptures are recognizably mass-produced and made of inexpensive yet robust material intended to endure outside. The male voiceover reads a monologue quilted with quotations from the western canon in which the author ventriloquizes an animal voice (i.e. Kafka, Rilke, Bishop, Tolstoy). The video offers a meditation on voyeurism and the performative quality of public-facing private displays, and on the desire to reintegrate animals into our life. The yard art animal sculptures are dinky monuments to that desire for reintegration. I gathered the footage in small towns across the Northeast, Midwest, and the South suggesting a collective place-less portrait of Americana.\n\n​\n\nFilmmaker Bio: Masha Vlasova is a video artist and educator.

A pretty urgent comedy.\n\nFilmmaker Bio: Brian Wallace, Matt Mitchell, and Justin Dray met while attending drama school at the O'Neill Center many years ago, and reunited when Brian relocated to L.A. in 2015. After shooting the short comedy The Briefcase, which screened at the inaugural We Make Movies International Film Festival in 2019, they formed Fancy Movies and shot three more films: Stay Green (WMM 2020), The Stone (WMM 2021), and most recently, Play On. Fancy Movies aims to create quality indie short films despite very limited budgets, and always under SAG-AFTRA agreements. Their projects have screened all over the world, and won awards and recognition at festivals in London, Japan, Florida, Portland, Los Angeles -- and even a nudist resort in Texas. So far, every project has been a comedy, with Brian serving as writer, Matt in charge of cinematography, and Justin providing both sound and most of the company's charm. Any and every other responsibility has had to be learned or figured out, from paperwork, to casting, to insurance, locations, marketing, lenses, and catering. Not to mention always having a plan for batteries. Two other films were in prep before the covid pandemic halted production. They had to figure that out too. Individually, each of the founders has appeared in outside projects, TV, and feature films. Justin can be seen in Get Lost, Zach Stone is Gonna Be Famous, Baskets, Ad Astra, and the recently released F.E.A.R.; Brian has appeared in the films Relish, The Zoo, the web series Bad Agent, and Elemental on Nat Geo; and Matt has been featured in The Good Samaritan, Alien Abduction, Cheaters: A Parody, and The Cave.\n\nCast: Miles Grose, Steve Gagliastro, Jack Merrill - Directors: Brain Wallace, Justin Dray, Matt Mitchell - Writer: Brain Wallace - Cinematographer: Matt Mitchell - Editors: Matt Mitchell, Brian Wallace\n\nThis Isn’t A Conversation is 6:08 minute video composed of one-line text pieces, found video footage, and music by Jon Algar. These semi-autobiographical texts are comprised of overheard conversations, found texts, fragments, diary entries, dreams, random thoughts, statements, pronouncements, and observations. Humour and misery are juxtaposed as a response to the current political climate, environmental catastrophe, narcissism, and misogyny. This video explores rage, complacency, loneliness, alienation, self-hate, depression, anxiety, discontent, confusion, empathy, fear, and feminism, and the messages are often offset with redirection, contradiction, absurdity, punch line, and surprise: If I put my head in the sand, / will you put your head in the sand? —Okay.\n\n​\n\nFilmmaker Bio: Kathryn Mockler is the author of five poetry books and several short films and experimental videos which have screened at over 60 festivals including the Toronto International Film Festival, Palm Springs International Festival, Chicago Underground Film Festival, Onion City: Experimental Film & Video Festival, ZEBRA Poetry Film Festival, and EMAF.

The collision of subjective aim with outer and inner restrictions raises a question about reality and potential. The confrontation takes place in a subliminally mystical vastness of nature – an infinite driving force of its own. In that solitude the character thrives until a point of change urges her to outgrow herself. A cave – meta level and consciousness – gives room for contemplation and progress. The movie is based on the V O I D EP by CORECASS (Elinor Lüdde) which was released by Golden Antenna Records in November 2020.\n\n​\n\nFilmmaker Bio: Elinor Lüdde is a musician, sound designer, composer and actor from Hamburg, Germany.

Alongside several releases and collaborations she scored and did sound design for the short film “Nemophelia” by Mirjam Dahl Pedersen in 2019, and a sound installation for the exhibition “I Don't Want It In My Body” by Barbara Lüdde and Corrina Goutos in Hamburg. Her latest record, V O I D, was released in November 2020 by Golden Antenna Records and also marks the basis of her debut as a filmmaker – the short film V O I D.\n\n​\n\nCast: Elinor Lüdde - Director: Elinor Lüdde - Writer: Elinor Lüdde - Cinematographer: Jeppe Nørholm Rohde - Editor: Jeppe Nørholm Rohde - Composer: Elinor Lüdde (CORECASS)\n\nA woman mourns the mysterious disappearance of her wife.\n\nFilmmaker Bio: Award winning Director and Cinematographer Daria Rountree found her passion in film at 5 years old while visiting her father on a film set. She fell in love with “movie magic,” began acting, and then picked up a camera to make her own films by the age of 12. Her films are known for their dark, psychological themes that make the audience feel like they are part of the story. Daria’s goal with her filmmaking is to create a true, understanding, and accepting culture around the lgbtq+ community and their experiences. By telling stories everyone can relate to as well as make them think and question themselves, she is hoping to remove the separation between “straight” and “gay” and show that we are all just complex humans.\n\nCast: Brit Landa, Taylor Carr, George Avalotus, Kire Horton - Director: Daria Rountree - Writer: Jordan Campbell - Cinematographer: Daria Rountree - Editor: Daria Rountree - Composer: Dylan Schweitzer\n\nHow much of our daily life is being controlled, led, or manipulated? Are our opinions, decisions, and actions our own or are they simply products that are co-created by the systems we live in? We think we know something until we find out that what we used to call our truth has already been prepared for us by a force that we have never questioned before. Where does the independence of our mind begin? And when has it been taken from us? Which harm do we cause to our society, nature, and the world by not questioning transparencies? Are we going to stay passive viewers – marionettes, or are we going to consciously create our now, so we can actively build a better future and become an influential part of history?\n\n​\n\nFilmmaker Bios: Dieter M.
