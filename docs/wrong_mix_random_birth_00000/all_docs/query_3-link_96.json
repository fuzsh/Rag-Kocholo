        "text": "Stevie Wonder is already one of the most beloved and respected musicians in history. At this point, the music he made will live on forever, and his legacy is secure. Thankfully, his work is still reaching new people and finding fans, and this week, one of the piano player’s songs becomes a Billboard charting hit for the first time—at least on a handful of rankings.\n\nThe legendary Wonder debuts a single on a pair of Billboard charts this week. The singer-songwriter’s “Someday at Christmas” makes its first appearance on two tallies as it finally receives the love on streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple AAPL Music that it has deserved for so long.\n\nOn the R&B/Hip-Hop Streaming Songs chart, “Someday at Christmas” debuts at No. 22. The tune breaks onto the list of the most-streamed tracks in America that are classified as R&B, hip-hop, or rap thanks to a surge in interest in holiday music. Usually, this list is completely dominated by current-day rappers and R&B superstars, leaving little room for legacy acts like Wonder.\n\nWonder has now placed just three tracks on the R&B/Hip-Hop Streaming Songs chart throughout his career. The list was introduced decades after his hits came and went, but his holiday fare has become popular enough from time to time to find a home. All three of Wonder’s wins on the tally are related to the yuletide season.\n\nOver on the R&B Streaming Songs chart—which drops all rap and hip-hop and focuses solely on R&B—Wonder also earns another smash. “Someday at Christmas” opens at No. 15 on that list. That may be last place on the truncated tally, but it’s still an important win for the musician.\n\nWonder has now scored a quartet of hit singles on the R&B Streaming Songs chart. In addition to his trio of Christmas cuts that have also landed on the R&B/Hip-Hop Streaming Songs ranking, his track “Superstition,” which may be his most recognizable smash, also once appeared on the roster as well.\n\nImpressively, “Someday at Christmas” isn’t Wonder’s only charting hit on the two aforementioned lists. He actually has another song that’s doing even better this time around. This frame, “What Christmas Means To Me” is up to No. 16 on the R&B/Hip-Hop Streaming Songs chart, and it’s a non-mover at No. 13 on the R&B Streaming Songs tally."
