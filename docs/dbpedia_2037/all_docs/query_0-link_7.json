        "text": "There may have been as much desperation as inspiration in Italy's deserved win in the World Cup semi-final. With the match goalless in the last minute of extra-time they faced the terrible prospect of a penalty shoot-out with Germany, for whom such occasions guarantee glory. Marcello Lippi's team averted that with a breakthrough that encapsulated the slight yet clear superiority they had enjoyed.\n\nJens Lehmann reached Andrea Pirlo's drive but from the corner the playmaker slipped a pass to Fabio Grosso and the full-back curled home a beautiful shot from the right with his left foot. In the seconds that were left Alessandro del Piero broke away to gather a pass from a fellow substitute, Alberto Gilardino, and add a second.\n\nItaly will now meet France or Portugal in Sunday's final in Berlin. They must do so with faith in themselves. Germany were tenacious and another side might have buckled in the face of that intensity. As it was, Italy needed luck after 81 minutes when the referee awarded a free-kick some 20 yards out for an offence that Fabio Cannavaro had committed on Lukas Podolski inside the area.\n\nEven so, Lippi's team had shown that the host nation's footballers had been functioning gloriously beyond their true level. Determination alone could not make the Germany players the equal of stars that Italy and others brought to the World Cup. It took a mixture of camaraderie, organisation and the urgings of home crowds to get them this far.\n\nWhile Germany have now lost an international in Dortmund for the first time, JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann's squad was still formidable in its desire and obstinacy.\n\nThere was a justice in Pirlo's key part in the victory, for he epitomised a gift for the sophisticated pass that is missing from Germany's repertoire. With the ever-competitive Gennaro Gattuso beside him, there was a nucleus that Klinsmann's line-up could not counter. Italy were confident, indifferent to the antagonism in the stands. Their 4-2-3-1 was particularly effective at releasing attackers on the flanks.\n\nAs early as the 11th minute there was an ominous slickness as Grosso went clear and Philipp Lahm had to get in front of Mauro Camoranesi to cover. There was space to be found behind the Germany back four and when Francesco Totti flighted a through ball five minutes later it was only an unsatisfactory touch by Simone Perrotta that let Lehmann block.\n\nGermany were more mechanical, with a bit of dash sacrificed through Klinsmann's decision that the deteriorating form of Bastian Schweinsteiger meant the left winger would not start. His replacement, the powerful Tim Borowski, hit a searching diagonal pass or two but could not carry the game to Italy.\n\nIf Germany had prevailed it would have been by exploiting the openings that came their way at irregular intervals. In the 105th and 112th minutes Lukas Podolski miscued a David Odonkor cross and then stretched Gianluigi Buffon to the limit. In the face of such incidents, though, Italy showed a strength of will.\n\nExtra-time had opened with Gilardino winding his way through before hitting a post and a couple of minutes later Gianluca Zambrotta clipped the top of the crossbar with a shot. Italy have been a disappointment in recent tournaments but there is now purpose and, so long as Pirlo is at work, order to their play.\n\nIt took all of that to earn this win. The German people, in the alchemy of a World Cup, had discovered scepticism being transmuted into faith. Before kick-off few would have disagreed that their side would have reached the final and revel in victory. Italy were in a situation that would have disheartened most others.\n\nIt needed two hours to part them from their faith that a way could be found to drag victory from this game. Germany kept an eye open for any counter-attacks; tempo and boldness were raised following the interval. Sebastian Kehl put one fine ball through for Miroslav Klose to go haring into the middle but Buffon saved.\n\nWhile Buffon is a contender for the title of goalkeeper of the tournament that had been the first noteworthy intervention by him. Germany had succeeded primarily in being abrasive and they accepted the price of that, with Borowski and Christoph Metzelder booked for tackles from behind before an hour had gone by.\n\nThis, of course, was a cup-tie and it was not obliged to be any more genteel because it took place in the greatest tournament of all. While Germany were not as polished, their passing had purpose. When Arne Friedrich slipped the ball in from the right in the 63rd minute, Podolski turned and shot but it was impossible to beat Buffon from so tight an angle. Where Argentina failed, however, a composed and strong-minded Italy succeeded in closing off all avenues to Germany."
