        "text": "Julian Brandt is the longest serving Borussia Dortmund player. Let that sink in a bit.\n\nLosing Mats Hummels once was hard enough; losing him twice has been unbearable. And that’s a comfort compared to the departure of Marco Reus. BVB has long relied on a trusted core of veterans, each replaced by the next old head to keep a sense of identity and continuity in the team. Kehl gave way to Sahin and Kagawa, who passed the torch to Schmelzer, then Piszczek, and finally Reus. Something about Julian Brandt just doesn’t inspire those same feelings of nostalgia—why is that?\n\nWell, Brandt is not from an era of Borussen success. Among the players mentioned were Bundesliga winners and World Cup Champions. Players with accolades in the Black and Yellow. In the minds of some fans, players who played for Klopp. Julian Brandt is an ambassador for one of the most challenging period in BVB history, the years of Bayern domination and uncertain leadership in Black and Yellow. Brandt arrived alongside Thorgan Hazard and Mats Hummels in the summer of 2019. BVB had just given Bayern their best challenge for the title in seven years, and fans were optimistic that with the proper reinforcements, another challenge would be on the cards. Attention was immediately on the controversial return of Mats Hummels, and the acquisition of Brandt was appreciated but maybe not lauded. A poor 2020/2021 season turned many fans against Brandt, who struggled to exert his influence on the pitch and had poor chemistry with his teammates when he was afforded minutes. But Brandt kept his head down, not shying away from the challenge of success at Borussia Dortmund.\n\nIt’s easy to overlook Julian Brandt in teams with Jude Bellingham, Gio Reyna, and Marco Reus. Brandt has regularly been shoved back to a number 8 position, shuffled out to the wings, or mashed and squished into roles he wasn’t designed for. Despite all his trials and tribulations, Brandt is coming off his third season with double-digit goals and assists, among Dortmund’s most prolific players. Brandt’s G/A numbers put him ahead of all those players listed, and Donyell Malen (and Karim Adeyemi, and Sebastien Haller), every season since 2021/2022.\n\nDortmund’s attack is in serious flux this offseason, and the one constant, finally, is Julian Brandt. Nuri Sahin has almost no choice but to build his attack around Brandt, knowing that the official new #10 will be critical to gel the pieces of a new-look midfield and forward line.\n\nSo Brandt will be important on the field, as he has been for the last three seasons. That’s not all it takes to be “that guy”, as they say. Can Brandt sell thousands of jerseys a year? Can he be the face next to the Borussia Dortmund logo on the halftime show of a Champion’s League match? Can he galvanize the youth of the Borussia Dortmund academy and Dortmund community to say “I want to play like Julian Brandt?”\n\nMaybe.\n\nThe club is certainly doing its bit to support the cause. Brandt has been front and center in Dortmund’s summer campaign, signing jerseys and taking selfies with fans during the Asia tour, and starring in plenty of BVB training camp videos. His cool, steady persona is a lot like that of Marco Reus, and he has clearly matured into the responsibility the club expects him to shoulder. Tossing Brandt the #10 jersey was a definite sign of good faith.\n\nPart of me feels like Brandt is too blue-flame to be the face of Borussia Dortmund. But Marco Reus was the same way. Maybe it’s denial; there is no player in this side or in football who can “replace” Marco Reus for Borussia Dortmund. Reus has been the face of this club as long as I have supported it, and he was the reason I started following the club in the first place. But Brandt has all the talent, class, and leadership ability to be the face of this club, and the time is right for him to do it. This is going to be Julian Brandt’s Borussia Dortmund—let’s get behind it."
