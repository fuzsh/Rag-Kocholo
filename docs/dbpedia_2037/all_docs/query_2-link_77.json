        "text": "A highly successful era is drawing to a close, but another is set to begin next summer. Michael Zorc, 58, who has spent a total of 43 years with BVB as a player and member of the sporting management, will be succeeded as sporting director by Sebastian Kehl, 41, on 1 July 2022. Kehl today signed a contract until 30 June 2025.\n\nAside from a brief spell away that he devoted to his studies, among other things, Kehl has been a Black & Yellow for almost 20 years. He lifted the Bundesliga title in 2002, 2011 and 2012, and won the double as well. After hanging up his boots in the summer of 2015, the long-term team captain completed a management course with UEFA and acquired his A Licence as a coach. Since the beginning of the 2018/29 season, he has been the head of Borussia Dortmund’s players department. Twelve months from now, the former international and 2002 World Cup runner-up will take over all of Michael Zorc’s present responsibilities.\n\n“I am happy that we have once again succeeded in keeping a deserved title-winner at the club on a long-term basis beyond the end of his playing career. Sebastian Kehl has done a good job in recent years and has already commenced preparations for his future role as BVB’s sporting director. Of course, he has big shoes to fill, but we are convinced that Sebastian has what it takes to do the job,” explained Borussia Dortmund’s chief executive officer Hans-Joachim Watzke.\n\n“The working relationship between Sebastian Kehl and myself has been shaped by great trust from day one,” Michael Zorc declared, before adding, “Sebastian has become gradually involved in all the relevant fields of a sporting director. I greatly value his work. The fact that the management has now decided to make him my successor in the summer of 2022 is, in my view, a sensible and logical decision. I’m already looking forward to working together in my final year as BVB’s sporting director.”\n\n“I have felt very closely connected to this great club for almost 20 years now and am proud to be given the opportunity to shape the sporting future of Borussia Dortmund in a position of responsibility starting from 2022,” said Sebastian Kehl. “As a sporting director, creating the conditions for BVB to continue being successful in the future is both a challenge and an obligation for me,” he added. “I would like to thank those responsible – especially Hans-Joachim Watzke and Michael Zorc – for their trust. For now, though, I’m looking forward to working with Michael on our present goals and on current matters and challenges.”\n\n(Borussia Dortmund)"
