        "text": "OFFICIAL: 35-year-old Mats Hummels leaves Dortmund.\n\nBorussia Dortmund and central defender Mats Hummels (35) will part ways after a total of more than 13 years of successful collaboration. This is the result of a conversation held this week between BVB Sports Director Lars Ricken, Sports Director Sebastian Kehl and Mats Hummels.\n\n\"Dear fans, my time in black and yellow is now coming to an end after a total of more than 13 years. It was a huge honour and joy for me to have played for BVB for so long and to have been part of the journey from 13th place in January 2008 to what Borussia Dortmund represents today. This club and its fans are something very special - and for me much more than that,\" says Mats Hummels, adding: \"I would also like to thank all BVB employees who do great work for this club and of course the countless great coaches and fantastic teammates that I have had the pleasure of meeting here. I keep my fingers crossed that you will all meet up again at Borsigplatz as soon as possible to celebrate. Until then, I will be cheering from afar and hopefully also in the stadium from time to time. I will miss you.â\n\nBorussia Dortmundâs sports director, Lars Ricken, emphasises: âMats was one of the key figures in BVB football over the past 15 years. He won many titles, and his personal highlight was certainly the World Cup triumph in 2014. Matsâs play as a centre-back was and is exceptional; entire generations of players would love to have his outside foot. Now our paths are parting and it is without a doubt never easy for everyone involved to make such decisions. Mats will forever be part of BVBâs history books. We owe this player a lot, and Mats also owes this extraordinary club a lot. We wish him all the best for his future.â\n\nBVB sports director Sebastian Kehl says: âWithout a doubt, we are losing an outstanding personality in Mats Hummels, perhaps one of the last of his kind in football. During his career, Mats not only shaped BVB, but also raised the central defender game worldwide to a new level. He won titles with us, not least the first double in our club's history. In addition, Mats is a real guy who always challenges himself and others. I thank Mats for his passion, for his will to succeed, and also for his rough edges. Everyone at BVB wishes him all the best for his sporting and private future. Personally, I will always remain close to Mats, whom I have valued very much for many, many years.\""
