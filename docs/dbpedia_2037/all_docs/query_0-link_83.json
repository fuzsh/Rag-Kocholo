Financial sustainability: The introduction of a regulator will ensure closer monitoring and higher standards of reporting. Clubs will be required to ensure they have reserves and plans to ensure they can maintain the business in the instance of financial shocks.\n\n2.Suitability of owners: Directors and club owners will be more closely vetted for propriety and there will be commensurate licensing conditions to ensure higher standards. This will also affect the over-gearing of buy-outs and unsustainable debt levels.\n\n3. Fan engagement: Clubs will be required to consult with fans and there will be minimum standards of engagement including fans having a say, a veto over changes to historically important aspects of the club such as colours, badge and kit colours and geographic location.\n\n4. Breakaway leagues: The white paper aims to protect the football pyramid in the English game and exclude 'closed shop' type leagues like the proposed 'European Super League'.\n\n5. Financial distribution: The white paper aims to ensure a fairer distribution of income across the clubs in the English football pyramid and give power to the regulator to impose workable solutions on the clubs.\n\n6. Compliance/sanctions: The regulator will have the power to take action including withdraw licences from clubs ignoring breaches of conditions of licensing.\n\nThe regulator will cover 116 clubs in the top five tiers: The Premier League, The Championship, League 1, League 2 and the National League of the English professional game.\n\nA second part to the podcast series on the governance of German football will appear here shortly.\n\nThe football match to raise money for the DEC British Red Cross Earthquake Appeal 2023 which is mentioned takes place on Tuesday 7th March at 3pm at the Linford Christie Stadium, White City.
