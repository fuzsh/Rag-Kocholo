        "text": "Former England striker Gary Lineker once famously quipped that soccer was a \"simple\" game: \"Twenty-two men chase a ball for 90 minutes and in the end — the Germans win.\"\n\nLineker made the remark just after England suffered a heartbreaking penalty shootout loss to Germany in the semifinals of the 1990 World Cup.He was making the point that the German team cannever be discounted.\n\nUntil recently, the statistics would have backed up Lineker's joke. Germany appeared in three straight World Cup finals from1982-90, played in a record seven World Cup finals (winning three) and won more European championships (three) than any other nation. It has racked up 50 career World Cup victories, ranking second only to Brazil, which has won 60 games and five World Cup titles.\n\nBut despite a proven track record of success, most soccer pundits aren't expecting Die Nationalelf — the \"National 11\" — to bring home a fourth World Cup crown in 2006.\n\nThe German team no longer evokes thefear and respect it once did. Germany is in transition,evencrisis — and most critics are pointing the finger straight at its coach,former national team icon Jurgen Klinsmann.\n\nKlinsmann,who was one of Germany's greatest players, scored 11 goals in 17 games at the 1990 World Cup and led his country to the title.\n\nBut that hasn't counted for much since he took over the team two years ago.\n\nGermany has lost its way since it lost to Brazil in the 2002 World Cup finals, crashing out of the opening round at Euro 2004, registering only a handful of wins in international play and dropping to an unimaginable 19th in the current FIFA world rankings.\n\nThe team's reputation has taken a further beatingover the last few months, a fact underscored by Germany's humiliating 4-1 loss to Italy in an exhibition game in March.\n\nSuch was the outrage after the mauling by the Italians that it prompted some German lawmakers to demand Klinsmann appear before parliament to explain how he plans to win the country's fourth world title with his struggling squad.\n\nCritics question team selections\n\nKlinsmann's selections and tactics havebeen second-guessed by the media and German soccer officials ever since he took over the team two years ago.\n\nAside from a few veteran players, Germany's World Cup team is mostly comprised of younger players. Many of them are unproven and will be playing at a major international tournament for the first time at the 2006 World Cup.\n\nIn a bit of a surprise, Klinsmann selected Jens Nowotny despite the defender's near two-year absence from international soccer.Midfielder David Odonkor was another surprise pick, as the 22-year-old winger has yet to play a game for Germany.\n\nNotable absentees include winger Sebastian Deisler (effectively replaced by Odonkor), striker Kevin Kuranyi, midfielder Fabian Ernst and fullback Patrick Owomoyela.\n\nThe omission of Kuranyi was seen as especially questionable because Klinsmann selected striker Mike Hanke, who will have to miss the first two games of the tournament due to suspension.\n\nSeveral players are also just getting over injuries: striker Lukas Podolski (back), midfielder Sebastian Kehl (ankle), central defender Christoph Metzelder (calf muscle) and left fullback Philipp Lahm (torn elbow ligaments).\n\n4-4-2 formation draws fire\n\nKlinsmann has also tied himself to using a traditional 4-4-2 formation, leading critics to say hisinflexibility in the matter had madeGermany limp and predictable.\n\nThe Germans suffer from a dearth of midfield creators. Because so much of their attack relies on playmaking midfielder Michael Ballack, teams canfocus all their defensive attention on him to effectively shut the team down.\n\nWhat's more, Klinsmann has been hounded by German soccer officials, the media and fans for his decision to split his time between his homeland and California, where he lives with his family.\n\nFranz Beckenbauer, Germany's 1974 World Cup winning captain, has been vocal in his criticism of Klinsmann's and his team selections.\n\n\"The coach of the host country has to be there — that is beyond question. If I have to think about this anymore my choice of words would be more drastic,\" said Beckenbauer, Germany's most influential soccer figure.\n\nPele defends Klinsmann\n\nAlthough Klinsmann appears to have few friends in Germany, one man who has publicly backed the coach is Brazilian icon Pele.\n\n\"He is doing a good job,\" Pele told the German television channel ZDF. \"I have spoken with him a few times and chatted with Beckenbauer about Klinsmann.\n\n\"Some people don't like the fact that he has changed a lot. I think some people in Germany have a problem with the new developments over the past two years.\n\n\"But I think he is doing well. Klinsmann gives the team a lot of self-confidence.\"\n\nTo say the German national team is carrying the weight of expectations of an entire nation on its shoulders is a mild understatement.\n\nAll eyes will be on the hosts as they seek to dispel the notion that their best days are behind them and that they are living off the memories of past glories."
