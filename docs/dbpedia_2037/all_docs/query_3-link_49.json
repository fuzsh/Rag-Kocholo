        "text": "Sport Bild reports that Borussia Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke is to hand over the majority of his responsibilities in the summer ahead of the end of his contract in 2025.\n\nWho will replace the long-term CEO is unknown, but it seems like current Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl will take over the role. However, Eintracht Frankfurt sporting director Markus Krösche is the biggest challenger to Kehl for the role.\n\nKrösche was previously an option for Dortmund to take over from Michael Zorc in 2022, but they opted for former Dortmund midfielder Kehl.\n\nKehl is currently in pole position for the role but if Dortmund decide to seriously pursue the Frankfurt director, It is not out of the question that Krösche could join Dortmund as his contract expires in 2025 and he has yet to sign an extension despite being of interest to several clubs abroad.\n\nIt is said that Krösche wants to win titles and be represented in the Champions League every year, which at the moment is not a goal that can be achieved at Frankfurt."
