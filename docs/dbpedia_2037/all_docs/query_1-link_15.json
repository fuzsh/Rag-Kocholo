        "text": "The cliché\n\nEfficient and disciplined. You can never write off the Germans.\n\nThe reality\n\nGerman invincibility has taken a pounding in the past five years, with England, Romania and Italy all handing out the sort of thrashings that would have been inconceivable in the past. A shortage of talent means heavy reliance on Michael Ballack and the team have tried 14 different defenders in the past 18 months without improvement. Still as they showed in Korea/Japan you can, er, never write them off.\n\nWhere they're staying\n\nSchloss Hotel im Grunewald. A luxurious Berlin mansion recently renovated under the supervision of pony-tailed fashion guru Karl Lagerfeld. As well as the usual delights, the Schloss boasts a \"technology butler\" - surely enough on its own to distract the boys from Berlin's prodigious club scene.\n\nGrudge match\n\nFrank Rijkaard's spit dribbling from Rudi Völler's bubble perm and Ronald Koeman claiming to have wiped his bum with Olaf Thon's shirt has fuelled a sense of German grievance with Holland.\n\nThe politics\n\nOliver Kahn and Jens Lehmann are locked in a ferocious battle of egos and have not attended squad sessions together for more than a year because of fears that they would poison the atmosphere. Now Lehmann is first choice, Kahn claims he \"will not wish him an injury or red card\". Yeah, right.\n\nSupported by\n\nThousands of men with big moustaches dressed in denim waistcoats covered in club patches and badges will lend a Status Quo concert air to games.\n\nSlogan on team coach\n\n\"We are football\"\n\nThe coach: Jürgen Klinsmann\n\nOn his chalkboard\n\nJürgen Klinsmann has brought a New Age approach to coaching Germany with psychological training, a laid-back attitude to discipline and some US fitness coaches who he claims will increase the team's stamina by 30%. The former Spurs striker emphasises \"positivity\". Just as well, because the defence is a shambles.\n\nIn his closet\n\nKlinsi once threatened to quit playing in protest at environmental damage. He now commutes by aeroplane from California.\n\nThe players\n\nMost likely to move to Bolton\n\nBernd Schneider. The John Hegley look-alike from Bayer Leverkusen has the midfield skills and, at 32, the heavy legs to find favour with those Trotters still pining for the days when Fredi Bobic saved them from relegation.\n\nOscar nominee\n\nMichael Ballack normally tops the poll of Schwalbenkonig (diving-kings) though, when Franz Beckenbauer said play-actors ruined the Bundesliga, he didn't mention the Bayern Munich star. Odd that.\n\nKing of the endorsements\n\nKahn is top man thanks to a major deal with Burger King and TV adverts for the Paulaner Brewery that see him supping a vast flagon of lager in a Munich beer garden, but Lukas Podolski is catching up thanks to his hunky appearance in a deodorant ad.\n\nYou'll be copying . . .\n\nThe salmon-like leaping of Miroslav Klose, who out jumps defenders as if he's on a pogo stick and then skies his header over the bar.\n\nNation sweating on\n\nSebastian Kehl is hardly a household name, possibly not even in his own gaff, but Germans, having already lost the luckless Sebastian Diesler, will be hoping he recovers from an ankle injury.\n\nRooney to have a grand on\n\nSuperfast midfielder David Odonkor outsprinting Theo Walcott over 100m (his PB for the distance is 10.9sec).\n\nIf they were shoes . . . Hush Puppies\n\nSolid, dependable, robust. They rarely set the pulse racing though you have to admire that they've been an ever-present on the big stage since we were kids. They'll be feeling nice and comfy at home this summer\n\nThe stats\n\nFifa ranking 19th Odds to win 8-1\n\nWorld Cup finals record P85 W53 D15 L17 F176 A106\n\nWorld Cup best Winners 1954, '74, '90\n\nLast 12 matches W5 D3 L4\n\nGroup fixtures\n\nCosta Rica June 9, Munich 5pm\n\nPoland June 14, Dortmund 8pm\n\nEcuador June 20, Berlin 3pm\n\nThe country\n\nOn the psychiatrist's couch\n\n\"I took several centuries to pull myself together and establish my own identity. When I was young I was influenced by totally the wrong sort of people. I got into a lot of fights and I did some terrible things. I've calmed down since but it's not always easy when people whistle The Great Escape at you all the time.\"\n\nWhat they eat\n\nSausages, of course. Germany is home to more than 150 varieties of wurst made from just about every part of an animal you can imagine - and some you'd probably rather not.\n\nWhat they watch\n\nSoap opera Gute Zeiten Schlechte Zeiten (Good Times and Bad Times) regularly attracts 40% of the viewing share and helped launch the pop career of Jeanette Biedermann - the German Britney.\n\nAnthem in brief\n\nThe Germans praise German wine, women and songs and vow to keep them safe and happy even if it means lining river banks with their arms linked.\n\nWell I never\n\nWith 60,000 registered naturists and 160 \"free body culture\" clubs, Germany can justifiably claim to be the nudist capital of the world. Neanderthal man came from just outside Düsseldorf.\n\nThe squad\n\nGoalkeepers\n\nJens Lehmann 1\n\nArsenal, England\n\nAge 36, 30 caps\n\nOliver Kahn 12\n\nBayern Munich\n\n36, 85 caps\n\nTimo Hildebrand 23\n\nVfB Stuttgart\n\n27, 3 caps\n\nDefenders\n\nMarcell Jansen 2\n\nBorussia M'gladbach\n\n20, 5 caps\n\nArne Friedrich 3\n\nHertha Berlin\n\n27, 35 caps\n\nRobert Huth 4\n\nChelsea, England\n\n21, 16 caps\n\nJens Nowotny 6\n\nBayer Leverkusen\n\n32, 45 caps\n\nPhilipp Lahm 16\n\nBayern Munich\n\n22, 17 caps\n\nPer Mertesacker 17\n\nHanover\n\n21, 21 caps\n\nChristoph Metzelder 21\n\nBorussia Dortmund\n\n25, 20 caps\n\nMidfielders\n\nSebastian Kehl 5\n\nBorussia Dortmund\n\n26, 26 caps\n\nBastian Schweinsteiger 7\n\nBayern Munich\n\n21, 26 caps\n\nTorsten Frings 8\n\nWerder Bremen\n\n29, 50 caps\n\nMichael Ballack 13\n\nChelsea, England\n\n29, 63 caps\n\nThomas Hitzlsperger 15\n\nVfB Stuttgart\n\n24, 14 caps\n\nTim Borowski 18\n\nWerder Bremen\n\n26, 18 caps\n\nBernd Schneider 19\n\nBayer Leverkusen\n\n32, 62 caps\n\nDavid Odonkor 22\n\nBorussia Dortmund\n\n22, 0 caps\n\nForwards\n\nMike Hanke 9\n\nVfL Wolfsburg\n\n22, 6 caps\n\nOliver Neuville 10\n\nBorussia M'gladbach\n\n33, 53 caps\n\nMiroslav Klose 11\n\nWerder Bremen\n\n27, 53 caps\n\nGerald Asamoah 14\n\nSchalke 04\n\n27, 39 caps"
