        "text": "The German football player Sebastian Walter Kehl is a defensive midfielder who plays for Borussia Dortmund. Since 2008 he has worn captainâs armband of the Black Yellows. Sebastian was born in a German city Fulda, the state of Hesse.\n\nKehl began climbing the football Olympus, entering the Lahrbach (Tann) youth system. At the age of 14 the future footballer became a trainee of Borussia Fulda academy, from where he moved to his first professional club Hannover 96 when 18 years old. Sebastian played 32 games and scored two goals for the Reds and then in 2000 transferred to SCÂ Freiburg.\n\nThe midfielder joined Borussia Dortmund in the middle of the 2001/02 season, at the same time rejecting an offer from Bayern Munich. He missed the first half of the 2006/07season due to a knee surgery in the summer of 2006, appearing on the pitch only on the 4 FebruaryÂ 2007.\n\nKehl has played 213 matches and netted 19 goals for the club until now. As a Borussia player, Sebastian has won the Bundesliga three times, and at the end of the 2011/12 he won his first DFB Cup. (The footballer spent all 90 minutes on the pitch and Borussia won BayernÂ 5-2).\n\nSebastian played his first match for the national team against Slovakia on 29 May 2001. The game took place in Bremen and Kehl substituted Marko Rehmer during the halftime helping his team to win 2-0. Being part of the Bundesteam, he participated in two World Cups: in 2002 his team finished as the runner-up and in 2006 they won the bronzeÂ medal.\n\nIn 2004 Kehl took part in the UEFA European Football Championship that was held in Portugal, but the Germans didnât manage to get into theÂ play-offs.\n\nThe footballer became famous on the Internet due to a hyper-ludicrous incident that took place on 29 January 2005. Borussia Dortmund was playing a home match against Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach, when in the middle of the game the opposing midfielder Peer Kluge, challenging for the ball with Sebastian Kehl, grabbed his shorts and pulled them accidentally to reveal SebastianâsÂ genitals."
