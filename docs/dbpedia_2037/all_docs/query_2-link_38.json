        "text": "Today is the birthday of Thomas Muller ,one of the most extraordinary footballers of all time. A world cup and Champions league winner, the Bayern Munich and Germany legend is a one of kind footballer who thrives on sheer footballing IQ by exploiting space. He is not a striker or a winger or even a midfielder. In his own words, he is a \"Raumdeuter\" or interpreter of space. In a world where people look for core competencies and specializations, Muller is a misfit. His core competency is that he has none. Thomas Muller can't beat you with his dribbling, he can't beat you with his speed, he can't beat you with close ball control or physicality. He just beats you. Despite his huge success for both club and country, he remains the affable Bavarian boy. In an era where changing clubs is the norm, he has remained at Bayern Munich for the last 14 years. He is the quintessential team player and a great leader. His success is also a testament of the flexibility of his coaches who let him play freely without shackling him in one position thereby stifling his creativity. Roles are clearly defined in organizations for clarity ,efficiency and effectiveness. However, one may encounter talented people who cannot be assigned a definite role within the extant setup. They may seem to have no specific skillset but the whole would be greater than the sum of the parts. Rather than sideline them because it is difficult to fit them in a definite role, giving them a chance, even if means tweaking the system, may prove beneficial in the end. Wishing Thomas Muller more success in football and beyond. .May his tribe of magnificent misfits increase.. #ThomasMuller #flexibility #rolesandresponsibilities\n\nüñ§üíõ Why Unity Makes Borussia Dortmund (and Your Company) Unstoppable üñ§üíõ As a die-hard Borussia Dortmund fan, I've witnessed firsthand how the team's unity can turn the tide of even the toughest matches. But beyond the football pitch, there's a valuable lesson to be learned about the power of unity within any organization. When Dortmund gets on a roll, they become an unstoppable force. It's not just about individual talent; it's about the cohesion of the team, the synchronicity of every player working towards a common goal. Take, for instance, their recent triumphs in the Champions League. Despite stumbling in the first legs against formidable opponents, they rallied, fueled by the unwavering support of their fans and a deep-seated sense of togetherness. This unity isn't just about chemistry; it's about trust, communication, and a shared commitment to excellence. Dortmund has shown that when every player knows their role and supports each other both on and off the field, they can overcome any obstacle. It's this sense of camaraderie that enables them to capitalize on even the smallest opportunities and emerge victorious. The parallels between Dortmund's success and the dynamics of a thriving company are striking. Just as a football team must work together seamlessly to achieve victory, a company must foster a culture of unity to reach its full potential. When employees feel connected, valued, and aligned with the company's mission, they become more engaged, innovative, and resilient in the face of challenges. So, whether you're cheering on Borussia Dortmund or leading a team in the boardroom, remember the power of unity. It's not just a buzzword; it's the secret ingredient to achieving greatness. Let's harness the spirit of Dortmund and build something extraordinary together. #bvb #unity #communication\n\nüåü Remembering Franz Beckenbauer: \"Der Kaiser\" \"The emperor\"üåü Today, we pay tribute to the legendary Franz Beckenbauer, whose influence on the beautiful game transcended generations. Known for his versatility, technical prowess, and leadership, Beckenbauer left an indelible mark on both the German national team and Bayern Munich. As a central defender, he seamlessly blended defensive solidity with remarkable ball control, vision, and passing ability. His adaptability on the field set him apart, making him a key figure in orchestrating plays from the back. Beckenbauer's success was not just about skills on the pitch but also his innate leadership qualities. Captaining both the West German national team and Bayern Munich, he guided his teams to numerous victories, showcasing a natural ability to inspire and lead. His football intelligence was unparalleled. Beckenbauer could read the game, anticipate opponents' moves, and strategically position himself‚Äîa testament to his deep understanding of football dynamics. The legacy of \"Der Kaiser\" extends beyond his playing days. Achieving success as both a player and a manager, he secured victories in the 1990 FIFA World Cup as a manager, completing a remarkable double. Today, we remember Franz Beckenbauer not just for his extensive list of achievements but for the enduring impact he had on the sport we all love. His contributions to football will forever be etched in history. What we can learn from him... 1)Versatility: Develop a broad skill set to adapt to different challenges and situations. 2)Leadership: Embrace leadership opportunities, inspiring and guiding others toward common goals. 3)Technical Excellence: Strive for excellence in your chosen field, continuously improving and mastering your skills. 4)Adaptability: Be adaptable in the face of change, demonstrating flexibility and resilience. Strategic Thinking: Cultivate strategic thinking by understanding the bigger picture and making informed decisions. 5)Deep Understanding: Gain a profound understanding of your environment or industry, allowing you to navigate complexities with insight. 6)Diversification of Skills: Consider diversifying your skills to contribute to your field in various capacities. 7)Perseverance: Overcome challenges with resilience, viewing setbacks as opportunities for growth. 8)Teamwork: Value collaboration and teamwork, recognizing that collective achievements often lead to success. 9)Legacy Building: Reflect on the impact you want to leave in your professional and personal endeavors. Rest in peace, legend. ‚öΩüôè #FranzBeckenbauer #FootballLegend\n\nYesterday I wondered once more: \"Why am I a football fan and, of all teams, a member of VfL Bochum, a team that usually fights to avoid relegation?\" Maybe it goes back to when I was 8 years old, won second place in a drawing competition, and got to walk onto the pitch with captain Darius Wosz at a game against Bayern Munich in front of 45 thousand people... Yesterday, I experienced another unforgettable moment. After a 0-3 home loss to Fortuna D√ºsseldorf, the odds were against us. Everything was set up in D√ºsseldorf for a huge party, Campino, lead singer of die Toten Hosen and a huge D√ºsseldorf fan himself said prior to the game that \"it feels like Christmas and Easter on one day\". But Bochum did the impossible: equalizing in the second leg, going into extra time, and finally winning in a penalty shootout - one of the biggest comebacks in German professional football history. Our goalkeeper Andreas Luthe ended his career as a hero. Chatting with colleagues over lunch today, I realized just how excited I still was by what happened. The game really showed how important mental strength and coaching are. These qualities matter just as much in the business world. There is certainly many more important things in this world than football. And yet, a sport like this connects and provides joy to so many people in such a unique way. This passion and dedication are mirrored in our professional challenges. Mental fitness and coaching can turn seemingly impossible situations into successes. Here's to extraordinary comebacks and believers ü§ç üíô ..! photo credit: Reuters #coaching #mentalfitness #comeback #vflbochum VfL Bochum 1848 GmbH & Co. KGaA\n\nInvestigating the Core of Football: An Excursion Through Bundesliga Welcome to the elating universe of Bundesliga, where enthusiasm, ability, and commitment join on the football pitch. Bundesliga, the top-level football association in Germany, isn't simply a contest; a social peculiarity enthralls a huge number of fans around the world. In this blog entry, we'll dig into the rich history, lively climate, and enamoring ongoing interaction that characterize Bundesliga. History of Bundesliga: Bundesliga follows its foundations back to 1963 when it was established determined to make an expert football association in Germany. From that point forward, it has developed into one of the most lofty and cutthroat football associations internationally, including prestigious clubs like Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, and RB Leipzig. The Bundesliga plays had a crucial impact in molding the scene of European football, delivering top notch ability and exciting experiences that keep fans as eager and anxious as can be. Enthusiasm and Climate: One of the most striking parts of Bundesliga is the jolting climate that inundates arenas on match days. Whether it's the notable Yellow Wall at Borussia Dortmund's Sign Iduna Park or the ocean of red at Bayern Munich's Allianz Field, the enthusiasm and energy of Bundesliga fans are unmatched. The serenades, banners, and movements make an extraordinary mood, transforming each match into an exhibition. The Bundesliga isn't just about football; it's a festival of local area, custom, and shared love for the wonderful game. read more....https://shorturl.at/nDLM5\n\nPlayers from United Soccer League (USL) in Germany! Over the years I transferred many dozen of players from Major League Soccer, United Soccer League (USL) or Canadian Premier League to Germany. In DFB we have the three federal pro leagues: Bundesliga 1, 2 and 3. Liga (~56 teams) and five leagues in 4th tier/division Regionalliga S√ºdwest, West, Nord, North-East and Bavaria (~90 teams). Within all of those levels from Bundesliga down to Regionalliga (most U23/21 teams of the top teams play there) I signed and/or transferred many North American players. If a player or club approaches me about a move to Germany we do our research about the player and then (like it or not üòâ) tell them our honest opinion. Important for a successful career or transfer is to find the right environment for the player. With environment I mean the level, the setup of the club, the team, the technical staff, our experience with the interested clubs, the mind set of the player, his goals, the goals of the club, the chances/opportunities, etc. etc.etc‚Ä¶ A lot of people in pro soccer not really knowing the German pro market react to our assessments with something like this: ‚Äû‚Ä¶but he/I can play on a higher level‚Ä¶‚Äú. We then explain how important a (good/impressive) start is for any international coming first time to Germany and especially if the plan of the player or ‚Äûselling‚Äú club in North America is a longer career/higher ‚Äûrevenue‚Äú (i.e. participation on future transfers, etc.) in the UEFA /DFB pro world. A lot of clubs / players just focus on getting to Europe, making a/any transfer fee, etc. but do not see the opportunities, risks, downsides, etc. if a wrong /risky decision is made. The publishing /articles of clubs making a transfer (fee) to Europe is often euphoric when it happens and we understand that, but don‚Äôt forget about year two, three, four, etc. We established a data base about United Soccer League (USL), Major League Soccer or Canadian Premier League Players who signed or got transferred to Germany to see if and how their career progressed. I am sure pro leagues or clubs in North America also track their transfers/‚Äúsales‚Äù to Europe to see if they made the right decision, worked with the right people, clubs, etc. and what could have been better and (!) how their / his decision influenced the career of their/the player‚Ä¶. To round up my small post (‚ÄúPlayers from United Soccer League (USL) in Germany!‚Äù) I just read an article about the German club Greifswalder FC (Toni Kroos & Felix Kroos started their career at this club) and I happend to sign two players from United Soccer League (USL) with Greifswalder FC and David Wagner and Lars Fuchs. https://lnkd.in/ezS4Cu_n\n\nShattering Stereotypes: The Evolution of Japanese Footballers in European Soccer In the not-so-distant past, Japanese football players were considered an anomaly in European soccer circles. They were often brushed aside due to their perceived lack of stature and physical prowess needed to thrive in the highly competitive leagues of the continent. However, the passage of time has witnessed a remarkable transformation in the perception of Japanese footballers, as they have not only dispelled these stereotypes but also established themselves as integral components of European football. This paradigm shift underscores the unfounded nature of earlier stereotypes. A cadre of Japanese players deserves recognition for spearheading this transformation and altering the narrative surrounding the suitability of their compatriots for European football. Pioneers such as Hidetoshi Nakata, Shunsuke Nakamura, Junichi Inamoto, and Shinji Ono paved the way for future generations, contributing significantly to this monumental change. Presently, the presence of Japanese players in European football is more conspicuous than ever before. They have dispersed across various European countries, representing a plethora of clubs. Distinguished clubs such as Liverpool, Arsenal, Lazio, Sporting CP, Feyenoord, Brighton, Monaco, Real Sociedad, Eintracht Frankfurt, Club Brugge, Celtic, Borussia M√∂nchengladbach, AZ Alkmaar, Stade Reims, Stuttgart, Freiburg, Standard Li√®ge, Toulouse, Gent, Bochum, Dinamo Zagreb, Sparta Rotterdam, Grasshopper, Augsburg, Union SG, Schalke, Br√∏ndby, and Hearts have enthusiastically embraced Japanese talent. What is particularly noteworthy is that it's not just the established players who are making waves. Young Japanese talents are now leaving their mark in the reserves or academies of prestigious clubs. The likes of Pipi Nakai (Real Madrid), Niko Takahashi (Barcelona), Leo Kokubo (Benfica), and Taichi Fukui (Bayern) serve as testament to the burgeoning reservoir of Japanese potential. Soccer clubs are more interconnected than ever before, enabling them to identify and recruit talent from all corners of the globe, including Japan. Furthermore, credit is due to the A League, Japan's premier football division. Its open system, which incorporates relegation and promotion, has injected a competitive edge into Japanese football. This not only prepares players for the challenges of European football but also elevates the overall standard of training and development. It‚Äôs also great to have watch. The evolution of Japanese players in European football serves as a compelling example of how stereotypes can be dismantled through a combination of talent, determination, and opportunity. The presence of Japanese players in top European leagues is no longer an anomaly but rather a testament to the global character of the beautiful game and the boundless potential of athletes from diverse backgrounds üáØüáµ ‚ù§Ô∏è‚öΩÔ∏è\n\nFrom Neverkusen to the Invincibles: Leverkusen's historic quest for a perfect season As Bayer 04 Leverkusen approaches the end of an unprecedented season, CEO Fernando Carro de Prada's strategic influence is profoundly evident. Leverkusen stands on the brink of becoming the first team in modern European football to finish an entire season undefeated in all competitions. Under the guidance of former industrial engineer Carro, and the tactical acumen of manager Xabi Alonso, Leverkusen's transformation from \"Neverkusen\" to \"The Invincibles\" is nothing short of remarkable. 1: How has Fernando Carro contributed to Leverkusen's success? Fernando Carro has brought a corporate-driven ethos to the club, leveraging his extensive management experience to enhance its competitiveness. His leadership is marked by a push for higher standards and strategic shifts at key positions within the club. 2: What has been the impact of manager Xabi Alonso on the team? Xabi Alonso, in his first managerial role, has been pivotal in Leverkusen's outstanding performance. His clear tactical plans and adaptability have turned the team's fortunes around, from battling relegation concerns to chasing historical success. 3: How does Bayer AG‚Äôs ownership influence Leverkusen? Owned entirely by Bayer AG, Leverkusen benefits from the financial and structural support of the pharmaceutical giant, which has been crucial, especially during financially turbulent times. However, this relationship has also attracted scrutiny and criticism regarding the fairness of corporate ownership in football. 4: What are Leverkusen‚Äôs future ambitions under Carro's leadership? Looking ahead, Carro aims to solidify Leverkusen's status among Europe's top clubs and leverage their success to boost the Bayer brand globally. Sustainable growth, international expansion, and social responsibility remain key facets of their strategy. #SportsBusiness #Football #SportsBiz #Finance #People #Data #Intelligence\n\nüîé ‚¨á ‚≠ê FLORIAN WIRTZ: A FREE SOUL CONDUCTING THE ASPIRIN ORCHESTRA. Today, following my Leverkusen series of posts, I will focus my attention on one of the players in vogue within European football. This 23-24 season, Florian Wirtz is finally submitting his candidacy to become one of the best players in Europe. He has always been a very promising footballer. He had also the pressure of holding Die Mannschaft hopes on his shoulders since Germany started collecting disappointments in international tournaments. However, this season, under Xabi Alonso‚Äôs management, he has definitely exploded, increasing exponentially his game impact. With him and Jamal Musiala in their top game, Euro hosts are letting the imagination flow, dreaming about Die Mannschaft going back to the position they should never have abandoned. And what a better way than doing it on your own home... Below you can see a video with an in-depth analysis. Before, let me highlight a few bullet points: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Main Influence Area: In between opposition lines (pockets). 2Ô∏è‚É£ Role: Creator (high tactical IQ to read the game and decide accordingly). 3Ô∏è‚É£ Total freedom when in possession: He starts from the left offensive half-space, but he really has no position. HE IS LIQUID, flowing free around the pockets while disorganizing both his team‚Äôs and opposition's structures. His interventions give coherence to the own chaos while penalizing opposition‚Äôs disorder. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Technical Excellence: Possesses an exquisite technical capacity to play in reduced spaces: body shape and orientation, first touch, dominance of both legs, accurate ball mastery‚Ä¶ Check this out and share your thoughts! üìπ ‚öΩ ‚¨á #football #bayer04 #leverkusen #bundesliga #performanceanalysis #teamsuccess #footballanalysis #wirtz\n\n‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏èA Big THANKS to the German Soccer TEAM‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏è I am Celebrating the Leadership and Resilience: My Lessons from the German Soccer Team In the heart-pounding 1:2 match against Spain in Euro 2024, our German soccer team showed us what true grit and unity look like. While the scoreboard didn't favour us this time, our team's courage and spirit were nothing short of extraordinary. I'm bursting with pride for our team and Coach Julian Nagelsmann's incredible leadership. He truly embodied George Kohlrieser's \"Care to Dare\" philosophy. Trust was the foundation of their journey, uniting players from diverse cultural backgrounds into a cohesive unit where only skills, motivation, trust and dedication matter. Their fighting spirit and bravery in taking risks were inspiring. The players ventured boldly, testing their limits because they knew their coach was a secure base. Failures were not feared but embraced as stepping stones for growth and learning, leading to impactful changes and strategies. Every moment was filled with the spirit of willingness to perform and unwavering belief. Though we didn't clinch the top spot, we lost to another great champion, and that is something to honour. After a period of reflection, grieving and healing, we'll rise, ready to face the next big challenge: the Soccer World Cup 2026, with even greater determination. Germany has so much to learn from our soccer team's resilience and leadership. Let's celebrate our journey, cherish these lessons, and eagerly look forward to future triumphs! #Leadership #CareToDare #GermanSoccer #Euro2024 #Resilience #TeamSpirit #TrustAndRisk #ProudMoment #FutureChampions"
