        "text": "Hans-Joachim Watzke is set to step down as CEO at Borussia Dortmund by 2025 and is already setting up the plan for his succession, one is to appoint a sports manager with Sport Bild reporting that the signs point towards sporting director Sebastian Kehl.\n\nThe former Dortmund midfielder has already been key in the squad planning, not only in the past but for next season. Kehl has regularly explained to Watzke what his plans are for the squad, despite the fact there is no guarantee of Champions League football next season.\n\nA potential promotion could also impact the future of head coach Edin Terzic. It is widely known that Watzke is Terzicâ€™s biggest supporter at Dortmund but Kehl is not convinced of the manager. Disagreements in the past when it comes to the squad are known and a promotion would give Kehl more power to make a decision on the future of the coach. It is likely that Kehl would bring in a manager who could be a close confidant.\n\nSport Bild also reports that is it difficult to see Terzic remain as coach for next season. The club are in a race for fourth with RB Leipzig and with tough games against Bayern Munich, Stuttgart, Bayer Leverkusen and Leipzig on the horizon along with a difficult tie against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals the club are unlikely to come out of this run unscathed."
