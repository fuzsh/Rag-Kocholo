Financial sustainability: The introduction of a regulator will ensure closer monitoring and higher standards of reporting. Clubs will be required to ensure they have reserves and plans to ensure they can maintain the business in the instance of financial shocks.\n\n2.Suitability of owners: Directors and club owners will be more closely vetted for propriety and there will be commensurate licensing conditions to ensure higher standards. This will also affect the over-gearing of buy-outs and unsustainable debt levels.\n\n3. Fan engagement: Clubs will be required to consult with fans and there will be minimum standards of engagement including fans having a say, a veto over changes to historically important aspects of the club such as colours, badge and kit colours and geographic location.\n\n4. Breakaway leagues: The white paper aims to protect the football pyramid in the English game and exclude 'closed shop' type leagues like the proposed 'European Super League'.\n\n5. Financial distribution: The white paper aims to ensure a fairer distribution of income across the clubs in the English football pyramid and give power to the regulator to impose workable solutions on the clubs.\n\n6. Compliance/sanctions: The regulator will have the power to take action including withdraw licences from clubs ignoring breaches of conditions of licensing.\n\nThe regulator will cover 116 clubs in the top five tiers: The Premier League, The Championship, League 1, League 2 and the National League of the English professional game.\n\nA second part to the podcast series on the governance of German football will appear here shortly.\n\nThe football match to raise money for the DEC British Red Cross Earthquake Appeal 2023 which is mentioned takes place on Tuesday 7th March at 3pm at the Linford Christie Stadium, White City.

Abel also writes for France Football and Spielverlagerung and is a life-long fan of BVB.\n\nOn tonight's show, Ben and Abel review the 20-21 season. The club has been through a real roller coaster of a season the likes of which we have not seen since 17-18, under Austrian interim coach Peter Stöger who took over from the sacked Peter Bosz, when 'Die Schwarz-Gelben' finished in an impressive Champions League qualifying 4th place.\n\n1. A third season under Swiss coach Lucien Favre after narrowly missing out on the title by 2 points in an impressive 18-19 but 16 points in 19-20. Was the club's trust in Favre the right move?\n\n2. Impressive results but conceding stupid numbers of goals, why issues with set pieces are still the issue and the backline is still the issue but do BVB have talent in the back-line to come how much of an issue is Nico Schulz really?\n\n3. The DFB Pokal campaign this season did we overachieve? Paderborn proves a bigger threat than expected and taking it to new coach Marco Rose's \"Gladbach plus a preview of RB Leipzig and the semifinal.\n\n4. Former assistant Edin Terzic takes over from Favre midseason coming from only having experience of being an assistant with Besiktas and West Ham United. How good has Terzic really done? Is Edin destined for greater things?\n\n5. Are BVB still the number 2 team in the Bundesliga or have the scales shifted toward RB Leipzig at least this season?\n\n6. What positions should BVB be focussing on in the summer, can we hold on to Haaland and Sancho the dynamic duo and initial thoughts on what Marco Rose might bring.\n\n7. Predictions for the league finish and the DFB Pokal.\n\nAbel Meszaros can be found on social media at Twitter@BundesPL.

Will the ESL succeed? Will German clubs be drawn into the 'big business league'?\n\n1. European Super League what is it about? Who is behind it?\n\n2. What impact will the ESL have on national leagues, cups and Champions League?\n\n3. Could this benefit top clubs in smaller national leagues like Celtic, Ajax or Anderlecht?\n\n4. How will players and the football industry react to the possibility of bans from playing for their national teams?\n\n5. Is the ESL nothing more than an exhibition league with no incentive for fans to follow it? Or an improvement on the Champions League?\n\n6. Could this proposal bring a benefit to historically big clubs in small leagues like Holland, Scotland and Belgium?\n\n7. What is the business sense for clubs taking part? Will the fixed income from the tournament make managing the business of running clubs more effective off-setting financial risk and giving clubs the chance to plan better?\n\n8. What is the current position of Borussia Dortmund fans and the wider community of supporters across football how should they react to this development?\n\nThe European supporters federation, which this fan club belongs to, mentioned in the show is the FSE Football Supporters Europe whose position on the Super League can be found at:\n\nhttps://www.fanseurope.org/en/news/news-3/2414-fse-condemns-european-super-league-plans.html\n\nSuper League update following days of fan protests and legal action by UEFA 12 clubs including all the English Premier League teams have withdrawn and only Juventus, Barcelona and Real Madrid remain of the original 15 clubs.

The podcast may also be of interest to German football fans who want to learn or practice English.\n\nIt's all change at the Westfalenstadion and with the unrest amongst players and fans alike at the recent string of poor results and only 1 win in the last 6 league games and disappointing draws against both Mainz and Hoffenheim teams which BVB would normally expect 6 points from these home fixtures the head has been on interim coach Edin Terzic.\n\nWith key injuries most importantly Axel Witsel in midfield and a defence which has conceded 31 goals already by matchday 21 is looking decidedly critical even accounting for the absence of first-choice keeper Roman Bürki and Dan and centre back Axel Zagadou.\n\nSecond choice keeper Marvin Hitz has looked poor under pressure and an impressive Thomas Delaney has not been helped by Emre Can having to play in defence and Mo Dahoud being in such poor form.\n\nThe club is also going through financial concerns with debts of €70m and players still on reduced wages there have been no winter signings, only U17 international striker Julian Rijkhoff coming in from Ajax Amsterdam to join the academy.\n\nStill playing behind closed doors Borussia is missing the crucial 12th man and looking the worse for it now 16 points behind Bayern and of more concern, 6 points from 4th placed VFL Wolfsburg.\n\nThe agreement with Borussia Mönchengladbach coach for a three-year contract could not have come at a better time but who is Marco Rose and what is at stake this season and for the Leipzig born incumbent coach?\n\nOn today's show, our guests are Sascha Staat a German football journalist who works for Ruhrnachrichten Dortmund's main newspaper as well as Eurosport and DAZN TV channels.\n\n1. Current season BVB lie in sixth place in the table and are far off the mark in terms of a champions league place. The defence is far from stable and players like Marco Reus are not in the form to provide leadership. Why the instability?\n\n2. The Roman Bürki enigma, have the weaknesses returned or are the goals being conceded a result of the instability crucially at right and left-back in defence.\n\n3, The pressure is on Mats Hummels but is the pressure beginning to take away his enthusiasm? What should be the ideal line-up at Centre-back? Where should the constant Raphael Guerreiro be playing and which of the current defenders should be on Rose's for sale list this summer?\n\n4. What are issues in midfield without Axel Witsel? Can Borussia rely on Thomas Delaney? Where should Can be playing? Pundit and former international Lothar Matthäus says a player like Matthias Sammer is missing but which players could fill that gap from the current squad?\n\n5. Marco Reus has had uncharacteristic poor form and failed to lead the team in several matches, but is there too much reliance on 17-year-old Jude Bellingham who has had to hit the ground running. Giovanni Reyna has been a revelation but is now rumoured to be on the selling list, he has looked physically less than assertive but would that be a good move.\n\n6. Enter Youssoufa Moukoko could he replace the incredible Erling Haaland, a striker who has scored more times than games played in since joining 1 year ago. Could BVB manage without Haaland and what else is in reserve?\n\n7. What can be expected from Marco Rose in terms of tactical changes, what has been learnt from his style of coaching at RB Salzburg and Borus\n\nThank you for your interest in the BvB London fan community podcast as every week the focus of the show will be on exploring a facet of B​orussia Dortmund's life by talking to experts and former participants of the club's life.\n\nPeople like players, fans and journalists who have covered the club and decision-makers and experts who know the world of all our club well.\n\nThe aim of the podcast is to make this wonderful football club more accessible to non-German speakers.
