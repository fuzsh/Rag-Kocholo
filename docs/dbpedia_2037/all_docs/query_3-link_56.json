        "text": "The tragedy of Borussia Dortmund’s underachieving season in 2014-15 is that it made so many people forget how fun this team is. This goal from Sebastian Kehl offered a glimpse of those bygone days.\n\nDortmund were at home in the DFB-Pokal quarterfinals against TSG Hoffenheim yesterday. Down 2-1 at halftime, BVB managed to find an equalizer in the second half and force extra time. As the latter half of extra time started, both sides were getting punch-drunk, and it was looking like something magical would need to happen to avoid a penalty shootout.\n\nEnter Kehl, stage right.\n\nFrom distance. Through traffic. Pinging off the inside of the post. In a cup tie. In extra time. And it was the gamewinner. Really, this goal had it all.\n\nDortmund will face fierce rivals Bayern Munich in the semifinals on April 28. In the (admittedly unlikely) event they survive that encounter, they’ll face either Wolfsburg or second division side Arminia Bielefeld in the final on May 30."
