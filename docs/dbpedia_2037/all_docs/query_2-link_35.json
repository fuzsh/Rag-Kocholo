He will make us more stable and flexible, help us with his experience and have a very positive influence as a leader. We are very pleased that he has been a BVB fan for many years and has clearly committed to our club at an early stage.\"\n\nBVB sports director Sebastian Kehl said: \"We are very happy that we can bring Pascal back to the Bundesliga. With his calmness on the ball, his outstanding passing and positioning, and his versatility, he gives our team new facets. But Pascal is also a sly fox and radiates direct and indirect goal threats in many areas. We are convinced that he will enrich our game and strengthen us with his will to win and his personality.\"\n\nGross added: \"I'm really looking forward to BVB.\n\n\"For me, this move is simply a huge thing, because I've been a Dortmund fan since I was a little boy. I will try to repay the club's trust with my style and I can't wait to play in front of the BVB fans at the Signal Iduna Park with my new teammates and to work together with everyone to ensure that we achieve our big goals.\"\n\nHe becomes the first arrival of Sahin's reign after the former Dortmund and Real Madrid midfielder took over from the departed Edin Terzic.\n\ndiscovery+ is the streaming home of the Olympic Games, and the only place you can watch every moment of Paris 2024 this summer.\n\nTransfers\n\nMan Utd may move for Ugarte after McTominay sale to Napoli - Paper Round\n\nYesterday at 22:15\n\nPremier League\n\n‘We need him’ – Slot responds to Alexander-Arnold's frustration after substitution\n\nYesterday at 19:59"
