        "text": "Germany 3\n\nPortugal 1\n\n\\n\n\nMidfielder Bastian Schwein-steiger scored two goals and forced the other as World Cup hosts Germany beat Portugal 3-1 to claim third place last night.\n\nSchweinsteiger fired home his first goal of the competition from long range in the 56th minute to put Germany ahead.\n\nFive minutes later, a Schwei-nsteiger free-kick was deflected into his own net by Portugal midfielder Petit, a half-time substitute.\n\nSchweinsteiger added a third with a similar effort to his first in the 78th minute, the ball flying into the top right corner.\n\nSubstitute Luis Figo created Portugal's consolation, crossing perfectly from the right for Nuno Gomes to head home from close range two minutes from time.\n\nBoth sides had chances in an evenly balanced first half after Portugal surprisingly left captain Figo out of the starting line-up and Germany made six changes to their team.\n\nGermany midfielder Sebastian Kehl saw his shot deflected narrowly wide in the fifth minute and then produced a 25-metre chip which back-pedalling goalkeeper Ricardo did well to tip over.\n\nRicardo also turned away a piledriver shot from Lukas Podolski following a free-kick.\n\nAt the other end, Germany goalkeeper Oliver Kahn, making his first appearance at the World Cup after being relegated to the bench for the serious part of the tournament, denied Pauleta in the 15th minute.\n\nPauleta was sent clean through by Simao Sabrosa's pass but Kahn rushed out of his goal to block the Portugal striker's side-footed effort.\n\nPauleta, who has managed only one goal, also wasted an excellent chance in the 53rd minute when he shot weakly at Kahn with Ronaldo free and screaming for the ball to his left.\n\nIn the 56th minute, Schweinsteiger broke the deadlock as he skipped past two challenges and scored with a screaming 30-metre shot as the flight of the ball appeared to deceive Ricardo.\n\nSchweinsteiger rocket\n\nFive minutes later, Germany won a free-kick on the left and another Schweinsteiger rocket was deflected into the net by the hapless Petit.\n\nGermany striker Miroslav Klose, the tournament's leading scorer with five goals. was substituted in the 64th minute without adding to his tally.\n\nFigo, whose international future is the subject of speculation at the age of 33, came on for Pauleta in the 77th minute.\n\nHe had barely come on to the pitch when Schweinsteiger struck again to add further fuel to the German party mood which was barely dampened by Gomes's late diving header.\n\nGermany: 12-Kahn; 16-Lahm, 21-Metzelder, 6-Nowotny, 2-Jansen; 19-Schneider, 5-Kehl, 8-Frings, 7-Schweinsteiger (15-Hitzlsperger 79); 20-Podolski (9-Hanke 71), 11-Klose (10-Neuville 64).\n\nPortugal: 1-Ricardo; 2-Ferreira, 5-Meira, 4-Costa, 14-Valente (21-Gomes 69); 6-Costinha (8-Petit 46), 18-Maniche, 11-Simao, 17-Ronaldo, 20-Deco; 9-Pauleta (7-Figo 77).\n\nReferee: Toru Kamikawa (Japan).\n\nScorers: Schweinsteiger 56, 78; Petit 61 og; Gomes 88.\n\nHalf-time: 0-0; Attendance: 52,000.\n\nFIFA man of the match: Schweinsteiger.\n\nGermany vs Portugal stats\n\nGermany\n\nPortugal\n\nGoals\n\n3\n\n1\n\nShots on goal\n\n5\n\n8\n\nShots\n\n12\n\n13\n\nFouls\n\n15\n\n15\n\nCorner kicks\n\n2\n\n7\n\nOffsides\n\n1\n\n3\n\nYellow cards\n\n2\n\n3\n\nRed cards\n\n0\n\n0\n\nPossession\n\n43%\n\n57%"
