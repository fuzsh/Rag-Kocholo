        "text": "A Cunning Plan\n\nThe first stage in the Cunning Plan was to find a volunteer who would be prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. The individual concerned would need to be a true patriot but would have to be able to speak fluent German. They would have to be prepared to go deep undercover, leaving behind their friends and family and cutting off all ties to their previous life. They would also have to undergo painful and irreversible surgery. In short they would have to become JUERGEN KLINSMANN!!!\n\nOnce a brave volunteer had been found and the months of plastic surgery had been completed, the next step in the Cunning Plan could take place. The real Klinsmann would be kidnapped and held in a secure location whilst his doppelganger took over the reigns. The fake Klinsmann would then proceed to wreck the German national team by selecting second-rate players, instituting bizarre and poorly communicated tactics and blaming everyone else for his failure. If the faux-Klinsmann could hold onto his job for long enough then the German teamâ€™s proud record in major competitions would be a thing of the past and they would plummet down the FIFA rankings.\n\nAnd so The Revenge Of The Tartan Army began.\n\nA Willing Volunteer\n\nClearly the first stage in the plan was to find a Willing Volunteer. The successful candidate would need to be the same general age, height and build as the real Klinsmann as there was only so much that could be achieved through surgery. He would have to be fluent in German and be able to imitate Klinsmannâ€™s voice and mannerisms so accurately that even the Germanâ€™s closest friends and family would be fooled by the charade. After patient weeks of searching the Berlin Branch of the Tartan Army finally found their man.\n\nStefan McCardle was the product of a marriage between a Scottish father and a German mother. His parents met when his dad, an army man, was posted to Osnabruck, and the two fell in love and soon married. When Stefan was born his father decided that he would remain in Germany at the end of his tour of duty rather than accepting another posting and uprooting his family, so he bought himself out of the Army. As a skilled electrical engineer he had no great difficulty in finding work and he set up a small business that provided the McCardleâ€™s with a very comfortable living.\n\nStefanâ€™s father enjoyed his life in Germany but he never let his son forget his Scottish roots and the young lad was taught English at home and grew up totally bi-lingual. A keen football fan, McCardle senior followed his local team and his son accompanied him to the home games from an early age. But young Stefan was fully indoctrinated with tales of the Scottish national team and their great players of the past and the McCardle men always took a keen interest in the teamâ€™s fortunes.\n\nWhen Stefan was first sounded out about the Cunning Plan he showed an immediate enthusiasm â€“ of course at that time he had no idea that he was being considered as the Willing Volunteer. But gradually he was drawn in deeper and deeper. Not only did Stefan have the right physical attributes â€“ he was a similar age to the real Klinsmann, was tall, slim and blond â€“ but he had no strong family ties (his parents had met with a tragic accident a couple of years earlier) and he was a gifted amateur thespian. He was finally convinced to take on the task when it was suggested that the Cunning Plan would serve as a monument to his late father who, alas, had not lived to see his beloved Scotland rid themselves of the disastrous Vogts.\n\nUproar In The Press\n\nAt the time of Stefanâ€™s insertion the German national team was in 13th place in the FIFA rankings. The team would be competing in the Confederations Cup in June and before that time they had two friendly games scheduled, an away game in Nigeria and a home game against Uruguay. When Stefan announced his squad for the game in Nigeria the German Press went haywire â€“ most of the 22 players were complete unknowns. FC Bayern keeper Oliver Kahn was the only prominent player in the squad. There were a few players from First Division clubs but most came from teams in the lower divisions. The only capped players were Kahn, midfielder Stefan Freund and winger Horst Heldt. But there was one common factor â€“ they were all at least 35 years of age. At a chaotic press conference Stefan, as Klinsmann, made a short announcement.\n\nâ€œI have chosen a German squad packed with experienced players because at International level experience is very important. You cannot rely on young players at this level as they, by their very definition, are lacking in experience in light of their extreme youthfulness. I am confident that the mature professionals that I have selected will do me proud.â€\n\nRefusing to answer any questions me made his escape and decided to lay low until the squad flew out to Nigeria. The game itself was a little disappointing as his team of journeymen did surprisingly well, only losing 2-0. On his return to Germany, Stefan made a brief appearance in front of the press to give his views on the game.\n\nâ€œWe were obviously very unfortunate to have lost this game. For many of our squad this was the first time that they had left their native shores and clearly the experience of visiting the Dark Continent was difficult for them. There were many other factors that contributed to our unlucky defeat - many of the players were airsick during the long flight; the pitch was not in very good condition; the game was played with a yellow ball; there are too many foreign players in Germany; the general weakness of the German economy is a concern for everyone and it certainly affected the focus of the team. But rest assured that I am not concerned by this one-off result and we will rectify the situation in our next match, of that I am certain.â€\n\nThanks Simon. Stuart, you must be a mind reader\n\nGiving Youth Their Head\n\nWithin a couple of weeks the faux-Klinsmann had to announce his team squad for the visit of Uruguay and once again there was a shock in store for the assembled press. This time he had made his selection from some of the larger clubs in Germany â€“ FC Bayern, HSV, Hertha BSC, Hannover 96 and others. That wasnâ€™t the surprise. The bombshell was that all of his squad were aged 18 or under. Once again Stefan made a brief statement at a frenzied press conference.\n\nâ€œIt should be clear to all of you, as indeed it is to me, that the future of our national team lies with youth. In the words of the great Whitney Houston - 'I believe the children are our future, Teach them well and let them lead the way'. Fine words indeed, and who can argue with that sentiment. You see before you a new generation of German players that will lead our country to glory and give us a brave new future.â€\n\nDeclining to answer the frantic barrage of questions that his statement had generated, he quickly left and tried to stay out of the limelight until the day of the match. The game was not a success for Stefan as his youngsters did remarkably well, holding on for a scoreless draw. He did his best to disrupt them by making nine substitutions during the game but to no avail. Despite his personal disappointment, Stefan put a very positive spin on the result during his post-match statement.\n\nâ€œA goalless draw against one of the best teams in world football is a very creditable result for my young team. With a little more good fortune we could easily have won. Events conspired against us, of that there is no doubt. Consider the following â€“ none of the youngsters had played for their country before; a number of them were feeling very homesick and missing their parents; the evening kick-off was very late and past the normal bed time for several of my players; playing in front of a large crowd was quite upsetting for some â€“ the noise gives them a headache; and of course the high unemployment rate is a concern for everyone in the country.â€\n\nCheers WLKRAS\n\nThe Confederations Cup\n\nAs the German domestic season came to a close there was increasing speculation regarding the squad for the forthcoming Confederations Cup tournament. It hadnâ€™t taken the German press long to question the sanity of their national coach following his recent squad selections and the 22 unveiled by Stefan for the tournament only served to increase the outcry to near-hysterical levels. The entire squad came from a single team â€“ VfB Lubeck who had finished 14th in the Second Division. Stefan made his usual brief announcement at the press briefing before taking his leave and going into hiding.\n\nâ€œThe single most important factor in the long term success of any team is consistency â€“ and continuity of course. And what could offer more in that arena than a group of players who are teammates at club level as well as at International level. Hence my selection today. Why Lubeck you will ask â€“ why not a team such as FC Bayern after their all-conquering season both domestically and in Europe. Iâ€™ll tell you why. I have found that the most important factor in selection for the national team is that you must be German. And FC Bayern have too many foreign players. The same with Dortmund, Schalke, Stuttgart and all of the other top teams. The Lubeck players are all German and are all proud to be representing their country. Consistency is key and this is a very consistent squad.â€\n\nFor Germany the competition started with a game against Australia and Stefan was pretty disappointed with the scoreless draw. Next up came Senegal and Stefan was positively distressed when his team won 2-0. The 3-0 defeat by Argentina in the final game was much more satisfactory although given the bizarre tactics that Stefan employed he had expected a higher scoreline. Luckily this meant that Germany finished 3rd in their group with Argentina and Australia qualifying. In his post-tournament summary, Stefan tried to highlight the positives.\n\nâ€œLetâ€™s look at it this way â€“ we only lost one game out of three and thatâ€™s pretty good. My innovation to have the very popular Der Drei Lederhosen singing the national anthem before each game was a masterstroke, enthusing the crowd and giving us great support. There have been some questions about the tactics that I employed in the final game but I felt that playing with no one in central midfield and deploying 5 wingers would confuse the opposition but Argentina are a world class team and they managed to adapt to my formation better than anyone could have imagined. But it is vital to have experimentation and change â€“ we cannot live in a vacuum. And anyway, the crippling cost of re-unification affects every aspect of our lives and footballers are people too.â€\n\nThe Fallout\n\nThe German FA were appalled at their teamâ€™s performance in the Confederation Cup, their anger and dismay magnified by the fact that the tournament had taken place on home soil. Stefan was invited to explain his actions at an extraordinary general meeting of the Board and he had to be at his most persuasive to hang on to his job. After a very narrow vote in his favour he realised that he needed to be a little more circumspect in his actions and that he would have to get a couple of decent results under his belt. His task was made easier by the fact that the next major tournament was the 2006 World Cup and Germany had already qualified as hosts. The FA had arranged a few warm-up games in advance of the tournament so a win here and there should be enough to keep him in the job until then.\n\nBy naming a squad of established players and using fairly sensible tactics Stefan engineered wins over Hungary and Austria. With the FA and the press being lulled into a false sense of security the fake Klinsmann began planning his assault on the World Cup.\n\nTowards The World Cup\n\nThere was great excitement in the German press as the draw was made for the group stages of the World Cup. The hosts were placed in Group G alongside the USA, Romania and Ghana and the general consensus was that the team should have no great trouble in securing qualification. There was one final warm-up game scheduled in advance of the tournament and by coincidence it would be against fellow Group G side Romania.\n\nStefan decided that it was time to wind up the press once more and his squad announcement for the friendly certainly had the desired effect.\n\nâ€œYou may not be aware of my deep interest in ancient Chinese philosophy but it is a subject that has fascinated me for some time now. Strange reading for a mere football man, you might think, but not all football men are unintelligent. During the Han dynasty, around 200 BC, the various strands of Chinese philosophical thinking were organised into a number of schools. Some are relatively well known. For instance the YinYang philosophers studied the nature of the cosmos and attempted to account for all of its changes in terms of two fundamental principles, the Yin and the Yang. There is also the school of the Dao or Way, which attempted to understand the ultimate principles of reality and to offer a fundamentally different concept of social organization.\n\nBut my personal interest is in a concept based around the thinking of Wan Hung Lo who conceived the idea of Wu Hsing or the five material agents (wood, fire, earth, metal and water). Accordingly I have made my squad selection based on the German translation of those elements (Holz, Feuer, Erde, Metall and Wasser) and I have selected players whose names contain these words. I am confident that this will tap into the power of this fundamental philosophy, bringing great harmony to the team and harnessing the awesome power of nature to great effect.â€\n\nHaving been reassured by Stefanâ€™s selection for the last couple of games the press listened open-mouthed to his latest bizarre pronouncement before all hell broke loose. Stefan made a mad dash for the exit and hid himself away until match day.\n\nThe game itself started well, Romania scoring virtually straight from the kick-off. But then striker Michael Holzer scored twice before half time and Stefan was forced to bring him off because he was playing too well, Thomas Holz replacing him. At the same time he removed keeper Heinz Scholz who was also proving to be unacceptably competent. During the second half midfielders Mario Scholze and Daniel Farenholz were also replaced by Christian Holzer and Stefan Holzinger as they were also playing too well. With 20 minutes remaining Stefan made a last throw of the dice, removing substitute keeper Tammo Feuerherdt who was also proving to be half decent, and replacing him with central defender Soren Holz. That finally did the trick, Romania equalising late on â€“ a draw was better than a win but Stefan was still unhappy with the final result.\n\nWorld Cup Fever\n\nAs the opening game of the World Cup finals approached, there was feverish speculation in the German press regarding the squad that the Klinsmann doppelganger would announce for the most important tournament in the countryâ€™s history. As host nation anything less than an appearance in the final would be regarded as failure and Stefan was acutely aware of this.\n\nBy the time he made his squad announcement a new set of FIFA rankings had been produced and the Berlin Branch of the Tartan Army were delighted to see that Germany had dropped down to 29th place. The pressroom was a buzz of noise as Stefan approached the dais at the front of the room with several sheets of paper clutched in his hand. To the huge relief of the assembled media, Stefanâ€™s squad for the World Cup was, by his standards at least, very conventional.\n\n<pre class=\"ip-ubbcode-code-pre\">Name Club Caps Goals Value\n\nBalitsch, H Leverkusen 4 0 â‚¬7.75M\n\nBallack, M FC Bayern 43 16 â‚¬41.5M\n\nBierofka, D Leverkusen 7 1 â‚¬4.8M\n\nDeisler, S FC Bayern 29 4 â‚¬32M\n\nFreier, P Bochum 11 1 â‚¬5.5M\n\nFrings, T Dortmund 25 2 â‚¬22M\n\nFritz, C Frankfurt 0 0 â‚¬2.4M\n\nHuth, R Chelsea 0 0 â‚¬6.5M\n\nJeremies, J Hertha BSC 49 1 â‚¬8.25M\n\nKahn, O FC Bayern 69 0 â‚¬3.4M\n\nKehl, S Dortmund 18 1 â‚¬10M\n\nKlose, M Schalke 04 38 21 â‚¬19M\n\nKuranyi, K VfB Stuttgart 11 1 â‚¬17.5M\n\nLauth, B Chelsea 5 1 â‚¬10.25M\n\nLeschinski, B HSV 0 0 â‚¬2.4M\n\nMetzelder, C Dortmund 24 0 â‚¬24M\n\nNowotny, J Leverkusen 45 0 â‚¬6.5M\n\nRahn, C HSV 10 1 â‚¬10.25M\n\nRau, T FC Bayern 13 1 â‚¬4.1M\n\nRost, F Werder Bremen 5 0 â‚¬4.7M\n\nSchindzielorz, S 1.FC KÃ¶ln 0 0 â‚¬5M\n\nWÃ¶rns, C Chelsea 56 0 â‚¬1.1M</pre>\n\nHowever, in his short summary after the squad was revealed, there lay a hint of things to come.\n\nâ€œTo be successful in a major international tournament it is necessary to deploy tactical flexibility. The modern game is a squad game and each member of the squad must be prepared to do whatever is necessary to ensure the success of the team. During the forthcoming tournament I will be taking tactical flexibility to a new level and I can assure you that there will be some surprises in store for our opponents and fans alike.â€\n\nThanks toby\n\nThe Tournament\n\nThe opening game against Romania started in conventional enough fashion â€“ a strong team selection taking the field and a sensible 4-4-2 formation adopted. Then on the half hour, with the game still scoreless, Stefan received an unexpected bonus. Right back Hanno Balitsch received his second yellow card and Germany were reduced to 10 men. Sensing an opportunity he reshuffled his formation, moving striker Miroslav Klose to right back to the Schalke playerâ€™s obvious confusion. Romania scored what proved to be the winning goal a few minutes before half time and Stefan was spared the need to tinker further with his formation. In his post-match press conference he explained that moving Klose back into defence was an example of the tactical flexibility that he demanded from his team.\n\nFor the game against the USA Stefan raised some eyebrows when he replaced the suspended Balitsch with Dortmund midfielder Sebastian Kehl, once again citing tactical flexibility. With 60 minutes played and the game still scoreless, he made some tactical changes. Midfielder Jens Jeremies replaced striker Klose and central defender Jens Nowotny came on for left-winger Daniel Bierofka. This successfully reduced his teamâ€™s attacking threat and the game ended in a 0-0 stalemate.\n\nEntering the final game against Ghana, Romania were already assured of qualification with two wins. The USA were second on 4 points and a draw would see them through. Germany had just one point and their fate was not solely in their own hands. Stefan decided to field an orthodox team and save any radical changes until he saw how the remaining group game was progressing. After half an hour Germany were two goals ahead and the USA were losing to Romania but still held second place. When Germany scored a third goal in stoppage time at the end of the first half Stefan decided that drastic action was required during the interval. Chelsea centre back Robert Huth was having a stormer, having scored twice, so he was replaced by attacking midfielder Diesler with Torsten Frings coming on for striker Kuranyi. A 4th German goal just after the restart prompted another change, a clearly bewildered Michael Ballack swapping places with keeper Oliver Kahn. Unfortunately the Ghanaians were so inept that even that change made no difference, the Africans failing to register a shot on target for the entire 90 minutes.\n\nSo despite Stefanâ€™s best attempts his German team, aided by a 2-0 defeat for the USA, had staged a remarkable comeback to qualify for the second round on goal difference. The good news was that they would face the highly fancied France in their next game. Stefan made a brief statement to the press in advance of the game.\n\nâ€œI am delighted with the way in which my players have adopted to my mantra of tactical flexibility. By forcing players to operate in unfamiliar roles it enhances their tactical awareness and improves our capabilities as a team. I have been widely criticised for switching Ballack and Kahn in our last game but I believe that it proved to be an unqualified success, giving both players a taste of what may be necessary in extreme circumstances. And by the way, Der Drei Lederhosen continue to inspire both the fans and the players alike. I will be extending this Munich Beer Hall feeling even further by insisting that all of the players drink a large stein of finest Bavarian ale whilst the national anthem is played before the next game.â€\n\nStefanâ€™s cause was helped by injures to Huth, Jeremies and Nowotny, giving him ample excuse to adopt a more unorthodox lineup for the France game and he played reserve keeper Frank Rost in the centre of defence. An injury to Balitsch during the first half allowed him to bring forward Paul Freier on to replace the fullback but still his team reached the break with the game scoreless. That changed when Thierry Henry scored just after the restart and he was able to see the game out with no further changes. Germany were eliminated - and humiliated â€“ the press were baying for blood and this time there was no escape for Stefan. Without even being given an opportunity to defend himself, he was fired.\n\nI know flip, but what can you do\n\nSome People Are Never Satisfied\n\nWhen the dust had settled Stefan made his way surreptitiously to the safe house where the real Klinsmann was being held. He expected that the kidnap victim would shortly be released and life could return to something approaching normal. The conspirators reasoned that even if Klinsmann did go to the authorities, no one would believe his bizarre tale, assuming that he was either completely mad or that he had invented it all as a way of avoiding blame for the entire fiasco.\n\nBut the Berlin Branch of the Tartan Army were not yet satisfied. Yes, the German team had been embarrassed, having to endure a humiliating exit in the most important tournament ever staged on German soil, but they wanted more. They wanted to leave a lasting impression and for that they needed to repeat their scam one more time. A week or so after Stefanâ€™s sacking, the German FA appointed a new national team coach and the plotters wanted to continue with their Cunning Plan. After intensive discussions with Stefan he was somewhat reluctantly persuaded to go undercover for one last time. He would repeat his ordeal of surgery and would take on another identity â€“ he would become MATTHIAS SAMMER.\n\nSorry about that HD\n\nThe Road To Euro 2008\n\nGermany had been drawn in Group 4 alongside Andorra, Latvia, Poland, Russia and Slovakia and would begin their campaign with two home games in quick succession. When the counterfeit Sammer took to the podium, still swathed in bandages, he could sense that the press was immediately sympathetic to him. The announcement he made to unveil his squad for the opening games soon put a stop to that.\n\nâ€œMy predecessor made so many glaring mistakes in his time in charge, but in my opinion his biggest error came in his squad selection for the recent World Cup fiasco. His reliance on home-based players proved to be disastrous, culminating in an early exit from the tournament and his own demise. I intend to pursue a different course entirely by selecting only those players of German nationality that play outside of our homeland. In my opinion our top domestic players have become too comfortable on their inflated salaries and complacent in their approach towards the game. I have scoured Europe in search of Germans who have had the courage and the motivation to leave their native land in search of fame and fortune, and these are the players who will be rewarded internationally from now on.â€\n\nThe squad in full\n\n<pre class=\"ip-ubbcode-code-pre\">Name Club\n\nKling,S Arsenal\n\nDhompirom,G AstonVilla\n\nHuber,E AustriaVienna\n\nSolga,D AustriaVienna\n\nLanger,M Blackburn\n\nLauth,B Chelsea\n\nErhan,A FenerbahÃ§e\n\nHamann,D Liverpool\n\nDiGregorio,B Perugia\n\nHofmann,S RapidVienna\n\nHenning,R Sporting\n\nZiege,C Tottenham\n\nJancker,C Udinese\n\nVolz,M Arsenal\n\nHasse,H AustriaVienna\n\nRost,T AustriaVienna\n\nKeidel,R Blackburn\n\nHuth,R Chelsea\n\nNiemeyer,P FCTwente\n\nBerkant,G Galatasaray\n\nThomas,A Paris-SG\n\nNerlinger,C Rangers\n\nWiese,T RealSociedad\n\nHitzlsperger,T Tottenham\n\nFederico,G Udinese\n\nDa Costa, N FC Twente</pre>\n\nThe response from the media was an instantaneous uproar as the implications of Stefanâ€™s statement hit home. Trying to make like the invisible man, he made his exit and awaited the reaction to his teamâ€™s display in their forthcoming games.\n\nStefan was hopeful that the poor quality of his players would mean that he would not have to get too bizarre with his tactics or playing positions but when his team went into half time leading Latvia 1-0 he clearly needed a re-think. Too many of the misfits that he had selected were playing well â€“ who would have thought that Arsenalâ€™s Moritz Volz would make a decent right back! But despite three changes at half time the situation got worse â€“ a stoppage time goal giving the Germans a 2-0 win.\n\nSome changes in personnel saw an improvement against Russia until the Germans took the lead through an own goal with 20 minutes remaining. Fortunately, the visitors managed a very late equaliser to rob the Germans of two points.\n\nThe announcement by the bogus Sammer that he would no longer be considering home-based players had produced an interesting reaction amongst some of the senior German stars. Oliver Kahn and Jens Nowotny both announced their retirement from international football. Younger stars such as Ballack and Deisler made noises about moving abroad.\n\nThe German squad for the trip to Poland featured several new faces due to a number of injury withdrawals and Stefan was hopeful of securing a suitably poor result. He decided to deploy an ultra-defensive sweeper system modelled on the Italian Catenaccio style. With no natural sweeper in the squad Christian Worns was deployed in that position and performed as poorly as Stefan had hoped. His plan was almost undone by a superb performance from young Blackburn keeper Michael Langer but a swap with Tim Wiese of Real Sociedad and a second-half penalty did the trick, resulting in a 1-0 win to the Poles.\n\nItâ€™s Muller Time\n\nThere was a gap of several months before Germanyâ€™s next game, a friendly in Singapore, and at the end of 2006 the new FIFA Rankings were published. Stefan was delighted to see that the German national team had now fallen to 43rd place. He was keen to keep the decline in their fortunes going and thought long and hard about his next squad selection. He finally settled on his players and made his usual short announcement to the assembled press.\n\nâ€œWe are about to undertake a long journey to the mysterious East, to the Orient, where we will represent our country with pride. I have decided on a squad selection that makes it clear to our hosts just where we are coming from, that we are German and proud to be so and proud to represent our fine country. And what is more German than that most German of names, Muller? Did not one of the finest goalscorers the world has ever seen not sport that very same name? So it seems entirely sensible to have selected 26 players who all share that fine surname.â€\n\n<pre class=\"ip-ubbcode-code-pre\">Name Club\n\nMÃ¼ller, A Oberhausen\n\nMÃ¼ller, B SC Freiburg\n\nMÃ¼ller, B Neuenkirchen\n\nMÃ¼ller, C Offenbach\n\nMÃ¼ller, C Jena II\n\nMÃ¼ller, C Augsburg\n\nMÃ¼ller, D Gladbach\n\nMÃ¼ller, D Lichtenberg\n\nMÃ¼ller, D Siegen\n\nMÃ¼ller, F Paderborn II\n\nMÃ¼ller, G Aue\n\nMÃ¼ller, G Jena\n\nMÃ¼ller, H DÃ¼sseldorf\n\nMÃ¼ller, J Wald-Michelbach\n\nMÃ¼ller, K FC Bayern\n\nMÃ¼ller, K Karlsruhe\n\nMÃ¼ller, L Unterhaching\n\nMÃ¼ller, L Karlsruhe\n\nMÃ¼ller, N Verl\n\nMÃ¼ller, R Aue\n\nMÃ¼ller, S Verl\n\nMÃ¼ller, S SC Freiburg\n\nMÃ¼ller, S Dresden-Nord\n\nMÃ¼ller, S Wolfsburg\n\nMÃ¼ller, T Eisbachtal\n\nMÃ¼ller, T Jena</pre>\n\nStefan did not hang around to face the hostile press response but instead headed straight to the airport and flew to Singapore early to enjoy a little sightseeing before the team arrived. His team did reasonably well, winning 1-0 as Stefan resisted making any unusual tactical changes â€“ the look on the faces of the reporters when he unveiled his team full of Mullers was reward enough.\n\nThanks chaps\n\nA Right Mullering\n\nGermanyâ€™s Euro 2008 group got back into action at the end of March with games in Slovakia and Andorra. Stefan decided to stick with his squad of Mullers and although he had several withdrawals because of injury he was able to draft in a ready supply of replacement Mullers. The game in Slovakia ended all square at 1-1 and there were 4 more withdrawals in the few days before the trip to Andorra. Stefan was now scraping the bottom of his Muller barrel but still managed to find enough players. A 1-0 win was obtained to maintain Germanyâ€™s 4th place in the group. When the squad flew back home Stefan made a short announcement to the waiting press.\n\nâ€œI am very happy with our performance in two difficult games. We were perhaps unfortunate in Slovakia not to have taken full points and I would single out the performance of Muller and Muller although Muller was perhaps a little disappointing. We looked more dangerous up front once substitute Muller came on and he took his goal very well. We were forced into some changes in Andorra with Muller, Muller, Muller and Muller all joining the squad to replace the injured Muller, Muller, Muller and Muller. Muller, Muller and Muller all impressed and it was the right decision to rest Muller initially, as we saw when he came off the bench to score the winning goal.â€\n\nThere were two more vital games scheduled for June â€“ first Germany would travel to Russia and then Poland would come to Berlin. Helped by an early sending off, the Muller bunch gained an unexpected 4-1 win in Russia and then the team drew 0-0 with Poland. After that match Stefan had the unusual experience of addressing journalists who were not all openly hostile to him.\n\nâ€œThe result in Russia was excellent, especially considering that we lost captain Muller to an early injury. Muller was absolutely outstanding and his two goals were world class. Muller and Muller were once again an inspiration to their team-mates and the performance of substitutes Muller and Muller was very encouraging. Our performance against Poland was not quite so good but it was always going to be difficult playing the group leaders.â€\n\nGermanyâ€™s next action was in September with a trip to Latvia and a game at home to Andorra. The opening game finished scoreless leaving Germanyâ€™s qualification in the balance. With two group games left they were 4th place but could still secure a playoff place. Andorra were beaten 1-0 but the other results in the group meant that the top three teams all had 19 points, three more than the Germans, and it would take an extraordinary sequence of scores for Stefanâ€™s team to grab the runners-up place.\n\nStefan sent out his team of Mullers for the visit of Slovakia in what would almost certainly be his last game in charge and watched them play out a goalless draw. But despite his failure to qualify for Euro 2008 he was amazed to find that the German FA did not sack him and he was retained to guide them to qualification in the 2010 World Cup.\n\nFootball â€“ A Black And White Thing\n\nAmazed that he was still in employment after failing to qualify for the European Championships, Stefan entered 2008 determined to take full advantage of his good fortune. Having a team full of Mullers was fun but for the World Cup qualification campaign he needed to be even more creative. The new FIFA Rankings showed that Germany had slipped just two places to 45th â€“ not good enough by a long chalk. There was a friendly in Australia scheduled for March, which would give an ideal opportunity for a suitably poor result if he could come up with an appropriate squad selection.\n\nâ€œSo before I formally announce my squad for the forthcoming game in Australia, I would like to explain my thinking behind the selection. Once again we find ourselves travelling to the other side of the world and it is extremely important that we keep our German identity to the fore. Now given that our team colours of white shirts and black shorts are known all over the planet I think that it is very appropriate to keep that theme amongst the players. You will therefore find that all of my squad share their names with either our white tops (WeiÃŸ) or our black bottoms (Schwarz).â€\n\n<pre class=\"ip-ubbcode-code-pre\">Name Club\n\nSchwarz, D SC Freiburg\n\nSchwarz, D Villingen\n\nSchwarz, F Lichterfelde\n\nSchwarz, H SC Freiburg\n\nSchwarz, M Gladbach (A)\n\nSchwarz, M Braunschweig\n\nSchwarz, M FC Bayern\n\nSchwarz, M Grimma\n\nSchwarz, S Trier\n\nSchwarz, S Schalke 04 Under 23s\n\nWeiÃŸ, A LÃ¼beck II\n\nWeiÃŸ, C Hordel\n\nWeiÃŸ, C Schwerin\n\nWeiÃŸ, D Ratingen\n\nWeiÃŸ, F Arm.

But once again his team confounded his expectations, and despite playing all four of his keepers in outfield positions they somehow produced a 0-0 draw.\n\nThank you gentlemen - now time for some schoolboy humour I feel.\n\nThe Rude Boys And The World Cup\n\nShortly after their return from Australia the draw was made for the World Cup qualifiers and Germany found themselves in Group 1 alongside Serbia & Montenegro, Greece, Wales, Cyprus and Malta â€“ a mouth-watering draw that gave ample room for some humiliating defeats. The campaign commenced with two games in early September â€“ away to Serbia and at home against Cyprus â€“ with a trip to Wales the next month. It was with great delight that Stefan announced his squad for the remaining games of the year.\n\nGoalkeepers\n\nMalte Bonertz\n\nHans-Jorg Butt\n\nDominik Wohlfarth\n\nDefenders\n\nChristian Bumberger\n\nRene Bogesits\n\nFlorian Dick\n\nVolker Grimminger\n\nMichael Kokocinski\n\nMichael Wanke\n\nMartin Amedick\n\nRandy Gottwald\n\nMarkus LÃ¼dicke\n\nCarsten Wohlfarth\n\nMidfielders\n\nMirko Dickhaut\n\nPeer Kluge\n\nTim Kokoska\n\nJanusz Marek\n\nDennis Viszkok\n\nSascha Iffarth\n\nGuido Spork\n\nMarcel Abshagen\n\nTobias BÃ¼ttner\n\nForwards\n\nUfuk Cicek\n\nBenjamin Titz\n\nCharly Kuntz\n\nSteffen Wohlfarth\n\nFollowing a 2-0 defeat in Serbia, Stefan made a brief announcement to the assembled press.\n\nâ€œIt was a disappointing performance today, I have to admit. We werenâ€™t soild enough at the back although Butt was very tight. Titz looked exposed up front and Abshagen looked tired late on. However Dick was hard and stood up well but Wanke seemed to be playing his own game.â€\n\nA few days later Cyprus visited the BayArena in Leverkusen and after a 2-0 win to Germany the press were a more forgiving mood.\n\nâ€œI left out Dick and Titz and I think that made a noticeable difference. Whilst not the most mobile, Bogesits is certainly dependable and youâ€™ll always know where he will be. Young Ufuk was a natural â€˜in the holeâ€™ although Dickhaut put in a flaccid performance. Wohlfarth blew hot and cold and Grimminger may not be pretty in midfield but he proved to be very effective.â€\n\nThe final game of the year was a visit to Wales and with Michael Wanke missing with a groin strain Fatih Cimsit was drafted in as a replacement. In the days leading up to the game Guido Spork also suffered a knock so Erol Arslan came into the squad. Stefan could barely hide his delight after a 4-0 thrashing but he did make time to address the media once more.\n\nâ€œPerhaps our problem up front is that Titz is just not big enough and although Peer made a stream of accurate passes Kuntz was left wide open. We all know that Randy Gottwald is an excitable player and to be honest Amedick was made to look silly. Kokocinski was up and down all day, Arslan was too far back and Fatih Cimsit just looked out of shape. But I am confident that the situation can be retrieved and that come next year the team will be firing on all cylinders once more.â€\n\nThe first game of 2009 was a friendly at home to Estonia and Stefan introduced a number of new names into his 23-man squad. Sadly he was hit with a number of withdrawals due to injury. This robbed him of the services of players such as Sebastian Popp, Ronny Rhode, Tobias Willi, Tobias Wurm and Florian Pinz thereby robbing him of the opportunity to use a whole host of awful puns in his post-match summary. On the positive side he still had the likes of Jan Sandmann, Justus Six, Patrick Prang, Dennis Puhl, Christian Stuff, Stephan Tingler, Jens Luck, Markus Rusch, Michael StrÃ¶ll and Christian Quack. The game ended scoreless and, being just a friendly he decided to dispense with his comments to the press and save his witty wordplay for a more important game.\n\nWorld Cup qualification continued with two games in quick succession â€“ at home to Malta and away to Greece. Stefan was able to bring in all of the previously injured players thereby giving himself some superb punning opportunites. The Maltese achieved a creditable 0-0 draw, thanks mainly to some creative use of out of position players by Stefan. The game in Greece was not going to plan when Germany found themselves 2-1 ahead with 10 minutes to play but some inspired substitutions turned the game around and the Greeks finally ran out 4-2 winners.\n\nâ€œLuck was not on our side in these games and I still canâ€™t understand why Jens played so poorly. Rusch was in too much of a hurry whilst StrÃ¶ll seemed to lack urgency. At the back Wurm was turned far too easily, Willi was pulled all over the place, Sandmann looked half asleep and Rhode still has a long way to go. On the positive side, Tingler was electric, Stuff covered most of the pitch, Pinz gave the opposition some needle, Justus Six did the work of five men and Popp goes the weasel. With Puhl pushing up, Prang crashing into the defence and Quack ducking and diving we have real hope for the future.â€"
