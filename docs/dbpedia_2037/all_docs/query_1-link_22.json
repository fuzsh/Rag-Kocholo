Funny, because he was one behind coach Jurgen Klinsmann's tally of 11 World Cup goals.\"\n\nBBC Sport presenter Gary Lineker\n\n\"I'm delighted Luis Figo got on to the pitch for his final appearance. It was a great ball for Nuno Gomes' goal.\"\n\nBBC Sport analyst Martin O'Neill\n\nFULL-TIME: A double from Bastian Schweinsteiger helps Germany finish third at the 2006 World Cup.\n\n88 mins: GOAL Germany 3-1 Portugal\n\nNuno Gomes scores after heading in Luis Figo's peach of a ball from the right.\n\n84 mins: Cristiano Ronaldo hits a tremendous free-kick from at least 35 yards out that forces Oliver Kahn to punch the ball away.\n\n82 mins: Nuno Gomes comes close to scoring for Portugal but his effort bounces off Oliver Kahn's boot from five yards.\n\n79 mins: There will be no hat-trick for Bastian Schweinsteiger who is replaced by Thomas Hitzlsperger.\n\n78 mins: GOAL Germany 3-0 Portugal\n\nBastian Schweinsteiger scores his second goal of the night with another spanking strike. He gives Ricardo no chance from 25 yards.\n\n77 mins: Luis Figo comes on to make, possibly, his last international appearance for Portugal - the ineffective Pauleta makes way.\n\n75 mins: Portugal have not scored for 352 minutes.\n\n73 mins: Former Formula One champion Michael Schumacher is in the stands watching his German compatriots. He appears to be sitting on a racing-car seat.\n\n71 mins: Striker Mike Hanke replaces young player of the tournament Lukas Podolski.\n\n70 mins: Portugal's Nuno Valente is replaced by Nuno Gomes.\n\n67 mins: The Germany fans belt out chants of \"Jurgen Klinsmann\" in honour of their California-based coach.\n\n65 mins: Miroslav Klose, who is set to win the Golden Boot having scored five goals this tournament, is replaced by Oliver Neuville.\n\n61 mins: GOAL Germany 2-0 Portugal\n\nArmando Petit slices in Bastian Schweinsteiger's free-kick. It is going from bad to worse for the Portuguese - but at least the game's more entertaining.\n\n60 mins: Paulo Ferreira is booked after clipping Lukas Podolski's heels.\n\n56 mins: GOAL Germany 1-0 Portugal\n\nBastian Schweinsteiger fires in a scintillating shot from the edge of the area after cutting in from the left.\n\n53 mins: Pauleta is played in by Cristiano Ronaldo. The striker does everything right inside the penalty area except for produce a shot to test Oliver Kahn. The effort summed up his World Cup... poor.\n\n51 mins: Marcell Jansen fouls Maniche on the edge of the area. Simao's free-kick dips, but dips too late to trouble Oliver Kahn in the Germany goal.\n\n48 mins: Great play by Germany on the left-wing but Marcell Jansen's low cross into the area fails to find a team-mate.\n\n2100 BST: Portugal's Costinha comes off and is replaced by Armando Petit. Germany kick off the second half.\n\n\"I hope it gets better.\"\n\nBBC Sport analyst Alan Hansen.\n\nPLAYER RATER: In a half-time poll, 43% of you say Cristiano Ronaldo will be best remembered from this World Cup for his run-in with Wayne Rooney and 38% for his gamesmanship in general.\n\nHaving said that, perhaps the Player Rater public have forgiven or forgotten Ronaldo's run-in with Rooney, as he leads the way in the half-time ratings in this match with a mark of 9.32.\n\nStatistic: Portugal have gone 322 minutes without scoring.\n\n\"I think this is the most meaningless match in the history of football.\"\n\nBBC Sport analyst Martin O'Neill\n\nHALF-TIME: Not the greatest spectacle to be fair.\n\n46 mins: Cristiano Ronaldo produces a few 'lollipops' on the edge of the Germany area before going to ground. He does not win a free-kick or the support of the crowd inside the stadium.\n\n43 mins: Germany's midfield talisman Michael Ballack lets out a yawn on the squad bench.\n\n38 mins: Cristiano Ronaldo's trickery on the pitch sometimes impresses, on this occasion his attempted backheel flick arrived at the feet of Germany's Miroslav Klose. That may have cheered up England's Wayne Rooney.\n\n37 mins: A right-sided corner from Portugal's Deco eludes everybody as it flashes across goal.\n\n29 mins: Forget the fan-fests in Germany, there is a foul-fest at the Gottlieb-Daimler Stadium. The referee blows up again when Costinha fouls Sebastian Kehl on the edge of the Portugal area. The Germany players appear to thank the official for awarding the free-kick and booking the Portugal player.\n\n28 mins: Germany striker Miroslav Klose is fouled at the edge of the area by Nuno Valente. Nothing comes from the free-kick.\n\n27 mins: The Germany fans begin singing their own version of the Beatles' classic Yellow Submarine.\n\n25 mins: Portugal's Ricardo Costa is shown a yellow card after pulling back Miroslav Klose on the edge of the area. Lukas Podolski, on three goals for the tournament, has his powerful free-kick palmed away by keeper Ricardo.\n\n20 mins: Germany's Sebastian Kehl produces a cheeky dink from the edge of the area that forces Ricardo into making a tip-over save.\n\n19 mins: The predominantly Germany-supporting crowd decide to start jeering Portugal. How long before a Mexican wave?\n\n15 mins: Portugal striker Pauleta, who with one goal is unlikely to win the Golden Boot, has his shot saved by Oliver Kahn after being put through one-on-one by Simao. It is more likely he will get an iron boot from his own players if he misses more chances like that.\n\nPLAYER RATER: These teams may have mixed views over the validity of a third-place play-off, but it seems the majority of you believe it is worthwhile with 71% believing there is a need for the losing semi-finalists to play off in a showcase game.\n\n10 mins: Torsten Frings turns on a sixpence (or the German equivalent) but fires his shot wide of Ricardo's goal.\n\n8 mins: Germany's Torsten Frings is booked for a late tackle on Deco.\n\n5 mins: A Bastian Schweinsteiger corner is headed into the path of Sebastian Kehl by Christoph Metzelder. Metzelder's volleyed goalbound effort appears to hit the hand of Nuno Valente inside the area. Referee Toru Kamikawa waves play on. Germany have not been awarded a penalty in the World Cup for 12 years.\n\n1 min: Under-fire Cristiano Ronaldo wins a free-kick for Portugal. No boos from the crowd.\n\n2000 BST: Portugal kick off the third-place play-off.\n\nLINE-UPS\n\nGermany: Kahn, Jansen, Huth, Metzelder, Lahm, Schneider, Kehl, Frings, Schweinsteiger, Klose, Podolski.\n\nSubs: Asamoah, Ballack, Borowski, Friedrich, Hanke, Hildebrand, Hitzlsperger, Lehmann, Mertesacker, Neuville, Nowotny, Odonkor.\n\nPortugal: Ricardo, Paulo Ferreira, Ricardo Costa, Meira, Nuno Valente, Costinha, Maniche, Deco, Ronaldo, Pauleta, Simao.\n\nSubs: Boa Morte, Caneira, Figo, Miguel, Nuno Gomes, Paulo Santos, Petit, Postiga, Quim, Tiago, Viana."
