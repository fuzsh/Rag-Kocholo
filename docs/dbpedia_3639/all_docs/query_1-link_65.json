        "text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nRobert I (Italian: Roberto I Carlo Luigi Maria di Borbone, Duca di Parma e Piacenza; July 9, 1848 â November 16, 1907) was the last sovereign Duke of Parma and Piacenza from 1854 until 1859, until the duchy was annexed to Italy. He was a member of the House of Bourbon, descended from Philip, Duke of Parma the third son of King Philip V of Spain and Elizabeth Farnese.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n\n2 Family\n\n3 Ancestry\n\n4 References\n\n5 See also\n\n[edit] Biography\n\nBorn in Florence, Robert was the son of Charles III, Duke of Parma and Louise Marie ThÃ©rÃ¨se of France, daughter of Charles Ferdinand, duc de Berry and granddaughter of King Charles X of France. He succeeded his father to the ducal throne in 1854 upon the latter's assassination, when he was only six, while his mother stood as regent.\n\nWhen Duke Robert was eleven years old he was deposed, as Sardinian troops annexed other Italian states, ultimately to form the Kingdom of Italy.\n\nDespite losing his throne, Robert and his family enjoyed considerable wealth, traveling in a private train of more than a dozen cars from his castles at Schwarzau am Steinfeld near Vienna, to Villa Pianore in northwest Italy, and the magnificent chÃ¢teau de Chambord in France.\n\nLess than four months after Duke Robert's death in 1907 the Grand Marshal of the Austrian court declared six of the children of his first marriage legally incompetent (they were mentally retarded), at the behest of his widow, Duchess Maria Antonia. Nonetheless, Robert's primary heir was Elias, Duke of Parma, 1880-1959), the youngest son of his first marriage and the only one of his sons to father children of his own. Elias also became the legal guardian of his six elder siblings. Although the eldest half-brothers, Sixte and Xavier, eventually sued their half-brother Elias for trying to obtain a greater share of the ducal fortune, they lost in the French courts, leaving the issue of Robert's second marriage with modest prospects.\n\nSome of his younger sons served in the Austrian armed forces.\n\n[edit] Family\n\nIn 1869, in exile, he married Princess Maria Pia of the Two Sicilies (1849-1882), daughter of king Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies. Maria Pia belonged to the deposed Royal Family of the Two Sicilies, and was thus a Bourbon, like her husband.

Prince Joseph (Giuseppe), Duke of Parma June 30 1875 January 7, 1950 Titular Duke of Parma 1939-1950.

Maria Pia died giving birth to this child.\n\nIt is not clear whether the last two children were mentally retarded also, like their other six older siblings.\n\nAfter his first wife's death in childbirth, he remarried in 1884 to Maria Antonia of Portugal, daughter of the deposed Miguel I of Portugal and Adelaide of LÃ¶wenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg.
