        "text": "Hidden Gems: Jewellery Stories from the Saleroom (Photo: The Court Jeweller)\n\nLate last year, I reviewed Vincent Meylan’s latest book, which focused on Christie’s sale archives in their 250th anniversary year. This week, I got my hands on another book produced to mark that anniversary, Hidden Gems: Jewellery Stories from the Saleroom. The book is a fascinating look at the inner workings of historic jewelry sales from two people who have experienced it firsthand.\n\nA peek at a chapter on Russian jewels (Photo: The Court Jeweller)\n\nHidden Gems was written by Sarah Hue-Williams and Raymond Sancroft-Baker, who worked together at Christie’s. The firsthand knowledge that the pair bring to the book makes the text feel immediate and warm. They call the piece a “jewellery storybook,” which is an excellent description of the tome’s tone. Hue-Williams and Sancroft-Baker recall numerous moments of surprise and astonishment during their work at the auction house, especially when clients would produce incredible pieces of jewelry that had been hidden away for years. The tales they tell will undoubtedly be the envy of every jewel lover who cracks open the book.\n\nA peek at a section of jewels of the former Begum Aga Khan (Photo: The Court Jeweller)\n\nThe text is divided into short, thematic chapters. Some focus on individual jewelers or collectors, while others center on specific types of gems or individual sales. Readers of this blog will particularly enjoy the sections on the Duke of Manchester’s tiara sale, Marie Antoinette’s rubies, the emeralds that were part of the French crown jewel collection, and Princess Margaret’s modern jewelry. The book features a foreward by the Earl of Snowdon (then Viscount Linley), who worked closely with the jewelry department at Christie’s during the sale of his mother’s jewels.\n\nHidden Gems: Jewellery Stories from the Saleroom (Photo: The Court Jeweller)\n\nThe book is a little bit smaller than many coffee-table jewel books, but it’s just as packed with interesting content and beautiful pictures as any of my larger books. Even so, the production is similar in quality to some of the largest, most expensive jewelry books in my library. It’s also a bit more affordable than many royal jewel books, retailing right now on Amazon for under $50. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed reading the book, and I’d highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest, casual or serious, in royal and historical jewelry.\n\nNote: I purchased this book using revenue that I received from the Amazon affiliate links on this site. I put all money that I receive from these affiliate links back into materials for review on the blog, so if you want to read more reviews, consider purchasing items through the links on this site. Thanks, everybody!\n\nChristie’s: The Jewellery Archives Revealed (Photo: The Court Jeweller)\n\nWhen a major new book on historical jewelry is due to be published right before your birthday, you know that the fates are smiling on you. To celebrate my birthday today, I’m going to give all of you a peek inside Vincent Meylan’s stunning new book, Christie’s: The Jewellery Archives Revealed!\n\nAs the title suggests, Meylan has been granted access to the archives of one of the most famous auction houses in the world, and he’s produced a beautiful book detailing many of the fabulous jewelry sales that happened inside their auction rooms. From royals to aristocrats to movie stars, the book covers a range of jewelry auctions at Christie’s from the past two and a half centuries.\n\nPhoto: The Court Jeweller\n\nThe text is divided into themed sections (like “The French Court,” “Gems from the East,” and even, yikes, “Murdered Queens”) and then into smaller “chapters” on the jewels belonging to a specific woman or group of women. The book is thoroughly illustrated, both with large, detailed photographs and with pages from auction catalogues, many of which are marked with pencil notations. Above, you get a peek inside a section on auctioned jewels with links to Josephine de Beauharnais. (I know you’ll recognize that tiara!)\n\nFor devoted royal jewel lovers, the book covers well-known auctions, like the sales of the French and Russian crown jewels. The cover of the book features another well-known royal jewel: the original Cambridge Lover’s Knot Tiara, which was auctioned by Christie’s in 1981. But we also get small tidbits of information that help flesh out our knowledge of various pieces. I was intrigued, for example, by the discussion of a 1937 auction of one of the fleur-de-lys elements that once sat atop Norway’s Maltese Circlet.\n\nPhoto: The Court Jeweller\n\nAnd here’s a glimpse of one of my favorite sections, which discusses jewels worn by Queen Victoria’s granddaughters. Meylan has matched up a photograph of the royal box at the 1937 coronation with records from the archives, and he details precisely which jewels were later sold at Christie’s. It’s completely fascinating. Another favorite feature: the appendix which lists, by date, auctions at which jewels with prominent provenances were sold.\n\nThe book is expensive — definitely a gift purchase rather than something you’d buy on a lark. (Though Amazon is currently selling it for 25% off the advertised retail price!) But for your money, you get a large, weighty coffee-table sized tome. The paper is good quality, and the book feels expensive when you read it. The book was published by the Antique Collectors’ Club, which was also responsible for royal jewelry books like Geoffrey Munn’s Tiaras: A History of Splendour and Meylan’s 2014 book on Van Cleef and Arpels. This would be a perfect holiday present for someone who loves jewelry, history, and beautiful things. If you read this blog regularly, I can guarantee that you’d love it. I’m still having fun savoring it!\n\nNote: I purchased this book using revenue that I received from the Amazon affiliate links on this site. (So, really, it came from all of you: thank you!)

Thanks, everybody!\n\nImage courtesy of Christie’s\n\nThe November 10 jewelry auction at Christie’s in Geneva doesn’t just include a major noble tiara. The sale also features several pieces of jewelry with royal provenances. Here’s a look at some of the jewels on offer.\n\nImage courtesy of Christie’s\n\nLot 396: Princess Josephine’s Pearl Earrings\n\nThese nineteenth-century pearl earrings, which are set with large button-shaped natural saltwater pearl drops, also feature diamonds set in gold and silver. They belonged to Princess Josephine of Belgium, who was the sister of King Albert I of Belgium.\n\nImage courtesy of Christie’s\n\nPrincess Josephine (pictured wearing the earrings above) married Prince Karl Anton of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (a brother of King Ferdinand I of Romania) in 1894, and the auction notes for the earrings imply that they may have been among her wedding gifts. Josephine died in 1958; there’s no indication of precisely how the earrings changed hands after her death or who is selling them now. Christie’s estimates that the earrings will sell for between $48,000 and $68,000. The auction also includes a pair of pearl earrings (Lot #395) that belonged to Josephine’s mother, the Countess of Flanders.\n\nImage courtesy of Christie’s\n\nLot 398: Queen Margherita’s Pearl Necklace\n\nThis double-stranded pearl necklace originally belonged to Margherita of Savoy, the wife of King Umberto I of Italy. It’s made of 95 natural saltwater pearls, and the two strands are joined by a clasp made of a single pearl and diamonds set in silver and gold.\n\nImage courtesy of Christie’s\n\nThe chain of ownership offered by the auction catalogue goes as follows: Queen Margherita of Italy, who bequeathed the pearls to her daughter-in-law, Queen Elena (who wears them in the postcard pictured above). Elena left them to her youngest daughter, Princess Maria Francesca of Savoy, who died in 2001. She bequeathed the pearls to her daughter, Princess Chantal of Bourbon-Parma, who appears to be the person who has put them up for sale. Christie’s expects the pearls to sell for a whopping $500,000-700,000.\n\nImage courtesy of Christie’s\n\nLot 399: Princess Hélène’s Emerald Necklace\n\nAnd now, for the big one: the diamond and emerald necklace that belonged to Princess Hélène of Orléans, Duchess of Aosta. The necklace was made around 1810; the auction notes highlight similarities between the necklace and other French imperial jewels made by Nitot and Bapst. The notes especially point out the resemblance between parts of the necklace and the grand emerald necklace now owned by the Norwegian royals. The piece features Colombian emeralds interspersed with diamonds and is set in gold and silver. The necklace was a gift to Princess Hélène on her marriage to Prince Emanuele Filiberto, 2nd Duke of Aosta in 1895. The gifter was Helene’s godfather, Prince Henri of Orléans, Duke of Aumale; he was a noted art and jewelry collector.\n\nImage courtesy of Christie’s\n\nHenri also gave Hélène a coordinating diamond and emerald tiara; that jewel is not in this sale. (Hélène wears both the necklace and the tiara in the portrait above.) At some point after World War I, the necklace was acquired by the 5th Marquess of Cholmondeley. It was worn by his glamorous wife, Sybil Sassoon. (Trivia: the actor Jack Huston is their great-grandson.) After Sybil’s death, the necklace was auctioned at Christie’s in London. A quarter century later, the necklace is for sale again; this time around, Christie’s expects it to fetch between $1.5 million and $2.5 million."
