        "text": "Princess Maria Francesca of Savoy | Royal Italy| Marriage Prince Guy of Bourbon-Parma Royal Wedding\n\nMaria Francesca, principessa di Savoia, was born in Rome as the fifth and youngest child of the king and queen of Italy, Victor Emmanuel III and Elena of Montenegro.\n\nShe lent the diamond fleur de lys tiara to the bride of her son Prince Guy of Bourbon-Parma when he married Brigitte Peu-Duvallon on 11 November 1964 as the wedding tiara.\n\nIn the background, on the right side is Princess Maria Francesca of Savoy, Princess of Bourbon-Parma, with a large string of pearls and a pearl drop and diamond earrings which was given to her from her mother.\n\nThe pearl earrings are Art Deco style, with large baroque pearl drops weighing circa 100 grains each. These earrings come from Queen Elena of Italy, born Princess of Montenegro (1873-1952), wife of King Victor-Emmanuel III of Italy. They were at some point given by Queen Elena to her youngest daughter, Princess Maria-Francesca of Savoy (1914-2001), who married Prince Louis of Bourbon-Parma 1899-1967.\n\nThe earrings have been sold, as well as the diamond tiara, which I saw at the Biennale de Antiquaires in Paris; there whereabouts are unknown."
