        "text": "Chapter I: Of Good and Bad Luck\n\nIn 1654 Te Deums were sung across the Holy Roman Empire for the recovery of Ferdinand IV, the King of Romans, from the smallpox. However, the illness left the face of the King horribly disfigured – so much that the King (and later the Emperor) covered his face in public with finely crafted silver mask – and even despite this, the nickname of “the Ugly” stuck to the future Kaiser.\n\nThe recovery caused Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor, to hurry the marriage negotiations between his son and Infanta Maria Teresa of Spain. The Spanish bride arrived in Vienna on October 25, 1654, after the marriage by proxy took part in August.\n\nThe parades and pageantry in Vienna contrasted with the sadness in Paris, where Dowager Queen Anne of Austria has long wanted a Spanish match for her 16-years old son, Louis XIV. Now the idea of match is gone. Maria-Teresa was now the Queen of Romans, and was soon to be the Holy Roman Empress. And her remaining Spanish niece, Margareta Teresa, is barely a toddler of 3, too young even for Duc d’Anjou, not even speaking of the King.\n\nMaybe if she marries Louis off right away, the Dauphin will be fit enough to marry Margareta? After all, the age difference would be 4 years, maybe 5, if Louis is unlucky. But to whom? Orleans girls? Mademoiselle de Montpensier – always a troublemaker, and she’s 11 years older than Louis. Maybe she would string him along – and her reputation of rebel does not help. Mademoiselle d’Orleans? Maybe… She’s of the right age, 16, that’s old enough for childbearing age. And the rest are hunchback and two kids – though Mademoiselle de Valois and Mademoiselle de Chartres can have their use, especially the youngest one. The peace with Spain needs to be signed anyways. And if her brother has a son… one of those little girls can well become the Spanish Queen. Provided there wouldn’t be any kids from Louis by then.\n\nNow let’s look at foreign candidates… First, two cousins. Margarita Violante of Savoy – good agewise, though Anne disliked her mother. But anyway, mother at home has a lot more influence than a mother-in-law in Savoy. Henriette of England? An exile and too young. Maybe old enough for Philippe, but Louis needs kids, and needs them now. Infanta Catalina of Portugal? An alternative to Savoyard girl, but a bad one – if the peace with Spain is not signed yet, then seeking Portuguese match is too impractical right now. The negotiations can be opened with Savoy, and opened right now…\n\nAnne opened the window. Louis walked the garden with young lady – well, he’s a teenager, and he has all the urges of youth. The lady? Maria Mancini, niece of her dear Julio, recently returned from exile with her uncle. And Louis seems infatuated with her. Well, anyways, a Mancini is not a Queen material. Especially not now, when the war with Spain rages on…\n\nFour years after: Summer 1658. Blois\n\n“Oh these ever-demanding Savoyards…” – Anne signed reading the letter from her sister-in-law. The Savoy court now demanded double marriage – Duke Charles Emmanuel to Mademoiselle d’Orleans and Margarita Violante to Louis. That was… good, if not for Louis now wanting to marriage the Savoyard girl at all. The Mancini brat seemed to take over his mind.\n\nJulio told her that Maria was predicted to cause all kinds of trouble, by some horoscope, and that her mother even asked him to lock Maria up. Well, it seems she was right. The Queen was informed that Marie wanted to keep the relationship chaste… But Louis! Louis openly wanted her for Queen, saying that “maybe Philippe marries the Savoyard”. The boy is 20, he is the King, but he needs some discipline!\n\nThe news of the loss of Spaniards at the Dunes were the good news. Now, maybe this traitor Conde can crawl back to France for Royal pardon, after his self-esteem suffered so damaging blow. And his also means… Means that she can betroth Mademoiselle de Chartres, the youngest Petite-Fille de France [1] to Felipe Teodosio [2], Prince of Asturias, born in 1655. Of course, the boy is sickly and with somewhat a huge head, not to mention too small of a stature – dwarves are found at court as jesters, not as Royal offspring! Her brother did not do well after he took the rejected bride of her son for a wife. Of course, there are always Austrians – the new Emperor pretty much rules from his deathbed, but he managed to sire two girls – twins, Maria-Teresa and Anne-Eleonora, the last year. And one of these brats will grab Felipe Teodosio, especially since his younger brother, Diego Prospero [3], is horribly sickly – the Prince of Asturias is a dwarf, but his brother suffers from epilepsy.\n\n“Mother, may I enter?”\n\n“Of course you can, Your Majesty! Sit down, Louis, we need to talk.”\n\n“About me leaving Marie to marry a Savoyard? First of all, she’s a daughter of a mere Duke… I have good ears, Mother. And I can listen. I have talked to Cardinal, he’s not against the marriage in principle. After all, Savoyards…”\n\n“Are the strategic allies if Your Majesty’s armies need a push for Milan.”\n\n“She’s almost a spinster! Her younger sister was married off before her for a reason. Her mother… my aunt, must have known something about health of her daughter, if she allowed her younger sister to marry the Elector of Bavaria before her!”\n\n“You will marry her. The end. The Papal Dispensations have already arrived.”\n\n…In December 1658 the double match was celebrated with pomp – Margherite Violante of Savoy married the King of France, and Marguerite Louise d’Orleans married the Duke of Savoy. The marriage cemented the alliance which was to strike the deathblow to Spain. Marie Mancini so far remained at Louis’ court, even though her being made lady-in-waiting to new Queen was infuriating to her. But she continued to see Louis in private, content with being his maitresse-en-titre – virgin so far, even though there was an idea to make her the Duchess d’Enghien, after the peace treaty with Spain will be signed.\n\nThe Pheasants Isle treaty between Louis XIV and Felipe IV was signed in July 1659 [4]. France gained Roussillon and Perpignan, Montmédy and other parts of Luxembourg, Artois and other towns in Flanders, including Arras, Béthune, Gravelines and Thionville, and a new border with Spain was fixed at the Pyrenees. However, the treaty stipulated only that all villages north of the Pyrenees should become part of France. The historic town of Llívia, once the capital of Cerdanya, was exempted from the treaty and became a Spanish exclave as part of the comarca of Baixa Cerdanya, the Spanish province of Girona. On the western Pyrenees a definite borderline was drawn and decisions made as to the politico-administrative affiliation of bordering areas in the Basque region—Baztan, Aldude, Valcarlos.\n\nSpain was forced to recognise and confirm all of the French gains at the Peace of Westphalia.\n\nIn exchange for the Spanish territorial losses, the French king pledged to quit his support for Portugal and renounced to his claim to the county of Barcelona, which the French crown had claimed ever since the Catalan Revolt (also known as Reapers' War). The Portuguese revolt in 1640, led by the Duke of Braganza, was supported monetarily by Cardinal Richelieu of France. After the Catalonian Revolt, France had controlled Catalonia from January 1641, when a combined Catalan and French force defeated the Spanish army at Battle of Montjuïc, until it was defeated by a Spanish army at Barcelona in 1652. Though the Spanish army reconquered most of Catalonia, the French retained Catalan territory north of the Pyrenees.\n\nDespite France and Savoy pushing more strongly in Milan, the Milanese gains were to be withdrawn as a condition of treaty, as Italian gains of France were to be returned to Spain as a dowry for eventual French bride of Prince of Asturias – either Mademoiselle de Chartres or the eventual child of Queen of France, as Margherite Violante carried the child who may as well be the Princess.\n\nThe support for Portugal clause also was the half-hearted ones, as negotiations for the match between the King of Portugal and Mademoiselle d’Alencon were ongoing, with French court being reluctant to quit this matter. However, soon the drama was to befall the French court.\n\nOctober 1, 1659. Louvres. Queen’s Bedchamber\n\n“Good news, Your Majesty. Your wife has delivered a fine Dauphin… But…”\n\n“What “but!” Order the Te Deums! The Savoyard has done her duty…”\n\n“Yes. But she’s struck with fever, and it’s unlikely she will push through. The Court Physician has arrived to relieve her suffering!”\n\n“To make her bleed… Like the first wife of my uncle, the mother of that Grand Rebel.”, - Louis thought to himself. He had a son. A heir. And the Savoyard… well, he’ll live without her…\n\n…The agony of Margherite Violante lasted for three days. She was truly of frailer health than her sisters, but thankfully the Dauphin, Louis, showed no signs of poor health, taking after his father. Margherite was buried in Saint Denis on October 20, Queen of France for less than a year.\n\nNow, Louis XIV was free to remarry. And he surprised everyone – stating that his new wife and stepmother to Dauphin will be not a Stuart or Braganza princess – but Maria Mancini. His childhood love. The very idea apparently caused Anne of Austria to have a mild case of strike, but after all, the Dauphin will have the Royal Blood, so it is unlikely for a Mazarin’s grandnephew to ever become the King of France.\n\n[1] In OTL she died in 1656, TTL, she lives through.\n\n[2] OTL Infanta Maria Ambrosia born a boy, and even healthy by standards of Habsburg - if not for the fact he's a clinical dwarf. Think more realistic (without impossible-for-dwarf physical feats) Tyrion Lannister as the future King of Spain.\n\n[3] OTL Felipe Prospero\n\n[4] In OTL Spain and France reached the agreement in November, here Milanese campaign is a bit more successful with Savoy support, and the negotiations are reached by July.\n\nChapter II: Two Crowns for two Mancinis\n\nThe small wedding at the Louvre chapel in April 1660 was attended by unlikely guest – the exiled king of England and Scotland, Charles II. Charles has been pursuing a French bride, however he had no interest in Mademoiselle de Montpensier and thought Mademoiselle de Valois, her younger half-sister and the only of four surviving daughters of Marguerite de Lorraine not married or betrothed so far, a little young for him.\n\nHowever Charles has approached Cardinal Mazarin, asking him for the hand of his niece, Hortense. The Cardinal was not against this – given how his other niece, the prosperized troublemaker, has just became the Queen of France. And the prospects of Charles’ restoration were not too dim, either. The only condition were that the marriage will take place only once Charles will be enthroned – to not to spoil the restoration negotiations.\n\nHowever, there was another spanner in the works – Henriette Maria, Dowager Queen of England, who did not forget how badly Mazarin treated her as exile. She did not want a commoner in her son’s bed, even though she would be given a dowry of a Princess – 5 million livres. However, even more than this she did not want two commoners in her sons’ beds – as she has heard of idiotic idea of James Duke of York promising the marriage to a certain Anne Hyde, she strongly demanded her son the King to block this match.\n\n“The Hydes do not need even more empowerment”, as she stated to his son regarding the marriage prospects. So with heavy heart Charles told James that he will not marry a commoner – after all, Charles himself did not marry the late Lucy Walter. He, however, could keep Anne as his principal mistress. The issue of future Duchess of York was pressing – Mademoiselle de Montpensier was an interesting prospect, but so was the Princess of Beira, especially since the Portuguese were desperate for an ally after the Peace of Pyrenees brought the match to the standstill.\n\nIn July 1660 Charles II warmly welcomed his new Queen, Hortense Mancini, in Dover. The Queen, despite being a Papist and a niece of Catholic cardinal, cared more about entertainment than religion, and was even seen at Anglican ceremonies. In the same month the negotiations between courts in London and Lisbon were opened about the new Duchess of York. The idea about Portuguese Queen of England was alive since 1640ies, but now Luisa de Gusman had to settle for the Duke of York. Well, for Portuguese economy that meant that they have to spend less money.\n\nThe dowry for the new Duchess of York was agreed on 23 June 1661, a marriage treaty was signed; England acquired Catherine's dowry of the Seven islands of Bombay (the latter having a major influence on the development of the British Empire in India), together with trading privileges in Brazil and the East Indies, religious and commercial freedom in Portugal and one million Portuguese crowns (about £150,000); while Portugal obtained military and naval support against Spain and liberty of worship for Catherine. Catherine journeyed from Portugal to Portsmouth on 13–14 May 1662, but was not visited by the Duke of York there until 20 May. The next day the couple were married at Portsmouth in two ceremonies—a Catholic one conducted in secret, followed by a public Anglican service. The same marriage arrangement was followed a year before for Hortense Mancini and King Charles II.\n\nHaving married to a Catholic himself, and having securing a Catholic Duchess of York for his brother, Charles II decided on Protestant alliance for his remaining brother, Duke of Gloucester [1]. Henry was adamant about marrying a Protestant – the top candidates included Anna Sophia of Denmark, Erdmuthe Sophie of Saxony and Maria Orange-Nassau. The surprising move in 1661 was made by Erdmuthe Sophia’s father, Elector Johann Georg II. Originally he wanted a semi-domestic match for Erdmuthe, with Margarve of Brandenburg-Bayerth. However, the idea of Danish match for his heir interested the Elector even more, and he could not stand the British court to “steal” the Princess from him. So in September 1661 the agreement was reached with Saxony court, with the agreed dowry for the Duchess of Gloucester being 400 000 golden crowns – small one compared to the dowry of Queen or Duchess of York. The new Duchess arrived to Portsmouth in July 1662, continuing the wedding season started by the marriage of Duke of York.\n\nThe sisters to the King [2] were another matter, the one causing much headache. The marriage of the youngest, Minette, to the Duc d’Orleans went almost seamlessly, even though the dowry of the new Duchesse was somewhat recycled from the one of the Queen. Louis XIV was happy to receive some of Mazarin gold back (though the principal heiress of the Cardinal was his new Queen), not so happy to not have Dunkirk to be included in the Henrietta’s dowry. The marriage was consummated in January 1661, a year after the second marriage of Louis XIV.\n\nThe problematic one was the elder, Mary, Dowager Princess of Orange. The good news was that she abandoned her favorite, Baron Dover. However, she found a more interesting companion in Prince Rupert of the Rhine, newly created Duke of Cumberland. The spark between 40-years old prince and 30-years old princess appeared in winter of 1661, when Rupert went so far as to nurse the Princess back to health after she felt sick [3]. In April 1661 Mary asked her brother for permission to become the Duchess of Cumberland, with the clause being that she will return to England permanently once her son is of age, and that Rupert will act as a co-regent of Principality of Orange, for which she needed the French help until now. The petition was granted, however it caused the tensions in Netherlands, as the prospect of British (or Palatinate, but spending his entire life in Britain) stepfather to the future Stadtholter was not that interesting to some in the Estates General. The education of Willem now became a fight between the Estates General and his British maternal relatives, a fight that will soon go to the battlefield.\n\nIn France, the new Queen, Marie Mancini, welcomed her first child in the world on April 18, 1661– a girl, Madame Royale, christened Louise Marie. The birth was complicated, with the threat that Louis XIV would be a widower once again. On the same day it became known that her sister Hortense, recently Queen of England, is pregnant, and on October 25, 1661 a boy, named Charles and created Prince of Wales, was born.\n\n[1] Survived 1660 TTL.\n\n[2] Yes, plural, as Mary did survive as well.\n\n[3] Survived, but with scarred face and probably barren (though I would let dices decide on this one)\n\nChapter III: Of Dwarves, Hunchbacks and Empresses\n\nBy 1663 Felipe IV had mixed feelings about the Prince of Asturias. In general, Felipe Teodosio showed remarkable health, especially compared to two “bewitched” siblings Queen Mariana produced afterwards – while Diego Prospero died in 1661, the youngest of surviving children, Carlos Felix of Spain, was suffering from multiple disabilities, and many expected him to follow his elder brothers, Infantes Diego Prospero and Fernando Carlos, to early grave. On the contrary, Felipe Teodosio was a lively boy, as healthy as the previous Prince of Asturias, Baltasar Carlos, was at this age of 7. The only problem was his height. The Prince has the typical physique of a dwarf, with disproportionally huge head on small body, and by estimations of court physicians, would not be taller than 4 feet as an adult. Well, better the dwarf than the imbecile, but… There goes the glory of dynasty.\n\nRegarding the French match, Felipe had mixed feeling. On the one hand, one was promised by the Treaty of Pyrenees. On the other hand, there were Austrian cousins and nieces for the Prince, or even half-aunts… But then, the alliance with Austria was already cemented, and despite the death of Ferdinand IV in 1660 and his ability to father only two Archduchesses with his Spanish wife, Maria-Teresa remarried in 1661 with the urging from her father to Ferdinand’s successor and brother, Leopold I. From this match she already had healthy, if a bit pudgy, infant, christened Ferdinand Wenzel, born in May 1663, and was hoping for further children.\n\nBetween Mademoiselle de Chartres and Madame Royale, the youngest daughter of Gaston d’Orleans was much better match. A child of 11 was better than a toddler of 2, even disregarding that his French nephew got himself into morganatic marriage with this Italian woman. Of course, the Dauphin Louis was born from “true” wife, even though he was too young to think of him as a groom for Margareta Teresa, whose future match was of much headache for the King. The Austrian court already got an Infanta for Empress, there was no need for another one. Kings of France and England were already with wives, even though of commoner stock. Bavaria? Taken. Afonso of Portugal? This imbecile usurper? No way!\n\nIn 1662 a proposal arrived from Italy – the hand of Margareta Teresa of Spain was sought by Cosimo Medici, the Grand Prince of Tuscany. Of course, the Infanta was barely 11, while the Prince was 20, but it was agreed by the parties as profitable, with Infanta being sent to Tuscany in 1665 to become the Grand Princess. The same year, which will be proven the last one for Felipe IV, the bride handover ceremony was held at the Pheasants Isle, with 13-years old Marie Anne d’Orleans, Mademoiselle de Chartres, formally becoming Maria Ana de Orleans, Princess of Asturias – and the Queen of Spain since the next year, when her father-in-law died finishing the marriage arrangements for his children.\n\nMeanwhile, the French court was in the middle of marriage dramas. Since 1659 Louis XIV had to be the arbiter in the “Ladies’ War” raging in the court of Savoy after the double marriage of himself to Savoyard princess and of Marguerite Louise d’Orleans to the Duke of Savoy. While “dear Margot” was quick to pump out the Hereditary Prince Charles Amadeus in December 1659, she was always at odds with her aunt and mother-in-law, Dowager Duchess Christine Marie, who agreed to Marguerite as a Duchess only to round up the marriage between the now-late Margherite Violante and Louis. Christine felt herself “cheated”, saying until her very death in 1663 that Mademoiselle d’Alencon or Mademoiselle de Valois would have made the better Duchesses, not to mention Savoy-Nemours branch.\n\nHowever, the untimely death of Duke Charles IV of Lorraine of stroke allowed his nephew, Prince Charles of Lorraine, to inherit the title, and he was enthroned as the Duke of Lorraine in 1662. The same year he married the elder of the two Nemours princesses, Marie Jeanne Baptiste. In order to keep the status of Looraine as French protectorate, the match was arranged by its proponents at the French Court, first of all the Queen Mother, Anne of Austria.\n\nHowever, this was not the only marriage of interest at the French court. In December 1662 Claire Clemence, the Princess of Conde, succumbed to smallpox. The widowed Prince soon found consolation in his Fronde-times companion, Duchesse de Montpensier, who in April 1663 expressed the want to become the Princess of Conde. Surprisingly, the match between two symbols of Fronde was taken better than expected in Paris – after all, Duc d’Enghien was already married to Anne Henriette of Bavaria, first cousin once removed of English king, the same year, and this there was no fear than Montpensier and Conde-Montmorency riches will be united in the same hands for longer than a couple of decades. In July 1663 the marriage was celebrated with great pomp, and in December the new Princess of Conde announced her first – and alas, the last – pregnancy.\n\nOn July 24, 1664 Anne-Marie-Louise d’Orleans, Princess of Conde and Duchesse de Montpensier, went into labor. Sadly, the same complications that killed her mother 37 years before, combined with the advanced age of first labor, proved to be fatal for her. Anne-Marie-Louise died on July 27, with her daughter, Anne Louise Benedicte de Bourbon, Mademoiselle de Montpensier, inheriting her mother’s vast fortune at the age of mere 3 days. [1]\n\nThe Grand Conde has never remarried, Duchesse d’Enghien becoming surrogate mother for her little half-sister-in-law. In April 1665 Louis XIV approached the Prince with proposal of betrothal between Anne Louise de Bourbon and his second son, Philippe Jules, Duc d’Anjou, born on December 18, 1664. While Conde wanted to see “the Heiress of Fronde” as the Dauphine, Louis was against the domestic match for his first son, but was amenable for the greatest heiress of France for the second one. But so far this was only the negotiation regarding the two toddlers.\n\nBy 1665 Louis XIV was no longer madly in love with his second wife. He was getting older, and the childbirths became to ruin the “Beautiful Marie”, making it easier to concentrate on other women. In 1663 his relationship with a certain Louise de La Valliere was made public, around the time Marie Mancini miscarried her second child. The Queen’s ambitions regarding the prestigious marriage for her brother Philippe, Duc de Nevers and de Mayenne [3], also were getting on the King’s nerves – Marie wanted Philippe to marry either Mademoiselle de Valois (or d’Alencon, provided she is not taken by the Portuguese court, with which the negotiations resumed after death of Felipe IV), or Mademoiselle de Nemours, Marie-Francoise of Savoy-Nemours, younger sister of the Duchesse de Lorraine.\n\nLouis was pissed off because he considered Philippe to be good for nothing, and even removed him from command of the Mousquetaries de Roi, the position Philippe showed no ability or inclination for. With reconciliation between King and Queen in 1665 it was possible that the prestigious wife will be found for Philippe, but so far it seemed unlikely.\n\nIn April 1666 the marriage by proxy was finally signed – between Mademoiselle de Valois and King Afonso VI of Portugal, but as the cousin of the Sun King left for Portugal, the tragedy happened. On May 2, 1666, at 4:30 AM, Afonso of Portugal was found dead on the flight of stairs in the Ribeira Palace, leading to his private chamber. Given the King’s physical infirmity, the death was attributed to the accident, especially since no signs of violence were found on the body. However, the theories that somebody “helped” the crippled king to break his neck, became ones of the most popular in Portuguese history of the XVII century.\n\nThe new King, Pedro II, pronounced that he will respect the marriage arrangement with the French Princess and will marry Mademoiselle de Valois. The new negotiations postponed the arrival of Francoise Madeleine to Portugal till April 1667, where Queen Francesca Magdalena (as she was now known) was met with enthusiasm.\n\nThe rejected Portuguese candidates, Marie-Francoise of Savoy and Elisabeth-Marguerite d’Alencon, found domestic matches. For Marie-Francoise her older sister, Hereditary Princess de Lorraine, arranged the marriage with Louis-Joseph de Guise, Duc de Guise, in May 1667. As for Elisabeth-Marguerite, she was married to Charles-Paris d'Orleans-Longueville, Duc de Longueville, who was of suitable rank for Petite-Fille de France. The Queen's intrigues for prestigeous match for her brother so far came to naught, especially since Louis had other reasons to hate \"The Italian Upstart\".\n\nHowever, the family drama was not the thing most on the mind of the Sun King. Since 1663 he was a lukewarm signatory of the coalition of German princes and Holy Roman Emperor against the Ottoman Porta - lukewarm given the Porta being time-honored ally against Habsburgs. Since military successes of 1664 the Ottoman diplomacy began to apply the pressure on French court to remove them from the conflict, but they were outplayed by the Austrian court - Louis was offered the hand of Archduchess Maria-Teresa, the eldest daughter of the late Ferdinand IV, for the Dauphin, and some offers regarding the status of Lorraine, which Louis wanted fully annexed. By 1666 the process of Hungary liberation has became somewhat of European crusade, with even the King of England joining the war effort - officially in support of Elector of Saxony, his relative by marriage, Charles II sent a small contingent of 8,000, commanded by his brother the Duke of Gloucester, to aid Gloucester's father-in-law the Reichmarshal. The Hungarian campaign also became a trial by fire for Charles' illegitimate son, James Scott, Duke of Monmouth, who accompanied his uncle Gloucester, and was considered the start of the path of Monmouth as one of the finest British generals of XVII century.\n\nHowever, by 1667, as the Turks were able to regroup and manage couter-offence, the events began to brew in the North of Europe, changing the political landscape. What started as a family matter in the House of Orange, soon was to grow into conflict engulfing many European countries.\n\n[1] Life is not fair, and so are dice.\n\n[2] OTL the titles of Duc de Mayenne and de Mazaren were given to husband of Hortense Mancini, TTL, since Hortense is the Queen of England, all the titles go to Philippe Mancini after his uncle’s death.\n\nChapter IV: On Storms and Serenity\n\nIf there was anything the Italian Queen of Charles II was good at, it was her fertility: from October 1661, when Charles, Prince of Wales, was born, till 1667, Hortense Mancini gave her husband 4 more children – Mary-Henriette, Princess Royal, in January 1664, Henry, Duke of Clarence and Ross, twin of the above, Elisabeth-Sophia, Princess of England, in October 1665, and Philip Julius, Duke of Kendal and Kintyre, in August 1666. That was clearly no final count of the Royal nursery population, Queen being clearly fertile, being from family that saw 8 children to live to adulthood.\n\nThe same was not true about Duchesses of York and Gloucester, who only had 3 miscarriages between two in the same time period. While the wife of the Duke of York was a petite sad woman content with her tea parties and small circle of friends, the Duchess of Gloucester was more interesting person – if only for the fact that she was one of the first two women among founding members of the Royal Society – the second being her friend Margaret, Duchess of Newcastle. The two women had one thing in common, besides their health not being ideal for childbearing – love of history and natural philosophy, and the philosophic disputes between the two high born ladies became the unusual treat to the Society members.\n\nThe Duke of Gloucester, despite the failure of his Saxon wife to give him living children, did, however, show remarkable fidelity to his “German Minerva”, as Erdmuthe-Sophie was nicknamed at court. That was in stark contrast with his brothers the King – who has been sleeping with Barbara Palmer aside despite being married to the pretty and fertile Queen, and the Duke of York – in whose bed Anne Hyde was replaced by a certain Arabella Chrurchill, a \"tall creature, pale-faced, and nothing but skin and bone.\" Gloucester had no official mistress, and this, coupled with his pronounced Low Church sympathies, made him popular with the Country party.\n\nBy 1667 Charles II was the only male descendant of Charles I to have legitimate issue – however, his sisters, Duchesse d’Orleans and Dowager Princess of Orange, now Duchess of Cumberland, did not do bad as well. Henriette had four surviving children – Marie Louise d’Orleans, Mademoiselle d’Orleans, born in 1662, Philippe Charles d’Orleans, Duc de Valois, born on July 16, 1664, and twins – Henriette Agnes d’Orleans, Mademoiselle de Chartres (known as Mademoiselle de Valois since 1667 after the previous Mlle de Valois became Queen of Portugal) and Louis Alexander, Duc de Chartres, born on July 9, 1665 [1]. The birth of twins caused significant strain to Henriette, though thankfully the personal physician of Prince of Conde and formerly of Queen Christine of Sweden, a certain Bourdelot, was able to nurse her back to health. However, it was declared that the twins are likely her last children, and the Duc and Duchesse parted amicably, the Duc d’Orleans returning to the company of his favorites led by the infamous Chevalier de Lorraine (and including the Duc de Mazaren as well, despite Louis XIV loathing to see “despicable creature” of his brother-in-law anywhere near her brother).\n\nMary Stuart, meanwhile, managed to have two children with Rupert from 1663 to 1666 – Lady Elisabeth of Cumberland, Princess Palatine of the Rhine, born on March 29, 1663, and Robert William, Earl of Holderness and Prince Palatine of the Rhine, born on December 25, 1665 (both a Christmas present and the belated birthday for Rupert). Young William of Orange adored his step-siblings, and got along pretty well with his stepfather, who put the emphasis on the military education of the young man, wanting him to be “fine soldier first, fine statesman second”, in the vein of his granduncle Maurice of Orange.\n\nThe Anglo-Palatinate stepfather of the Prince of Orange showed the remarkable interest in Orangist faction powerbase, knowing the grandmother of William since she was a lady-in-waiting to Rupert’s mother and nursed baby Rupert during the flight to Netherlands from Bohemia after the Winter King’s unlucky and short reign. He also communicated with the Stadtholder of Friesland, William’s uncle William Frederick of Nassau-Dietz – Friesland did not like to be dictated from Holland, and William Frederick could have been the easy candidate for Stadtholder office, if not for his role in military coup preceding the death of William II.\n\nThe position of the Orangists was the precarious one – while they could easily count for English support (and back in London a lot of people would have been enthusiastic about the war, including Cumberland himself and the Duke of York, who were the major shareholders of many English trade companies, competing with the Dutch ones), that made them look like traitors at home.\n\nBy 1666 the conflict became inevitable – minor raids of Dutch shipping were performed by the British privateers, and the refusal to give William III any major military or political office, as he was nearing the majority, was seen at London as the insult to English royal family themselves. The only considerations so far were the precarious position of the English “White Elephant” of Dunkirk and the raging plague in England, which took almost the year to die down. The spread of plague and the Great Fire of London of 1666 were blamed on the Dutch, which was popularly supported. However, the problem was the position of France, bound to assist the Dutch in war with England in case England attacks, and the need to consider it.\n\nBut by winter 1667 the war, waged so far unofficially in colonies, was moving to Europe.\n\n[1] In OTL there was stillborn girl in 1665 and stillborn male twins in 1667, here there is a bit more luck."
