        "text": "Fun with Mike and Rene\n\nIsabella and Ferdinand\n\nWhen Alfonso V died in 1458, all of his territories, including the island of Sicily, were left to his brother John II. John now had a stronger position than every before and no longer needed the security of Henry's friendship. Henry was now in need of a new alliance. He saw the change for this much needed new friendship in Charles IV of Navarre, another son of John II of Aragon. Charles was constantly in dispute with his father and because of this he secretly entered into an alliance with Henry IV of Castile. A major part of the alliance was that a marriage was to be arranged between Charles and Isabel. The fact that Isabel was only ten years old and Charles was nearly forty was never considered an issue. When John II learned of this arranged marriage he was outraged. Isabel was had been destined for his favorite son, Ferdinand, and in his eyes this alliance was still valid. John II had his son Charles thrown in prison with charges of plotting against his father's life and the marriage never came to be.\n\nIn 1464 an attempt was made to marry Isabel to Alfonso V of Portugal, Henry's brother-in-law. Through the medium of the Queen and Count of Ledesma, a Portuguese alliance was made. Isabel, however, was weary of the marriage and refused to consent.\n\nA civil war broke out in Castile over King Henry's inability to act as sovereign. Henry now needed a quick way to please the rebels of the kingdom. As part of an agreement to restore peace, Isabel was to be betrothed to Pedro Giron, Maestre de Calatrava and brother to the King’s favorite Don Juan Pacheco. In return the Master would pay into the ompoverished royal treasury an enourmous sum of money. Seeing little other choice to find the peace he desperately needed, Henry agreed to the marriage. Isabel was aghast and prayed to God for the marriage to never come to pass. Her prayers were answered when Don Pedro suddenly fell ill and died while on his way to meet his fiancée.\n\nWhen Henry recognized Isabel as his heir on 19 September 1468, he also promised that his sister should not but compelled to marry against her will, while she in return agreed to obtain his consent. It seemed that finally the years of failed attempts at political marriages were over. There was talk of a marriage to a brother of Edward IV of England but this alliance was never seriously considered. Once again in 1468, a marriage proposal arrived from Alfonso V of Portugal. Going against his promises made in September, Henry tried to make the marriage a reality. If Isabel married Alfonso, Henry's daughter Joanna would marry Alfonso's son John II and thus, after the death of the old king, John and Juana could inherit Portugal and Castile.[ Isabella refused and made a secret promise to marry her cousin and very first betroth, Ferdinand of Aragon.\n\nAfter this failed attempt Henry once again went against his promises and tried to marry Isabel to Louis XI’s brother Charles, Duke of Berry. In Henry's eyes this alliance would cement the frienship of Castile and France as well as remove Isabel from Castilian affairs. Isabel once again refused the proposal. Meanwhile John II of Aragon negotiated in secret with Isabel a wedding to his son Ferdinand.\n\nOn 18 October 1469, the formal betrothal took place. Because Isabel and Ferdinand were second cousins they stood within the the prohibited degrees of consanguinity and the marriage would not be legal unless a dispensation from the Pope was granted. With the help of Rodrigo Borgia (later Alexander VI) Isabel and Ferdinand were presented with a supposed Papal Bull by Pius II authorizing Ferdinand to marry within the third degree of consanguinity, making their marriage legal. Isabel escaped the court of Henry with the excuse of visiting her brother Alfonso's tomb in Ávila. Ferdinand, on the other hand, crossed Castile in secret disguised as a merchant. Finally, on 19 October 1469 they married in the Palacio de los Vivero in the city of Valladolid.\n\nIsabel’s reign was off to a rocky start from the very beginning. Because of her brother's choice to name Isabel as his successor, when she ascended to the throne in 1474, there were already several plots against her. The Marquis of Villena and his followers maintained that the Infanta Joanna, daughter of Henry VI, was the rightful queen. Shortly after the Marquis made his claim, a long time supporter of Isabel, the Archbishop of Toledo left court to plot with his great-nephew the Marquis. The Archbishop and Marquis made plans to have the Infanta Joanna marry her uncle, King Alfonso V of Portugal and invade Castile to claim the throne for themselves.\n\nIn May of 1475, Alfonso and his army crossed into Spain and advanced to Palsencia and here he married the young Joanna. A long and bloody war for the Castilian succession took place hereafter. The war went back and forth for almost a year until March of 1476 when the Battle of Toro took place. It was here that Isabel’s husband Ferdinand and his army made such a victory that it was clear that Isabel’s Spain was going to win the war. Although Isabel’s side had gained a great victory, the war drug on for another three years.\n\nIn August of the same year, Isabel proved her abilities as a powerful ruler on her own. A rebellion broke out in Segovia and Isabel rode out to suppress it, as her husband was off fighting at the time. Going against the better judgment of her male advisors, Isabel rode by herself into the city to negotiate with the rebels. She was successful and the rebellion was quickly brought to an end. Two years later, Isabel also secured her place as ruler a bit more with the birth of her son John, Prince of Asturias on June 30, 1478. To many, the presence of a male heir legitimized her place as ruler. The war with Portugal did not officially end until September of 1479. At this time, four separate treaties were signed at Alcáçovas. Under these treaties Portugal abandoned all claims to Castile Isabel and Ferdinand agreed to pardon all rebellious subjects who had supported Joanna and Alfonzo. Isabel had proven herself to be a fighter and tough monarch from the start. Now that she had succeeded in securing her place on the Castilian throne, she could now begin to make the reforms that the kingdom desperately needed.\n\nAt the end of the Reconquista, only Granada was left for Isabel and Ferdinand to conquer. The Emirate of Granada had been held by the Muslim Nasrid emirate since the mid-thirteenth century. Protected by natural barriers and fortified towns, it had withstood the long process of the reconquista. On 1 February 1482, the king and queen reached Medina del Campo and this is generally considered the beginning of the war for Grandada. While Isabel's and Ferdinand's involvement in the war was apparent from the start, Granada's leadership was divided and never able to present united front. However, it still took ten years to conquer Granada, culminating in 1492.\n\nThe Spanish monarchs recruited soldiers from many European countries and improved their artillery with the latest and best cannons. Systematically, they proceeded to take the kingdom piece by piece. In 1485 they laid siege to Ronda, which surrendered after only a fortnight due to extensive bombardment. The following year, Loja was taken, and again Muhammad XII was captured and released. One year later, with the fall of Málaga, the western part of the Muslim Nasrid kingdom had fallen into Spanish hands. The eastern province succumbed after the fall of Baza in 1489. The siege of Granada began in the spring of 1491 and at the end of the year, Muhammad XII surrendered. On 2 January 1492 Isabella and Ferdinand entered Granada to receive the keys of the city and the principal mosque was reconsecrated as a church. The Treaty of Granada signed later that year was to assure religious rights to the Muslims, which did not last.\n\nColumbus\n\nAfter continually lobbying at the Spanish court and two years of negotiations, he finally had success in 1492. Ferdinand and Isabella had just conquered Granada, the last Muslim stronghold on the Iberian Peninsula, and they received Columbus in Córdoba, in the Alcázar castle. Isabella turned Columbus down on the advice of her confessor, and he was leaving town by mule in despair, when Ferdinand intervened. Isabella then sent a royal guard to fetch him and Ferdinand later claimed credit for being \"the principal cause why those islands were discovered\".\n\nAbout half of the financing was to come from private Italian investors, whom Columbus had already lined up. Financially broke after the Granada campaign, the monarchs left it to the royal treasurer to shift funds among various royal accounts on behalf of the enterprise. Columbus was to be made \"Admiral of the Seas\" and would receive a portion of all profits. The terms were unusually generous, but as his son later wrote, the monarchs did not really expect him to return.\n\nAccording to the contract that Columbus made with King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, if Columbus discovered any new islands or mainland, he would receive many high rewards. In terms of power, he would be given the rank of Admiral of the Ocean Sea and appointed Viceroy and Governor of all the new lands. He had the right to nominate three persons, from whom the sovereigns would choose one, for any office in the new lands. He would be entitled to 10% of all the revenues from the new lands in perpetuity; this part was denied to him in the contract, although it was one of his demands. Additionally, he would also have the option of buying one-eighth interest in any commercial venture with the new lands and receive one-eighth of the profits.\n\nOn the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from Palos de la Frontera with three ships; one larger carrack, Santa María, nicknamed Gallega (the Galician), and two smaller caravels, Pinta (the Painted) and Santa Clara, nicknamed Niña after her owner Juan Niño of Moguer. They were property of Juan de la Cosa and the Pinzón brothers (Martín Alonso and Vicente Yáñez), but the monarchs forced the Palos inhabitants to contribute to the expedition. Columbus first sailed to the Canary Islands, which were owned by Castile, where he restocked the provisions and made repairs. On 6 September he departed San Sebastián de La Gomera for what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean.\n\nA lookout on the Pinta, Rodrigo de Triana (also known as Juan Rodriguez Bermeo), spotted land about 2 a.m. on the morning of October 12, and immediately alerted the rest of the crew with a shout. Thereupon, the captain of the Pinta, Juan Alonso Pinzón, verified the discovery and alerted Columbus by firing a lombard. Columbus later maintained that he himself had already seen a light on the land a few hours earlier, thereby claiming for himself the lifetime pension promised by Ferdinand and Isabella to the first person to sight land.\n\nColumbus called the island (in what is now The Bahamas) San Salvador; the natives called it Guanahani. Exactly which island in the Bahamas this corresponds to is an unresolved topic; prime candidates are Samana Cay, Plana Cays, or San Salvador Island (so named in 1925 in the belief that it was Columbus's San Salvador). The indigenous people he encountered, the Lucayan, Taíno or Arawak, were peaceful and friendly. From the 12 October 1492 entry in his journal he wrote of them, \"Many of the men I have seen have scars on their bodies, and when I made signs to them to find out how this happened, they indicated that people from other nearby islands come to San Salvador to capture them; they defend themselves the best they can. I believe that people from the mainland come here to take them as slaves. They ought to make good and skilled servants, for they repeat very quickly whatever we say to them. I think they can very easily be made Christians, for they seem to have no religion. If it pleases our Lord, I will take six of them to Your Highnesses when I depart, in order that they may learn our language.\" He remarked that their lack of modern weaponry and even metal-forged swords or pikes was a tactical vulnerability, writing, \"I could conquer the whole of them with 50 men, and govern them as I pleased.\"\n\nColumbus also explored the northeast coast of Cuba (landed on 28 October) and the northern coast of Hispaniola, by 5 December. Here, the Santa Maria ran aground on Christmas morning 1492 and had to be abandoned. He was received by the native cacique Guacanagari, who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind. Columbus left 39 men and founded the settlement of La Navidad at the site of present-day Môle-Saint-Nicolas, Haiti. On 13 January 1493 Columbus made his last stop in the New World. He landed on the Samaná Peninsula where he met the hostile Ciguayos who presented him with his only violent resistance during his first voyage to the Americas. Because of this, and the Ciguayos' use of arrows, he called the inlet where he met them the Bay of Arrows (or Gulf of Arrows). Today the place is called the Bay of Rincon, in Samaná, the Dominican Republic. Columbus kidnapped about 10 to 25 natives and took them back with him (only seven or eight of the native Indians arrived in Spain alive, but they made quite an impression on Seville).\n\nColumbus headed for Spain, but another storm forced him into Lisbon. He anchored next to the King's harbor patrol ship on 4 March 1493 in Portugal. After spending more than one week in Portugal, he set sail for Spain. He crossed the bar of Saltes and entered the harbor of Palos on 15 March 1493. Word of his finding new lands rapidly spread throughout Europe.\n\nColumbus apparently tried hard to find the mainland of the new continent he discovered in his second journey he found Florida apparently and discovered the OTL New Orleans area and started the Spanish settlement in the region.\n\nMiguel Da Paz\n\nIsabella, Princess of Asturias (2 October 1470 – 24 August 1498) was the Queen Consort of Portugal and the eldest daughter and heiress presumptive of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile. Her younger sisters were Catherine, Queen of England, Queen Joanna I of Castile, and Maria, Queen of Portugal.\n\nIn 1490 Isabella married Afonso, Crown Prince of Portugal, the heir of John II of Portugal. Though it was an arranged marriage, Isabella and Afonso quickly fell in love, and Isabel was grief-stricken when he died in 1491: sent home to her parents by John II, she declared that she would never marry again, and would enter a convent. Her parents ignored this, and in 1497 she was persuaded to marry to Manuel I of Portugal, Afonso's uncle and John II's cousin and successor. She did so on condition that Manuel followed her parents' policy and expelled the Jews who would not convert to Christianity from his realm. This he duly did. In the same year, she became Princess of Asturias and heiress of Castile, following the death of her only brother, John (Juan), Prince of Asturias.\n\nMiguel da Paz, Prince of Portugal and Prince of and son of King Manuel I of Portugal and his first wife Isabella of Asturias (1470-98). He was recognised as heir both to his father's kingdom of Portugal, and to his grandparents' kingdoms of Castile, León and Aragon. As such, he was styled Prince of Portugal, Prince of Asturias and Prince of Girona.\n\nHe was born in Zaragoza, Spain on August 24, 1498 and his mother died during childbirth. For the next two years he was the heir to the throne of both Portugal and Spain.\n\nHe survives to adulthood and was arranged to be married to Rene of France.\n\nAnne of Brittany\n\nAnne of Brittany's first marriage began badly: she brought two beds with her when she came to marry Charles, and the King and Queen often lived apart. She was anointed and crowned Queen of France at Saint-Denis on 8 February 1492; she was forbidden by her husband to use the title \"Duchess of Brittany\", which became a bone of contention between the two. When her husband fought in the wars in Italy, the regency powers were exercised by his sister Anne of Brittany of Beaujeu. Pregnant for most of her married life, Anne of Brittany lived primarily in the royal castles of Ambois, Loches and Plessis or in the towns of Lyon, Grenoble or Moulins (when the king was in Italy). She became Queen of Sicily and titular Queen of Jerusalem with the conquest of Naples by Charles VIII.\n\nThe marriage produced four living children, none of whom survived early childhood. Only the first, Charles Orland (11 October 1492 – 16 December 1495), survived infancy. A healthy and intelligent child, he was doted on by his parents, who both suffered terrible grief when he died suddenly of the measles. After him was born Charles, who lived for less than a month; and Francis and Anne of Brittany, who each died almost immediately after being born. These tragedies caused a great deal of pain to Anne of Brittany, who prayed openly for a son after the death of Francis.\n\nAround her, there was a famous circle of court poets: among them the Italian humanist Publio Fausto Andrelini from Forlì, who spread the New Learning in France.\n\nWhen Charles VIII died in 1498, Anne was 21 years old and childless. Legally, she was now obliged to marry the new king, Louis XII; however, he was already married, to Joan, daughter of Louis XI and sister to Charles VIII. On 19 August 1498, at Étampes, she agreed to marry Louis if he obtained an annulment from Joan within a year. If she was gambling that the annulment would be denied, she lost: Louis's first marriage was dissolved by the Pope before the end of the year.\n\nIn the interim, in October 1498, Anne returned to rule Brittany. She restored the faithful Philippe de Montauban to the chancellery of Brittany, named the Prince of Orange as Hereditary Lieutenant General of Brittany, convened the Estates of Brittany, and ordered production of a coin bearing her name. She took the opportunity to tour the Duchy, visiting many places she had never been able to see as a child. She made triumphal entries into the cities of the duchy, where her vassals received her sumptuously.\n\nAnne's third marriage ceremony, on 8 January 1499 (she wore white, setting a precedent for future brides), was concluded under conditions radically different from those of the second. She was no longer a child, but was a dowager queen, and was determined to ensure the recognition of her rights as sovereign duchess from now on. Although her new husband exercised the ruler's powers in Brittany, he formally recognized her right to the title \"Duchess of Brittany\" and issuing decisions in her name.\n\nAs Duchess, Anne fiercely defended the independence of her Duchy. She arranged the marriage of her daughter, Claude, to Miguel da Paz of Iberia in 1501, to reinforce the Franco-Spanish alliance and ensure French success in the Italian Wars; however, Louis broke off the marriage and had Renee married to Miguel da Paz instead when it became likely that Anne would not produce a male heir. Instead, Louis arranged a marriage between Claude and the heir to the French throne, Francis of Angoulême. Anne, determined to maintain Breton independence, refused until death to sanction the marriage, pushing instead for Claude to marry Miguel da Paz, or for the Duchy to be inherited by her other daughter, Renee. The marriage of Claude and Francis eventually took place in the year following Anne's death.\n\nMiguel da Paz merges the three crowns\n\nIt was originally Claude of France who was the one who should had married Miguel da Paz but the marriage failed to happen and the Cortez had just ravaged Mexico and Miguel da Paz married Rene of France in 1525 in the condition that Rene of France gives up her claims on Brittany and Rousillon, Val d’Aran and Cerdagne ceded to France, Miguel da Paz and Renee of France have a son named Duarte(Edward) born on April 6 1526 and a daughter named Maria born on April 8 1528.\n\nBecause of Miguel da Paz inheriting Iberia he became powerful because of his inheritance of all of Iberia and he inherited all of the Spanish and Portuguese colonies in Asia, Africa and the Americas.\n\nControversies in Miguel da Paz’s reign\n\nRenee decided in 1530 to go back to France with her children to raise them in France and Miguel da Paz falls for Anne Boleyn, the lady in waiting of Claude of France, he has a son with Anne Boleyn named Duarte Pio Born in June 6 1531.\n\nJoanna and Nicolas\n\nJoanna decided to flee to France after she knew that there is no way to defeat castile in 1478, In 1480 Joanna decided to give up her claims to the Castilian throne nd she married Nicolas the Count of Provence and the Duke of Lorraine they have a daughter named Francesca born in January 6 1482, who was married to Philbert after his wife Yolande died in 1499 who became Philbert II of Savoy later Francesca gives birth to Charles I of Provence and Savoy in January 6 1501, he would inherit both Piedmont, Savoy and Provence he would create the Kingdom of Piedmont-Provence he marries Beatrice of Portugal, the younger sister of Miguel Da Paz in 1520 they have a son named Emanuel in August 5 1522 who is betrothed to Maria of Portugal the son of Emanuel and Maria, Roger/Ruggero of Provence and Savoy born on 1445 who later married Elisabeth of Valois which produced a line of Savoy dukes with the claim to French and Spanish thrones.\n\nExhiled Rose\n\nEdward of Westminister does not go back to England and Catherine of Navarre marries Edward of Westminister in 1490, Edward of Westminister was granted Gascony after the death of Duke Du Berry in the condition that he will never claim the English throne this would have started the Plantagenet rulers of Navarre with their son Henry II Plantagenet of Navarre born on April 19, 1492. Who later married Margaret of Valois which marriage produced Jeanne Plantagenet or other born in June 5 1528 who married Anthony Bourbon in 1548, Jeanne Plantagenet or Joan of Aquitaine was a staunch Calvinist in July 15, 1551 Henry Bourbon of Navarre was born, he will be called Henry the Conqueror or Henri le Conquerant.\n\nHenry II\n\nHenry was born in the royal Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near Paris, the son of Francis I and Claude, Duchess of Brittany (daughter of Louis XII of France and Anne, Duchess of Brittany).\n\nHis father was captured at the Battle of Pavia in 1525 by his sworn enemy, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and held prisoner in Spain.[2] To obtain his release it was eventually agreed that Henry and his older brother be sent to Spain in his place. They remained in captivity for three years.\n\nHenry married Catherine de' Medici (13 April 1519 – 5 January 1589) on 28 October 1533, when they were both fourteen years old. The following year, he became romantically involved with a thirty-five-year-old widow, Diane de Poitiers. They had always been very close: she had publicly embraced him on the day he set off to Spain, and during a jousting tournament, he insisted his lance carry her ribbon instead of his wife's. Diane became Henry's most trusted confidante and, for the next twenty-five years, wielded considerable influence behind the scenes, even signing royal documents. Extremely confident, mature and intelligent, she left Catherine powerless to intervene. She did, however, insist that Henry sleep with Catherine in order to produce heirs to the throne.\n\nWhen his elder brother, Francis, died in 1536 after a game of tennis, Henry became heir to the throne. He succeeded his father on his 28th birthday and was crowned King of France on 25 July 1547 at Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Reims.\n\nHenry's reign was marked by the persecution of the Protestant Huguenots. Henry II severely punished them, particularly the ministers: burning them at the stake or cutting off their tongues for uttering heresies. Even those only suspected of being Huguenots could be imprisoned. The Edict of Châteaubriant (27 June 1551) called upon the civil and ecclesiastical courts to detect and punish all heretics and placed severe restrictions on Huguenots, including the loss of one-third of their property to informers, and confiscations. It also strictly regulated publications by prohibiting the sale, importation or printing of any unapproved book. It was during the reign of Henry II, Huguenot attempts at establishing a colony in Brazil were made, with the short-lived formation of France Antarctique.\n\nHe survived longer and seen his sons die a cruel death and see Elisabeth of Valois married to Roger of Savoy and his grandson Henry Emanuel who was born on May 5,1466, He saw Henry Emanuel grow up and he groomed him to be the future king but Henry Emanuel was never able to be the King of France because of Henry II retracted his will for Henry Emanuel to be a king but Henry of Navarre would be the king of France after his death in 1480.\n\nHenry VII, Henry VIII and Valois England\n\nHenry VII also made some political capital out of his Welsh ancestry; for instance, in attracting military support and safeguarding his army's passage through Wales on its way to the Battle of Bosworth. He came from an old-established Anglesey family which claimed descent from Cadwaladr (in legend, the last ancient British king)] and on occasion, Henry displayed the red dragon of Cadwaladr. He took it, as well as the standard of St George, on his procession through London after victory at Bosworth. A contemporary writer and Henry's biographer, Bernard André, also made much of Henry's Welsh descent.\n\nIn reality, however, his hereditary connections to Welsh aristocracy were not strong. He was descended by the paternal line, through several generations, to Ednyfed Fychan, the seneschal (steward) of Gwynedd and through this seneschal's wife to Rhys ap Tewdwr, the King of Deheubarth in South Wales.\n\nHis more immediate ancestor Tudur ap Goronwy had aristocratic land rights but his sons, who were first cousins to Owain Glyndwr, sided with Owain in his revolt. One son was executed and the family land was forfeited. Another son, Henry's great grandfather, became a butler to the Bishop of Bangor. Owen Tudor, the son of the butler, like the children of other rebels, was provided for by Henry V, a circumstance which precipitated his access to Queen Catherine of Valois.\n\nNotwithstanding this lineage, to the bards of Wales, Henry was a candidate for Y Mab Darogan - 'The son of Prophesy' who would free the Welsh from oppression.\n\nIn 1456, his father, Edmund Tudor, was captured while fighting for Henry VI in South Wales against the Yorkists. He died in Carmarthen Castle, three months before Henry was born. Henry's uncle, Jasper Tudor, the Earl of Pembroke and Edmund's younger brother, undertook to protect the young widow, who was 13 years old when she gave birth to Henry. When Edward IV became King in 1461, Jasper Tudor went into exile abroad. Pembroke Castle, and later the Earldom of Pembroke, were granted to the Yorkist William Herbert, who also assumed the guardianship of Margaret Beaufort and the young Henry.\n\nHenry VIII lived in the Herbert household till 1469, when Warwick, the 'Kingmaker', went over to the Lancastrians. Herbert was captured fighting for the Yorkists and executed by Warwick.[15] When Warwick restored Henry VI in 1470, Jasper Tudor returned from exile and brought Henry to court. When the Yorkist Edward IV regained the throne in 1471, Henry fled with other Lancastrians to Brittany, where he spent most of the next 14 years.\n\nThe first concern Henry had was to secure his hold on the throne. His claim to the throne was that he was the last reasonably legitimate male descendant of Edward III.\n\nHe honoured his pledge of December 1483 to marry Elizabeth of York. They were third cousins, as both were great-great-grandchildren of John of Gaunt. The marriage took place on 18 January 1486 at Westminster. The marriage unified the warring houses and gave his children a strong claim to the throne. The unification of the houses of York and Lancaster by this marriage is symbolized by the heraldic emblem of the Tudor rose, a combination of the white rose of York and the red rose of Lancaster. It also ended future discussion as to whether the descendants of the fourth son of Edward III, Edmund, Duke of York, through marriage to Phillipa, heiress of the second son, Lionel, Duke of Clarence, had a superior or inferior claim to those of the third son John of Gaunt, who had held the throne for three generations. In addition, Henry had Parliament repeal Titulus Regius, the statute that declared Edward IV's marriage as invalid and his children illegitimate, thus legitimizing his wife. Amateur historians Bertram Fields and Sir Clements Markham have claimed that he may have been involved in the murder of the Princes in the Tower, as the repeal of Titulus Regius gave the Princes a stronger claim to the throne than his own. Alison Weir, however, points out that the Rennes ceremony, two years earlier, was possible only if Henry VII and his supporters were certain that the Princes were already dead.\n\nHenry VII's second action was to declare himself king retroactively from the day before Bosworth Field. This meant that anyone who had fought for Richard against him would be guilty of treason. Thus, Henry VII could legally confiscate the lands and property of Richard III while restoring his own. However, he spared Richard's nephew and designated heir, the Earl of Lincoln. He also created Margaret Plantagenet, a Yorkist heiress, Countess of Salisbury sui juris. He took great care not to address the baronage, or summon Parliament, until after his coronation. At the same time, he almost immediately afterwards issued an edict that any gentleman who swore fealty to him would, notwithstanding any previous attainder, be secure in his property and person.\n\nHenry secured his crown principally by dividing and undermining the power of the nobility, especially through the aggressive use of bonds and recognisances to secure loyalty. He also enacted laws against livery and maintenance, the great lords' practice of having large numbers of \"retainers\" who wore their lord's badge or uniform and formed a potential private army.\n\nHenry VII was threatened by several rebellions in the next few years. The first was the Stafford and Lovell Rebellion of 1486, which collapsed without fighting.\n\nIn 1487, Yorkists led by Lincoln rebelled in support of Lambert Simnel, a boy who was claimed to be the Earl of Warwick, son of Edward IV's brother Clarence (who was actually a prisoner in the Tower). The rebellion was defeated and Lincoln killed at the Battle of Stoke. Henry made the boy Simnel a servant in the royal kitchen.\n\nIn 1490, a young Fleming, Perkin Warbeck, appeared and claimed to be Richard, the younger of the \"Princes in the Tower\". Warbeck won the support of Edward IV's sister Margaret of Burgundy. He led attempted invasions of Ireland in 1491 and England in 1495, and persuaded James IV of Scotland to invade England in 1496. In 1497 Warbeck landed in Cornwall with a few thousand troops, but was soon captured and executed.\n\nIn 1499, Henry VII had the Earl of Warwick executed. However, he spared Warwick's elder sister Margaret. She survived till 1541, when she was executed by Henry VIII.\n\nHenry VIII became impatient with Catherine's inability to produce the heir he desired. All of Catherine's children died in infancy except their daughter Mary. Henry wanted a male heir to consolidate the power of the Tudor dynasty, Catherine dies of cancer sadly and Henry dies of a horse accident in 1439 and Mary of England marries Charles d’Angouleme in 1539 which was approved by Henry VIII before he died, the marriage of Mary and Charles only produced a daughter named Mary, Mary II of England born in January 6 1540 who married the King of Spain Duarte in 1560, Mary was deposed and her sons disinherited of the English throne once Henry of Navarre conquered England once he asserts his rights for the throne in 1580 after he becomes the King of France after the death of Henry II..\n\nReign of Duarte of Spain\n\nDuarte of Spain’s era was known to be an era of tolerance and expansion and he would sign a treaty of tolerance in Spain for the Protestants and he married Mary II of England and his son Duarte, the future Duarte II was born in February 2 1561 after Duarte and Mary II are married in 1560.\n\nUnification of France and England\n\nJacqueline of Scotland born in June 19 1566, the daughter of Mary Queen of Scots, and Grand Daughter of Henry VII of England marries Henry of Navarre in 1590 after the death of Margaret of Valois and he converts to Catholicism the throne of England, Scotland and France had been merged with them Henry III of France conquers England from Mary he asserts that he is the true Lancastrian heir not the Tudors and he becomes known as Henry the Conqueror or Henri Le Conquerant, They would have two children Louis born in September 6, 1591 and Marie born in October 6 1592."
