        "text": "“Religious literature has eminent examples, and if we run over our private list of poets, critics, philanthropists and philosophers, we shall find them infected with this dropsy and elephantiasis, which we ought to have tapped.”\n\n—Ralph Waldo Emerson (18031882)\n\n“The recent attempt to secure a charter from the State of North Dakota for a lottery company, the pending effort to obtain from the State of Louisiana a renewal of the charter of the Louisiana State Lottery, and the establishment of one or more lottery companies at Mexican towns near our border, have served the good purpose of calling public attention to an evil of vast proportions.”\n\n—Benjamin Harrison (18331901)\n\n“Weigh what loss your honor may sustain\n\nIf with too credent ear you list his songs,\n\nOr lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open\n\nTo his unmastered importunity.”\n\n—William Shakespeare (15641616)\n\n“Having a thirteen-year-old in the family is like having a general-admission ticket to the movies, radio and TV. You get to understand that the glittering new arts of our civilization are directed to the teen-agers, and by their suffrage they stand or fall.”\n\n—Max Lerner (b. 1902)\n\n“The only road to the highest stations in this country is that of the law.”\n\n—William Jones (17461794)"
