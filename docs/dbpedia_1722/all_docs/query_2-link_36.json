        "text": "\"Minot\" redirects here. For other uses, see Minot (disambiguation).\n\nCity in North Dakota, United States\n\nMinot ( MY-not) is a city in and the county seat of Ward County, North Dakota, United States,[5] in the state's north-central region. It is most widely known for the Air Force base approximately 15 miles (24 km) north of the city. With a population of 48,377 at the 2020 census,[3] Minot is the state's fourth-most populous city and a trading center for a large part of northern North Dakota, southwestern Manitoba, and southeastern Saskatchewan. Founded in 1886 during the construction of James J. Hill's Great Northern Railway, Minot is also known as \"Magic City\", commemorating its remarkable growth in size over a short time.\n\nMinot is the principal city of the Minot metropolitan area, a metropolitan area that covers McHenry, Renville, and Ward counties[6] and had a combined population of 77,546 at the 2020 census.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMinot came into existence in 1886, after the Great Northern Railway laid track through the area. A tent town sprang up overnight, as if by \"magic\", giving Minot its first nickname, the Magic City; in the next five months, the population increased to over 5,000, further bolstering the nickname.[7]: 39 [8]: 129 The town site was chosen by the railroad to be placed on the land of homesteader Erik Ramstad, who was convinced to relinquish his claim and became one of the city leaders. The town was named after Henry Minot, a Great Northern investor, ornithologist, and friend of Hill. Its Arikara name is niwaharít sahaáhkat,[9] and its Hidatsa name is maagada'ashish (\"Plum Coulee\").[10]\n\nThe city was incorporated on July 16, 1887. The Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad (Soo Line) later built a line from Valley City to Canada. While initially their plan was to cross the Souris River at Burlington, local interests and arguments convinced them otherwise; landholders along the new route donated the right-of-way, and the Soo Line reached Minot in 1893.\n\nOn July 22, 1920, a tornado passed over Minot and bore down in a coulee three miles (5 km) southeast of town.[11] The tornado picked up Andy Botz's home and hurled it to the ground, killing his wife, breaking Botz's shoulder, and slightly injuring the two Botz children who were in the house.[11]\n\nMinot and its surrounding area were wide open from 1905 to 1920. The population grew rapidly due to railroad construction and availability of unclaimed land. Nearly complete court records of Ward County and Minot document the prevalence and different types of criminal activity, and offer strong support for the epithet \"crime capitol of North Dakota\". State attorney general William Langer helped clean up the town in 1917–1920, but by the time Prohibition arrived in the 1920s, Minot had become a center of illegal activities associated with the High Third district, exacerbated because the city was a supply hub of Al Capone's liquor smuggling operations. The hotbed of alcohol bootlegging, prostitution, and opium dens that sprang up in the downtown area soon led people to nickname Minot \"Little Chicago\". Smugglers used a network of tunnels (some previously built for heating or deliveries) to transport and conceal illicit cargo entering from Canada.[12]\n\nThe 1950s saw a large influx of federal funding into the region, with the construction of Minot Air Force Base (1956–1957) thirteen miles (21 km) north of the city, and Garrison Dam (1947–1953) on the Missouri River, about fifty miles (80 km) south. In 1969, a severe flood on the Souris River devastated Minot in April.[13] Afterward, the Army Corps of Engineers straightened the river's path through the city and built several flood control structures.\n\nOn January 18, 2002, a severe train derailment west of the city sent a gigantic cloud of anhydrous ammonia toward Minot and Burlington. One man died and many of Minot's citizens were sickened and severely injured by the gas, causing one of the worst major chemical accidents of the country.[14] In early 2006, court cases were heard in Minneapolis, Minnesota, against Canadian Pacific Railway, the owner of the derailed train. The anhydrous ammonia spill was the largest such spill in U.S. history. Eric Klinenberg used the incident in his book Fighting for Air: The Battle to Control America's Media as an example of the failure of mass media, specifically local radio stations, to disseminate information in an emergency.[15]: 1–14\n\nThe 2011 Souris River flood caused extensive damage throughout the Souris River Valley. On June 21, 2011, KXMC-TV reported that a flood of historic proportions was imminent in the valley, largely due to large dam releases upstream. Around 12,000 people were evacuated. On June 26, flooding exceeded previous records when the river crested at 1,561.7 feet (476.0 m) above sea level, three feet (0.9 m) above the previous record set in 1881. It is estimated that 20% of Minot sustained damage from the flood; this figure includes over 4,100 homes that were in some way affected, 2,376 extensively damaged, and 805 damaged beyond repair. Burlington was also severely damaged during this time.[16][17]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 17.45 square miles (45.20 km2), of which 17.43 square miles (45.14 km2) is land and 0.02 square miles (0.05 km2) is water.[18]\n\nNeighborhoods\n\n[edit]\n\nMinot is commonly divided into three major sections: North Hill, the Mouse River Valley and South Hill. North Hill is the area roughly north of Eleventh Avenue North and Northwest Avenue. South Hill is a broad area south and west of Valley Street and Fifth Avenue South. West of Sixth Street West, South Hill dips sharply to the southwest. South Hill's limits are less clearly defined than North Hill's. Though the neighborhood levels out past 16th Street South, the name South Hill is generally applied to all areas south up to the city limits. Neighborhoods in the Mouse River Valley include Bel Air, Downtown, Eastwood Park, Oak Park and West Minot.\n\nRegion\n\n[edit]\n\nMinot is on the Drift Prairie of northwestern North Dakota. It is at ,[19] about 100 miles (160 km) north of Bismarck. The Mouse River, or Souris River, runs through the city west to east.\n\nImportant cities in the region for which Minot is the trading center include Burlington, Velva, Garrison, Stanley, Bottineau, Rugby, and New Town.\n\nMinot is almost entirely land; the Mouse River, its oxbow lakes, and a few creeks take up just 0.14% of the city's area.\n\nThe elevation of the river at the city center is 1,540 feet (470 m) above sea level.[20][failed verification] The valley sits 160 feet (49 m) below the surrounding plains; the elevation at the Minot International Airport on North Hill is 1,716 feet (523 m). The city has several small horseshoe-shaped oxbow lakes within its limits near the river, created by the Mouse's meandering course.\n\nGrid and address system\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city is laid out on a grid-based street system. Streets run north-south and avenues run east-west. Streets are numbered by their block distance east or west of Main Street. Avenues are numbered north and south of Central Avenue. There are four city quadrants (NW, SW, SE, NE) to designate the location of any address. Main Street addresses are designated North and South. Central Avenue addresses are designated East and West. The grid system carries over into the rural areas of Ward County, making the county one of only three that do not follow the statewide grid system (the others are Burleigh County and Grand Forks County).\n\nMouse River\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Mouse River divides the city approximately in half, north and south. The valley rises to the plains both north and south of the river. Although there are names for certain features of these hills, such as Anthony Hill on South Hill, there are no general names for these topographical features. The northern rise and the plateau north of it are called North Hill and the southern rise and plateau south of it are called South Hill.[21]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Climate of North Dakota\n\nMinot experiences a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen: Dwb) in its marginal zone receiving sufficient precipitation for such category. Like Central Asia, it exhibits great temperature variation.[22] Summers range from warm to moderately hot, with frequent thunderstorm activity. Winters are typically bitterly cold and snowy, with high winds and below-freezing temperatures for weeks at a time. Lows below 0 °F (−18 °C) occur on about 39 days during the winter, while temperatures reach 90 °F (32 °C) on 14 days per summer, and in some years reach 100 °F (38 °C).[23] The average annual snowfall total is 42.5 inches (108 cm).[24]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1890575—19001,277122.1%19106,188384.6%192010,47669.3%193016,09953.7%194016,5773.0%195022,03232.9%196030,60438.9%197032,2905.5%198032,8431.7%199034,5445.2%200036,5675.9%201040,88811.8%202048,37718.3%2022 (est.)47,759[4]−1.3%\n\n2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the census of 2020, there were 48,377 people, 20,979 households, and 9,978 families residing in the city.

As mayor he chairs the 7-member City Council, but only casts a vote to break a tie. City Manager Harold Stewart handles the city's day-to-day affairs.\n\nMinot uses the council–manager system of government. Seven councilmen are elected from 7 city wards to four-year terms. Elections are arranged such that one councilman from each ward is elected every even-numbered year. The mayor is elected to a four-year term as well; the last mayoral election was in 2022. All city offices are nonpartisan.\n\nCity elections are held in June in North Dakota, along with the state primary election.\n\nNorthwest Area Water Supply\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Northwest Area Water Supply\n\nThe Northwest Area Water Supply (NAWS) has had disputes with the Canadian government over a plan calling for water to be pumped from Lake Sakakawea, then to Minot for treatment, and then to large stretches of Northwest North Dakota.\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nLargest employers\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the City's 2022 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,[30] the largest employers in the city are:\n\n# Employer # of Employees 1 Minot Air Force Base 12,123 2 Trinity Health 2,850 3 Minot Public Schools 1,047 4 Minot State University 561 5 City of Minot 437 6 Hess 380 7 Cognizant (ING Minot Service Center) 372 (2018) 8 Delta Vacations 367 9 Ward County 367 10 MLT Inc. 366 (2019) 11 Marketplace Foods 313 (2020) 12 Kalix (MVAW) 279 13 BNSF Railroad 230 14 Grand Hotel/International Inn 219 (2018) 15 Ryan Family Dealerships 204 (2020) Total 18,641\n\nMinot's economy predominantly centers around the Air Force Base 13 miles (21 km) north of town, making the city's economy more robust than other cities of its size due to its large service area.\n\nING/ReliaStar established a service center in Minot in December 1998.[31]\n\nMinot has seen a significant increase in population and infrastructure investments in the last several years with the expanding drilling (using hydrofracking) of oil in the Bakken Formation and Three Forks Groups.[32] The State of North Dakota has a website detailing daily oil activity.[33]\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Minot Public Schools system operates ten elementary schools (K–5) in the city: Bel Air,[34] Edison,[35] John Hoeven,[36] Lewis and Clark,[37] Longfellow,[38] McKinley[39] Roosevelt,[40] Perkett,[41] Sunnyside,[42] and Washington.[43] The district also operates Bell Elementary, about five miles southeast of Minot. Jefferson Elementary closed in 2003. The old Washington Elementary building closed in 2007 and the students moved to a new building that was renovated from an old health care center. There are also two elementary schools (K–6) on the Minot Air Force Base: Dakota[44] and North Plains.[45] The 2011 flood resulted in the relocation of Erik Ramstad Middle School and the closure of Lincoln Elementary, as both buildings were damaged beyond economical repair. Longfellow Elementary was expanded after the flood and children who lived in the Lincoln neighborhood then attended Longfellow Elementary.\n\nThere are three middle schools in the system. The two in Minot are grades 6–8: Jim Hill in the south[46] and Erik Ramstad in the north.[47] Memorial Middle School on Minot AFB[48] is named for fallen veterans of the U.S. armed forces. The school was built in the mid-1960s on the base's northern perimeter. All three middle schools were formerly called \"junior high\" schools.\n\nThe city has one public high school, Minot High School, divided between two campuses. A few blocks east of Downtown Minot is Central Campus (grades 9–10),[49] which occupies the original high school building. On the southwest side of the city is the newer Magic City Campus (grades 11–12),[50] constructed in 1973 just west of Jim Hill Middle School. MPS also operates an adult learning center and Souris River Campus, an alternative high school.[51][52]\n\nIn 2021, voters passed a school bond issue to fund renovation of Central Campus in downtown Minot into a third in-town middle school for students in grades 6 to 8. Magic City Campus will be renovated into a four-year high school attended by students in grades 9 to 12. A second four-year high school, Minot North High School, will be in north Minot on the site of the former Cognizant office building, which has been donated to the school district and will be expanded and renovated.[53][54]\n\nPrivate schools in Minot include Bishop Ryan Catholic School, which offers preschool through grade 12 at a single campus. There is also a Protestant K–12 school, Our Redeemer's Christian School.\n\nMinot is also home to Minot State University, the state's third-largest university. MSU's campus is at the base of North Hill, just west of Broadway. A two-year teacher's college when it opened in 1913, Minot State became a university in 1987.\n\nPreschool and daycare\n\n[edit]\n\nMany of the larger daycare centers and preschools in the Minot area work in collaboration with local church groups. There are also programs such as Head Start and preschool programs through Minot Public Schools.
