        "text": "If you didn't know, we are just about into the heart of the sand bass run across the state. Warmer waters get the advantage on the species, but overall every big body of water is on the bite as we roll into prime spring season fishing.\n\nIf you've never eaten sand bass - AKA - white bass, it's good as long as you know how to filet it. You cut it up like any other fish, but also trim off the thin oil-rich red meat and the lateral line that runs through each filet. Bread it, fry it, tastes buttery. You'll love it.\n\nThe largemouth and smallmouth bass are also starting to stir in the warmer, smaller lakes. Getting their fill on whatever prey they can find. Gorging themselves on shad and bluegill, makes it easy pickings on crankbaits at the moment. Of course, as we warm into the spawn, the bite is only going to get red hot... before you know it, the summer sun will force the biggest sportfish down deep into their hot-weather dormancy when the bite slows.\n\nNow is the time to be fishing. I know it's annoying dressing for cold weather in the morning only to shed layers as the day goes by, but you have to make hay when the weather allows...\n\nIf you believe in the solunar table theory, you can reference any number of free resources on the net to pick and choose your optimum fishing times... but you can't catch the lunkers if you don't have lines in the water, just saying... As much as I believe the solunar times, I've also seen monsters pulled out of the lakes when there was supposed to be a lull in the action.\n\nIf you don't know how to target Oklahoma's various species of sport fish, take a few free fishing classes with the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation. The largemouth course will stream live in a few days, here's the link to it and every other free online fishing class this month. Never waste free information, it has value.\n\nGet out on the bank, in a boat, rent a kayak, hit the mountain lakes, and connect back to the calm and silent sounds of nature... It'll change everything you probably believe about living here."
