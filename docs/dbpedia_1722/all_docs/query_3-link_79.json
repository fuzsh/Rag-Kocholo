        "text": "The following is a listing of every radio station that has been Top 40 in mid-AMerica, or at least my listing of same. The basis is my logbooks and a pretty good memory. This starts in 1967 and goes thru today! As a child I was fascinated by the production, jingles, music surveys, presentation, programming/counter programming of Top 40 radio stations. Fact is, in 2020, I still am!\n\nHaving my earliest rememberences of my folks listening to WOKY Milwaukee in 1958, my sending (the late) Barney Pip (a WOKY dj) a letter and him reading it on the air in 1965, collecting record surveys for years, collecting jingles and the dx hobby which I began in 1967, this format has always been my favorite!\n\nMilwaukee in it's AM days boasted of 3 Top40's. 920-WOKY, 1290-WZUU and 1340-WRIT. All had surveys...WOKY: 30 songs, WRIT: 40, WZUU: 29. In the 80's we had FOUR FM Top 40's: 94-WKTI, Z95 (WZUU-FM), B-97 (then 97.3 WBTT; now WRNW,) and \"Hitradio 1 double O 7-WRKR\" (100.7-WRKR; now V100 WKKV Urban.) All had record surveys too! WKTI: 30 songs, Z95: 30, B97: 30 and WRKR: 40.\n\nThe surveys would be discontinued, stations would switch formats or the format would be through cycles. I still loved the format. Never got into radio but in my house there's a studio and I can do Top40/CHR with my own commercials/jingles/hotclocks/production elements any time. Tough to never grow up, plus I don't get fired, hi!\n\nThe basis for this is a DX-midAmerica article from April/May 1984 called \"AM Top 40-Where did it go?\" This will be updated to include FM Top40s from midAMerica. There is a huge file of info from old DX-midAMerica bulletins/web pages, dating back to bulletin #1 in 1981!\n\nHere we go, and I hope you enjoy. It might just jog your memory!\n\nWhat astonished me was this weekly artwork (the record survey) looked so professional! Tiny little stations in Great Falls (1450 KQDI) or 1550 KWQB in Fargo were home to excellent, well designed, printed charts! Laid out well, and looked as good as anything from Los Angeles or New York! A 1972 KSO Des Moines chart looked better than something from the other side of the country! Some people just \"got it!\"\n\n550 KOPR MT Butte Top40 to 1963. The KOPR calls are now on 94.1FM. Now 550 is KBOW with C&W music. DJ's:the Fabulous 4.
