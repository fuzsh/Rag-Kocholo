        "text": "Contemporary hit radio station in Grand Forks, North Dakota\n\nKZGF (94.7 FM, \"Z94.7\") is a radio station broadcasting a Top 40 (CHR) format serving Grand Forks, North Dakota. It first began broadcasting in the 1967 under the call sign KYTN and used the call sign KNOX-FM for several years until 2011. The station is currently owned by Leighton Broadcasting, and competes with iHeartMedia's 92.9 KKXL-FM \"XL93\". The on-air schedule and personalities almost mirror Leighton sister station KCLD-FM, including the Playhouse Mornings with Kat and JJ Holiday, Alayna Jaye on mid-days, Derek Lee on afternoons and the live syndicated Liveline with Mason Kelter at night.\n\nFormats of KNOX-FM Name (call signs) Format Kitten 95 (KYTN) Beautiful Music (1967–1980) Lite Rock 95 Adult Contemporary (1980–1982) Y95 CHR/Top 40 (1982–1988) Power 95/Laser 95 (KNOX-FM) AOR (1988–1990) Kool 94.7 Oldies (1990–1995) Real Country 94.7 Classic Country (1995–2002) The Rooster 94.7 Classic Country (2002–2007) Power 94.7 Classic Rock (2007–2009) 94.7 Rocks Classic Rock (2009–2010) Z94.7 (KZGF) CHR/Top 40 (2010–present)\n\n94.7 first signed on in 1967 as KYTN, and aired a beautiful music format as \"Kitten 95\". The station later tweaked to adult contemporary as \"Lite Rock 95\" in 1980, which lasted until May 1984 when it flipped to a CHR/Top 40 format as \"Y95\", competing with KKXL-FM/92.9 \"XL93\".\n\n\"Y-95\" later flipped to album oriented rock (the predecessor to the classic rock format) as \"Power 95\" with the KNOX-FM call sign in 1988. KNOX-FM later became \"Laser 95\", until flipping to oldies in 1990 as \"Kool 94.7\". The station later flipped to a satellite fed classic country format as \"Real Country 94.7\" in 1995, when KSNR adopted the \"Kool 100.3\" moniker to its oldies format. In 2002, it switched to a locally originated classic country as \"The Rooster 94.7\".\n\nOn September 27, 2007, the station returned to rock with the \"Power\" moniker as \"Power 94.7\" with a classic rock format, to compete with Clear Channel's classic rock KQHT \"96.1 The Fox\" and heritage active rock KJKJ/107.5 \"KJ108\". The previous classic country format as \"The Rooster\" was moved to KCNN/1590.\n\nIn December 2009, the station rebranded itself as \"94.7 Rocks\" and added 1990s rock to its classic rock format. On August 23, 2010, the station began stunting as \"94.7 Santa FM\" under a purely Christmas Music format. On August 25, 2010, the station flipped to \"Z94.7\" under a CHR/Top 40 format and changed the call sign to KZGF in February 2011. The station began with a Rhythmic CHR/Top 40 lean, but shifted towards a Mainstream CHR/Top 40 format in October 2011. \"Z94.7\" competes with Clear Channel's heritage CHR/Top 40 KKXL-FM/92.9 \"XL93\"."
