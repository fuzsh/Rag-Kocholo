He continued his advocacy of good music through his leadership with the MSU and Community Fine Arts Series. He delighted in bringing world-class performers to Mayville State, giving students and community members opportunities to hear fantastic music right here at home. Dr. Thein began his tenure as a member of the faculty at Mayville State in 1963 and was awarded the distinction of Professor Emeritus of Music when he retired in 2000."
