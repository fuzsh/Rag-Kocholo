        "text": "\"Minot\" redirects here. For other uses, see Minot (disambiguation).\n\nMinot (i MY-not) is a city in and the county seat of Ward County, North Dakota, United States, in the state's north-central region. It is most widely known for the Air Force base approximately 15 miles (24 km) north of the city. With a population of 48,377 at the 2020 census, Minot is the state's fourth-most populous city and a trading center for a large part of northern North Dakota, southwestern Manitoba, and southeastern Saskatchewan. Founded in 1886 during the construction of James J. Hill's Great Northern Railway, Minot is also known as \"Magic City\", commemorating its remarkable growth in size over a short time.\n\nMinot is the principal city of the Minot metropolitan area, a metropolitan area that covers McHenry, Renville, and Ward counties and had a combined population of 77,546 at the 2020 census.\n\nHistory\n\nMinot came into existence in 1886, when James J. Hill's Great Northern Railway ended its push through the state for the winter, after having difficulty constructing a trestle across Gassman Coulee. It was the end of the railway's line, so whenever a train came into the town and the stop was announced, the conductor would call out \"Minot, this is Minot, North Dakota, prepare to meet your doom\". A tent town sprang up overnight, as if by \"magic\", thus the city came to be known as the Magic City, and in the next five months, the population increased to over 5,000 residents, further adding to the nickname's validity.\n\nThe town site was chosen by the railroad to be placed on the land of then-homesteader Erik Ramstad. Ramstad was convinced to relinquish his claim, and became one of the city leaders.\n\nThe town was named after Henry D. Minot, a railroad investor, an ornithologist and friend of Hill. Its Arikara name is niwaharít sahaáhkat [niWAharít sAhaáhkAt, niWAharít shaáhkAt]; its Hidatsa name is dibiarugareesh, (\"Plum Coulee\").\n\nThe city was incorporated on June 28, 1887.\n\nThe Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad (Soo Line) later built a line from Valley City up to Canada. While initially their plan was to cross the Souris River at Burlington, local interests and arguments convinced them otherwise; landholders along the new route donated the right-of-way. They reached Minot in 1893.\n\nMinot and its surrounding area were wide open throughout 1905-20. Population grew rapidly due to railroad construction and availability of unclaimed land. Nearly complete court records of Ward County and Minot document the prevalence and different types of criminal activity, and offer strong support for the dubious title of \"crime capitol of North Dakota.\" State attorney general William Langer helped clean up the town in 1917-1920, but by the time Prohibition had arrived in the 1920s the city had become a center of illegal activities associated with the High Third district, which were exacerbated due to the city being a supply hub of Al Capone's liquor smuggling operations. The hotbed of crime that sprang up in the Downtown area soon led people to give Minot the nickname \"Little Chicago.\" The Smugglers used a network of underground tunnels (some of which were previously built for heating or deliveries) to transport and conceal the illicit cargo entering from Canada.\n\nThe 1950s saw a large influx of federal funding into the region, with the construction of Minot Air Force Base (1956–57) thirteen miles (20 km) north of the city, and Garrison Dam (1947–53) on the Missouri River, about fifty miles (80 km) south of Minot.\n\nIn 1969, a severe flood on the Souris River devastated the city. Afterward, the Army Corps of Engineers straightened the path of the river through the city and built several flood control structures.\n\nOn January 18, 2002, a severe train derailment west of the city sent a gigantic cloud of anhydrous ammonia toward Minot, and Burlington. One man died and many of Minot's citizens were sickened and severely injured by the noxious gas, causing one of the worst major chemical accidents of the country. In early 2006, court cases were heard in Minneapolis, Minnesota, against Canadian Pacific Railway, the owner of the derailed train. The anhydrous ammonia spill was the largest such spill in U.S. history. This incident was addressed by Eric Klinenberg in his book Fighting for Air: The Battle to Control America's Media as an example of the failure of mass-Media, specifically local radio stations, to disseminate information to the public in an emergency.\n\nThe 2011 Souris River flood caused extensive damage throughout the Souris River Valley. On June 21, 2011, KXMC-TV reported that a flood of historic proportions was imminent in the Souris River Valley, largely due to large dam releases upstream. Around 12,000 people were evacuated. On June 26, flooding exceeded previous records when the river crested at 1,561.72 feet above sea level, three feet above the previous record set back in 1881. It is estimated that 20 percent of Minot sustained damage from the flood. This figure includes over 4,100 homes which were someway affected, 2,376 extensively damaged, and 805 damaged beyond repair. The nearby town of Burlington was also severely damaged during this time.\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 17.45 square miles (45.20 km2), of which, 17.43 square miles (45.14 km2) is land and 0.02 square miles (0.05 km2) is water.\n\nNeighborhoods\n\nMinot is commonly divided into three major divisions. These divisions are North Hill, the Souris River Valley and South Hill. North Hill is the area roughly north of Eleventh Avenue North and Northwest Avenue. South Hill is a broad area south and west of Valley Street and Fifth Avenue South. West of Sixth Street West, South Hill dips sharply to the southwest. The limits of South Hill are less clearly defined than North Hill. Though the neighborhood levels out past Sixteenth Street South, the name South Hill is generally applied to all areas south up to the city limits. Neighborhoods in the Souris River Valley include Bel Air, Downtown, Eastwood Park, Oak Park and West Minot.\n\nRegion\n\nMinot is located on the Drift Prairie of northwestern North Dakota. Minot is at , about 100 miles (160 km) north of Bismarck. The Souris River, or Mouse River, runs through the city west to east.\n\nImportant cities in the region for which Minot is the trading center include Burlington, Velva, Garrison, Stanley, Bottineau, Rugby, and New Town.\n\nMinot is almost entirely land; the Souris River, its oxbow lakes, and a few creeks take up just 0.14% of the city's total area.\n\nThe elevation of the river at the city center is 1,540 feet (469 m) above sea level. The valley sits some 160 feet (50 m) below the surrounding plains; the elevation at the Minot International Airport on \"North Hill\" is 1,716 feet (523 m). The city has several small horseshoe-shaped oxbow lakes in its limits near the river, created due to the Souris's meandering course.\n\nGrid and address system\n\nThe city is laid out on a grid-based street system. Streets run north-south and avenues run east-west. Streets are numbered by their block distance east or west of Main Street. Similarly, Avenues are numbered north and south of Central Avenue. There are four city quadrants (NW, SW, SE, NE) to describe the exact location of any given address. Main Street addresses are simply designated North and South. Central Avenue addresses are simply designated East and West. The grid addressing system carries over into the rural areas of Ward County, making the county one of only three that do not follow the statewide grid system in North Dakota (the others being Burleigh County and Grand Forks County).\n\nSouris River\n\nThe Souris River divides the city approximately in half, north and south. The valley rises to the plains both north and south of the river. Although there are names for certain features of these hills, such as Anthony Hill on South Hill, there are no general names for these topographical features. The northern rise and the plateau north of it are referred to as North Hill and the southern rise and plateau south of it are referred to as South Hill.\n\nClimate\n\nMinot experiences a cool-summer Humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb), with four distinct seasons and moderate annual precipitation. Summers range from warm to moderately hot, with frequent thunderstorm activity. Winters are typically bitterly cold and snowy, with high winds and below-freezing temperatures for weeks at a time. Lows below 0 °F (−18 °C) occur on about 39 days during the winter, while temperatures reach 90 °F (32 °C) on 14 days per summer, and in some years reach 100 °F (38 °C). The average annual snowfall total is 43 inches (110 cm).\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical population Census Pop. %± 1890 575 — 1900 1,277 122.1% 1910 6,188 384.6% 1920 10,476 69.3% 1930 16,099 53.7% 1940 16,577 3.0% 1950 22,032 32.9% 1960 30,604 38.9% 1970 32,290 5.5% 1980 32,843 1.7% 1990 34,544 5.2% 2000 36,567 5.9% 2010 40,888 11.8% 2020 48,377 18.3% 2022 (est.) 47,759 16.8% U.S. Decennial Census\n\n2020 Census\n\n2020 census\n\nAs of the census of 2020, there were 48,377 people, 20,979 households, and 9,978 families residing in the city.

The State of North Dakota has a website detailing daily oil activity.\n\nEducation\n\nThe Minot Public Schools system operates ten elementary schools (K–5) in the city: Bel Air, Edison, John Hoeven, Lewis and Clark, Longfellow, McKinley Roosevelt, Perkett, Sunnyside, and Washington. The district also operates Bell Elementary, about five miles southeast of Minot. Jefferson Elementary closed in 2003. The old Washington Elementary building closed in 2007 and the students moved to a new building that was renovated from an old health care center. There are also two elementary schools (K–6) on the Minot Air Force Base: Dakota and North Plains. The 2011 flood resulted in the relocation of Erik Ramstad Middle School and the closure of Lincoln Elementary, as both buildings were damaged beyond economical repair. Longfellow Elementary was expanded after the flood and children who lived in the Lincoln neighborhood then attended Longfellow Elementary.\n\nThere are three middle schools in the system. The two in Minot are grades 6–8: Jim Hill in the south and Erik Ramstad in the north. Memorial Middle School on Minot AFB is named for fallen veterans of the U.S. armed forces. The school was built in the mid-1960s on the base's northern perimeter. All three middle schools were formerly called \"junior high\" schools.\n\nThe city has one public high school, Minot High School, divided between two campuses. A few blocks east of Downtown Minot is Central Campus (grades 9–10), which occupies the original high school building. On the southwest side of the city is the newer Magic City Campus (grades 11–12), constructed in 1973 just west of Jim Hill Middle School. MPS also operates an adult learning center and Souris River Campus, an alternative high school.\n\nIn 2021, voters passed a school bond issue to fund renovation of Central Campus in downtown Minot into a third in-town middle school for students in grades 6 to 8. Magic City Campus will be renovated into a four-year high school attended by students in grades 9 to 12. A second four-year high school, Minot North High School, will be in north Minot on the site of the former Cognizant office building, which has been donated to the school district and will be expanded and renovated.\n\nPrivate schools in Minot include Bishop Ryan Catholic School, which offers preschool through grade 12 at a single campus. There is also a Protestant K–12 school, Our Redeemer's Christian School.\n\nMinot is also home to Minot State University, the state's third-largest university. MSU's campus is at the base of North Hill, just west of Broadway. A two-year teacher's college when it opened in 1913, Minot State became a university in 1987.\n\nPreschool and daycare\n\nMany of the larger daycare centers and preschools in the Minot area work in collaboration with local church groups. There are also programs such as Head Start and preschool programs through Minot Public Schools. The in-home daycare providers are state registered and licensed.\n\nCulture\n\nMinot's arts community includes an art museum, a symphony orchestra, an opera company, a city band, several dance and theater troupes: over 40 organizations claim membership in the Minot Area Council on the Arts.\n\nNearly 40% of the city's residents are of Scandinavian ancestry, and every October since 1977, Minot has been the host to the Norsk Høstfest, North America's largest Scandinavian-American festival.

The Bismarck Tribune is available at several outlets in the city, as is The Forum, to a lesser extent.\n\nTransportation\n\nRailroads\n\nThe railroads that built Minot remain, though Great Northern is now part of the BNSF Railway and the Soo Line is run by the Canadian Pacific Kansas City.\n\nPassenger rail transportation is provided on Amtrak's Empire Builder line, connecting Chicago with Portland and Seattle, which stops at the Minot Amtrak station. Trains make a 20-minute refueling and crew change stop in Minot. Westbound trains are scheduled to arrive daily at 8:29 am local time; eastbound trains are scheduled to arrive daily at 9:27 pm.\n\nHighways\n\nThree major U.S. highways run through the city, connecting it to Canada, Montana, and two interstates: US 2, US 52, and US 83.\n\nUS 2 runs east-west and is a four-lane divided highway from Minot east to Grand Forks and beyond as well as west to Williston and into Montana. Minot is midpoint along the North Dakota segment of US 2.\n\nUS 83 runs north-south through central Minot as Broadway. It is a four-lane divided highway from Minot south to Bismarck and north to Minot Air Force Base. Just north of the main gate at the base, the road reduces to two lanes and crosses the Canada–US border at Westhope, ND, where it becomes Manitoba Highway 83.\n\nUS 52 is a two-lane highway that runs southeast-northwest. Southeast from Minot, it follows a slightly circuitous route to Jamestown. US 52 then merges with Interstate 94 (I-94) after Jamestown, heading due east to Fargo. Northwest from Minot, US 52 crosses the Canada–US border at Portal, ND/North Portal, SK, where it becomes Saskatchewan Highway 39.\n\nThe Minot Bypass follows alternate alignments of these roads around the city in its northwest and northeast quadrants, with southwest and southeast bypasses in preliminary planning stages.\n\nAirport\n\nMinot International Airport is served by three airlines as well as charters and air taxi service around North Dakota. Delta Air Lines offers up to six daily round trips to Minneapolis International Airport, offering hundreds of daily connections. United Airlines offers four daily round trips to its Denver International Airport hub. Allegiant Air provides up to four weekly round trips to Las Vegas McCarran International Airport and up to five weekly round trips to Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport.\n\nWithin the city\n\nAutomobiles dominate intracity and local area transport. There is limited fixed-route city transit service (Minot City Transit) on weekdays, and flexible-route rural transit service (Souris Basin Transportation) on an occasional basis. Local transit services for the elderly and disabled (Minot Commission on Aging Transit) meet federal guidelines but have 24-hour advance notice requirements.\n\nSites of interest\n\nArlene Theater, a performing arts center, where the Mouse River Players perform\n\nDakota Territory Air Museum is an aircraft museum near the airport.
