        "text": "History\n\nThief River Falls takes its name from a geographic feature, the falls of the Red Lake River at its confluence with the Thief River. The name of the river is a loose translation of the Ojibwe phrase Gimood-akiwi ziibi, literally, the \"Stolen-land river\" or \"Thieving-land river\", which originated when a band of Dakota Indians occupied a secret encampment along the river, hence \"stealing\" the land, before being discovered and routed by the neighboring Ojibwe. In the Treaty of Old Crossing of 1863, the Moose Dung's Indian Reservation was established on the west bank of the Thief River, at its confluence with Red Lake River. This Indian Reservation was dissolved in 1904 and their population incorporated as part of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa.\n\nThief River Falls marked the limit of navigation on the Red Lake River. The eponymous town site was established in 1887 and later incorporated as a city in 1896. Thief River Falls first developed as a lumber-milling town. It is located in a major agriculture area because of the rich soil left by ancient Glacial Lake Agassiz. The Great Northern and the Soo Line railroads brought prosperity when Thief River Falls became a center for shipping wheat.\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 5.21 square miles (13.49 km2), of which 5.02 square miles (13.00 km2) is land and 0.19 square miles (0.49 km2) is water.\n\nThief River Falls is located at the confluence of the Red Lake River and the Thief River. U.S. Highway 59 and Minnesota State Highways 1 and 32 are the three main routes in the community. Thief River Falls is located approximately 70 miles (110 km) south of the Canada–United States border and 52 miles (84 km) northeast from Grand Forks, North Dakota, in the Northwest region of Minnesota.\n\nDemographics\n\nAccording to the ethnic heritage section of the 2000 Federal Census, 50% of Thief River Falls residents identify themselves as Norwegian-American, making Thief River Falls one of the most ethnically concentrated towns in the nation.\n\n2010 census\n\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 8,573 people, 3,802 households, and 2,141 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,707.8 inhabitants per square mile (659.4/km2). There were 4,061 housing units at an average density of 809.0 per square mile (312.4/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 92.0% White, 2.1% African American, 1.9% Native American, 0.7% Asian, 1.0% from other races, and 2.3% from two or more races.

The population density was 1,760.0 people per square mile (679.3/km²). There were 3,931 housing units at an average density of 822.7 per square mile (317.5/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 96.56% White, 0.27% African American, 0.95% Native American, 0.67% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 0.62% from other races, and 0.90% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.63% of the population.\n\nThere were 3,619 households, out of which 27.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 44.2% were married couples living together, 10.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 42.2% were non-families. 35.1% of all households were made up of individuals and 15.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

Males had a median income of $30,332 versus $20,785 for females. The per capita income for the city was $17,489. About 8.0% of families and 12.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 11.3% of those under age 18 and 15.7% of those age 65 or over.\n\nEconomy\n\nThief River Falls (and surrounding region) has been home to major industry including snowmobiles, farm machinery, and global electronics distribution. The town is the home of snowmobile manufacturer Arctic Cat. South of Thief River Falls is a casino, 7 Clans Casino, which also contains a hotel and indoor water park. Thief River Falls is home to the electronic parts distributor Digi-Key, one of the largest employers in the area, and was the birthplace of the vaunted Steiger Tractor, produced from 1958 to the late 1980s. Thief River Falls was home to the headquarters of the Cycle Detection Warning System up until its shutdown on April 13, 2009.\n\nRivers and rails\n\nThief River Falls is situated on the junction of two rivers, Red Lake River from the east, southeast and the Thief River from the north. The proximity to forests and shipping made Thief River Falls ideal for logging. In the late 19th century the Great Northern Railway was built, and in 1904, the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railway (“Soo Line”) passed through on its route from Saint Paul to Winnipeg. Branches were later built to Drake, North Dakota and Duluth, Minnesota. The Minnesota Northwestern Electric Railway, an electric powered passenger train, ran from Thief River Falls to Goodridge between 1914 and 1940.\n\nToday, the river and rails still power the local economy with tourism and shipping. Canadian Pacific Railway and Minnesota Northern Railroad now occupy tracks through town. To this day, Soo Line engine 1024 rests outside city hall (formerly the Soo Line Depot).\n\nOn Tuesday, August 21, 2007, the Empress Express (Canadian Pacific 2816) spent the night in front of the historic Soo Line depot in Thief River Falls. Thief River Falls Radio reported that the classic steam engine was built in 1930, and the 45 ticketed passengers were to leave for Glenwood, Minnesota on Wednesday morning.\n\nSnowmobiles\n\nArctic Cat, Inc. can trace its roots to former Polaris Industries founder Edgar Hetteen who left Polaris in 1960 and started Polar Manufacturing in Thief River Falls. Shortly after changing name to Arctic Enterprises, the new company produced snowmobiles. Arctic Cat purchased several boat manufacturers including Spirit Marine which produced the first Wetbike in 1978. A few snowless winters in the early 1980s bankrupted the 20-year-old company, which closed their facilities by 1982. In 1984, Arctic Cat was reborn under a new company name, Arctco, which was changed to Arctic Cat in 1996.\n\nDigi-Key Corporation\n\nDigi-Key is a privately held global electronics distributor based in Thief River Falls. The company started in 1972 with Dr. Ronald A. Stordahl's interest in ham radio, which led him to assemble and sell digital electronic keyer kits for sending radiotelegraph code for ham radio operators. This device was called the Digi-Key. Digi-Key has distributed parts literally \"around the world\", as parts from Digi-Key now orbit Earth in satellites.\n\nTractors\n\nSteiger Tractors were invented by Douglas and Maurice Steiger from Thief River Falls during the 1950s. The brothers built their first tractor the winter of 1957-58 after seeing a need to cover their ground more efficiently. After designing and building the tractors on their farm for six years, the brothers opened a production facility in Fargo, North Dakota. A new plant built in 1974 could produce a new tractor every 18 minutes. Steiger produced many models of tractor with the main feature being the horsepower. Ford chose Steiger to manufacture the Ford tractors of the late 1970s and early 80s. As the farm economy slumped in the late 80s, Steiger had trouble selling tractors. Steiger filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1986, and was soon after sold to Tenneco, parent company of J. I. Case. Case IH continued to produce and sell Steiger tractors while introducing its own lines of 4wd tractors. Case still produces Steiger tractors out of the Fargo, North Dakota facility.\n\nEducation\n\nThief River Falls is home to a public school district operating a high school (Lincoln High School), middle school (Franklin Middle School), and elementary school (Challenger Elementary School). Benefactor Ralph Engelstad, who was raised in Thief River Falls, built an $11.5 million hockey arena for the high school hockey team. The arena is called Ralph Engelstad Arena, the same name as the University of North Dakota's $100 million hockey arena in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Thief River Falls is also home to Northland Community and Technical College (NCTC), which also has a campus in East Grand Forks, Minnesota. The college has experienced steady growth in enrollment in the past decade.\n\nHealthcare\n\nSanford Health Thief River Falls Northwest Medical Center is a Critical Access Hospital (CAH) with 25 beds; has non-governmental, not-for-profit, 501(c)(3) status; and is the area's community hospital.

It subsequently ran Off-Broadway in New York in June 2001 to mixed reviews, and later had a longer run in San Francisco. The Wall Street Journal called it \"an old fashioned gay love story - one where love is upstaged by shame, secrecy and social defiance.\" It is the story of Gil and Ray, who at age 17 were secret lovers in what one reviewer called \"a small homophobic Minnesota town in the '40s\"—presumably Thief River Falls. The plot portrays a love between these two men that spans 53 years. As stated by another reviewer, \"The play attempted to show what it would be like to be a gay man in a small town in the late '40s, when two men kissing would have been a revolutionary act.\" The play most recently ran in Chicago in early 2007, where it was called \"the definitive work capturing the homosexual experience in the rural American Midwest over the last 50 years.\".
