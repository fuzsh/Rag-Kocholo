        "text": "It’s Christmas time in the Grand Cities and around the world. On Dec. 16th, our newly crowned Miss Grand Forks 2013 Laura Harmon celebrated the Christmas spirit, along with the best in music and dance from the Greater Grand Forks region, by hosting and starring in the Christmas at the Empire concert. This multifaceted event brought together many well known and talented individuals and groups and raised money for the Empire Arts Center, home to the pageant for many years and a beloved restored and historic non-profit theater downtown.\n\nThe night began with a lyrical dance to Thankful by Josh Groban performed by two former Grand Forks’ Outstanding Teen titleholders Grace Sproule and Ellie Unkenholz. The song reminds me of how thankful we each truly are to have friends and family in our lives, food and shelter, and to have the ability to choose our own paths in life, including what we do to make a difference and how we treat others. For five years now, I have met a group of young women each year that are no doubt talented and beautiful, but of whom are also full of life and love and I am thankful for what they’ve done for this community and for our program.\n\nThe first big production number was to We Need a Little Christmas, performed by Miss Grand Forks 2013 Laura Harmon and community kids and choreographed by former Miss Grand Forks 2010 | Miss ND 2010-2011 Beth Dennison. A Christmas concert without kids is like a pageant without gowns and our group of young volunteers did a terrific job bringing a joy to the stage that was both adorable and highly contagious. Later in the evening, Laura had the opportunity to sing Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas to the same group of youngsters. One of my favorite moments from the night was seeing Beth prep the kids before their number with Laura and listening to their excitement about the night and about being on stage… one little boy had the idea of doing a dance solo during her song, followed by an even better idea of pretending to be Superman. Beth just laughed and said, “your mom will probably not like that.”\n\nThe pageant was further represented by the volunteer efforts of our current Miss Grand Forks’ Outstanding Teen Alyssa Black and Miss Grand Cities’ Outstanding Teen Mia Pagnac. They did a great job as our backstage helpers for the evening. The entire event was co-directed by former Miss Grand Forks 2011 and current Executive Director of the Empire Arts Center Emily Burkland and myself, pageant director for the Miss Grand Forks Scholarship Org. Additional performers:\n\nNorth Dakota Ballet Company dancers Brooke Erickson & Emily Theurer\n\nDance Etc.\n\nDavid Adams- vocalist\n\nMaria Williams Kennedy- vocalist\n\nSophia Maruska- vocalist\n\nNorthern Valley Youth Orchestra\n\nGrand Forks Central HS Drum Line\n\nEmpire Theater Company\n\nCalvary Lutheran Choir\n\nand the Varsity Gentlemen\n\nWith Christmas right around the corner, we thank our sponsors and volunteers, contestants and titleholders for their continued support of the Miss Grand Forks Scholarship Organization. A special thank you to Katie Norby of Tres Chic, the official gown sponsor for the pageant, who styled Miss Grand Forks for this event.\n\nNext, we will focus on planning our 2013 Miss Grand Forks & Miss Grand Cities’ Outstanding Teen Pageant, happening on Sat. Jan. 12th, 4pm at the Empire Arts Center downtown Grand Forks, ND. We look forward to welcoming two teens to our pageant family. If you or someone you know is between the ages of 13-17, up to a junior in high school, and from either MN or ND please sign up to become a contestant at http://www.grandforkspageants.org.\n\nMerry Christmas!\n\nMiss Grand Forks Scholarship Org.\n\nhttp://www.grandforkspageants.org\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/missgrandforks\n\nThe 2013 Miss Grand Forks Scholarship Pageant took place on Sat. Nov. 24th, 7pm at the Empire Arts Center downtown Grand Forks, ND. Three titleholders were crowned. Miss Grand Forks 2013 is Laura Harmon of Grand Forks, ND. Laura’s platform is about renewable resources and her talent is an operatic solo. Miss Empire 2013 is Cara Mund of Bismarck, ND. Cara’s platform is the Make-A-Wish foundation and her talent is a jazz dance. The 1st ever Miss Grand Cities title (a MN local title) was given to Paige Meyer of Perham, MN. Paige’s platform is about quality education in America and her talent is ballet. Miss Grand Forks and Miss Empire will advance to the 2013 Miss North Dakota Scholarship Pageant this June in Williston, ND.

They will both compete for the title of Miss America 2013 on Jan. 12th, airing live on the ABC network at 8pm CST.\n\nAdditional awards were given to the following contestants at the conclusion of the Nov. 24th competition:\n\n2nd Runner Up to Miss Grand Cities: Emily Lundgren of Aikin, MN\n\n1st Runner Up to Miss Grand Cities: Michelle Stahlecker of Crookston, MN\n\n1st Runner Up to Miss Empire: Megan Yahna of Larimore, ND\n\n2nd Runner Up to Miss Grand Forks: Abigail Mattson of Grand Forks, ND\n\n1st Runner Up to Miss Grand Forks: Christina King of Grand Forks, ND\n\nMiracle Maker Award: Michelle Stahlecker of Crookston, MN\n\nZ94.7 People’s Choice Award: Chandler Kallock of East Grand Forks, MN\n\nMiss Congeniality: Abigail Mattson of Grand Forks, ND\n\nTres Chic High Score in Evening Gown Award: Laura Harmon of Grand Forks, ND\n\nWild Hog High Score in Talent Award: Laura Harmon of Grand Forks, ND\n\nCK Shoppe High Score in Interview Award: Cara Mund of Bismarck, ND\n\nAnytime Fitness High Score in Swimsuit Award: Megan Yahna of Larimore, ND\n\nThe pageant is currently recruiting contestants for the 2013 Miss Grand Forks and Miss Grand Cities’ Outstanding Teen Pageant, happening at the Empire Arts Center downtown Grand Forks, ND on Sat.

Teens between the ages of 13-17, up to junior status in high school, and from anywhere in Minnesota or North Dakota may sign up to become a contestant at www.grandforkspageants.org (2013 pageant- TEEN CONTESTANTS).\n\nI am now in my hometown spending the week with my family and my dogs before heading back to Grand Forks. I am almost caught up on rest and this last week has started to sink in. It went by so fast that it seemed like a blur!\n\nI went there focused and ready for the job of Miss North Dakota. Unfortunately, it did not happen for me but I am still very proud of myself. I did my best and stayed true to myself. My talent could not have gone better, I walked with confidence in swim and evening, and I stayed confident and true to myself in the interview. Looking back, I would not change a thing. I am proud of my performance- which landed me into the top ten. I also won Miss Photogenic, I have 3 year of modeling to thank for that one 😉\n\nThe weather, volunteering opportunities, and friendliness of the community of Williston made this a week to remember. I am not leaving here with a crown, but something far greater- I leave here with fond memories, new friends I will have forever, and a new found confidence.\n\nThank you from the bottom of my heart to all of my friends who have supported me throughout this process, to my family who was there with me every step of the way, to the community of Grand Forks for encouraging me, to Derek for always being there for me, to the Miss ND board for being so welcoming, and finally to Caroline- thank you for always being there for me, pushing me to always do my best, and for always believing in me.\n\nMy year of Miss Grand Forks is not over. I look forward to continuing to work with children and to represent the Miss Grand Forks Organization, an organization that means the world to me. I am truly thankful for this experience and the road doesn’t end here. Congratulations to Rosie Sauvageau for being named Miss North Dakota 2012! I’m so happy for you and thankful that I got to know you over the past week! You are such a sweet girl and will represent ND well! I can’t wait to cheer you on at Miss America.\n\nKate Wilson\n\nMiss Grand Forks 2012\n\nI had the opportunity to attend the “Everything from Weddings to Prom” show at the Alerus Center in Grand Forks this weekend. Miss Eastern Dakota Laura Harmon and I were live models for “Beautiful Beginnings,” a wedding and prom shop located in Thief River Falls,, MN. Laura and I had a great time trying on many prom dresses every hour. My favorite was a black gown with silver beading, it made me want to attend prom again! We had a great day speaking with members of the community and I loved spending time with the owner Sarah, she was so kind to us and even brought us lunch (fun fact: Sarah is a former contestant in the Miss America Organization).\n\nWhen Laura and I were walking around during the event, we were often asked about our crowns. Our response was that we are a part of the Miss America Organization and had won the titles of Miss Grand Forks and Miss Eastern Dakota. Lately, I have been doing a lot of thinking as to the significance of the crown we wear. It is clear to me that, more than anything else, it represents the opportunity for us to be role models in the community. I’m so proud to represent the Miss America Organization as Miss Grand Forks.\n\nMiss Grand Forks 2012\n\nKate Wilson\n\nIt’s my first week back to school and I have hit the ground running! First was an appearance at the Grand Forks Rotary Club, where I had the opportunity to speak with many business leaders from the Grand Forks community and share with them my platform issue. I spoke about my platform, “Read, Lead, Achieve” and how this can apply to people of all age groups. I was given the opportunity to share my goals and experiences with working with my platform, as well as my experiences with the Miss America Organization, why I decided to compete in the program and what I’ve gained from my involvement over the past 2 years.\n\nNext I had to opportunity to speak at Schroeder Middle School as a special guest for their 7th grade assembly based on Citizenship. I spoke about how to be a good citizen. I focused on the leadership aspect of my platform and encouraged the students to get involved in both their school and their community. At the end of my presentation the students were allowed to ask me questions. I was asked everything from what my future career goals were to if I liked Justin Bieber! This appearance was especially fun for me because as a future educator I am inspired by children. If chosen as Miss North Dakota, I will embrace the chance to speak to many more schools through a state-wide school tour.\n\nMiss Grand Forks 2012\n\nKate Wilson"
