Jan. 12th, 4pm. Teens between the ages of 13-17, up to junior status in high school, and from anywhere in Minnesota or North Dakota may sign up to become a contestant at www.grandforkspageants.org (2013 pageant- TEEN CONTESTANTS).\n\nI am now in my hometown spending the week with my family and my dogs before heading back to Grand Forks. I am almost caught up on rest and this last week has started to sink in. It went by so fast that it seemed like a blur!\n\nI went there focused and ready for the job of Miss North Dakota. Unfortunately, it did not happen for me but I am still very proud of myself. I did my best and stayed true to myself. My talent could not have gone better, I walked with confidence in swim and evening, and I stayed confident and true to myself in the interview. Looking back, I would not change a thing. I am proud of my performance- which landed me into the top ten. I also won Miss Photogenic, I have 3 year of modeling to thank for that one 😉\n\nThe weather, volunteering opportunities, and friendliness of the community of Williston made this a week to remember. I am not leaving here with a crown, but something far greater- I leave here with fond memories, new friends I will have forever, and a new found confidence.\n\nThank you from the bottom of my heart to all of my friends who have supported me throughout this process, to my family who was there with me every step of the way, to the community of Grand Forks for encouraging me, to Derek for always being there for me, to the Miss ND board for being so welcoming, and finally to Caroline- thank you for always being there for me, pushing me to always do my best, and for always believing in me.\n\nMy year of Miss Grand Forks is not over. I look forward to continuing to work with children and to represent the Miss Grand Forks Organization, an organization that means the world to me. I am truly thankful for this experience and the road doesn’t end here. Congratulations to Rosie Sauvageau for being named Miss North Dakota 2012! I’m so happy for you and thankful that I got to know you over the past week! You are such a sweet girl and will represent ND well! I can’t wait to cheer you on at Miss America.\n\nKate Wilson\n\nMiss Grand Forks 2012\n\nToday we had an early appearance at a cafe were I helped serve tables, followed by rehearsals at the high school. Tonight I competed in evening gown and swimsuit and had such a fun time modeling on stage as well as dancing in the new production number Love Miss America with my pageant sisters! After the pageant, we all enjoyed the Miss ND Gala, along with our family, friends, and pageant supporters. Here is where the major fun began! My little sister and I danced the night away and it was such a terrific chance to unwind and make memories that will surely last a lifetime.\n\nTomorrow is the night Miss North Dakota will be crowned, the night I have been waiting for since I was crowned Miss Grand Forks in November, and the night I have had in mind every time I made an appearance, set foot in a gym, practiced my clogging, and worked with my director. This has been one of the most challenging but rewarding years of my life and I am grateful for every moment I have had on this amazing journey! I fell in love with the Miss ND Organization and, as a result, have become much less shy and much more outgoing. I am now the strong women I have always wanted to be and I have the Miss America Organization and my experiences as Miss Grand Forks to thank for that.\n\nI am proud of how I have done thus far and I know that everything is now out of my hands. Should I become Miss North Dakota, I will work hard every single day to serve the state that I call home, empower children to dream big, teaching them that through education, everything is possible, and I will strive to be a memorable Miss North Dakota that my state will be proud of. I have no idea what is going to happen tomorrow and although it’s frustrating and a little scary, all I can do now is trust that God has a plan for me, and to “Let go and let God” at this point. What I do know, however, is that I’m ready and so thankful for the memories and friends made this week at Miss ND!\n\nKate Wilson\n\nMiss Grand Forks\n\nI had another exciting day in Williston! Today was full of lots of rehearsals, on stage practice, news interviews, and great food!\n\nRight away in the morning we were interviewed by the local Williston news. We had the opportunity to introduce ourselves, and share our talent and platform. It was great practice- because Miss North Dakota spends a lot of time doing interviews for both the paper and the news. After the interviews we headed to a pizza place called “Wildcats.” They had some of the best pizza I have ever had! I wanted to eat a whole pizza, but I kept in mind that the swimsuit competition is coming up 😉 We finished up lunch and went back to the high school where we practiced our production numbers for the pageant.\n\nToday we were picked up by our pageant “moms” and driven around town. My roommate Becca and I have a great lady named Barb, along with her daughter in law Jessica. They are both so excited about the pageant and it is great to have their support! Barb has been a pageant mother for 21 years and said it is one of the highlights of her year… We hope to make Barb and Jessica proud this weekend!\n\nI was also happy to see my little sister again. Today, I gave her the official little sister “princess” crown and she could not have possibly been any more excited. My little sister Jocelyn is such a sweet girl! The day came to an end with Becca and I riding back to the dorms with two former Miss North Dakotas, Jacqueline Johnson and Annette Olson. It was fun to speak with them about their experiences and hear about how much they love this program. Both are lovely women and perfect representatives of the Miss ND Org.\n\nTomorrow is my interview and the start of prelims. I will perform my talent and answer the on-stage question tomorrow evening at the pageant. It seems crazy that the day I have been waiting for all year is finally here. I’m having a terrific time with my pageant sisters and can’t wait to start competing… wish me luck!\n\nKate Wilson\n\nMiss Grand Forks 2012\n\nWow! What a long, but fun day!\n\nTo start the morning, we got right into learning production numbers for the show. There are going to be some fun performances this year from the North Dakota Dancers, Ariana Walker Miss ND 2011, singing by Annette Olson Miss ND 2007, and of course all of the contestants. There are some fun songs we will be dancing to and I’m looking forward to showing the audience these entertaining routines.\n\nAfter working on the production numbers for quite some time, we got a much needed break this afternoon. A few of us headed downtown to a coffee shop called “Daily Addiction” and it was our lucky day because we ran into an intern at the Williston Herald and will be featured in the paper sometime this week. I then found time to practice my talent on the stage of the Old Armory. This was nice because the dance floor is much like the one I will be performing on in the high school. I am really looking forward to performing my talent for the audience in just two short days!\n\nThe highlight of my day was meeting my “little sister” named Jocelyn! We walked into the auditorium and searched for the little girl who was holding up our picture. I looked around and finally saw a sweet girl jumping up and down with my picture and I ran up and gave her a hug! She was grinning from ear to ear and said she was going to be my number one fan! I gave her a few gifts- including a picture album, princess school supplies, and her favorite- a “little sister” pink necklace that matched mine that says “big sister.” She gave me a bottle of hairspray and lotion- perfect for pageant week! She seems like a very nice girl and is she’s excited to be here for the first time. I am excited to get to know her better and see her throughout the week.\n\nThe last stop of the day was at the Halliburton Man Camp. I had heard about these man camps before but never really knew what they were. I learned a lot about them on our tour today! I found it interesting that the exact man camp we were touring was once used in Vancouver, CA for the winter Olympics. It was rather small, but it would be quite convenient for someone working on the oil fields. They had everything you could possibly need- a hot tub, computer lab, exercise room, laundry, and GREAT food! We ate supper at the man camp and it was absolutely amazing!\n\nI understand that Miss North Dakota will be this busy with her schedule for an entire year and, although I’m sure it’s exhausting, it’s so rewarding! Kate Middleton was once quoted in People Magazine stating her life was “Exhausting. But I wouldn’t have it any other way!”… exactly how I feel right now before going to sleep.\n\nKate Wilson\n\nMiss Grand Forks 2012\n\nToday was a very exciting one! It was wonderful to finally get started with rehearsals, meet the Miss ND committee, and get to know all of the other contestants! Everyone is so nice and welcoming and I feel right at home.\n\nThis morning we started moving into the dorms and after about 10 trips back-and-forth to the car I finally got all settled in! After everyone was moved in we got right to work. We headed to the Old Armory to have lunch and learn our opening number dance. I quickly discovered I should stick to clogging for dancing- because I am not much of a contemporary dancer! I struggled a bit at first but got it down and now I’m ready to have fun while dancing to “The Edge of Glory” for the opening number each night.\n\nDuring lunch the state board and current titleholder, Ariana Walker spoke about what it means to become Miss North Dakota. I have to say, I admire the hard work everyone has put into making Miss North Dakota’s year a successful year. I admire that Ariana has done everything possible to represent North Dakota in a positive way throughout this year and while at Miss America, including working towards the Duke of Edinburgh Award and collecting sponsors for the national program book. I can clearly see that this title has meant the world to her and I admire that she made the most out of her year of service and put her heart into everything she did with this organization. If it is in the cards for me to become Miss North Dakota, I plan to make it one of the most important aspects of my life and work hard to represent my state the best I can.\n\nLater that day, it was time for some relaxation! We all got in comfy clothes and headed over to “spa night” at a beautiful home in Williston. There were many activities to choose from, including a pool, hot tub, massage stations, make up stations, and yoga lessons! This time spent with the other contestants was great because not only was it fun but I was also able to get to know the other girls better…. we have a great group of girls this year!\n\nAt spa night I got the chance to speak with Ariana and I can see that she is sad to give her title away because it has been such an important part of her life. I am already even dreading giving my title of Miss Grand Forks away in the fall- I wish I could be Miss Grand Forks forever! I hope to continue this journey with the Miss America Organization as Miss North Dakota, because I know that I would put my heart into everything I do just as Ariana did this past year. This organization means the world to me and has brought out the best in me; I am now the strong woman I have always wanted to be, and I have the MAO to thank for that. I can’t wait to see what else is in store for me throughout this exciting week.\n\n“Nothing is impossible- the word itself says “I’m Possible” – Audrey Hepburn\n\nKate Wilson\n\nMiss Grand Forks 2012\n\nThis year I had the incredible opportunity to work with a personal trainer to prepare me for the swimsuit competition at the state pageant. Christopher Roche of Snap Fitness donated his time and talent to help me reach my fitness goals and I am proud to say I am in the best shape of my life!\n\nI have been an athlete my whole life, so I thought I knew all there was to working out. I was a competitive runner starting in youth track and field and throughout high school. I made the decision not to run in college but I still run every day for fun and to stay in shape. Chris taught me that there is more to working out than just running/cardio. When we first started working out in November, he had me doing a lot of lifting and arm exercises. I struggled with those at first but now I see that lifting is just as important as cardio! He pushed me both mentally and physically and taught me fitness and nutrition lessons that I will take with me for the rest of my life.\n\nEvery workout started with running on the treadmill. After I finished my “warm up” which usually consisted of 10 minutes at a high pace, he would say “ready to work?” My reply was always “let’s go.” I’ve always been someone who is up for a challenge and Chris challenged me every workout. I would leave the gym tired, sore, and sweaty but I knew that in the end it would all pay off. I am now confident in my body and excited to be onstage for the swimsuit competition! So much so, I agreed to be a part of a before and after photo to show everyone the results from my hard work. We took the photos last night at our final on stage run through of modeling and talent at the Empire.\n\nTraining with Chris was one of my favorite experiences as Miss Grand Forks. He helped mentally and physically prepare me for the Miss North Dakota competition and became a good friend of mine. We joked around a lot but also got a lot of work done! I looked forward to training with him each week and I will miss him; He is moving to Bismarck with his family so Laura and I attended his going away party at Snap Fitness. He will be in the crowd cheering us on in Williston and I hope to make him proud!\n\nThank you, Christopher Roche and Kathy at Snap Fitness, for all of your support. Thank you also to Complete Nutrition, our official nutrition sponsor this year, for offering your guidance and product for us to use as I worked toward my fitness goals.\n\nKate Wilson\n\nMiss Grand Forks 2012\n\nThis weekend was the official Miss North Dakota Contestant Orientation. I was very excited for this because not only did it mean that all of the stressful paperwork was finished, but I also got to meet the other 19 girls competing for the title of Miss North Dakota. There is a great group of girls this year and I am excited to spend time with them in June!\n\nForum was also very encouraging. I enjoyed speaking with Miss North Dakota 2011- Ariana Walker and meeting the state board. They are all such lovely, kind people and I can definitely see myself working well with them should I become Miss North Dakota 2012. Ariana spoke about how being Miss North Dakota is a job, and it reminded me of how much work I’ve already put forward, people I’ve met, and experiences I’ll forever remember as Miss Grand Forks. If it’s in the cards for me to become Miss North Dakota, I am positive that I will work very hard every day at being a role model to children and young adults, an active volunteer throughout my state, and a good representative for the Miss North Dakota Org.\n\nWhat hit home for me more than anything else Ariana said at Forum was “Let go, and Let God.” I have been doing everything in my power to reach my full potential this year but I know that my hard work is all that I have control over. The future Miss North Dakota is decided by five complete strangers; so I need to let go, do my best, and simply see what God has in store for me during pageant week. One thing is for sure, this is going to be an exciting adventure!\n\nKate Wilson\n\nMiss Grand Forks 2012\n\nThis past weekend I had a great time being a part of the Miss Grand Forks & Miss Grand Cities Outstanding Teen Pageant, held at the Empire Arts Center! On Saturday I attended the dress rehearsal and helped the teen contestants with their modeling walks. Last spring, I was a volunteer at Aspen Studio’s “Lights, Camera, Fashion!” show as a modeling coordinator and some of the girls I had coached were competing in the pageant! I was excited to see familiar faces and even more excited to get to know the new girls. I was blown away by how confident and talented each of the contestants were.\n\nThe next day (Sunday) was pageant day. Miss Empire, Miss Eastern Dakota and myself had the opportunity to be emcees for the pageant and perform out talents. This was a great opportunity for us to be on stage and practice our speaking skills. One of the major roles of being Miss North Dakota is being ready for anything and the teen pageant gave us the perfect chance to practice our ‘filling’ skills when the auditors needed more time to tabulate the scores. We were even treated to an impromptu stand-up routine by the hilarious Emily Burkland, Miss Grand Forks 2011 as we filled time on stage as a group. 🙂\n\nI especially enjoyed the chance to perform my talent during the pageant. After watching Miss America and seeing Miss Oklahoma- Betty Thompson perform her Irish Dance, I have been working very hard with my dance and I could not wait to get back up on stage again. I love to dance and I believe my love for Irish Clogging shines through when I am up on the stage and under the bright lights. Words cannot describe how much I am looking forward to sharing my talent in Williston at the Miss North Dakota Pageant.\n\nTo our two new little sisters- I am so proud of you both and I can’t wait to cheer you on this spring! You are both incredibly talented and beautiful girls, and you have just made one of the best decisions of your lives by entering the Miss America Organization. Many opportunities will come your way to grow in every possible way. This year will be fun but also help you with your future goals. Congratulations, Miss Grand Forks’ Outstanding Teen 2012 Alyssa Black and Miss Grand Cities’ Outstanding Teen 2012 Mia Pagnac!\n\nI ended my week visiting one of our fitness sponsors-Complete Nutrition. It was my lucky day because I was greeted by one of the company advisers who had made the trip up all the way from Australia to visit the Grand Forks Complete Nutrition location! He was very helpful and enthusiastic about his job and he made me feel confident that I will reach my fitness goals for this June. Between Complete Nutrition and sponsor Christopher Roach at Snap Fitness, I am very excited for the swimsuit competition at Miss North Dakota. I have been working very hard to live a healthy lifestyle and I am proud of the progress I have made thus far and enthusiastic to keep moving forward. I am very thankful for sponsors Complete Nutrition & Snap Fitness!\n\nKate Wilson\n\nMiss Grand Forks 2012"
