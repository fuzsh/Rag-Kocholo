This allows the removal of the traditional metal cap on the end of the blade that contributed to so many service problems in the past. The fiberglass fabric prevents erosion and foreign objects from exposing the wood fibers to the elements. This gives you a longer lasting wood propeller when cared for properly. A riveted and screwed-on stainless steel leading edge gives additional erosion and damage tolerance.\n\nWide Blade Birch Wood Propeller\n\nAll pitches can be manufactured.

All Sensenich propellers are manufactured under strict production certificate standards, with material certification and 48 point conformity inspection for each experimental category propeller. Propeller pitch is selected as appropriate to aircraft type, engine rating, and climb/cruise preference. Propeller leading edge protection is provided by an inlaid urethane leading edge, which is cast in place on the blade with no aerodynamic penalties. Wood construction propellers are available with fiberglass covering for added environmental and abrasion protection. This is highly recommended for rough fields and/or pusher aircraft. Propeller models with âWCâ model prefix come standard with wood/composite construction. A clear spar varnish finish is standard on wood propellers, with specific color options available for wood propellers and required for wood/composite propellers.\n\nSensenich Wood propellers are available in 52 inch to 90 inch diameters and in numerous pitches to suit your engine power, RPM and speed of your aircraft. Various finishes and colors are available (red, yellow, gray, white, black & clear) including fiberglass cloth covering of blades for protection and added durability for horse operating conditions. Urethane leading edges are included.\n\nApplication Guide for Sensenich Certified Wood Aircraft Propellers\n\nSensenich Propeller Model Designation Explained\n\nNOTE: Many more Sensenich propellers are available including custom wooden designs with much larger diameters.

Includes E4340 forged four main bearing, aviation crankshaft, starter, alternator system, dual CDI ignition, oil cooler, oil filter, large capacity oil pump, intake manifold, RevFlow carburetor with mixture control, SAE1 Propeller bolt pattern, 85 HP at 3200 rpm continuous, 170 pounds dry. OPTIONAL ACCESSORIES ARE AVAILABLE such as Exhaust system, engine mount, engine mount hardware, prop crush plate and alternate air source/ram air filter assembly. This engine is not limited to only wood propellers ! Revmaster has been in business continually since 1959 ! Sensenich wood and carbon adjustable propellers are available for this engine, Call 1-251-609-0969\n\nThe Revmaster propeller flange and their unique thrust bearing setup shown above. No \"shrink-fit\" prop flange to break your crankshaft or to come loose causing your propeller to depart from your aircraft Since the thrust load is absorbed by the thrust bearing on the propeller shaft next to the propeller, the crankshaft journals are not being pulled or pushed, or otherwise highly stressed, by the hundreds of pounds of thrust produced by the propeller. Other VW-based engine conversions use the main bearing on the flywheel end of the engine as their \"thrust bearing\", on the opposite end of the engine where the propeller is mounted !!\n\n==========\n\nCall or email us to request a propeller suggestion, quote or to place your order,\n\nOr use our secure online quote request & order form HERE\n\nBACK TO WARP DRIVE AIRCRAFT PROPS HOME PAGE\n\nBACK TO WARP DRIVE AIRBOAT PROPS HOME PAGE\n\nBACK TO HOVERHAWK HOME PAGE\n\nBACK TO ULTRA PROPS HOME PAGE\n\nBACK TO BOLLY PROPELLERS HOME PAGE\n\n=============================\n\nSELLER'S NOTICE AND DISCLAIMER\n\nPrices, specifications, and availability are subject to change without notice.
