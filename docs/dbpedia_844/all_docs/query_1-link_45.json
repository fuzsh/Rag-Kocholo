If the information in certain places seems\n\nto be lacking, it is because information was withheld, or was not sent in.\n\nIt is in order here to make acknowledgments to those who have contributed\n\nto the record:\n\nA very large contribution has been made by R. Eugene (Sensenig)\n\nMontgomery, who spent time and money in gathering data. Most of the\n\nVirginia Branch, and of the Christian Senseny-Margareth Muller branch\n\nare his contribution, along with other information obtained by examining\n\nwills and deeds.\n\nMrs. Caroline S. Coldren, Secretary of the Lancaster County Historical\n\nSociety, made large contributions by way of untangling some knotty tangles.\n\nShe also contributed much information bearing on the early Sensenigs who\n\nsettled in Lancaster County. She proved that Magdalena Wenger, and not\n\nBarbara Oberholtzer, was the wife of Michael Sensenig, b. 1723.\n\nIsaac G. Sensenig, in reporting for the farm group, sent in over 300\n\nnames and dates. That was a big piece of work.\n\nBertha Sensenich Singer, daughter of Harry W. Sensenich, had access\n\nto the records he had gathered, and which he did not live to complete.\n\nChester D. Sensenich sent us the information about the Irwin branch\n\nof the Sensenich family.\n\nMrs. Magdalena Sensenig Wenger gave us all the information about\n\nthe Franklin County branch of the Goodville group.\n\nAllen Burns Senseney, of Knoxville, Tenn., gave us the information\n\nabout the Tennessee group.\n\nThe compiler of the record had special advantage in having been born\n\nin Lancaster County, from which radiated all the various branches of the\n\nbig “Sensiney” family. As a man seventy-seven years of age and still of\n\nclear mind, and knowing Sensenigs in five generations, he was drafted by\n\nmembers of the Sensenig family to build up the record. He knew the key\n\npersons from whom to get information, and his educational training fitted\n\nhim for the task. He is responsible for the Introduction and the longer\n\narticles appearing in the book. These are based on personal knowledge,\n\nor on information furnished by others.\n\nIt would not be fair not to include the many names of persons who in a lesser degree made contribution to this book, and we shall here set\n\ndown their names and addresses:\n\nRev.

Mary\n\nGood, b. 6-3-1876; d. 7-10-1938—all this means that John Sensenig was born\n\nMay 8, 1875; died August 12, 1942; married Mary Good, who was born\n\nJune 3, 1876, and died July 10, 1938. Mtgy. stands for R. Eugene (Sensenig)\n\nMontgomery; C— stands for Caroline Coldren of the Lancaster County\n\nHistorical Society. B.S. stands for the compiler of this record; J. stands\n\nfor Jeannette Senseny of Chambersburg, Pa.; (*) stands for no issue.\n\nAs to designation:\n\na, b, c, d, etc., designate the members of a family from the oldest to\n\nthe youngest (generally).\n\nIf (a)bcf stands for the head of a family, then by dropping the f, you\n\nwill have (a) be representing his father, found a page or so earlier. Drop\n\nthe c and you have (a)b, representing the grandfather, and (a) will repre¬\n\nsent the great grandfather. In general, by dropping the end letter, you go\n\nback a generation.\n\nOur method of dealing with this matter of lineage is altogether\n\noriginal, and is an attempt to do away with the system of numbers generally\n\nemployed in setting forth the subject, as we find in other books. We think\n\nthere is an advantage in using letters to designate persons. Suppose Christian\n\nSenseny has four sons—a., b., c. and d., then in the preceding paragraph,\n\n(a) bcf would represent the fourth generation in the line of the first son.\n\n(b) bcf would designate the fourth generation in the line of the 2nd son,\n\netc. It will all be plain after you see the system in operation in the treat¬\n\nment of the Christian Senseny-Margaret Muller branch of the family —the\n\nSenseny branch.

Bigotry and\n\nintolerance were rampant. The Catholic Church has never been\n\na democratic institution as to doctrine. Its keynote during these centuries\n\nwas Believe as we tell you or be damned. The Council of Toulouse forbade\n\nthe reading of the Scriptures by laymen, and adopted severe measures against\n\nheresy. In Germany and Switzerland, at this time, only the Catholic,\n\nLutheran, and Reformed churches were tolerated by law. The adherents\n\nof the “sects,” as they were called, were persecuted, and among these were the\n\nMennonites. Yes, the Reformers were persecutors, along with the Catholics.\n\nTo be free of Rome did not make them free of intolerance. It was John\n\nCalvin who was responsible for the burning of Michael Servetus at the\n\nstake, October 27, 1553. Those who believed that there were “infants in\n\nhell a span long,” believed in a cruel God, and they felt they were support¬\n\ning divinity when they persecuted.\n\nDr. Roscoe Lloyd Sensenich, while searching for information relative\n\nto our family, contacted an Austrian army officer, Rudolph Sintzenich, who\n\nstated that in the 16th century the Protestant branch of our family was\n\nforced to flee to Switzerland to avoid persecution, while the Catholic branch,\n\nof which he was a member, remained in Austria. Later, intolerance swept\n\nthem out of Switzerland, also; and upon invitation of William Penn, they\n\nsettled in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe question which immediately presents itself is, Why were the Men¬\n\nnonites persecuted? The main reason is that they didn’t believe in infant\n\nbaptism. They thought the good God would not punish children who had\n\nnot yet come to years of understanding; that children are sinless; that\n\nbaptism should not be administered until people had reached years of\n\naccountability, and of their own volition desired to be baptized. For this\n\nreason, and for lesser reasons, they absented themselves from established\n\nchurches. The Swiss persecution of the Mennonites stands out as a blot\n\non the Protestant Reformation. Both Dutch and German Reformers were\n\nhorrified that Swiss Protestants persecuted Mennonites. It was truly an age\n\nof intolerance.\n\nThe Edict of Nantes, in force from April 30, 1598, till October 20,\n\n1685, allowed Protestants the free exercise of their religion in France, and\n\nthrew open to them all the offices of the state. When the edict was revoked,\n\nabout 500,000 Protestants fled to the Netherlands and to England and other\n\nProtestant countries. These countries gained what France lost, as the best artisans were numbered among these Huguenots. Many of these were Mennonites, who rose to distinction. Mosheim said of them, at a little later\n\nperiod, “It is certain that the Mennonites in Holland at this day are, in their\n\ntables, their equipages, and their country seats, the most luxuriant of the\n\nDutch nation. This is especially true of the Mennonites of Amsterdam.”\n\nWe see that the nonconformist religious groups gravitated from one\n\ncountry to another to escape religious persecution, and among these were\n\nthe Sensenigs, with the variations in spelling the name. They are found\n\nin Jugo-Slavia, Austria, Switzerland, France, Belgium, Holland, Denmark,\n\nGermany, and England. So far as we have been able to find out, all the\n\nold Sensenig Bibles were printed in German. We have not heard of one\n\nprinted in French, and we may safely conclude that the “Sensineys” were\n\nof Germanic stock, though living in other countries than Germany. Those\n\nin France would adopt a spelling to conform to French pronunciation,\n\nSenseney. Those in Germany would spell the name Sensenich or Sentzenich,\n\nthe pronunciation of both ways being the same; and those of Holland,\n\nBelgium, Switzerland, and Denmark would use the ending nig or neg, which\n\nin German would have the same pronunciation as ich. Thus, the German\n\nword ewig (everlasting) is pronounced evich. The word seiigkeit (hap¬\n\npiness) is pronounced like selichkeit. So, the use of ig and ich is a matter\n\nof choice, but ig is shorter and has come into more common use.\n\nOne of our family group travelling in Belgium found a nice house\n\nnamed Chateau Senseneg. From another member of the family we learn\n\nof a family in France, near Lyons, which spelled the name Senseney. We\n\nmay not conclude that the Protestants who fled from France were French.\n\nPeople had gone there because of religious freedom and left again when\n\nthe Edict of Nantes was repealed. If Zimmermans who had been living\n\nin Germany for centuries move to England and take the name Carpenter ,\n\nwhich means the same, and twenty years later move to the United States with\n\nthe name Carpenter, are these people English or German? The fact is that\n\nearly Sensenig wills were written in German. Dr. Peter Senseney named his\n\nhouse Germany , and he had a German Bible. Michael Sensenig married\n\nMagdalena Wenger, and we know that both Sensenigs and Wengers were in\n\nAustria 500 years ago. The Sensenigs, under the name Sintzenich, were at\n\nUlm on the Danube in Austria in 1505. The record of the name is found on\n\npage 17, book 5, of Erklarung des Wappans, in Vienna. This subject\n\nembraces the explanations of coats of arms. There was a Sintzenich coat\n\nof arms, of which we shall speak in the Appendix.\n\nTo revert to the spelling of the name, Faust and Brumbaugh wrote two\n\nvolumes containing lists of Swiss Emigrants in the 18th Century to the\n\nAmerican Colonies, and in the 2nd volume incidentally mention the fact that\n\nMargareth Muller was married to Christian Sinzenig. In Patent Book A,\n\nVolume XIII, we find the farm patented to Jacob Sensiney. In signing a\n\nrelease of a part of the land, the three sons of Jacob signed: John Sinsinigh,\n\nPeter Sensenig, and Michael Sentzenig. Take notice that the ending in each\n\ncase has the effect of nig. These three sons, each in his own way, tried to\n\ngive English expression to the name. The brothers didn’t always write the\n\nname in the same way. Michael, at different times, signed Sinsinig, Sen-\n\nsenich, Sensenigh, Sinsenig , and on his tombstone we read Sensnig. When\n\nMichael signed Sinsenig , his wife, Magdalena, made it Sensenich; and one\n\nof her sons, Christian, adopted that way of spelling the name. But now a\n\nmajority of the “Sensineys” spell it Sensenig. Rupp, in his History of\n\nLancaster County, written over a hundred years ago, spoke of the Sensineys,\n\nand that is in line with the popular pronunciation.\n\nThe early Sensenigs were Mennonites, and were opposed to taking part\n\nin civil government, and you look in vain for the name Sensenig on the\n\ncivil list. But to my surprise, I found them taking part in military training\n\nafter the Revolutionary War, between 1783 and 1790. We find Sensenig\n\nnames on the militia rolls of Lancaster County. They may have served under\n\npressure. Be that as it may, the record appears, as follows:\n\nChristian Senseney was a part of Captain Werntz’s Company, 8th\n\nBattalion of Lancaster County Militia in 1784. Isaac Senseney served in\n\nJohn Armor’s Company in 1786. Abraham Sensenich served in William\n\nSkiles’ Company. Peter Senseney was to have been in the York Co. Militia,\n\nbut he wouldn’t serve and was heavily fined. Jacob Sensnick served in\n\nCaptain Henry’s Company in 1786. Since Mennonites are opposed to war,\n\none wonders how it came about that these men took military training.\n\nPerhaps, they chose the lesser of two evils, as we are doing today. In the\n\nKellog Pact we set ourselves against war as a means of settling world\n\ndisputes, but today we are arming to the hilt in the greatest war of all times.\n\nDoes this seem unreasonable? Let’s look into this matter:\n\nIf the sheep in a certain field stand for peace and righteousness and\n\nare animated by high Christian motives, and the wolves in the adjacent field\n\nbelieve in the god of force and deride the lofty sentiment of the sheep, what\n\nwill happen to the sheep? Can we afford to let it happen? No! We must\n\nfight that righteousness may not perish from the face of the earth. We\n\nmust fight to maintain the gains that have been made through Christian\n\nteaching. War is dreadful, but honor demands that we stand for the right\n\neven unto death. Jesus died for the truth. All the world knew that America\n\nstood for peace, and for the rights of weaker nations; but while we were\n\npreparing for peace others prepared for war; and shall we now let these\n\nbandit nations get away with the loot of the world? We must fight that\n\nrighteousness may have a chance to make headway in the world. As the\n\nson of a Mennonite, that represents my view. After all, peace is only one\n\nword in the Christian catalogue of words. I have great respect for the man\n\nwho is willing to die for what he thinks is right. To die for a good cause\n\nis unselfish; to live in peace, and wear away one’s life trying to make\n\nmoney, is selfish. Peace in the ultimate is what we are all striving for, but\n\nbefore it can be achieved, I think great battles will have to be fought. Those\n\nwho spurn the Christian philosophy of life will have to be beaten into\n\nsubmission. America stands for peace but not at any price.\n\nAs to taking part in civil life, the Mennonites in Europe shrank from\n\ntaking part in government, and there was reason for this. The governing\n\nauthority persecuted them. But in this democratic country, where govern¬\n\nment is as good as the people make it, what religious scruples can anybody\n\nhave against taking part in government? Those who are anxious that\n\nrighteousness should prevail in government should by all means register\n\ntheir convictions. My father was a Mennonite and took active part in\n\nelections. David M. Sensenig constantly strove for righteousness in politics,\n\nand voted at every election as a Christian duty.\n\nThe sects have made large contribution to the cause of freedom of\n\nthought, but now that there are so many sects, representing all phases of\n\nreligious thought, the challenge to these sects is to cooperate for the good\n\nof all. Instead of tearing apart, let’s get together and work for the common\n\ngood. Already, the various Methodist groups have consolidated into one\n\nbody, and now there is an effort in progress to unite Methodists, Presby¬\n\nterians, and Episcopalians into one body. We all think about the same as\n\nto essentials of Christian belief, and why should the unessentials keep us\n\napart? After all, people can think differently and belong to the same church.\n\nI like the spirit of the Sensenichs who helped to start the Evangelical church\n\nat Bridgeville, though they were Mennonites.\n\nEvery Sensenig will be interested as to the time when the first Sensenigs\n\ncame to this country. Between 1726 and 1776, thirty thousand immigrants\n\ncame to Pennsylvania. You will not find the Sensenigs among these. They\n\nhad come earlier. Jacob Sensenig married Maria Krey in this country and\n\ntheir oldest child Michael was born in 1723. Margareth Muller came here\n\nin 1714-15 and married Christian Sensenig, Jacob’s brother. We have good\n\nreason to think that they were married before 1720. They were both from\n\nSwitzerland and probably knew each other before they came here; both\n\nfleeing from persecution. The Society of Friends in their yearly meeting\n\nin London in 1709 voted fifty pounds to help poor Mennonites to make the\n\nbig journey across the Atlantic. In 1711 and 1717 larger numbers came,\n\nand we think the Sensenigs were among these. For a while, they lived in\n\nthe vicinity of Germantown, and from there made prospector’s journeys into\n\nLancaster County (before it was a separate County), where Jacob and brother\n\nChristian chose land a short distance apart in what was later Earl Township.\n\nPoor Mennonites also managed to get to Pennsylvania. They would\n\nwork for several years for their more fortunate brothers to pay for their\n\nship-passage. The Mennonite church also contributed money to this end.\n\nWe have a record of Jacob Sensenig, contributing sixty dollars to help pay\n\nfor the ship-passage of Christian Eshelman and family of six children. Let\n\nus also remember that the passage of the Atlantic in those days was a\n\ngruelling experience. Only rugged people could stand the voyage. It is\n\nestimated that as many as two thousand people died in one year in the trips\n\nover the Atlantic. The voyage was long and tedious, and impure water\n\nand filthy living conditions were factors in turning ships into hospitals;\n\nand Philadelphia, the port of destination, became the medical center of\n\nAmerica, a distinction which it still holds. All honor to the pioneers who\n\nbraved the voyage across the Atlantic and the privations of the wilderness.\n\nIn looking over the record, the reader will find the farm group\n\nexceeding in number all the rest of the big “Sensiney” family. Like Phillips\n\nBrooks, we can pride ourselves in having forty generations of farmers at\n\nour back. It is a great advantage to have been born on a farm and to have\n\ngrown to manhood on it. The diversity of farm life leads to the acquisition\n\nof many skills. A well-conducted farm is a big school. Boys and girls\n\nfrom the farms are as a rule very practical, and are not afraid to face\n\nthe issues of life; and they are not too lazy to put forth the effort to achieve\n\nsuccess. When a farm boy goes in for the higher education, he generally\n\nachieves success, because he learns to give expression to a well-rounded\n\nexperience which has already been acquired on the farm. The case of\n\nDavid M. Sensenig demonstrates what a farm boy can do in the educational\n\nfield.\n\nI was born on a farm and lived on it for eight years, when my father\n\nmoved into the village of Goodville. In my early teens, my father felt\n\nthat it would be to my advantage to spend a summer on a farm to learn\n\nto do a day’s work. I consider the summer on the farm as rich in expe¬\n\nrience, and my sympathy to this day is with the working classes. The high-\n\nhat crowd which are afraid to put their hands to the plow, are at a discount\n\nin my thinking. The farm group has the largest families, because the farm\n\nis the best place to raise a large family.\n\nFinally, the stress of this book is on character, rather than on wealth\n\nand public glamor. The dominant strain of the family is sympathetic. The\n\nfirst Jacob showed this strain when he helped to bring over Eshelman and\n\nhis family in 1770. His brother Christian is spoken of by Hans Huber\n\nin his will as “his good and trusty friend Christian Sensenny.” I have found\n\nthis sympathetic strain in all branches of the family. The fact that the\n\nfamily has furnished more than twenty doctors is further confirmation of the\n\nsympathetic strain. Another characteristic strain is friendliness. The\n\n“Sensineys” are friendly and cheerful, but they will not let arrogant people\n\nwalk over them. May we all measure up to the high standards which have\n\nbeen set by the best representatives of our family.\n\nB.S.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nTHE SENSENY BRANCH\n\nT HE “Sensineys” who have sprung from the union of Christian Senseny\n\nand Margareth Muller spell the name Senseny, excepting those\n\ndescended through John Senseney.\n\nIn Land Warrant Book, Index No. 77, 150 acres of land are set down\n\nin the name of Christian Sensiney. This tract was surveyed January 27,\n\n1734. It was returned April 22, 1747, as 216 acres. Reference: Patent\n\nBook A-9-266; Survey Book C-182-179.\n\nIn the Patent Book, his name is Senzenich. In the Survey Book, it is\n\nChristian Senzeney, alias, Christian Sansanick.\n\nHis land joined that of Jacob Milin, Christian Martin, and Dr. Lewis,\n\nand land not yet taken.\n\nIn A-9-266, the stipulation for payments is: “On the 1st of March, each\n\nyear, he must pay to the Penn heirs a half-penny Sterling per acre.”\n\nChristian was naturalized September 25, 1747 (Pennsylvania Archives,\n\n2nd volume of the 2nd series, page 374).\n\nA photostat of his will is on file with the Lancaster County Historical\n\nSociety. He lived near New Holland; made his will May 12, 1753, and\n\ndied June 1753. C—\n\nIn his will, he names his. wife Margaret, and his sons—Jacob, Michael,\n\nJohn, and Christian. In the body of the will he gives each of his sons a\n\nfarm, and provides that Margaret shall continue to dwell in her house as\n\nlong as she lives.\n\nMargaret and Jacob were the executors of his estate. Both Jacob and\n\nJohn were doctors.\n\nWhen Hans Hoober ordained Christian Sensenny as an executor of his\n\nwill, he alluded to him as “My well beloved and trusty friend.” That state¬\n\nment helps us to estimate Christian as a man.\n\nWe shall name this branch of the family The Senseny Branch, and the\n\nreader will find the name spelled that way throughout this chapter, excepting\n\nthe offspring of Dr. John Senseney.\n\nChristian Senseny married Margaret Muller, who came to this country\n\nfrom Switzerland in 1714-15. He and his brother Jacob acted in consort.\n\nThey acted and planned together. In the Land Warrant Book, Jacob’s\n\nnumber is 76 and Christian’s 77.

The farm on which he lived and on which is the family grave¬\n\nyard, is now in possession of Ernest Senseny. Dr. John has only a\n\nsandstone as a memorial.

John owned property\n\nin Warwick Twp., also, in the city of Lancaster, a residence on North\n\nQueen Street. He also owned stock in the Phila. and Lane. Turnpike\n\nCo., and was County Commissioner in 1795. At the time of his death\n\nhe was a tax-collector. He met his death when a bandit frightened\n\nhis horse, causing it to stumble and fall down the steep bank of\n\nCocalico Creek. Several days later his body was found several miles\n\ndown stream, and his wallet was missing. He and his wife were\n\nburied on Zwalley farm until several years ago, when his remains\n\nwere interred in Jerusalem Evangelical churchyard, Rothsville, Pa.\n\nThere were no children born to this union.\n\n(b)b.

Dr. Abraham moved from Lan¬\n\ncaster County in 1781.\n\nDr. Senseny was born in New Holland, Lancaster Co., Pa., and at an\n\nearly age went to York and began the study of his profession. He\n\nremained in that town till 1781 and then made Chambersburg his\n\npermanent home. He probably studied medicine under Dr. Peter in\n\nYork, as Peter resided there in 1781. Dr. Abraham practiced medi¬\n\ncine in Chambersburg for 63 years.\n\nOne night as Dr. Abraham was sitting in his office, he was confronted\n\nby two heavily armed bandits, who asked him to go with them to\n\nattend a very sick woman. They promised that no harm would come\n\nto him, but that he would have to allow himself to be blindfolded\n\nafter they left the town. His wife urged him not to go, but he said,\n\n“If a very sick woman needs my services I must go.” He went with\n\nthem quite a long distance before they dismounted from their horses.\n\nHe was led into a cave to the sick woman, who gave birth to a baby\n\nbefore the doctor left. They brought him back blindfolded to the\n\nedge of tlie town, where they gave him a bag of gold, and told him\n\nnot to look around until he no longer heard their horses’ hoofs. These\n\nmen were English bandits who lived in a cave several miles from\n\nChambersburg. J.\n\nThe children born to this union: (4th Gen.)\n\na. Catherine, b. 1-25-1787; d. 8-13-1876;\n\nb.

William Davis Senseny, M.D., graduated from Jefferson College\n\nin 1861, came home with his diploma, and an appointment as\n\nsurgeon in the army, but died in May, 1861, as the result of over¬\n\nwork while at college. J.\n\n(b)bbac. Benjamin Rush Senseny, M.D., m. Rosalie Johnson Murdoch of\n\nSt. Louis, a woman greatly beloved by the whole town. She was\n\nthe first President of the Literary Club, which established the\n\nLibrary. There was only one child born to this union:\n\na. Jeannette Senseny.\n\nDr. Benjamin Rush Senseny was internationally famous, as appears\n\nin the following article:\n\nThe Sensenys of Chambersburg, Pa., practiced medicine for about\n\na hundred years, and Dr. Benjamin Rush Senseny, born December\n\n12, 1842, was a member of the fifth generation of Sensenys to\n\npractice medicine. He was educated in the Chambersburg schools\n\nand academy, and at the age of twenty years presented himself\n\nbefore a board of United States army surgeons in Philadelphia,\n\npassed a creditable examination, and was commissioned a cadet\n\nsurgeon in the United States army. This commission has been\n\npreserved and bears the signature of Edwin M. Stanton, secretary\n\nof war, and is dated February 26, 1863.\n\nDr. Senseny was at once placed in Cherry Hill Hospital, Phila¬\n\ndelphia, but was soon transferred to Jefferson Barracks, St. Louis,\n\nMissouri. While there he studied medicine in Pope Medical\n\nCollege, and in 1864 was granted the M.D. degree. Smallpox\n\nwas prevalent in that section, and the doctor gained wide expe¬\n\nrience in treating the disease. In 1866, he returned to Chambersburg and entered practice with his father.\n\nDr. Benjamin Rush Senseny was disabled in childhood, and never\n\nenjoyed robust health. With the hope of recovering failing health,\n\nhe went to a mining camp in White Pine Valley in western Nevada.\n\nDuring the winter of 1868-69, smallpox spread in the camp, and\n\nDr. Senseny was the only doctor within 200 miles, and he was\n\ncompelled to treat the epidemic as best he could, under threats\n\nof guns and pistols. Later, in writing of this experience, he said,\n\n“No pen can adequately describe the horrors that confronted me\n\nduring my sojourn in that plague-stricken charnel house of the\n\nWhite Pine Mountains of Nevada.”\n\nWith his health renewed, Dr. Senseny returned to Chambersburg\n\nin 1874, and established the Pennsylvania Vaccine Farm in Hamil¬\n\nton Twp., on a farm owned by his father, and named Goshen.\n\nHere, healthy young heifers from four to six months old were\n\nleased from farmers for a period of four weeks. The Gernsey\n\nstock was preferred because of having a thinner skin. At times,\n\nthe farm had as many as a hundred calves under treatment, and\n\nin the course of six years more than a thousand heifers were used\n\nto produce the animal vaccine.\n\nDr. Senseny had ready sale for large quantities of this animal\n\nvirus, and over a wide range of country; and a general agency\n\nfor its distribution was established in Philadelphia. This virus\n\nwas shipped as far as the Sandwich Islands, Japan, China, Africa,\n\nNew Zealand, and Canada. The United States government was\n\na heavy purchaser, for use in the army and navy and marine corps.\n\nIn a California epidemic, 40,000 persons were vaccinated in a\n\nshort time by virus made by Dr. Senseny in Chambersburg. The\n\nGovernor of Mississippi expressed thanks to Dr. Senseny for\n\npromptly supplying virus to head off a great epidemic in his state.\n\nToday, a case of smallpox is rarely seen, and yet, less than a\n\ncentury ago, one was expected to have at least a touch of small¬\n\npox, just as now, one expects children to get the measles.\n\n“The small insignificant operation of vaccination with animal\n\nvirus, now so universally performed, has done more for the human\n\nrace than any other procedure recorded in the history of man¬\n\nkind.” The city of Chambersburg is highly honored in having\n\nhad as a citizen Dr. Benjamin Rush Senseny, whose labors resulted\n\nin preventing the dreaded epidemics of smallpox. Dr. Jenner\n\nmade the first successful experiment in vaccinating a boy with\n\nvirus obtained from a milkmaid’s hand infected with cow pox,\n\nbut milkmaids with infected hands were not at hand when small¬\n\npox epidemics broke out, and epidemics continued until Dr.\n\nSenseny produced virus on a large scale. All honor to Dr.\n\nSenseny.\n\nThe strain of this great work was too much for the delicate health\n\nof Dr. Senseny, and his life ended March 28, 1880, not yet 37\n\nyears old. No other member of the “Sensiney” family is more\n\nworthy of honor. (This article is based on a paper read before\n\na doctor’s meeting in Chambersburg.) B.S.\n\n(b)bbad. In Dr. Edgar Nevin Senseny centered the last hope of a long line\n\nof physicians. The news of his death came as a startling reality,\n\nand everyone had a kind word to say of him, courtly and talented,\n\nthe very ideal of strength and beauty centered in him, the last\n\nof a long line of physicians conspicuous in southern Pennsylvania.\n\nHe had graduated with high honors from Jefferson Medical College\n\nin 1870.

Jeannette Senseny, B.Music, the only daughter of Dr. Benjamin\n\nRush Senseny, taught music in Wilson College for twenty-seven\n\nyears, and has made an enviable record; not only in her chosen\n\nfield of work but as a very lovable person, who endeared herself to\n\nall the students that came under her training. Jeannette is so very\n\nmodest that we could get her to say little about herself; but,\n\nindirectly, we have found out that she endeared herself to many\n\npeople. Miss Florence Wilkinson, in writing from Middletown\n\nwith reference to the Virginia branch of the family says: “I\n\nenjoyed so much to have Jeannette from Chambersburg with us\n\nfor a few days. She is delightful to know.” You always find\n\nJeannette helping someone who needs assistance. She is cer¬\n\ntainly following in the footsteps of her father in trying to do a\n\nlot of good in the world. Wouldn’t Christian and Margaret\n\nMuller Senseny be glad to know that Jeannette belongs to their\n\nline of the big “Sensiney” family? Well, we Sensenigs are\n\nproud to call her cousin. B.S.\n\nJeannette has written a book—“Singing Made Easy,” which may\n\nbe obtained by writing to her at 127 North Main Street, Cham¬\n\nbersburg, Pa. I think I shall buy one of those books, as I need\n\nthings made pretty easy along that line.\n\nJeannette has a book on medicine printed in 1578 in Germany,\n\na volume treating of rare medicinal herbs, now 364 years old,\n\nbound in leather, with silver clasps. She holds on tight to that\n\nbook.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE FIRST THREE GENERATIONS OF THE JACOB SENSENIG\n\nBRANCH OF THE “SENSINEY” FAMILY\n\nW E HAVE been told many things that have come down by word of\n\nmouth, and this we call tradition. Though tradition is not history,\n\nit is generally based on fact. Tradition says that three brothers came\n\nhere from Switzerland, lived a while in the Germantown vicinity, and then\n\nmoved to Lancaster County, before it was a separate county, and took land\n\nin what was later Earl Township. It is further asserted that Jacob and\n\nChristian married and their brother John remained a bachelor. Now, let\n\nus look at the record to see how much of this can be substantiated.\n\nIn the Land Warrant Book, in charge of the Secretary of Internal Affairs\n\nat Harrisburg, we find that warrant No. 76 is to Jacob Sensiney and warrant\n\nNo. 77 is to Christian Sensiney, and that both warrants are dated January\n\n27, 1734, showing that these two men worked together with the same purpose\n\nin view. John later took land contiguous to Jacob’s tract, but relinquished\n\nit to Michael Witwer (Witware), either because he made a profit by the\n\ntransaction, or because he couldn’t fulfill the stipulations of the agreement\n\ninto which he had entered. A third reason may have been that he was\n\nmoving to another part of the county. From this point forward we know\n\nnothing more of John.\n\nFoust and Brumbaugh in their two volumes on “Lists of Swiss Emi¬\n\ngrants in the 18th Century to the American Colonies,” speak of a property\n\nsettlement in Switzerland in which it is revealed that Margaret Muller came\n\nhere with her brothers in 1714 and married Christian Sinzenig. This is our\n\nChristian, as later facts prove. It is also well proved that Jacob Sensiney\n\nmarried Maria Krey while living in the Germantown area. The Kreys had\n\ncome here quite early, in the 17th century.\n\nThough land was not surveyed for Jacob and Christian before 1734,\n\nit must not be assumed that they had not already lived on the tracts they\n\nhad later surveyed for themselves. Johnny B. Sensenig, forty-six years ago,\n\ntold me that Jacob and his bride came to their future farm in 1722. Johnny\n\nwas then about 80 years of age and of clear mind, and he said he had often\n\nheard his parents speak about the matter, and he showed me the place\n\nwhere they alighted and where they built a shelter. All this twelve years\n\nbefore the Penns surveyed the land for them.\n\nWhen a boy in my teens, I was told by John S. Weaver, who was then\n\nwell on to eighty years of age, that people would come into Lancaster County\n\nfrom the Germantown area to prospect for land, and when they had found\n\na tract that pleased them, with a good spring of water on it, they would\n\nbreak the tops of the shrubbery and small trees about the spring and bend\n\nthem down, to show other prospectors that the land was being applied for.\n\nThat would prevent duplicate claims for the same tract. Then to assure\n\nthe tract to themselves, they would move on it, and have it surveyed later,\n\nand enter into a gradual payment plan, and the farm would be patented\n\nto them when the final payment was made. Thus we find that Jacob’s tract\n\nwas surveyed in 1734, but the 155% acres were not patented to him till\n\n1747, Christian’s tract was also patented to him in 1747, and it had been\n\nstipulated that on the 1st of March, each year, he was to pay the Penn\n\nHeirs one-half penny sterling per acre; or for his farm of 216.95 acres,\n\nhe would pay about $2.17 in our money. That seems very little, but we\n\nmust remember that dollars bought more in those days than now. After\n\n1747, these brothers paid no more money to the Penns.\n\nJACOB SENSENIG\n\nAll the “Sensineys” will want to know something about these early\n\nSensineys who had come here from Europe. Were they men of good\n\nstanding among the people? We find that there were two doctors in the\n\nChristian Senseny family and also two in Jacob’s family. That speaks\n\nstrongly of their native ability. Would they help a friend in need? As to\n\nJacob, we have the following testimonial which has come to hand through\n\nFayette C. Eshelman, M.D., the historian for the Eshelman family, who has\n\nin his possession the diary of Deacon Wenger, in which is found this\n\nmemorandum: “On November 18, 1770, I, Joseph Wenger, have handed\n\nover to Nicholas Schantz money which I have borrowed from old Jacob\n\nSensenig, which shall be used to pay for the ship-passage of Christian\n\nEshelman, of the sum of twelve pounds.” In other words, Jacob Sensenig\n\nput up $60 to help pay for the ship-passage of Christian Eshelman, his wife\n\nand six children, October 29, 1770, on the Ship Sally. Dr. Eshelman says,\n\n“No doubt, Jacob Sensenig made this loan out of the goodness of his heart\n\nand for the Mennonite cause.”\n\nOne testimonial like that is sufficient to give us a line on the character\n\nof Jacob Sensenig, from whom all the Lancaster County Sensenigs and\n\nSensenichs, and also the Virginia Senseneys, have sprung.\n\nThe picture shows a part of the original log house now used as a shed.\n\nThe house was very well built, and the slab of plaster work on the left end\n\nof the house is about 220 years old and has not crumbled. The timber work\n\nis also of the best. This, also, in an indirect way, bears witness of the\n\ncharacter of the first Jacob.\n\nJacob Sensenig married Maria Krey, daughter of John and Helena\n\nKrey. The Kreys had come here in the latter part of the 17th century\n\nAfter Helena died, John married Sytge Updegraff; and when John died,\n\nshe married Herbert Cassell. We do not know the date of marriage of\n\nJacob and Maria, but it must have been about 1722; as Michael, their\n\noldest child, was born in 1723. The children born to this union: (2nd Gen.)\n\na. Michael Sensenig (1723-1801);\n\nb. Mary Sensenig, married in 1762 to Michael Witwer (2nd wife) ;\n\nc. Gertraut Sensenig, m. David Martin;\n\nd. Jacob Sensenig (1730-1814) ;\n\ne. John Sensenig, Practitioner of Physic, located at Middletown, Pa.;\n\nf. Peter Senseney, b. 1738; d. 9-7-1804.\n\nReckoning the first three brothers as the first generation, the above\n\nnamed family of children represent the 2nd generation, and we shall now\n\nlist the third generation.\n\nThe Third Generation:\n\n(a) Michael Sensenig, b. 1723, married the oldest daughter of Christian\n\nWenger, Magdalena Wenger, b. 8-26-1729. Both Wengers and Sensenigs\n\nwere in Austria 500 years ago. Some 300 Palatines came here on the\n\nship Molly in 1727, and among these was Christian Wenger; but he\n\nmay have been in Lancaster County as early as 1718, if he is the\n\nWenger spoken of by Rupp in his History of Lancaster County. Be\n\nthat as it may, the following is the well authenticated family of Christian\n\nWenger into whose family Michael Sensenig married:\n\nChristian Wenger married to Eve Grabill, d. 1790, had this family:\n\na. Magdalena Wenger, b. 8-26-1729; m. Michael Sensenig;\n\nb. Hans, b. 3-9-1731; m. Anna Shirk (0. C. Docket 1791, Cocalico\n\nTwp.);\n\nc. Christian, b. 3-23-1733;\n\nd. Mary, b. 11-27-1734; m. Joseph Long (Long Bible Photostat in\n\nthe Lancaster County Historical Society);\n\ne. Eve, b. 10-10-1736; m. Henry Weaver;\n\nf. Barbara, b. 11-11-1739 (died before release was signed);\n\ng. Michael, b. 8-1-1741; m. 1st, Mary Groff; 2nd,-Good;\n\n3rd, Landis;\n\nh. Elizabeth, b. 7-4-1745; m. Henry Sheibly (Biograph. Annual,\n\nLane. Co.);\n\ni. Joseph, b. 8-8-1747; m. 1st, Barbara Hoover (1747-1792); 2nd,\n\nAnna Hochman; C—\n\nj. Abraham, b. 10-9-1749;\n\nk. Henry, b. 10-25-1753; m. Anna Huber, b. 1755; d. in Virginia.\n\nSince so many relationships crop out in the above record, we thought\n\nTombstone of Michael Sensenig Tombstone of Jacob Senseni\n\n(1723-1801) (1730-1814)\n\nPart of Original House\n\nit worth while to include it in our record. In addition to the above\n\nrecord, the signatures of Michael Sensenig and his wife Magdalena are\n\nfound in different recorded documents, and no other fact is better\n\nestablished than that Magdalena was the wife of Michael Sensenig,\n\nb. 1723. However, note the fact that Michael was six years older than\n\nMagdalena, and might have been married before. And bearing on\n\nthis point, we have the following notice which appeared in the Pennsyl¬\n\nvania German Magazine, Vol. 2, page 442 (printed at Lititz, Pa.) :\n\n“Elizabeth Reiff was married to Michael Sensenig by Rev. A. J. Fretz,\n\nOak Ridge, Passaic Co., New Jersey.”\n\nMichael’s sister, Mary, had three sons married to Reiff girls, and their\n\nfather may have had a sister Elizabeth, who would have been of\n\nMichael’s age, and to whom he may have been married. The following\n\nchildren were born to Michael and Magdalena:\n\na. Jacob Sensenig, b. 10-9-1751; d. 1803;*\n\nb. Christian Sensenig, b. 3-12-1757; d. 1-12-1832;\n\nc. Michael Sensenig, d. 1806;\n\nd. John Sensenig, b. 10-12-1764; d. 10-18-1826;\n\ne. Mary, m. Henry Buckwalter. She was his 2nd wife. By the 1st\n\nwife Henry had three daughters—Magdalene, Mary, and Barbara.\n\nMtgy.\n\n(b) Mary Sensenig, married in 1762 Michael Witwer. Their family:\n\na. Jonas S. Witwer, b. 2-24-1763; m.

Mtgy.\n\n(d) Jacob Sensenig, b. 1730; d. 1814, to whom, the first Jacob deeded the\n\nfarm, was married to Barbara -. He was a public-spirited\n\ncitizen, as appears from the following:\n\nThe first public school in Pennsylvania was founded in New Holland,\n\nPa., in 1786, and Frank R. Diffenderfer, in writing the history of the\n\nschool gives a list of the subscribers to the school fund in terms of\n\nmoney and services. Among the subscribers we find Jacob Sensenig,\n\nwho contributed a log and hauled it free of charge to the schoolhouse\n\nwhich was building, though he lived several miles away.\n\nDr. Diffenderfer, as a boy went to this school, and dedicated this little\n\nstanza in Pennsylvania dutch in appreciation:\n\n“Do bin ich ganga in die Schul;\n\nWo ich nicht war gans kle;\n\nDort war dar Meschter in seim Stuhl;\n\nDort war sei Wip, and dort sei Ruhl;\n\nIch kans noch alles seh.”\n\nWhen Jacob was 82 years old, he willed the plantation on which he\n\nwas living to Daniel, his son. This will is K-l-593, Earl Twp., June 15,\n\n1812; and this will was signed by these children (we have included\n\nDaniel):\n\na. Daniel, b. 8-12-1782; d. 7-28-1841; m. Eliza McQuate;\n\nb. John (1784-1870); m. Esther Buckwalter;\n\nc. Jacob (1778-1841) ; never married;*\n\nd. Mary (1762-1840) m. John Shirk, son of Peter Shirk, d. 1870;\n\ne. Anna, m. Andrew Summers, and they had these children: Jacob;\n\nNancy, who married Jacob Witmer; Barbara, who married John\n\nNiekirk; Elizabeth, who married John Strite; Magdalena;\n\nCatherine, who married Henry Harsh; John.\n\nf. Elizabeth, m. John Weaver;\n\ng. Esther, m. Joseph Resh (b. 1771), moved to Washington Co., Md.;\n\nh. Sarah married Peter Shirk. She was his 2nd wife, and mother\n\nof Joseph, the inventor, b. 1-30-1820; d. 8-19-1902. He was the\n\nfather of six sons and seven daughters. Among the sons were\n\nPeter Shirk, machinist, Blue Ball, Pa., and Rev. Christian Shirk\n\nof the Methodist Church.\n\ni. Fronica, m. Isaac Witmer, her cousin, b. 12-14-1789; d. 4-30-1876.\n\nCousin Daniel Witwer was the executor of this will; dated March\n\n26, 1814. C— and Mtgy.\n\nNote on Jacob:\n\nJacob died in 1814 at the age of 84 years. We know that Barbara\n\n-was his wife from 1785 to 1814 and she outlived him; and\n\nwe have reasons for thinking that she was considerably younger and\n\nwas his 2nd wife. If she had been as old as he was, she would have\n\nbeen 59 years old when Fronica was born (1789). We have in our\n\nfiles a record from the farm graveyard, copied from the tombstone of\n\nJacob, a bachelor, who died in 1841 at the age of 63 years. This\n\nrecord states that he was the son of Jacob and Elizabeth. If there has\n\nbeen no mistake made in copying this record, we are led to infer that\n\nall the children born before Jacob, the bachelor, were also children\n\nof Jacob and Elizabeth.\n\n(e) John Sensenig, who wrote his name John Sinsinigh in signing a release,\n\nwas a “Practitioner of Physic,” who held forth at Middletown, now\n\nin Dauphin County, where he paid taxes in Paxtang Township in 1780.\n\nHis wife’s name was Anna. There is nothing in Dauphin County records\n\nto give us information. John and Anna may have had children. Mtgy.\n\nMrs. Coldren has sent us this note:\n\nWhen Charles Christopher died in 1767, he had no direct heirs. But\n\nin a release dated November 4, 1772, we find the release signed by\n\nJohn and Anna Sensenig. Anna was probably a niece of Charles\n\nChristopher. C—\n\n(f) Peter Sensenig, born in 1738, was the youngest member of the original\n\nJacob Sensenig family, who married first Ursula Shoneur, the widow\n\nof his first cousin Christian. His 2nd wife was Maria Holl. Peter\n\nwas born in Earl Twp., Lancaster Co., Pa., and moved to York County,\n\nand from there he went to the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, where he\n\nbecame a very prominent man. He stands at the head of the Virginia\n\nBranch and we shall speak of him at greater length under that heading.\n\n1171192\n\nTHE PIKE MENNONITE GROUP OF THE SENSENIG FAMILY\n\nLineage:\n\nJacob Sensenig, married to Maria Krey;\n\nMichael Sensenig (1723-1801), married Magdalena Wenger;\n\nMichael Sensenig (died 1806), married Barbara Shirk;\n\nPeter Sensenig (1790-1872), married to Anna Wenger.\n\nPeter is the progenitor of the Pike Mennonite Group.\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE PIKE MENNONITE GROUP\n\nT HIS branch of the Sensenig family was chiefly instrumental in starting\n\nthe Pike Mennonite Church; and one of their number, Aaron Sensenig,\n\nwas a minister in that church. Peter Sensenig (1790-1870) stands at\n\nthe head of this group.

He was a\n\nman rather tall and slender, and no member of the family inclined\n\nto corpulency. My father was almost six feet tall and weighed about 175\n\npounds. Our grandfather first lived on his farm bordering Goodville,\n\nraised his family on it, and moved away when Martin married and moved\n\non the farm. He first conducted a store on a small scale at the crossroads\n\nnorth of Goodville. Later he and his oldest son Michael started a store\n\nat Spring Grove. They sold this business place to John High, and built\n\nthe large hardware store on the main street and in the center of Goodville,\n\nassociating his two sons, Michael and Peter, with him in the business. The\n\nlast named had been a clerk in the store of Jonas Martin in Lancaster, and\n\nwas well equipped to become the dynamic partner he proved himself to be.\n\nTo quote from the History of Lancaster County: “This was one of the best\n\nequipped enterprises of the interior of the County.” Upon the death of\n\nthe Senior member of the firm, and the sale of the farm in 1873, Martin,\n\nwho had been in charge of the farm, became a member of the firm, and\n\nthe name of the firm from this time on was The Sensenig Hardware Com*\n\npany. In 1879, this firm purchased the store of J. S. Weaver and Son,\n\nand Michael became the managing partner of that store, while Martin and\n\nPeter gave their close attention to the hardware business. The drygoods\n\nstore was rebuilt and the hardware store was enlarged. The hardware\n\nstore far and near was referred to as one of the conspicuous landmarks of\n\nlocal business history.\n\nMichael Sensenig , b. 10-20-1805; d. 10-11-1870; m.

Their family will appear in the Sensenich group.\n\n(f) Michael M. Sensenig, the oldest son to grow to manhood, and the\n\nsenior member of the Sensenig Hardware Company, married when he\n\nwas about forty years of age, Mary Galt, b. 12-12-1846; d. 7-28-1883.\n\nOf all democrats, Michael was the most democratic. He would go bail\n\nfor any of his townsmen who were in trouble, and anyone needing\n\n50\n\nTHE “SENSINEYS” OF AMERICA\n\nfinancial assistance would first think of “Mike.” But he wouldn’t\n\nstand for cheating at elections, and he wouldn’t go bail for any member\n\nof the Buzzard Gang. His eyesight was impaired when a boy, and this\n\nsomewhat restricted his activity as an active salesman, and it, also, in\n\na measure, contributed to his being rather untidy, though it must also\n\nbe understood that nobody walked about with creased trousers in the\n\nvillage of Goodville in those days. “Mike” used all the tobacco his\n\nbrothers didn’t use. He enjoyed fun and would help along in any\n\nscheme to liven up the town. He had a good level head and wore a\n\nJ 1 /} hat. I used to try on his silk hats when I was a boy, but my head\n\nwould go in down to the shoulders. He had quite a collection of\n\nthem, but I never saw him wear any. When he bought a big bill\n\nof goods in Philadelphia, the salesman would show him favor by buying\n\na silk hat for him.\n\nMichael was easy to approach and delighted in conversation. The\n\npeople enjoyed his unique personality, and from that standpoint he was\n\na good front-porch attraction. He never commented on anybody’s\n\npersonal appearance, and everybody felt at home in his presence.\n\nPerhaps, the reader will best understand Michael if we quote his\n\nfavorite sentiment—“0 why should the spirit of Mortals be proud.”\n\nHe wished everybody well.\n\nTo Michael and Mary Galt Sensenig there was born only one daughter—\n\nAnna Barbara Sensenig, b. 9-11-1877; d. 1-11-1912; m. William Stroman,\n\nwho is in the hardware business in Goodville, Pa. Issue:\n\na. Reta Mae Stroman, b. 5-2-1895; d. 7-3-1912;*\n\nb. Michael S. Stroman, b. 3-8-1896; d. 10-25-1918*;\n\nc. Pearl Stroman, b. 4-24-1897; d. 5-24-1919; m. Wayne Kern.\n\nThere was no son to continue the Sensenig name.\n\n(g) Martin M. Sensenig was one of the most widely known persons in the\n\neastern part of Lancaster County. He was a member of the Weaverland\n\nMennonite Church, and knew everybody belonging to it. His mother\n\nwas a Martin, and he was directly and indirectly related to a large\n\nnumber of the people in the Conestoga Valley. Not only was he known\n\nwidely but also favorably. Everybody wanted to talk with him, and he\n\ngenerally shook hands with most of the men at the church before he\n\nleft for home. One of my friends sent me a newspaper clipping telling\n\nof Martin’s funeral. He had kept this clipping for fifty years, because\n\nthe funeral was very unusual. By actual count 303 carriages were\n\nnumbered by the hostlers; and most of these in a cortege a mile long,\n\nfollowed the hearse to the Weaverland Cemetery. This indicates\n\nthe esteem in which he was held. The clipping says, “He was a\n\nthoroughly reliable business man; generous to a fault, pleasant and\n\nMARTIN M. SENSENIG\n\nas a young man\n\nMAGDALENA RUTT SENSENIG FAMILY GROUP IN 1899\n\nTHE GOODVILLE BRANCH\n\naffable to all; and, above all, scrupulously honest in all his dealings.\n\nThe community will greatly miss him.” Martin died at the age of\n\n49 years.\n\nWhen Martin M. Sensenig (1837-1887), the first of the boys in the\n\nMichael Sensenig family to get married, was given charge of the farm,\n\nthe rest of the family moved into the village of Goodville. Martin\n\ncould not have made a better choice than the young bride of nineteen\n\nfor his life partner.\n\nMagdalena Rutt Sensenig was an exceedingly capable farmer’s wife, who\n\nknew how to do things as easily on a large scale as others would do\n\nmuch less. Nothing went to waste, and with her Elias Howe sewing\n\nmachine, perhaps, the first one used in her neighborhood, she made\n\nall her children’s clothes. With the spring water at her disposal to keep\n\nmilk and cream constantly fresh, she produced butter of the best\n\nquality, and received several cents a pound more for it than quoted\n\nprices.\n\nThey made a success of farming during the twelve years they had\n\ncharge of the farm, and during that period seven children were born to\n\nthis union. We shall now introduce the reader to each member of the\n\nfamily from the oldest to the youngest, who were made orphans by the\n\nfather’s untimely death.\n\nMartin M. Sensenig (1837-1887) married Magdalena Rutt Sensenig\n\n1841-1917), daughter of Christian Sensenig, the miller, and this is their\n\nfamily:\n\na. Harry S. Sensenig, b. 9-17-1861; d. 4-18-1936;\n\nb.

Harry\n\nhad attended the State Normal School at West Chester and taught\n\nschool for several years, but inclined to business rather than teaching.\n\nThose who patronized the hardware store at Goodville fifty years ago\n\nwill remember Harry as a clerk who was always friendly.

Reentering\n\nthe Normal, he graduated with the Class of 1889. He was offered\n\na scholarship at Haverford College which he accepted and graduated\n\nin the Scientific Course with the Class of 1893.

He was invited to\n\nteach mathematics in the Friends School in Wilmington, and he was\n\noffered a fellowship in Gallaudet College for the Deaf, Washington,\n\nD. C., to learn how to teach the deaf. He decided to cast in his lot\n\nwith the deaf as one of their teachers, and graduated from the teachers\n\ntraining department in 1894, with the degree of M.A. He accepted\n\nthe position of Supervisor of Boys in the Advanced Department of\n\nthe Penna.
