        "text": "Recommended TBO for a Sensenich propeller is 2000 hours which can be found in Sensenich Service Bulletin R-17. The reason for overhauling a Sensenich fixed pitch propeller is to ensure the correct airfoil shape, blade angles and track of propeller. The static balance is also corrected during the overhaul. The dimensions of the blades are measured cord wise and also the thickness to be sure that they are still above the minimum requirements per manufacture specifications."
