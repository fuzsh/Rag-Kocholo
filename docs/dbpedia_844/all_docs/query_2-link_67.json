The activation energy were calculated based on Kissinger and Ozawa methods. Both reactions followed first order reactions. By Kissinger method, the activation energy and Ln A values for non-catalytic and catalytic EFB pyrolysis with alumina were 188.69 kJ mol-1 and 201.67 kJ/mol respectively. By Ozawa method, the activation energy values for non-catalytic and catalytic EFB pyrolysis with alumina were 189.13 kJ/mol and 201.44 kJ/mol respectively. The presence of catalyst increased the activation energy values for EFB pyrolysis as calculated by Kissinger and Ozawa methods.\n\nObituary: Henry Emil Kandrup, 1955-2003\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMerritt, David; Gottesman, Stephen T.\n\n2004-12-01\n\nHenry Emil Kandrup died on 18 October 2003 at his home in Gainesville Florida. Henry was a theoretical astrophysicist specializing in the application of chaotic dynamics to stellar systems. At the time of his death, Henry was a Professor at the University of Florida where he had taught for 13 years. Henry was born in Manhasset, New York on July 24, 1955 and spent most of his childhood in Great Neck. His parents, Jytte and Fred, were immigrants from Denmark where his father had worked as a silver smith. Henry was a precocious child, skipping both third and fifth grades. With the help of Sidney Spivack, a professor of sociology at Columbia University, his parents enrolled Henry in the Brooks Preparatory School in Andover, Massachusetts. After graduating at age 16, Henry enrolled at Cornell, transferring to Princeton the following year. Henry's parents adored their only child and worked hard to provide him with intellectual opportunities. Henry became an accomplished musician (organ, piano, French horn) and linguist (English, Danish, German) and was a passionate devotee of opera and ballet. Henry received his PhD in 1980 from the University of Chicago, where his thesis advisor was James Ipser. He taught at Oakland University in Michigan and Syracuse University in New York before coming to the University of Florida in 1990. Henry was sui generis. He shunned conventionality in his personal appearance and in his public demeanor, and always chose forthrightness and candor over polite silence. But to those of us who knew Henry well, his bluntness was a reflection of his intellectual consistency. Henry always said exactly what he thought, both in his published work and his public presentations, and never compromised himself for the sake of appearances. Nothing that he said or wrote was less than fully thought out. Henry's PhD thesis was entitled \"Stochastic Problems in Stellar Dynamics,\" and most of his subsequent research was in this field. Motion in stellar systems can be\n\nA PERSONAL, DEBATABLE AND TIMELY VIEW ON WORLD ORDER: HENRY KISSINGER â HENRY KISSINGER â WORLD ORDER, PENGUIN PRESS, NEW YORK, 2014 - Book review\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFLORIN BONCIU\n\n2014-11-01\n\nFull Text Available The concept of World Order had been much more present in the scientific debates and mass-media before 1990 when the world economy were more or less bipolar and the ideas of a dynamic balance of power and of spheres of influence were logically justified. After 1990 at the end of the Cold War a rather false perception became prevalent, particularly in the Western countries, projecting a unipolar world gradually witnessing a universalization of the Western style liberal democracy. This was epitomized in Francis Fukuyamaâs book âThe End of History and the Last Manâ.\n\nâNot a man from Englandâ: assimilating the exotic âotherâ through performance, from Henry IV to Henry VI\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nPenlington, A.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis essay will consider recent shifts in performance representations of England and the exotic âotherâ in Shakespeareâs Henry IV, Henry V and Henry VI plays. By tracing the textsâ varied representations of non-English Britons and those for whom English is not their mother tongue (such as Owen Glyndwr in 1 Henry IV and Princess Catherine in Henry V), recent criticism has identified that Shakespeareâs narrative portrays the challenges of assimilating âothernessâ within English culture.

In addition, R. capsulatus has the low-affinity permease PerO acting as a general oxyanion transporter, whose elimination increases tolerance to molybdate and tungstate. Although PerO-like permeases are widespread in bacteria, their function has not been examined in any other species to date. Here, we present evidence that PerO permeases from the alphaproteobacteria Agrobacterium tumefaciens , Dinoroseobacter shibae , Rhodobacter sphaeroides , and Sinorhizobium meliloti and the gammaproteobacterium Pseudomonas stutzeri functionally substitute for R. capsulatus PerO in sulfate uptake and sulfate-dependent growth, as shown by assimilation of radioactively labeled sulfate and heterologous complementation. Disruption of perO genes in A. tumefaciens , R. sphaeroides , and S. meliloti increased tolerance to tungstate and, in the case of R. sphaeroides , to molybdate, suggesting that heterometal oxyanions are common substrates of PerO permeases. This study supports the view that bacterial PerO permeases typically transport sulfate and related oxyanions and, hence, form a functionally conserved permease family. IMPORTANCE Despite the widespread distribution of PerO-like permeases in bacteria, our knowledge about PerO function until now was limited to one species, Rhodobacter capsulatus In this study, we showed that PerO proteins from diverse bacteria are functionally similar to the R. capsulatus prototype, suggesting that PerO permeases form a conserved family whose members transport sulfate and related oxyanions.

This essay attempts to sketch briefly the salient, know aspects of these two men and their divergent careers. It traces succinctly the subsequent fate of the unique anatomy book that has influenced and instructed almost every student of medicine.

VoxHenry shares many features with the popular inductance extractor, FastHenry. Just like FastHenry, VoxHenry solves a combination of the electric volume integral equation and the current continuity equation, but with three distinctions that make VoxHenry suitable and extremely efficient for analyzing voxelized geometries: 1) it leverages a carefully selected set of piecewise-constant and piecewise-linear basis functions; 2) it exploits FFTs to accelerate the matrix-vector multiplications during the iterative solution of system of equations; and 3) it employs a sparse preconditioner to ensure the rapid convergence of iterative solution. VoxHenry is capable of accurately computing frequency-dependent inductances and resistances of arbitrarily shaped and large-scale structures on a desktop computer. The accuracy, efficiency, and applicability of VoxHenry are demonstrated through inductance analysis of various structures, including square and circular coils as well as arrays of RF inductors (situated over ground planes).\n\nHenri PoincarÃ©: Death centenary (1854-1912)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHeinzmann, Gerhard; Villani, CÃ©dric\n\n2014-08-01\n\nThe year 2012 marked the centenary of the death of Henri PoincarÃ© (Nancy, 1854-Paris, 1912), and through the agency of the Henri-PoincarÃ© Institute in Paris, the Henri-PoincarÃ© Archives in Nancy and The London Mathematical Society, brought with it several exhibitions and meetings commemorating one of the greatest minds in contemporary times. Often referred to as the last polymath, PoincarÃ© embraced multiple branches of mathematics, theoretical physics and celestial mechanics, and made significant contributions to philosophy of science (Heinzmann & Stump, Henri PoincarÃ©, 2013). He wrote 25 textbooks and monographs, 500-plus articles, and was deeply involved in the organization and administration of science at both the national and international levels.1\n\nIraagi pÃ¤Ã¤stmiseks poliitikast ei piisa / Henry A.

Previous hypotheses have included diabetes, syphilis and hypothyroidism, among others. However, these inadequately explain Henry's failure to produce a male heir, despite multiple pairings. The latest postulated diagnoses for Henry are the coexistence of both Kell blood group antigenicity (possibly inherited from Jacquetta Woodville, Henry's maternal great grandmother) causing related impaired fertility, and McLeod syndrome, causing psychotic changes. As the mutated McLeod protein of the syndrome significantly reduces the expression, effectively inactivating the Kell antigen, we critically review this theory, examining in detail the pathophysiology of these conditions and assessing the genealogy of Henry VIII and its effect in subsequent generations.\n\nHENRY'S \"HAND OF GOD\"\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nÅ½eljko KaluÄeroviÄ\n\n2014-04-01\n\nFull Text Available In this paper the author discusses the views and statements of the French football player Thierry Henry he gave after his illegal play during the playoff match between France and the Republic of Ireland to claim one of the final spots in the World Cup 2010 in South Africa. First, by controlling the ball with his hand before passing it on for the goal Henry has shown disregard for the constitutive rules of football. Then, by stating that he is \"not a referee\" he demonstrated that for some players rules are not inherent to football and that they can be relativized, given that for them winning is the goal of the highest ontological status. Furthermore, he has rejected the rules of sportsmanship, thus expressing his opinion that the opponents are just obstacles which have to be removed in order to achieve your goals. Henry's action has disrupted major moral values, such as justice, honesty, responsibility and beneficence. The rules of fair play have totally been ignored both in Henry's action and in the Football Association of France's unwillingness to comment on whether a replay should take place. They have ignored one of the basic principles stated in the \"Declaration of the International Fair Play Committee\", according to which, fair play is much more than playing to the rules of the game; it's about the attitude of the sportsperson. It's about respecting your opponent and preserving his or her physical and psychological integrity.

These were expressed in two ways. First of all, scientific knowledge led to moral betterment. Thus the study of science was a morally good thing. This was not only because it led to the contemplation of God's creation, which was a standard reason justifying the study of science dating from the Scientific Revolution and even earlier. More importantly, the study of science itself was a moral discipline, imparting to scientists the habits and virtues of truthfulness, respect for others, care and diligence, and the discernment of meaningful patterns from experience. The moral ideals of science were expressed most strongly in Henry's upholding the international \"Republic of Science\"; conversely, cheapening science was a sign of moral failure. Second, for Henry and his generation, science provided a path to sure truth, separate from falsehood of both the politics and the quackery that characterized mid-century public life. Henry promoted this in his championing of the Smithsonian Institution a scientific establishment, against the ideas of others who wanted to make it a literary establishment or a training school for teachers. For Henry, the Smithsonian's scientific reputation would be established by relying on careful peer review in its publications, and supporting established scientists to write authoritative popular works. The purpose of both these activities was to raise the profile of science in the United States and further establish science and the scientific method as a guide to public life.\n\nVanglateenistuse enesekaitsekoolitus / Henri Palm\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nPalm, Henri\n\n2014-01-01\n\nVanglateenistus korraldab Tartus, Tallinnas ja JÃµhvis enesekaitsekoolitusi gÃ¼mnaasiumiÃµpilastele.

Thus he formed a deep understanding of nature. In 1845, Thoreau began a two-year and two-month residence at Walden Pond. His life was lonely but full of fragrance. He wanted to live meaningfully, confront the essential facts of life and live a simple life. Based on the review of the literature related to this topic, this paper aims to study Henry David Thoreauâs spiritual world, especially reflected in his famous book-Walden.\n\nEl Principio de Responsabilidades Comunes pero Diferenciadas\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCarlos Cerda DueÃ±as\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Este artÃ­culo analiza el progreso histÃ³rico del Principio de Responsabilidades Comunes pero Diferenciadas, sus orÃ­genes en el terreno del Derecho EconÃ³mico; su transiciÃ³n al Derecho Ambiental y los esfuerzos que los paÃ­ses en desarrollo realizan por su ingreso y consolidaciÃ³n al terreno jurÃ­dico de la cooperaciÃ³n internacional para el desarrollo.

After his older brother's and his father's death in 1547, he was anointed the French king in Reims. In 1533 already, as a 14-year-old boy, for reasons of state, he was married to the same aged Catherine de Medici (1519-1589), as her uncle was Pope Clement VII (1478-1534). The marriage remained childless for 11 years since Henry, due to a distinct hypospadia and a completely sexually inexperienced wife was unable to conceive children with her. His existing liaison to Diane de Poitiers (1499-1566) - a 19-year-older maid of honor of his father Francis I from 1537 until his death - influenced his sexual life immensely.The blame for the childless marriage was placed primarily on his wife, as Henry had become father of an illegitimate daughter with a mistress. Catherine then underwent all possible medical and alchemical procedures to finally give birth to the hoped Dauphin. Ironically, her rival for the favor of her husband, Diane de Poitiers was one of her greatest allies. She made clear that the cause lay with Henry and not with his wife. This was confirmed by the added solid physician Jean Fernel (1497-1558). His treatment of Henry and the simultaneous training of the unexperienced Catherine by Diane de Poitiers led to success.The result was the birth of Francis II (1544-1560) in 1544, the first of 10 children in 12 years. Thus, the dynasty was saved. After the death of Henry in a tragic tournament accident in 1559, three of his sons became kings of France. But the line of Valois remained without further descendants and was continued by Henry IV, the first Bourbon king in 1589.\n\nEl urbanismo contra lo urbano. La ciudad y la vida urbana en Henri Lefebvre\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nManuel Delgado Ruiz\n\n2018-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Henri Lefebvre coloca en el eje de su teorÃ­a sobre la vida urbana la oposiciÃ³n entre el espacio vivido por quienes lo usan o sueÃ±an y el espacio abstracto que creen organizar los tecnÃ³cratas de la ciudad, que raramente reconocen hasta quÃ© punto su âcreatividadâ estÃ¡ sometida a intereses privados o institucionales. Tras ese espacio hipotÃ©tico sobre el que urbanistas y arquitectos trabajan no hay otra cosa que mera ideologÃ­a, es decir, fantasma que recubre y disfraza las relaciones sociales reales de producciÃ³n. Frente -o de espaldas- a ese orden espacial meramente teÃ³rico de los âespecialistasâ, lo que las ciudades conocen es la actividad constante o inminente de lo urbano, entendido como apoteosis y exacerbaciÃ³n de lo social, dinamismo siempre activado de acontecimientos y quehaceres sobre el que los âexpertosâ aplican planes y proyectos, pero del que no saben en realidad nada, acaso por lo cual pugnan por anularlo.\n\nA revoluÃ§Ã£o russa e o sistema internacional The Russian Revolution and the international system\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRubens Ricupero\n\n2008-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Tomando-se como ponto de partida a anÃ¡lise de Henry Kissinger sobre o assunto, Ã© concebÃ­vel, embora raro na prÃ¡tica, distinguir a intensidade revolucionÃ¡ria interna de certo regime da maneira como ele se insere no sistema internacional, dependendo, Ã© claro, de sua maior ou menor tolerÃ¢ncia em relaÃ§Ã£o ao elemento revolucionÃ¡rio. Ã por isso que o exemplo dado por Kissinger de \"polÃ­tica exterior revolucionÃ¡ria\", isto Ã©, da que pÃµe em causa o sistema mesmo, Ã© o da Alemanha nazista, nÃ£o o da RÃºssia da RevoluÃ§Ã£o.

Vale a pena, assim, explorar os motivos histÃ³ricos da diferenÃ§a entre percepÃ§Ã£o e realidade.Out of Henry Kissinger's analysis about the subject, it is conceivable, though rare in practice, to distinguish the internal revolutionary intensity of a country's political rule from the way it finds a room in the international system - depending, of course, on the level of flexibility that the system itself affords to the revolutionary element. That is why Kissinger gives Nazi Germany as an instance of \"revolutionary external policy\", and not revolutionary Russia. That contradicts the perception of their own protagonists and heirs as well as the contemporary observers, and their successors, of the European parlamentary democracies and the United States - a view resilient enough to persist along all the Cold War era. So that it is worthwhile to explore the historical reasons of the break between perception and reality.\n\nHenri PoincarÃ© a biography through the daily papers\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nGinoux, Jean-Marc\n\n2014-01-01\n\nOn July 17, 2012, the centenary of Henri PoincarÃ©'s death was commemorated; his name being associated with so many fields of knowledge that he was considered as the Last Universalist. In Pure and Applied Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy, Engineering and Philosophy, his works have had a great impact all over the world. PoincarÃ© acquired in his lifetime such a reputation that, both nationally and internationally, his life and career were made the object of various articles in the daily papers not only in France, but also in the USA. Some of his philosophical concepts have even caused sharp controversies in the Press (as we will discover in this book).This work presents an original portrait of Henri PoincarÃ© based on various press cuttings from The New York Times, The San Francisco Sunday Call, The Times, The Sun, The Washington Post that chronicled unknown anecdotes of his life (for example, his first name was actually not Henri, but Henry; he obtained his high school diploma in sciences with a zero in mathem...\n\nStrategic Studies Quarterly.

A review in the Medical Times (1859) accused Gray of intellectual theft. The journal took the unusual step of substantiating its indictment by publishing twenty parallel texts from Gray and from a pre-existing textbook, Quain's Anatomy. At the recent \"Vesalius Continuum\" conference in Zakynthos, Greece (2014) Professor Brion Benninger disputed the theft by announcing from the floor the results of a computer analysis of both texts, which he reported exonerated Gray by revealing no evidence of plagiarism. The analysis has not been forthcoming, however, despite requests. Here the historian of Gray's Anatomy supplements the argument set out in the Medical Times 150 years ago with data suggesting unwelcome personality traits in Henry Gray, and demonstrating the utility of others' work to his professional advancement. Fair dealing in the world of anatomy and indeed the genuineness of the lustre of medical fame are important matters, but whether quantitative evidence has anything to add to the discussion concerning Gray's probity can be assessed only if Benninger makes public his computer analysis.

Breckenridge\n\n1992-12-01\n\nHenrys Lake, located in southeastern Idaho, is a large, shallow lake (6,600 acres, {approx} 17.1 feet maximum depth) located at 6,472 feet elevation in Fremont Co., Idaho at the headwaters of the Henrys Fork of the Snake River. The upper watershed is comprised of high mountains of the Targhee National Forest and the lakeshore is surrounded by extensive flats and wetlands, which are mostly privately owned. The lake has been dammed since 1922, and the upper 12 feet of the lake waters are allocated for downriver use. Henrys Lake is a naturally productive lake supporting a nationally recognized ''Blue Ribbon'' trout fishery. There is concern that increasing housing development and cattle grazing may accelerate eutrophication and result in winter and early spring fish kills. There has not been a recent thorough assessment of lake water quality. However, the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) is currently conducting a study of water quality on Henrys Lake and tributary streams. Septic systems and lawn runoff from housing developments on the north, west, and southwest shores could potentially contribute to the nutrient enrichment of the lake. Many houses are on steep hillsides where runoff from lawns, driveways, etc. drain into wetland flats along the lake or directly into the lake. In addition, seepage from septic systems (drainfields) drain directly into the wetlands enter groundwater areas that seep into the lake. Cattle grazing along the lake margin, riparian areas, and uplands is likely accelerating erosion and nutrient enrichment. Also, cattle grazing along riparian areas likely adds to nutrient enrichment of the lake through subsurface flow and direct runoff. Stream bank and lakeshore erosion may also accelerate eutrophication by increasing the sedimentation of the lake. Approximately nine streams feed the lake (see map), but flows are often severely reduced or completely eliminated due to irrigation diversion. In addition, subsurface\n\nThe Life of Henry Eyring\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\nHome; Journals; Resonance â Journal of Science Education; Volume 17; Issue 7.

E. Henry Symposium, The Importance of Magnetism in Physics and Material Science. The one-day symposium was conducted to recognize the achievements of Dr. Warren Elliot Henry as educator, scientist, and inventor in a career spanning almost 70 years. Dr. Henry, who is 88 years old, attended the symposium. Nobel Laureate, Dr. Glenn Seaborg, a friend and colleague for over 40 years, attended the event and shared his personal reminiscences. Dr. Seaborg is Associate Director-At-Large at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The Compendium begins with three papers which demonstrate the ongoing importance of magnetism in physics and material science. Other contributions cover the highlights of Dr. Henry`s career as a researcher, educator, and inventor. Colleagues and former students share insights on the impact of Dr. Henry`s research in the field of magnetism, low temperature physics, and solid state physics; his influence on students as an educator; and his character, intellect and ingenuity, and passion for learning and teaching. They share a glimpse of the environment and times that molded him as a man, and the circumstances under which he made his great achievements despite the many challenges he faced.\n\nPower and Stability: Promises and Perils of an Economically Strong China\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-05-21\n\nchild policy implemented in the 1970s under Mao and the Chinese bias toward male offspring which often results in sex - selective abortions . 311 Ibid...Japanese.58 The six major powers Henry Kissinger identified for the twenty-first century â the United States, Europe, China, Japan, Russia, and India ...taken are directed at them when they actually are not.

High supersaturations result only when the pH of the bulk droplet mixture exceeds the pKa of the species, in which pH range large pH differences among droplets of different sizes lead to large deviations from Henry's law for the bulk mixture. The deviation is shown to depend on the ratio of the arithmetic mean to the harmonic mean of the hydrogen ion concentrations of the droplets with the liquid water content used as weighting factor in the calculation of the means. The theory developed can explain observed discrepancies from Henry's law in atmospheric samples and also other observed phenomena like the reported increase of pH values of bulk aqueous samples during storage.\n\nWashington ja Moskva kriisi vÃ¤ltimise teel / Kissinger Henry A., George P.

This tale is a very strange text, a kind of anticipation of a meeting to come, in Italy, in 1880, between Woolson and Henry James, and a friendship which lasted until the formerâs death in 1894. For thirteen years, both writers would share a common inspiration. Death itself could not break the links between the two authors, who were connected even when settled in different European countries. William James, who was a member of the American Society for Psychical Research, probably helped his brother Henry to communicate â or so it appears â in some way with Woolson, even after her fatal accident, or possible suicide, in Venice. Henry James probably had in mind Miss Grief, a story by his dead friend, before writing some of his books. Indeed, Woolson had been the first to develop the image of âthe figure in the carpet,â which was later transformed by Henry James. Woolson was also the first to devise a plot which Henry James would later use as a canvas for his novel The Wings of the Dove. What is an author and what is authorship? It seems impossible to separate what is Woolsonâs and what is Henry Jamesâs in four works of fiction that are in fact to be read togetherÂ : Miss Grief, The Figure in the Carpet, The Beast in the Jungle, The Wings of the Dove.\n\nINOVATION AND ANTREPRENEURIAL CREATIVITY BUSINESS DURING HENRY FORD\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGHICAJANU MIHAELA\n\n2015-03-01\n\nFull Text Available In this paper I presented the innovation and entrepeneurial creativity as a basis in the process of business redesign.

Accused of being a pornographic text, the book Tropic of Cancer (1934 was forbidden in many countries. This article aims to analyze the obscene in Henry Millerâs work to prove that, beyond the erotic intention, Millerâs books are an expression of freedom and rejection of moral standards. In order to achieve our goal, we will use as theoretical basis the articles Criticismo e sexualidade: uma leitura de Tropico of Capricorn de Henry Miller, by FlÃ¡via AndrÃ©a Rodrigues Benfatt, and Literatura marginal americana: do Ã©pico confessional ao niilismo erÃ³tico, by Lainister de Oliveira. The texts mentioned above grant us the argumentation necessary to the analysis of pornographic discourse in Henry Millerâs literary works as the authorâs aesthetics choice of taking himself as a transgressor in a decadent society.\n\nKesknoored tegid visiidi Å veitsi / Henri Kaselo\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nKaselo, Henri\n\n2005-01-01\n\nKeskerakonna noorte esindus kÃ¼lastas 20.-25. aprillini 2005 Å veitsi, et osaleda sealsete noorte liberaalide Jungfreisinnige Schweizi kongressil.

Programmes that attract and retain high numbers of parents provide an enhanced opportunity to improve public health and are also likely to be more cost-effective than those that do not. We have developed a theory-informed optimisation intervention to promote parent engagement within an existing childhood obesity prevention group programme, HENRY (Health Exercise Nutrition for the Really Young). Here, we describe a proposal to evaluate the effectiveness of this optimisation intervention in regard to the engagement of parents and cost-effectiveness. The Optimising Family Engagement in HENRY (OFTEN) trial is a cluster randomised controlled trial being conducted across 24 local authorities (approximately 144 children's centres) which currently deliver HENRY programmes. The primary outcome will be parental enrolment and attendance at the HENRY programme, assessed using routinely collected process data. Cost-effectiveness will be presented in terms of primary outcomes using acceptability curves and through eliciting the willingness to pay for the optimisation from HENRY commissioners. Secondary outcomes include the longitudinal impact of the optimisation, parent-reported infant intake of fruits and vegetables (as a proxy to compliance) and other parent-reported family habits and lifestyle. This innovative trial will provide evidence on the implementation of a theory-informed optimisation intervention to promote parent engagement in HENRY, a community-based childhood obesity prevention programme. The findings will be generalisable to other interventions delivered to parents in other community-based environments. This research meets the expressed needs of commissioners, children's centres and parents to optimise the potential impact that HENRY has on obesity prevention.

The American writer subverted the prejudgement of the omniscient author in favour of the narration which is centred on the charactersâ point of view, thus modernising the novel before V. Woolf, Huxley, Thomas Mann, or in our case Camil Petrescu and G. CÄlinescu. Some bio-bibliographical information familiarises the reader with the life and work of this writer. The larger part of the article is dedicated to a case study of the novel with the metaphorical title: The Figure in the Carpet, where Henry James tries to illustrate in an artistic manner his conception regarding the profundity and ineffability of the literary creation. The conclusion which the author reaches, alternating the familiar plan of the relationship between a married couple with the esthetical plan, is that the relationship between writer and his work represents an act of fully intimacy, just like a ceremony that takes place in the wedding night\n\n78 FR 34428 - Missouri Central Railroad Company-Abandonment Exemption-in Cass, Henry, Johnson, and Pettis...\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2013-06-07\n\n...

Henry's law constant is a critical parameter to assess the fate and transport of reclaimed wastewater-borne NDMA in the soil profile. We conducted a laboratory experiment in which the change of NDMA concentration in water exposed to the atmosphere was measured with respect to time and, based on the data, obtained the dimensionless Henry's law constant (K(H)') of NDMA, at 1.0 x 10(-4). The K(H)' suggests that NDMA has a relatively high potential to volatilize in the field where NDMA-containing wastewater is used for irrigation and the volatilization loss may be a significant pathway of NDMA transport. The experiment was based on the two boundary-layer approach of mass transfer at the atmosphere-water interface. It is an expedient method to delineate K(H)' for volatile or semi-volatile compounds present in water at low concentrations.\n\nObituary: Henry Albers (1925-2009)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChromey, Fred\n\n2011-12-01\n\nHenry Albers, professor of astronomy at Vassar College for over thirty years, died March 29, 2009, in Fairhope, Alabama. For his work at Vassar, where he held the Maria Mitchell Chair, Albers received the first Maria Mitchell Women in Science Award for his inspiration of women astronomers. He said \"In the final analysis it is the students who bring the joy into teaching.\" As a professional astronomer, Albers did observational work on Galactic structure in the southern Milky Way, and on the structure of the Magellanic Clouds. In retirement, Albers published Maria Mitchell - A Life in Journals and Letters, the firsthand account of America's first woman astronomer. Albers's research was on photographic near-infrared spectroscopy of red giant stars in the southern Milky Way, some proper motion studies, and on the structure of the Magellanic Clouds. A series of seven NSF grants supported his six trips to Chile to make spectroscopic observations, as well as his sabbatical collaborations at Minnesota, Leiden, and the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh. Henry Albers arrived at Vassar in 1958, to find an astronomy program that had been recently absorbed by the physics department, and that was suffering neglect after the retirement of Maud Makemson. For the next 31 years, with incredible energy -- he sometimes taught seven courses a year -- he built the astronomy program into one double in size (from one to two tenure lines), whose th century facilities have been replaced with a st century observatory. For a remarkable stretch of 20-some-years, Albers and physicist Bob Stearns, with considerable grace, alternated chairmanship of the joint department of physics and astronomy. Henry Albers was a devoted citizen of Vassar College and an enthusiastic participant in the process of faculty governance at that institution. He would have been the first to concede that his enthusiasm was sometimes excessive, and that his contributions at faculty meetings occasionally failed to move the\n\nHenry's Constants of Persistent Organic Pollutants by a Group-Contribution Method Based on Scaled-Particle Theory.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRazdan, Neil K; Koshy, David M; Prausnitz, John M\n\n2017-11-07\n\nA group-contribution method based on scaled-particle theory was developed to predict Henry's constants for six families of persistent organic pollutants: polychlorinated benzenes, polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans, polychlorinated naphthalenes, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers. The group-contribution model uses limited experimental data to obtain group-interaction parameters for an easy-to-use method to predict Henry's constants for systems where reliable experimental data are scarce. By using group-interaction parameters obtained from data reduction, scaled-particle theory gives the partial molar Gibbs energy of dissolution, ÎgÌ 2 , allowing calculation of Henry's constant, H 2 , for more than 700 organic pollutants. The average deviation between predicted values of log H 2 and experiment is 4%. Application of an approximate van't Hoff equation gives the temperature dependence of Henry's constants for polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated naphthalenes, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers in the environmentally relevant range 0-40 Â°C.\n\nCorta, pero no mala: notas sobre literatura argentina\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAnÃ¡lia Gerbaudo\n\n2009-06-01\n\nFull Text Available âLa antologÃ­aâ es el tÃ­tulo de un poema que Susana ThÃ©non incluye en esa humorada mordaz que es Ova completa.

At the end of his life, Henry James suffered a vascular stroke in the right hemisphere and developed a striking identity delusion. He dictated in a perfectly clear and coherent manner two letters as if they were written by Napoleon Bonaparte. He also showed signs of reduplicative paramnesia. Negative symptoms resulting from right hemisphere damage may disrupt the feelings of \"warmth and intimacy and immediacy\" and the \"resemblance among the parts of a continuum of feelings (especially bodily feelings)\", which are the foundation of personal identity according to William James. On the other hand, a left hemisphere receiving inadequate input from the damaged right hemisphere may produce positive symptoms such as delusional, confabulatory narratives. Other fragments dictated during Henry James's final disease reveal some form of insight, if partial and disintegrated, into his condition. Thus, even when consciousness is impaired by brain damage, something of its deep nature may persist, as attested by the literary characteristics of the last fragments of the Master.\n\nLa Vie et L'oeuvre d'Henri Wallon.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAubrey, Carol\n\n1987-01-01\n\nOutlines the life and philosophy of noted French child psychologist, Henri Wallon (1879-1962).

The large, mature leaves contained 42% more total oxalate than in the small leaves and the soluble oxalate content of the large leaves was 33% higher than the smaller leaves. Cooking the mixed leaves, stems and buds in boiling water for two minutes significantly (p < 0.05 reduced the total oxalate when compared to the raw plant parts. Pesto sauce made from mixed leaves contained 257 mg total oxalate/100 g fresh weight; this was largely made up of insoluble oxalates (85% of the total oxalate content. Soup made from mixed leaves contained lower levels of total oxalates (44.26 Â± 0.49 mg total oxalate/100 g fresh weight and insoluble oxalate made up 49% of the oxalate contents. The levels of oxalates in the Good-King-Henry leaves were high, suggesting that the leaves should be consumed occasionally as a delicacy because of their unique taste rather than as a significant part of the diet. However, the products made from Good-King-Henry leaves indicated that larger amounts could be consumed as the oxalate levels were reduced by dilution and processing.\n\n2.

This argues for the history painter and writer Fuseli as an exemplary âNeopaganâ, a term coined by Pop to refer to the new sense of cultural pluralism and historical relativism which emerged in Europe after the discovery of the remains of Pompeii and Herculaneum in 1748. While this perspective offers a fresh view of the artist, relating him to the emergence of modernity, and illuminates some important aspects of his work, the reviewer also suggests that the monographic focus risks re-asserting a sense of Fuseliâs exceptionalism.\n\nHenry constants in polymer solutions with the van der Waals equation of state\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nBithas, Sotiris; Kalospiros, Nikolaos; Kontogeorgis, Georgios\n\n1996-01-01\n\nparameter is satisfactory, with typical errors within the experimental uncertainty and comparable to those with the more complex Perturbed Hard Chain Theory-based equations of state with the same number of adjustable parameters.

(Department of Chemical Engineering and Environmental Quality Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA (USA))\n\n1991-06-20\n\nIn this work we prove that mixing of droplets with different {ital p}H that are individually in Henry's law equilibrium with the surrounding atmosphere always results in a bulk mixture that is supersaturated with weak acids like S(IV) and HCOOH and bases like NH{sub 3} with respect to the original atmosphere. The degree of supersaturation of the bulk liquid water sample for a particular species depends on its dissociation constant, on the initial {ital p}H of the bulk droplet mixture, and on the distribution of the {ital p}H and of the liquid water over the droplet spectrum. High supersaturations result only when the {ital p}H of the bulk droplet mixture exceeds the {ital p}K{sub {ital a}} of the species, in which {ital p}H range large {ital p}H differences among droplets of different sizes lead to large deviations from Henry's law for the bulk mixture. The deviation is shown to depend on the ratio of the arithmetic mean to the harmonic mean of the hydrogen ion concentrations of the droplets with the liquid water content used was weighting factor in the calculation of the means. The theory developed can explain observed discrepancies from Henry's law in atmospheric samples and also other observed phenomena like the reported increase of {ital p}H values of bulk aqueous samples during storage. {copyright} American Geophysical Union 1991\n\nThe personality of Henry Cavendish a great scientist with extraordinary peculiarities\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nMcCormmach, Russell\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis book explores the 18th century natural philosopher Henry Cavendish, best known for his work in chemistry and physics.

Tobacco and alcohol taxes are put forward as the best way of reducing the social harms caused by the use and misuse of these substances. Junk foods have the same pattern of misuse and the same social costs as tobacco and alcohol. The Henry tax review rejects the idea of taxing fatty foods, and to date the government has not implemented a tax on junk food. We propose that a tax on junk food be implemented as a tool to reduce consumption and address the obesity epidemic.\n\nTeaching the âGrandsons of Balzacâ a Lesson: Henry James in the 1890âs\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDennis F.

There is much evidence, in Jamesâs own notebooks, that The Bostonians was influenced by Daudetâs LâÃvangeliste, The Princess Casamassima by Turgeneffâs Virgin Soil, and The Tragic Muse by the narrative techniques of Maupassant (NB 47, Powers 91, NB 92, and Powers effectively show...\n\nStaging Henry Fielding: The Author-Narrator in Tom Jones On Screen\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEli LÃ¸faldli\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFull Text Available As recent adaptation theory has shown, classic-novel adaptation typically sets issues connected to authorship and literal and figurative ownership into play. This key feature of such adaptations is also central to the screen versions of Henry Fieldingâs Tom Jones (1749. In much of Fieldingâs fiction, the narrator, typically understood as an embodiment of Fielding himself, is a particularly prominent presence. The author-narrator in Tom Jones is no exception: not only is his presence strongly felt throughout the novel, but through a variety of means, âThe History of Tom Jones, A Foundlingâ is also distinctly marked as being under his control and ownership. The two adaptations of Fieldingâs novel, a 1963 film and a 1997 television series, both retain the figure of the author-narrator, but differ greatly in their handling of this device and its consequent thematic ramifications. Although the 1963 film de-emphasises Henry Fieldingâs status as proprietor of the story, the author-narrator as represented in the filmâs voiceover commentary is a figure of authority and authorial control. In contrast, the 1997 adaptation emphasises Fieldingâs ownership of the narrative and even includes the author-narrator as a character in the series, but this ownership is undermined by the irreverent treatment to which he is consistently subjected. The representations of Henry Fielding in the form of the author-narrator in both adaptations are not only indicative of shifting conceptions of authorship, but also of the important interplay between authorship, ownership and adaptation more generally.\n\n[From apprenticeship to Nobel Prize: Henri Moissan's fabulous destiny].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLafont, O\n\n2008-01-01\n\nBorn in Paris on September 28, 1852, son of an eastern railways' employee and of a dressmaker, Henri Moissan's secondary schooling in Meaux did not allow him to get access to the sesame diploma \"baccalaurÃ©at\" (GCE). In 1869, he did obtain a special certificate of secondary schooling so that he could become an apprentice in watch making. That could have been the end of the story, but dreadful event for France appeared to have beneficial effects for Moissan. Under the threat of the Prussian army, Moissan's family took refuge near Paris. This gave the young Henri the opportunity to register as a student for the second-class pharmacy diploma, which did not need, at the time, the GCE. Moissan became then a trainee in pharmacy in 1871. Meanwhile, he followed the special schooling of \"Ecole de chimie\" founded by E. FrÃ©my, and then joined the laboratory of DehÃ©rain at the Museum, where he worked in plant physiology. He finally obtained the famous \"baccalaurÃ©at\" (GCE) and could register as a student in first-class pharmacy. He became a pharmacist as well as a doctor in sciences. In 1883, Moissan was named professor at the school of pharmacy in Paris. In 1886, he isolated fluorine by electrolysis of fluorhydric acid, in the presence of potassium fluoride, at a low temperature. He then studied diamond synthesis and gave a start to high temperature chemistry, designing his famous furnace. These findings and many others allowed Moissan to rise to membership in many learned academies around the world. Crowning achievement, Moissan won the Nobel Prize in 1906. A man of culture, collector of autographs and paintings, he died in 1907. Nothing of that would have been possible if there had not been a second-class pharmacist diploma. The history of Henri Moissan is one of a rise from apprenticeship to the Nobel Prize.\n\nThe last ride of Henry II of France: orbital injury and a king's demise.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nEftekhari, Kian; Choe, Christina H; Vagefi, M Reza; Eckstein, Lauren A\n\n2015-01-01\n\nJousting was a popular pastime for royalty in the Renaissance era. Injuries were common, and the eye was particularly at risk from the splinters of the wooden lance. On June 30, 1559, Henry II of France participated in a jousting tournament to celebrate two royal weddings. In the third match, Gabriel de Montgomery struck Henry on the right shoulder and the lance splintered, sending wooden shards into his face and right orbit. Despite being cared for by the prominent physicians Ambroise ParÃ© and Andreas Vesalius, the king died 10 days later and was found to have a cerebral abscess. The wound was not explored immediately after the injury; nevertheless, wooden foreign bodies were discovered in the orbit at the time of autopsy. The dura had not been violated, suggesting that an infection may have traveled from the orbit into the brain. Nostradamus and Luca Guarico, the astrologer to the Medici family, had prophesied the death of Henry II of France, but he ignored their warnings and thus changed the course of history in Renaissance Europe.
