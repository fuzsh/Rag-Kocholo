Together with several other men (Bucks County Scientific Society), he bought a P-51 Mustang. It was housed at the airport.\n\nIt was from this airport that my Mother & I flew to Los Angeles in a Republic SeaBee in the fall of 1946.\n\nA man had flown into the airport in his SeaBee & my Dad brought him home for dinner. Next thing I knew my Mom & I were off to LA. Quite a trip.\n\nThe only photo which has been located of Skyhaven Air Center was a 1947 aerial view.\n\nIt depicted the field as having 2 grass runways, with a few small hangars & 7 single-engine aircraft on the northeast side.\n\nThe only aeronautical chart depiction which has been located of Skyhaven Air Center\n\nwas on the 1950 NY Sectional Chart (courtesy of Mike Keefe).\n\nIt depicted Skyhaven as having a mere 1,800' unpaved runway.\n\nSkyhaven Air Center was evidently closed at some point between 1950-53,\n\nas a 1953 aerial photo showed railroad lines had been built through the center of the field.\n\nBut one hangar remained on the northeast side of the property.\n\nDiane Siesel Orr recalled, “Much was destroyed when the rail lines for US Steel went through the property in

Bircher III recalled that Boulevard Airport \"was closed during the war [WW2],\n\nand Dick & Granddad moved the cadet flight school to a farm Dick bought in Gettysburg.\"\n\nThe temporary wartime closure of the airport was apparently a result of wartime security concerns,\n\nas was the case at many other small civil airports along the coasts during the war.\n\nBoulevard Airport was not depicted at all on the 1943 NY Sectional Chart (courtesy of Chris Kennedy).\n\nIn 1943, Gerald Herrick received special permission from the government\n\nto experiment at the airport with his improved gyrocopter, the Herrick HV-3.\n\nThis model was a coaxial helicopter that did not come to fruition,\n\nas he had little success with increasing the stability of the plane.\n\nBoulevard Airport was not listed among active airfields in the 1945 AAF Airfield Directory (courtesy of Scott Murdock).\n\nBoulevard Airport reopened after WW2.\n\nDean Westover reported in 2003,\n\n\"I know that Boulevard Airport was open in August of 1946.\n\nI have purchased a 1946 Aeronca Chief.\n\nDuring a title search I found that it was delivered to Carl Norton of Boulevard Airport on 8/12/46.\"\n\nA 1946 USGS map depicted the outline of Boulevard Airfield,\n\nas well as several nearby airports: Budd Airfield, Somerton Airfield, and Northeast Philadelphia Airfield.\n\nThe 1947 Washington Sectional Chart described Boulevard Airport\n\nas having a 2,200' unpaved runway.\n\nDavid Leidel observed of Boulevard Airport, \"I know it was operational in 1947,\n\nas I have a photo of myself standing near George Villsmeyer's airplane when I was 2 years old.\"\n\nA 1948 aerial view of Boulevard Airport showed a checkerboard-painted hangar on the eastern corner, 6 individual T-hangars on the northeast,\n\nand 6 light aircraft on the southeast side.\n\nThe airport circle marking was in the center of the field.\n\nIn 1949, Gerard Herrick proposed a convertiplane with rotor-mounted ramjets,\n\nbut this proposal also did not attract any investors.\n\nA 1950 aerial view of Boulevard Airport did not show any aircraft parked on the field (but it did show a single light aircraft flying low over the field).\n\nThe airport circle marking had been removed at some point between 1948-50,\n\nbut the field & hangars otherwise remained intact.\n\nThe 1950 USGS map depicted Boulevard Airport as an irregularly-shaped property with several buildings along the east side.\n\nIt also depicted Somerton Airport in close proximity.\n\nThe last depiction of Boulevard Airport as an active airport which has been located\n\nwas on the 1951 Washington Sectional Chart (courtesy of Mike Keefe),\n\nwhich described the field as having a 2,200' unpaved runway.\n\nBoulevard Airport was once again the site of vertical flight research & development work\n\nby yet another innovative small company.\n\nThe Helicopter Engineering Research Corporation conducted test flights at Boulevard Airport starting in 1951.\n\nThey produced the Jovair 4E Sedan & the Jovanovich JOV-3.\n\nThe company principals (including President D.K. Jovanovich)\n\nwere formerly with the Piasecki Company (another Philadelphia-area company which pioneered vertical flight).\n\nBoulevard Airport was closed on 10/4/51 (according to John Bircher).\n\nAn article in that night's issue of the Evening Standard newspaper (courtesy of John Bircher)\n\nwas entitled \"Auction at City's 1st Airport Clears Way for Housing\".\n\nThe article read, \"The buildings & equipment of Boulevard Airport, Philadelphia's first,\n\nwere auctioned off yesterday to make way for a housing development\n\non the site at Roosevelt Boulevard & Red Lion Road.\n\nMore than 100 bidders paid a total of $14,200 for the several hundred items in the sale.\n\nThe biggest price, $7,000, was paid for the 70' x 90' main hangar,\n\nwhich had originally been set up at what is now International Airport.\n\nIssac Schlossbach of the Asbury Park Air Terminal paid $1,560 for 6 individual airplane hangars.\"\n\nBoulevard Airport was no longer depicted at all on the July 1952 NY Sectional Chart (courtesy of Mike Keefe).\n\nA 1953 aerial view showed that houses had been constructed along the northern portion of the Boulevard Airport site.\n\nThe 6 individual T-hangars had been removed at some point between 1950-53,\n\nbut the checkerboard-painted hangar remained standing.\n\nThe Helicopter Engineering Research Corporation was eventually acquired by McCulloch Motors Company in 1957.\n\nA 1958 aerial photo showed that more houses had begun to cover the western half of the former airport property.\n\nThe checkerboard-pained hangar had been demolished at some point between 1953-58,\n\nbut its foundation was still evident on the eastern side of the site.\n\nThomas Delahanty recalled of Boulevard Airport, “I live in the housing development that was built at the airfield location.\n\nI was born there in 1961 & moved back into the house that was built in 1958 after my parents left me the house in their will.\n\nI remember playing 'army men' in the field amongst the old foundation of the demolished hangar\n\nand even remember the remains of an old plane which sat on its belly next to it.\n\nThis was the 1960s & the old airfield was my whole world! Like a giant playground.\n\nIt was a different world back then & stay-at-home moms would let us kids run free all day in the summer time back there.\n\nMy oldest brother remembered the airport as well.\n\nHe used to fly model airplanes back there in the early 1960s.”\n\nAerial photos from 1965 & 1967 showed the field in much the same condition as 1958,\n\nwith houses covering the western half of the airport site,\n\nand the hangar foundation remaining on the eastern corner.\n\nBy the time of an August 7, 1971 aerial photo,\n\nthe site of Boulevard Airport had been covered with a shopping center & a residential development,\n\nand not a trace appeared to remain of the former airport.\n\nA 4/12/10 aerial view no longer depicted any trace of the former Boulevard Airport.\n\nThe site of Boulevard Airport is located on the west corner\n\nof the intersection of Roosevelt Boulevard & Red Lion Road.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nBudd Factory Airfield, Philadelphia, PA\n\n40.11, -75.04 (Northwest of Northeast Philadelphia Airport, PA)\n\nAn October 8, 1942 aerial view which appears to show the Budd Red Lion Factory while under construction,\n\nwith a single northeast/southwest runway also under construction.\n\nThe Edward G. Budd Manufacturing Company was a major manufacturer of railroad cars.\n\nThe Budd Company decided to apply their manufacturing experience\n\nwith stainless steel to the manufacturing of aircraft.\n\nTheir initial entry into the world of aeronautics was made in 1930\n\nthrough the contract manufacture of aircraft wheels & stainless steel wing ribs.\n\nThe 1st complete aircraft designed & built by Budd was the BB-1 Pioneer amphibian,\n\na single example of which (NR749N) was built in 1931.\n\nThe Pioneer was powered by a single 210hp Kinner C-5 motor,\n\nand used design concepts from the Savoia-Marchetti S-31.\n\nBudd's stainless steel construction aircraft construction process was patented (US patent #2,425,498 in 1942).\n\nIndeed this was the world's 1st stainless steel aircraft, truly making it a \"Pioneer\".\n\nThe earliest depiction which has been located of the Budd Factory Airfield was an October 8, 1942 aerial view,\n\nwhich appeared to show the Budd Red Lion Factory while under construction,\n\nwith a single northeast/southwest runway also under construction to the north of the factory.\n\nAnother runway was eventually added, oriented Northwest/Southeast.\n\nThe Budd Airfield was not yet depicted on the 1943 NY Sectional Chart (courtesy of Chris Kennedy).\n\nThe Budd Factory Airfield was opened in 1943, according to ExplorePaHistory.com.\n\nThe Budd RB-1 Conestoga, manufactured in the Philadelphia plant.\n\nDuring WW2, Budd again saw an opportunity to apply its stainless steel construction experience to aircraft once again,\n\nand the result was the Budd RB-1 Conestoga cargo aircraft,\n\nthe 1st mass-produced aircraft constructed primarily of stainless steel.\n\nThe Conestoga was also significant in that it was the 1st modern military cargo aircraft\n\nto adopt a configuration which has become the standard in post-WW2 military cargo aircraft,\n\nwith a high wing, and a rear ramp facilitating easy loading of cargo.\n\nThis is the exact configuration still used by almost all post-WW2 military cargo aircraft (C-123, C-130, C-17, etc.).\n\nThe 1st flight of the RB-1 Conestoga was in 1943, piloted by Guy Miller.\n\nInitially 3 prototypes of the Conestoga were built.\n\nDavid Leidel recalled, \"My father was a Flight Test Engineer on the RB-1 at Budd Field\n\nduring the latter stages of WW2.\n\nThey had a lot of problems with the Budd ship & his flight log tells quite a tale.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the Conestoga was not a success, due to undesirable handling qualities.\n\nA total of 17 examples of the RB-1 were produced by Budd for the Navy,\n\nthe last of which was delivered in March of 1944,\n\nand a further contract for 180 examples was canceled.\n\nBudd's facility had the WW2 USAAF code of “BU”.\n\nThe earliest aeronautical chart depiction of the Budd airfield which has been located\n\nwas on the 1944 Washington Sectional Chart (courtesy of Mike Keefe),\n\nwhich depicted \"Budd\" as a commercial airfield.\n\nAn undated (circa 1940s?) aerial view looking east at the Budd Red Lion Factory, with one runway visible behind the factory.\n\nThe Budd Factory Airfield, as depicted on the 1945 Washington Sectional Chart (courtesy of John Voss).\n\nA January 29, 1945 view of a Budd RB-1 Conestoga at Budd Field.\n\nPosing with the RB-1 were Sally Siebert from the Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVE)\n\nand Winifred Thompson from the Women’s Army Corps (WAC).\n\nA total of 14 war-surplus Budd RB-1s eventually became the starting point of Robert Prescott's Flying Tiger Airlines in 1945.\n\nThe 1945 AAF Airfield Directory (courtesy of Scott Murdock) described Budd Field\n\nas a 565 acre irregularly-shaped property within which were two 4,400' asphalt runways, oriented east/west & NNW/SSE.\n\nThe field was said to have a single concrete 126' x 37' hangar.\n\nBudd Field was described as being owned by the Defense Plant Corporation, but not currently in operation.\n\nA 1946 USGS map depicted the outline of Budd Airfield,\n\nas well as several nearby airports: Somerton Airfield, Boulevard Airfield, and Northeast Philadelphia Airfield.\n\nAfter WW2, Budd abandoned the manufacturing of aircraft,\n\nand the plant was once again retooled to produce automobile frames & railroad cars (not exactly the smartest move!).\n\nThe Budd Airfield was depicted as having a 4,400' hard-surface runway\n\non the 1947 Washington Sectional Chart (courtesy of Tom Beamer).\n\nA 1948 aerial view depicted the Budd Airfield as completely intact.\n\nRunways 9/27 & 16/34 were marked as active,\n\nand “Budd, Tower 317 K.C.” was painted in large letters on the runway intersection.\n\nThere were no aircraft visible on the field.\n\nThe Budd Airfield was still depicted as an active airfield on the 1949 NY Sectional Chart (according to Chris Kennedy).\n\nHowever, it was apparently closed within the next year,\n\nas it was no longer depicted at all on the January 1950 NY Sectional Chart (courtesy of Mike Keefe).\n\nThe 1950 USGS topo map depicted 2 unpaved runways, labeled as “Airport (Abandoned)”.\n\nThe last photo which has been located showed the Budd Airfield remaining completely intact was a 3/17/50 USGS aerial view.\n\nIt showed that closed-runway “X” markings had been added to each runway end at some point between 1948-50,\n\nbut the “Budd, Tower 317 K.C.” was still perceptible (but faded) on the runway intersection.\n\nA 1953 aerial view showed that the western & southern halves of the runways were being used to store unidentified objects.\n\nA road had been cut over the southeastern portion of Runway 34 at some point between 1950-53.\n\nA 1958 aerial photo depicted the Budd Factory Airfield while it was still mostly intact,\n\nwith the majority of the length of both paved runways still intact.\n\nAn circa 1950s photo of the Budd BB-1 Pioneer, as it sat mounted on a pylon outside the Franklin Institute (courtesy of Tom Beamer).\n\nSadly, according to Tom Beamer, the sole example of the Budd Pioneer sat outside on a mounting\n\nin front of Philadelphia's Franklin Institute for a long time.\n\nThis eventually led to the loss of the Pioneer's lower wing & empennage fabric, deteriorated by time & weather.\n\n\"By the time I saw it in the 1970s both wings were bare.\"\n\nBy the 1960s the former Budd airfield was used to store railcar frames.\n\nA 1965 aerial view showed that residential construction had begun on the northeastern end of Runway 27.\n\nA 1967 aerial view showed that houses covered the northeastern portion of the airfield site.\n\nThe runways at the Budd plant were not depicted at all on the 1969 USGS topo map.\n\nAn August 7, 1971 aerial photo showed that most of the length of the 2 paved runways of the former Budd Factory Airfield still remained intact,\n\nwith the factory & numerous other industrial buildings remaining on the southern side of the property.\n\nResidential construction had started to cover a middle portion of the former northwest/southeast runway.\n\nIn the 1980s the plant was sold to TransitAmerica Corporation in an attempt to reverse its declining fortunes.\n\nThat attempt was unsuccessful.\n\nIn April 1988, the last rail car rolled out of the Budd Red Lion plant,\n\naccording to “Living in the Past”, an article by Harry Silcox in the 10/9/08 issue of the Northeast Times.\n\nOn the following Friday, the last labor contract covering the workers expired.\n\nThe plant soon closed.\n\nThe facility sat vacant for several years, as attempts to sell it again met with no takers.\n\nThe runways at the Budd plant were not depicted at all on the 1983 or 1988 USGS topo maps.\n\nIn the 1992 USGS aerial view, the factory was still standing,\n\nand most of the East-Northeast/West-Southwest runway was still discernible,\n\nas was the southern half of the Northwest/Southeast runway.\n\nSeveral more recent buildings had been built at some point over the northern half of that runway.\n\nTransitAmerica eventually razed the factory in 1999,\n\nand a golf course was constructed on the site.\n\nA 4/12/10 aerial view of the site of Budd Factory Airfield, after the factory had been removed.\n\nNot a trace remains of the former airplane factory or its airfield.\n\nThe Budd Company factory was located north of the intersection of Red Lion Road & Sandmeyer Lane,\n\njust 2 miles northeast from Northeast Philadelphia Airport,\n\ndirectly along the extended centerline of PNE's Runway 33.\n\nThanks to Jay Cooke for pointing out this field.\n\n...............................................................................................................\n\nA 2002 photo by AirNikon of the sole remaining example of

along the Delaware River\n\nhas gone through a confusing series of owners & corporate names.\n\nThomas Huff & Elliot Daland formed the Huff Daland Aero Corporation in 1925 in Bristol PA.\n\nHuff Daland produced a series of biplanes as trainers, observation planes, and light bombers,\n\nfor the Army & Navy.\n\nIn 1927, the Huff Daland Aero Corporation was taken over by Hayden, Stone & Co, an NYC brokerage firm,\n\nand in the same year in the course of a merger, it became the Huff-Daland Division of the Keystone Corporation.\n\nSome of the Huff-Daland designs were floatplanes,\n\nand thus could be operated from the Delaware River adjacent to the Bristol factory.\n\nHowever, many of their designs were landplanes.\n\nAn airfield for landplanes (known at various times as Keystone / Kaiser / 3M Airport)\n\nwas eventually constructed just one mile north of the Bristol plant.\n\nWithin 1927, the Huff-Daland Division of the Keystone Corporation\n\nwas known as the Keystone Aircraft Corporation.\n\nAn undated photo of the Keystone XB-1B, produced in 1927.\n\nIn 1927, a single example of the Huff-Daland XB-1 bomber became the Keystone XB-1B,\n\nafter its original Packard 2A-1530 engines were replaced with Curtiss V-1570-5 \"Conqueror\" engines.\n\nThe improved -B aircraft had better performance than the original,\n\nbut still didn't compare favorably to other aircraft of the period & never entered production.\n\nKeystone merged with the Loening Company of NY in 1928.\n\nAccording to Tom Beamer, the Fleetwings Corporation was organized in 1929,\n\nand soon thereafter became a tenant of Keystone at the Bristol plant.\n\nThe \"Keystone Aircraft Field\" & Keystone Seaplane Base, as depicted on the Philly Chamber of Commerce's\n\n1930 \"Aviation Map of the

While at fleetwings I worked in sheet metal departments, finally building wings for the Grumman Avenger.\n\nOnly a couple names come to my mind now, Bill Engle & John Scheppe. Bill was the pilot for the Seabird.\n\nIt would go down the ramp from the hangar into the Delaware River, take off, fly & return & backup the ramp to the hangar.”\n\nAn undated (circa 1930s-40s) photo looking south at the Fleetwings seaplane hangar & aircraft factory.\n\nThe Fleetwings Seaplane Base, as depicted on the 1940 Washington Sectional Chart (courtesy of Mike Keefe).\n\nFleetwings built a new factory in 1941 on Green Lane at the Keystone / Kaiser / 3M Airport,\n\nand all aircraft assembly was performed at the new factory at the airport from that point on.\n\nHowever, this was not the end of their use of the Bristol factory,\n\nas Fleetwings also performed quite a bit of aircraft component manufacturing under sub-contract during WW2,\n\nincluding work for Curtiss-Wright, Republic, Martin, Vought, Brewster, Grumman and others.\n\nThey advertised sub-contracting with their large line of hydraulic metal forming equipment,\n\nwhich most likely remained at the Bristol location (not relocated to the new factory built at the airfield 1941).\n\nAccording to Tom Beamer, the Fleetwings Corporation was purchased by Kaiser in 1943,\n\nbecoming the \"Fleetwings Division of Kaiser Cargo Inc.\".\n\nThe last chart depiction of the Fleetwings Seaplane Base that has been located\n\nwas on the 1945 NY Sectional Chart (courtesy of Norman Freed).\n\nThe Fleetwings Seaplane Base was evidently closed at some point between 1945-50,\n\nas it was no longer depicted on the 1950 NY Sectional Chart (courtesy of Mike Keefe).\n\nAn August 7, 1971 aerial view of the former Fleetwings factory & seaplane base.\n\nIn addition to the 1920s/30s-era factory on the east side of the road,\n\na newer set of buildings had been added at some point between 1937-71.\n\nAs seen in this circa 2001 aerial photo,\n\nthe original 1920s/30s-era factory on the east side of the road had been removed,\n\nalong with the hangar & seaplane ramp formerly located at the north end of the complex has been removed.\n\nHowever, the newer factory buildings on the west side of the complex still remained standing.\n\nA January 2009 aerial view by Paul Freeman looking north at the former Fleetwings factory.\n\nThe site of the Keystone / Fleetwings factory is located along the Delaware River,\n\nsouthwest of the intersection of Radcliffe Street & Green Lane.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nKeystone Aircraft Field / Fleetwings Field / Kaiser Field / Kaiser NAS / 3M Airport, Levittown, PA\n\n40.13, -74.85 (Northeast of Philadelphia, PA)\n\nThe \"Keystone Aircraft Field\" & Keystone Seaplane Base, as depicted on the Philly Chamber of Commerce's\n\n1930 \"Aviation Map of the Philadelphia Metro District\" (courtesy of Tom Beamer).\n\nHow many residents of present-day Philadelphia\n\nare aware that this obscure little airport (which is no longer is in operation)\n\nwas the birthplace of quite a few unusual aircraft?\n\nThis airfield was evidently originally built to support the flight testing\n\nof aircraft produced by the Keystone Aircraft factory,\n\nlocated one mile to the south along the Delaware River in Bristol, PA.\n\nThe date of construction of this airfield has not been determined.\n\nThe earliest reference to an airfield at this location came from Nathan Sturman,\n\nwho observed, “The ill-fated transatlantic fliers of the U.S. Navy, Wooster & Davis,\n\nsupervised the building of their converted Keystone Pathfinder 'American Legion' at the plant in Bristol [in 1927],\n\nthen test-flew it & departed for Langley Field right on the Green Lane Airfield, later to be called 3M [Airport].”\n\nThe earliest depiction of the airfield which has been located\n\nwas on the Philly Chamber of Commerce's 1930 \"Aviation Map of the Philadelphia Metro District\" (courtesy of Tom Beamer).\n\nIt depicted the \"Keystone Aircraft Field\" as a north/south field running along the east side of Green Lane.\n\nThe airfield layout of the \"Keystone Aircraft Field\",\n\nfrom the 1930 book \"Philadelphia Aeronautical Center of the East\"\n\n(courtesy of the George H.

Excellent job, in great shape right until the end.”\n\nA circa 1943-45 photo of a Fleetwings XBQ-1 Model 37, twin engine plywood target plane,\n\na \"confidential Army project\" (courtesy of Tom Beamer).\n\nA single example was built in 1943 of the Fleetwings XBQ-1 (Model 37).\n\nA predecessor of today's cruise missiles, the Model 37 was a guided missile, with a provision for a pilot.\n\nThe XBQ-1 had two 225hp inline engines & fixed tricycle landing gear.\n\nA single example was also produced of the improved XBQ-2A,\n\nwhich had two 280hp radial engines, jettisonable landing gear, and a 2,000 pound bomb load.\n\nAccording to Tom Beamer, the Fleetwings Corporation was purchased by Kaiser in 1943,\n\nbecoming the \"Fleetwings Division of Kaiser Cargo Inc.\".\n\nA circa 1941-45 photo of a Fleetwings \"Twirleybird\" helicopter, pictured with floats (courtesy of Tom Beamer).\n\nFleetwings even tried their hand at rotary wing aircraft,\n\nbuilding & flying a single example (NX41804) of the Fleetwings Twirleybird.\n\nAccording to Tom Beamer, \"The Fleetwings helicopter was designed by the engineering staff of The Franklin Institute\n\nat Henry J. Kaiser's instigation to provide anti-sub protection from cargo ships.\n\nIt was flight tested in 1945; the project ended shortly after WW2.\"\n\nKaiser's last aircraft was the Navy XBK dive bomber, which was initiated in February 1944 with a contract for 2 prototypes.\n\nA mockup inspection without engine was ready in April 1944.\n\nThe engine was installed in May 1944 & the completion of the first prototype was scheduled for November 1944.\n\nTo speed up later production the U.S. Navy even constructed a new airfield at the Fleetwing plant.\n\nIn early 1945 BuAer requested that the plane would be able to carry a torpedo.\n\nThe weapon was fitted to a new centreline station & the designation was changed to BTK.\n\nThe first XBTK-1 was finally completed in March 1945, making its first flight in May.\n\nA circa 1945-46 photo of a Kaiser-Fleetwings XBTK-1 (courtesy of Tom Beamer).\n\n\"Kaiser\" Airport, as depicted on the 1945 NY Sectional Chart (courtesy of Norman Freed).\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War the U.S. Navy cut BTK-1 orders to 10 planes.\n\nThe prototype was transported back to Fleetwings where redesign began.\n\nThe second production aircraft first flew in March 1946\n\nand featured built-in leading edge slots which greatly increased the stall performance of the aircraft.\n\nThe last photo which has been located of a Kaiser-Fleetwings aircraft at their facility was a 1946 U.S. Navy photo\n\nof the 2nd prototype Kaiser-Fleetwings XBTK-1 (BuNo 44314) at the Kaiser-Fleetwings factory airfield in Bristol.\n\nNote the leading edge slots, an improvement compared to the original prototype.\n\nBy early 1946 procurement of new planes was drastically cut down\n\nand the BTK found its role already filled by the Douglas AD Skyraider & Martin AM Mauler.\n\nIn May 1946 it was decided to delay corrections of the design & complete 5 airframes already in production.\n\nAlthough a promising design, the U.S. Navy finally terminated the contract on 3 September 1946,\n\nas there was no need for the aircraft anymore, and the 5 prototypes were scrapped.\n\nThus came to an end this unheralded aircraft manufacturer.\n\nThe field was labeled as “Kaiser NAS” on the 1947 USGS topo map,\n\nwhich certainly is a strange designation, as this field never operated as a Naval Air Station.\n\nThe airfield was still depicted as \"Kaiser\" on the 1949 New York Sectional Chart (according to Chris Kennedy).\n\nThe 3M Company purchased the airfield & the newest Green Lane factory in the 1950s,\n\nand thus the field was renamed 3M Airport.\n\nAccording to Lynn Gentzsch, “When 3M bought the factory, they closed the one runway that led to the factory.\n\nIf a plane had gone off the end into that factory, there would have been a very large boom!\n\nI remember, when landing, seeing all the X's on that runway, the turnpike bridge & the red balls on the high-tension wires.”\n\nIn the 1950s, 3M leased the airport to Engle Air Service.\n\nAccording to Tom Beamer, Engle had been the head of flight test for the Fleetwings company.\n\nA 1953 aerial view depicted 3M Airport as having 3 paved runways, with a total of 17 light aircraft parked around the south end of Runway 1.\n\nThe former Fleetwings Aircraft factory was visible on the southwest side,\n\nbut with no aircraft around it.\n\nA 1956 aerial view depicted 3M Airport as having 3 paved runways, with a total of 22 light aircraft parked around the south end of Runway 1.\n\nThe former Fleetwings Aircraft factory was visible on the southwest side.\n\nThe 1957 PA Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of Mike Keefe)\n\ndescribed Three-M Airport as having 2 bituminous runways: a 3,800' north/south strip & a 3,600' east/west strip.\n\nThe operator was listed as Engle Flying Service,\n\nand the manager was listed as Harold Hayden.\n\nA circa 1957-58 photo of a HPK SP-1 at 3M Airport (courtesy of Tom Beamer).\n\nA circa 1957-58 plan of the HPK SP-1, built at 3M Airport (courtesy of Tom Beamer).\n\nAccording to Tom Beamer, HPK Aircraft built the SP-1 (\"Some Pisser-1\")\n\nat 3M Airport with an eye to the light counter-insurgency market.\n\nHPK Aircraft Associates consisted of Harold Hayden, Art Payne, and Robert Kinney of the Engle Flying Service.\n\nA single example of the SP-1 (aka Engle HPK) was built in 1957.\n\nThe SP-1 was a single-seater, powered by a 115hp Lycoming O-235C,\n\nand it won a reward for outstanding workmanship in 1958.\n\nUnfortunately, flying operations at 3M became more difficult when the nearby PA Turnpike was completed in the 1950s\n\nas the raised bridge approach made take off & landing hazardous on the main runway.\n\nA 1958 aerial view depicted a total of 17 light aircraft parked around the south end of Runway 1.\n\nThe 1959 Philadelphia Local Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of Chris Kennedy)\n\ndescribed 3M Airport as having a 3,800' hard-surface runway.\n\nThe Kaiser-Fleetwings Company still reportedly existed as late as 1960,\n\nwhen it manufactured the launch canister for the Echo 1 balloon satellite at its Bristol factory.\n\nThe 1960 Jeppesen Airway Manual (courtesy of Chris Kennedy)\n\ndepicted 3M Airport as having 2 paved runways (3,800' Runway 1/19 & 3,600' Runway 11/29),\n\nas well as an abandoned northeast/southwest runway.\n\nA helicopter landing area was located on the southeast side of the field,\n\nand a ramp with 3 buildings was located on the west side.\n\nBill Stewart recalled of 3M Airport, “I was based there from 1962-69,\n\nwhen it was managed by Engle Flying Service - Harold Hayden & Don Carlson.\n\nReno Benner was chief mechanic & his son-in-law Dave Levin & Jim McGinley were instructors.”\n\nA circa mid-1963 photo of a Cessna 172 at 3M Airport modified with a Unitwin twin-engine installation (courtesy of Tom Beamer).\n\nAccording to Bill Stewart, “The strange modification of the Cessna 172 was owned & funded by Unitwin Corp,\n\na group formed by Dick Young - former WACO & Fleet Canada chief engineer.\n\nI ferried the unmodified Cessna, N7257A, from Garden Spot (Lancaster PA) to Princeton Airport for Dick.\n\nThe 172 hadn't been flown for a year or so & the only working instrument was the oil pressure gage.\n\nThe purpose of the program was to evaluate one approach to providing multi-engine centerline thrust.\n\nThe key element was Dick's Integrating Gearbox, which took 2 engine inputs into a single output (propeller).\n\nWith both engines carrying the load, output & input RPM was the same.\n\nAs power from one engine decreased and the RPM of the input shafts began to differ,\n\nthe gear reduction (an ingenious planetary setup) came into play & the output RPM dropped to permit the remaining engine to maintain RPM.\n\nLoss of an engine required no pilot action other than full throttle on the remaining engine.\n\nThe fixed pitch prop (low cost) simply slowed to not overload the survivor.”\n\nBill continued, “Kinney Tutner Associates (General Techniques Inc) based at Mercer County Airport was responsible for the design\n\nand I, a young aero engineer, then working for a Princeton aerospace think-tank, moonlighted to do the nuts & bolts design.\n\nIt was intended to power the ship with 2 Continental C-85 engines, turning a Sensenich 108-inch reverse-rotation wooden propeller.\n\nI offset the raised thrust line 4 inches to the right to compensate for the increased propeller moments.\n\nThe gearbox was late in coming so the first flights were conducted with a single C-85,\n\nyet the slow turning 9-foot prop provided excellent takeoff & climb performance.\n\nDick flew the first flights by himself, then along with me and finally, I got some flight time.\n\nThe customer pulled the plug despite the excellent preliminary results.\n\nCustomer was rumored to have been Cessna, and at that time they had decided to produce the centerline thrust 336.\n\nThe 172 was returned to stock configuration & sold.”\n\nA closeup from a 1963 aerial view,\n\nshowing 3M Airport at perhaps its zenith of popularity, with over 29 aircraft parked around the south end of Runway 1,\n\nincluding a Douglas DC-3.\n\n3M Airport was described on the Aerodromes table on the 1965 NY Sectional Chart (courtesy of John Voss)\n\nas having 3 bituminous runways, with the longest being 3,865'.\n\nHowever, the remarks included \"NE/SW runway closed.\"\n\nLynn Gentzsch recalled, “I flew out of 3M Airport from 1965-66 & knew Harold Hayden & his partner. A real pair!\n\nOne had been a barnstormer & was my 1st instructor.\n\nHe demonstrated some of his skills to me which I remember vividly!\n\nThey had a Douglas DC-3 that they rented out & in the hangar they has a complete, but disassembled Jenny!”\n\nAfter Engle Flying Service moved out of 3M Airport,\n\nHortman Aviation relocated from Morrisville Airport (which had closed) to 3M Airport\n\nat some point between 1969-70 (according to Nathan Sturman).\n\n3M Airport was very busy due to the nearby construction of the Levittown housing development,\n\nand had Cessna, Piper and Grumman dealerships with an FBO.\n\nInstructor Tom Schafer taxies out with student pilot Paul Taylor\n\nin an American Aviation Yankee at 3M Airport in 1970 (photo courtesy of Nathan

Yankee],\n\nand I spoke to Mrs Hortman on the phone & scheduled my 1st lesson in the Yankee with Bill Barenberg.\n\nIt was Earth Day, 1970 as I remember, high overcast.\n\nTaking lessons from Bill (and as my log reveals Ken Langford & Norm Hortman, probably a progress check),\n\nI soled shortly afterward on May 10, 1970 in the red Yankee N5711L\n\non runway 29 at 3M at about eleven o'clock in the morning.\n\nBill went around twice with me & told me to make the next landing to a full stop.\n\nWe taxiied back & Bill asked me for my student pilot's license which he wrote something on the back of.\n\nI still wasn't wise as to what was happening.\"\n\nNathan continued, \"Then he crushed out his cigarette in the ashtray,\n\nstood up through the open canopy & got out onto the wing.\n\n'Take it around the pattern once & don't [screw] up,' he said,\n\nlooking down at a terrified Nate Sturman.\n\n'If I like what I see I'll let you do it again.'\n\nHeart pounding, happy beyond words I taxied back to the bubble,\n\ndid a careful runup & pre-takeoff check & I was off!\n\n'Yankee 11Lima departing Runway 29er at 3M' I proudly announced on the unicom.\n\nI was surprised that the plane performed so much better with only my weight as I remember.\n\nNice landings, 3 in a row, each time checking back with Bill at the intersection,\n\nand no dreaded 'porpoise'- it was before the larger main tires were fitted.\n\nThey took a bit of my shirt tail as I remember, don't remember where it is now.\"\n\nKen Lankford recalled, “I was an instructor at 3M in 1970,\n\nLots of stories came out of that time working for Yvette & Norm!\n\nOne cloudy day, Mike Shea & I came across Norm Hortman's Very Pistol from his early days of transatlantic flying.\n\nWe shot it off & it lit up all of Levittown!\n\nI think Mike has a picture that he took before the fire engines from 6 towns arrived.”\n\nA 1970 aerial view showed that a hangar had been added at some point between 1963-70 along the

at this airport.”\n\nNathan Sturman passed along the following story about a crash at 3M Airport.\n\n\"On the afternoon of Friday, 6/16/1978, I was on the job as a flight instructor for Hortman Aviation at 3M.\n\nA new student, Jane Howe, had just been brought in by her grandfather, got an orientation ride.\n\nShe was to take lessons with me to 1st solo & beyond.\n\nBut on parting that 1st day she warned me that there was something I ought to know,\n\nthat she had been a jinx all her life, and that weird things might happen around there now that she had appeared.\"\n\nNathan continued, \"Well, as she, her gramps and her 2 kids left,\n\nin strode Mr. Seymour Hundley, a very popular & enthusiastic middle-aged student pilot\n\nwho had just soloed a couple of weeks earlier.\n\nBeing in his late forties or early fifties he was not the most apt student (heavy handed but otherwise OK)\n\nbut with time & patient instruction he learned how to handle the PA-128-150 Warrior\n\nand soloed eventually with about 24 hours' experience.\n\nHe actually got pretty good at landings.\n\nWell, Seymour came in that afternoon to practice solo flying,\n\nand even though his supervised soles were done I gave him the customary Hortman 'wind check' (once around the pattern)\n\nand got out way down Runway 11/29 at the intersection with the closed runway,\n\ntelling him to pick me up there after his 1st landing. It was overcast as I recall.\"\n\nNathan continued, \"He took off normally from Runway 29 & flew a nice pattern\n\nbut another aircraft entered downwind in front of him & he extended his downwind leg considerably,\n\nbarely visible over the turnpike bridge & then turned onto a base leg, too low & far out...\n\nhe seemed to be descending in stairs, with irregular bursts of power which I could then hear faintly,\n\nlike a WWI plane with a rotary engine crouping,\n\nor a diesel model engine in lean undercompression toward the end of its run.\n\nThe landing light was on as he turned final directly from the base turn,\n\nthe procedure for loss of power.\n\nA flight instructor's nightmare: the power lines before the runway threshold were in front of the light!\n\nHe was really low, no flaps as he was told on emergency approaches,\n\nsinking & dragging with alternating bursts of power & simultaneously out of altitude, airspeed & ideas\n\nwhen his undercarriage snapped the power lines & the plane tumbled over\n\nand plunged to earth with a loud 'crump' behind the trees.\n\nBright sparks shot from the snapped lines & soon a loud wailing civil defense siren went off in the distance.\n\nI was about 800 meters away but began running as fast as my size 11 Florsheims would carry me,\n\nbut making no progress, like in a dream where you run in bed but can't get anywhere.\"\n\nNathan continued, \"Beyond the trees at the runway's end I could hear voices shouting 'jump!', 'jump!',\n\nand a small plume of bluish white smoke was rising, with a sputtering & buzzing as from arc welding.\n\nThen as I reached perhaps the intersection with Runway 1\n\na fireball rose above the trees followed by a column of black smoke & a sharp explosion,\n\nfollowed by another & a small mushroom cloud.\n\nWhen I reached the bubble at the runway's end I could feel the intense heat\n\nas I found an opening in the barbed wire & began clawing my way through the briar patch & dense wood.\n\nThe plane was blazing away & the Lower Bucks Fire & Rescue people & vehicles were there already,\n\nas were the nearby factory personnel & some fellows from the airport who beat me there by driving around in the Jeep.\"\n\nNathan continued, \"Well, miraculously, Seymour was fine,\n\nbut the plane had been flattened & was blazing furiously.\n\nA wire had arced onto the left wing tank & burnt a hole in it, setting off the explosion,\n\nand Seymour heeded the advice to jump, not step, off of the wing.\n\nNearly tragically, he jumped back onto the plane\n\nand disappeared into the blazing cabin FOR HIS STUDENT PILOT KIT.\n\nAll's well that end's well, though.\n\nThey took Seymour to Lower Bucks County hospital for observation\n\nand he had a minor injury to his shoulder, that was all, probably saved by that 3-point harness & his quick action.\"\n\nNathan continued, \"The Bucks County Courier Times carried an article on the crash the next day.\n\nAs usual with aviation stories they had it all wrong, and erroneously put ME in the plane with Seymour\n\nsaying that we hit wires while landing & both escaped a fiery end, etc.\n\nMy mother was working at Gimbel's Cheltenham store & her coworkers showed her this story,\n\nand my wife heard that account too & probably always had doubts about what happened.\n\nA lot of people heard the reports & my name on the evening news, KYW etc.,\n\nand the crash made at least one network that evening.\"\n\nNathan continued, \"The FAA cleared Seymour & ruled that it had been a fuel starvation caused by a probable foreign object.\n\nThe maintenance shop objected to this, as the plane had just come out of 100 hour inspection,\n\nand they demonstrated how a pilot could close the mixture instead of the throttle,\n\nthen pump the throttle & feed gas with the accelerator pump,\n\nthus getting that cycle of surging & windmilling.\n\nThe FAA, however, stuck by their judgment.\"\n\nNathan continued, \"Hundley returned. He insisted that he had closed the mixture as the plane went in, not before.\n\nI was the 1st to fly with him after his return a couple of weeks later.\n\nHe was really nervous, with a death grip on the yoke,\n\nand I was starting to worry because he was a really big man with what seemed the biggest hands in the western world.\n\nHe smoothly reduced power, slowed down a bit & lowered a notch of flap.\n\nJust then, ahead of us & below, a car exploded in a traffic accident on the Turnpike Bridge in the Delaware\n\nand a black plume of smoke went boiling upwards toward us. Talk about bad timing.\n\nSeymour just turned base in quite a funk I am sure, flew a perfect base & final,\n\nmade the best landing of his career to date & taxied back to the pumps.\n\nHe had a few more rides before giving up on his license with us I recall.\n\nYears later I heard that he was flying an old Cessna 150 of his own somewhere in New Jersey.\"\n\nA 1978 photo by Fred Roberts of Nathan Sturman in front of a 1978 Grumman American AA-5B Tiger at 3M Airport.\n\nRecalling the flight from the same airfield in 1927 of the Keystone Pathfinder 'American Legion',\n\nNathan Sturman observed, “In all of the perhaps thousands of takeoffs & landings\n\nI did on that strip I never dreamt of whose steps I was literally following in.\n\nTime joins us all together in funny ways with those who went before.”\n\nJoe Koch recalled, “I got my ticket at 3M in 1978. A great place & I did fly with Nate Sturman 2 times.\n\nI used to take a Grumman & go to Van Sant. One day I was going flying & Herb [Hortman] asked where I was going & I told him VanSant.\n\nWell he told me his mom did not want renters going into there. I told him I had been doing it for a year & he said OK, no problem.”\n\nJoe confirmed that 3M was a dealer for the Grumman aircraft line.\n\nBut Joe elaborated, “The instructors did not like them. They called them garbage cans. I really liked them.\n\nA J3 taught you rudder & how to fly & a Grumman was the same only a lot faster!!!”\n\nThe last photo which has been located showing 3M as an active airport was a 1979 photo of Joe Koch & his father in front of a C150 that was owned by a friend of his dad.\n\nWalt Stepek recalled, “When I finally decided to start taking lessons in 1980 I did have an introductory ride in a Grumman AA-1C at 3M, and enjoyed the experience.\n\nIt was truly sad to see 3M Airport close, but happily enough, the Hortmans were able to locate to Philly Northeast.”\n\nAccording to K. Doolin, the 3M Company closed the airport around 1980 due to insurance concerns,\n\nand Hortmann Aviation moved to the Northeast Philadelphia Airport.\n\nIn spite of other indications that it had closed several years earlier,\n\n3M Airport was still depicted as an active airfield on the March 1981 Philly Terminal Area Chart,\n\nand depicted as having 3 paved runways, with the longest being 3,700'.\n\nThe 1981 USGS topo map still depicted the 3 runways of 3M Airport, as well as multiple buildings around its periphery.\n\n3M Airport was depicted as a closed airport on the March 1987 Philadelphia Terminal Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of Kevin O'Reilly).\n\nIn a 4/25/92 USGS aerial photo, all 3 runways at 3M Airport still remained largely intact,\n\nalong with the former Hortman hangar on the southeast side of Runway 1,\n\nand the Kaiser-Fleetwings aircraft factory along the west side of the field.\n\nBy the time of this 1998 aerial photo (Philip Kineyko),\n\nthe former airport had been reused as an industrial park.\n\nThe former northeast/southwest runway had been completely built over,\n\nalthough the 2 larger runways were still recognizable (the longest is 4,000').\n\nThe remains of the runways have been reused as roads for the surrounding businesses.\n\nThe former Kaiser-Fleetwings aircraft factory was also still standing,\n\nvisible in the right side of the photo.\n\nA 1999 aerial view showed that the hangar remained standing on the southeast side of Runway 1.\n\nA 2002 aerial view showed that the Hortman hangar on the southeastern end of Runway 1\n\nhad been removed at some point between 1999-2002.\n\nAccording to Tom Sofield, “In fall 2005 director Night Shyamalan filmed his film 'Lady in the Water' at the old 3M Airport.\n\nThere was a 5-story shell of an apartment building built with a real pool that was used for the filming of the movie.”\n\nA 10/7/11 aerial photo, showed that 2 of the runways from 3M Airport had been reused as streets.\n\nThe former Kaiser-Fleetwings aircraft factory along the west side of the field also remained intact.\n\nThe site of 3M Airport is located north of the intersection of the Pennsylvania Turnpike & Route 13.\n\nA clue to the former role of the property may be found in the names of the streets\n\nof a small residential development adjacent to the west side of the former airfield,\n\nwhich include \"Fleetwing [sic] Drive\", \"Mitchell Road\", \"Airacobra Street\", and \"Liberator Street\".\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nSince this site was first put on the web in 1999, its popularity has grown tremendously.\n\nThat has caused it to often exceed bandwidth limitations\n\nset by the company which I pay to host it on the web.\n\nIf the total quantity of material on this site is to continue to grow,\n\nit will require ever-increasing funding to pay its expenses.\n\nTherefore, I request financial contributions from site visitors,\n\nto help defray the increasing costs of the site\n\nand ensure that it continues to be available & to grow.\n\nWhat would you pay for a good aviation magazine, or a good aviation book?\n\nPlease consider a donation of an equivalent amount, at the least.\n\nThis site is not supported by commercial advertising –\n\nit is purely supported by donations.\n\nIf you enjoy the site, and would like to make a financial contribution,\n\nyou may use a credit card via , using one of 2 methods:\n\nTo make a one-time donation of an amount of your choice:\n\nOr you can sign up for a $10 monthly subscription to help support the site on an ongoing basis:\n\nOr if you prefer to contact me directly concerning a contribution (for a mailing address to send a check),\n\nplease contact me at: paulandterryfreeman@gmail.com\n\nIf you enjoy this web site, please support it with a financial contribution.\n\nOr if you prefer to contact me directly concerning a contribution (for a mailing address to send a check),\n\nplease contact me at: paulandterryfreeman@gmail.com\n\nIf you enjoy this web site, please support it with a financial contribution.\n\n____________________________________________________"
