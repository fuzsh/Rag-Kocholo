        "text": "Previously Sold\n\nALL OF THESE WERE AND FLEW AWAY\n\nThe following wonderful birds FLEW AWAY!\n\nWACO UPF-7 FOR SALE: 1942 NC39738\n\nWe acquired this plane in 1996 and have been taking care of it ever since. When first purchased, we carefully went through it. It had been completed restored in 1985. We put on a new tailwheel fork, Cleveland wheels and brakes, overhauled the landing gears, new fuel tanks from RARE Aircraft, updated avionics and put a nice varnished floor on the front for loading and unloading passengers. The last engine we put on the plane was built with a NOS crankshaft so we know the complete history of the most important part of the engine and that there was no chance it had ever had a prop strike during military years. Remember, we’re the folks that did the STCs for the W670 replacement pistons, valve stem guides and the latest generation bronze race roller bearing so you don’t need to bother us with questions as to whether it has a roller bearing or not! While using this at the Museum of Flight at Boeing Field, it had an annual every 100 hours; not just once a year. In 2016, we had John Pike at Big Sky Stearman in Oregon completely recover and paint the plane for us. I had new upholstery seats and cockpit combing made and stitched on. The Sensenich square tip 96 X 58 pitch propeller (which we prefer for top short field performance) was factory inspected and refinished at the Sensenich factory in Plant City at the same time we had the plane recovered. If someone wants a cruise prop instead of what we prefer, we’ll put a new 98: X 64″ wood prop on it instead as long as the square tip stays here. It’s a very well balanced plane and very easy to fly. We’ve also installed the ADS-B “out” requirement on the plane. The rear cockpit is complete for flying. While we have co-pilot stick and pedals ready to hookup for flying from the front, a purchaser will need to put in some of the front cockpit instruments in the panel which we haven’t bothered with during its years with us flying passengers. This plane will only be sold to an individual with suitable tailwheel experience and 25 hours already in a by-plane. Total hours since full restoration in 1987: 3,461 Hours since recovering: 75 Engine SMOH: 300\n\nSold to Ed B\n\nAsking Price $ 135,000 OBO This plane is available for pickup on September 1, 2019\n\nPlease call to discuss this plane only if you are a qualified buyer. We are too busy flying rides to take too much time to talk, although we’ll spend hours with the proper buyer who really wants to take care of this collectible. A text is best.\n\nCell – (206)-730-1412 Ask for Ken.\n\n1978 Bellanca 7ECA “Citabria”\n\nWe purchased this plane one year ago for $37,000 out of Minneapolis and flew it to Seattle for our tailwheel training and endorsement program. It is an excellent stable well balanced craft with an 0-235C engine in it with approximately 1250 hours on the engine; TTAF is 2250. This is a wood spar wing totally AD inspected and serviceable with a 520 lb useful load. This plane has worked well for us however our tailwheel instructor has been offered a career opportunity at a company in Oregon. We had ten pilots pass their tailwheel endorsement in this plane and it was represented in social medium as being in good condition. We can’t justify running a tailwheel program at our company with part time instructors; only full time. So even though we’ve only had this plane a short period, we’re going to let our two trainers go to keep our costs down. This plane needs to find its ownership with a Young Eagle just starting out needing a dependable “first plane” trainer to build hours. It would be an excellent plane for father and son/daughter team where Dad wants to introduce his son/daughter to a capable trainer that flies “now” and is fully airworthy and learn how to care for an airplane. The fabric is an good condition having been used in Minnesota where seasons are short and planes are always hangered. I’ve glued back down a couple spots on the upper wing where some tapes were lifting and I overlapped them with 3″ tape. Waiting to touch up some paint this spring once temperatures warm up. The fuselage doesn’t need anything and metal parts up front are actually recently painted before we bought it. So we figured we’d offer the plane at the lowest entry price we could to see if someone wants to snap it up at a steal with it discounted by the this price. Note: I just purchased a set of new tires and full set of new plugs yesterday for her; threw in another $ 450.00 of value. This plane will not last long at this price. It’s priced to be snapped up quickly.\n\nAsking Price $ 29,500 “in annual” SOLD TO DAVID G\n\n1975 Cessna 180-J #N6942V SN #18052566\n\nTTAF 1950 No Damage History!

NO STOL KIT installed and VS stabilizers. Extra parts include: Complete set of Bruce Custom Covers, NOS Spare Stinger (new), Door Standards-Shocks, not installed. Selkirk Fiberglass strut fairing kit (new and painted) and NOS Cessna strut gaskets, Alaska Bushwheel spare part kit for steerable tailwheel (new).\n\nThis plane is a 10/10 inside and out. In 2009 I searched for a low time 180 with no damage history and then did everything I wanted to it that I ever dreamed of. It gets compliments wherever we go. Never on floats. Meticulously cared for and always kept in a heated hangar with a dehumidifier. The only thing that I didn’t get around to yet was to install a modern auto pilot. It was pre-wired for an S-tec 45 or 50 when the new panel/instruments were installed. To give you an idea of how this plane has been cared for, the instrument package with new panel alone was $ 57,000; paint job and detail to new stainless steel parts, roller kit, leading edge kit and seals was $ 24,000; Upholstery was $ 12,000, 3 Blade Hartzell and New Engine Mount were $30,000 (includes labor); etc, etc. All told, I have 240,000 in hard dollars in this plane. The only reason I’m selling it is that I also have a Cessna 185 which we’ve just finished doing everything to in a similar fashion and I can use it to replace the 180. I will miss this plane; it’s been one of the happiest planes I’ve ever owned. I’ve used the plane to visit clients on the west coast and in the Mid-West so I’ve been able to depreciate it until my remaining “basis” is equivalent to the asking price. I actually enjoy the 180 better than the 185 due to the lower weight and carburetor for hot restarts. But the 185 is at full basis and “business decisions” decides the sale of the 180 over the 185 at this time. Flown regularly and maintained to highest standards. All records on ADLOG system*(See below). This is a premium price for a premium condition airplane!\n\n*Very Important Notes: FULL DISCLOSURE\n\nThis plane was sold about thirty days ago to a buyer at $ 170,000 subject to satisfaction with a pre-buy inspection. Between the time of deposit and the pre-buy inspection, seller had a full annual done. We also had new seat tracks installed, new Slick Magnetos installed, new induction system air hoses, and New Michelin Tires put on although previous parts were all still in serviceable condition. I just wanted to really make everything perfect for the buyer! The pre-buy inspection was conducted by Avian FBO at Bremerton National Airport. The Pre-buy inspection IA reported the plane was in “excellent condition and recommended a “buy.” Also suggested the plane was underpriced. The pre-buy inspector prepared a long term “to do” list for the buyer. The seller (myself) went ahead and completed the entire “future to do list” as recommended by the Pre-buy IA at Avian at a further cost of $ 3,200. Approximately $ 10,000 in further add-ons and work has been put into the plane by the seller since the description in earlier paragraphs above. During the pre-buy inspection, one of the original airframe logs from BEFORE our current ownership was misplaced. This may have been due to a different N number on the log as I had the N number changed when the plane was painted in 2016. All 337s for the period of the missing airframe log are with the records which show no repairs from damage. However, the prospective buyer was not pleased that the missing earlier airframe book could not be located and has chose not to conclude the purchase. It is important that any prospective buyer understand that this earlier airframe book may not be located despite the fact that all 337s for this period are properly kept on file and with the records. The original engine log on the current factory remanufactured engine dating back to 2001 are with the records as are all airframe logs since our ownership and care. The IA that conducted the pre-buy for this buyer is readily available for conversation with a qualified buyer whom has a serious interest to report on this plane. I just cannot give out his name and number without first being sure of the level of the inquiry, hence the reason I don’t list it here. When this plane was originally advertised, we received over 60 calls in four days, so I have to protect this poor guy from everyone calling him until it’s at a serious “willing to purchase” level. KH\n\n____________________________SOLD 170,000 ____________________________________________________________\n\n1935 UKC-S Cabin WACO, #NC14611\n\n$129,000 *\n\nCongratulations Paul & Dana “with a second zero time engine included”\n\n“2006 Grand Champion National Biplane Association Cabin Biplane”\n\nThis is one of my three very special planes that are not normally used at the Museum on a regular basis but only brought out for special events. There were only 5 UKC-S airplanes built. We know of only 1 other in airworthy flying condition today. This is a low time 1350 hour TTAF airplane and only 130 hours since total restoration. Then we took our preference for the incredible W-670-23 engine (constant speed) and worked with the FAA designated engineers to STC the 240 hp engine on this airplane totally “by the book.” It is very fast and cruises nearly 10% faster than our 275 hp Jacobs powered YKS-6. The engine only has about 75 hours on it. I have it set up with a 2B20-9 polished propeller as I generally 3 point the airplane. Beautifully upholstered in a dark brown interior with all necessary avionics including a CD system and 4 place intercom, transponder, etc. I finished this one out for my own special enjoyment and care. Have flown the plane from Colorado Springs to Seattle in a single day with only two fuels stops. This is a very special plane and deserves an owner who really wants something unique. General Robin Olds got a big kick out flying this airplane when I was at Bartlesville.\n\nOn June of 2010, while making a landing on an asphalt runway (Boeing Field) in a particularly strong crosswind (gusting to 17 at 90 degrees), I side loaded the landing gear more than 1934-35 engineers had designed for and broke the left landing gear strut. This resulted in 3 broken outboard ribs on the lower left wing and a prop strike. The plane was repaired with completely new wing spars in addition to the new ribs as I had always wanted to reinforce the wing walk area with “boxing” across the underside as well; so I figured we’d replace the spars at the same time. Propeller was replaced—-not repaired. Engine was disassembled as is required and reassembled with new crank case and crankshaft since the engine had a mandatory teardown inspection required anyway. But the single most outstanding change we made was to upgrade the landing gear from the 2 ½” original 34/35 landing gear struts to the Waco 1936 Heavy Duty landing gear struts which are 3″ in diameter. This was the big transition that Waco did to the planes in ’36 which caused the planes to gain acceptance by the freight haulers in Alaska and Canada. The heavy duty landing gears are known as -6 landing gears and upgraded the gross weight capacity of the plane by an additional 400 lbs. The “travel” on the heavy duty landing gear is 6″ more than the originals from 1934/35. We have found this to be an outstanding upgrade. Additional costs to upgrade to the Heavy Duty landing gear beyond that which was replaced as described above was $ 40,000. including parts and labor. By going from a “fabric” cover from the landing gear to the rear landing gear struts to a “landing gear fairing,” we also gained a 10% cruise speed improvement. Found all the improvements to be highly desirable and have been very pleased with the upgraded configurations. (KH)\n\n1932 Cabin Waco UEC (very rare)\n\nSold to Carsten S. in Germany\n\n$ 44,000.\n\nThis airplane was acquired because it was one of the first three original OECs which was built with a Kinner engine and then later upgraded to the Continental Engine at the Waco Factory by Waco themselves. It was also built originally with fuel tanks in the bottom wings as well as the top with a “wobble pump” factory installed. Consequently the use of lower wing tanks at restoration can be done without any further paperwork as it was a “factory installation.”\n\nThis is the same model of airplane that John Swander in Kansas restored which is the beautiful black plane you often see at the fly-ins. And, John has been very helpful in providing certain items including patterns for the metal cowling on this airplane.\n\nThe plane was acquired “fully assembled” with no parts missing other than the metal cowling for which we now have full patterns. It does not have an engine or propeller. It has original red upholstery which is in excellent condition as there were not many original hours on the airplane. We haven’t decided whether to change the upholstery or not although I’ve been leaning towards not changing it.\n\nThe plane was purchased originally for $ 39,000. Since that time, we have acquired a speed ring cowl from John Swander for $ 2,000 and a front exhaust system for a Continental Engine from Forest Lovely for $ 2,500. I’ve had ceramic plating of the exhaust done locally and I have Jon Murray currently building an exhaust bayonet for $ 200.\n\nOur investment in this plane currently stands at about $ 44,000.\n\n$44,000\n\nNo trades!\n\nCashier’s check only\n\n$ 5,000 to hold\n\nCell – (206)-730-1412 Ask for Ken.\n\n1927 Travel Air, #NC3823\n\n$145,000\n\nBrand New Restoration\n\n#NC3823\n\nZero Time Full Restoration, 10 hours on new engine with NOS crankshaft and very rare Continental 9” shielded breeze ring harness. (Same as what we sold on 1929 Travel Air shown above). This is our original biplane with which we started Olde Thyme Aviation. We flew it for five years and then took it out of service for a complete and total restoration starting with the bead blasting of the frame and rebuilding the entire plane. The airplane is very rare with the sought after “elephant ear” ailerons, new upholstery, updated avionics, intercom system, transponder, etc and we deliberately used the 8.50 by 10” tiers rather than the narrow wheels which have been the source of 3 Travel Air incidents in the Northwest on beautifully restored airplanes this year alone. Since full restoration, I have flown the plane to the McMinnville fly-in and the engine is still in its break-in procedure. The artwork shown in the photos is a memorial to Clayton Scott, local pioneer pilot who recently passed away at age 101 after the Renton Airport was named after him. Current artwork on the plane is of high quality vinyl and not permanently painted. It is Removable with a hair dryer.. No expense has been spared on this restoration. It is basically a brand new 1927 airplane.\n\n$145,000\n\nNo trades!\n\nCashier’s check only\n\n$ 5,000 to hold Cell – (206)-730-1412 Ask for Ken.\n\n1936 Cabin Waco YKS-6\n\n$ 87,000\n\nOnce Owned by Walter Beech!\n\n2250 TTAF, 650 hours since full restoration, 460 SMOH R-755-B 275 H.P. Air Repair (w/22 STC mods), 100 SO on 2B20-9 Propeller with polished blades. Beautiful total restoration by William Bohannon in Columbus, Ohio in 1997. Finished in Alumagrip polyurethane finish. Constant speed prop cruises at 110 mph at 2000 RPM and 18″ manifold pressure. Have personally flown the plane over 11,000′ altitude. This plane flies like a dream. All the feel and style of biplane flying in more comfort. Great to lengthen the season and good for fall and winter. This engine loves cold weather. Plane has a colorful history, including being owned by Walter Beech (documented). This is the plane that was owned by Walter Beech personally (documented) in the years prior to his developing the Staggerwing. The Cabin Waco is a poor man’s “Beaver.” One of only 65 original YKS-6 airplanes built; no idea how many are left. We know of only a half dozen others.\n\nThe reason this plane is priced at only 85,000 instead of 100,000, is that it is a “working airplane” that I use nearly every day for my regular job. It is not a hangar queen. Consequently from my constant use, the urethane based alumagrip finish eventually forms a few “craze lines” at the edges of the stringers and where someone has occasionally put a foot against some fabric. I touch it up each season and from a distance the plane “shimmers” as if it were a perfect finish. Up close, once can fine the craze marks that don’t bother me as I use the plane for work. It does not need to be recovered or repainted and can be flow exactly as it is for another 10-15 years before recovering.\n\n650 hours since full restoration in 1994-complete photo history of restoration\n\n$ 87,000\n\n1944 Boeing Stearman Model E75\n\n1944 N2S-4 Boeing Stearman Model E75 – Mfg. Serial No. 75-5586 (U.S. Army Air Corp S/N 42- 17423. U.S. Navy S/N 52804)\n\n2900 TTAF, 460 SMOH, Continental W-670 220 HP, Sensenich Wood Prop, Red-line Brakes, Immaculate Condition and Restoration. #N68462\n\n$ 125,000\n\nThis plane was one of the last model (E75) manufactured and was delivered to the U.S. Army Air Corp at the Wichita, Kansas plant of the Boeing Co. (former Stearman plant) during May of 1944 as a PT-13D (U.S. Navy N2S5). With the present Continental W-670 220 HP engine and Bendix landing gear, it is a PT 17 or a U.S. Navy Model N2S4. The data plate lists both Army and Navy serial nos. given above. The plane was originally all silver, as were all E75 Stearman near the close of World War II, whether for the Army Air Corp or the U.S. Navy. However, for improved visibility, it is now painted AN Blue (fuselage) and AN Yellow (flying surfaces) as a somewhat earlier version of the trainer ordered by the Army but then delivered to the Navy, as was sometimes done during the war. The plane has been carefully researched for U.S. Navy markings that were specified during the period. They are less ornate than those used by the Army at that time.\n\nThe plane was initially assigned to a contract pilot school at War Eagle Field in Lancaster, Calif. Later assignments were to Minter Field (Bakersfield), Mather Field (Sacramento), and ultimately to a Civil Air Patrol unit at Hill Field in Ogden, Utah, where it was offered for sale as surplus in 1949. The total original cost to the U.S. Government in 1944 was $ 9,120.\n\nThe plane has approximately 2582 hours on it and has always been configured as a two place trainer. It is being flown now at Boeing Field. It has never had its frame cut and was never used as a sprayer! The plane was rebuilt at 1960 hours and totally restored (not recovered, but fully restored) in 1987. Since full restoration, the plane has only been flown 500 hours. A new rebuilt engine was installed in 1999. Since restoration it has been stored in an insulated hangar with a dehumidifier always operating. The plane is essentially like new except for the engine (334 hours SMOH by renowned Gold Coast Aviation in Salinas, California) and is very original except for the electric system (has both starter and generator), the avionics (Narco Mark 12D Nav/Comm. w/localizer & glide-slope, ELT, Transponder w/altitude encoder, Sigtronics intercom) and Whelen strobe/nav lights.\n\nRestoration, covering, painting (aerothane), assembly, rigging and testing were performed by well-known Stearman restorer/mechanic in the Northwest named Chuck Milton of Antique Aero from Snohomish, Washington, who maintained Joanne Osterud’s aerobatic show aircraft for many years. Chuck was known as “Mr. Stearman” for his quality restoration work in the 1980s. His work was the equivalent then of what is seen today by Air Repair in Mississippi. This plane was selected WARBIRD GRAND CHAMPION at the Arlington EAA 1987 Fly-IN and was later judged BEST OF CLASS (1936-45 Military) at the 1987 Northwest Antique Aircraft Fly-In held at Evergreen Field in Vancouver, WA.\n\nOlde Thyme Aviation ® purchased this plane in 1999 with 2288 hours TTAF with a run-out engine. The plane had been properly stored for the prior four years once reaching TBO and hadn’t been flown since then. After we purchased this plane for the quality and care of the finish, frame and woodwork we replaced the engine with a new rebuilt by Gold Coast Aviation. Gold Coast Aviation is legendary for the Continental-220 rebuilds it has specialized in for nearly 40 years. We only purchase from or have our engines on our entire fleet of biplanes worked on by Larry Lujan at Gold Coast in Salinas. We also had a new transponder installed.\n\nThe plane weighs 2,175 without fuel, oil crew and baggage and has a max gross weight of 2,950; fully aerobatic (+6.67g to -2.67g) and with the certificated max gross weight of 2,950 is flown solo from the rear cockpit.\n\nThis plane had a “ground loop” on the return from Galesburg this September. Since we had to put a new lower right wing on the airplane anyway, we went ahead and stripped the fuselage, jigged it as if it were the start of a full new restoration, and did exactly that. We recovered the upper right wing (new fabric and new fittings) at the same time. Other wings look totally brand new inside. So this plane is actually better than it started out on the way to Galesburg since we improved on some items in the fuselage which we noticed from the 1987 restoration that we would have done differently…….so we did. Final paint will be done this spring. $ 5,000 holds your plane until the new fuselage paint covering and wings are done probably in May.\n\nPlease do not call unless you are a ready buyer.\n\nNo trades considered.\n\nCashier’s check only.\n\n$ 5,000 to hold\n\nBecause we work full-time daily and are often flying rides in our two-seaters, we cannot afford to talk other than to a serious potential buyer. We can deliver this plane to any location with a sale. $ 5,000 deposit to hold.\n\nCell – (206)-730-1412 Ask for Ken.\n\nClick image for a larger size\n\nFlew Away $125,000\n\n“Congratulation Jim L.”\n\n1929 Travel Air 4000 SOLD for $175,000\n\n1929 Travel Air 4000 “E”\n\nClick for larger picture\n\nThe Travel Air company competed head to head with all the other early burgeoning aircraft companies in the mid-1920s with similar concept airframes and Fokker imitation wings often with counterbalanced ailerons. In 1929, Travel Air modified its Travel Air 4000 and redesigned the ends of the upper wings to utilize Frieze ailerons and finished off the wingtips in a more modern rounded configuration which allowed the ends of the wings to add lift and load carrying capacity. This extra modification in both the weight carrying capacity and the finishing of the wings increased the popularity of this airplane markedly and caused the sales of the Travel Air 4000 with the “E” wing configuration to soar. There were more Travel Air 4000s of this wing design sold than all previous Travel Air 2000s, 3000s and 4000s combined.\n\nThe airplane was originally configured with a Wright J-6 Whirlwind 5 cylinder radial engine with 165 horsepower @ 1800 rpm Currently powered with a Continental W-670 Radial Engine with 220 hp at 2150 RPM\n\nlength overall 24’1″\n\nheight overall 8’11”\n\nwingspan (upper) 33′\n\nwingspan (lower) 28’9″\n\nwing chord (upper) 5’6″\n\nwing chord (lower) 4’8″\n\nwing area (upper) 171 sq’\n\nwing area (lower) 118 sq’\n\ngross weight 2,702 lbs\n\nempty weight 1,695 lbs\n\nuseful load 1,007 lbs\n\npayload with full fuel (67 gal.) 393 lbs\n\nmaximum speed 120 mph\n\ncruise speed 103 mph\n\nrate of climb 720 ft. per min.\n\nsurface ceiling 13,000 ft\n\nlanding speed 48 mph\n\nstall speed 39 mph\n\nnormal cruising range 650 miles\n\nfuel capacity 67 gal.\n\noil capacity 6 gal.\n\nThis aircraft is a full ground-up restoration and not simply a re-covering or rejuvenation. Every part of the aircraft was disassembled and rebuilt individually in a meticulous 4 year process with a professional shop/not a homebuilder or hobbyist. The reason this plane is price approximately $ 25,000 higher than other restored Travel Airs is because the wings are absolutely and totally brand new having been built by Mr. Travel Air himself, Mr. Frank Rezich of Paso Robles, California. This is one of the last sets of wings he built and he currently will not build any more sets of wings at any price! This is reason for the premium pricing. We would have saved $ 25,000 by restoring or rejuvenating the existing wings but chose not to do so. They are absolutely brand new including the center section with a new fuel tank. The fabric is done in the more highly desirable but much more time consuming butyrate dope over ceconite by Air Fab of Hollister California whom also did the covering and stitching. If any of you know their work, they use the “old art” processes but result in a finish just as polished or reflective as the aerothanes but affording the ability to work or repair the surfaces yourself down the road. The cost of the wings, covering and finishing on this plane was no less than $ 55,000. The color is Boston Maroon in a chevron pattern configuration on leading edges and Diana Cream.\n\nGold Coast Aviation rebuilt the plane starting with the bead blasting and magnafluxing of the frame, epoxy coating, fittings, etc, fuel tanks, engine, etc. We have set this plane up for flight at modern airports using 8.50 X 10 tires and not the narrow taller original wheels which are an invitation to disaster to someone acquiring a vintage biplane but desiring to actually fly it rather than it simply becoming a hangar queen. The plane has a steerable scott 10″ tailwheel on leaf springs.\n\nWe are offering the plane in either of two engine configurations. The engine we currently have on this plane has 160 hours on it. This particular W-670 engine is custom built by Gold Coast Aviation and was used as the “test run” engine for the new W-670 replacement pistons of the harder alloy as developed in the STC. Consequently this engine also has the STCd roller bearings and valve guides which were STCd at the same time. The engine was finished off, at our special request, using a rare “Breeze” ring which is nearly impossible to find today which we had nickel plated. Instead of shielded plastic wiring coming from the back of the cylinders to the spark plugs, this engine shows the original braided wires going from the “Breeze” ring in the front of the engine directly to the spark plug leads. See photos. It gives a final touch that recalls the way ignition harness looked originally.\n\nThe purchaser of this airplane will have the choice of taking the plane with the above described engine or we will install, at our cost, a zero time W-670 engine with skytronics harness (the more conventional configuration) but this engine will also have the roller bearings on the crankshaft (STC) and the new valve guides (STC).\n\nIncluding the original $ 45,000 paid for this airplane before it was disassembled for total restoration, we have spent over $ 195,000 on this airplane. This is way above the market and we realize this. We will make this plane available for the rest of 2004 and spring of 2005 before we phase the plane into our operation for scenic flights. Flight to see if there is anyone who would like to own this beauty personally. Please do not call just to talk. We don’t have time for this. If interested in a plane of this quality and pricing, fly out here and fly in the plane. We’ll reimburse you for the plane ticket if you buy the airplane.\n\nFlew Away $175,000\n\n“Congratulation Peter G.”\n\n1946 GLOBE SWIFT\n\n1946 Globe Swift/ 210 hp\n\nWe purchased this plane in 2003 for 27,000 with a mid time Continental 300 engine. This plane is used as our mechanic’s transportation plane to and from the Boeing Field in Seattle WA on weekends from Sequim WA.\n\nIn 2009 we completed the conversion of the engine to the Continental IO-360 with the Merlyn STC and engine mount. The conversion was done by master mechanic Lee Oman including the custom fitting of all baffle and cooling system upgrades and everything else required. We have received many complements from the Diamond Point “Swifities” on this conversion job. The cost for this conversion was $ 25,000 in parts and STC payment. The labor for the conversion was approximately $ 15,000.\n\nWe had a total of $ 67,000 in the plane and the conversion. Then we helped the Swift Association bring in the Hartzell propeller that is on the new Type Certificate for another $ 5,000. Our total in the plane is $ 75,000 “hard dollars.” (Along the way, Lee also rebuilt the landing gear system.)\n\nWe’re asking $ 59,000 for this plane which is an immediate savings to anyone else wanting to get a converted higher horsepower Swift of $ 16,000 minimum and possibly as high as 30,000 difference on “showpiece” airplanes.\n\nThe plane is not yet gone over to make it a showplace beauty in that it could take a lot of nice work and attention on the panel in the future. So if you’re looking for an outstanding dependable Swift with a superior higher horsepower conversion which would give you an outstanding flyer today with the ability to enhance physical beauty down the road, instead of putting out $ 90,000 for a “looker” right now, this is what this plane offers. It has only 2061 Total Hours on Airframe and has only 42 hours on the new Continental IO-360.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nCabin WACO FOR SALE: 1933 UIC Full Restoration\n\n1933 UIC Cabin WACO: Full Restoration\n\nTime Since Full Restoration: 15 hours; Continental W-670-6A 15 SMOH; Curtis Reed Prop 99″ 15 SMOH\n\nThis plane has a unique history and its history is the main reason we acquired it. The plane was ordered and built for George Allan Hancock whom developed and owned Hancock Oil in Southern California and is also well known as the man whom donated “Hancock Park” in Los Angeles to the County which contained the La Brea Tarpits: a destination known to all grade school kids growing up in LA. Later Captain Hancock operated one of the CPT schools at Santa Maria, California——owned the Santa Maria Railroad (the reason for the match between his Cabin Waco and the Trail in the painting above). Today the airport in Santa Maria is known as Hancock Field because of his philanthropy and that of his wife after Captain Hancock passed.\n\nThis airplane was totally disassembled for a full restoration starting with the bead blasting and epoxy on the airframe; all new wood on the fuselage; new ribs and fittings as needed in the wings; rebuilt landing gears; restoration of the original “Air Brake” system, etc. However, we improved the handling characteristics with a Cleveland 210 brake system (no Johnson Bar challenge). The interior is done in Full Grain Leather. Fabric was painted in original Waco manufacturing colors of Vermillion Red on Fuselage and Silver/Gray on the wings. The com is the enhanced split frequency used in Europe. The plane had been pre-sold to a buyer in the UK but we were unable to complete it soon enough for his needs; hence the split channel add-on for the com. ADSB-Out has been installed. It has a zero time W-670-6A Continental engine with all roller bearing and valve guide enhancements plus new generation STC’d pistons. We finished off this plane with a rare Curtis Reed prop of 99″ (not 96) for added performance. The yoke is a throw-over single yoke style with a full wheel. All told, we spent over $ 225,000 dollars on this restoration. Plane is located in Seattle, Washington."
