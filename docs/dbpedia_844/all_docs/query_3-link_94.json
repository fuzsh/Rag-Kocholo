        "text": "Just wanted to let everyone know that the folks at Sensenich are top hands. I called this morning to ask questions about what to do about flaking varnish on the brass leading edge of my wood prop plus how to maintain it periodically before I send it in next year for refurbishment. Charlie was very accomodating and answered all this neophites questions.\n\nBasically he told me to take a Scotchbrite pad and take the rest of the varnish off and polish the brass with Brasso or other metal polish. He told me to be sure not to take the varnish off the wood. Also that I could use paste wax like Minwax on the prop bolts but not on the threads of the bolts. He also suggested to use the paste wax on the wood protion of the prop. The brass portion to use car paste wax periodically to keep the brass protected from finger prints.\n\nI did find that it was best to tape off the wood so as not to scratch it and also I used some laquer thinner to soften the varnish then used a nylon scraper on the stubborn varnish. It took about two hours to do the prop. Patience is the key or you will scratch the wood.\n\nI was glad I pulled the prop off because I don&#039;t think it had been off since it was installed new in 2005. Besides the safety wire on the castle nuts was way too small a diameter. The instructions say to use .041 or cotter pins."
