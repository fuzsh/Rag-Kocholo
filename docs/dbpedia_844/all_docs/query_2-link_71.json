The average yield on railway shares at current prices is 7%. That some of the insurance companies are notably prosperous is shown by the declaration of a 100% bonus by the Liverpool & London & Globe Insurance Co., which is to be applied toward reducing uncalled liability. At the annual meeting of Lloyds Bank on Tuesday, Sir Richard Vassar Smith summarized Great .Britain's financial condition in a few words. He remarked that her adverse trade balance is no less than £2,000,000,000. By the time peace is formally declared, he estimated that the net debt would be about £8,000,000,000, or $40,000,000,000. From this may be deducted approximately £1,500,000,000 on loans recoverable from the Dominions and other allies. He pointed out the necessity of greater industry and of strict economy, and added that the capital that has been lost in the war can be replaced only by savings from profits on production. 607 Addressing the National Assembly yesterday the Chancellor outlined the peace program of the new German Republic as follows: Conclusion of an immediate peace; adherence to President•Wilson's program; refusal of \"a peace.of violence\"; restoration of the German colonies; immediate repatriation of German war prisoners; membership in the League of Nations on an equal basis; reciprocal general disarmament; abolition of secret diplomacy and creation of a democratic German army. Scheidemann has been prominent in political affairs in Germany since 1914, as the leader of the pro-war, pro-Kaiser wing of German social democracy. Born in Cassel in 1865 he enjoyed a high school education and became a printer and later a journalist. Since 1903 he has been a member of the Reichstag. Gustav Adolf Bauer, Minister of Labor, was one of the principal leaders of the German trade union movement and since 1912 has sat in the Reichstag. Otto Landsberg, Minister of National Defense and Justice, is a lawyer and since 1912 also has been a Socialist member of the Reichstag. Later in the week Dr. David re-signed the Presidency of the National Assembly to join the cabinet.

These changes are undoubtedly the result of Government financing and reflect in part withdrawals of Government funds from the banks. The loan item was reduced $53,087,000, net demand deposits $77,831,000, to $3,795,231,000 (Government deposits of $269,517,000 deducted), and net time deposits $3,062,000. Cash in vaults (members of the Federal Reserve Bank) increased $743,000 to $95,918,000 (not counted as reserve). The reserves in the Federal Reserve Bank of member banks, however, showed a reduction of $40,337,000 to $517,822,000. Reserves in own vaults (State banks and trust companies) increased $263,000 to $11,011,000, and in other depositories (State banks and trust companies) $57,000 to $11,284,000. In round numbers, the loss in aggregate reserves amounted to $40,017,000, thus bringing the total down to $540,117,000, as against $582,680,000 last year. There was a decline in reserve required of $10,201,330; hence the contraction in surplus was cut to $29,815,670, and excess reserves now stand at $37,401,720, comparing with $89,305,280 in the corresponding period of 1918. The surplus reserve totals here given are based in both cases on reserves of 13% for member banks of the Federal Reserve system, but not including cash held by these banks which last week was $95,918,000. More complete details of the bank statement will be found on a later page of this issue. With the exception of an advance to 6% in call money rates on mixed collateral and 63/2% on all industrial, shortly before the close of the Stock Exchange on Monday,again on Tuesday and Thursday, there was no break in the extreme dulness that has characterized the local money market for some weeks. These higher quotations were not taken seriously in Stock Exchange circles, although some brokers said on Thursday they had received intimations that money soon would be somewhat firmer, if not tight. At the moment there is nothing in the outlook on which the average observer could base such an expectation. Generally speaking, the advance was regarded as reflecting chiefly belated efforts on the part of Stock Exchange borrowers to get accommodations for the day. At the Peace Conference, however, special attention was directed from time to time throughout the week to the 'necessity of making money conditions a world affair and of taking definite action as early as possible on a plan for furnishing the capital needed by all the European countries directly involved in the war, for reconstruction purposes. Presumably France and Belgium are in the greatest need of funds. Some time must elapse before they can hope to realize on the indemnities that may finally be levied upon Germany. Now that the articles of the League of Nations have been adopted it is quite probable that the financial advisers of the Peace Conference will have a better opportunity to secure the attention of the commissioners to the plans on which they have been working for some weeks. Still, with President Wilson, Premiers Lloyd George and Orlando away, it is doubtful that final action can be secured from the conference as a body in the immediate future. Early in the week Seward Prosser, President of the Bankers Trust Co., was quoted in Chicago as having stressed the idea that the United States must prepare for 609 heavy demands for money from Europe, South America, and pretty much the whole world. Secretary Glass's request of Congress on Monday to increase the authorized, but unissued, amount of Liberty bonds for the forthcoming Victory Loan from $5,000,000,000 to $10,000,000,000, with discretionary powers as to rates of interest and other terms, and also for authority to issue not more than $10,000,000,000 interest-bearing, non-circulating notes, with maturities running from one to five years, were freely discussed and favorably received in the financial district. A high interest rate on the next issue,in comparison with that borne by previous ones, is expected. On Thursday the $6,000,000,000 Revenue Bill passed the Senate by a viva voce vote, with only slightly expressed opposition, and now awaits the signature of the President. Already the Treasury Department is putting into effect the machinery for collecting the taxes stipulated in the bill. Secretary Glass held conferences in New York yesterday and to-day with members of the Liberty Loan Committee and with other bankers. It is believed that before he goes back to Washington the general plan for floating the Victory Loan in April will be known in financial circles, if not made public. Our bankers appear to favor a division of the issue into taxable bonds carrying a high rate of interest and into another group with a low rate of interest and no taxes. Referring to money rates in greater detail, loans on call have ranged between 43/2@6% this week, comparing with 3%@5% a week ago. On Monday and Tuesday 6% was the highest, the low 432% and renewals at 5% on each day. Wednesday was a holiday (Lincoln's Birthday). Thursday 6% was still the maximum, though the minimum was advanced to 53/2%, which was also the basis for renewals. Friday's range was 5@532% and 5% the ruling rate. The above figures apply to mixed collateral loans, as all-industrials are still quoted at M of 1% higher. In time money a slightly firmer feeling developed, though this was shown more in a scarcity of funds than in any increase in rates. In view of the approach of the coming Victory Loan campaign, bankers are beginning to show an unwillingness to put out funds for fixed-date loans. Quotations were not changed from 5@53% for sixty and ninety days, with four, five and six months' money still at 53.%, but very little actual business was reported. At this time a year ago all maturities from sixty days to six months were quoted at 5M@6%. Mercantile paper has ruled quiet with only a moderate volume of business transacted. Rates remain as heretofore, with sixty and ninety days' endorsed bills receivable and six months' names of choice character at 5@53%, while names less well known still require 53'@,5%.

Sterling exchange requires very little comment this week, since rates are still pegged and transactions limited to the merest routine requirements. Attention continues to centre upon the doings at the Peace Conference, as market experts apparently all agree that no improvement in activity can be expected until the actual signing of the peace treaties. So far as can be learned, none of the modifications recently predicted,of the arbitrary control exercised by the Government have as yet been put into effect. A good deal of interest is taken in the fact that the initial Belgian loan recently announced is to take the form of a bank acceptance credit, which will be available for rediscount at the Federal Reserve banks. It is also announced that American bankers are to extend credits to France, which will be financed through the medium of acceptances, the latter for the purpose of purchasing raw materials in this country for use in restoring the devastated regions of France. Prominent New York banks are to participate in accepting these bills, but whether the banks of Belgium are to draw the bills is not yet definitely known. As regards quotations in detail, sterling exchange on Saturday ruled firm, but quiet; demand bills were a small fraction higher at 4 7580 @4 75 13-16, but cable transfers continued at 4 7655 5 Mon-@4 76 9-16 and sixty days at 4 73M@4 73%. day's trading was dull and featureless; variations in -rates were slight, though demand bills eased off to 4 7577M@4 7580 and cable transfers to 4 76523/ @4 7655; sixty days remained pegged at 4 7332@ 5 4 73%. Pre-holiday dulness marked Tuesday's operations, and the volume of business transacted was small; cable transfers were a trifle easier, declining fractionally to 4 76473/2@4 76523/ on an increase in offerings of sterling bills by London; no specific explanation of this development, however, was obtainable; demand bills were also lower at 4 75%@ 4 7580, but sixty day bills were unchanged. Wednesday was a holiday (Lincoln's Birthday). No increase in activity was noted at the resumption of business on Thursday, and trading was dull and nominal; quotations were practically unchanged at [VoL. 108. 4 75%@4 7580 for demand, 4 76 7-16@4 76523/ 2 for cable transfers, and 4 733@4 73% for sixty days. Friday's market ruled quiet and featureless and still unchanged. Closing quotations were 4 73% for sixty days, 4 75% for demand and 4 763/ for cable transfers. Commercial sight bills finished at 4 75 11-16, sixty days at 4 72%, ninety days at 4 71 7-16, documents for payment (sixty days) at 4 721 % and seven-day grain bills at 4 75. Cotton and grain for payment closed at 4 75 11-16. The gold exports reported for the week included $800,000 to South America, $75,000 to Mexico and $14,500 for Canada. There were no imports. The Continental exchanges have experienced another dull and uneventful week, with trading still of minimum proportions. It is plainly evident that leading international bankers are disinclined to enter into extensive commitments at a time when so many conflicting influences are at work to restrict normal commerce. Among these should be mentioned the shortage of ocean tonnage, the irregularity of freight rates, which is tending to interfere with a free movement of shipments, and the continued enforcement of certain export and import embargoes. Most of these uncertainties are likely to be removed with the signing of the peace treaties, but while it is conceded that important progress towards this end has been made, much work is still to be done. In the meantime, opinion in the best informed quarters is that rates for foreign exchange are not likely to vary widely from those now ruling for some little time to come. French exchange was well maintained, at or near last week's levels. Lire cables are still pegged at the official rates previously current, but checks were a shade easier, though without specific activity. The situation in ruble exchange remains the same and the quotation is a purely nominal affair. A cable recently received states that the Soviet Government of Russia intends to assume responsibility for obligations with the Entente, and this caused quite a sharp advance in Russian bonds and also in ruble currency notes. Itisstated, furthermore, that considerable speculation in rubles is going on in London, large supplies having been purchased at low figures in the Far East. The reason that such speculation is not transpiring at this centre is probably attributable to the rigid control exercised by the Federal Reserve Board over all exchange operations. Fred I. Kent, Director of the Division of Foreign Exchange, has issued a notice to the effect that \"dealers,\" until otherwise instructed, may make transfers of funds to persons not enemies or allies of enemies resident in all parts of Finland. Quotations for reichsmarks and kronen are not obtainable, as no business is being done at this centre in German and Austrian exchange. The official London check rate in Paris closed at 25.98 (unchanged). In New York sight bills on the French 5 cables at centre finished at 5 45%, against 5 45%; 5 453', against 5 45; commercial sight at 5 46%, against 5 469', and commercial sixty days at 5 519', % last week. Lire closed at 5 363/ 2 for against 5 513 bankers' sight bills, against 6 36 a week ago; cables were not changed from 6 35. Rubles remain as heretofore at 14 for checks and 15 for cables, nominally. Greek exchange has not been changed from 5 163/ for checks and 5 15 for cables. Belgian exchange is quoted nominally at 5 67 for checks and 5 65 for cables, the same as a week ago. FEB. 15 1919.] THE CHRONICLE No new feature of especial interest has been noted in neutral exchange this week. Much of the time so little business was passing that the market was almost at a complete standstill. As a result fluctuations in rates were relatively unimportant, with no definite trend in either direction. Swiss exchange was firmer, and this was attributed to an announcement that the Swiss Government has been permitted to arrange for definite cargo space for the shipment of supplies from the United States to Switzerland. Considerable interest was shown in the statement that in addition to the Belgian credit of $50,000,000 already granted, Denmark is now seeking a credit of about $15,000,000 in this country, ostensibly with a view of stabilizing the exchange situation between the United States and Denmark. Scandinavian rates were fairly steady. Guilders ruled a shade firmer, though Spanish pesetas were easier. Bankers' sight on Amsterdam closed at 41 1-16, against 411-16; cables at 41 5-16, against 41 5-16; commercial sight at 41 1-16, against 41, and commercial sixty days at 405 %, against 40 9-16 a week ago. Swiss exchange finished at 4 92 as compared with 4 95, and cables at 4 88 against 4 91 last week. Copenhagen checks closed at 25.90 and cables 26.10, against 26.00 and 26.20. Checks on Sweden finished at 27.95 and cables 28.15, against 28.10 and 28.30, while checks on Norway closed at 27.20 and cables at 27.40, against 27.20 and 27.50 the week before. Spanish pesetas finished at 20.11 for checks and 20.18 for cables. This compares with 20.12 and 20.20 the preceding week. As to South American quotations, the check rate on Argentina was lowered and closed at 44.50 and cables 44.65, against 44.85 and 45.00. For Brazil the rate for checks also declined and finished at 25.60 and cables 25.75, compared with 25.85 and 26.00 last week. The Chilian rate remains as heretofore at 10 7-16 and for Peru 50.125@50.375. Far Eastern rates are as follows: Hong Kong, 74.90 against 78@784; Shanghai, 114 against 123@ 1233; Yokohama, 52 against 523'@523'; Manila, 50 against 49%@50%; Singapore, 563 against 56%@566; Bombay, 36 against 363/2@369, and Calcutta (cables), 363 against 36%@37. The New York Clearing House banks, in their operations with interior banking institutions, have gained $3,425,000 net in cash as a result of the currency movements for the week ending Feb. 14. Their receipts from the interior have aggregated $7,674,000, while the shipments have reached $4,249,000. Adding the Sub-Treasury and Federal Reserve operations and the gold exports, which together occasioned a loss of $78,560,000, the combined result of the flow of money into and out of the New York banks for the week appears to have been a loss of $75,135,000, as follows: Week ending Feb. 14.

Two incidents of the past week have a direct bearing on what is in many respects the foremost political and economic problem of the day. Even in the early stages of the war no experienced observer of events had any doubt that the question of labor would be the matter of paramount complexity in the period following return of peace. In Europe the Labor Party was playing a highly important part in national politics, even before 1914; in England especially it came close to holding as an organized party the balance of power in Parliament. With the progress of the war, the drafting of ablebodied citizens into the armies and the insatiable demand for man power in the munitions factories, wages advanced with unprecedented rapidity. The advance was partly effect and partly cause of the equally violent rise in prices; but the extent of the double movement made it a matter of certainty that when the war was over, it would be no simple matter for wages to be lowered along with prices of manufactured goods and profits of manufacture. There were hundreds of thousands of skilled workmen who, both in Europe and America, were earning under the abnormal war conditions weekly pay which made the income of the average professional man look small. What was their attitude likely to be when the factitious demand which had put up their wages should suddenly disappear, and when industry should be confronted with the problem whether to lower wages in some proportion to the lowering of prices, or, as an unavoidable alternative, turn loose such masses of laborers as should crowd the ranks of the unemployed? In the present case, moreover, th,p possibility of a new and defiant attitude by labor—the possibility, in fact, of a revolutionary attitude—came into serious consideration as a consequence of events in Russia; where labor had seized not only the Government but the industrial plant, had driven out the owners and employers and had settled for itself its own wages and its own title to participation in the earnings of industry. Disastrous and chaotic as were the results of the Russian experiment, it was a moral certainty that to some extent—how great an extent no one could say beforehand—the mind of the labor class in other countries would be swept off its balance by the spectacle. The attempt to imitate Russia was at once tried in Germany. It failed; probably because of the instinctive recognition by the German people that, at the parting of the ways in which they stood, a Bolshevik revolution meant sure political and economic death. But this failure did not mean that other countries, in a different way, might not be confronted with the problem. As a matter of fact it came almost at once, even in.England and America. The strikes in Ireland and England during the past few weeks were of a peculiarly angry character. In nearly all of them, the characteristic fact was that work was stopped in violation of agreements previously entered into by the unions and which were still running. Usually the demand was for shorter hours, sometimes for higher wages; but in all cases the strike was begun against the remonstrance of the unions and in advance of any effort at Govern mental mediation. In some of them the specific 612 THE CHRONICLE demands were such as to make continued operation of the industry impossible, and the machinery of the sympathetic strike or the general strike was invoked. An even more outright challenge to the present economic regime was made in our own country at Seattle, long a hotbed of social and political experiment and of industrial unrest. The shipbuilders, having struck (in violation of their union's formal contract with the Government), called a\"sympathy strike\" of other industries,including even street car service and the janitor service in buildings. Intimidation followed. For a day or two industry, transportation and even the school work stopped, and the strikers, flushed with their apparent victory, began to talk of taking over industry as a whole and running it on their own terms. \"The sympathetic revolution,\" said the Mayor of Seattle, \"was called in the exact manner of the revolution in Petrograd.\" Fortunately,the public authorities did not hesitate. Mayor Hanson of Seattle, himself of foreign birth and Socialist affiliations, took up the challenge at once, refused the extreme demands Of the striking laborers, denounced the sympathetic strike, organized 1,000 armed extra police with instructions to use force against all disorder, and proclaimed that on the next day all business must go on as usual. And so it did. The attempted revolution which, the Mayor said, its authors \"expected to spread all over the United States\" in actual fact \"never got to first base, and it never will if the men in control of affairs will tell all traitors and anarchists that death will be their portion if they start anything.\" In rapid sequence came the announcement that 54 alien agitators at Seattle and Chicago were being deported from the country under the laws of the United States. In England, after transportation at London had been temporarily restored through recourse to motor lorries, the demonstration subsided and the strike in the subways ceased. It began to wane in other industries. Last Tuesday the British Premier, speaking in the House of Commons, warned labor against repetition of such excesses, explaining patiently the inexorable conditions under which the falling prices and profits of industry in the readjustment period would produce an alternative in which an increase of operating costs would lose the market for the manufacturers, so that instead of full employment at higher wages or shorter hours, labor would be confronted with inevitable unemployment and distress. But, after saying that \"thes e disturbances are promoting the very evils against which they are supposed to work,\" Lloyd George went on to say with directness and sternness: \"I know the perils, I know the dangers and I have deliberately reckoned carefully the cost, and I say' that if the people of this country are prepared to face both peril and cost with the courage, endurance and patience which they exhibited in the face of equally great menace, if all classes of the community are prepared to make the necessary sacrifices for the stability, security and freedom of the industries upon which the future of this land and the happiness of its people really depend, I am prepared to say, with full knowledge of the peril, that no section of the community, however powerful it may be, can be or will be allowed to hold up the whole nation.\" In America and England, therefore, the issue is squarely presented. We do not know what the further development of this Governmental policy will be, and we do not suppose that the efforts of [VoL. 108. agitators to undermine the industrial structure are ended. We may still have troublous times ahead of us. But the essential fact is that responsible government in both countries has asserted its rights at the start, has responded to threat with threat, and has thereby called forth an outburst of popular approval throughout the nation. This is our strong ground of assurance against any sequel resembling even remotely the conditions which arose in Russia, as a direct result of Kerensky's feeble surrender to one after another of the extravagant demands of labor—with the natural result of a labor revolution, a labor Government, a reign of terror by the dictators put in power by labor, and the complete collapse of productive industry, orderly politics and individual comfort or safety. TAKING THE WRONG ROAD TO PROSPERITY. The Chamber of Commerce of the United States, through its Federal Trade Committee, has formulated certain \"proposals\" touching trade that are to be submitted by referendum to various member bodies throughout the country. The proposals embody: A revision of all anti-trust laws now on the statute books; the formulation of \"standards of general. business conduct to be administered by a supervisory body,\" a statute making the Federal Trade Commission this supervisory body; and a provision increasing this Commmission from five to nine. It is to the second of these propositions we wish to address ourselves. There is little dispute anywhere as to the revision of the existing anti-trust laws. One statute in that direction has already been enacted. But many onerous restrictions on trade are yet to be removed. This second proposal is so general in its terms that we may be permitted general comment on the principles involved. And the first question is how can any Governmentally constructed body arrive at the proper \"standards of general business conduct?\" Is it to re-enact the Golden Rule? When we divide business by the convenient economic terms production, distribution and consumption (or use), a statute would have to be very broad indeed to set out standards of conduct that would apply equally to all. If we pass from morals to ethics and from ethics to economics and from economics to actual trade and commerce, just what \"supervision,\" what \"conduct\" can be in contemplation? It would seem, almost, that \"business\" is to be placed under a Federal body which will make its own \"standards\" whenever and wherever it pleases to assert itself. In the first place we have come to the point where we approach this whole matter of supervision from a hostile attitude. And we do not mean \"supervision\" (after the fact or during the process), we mean \"regulation\" (before the fact and according to preconceived ideas as to what should be done). Take the matter of buying and selling grain for future delivery and the \"settlements\" that ensue without actual delivery. Here the principle of compromise in the consummation of contracts can never be eliminated without a corresponding limitation on the freedom of conduct in business. And from the moment of \"production\" tb the last moment of \"use\" no undeviating line of conduct can be rigidly determined—for there is nowhere omniscience to perceive what condictions may arise. Our Government is even at this time \"canceling\" huge orders FEB. 15 1919.] THE CHRONICLE 613 confor supplies it does not now need.
