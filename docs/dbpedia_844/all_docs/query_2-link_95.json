The objective of the removal action is to prevent, to the extent practicable, the migration of ground water contaminated with chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCS) across the southwest boundary of Area C. The Phase 1, Volume 9 Removal Action System Design compiles the design documents prepared for the Phase II Removal Action. These documents, which are presented in Appendices to Volume 9, include: Process Design, which presents the 30 percent design for the ground water treatment system (GWTS); Design Packages 1 and 2 for Earthwork and Road Construction, and the Discharge Pipeline, respectively; no drawings are included in the appendix; Design Package 3 for installation of the Ground Water Extraction Well(s); Design Package 4 for installation of the Monitoring Well Instrumentation; and Design Package 5 for installation of the Ground Water Treatment System; this Design Package is incorporated by reference because of its size\n\n(Environmental investigation of ground water contamination at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio)\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\n1992-03-01\n\nAn environmental investigation of ground water conditions has been undertaken at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB), Ohio to obtain data to assist in the evaluation of a potential removal action to prevent, to the extent practicable, migration of the contaminated ground water across Base boundaries. Field investigations were limited to the central section of the southwestern boundary of Area C and the Springfield Pike boundary of Area B. Further, the study was limited to a maximum depth of 150 feet below grade. Three primary activities of the field investigation were: (1) installation of 22 monitoring wells, (2) collection and analysis of ground water from 71 locations, (3) measurement of ground water elevations at 69 locations. Volatile organic compounds including trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, and/or vinyl chloride were detected in concentrations exceeding Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCL) at three locations within the Area C investigation area. Ground water at the Springfield Pike boundary of Area B occurs in two primary units, separated by a thicker-than-expected clay layers.

The aquifer consists of glacial sands and gravels that fill a buried bedrock-valley system. Consolidated rocks in the area consist of poorly permeable Ordovician shale of the Richmondian stage, in the upland areas, the Brassfield Limestone of Silurian age. The valleys are filled with glacial sediments of Wisconsinan age consisting of clay-rich tills and coarse-grained outwash deposits. Estimates of hydraulic conductivity of the shales based on results of displacement/recovery tests range from 0.0016 to 12 feet per day; estimates for the glacial sediments range from less than 1 foot per day to more than 1,000 feet per day. Ground water flow from the uplands towards the valleys and the major rivers in the region, the Great Miami and the Mad Rivers. Hydraulic-head data indicate that ground water flows between the bedrock and unconsolidated deposits. Data from a gain/loss study of the Mad River System and hydrographs from nearby wells reveal that the reach of the river next to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is a ground-water discharge area. A steady-state, three-dimensional ground-water-flow model was developed to simulate ground-water flow in the region. The model contains three layers and encompasses about 100 square miles centered on Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Ground water enters the modeled area primarily by river leakage and underflow at the model boundary. Ground water exits the modeled area primarily by flow through the valleys at the model boundaries and through production wells. A model sensitivity analysis involving systematic changes in values of hydrologic parameters in the model indicates that the model is most sensitive to decreases in riverbed conductance and vertical conductance between the upper two layers. The analysis also indicates that the contribution of water to the buried-valley aquifer from the bedrock that forms the valley walls is about 2 to 4\n\n[Environmental investigation of ground water contamination at Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio].

The base was established in 1917 as a flight training center for the U.S. Army Air Service and in 1926 became home to its School of Aviation Medicine. The school moved to San Antonio's Randolph Field in 1931, but in 1959 it returned to Brooks where it occupied new facilities to support its role as a national center for U.S. Air Force aerospace medicine, including teaching, clinical medicine, and research. The mission was then expanded to encompass support of U.S. military and civilian space programs. With the abrupt termination of the military space program in 1969, research at Brooks focused on clinical aviation medicine and support of advanced military aircraft while continuing close cooperation with NASA in support of orbital spaceflight and the journey to the Moon. Reorganization in the 1990s assigned all research functions at Brooks to the Human Systems Division and its successors, leaving to USAFSAM the missions related to clinical work and teaching. In 2002 the USAF and the city of San Antonio implemented shared operation of Brooks as a \"City-Base\" in the hope of deflecting threatened closure. Nevertheless, under continuing pressure to consolidate military facilities in the United States, the 2005 Base Closure and Realignment Commission ordered Brooks closed by 2011, with its aerospace medicine functions relocated to new facilities at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, OH.\n\nQuantum Confined Semiconductors - In-House Interim Research\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2013-04-01\n\nLaboratory, Materials & Manufacturing Directorate, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7707, USA blnstituto de Ciencias Fisicas, Universidad Nacional Aut6noma...111is work was supported by the Ai1Â· Force Office of Scientific Research (AFRU RS E, Dr. Kitt Reinhardt). â¢ Also with lnstituto de Ciencias Fisicas\n\nAircraft Fire Sentry.

This survey was part of an effort to document background radiation levels around nuclear processing and handling facilities owned or contracted by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). Survey activities were conducted and performed by EG and G for the DOE. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base served as the survey base of operations. During the survey, gamma ray data were collected over a 12.3 km 2 area by flying an east-west grid of lines spaced 61 m apart, flying slowly over several selected areas, and hovering over several spots of interest. The processed data indicated that the on-site radioactivity was primarily due to radionuclides currently being handled or processed at the Facility, and that lesser activity could be attributed to previously handled or processed nuclear materials. Off-site data showed the radioactivity to be that only due to naturally occurring radionuclides\n\nEngineered Surfaces to Control Secondary Electron Yield for Multipactor Suppression\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2017-09-14\n\nAir Force Institute of Technology AFIT Scholar Theses and Dissertations 9-14-2017 Engineered Surfaces to Control Secondary Electron Yield for...Multipactor Suppression James M.

At the time of the F/A-18D(RC) ATARS option exercise, the design and development of the ATARS subsystems and the parameters of the F/A-18D(RC) were essentially fixed. ATARS is to be installed in the gun bay of the F/A-18D(RC), taking up no additional room, nor adding any more weight than what was removed. The F/A-18D(RC) installation solution required innovations in mounting, cooling, and fit techniques, which made constant trade study essential. The successful installation in the F/A-18D(RC) is the result of coupling fundamental design engineering with brainstorming and nonstandard approaches to every situation. ATARS is sponsored by the Aeronautical Systems Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. The F/A-18D(RC) installation is being funded to the Air Force by the Naval Air Systems Command, Washington, D.C.\n\nInteraction of Jet Fuel Hydrocarbon Components with Red Blood Cells and Hemoglobin\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2014-06-24\n\nDirectorate (RHDJ), Wright-Patterson AFB, OH.

The Space Power Subsystem program (SPSS) contains the necessary equations and algorithms to calculate photovoltaic array power performance, including end-of-life (EOL) and beginning-of-life (BOL) specific power (W/kg) and areal power density (W/m 2 ). Additional equations and algorithms are included in the spreadsheet for determining maximum eclipse time as a function of orbital altitude, and inclination. The Space Power Subsystem Sizing program (SPSS) has been used to determine the performance of several candidate power subsystems for both Air Force and SDIO potential applications. Trade-offs have been made between subsystem weight and areal power density (W/m 2 ) as influenced by orbital high energy particle flux and time in orbit\n\nWright-Fisher diffusion bridges.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGriffiths, Robert C; Jenkins, Paul A; SpanÃ², Dario\n\n2017-10-06\n\nThe trajectory of the frequency of an allele which begins at x at time 0 and is known to have frequency z at time T can be modelled by the bridge process of the Wright-Fisher diffusion. Bridges when x=z=0 are particularly interesting because they model the trajectory of the frequency of an allele which appears at a time, then is lost by random drift or mutation after a time T. The coalescent genealogy back in time of a population in a neutral Wright-Fisher diffusion process is well understood. In this paper we obtain a new interpretation of the coalescent genealogy of the population in a bridge from a time tâ(0,T). In a bridge with allele frequencies of 0 at times 0 and T the coalescence structure is that the population coalesces in two directions from t to 0 and t to T such that there is just one lineage of the allele under consideration at times 0 and T. The genealogy in Wright-Fisher diffusion bridges with selection is more complex than in the neutral model, but still with the property of the population branching and coalescing in two directions from time tâ(0,T). The density of the frequency of an allele at time t is expressed in a way that shows coalescence in the two directions. A new algorithm for exact simulation of a neutral Wright-Fisher bridge is derived. This follows from knowing the density of the frequency in a bridge and exact simulation from the Wright-Fisher diffusion. The genealogy of the neutral Wright-Fisher bridge is also modelled by branching PÃ³lya urns, extending a representation in a Wright-Fisher diffusion. This is a new very interesting representation that relates Wright-Fisher bridges to classical urn models in a Bayesian setting. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The oriented molecule is positioned using the fast translation function Ï 0 , which is based on the automated interpretation of Ï projections using the sum function. This strategy reduces the number of Patterson-function values to be stored in the rotation search, and the use of the Ï 0 function minimizes the required time for the development of all probable rotation search solutions. The application of this method to five representative test examples is shown.

It covers a 20-year period of methodological contributions to crystal structure solution, most of them published in Acta Crystallographica Section A. The common feature of these variants of direct methods is the introduction of the experimental intensities in the form of the Fourier coefficients of origin-free Patterson-type functions, which allows the active use of both strong and weak reflections. The different optimization algorithms are discussed and their performances compared.

The common feature of these variants of direct methods is the introduction of the experimental intensities in the form of the Fourier coefficients of origin-free Patterson-type functions, which allows the active use of both strong and weak reflections. The different optimization algorithms are discussed and their performances compared. This review focuses not only on those PFDM applications related to powder diffraction data but also on some recent results obtained with electron diffraction tomography data.\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright in the Soviet Union\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBrian A. Spencer\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available In 1937 the First All-Union Congress of Soviet Architects was held in Moscow. The congress broughtÂ architects from all areas of theÂ Soviet Union. Under the auspices of Vsesoiuvnoe Obshchestvo Kul'turnoi Sviazi s zagranitsei (VOKS it invited international architects from Europe and North and South America.Â The Organizing Committee of the Union of Soviet Architects invited Frank Lloyd Wright from the United States. Frank Lloyd Wright presented his philosophy and exhibited his work, specifically his designs for the weekend home for E. J. Kaufmann \"Fallingwater\" and the drawings for the S.C. Johnson Administration. Frank Lloyd Wright's presentation did not focus heavily on the architecture but, rather the spirit of the Russian and Soviet vision.\n\nSir Almroth Wright: pioneer immunologist.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nEllis, Harold\n\n2011-03-01\n\nThis year marks the 150th anniversary of the birth of Almroth Edward Wright, whose pioneer work in immunology saved countless lives, especially in the First World War, but whose name and work are all but forgotten today. Wright was born in 1861 in Middleton Tyas, Yorkshire, where his father, an Irish protestant and considerable Hebrew scholar, was the minister. Almroth's Swedish mother, the daughter of NW Almroth, governor of the mint in Stockholm, was responsible for his unusual first name. She had the rare distinction of having served as a nurse with Florence Nightingale in the hospital at Scutari in the Crimean War.\n\nJames Homer Wright: a biography of the enigmatic creator of the Wright stain on the occasion of its centennial.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLee, Robert E; Young, Robert H; Castleman, Benjamin\n\n2002-01-01\n\nJames Homer Wright (1869-1928), the eldest son of a Pittsburgh glass merchant, was educated in Baltimore and practiced pathology in Boston from 1893 until his death in 1928. In 1896, when not quite 27 years old, he assumed directorship of the newly founded Pathology Laboratory at the Massachusetts General Hospital, a post he held for the next 30 years. He is remembered eponymously by the blood cell stain that bears his name and the Homer Wright pseudorosettes of neuroblastoma, but he made many additional contributions to pathology. These include the following: determination of the cellular lineage of multiple myeloma, identification of the megakaryocyte as the cell of origin of blood platelets, recognition of the cell of origin of the neuroblastoma, demonstration of spirochetes in syphilitic aneurysms of the aorta, and clarification of misconceptions about actinomycosis. Additionally, Wright coauthored, with Dr. Frank B. Mallory, the book Pathological Technique, which was a staple of laboratories for >40 years and exemplifies Wright's wide-ranging interests in, and contributions to, practical aspects of pathology including staining, culture and frozen section techniques, photography, and development of the rotary microtome. He received Honorary Doctor of Science Degrees from Harvard University, the University of Maryland (his alma mater), and the University of Missouri. He was the recipient of the Gross prize in 1905 for his publication on actinomycosis and the Boylston Medical Prize in 1908 for his discovery of the origin of platelets, and he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1915. Although shy and somewhat austere in the workplace, a different side was shown by his anonymously sending flowers to a young Norwegian opera singer whom he subsequently married. The pathology laboratories of the Massachusetts General Hospital were named the \"James Homer Wright Pathology Laboratories\" in 1956. Today James Homer Wright is remembered and\n\nBecause Everyone Has a Story to Tell: Interview with Andrew Wright\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFloris, Flora Debora\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis article presents an interview with Andrew Wright, a widely recognized author, illustrator, storyteller, and teacher trainer.

His career began at theend of the 19th century, during the great architectural boom inChicago, under the mentorship of Louis Henry Sullivan, fromwhom he adopted and then perfected the concepts of organicarchitecture and the Prairie house. During the Depressionyears, Wright developed a cheaper and simpler variant of thePrairie house: the Usonian house.Wright's architecture is characterised by an entirely newapproach to building design, particularly the design of houses.He reduced the number of rooms by combining their functionsin a large living space with a central fireplace. He used largeglazed areas to connect the external environment of the housewith the interior. The natural environment of the prairie wasthe inspiration for the horizontal lines that characterised hisarchitecture. His buildings are low in height, close to humanscale and with a great feeling for the natural setting in whichthey are built. He selected materials from the surroundingarea and the principal decoration of his architecture was thenatural structure of the material.The paper presents the ideas of organic architecture, thePrairie house, the Usonian house, along with the best examplesof Wright's architecture and the criteria he employed in theselection of materials and construction technologies. Theenvironmental aspect of his philosophy of the use of materialsis considered in the discussion section.Wright may be considered a pioneer of sustainable architecture.\n\nAFOSR/ONR (Air Force Office of Scientific Research/Office of Naval Research) Contractors’ Meeting - Combustion Rocket Propulsion Diagnostics of Reacting Flow Held in Ann Arbor, Michigan on June 19-23, 1989\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n1989-06-19\n\nsince S and dm/dt can be determined from the combined light scattering aid velocity measure- ments.

In 1953, the result published by Patterson (4.55 Â± 0.07)*10 9 y was the first correct estimation of the age of the earth. His approach is based on the idea that the isotopic composition of meteorites can give information on the origin of the solar system. He assumed that meteorites and earth were formed at the same time and from a common homogeneous material (in terms of lead and uranium isotopic compositions). Patterson determined the isotopic lead composition of meteorite samples and inferred the age of the earth. The first part of the article gives the kinetics equations of Pb 206 and Pb 207 , these 2 lead isotopes were present originally and have been created since through the decay of U 238 and U 235 respectively. The second part present the application to experimental data from 5 meteorite samples. A conclusion is drawn that highlights the limits of the method: the measurement of the lead composition of the samples is very delicate to do because the meteorites contain very low amounts of lead (about 1 ppm) and the crossing of the atmosphere could have contaminated them with lead from humane activities.

Patterson analysis of diffuse x-ray scattering data\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKobas, Miroslav; Weber, Thomas; Steurer, Walter\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe three-dimensional (3D) difference Patterson (autocorrelation) function of a disordered quasicrystal (Edagawa phase) has been analyzed. 3D diffuse x-ray diffraction data were collected in situ at 300, 1070, and 1120 K. A method, the punch-and-fill technique, has been developed for separating diffuse scattering and Bragg reflections. Its potential and limits are discussed in detail. The different Patterson maps are interpreted in terms of intercluster correlations as a function of temperature. Both at high and low temperatures, the clusters decorate the vertices of the same quasiperiodic covering. At low temperatures, for the disordered part of the structure, short-range intercluster correlations are present, whereas at higher temperatures, medium-range intercluster correlations are formed. This indicates disorder mainly inside clusters at low temperatures, whereas at higher temperatures disorder takes place inside larger superclusters. Qualitatively, the Patterson maps may be interpreted by intercluster correlations mainly inside pentagonal superclusters below 1120 K, and inside the larger decagonal superclusters at 1120 K. The results of our diffraction study are published in two parts. Part I focuses on the 3D Patterson analysis based on experimental data, Part II reports modeling of structural disorder in decagonal Al-Co-Ni\n\nOverdose Deaths Related to Fentanyl and Its Analogs - Ohio, January-February 2017.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDaniulaityte, Raminta; Juhascik, Matthew P; Strayer, Kraig E; Sizemore, Ioana E; Harshbarger, Kent E; Antonides, Heather M; Carlson, Robert R\n\n2017-09-01\n\nOhio is experiencing unprecedented loss of life caused by unintentional drug overdoses (1), with illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF) emerging as a significant threat to public health (2,3). IMF is structurally similar to pharmaceutical fentanyl, but is produced in clandestine laboratories and includes fentanyl analogs that display wide variability in potency (2); variations in chemical composition of these drugs make detection more difficult. During 2010-2015, unintentional drug overdose deaths in Ohio increased 98%, from 1,544 to 3,050.* In Montgomery County (county seat: Dayton), one of the epicenters of the opioid epidemic in the state, unintentional drug overdose deaths increased 40% in 1 year, from 249 in 2015 to 349 in 2016 (estimated unadjusted mortality rateÂ =Â 57.7 per 100,000) (4). IMFs have not been part of routine toxicology testing at the coroner's offices and other types of medical and criminal justice settings across the country (2,3). Thus, data on IMF test results in the current outbreak have been limited. The Wright State University and the Montgomery County Coroner's Office/Miami Valley Regional Crime Laboratory (MCCO/MVRCL) collaborated on a National Institutes of Health study of fentanyl analogs and metabolites and other drugs identified in 281 unintentional overdose fatalities in 24 Ohio counties during January-February 2017. Approximately 90% of all decedents tested positive for fentanyl, 48% for acryl fentanyl, 31% for furanyl fentanyl, and 8% for carfentanil. Pharmaceutical opioids were identified in 23% of cases, and heroin in 6%, with higher proportions of heroin-related deaths in Appalachian counties. The majority of decedents tested positive for more than one type of fentanyl. Evidence suggests the growing role of IMFs, and the declining presence of heroin and pharmaceutical opioids in unintentional overdose fatalities, compared with 2014-2016 data from Ohio and other states (3-5). There is a need to include testing for IMFs as part\n\nThe Seated Soldier Study: Posture and Body Shape in Vehicle Seats\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2013-10-31\n\nlasers in four towers arranged in a square create a line on the subject as they move synchronously from top to bottom.

Wright's organic designs originated from a material-based grid, which at the same time organized and provided freedom to create spaces and forms. This study reviews Wright's work, from his first Midwest designs that relied on brick, through an intermediary phase in California when he made intense use of concrete blocks, until his last phase, the usonian houses, which featured wood paneling. During his early career, the concept and the methodology of Wright's ideas greatly contributed to a better understanding of his architecture, his apprentices and his followers. The economy and rationalization found in the projects reviewed are of great importance as the analysis of historical proposals helps us understand the topic in question.\n\n75 FR 80669 - Wright Brothers Day, 2010\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-12-22\n\n... curious minds eager to transform and advance the world around them.

In November 2006, Ohio implemented a comprehensive statewide smoke-free law for all indoor workplaces. A feasible generalised least squares (FLGS) time series design to estimate the impact of the Ohio smoke-free law on Kentucky and Ohio border counties. Six Kentucky and six Ohio counties that lie on the border between the two states. All reporting hospitality and accommodation establishments in all Kentucky and Ohio counties including but not limited to food and drinking establishments, hotels and casinos. Total number of employees, total wages paid and number of reported establishments in all hospitality and accommodation services, 6 years before Ohio's law and 1 year after. There is no evidence of a disproportionate change in economic activity in Ohio or Kentucky border counties relative to their non-border counterparts. There was no evidence of a relation between Ohio's smoke-free law and economic activity in Kentucky border counties. The law generated a positive influence on wages and number of establishments in Ohio border counties. The null result cannot be explained by low test power, as minimum changes necessary in the dependent variables to detect a significant influence are very reasonable in size. Our data add to the large body of evidence that smoke-free laws are neutral with respect to the hospitality business across jurisdictions with and without laws.\n\n75 FR 65572 - Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Ohio; Ohio Ambient Air Quality...\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-10-26\n\n...

The thermal loads for hypersonic vehicles will be no exception. In fact, with their projected high heat loads and fluxes, hypersonic vehicles are a prime example of systems that will require thermal management systems (TMS) that have been optimized and integrated with the entire vehicle to the maximum extent possible during the initial design stages. This will not only be to meet operational requirements, but also to fulfill weight and performance constraints in order for the vehicle to takeoff and complete its mission successfully. To meet this challenge, the TMS can no longer be two or more entirely independent systems, nor can thermal management be an after thought in the design process, the typical pervasive approach in the past. Instead, a TMS that was integrated throughout the entire vehicle and subsequently optimized will be required. To accomplish this, a method that iteratively optimizes the TMS throughout the vehicle will not only be highly desirable, but advantageous in order to reduce the manhours normally required to conduct the necessary tradeoff studies and comparisons. A thermal management engineering computer code that is under development and being managed at Wright Laboratory, Wright-Patterson AFB, is discussed. The primary goal of the code is to aid in the development of a hypersonic vehicle TMS that has been optimized and integrated on a total vehicle basis.\n\nDemographic monitoring of Wright fishhook cactus\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRonald J.

It is therefore important to develop fast and accurate simulation methods for general population genetics models. Here we present an exact simulation method that generates trajectories of an allele×³s frequency in a finite population, as described by a general Wright-Fisher model. The method generates conditioned trajectories that start from a known frequency at a known time, and which achieve a specific final frequency at a known final time. The simulation method applies irrespective of the smallness of the probability of the transition between the initial and final states, because it is not based on rejection of trajectories. We illustrate the method on several different populations where a Wright-Fisher model (or related) applies, namely (i) a locus with 2 alleles, that is subject to selection and mutation; (ii) a locus with 3 alleles, that is subject to selection; (iii) a locus in a metapopulation consisting of two subpopulations of finite size, that are subject to selection and migration. The simulation method allows the generation of conditioned trajectories that can be used for the purposes of visualisation, the estimation of summary statistics, and the development/testing of new inferential methods. The simulated trajectories provide a very simple approach to estimating quantities that cannot easily be expressed in terms of the transition matrix, and can be applied to finite Markov chains other than the Wright-Fisher model.

The work scope was divided into two categories - (a) experimental program to pretreat and refine a coal derived syncrude sample to meet transportation fuels requirements; (b) system analysis of a commercial scale direct coal liquefaction facility. The coal syncrude was derived from a bituminous coal by Headwaters CTL, while the refining study was carried out under a subcontract to Axens North America. The system analysis included H{sub 2} production cost via six different options, conceptual process design, utilities requirements, CO{sub 2} emission and overall plant economy. As part of the system analysis, impact of various H{sub 2} production options was evaluated. For consistence the comparison was carried out using the DOE H2A model. However, assumptions in the model were updated using Headwaters database. Results of Tier 2 jet fuel specifications evaluation by the Fuels & Energy Branch, US Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/RZPF) located at Wright Patterson Air Force Base (Ohio) are also discussed in this report.\n\nAward for Distinguished Contributions to Research in Public Policy: Charlotte J.

Current proofs of convergence of WF and other models to the Kingman coalescent assume a constant sample size. However, sample sizes have become quite large in human genetics. Therefore, we develop a convergence theory that allows the sample size to increase with population size. If the haploid population size is N and the sample size is N 1â3-Ïµ , Ïµ>0, we prove that Wright-Fisher genealogies involve at most a single binary merger in each generation with probability converging to 1 in the limit of large N. Single binary merger or no merger in each generation of the genealogy implies that the Kingman partition distribution is obtained exactly. If the sample size is N 1â2-Ïµ , Wright-Fisher genealogies may involve simultaneous binary mergers in a single generation but do not involve triple mergers in the large N limit. The asymptotic theory is verified using numerical calculations. Variable population sizes are handled algorithmically. It is found that even distant bottlenecks can increase the probability of triple mergers as well as simultaneous binary mergers in WF genealogies. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This prediction has always proved accurate. Accordingly, the first Intel processor produced in 1975 was equipped with 2,300 transistors whereas the latest edition has 55 million. Today we have this extraordinary process of miniaturisation to thank for cell phones, computers and other, ever more compact electronic marvels. But where will the miniaturisation race end? What will happen when electronic etchings reach the size of an atom? These questions are on the programme of the 10th Wright Science Colloquia from 18 to 22 November. Five world-renowned specialists will explain to the general public the saga of miniaturisation. The Wright Colloquia take place every two years in Geneva and aim to inform the general public about the latest advances in science.
