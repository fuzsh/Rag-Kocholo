        "text": "Hey you all, I traded someone props and I received a 72\" Sensenich 3 blade H series. Which Jr Jurnigan said is a Great prop.. The problem is the 3 blades are for reverse rotation for a gear box. When I lay it flat with their label facing me the nickle edge is on the right side instead of the left side.\n\nHere's my question, does anybody know someone that needs a reverse rotation blades and willing to trade for left rotation either H series or Q series?\n\nThanks in advance for reading this post and any help you all can provide.\n\nAll the Best,\n\nMike\n\nBy the way Goldhunter I just pulled out my blades and the ladles are very hard to read the read inc has either faded or has been washed off. However one of them I can read somewhat and I don't see the L72H anywhere. I see a little of the torque info and the 1,2,3 It does say something about if you use lock washers to add 10 lbs of torque is this correct???????\n\nThanks again everyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :wink:\n\nAll the Best,\n\nMike\n\nYes you have it right. Curved (LABEL) side of blade to the front flat side of blade to the back. The area that you will find the label that goldhunter2 was talking about is at the base of the blade that goes in the hub. The label you were looking at is just a reference tag. the 1,2,3 is your starting points to get the prop set. Torque all your bolts to 60 lbs. Use anti seize on ALL bolts. Do yourself a favor and go to sears and get yourself one of those 6\" digital levels. They go for about 35 bucks. You'll be glad ya did. When you adjust your prop make sure you do all three blades the same. Adjust 1 blade, rotate engine bring next blade to same location adjust it, rotate engine and adjust the 3 rd blade. Then do it again to see if any of the blades moved on ya. if not torque it down to 60 lbs. I dont level out my boat or engine. I just level out each blade before adjusting and make sure they all have the same degree. Run it up and see what your RPM's are. You usually pick up 50 RPM's on the water then what it was on the trailer so keep that in mind. 1 degree in Pitch is about 150 RPM's,so you can use that as a guide if ya have to re-adjust.\n\nGood Luck and remember it's all common sense. Hope that didn't Offend anyone."
