        "text": "U.S. Prestige High in India An Indian missionary visiting the United States to study family planning says Americans worry too much about what other nations think of them. Dr. Maria Selvanayagam feels that despite Communist propaganda, the United States is thought of favorably in her native country. However, the missionary doctor, a guest of Mr .\n\nand Mrs. Raymond Todd, 136 E. Roseville believes wealthy American tourists create a bad impression, allowing Indians to think the United States as \"all rich people.\" A medical missionary with a masters degree from the Harvard School of Public Health, Dr. Selvanayagam spent three years in the United States when she first received her degree in 1952. She has established a public medical Health Center in her native village financial support of the Methodist Mission .\n\n50 PATIENTS A DAY The Center has a generator to supply the only electricity in the village, and she treats about 50 patients daily, many of them charity cases. Her duties include healing, schooling, and preaching to patients. The doctor spends her mornings at the Center and her afternoons visiting local people, giving spiritual and medical aid. Her transportation is a jeep given the Center by the Mission. INDIANS ARE RELIGIOUS Dr .\n\nSelvanayagam feels her people are religious, \"perhaps more than Americans. You have opportunities for religious advancement but don't use them.\" The dark, slender woman speaks with no malice, however, as her smile and pleasant personality attest. She wears a Sari, the dress of nearly all Indian women. On her present visit to United States, she will tour the country, speaking at various churches, clubs, and conferences. At the same time she will be learning for her people about birth control and other aspects of family planning .\n\nHaving grown accustomed to American ways, Dr. Selvanayagam now enjoys classical music and would like very much to own a record player, although she will have to wait until the Indian government builds the hydro-electric plants which will bring electricity to village. The doctor will be guest at a lawn party at St. Paul's Methodist Parsonage Saturday at 7:30 p.m. Ralph Dowhower Dies Suddenly Ralph Dowhower, sixty-three, 25 W .\n\nLiberty died suddenly early today at his home of a heart attack.
