        "text": "With the weight restrictions imposed on light sport aircraft in mind, Sensenich Propeller Co., which has manufactured wood and metal propellers since the 1930's, just released a lightweight composite aircraft propeller designed for 100- to 120-hp engines. A 70-inch diameter, two-blade propeller is currently available for the Rotax 914 series, Jabiru 2200 and 3300, and Subaru engines. The one-piece, hollow blades are constructed using an internal pressure molded system producing strong, durable, lightweight props that have been rigorously tested in the airboat market for the past five years. The research and development process also included in-flight vibration surveys using FAA type certified procedures.\n\nProp Model 2S0R70Q (P/N 05-01608) has a blade diameter of 2 @ 70\" (maximum propeller diameter: 70\" minimum propeller diameter: 66\") with no leading edge protection.\n\nProp Model 2S0R70Q-N (P/N 05-01609) has a blade diameter of 2 @ 70\" (maximum propeller diameter: 70\" minimum propeller diameter: 66\") with nickle leading edge protection.\n\nNotes: Blade cut-down allow for range of propeller diameters. Minimum propeller diameter achieved by trimming each blade tip by maximum cut-down.\n\nGo to Propeller Ordering Requirements Form\n\nDownload Propeller Extension Form"
