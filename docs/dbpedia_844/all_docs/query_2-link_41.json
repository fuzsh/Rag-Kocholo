Because of over-admittance,\n\nmany students were notified during the summer that they would be\n\nsharing a room with two other people. Many chose to seek off-\n\ncampus housing rather than face the inconvenience that a three-to-\n\na-room situation would cause. Those forced to comply were offered a\n\nreturn of 1/3 of their room rent by the housing office.

He noted that\n\nthis policy, along with the previous\n\nhousing guarantee with returning stu-\n\ndents, caused the major conflict that\n\nleft so many of East CarolinaTs stu-\n\ndents un-housed. The situation just\n\ngot blown out of proportion,? Wooten\n\ncommented.\n\nWith obligations to more students\n\nthan they could adequately provide\n\nfor, the housing office rushed to make\n\nhousing arrangements for 257 room-\n\nless students. As previously done, stu-\n\ndents were assigned to the vacant hos-\n\npital rooms in the infirmary. But there\n\nwas still need for additional rooms\n\nand the housing office used the Blox-\n\nton House, currently the Career Place-\n\nment and Planning Center. With all\n\nknown vacancies occupied, the uni-\n\nversity had to go to extremes and place\n\na third person in many of the rooms\n\nof Jones, Clement, White, and Greene\n\ndormitories.\n\nThe whole situation gave question\n\nto the need of additional on-campus\n\nhousing. Wooten said that the univer-\n\nsity had investigated this need and\n\nwas uncertain whether the 1 to 142%\n\ngrowth, rate predicted by the institu-\n\ntional research office adequately justi-\n\nfied new construction. He said that if\n\nthe idea were conceivable and plan-\n\nning was immediately started, it\n\nwould take three to five years before\n\nthe money would be available for the\n\nconstruction of a new dormitory. Be-\n\nsides being timely, the new dorm\n\nwould require more money than the\n\nfund raising could provide, causing an\n\nextremely high rent increase for all\n\ncampus-housed students \" an in-\n\ncrease Wooten predicted students\n\nwould not support.\n\nLeft: The hot August weather made moving ina\n\ntedious, drawn-out procedure and students took\n\nadvantage of reacquainting themselves with old\n\nfriends whenever the opportunity arose. Above\n\nRight: With the newly paved parking lots com-\n\npleted, more students were guaranteed on-cam-\n\npus parking \" a privilege which cost each stu-\n\ndent twenty-five dollars for the 1980-81 school\n\nyear.

My room rent was as\n\nhigh as everyone elses and I resented being cramped.?\n\n-Wyvonia Sutton, freshman\n\nNo room\n\nto SWeEG? oon.\n\nThe Housing Operations Office\n\nwas forced to readjust many long\n\nstanding housing policies as a result\n\nof the situation that occurred in the\n\nfall. For all freshmen and sopho-\n\nmores, the previous policy requiring\n\non-campus residence was completely\n\ndropped in hopes of providing addi-\n\ntional space within the dorms. In ad-\n\ndition, the procedures followed dur-\n\ning spring semester for signing up re-\n\nturning students were adopted. Stu-\n\ndents were faced with earlier room-\n\ndeposit dates and a shorter sign-up\n\nperiod. Freshmen were also given an\n\nearlier cut-off date for sending in\n\nhousing contracts.\n\nThe earlier sign-up date for return-\n\ning students allowed the university to\n\ndetermine the exact number of rooms\n\navailable to incoming freshmen and\n\ntransfer students. By strictly enforc-\n\ning the cut-off date for freshmen\n\nhousing contracts, the university re-\n\nleased itself from any housing obliga-\n\ntions to those students failing to meet\n\nthe specified deadline. Wooten com-\n\nmented that these newly adopted poli-\n\ncies would allow East Carolina more\n\ntime to evaluate the housing situation,\n\nmaking things easier for both the uni-\n\nversity and the students if indeed a\n\nhousing problem did reoccur in the\n\nfall of 1981.\n\nBelow: The Student Supply Store hired extra\n\nstudent help during the first weeks of school to\n\naccomodate the rush of students buying re-\n\nquired textbooks.

Though previous studies\n\nhave focused on the types of dates,\n\ndesired characterists of dating part-\n\nners and premarital sexual behaviors,\n\na study done by Dr. David Knox and\n\nKenneth Wilson, professor and assis-\n\ntant professor, respectively, in the\n\nECU Department of Sociology fo-\n\ncused on other aspects of dating. In\n\naddition to how students meet, we\n\nwere concerned about where they go,\n\nwhat they talk about, and how much\n\nsex they expect how soon, or how late,\n\nin their dating experiences,? com-\n\nmented Dr. Knox. The students were\n\nalso asked about their parentsT in-\n\nvolvement in their dating relation-\n\nships and what they felt about such\n\ninvolvement.\n\nThough many students mentioned\n\nparties, classes and work as ways of\n\nmeeting their dates, 33 percent re-\n\nvealed that friends had introduced\n\ndents enjoyed the music of several area groups\n\nduring the Battle of the Bands.

Going downtown dancing or to\n\none of the bars was rarely mentioned\n\nas a dating behavior. For those stu-\n\ndents not able to afford an extended\n\nevening, dinner out and then return-\n\ning to the dorm room or apartment\n\nseemed to be the favored activity.\n\nThe students were asked questions\n\nregarding their opinions on kissing,\n\npetting and intercourse. ECU students\n\nseemed to regard kissing favorably,\n\nand 14 percent of both sexes felt that\n\nno dates were necessary for kissing to\n\noccur.\n\nWhile half of the women and 70\n\npercent of the men felt kissing should\n\noccur on the first date, only three per-\n\ncent of the women felt that kissing\n\nwas appropriate only after the fourth\n\ndate.\n\nGracie Wells, a senior political sci-\n\nence major who agreed with the re-\n\nsults, commented, Kissing is a way\n\nin which we show our affection for\n\none another. The art of kissing is as\n\nunique as we are individuals and I see\n\nno harm in kissing someone I have\n\njust met.?\n\nI feel petting should take place\n\nafter two individuals have gotten to\n\nknow each other and feel comfortable\n\nwith each otherTs ideals and morals,?\n\nsaid Ken McLawhorn, a sophomore\n\nfrom Durham, NC. Most students\n\nshowed more concern that petting\n\n(hands anywhere) be delayed. Women\n\nwere more inclined to agree with this\n\nposition and almost three-fourths of\n\nthem felt it should be delayed until\n\nafter the fourth date. Thirty-one per-\n\ncent of the men, on the other hand,\n\nfelt that petting was appropriate on or\n\nbefore the first date.\n\nSexual intercourse was viewed as\n\ninappropriate too early in the dating\n\nStudent Life\n\nrelationship. Referring to the high\n\npercentage of students that felt inter-\n\ncourse was inappropriate within the\n\nfirst few dates, Brigid Findly, a junior\n\nfrom Fayetteville, said, I feel that it is\n\ntoo soon of a time for intercourse to\n\ntake place. I donTt think you really\n\nknow a person that well in such a\n\nshort time. Emotionally speaking, |\n\nthink itTs still probable infatuation.?\n\nSixty-nine percent of ECUTs women\n\nand fifty-two percent of the men felt\n\nthat six or more dates should occur\n\nbefore intercourse takes place. And\n\nwhile 14 percent of the women felt\n\nthat intercourse was appropriate on or\n\nbefore the third date, 36 percent of the\n\nmen felt that way, making it evident\n\nthat many men desire sexual inter-\n\ncourse sooner.\n\nWhen it came time to expressing\n\nthe desire for sexual intimacy, the ma-\n\njority of the students felt that open-\n\nness about sexual desires and expecta-\n\ntions was very important. I get the\n\nissue up front,? said one student. I\n\nsimply say that I want to make love.?\n\nBut not all students use as open an\n\napproach and many reported using\n\ntactics such as creating an atmo-\n\nsphere? (music, candles, etc.), ex-\n\npressing love,? moving closer to? or\n\nhinting? to let their dates know they\n\nwere ready for a higher degree of sex-\n\nual intimacy. Women were less direct\n\nthan men in expressing these desires\n\nand the majority favored the latter two\n\napproaches rather than direct commu-\n\nnication.\n\nThe students used directness in dis-\n\ncouraging sexual intimacy. A simply\n\nstated no? was the way one-third of\n\nthe men and half of the women\n\nstopped behavior they viewed as inap-\n\npropriate.

She meets a Home-\n\ntown boy, now a sailor, with desires to\n\nbecome a songwriter.

This serious drama, di-\n\nrected by Cedric Winchell, shows the\n\nconsequences of the average young\n\nAmerican male, thrown into a con-\n\nscriptive military situation in which\n\nindividual worth is totally ignored.\n\nThe main issue within the play con-\n\ncerns the internal conflicts of five\n\ndraftees \" their failure to live up to\n\nan image of heroism and their inabil-\n\nPatterson\n\nity to cope with that failure. Other\n\nissues are race, impersonality, homo-\n\nsexuality, and brutality.\n\nThe scene of the drama takes place\n\nin a barracks shared by three of the\n\ndraftees \" Roger, Richie, and Billy.\n\nRoger, a bebopping black boy, was\n\nplayed by Keith Guillory. Richie, a\n\nhomosexual who touches everyone on\n\nthe shoulder, was played by Donald\n\nWagoner. Scott Rodger portrayed Bil-\n\nly, a young intellectual tortured by his\n\nidentity. The other two draftees in the\n\nplay were Martin, the suicidal soldier\n\nbent on getting himself out of the\n\nArmy, played by Eric Tilley, and Car-\n\nlyle, a young black man played by\n\nGregory Smith, who in a frenzy at the\n\nend of the play murders Billy and a\n\nsergeant.

The\n\nplay shows what happens when a per-\n\nsonal judgement tries to move exclu-\n\nsively on a political plane, where is-\n\nsues are simplified and distorted.

Whatever\n\nthe reason, ECU students found the most popular place to be\n\nNTOWN\n\nWas\n\nEvery night they head downtown: ECU students motivated by the same\n\nthings \" the need to escape for a time the tedium and monotony of\n\nuniversity life, to forget about term papers and tests and professors, to just\n\nplain cut loose and have fun.

It is hard to describe exactly \" it is almost ineffable \"\n\nand yet you get the same feeling in almost any town. It has something to do\n\nwith sex, because if you ask most students why they go downtown, they\n\nwill tell you they go to meet the opposite sex. Call that the sense of\n\nexpectancy. And it has something to do with the bars, which like most bars\n\nthat cater predominantly to college students, are short on decora nd fur-\n\nnishings, and long on ambiance; they are meant to be crowded with\n\nstudents, just packed to the walls, and vibrating with noise \" a noise that\n\nis peculiar to such bars, a steady hum of rowdy conversation against a\n\nbackground of very loud music. There is something electric in these bars, a\n\nlot of energy floats in the air, a kind of unrestrained exuberance that comes\n\nfrom a bunch of college students jammed together in a small space, drink-\n\ning beer, laughing, dancing, trying to pick up a date. These bars smell of\n\nstale beer and old cigarette smoke. There are always bouncers lurking\n\naround; they watch the students with bored eyes.

Yet few suspected that election\n\neve would bring the whole scale mas-\n\nsacre of Democratic senators that was\n\napparent the next morning.\n\nJohn EastTs surprise victory over\n\nDemocratic incumbent Robert Mor-\n\ngan followed this national trend and\n\ngave North Carolina two Republicans\n\nin the U.S. Senate. Further, EastTs vic-\n\ntory, which came only as the final\n\nvotes were counted, guaranteed a Re-\n\npublican majority in that body for the\n\nfirst time in 30 years.\n\nDuring the campaign the contest\n\nwas Close, but predictions were giving\n\nMorgan a slight edge. However, in the\n\nfinal tally it was East who won the\n\nelection.\n\nEast, an East Carolina University\n\npolitical science professor, overcame\n\nmany obstacles in his quest for the\n\nSenate. For the most part, he was un-\n\nknown in the state. He had run unsuc-\n\ncessfully for Congress in 1966 and for\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State two\n\nyears later.\n\nBorn in Illinois, East was not the\n\nhometown? boy from North Caroli-\n\nna. He was also a Republican ina state\n\nwhere Democrats outnumber Repub-\n\nlicans three to one. In order to win, he\n\nnot only had to defeat Morgan but the\n\nDemocratic party as well. To stack the\n\nodds even more, Morgan was backed\n\nby the most powerful Democratic ma-\n\nchine in the stateTs recent history.\n\nDuring the early part of the election\n\nnight, it seemed as though Morgan\n\nwould pull off a narrow victory, but as\n\nmore precincts reported East gained a\n\nslight edge.\n\nMorgan ran strong in the stateTs\n\npredominantly black precincts in the\n\nEast and the Piedmont. East drew\n\nmuch of his support from the Repub-\n\nlican precincts in the West and from\n\nJohn East was one of several Republican Sena-\n\ntorial candidates who scored narrow victories\n\nover more liberal Democratic incumbents. East\n\nDefeated Senator Robert Morgan by 6700 votes.\n\nHe is shown here with his wife Sis and daugh-\n\nters Marty and Catherine awaiting results on\n\nmiddle-class suburban precincts\n\nacross the state.\n\nEast, confined by a wheelchair, ran\n\na series of television advertisements\n\ninstead of a rigorous personal cam-\n\npaign. His ads attacked MorganTs past\n\ncongressional record and labeled him\n\nas a liberal who was out of touch with\n\nNorth Carolinians.\n\nEast's campaign was coordinated by\n\nthe conservative Congressional Club,\n\nthe powerful political base founded\n\nby North CarolinaTs senior senator\n\nJesse Helms.\n\nMorgan traveled throughout the\n\nstate in the closing weeks of the cam-\n\npaign. He accused East of distorting\n\nhis congressional record and called\n\nEastTs supporters ultraconservative\n\nJohn Birchers.?\n\nMorgan and the Democrats also\n\nmade an issue of the funding of the\n\ntwo campaigns. Morgan accused East\n\nof trying to buy a Senate seat. East\n\nraised $1 million while MorganTs fund\n\namounted to $640,000.\n\nAs the three major television net-\n\nworks prepared to go off the air early\n\nWednesday morning, two of them \"\n\nABC and NBC \" predicted that Mor-\n\ngan had won. At 1 a.m. Morgan deliv-\n\nered a victory speech, but East refused\n\nto concede the race until the final\n\nvotes had been counted.\n\nAt about 6 a.m., when 99 percent of\n\nthe votes had been tallied, East had\n\ndefied the predictions by a narrow\n\nmargin. East won by 6700 votes out of\n\nthe approximately 1.8 million cast in\n\none of the biggest political upsets in\n\nthe country.\n\nEastTs victory was only one of many\n\nthat occurred in Senate races across\n\nthe country.

Fields on\n\nhis epitaph. That was easy for him to\n\nsay; he was not a baseball fan. No\n\nteam in the majors had as long or\n\nluckless history as the Philadelphia\n\nPhillies. Before the 1980 series, the\n\nQuaker City had managed to reach the\n\nWorld Series only twice. In their two\n\nappearances they managed only one\n\ngame, dashing their hopes for a world\n\nchampionship.\n\nBut in the 1980 World Series, the\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies had a sense of\n\nmagic. With the leadership of the Se-\n\nmes Most Valuable Player Mike\n\nSchmidt, the Phillies proved Philadel-\n\nPhia could be a city of champions.\n\nOn the mound for Philadelphia in\n\ngame one was Bob Walk, a rookie who\n\nonly a year earlier was pumping gas in\n\nNewhall, California, harboring few\n\ndreams of glory. Walk was the first\n\nrookie to start an opening Series game\n\nsince the DodgersT Joe Black faced the\n\nYankees in 1952.\n\nThe Kansas City fans who had trav-\n\neled to Philadelphia for the first game\n\nroared during the second inning when\n\nAmos Otis hit a two-run homer and\n\nWillie Aikens hit another in the third.\n\nBut the Phillies had come from be-\n\nhind in all three of their playoff\n\ngames, and they did it again against\n\nthe Royals. The Phillies rallied back\n\nbut at the top of the fourth the Royals\n\nstill had a 4-2 lead.\n\nPhiladelphiaTs rally held through\n\nthe remainder of the game as they\n\nmade it a final 7-6 in the eighth.\n\nA shudder of apprehension passed\n\nthrough the Kansas City camp when\n\nlt was learned that George Brett, the\n\nelectric presence in the RoyalTs lineup,\n\n= suffering from hemorrhoids.\n\nrett was in pain by the finish of the\n\nOpening game, and he underwent\n\ntreatment as late as 4 a.m. on the day\n\nof game two. But he played, cracking\n\nPi hits and drawing a walk before\n\nimping off in the sixth inning.\n\nThe Phillies still had enough mo-\n\nUae from the first game to score a\n\n~4 victory over the Royals.\n\nThe World Series moved to Kansas\n\nCity with the third game. BrettTs pain\n\nhad been alleviated, and the Royals\n\nlooked with hope toward the third\n\ngame after the teamTs poor showing at\n\nPhiladelphia.\n\nThe game see-sawed back and\n\nfourth during the regular nine in-\n\nnings and for the fifth time since the\n\nregular season ended, the Phillies car-\n\nried a reluctant opponent into extra\n\ninnings. The Royals won in the 10th\n\non a hit by Aikens, 4-3.\n\nThe Royals revival continued into\n\ngame four as they tied the Series with\n\na 5-3 win over the Phillies.\n\nReporters and fans began asking\n\nthe Phillies questions about their two\n\nlosses. Phillie captain Mike Schmidt\n\nrecalled, Somebody asked me if weTd\n\nrun out of miracles. Everybody kept\n\ntalking about luck and miracles and\n\nheart and character. But weTve got tal-\n\nent.?\n\nThey proved they had talent and a\n\nlittle bit of luck to pull off a ninth-\n\ninning victory. That miracle gave the\n\nPhillies a 4-3 in in the fifth game and\n\nthe edge they so desperately needed\n\nafter consecutive defeats in Kansas\n\nCity. The Phillies now led three games\n\nto two with the remainder of the\n\ngames to be played in the Quaker\n\nCity.\n\nReturning to Philadelphia, Kansas\n\nCity faced Phillies ace Steve Carlton\n\nin the sixth game. The Royals had\n\ntrouble until the eighth inning, when\n\nthey finally scored a run off Carlton.\n\nBut the Phillies pulled off a 4-3 victo-\n\nry in the end to officially win the 1980\n\nWorld Series.\n\nAfter the game the RoyalTs club-\n\nhouse, normally lively, was silent and\n\nforlorn. They had tasted the bitterest\n\nof defeats.\n\nBut the Phillies had finally accom-\n\nlished a victory for their hometown\n\nof Philadelphia. More than 1 million\n\nfans ina city of 1.5 million turned out\n\nthe next day for a victory parade and\n\nrally.

The\n\nMGM Grand Hotel fire became the\n\nsecond worst in the U.S. history, sur-\n\npassed only by the Winecoff Hotel di-\n\nsaster in Atlanta in 1946 which killed\n\n279.\n\nEarly morning patrons fled the casi-\n\nno, which stayed open 24 hours a day,\n\nas the flames roared up through the\n\ncatwalk. The catwalk, called the eye\n\ns 83\n\nin the sky,? was used by management\n\nto monitor gambling.\n\nThough the blaze never spread\n\nabove the second floor, it apparently\n\nknocked out the telephone switch-\n\nboard and the fire alarm system. The\n\n4,500 guests were left in their rooms\n\nwith no warning system. The guests\n\nwho were sleeping were awakened by\n\na stifling smoke. Keith Beverton of\n\nWoodland Hills, California, said I\n\nopened my hotel room door and peo-\n\nple were shouting, ~What should we\n\ndo?T. It was death, absolute death\n\nthere. I closed the door but the air in\n\nmy room was so thick I was having\n\ntrouble breathing.?\n\nGuests searched for exits frantical-\n\nly. Some found the stairwells, only to\n\ndiscover a thick smoke or locked\n\ndoors on the stairwell as a security\n\nmeasure. Others never made it to the\n\nstairs \" they were trapped in smoke-\n\nfilled hallways.\n\nMany guests who were stranded in\n\nae\n\nlad\n\nStudent Life\n\nWide World\n\ntheir rooms crowded onto the balco-\n\nnies, screaming for help. Others on\n\nthe upper levels fled to the hotelTs\n\nroof. Windows were shattered by peo-\n\nple seeking fresh air.\n\nFiremen on rescue ladders were\n\nonly able to help people as high as the\n\nninth floor. Many firemen clammered\n\nup stairwells to lead guests from high-\n\ner floors down to safety. Helicopters\n\nfrom nearby Nellis Air Force Base\n\nmade the most dramatic rescue. The\n\neleven choppers hovered over the\n\nroof, letting down cables to lift hun-\n\ndreds of guests.\n\nAuthorities tried to calm frantic\n\nguests, some of whom were tying\n\nsheets together and dangling them\n\nfrom the windows. Policemen bel-\n\nlowed DonTt jump! DonTt jump!?\n\nthrough bullhorns. A_ helicopter\n\nswooped around the hotel announc-\n\ning over a loud speaker in English and\n\nSpanish that the fire was under con-\n\ntrol. One woman, who chose not to\n\nheed the warnings, was killed when\n\nshe tried to climb down a bedsheet\n\nrope from her 19th floor window. She\n\nmade it to the 17th floor and then fell.\n\nThe MGM Grand was built in 1973\n\nat a cost of $106 million. The county\n\nbuilding codes, at that time, were met\n\nby the contractors. The requirements\n\ncalled for a sprinkler system to be in-\n\nstalled in the basement, first and top\n\nfloors. No smoke detectors were in-\n\nstalled in the guest rooms. A new code\n\nwas passed in 1979 which required\n\nsprinklers on every floor and the use\n\nof smoke detectors. Said one fire\n\nfighter, More sprinklers would have\n\nmade all the difference in the world.?\n\nThe tragedy was made worse by the\n\nfact that flames were able to destroy\n\nthe alarmTs control system before it\n\ncould go into action. In addition, open\n\nstairwells funneled the smoke upward\n\nlike chimneys. Nevada Governor\n\nRobert List called the hotel burned-\n\nout devastation.

Authorities appre-\n\nhended Mark Chapman in front of\n\nLennonTs apartment and charged him\n\nwith the murder.

We didnTt notice un-\n\ntil today when we went back to\n\ncheck.?\n\nFriends of ChapmanTs described\n\nhim as a devout Beatles fan.

In 1961, they came to the atten-\n\nto domestic duties while Yoko super-\n\nvised business matters.\n\nFinally, in August, 1980, the Len-\n\nnons began making a new album,\n\nDouble Fantasy,? which was in the\n\nnational top 20 before LennonTs death.\n\nAs word of LennonTs death reached\n\nthe other Beatles, all were grieved.\n\nRingo Starr flew to New York to com-\n\nfort Yoko. Harrison also flew in. Paul\n\nMcCartney, who wrote with Lennon\n\nmore hit songs than any other modern\n\ncomposer, said, John was a great\n\nman who will be sadly missed by the\n\nworld, but remembered for his unique\n\ncontribution to art.?\n\nHundreds of fans paid tribute,\n\ncrowded behind barricades outside\n\ntion of Brian Epstein, who secured\n\nthem a recording contract, arranged\n\ntheir conquest of England and Europe,\n\nand in 1964, brought them to America.\n\nThe Beatles were the first popular\n\nrock and roll band to write its own\n\nmusic, to address an entire range of\n\nserious subjects, and to adopt influ-\n\nences that ranged from Bob DylanTs\n\nfolk poetry to Indian classical music.\n\nAfter the Beatles broke up in 1970,\n\nLennon, along with his wife Yoko\n\nOno, continued to make albums.\n\nImagine?

In\n\nthe beginning, the destruction seemed\n\nmanageable, but the awful magnitude\n\nof the catastrophe slowly began to\n\nemerge.\n\nDozens of small communities had\n\nbeen leveled across 10,000 square\n\nmiles of rugged southern countryside.\n\nWhole villages were entombed under\n\ndebris. Uncounted thousands were\n\nburied in the remains of their homes,\n\ncafes and churches. It took rescue\n\nworkers 48 hours or more to reach\n\nmany isolated hamlets due to bad\n\nweather.\n\nThe workers unearthed battered\n\ncorpses with sickening regularity.\n\nAfter only a few days work, the offi-\n\ncial death toll was 3,000 \" only a frac-\n\ntion of the actual total. Even more\n\nfrightening was the realization of hu-\n\nman failure: many who died of shock\n\nand exposure might have lived if res-\n\ncue workers could have reached them\n\nearlier.\n\nIt was ItalyTs worst earthquake in 65\n\nyears. The first shock, which mea-\n\nsured 6.8 on the Richter scale, hit in\n\nthe early evening as most of the coun-\n\ntry was sitting down to Sunday sup-\n\nper. Thirty-three smaller tremors fol-\n\nlowed during the night, ranging in\n\nintensity from 3.5 to 4.5. From its epi-\n\ncenter at Eboli, near Salerno, the\n\nquake spread its destruction through\n\nthe regions of Campania and Basili-\n\ncata, a rugged belt of countryside be-\n\ntween the Apennines and the Tyrr-\n\nhenian Sea on the ankle of the Italian\n\nboot.\n\nThough it struck some major cities\n\nalong its path, the quake centered\n\nwith cruel concentration on impover-\n\nished rural villages. In all, 179 com-\n\nmunities suffered at least some dam-\n\nage, and 310,000 people were left\n\nhomeless. |\n\nAuthorities seemed to be unpre-\n\npared for the disaster, even though the\n\narea has a history of seismic activity.\n\nThere were no disaster contingency\n\nplans and few resources for rapidly\n\ndeploying rescue teams to the moun-\n\ntain hamlets. The necessary soldiers,\n\nfiremen, medical supplies and heavy\n\nequipment had to be transported from\n\nmilitary bases hundreds of miles to\n\nStudent Life\n\nthe north.\n\nBeyond question, there have been\n\nserious official shortcomings,? said\n\nPresident Sandro Pertini during a\n\ngrim and surprisingly outspoken ad-\n\ndress on television. Those guilty of\n\nthese failures must be made to pay.?\n\nPertiniTs remarks caused political\n\nunrest in ItalyTs government. Interior\n\nMinister Virginio Rognoni, under\n\nheavy political fire over the botched\n\nrelief effort, abruptly tried to resign\n\nfrom the month-old coalition cabinet\n\nof Christian Democratic Prime Minis-\n\nter Arnaldo Forlani. Forlani rejected\n\nthe resignation and urged Rognoni to\n\nstay on the job, arguing that the last\n\nthing that was needed during the\n\nearthquake emergency was political\n\ncontroversy.\n\nThe Communists soon began fum-\n\ning against what they called the inex-\n\ncusable lack of action by the authori-\n\nties.? Communist party chief Enrico\n\nBerlinguer proposed the creation of a\n\nnew Communist-led coalition govern-\n\nment. The Christian Democrats, who\n\nhad ruled Italy for the past 30 years,\n\nwere clearly weakened by the relief\n\nscandal. However, ForlaniTs cabinet\n\nwas hardly prepared to step aside.\n\nThe central government failed to\n\nrecognize the full extent of the catas-\n\ntrophe until more than 36 hours after\n\nthe first tremors. Early reports told of\n\nscattered destructions in the cities: a\n\nnine-story building collapsed in Na-\n\nples, killing 52 occupants, damage to\n\npolice headquarters in Salerno\n\nclaimed the lives of two officers, five\n\npeople died in Potenza. Terrified\n\nsoutherners fled their homes looking\n\nfor safety in open spaces. Whole fam-\n\nilies were found sleeping in their cars\n\non local soccer fields, municipal parks\n\nand service stations.\n\nAs. the rubble was gradually re-\n\nmoved, it became evident that the\n\nworst damage had occurred in the\n\ncountryside. Most of the quakeTs vic-\n\ntims died in the remote villages that\n\ncling to the hilltops along narrow,\n\nhard-to-reach valleys,? reported Time\n\nmagazineTs Erik Amfitheatrof after\n\ntouring the region in a helicopter.\n\nMany were buried alive when the\n\nclose-packed walls of their houses\n\npushed each other down, one after the\n\nother. There was no escape in the nar-\n\nrow, winding village streets.?\n\nThe reports from these outlying vil-\n\nlages did not start filtering through\n\nuntil the next morning because the\n\ntelephone lines were down. The news\n\nwas devastating. Sixty miles east of\n\nNaples, for example, the village of\n\nConza della Campania lost 80 percent\n\nof its 2,500 inhabitants. Only three\n\nbuildings were left intact in Laviano, a\n\nhilltop hamlet, and a third of the 3,000\n\nvillagers were missing. Neighboring\n\nCastelnuovo di Conza was completely\n\ndestroyed; authorities simply had no\n\nidea how many people were buried in\n\nits ruins.\n\nThe largest group of victims was\n\nfound in the rubble of the 15th cen-\n\ntury Church of Santa Maria Assunta\n\nat Balvano. Three hundred parishion-\n\ners, mostly mothers and children re-\n\nceiving instructions for their First\n\nCommunion, were attending evening\n\nMass when the marble floor began to\n\nheave and the heavy candlesticks to\n\nwobble on the main altar. As the terri-\n\nfied group fled, the huge roof split in\n\ntwo and collapsed, burying worship-\n\ners under a mountain of stone.\n\nPope John Paul toured the region\n\nby helicopter, offering comforting\n\nthoughts and prayers to the disaster-\n\nstricken people. In his quiet Polish-\n\naccented Italian, he said, I want to\n\ntell you that you are surrounded by\n\ncompassion on the part of all Chris-\n\ntians.?\n\nAcross the villages and countryside,\n\nsurvivors dug through the rubble\n\nsearching frantically for other family\n\nmembers. By night, the few survivors -\n\nhuddled together by campfires.\n\nInternational reaction to the quake-\n\nstricken Italy was swift. The United\n\nStates provided six military helicop-\n\nters, 2,000 tents and a pledge of an\n\ninitial $1.5 million to a relief fund.\n\nDozens of private charities set up\n\nfunds of their own in American cities\n\nwith large Italian immigrant popula-\n\ntions. The European community ap-\n\npropriated $2 million for disaster re-\n\nlief. Red Cross societies in at least\n\nnine countries provided funds.\n\nSome international assistance was\n\nstalled by ItalyTs infamous bureaucra-\n\ncy. Two Red Cross planes loaded with\n\nrelief supplies were reportedly forced\n\nto wait 24 hours for clearance to enter\n\nthe country. Local rescue teams also\n\nencountered numerous problems. The\n\nWide World\n\n11 12 13 14 15 16\n\n17\n\n18 19 20 21 22 23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nFTVvVeww FT wes eee\n\nfirst teams were scarcely better\n\nequipped than those they were sent to\n\nhelp.\n\nThe rescue operation, which num-\n\nbered approximately 33,000, used spe-\n\ncially trained German shepherd dogs\n\nand directional microphones lowered\n\ninto cavities in the rubble to find sur-\n\nvivors in the wreckage. On Friday\n\nthree people, including a six-month\n\nold child, were rescued in Lioni after\n\nmore than five days of entrapment.\n\nA 26-year-old woman named Liber-\n\nata was trapped with her mother for\n\n72 hours after their home collapsed. In\n\na television interview she described\n\nthe harrowing experience. ~We\n\nhugged each other helplessly. In the\n\ndarkness, we tried to scrape away the\n\nA lonely villager walks through a _ rubble-\n\nstrewn street in Balvano, Italy, a town that was\n\nvirtually destroyed in the November 23 earth-\n\ndirt and make space in which to\n\nbreathe. Mother prayed and I heard\n\nher say, ~Oh God, let me die an hour\n\nbefore my daughter because I could\n\nnot stand to see her die.T We spoke of\n\nmany things, important things. When\n\nthey pulled us out, I felt my motherTs\n\nface. It was cold. This told me she was\n\nnear the end, and | burst into tears.?\n\nLiberataTs mother died seconds after\n\nbeing rescued.\n\nGiuseppe Zamberletti, the govern-\n\nmentTs Under Secretary for Foreign\n\nAffairs, ultimately brought the relief\n\neffort to full scale. Zamberletti set up\n\nhis headquarters in Naples on Tues-\n\nday and by Friday large quantities of\n\nfood, clothing and medical supplies\n\nwere flowing into major towns,\n\nthough deliveries to isolated villages\n\nremained slow. He also requisitioned\n\nrailroad cars and seaside tourist hotels\n\nto provide temporary shelter for the\n\nhomeless. If people do not need to\n\nremain close to their homes, we can\n\nmove them into resort hotels and holi-\n\nday camps on the coast,? he explained.\n\nMost people dream of a holiday by\n\nthe sea. Well, at least we can give them\n\nthat.?\n\nBy weekTs end, little hope for find-\n\ning survivors remained. Officials be-\n\ngan looking toward the task of re-\n\nbuilding the quake-stricken area. We\n\ncannot have the worldTs biggest en-\n\ncampment,? said Zamberletti. We\n\nmust build entire villages.? An early\n\nwinter, with incessant rain and freez-\n\ning cold, was the final hardship many\n\nof the homeless refugees could en-\n\ndure. The weather is terrible,? de-\n\nclared Vittorio Renzulli, mayor of San\n\nMichele di Serino. We already have\n\nseveral cases of flu, and children are\n\ncoming down with bronchitis. We\n\nstill need tents, blankets.?\n\ncm\n\n74\n\nWhat it Was\n\n99\n\ncont.\n\nFinally, on President ReaganTs in-\n\nauguration day, and after 14 months\n\nof false starts and faded hopes, the\n\nhostage crisis in Iran came to a dra-\n\nmatic climax after a pressure packed\n\nweek of high-level international bar-\n\ngaining.\n\nOn Sunday morning, January 18,\n\nU.S. time, Behzad Nabavi, IranTs chief\n\nhostage negotiator declared: ~The\n\ngovernment of the Islamic Republic\n\nof Iran and the United States finally\n\nreached agreement on resolving the\n\nissue of the hostages today.?\n\nStudent Life\n\nIT Am Just Overjoyed.\n\nIn Washington, Vice President\n\nWalter Mondale was not quite as con-\n\nfident. ~We're very, very close, but we\n\ndo not yet have an agreement.? Presi-\n\ndent Jimmy Carter helicoptered to the\n\nWhite House from Camp David and\n\nquickly called the U.S. diplomats in\n\nAlgiers for a briefing on the negotia-\n\ntions.\n\nEverything seemed to be in place\n\nfor the release. A team of Algerian\n\ndoctors had flown to Tehran to exam-\n\nine the hostages. Some $2.2 billion in\n\nIranian currency and gold had been\n\ntransferred from New York to London\n\nso it could be turned over to Iran with-\n\nin minutes of the 52 hostagesT depar-\n\nture from Tehran. A thirty member\n\nU.S. hostage recovery team was ready\n\nto fly to West Germany to meet the\n\nreleased hostages at a U.S. military\n\nhospital.\n\nFor the families at home, the\n\nmonths of recurring rumors of re-\n\nlease, fed by Iranian propagandists,\n\nhad been painful. Even on the verge of\n\nactual release, Dorothea Morefield of\n\nSan Diego, whose husband was con-\n\n11 12 13 14 15 16 17\n\n18 19 20 21 22 23\n\n24\n\n25\n\ncm\n\nI Feel Proud Again.?\n\nsul general of the captive embassy\n\nsaid, Everybody's walking around\n\nwith their fingers crossed.? Susan\n\nCooke of Memphis said of her hos-\n\ntage son Donald, I just want to grab\n\nhim and hang on for dear life.?\n\nThe outgoing president and _ his\n\ngroup of diplomats labored through\n\nmeetings in Washington and Algiers\n\nwhile Iranian clerics and international\n\nbankers met in London, New York,\n\nTehran and Washington.\n\nThe first proposal was relayed to\n\nTehran by the Algerians on January 2.\n\nWide World\n\nThe proposal placed the value of fro-\n\nzen Iranian assets at about $9.5 bil-\n\nlion. Iran had claimed that it had some\n\n$14 billion deposited in U.S. banks\n\nand their European branches. Of the\n\n$9.5 billion, the U.S. was willing to\n\ntransfer up to $5.5 billion to Iran on\n\nthe day the hostages were released.\n\nIran would be able to recover another\n\n$1.8 billion once it had worked out\n\nseparate arrangements with U.S.\n\nbanks. That still left $2.2 billion in\n\nIranian funds in the United States.\n\nThat amount was tied up in suits\n\nfiled by various U.S. corporations,\n\nwhich contended that Iran owed them\n\nmoney for breaches of contract and\n\nexpropriated property.\n\nWhile U.S. officials were worried\n\nthat Iran would not accept the propos-\n\nal \" things briefly looked brighter in\n\nTehran. Officials there had portrayed\n\nthe latest U.S. proposals as Algerian?\n\nstatements, which presumably made\n\nthem easier for Iran to accept. Azizi,\n\nIranTs second-ranking spokesman on\n\nthe hostages, declared that points\n\nraised by the Algerians have been\n\nconsidered, in principle, acceptable,?\n\nand he predicted that they would most\n\nlikely be accepted by the Iranian gov-\n\nernment.\n\nOn Tuesday, January 19, the US.\n\nrising spirits sagged once again. Iran's\n\nchief hostage negotiator, Behzad Na-\n\nbavi, had urged the Majlis, the Iranian\n\nparliament, to take emergency action\n\nto pass two bills that would expedite\n\nsettlement of the hostage issue. But\n\nwhen the Majlis met, the required\n\nquorum was not present. American\n\ndiplomats feared that the Iranians had\n\nboycotted the session to block any\n\nagreement.\n\nOn Wednesday"
