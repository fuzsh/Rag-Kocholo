H. beers & CO. ieo3 ^/ |\\- tii;i^7 PRKFACE. HE importance of placing in book form biographical history of represen- tative citizens — both for its immediate worth and for its value to coming generations — is admitted by all thinking people; and within the past decade there has been a growing interest in this commendable means of perpetuating biography and family genealogy. That the public is entitled to the privileges afforded by a work of this nature needs no assertion at our hands; for one of our greatest Americans has said that the history of any country resolves itself into the biographies of its stout, earnest and representative citizens. This medium, then, serves more than a single purpose; while it perpetu- ates biography and family genealogy, it records history, much of which would be preserved in no other way. The Biographical Annals of Lancaster county had its inception in the mind of John F. Meginness, a citizen of that county, now deceased, widely known throughout the State as an his- torical writer, who, as manager for the firm of John F. Meginness & Co., commenced the work now completed. In presenting this work to its patrons, the publishers have to acknowledge, with gratitude, the encouragement and support their enterprise has received, and the willing assistance rendered in enabling them to surmount the many unforeseen obstacles to be met with in the production of a work of this character. In nearly every instance the material composing the sketches was gathered from those immediately interested, and then submitted in type-written form for correction and re- vision. The volume, which is one of generous amplitude, is placed in the hands of the public with the belief that it will be found a valuable addition to the library, as well as an invaluable contribu- tion to the historical literature of the State of Pennsylvania.

D., Presi- dent Judge of the Second Judicial District of Pennsyl- vania, now serving his fourth term, was born in Salisbury township, Lancas- ter county, on Sunday, Oct. 14, 1 82 1. His father was John Livingston, and his mother Jane Graham. John Livingston, through whom the Judge is of English descent, was a farmer, teacher and justice of the peace, and one of the prom- inent citizens of Lancaster county. On his mother's side Mr. Livingston is descended from Scotch-Irish ancestry. John B. Livingston obtained his primary edu- cation under the private instruction of his father, whom he assisted in the farm work, for some branches of which physical disability had irlcapaci- tated the father. Much devolved upon the eldest son, who attended school in the winter and improved his leisure hours during his summer work by study. Matters continued thus until 1842, when, his younger brothers being able to assume their share of the farm work, John engaged in teaching school, which occupation he followed three years, still assist- ing his father during the summer. In the mean- time, besides receiving instruction from his father and in the public schools, he attended the select school of Rev. Dr. Timlow, one of the best in the county. He early evinced marked ability in the prosecution of his studies, making rapid progress, and the roughing he experienced on the farm de- veloped that naturally vigorous constitution which serves him so well in discharging the duties of the Bench at the age of over four-score. When thinking of choosing a profession the first inclination of Mr. Livingston was toward medicine, but upon reflection he shrank from the responsibility it involved. While if, as a doctor, he made a fatal mistake, it would be buried out of the light of the world, he feared that the consciousness of it would remain as an ever harassing memory. Therefore he chose the legal profession, where, if he blundered. there would still be opportunity to make amends. Having gained the consent of his father, who. had been averse to his son encountering the temptations of city life, he wrote to Thaddeus Stevens to know if he had room for a student, and, if so, what were his terms. He received this characteristic reply: \"Have room. Take students. Terms, $200. Some pay, some don't.\" So he came to Lancaster, accom- panied by his father, ' who introduced him to Mr. Stevens, who had just concluded an address to a jury in the old court-house. Their reception was rather discouraging. Assuming that stern look for which Mr. Stevens was sometimes noted, he said: \"You had better take the young man home.\" Being pressed for a reason by the astonished father, who had thought the arrangement with the son under- stood, Mr.. Stevens repeated his advice with em- phasis. Finally, assuming that bland smile which he could command with equal facility, he said: \"Because his face is too honest to be a lawyer.\" The father replied, \"If that is the only objection we will take the risk,\" and the \"too honest\" young country lad became a law Student of Thaddeus Stevens on the 6th of January, 1846. Young Livingston was fortunate in his choice of a preceptor. He was noted in his early life, as he is to-day, for the legibility and elegance of his penmanship, while Mr. Stevens was a close com- petitor with Greeley and Forney in tempting clients and compositors to indulge in profanity while try- ing to decipher their chirography. Stevens there- fore was not long in estimating the value of his new student as an amanuensis, and the result was that young Livingston was domiciled in the private office, while the other students studied in the other room. Thus he heard the great lawyer's confer- ences with clients, and in this way learned more of practical law than he could have possibly gained from books alone in the same time, although Mr. Stevens spoke of him in after life as one of the most studious students he ever had. After studying law two years Mr. Livingston was admitted to the Bar, Jan. 26, 1848; and at once opened a law office, pursuing a general practice on his own account until, in 1851, he entered the office BIOGRAPHICAL ANNALS OF LANCASTER COUNTY of Nathaniel Ellmaker, Esq., to assist him in his extensive orphans' court and general practice. The estimate which Mr. Stevens facetiously put upon the country lad, as having too honest a face to be a lawyer, was soon illustrated by the moderate fees he charged his clients, which became proverb- ial, and the subject of criticism by some of his less conscientious contemporaries; but it by no means detracted from his popularity, when, in 1862, he became a candidate for District Attorney, to which ofEce he was elected, serving a term of three years. The energy, ability and conscientious integrity with which he discharged the duties of that office brought him still more favorably into public notice, and he secured one of the largest and most lucrative practices in the county. Although in a pecuniary sense it was no pro- motion to yield such a growing practice for a seat on the Bench, Mr. Livingston was induced to stand for the nomination for President Judge, and, re- ceiving more votes at the primary election than all his comipetitors combined, was elected by a large majority in the fall of 1871, and entered upon his official duties on the 4th of December, following. He was re-elected in 1881, and again in 1891, triumphing over the most bitter factional opposi- tion ever made against any candidate in Lancaster county. A flattering but deserved compliment was vol- untarily paid Judge Livingston in 1882, when he received the joint endorsement of the Republican organization and the Bar of Lancaster County as a candidate for Judge of the Supreme court, \"in the full confidence that the spotless integrity and judi- cial attainments, and his untiring industry, that have made him the honored head of our court, eminent!}' fit him for the discharge of the high duties devolving upon a fnember of the Supreme court.\" But the crowning recognition of an upright judge, a Christian gentleman and an exemplary citi- zen was achieved in 1901, when John Boyd Living- ston received the nomination, by the unanimous vote of his party, for a fourth term as President Judge of the courts of Lancaster county, while his name was placed on the ticket of the opposition party as their candidate for the same office. This is a unique example of a reward for merit — nlerit recognized because it commanded recognition solely upon the admitted claims of the beneficiary. It is the first instance in the political history of Lancaster county when the merits of a candidate have commanded recognition irrespective of partisan predilections, and Judge Livingston is now rounding out a tenure of professional and official life without a parallel in the judicial annals of the Commonwealth. While devoted to his profession and the scrupu- lous discharge of every official duty which devolves upon him, Judge Livingston has kept himself in touch with the various local interests of his fellow citizens, especially with the cause of popular educa- tion. He was a school director for many years, assisting in organizing the night schools, was prin- cipal for a time, and occasionally, when a teacher was ill, he assumed his old role of schoolmaster by filling the temporary vacancy. He served as presi- dent of the Y. M. C. A., and took an active part as a member of the library committee in selecting and installing the library of that institution ; served as a member of the board of trustees of Franklin and Marshall College, which, in 1897, conferred upon him the honorary degree of LL. D. ; and is an active member of the board of trustees of the First State Normal School, at Millersville, having been first elected by the stockholders and subsequently ap- pointed by the State executive. He is a communi- cant of St. James Episcopal Church, and a member of the vestry. Judge Livingston was united in marriage. May 18, 1853, to Anna M. Swentzell, who died Sept. 24, 1902, and was buried in Woodward Hill cemetery Sept. 27th. She was a sister of Rev. Dr. Frederick Swentzell (deceased),' and aunt of Rev. Dr. Henry C. Swentzell, rector of St. Luke's Episcopal Church, Brooklyn, New York. HON. MATTHEW STANLEY QUAY, United States Senator from Pennsylvania, was born Sept. 30, 1833, at Dillsburg, York Co., this State. He comes of honorable American ancestry, being a son of Rev. Anderson Beaton and Catherine (McCain) Quay, the former a prominent Presby- terian divine, who was in the ministry for many years, being pastor in charge of flourishing churches at Dillsburg, York county; Beaver, Beaver county, and Indiana, Indiana county, successively. Through his mother Rev. Anderson B. Quay was descended from James Anderson, who came from Scotland in 1713, and subsequently married Eliza- beth Jerman, daughter of Thomas Jerman, a noted Quaker preacher. The latter emigrated from Wales with his wife, Elizabeth, and about 1700 settled in the Chester Valley, where he erected one of the first mills in the province. Patrick Anderson, son of James, and great-grandfather of the Senator, was the first white child born in what is now Schuylkill township, in the northern part of Chester county. Pa. He was one of the prominent men of his time and place, and took an active part in the stirring events preceding and during the Revolutionary period. He was a captain in the French and Indian war, and when the Revolution broke out was a member of the Chester County committee, on which Anthony Wayne was also serving. In 1776 he en- tered the service as captain of the First Company, Pennsylvania Musketry Battalion, of which he took command after the battle of Long Island, in which. Col. Atlee was captured and Lieut. Col. Parry was killed. In 1778 and 1770 he was a member of the Pennsylvania Assembly, and his son, Isaac Ander- son, represented that District in Congress from 1803 to 1807. Ascenath Anderson, daughter of BIOGRAPHICAL ANNALS OF LANCASTER COUNTY Patrick Anderson, became the wife of Joseph Quay, the Senator's grandfather, and they lived near Phoenixville, in what is now Schuylkill township, Chester county. Senator Quay's great-grand- mother, Ann Beaton, was a daughter of Daniel Beaton, and a sister of Col. John Beaton, who was active in military affairs in Chester county .during the Revolutionary war. Matthew S. Quay graduated from Jefferson Col- lege, Philadelphia, in 1850, took up the study of law with Penny & .Sterrett, in Pittsburg, and was ad- mitted to the Bar of Beaver county in 1854. In 1855 he was appointed prothonotary of that county, was elected to that office in 1856, and again in 1859. In 1861 he resigned to accept a lieutenancy in the toth Pennsylvania Reserves. He was subsequently made assistant commissary general of the State, with the rank of lieutenant colonel; was appointed private secretary to Gov. Andrew G. Curtin ; and in August, 1862, was commissioned colonel of the 134th P. V. I. He was mustered out Dec. 7, 1862, on account of ill health, but the following week, Dec. 13, took part as a vohmteer in the assault on Marye's Heights. Having\" received the appoint- ment of State agent at Washington, he served in that Capacity for a time, until recalled by the Penn- sylvania Legislature to fill the office of military secretary, created by that body. In 1864 he was elected to the Legislature, and again in 1865 and 1866. In the year last mentioned he was secretary of the Republican State Committee, of which he was chairman in 1878. In 1869 Mr. Quay estab- lished the Beaver Radical, which he edited. In 1:873 he became secretary of the State of Pennsyl- vania, which incumbency he resigned in 1878 to ac- cept the appointment of recorder of Philadelphia, resigning the latter office in January, 1879, when he was again appointed secretary of the Common- wealth; in October, 1882, he again resigned this post. In November, 1885, Mr. Quay was elected State treasurer by the largest vote ever given a candidate for that office. He resigned in Septem- ber, 1887. On Jan. 18, of the latter year, he was elected United States Senator for the term ending March 3, 1893, and immediately took a most active part in the deliberations of that body. He was member of the committees on Manufactures, Pen- sions, Public Buildings and Grounds, Post Offices and Post Roads, and Claims, and chairman of the committee to examine the various branches of the civil service. Mr. Quay has been reelected to this high office, continuing to hold a most prominent place in that legislative body to the present time (1903)- In 1855 Matthew S. Quay was united m mar- riage with Miss Agnes Barclay, daughter of John and Elizabeth (Shannon) Barclay, natives of Penn- sylvania, of Scotch-Irish descent. Children as fol- lows have been born to this union : Richard Rob- erts, Andrew Gregg Curtin, Mary Agnew, Coral and Susan Willard, all natives of Beaver. The eld- est son is a lawyer. The second son graduated from West Point June 11, 1888, and is in the United States army. The Senator owns one of the hand- somest farms in Lancaster county. MAJOR SIMON B. CAMERON. Prominent in the social, business, political and military affairs of Lancaster county, this gentleman, now located in Marietta, is active as becomes the descendant of \"so worthy an ancestor as Gen. Simon Cameron, who was his grandfather. Gen. Simon Cameron was one of Lancaster county's most distinguished citizens. Born March 8, 1799, in Maytown, this county, he was descended from Donald Cameron, who came from Scotland to America in the spring of 1775, in the same vessel with Rev. Colin McFarquhar. He was accom- panied by his sons, John and Simon, the latter's wife and Ann McKenzie, probably a sister of Simon's wife, whose maiden name is known to have been Mc- Kenzie. Coming from the same neighborhood as the reverend gentleman, they were Undoubtedly , well acquainted, and having been tenant farmers in their native place thev resumed their occupation upon the glebe lands of Donegal Church. As none of their names appear upon the Donegal assessment roll for two or three years, it is probable that after Mr. McFarquhar purchased a farm about two ;niles north of Mount Joy they carried on its culti- vation. Simon and John Cameron took the oath of , allegiance in June, 1778, before James Bayley, who . owned and occupied the \"Graybill farm,\" now the property of Abraham N. Cassel. Charles Cameron, son of Simon, was married about 1794 to Miss Martha Pfoutz, daughter of John Pfoutz. She was a woman vigorous in both mind ; and body, possessed of a cheerful and indomitable , spirit, which enabled her to face bravely the many I vicissitudes she and her husband experienced in pro- viding for the needs of their family. Charles Cam- [ eron learned the tailor's trade in Maytown, and for a few years carried on the hotel at the southwest corner of the square in that village, but with meager success. There their eldest son, William, was born in 1796, and the others, John, Simon, James ;and a daughter . (who married a Mr. Boggs), were born in a small frame house not far away, to which the family moved in 1797. From Maytown the family removed to Vinegar's Ferry, and thence, about 1809, to Northumberland, Pennsylvania. Simon Cameron was about nine years old when the family located in Northumberland, and, his father dying not long afterward, he was early thrown upon his own resources. In 1816 he entered as an apprentice to the printing business with Andrew Kennedy, of Northumberland, editor of the North- \\umberland County Gazette, but continued only one : year when his employer, because of financial reverses, :was obliged to close his establishment. By river- boat and on foot the young man made his way to Harrisburg, where he obtained a position in the BIOGRAPHICAL ANNALS OF LANCASTER COUNTY printing office of James Peacock, editor of the Re- publican, with whom he remained until he attained his majority. In January, 1821, at the soHcitation of Samuel D. Ingham, he went to Doylestown, where he published the Bucks County Messenger, which, in March of the same year, was merged with the Doyles- town Democrat under the name of the Bucks County Democrat. Toward the close of 1821 the plant was purchased by Gen. W. T. Rodgers. Mr. Cameron was engaged that winter as a journeyman printer in the office of Gales & Seaton, publishers of the National Intelligencer, at Washington. Returning to Harrisburg in 1822, he entered into partnership with Charles Mowry in the management of the Pennsyl- vania Intelligencer. At the conclusion of his services as State printer he was appointed by Gov. Shulze, of whom he was an early friend and supporter, to the ofEce of adjutant general of Pennsylvania. Thus began the career of public service which ended only with the close of his life itself, and in which he made a record equalled by few. Mr. Cameron early became interested in the de- velopment of internal improvements. In 1826 he be- gan building the section of the Pennsylvania canal (then in process of construction) between Harris- burg and Sunbury, and not long afterward took con- tracts for other sections, on the western division. The charter granted by the Commonwealth to the State Bank of Louisiana provided that the bank build a canal from Lake Pontchartrain to New Or- leans, and Mr. Cameron assumed the contract for the work, which was considered by engineers the greatest undertaking of the day. In Philadelphia he engaged twelve hundred men, whom he sent by sea to New Orleans, he himself, with his engineers and tools, going by river, from Pittsburg. This was in 1831. He spent half a year upon the work, and demonstrated its feasibility beyond a doubt. When the Bank of Middletown received its charter from the Legislature, in 1832, Mr. Cameron became cashier, and held that position for twenty-five years, the bank being a success from the start. The duties of that incumbency, however, were too limited to occupy all the time of a man possessed of his resources, and he interested himself in other fields of usefulness, par- ticularly the promotion of railroads, serving at one time as president of four corporations, all operating lines in the region of his birth place. The establish- ment of the railroads from Middletown to Lancaster, from Harrisburg to Sunbury, from Harrisburg to Lebanon, was due to his efforts, and he also gave his influence in favor of the Cumberland Valley road, and succeeded in securing to Pennsylvania the own- ership of the Northern Central railroad, from Har- risburg to Baltimore. Mr. Cameron organized the Pennsylvania dele- gation to the first National Convention ever held in the United States, which met in Baltimore, having been recalled from his work in Louisiana for that purpose. This delegation supported Van Buren for the Vice Presidency. After the Convention ]\\Ir. Cameron was appointed a visitor to West Point, by Gen. Jackson. In 1838 President Van Buren tendered him an appointment as commissioner, with James Murray, of Maryland, under a treaty with the Winnebago Indians, to settle and adjust the claims made against the Indians bv the traders. In 1845 he was. elected to the United States Senate, to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation of James Buch- anan (who became Secretary of State under Polk), and served four years with a fidelity which the most exacting of his constituents could not question. In the winter of 1857 he was re-elected to that body, to succeed Senator Brodhead, and was thus again brought prominently to public notice. In the polit- ical movements which preceded the campaign of i860 he was named as the choice of Pennsylvania for the Presidency, and his name was early asso- ciated with that of Lincoln for the Republican Na- tional ticket. Gen. Cameron's influence was strongly felt at, the Chicago Convention in i860, and he so won the confidence of Mr. Lincoln that when that gentleman was elected to the Presidency he voluntarily offered the General a cabinet office. From the organization of the cabinet it was a recognized fact that of all its members Gen. Cameron held the closest personal relations with the President, who during his service as Secretary of War, consulted him in private as well as in the regular cabinet meetings. Gen. Cam- eron, anticipating that the Civil war was too serious for speedy settlement, set on foot the extensive preparations which time justified. On Jan. 11, 1862, he resigned from the cabinet, and the same day was nominated by Lincoln for the most important diplo- matic mission in his gift — ^the minister to Russia be- ing intrusted with the transaction of our affairs there- at a time when a tact and discretion were never so- necessary. He was given an honor never before or since accorded a cabinet officer that of naming his- successor as Secretary of War. The General played a promirient part in nominat- ing Lincoln for a second term, and meantime took active part in the politics of his native State, winning- for the Republican party a standing which defied opposition. In 1866 he was again sent to the United States Senate, in which body he served longer than any other representative from Pennsylvania, and made a record also unsurpassed for activity and bril- liant service. After his last election he served eleven years, resigning in 1877. He was at the time one of the foremost members of that body, holding the chairmanship of the committee on Foreign Relations, appointment to which incumbency was a recognized acknowledgment of superior statesmanship. Though he made no claims to being an orator, and seldom participated in debate, Mr. Cameron's influence in National legislation was as great as that of any man who ever held a seat in the Senate. He armed him- self with facts, his arguments were clear and charac- terized by common sense, his propositions eminently practical, and his judgment in matters of finance,. BIOGRAPHICAL ANNALS OF LANCASTER COUNTY commerce, manufacturing, internal improvements, etc., was always accepted as correct, and consequently reliable. He encouraged every project looking to- ward the development and-opening up of the Western States, and his work was never without visible re- sults. Gen. Cameron married Margaret Brua, daughter of Peter Brua, of Harrisburg. The children born to this union were Rachel, who married Judge Burn- side, of Belief onte ; Brua, who is mentioned below ; Margaret, wife of Richard J. Haldeman ; James Donald; and Virginia, who married Wayne Mac- Veagh. Brua Cameron was a Civil engineer by profes- sion. He was cashier of the Bank of Middletown, founded by his father, and in May, 1861, commis- sioned paymaster in the regular army, serving as such until his death, which occurred in 1864, at Lochiel, Pa., when he was thirty-eight years of age. He married Elizabeth Bastedo, daughter of Gilbert and Marian Bastedo, of Nelson, Ontario, Canada, the former of whom was a farmer by occupation. Mrs. Cameron survived her husband several years, passing away Dec. 31, 1 871, at the age of forty-eight years, near Nelson, Ontario. The remains of both Test in the cemetery at Middletown. They were members of the Presbyterian Church at that place, and socially he was a Mason and Odd Fellow. Mr. and Mrs. Brua Cameron had the following named children: Simon B., whose name introduces this sketch , Marian Bastedo, widow of David Watts, of Harrisburg, who was an ironmaster; Margaret B., who died when eight years old ; Janet R., who mar- ried Dr. George Husband, a physician of Philadel- phia ; and James, who died in infancy. Simon B. Cameron was born May 11, 1855, in Middletown, Dauphin Co., Pa., where he passed the ■first twelve years of his life, and the next three were spent in Lititz, Lancaster county, where he attended the Academy. He was subsequently a student at Williston Setninary, Easthampton, Mass., and Upson Seminary, New Preston, Conn., and took the exam- ination for entrance to Sheffield Scientific School, Yale. Being offered a position on the Wheeler ex- ploring expedition, he accepted, and was thus occu- pied two years, after which he was engaged two years as instructor in Upson Seminary. In May, 1881, Mr. Cameron came to East Donegal township, Lan- caster county, to take charge of the Donegal farms for his grandfather, and he continued there until his marriage. He then moved to a farm two and a half miles from the Donegal farms, which was given him by his grandfather, residing on that place until his removal to Marietta in 1894. Here he has car- ried on a real-estate and insurance business, and in 1898 was, elected justice of the peace, in which ca- pacity he is still officiating. Like his honored fore- fathers, he is a Republican in political sentiment, and has been quite active in party affairs, serving as dele- gate from Lancaster county to the State Convention in 1894. He has not sought office, however, though he has been a member of the school board one year since locating in Marietta. Since January, 1890, Mr. Cameron has been a member of the Pennsylvania National Guard, and he served as quartermaster of the 4th Regiment until May, 1897, when he was promoted to his present position, in the 3d Brigade, on the staff of Gen. J. P. S. Gobin, as commissary of subsistence ; he ranks as major. During the riot at Hazleton, Pa., he pro- vided the food for the troops in service. He accom- panied the National Guard to the coal fields in the troublesome times in 1902. The Major is a member of the Loyal Legion, and fraternally of the Masonic Order, in which he has attained the thirty-second degree. He is also an elder in the Presbyterian Church and assistant superintendent of the Presby- terian Sunday School in the town in which he re- sides. On Feb. 15, 1887, Simon B. Cameron was united in marriage, at Harrisburg, with Miss HePen Mark- ley, and two children have blessed their union: Simon B., born May 20, 1888, died June 18, 1901 ; and Elva M., born Aug. 4, 1890. In religious con- nection our subject is a Presbyterian. Dr. George H. Markley, father of Mrs. Cameron, was born in Lancaster, and was a member of the old Markley family which has long been prominent in this county. In 1863 he removed to Harrisburg, where he passed the remainder of his days, dying May II, 1900. He was a physician, and also con- ducted a pharmacy. Dr. Markley married Miss Emma Snyder, of Harrisburg, daughter of Charles and Emma Snyder, the former of whom was a justice of the peace for many years. Mrs. Markley now makes her home in Harrisburg. Of the chil- dren born to Dr. and Mrs. Markley, Helen, Mrs. Cameron, ' was born in Lancaster ; Elva married Ralph Shaw, a lawyer of Paterson, N. J., where he is now assistant district attorney; and Miss Kath- erine lives with her mother. DAVID HAYES AGNEW was born at Noble- ■ ville, now the borough of Christiana, in Lancaster county, Nov. 24, 1818, only child of Robert and Agnes (Noble) Agnew. The latter had been pre- viously married to Rev. Eleazer Henderson, by whom she had two children, James N. ; and Mary Hender- son, who married Davies Wallace, of Lancaster county, and had a son, E. D. Wallace, who now re- sides at Blue Ball. The Agnew family, which has been prominent in this country for nearly two centuries, can be traced through many generations of North of Ireland and Scotch ancestry to Norman progenitors. The earli- est authentic record of the family comes from Ag- jieaux, a quaint village in northern France, from which the family derives its name — this being the leverse of the process in this country where the fam- ily has invariably given the name to the place. The little town of Agnew, Lancaster Co., Neb., named in honor of Dr. Agnew, is a typical example of this BIOGRAPHICAL ANNALS OF LANCASTER COUNTY method, and shows the space of time and changes in living and civilization between the Agneaux of the Old World, and the Agnew of the New. Tames Agnew, the great-grandfather of the sub- ject of this sketch, with two brothers, emigrated from Ireland about the year 1717. He was a typical Scotch- Irishman. In an old graveyard near Gettysburg lie a number of the earlier members of the Agnew family. On one of the grave-stones is the coat of arms of the Agnews of Lochnar, and on another a rude carving of Weights and Measures, with the inscription, \"The Weights and Measures of Scot- land.\" His biographer. Dr. J. Howe Adams, says Dr. Agnew evinced a pathetic interest in this little deserted spot, where so many of his lineage were laid to rest, and always spent much of his time when he visited Gettysburg taking tracings of the various stones. Robert Agnew, the father of David Hayes, was born in Adams county, Pa., and received his general education at Dickinson college, studied medicine and became a surgeon in the United States Navv. On his first voyage the vessel was wrecked oflf Cape Hatteras, and he narrowly escaped with his life. This incident changed his plans. He settled at Nobleville, where he soon acquired a large general practice, which finally made inroads upon his health, and he determined to retire. His popularity, how- ever, was such that he concluded the only way to do this was to remove from the neighborhood. He, therefore, after a practice of a quarter of a century, removed to Baltimore county, Md., where he pur- chased a handsome countrv seat. While a citizen of Lancaster county he was prominently identified with the Octoraro United Presbyterian Church as a leading member of the Sessions. He died Oct. 10, 1858, aged seventy-three years. The farm house in which his distinguished son was born is still stand- ing and in good repair. The old flouring mill, built by Dr. Robert Agnew in 1816, on a branch of the Octoraro at Christiana, is now a ruin. For many ' years the driveway leading from the public road to the farm buildings, led over the embankment of the mill pond. After receiving his primary education in the country school David Hayes Agnew was sent to the Moscow Academy, at that time a flourishing school, of which the Rev. Francis Latta was the principal. It derived its name from this incident: Soon after the war of 1812 there was a mania in this State for laying out new towns. ' The proprietor of the \"Gen- eral Wayne Tavern,\" on the Lancaster turnpike, sold his property, including fifty acres of land, to a party of speculators for the fancy price of $16,000, who laid out a town (on paper), to which they gave the name of Moscow, after the Russian town of that name which had been recently destroyed by fire to prevent its occupation by Napoleon Bonaparte. The speculation failed, and \"Cossack Street\" again be- came the Lancaster turnpike and the others with Russian names were lost in the bosom of the farm. It was on this property that Mr. Latta built the Moscow Academy in 1826, and there that young Agnew received the foundation of a good classical education. From there he was sent to Jefferson College at Canonsburg, Pa., an institution then the centre of Presbyterian influence in Western Pennsyl- vania, and as such influenced his parents in choos- ing a school to complete the education of their son, together with the fact that the Rev. James Ramsay, a relative, was a trustee. He did not stay to graduate as had been intended, but left to enter Newark Col- lege, which had just been opened at Newark, Del. (now Delaware College), under the auspices of the State, and of which his cousin, Rev. John Holmes Agnew, had been elected Professor of Languages. He resigned his position when he discovered that the College was supported in part by the proceeds of a lottery, and there being no special inducement for his young cousin to stay, he left before graduat- ing. He now felt that he had reached the age when he could prepare for the profession which had been the dream of his boyhood. After studying some"
