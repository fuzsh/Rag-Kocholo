Morrisville Airport '47.”\n\nJeanne Plate reported, “I found the photo in my mother's photo album from her teenage years. She lived near Morrisville in the 1940s.\n\nI can find nothing about Rusty Austin, either as a pilot or an actress, but from the quote that was included about Blue Skies, I'm guessing [she was a] pilot.\n\nI'm wondering if Ms. Austin was there for some kind of promotional event for the airport.\n\nMy mother would have been about 16 at the time, and I'm guessing that a female pilot would have appeared to be glamorous to her.”\n\nThe earliest aeronautical chart depiction which has been located of Morrisville Airport\n\nwas on the July 1949 NY Sectional Chart (courtesy of Ron Plante).\n\nIt depicted Morrisville as having a 2,300' unpaved runway.\n\nA 1953 aerial photo of Morrisville Airport depicted 13 light aircraft on the field.\n\nA circa early 1950s photo of Santa arriving at Morrisville Airport in a Piper Cub (courtesy of Robert Hedden).\n\nRobert Hedden recalled, “The Falls Township Fire Company held an annual Christmas Party at a restaurant near the airport.\n\nSanta, would do a fly over & wave to the kids, then he would be picked up by the fire engine & be taken to the party to distribute gifts.\n\nSanta is Fire Fighter Jules Mazaros, Fire Chief Charles 'Reds' Steiner, Fire Fighter Hugh McHugh standing on the Truck, and Fire Fighter Cy Bachman.”\n\nAccording to Nathan Sturman, Hortman Aviation was operated at Morrisville by Captain Norm Hortman & his wife Yvette.\n\n\"Norm was a very senior TWA Captain,\n\nhis French wife Yvette & he were well known to Philadelphia-area fliers,\n\nespecially the latter's legendary caution in supervising pilots & students/customers.\n\nHortman Aviation was famous in the 1950s for its line of yellow Cubs parked by Route 1.\"\n\nA 1956 photo by Joe Lyons II of Joe Lyons III in front of the Morrisville Airport hangar,\n\nwith a biplane, a Piper Cub, and several other aircraft inside the hangar.\n\nA 1957 aerial photo of Morrisville Airport depicted 10 light aircraft on the field.\n\nA 1958 aerial photo of Morrisville Airport depicted a dozen light aircraft on the field,\n\nas well as the hangar with the checkerboard-painted roof.\n\nThe 1959 Philadelphia Local Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of Chris Kennedy)\n\ndepicted Morrisville as having a 2,100' unpaved runway.\n\nGeorge Johnson recalled of Morrisville Airport, “Norm & Yvette Hortman hired me in 1961 for my 1st instructor job.\n\nThree years & many new friends later, I was lucky enough to get hired by UAL.”\n\nThe 1962 AOPA Airport Directory (based on a latest report from 1960) described Morrisville as having a single 2,100' turf Runway 9/27.\n\nThe field was said to offer fuel, major repairs, and charter. The operator was listed as the Aero Dusting Corp.\n\nA 1963 aerial photo of Morrisville Airport depicted a total of 12 light aircraft on the field.\n\nThe 1967 NY Sectional Chart (courtesy of Mike Keefe) depicted Morrisville Airport as having a 2,200' unpaved runway.\n\nA November 1967 photo by George Baczkowski of a Fokker DR1 triplane replica at Morrisville.\n\nA circa 1960s advertisement for Hortman Aviation at Morrisville Airport (courtesy of Robert Hedden).\n\nThe last photo which has been located showing aircraft at Morrisville Airport was a 1970 aerial view,\n\nwhich showed only 3 single-engine aircraft on the field.\n\nAccording to Nathan Sturman, Morrisville Airport was closed (for reasons unknown) at some point in 1970.\n\nWhen Morrisville Airport closed, Hortman Aviation moved to nearby 3M Airport.\n\nAn 11/11/71 aerial view appeared to depict Morrisville Airport after it had been abandoned,\n\nbut the field was otherwise still intact, with a single east/west grass runway,\n\nand some small buildings on the southeast corner of the property.\n\nThe last aeronautical chart depiction which has been located of Morrisville Airport was on the June 1972 NY Sectional Chart (courtesy of Carl Buick),\n\neven though Morrisville Airport had reportedly been closed for 2 years by that point.\n\nMorrisville Airport was depicted as a private airfield having a 2,200' unpaved runway.\n\nMorrisville Airport was no longer depicted on the January 1973 NY Sectional Chart (courtesy of Ron Plante).\n\nPaul Campbell recalled, “Morrisville Airport may have been abandoned by the mid-1970s but you would occasionally see a airplane fly in or out.”\n\nA circa 1976-77 photo of Falls Township Assistant Fire Chief Sherwood Taylor & Robert Hedden operating at a brush fire at Morrisville Airport (courtesy of Robert Hedden).\n\nRobert Hedden recalled, “The airfield was a site of numerous brush fires.”\n\nPaul Campbell recalled, “Morrisville Airport didn't get developed until the mid-1980s.”\n\nA 1984 aerial view showed that a residential neighborhood had covered the site of Morrisville Airport ,\n\nand no trace appeared to remain of the former airport.\n\nA single runway at Morrisville Airport was still depicted on the 1986 USGS topo map, labeled simply as \"Airport\",\n\neven though a residential neighborhood had covered the airport site for a few years by that point.\n\nA 2019 aerial view did not depict any trace of Morrisville Airport.\n\nThe site of Morrisville Airport is located north of the intersection of West Trenton Drive & Lincoln Highway.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nSilver Star Airport / Old Star Airport, Langhorne, PA\n\n40.18, -74.88 (Northeast of Northeast Philadelphia Airport, PA)\n\nA 1927 aerial view looking southeast at Silver Star Airport (courtesy of Adam Raines).\n\nThe date of construction of this general aviation airport has not been determined.\n\nThe earliest depiction which has been located of the Silver Star Airport was a 1927 aerial view looking southeast (courtesy of Adam Raines).\n\nIt depicted Silver Star Airport as being a rectangular grass field with a few small hangars on the southwest side.\n\nA 1928 photo (courtesy of Bill Engle Jr.) of his father William H. Engle with his Waco 9 biplane at Silver Star Airport.\n\nA 1929 aerial view (courtesy of Bill Engle Jr.) of Silver Star Airport, showing a hangar & a small building on the edge of a grass airfield.\n\nThe earliest aeronautical chart depiction which has been located of Silver Star Airport was on the August 1932 NY Sectional Chart.\n\nThe earliest airport directory listing which has been located of Silver Star Airport\n\nwas in The Airport Directory Company's 1937 Airports Directory (courtesy of Bob Rambo).\n\nIt described Silver Star Airport as having two 1,500' sod runways, oriented north/south & northwest/southeast.\n\nA hangar was said to have \"Silver Star Airport Langhorne\" painted on the roof.\n\nA 3/28/18 photo by Bill Engle Jr. of a bracelet (dated 1937 on the back) engraved “Esther V Engle [his mother], Silver Star Aviation, Langhorne, PA.”\n\nBill Engle Jr. recalled, “My Dad, William H. Engle, owned the airport at that time.”\n\nA 1/3/38 aerial photo (courtesy of Chris Kennedy) depicted Silver Star Airport as being an irregularly-shaped grass field,\n\nwith an airport circle marking in the northwest corner.\n\nA 1938 postmark commemorating the Silver Star Airport (courtesy of the Langhorne Historical Society, via Jay Cooke).\n\nAn article in the 5/5/38 issue of the Delaware Valley Advance (courtesy of the Langhorne Historical Society, via Jay Cooke)\n\nreported of the 1st dispatch of air mail from a local airport, Silver Star Airport.\n\nIt was described as a \"great historical event\".\n\nThe 1st air mail flight from Silver Star was said to be conducted by pilot William Engle.\n\nA circa 1930s colorized photo of pilot William Engle in front of a biplane (model unidentified) of Silver Star Air Service (courtesy of Bill Engle Jr).\n\nAccording to Bill Engle Jr., “The picture might be around the time of the first air mail dispatch mentioned [above].”\n\nA 10/14/40 aerial view looking southwest at Silver Star Airport from the 1945 AAF Airfield Directory (courtesy of Scott Murdock)\n\ndepicted the field as an open grass area.\n\nGeorge Erkes recalled, “I had my first airplane ride in 1941 at the Silver Star Airport in a 2-place Taylorcraft piloted by Don Thompson. The airport was then owned by Bill Engle.”\n\nThe earliest aeronautical chart depiction which has been located of Silver Star Airport\n\nwas on the November 1942 NY Sectional Chart (courtesy of Ron Plate),\n\nwhich depicted Silver Star as an auxiliary airfield.\n\nGeorge Erkes recalled, “From 1942-45 the airport was closed due to the war.”\n\nSilver Star Airport was described in the April 1944 US Army/Navy Directory of Airfields (courtesy of Ken Mercer)\n\nas having a 2,400' unpaved runway.\n\nThe 1945 AAF Airfield Directory (courtesy of Scott Murdock) described Silver Star Airport\n\nas an 80 acre irregularly-shaped property within which were 3 sod runways, the longest being a 2,400' northwest/southeast strip.\n\nThe field was said to have 2 wood hangars, with the largest measuring 75' x 30'.\n\nSilver Star Airport was described as being privately owned, but not currently in operation.\n\nSilver Star Airport was still depicted on the 1945 NY Sectional Chart (courtesy of Norman Freed).\n\nBill Engle Jr. recalled, “My Dad, William H. Engle, sold the airport to my Uncle, John VanSant.”\n\nGeorge Erkes recalled, “The airport reopened in 1945 when John VanSant bought the airport & changed the name to Old Star Airport.\n\nHe had a very active GI flight school after the war & my brother Bill & I worked there while learning to fly.\n\nWe both got our private licenses there in 1946 & Bill worked there as a flight instructor until 1953. I got my multi-engine rating there in 1948.\n\nI remember Rod Jocelyn practicing aerobatics in his Greatlakes biplane before he won the National Aerobatics Championship in 1948.\n\nJohn VanSant was the Flying Farmer in the J-3 Cub & he put on many airshow demonstrations when he was not hauling passengers in his Waco F & Waco UPF7.”\n\nThe last depiction which has been located of the field as Silver Star Airport was on the 1947 USGS topo map.\n\nGeorge Erkes recalled, “I have one picture of the airport crew in 1948 with a UC-78 (T-50) in the background.\n\nIn the photo we have John & Emma VanSant; flight instructors, Sam Tomlinson, Faust Cappabinco & Bill Erkes; mechanics, John Bushel & Stanley Pratt & Shorty O'Toole & myself.\n\nMy brother Frank also worked at the airport in the early 1950s, and he too learned to fly there.”\n\nLynn Gentzsch recalled, “Silver Star / Old Star... I remember that Stearman & there was also a WWII glider, several Piper Cubs.\n\nAll the planes were lined up along Lincoln Highway (Route 1).”\n\nThe 1950 NY Sectional Chart (courtesy of Chris Kennedy) depicted Old Star Airport as having a 2,300' unpaved runway.\n\nA circa 1940s-50s photo taken from Route 1 looking northwest at several aircraft (including a T-6 Texan) at Old Star Airport\n\n(courtesy of Deborah Jordan, whose father - George Rice - worked at Old Star).\n\nDeborah said, “I remember him taking my brother & I out there when we were real small... in the early 1950s.”\n\nA 1953 aerial view depicted 16 light aircraft at Old Star Airport.\n\nA 1958 aerial view depicted a dozen light aircraft at Old Star Airport.\n\nA 1958-59 photo by Ray Clark of his 1953 Austin in front of a Myers OTW biplane & a hangar at Old Star Airport.\n\nRat recalled, “In 1958 or 1959 I went over to Old Star Airport. I was a Cadet 1st Lt with the Summerton Civil Air Patrol Squadron 1015 checking tail numbers looking for an overdue flight.”\n\nOld Star Airport, as depicted on the 1959 Philadelphia Local Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of Chris Kennedy).\n\nLindsey Parsons operated a PJ-260 aerobatic biplane from Old Star Airport.\n\nHe recalled, \"It's home field was Old Star Airport in Langhorne.\n\nThe single runway was 2,600', sod, and on about a 2% uphill grade when taking off in a normal prevailing wind.\n\nI could start the roll at the far end of the strip, be airborne about half way up the hill,\n\nhalf roll the bird at the end of the runway\n\nand immediately push it up through a half outside loop to complete the 'initial climb out'.\n\nThis was spectacular performance back in the early sixties!\"\n\nFinton Thompson recalled, \"I did quite a bit of flying with my uncle out of Old Star Airport in Langhorne.\n\nOld Star was located adjacent on the west side of US Route 1\n\nabout one mile north of the intersection of Route 1 & Woodburne Road.\n\nI often rode my bicycle over to Old Star & spent many hours watching the construction of & flying of the PJ-260's.\n\nThere was also an old 'character' that flew out of there in his Boeing Stearman - just like an old barnstormer.\n\nHeck, Old Star even hosted airshows & I clearly remember seeing the 'Flying Farmer' routine flown from the rear seat of a J-3 Cub.\n\nMy 'passenger' logbook shows flights in & out of Old Star as well as 3M & Buehl Field (Bensalem)\n\nduring 1961-62 in a Piper PA-15 Vagabond that belonged to a friend of my uncle's.\"\n\nNathan Sturman recalled \"Rod Jocelyn, who flew aerobatics out of Old Star.\"\n\nA 1965 aerial view depicted 22 light aircraft at Old Star Airport.\n\nThe March 1966 NY Sectional Chart depicted Old Star Airport as having a 2,400' unpaved runway.\n\nBoth Old Star Airport & nearby Buehl Field were still depicted on the 1966 USGS topo map.\n\nOld Star Airport was depicted as having 2 unpaved runways, with a few small buildings on the south side.\n\nIt is possible that Old Star Airport may have closed (possibly temporarily) at some point in 1966,\n\nas it was no longer depicted on the September 1966 Philadelphia Local Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of John Ferrara).\n\nA circa 1966-67 photo from the Langhorne Air Show at Old Star Airport (courtesy of Gary Fitton)\n\nshowing a German Messerschmitt Bf 108 tailing a North American AT-6 in British markings.\n\nA circa 1966-67 photo from the Langhorne Air Show at Old Star Airport (courtesy of Gary Fitton)\n\nshowing Eric Lorentzen bringing in his North American AT-6 in British markings.\n\nBoth Old Star Airport & nearby Buehl Field were still depicted on the 1969 USGS topo map.\n\nA 1969 photo by Richard Thal of his beautiful 1969 Stingray & his restored J3C65 in front of the old hangar at the top of Old Star's entrance road.\n\nRichard recalled, “Flew 175 hours with that Cub out of Old Star.\n\nI moved the plane to Buehl Field in 1971, because Old Star was closing. The rumor was a mall was to be built.\n\nI still have that 1969 – it looks just as good.”\n\nGary Fitton recalled, “Old Star... I have some 8mm movies of an airshow there in 1970, with aerobatics in a Chipmunk & a T-33 flyby.\n\nA co-worker had a disassembled Pitcairn PA-18 Autogiro in one of the hangars.”\n\nThe last aeronautical chart depiction which has been located of Old Star Airport was on the April 1970 NY Sectional Chart.\n\nIt depicted the field as having a 2,400' unpaved runway.\n\nBill Cawthorne recalled, “I was flying at Old Star until 12/5/70. Fred Lewis was my instructor.\n\nThe airport 'manager' was C.J. Alexander, who I named my 4th son Alex after.\n\nThe tumble-down hangars had a curious collection of aircraft\n\nsuch as a Pitcairn Autogiro whose fabric was in shreds, a Belanca Viking (3-tailed ) owned by a Mr. Applegate\n\nand a Globe Swift & Stinson Reliant being rebuilt in the large hangar on the hill.\n\nThe 'locked' hangar on the hill was home to various parts of what had to be an extreme aerobatic biplane.\n\nI drove the fuel truck during the last airshow there.\n\nAt any given time, people would stop by in an array of aviation history.\n\nThe engine trailer had pictures of aviation pioneers like Gabby Grabeski by a P-51. I spent my entire high school years there.\n\nI flew a Tripacer N3339Z , a PA-18 Super Cub N9891D, and a PA-28-140 Cherokee N6436R owned by C. J.\n\nI was the airport orphan & if mom wanted to know where I was, she started at Old Star & asked who I was flying with.\n\nThe further you got from the hangars on the flightline the less the airplanes saw their owners.\n\nSome were in a sad state. Most were flyable. I arrived with a passion for aviation that has not diminished.”\n\nTom Barney recalled, “Old Star was still open in the early 1970s; a friend & I were the last pilots to solo from that airport.\n\nOur instructor was Fred Lewis. I think we soloed in 1970 or 1971.”\n\nAn 8/7/71 aerial view showed Old Star Airport to be very well-used, with a total of over 30 light aircraft visible on the field.\n\nThe airfield consisted of 2 grass runways.\n\nWalt Stepek recalled, “On a weekend afternoon as I drove down Route 1 I heard a roar,\n\nlooked to my right & saw a P-51 going straight up into the air (or so it seemed, anyway).\n\nIt turned out there was an airshow at Old Star airport that day, and judging by the time it must have been the last ever there.”\n\nLynn Gentzsch recalled, “When he [Johnny VanSant] sold out to the Oxford Valley Mall, he opened VanSant Airport in Erwinna.”\n\nOld Star Airport evidently was closed at some point between 1971-73,\n\nas it was no longer depicted on the January 1973 NY Sectional Chart,\n\nand the 1973 USGS topo map showed that the Oxford Valley Mall had been built just north of the former Old Star Airport,\n\nwhich was no longer depicted.\n\nThe 1994 USGS aerial view showed the Oxford Valley Mall which had been built just north of the former Old Star Airport,\n\nof which no obvious trace remained.\n\nJay Cooke reported in 2001 that \"The stone farm house used as an [airport] office is still there on a used car lot.\"\n\nThere do not appear to be any other remaining traces of Old Star Airport.\n\nA 4/10/10 aerial view of the site of Old Star Airport did not depict any trace of the former airport.\n\nThe site of Old Star Airport Airport is located north of the intersection of Woodbourne Road & Maple Avenue,\n\njust south of the Oxford Valley Mall.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nSomerton Airport / Flying Dutchman Field, Philadelphia, PA\n\n40.11, -75.02 (Northwest of Northeast Philadelphia Airport, PA)\n\nSomerton Airport, as depicted on the Philly Chamber of Commerce's\n\n1930 \"Aviation Map of the Philadelphia Metro District\" (courtesy of Tom Beamer).\n\n“Somerton Airport was founded by [Ernest] Buelh in 1928”\n\naccording to a circa 1930s brochure for Flying Dutchman Air Service (courtesy of Mark Hess).\n\nThe earliest depiction of Somerton Airport which has been located\n\nwas on the Philly Chamber of Commerce's 1930 \"Aviation Map of the Philadelphia Metro District\" (courtesy of Tom Beamer).\n\nThe airfield layout of \"Somerton (Flying Dutchman) Field\",\n\nfrom the 1930 book \"Philadelphia Aeronautical Center of the East\"\n\n(courtesy of the George H.

Jovanovich) were formerly with the Piasecki Company (another Philadelphia-area company which pioneered vertical flight).\n\nBoulevard Airport was closed on 10/4/51 (according to John Bircher).\n\nAn article in that night's issue of the Evening Standard newspaper (courtesy of John Bircher)\n\nwas entitled \"Auction at City's 1st Airport Clears Way for Housing\".\n\nThe article read, \"The buildings & equipment of Boulevard Airport, Philadelphia's first,\n\nwere auctioned off yesterday to make way for a housing development on the site at Roosevelt Boulevard & Red Lion Road.\n\nMore than 100 bidders paid a total of $14,200 for the several hundred items in the sale.\n\nThe biggest price, $7,000, was paid for the 70' x 90' main hangar, which had originally been set up at what is now International Airport.\n\nIssac Schlossbach of the Asbury Park Air Terminal paid $1,560 for 6 individual airplane hangars.\"\n\nRay Clark recalled, “Between when Boulevard closed & before it became a strip mall we used it for flying model planes.”\n\nBoulevard Airport was no longer depicted at all on the July 1952 NY Sectional Chart (courtesy of Mike Keefe).\n\nA 1953 aerial view showed that houses had been constructed along the northern portion of the Boulevard Airport site.\n\nThe 6 individual T-hangars had been removed at some point between 1950-53,\n\nbut the checkerboard-painted hangar remained standing.\n\nThe Helicopter Engineering Research Corporation was eventually acquired by McCulloch Motors Company in 1957.\n\nA 1958 aerial photo showed that more houses had begun to cover the western half of the former airport property.\n\nThe checkerboard-pained hangar had been demolished at some point between 1953-58,\n\nbut its foundation was still evident on the eastern side of the site.\n\nThomas Delahanty recalled of Boulevard Airport, “I live in the housing development that was built at the airfield location.\n\nI was born there in 1961 & moved back into the house that was built in 1958 after my parents left me the house in their will.\n\nI remember playing 'army men' in the field amongst the old foundation of the demolished hangar\n\nand even remember the remains of an old plane which sat on its belly next to it.\n\nThis was the 1960s & the old airfield was my whole world! Like a giant playground.\n\nIt was a different world back then & stay-at-home moms would let us kids run free all day in the summer time back there.\n\nMy oldest brother remembered the airport as well.\n\nHe used to fly model airplanes back there in the early 1960s.”\n\nAerial photos from 1965 & 1967 showed the field in much the same condition as 1958,\n\nwith houses covering the western half of the airport site,\n\nand the hangar foundation remaining on the eastern corner.\n\nBy the time of an 1971 aerial photo, the site of Boulevard Airport had been covered with a shopping center & a residential development,\n\nand not a trace appeared to remain of the former airport.\n\nA 4/12/10 aerial view no longer depicted any trace of the former Boulevard Airport.\n\nA 2018 photo by Tom Delahanty of the historical marker erected on 5/19/18 on the site of Bustleton Field\n\nby the Friends of Northeast Philadelphia History for the occasion of the airport's Centennial Celebration.\n\nTom reported, “It's located on the southeast corner of Haldeman Avenue & Red Lion Road, next to the Wendy’s Restaurant.”\n\nThe site of Boulevard Airport is located on the west corner of the intersection of Roosevelt Boulevard & Red Lion Road.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nBudd Factory Airfield, Philadelphia, PA\n\n40.11, -75.04 (Northwest of Northeast Philadelphia Airport, PA)\n\nA 10/8/42 aerial view which appears to show the Budd Red Lion Factory while under construction,\n\nwith a single northeast/southwest runway also under construction.\n\nThe Edward G. Budd Manufacturing Company was a major manufacturer of railroad cars.\n\nThe Budd Company decided to apply their manufacturing experience\n\nwith stainless steel to the manufacturing of aircraft.\n\nTheir initial entry into the world of aeronautics was made in 1930\n\nthrough the contract manufacture of aircraft wheels & stainless steel wing ribs.\n\nThe 1st complete aircraft designed & built by Budd was the BB-1 Pioneer amphibian,\n\na single example of which (NR749N) was built in 1931.\n\nThe Pioneer was powered by a single 210hp Kinner C-5 motor,\n\nand used design concepts from the Savoia-Marchetti S-31.\n\nBudd's stainless steel construction aircraft construction process was patented (US patent #2,425,498 in 1942).\n\nIndeed this was the world's 1st stainless steel aircraft, truly making it a \"Pioneer\".\n\nBudd's Red Lion Plant was built shortly after the start of World War II in 1942, on 572 acres of farmland in the Far Northeast section of Philadelphia.\n\nThe complex was built by the United States Government & was operated by the Budd Company.\n\nThe earliest depiction which has been located of the Budd Factory Airfield was a 10/8/42 aerial view,\n\nwhich appeared to show the Budd Red Lion Factory while under construction,\n\nwith a single northeast/southwest runway also under construction to the north of the factory.\n\nAnother runway was eventually added, oriented Northwest/Southeast.\n\nThe Budd Airfield was not yet depicted on the November 1942 NY Sectional Chart.\n\nThe Budd Factory Airfield was opened in 1943, according to ExplorePaHistory.com.\n\nA circa 1940s artist's conception looking northeast at the Budd Red Lion Factory, with 2 runways visible behind the factory.\n\nThe Budd RB-1 Conestoga, manufactured in the Philadelphia plant.\n\nDuring WW2, Budd again saw an opportunity to apply its stainless steel construction experience to aircraft once again,\n\nand the result was the Budd RB-1 Conestoga cargo aircraft,\n\nthe 1st mass-produced aircraft constructed primarily of stainless steel.\n\nThe Conestoga was also significant in that it was the 1st modern military cargo aircraft\n\nto adopt a configuration which has become the standard in post-WW2 military cargo aircraft,\n\nwith a high wing, and a rear ramp facilitating easy loading of cargo.\n\nThis is the exact configuration still used by almost all post-WW2 military cargo aircraft (C-123, C-130, C-17, etc.).\n\nThe 1st flight of the RB-1 Conestoga was in 1943, piloted by Guy Miller.\n\nInitially 3 prototypes of the Conestoga were built.\n\nThe earliest aeronautical chart depiction of the Budd airfield which has been located was on the May 1943 NY Sectional Chart.\n\nIt depicted Budd as a commercial/municipal airfield.\n\nDavid Leidel recalled, \"My father was a Flight Test Engineer on the RB-1 at Budd Field during the latter stages of WW2.\n\nThey had a lot of problems with the Budd ship & his flight log tells quite a tale.\"\n\nA circa 1943-44 photo of the interior of the Budd Red Lion Factory, showing the RB-1 Conestoga assembly line.\n\nUnfortunately, the Conestoga was not a success, due to undesirable handling qualities.\n\nA total of 17 examples of the RB-1 were produced by Budd for the Navy, the last of which was delivered in March of 1944,\n\nand a further contract for 180 examples was canceled.\n\nBudd's facility had the WW2 USAAF code of “BU”.\n\nA circa 1940s aerial view looking east at the Budd Red Lion Factory, with one runway visible behind the factory.\n\nA circa 1940s photo

Service (WAVE)\n\nand Winifred Thompson from the Women’s Army Corps (WAC).\n\nA total of 14 war-surplus Budd RB-1s eventually became the starting point of Robert Prescott's Flying Tiger Airlines in 1945.\n\nThe 1945 AAF Airfield Directory (courtesy of Scott Murdock) described Budd Field\n\nas a 565 acre irregularly-shaped property within which were two 4,400' asphalt runways, oriented east/west & NNW/SSE.\n\nThe field was said to have a single concrete 126' x 37' hangar.\n\nBudd Field was described as being owned by the Defense Plant Corporation, but not currently in operation.\n\nA 1946 USGS map depicted the outline of Budd Airfield,\n\nas well as several nearby airports: Somerton Airfield, Boulevard Airfield, and Northeast Philadelphia Airfield.\n\nAfter WW2, Budd abandoned the manufacturing of aircraft,\n\nand the plant was once again retooled to produce automobile frames & railroad cars.\n\nA 1948 aerial view depicted the Budd Airfield as completely intact.\n\nRunways 9/27 & 16/34 were marked as active,\n\nand “Budd, Tower 317 K.C.” was painted in large letters on the runway intersection.\n\nThere were no aircraft visible on the field.\n\nThe Red Lion Plant, previously leased from the government, was bought outright by Budd in 1948.\n\nThe earliest aeronautical chart depiction of the Budd airfield which has been located was on the January 1949 NY Sectional Chart.\n\nIt depicted Budd as having a 4,400' paved runway.\n\nThe Budd Airfield was apparently closed at some point in 1949,\n\nas it was no longer depicted on the July 1949 NY Sectional Chart (courtesy of Ron Plante).\n\nThe 1950 USGS topo map depicted 2 unpaved runways, labeled as “Airport (Abandoned)”.\n\nThe last photo which has been located showed the Budd Airfield remaining completely intact was a 3/17/50 USGS aerial view.\n\nIt showed that closed-runway “X” markings had been added to each runway end at some point between 1948-50,\n\nbut the “Budd, Tower 317 K.C.” was still perceptible (but faded) on the runway intersection.\n\nA 1953 aerial view showed that the western & southern halves of the runways were being used to store unidentified objects.\n\nA road had been cut over the southeastern portion of Runway 34 at some point between 1950-53.\n\nA 1958 aerial photo depicted the Budd Factory Airfield while it was still mostly intact,\n\nwith the majority of the length of both paved runways still intact.\n\nAn circa 1950s photo of the Budd BB-1 Pioneer, as it sat mounted on a pylon outside the Franklin Institute (courtesy of Tom Beamer).\n\nSadly, according to Tom Beamer, the sole example of the Budd Pioneer sat outside on a mounting\n\nin front of Philadelphia's Franklin Institute for a long time.\n\nThis eventually led to the loss of the Pioneer's lower wing & empennage fabric, deteriorated by time & weather.\n\n\"By the time I saw it in the 1970s both wings were bare.\"\n\nBy the 1960s the former Budd airfield was used to store railcar frames.\n\nA 1965 aerial view showed that residential construction had begun on the northeastern end of Runway 27.\n\nA 1967 aerial view showed that houses covered the northeastern portion of the airfield site.\n\nThe runways at the Budd plant were not depicted at all on the 1969 USGS topo map.\n\nAn 8/7/71 aerial photo showed that most of the length of the 2 paved runways of the former Budd Factory Airfield still remained intact,\n\nwith the factory & numerous other industrial buildings remaining on the southern side of the property.\n\nResidential construction had started to cover a middle portion of the former northwest/southeast runway.\n\nIn the 1980s the plant was sold to TransitAmerica Corporation in an attempt to reverse its declining fortunes.\n\nThat attempt was unsuccessful.\n\nIn April 1988, the last rail car rolled out of the Budd Red Lion plant,\n\naccording to “Living in the Past”, an article by Harry Silcox in the 10/9/08 issue of the Northeast Times.\n\nOn the following Friday, the last labor contract covering the workers expired.\n\nThe plant soon closed.\n\nThe facility sat vacant for several years, as attempts to sell it again met with no takers.\n\nThe runways at the Budd plant were not depicted at all on the 1983 or 1988 USGS topo maps.\n\nA 1992 USGS aerial view looking northeast showed the Budd factory was still standing,\n\nand most of the East-Northeast/West-Southwest runway was still discernible, as was the southern half of the Northwest/Southeast runway.\n\nSeveral more recent buildings had been built at some point over the northern half of that runway.\n\nA 1999 aerial view showed the Budd factory & runway remains still intact.\n\nTransitAmerica razed the Budd factory in 1999, and a golf course was constructed on the site.\n\nA 2002 aerial view showed a golf course covering the site of Budd Factory Airfield,\n\nwith not a trace remaining of the airplane factory or its airfield.\n\nA 2017 aerial view looking northeast showed the golf course on the site of Budd Factory Airfield had evidently been closed,\n\nwith the property awaiting yet another redevelopment, presumably for ever more housing.\n\nThe Budd Company factory was located north of the intersection of Red Lion Road & Sandmeyer Lane, just 2 miles northeast from Northeast Philadelphia Airport,\n\ndirectly along the extended centerline of PNE's Runway

-74.94 (Northeast of Philadelphia, PA)\n\nBuehl Field, as depicted at is original location in Bensalem on the January 1947 NY Sectional Chart.\n\nThe original location of Buehl Field was on the southeast corner of Street Road & Hulmeville Road in Bensalem.\n\nAccording to Mark Taylor, Ernest Buehl “purchased the property in 1941.”\n\nBuehl Field was not yet depicted on the July 1946 NY Sectional Chart, or the 1947 USGS topo map.\n\nThe earliest depiction of Buehl Field which has been located was on the January 1947 NY Sectional Chart.\n\nAccording to Mark Taylor, Buelh Field “opened 3/1/47.”\n\nBuehl Field was operated by Flying Dutchman Air Service,\n\nwhose manager, Ernest Buehl, also operated nearby Somerton Airport until Febrtuary 1952.\n\nA 1952 aerial view looking north at Buehl Field (courtesy of Laurie VanSant)\n\ndepicted the field as having 2 grass runways, with 2 hangars along the west side of the field & 2 on the southeast.\n\nA 1952 aerial view of a hangar marked “Buehl Field” (courtesy of Laurie VanSant)\n\nwith a biplane & a monoplane parked nearby.\n\nA 1953 aerial view depicted Buehl Field as having 2 grass runways, with 3 hangars along the west side of the field & 2 on the southeast.\n\nA total of 3 single-engine aircraft were visible on the field.\n\nThe 1955 USGS topo map depicted Buehl Field as having 3 unpaved runways, with 3 hangars along the west side of the field & 2 on the southeast.\n\nThe 1957 Washington Sectional Chart (courtesy of Mike Keefe) described Buehl Field as having 3 turf runways,\n\nwith the longest being the 2,500' north/south strip.\n\nThe operator was listed as Flying Dutchman Air Service, and the manager was listed as Ernest Buehl.\n\nThe Aerodromes table on the 1958 NY Sectional Chart (courtesy of Norman Freed)\n\ndescribed Buehl Field as having a total of 4 turf runways, with the longest being a 2,700' strip.\n\nA 1958 aerial view depicted Buehl Field as having 2 grass runways,\n\nwith 2 hangars along the west side of the field & 2 on the southeast, and 7 light aircraft were visible.\n\nAccording to Mark Taylor, Ernest Buehl's sale of Buehl Field “was announced on 8/10/60.”\n\nThe last depiction which has been located of the original Buehl Field\n\nwas on the 1961 Philadelphia Local Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of Tim Zukas).\n\nIt depicted Buehl Field as having a 2,500' unpaved runway.\n\nBuehl Field was apparently closed at this location at some point between 1961-63,\n\nas it was no longer depicted on the October 1963 Philly Local Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of Boom Powell).\n\nA 1965 aerial view showed that all except one of Buehl's hangars had been removed at some point between 1958-65,\n\nand residential construction had begun on the eastern half of the airport property.\n\nA 1967 aerial view showed that the last hangar had been removed at some point between 1965-67,\n\nand houses covered the eastern half of the site.\n\nBut the runway intersection was still visible on the western half,\n\nas the last recognizable remnant of Buehl Field.\n\nBy 1967 Buehl Field had reopened at a new location in Woodbourne (5 miles to the northeast).\n\nBy the time of a 1970 aerial photo, the original location of Buehl Field had been redeveloped as the Brookwood Shopping Center & a housing development,\n\nwith not a trace remaining of the former airport.\n\nA 4/12/10 aerial photo shows that the site has been densely redeveloped,\n\nwith no trace remaining of the airfield.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nBuehl Field (N54) (Woodbourne location), Woodbourne, PA\n\n40.189, -74.9 (Northeast of Philadelphia, PA)\n\nBoth Buehl Field & nearby Old Star Airport were depicted on the 1966 USGS topo map.\n\nA 1958 aerial view did not yet depict an airfield at this location.\n\nAccording to Mark Taylor, Ernest Buehl purchased the Buehl Field Woodbourne “land in December 1960, and took full possession in December 1961.\n\nBuehl planned to open 6/15/62.\n\nHe had support from FAA, AOPA, the PA State Aviation Commission, the Aviation Council of Pennsylvania, the Civil Air Patrol,\n\nand the Middletown Township Commercial & Industrial Development Commission but the Township Board of Supervisors blocked approval.\n\nThe runway was paved in 1964 but was not completely finished because Buehl was blocked by the Township.”\n\nThe earliest depiction which has been located of Buehl Field in Woodbourne was a 1965 aerial view,\n\nwhich depicted a single unpaved northeast/southwest runway, with a single hangar on the northwest side.\n\nNo aircraft were visible on the field.\n\nThe March 1966 NY Sectional Chart (courtesy of Mike Keefe) did not yet depict an airfield at this location.\n\nThe earliest topo map depiction which has been located of Buehl Field at this location was on the 1966 USGS topo map.\n\nIt depicted Buehl Field as having a single paved northeast/southwest runway, with a building on the northwest side.\n\nThe earliest aeronautical chart depiction which has been located of Buehl Field at this location\n\nwas on the October 1966 Philadelphia Local Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of John Ferrara).\n\nIt depicted Buehl as having a 3,200' unpaved runway.\n\nThe Aerodromes table on the March 1967 NY Sectional Chart (courtesy of Mike Keefe) described Buehl as having a single 3,250' turf Runway 4/22.\n\nAccording to Jay Cooke, the Flying Dutchman Air Service began operating at Buehl Field in Woodbourne in approximately 1967,\n\nafter having relocated from the original Buehl Field location in Bensalem (5 miles to the southwest).\n\nAccording to Mark Taylor, “It was late 1967 that the township agreed to a plan to open the airport, but this was challenged again in 1968.”\n\nThe runway at Buehl was paved at some point within the next 3 years,\n\nas the 1970 Washington Sectional Chart (courtesy of John Clifford) depicted Buehl as having a 3,200' paved runway.\n\nAn 8/7/71 aerial photo depicted Buehl Field as having a single paved Runway 6/24,\n\nwith several hangars on the northwest side of the field, and over 20 light aircraft visible on the field.\n\nBuehl Field was depicted on the 1973 USGS topo map as having a single paved northeast/southwest runway,\n\nand several buildings along the north side of the field.\n\nThe February 1975 Philadelphia Terminal Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of Mitchell Hymowitz)\n\ndepicted Buehl Field as having a single 3,200' paved runway.\n\nAccording to Bob Zambelli, \"I did my instrument checkride at Buehl Field at its last location.\n\nI was signed off by Beth-Ann Buehl, a very competent & attractive lady\n\nwho was one of the most enthusiastic 'airplane people' I've ever met.\"\n\nA September 1991 photo of Marybeth Campbell walking Fred in front of the Flying Dutchman sign at Buehl Airport (courtesy of Paul Campbell).\n\nPaul Cambell also recalled, “The Buehl's had a pair of dachshunds that ran free on the airport property chasing whatever they could find.”\n\nThe March 1993 Washington Sectional Chart (courtesy of Carl Taylor) depicted Buehl Field as having a single 3,200' paved runway.\n\nA 1994 airport directory depicted Buehl Field as having a single paved 3,121' Runway 6/24,\n\nalong with a paved ramp & a small group of hangars north of the runway.\n\nThe operator was listed as Flying Dutchman.\n\nAccording to Tom Kramer, \"In 1995 I actually was going to base my Skyhawk there [at Buehl] & spoke to them.\n\nHowever, their fuel prices were outrageous & I looked elsewhere.\"\n\nThe 1995 Jeppesen Airport Directory depicted Buehl Field as having a single paved 3,121' Runway 6/24,\n\nalong with a paved ramp & a small group of hangars north of the runway.\n\nThe operator was listed as Flying Dutchman.\n\nA 5/13/95 USGS aerial view looking east showed Buehl Field to be quite healthy, with a total of 13 planes visible outside, including one taking off on Runway 24.\n\nThe last airport directory listing which has been located of Buehl Airport was in the 1997 PA Airport Directory (courtesy of John Clifford).\n\nIt depicted Buehl as having a 3,121' bituminous Runway 6/24.\n\nThe operator was listed as Flying Dutchman Air Service & the manager as Ernst Buehl, Jr.\n\nA beautiful 1998 aerial picture looking west at Buehl Field (shortly before its closure) by Philip Kineyko.\n\nThe last aeronautical chart depiction which has been located showing Buehl Field still open was on the August 1998 Philadelphia Terminal Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of John Ferrara).\n\nIt depicted Buehl Field as having a single 3,100' paved northeast/southwest runway.\n\nBuehl Field became yet another vanished suburban general aviation airport, as it closed at some point between 1998-99,\n\nas a 4/13/99 aerial view looking east showed Runway 6/24 marked with closed-runway “X” symbols,\n\nand all of the hangars & other airport buildings had been removed at some point between 1998-99.\n\nIt was labeled \"Buehl (Closed)\" on the 2000 Washington Sectional Chart (courtesy of Mike Keefe).\n\nAccording to Tom Kramer, \"I understand that the reason it closed\n\nwas that the original owners died off & the family didn't want to run an airport anymore.\n\nThey sold out to the builders of the Senior Citizen housing complex.\n\nIt took about a year for the airport to entirely cease to exist. Nothing remains.\"\n\nA 3/5/02 aerial view of the site showed that housing had covered the site of Buehl Airport.\n\nA September 2005 aerial view by Tom Kramer, looking northwest at the site of Buehl Field.\n\nThe property has been completely redeveloped as a senior development,\n\nthe Village at Flowers Mill, with no trace remaining of the airfield.\n\nA 2016 aerial view looking east showed no trace remaining of Buehl Field.\n\nYet another of America's hundreds of grassroots airports swallowed by our insatiable demand for more housing.\n\nThe site of Buehl Field is located west of the intersection of Route 1 & Woodbourne Road.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nKeystone / Fleetwings Factory & Seaplane Base, Bristol, PA\n\n40.11, -74.84 (Northeast of Philadelphia, PA)\n\nAn undated photo of the Huff-Daland AT-1, produced in 1925.\n\nThis aircraft manufacturing factory along the Delaware River\n\nhas gone through a confusing series of owners & corporate names.\n\nThomas Huff & Elliot Daland formed the Huff Daland Aero Corporation in 1925 in Bristol PA.\n\nHuff Daland produced a series of biplanes as trainers, observation planes, and light bombers,\n\nfor the Army & Navy.\n\nIn 1927, the Huff Daland Aero Corporation was taken over by Hayden, Stone & Co, an NYC brokerage firm,\n\nand in the same year in the course of a merger, it became the Huff-Daland Division of the Keystone Corporation.\n\nSome of the Huff-Daland designs were floatplanes,\n\nand thus could be operated from the Delaware River adjacent to the Bristol factory.\n\nHowever, many of their designs were landplanes.\n\nAn airfield for landplanes (known at various times as Keystone / Kaiser / 3M Airport)\n\nwas eventually constructed just one mile north of the Bristol plant.\n\nWithin 1927, the Huff-Daland Division of the Keystone Corporation\n\nwas known as the Keystone Aircraft Corporation.\n\nAn undated photo of the Keystone XB-1B, produced in 1927.\n\nIn 1927, a single example of the Huff-Daland XB-1 bomber became the Keystone XB-1B,\n\nafter its original Packard 2A-1530 engines were replaced with Curtiss V-1570-5 \"Conqueror\" engines.\n\nThe improved -B aircraft had better performance than the original,\n\nbut still didn't compare favorably to other aircraft of the period & never entered production.\n\nKeystone merged with the Loening Company of NY in 1928.\n\nAccording to Tom Beamer, the Fleetwings Corporation was organized in 1929,\n\nand soon thereafter became a tenant of Keystone at the Bristol plant.\n\nThe \"Keystone Aircraft Field\" & Keystone Seaplane Base, as depicted on the Philly Chamber of Commerce's\n\n1930 \"Aviation Map of the Philadelphia Metro District\" (courtesy of Tom Beamer).\n\nThe earliest chart depiction of the Fleetwings Seaplane Base that has been located\n\nwas on the Philly Chamber of Commerce's\n\n1930 \"Aviation Map of the Philadelphia Metro District\" (courtesy of Tom Beamer).\n\nThe earliest photo which has been located of the Keystone aircraft factory & seaplane base was a 9/11/30 aerial view looking west (courtesy of Tom Beamer).\n\nA closeup from the 9/11/30 aerial view of what appears to be a Keystone-Loening Commuter seaplane & a biplane\n\non the ramp in front of the hangar (courtesy of Tom Beamer).\n\nBy 1931, Keystone had become the Keystone Aircraft Division of the Curtiss-Wright Corporation.\n\nA circa 1930s aerial view (courtesy of Alan Reddig) looking east at “the Keystone (later Fleetwings) factory on the river at Bristol.\n\nThe seaplane hangar & ramp are at the upper left corner.”\n\nIn 1934, Keystone's parent, Curtiss-Wright, moved operations elsewhere,\n\nand the Keystone factory was sold to the Fleetwings Corporation.\n\nA circa 1935-39 photo (courtesy of Alan Reddig) “of the F-4 Sea Bird prototype sitting on the apron in front of the hangar at Bristol.\n\nNo registration numbers yet, so this is a very early photo.”\n\nAn undated photo of a Fleetwings F-5 Seabird, an all stainless-steel 4-place amphibian (courtesy of Tom Beamer).\n\nA total of 5 Seabirds were produced in 1936.\n\nA 12/29/37 aerial view of the Fleetwings facility.\n\nThe Fleetwings Seaplane Base was not yet depicted on the April 1938 NY Sectional Chart.\n\nHerb Twining recalled, “Upon graduating Langhorne-Middletown High School in 1938 I went to Lock Haven & worked at Piper for a bit,\n\nfrom there to Glenn L. Martin in Baltimore for a few months, and then back to Bristol working in Fleetwings.\n\nI worked there until I enlisted in the USAAC, 9/1/42. While at Fleetwings I worked in sheet metal departments, finally building wings for the Grumman Avenger.\n\nOnly a couple names come to my mind now, Bill Engle & John Scheppe. Bill was the pilot for the Seabird.\n\nIt would go down the ramp from the hangar into the Delaware River, take off, fly & return & backup the ramp to the hangar.”\n\nThe earliest aeronautical chart depiction which has been located of the Fleetwings Seaplane Base was on the November 1938 NY Sectional Chart.\n\nBill Engle Jr. recalled, “Dad [William Engle] demonstrated Fleetwings Seabird F502 to Howard Hughes in Nassau in 1939. I remember him telling me about it.”\n\nA circa 1930s-40s photo looking south at the Fleetwings seaplane hangar & aircraft factory.\n\nFleetwings built a new factory in 1941 on Green Lane at the Keystone / Kaiser / 3M Airport,\n\nand all aircraft assembly was performed at the new factory at the airport from that point on.\n\nHowever, this was not the end of their use of the Bristol factory,\n\nas Fleetwings also performed quite a bit of aircraft component manufacturing under sub-contract during WW2,\n\nincluding work for Curtiss-Wright, Republic, Martin, Vought, Brewster, Grumman and others.\n\nThey advertised sub-contracting with their large line of hydraulic metal forming equipment,\n\nwhich most likely remained at the Bristol location (not relocated to the new factory built at the airfield 1941).\n\nAccording to Tom Beamer, the Fleetwings Corporation was purchased by Kaiser in 1943,\n\nbecoming the \"Fleetwings Division of Kaiser Cargo Inc.\".\n\nThe last aeronautical chart depiction of the Fleetwings Seaplane Base that has been located was on the January 1945 NY Sectional Chart.\n\nThe Fleetwings Seaplane Base was evidently closed at some point in 1945,\n\nas it was no longer depicted on the June 1945 NY Sectional Chart.\n\nAn 8/7/71 aerial view of the former Fleetwings factory & seaplane base.\n\nA circa 2001 aerial photo showed the circa 1920s/30s Fleetings factory on the east side of the road had been removed,\n\nalong with the hangar & seaplane ramp formerly located at the north end of the complex has been removed.\n\nA January 2009 aerial view by Paul Freeman looking north at the Fleetwings factory site.\n\nAs of 2022, street maps label the former Fleetwings Factory as B&C Industries.\n\nThe Keystone / Fleetwings factory site is located along the Delaware River, southwest of the intersection of Radcliffe Street & Green Lane.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nKeystone Aircraft Field / Fleetwings Field / Kaiser Field / Kaiser NAS / 3M Airport, Levittown, PA\n\n40.13, -74.85 (Northeast of Philadelphia, PA)\n\nThe \"Keystone Aircraft Field\" & Keystone Seaplane Base, as depicted on the Philly Chamber of Commerce's\n\n1930 \"Aviation Map of the Philadelphia Metro District\" (courtesy of Tom Beamer).\n\nHow many residents of present-day Philadelphia are aware that this obscure little airport (which is no longer is in operation)\n\nwas the birthplace of quite a few unusual aircraft?\n\nThis airfield was evidently originally built to support the flight testing of aircraft produced by the Keystone Aircraft factory,\n\nlocated a mile to the south along the Delaware River in Bristol, PA.\n\nThe date of construction of this airfield has not been determined.\n\nThe earliest reference to an airfield at this location came from Nathan Sturman,\n\nwho observed, “The ill-fated transatlantic fliers of the U.S. Navy, Wooster & Davis,\n\nsupervised the building of their converted Keystone Pathfinder 'American Legion' at the plant in Bristol [in 1927],\n\nthen test-flew it & departed for Langley Field right on the Green Lane Airfield, later to be called 3M [Airport].”\n\nThe earliest depiction of the airfield which has been located\n\nwas on the Philly Chamber of Commerce's 1930 \"Aviation Map of the Philadelphia Metro District\" (courtesy of Tom Beamer).\n\nIt depicted the \"Keystone Aircraft Field\" as a north/south field running along the east side of Green Lane.\n\nThe airfield layout of the \"Keystone Aircraft Field\",\n\nfrom the 1930 book \"Philadelphia Aeronautical Center of the East\"\n\n(courtesy of the George H.

He had rented it from the commercial helicopter service to do a repair job on a Caterpillar tractor in NJ that was inaccessible by any other means.\n\nThat is me ducking under the blades. My little brother is inside. We were secured by one seat belt.”\n\nThe 1957 PA Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of Mike Keefe)\n\ndescribed Three-M Airport as having 2 bituminous runways: a 3,800' north/south strip & a 3,600' east/west strip.\n\nThe operator was listed as Engle Flying Service, and the manager was listed as Harold Hayden.\n\nA circa 1957-58 photo of a HPK SP-1 at 3M Airport (courtesy of Tom Beamer).\n\nA circa 1957-58 plan of the HPK SP-1, built at 3M Airport (courtesy of Tom Beamer).\n\nAccording to Tom Beamer, HPK Aircraft built the SP-1 (\"Some Pisser-1\")\n\nat 3M Airport with an eye to the light counter-insurgency market.\n\nHPK Aircraft Associates consisted of Harold Hayden, Art Payne, and Robert Kinney of the Engle Flying Service.\n\nA single example of the SP-1 (aka Engle HPK) was built in 1957.\n\nThe SP-1 was a single-seater, powered by a 115hp Lycoming O-235C,\n\nand it won a reward for outstanding workmanship in 1958.\n\nUnfortunately, flying operations at 3M became more difficult when the nearby PA Turnpike was completed in the 1950s\n\nas the raised bridge approach made take off & landing hazardous on the main runway.\n\nA 9/29/58 USGS aerial view depicted 3M Airport as having 3 paved runways, with a total of 17 light aircraft parked around the south end of Runway 1.\n\nThe former Fleetwings Aircraft factory was visible on the southwest side.\n\nThe 1959 Philadelphia Local Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of Chris Kennedy) described 3M Airport as having a 3,800' hard-surface runway.\n\nThe 1960 Jeppesen Airway Manual (courtesy of Chris Kennedy) depicted 3M Airport as having 2 paved runways (3,800' Runway 1/19 & 3,600' Runway 11/29),\n\nas well as an abandoned northeast/southwest runway.\n\nA helicopter landing area was located on the southeast side of the field, and a ramp with 3 buildings was located on the west side.\n\nThe Kaiser-Fleetwings Company still reportedly existed as late as 1960,\n\nwhen it manufactured the launch canister for the Echo 1 balloon satellite at its Bristol factory.\n\nThe plant was closed in 1962, ending this interesting chapter of aviation manufacturing.\n\nDavid Wallace recalled thas his father Bill based his Cessna 175 Skylark at 3M Airport:\n\n“We were active at 3M while the DC-3 was still flying on occasion. The home-built Denight Special racing plane was tied down there.”\n\nBill Stewart recalled of 3M Airport, “I was based there from 1962-69, when it was managed by Engle Flying Service - Harold Hayden & Don Carlson.\n\nReno Benner was chief mechanic & his son-in-law Dave Levin & Jim McGinley were instructors.”\n\nA circa mid-1963 photo of a Cessna 172 at 3M Airport modified with a Unitwin twin-engine installation (courtesy of Tom Beamer).\n\nAccording to Bill Stewart, “The strange modification of the Cessna 172 was owned & funded by Unitwin Corp,\n\na group formed by Dick Young - former WACO & Fleet Canada chief engineer.\n\nI ferried the unmodified Cessna, N7257A, from Garden Spot (Lancaster PA) to Princeton Airport for Dick.\n\nThe 172 hadn't been flown for a year or so & the only working instrument was the oil pressure gage.\n\nThe purpose of the program was to evaluate one approach to providing multi-engine centerline thrust.\n\nThe key element was Dick's Integrating Gearbox, which took 2 engine inputs into a single output (propeller).\n\nWith both engines carrying the load, output & input RPM was the same.\n\nAs power from one engine decreased and the RPM of the input shafts began to differ,\n\nthe gear reduction (an ingenious planetary setup) came into play & the output RPM dropped to permit the remaining engine to maintain RPM.\n\nLoss of an engine required no pilot action other than full throttle on the remaining engine.\n\nThe fixed pitch prop (low cost) simply slowed to not overload the survivor.”\n\nBill continued, “Kinney Tutner Associates (General Techniques Inc) based at Mercer County Airport was responsible for the design\n\nand I, a young aero engineer, then working for a Princeton aerospace think-tank, moonlighted to do the nuts & bolts design.\n\nIt was intended to power the ship with 2 Continental C-85 engines, turning a Sensenich 108-inch reverse-rotation wooden propeller.\n\nI offset the raised thrust line 4 inches to the right to compensate for the increased propeller moments.\n\nThe gearbox was late in coming so the first flights were conducted with a single C-85,\n\nyet the slow turning 9-foot prop provided excellent takeoff & climb performance.\n\nDick flew the first flights by himself, then along with me and finally, I got some flight time.\n\nThe customer pulled the plug despite the excellent preliminary results.\n\nCustomer was rumored to have been Cessna, and at that time they had decided to produce the centerline thrust 336.\n\nThe 172 was returned to stock configuration & sold.”\n\nA closeup from a 1963 aerial view, showing 3M Airport at perhaps its zenith of popularity,\n\nwith over 29 aircraft parked around the south end of Runway 1, including a Douglas DC-3.\n\n3M Airport was described on the Aerodromes table on the 1965 NY Sectional Chart (courtesy of John Voss)\n\nas having 3 bituminous runways, with the longest being 3,865'.\n\nHowever, the remarks included \"NE/SW runway closed.\"\n\nLynn Gentzsch recalled, “I flew out of 3M Airport from 1965-66 & knew Harold Hayden & his partner. A real pair!\n\nOne had been a barnstormer & was my 1st instructor.\n\nHe demonstrated some of his skills to me which I remember vividly!\n\nThey had a Douglas DC-3 that they rented out & in the hangar they has a complete, but disassembled Jenny!”\n\nA 9/25/67 photo by Neil Aird of Beech C18S, N909Z C/n 6046, at Kaiser Field / 3M Airport.\n\nAfter Engle Flying Service moved out of 3M Airport,\n\nHortman Aviation relocated from Morrisville Airport (which had closed) to 3M Airport at some point between 1969-70 (according to Nathan Sturman).\n\n3M Airport was very busy due to the nearby construction of the Levittown housing development,\n\nand had Cessna, Piper and Grumman dealerships with an FBO.\n\nInstructor Tom Schafer taxies out with student pilot Paul Taylor\n\nin an American Aviation Yankee at 3M Airport in 1970 (photo courtesy of Nathan Sturman).\n\nNathan Sturman took flying lessons at 3M Airport in 1970. \"Hortman Aviation were the dealers for the new line\n\nof small aircraft being made in Cleveland [the Grumman American Yankee],\n\nand I spoke to Mrs Hortman on the phone & scheduled my 1st lesson in the Yankee with Bill Barenberg.\n\nIt was Earth Day, 1970 as I remember, high overcast.\n\nTaking lessons from Bill (and as my log reveals Ken Langford & Norm Hortman, probably a progress check),\n\nI soled shortly afterward on 5/10/70 in the red Yankee N5711L on Runway 29 at 3M.\n\nBill went around twice with me & told me to make the next landing to a full stop.\n\nWe taxiied back & Bill asked me for my student pilot's license which he wrote something on the back of.\n\nI still wasn't wise as to what was happening.\"\n\nNathan continued, \"Then he crushed out his cigarette in the ashtray, stood up through the open canopy & got out onto the wing.\n\n'Take it around the pattern once & don't [screw] up,' he said, looking down at a terrified Nate Sturman.\n\n'If I like what I see I'll let you do it again.'\n\nHeart pounding, happy beyond words I taxied back to the bubble, did a careful runup & pre-takeoff check & I was off!\n\n'Yankee 11Lima departing Runway 29er at 3M' I proudly announced on the unicom.\n\nI was surprised that the plane performed so much better with only my weight as I remember.\n\nNice landings, 3 in a row, each time checking back with Bill at the intersection,\n\nand no dreaded 'porpoise'- it was before the larger main tires were fitted.\n\nThey took a bit of my shirt tail as I remember, don't remember where it is now.\"\n\nKen Lankford recalled, “I was an instructor at 3M in 1970, Lots of stories came out of that time working for Yvette & Norm!\n\nOne cloudy day, Mike Shea & I came across Norm Hortman's Very Pistol from his early days of transatlantic flying.\n\nWe shot it off & it lit up all of Levittown! I think Mike has a picture that he took before the fire engines from 6 towns arrived.”\n\nA 1970 aerial view showed that a hangar had been added at some point between 1963-70 along the southeastern end of Runway 1.\n\nAn 8/7/71 aerial view of 3M Airport, showing the former Fleetwings Aircraft factory on the southwest side.\n\nA closeup from the 8/7/71 aerial view, showing over 24 light aircraft clustered around the southern end of 3M's Runway 1.\n\nAccording to Nathan Sturman, Hortman Aviation owner Norm Hortman\n\n\"was killed in an accident in March 1974 while ferrying a used aircraft (CO poisoning) back to 3M.\"\n\nThe February 1975 Philadelphia Terminal Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of Mitchell Hymowitz)\n\ndepicted 3-M Airport as having a 3 paved runways, with the longest being 3,700'.\n\nA July/August 1976 photo by Jack Kenton of several Grumman Tigers at 3M Airport.\n\nJack recalled, “I was using a Tiger to get a single-engine Airline Transport Pilot [rating] at this airport.”\n\nNathan Sturman passed along the following story about a crash at 3M Airport.\n\n\"On the afternoon of Friday, 6/16/1978, I was on the job as a flight instructor for Hortman Aviation at 3M.\n\nA new student, Jane Howe, had just been brought in by her grandfather, got an orientation ride.\n\nShe was to take lessons with me to 1st solo & beyond.\n\nBut on parting that 1st day she warned me that there was something I ought to know,\n\nthat she had been a jinx all her life, and that weird things might happen around there now that she had appeared.\"\n\nNathan continued, \"Well, as she, her gramps and her 2 kids left,\n\nin strode Mr. Seymour Hundley, a very popular & enthusiastic middle-aged student pilot\n\nwho had just soloed a couple of weeks earlier.\n\nBeing in his late forties or early fifties he was not the most apt student (heavy handed but otherwise OK)\n\nbut with time & patient instruction he learned how to handle the PA-128-150 Warrior\n\nand soloed eventually with about 24 hours' experience.\n\nHe actually got pretty good at landings.\n\nWell, Seymour came in that afternoon to practice solo flying,\n\nand even though his supervised soles were done I gave him the customary Hortman 'wind check' (once around the pattern)\n\nand got out way down Runway 11/29 at the intersection with the closed runway,\n\ntelling him to pick me up there after his 1st landing. It was overcast as I recall.\"\n\nNathan continued, \"He took off normally from Runway 29 & flew a nice pattern\n\nbut another aircraft entered downwind in front of him & he extended his downwind leg considerably,\n\nbarely visible over the turnpike bridge & then turned onto a base leg, too low & far out...\n\nhe seemed to be descending in stairs, with irregular bursts of power which I could then hear faintly,\n\nlike a WWI plane with a rotary engine crouping,\n\nor a diesel model engine in lean undercompression toward the end of its run.\n\nThe landing light was on as he turned final directly from the base turn, the procedure for loss of power.\n\nA flight instructor's nightmare: the power lines before the runway threshold were in front of the light!\n\nHe was really low, no flaps as he was told on emergency approaches,\n\nsinking & dragging with alternating bursts of power & simultaneously out of altitude, airspeed & ideas\n\nwhen his undercarriage snapped the power lines & the plane tumbled over\n\nand plunged to earth with a loud 'crump' behind the trees.\n\nBright sparks shot from the snapped lines & soon a loud wailing civil defense siren went off in the distance.\n\nI was about 800 meters away but began running as fast as my size 11 Florsheims would carry me,\n\nbut making no progress, like in a dream where you run in bed but can't get anywhere.\"\n\nNathan continued, \"Beyond the trees at the runway's end I could hear voices shouting 'jump!', 'jump!',\n\nand a small plume of bluish white smoke was rising, with a sputtering & buzzing as from arc welding.\n\nThen as I reached perhaps the intersection with Runway 1\n\na fireball rose above the trees followed by a column of black smoke & a sharp explosion,\n\nfollowed by another & a small mushroom cloud.\n\nWhen I reached the bubble at the runway's end I could feel the intense heat\n\nas I found an opening in the barbed wire & began clawing my way through the briar patch & dense wood.\n\nThe plane was blazing away & the Lower Bucks Fire & Rescue people & vehicles were there already,\n\nas were the nearby factory personnel & some fellows from the airport who beat me there by driving around in the Jeep.\"\n\nNathan continued, \"Well, miraculously, Seymour was fine, but the plane had been flattened & was blazing furiously.\n\nA wire had arced onto the left wing tank & burnt a hole in it, setting off the explosion,\n\nand Seymour heeded the advice to jump, not step, off of the wing.\n\nNearly tragically, he jumped back onto the plane & disappeared into the blazing cabin FOR HIS STUDENT PILOT KIT.\n\nAll's well that end's well, though.\n\nThey took Seymour to Lower Bucks County hospital for observation\n\nand he had a minor injury to his shoulder, that was all, probably saved by that 3-point harness & his quick action.\"\n\nNathan continued, \"The Bucks County Courier Times carried an article on the crash the next day.\n\nAs usual with aviation stories they had it all wrong, and erroneously put ME in the plane with Seymour\n\nsaying that we hit wires while landing & both escaped a fiery end, etc.\n\nMy mother was working at Gimbel's Cheltenham store & her coworkers showed her this story,\n\nand my wife heard that account too & probably always had doubts about what happened.\n\nA lot of people heard the reports & my name on the evening news, KYW etc.,\n\nand the crash made at least one network that evening.\"\n\nNathan continued, \"The FAA cleared Seymour & ruled that it had been a fuel starvation caused by a probable foreign object.\n\nThe maintenance shop objected to this, as the plane had just come out of 100 hour inspection,\n\nand they demonstrated how a pilot could close the mixture instead of the throttle,\n\nthen pump the throttle & feed gas with the accelerator pump, thus getting that cycle of surging & windmilling.\n\nThe FAA, however, stuck by their judgment.\"\n\nNathan continued, \"Hundley returned. He insisted that he had closed the mixture as the plane went in, not before.\n\nI was the 1st to fly with him after his return a couple of weeks later.\n\nHe was really nervous, with a death grip on the yoke,\n\nand I was starting to worry because he was a really big man with what seemed the biggest hands in the western world.\n\nHe smoothly reduced power, slowed down a bit & lowered a notch of flap.\n\nJust then, ahead of us & below, a car exploded in a traffic accident on the Turnpike Bridge in the Delaware\n\nand a black plume of smoke went boiling upwards toward us. Talk about bad timing.\n\nSeymour just turned base in quite a funk I am sure, flew a perfect base & final,\n\nmade the best landing of his career to date & taxied back to the pumps.\n\nHe had a few more rides before giving up on his license with us I recall.\n\nYears later I heard that he was flying an old Cessna 150 of his own somewhere in New Jersey.\"\n\nA 1978 photo by Fred Roberts of Nathan Sturman in front of a 1978 Grumman American AA-5B Tiger at 3M Airport.\n\nRecalling the flight from the same airfield in 1927 of the Keystone Pathfinder 'American Legion',\n\nNathan Sturman observed, “In all of the perhaps thousands of takeoffs & landings\n\nI did on that strip I never dreamt of whose steps I was literally following in.\n\nTime joins us all together in funny ways with those who went before.”\n\nJoe Koch recalled, “I got my ticket at 3M in 1978. A great place & I did fly with Nate Sturman 2 times.\n\nI used to take a Grumman & go to Van Sant. One day I was going flying & Herb [Hortman] asked where I was going & I told him VanSant.\n\nWell he told me his mom did not want renters going into there. I told him I had been doing it for a year & he said OK, no problem.”\n\nJoe confirmed that 3M was a dealer for the Grumman aircraft line.\n\nBut Joe elaborated, “The instructors did not like them. They called them garbage cans. I really liked them.\n\nA J3 taught you rudder & how to fly & a Grumman was the same only a lot faster!!!”\n\nThe last photo which has been located showing 3M as an active airport was a 1979 photo of Joe Koch & his father in front of a C150 that was owned by a friend of his dad.\n\nWalt Stepek recalled, “When I finally decided to start taking lessons in 1980 I did have an introductory ride in a Grumman AA-1C at 3M, and enjoyed the experience.\n\nIt was truly sad to see 3M Airport close, but happily enough, the Hortmans were able to locate to Philly Northeast.”\n\nAccording to K. Doolin, the 3M Company closed the airport around 1980 due to insurance concerns,\n\nand Hortmann Aviation moved to the Northeast Philadelphia Airport.\n\nPaul Campbell recalled, “After Hortman moved to Northeast Phi"
