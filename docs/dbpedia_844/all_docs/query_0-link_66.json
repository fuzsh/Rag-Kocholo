Sixty-one percent of\n\nstudents contributed, which tied them\n\nwith the classes of 2001 and 2000 for\n\nthe highest percentage of students\n\ndonating in the last 15 years of the\n\nsenior gift program. Committee cochairs were Jane Bee and Sara Beltz. A\n\nnumber of parents also contributed to\n\nthe project, as did the Alumni Board,\n\nwhich offered the class a $2,006\n\nincentive for reaching 60 percent\n\nparticipation.\n\ngas emissions and the resources at our disposal to reduce these emissions.\"\n\nFranklin & Marshall will move toward more sustainability by taking three actions: developing\n\na long-range plan for becoming climate neutral, creating an inventory of its greenhouse gas\n\nemissions, and taking short-term, tangible actions toward minimizing carbon dioxide emissions.\n\n\"Together, these steps will enable us to understand more clearly our energy use and its\n\nimplications for the environment,\" Fry said. \"This understanding will in turn help us to adopt\n\npolicies consistent with becoming climate neutral as we expand the campus footprint.\"\n\nSigning the commitment requires the College to take at least two tangible actions to reduce its\n\ngreenhouse gas emissions during the next two years. F&M is exploring options such as purchasing\n\nmore renewable energy, improving building energy efficiencies, and committing to purchase Energy\n\nStar appliances.\n\nIn making the announcement, Fry lauded the Campus Sustainability Committee and the\n\nSustainability Task Force and students Rebecca Rehr '09 and Marilyn Weiss '09 for recommending\n\nthe College's involvement in the commitment. ~\n\nWare House\n\nCommons\n\nopens doors\n\nPaul Ware '72, P'99 and Judy Ware P'99 in\n\nfront of the Ware House banner\n\nOn Februa ry 23, Ware House Commons,\n\nth e first of th e Coll ege House Comm ons built on campus, opened its doors\n\nto students, facu lty, and administration.\n\nBoas ting an open, high-ceilinged Grea t\n\nRoom with walls of glass, limeston e, and\n\ngranite, a li ving room with deep armchairs and a roaring fireplace, as well as\n\na seminar room, kitch en , and office, th e\n\nCom m ons is a physical realiza tion of\n\nthe College House System's goals.\n\nAccording to Ware House Don Joel\n\nEigen, the adaptabl e, n e utral space of\n\nth e Great Room maximizes ch an ces\n\nfor m embe rs of the community to intellectually explore ideas outside the classroom or after a compelling lecture.\n\nWare House Commons will help facilitate one of the m ain tenets of the house\n\nsystem philosophy- \"wh at h appens in\n\nthe classroom doesn 't have to stay in the\n\nCollege unveils new\n\nKIVO dining option\n\nFranklin & Marshall stud ents have a\n\nlot to look forward to n ext sem este r\n\nwith n ew advancem e nts in dining\n\nservices for th e fall of 2007 .

His duties\n\ninclude teaching an acting course and directing one of TD F's\n\nmain-stage shows each year. He also books the touring productions for the Roschel Performing Arts Center and serves\n\nas liaison to outside arts orga nizations.\n\nDescribe the path that led you to F&M.\n\nI've taken a circuitous path to F&M. I grew up in a small, coal-mining community in western Pennsylvania where I read voraciously and dreamed of escaping the confines\n\nof that dreary town. I saw my first play when I attended the Governor's School for the Arts and discovered the imaginative power of the theater. From that moment I\n\nknew what I wanted to do with my life. I joined the Army at 17 to save money for college and was stationed in Panama and Ft. Riley, Kan. I received my undergraduate\n\ntraining from Kansas State University and Emporia State. I have spent nearly 15 years as a professional actor\n\nand director and worked all over the United\n\nStates. After this long period of wanderlust, I finally settled down and put my energies into an M.F.A. in\n\ndirecting at Northwestern University. As I\n\nwas completing my course requirements, Michael Mitchell, the artistic director at the Fulton Theatre, told\n\nme of the open position at F&M.\n\nWhat's it like being back in Pennsylvania?\n\nAfter nearly 20 years, I find myself back in the state I grew up in. My wife is a Midwesterner. Whenever\n\nwe go to visit her relatives in Kansas she remarks, \"It's good to be back with my people.\" They are hardscrabble, decent, hard-working, plainspoken folks. I feel much the same way now that I've returned\n\nto Pennsylvania-it feels like I'm home again.\n\nAre there special challenges\n\nworking with students?\n\nThe biggest challenge is the fear of failure. Acting by its very nature\n\nis about being fearless! Whether I'm working with students in a\n\nclassroom or a rehearsal studio, I try to create an environment where\n\nthey can take risks and develop trust. It is amazing to see what happens\n\nwhen they become fearless in a scene.\n\nWhat's the best part of your job?\n\nThere is no better feeling than guiding young actors in the classroom or in production and\n\nwatching the journeys they take as they discover something new about the play, the characters they\n\nare playing, themselves, and the world around them.\n\nYou recently became a certified fight choreographer. What are\n\nspecial considerations when choreographing fight scenes?\n\nI meet with the director to discuss how the fight sequence fits within the overall dramatic action of\n\nthe play. I ask about the actors: How physically fit are they? Have they had previous stage combat\n\nexperience? Do they have any pre-existing physical injuries or conditions? The number one concern of\n\nany fight choreographer is safety. To avoid injuries, I take the actors through a vigorous warm-up regimen, demonstrate how to safely execute the fight sequences, and adjust the fight to fit the strengths\n\nand limitations of the specific actors.\n\nr--\n\n0\n\n0\n\nWhat's the best fight scene you've seen?\n\nr--J\n\nFight choreography in film has come such a long way since the early days when we saw the flashy, more\n\n\"§_\n\nCTl\n\nC\n\nstylized techniques used in movies starring Errol Flynn or Basil Rathbone. Some of my favorite fight scenes\n\nV,\n\nare in Cyrano de Bergerac (1990), The Princess Bride (1987), and The Three Musketeers (1973). The great\n\nn,\n\n.\n\n.c\n\nWilliam Hobbs is considered by many to be one of the most influential fight choreographers in film and on\n\nIll\n\nstage. His fight direction in The Three Musketeers is absolutely superb. It was the first time swordplay on\n\nn,\n\nscreen was portrayed as a brawl with long daggers-it is messy, bloody, and totally unpredictable.\n\nHas your military background helped in doing fight scenes?\n\nDuring my military service I learned how to inflict real injuries on a potential enemy. This type of training was\n\nquite useful in developing my flexibility, stamina, and confidence I would need later as a fight choreographer, but\n\nthe actual fighting techniques are very different. In stage combat, I want to create the illusion of inflicting real\n\ninjuries. This is something an acting partner greatly appreciates. ~\n\nE\n\n~\n\n::,\n\n0\n\nolS\n\n·:i\n\n....\n\nC\n\nC\n\nn,\n\n10\n\nteaching\n\nresearch\n\n.......\n\nDI\n\n::::,\n\n==\n\n::::,\n\nQI)\n\n3\n\n...\n\nDI\n\nIll\n\n:::,~\n\nV,\n\n-g_\n\n:::J\n\nlO\n\nN\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-.J\n\nFaculty studies, team-teaches course about\n\npregnancy outcomes in American women\n\nAm eri can wom en ha ve inc reas ing access\n\nto prena tal ca re .

Austen set two\n\nof her novels in Bath-Northanger Abbey and\n\nPersuasion. The costumed guides lend an authentic period atmosphere.\n\nAnd the compact nature of Bath makes it an easily\n\nwalkable city, enabling visitors to take in its 5,000\n\npreserved Georgian buildings, historic baths and\n\nruins, and landmarks at a leisurely pace.\n\nI'll\n\n.\n\n.c\n\nVI\n\nI'll\n\nE\n\nca\n\nC\n\n.:ii=\n\n....\n\nC\n\nI'll\n\n1\n\n....\n\nc1\n\n::s\n\n25::\n\ns·\n\n120\n\n3QI\n\n.,\n\nIll\n\n':t'\n\nRed state, blue state\n\nF &M experts analyze the country's mood in the\n\nQI\n\nVl\n\nrun-up to the\n\n~:::i\n\nlO\n\nN\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2008\n\npresidential election\n\nBy Tom Murse\n\n--.J\n\nH\n\nERE WE ARE AGAIN\n\nin the thick of another presidential campaign season, faced with a fresh\n\nset of reminders about just how divided we in the electorate are. It won't be long before the\n\nubiquitous red-and-blue maps resurface. The Washington punditocracy, spilling barrels of ink, will\n\nfile reports from roadside diners in Middle America about how the country is still trying to pull\n\nitself together from the last divisive election. 4J There's a lot of time between now and November\n\n2008,\n\nso let's pause to ask ourselves a few questions. Namely, are we really that different? Was Dave\n\nBarry, the nation's humorist laureate, right when he joked weeks after the\n\n2004\n\nelection that reel\n\nstates are \"where 'foreign cuisine' pretty much means Pizza Hut,\" and blue states are those in\n\nwhich people \"believe they are smarter than the red states, despite the fact that it takes the average blue-state resident 15 minutes to order a single cup of coffee?\"\n\n•J If that's one quarter as true\n\nas it is funny, how did we end up this way? And more important, why should we care? For those\n\nanswers, we turned to some Franklin & Marshall political scientists and alumni Beltway insiders.\n\nHere's the bottom line: For all the hand wringing about our polarized nation, there's surprisingly\n\nlittle to worry about, most believe. Of course, there are dissenters who say Washington is fiddling\n\nwhile Rome burns.\n\nDivided we stand\n\nIt's not your imagination. The las t two presidential elec tions\n\nreaffirmed that we in the electorate see our politi cians through\n\nve ry different pri sms. Whil e the largest segm ent of voters is\n\nmade up of moderates and while there is evidence that Americans have grown closer together ideologically in recent yea rs,\n\nthe races for th e White House in 2000 and 2004 were extraordinaril y divi sive.\n\nFor proof of that, just look at who voted and wh y. Wh en it\n\ncame to three of the most important iss ues among voters in\n\n2004-the war in Iraq, terrorism , and moral valu es - vo ters\n\nwere clearly torn . Those who said Iraq was th eir biggest conce rn sided with Kerry, 73 pe rcent to 26 perce nt. Voters who\n\nwere most concerned about national sec uri ty ove rwhelmingly\n\npicked Bush , 86 percent to 14 pe rcent. And th ose who voted\n\non the basis of moral valu es? It was Bush in a landslide, So\n\npe rcent to 18 percent.\n\n\"How can these differences not lead to a certain polari zation\n\nin the electorate? Voters are polarized in how they view th e\n\neconom y, how they view Bush , how they view Iraq, and there\n\nisn 't any doubt about it. These are pretty profound differences,\"\n\nsays G. Terry M adonn a, the direc tor ofF&M 's C enter for Politics and Public Affairs. \"Sure, we've always had strong feelings\n\nabout candidates . I can rem ember how people hated Kennedy\n\nin the '6os when I was a kid. Voters see things through ve ry\n\ndifferent prisms. But I have been impressed with th e degree of\n\ndifference be tween D emocrats and Republi cans now.\"\n\nWhat makes the nation seem even more polari zed, however,\n\nis that the last two presid ential elec tions were won by razo rthin margins. \"We are a deeply divided - and equally divided-country,\" says Ken Duberstein '65, who served as President\n\nRonald Reagan 's chi ef of staff in 1988 and 1989 . \"I think the\n\ncountry is as polarized as I've ever seen it. I think Iraq has a lot\n\nto do with it. I think we are still fundamentally a 50-50 country.\n\nBut that does not m ean that this is a blue state and that is a red\n\nstate. That m eans people are virtually equally divided.\"\n\nIt is diffic ult to argue that there is not at least a significant\n\npartisan ga p, a nd to a lesse r extent an ideological on e. But\n\nthe di visive nature of Ameri can politics is n owh ere n ear as\n\nevident ot1tside th e Beltway as it is in th e na ti on 's capital, say\n\nb oth Duberstein and Ken Mehlma n '88, the fo rm er chairman\n\nof th e Republican Na tional C ommittee who led President\n\nBush's 2004 re-election campaign.\n\nM ehlman believes Washington is a lot more polari zed than\n\nthe rest of the country, m ostly because politi cs occupies a much\n\ngrea ter percentage of th e lives of peopl e in Washington.\n\n\"H oward D ea n said , 'I ha te Re publica n s and everything\n\nth ey stand for.' For most D emoc rats outsid e of Washington,\n\na Republican is not somebody you hate,\" says M ehlman. \"It's\n\nsom ebody whose children your kid plays soccer with .\n\n\"In politics, if yo u view someone as a Republican first and\n\na golfer second, if what someone's political party is is th e most\n\nimportant thing about that person, th en you're more likely to\n\nhold a polari zing view. And in Washington , a lot of people, the\n\nfirst thing they ask is, 'What party are you ?' In m ost of America,\n\nit's, 'Where are you from ? Wh ere do your kids go to school ,\"'\n\nM ehlman says .\n\n\"Second , I think part of wh y pola rization exists- and this is\n\ncounte rintuiti ve- is that our political parti es have been su ccessful in accomplishing a lot of things th ey wa nted to accompli sh ,\" M ehlma n says.\n\n\"A generation ago, m any on the left sa id , 'We want to pass\n\nthe Ci vil Rights Act, we want the New D eal, we wa nt to cl ean\n\nup th e environm ent.'

One was to\n\nsee the campus officially designated as an arboretum, to\n\npreserve and enhance the College's natural landscape for\n\nthe benefit of current and future generations.\n\nOn February 24, that aim was realiz ed wh en F&M\n\nnamed its campus the Caroline Steinman Nunan Arboretum at Franklin & Marshall College. Mrs. Nunan, a local philanthropist and conservationist, was presented\n\nwith the citation at a board of trustees meeting at the\n\nSteinman College Center. Fry said the decision to dedicate the arboretum after Nunan, an emerita trustee of\n\nF&M , was easy. \"It took about five seconds,\" he said,\n\n\"and Carrie's name popped into my head.\"\n\nAN EXEMPLAR\n\nWhen he assumed the presidency of the College in July\n\n2002, Fry said he was struck by the beauty of the campus. He also knew many people already referred to it as\n\nan arboretum, even though it was never designated as\n\nsuch. Making it a formal arboretum, with all that entails,\n\nseemed a logical step, he said.\n\nIn preparation for that, David Schuyler, the Arthur\n\nand Katherine Shadek Professor of the Humanities and\n\nAmerican studies, worked with then-student Jane A. Bee\n\n'06 to produce a photographic history of F&M that was\n\npublished in 2004.\n\nAnd this past summer, Schuyler and another student,\n\nHackman scholar Lydia Wood '08, researched and wrote\n\na paper titled, \"History of the Franklin & Marshall College\n\nLandscape.\"\n\n\"For more than a century, F&M has thought of its campus as an arboretum in the generic sense,\" Schuyler said .\n\nHe and Wood discovered at least one tree at the College that dates from 1857, when the campus was in its\n\ninfancy. It's a silver linden, Schuyler said, and is found\n\nnear Keiper Hall.\n\nFry said it makes sense to move forward on the arboretum project because the College's master plan is being\n\nupdated and because public concern over the environment is growing. In the past few years, the campus has\n\nexpanded more than 40 acres with the acquisition of a\n\nformer scrapyard along Harrisburg Avenue and land at\n\nthe Armstrong site off Liberty Street, as well as the leasing of some property on Harrisburg Avenue.\n\nMaintaining the arboretum will be part of the master\n\nplan, which should be finished later this year.\n\n\"It's a propitious time to be doing this,\" Fry said. There\n\nwill be a \"formal process for tagging trees, and bringing\n\nin more specimens\" the College doesn 't have, he said .\n\nAnd the campus will be freed of landscape \"clutter,\"\n\nFry said, meaning overgrown trees will be pruned and\n\nunnecessary bushes removed . Those improvements also\n\nwill help public safety by improving visibility.\n\nAnd \"if we're going to have a first-rate arboretum,\"\n\nFry said, it must be named after someone \"who has a\n\nconnection to the natural environment.\" Nunan not only\n\n,a\n\n.\n\n.c\n\nIll\n\n,a\n\nE\n\n~\n\nC\n\nJI::\n\n.....\n\nC\n\n,a\n\n....\n\nDI\n\n::::,\n\n. ==\n\n::::,\n\nQO\n\n.3\n\nDI\n\nIll\n\n:,-\n\nDI\n\nVl\n\n-g_\n\n:::::,\n\n=\n\nN\n\n0\n\n0\n\n--.J\n\nfits that description, he said, \"she's an exemplar for the College of a life well-lived .\"\n\nF&M awarded her an honorary doctor of\n\nhumane letters degree in 2003, but the arboretum designation is more special, Fry said.\n\n\"I can't think of a better thing to do than to\n\ndo this,\" he said.\n\nThe citation begins, \"Caroline Steinman\n\nNunan has an extraordinary record of civic\n\ncontributions to the Lancaster area and has\n\nhad tremendous influence in shaping the\n\nmodern environmental, cultural, and educational nature of the community in which\n\nher family has played such a major role for\n\ngenerations.\"\n\nNunan is a life member of the Lancaster\n\nCounty Conservancy and was given the conservancy's Partnership Award in 1999. \"Her\n\noutstanding support of the conservancy and\n\nthe Lancaster Farmland Trust has helped\n\npreserve the unique character and beauty\n\nof Lancaster County,\" the citation continues.\n\nThe document also praises Nunan for overseeing \"the development of the gardens of\n\nher childhood home, Conestoga House, into\n\na magnificent showcase of annual, perennial\n\nand tropical flowering plants.\"\n\nAt Franklin & Marshall, she is an emerita\n\nmember of the board of trustees and a member of the board of visitors. The Steinman\n\nGreenhouse in the new Ann & Richard\n\nBarshinger Life Sciences & Philosophy Building, to open later this year, and the Steinman\n\nCollege Center are symbols of her family's\n\nlong tradition of supporting F&M.\n\n\"This woman is incredibly self-effacing,\"\n\nFry said. \"It's one of her great characteristics.\n\nWe're embarrassing her a little bit.\"\n\nFOLLOWING IN FOOTSTEPS\n\nNunan called the naming of the arboretum\n\n\"a great honor. I'm thrilled with all the wonderful things that are going on at the College.\"\n\nOn February 24, Mrs. Nunan was presented with a framed copy of the citation . \"She's\n\ndelighted\" about the arboretum designation,\n\nFry said afterward.\n\n\"I think it's a great idea,\" said Dale Frey,\n\nchairman of the board of trustees, who was\n\nbriefly interviewed following the meeting. \"It\n\njust couldn't happen to a more wonderful and\n\nappropriate person,\" who's given so much to\n\nthe College and the community, he said.\n\n-~~-----~~~-\n\nFry said his benchmark for the project is the\n\n78-year-old Scott Arboretum of Swarthmore\n\nCollege, which he became familiar with\n\nwhile an administrator at the University of\n\nPennsylvania. Fry said he's also inspired by\n\nthe Morris Arboretum of the University of\n\nPennsylvania, which is a 92-acre, Victorian\n\nlandscape garden in Chestnut Hill, Pa.\n\nPaul Meyer, director of the Morris Arboretum, visited the college in 2005 and wrote\n\nback to Fry: \"We were very impressed with\n\nthe beauty of your campus and the breadth\n\nand quality of your collection of trees. Your\n\nplans to designate the entire campus as an arboretum are most exciting and appropriate.\"\n\n~\n\nFry said the master plan will \"begin to lay\n\n0\n\n~ out a pathway\" for developing the arbore~ tum, a process that will happen over decades.\n\nTill now, he said, Ted Schmid, grounds and\n\nSWAT team manager, and Carroll Shearer,\n\nsupervisory lab technician in biology, have\n\n\"been informally carrying the load\" of identifying and caring for the trees and other species on campus. \"This allows us to take their\n\nwork to another level,\" Fry said .\n\n~ ~ s::\n\n?;;\n\nHe env1s1ons walking tours and educational programs, for example. \"Why\n\nshouldn't the outdoor environment be part\n\nof the learning experience?\" Fry said. Now\n\nthat the arboretum's been formalized, he\n\nsaid, \"any time you touch something\" on\n\ncampus, its effect on the landscape has to be\n\nconsidered . \"It imposes a discipline.\"\n\n\"I'm very excited about this,\" Fry said.\n\n\"It's part of the F&M legacy.\" ~\n\nThis article appeared in the February 25\n\nedition of the Lancaster Sunday News.

It's not about labels or titles;\n\nit's about the work,\" she explains.\n\n\"It's a great job. My favorite part is that we have an independent mayor with an aggressive, innovative agenda,\" she\n\nsays. \"Having a chance to work with someone like that and\n\nhelp him advance his agenda is the best part. We want to\n\nmake New York City a better place.\" In the corporate world,\n\nBloomberg focused on his customers, and Harris says he has\n\nthat same customer-friendly approach with the city's 8.1 million residents.\n\nEnsuring that the mayor achieves his initiatives requires\n\na certain toughness and tact . Perhaps that's why Harris has\n\nbeen dubbed the \"velvet hammer\" by her colleagues.\n\nShe laughs about the nickname and says: \"Sometimes\n\nyou have to be tough and direct. In government many times\n\npeople are reacting to whatever the issue of the day is, and\n\npart of my job is making sure the mayor's big-picture goals\n\nmove forward.\"\n\nThat toughness has helped Harris meet the many challenges the administration has faced. They came into office\n\nin January 2002, shortly after the 9/11 tragedy. \"We had the\n\nfirst six-month ceremony right when we got here,\" she says.\n\nHarris oversaw the planning of the first commemoration and\n\nall the subsequent ones when the eyes of the world were on\n\nNew York. She also sat on the committee to select the 9/11\n\nmemorial.\n\nOne of the many sides of Patti Harris is her love of the arts\n\n(she took 10 art history courses at F&M). She talks excitedly\n\nabout bringing Christo and Jeanne-Claude's The Gates to Central Park, a project to restore 108 paintings in City Hall, and an\n\nexhibition of Calder sculptures on view in City Hall Park.\n\nIn addition to a busy work life, Harris and her husband\n\nhave a son (a 12th grader) and a daughter (a 10th grader) .\n\nShe also has an older stepson. An active and involved mom,\n\nshe attends her kids' activities, gets them involved in her work,\n\nand takes family vacations (she is an avid scuba diver) .\n\nWhen asked if being a woman has even been a hindrance\n\nin the workplace, her answer is a resounding no. \"I've never\n\nthought, 'Hey, if I were one of the guys, I could have done this\n\nor achieved that. I've just figured out how to get it done.\"'\n\nMARY SCHAPIRO '77\n\nchairman and CEO of NASD\n\nHaving spent her entire career in\n\nfinancial and securities regulation,\n\nMary Schapiro often finds herself\n\nfacing an audience of mostly men .\n\nShe hasn't let that slow her rise to\n\nthe top of her field.\n\n\"I don't feel that it's been that\n\nmuch of struggle being a woman,\" she says. \"Clearly there are\n\nmoments when you are standing\n\nup in front of an audience of 500\n\npeople and 493 of them are men\n\nand it'd be wonderful to see a few more female faces. But\n\nI've never felt I've had less responsibility or authority than I\n\nwanted because I am a woman .\"\n\nSchapiro has been in the regulatory environment since\n\nearning her law degree from George Washington University\n\nin 1980. An anthropology major at F&M, she chose this field\n\nbecause of two brothers-Nelson Bunker Hunt and William\n\nHerbert Hunt-who tried to corner the silver market in 1980.\n\n\"Here were two people who thought they were powerful\n\nenough to corner the world market in a commodity that is\n\nreally important industrially,\" she says. \"There was a little\n\nfederal agency that was responsible for investigating what\n\nthe Hunt brothers were doing and prosecuting them. I became enthralled with the idea that two people thought they\n\nwere bigger than the marketplace and would disadvantage\n\nmillions of people around the world to enrich themselves.\" A\n\npassion was born.\n\nDuring her career, she has been chairman of the federal\n\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and a commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In\n\n1996, she was hired as president of NASD Regulation at NASD.\n\nNASD is the world's largest private sector securities regulator\n\nand the primary regulator of 5,200 U.S. securities brokerage\n\nfirms and the nearly 700,000 registered brokers who do business with the public.\n\nIn 2002, she was named vice chairman, and she became\n\nchairman and CEO on Sept. 1, 2006. This year, she also helped\n\norchestrate a plan to consolidate the regulatory operations\n\nof NASD and NYSE into a new self-regulatory organization,\n\nthe world's largest.\n\nThat sense of fairness that first piqued her interest in 1980\n\nstill runs deep. One of Schapiro's biggest objectives is educating underserved populations about smart investing and\n\nprotecting senior citizens from financial scams through the\n\nNASD and its foundation.\n\nSeniors should be pleased they have Schapiro on their side.\n\nNever one to back down, this field hockey and lacrosse standout at F&M has been described as tough, direct, and steadfast.\n\nThese traits have paid off time and again .\n\nPerhaps the story that best illustrates how she stares down\n\nchallenges occurred in 1994 when she was chairman of the\n\nCFTC. When the CFTC rejected a proposal that the Chicago\n\nBoard of Trade brought before it, the board's president was\n\nespecial ly unhappy that the new, female chairman shot down\n\nhis plan. He announced that he\n\nwouldn't be \"intimidated by any\n\nblond, 5-foot-2-inch girl.\" When\n\nhis comment hit the news, a reporter called Schapiro looking\n\nfor a reaction . Her response?\n\n\"He is absolutely wrong,\" she\n\nsaid. \"I'm 5-foot-5 .\"\n\nWhile there have been similar challenges, she believes being\n\na woman can be an advantage.\n\n\"When you stand up and give a\n\nspeech, your voice is different\n\nand your tone is different,\" she\n\nexplains. \" Sometimes you get the benefit of people's curiosity\n\nabout what you ' re going to say.\"\n\nSchapiro is also a big believer in strong relationships .\n\n\"Build relationships everywhere you go along the way, because you never know when someone is going to reappear in\n\nyour life and become important to you for totally unrelated\n\nreasons,\" she says.\n\nSchapiro and her husband have two young daughters\n\n(\"both going to F&M, though they don 't know it yet\") . And\n\nwhile she is surely a role model to other women trying to get\n\nahead in the business world, she doesn't think it has sunk in\n\nwith her daughters quite yet. \"I think they're proud of me,\n\nbut right now I'm just mom to them .\"\n\nHer best advice to anyone in the workforce-and not just\n\nwomen-is to prepare relentlessly, believe in your abilities,\n\nand act accordingly. \"You have to go in with the assumption\n\nthat you are going to be treated on your merits,\" she says.\n\n\" You're going to be judged on how you handle situations\n\nrather than being judged by what you look like.\"\n\nNANCY FLOYD '76\n\nco-founder and managing director of Nth Power\n\n\"I was a shy, quiet person,\" says Nancy Floyd with a chuckle.\n\nThat's a tough concept to believe for anyone who has done\n\nbusiness with this high-energy entrepreneur.\n\nFloyd credits her time at Franklin & Marshall, where she\n\nmajored in government, as a key turning point in her development and as the spark that unleashed her entrepreneurial\n\nside. The College had just become co-ed, so she had a plethora of opportunities to start new programs, such as the first\n\nwomen's varsity tennis and squash teams. \"Anything I wanted\n\nto do, the administration supported me,\" she says. \"I didn't\n\nrealize at the time, but I was being entrepreneurial.\"\n\nThat was just the beginning. After earning a master's degree from the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, she worked for the chairman of the Vermont Public\n\nUtilities Commission-the first woman ever hired by the commission. There she addressed energy and telecommunications\n\nissues, served as the commission's chief legislative liaison, and\n\nfounded one of the first non-profit companies in the U.S. to\n\nfund home energy audits.\n\nFrom there it was on to Philadelphia, where she was recruited to help start the American Refining Group. \"The CEO\n\nviewed himself as a visionary and wanted to start a subsidiary\n\nthat was going to invest in renewable energy companies like\n\nsolar and wind,\" she says.\n\nShe then took her entrepreneurial talents to San Francisco, where she founded NFC Energy Corporation, one of\n\nthe country's first wind development firms . She developed\n\nmore than $30 million in projects and sold the company. Next\n\nshe tried her hand in telecommunications and helped found\n\nPacTel Spectrum Services, which was later sold to IBM.\n\nMaking a name for herself in both the energy and telecommunications fields was challenging . \"There were definitely points along the way where I had to push myself to do\n\nthings that I wasn't comfortable doing,\" she says. \"Partly because I was the only woman and partly because I was pushing\n\nmyself to do things\n\nI didn't have in my\n\nskill set.\"\n\nHer way to earn\n\npeople's respect was\n\nto over-prepare and\n\nwork hard. \"I always\n\nwanted to feel like I\n\nwas more prepared\n\nthan anyone else in\n\nthe room,\" she says.\n\nIn 1993 she\n\nfounded her \"most\n\nsuccessful venture.\"\n\nNth Power, based\n\nin San Francisco,\n\nwas the first venture capital firm to\n\nspecialize in new\n\nenergy technologies . \"I realized\n\nthat if there is one\n\nindustry that really\n\nneeded innovation,\"\n\nshe says, \"it was the\n\nenergy industry.\"\n\nThe early going was difficult. \" It took me three-and-a-half\n\nyears to raise our first fund,\" she says. \"I visited 197 investors\n\naround the world and only nine of them bought. I counted.\"\n\nSoon after founding the business, Floyd and her husband\n\ndecided to move to Oregon to raise their two young sons .\n\nWith the business now flourishing, she takes full advantage\n\nof being able to work out of her sophisticated home office .\n\nAnd Nth Power is indeed flourishing . \"Today we have $400\n\nmillion under management. Being one of the early investors,\n\nwe are considered the leading brand of funds that are investing in this sector. When we started hardly anyone was investing in energy. Now 10 percent of all venture capital goes into\n\nthe sector,\" reports Floyd .\n\nBeing on that cutting edge is a spot that now feels like\n\nhome to Floyd . \"It takes a certain personality to be a founder\n\nor a first in something . It takes a sort of bravado and confidence. The challenge was developing the confidence to be\n\ncomfortable in that role.\"\n\nAlong the way she has also developed her own way of\n\nmanaging and leading . \"I think that I have a distinct style . I\n\nam very direct. I am extreme ly energetic, \" she says. \"I believe\n\nthe business I am in today is all about relationships, and I\n\nthink women tend to be a bit more relational than men.\"\n\nStill, she doesn't rely on her experience. She still feels the\n\nneed to \"work harder and prepare more than most people .\n\nThat's inbred in me. It's the only way to really get ahead .\"\n\nMoving ahead is what Floyd is all about. And if she ruffles\n\na few feathers along the way, all the better. \"We have all\n\nachieved,\" she says in reference to Harris, Schapiro, and herself, \"and you're not going to achieve anything by being a\n\nwallflower.\" Or a shrinking violet . And there aren't any of\n\neither of those in this accomplished bunch . ~\n\nr--\n\n0\n\n0\n\nN\n\n0)\n\nC\n\n\"§_\n\nV>\n\nIO\n\n.\n\n.c\n\nIll\n\nIO\n\nE\n\nca\n\n.5\n\n:i\n\n....\n\nC\n\nIO\n\n2\n\n.......\n\nt:1,1\n\n::s\n\n25::\n\ns·\n\nQO\n\n3\n\n...\n\nt:1,1\n\nIll\n\n::r\n\n0\n\nclasses\n\nCathy\n\nprofiles\n\nCross Roman\n\n'77\n\n!.\n\nDea r Fri ends,\n\nWith all th e amazing phys ical changes on ca mpus, it's easy\n\nto ove rlook a comparabl e transformati on underway in th e\n\nconn ec tion s among our alumni , ac ross th e country and\n\nac ross th e globe.\n\nFranklin & Ma rshall alumni enj oy spending time together.
