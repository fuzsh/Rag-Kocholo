        "text": "Led by Donald Rowell, Sensenich Wood Propeller Co consolidated all manufacturing operations in Florida in 2023 with the relocation of metal propeller production to Plant City, FL. All products are now made there. With dealers and distributors located throughout the world, you can easily get a prop from this company that was established in the early 1930â€™s. That gives them a lot of experience! They are also an FAA Production Certificate Holder and an FAA Approved Repair Station.\n\nYou can read more about the history of Sensenich here: https://www.sensenich.com.\n\nThank you to Don and his team for their continued support!"
