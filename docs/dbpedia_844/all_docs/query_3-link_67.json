In the case of the 76E and 74D series props, both propellers have a 60″ median.\n\nTherefore, in the example above, the 62 has already gone up 2 inches. You can still go up 4 more to the 66 for a total of 6 inches. Then you can go back down to a 64 and that would be your total of 8.\n\nFor more information about model-specific Sensenich propellers see this article."
