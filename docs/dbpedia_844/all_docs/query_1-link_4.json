        "text": "There are local jobs.\n\nIn Plant City, it seems like every new street you’ve never driven down before has some surprise business. Entities like the City Commission, the Plant City Economic Development Corporation, the Plant City Chamber of Commerce, and Plant City Main Street work tirelessly to create a supportive climate for businesses. This is a look into the current state of business in Plant City.\n\nFirst, it is important to note that everyone who operates a business or profession in the City of Plant City is required apply for, obtain, and maintain a Local Business Tax Receipt. If a business doesn’t have a permanent office or branch office in Plant City, but does contracting, landscaping, or lawn maintenance in the city, the business does not need this Tax Receipt.\n\nThe City of Plant City Business Tax Department has 314 business designations. There are 2,197 registered businesses within Plant City. Among these are:\n\n-332 retail stores\n\n-109 restaurants\n\n-63 manufacturers\n\n-21 warehouses\n\n-40 distribution centers\n\nThese are the largest employers in Plant City with the number of employees:\n\n-South Florida Baptist Hospital – 800\n\n-C&S Wholesale Grocers (distribution/logistics) – 500\n\n-Dart Container (manufacturing) – 450\n\n-Gordon Food Service – 450\n\n-Star Distribution Systems (logistics) – 450\n\n-QGS Development (construction) – 367\n\n-James Hardie Products (manufacturing) – 350\n\n-Sonoco (manufacturing) – 350\n\n-Solaris Healthcare – 262\n\n-Stingray Chevrolet – 250\n\n-Toufayan Bakery – 200\n\n-Comanco (construction) – 200\n\n-The Plant City Observer (news media) – 4 + 1 intern\n\nThe City Furniture store on South Frontage Road is the largest furniture store in the Southeast. If you need to walk a few miles, go there and look at all of the items in the showroom. Then have a free cookie to replace the calories you burned. We do not recommend taking kids there to play hide and seek—you may never find them.\n\nThough not one of the largest employers, Tesla has a presence in Plant City. The company located a distribution center in Southern Oaks Business Park on Charlie Taylor Road. There is no indication Elon Musk intends to also locate himself in Plant City—even though he would have quick access to Kennedy Space Center to watch his SpaceX launches.\n\nIn the same complex is Sysco, an American multinational company that markets and distributes food products and kitchen equipment. The company is headquartered in Houston, TX, and placed this distribution center in Plant City.\n\nAn interesting unknown is Sensenich Propeller Company. This business has been operating for 80 years. Headquartered in Lancaster, PA, the company consolidated its engineering and manufacturing operations to Plant City in 2023. Flying under the radar here, the company manufactures metal and composite propellers for aircraft, airboats, and unmanned aerial vehicles."
