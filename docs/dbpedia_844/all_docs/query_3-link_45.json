This propeller is manufactured using a foam core, closed mold system to produce a hollow, one piece blade. This process yields very repeatable blades with maximum strength, durability, and low weight. This propeller has the strength and durability to give you thousands of hours of trouble free flying.\n\nThis propeller features a co-cured bonded stainless steel leading edge for erosion and FOD protection. The two piece hub is manufactured from aerospace grade aluminum and is shot peened for durability and anodized for corrosion protection.\n\nOur Pitch Pin Hub System allows its users to set a broad range of pitches, using the system’s index pins to make adjustments. Simply loosen the hub clamping bolts, insert the desired pitch pin, set the blades against the pin, torque the mounting bolts and go flying! The entire pitch change process takes less than 5 minutes.\n\nThis 2 blade propeller is approved for installation on the Piper PA-18 “150” series Super Cubs with Lycoming O-320 150 HP or 160 HP engines. The blades can be trimmed from the maximum 82″ diameter to 79″ diameter.\n\nSensenich also has an optional 12″ Cub style composite spinner, available with either a white primer coat or clear coat over carbon weave. The package price is $8100, including propeller, bolts and spinner assembly.\n\nClick for Specs & Documentation\n\nImprove your Aircraft’s performance with the STC’d 2 blade propeller designed specifically for Lycoming O-360 powered Super Cubs.
