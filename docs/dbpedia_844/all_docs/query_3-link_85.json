        "text": "Sensenich Propeller - 2 Bladed Fixed Pitch - Custom Colours Available.\n\nGenuine 2 bladed fixed pitch aircraft propeller manufactured in the USA by Sensenich, Powder coated in Pastel Green and finished with White Tips - most other colours are also available so contact us for details.\n\nStripped and Powdercoated to order, lead time approximately 6 weeks on this propeller\n\n30% deposit required Initially, remainder on completion.\n\nDelivery available, please call or email for details\n\nFounded during 1932 in Pennsylvania USA, Sensenich (or Sensenich brothers as it was known back then) were originally established by 2 brothers to make aircraft propellers from laminated wood and in 1949 they expanded into airboat propellers. During that time they established a second factory for that market at Plant City, Florida under the name Sensenich wood propeller company. During the postwar years they switch production from wood to aluminium and now they are predominantly known for their 2 bladed aluminium propellers which have been in production since the 60s.These type of propeller are fitted to many aircraft including Piper Warriors and Cessna 172s, so if you’ve ever been in a light aircraft it’s very likely it was propelled by one of these propellers.\n\nMade from solid aircraft grade aluminium, this Propeller has done all of its flying hours and is therefore “Time Expired”. That means it could appear 100% perfect but in fact been on airworthy. All propellers have a logbook and all flying hours are logged - once they’ve done their hours, that’s it!\n\nNo two are identical and and there are many variants for each type often with the most subtle of differences. Be the envy of all your friends and have something truly unique, either stood in the corner of a room or fixed to a wall - nows your chance to own a timeless piece of aviation history."
