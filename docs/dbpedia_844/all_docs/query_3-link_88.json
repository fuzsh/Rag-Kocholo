        "text": "Sensenich Propellers & Bolt Kits\n\nAirpart Supply are a Factory Authorised Distributor & Stockist for Sensenich Propeller Co.\n\nEstablished in 1932, Sensenich aluminium propellers for general aviation aircraft such as Cessna and Piper, along with experimental aircraft such as Van's RV and Glassairs, are well-renowned.\n\nAll Sensenich aluminium propellers are manufactured from 2025 forged aluminium. The propellers are CNC machined and hand-finished to very tight tolerances. Each propeller then goes through a rigid 56 point inspection to assure you of the highest quality, most reliable propeller available. All aluminium propellers are vibration tested before being approved for use on any engine and come with a warranty period of twenty-four (24) months or two hundred (200) hours whichever occurs first."
