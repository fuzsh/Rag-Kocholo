Rockford is known by many nicknames the Forest City, Reaper City, Furniture City, and the Screw Capital of the World. More accurately, it should be known as the Fastener Capital of the World, but where is the fun in that?

The Rockford Region became known as the screw capital of the world around the same time the furniture making industry was dying off in the 1940’s. The demand for fasteners rose along with the demand for war-time machinery. For decades, production in the Rockford Region was heavily supported through U.S. Government contracts from the First World War all the way through the Cold War due to the region’s production and manufacturing capabilities.

By the late 1960’s the Rockford Region was ranked as the fifth largest manufacturer of fasteners in the nation. Leading to the self-proclaimed nickname “Screw Capital of the World”.
