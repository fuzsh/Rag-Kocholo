        "text": "Overview\n\nIn January of 2017, by ending chronic homelessness, Rockford became the first community in the United States to reach functional zero for both chronic and veteran homelessness. This journey began in December 2015, when Rockford reached functional zero for veteran homelessness, demonstrating that there are fewer veterans experiencing homelessness than can be routinely housed within a month. Since then, the community has worked to sustain both of these achievements as it works to end homelessness for all populations.\n\nBy reaching functional zero for veteran and chronic homelessness, the community has proven it has built a system that can ensure homelessness is rare and brief, even if new people experience housing crises over time. As part of Built for Zero, Rockford changed how its homeless response system works by adopting the core elements of the Built for Zero methodology:\n\nUsing real-time, person-specific data to know every person experiencing chronic homelessness or veteran experiencing homelessness by name and target efforts and resources accordingly\n\nBuilding a unified regional team, or a “command center,” under a shared aim of getting to functional zero\n\nUsing data to redesign Rockford’s homeless response and strategically target resources\n\nKey Milestones"
