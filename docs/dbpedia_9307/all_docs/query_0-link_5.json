        "text": "The Rockfords could be called a Seattle supergroup, but the band was actually a reunion; Chris Friel and Danny Newcomb of the band Goodness and Rick Friel of Jody Watts were in a band called Shadow with Mike McCready of Pearl Jam during the mid-'80s; in the late '90s they re-formed and added Goodness vocalist Carrie Akre under the name The Rockfords (named after McCready's favorite TV show The Rockford Files). Together, they released one self-titled album for Epic in 2000 that featured production by John Goodmanson (Bikini Kill, Sleater-Kinney, Death Cab for Cutie) and a vocal turn by Nancy Wilson of Heart on the song \"Riverwide;\" the record was critically acclaimed but the band went back to their \"day jobs\" before recording a self-released EP, Waiting, also produced by Goodmanson and released in 2004. Real Gone Music's 2-LP release (in cherry wax) features both the self-titled LP and the EP, both never before on vinyl, in a sweet gatefold package. Limited to 2500 copies!"
