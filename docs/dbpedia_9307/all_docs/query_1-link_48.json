        "text": "815 Proud\n\nEvery August 15th Rockford celebrates 815 Day. The most dominate phone number area code for our town is \"815\" and has thus developed into a symbol of pride for Rockfordians.\n\nScrew City ​\n\nRockford is known by many nicknames - one of the most interesting being Screw City or the Screw Capital of the World. This name has developed from the billions of screws, bolts, and fasteners that many factories produced for manufacturers around the world.\n\nFrom Midway to Rockford\n\nIn 1834, Germanicus Kent, Lewis Lemon, and Thatcher Blake founded a settlement they named \"Midway\", as it was located midway between Chicago and Galena, IL. By 1837, the village of Midway was renamed Rockford in recognition of the rocky river ford the settlers founded our city near.\n\nThe Forest City ​\n\nEarly settlers called it the “Forest City” because of the river valley's verdant woods. Today, Rockford still has 7,000 acres of parkland, tree-lined streets, an exceptionally green downtown, a riverside trail, and several magnificent public gardens."
