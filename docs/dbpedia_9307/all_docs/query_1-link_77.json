Donation levels begin at $250, allowing families and businesses to have their names permanently etched on a plaque at the base of the RAM Statue. It’s a win-win for education and our Booster groups, including our Rockford Band Boosters program!\n\nDonors have the option to direct 25% of their donation to the Band Boosters."
