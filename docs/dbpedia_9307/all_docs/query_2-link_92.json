        "text": "The Sensations have become one of the premier bands in the Northern Illinois and Southern Wisconsin area beginning with their much acclaimed Saturday night performance on the Oasis Stage at the 2007 On The Waterfront festival. Their popularity continues to grow as they continue to play new venues and get new fans. The Sensations are a blending of three of Rockford's favorite bands as well as RAMI Award winning and RAMI Hall of Fame bands, Bare Bones, Robin Banks and The Snaggs. The line up features Lead Vocalist - Holland Zander, Guitarist - Rick Pemberton, Bassist - Dana Buck, Drummer - Scott Ford. The Sensations bring the energy and everything you loved about Bare Bones, Robin Banks and the Snaggs and turn it into a new and exciting experience that audiences are raving about. The Sensations' performance and sound is outstanding and it infectiously fun! It is hard to take your eyes off Holland as she fronts the band! The band delivers passionate, unique, and solid performances of songs from the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s and today. The Sensations have a love of Rock music that is both intense and diverse, delivering a performance that is loaded with passion and energy."
