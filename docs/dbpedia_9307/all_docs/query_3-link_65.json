        "text": "Rockford\n\nin bloom\n\nKlehm is Northern Illinois’ top outdoor destination for families.\n\nExplore Events\n\nMark your calendar.

Our 155 acres of woodlands and botanical gardens feature a children’s garden, 1.4 miles of paved paths, 3 miles of wooded trails and much more!\n\nNancy Olson\n\nChildren’s Garden\n\nExplore Kid’s Creek for interactive stream play and frolic through our splash pad! Enjoy different kid-friendly gardens, an observation tower and oversize play structures that invite children to experience nature in a playful setting.\n\n7\n\nSpecialty Gardens\n\nprovide a showcase for themed plantings of ornamental shrubs and trees as well as annual and perennial plants.\n\nGarden\n\nPavillion\n\nThis spacious outdoor tented venue and landscaped patio is perfect for hosting wedding receptions as well as corporate and social functions.\n\nBradley & Georgann Gummow\n\nFamily Foundation\n\nEntry Water Feature\n\nThis peaceful pond, rushing waterfall, and landscaped patio is the perfect spot for a moment of reflection during your visit.\n\n★★★★★\n\nVery beautiful grounds that are maintained very well. The main walking path is wide, paved, and easy to walk, so great for strollers or people with slight walking challenges. There are plenty of places to stop, sit, and reflect, which I really appreciate.\n\nConnie Jo Holmes\n\n★★★★★\n\nMy family comes here at least twice a year to visit the children's garden and it never disappoints! It's always clean, the flowers and grounds are beautiful and the walks are always adventurous. Definitely recommend bringing a suit for the kiddos and maybe some cups if they play in the 'river' and splash ground. Nice covered gazebo w/picnic tables and lots of shaded areas.\n\nDeanna Baily\n\n★★★★★\n\nVery nice place for a relaxing walk. A getaway for stress relief. Both easy paved walking paths and nature trails for those wanting to go adventuring. Well designed for both adults and children. There is a great wonderful entertainment and water park for kids. They also create themes for people to walk through. When we were there, the theme was Big Bugs. A great getaway. Enjoy!\n\nRick Noll\n\n★★★★★\n\nNo matter your age Klehm has much to offer. The day we visited most recently areas were set for two late summer weddings and the weather was perfect. The display of sculptures was terrific this year. My grandsons love the children garden especially the water features. All of these things are great fun the peaceful beauty among such a huge variety of plants and trees. Well worth a visit.\n\nMelody Welty\n\n★★★★★\n\nI love this place. Sometimes on the trails I can forget that I'm in the middle of a 100k+ city. It is sufficiently forested to remove the bulk of the city noise and allow me to attune myself to sounds of nature. I can trek the trails for a couple of hours and not walk the entirety of the grounds. I would definitely recommend going in the fall and the spring. Nature's fireworks are on full display during these seasons. Consider buying a membership if you like places like these. Restrooms: Very clean and well maintained. Dog-friendliness: Very popular place to walk one's dog. Everyone seems to be very courteous with dogs on leashes and cleaning up after their pets.\n\nJoshua Blackwell\n\n★★★★☆\n\nThis is a wonderful place in Rockford, IL! The admission fee is very reasonable. You can bring young children for the splash park and creek. Our party had 2 4 year olds that played for more than an hour, took a break for lunch and rest room breaks and then went back to play some more. The only reason I didn't choose 5 stars is because there is so much more park to see, I want to reserve the 5th star for my next visit.\n\nBarbara J. Arnold\n\n★★★★★\n\nThere are endless beautiful things to see. You can choose paved or natural paths.\n\nKristine Maynard\n\n★★★★★\n\nVery beautiful. Nature at it's best. Tons of flowers, plants and trees. Many unique tree varieties and many are labeled. The main paths are wide and paved and there are more narrow paths that cut through the wooden areas. We brought our dog and had a great time.\n\nKen Witz"
