        "text": "James \"Jim\" Scott Rockford, who is portrayed by James Garner, is the main character on The Rockford Files. He is an ex-con working as a private detective, struggling to keep his practice afloat in the greater Los Angeles area. He lives and works in a broken-down mobile home near the ocean in Malibu, California. He drives a gold Pontiac Firebird. Rockford is the principal character of the series, and Garner was the only actor to appear in every episode of the series. In many ways, the Rockford character was a 20th-century updating of Garner’s Bret Maverick character from the Maverick TV Series.\n\nPrior To Being a Detective[]\n\nRockford served in the Army where he learned sailing. He honed his craft at sailing by selling contraband Japanese radios to the Navy guys at Terminal Island ‘under the radar.’ He would sell the tube for $17.25 and earplugs for $20.[2]\n\nAfter being busted to Private, he was promoted to Sergeant after conning the North Koreans[3] to exchange a tank for 400 cases of K rations so his encircled unit could escape. However, he was soon busted back to PFC when it was discovered he was running a string of pool halls in Busan (a Metropolitan City, in South Korea) and stealing a Major General's car.[4]\n\nHe was later wounded-in-action and awarded a Silver Star while serving in the Korean War[5] with the 24th Infantry Division. As an injured Jim is carried 15 miles in the snow by Colonel \"Howling Mad\" Smith, Jim howled like a hound dog with every step. So, Col. Smith gave him the nickname 'Hound Dog'.[6]\n\nHe was discharged in May of 1953.[7] (Based on James Garner’s age in 1953, Jim Rockford would have been 25 at the time of his discharge).\n\nAs an aside, he forgot to return his service pistol and gets a call from the army about it after 23 years.[8]\n\nA running gag in the series is that, whenever Rockford gets involved with cases connected to members of his old Division, Jim is usually in trouble.[9]\n\nAfter his service in the Army, Rockford became a successful con artist,[10] which may have led to his arrest for armed robbery and subsequent five-year imprisonment in San Quentin. Successfully proving his innocence, he received a pardon from the Governor.[11]\n\nYet, this did not wipe the slate clean, as Rockford had to hire an attorney to be free of parole requirements. All due to the carelessness of his parole officer.[12]\n\nThe Rockford Agency[]\n\nRockford is now a single, 40-something Private Investigator who lives in a rundown trailer house in sunny Malibu, California. The trailer was parked in the lot for Paradise Cove next to a restaurant.\n\nHis detective agency was founded in 1968. Early on, he preferred to only take on ‘cold cases’ – those cases that the police were not actively investigating, so as to avoid confrontation with the LAPD. The closing of these cases was unsatisfactory to Jim’s potential clients, so they hired him to solve the mystery. Eventually, these cases were referred to by the police lieutenant antagonist disparaging as \"the Rockford files.\" He also refuses to do domestic cases. He specialized in missing person cases and small-time insurance scams.\n\nHe charges a flat rate of $200 a day plus expenses for each case, which, in a running gag he seldom actually receives. Because of this, he is consistently shown to be short on money, or trying to keep creditors at bay. Over the years, he was involved in several cases for which his investigative efforts should have gained him significant bonuses, but he was never able to collect them.\n\nAt one time, in addition to other clients, he worked on a retainer basis for a major insurance company, but the company scrapped the deal when a case went sour, and Rockford lost the annual income.[citation needed]\n\nOn these investigations, Rockford drove a gold second generation Pontiac firebird. He is an outstanding driver, getting out of tricky situations when being followed.\n\nRockford preferred to outwit his opponents with his con-artist skills, rather than resorting to violence (though he was very good at it when violence was required.) Using this skill, he would also pose as insurance investigators and government officials, or he would simply invent preposterous characters and scenarios to confuse people, which usually gets them to reveal some valuable information. On one occasion, he is derisively described by a rival private investigator as “the con bull artist”.[citation needed]\n\nDespite being sharp as a tack and tough on his feet, Rockford is forever getting himself entangled with con men, mobsters, and non-paying clients that keep him from the getting any respect.\n\nHe kept his gun in a cookie jar (\"I don't shoot it, I just point it\"), and a small press in the backseat of his car to print instant business cards to go with his numerous aliases and scams.[13] He is adept at using a lockpick, which is illegal to possess in California.[citation needed]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nJim wore sport coats, slacks, and low-priced off-the-rack suits, which may appear to be ‘dressed-up’ (or semi-casual) by today’s standards, but was somewhat 'dressed-down' in the 1970’s.\n\nAlthough Jim is generally reluctant to engage in potentially dangerous situations and often describes himself as \"chicken\", when there is a need to act heroically, his actions often speak otherwise.\n\nJim enjoys fishing, and would rather spend time doing that than working. His musical tastes run to classic jazz (he has tapes of Ella Fitzgerald and Count Basie), though he also appears to appreciate country music, having attended and enjoyed a Barbara Mandrell concert.\n\nHe is frequently seen eating tacos, and sometimes has them for breakfast.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nJim maintains a close relationship with his father Joseph \"Rocky\" Rockford, a crusty, cranky semi-retired trucker, always worrying. Yet they had a warm and close relationship, which was a staple for Jim’s character.\n\nJim’s circle of friends are also very engaging. His closest friend is constantly beleaguered LAPD Sergeant (later Lieutenant) Dennis Becker, who will on occasion, albeit grudgingly, run car license plates and do criminal record checks for him in return for information on criminals, which allows Becker to get the credit for any arrests that follow.\n\nJim remains in contact with a number of ex-cons whom he met in San Quentin, most prominently is Evelyn \"Angel\" Martin, who’s hare-brained schemes and con-jobs invariably land Jim in some kind of trouble, often without his knowledge. Jim nonetheless remains loyal to him. There is also Gandolph Fitch (aka Gandy), the one-time \"Hammer of C Block,\" who never could get Rockford's name right.[citation needed] Then there is John, former outlaw biker turned criminal lawyer, who replaced Beth as Jim's lawyer.[citation needed]\n\nAnother notable friend was streetwise hooker Rita Capkovic, determined to go straight, who came to Rockford for help three times.[14]\n\nJim is also friends with a good number of fellow private eyes. The most prominent of this bunch was Richie Brockelman, who was an eager novice investigator.[15] The most memorable P.I. to visit the show was undoubtedly Lance White, the rich, elegant, and flawless male model private eye – the walking cliché who drove Rockford crazy.[16]\n\nThen, there are the array of women Jim dated. His charm, respect and endearing personality afforded him many relationships. The most notable was the on/off relationship for several years with his lawyer, Beth Davenport.\n\nLater, he had an open but still serious relationship with psychiatrist Megan Daughtery. Meghan was blind, yet fiercely independent. It seemed for a while, Jim's one true love.[citation needed]\n\nAt some point between 1980 and 1992, Jim married attorney Halley \"Kit\" Kittredge and divorced.[17] It is implied in the subsequent movies that they were a couple by 1985 at the latest, and that Kit left the marriage in 1987. However, it is unknown when they were married, or for exactly how long. They had no children.\n\nReferences in other media[]\n\nThe detective story writer Stuart M. Kaminsky has written two books with 'Jim Rockford' as the main character, entitled The Green Bottle and The Devil on My Doorstep.\n\nIn \"Ruskie Business\", an episode of the television series Veronica Mars, Logan Echolls calls the titular character \"Rockford\", referencing Jim Rockford.[18]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nPilot[]\n\n[000] The Rockford Files (March 27, 1974)\n\nSyndicated Version Retitled \"Backlash of the Hunter\"\n\nSeason 1 (1974–75)[]\n\n[101] The Kirkoff Case (September 13, 1974)\n\n[102] The Dark and Bloody Ground (September 20, 1974)\n\n[103] The Countess (September 27, 1974)\n\n[104] Exit Prentiss Carr (October 4, 1974)\n\n[105] Tall Woman in Red Wagon (October 11, 1974)\n\n[106/107] This Case Is Closed (October 18, 1974)\n\n[108] The Big Ripoff (October 25, 1974)\n\n[109] Find Me If You Can (November 1, 1974)\n\n[110] In Pursuit of Carol Thorne (November 8, 1974)\n\n[111] The Dexter Crisis (November 15, 1974)\n\n[112] Caledonia - It's Worth a Fortune (December 6, 1974)\n\n[113] Profit and Loss, Part 1 (December 20, 1974)\n\n[114] Profit and Loss, Part 2 (December 27, 1974)\n\n[115] Aura Lee, Farewell (January 3, 1975)\n\n[116] Sleight of Hand (January 17, 1975)\n\n[117] Counter Gambit (January 24, 1975)\n\n[118] Claire (January 31, 1975)\n\n[119] Say Goodbye to Jennifer (February 7, 1975)\n\n[120] Charlie Harris at Large (February 14, 1975)\n\n[121] The Four Pound Brick (February 21, 1975)\n\n[122] Just by Accident (February 28, 1975)\n\n[123] Roundabout (March 7, 1975)\n\nSeason 2 (1975–76)[]\n\n[201] The Aaron Ironwood School of Success (September 12, 1975)\n\n[202] The Farnsworth Stratagem (September 19, 1975)\n\n[203] Gearjammers, Part 1 (September 26, 1975)\n\n[204] Gearjammers, Part 2 (October 3, 1975)\n\n[205] The Deep Blue Sleep (October 10, 1975)\n\n[206] The Great Blue Lake Land and Development Company (October 17, 1975)\n\n[207] The Real Easy Red Dog (October 31, 1975)\n\n[208] Resurrection in Black and White (November 7, 1975)\n\n[209] Chicken Little Is a Little Chicken (November 14, 1975)\n\n[210] 2 Into 5.56 Won't Go (November 21, 1975)\n\n[211] Pastoria Prime Pick (November 28, 1975)\n\n[212] The Reincarnation of Angie (December 5, 1975)\n\n[213] The Girl in the Bay City Boys Club (December 19, 1975)\n\n[214] The Hammer of C Block (January 9, 1976)\n\n[215] The No-Cut Contract (January 16, 1976)\n\n[216] A Portrait of Elizabeth (January 23, 1976)\n\n[217] Joey Blue Eyes (January 30, 1976)\n\n[218] In Hazard (February 6, 1976)\n\n[219] The Italian Bird Fiasco (February 13, 1976)\n\n[220] Where's Houston?
