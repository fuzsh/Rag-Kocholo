        "text": "Can my student participate in sports and still be a part of the Band?\n\nAbsolutely! We have many student athletes in band every year. However, there may be a unique conflict that arises with a given sport. We will take those scenarios into consideration on a case by case basis.\n\nWhat happens when sports and Band schedules conflict?\n\nA performance or game takes precedence over a rehearsal or practice. When the conflict involves a rehearsal vs a practice; the student must split the time equally with both the band rehearsal and the sport practice. When the conflict involves a performance and a game, the directors will talk to the student about the issue. The best thing to do is compare schedules as soon as possible and email Mr. Phillips with your concerns and always let him know if your student has a conflict or will be arriving late. Additional information will be found in the Band Syllabus, to be handed out in the fall.\n\nIs it necessary to attend both Pre Camp and Band Camp?\n\nYes. Both Pre-Camp and Band Camp are designed for learning and improving marching technique, as well as preparation for the competitive show. Attendance is mandatory.\n\nWhen will I get the specifics about rooming and packing for Band Camp?\n\nStudents are allowed to choose their roommates and suitemates. Room sign up sheets will be at the HS sometime in May and you will be notified when they are posted. Packing information will be emailed to you around July 4.\n\nWhat happens after the Marching Band Season ends?\n\nStudents will work on concert music in one of 4 ensembles-Orange Band, Black Band, Wind Symphony and Wind Ensemble.\n\nWhat are the Band Components?\n\nWinds – All Woodwinds and Brass\n\nPercussion – has 2 components\n\nDrumline – on field, marching drums\n\nFront Ensemble – (also called Pit) all other percussion instruments, marimbas, vibes, xylos, electronics, concert drums, etc.\n\nColor Guard – students who perform with flags and other equipment\n\nRehearsals that call for Full Band include all components.\n\nDoes my student have to participate in one of the concert ensembles to be in Marching Band (and vice versa)?\n\nYes, with the exception of those who are in color guard only. Band is a full year class. We view the entire year as a well-rounded musically-educational experience. There is vital information gained in both aspects, and neither could exist at an exceptional level without the other.\n\nWhat kind of fundraisers does the Band have?\n\nRaise Right is a great year-round fundraiser (you can learn more about Raise Right here). Other fundraisers to benefit the band general fund as well as student accounts will be announced throughout the school year.\n\nWhat kind of volunteers are needed for Band?\n\nThe success of the RHS Band program depends upon strong parent involvement and support. All parents are expected to assist in some capacity. We will host an invitational (date TBD) and will need to fill approximately 185 positions that day. That is a one time event and is our biggest fundraiser of the year.\n\nIn addition, there are over 20 band committees that need your help. Some need co-chairs and all need volunteers. You will have an opportunity to learn about the committees by reading about them in the Parent Information folder on Charms. Some of them are Chaperones, Hospitality, Uniforms, and the Spirit Committee. You may sign up for as many committees as you wish. You will receive information via email about only those committees for which you volunteer. The need for a particular committee, time, place, etc., is communicated through email and members respond if they are able to serve at the event listed. Because we have a large band and a great and large group of willing volunteers, it is necessary for those who want to volunteer to sign up, so we know who is interested in participating. Jobs are assigned in advance."
