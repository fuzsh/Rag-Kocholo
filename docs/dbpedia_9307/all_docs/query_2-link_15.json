        "text": "Community instrumental ensembles have been in Rockford since 1994. This initial group featured a combination of winds, brass, percussion, and strings. Conducted by Joseph Bell, this ensemble performed a repertoire of popular tunes and light classical pieces at various venues throughout the Rockford area. In 2003, two separate instrumental ensembles were formed, resulting in a concert band and orchestra. Retired school band director Nicholas Valenziano was appointed conductor of the Rockford Community Band in 2004. With his leadership, the ensemble grew in size, all while maintaining the high musical standards established in its inception. In January 2008, Tiffany Engle became the ensemble’s third conductor. Since her arrival, the Rockford Community Band has continued to heighten its level of musicianship through the performance of more challenging literature.\n\nMore importantly, the musical development of the Rockford Community Band has helped to develop a strong and enjoyable social community. This ensemble is comprised of instrumentalists from all walks of life who simply enjoy making music passionately and meaningfully. The Rockford Community Band typically offers performances in December and May (along with other Rockford community ensembles). This group also enjoys performing at the Grand Rapids Veterans Home, local retirement communities, and Rockford’s own “Start of Summer” celebration. In essence, the Rockford Community Band is an ensemble dedicated to life-long musicianship while presenting diverse, entertaining performances to the community it serves."
