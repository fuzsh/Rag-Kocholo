I decided to do a little more research on the show.\n\nObviously, James Garner was the primary driving force behind the series success, but other elements also came into play. There was a strong supporting cast, as well as really good writing. So, here are some things you might not have known about ‘The Rockford Files.”\n\n1: Jim Rockford had a bunch of interesting messages on his machine. Altogether, there were 122 messages.\n\nAnd amazingly, almost all of them were bad news.\n\n2: Did you enjoy ‘The Rockford Files” theme song? You aren’t the only one.\n\nThe song was released as a single in 1975 and reached number 10 on the charts. I believe the category was “Best Detective Show Theme Song.”\n\n3: James Garner’s work was appreciated. He received four Golden Globe nominations and an Emmy Award for Best Actor."
