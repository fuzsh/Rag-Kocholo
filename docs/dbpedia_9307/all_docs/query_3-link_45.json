It may seem like a long process, but we are committed to the integrity and heart of our school in selecting families to accept, and also want to do our best not to waste your time or ours if CCRS is not a good fit for you. We reserve the right to deny enrollment at any time during this process.\n\nCome and see our amazing school in action! You can choose to schedule a tour and interview at the same time, or just start with the tour.\n\nThe interview will be the final step of the process and will include an in-depth meeting with the Principal and/or Assistant Principal."
