        "text": "ROCKFORD, Ill. (WIFR) - Never in 10,000 years did Rockford musician Ben Medina think he’d be playing lead guitar for alternative rock band 10,000 Maniacs, but now, he has the gig of a lifetime.\n\nOn February 27, 1988, the New York alternative rock band 10,000 Maniacs hit the iconic stage of Saturday Night Live. It was that night that Medina was hooked on the band’s sound.\n\nFrom that point on, Medina tried to record any of the band’s television performances. He says the Maniacs’ guitar player at the time, Rob Buck, virtually taught him how to play the guitar, as Medina would play back his VHS recordings to learn the chords.\n\nThe first piece of music Medina says he bought with his own money was 10,000 Maniac’s 1987 record “In My Tribe” on cassette. Around the mid-90s, Medina started going to the band’s concerts and met their manager and band members.\n\nRecently, one of the guitar players for 10,000 Maniacs had a scheduling conflict which created an open spot in the roster. The band asked Medina, who has been part of the Rockford music scene since 2010, to audition for the slot. He was later asked to be their full-time guitar player on tour.\n\nIn a Facebook group of fans called “10,000 Maniacs Stalkers,” which was created by the band, band co-creator and bassist Steve Gustafson says Medina went, “from stalker to maniac.”"
