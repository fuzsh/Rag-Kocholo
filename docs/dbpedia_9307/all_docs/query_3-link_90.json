Surrounded by majestic trees, local and regional talents work their musical magic during the summer months.\n\nMusic in the Park is in need of volunteers to serve in a variety of areas including: assisting Music Shell event staff in directing cars to parking areas, greeting patrons, selling raffle tickets, and providing basic customer service. Click here to apply for our volunteer opportunities.\n\nTickets\n\nThe majority of our Music in the Park performances are free, we do offer VIP tickets for select performance dates.
