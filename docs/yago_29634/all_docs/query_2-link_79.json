        "text": "[http://www.soapcentral.com/oltl/whoswho/renee.php Renee Divine profile - SoapCentral.com] ] in a double wedding with Asa's grandson Cord Roberts, who remarries ex-wife Tina Lord.\n\nMobster Carlo Hesser &mdash; another of Renee's exes &mdash; appears in Llanview in 1990. Asa and Renee divorce in 1992 when Asa discovers old love letters that Carlo had sent Renee, but Asa and Renee eventually wed again on May 18, 1999. Around this time it is revealed that Renee had conceived a son by Asa when they had been involved in their youth, and had put the boy up for adoption. Max Holden poses as the missing heir, but Asa and Renee's real son turns out to be Ben Davidson, adopted brother of Sam Rappaport and love interest of Asa's former daughter-in-law Viki Carpenter. Asa and Renee divorce in 2001, but remarry for the last time on February 14, 2004. The marriage ends with Asa's offscreen death on August 16, 2007.\n\nKirk Harmon\n\n\"Randolph Mantooth (May 21, 2007-July 10, 2007)\"\n\nKirk Harmon, the father of ex-baseball superstar Tate Harmon, comes to Llanview to see his son; the two share a secret. Just when it seems that Kirk is the anti-semitic and racist arsonist who has been terrorizing the city, Kirk confronts Tate, who is the real killer. Kirk takes the blame for Tate's crimes to protect his son, but when he realizes that Tate will not stop his misguided crusade, Kirk decides to tell the truth to the police. Before he has the chance, Kirk is killed in prison by a member of Tate's white supremacist group \"One Pure People.\"\n\nTate Harmon\n\n\"Chris Beetem (February 8, 2007-August 9, 2007)\"\n\nTate Harmon is a young professional baseball player, well-known and recently retired. An anti-drug lecturer, Tate comes to Llanview in February 2007 and speaks out against steroid use at Llanview High School. He is soon hired by entrepreneurs Adriana Cramer and Layla Williamson to be the model for their new men's underwear line. Tate's romantic interest in Adriana invites the ire of her boyfriend, Rex Balsom. On April 23, 2007, Tate is a guest on the daytime talk show \"The View\" and declares his love for Adriana in a \"Tom Cruise-like\" couch incident. After meeting Tate's ex-wife, who claims their marriage ended due to \"fraud\" on Tate's part, Rex outs Tate as gay on local television; the story is soon picked up nationwide.\n\nRex's assertion is soon proven untrue, but Tate hides another secret: he is a member of the white supremacist group \"One Pure People.\" Using half-Latin Adriana as a cover, Tate has been participating in OPP's recent anti-semitic and racially-motivated arsons in Llanview. Tate's father Kirk Harmon comes to town and soon takes the blame for the crimes to protect his son, but when Kirk realizes that Tate will not stop his misguided crusade, Kirk decides to tell the truth to the police. Before he has the chance, Kirk is killed in prison by an OPP member, but Rex, Adriana and the police ultimately deduce that Tate is the culprit. In a macabre endgame, Tate traps Adriana, Layla, and Vincent Jones on a rooftop, intending to kill them for their racial \"impurity.\" Rex arrives, and Tate convinces Adriana to jump off of the roof to spare the lives of her friends. Tipped off to Tate's whereabouts, Officer Talia Sahid shoots and arrests him before Adriana jumps or anyone else is harmed. Tate is convicted for his crimes and is sent to Statesville Prison on August 9, 2007; to his dismay, his cellmate is African American named Luther.\n\nDr. Stephen Haver\n\n\"Matthew Ashford (December 10, 2003 - March 22, 2004)\"\n\nDr. Stephen Haver is a psychology professor at Llanview University who specializes in human sexuality and researches serial killers and sexual predators. He becomes a favorite instructor of Jessica Buchanan. However, a friend soon confides in Jessica that Haver had demanded sex from her in return for a passing grade. Student reporter Jessica investigates, and not only discovers that the accusations are true, but ultimately finds out that Haver is also the serial killer known as the \"Music Box Killer\" who has been terrorizing the university.\n\nThe \"Music Box Killer\" strangles his victims with a red leotard and leaves a music box by their bodies as a calling card. Ironically, the police consult with Haver on the murders he commits. As the authorities get closer, Haver kills Bo Buchanan's girlfriend Gabrielle Medina and nearly kills Sarah Roberts. He kidnaps Jessica but she is rescued before he can do anything to her. In the meantime, Rae Cummings also deduces Haver's secret; he holds her hostage, and she dies when he sets the room on fire. Later, in a standoff with police, Haver is shocked as Rae enters the room &mdash; she had escaped and been kept in police protection. Rae manages to distract Haver long enough for the police to subdue him.\n\nIt is also revealed that Haver had also been the \"White Rose Killer,\" a serial killer who had been hunted by Detective John McBain years before while he was in the FBI. The killer had murdered McBain's fiancée Caitlin in her bed while she slept next to McBain in retaliation for the FBI agent's public threats to the killer in a press conference.\n\nHaver is killed by a rogue cop. It is revealed that Haver brainwashed the cop to shoot him and then commit suicide, to frame John McBain for Haver's \"murder.\"\n\nHugh Hughes\n\n\"Josh Casaubon (July 18, 2005 - September 21, 2006)\"\n\nHugh Hughes comes to Llanview as the new Assistant District Attorney, working closely with both the district attorney's office and the police. Not long after his arrival, Hugh is out with one of the many leggy models he often has on his arm and runs into Marcie Walsh, who is being ridiculed by other writers after her novel \"The Killing Club\" had been played out by a serial killer. He gives up his evening to take the drunken Marcie home, where she throws up on his shoes. This begins an unusual friendship between the playboy Hugh and writer Marcie, much to the annoyance of her ex-boyfriend Dr. Michael McBain.\n\nHugh is soon thrown into the seat of district attorney as Nora Hanen is hospitalized. His first big case is the trial of Todd Manning for the murder of pregnant Margaret Cochran. Hugh is determined to see Todd pay for his crimes, in part because Hugh himself had been adopted and he cannot rationalize to himself why anyone would want to kill a child. His belief in Todd's guilt never wavers, and he feels that justice is truly served when Todd is convicted. When it is discovered that Todd had been innocent, Hugh immediately apologizes to him for having been the one to put him in prison, even though he had been only following the trail of the evidence.\n\nHugh then discovers that doctors Spencer Truman and Paige Miller are his biological parents; Paige had put him up for adoption without telling the evil Spencer that she was pregnant. At Spencer's bail hearing for Margaret Cochran's murder, it appears that Hugh wants Spencer to go free when he agrees to offer him a $1 million bail. However, he and Detective John McBain had planned it in the hopes that Truman would lead them to the gun that he used to kill John's father, Thomas McBain.\n\nHugh is killed on September 22, 2006 in a car accident, but in a case of mistaken identity he is thought to have survived and been bandaged for his burns. In reality, it is John McBain (who had also been in the accident) under the bandages while Hugh is buried in what everyone thought was John's grave.\n\nBritney Jennings\n\n\"Katrina Bowden (September 26, 2006 and October 4, 2006)\"\n\n\"Portia Reiners (October 10, 2006-October 17, 2007)\"\n\nIn the fall of 2006, \"popular girl\" Britney Jennings targets Llanview High School freshman Starr Manning after an argument between their fathers Todd Manning and Blake Jennings, taking every opportunity to bully Starr and her friend Langston Wilde. Britney's attitude toward Starr worsens when Britney sets her sights on football player Cole, who himself is developing feelings for Starr after coming to her rescue at a dance. Trying everything to thwart Starr and Cole's new relationship, Britney discovers that Cole had been pressured into taking steroids, and uses it to her advantage. Britney spikes Cole's drink, which pushes him into a fit of \"roid rage\" during which he attacks Starr. Britney, posing as Starr, calls the police. In the aftermath, it is revealed that Cole's parents are Marty Saybrooke and the deceased Patrick Thornhart, both enemies of Starr's father Todd. Todd had raped Marty years before, and Starr's mother Blair Cramer had been romantically involved with Patrick between her marriages to Todd.\n\nStarr forgives Cole but her parents forbid her to date him. They secretly see each other, much to Britney's dismay, and Britney does all she can to split them up. Cole and Starr attend a school ski trip, each telling their parents that the other is not there. Todd, Blair and Marty arrive coincidentally and the lodge is snowed in; Britney orchestrates the reveal that Starr and Cole have spent the night together, nearly having sex. Starr and Cole run away together, but are soon caught and forced to break up.\n\nTeacher Marcie McBain coerces several students to participate in the school musical, including Britney, Starr and Cole. Though at first trying to follow their parents' orders and stay apart, Starr and Cole are soon drawn back together. Meanwhile, Britney uses fellow school student Henry Mackler to do her homework for her, falsely leading him to believe that she would date him. Henry begins to see that Britney is deceiving him, and a worried Starr and Langston encourage him to cut himself loose from Britney. Henry has been secretly taking pills to stay awake to do both his and Britney's homework; after not not having slept for two weeks, a distraught Henry steals a car. Starr, Cole, and Britney get inside and Henry drives off; acting strangely, Henry has chest pains and his vision blurs. Henry confronts Britney, but Cole manages to get Henry to drive back to school. However, when they arrive to find the police in the parking lot, Henry panics and drives the car into a tree. Starr, Cole, and Britney are unharmed, but Henry &mdash; not wearing a seatbelt &mdash; is thrown from the car to his death. Starr and Langston place blame on Britney for pushing Henry to this extreme; Britney begins to see that she had wronged Henry, and feels responsible for his death.\n\nBritney seems to turn over a new leaf, dropping her vendetta against Starr. But after Cole leaves her at the prom to be with Starr, Britney reverts to her old ways. With Todd missing, Blair decides to allow Starr and Cole, obviously devoted to each other, to date. Soon Britney learns that Cole is lying to Starr about her father's whereabouts; Cole's new stepfather Miles Laurence is holding Todd captive, but Cole is keeping quiet to keep Miles from telling the authorities that Marty had supposedly murdered Spencer Truman. The secrets come out and strain Starr and Cole's relationship, but they are soon reunited, Todd is found, Marty is exonerated, and Miles is arrested.\n\nBritney incites an argument in class between Starr and teacher Marcie, which results in Marcie's temporary suspension from her job. Britney soon announces during the week of October 15, 2007 that her parents are sending her to a prestigious boarding school in Massachusetts. Before she leaves, Britney overhears that Langston's parents had died over a year before and Langston has been living on her own; Britney calls Social Services, who take custody of Langston &mdash; despite Dorian Lord's protests &mdash; and put her in a group home pending assignment to a foster home.\n\nJanet Ketring\n\n\"Janet Zarish (April 2008 - present)\"\n\nJanet Ketring is a private nurse hired by Police Commissioner Lee Ramsey in the spring of 2008 to treat his bedridden houseguest, the amnesiac Marty Saybrooke. Ramsey, who was indirectly responsible for the accident that left Marty disabled, hopes to care for Marty during her long rehabilitation, while hiding her from his nemesis, Llanview police detective John McBain, who believes her to be dead. Unaware of Marty's ties to Llanview and Ramsey's hidden agendas, Janet accepts his word about McBain being a dangerous man and the need for secrecy regarding her patient. Janet forges a close relationship with both Ramsey and Marty, and is Marty's sole physician and caregiver during the early months of her difficult recovery.\n\nWhen Ramsey facilitates a jewel heist in order to continue paying for Marty's expensive medical treatments, he brings the wrath of the diabolical Jonas Chamberlain down upon himself. During an exchange of the Mendorran jewels, Ramsey is shot and killed by Chamberlain's thugs, leaving Marty to be rescued by Todd Manning - her rapist. When Janet returns to Ramsey's penthouse and discovers the carnage, she is shocked and horrified, fearing for Marty's life. Todd corners Janet and tells her he is her new employer, and that she will continue as Marty's nurse and keep quiet.\n\nJanet settles in at Todd's new home, and continues to care for and treat Marty alongside him. With Marty still suffering from amnesia, neither she nor Janet are aware of the true nature of Todd and Marty's twisted history, and Todd makes no attempt to enlighten them. Following Todd's orders, Janet works with him to conceal Marty from John McBain and the LPD when they search Todd's home. Just as with Lee Ramsey, Janet comes to trust Todd's word about the danger to Marty's life, and slowly she softens to her mysterious boss, while Marty and Todd grow closer and closer. During a personal conversation about their families, Janet reveals to Todd that like him, she too is estranged from her loved ones, and claims she is \"dead to them.\" But when Todd shows Janet a picture of his sister, local society figure Viki Davidson, Janet becomes mysteriously anxious and seems to recognize the woman.\n\nBrody Lovett\n\n\"Mark Lawson (April 24, 2008 - present)\"\n\nBrody Lovett is a former Navy SEAL brought to Llanview by Adriana Cramer to distract Gigi Morasco from Adriana's fiancé Rex Balsom. A hardened veteran of the war in Iraq, Brody was \"stop-lossed\" several times during his tours of duty.\n\nGigi establishes in 2007 that Brody, the father of her son Shane, had died heroically overseas while she had still been pregnant. Threatened by Gigi's connection to her high school sweetheart Rex, Adriana sends her mother Dorian Lord to get information on the deceased Brody in 2008. Meeting Brody's sister Nadine, Dorian discovers that Brody is in fact alive; disapproving of the match, Brody's mother had told Gigi he had died, and had told Brody that Gigi had moved on to another man. Further, Adriana's suspicions that Gigi had already been pregnant when she had met Brody &mdash; and that Rex is most likely Shane's father &mdash; are confirmed. She is even more discouraged to discover that Brody and Gigi's relationship was platonic, despite Brody's willingness to give her son a name and his hopes of building a family with Gigi.\n\nWith her wedding to Rex approaching &mdash; and Gigi and Rex getting closer &mdash; Adriana pays the hard-drinking and volatile Brody to come to Llanview. Brody is traumatized by his experiences in the Iraq War and embittered by what he believes was Gigi's abandonment of him. Adriana hopes Brody can distract Gigi from Rex and help keep the secret of Shane's paternity from coming out, which she fears will cement Gigi and Rex forever and doom Adriana's relationship with him. Brody still has feelings for Gigi, but is hesitant to disrupt her life. Convinced by Adriana that Gigi and Shane need him, Brody finally makes his presence known to a shocked Gigi and elated Shane at Rex and Adriana's wedding, appearing clean-shaven and sober in full dress uniform.\n\nWith Rex married to Adriana, Gigi and Brody keep up the pretense that Brody is Shane's father; Gigi feels as though she has no choice but to allow Brody back into her life, as she is unwilling to disrupt Rex's marriage or crush her son's hopes and dreams of finally knowing his \"father.\" Brody hopes to pursue a real relationship with Gigi, but she is soon wrapped up again with Rex, who separates from Adriana after discovering her machinations. Meanwhile, Brody focuses his attentions and affection on Shane, who he grows very close to, thinking of the boy as \"his son\" in every respect. Brody sees in Shane an opportunity for a new start, and takes the initiative to find employment and begin attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. During an AA meeting, Brody expresses his frustration at Shane not being his true son; Charlie Banks, who had posed as Rex's own father during a complicated deception, attends the meeting as well, but promises Brody that what he heard in AA stays inside those walls.\n\nWhen Gigi leaves town to pursue the missing Rex to Texas, a jealous Brody takes charge of Shane and the household. Having grown dependent on Shane's love and validation, Brody fears that if Gigi and Rex are to reunite, he will lose access to the most important person in his life. When local psychic Madame Delphina cryptically warns Brody that Gigi and Rex may be \"gone for good,\" Brody panics, fearing that Social Services will put Shane into the foster care system if he is unable to assert paternity. Brody uses a package Adriana secretly sent to Gigi &mdash; Rex's toothbrush, containing his DNA &mdash; to fake a paternity test which \"proves\" Brody to be Shane's father and therefore, his legal guardian in Gigi's absence. Brody's hopes are dashed, however, when Gigi and Rex return to Llanview together, and Gigi makes it clear to Brody that she has told Rex the truth about his son, and is finally ready to tell Shane as well. She asks Brody to move out of the house in light of their new circumstances.\n\nDespondent, Brody suffers a mental breakdown, trashing the carriage house and accidentally injuring Gigi's friend Marcie McBain. Lapsing into \"combat mode,\" Brody outmaneuvers Gigi and Rex by going to Shane's school and picking him up before them, then absconding with the boy to Llantano Mountain. Once there, Brody's delusions deepen, as he dons his old combat fatigues, unearths his service revolver, and begins to tell Shane about his experiences in Iraq. As Brody attempts to teach Shane survival skills, he finds himself increasingly losing track of reality, suffering vivid hallucinations from his tours of duty, including seeing Shane in the place of the Iraqi child who he accidentally killed during a raid. As his violent delusions threaten to overtake him, Brody is cornered by Police Commissioner Bo Buchanan and the Llanview Police Department, accompanied by Gigi and Rex. Desperate, Brody initially uses Shane as a human shield when the SWAT team trains their guns on him, then declares that he could never hurt \"his son\" and sends the boy to his mother. A former Vietnam vet, Bo tries to talk Brody down, but Brody's anguish and visions overcome him and he fires wildly, accidentally shooting Rex. He is then arrested by the LPD and taken into custody.\n\nOnce in police custody, Brody's condition worsens, and Bo determines that Brody is suffering from a severe case of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Having spoken to one of Brody's fellow soldiers, Bo, Gigi and Rex have been made aware of Brody's deep trauma stemming from his war experiences, and the shooting incident with the Iraqi child, who Brody continues to \"see\" outside his jail cell. When Shane visits him, Brody is unable to distinguish between Shane and the child he killed, but in a moment of lucidity, he cries out that Shane is not his son. Bo promises Shane that he will see to Brody's care and treatment.\n\nHenry Mackler\n\n\"Jonathan Groff (April 11, 2007-May 7, 2007)\"\n\nHenry Mackler is a bookish student whom the popular and manipulative Britney Jennings uses to do her schoolwork by encouraging his romantic feelings toward her. When Henry discovers the truth and confronts her about it, she gives him the cold shoulder, and so he deletes the paper he had been working on for her. The following week, a distraught Henry speeds away from school in a car with Britney, Cole Thornhart, and Starr Manning. Cole discovers drugs and realizes that Henry is under the influence, and Henry refuses to stop the car and let the others free. Soon, Henry has chest pains, and drives the car into a tree; though the others are merely bruised, Henry is not wearing his seatbelt and is thrown through the windshield. He suffers a drug-related heart attack and dies.\n\nHenry was to be the instigator in an altercation at the high school. Writers abandoned the storyline in the wake of the Virginia Tech Massacre. [ [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062595/trivia \"One Life to Live\" trivia - IMDb.com] ]\n\nEve McBain\n\n\"Lisa Banes (January 30, 2004-March 15, 2004)\"\n\n\"Lisby Larson (September 28, 2006-October 12, 2006)\"\n\nEve McBain arrives in Llanview, Pennsylvania after she is invited to a dinner party by her son Michael’s friend Marcie Walsh. After the dinner party, Eve decides to stay in town for a little while to catch up with her sons, John and Michael. Eve begins to go on a series of dates with Bo Buchanan; weeks later, Eve is abducted by the Music Box Killer, and is forced to tell Natalie Buchanan that her dead husband Cristian Vega is alive. Natalie forgives Eve for lying after she discovers that Eve had been forced to tell Natalie about Cristian by the killer. Eve returns to Atlantic City.\n\nIn 2006, John tells Eve that he is going to ask Natalie to marry him; Eve comes back to town to give John her engagement ring to give to Natalie. Upon her return, she is devastated to learn that John died in a pile-up on his way to Atlantic City. After John’s funeral, Eve gives Natalie the engagement ring as a way to remember John. Eve returns home. John is later found to be alive.\n\nhannon McBain\n\n\"Danneel Harris (March 2, 2004-December 2, 2004)\"\n\nShannon McBain, the cousin of brothers John and Michael McBain, is transferred to Llanview University after doing poorly at her previous school. After the semester ends for summer she has still received failing grades, but University President Victoria Lord Davidson gives Shannon and other failing students a last chance to pass. Students Marcie Walsh, Jennifer Rappaport, Riley Colson, and others are tasked to rebuild the recently burned-down community center. The ragtag team of students become known as \"the Love Crew\", so named for the philanthropist who was funding the community center's renovation (and re-naming it after himself). Meanwhile, Shannon begins to make eyes at River Carpenter, who is dating Adriana Cramer.\n\nShannon, unhappy about being \"forced\" into the project and not wanting to mingle with the others, is initially blamed for continued vandalism which occurs at the construction site. She is exonerated, the culprits are found and the community center is completed. The group become great friends. But Adriana catches River in bed with Shannon, and breaks up with him. After River leaves town to study at The Juilliard School, Shannon begins dating Rex Balsom. Shannon and Rex stumble upon Asa Buchanan, trapped in a hole in the woods. Shannon and Rex agree to help him &mdash; for a price. Asa agrees, and they save him. Rex and Shannon's affair goes sour when Shannon becomes annoyed with Rex's continuing dedication to his ex, Jen. On Christmas Eve 2004, Rex tells Shannon's family that she has left town. In 2005, John explains that though no longer in Llanview, Shannon is under police protection along with the remaining \"Love Crew\" survivors during the \"Killing Club\" murder investigation.\n\nPaige Miller\n\n\"Kimberlin Brown (October 12, 2004-June 30, 2005) [Brown was herself a last-minute replacement for daytime veteran Mary Beth Evans in the role of Paige. At the last minute, Evans got a contract offer from \"As the World Turns\", where she had been recurring since 2000, and opted out of the \"OLTL\" deal.]\n\n\"Cady Huffman (August 19, 2005-January 23, 2006)\n\n\"Alexandra Neil (February 6, 2006-July 27, 2007)\n\nDr. Paige Miller (formerly Truman) arrives at Llanview Hospital and is soon revealed to be the ex-wife of Dr. Spencer Truman, and begins dating Bo Buchanan. Paige is cold to Spencer, and he enjoys reminding her that he knows something about her that she would not want anyone else to know. This secret also somehow concerns Spencer's brother David Vickers, who teams up with Paige to determine Spencer's real reason for coming to Llanview. They believe he is up to something, and hope to finally turn the tables on him and reverse the power he has over them. In April 2006, the secret comes out: as a youth, David had shot police detective Thomas McBain, father of Detective John McBain. At the hospital, Paige had operated on Thomas despite the fact that she was intoxicated, and McBain had died. Spencer had covered up both crimes.\n\nDavid is arrested, and Paige's license to practice medicine is revoked. Later in 2006, however, it is revealed that Spencer actually shot McBain, made sure the detective died in surgery and framed Paige to keep a hold over her. It is also revealed that Paige had a son by Spencer and put him up for adoption, never telling Spencer. Llanview attorney Hugh Hughes is discovered to be that son, but is killed in a car wreck on September 22, 2006. By December 2006, an exonerated Paige has her medical license reinstated. Though she is slowly able to deal with her grief over Hugh, Paige continues to struggle emotionally and ultimately decides to leave town to work with the humanitarian aid group Doctors Without Borders in the Middle East. She says a final goodbye to a disappointed Bo on July 27, 2007.\n\nRay Montez"
