        "text": "Since his memorable role as Todd Manning on ABC‚Äôs One Life To Live, Roger Howarth has been an icon and fan-favorite. Despite OLTL‚Äôs 2012 cancellation, Roger‚Äôs popularity grew. That‚Äôs because he landed himself a role on ABC‚Äôs longstanding General Hospital. Fast forward to today and we all know the rest.\n\nGeneral Hospital news and spoilers report that Roger Howarth‚Äôs GH exit caused quite a stir. So much backlash for TPTB flood social media platforms. No one wanted to see Roger go, and now the GH Executives are receiving backlash for their decision not to renew Roger‚Äôs contract.\n\nAccording to GH news, GH fans petition Roger Howarth‚Äôs return. It‚Äôs true that there is a change.org petition to get Roger back on General Hospital. Evidently, fans are just as dismayed by losing Austin Holt as they were when Franco Baldwin was suddenly killed. It‚Äôs obvious the that common denominator is Roger Howarth. He‚Äôs a beloved actor in the Daytime Television community and GH fans aren‚Äôt ready or willing to let him go.\n\nOur friends over at the General Hospital Blog Facebook Page have helped us by finding the petition link. Thank You, Judith Sugiura and Nancy Melman for sharing the link in our comments section!\n\nClick the Link Below ‚¨áÔ∏è\n\n‚úçüèªPlease sign the petition! Don‚Äôt forget to check out more information in the video below!\n\nDr. Austin Gatlin Holt was shot and left to die. Immediately, GH fans feared the worst for their beloved character‚Äôs fate. It‚Äôs no secret that Roger Howarth has a dedicated Dan following. That said, it doesn‚Äôt really matter which time he played, Howarth was welcomed with open arms.\n\nGeneral Hospital spoilers and rumors regarding Howarth‚Äôs GH status after Austin was shot. Many feared the worst for Austin, dreading his sudden death. Meanwhile, other GH rumors speculated that Austin would recover. But those weren‚Äôt the only GH rumors surrounding Austin‚Äôs shooting. Additionally, GH fans mentioned the fact that they‚Äôve killed off Howarth‚Äôs roles in the past, just to bring him back to the canvas as someone entirely new.\n\nGeneral Hospital BREAKING News: Austin Holt Dies Roger Howarth Exits GH\n\nSadly, GH fan‚Äôs fears have come true. According to GH news reports, Roger Howarth confirmed that his time at General Hospital is over. He took to Instagram to share the news, along with his gratitude for his experience at General Hospital. So many had hoped that Austin would live. But the love for this character came over time. At first, many were skeptical of the Pautuck doctor and mourned Franco Baldwin‚Äôs unexpected demise. Then, Austin began to grow on GH fans despite the fizzled ikr attempt at romance with Maxie (Kirsten Storms). Finally, Austin and Ava‚Äôs storyline brought fans to the edge of their seats as Cyrus pulled the strings.\n\nRoger Howarth will truly be missed as we regret to confirm his GH Exit.\n\nIt‚Äôs a good thing that Roger Howarth‚Äôs versatility is evident through in his performances. The roles he plays tend to change up like the wanderer trying to find themselves. Over the years Howard has played many different roles in daytime television. But his iconically known role is one soap fans will never forget. Undoubtedly, Roger‚Äôs portrayal of Todd Manning is one of the most recognized roles in the genre.\n\nFurthermore, Howarth was brought on to play the iconic Franco after James Franco stepped away from the infamous role. Then, Roger‚Äôs portrayal of Franco‚Äôs unexpected demise shook the fans. Then lastly, Howarth returned yet again, this time as a mysterious a doctor from Pautuck, Dr. Austin Gatlin Holt. As it turns out, Austin is also a Quartermaine.\n\nLast month General Hospital news reports confirmed Howarth‚Äôs upcoming GH exit. I‚Äôm early October, Roger addressed Austin‚Äôs departure and explained the nature of the exit. Thankfully, General Hospital spoilers reveal that they Austin isn‚Äôt gone for good. Despite the latest cliffhanger Friday episode, GH news and spoilers confirm that Dr. Austin Holt isn‚Äôt dead. Therefore, Roger Howarth‚Äôs GH exit is only temporary.\n\nFor the full story please check out our article that was shared on October 11th. Howarth‚Äôs explanation is posted below.\n\nDaytime television star, Roger Howarth is best know for his iconic role on ABC‚Äôs One Life To Live. Sadly, the soap opera came to an end after over 43 years. Even after OLTL‚Äôs final episode in 2012, Roger Howarth‚Äôs portrayal of Todd Manning continued. That was went Howarth joined OLTL‚Äôs sister soap, the wildly popular General Hospital.\n\nHowever, due to legal issues, the character names were prohibited for use at GH. Therefore, the story shifted, Todd Manning was no more, and Roger Howard with now James Franco‚Äôs replacement as Franco Baldwin. He won over fans despite the nature of the role, and circumstances lead to a personality revamp for Franco. Another twist and turn killed off Franco, which riffled a lot of fan‚Äôs feather. Alas, Howarth returns as the odd ball doctor, Dr. Austin Gatlin Holt, son of Jimmy Lee Holt.\n\nAccording to General Hospital news reports, Howarth deals with another exit. Currently, Austin is in the thick of things. He‚Äôs involved with Sonny Corinthos‚Äôs enemy, which usually doesn‚Äôt turn out so well for the other side. Furthermore, he and Ava Jerome (Maura West) recently sparked a little something, but now she‚Äôs not so sure. Needless to say, Austin as a lot going on in Port Charles. So, why has he been missing from the canvas?\n\nRoger Howarth Explains GH Exit\n\nGeneral Hospital news and spoilers report that Howarth took to social media to share a post that explains his absence, and announces his GH recturn. Below he explains that he was off for month due to Covid and an MRI on his knee. Feeling good and feeling inspired, Howarth inspires fans to challenge themselves this month.\n\nThankfully Roger is feeling in tip-top shape and is back to work at General Hospital! What‚Äôs in store for Austin and Ava, and all the danger that consumes them?\n\nKristen Alderson made a name for herself in one of the most memorable daytime T star roles. At just six years old, Alderson landed the role. From then she was known as Star Manning, daughter of the iconic couple, Todd Manning (Roger Howarth and Blair Cramer (Kassie DePaiva).\n\nSadly, One Life To Live ended in 2012. But according to GH news, Alderson joined the cast of General Hosoital. First, she continued her Llanview role and brought Star Manning to Port Charles. Then, due to legalities ABC was no longer permitted to use the. Jaya get names from OLTL and AMC. Thankfully, that‚Äôs not the case today.\n\nKristen Alderson Pregnant!\n\nGH news reports confirm that Alderson‚Äôs boyfriend Taylor Crousore popped the question, and they became engaged on July 15th, 2023. Kristen and Taylor‚Äôs baby girl is expected in January of 2024!\n\nAlderson joined General Hospital as a crossover from OLTL. However, Starr Manning didn‚Äôt stay in Port Charles for long due to legal issues with the network. That‚Äôs when the writers brought on Kiki Jerome. Ultimately, Alderson left GH and Kiki behind in 2020.\n\nCongratulations to Kristen, Taylor, and their families on the upcoming birth of baby girl Coursore.\n\nPort Charles is about to get interesting as Blair brings over some Llanview flare. If you enjoyed Kassie DePaiva‚Äôs first day in Port Charles, then you‚Äôre in for a treat.\n\nHere‚Äôs a behind-the-scenes look at Kassie DePaiva‚Äôs OLTL reunion with Roger Howarth (Todd Manning OLTL, Franco Baldwin/Austin Holt GH). Lucy (Lynn Herring) and Tracy (Jane Elliot) and Martin (Michael E. Knight) joined in on the fun too! Anything is possible with Blair in Port Charles. Not to mention, that handsome lawyer from Pine Valley is likely to pop back in. DePaiva and Howarth go way back as one of One Life to Live‚Äôs most popular super couple of all time. Todd and Blair were GH‚Äôs Sonny and Carly.\n\nBlair Lands In Port Charles\n\nGeneral Hospital spoilers tease that it‚Äôs going to be a wild ride as Blair‚Äôs plans for Marty unravel. In the near future, Lucy learns the truth about Marty and the Deceptor. This makes Lucy questions whether or not she would even still want to marry Marty. After being lied to, and knowing that he‚Äôs capable of stealing ideas and mooching off of his ex-wife, how can she not question it?\n\nWill Blair‚Äôs plan fail once Lucy finds out that Martin stole Blair‚Äôs idea and lied about it?\n\nThe majority of General Hospital views were shocked and heartbroken at Franco Baldwin‚Äôs (Roger Howarth) unexpected and seemingly unnecessary death. Oddly enough, GH recaps recall that a tumor caused Franco to terrorize and commit other heinous crimes.\n\nAt first GH fans had a hard time grasping where the storyline was headed because Franco appeared unredeemable. In fact, many questioned the decision to cast Roger in James Franco‚Äôs role. Howarth joined GH as Todd Manning after the cancellation of ABC‚Äôs OLTL. According to soap opera history, Roger became widely known as OLTL‚Äôs Todd Manning, as the role‚Äôs popularity continually grew. However, legal reasons prohibited the use of the character‚Äôs name after OLTL‚Äôs cancellation. That‚Äôs when GH axed Todd Manning but then brought Howarth back as a Franco recast.\n\nRogers‚Äôs version of Franco made the role his own but a remorseless killer just wasn‚Äôt working for the actor or for the fans. So instead of giving Howarth the act again, Franco was diagnosed with the brain tumor that caused him to be a psychopath. He in underwent a risky surgery to remove the tumor, and that‚Äôs when Franco‚Äôs life turned around. Finally, he was able to welcome love into his life.\n\nAfter Franco‚Äôs death, General Hospital news and spoilers report Roger returned to GH as Dr. Austin Gatlin Holt in what was his third role on General Hospital. At this point, fans missed Roger so much that they‚Äôd take him any way that they could get him. Sadly, after only two and a half years, GH news and spoilers confirm Austin‚Äôs death and Howarth‚Äôs throw GH exit.\n\nIs It Possible That Roger Howarth Returns As Franco Baldwin?\n\nIs Roger holding onto the hope that Franco is in fact alive? Back in 2022, General Hospital news and spoilers share Howarth‚Äôs statement regarding the role. According to Soap Hub, Howarth revealed his thoughts when a fan presented the hypothetical. Could Franco Baldwin be alive?! He replied, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôd be great, [unlikely] I really, really enjoyed playing Franco. I was really, really lucky to be part of [that story].‚Äù When reflecting on his work as Franco with co-stars Rebecca Herbst (Liz Webber), Kin Shriner (Scotty Baldwin), and William Lipton (Cameron Webber), Howarth spoke highly of his fellow actors. ‚ÄúTo move in circles with those actors‚Ä¶ every minute was a pleasure.‚Äù\n\nAccording to GH spoilers, Howarth doesn‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs probable that Franco is alive. But that hasn‚Äôt stopped fans from holding onto hope. We loved Roger as Franco but we will take him any way we can get him! We are happy to see Roger Howarth playing Dr. Austin Holt.\n\nMany changes are happening with the cast of General Hospital. Recently, shocking General Hospital news reports confirmed the exit of two major GH stars, Steve Burton as Jason Morgan, and Ingo Rademacher as Jasper ‚ÄúJax‚Äù Jacks.\n\nFans were caught off guard but learned the details of the exits surrounding the mandate which took effect on November 1st.\n\nFollowing the news of Burton and Rademacher‚Äôs GH departures, General Hospital spoilers reveal a daytime soap vet will be joining the cast of GH.\n\nGeneral Hospital comings and goings reports claim One Life To Live star, Trevor St. John has been cast in a role on GH. Trevor St. John played Todd Manning when Roger Howarth stepped away from the role. St. John‚Äôs character was then revealed as Todd‚Äôs twin brother, Victor Lord Jr.\n\nGeneral Hospital rumors claim Trevor may have been hired as a recast for either Ingo Rademacher as Jax, or Steve Burton as Jason. Other rumors claim he may have been hired for the role of Jeff Webber.\n\nGeneral Hospital news reports have not confirmed the claims regarding Trevor St. John. We will keep you posted on any further developments.\n\nThe role of Franco Baldwin (Roger Howarth), played by OLTL and GH‚Äôs, Roger Howarth, came to an abrupt and unexpected end when he was killed by Poet Charles super villain, Peter August (Wes Ramsey).\n\nGeneral Hospital news reports confirmed that although the character, Franco Baldwin, was indeed killed with no chance of resurrection, or was also confirmed that Baldwin‚Äôs portrayer, Roger Howarth, was exiting General Hospital only temporarily.\n\nGeneral Hospital rumors speculated the return of Howarth to possibly resurface the OLTL and GH character persona, Todd Manning. Those GH rumors were later squashed, revealing that TPTB did not want to bring Manning back on the canvas since his character was involved in the rape storyline surrounding Marty Saybrooke (Susan Haskell). Howarth also stepped into the role of Franco Baldwin after actor James Franco played the part which also involved a dark side, and alleged rape.\n\nGeneral Hospital spoilers finally reveal the identity of Howarth new role on GH, as his return debut aired on May 27th. Roger is now playing the role of a doctor named, Austin. So far he has delivered Maxie Jones‚Äôs (Kirsten Storms), baby in the woods. Austin seems much different than Franco. We don‚Äôt know much about him yet, but from the first impression he gave, there seems to be a lot more light, as opposed to the dark past Franco had.\n\nHow do you feel about Roger‚Äôs new role? Could there be a future for Elizabeth Webber (Rebecca Herbst) with a man who looks just like her late husband?"
