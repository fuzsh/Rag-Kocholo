        "text": "By Jacob Newkirk\n\nWhile One Life to Live will end its 43-year run on Friday, several of that show's stars, including one with roots in the Tri-State, will stay on ABC.\n\nSoap Opera Digest reports that Kassie DePaiva, a native of Morganfield, Ky., will move to ABC's General Hospital, later this month, reprising the role of Blair Cramer.\n\nDePaiva as portrayed Blair on OLTL since December 1993.\n\nIn addition to DePaiva, several other OLTL stars - including Roger Howarth (Todd Manning), Kristen Alderson (Starr Manning) and Michael Easton (John McBain) - will also make the move to GH.\n\n\"I'm thrilled to be joining Roger, Kristen and Michael in Port Charles where all the big boys and girls play,\" DePaiva said in a message on her official website. \"They have an awesome cast and I can't wait to work with them.\"\n\nThe decision to bring the departing One Life to Live cast members to General Hospital was made by GH's new executive producer, Frank Valentini, who was demonstrably excited by the idea.\n\n\"We have a very exciting story planned for the citizens of Port Charles, with Sonny Corinthos at the center of it!\" Valentini said. \"I am confident viewers and fans alike will be excited for the arrival of John, Starr, Blair and Todd.\"\n\nABC announced last April that it would cancel both One Life to Live and All My Children. The latter show was replaced by food program The Chew in September; One Life to Live will be replaced by Ty Pennington's new series, The Revolution, which premieres on Monday."
