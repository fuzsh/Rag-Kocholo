        "text": "Yeah i know what you mean Dancc. It was an amazing scene though, even though i don't really know who they are. I've seen OTLT before but not much.\n\nSo is Todd actually dead then? I know they said he was but we are talking about a US soap And why was that guy (i think he was in Port Charles) dragging that woman, one of the victims, to the execution room?\n\nIsn't Todd one of OTLT's main characters? Whenever i've read about OLTL stuff in the past im sure i've got the impression that he is\n\n0\n\nTodd was played most famously by ROGER HOWARTH, he was a very sinister brooding sociopathic character with long hair. After Howarth left OLTL, Trevor St John took over the part and has since made it his own.\n\nTodd is infamous for leading a gang rape of heroine Marty Saybrooke in the early 90s, im not sure how he got off a life sentence.\n\nAnyhow, it was revealed he was the bastard son of Victor Lord (Victor is central character Viki Lord's father, who sexually molested her and caused her dissapear into a split personality - a really fantastic storyline that started way back in 1968. When Viki's enemy Dorian confronted her with the truth about her father raping her, Viki shattered into 6 more personalities, but thats another story entirely).\n\nBack to Todd, he claimed his inheritance and gravitated towards another Llanview pariah, Dorian's neice Blair Cramer.\n\nThey had some kids and became accepted in Llanview society, their latest story being Todd himself was kidnapped and raped by a crazed stalker named Margaret (symbolic seeing as the girl he raped himself was also called Margaret, nicknamed Marty). Margaret got pregnant and then Todd's rival Spencer coarsed Margaret into a plan to set up Todd for killing her and the baby that was the product of rape. That's why he went to death row.\n\nMargaret was of course alive, and thats why John came with her to the station, to stop the execution.\n\nI have a feeling Spencer switched the lethal injection with something else to make it look like he saved Todd's life and so Todd will be revived im sure and Spencer will cover up his own crimes in framing him.\n\nThere are tons of Todd/Blair clips of youtube that are great, and also more from this execution storyline which i really suggest u check out to get a sense of these characters.\n\nI also have access to the wonderful Dorian/Viki face off back in 95 when Dorian brought out Viki's alters. The acting is amazing.\n\ngo here:\n\nhttp://dorianvideos.com/\n\n0\n\nI've always thought that the ABC soaps were the best - and it's not because I am an AMC fan! I think that their soaps seem to straddle typical US Soap madness and serious drama. The NBC soaps are just way too silly for my liking whilsthe CBS ones (barring ATWT which I've never seen so I can't comment about it!) are a bit too slow for my tastes and The Bold and The Beautiful seems to me to be way too focused on Brooke and Ridge. Does she really have to sleep with every man?\n\nYou guys who can download the shows on a daily basis are very lucky! I tried to get them on Bit Torrent but I just can't make head or tail of it!\n\n0"
