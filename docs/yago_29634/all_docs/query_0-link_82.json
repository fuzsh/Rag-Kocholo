        "text": "Wednesday, June 10, 2009 10:35 PM ET | By Scotty Gore\n\n(SoapOperaNetwork.com) — A dashing new lawyer arrives in Llanview to match wits with legal ace Téa Delgado.\n\nSOAPnet.com is reporting that Matt Walton, best known for the role of Terry ‘T’ McDermott on “All My Children,” has been cast by “One Life to Live” in the role of Elijah Clarke. The actor has also appeared on “Guiding Light” as Dalton Reed, and even in a 2007 episode of “OLTL” as Detective Price. Primetime credits include guest shots on “Law & Order: SVU” and “Rescue Me.”\n\nThe new lawyer, originally named Elijah Kent in an audition script, will waltz into Llanview on Thursday, August 6th, after being hired by Todd Manning. As a result, the gutsy attorney will square off in court against Llanview’s seasoned prosecutor Téa Delgado. However, the newcomer has a few tricks up his sleeve, as well as couple well kept secrets, including the one Téa failed to devulge to Blair Cramer recently as the pair faced certain death in the gas-filled basement of the KAD Fraternity House at Llanview U.\n\nAnd, as if representing Todd and doing battle with Téa wasn’t stressful enough, look for Mr. Clarke to also take the case of one of Llanview’s leading couples as they tackle with an unexpected adversary. No word yet as to whether the role is contract or recurring.\n\nSON will continue to follow this story and keep you posted on any further updates.\n\nIn other news…\n\n“OLTL” has released yet another audition script, this time for the role of Ross.\n\n“One Life to Live” airs weekdays on ABC. Weeknights on SOAPnet. Check local listings.\n\nDiscussion: Walton Becomes ‘One Life’s’ Newest Leading Man"
