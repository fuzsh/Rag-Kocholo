        "text": "I was looking for a title of a fake book on Guiding Light and much to my surprise I couldn’t find a list. So I decided to create one and update it as I found more. I previously put together individual lists for Guiding Light and The Young and the Restless, but this is all soaps. Check my lists here of books from several soaps and please give me suggestions for updates if you know of any I’ve missed on any soap. I’d also like to give a shout out to the March 6, 2017 issue of Soap Opera Digest which published a short list of titles several I didn’t already had.\n\nAll My Children\n\nErica Kane worked to write her memoirs with ghost writer Mike Roy (who she then became involved with) in 1984. Her book was called Raising Kane.\n\nAnother World\n\nFelicia Gallant was an acclaimed romance novelist.\n\nFelicia Gallant’s assistant Julia Shearer wrote a successful romance novel called Savage Love in 1983.\n\nAs the World Turns\n\nSeth Snyder was a successful novelist. His first published novel was called Sabrina after he had helped then fiance Frannie Hughes find her thought dead half-sister/full cousin of the same name. After romances with both Sabrina and Frannie fizzled he moved to New York to pursue writing.\n\nEmma Snyder was tapped by her son’s publisher, Ned Simon, to take over the romance novel series that was ghost written under the pen name and series name Amber d’Amour.\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful\n\nA profile of Rick March 25, 2015 (technically a magazine, but gets credit for effort)\n\nCover 2015:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RicksPinkShirt/status/580891348032602112/photo/1\n\nRead it here:\n\nhttp://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sldbdt\n\nDark Shadows\n\nThe Life and Death of Barnabas Collins, written by William Hollingshead Loomis. The blurb lists his other best selling novels: Pride of Lions, Gold Hatted Lover, and World Beyond the Doors. This is from their parallel time storyline.\n\nDays of Our Lives\n\nAccording to the January 14, 2019 issue of Soap Opera Digest, Kate Roberts was seen reading Ladies of the Lake. This isn’t a fake book but a real novel by Ken Corday the show’s executive producer.\n\nGeneral Hospital\n\nLove in Maine by Connie Falconeri aka Kate Howard/Molly Davis. Molly wrote the original novel, but Connie stole it and edited it to make it steamer. It was published in March 2013 and the truth of the authorship came out later that year. Expanded from a script called Maine Squeeze (which IMNHO is a much better title).\n\nLust for Death by Lucy Cole. Lucy came to town as a quiet librarian. She was involved with Kevin O’Connor who used her for an alibi in his murder case. After he dumped her, she wrote a tell all book for the money.\n\nMan Landers is an advice book based on a popular advice blog of the same name. Nathan West became the front man, but the book and blog were actually written by nurse Amy Driscoll. Amy used the money from it to pay her veteran brother’s medical bills. It was published in 2017. The title is a play on Ann Landers who wrote a long running advice column in direct competition to one written by her twin sister Abigail Van Buren aka Dear Abby.\n\nThe Severed Branch by P.K. Sinclair was published in early 2018. It’s a novel written by Faison’s son Hedrick aka Peter August. It uses one of Faison’s favorite false identies as a nom de keyboard.\n\nWhen Kristina Corinthos-Davis was in the Day of Dawn cult in early 2019 they had a book called, Every Day is a New Dawn.\n\nGuiding Light\n\nThe Pirate’s Woman – A romance novel Blake reads on her honeymoon\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2013/04/08/the-pirates-woman\n\nBlake Marler’s Novels One True Love and Hearts Alonehttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2015/02/05/blake-marler-book-update-2015\n\nThe Novels of Phillip Granville Spaulding\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2011/08/15/the-novels-of-phillip-spaulding\n\n“Prom Night” – A short story by Phillip Granville Spaulding\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2013/03/07/phillip-writes-prom-night/\n\nPhillip Spaulding’s Fake Fake books from Harley’s Fantasy\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2011/02/06/phillips-fake-harley-books\n\nPhillip Spaulding’s biography of Lujack\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2013/08/28/phillips-biography-of-lujack\n\nHenry Bradshaw “Coop” Cooper Stories From Jenna\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2012/05/31/stories-from-jenna\n\nBarbara Norris (Holly’s mother) wrote a syndicated cooking column according to the December 30, 1986 issue of Soap Opera Digest.\n\nLoving\n\nStacey Donovan wrote several successful novels including 1988’s Promises to Keep.\n\nOne Life to Live\n\nVicki Lord’s then husband Sloan Carpenter wrote a biography of Victor Lord called Lord of the Banner in 1993. (The Banner was the newspaper he ran.)\n\nSanta Barabara\n\nMegan Richarson was a successful romance writer when she came to town in 1989 to work on C.C. Capwell’s biography.\n\nThe Young and the Restless\n\nA special shout out to E LeBrun who has a collection of props used on The Young and the Restless and very kindly took a photo of her fake books part of her prop collection.\n\nKatherine Moore Shepard (Kay) Chancellor’s tell all autobiography (from her own point of view of course which means a lot of distortion) was called I’m Going to Live ‘Til I Die and was co-authored with Amber Moore. Of all the fake books on Y&R this is the one I wish I could read most (except Bumpy the Camel). Jeanne Cooper, the actress who played Katherine, did do a life story for real including backstage stories about her time on the soap. It’s called Not Young, Still Restless: A Memoir.\n\nVictor Newman was the subject of not one, but two biographies that only exist in Genoa City. Victor’s often referenced unauthorized autobiography is called Ruthless: The Victor Newman Story, and was written by Leanna Love under the pen name Nora Randall. His friend Douglas Austin was working on an approved biography, parts of which Leanna lifted and Austin never finished his book after that scandal hit. After Leanna got to know Victor (before he found out she had written Ruthless) she felt she hadn’t done him justice and published an authorized and more balanced biography under her real name Victor Newman – The Man and the Myth by Leanna “Love” Randolph. Scott Granger started work on a second official biography in 2017, but the storyline was scrapped while the book was still in the research stage. Like Jeanne Cooper, Eric Braeden who plays Victor has written his real life biography named after Victor’s favorite catchphrase, I’ll Be Damned: How My Young and Restless Life Led Me to America’s #1 Daytime Drama.\n\nWhile Nina Webster worked on at least one other book and did the initial draft for a movie based on Kay’s book Live Until I Die, I have only found the title of one of her published books. A Cry in Thin Air was based on Nina’s introduction story where she was pregnant by a juvenile delinquent named Jimmy and the home for pregnant girls she ended up in Geona City actually ended up being a front for a baby stealing ring (Rose Deville, criminal extraordinaire). Nina spent years hunting for her first born son in real time and eventually he was revealed in the person of federal officer Ronan. Ronan had read the book after discovering his true identity (a nifty feat since his adoptive parents were unaware of Nina’s name and identity and it didn’t appear on the paperwork) and used the information in the book to track down his biological father who had died of the same rare disease Ronan suffered from until he was cured by a transplant from his half-brother via Nina, Chance.\n\nTraci Abbott published at least three novels. Echoes of the Past was a novelized account of her life of living in her sister Ashley Abbott’s shadow. Her second novel was called Epitaph for a Lover. Traci was working on a third novel when she moved to New York. No further progress has been reported on air and the title for the third book wasn’t included in the reference I found. Just recently I found another title. I’m not sure whether this was the third book she was working on when she moved to New York or if this was in fact a fourth novel, but thanks to E LeBrun we know there was a book by her used on a set called On the Wings of Idiots. Still waiting for a Work In Progress mention guys!\n\nLori Brooks wrote two known novels. The more well known is In My Sister’s Shadow which was a lightly veiled version of her story of her life with her famous pianist sister. The second was called Naked at Dawn.\n\nThere are also children’s books only for the children of Geona City. The children of Genoa City love the children’s series Bumpy the Camel. The author is still turning out new books in this wonderful series that has sold out on first day offerings at the local Geona City bookstore. The author does not live in Geona City.\n\nKnots Landing\n\nCapricorn Crude by Valene Ewing – based on her experiences with the Ewing family\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nNote: These are from movies not soaps, but Mental Floss also shared a list of Fake books.\n\nhttp://mentalfloss.com/article/65185/12-fake-books-drive-plots-your-favorite-movies\n\nAlso, a personal favorite from TV, the Honeybunnies:\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2011/11/04/hunnybunnies\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939. This blog is an effort to make it easy to find Guiding Light and especially Manny online. Check back here for her blog, find fanfic previews and fake WSPR newscasts on her YouTube, find podcasts that look back to old shows and audios of her fanfics on Blog Talk Radio, and finally follow her on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nI was very pleased to find this three part history of Guiding Light. I don’t think it’s 100% accurate, but cleary had access to some records we don’t, like the cast lists. Also, they interviewed people that were involved with the soap in the early days. The first part I didn’t bother scanning for photos because of the color of the original, but I think the yellow, while not as good as white, is still OK to see the photos.\n\nDenis, Paul. “The Story of CBS-TV’s The Guiding Light” (Part 2 of 3). Daytime TV. October 1974 Vol. 5, no. 5, pp. 16-22, 50, 52, 54.\n\nThe Bill Bauer Role\n\nBill Bauer, originally played by Lyle Sudrow, was married to Bertha and became the father of Michael and Ed.\n\nSudrow left in 1956 and moved to Hollywood with his wife, Diana Cheswick, and their daughter, Nicole. Eugene Smith played Bill Bauer, and the character was declared dead in 1965 when a plane he was on was missing. But seven months later, Bill Bauer was brought back into the story and this time Ed Bryce was playing the role.\n\nMarried Actors\n\nThe only time Guiding Light has had a married acting team on the show at the same time was when Richard Morse (Karl) was playing the sweetheart to his real wife, Judy Robinson, who was portraying Robin Holden, in 1959. In the story, Morse wanted to marry Judy, but instead she married his best friend in 1960. (In their real life, they subsequently were divorced.)\n\nBlack Actors\n\nGuiding Light has employed some of the finest actors, James Earl Jones, who went on to stage and movie fame, portrayed Dr. Jim Frazier and Rubby Dee his wife, Nurse Martha Frazier. Later, Cecily Tyson played Nurse Frazier. Olivia Cole portrayed Deborah Mehran, Janet Mason Norris’ best friend and secretary to Dr. Sarah McIntyre, in 1973.\n\nGil Mehran was first played by David Pendleton and later by James Preston (who subsequently moved over to Another World).\n\nFran Myers\n\nFran Myers was 14 1/2 when she became Peggy Scott in 1964. As the daughter of Ben Scott (Bernard Kates), she literally grew up in full view of the TV audience. In 10 years, she has become a beautiful girl and an accomplished actress.\n\nAs Peggy, she subsequently married Johnny Fletcher, and is now the mother of Billy on the show.\n\nErnest Graves\n\nErnest Graves played Alex Bowden from 1960 through 1966. He says he started as a villain and then became a good guy, and they finally sent him off to Switzerland. In the story, Bowden had a fondness for young girls and, says Graves, “People were always yelling at me, ‘Leave that girl alone!'” Once, when he was particularly nasty in the story, an irate lady recognized him in a supermarket and ran her shopping cart into his leg.\n\nHe looks back with admiration at the skill of director Walter Gorman (who died a couple of years ago). “One day, an actress broke her leg, and it was 10:30am and we were worried, but Walter said, “I’m calling Nancy Malone, so don’t worry!’ Nancy arrived, glanced at the script, and did the show perfectly!'”\n\n(Graves is now on One Life to Live, playing Victor Lord.)\n\nThe Impact\n\nJames Lipton made several brief trips to Hollywood during the time he was portraying Dr. Dick Grant on The Guiding Light.\n\nOne day he happened to be having lunch in the Warner Brothers commissary — and a movie commissary is filled with blase people who would not raise an eyebrow if the biggest star walked in.\n\nBut when the waitress spotted Lipton, she murmured, “My God!….You’re not Dr. Grant?!’ When Lipton admitted he was Dr. Grant, she dropped her loaded tray and swooned. And then, amidst the noisy confusion, the rest of the waitresses lined up for an autograph of Dr. Grant.\n\nIt’s possible that some movie stars are still brooding about the day a New York soap opera actor took the spotlight away from them right in their home grounds. Lipton also recalls that Lena Horne, Cole Porter, and Tallulah Bankhead were among his most loyal fans. They watched The Guiding Light … and loved it!\n\nThe late Theo Goetz, to his dying day, could never quite believe how important he had become because of his Papa Bauer portrayal. He used to brood: “Am I Theo Goetz who plays Papa Bauer or am I really Papa Bauer who dreams he’s Theo Goetz?”\n\nTheo loved reading his fan mail and marveled at the marriage proposals he received. When the show decided to reveal his 65th birthday on the air and invite viewers to send in a card, Theo was worried that no one would write. And so he begged his corner groceryman to send in a card. But when 26,000 cards came in almost overnight, Theo was stunned.\n\nCharita Bauer, through the years, has been continually startled at the warm reception she receives no matter where she is. People recognize her, even in Ireland or London or Paris. She was stepping into a gondola in Venice once, when a woman came rushing up, gasping, “Don’t you play Bertha Bauer on The Guiding Light? And wouldn’t you come over to meet my mother?”\n\nAnother time, she was visiting backstage at the Metropolitan Opera House when opera star Grace Bumpry recognized her. “This is a thrill for me,” said Charita, and asked Miss Bumpry for HER autograph.\n\nDon Stewart (playing Michael Bauer) has a thriving singing career on the side, yet he hesitates to quit Guiding Light. He is constantly recognized as Michael Bauer everywhere he goes, and he appreciates what Guiding Light has done for him. He’s gained more fame on GL than all his years in Hollywood movies and nighttime TV.\n\nThe Cast in the 1960s\n\nIn 1960, the cast consisted of Charita Bauer (Bert Bauer), Ellen Demming (Meta Roberts), Theo Goetz (Papa Bauer), Bernard Grant (Dr. Paul Fletcher), Joan Gray (Ann Fletcher), Ed Bryce (Bill Bauer), Judy Robinson (Robin Holden), James Lipton (Dick Grant), Lynne Rogers (Marie Grant), Michael Allen (Michael Bauer), Joe Campanella (Joe Torina), Pat Collins (Billy Bauer), Les Damon (Dr. Bruce Banning), Connie Lembcke (Amy Sinclair), and Carson Woods (Phillip Collins).\n\nBy 1962, the cast included: Ellen Demming (Meta Banning), Barnard Hughes (Dr. Bruce Banning), Charita Bauer, Theo Goetz, Bernard Grant, Elizabeth Hubbard (Ann Fletcher), Ed Bryce, Nancy Malone (Robin Holden), James Lipton, Lynne Rogers, Paul Prokop (Michael Bauer), Pat Collins, Carson Woods (Phillip Collins), Ernest Graves (Alex Bowden), Barbara Becker (Doris Crandall), Phil Sterling (George Hayes), John Boruff (Henry Benedict), and Kay Campbell (Helene Benedict).\n\nIn 1964, the cast has added Ellen Weston (Robin Bowden), Sandy Smith (Julie Conrad), Chase Crosley (Jane Fletcher), Donald Melvin (Johnny Fletcher).\n\nBy 1967, the cast consisted of Ed Bryce, Charita Bauer, Robert Gentry (Ed Bauer), Theo Goetz, Bernard Grant, Gillian Spencer (Robin Fletcher), Bernard Kates (Ben Scott), June Graham (Maggie Scott), Francie Myers [Blog Ed.

Then Christopher Wines became Marty Dillman, Paul McGrath played Dr. Gavin Hamilton, Paul Carpinelli became Flip Malone and Robert Pickering was Michael Bauer, Phil Sterling, Chase Crosley dropped out.\n\nBy 1969 Caroline McWillimas was playing Janet Mason, Ray Fulmer was Lee Gentry, Michael Durrell played Peter Wexler, Paul Collins was Tyler Mead, Chris Sarandan played Tom Halverson, Olivia Cole was Deborah Mehran, Jane Sarnol was Kate Pearson, Elissa Leeds was Hope, Vince O’Brien was Grove Mason, Millette Alexander was the new Dr. Sarah McIntyre, Don Stewart took over as Michael Bauer, Mart Hulswit the new Ed Bauer, Marion Lauer was Miss McHenry.\n\nImportant Roles\n\nCertain characters are so vital so the storyline that new actors are brought in when an actor leaves.\n\nFor instance, Lyle Sudrow and then Eugene Smith and finally, Ed Bryce have played Bill Bauer.\n\nMichael Bauer has been portrayed by Glenn Walken as a child and by Michael Allen, Gary Pillar, Robert Pickering and now by Don Stewart as an adult.\n\nBilly Bauer was played by Pat Collins in 1962, and when the character was brought back as an adult in 1966, it was being played by Robert Gentry as a doctor. When Gentry left in 1969, Mart Hulswit took over.\n\nRobin Holden through the years was played by Judy Robinson, Zina Bethune, Abigail Kellogg, Nancy Malone, Gillian Spencer. The character was Robin Holdin Bowden Fletcher when she was finally written out.\n\nJohnny Fletcher was portrayed by Daniel Fortas, Donnie Melvin, Don Scardino and finally by Erik Howell who left in 1972.\n\nHenry Benedict was played by John Beoruff, who also was a co-writer of the show at one time, Paul McGarth also played the role.\n\nThe bitchy character of Charlotte Bauer was first played by Victoria Wyndham and from 1971 to 1973 by Melinda Fee, who was then “killed off.”\n\nHope Bauer, daughter of Michael Bauer, was created by Paula Schwartz and then taken over by Elissa Leeds, who dropped out last year.\n\nDr. Sarah McIntyre was created by Patricia Roe in 1967, and was then played by Jill Andre, with Millette Alexander taking over in 1969.\n\nDr. Joe Werner was created by Ben Hayes. Ed Zimmermann suceeded him in 1967 and after Zimmermann died in 1972, Berkeley Harris was brought in and then Anthony Call.\n\nStanley Norris was first played by Michael Higgins and then by William Smithers.\n\nBarbara Norris was a role created by Augusta Dabney, and Barbara Berjer took over in 1970 after having played Claire Cassen for six years on As the World Turns.\n\nAdam Thorpe was created by Robert Gerringer and then Robert Milli succeeded him.\n\nPeter Wexler was first played by Leon Russom, and Michael Durrell took over until he left last year.\n\nBilly Dee Williams and then James Earl Jones both played Dr. Jim Frazier.\n\nCecily Tyson and Ruby Dee played Nurse Martha Frazier.\n\nLois Holmes and then Kate Harrington portrayed Muriel Conway.\n\nPeter Greene and then Dan Hamiliton played David Vestid.\n\n1966 Cast Review\n\nFourteen years after Guiding Light had premiered on TV, the characters and their approximate age of their show lives shaped up this way:\n\nBertha and Bill Bauer (Charita Bauer and Ed Bryce). The Bauer family continues to be the backbone of this serial.\n\nPapa Bauer (Theo Goetz), the patriarch, held in great affection by the audience.\n\nMichael Bauer, the elder Bauer son, very much on stage since 1952 and written out of the story about a year ago for conflict reasons.\n\nDr. Ed Bauer (Robert Gentry), the younger Bauer son, a resident in surgery at Cedars Hosptial, on stage a year.\n\nDr. Paul Fletcher (Bernard Grant) has his own clinic adjacent to home. He is also a GP on staff at Cedars Hospital. On show about 10 years.\n\nRobin Fletcher (Gillian Spencer), Paul’s second wife, part of the show over 10 years, from childhood to present. Her mother, Kathy, was one of the original lead characters and died in Robin’s childhood.\n\nJohnny Fletcher (Don Scardino), age 18 and Paul’s son by his first marriage, on show six years.\n\nJane Hayes (Chase Crosley), Paul’s half-sister and part of the story five years. She and George have a six-month-old daughter.\n\nGeorge Hayes (Philip Sterling), a lawyer and married to Jane. On the show 5 years.\n\nMrs. Maggie Scott (June Graham) Bill’s former co-worker and mistress. On the show five years.\n\nPeggy Scott (Francie Myers), Maggie’s 17-year-old daughter. On show two years.\n\nBen Scott (Bernard Kates), Peggy’s father and Maggie’s husband. On the show a year.\n\nLeslie Jackson (Lynne Adams), a volunteer aide at Cedars Hospital. In her early 20s and in love with Ed Bauer. On the show six months.\n\nDr. Stephen Jackson (Stefan Schnabel), chief of surgery at Cedars Hospital. On the show six months.\n\nDr. Joe Werner (Ben Hayes), Dr. Jackson’s senior resident. On show six months.\n\nDr Jim Frazier (James Earl Jones), a senior resident at Cedars. On show six months.\n\nMartha Frazier (Cecily Tyson), Jim’s wife and a nurse.\n\nFirst Heart Transplant\n\nThe Guiding Light is the first daytime serial to dramatize a heart operation.\n\nIn 1967 it staged a two-day operation, using real transplant surgical equipment. There was no blood or knife cutting into flesh shown on camera, but everything else was authentic. The cast and crew worked long hours to do the operation correctly, and Ed Bryce (Bill Bauer) played the patient. Paul McGarth portrayed the heart specialist, assisted by Stefan Schnabel (Dr. Stephen Jackson) and Ed Zimmermann (Dr. Joe Werner).\n\nWhen the heart was at last transplanted and the incision sewn up, the director told Ed Bryce, that he could get up from the operating table. But Bryce didn’t move; he had gone off to sleep.\n\nMart Hulswit\n\nMart Hulswit took over as Dr. Ed Bauer on Jan. 1, 1969.\n\nHe had worked for three years with the NY Shakespeare Festival and appeared in a few movies and many nighttime TV shows, but it’s been Guiding Light that put him on the map.\n\nHe’s been in the Top Ten as Best Actor in our Readers’ Poll once every three or four months, and in Runners Up the rest of the time. He and Don Stewart are easily the most popular actors on The Guiding Light.\n\nWhen asked if he’s like the character he portrays, he says, “Ed is more aloof in public than I am. He has more scientific intellect than I, and he has conquered many more problems that I hope I’ll ever have. I respect him; he’s quite a guy, and it’s too bad he can’t be happier.”\n\nTeen Fan\n\nThrough the years, Guiding Light has built a tremendously loyal audience, of course. And perhaps one of its most remarkable loyal viewers is John Genovese, 17, at 696 River Road, Cos Cob, Conn. 06807.\n\nHe has kept records of the storyline, the cast, the music etc. of the show, having watched it since he was a child, and asking his mother for facts about the show that took place before he was born. Despite an inordinate interest in certain daytime serials, he remains a first-rate student in school. Last year, he wrote a history of The Guiding Light as a school project.\n\nFirst Pregnancy Shown\n\nAs with most serials, pregnant actresses were carefully filmed so that their condition was hidden. However in 1966, Guiding Light decided to handle Gillian Spencer‘s real-life pregnancy differently. Since she was happily married in the story, the show let her be pregnant on camera. But in the story she lost her baby. When Chase Crosley was pregnant, the story let her bear the baby, too.\n\nThis serial ususally permits its actresses six weeks off to have their baby, but often lets this stretch to eight weeks. But that time, most actresses want to get back into the story.\n\nFan Clubs Help\n\nThere’s been a big increase in fan clubs for daytime actors, and two Guiding Light actors, Don Stewart and Mart Hulswit, undoubtedly have the most dynamic fan clubs on Guiding Light.\n\nDon’s fan club is headed by Ruth Paff of 646 Pontius Road, Cincinati, Ohio 4238, and Sue Steele, 21 Seward St. Apt. #E-5, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866.\n\nMart’s fan club is run by Nancy Dingus, RD 3, Box 134, Elizabeth, Penn, 15037.\n\nTony Call (Dr. Joe Werner) now also has a fan club, and its presdient is Elizabeth Papadinecz, 1424 139th St. Whitstone NY, 11357.\n\nHow the Casting is Done\n\nThe big detergent company, Proctor and Gamble, owns The Guiding Light, which is produced for it by the Compton ad agency in New York.\n\nThe serial is cast by Mrs. Betty Rea, who has an office in Compton. It’s her job to sift through hundrends of aspiring actors and actresses, and to recommend to producer Lucy Rittenberg and Proctor and Gamble her selections. She has “open interviews” on Monday, Thursday, and Friday mornings in her office. Actors wishing to see her may phone and ask for an appointment. She casts the extras or the under-fivers (actors who have less than five lines of dialogue), and speaking parts for brief roles, and those long-running roles that are put under contract.\n\nMrs. Rea starts with a “character breakdown of the role” from the writers, and then she seeks out actors who fit the qualities required.\n\nWhen a character is slated to have a relationship with somebody already in the cast, then the actor is asked to do scenes with the person he’ll beworking with. For instance, when Ed Zimmermann (Dr. Joe Werner) died, actors auditioning for the Werner role were asked to play scenes with Millette Alexander, who plays Werner’s wife, Sarah.\n\nSometimes, an actor is auditioned in another city and brought to New York, Don Stewart, for example, was auditioned in Hollywood and hired. Some are seen on other serials and, when their contracts are up, are sought out. Tony Call and Carol Teitel, for instance, had been working on The Edge of Night. Peter MacLean was remembered from Where the Heart Is. Robert Mili had been seen on Another World. Barabara Berjer came over after had been “killed off” on As the World Turns.\n\nSometimes a role is changed so that a fine actor can be hired. Lilia Skala, for instance, was auditioned for the role of Mrs. Dunbar, but her European accent ruled her out for that role. So Guiding Light changed the character to Mrs. Hoffman, which permitted an accent… and that’s how Lilia Skala was added to the cast.\n\nFat Captions\n\n1960: When Theo Goetz was 65, the show suggested the viewers might want to congratulate him personally.

So I decided to create one and update it as I found more. I previously put together individual lists for Guiding Light and The Young and the Restless, but this is all soaps. Check my lists here of books from several soaps and please give me suggestions for updates if you know of any I’ve missed on any soap. I’d also like to give a shout out to the March 6, 2017 issue of Soap Opera Digest which published a short list of titles several I didn’t already had.\n\nAll My Children\n\nErica Kane worked to write her memoirs with ghost writer Mike Roy (who she then became involved with) in 1984. Her book was called Raising Kane.\n\nAnother World\n\nFelicia Gallant was an acclaimed romance novelist.\n\nFelicia Gallant’s assistant Julia Shearer wrote a successful romance novel called Savage Love in 1983.\n\nAs the World Turns\n\nSeth Snyder was a successful novelist. His first published novel was called Sabrina after he had helped then fiance Frannie Hughes find her thought dead half-sister/full cousin of the same name. After romances with both Sabrina and Frannie fizzled he moved to New York to pursue writing.\n\nEmma Snyder was tapped by her son’s publisher, Ned Simon, to take over the romance novel series that was ghost written under the pen name and series name Amber d’Amour.\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful\n\nA profile of Rick Forrester March 25, 2015 (technically a magazine, but gets credit for effort)\n\nCover 2015:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RicksPinkShirt/status/580891348032602112/photo/1\n\nRead it here:\n\nhttp://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sldbdt\n\nDark Shadows\n\nThe Life and Death of Barnabas Collins, written by William Hollingshead Loomis. The blurb lists his other best selling novels: Pride of Lions, Gold Hatted Lover, and World Beyond the Doors. This is from their parallel time storyline.\n\nDays of Our Lives\n\nAccording to the January 14, 2019 issue of Soap Opera Digest, Kate Roberts was seen reading Ladies of the Lake. This isn’t a fake book but a real novel by Ken Corday the show’s executive producer.\n\nGeneral Hospital\n\nLove in Maine by Connie Falconeri aka Kate Howard/Molly Davis. Molly wrote the original novel, but Connie stole it and edited it to make it steamer. It was published in March 2013 and the truth of the authorship came out later that year. Expanded from a script called Maine Squeeze (which IMNHO is a much better title).\n\nLust for Death by Lucy Cole. Lucy came to town as a quiet librarian. She was involved with Kevin O’Connor who used her for an alibi in his murder case. After he dumped her, she wrote a tell all book for the money.\n\nMan Landers is an advice book based on a popular advice blog of the same name. Nathan West became the front man, but the book and blog were actually written by nurse Amy Driscoll. Amy used the money from it to pay her veteran brother’s medical bills. It was published in 2017. The title is a play on Ann Landers who wrote a long running advice column in direct competition to one written by her twin sister Abigail Van Buren aka Dear Abby.\n\nThe Severed Branch by P.K. Sinclair was published in early 2018. It’s a novel written by Faison’s son Hedrick aka Peter August.

(The Banner was the newspaper he ran.)\n\nSanta Barbara\n\nMegan Richardson was a successful romance writer when she came to town in 1989 to work on C.C. Capwell’s biography.\n\nThe Young and the Restless\n\nA special shout out to E LeBrun who has a collection of props used on The Young and the Restless and very kindly took a photo of her fake books part of her prop collection.\n\nKatherine Moore Shepard (Kay) Chancellor’s tell all autobiography (from her own point of view of course which means a lot of distortion) was called I’m Going to Live ‘Til I Die and was co-authored with Amber Moore. Of all the fake books on Y&R this is the one I wish I could read most (except Bumpy the Camel). Jeanne Cooper, the actress who played Katherine, did do a life story for real including backstage stories about her time on the soap. It’s called Not Young, Still Restless: A Memoir.\n\nVictor Newman was the subject of not one, but two biographies that only exist in Genoa City. Victor’s often referenced unauthorized autobiography is called Ruthless: The Victor Newman Story, and was written by Leanna Love under the pen name Nora Randall. His friend Douglas Austin was working on an approved biography, parts of which Leanna lifted and Austin never finished his book after that scandal hit. After Leanna got to know Victor (before he found out she had written Ruthless) she felt she hadn’t done him justice and published an authorized and more balanced biography under her real name Victor Newman – The Man and the Myth by Leanna “Love” Randolph. Scott Granger started work on a second official biography in 2017, but the storyline was scrapped while the book was still in the research stage. Like Jeanne Cooper, Eric Braeden who plays Victor has written his real life biography named after Victor’s favorite catchphrase, I’ll Be Damned: How My Young and Restless Life Led Me to America’s #1 Daytime Drama.\n\nWhile Nina Webster worked on at least one other book and did the initial draft for a movie based on Kay’s book Live Until I Die, I have only found the title of one of her published books. A Cry in Thin Air was based on Nina’s introduction story where she was pregnant by a juvenile delinquent named Jimmy and the home for pregnant girls she ended up in Geona City actually ended up being a front for a baby stealing ring (Rose Deville, criminal extraordinaire). Nina spent years hunting for her first born son in real time and eventually he was revealed in the person of federal officer Ronan. Ronan had read the book after discovering his true identity (a nifty feat since his adoptive parents were unaware of Nina’s name and identity and it didn’t appear on the paperwork) and used the information in the book to track down his biological father who had died of the same rare disease Ronan suffered from until he was cured by a transplant from his half-brother via Nina, Chance.\n\nTraci Abbott published at least three novels. Echoes of the Past was a novelized account of her life of living in her sister Ashley Abbott’s shadow. Her second novel was called Epitaph for a Lover. Traci was working on a third novel when she moved to New York. No further progress has been reported on air and the title for the third book wasn’t included in the reference I found. Just recently I found another title. I’m not sure whether this was the third book she was working on when she moved to New York or if this was in fact a fourth novel, but thanks to E LeBrun we know there was a book by her used on a set called On the Wings of Idiots. Still waiting for a Work In Progress mention guys!\n\nLori Brooks wrote two known novels. The more well known is In My Sister’s Shadow which was a lightly veiled version of her story of her life with her famous pianist sister. The second was called Naked at Dawn.\n\nThere are also children’s books only for the children of Geona City. The children of Genoa City love the children’s series Bumpy the Camel. The author is still turning out new books in this wonderful series that has sold out on first day offerings at the local Geona City bookstore. The author does not live in Geona City.\n\nKnots Landing\n\nCapricorn Crude by Valene Ewing – based on her experiences with the Ewing family\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nNote: These are from movies not soaps, but Mental Floss also shared a list of Fake books.\n\nhttp://mentalfloss.com/article/65185/12-fake-books-drive-plots-your-favorite-movies\n\nAlso, a personal favorite from TV, the Honeybunnies:\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2011/11/04/hunnybunnies\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.

This collection of Odds and Ends related to various soaps that someone may want to know some time. Look for another odds and ends post soon.\n\nThe soaps were rejecting participating in the Daytime Emmys because of problems where two awards were pulled back.
