        "text": "Quiz Answer Key and Fun Facts\n\n1. It is a miracle that the soap was able to get audiences to accept anyone as Todd Manning after Howath's dynamic performance. The success in this case stemmed from St. John's talent and a carefully constructed plot. St. John first arrived in Llanview not as Todd, but as the brother of which villain?\n\nAnswer: Mitch Lawrence\n\nThe Walker Lawrence story line was a brilliant strategy to lead audiences to accept a difficult but neccessary recast. Increasingy obvious clues of the character's true identity led viewers to guess it was Todd, and we wanted to be right. St. John's subtly nuanced portrayal made the plot successful. It was a rare marriage of an insightful writing team and an excellent actor.\n\n2. Blair finally confronts the character with the fact that he is Todd. This great St. John/DePavia scene took place near which holiday?\n\nAnswer: Christmas\n\nThe chemistry between Todd and Blair was essential in this very challenging recast. This scene proved these actors could deliver the raw rage that was an essential component of the complex relationship.\n\n3. Although he originally comes to Llanview to seek vengeance from the Buchanan clan, Spencer Truman's evil slowly spreads until most of the town's residents are his targets. Which of the following characters plays a key role in his plot against Todd?\n\nAnswer: Margaret Cochran\n\nCrazy Margaret rapes Todd in order to have a child. Discovering the pregnancy, Truman enlists Margaret's help in destroying Todd. After faking death by drowning and framing Todd as a murderer, Margaret hides out in an island paradise while Todd is tried, runs, and faces execution.\n\nAfter Todd is given a lethal injection, Truman is forced to save him when John and Natalie arrive with a very-much-alive Crazy Margaret.\n\n4. Todd seems to have a connection with Margarets, one of whom uses the diminutive Marty and is raped by a college-aged Todd and the other of whom rapes him. After being reunited with Blair months following being raped, Todd gets drunk and faces an imaginary ghost of Marty Saybrook, which taunts him about the turned tables. Where is he when Marty seems to appear to him?\n\nAnswer: At Victor Lord's tomb in the mausoleum\n\nFinding himself unable to make love to Blair, Todd gets drunk and, in his mind, is confronted by the taunting ghost of Marty at his father's tomb. Although she later returns with her son Cole and presents Todd and his family with new challenges, this appearance of Llanview's most notable rape victim featured Susan Haskall, who originated the role.\n\n5. Todd and John McBain seem to be attracted by the same women. They have romantic or sexual ties with several of the same Llandview women at different times. Which of these women was not involved either with or without consent with both Todd and John?\n\nAnswer: Natalie Buchanan\n\nTodd first meets Marty while they are both in college. When Marty begs Todd to stay with her after a one-night stand, Todd rejects her and later rapes her at his fraternity's Spring Fling. When Marty returns with her teen-aged son Cole, she has a lengthy romance with John and is eventually engaged to him. John becomes involved with Evangeline, but the pair splits when Evangeline learns of his role in imprisoning Christian Vega. Later, during one of his frequent splits with Blair, Todd is attracted to Evangeline.\n\nWhile the chemistry is obvious, they never make love. John and Blair have an affair shortly after she leaves Todd for the final time in \"OLTL\"'s ABC run and enter a marriage of convenience to prevent Todd from gaining custody of Jack and Sam. Todd was never involved with Natalie, who was his niece.\n\n6. Blair Cramer holds the record for repeatedly marrying Llandview's most enduring Bad Boy. How many times did Todd and Blair marry while \"OLTL\" was broadcast on ABC?\n\nAnswer: Three\n\nBlair marries Todd twice during Howath's original run on \"OLTL\". She marries him one more time after St. John joins the cast. Although St. John's Todd and Blair plan at one point to enter a love-based marriage, the wedding never takes place because Crazy Margaret kidnaps Todd. Instead, Blair goes for a Delgato special, which is a $5 million payment for a marriage of convenience.\n\n7. Which of these women is not a real, imagined, or near victim of Todd rape at some point in the series?\n\nAnswer: Tea Delgato\n\nTea, who marries Todd twice, is one of the few women in Todd's life who never accuses him of rape. Marty Saybrook is Todd's first and most troublesome rape victim, and the gang rape he leads in college continues to haunt him throughout the series. Luna Moody is a friend of Marty's who Todd almost rapes.\n\nIt is during this near-rape episode that Luna cuts Todd's face, resulting in the scar that characterizes Howath's performance of Todd. Shortly after Blair leaves St. John's Todd for pretending to be Walker Lawrence and misleading her about his death, the couple has spontaneous, passionate sex on New Year's Eve. Due to a brain tumor, Blair believes Todd has raped her. Eventually, she remembers the sex between this pro sensual couple was consensual\n\n8. Todd repeatedly marries both Blair Cramer and Tea Delgato in the course of the series. Which woman does Todd end up being with when the series's ABC run ends?\n\nAnswer: Blair Cramer\n\nThe return of Howath as the series closed its run on ABC allowed both women to win a \"Todd.\" At the end of the series, the true Todd Manning portrayed by Howath is with Blair. His brother Victor, who St. John is revealed to have unknowingly been throughout his eight years on \"OLTL,\" is with Tea.\n\nAs a personal note, I have no problems with Howath being the \"real\" Todd, but I hate the name Victor. St. John at least earned a better name. Trevor actually would have been a good name for Todd's twin. :-D\n\n9. How many children do the combined Todds father?\n\nAnswer: Four\n\nBetween Howath's and St. John's Todds, the man fathers four children. Starr and Jack are children Todd and Blair share. Todd has a daughter, Danni, with Tea. All of those children were actually fathered by the \"real\" Todd, which at the end of the ABC series is revealed to be Howath's Todd. St. John's Todd fathers a fourth child, Sam, when Margaret Cochran rapes him. Sam would have been Victor's only biological child.\n\n10. Although Kevin Buchanan and Todd Manning are enemies from the time that Todd claims that his nephew is involved in Marty's gang rape, Kevin is the first to learn many of Todd's secrets. Which of the following secrets is Kevin not the first to learn?\n\nAnswer: Todd had fathered a daughter with Tea Delgato.\n\nKevin learns Walker Lawrence is actually Todd, but Todd threatens him into keeping silent. Later, Kevin and Kelly are celebrating their reunion as a couple at a motel where Todd has coincidentally gone to meet a pregnant Margaret. When Todd and Margaret get into a fight, during which Todd calls the child she is carrying the monster spawn of two rapists, Kevin leaves his room to investigate and learns of Margaret's pregnancy.\n\nSource: Author debokeystuff\n\nThis quiz was reviewed by FunTrivia editor ladymacb29 before going online.\n\nAny errors found in FunTrivia content are routinely corrected through our feedback system."
