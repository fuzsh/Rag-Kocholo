        "text": "Analyzing Todd, St. John felt that it was nice to step into the role and have instant concrete relationships: \"There was so much history with Todd. I became a core character. It was grounding. I could look at old scripts and ask people, 'What was your relationship with Todd like?' Whereas with Walker, no one knew.\" St. John cited that this is what acting is all about &mdash; \"your relationship to people when you figure out how to play a scene\".cite news |title=Far from the Manning crowd |publisher=\"Soap Opera Weekly\"|date=2004-01-17|accessdate=2007-08-26\n\nurl=http://soapoperadigest.com/soapstarstats/trevorstjohnbio/index1.html] Regarding Todd's style, St. John seemed to focus more on the hair of the character, telling magazine \"Soap Opera Weekly\" that he wanted to get a haircut. He hoped that the show's writers and producers would let him trim off a little of it, commenting, \"It's just not me to be this shaggy. Right now it's OK, because I've made the creative choice that I'm letting myself go because [Todd's] not really right in the old noggin. They asked me to leave it alone until further notice. I even gained a little weight so it looks like I'm not thinking about appearance. But personally, I'd like to be a little cleaner.\"cite news|title=What is your beauty/fashion/health resolution?|publisher=\"Soap Opera Weekly\"|date=2003-12-30|accessdate=2007-08-26] Due to Howarth's praise for his portrayal of the character, as well as the length of his portrayal, it became inevitable that viewers and the soap opera media would start to compare St. John's performance as the villain to that of Howarth's, wondering how Howarth might have acted out certain scenes, recited certain lines. To this, St. John made his feelings known: quotation|It's like saying that if you play Hamlet, every actor who plays it has to play each line with the same inflection, the same intention. I don't care what the other guy did. That's his time. Those are the characteristics that Todd had simply because he was the only one who played it. As far as I'm concerned, it's just a name and words on a page. What I do after that is up to me. I'm playing it now. I know that sounds very arrogant and overconfident, but it would be no fun to try to mimic somebody.cite news |title= Oh my Todd!|publisher=\"Soap Opera Weekly\"| date=2004-01-27 |accessdate=2007-08-26|url=http://soapoperadigest.com/soapstarstats/trevorstjohnbio/index1.html]\n\nSt. John acknowledged the love/hate relationship that viewers have with Todd, but commented on how this factor keeps the character from becoming boring. \"It’s fun,\" he stated, \"bad guys are always the most popular, I think.\" St. John felt that likeability is unnecessary. \"I think empathy is what people respond to,\" he relayed. \"If you understand a person, the person can do whatever unlikable act, and you’ll still be rooting for him.\" He added, \"And Todd’s kind of both good and bad. He’s got his good side with his kids, and yet he is conniving and vicious and all those negative things. That’s the kind of character that people like to watch. No one likes to watch a monolith of niceness. The worst thing a writer could do is make a character nice, period. Or likeable.\"\n\nImpact and criticism\n\nTodd's impact on television ranges from his rape of Marty Saybrooke, to viewers demanding his stay on the show, to being analyzed in books.\n\nHowarth's portrayal of Todd made the character a legend, and earned Howarth a Daytime Emmy Award for the role in 1994.cite web|title=Roger Howarth (Paul, ATWT)|publisher=\"Soap Opera Digest\"|accessdate=2008-07-24|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/soapstarstats/rogerhowarthbio/] At the height of Todd's popularity, there were female viewers expressing ardent desire for the fictional rapist in such a way that it unnerved the actor.\n\nIn his first few years as Todd, Howarth's popularity extended to talk shows, where hosts would address the \"rabid\" attention he and his character received. On May 17, 1994, Howarth appeared with seven other male soap opera stars on the \"Phil Donahue Show\". Howarth discussed Todd's scar, his love for soccer aside from acting, and working with child co-stars. That same month, he appeared on \"Live with Regis and Kathie Lee\" (now called \"Live with Regis and Kelly\").cite news|title=Roger Howarth Appearance|publisher=\"Live with Regis and Kathie Lee\"|date=1994|accessdate=2008-07-21] The appearance came after winning the Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Younger Actor. praised Howarth's performance. Philbin said that Howarth was \"very, very convincing\". Howarth explained that it took hundreds of people behind the scenes to get an episode of a soap opera together.\n\nHowarth leaving the show only served to preoccupy fans more with their love for the villain, and his returns were met with anticipation and hype; the character coming back in 2000 for his love at the time, Téa Delgado, received significant fanfare.\n\n\"Soap Opera Magazine\" felt that Howarth's face \"greatly\" attributed to the character's success, as they listed him in their February 24, 1998 article \"Daytime's Most Fascinating Faces\": cquote|Although the scar that traverses his face while he plays Llanview’s dark prince isn’t real, the menacing intensity that Roger Howarth can so effortlessly convey with his eyes and furrowed brow are frighteningly authentic.\n\nHowarth's acclaim as Todd continued throughout his entire tenure on the show.cite news |title=Performer of the week, July 1998 |publisher=\"Soap Opera Digest\"|accessdate=2007-08-27\n\nurl=http://i172.photobucket.com/albums/w36/Syler_album/RogerHowarthPerformeroftheweekJuly1.jpg] cite news |title=Performer of the week, December 1998 |publisher=\"Soap Opera Digest\"|accessdate=2007-08-27\n\nurl=http://i172.photobucket.com/albums/w36/Syler_album/RogerHowarthPerformeroftheweekDecem.jpg] cite news |title=Performer of the week, March 2000 |publisher=\"Soap Opera Digest\"|accessdate=2007-08-27\n\nurl=http://i172.photobucket.com/albums/w36/Syler_album/RogerHowarthPerformeroftheweekMarch.jpg] cite news |title=Performer of the week, October 2000 |publisher=\"Soap Opera Digest\"|accessdate=2007-08-27\n\nurl=http://i172.photobucket.com/albums/w36/Syler_album/RogerHowarthPerformeroftheweekOctob.jpg] cite news |title=Performer of the week, March 2001 |publisher=\"Soap Opera Digest\"|accessdate=2007-08-27\n\nurl=http://i172.photobucket.com/albums/w36/Syler_album/RogerHowarthPerformeroftheweekMa-1.jpg]\n\nOn May 29, 2006, ) was at his side, clearly still alive. Spencer, a doctor, was forced to bring Todd back to life on the spot.\n\nWhat made the execution scenes particularly gloomy were Todd's flashbacks of his life, from his romance with Blair to the birth of his children, a song entitled \"Forsaken\" (or \"Todd's Song\") by Michal Towber which overlapped the five-minute and twenty-four second montage,cite news|title=One Life to Live (OLTL) - Todd's Execution Montage|publisher=sunsground.com|date=2007|accessdate=2008-07-22 |url=http://www.sunsground.com/videos/display-D2pb5JaL36Q.php] and Blair's disbelief in Todd's innocence while his daughter stood outside of the prison crying in the presence of a lynch mob.cite news|title=Todd's Execution|publisher=\"Soap Opera Digest\"|date=2006|accessdate=2008-07-22] The scenes were cited as \"unbearable\", and Blair's unwillingness to believe in Todd infuriated the audience. At the time, the majority of the audience (due to lack of access to the Internet or interest in its spoilers) believed Todd's death was permanent. Viewers expressed desire for St. John to receive an Emmy nomination; Frank Valentini, \"One Life to Live\"'s executive producer, when asked by \"TV Guide\" which episode the show submitted for Emmy consideration, stated, \"We submitted the 'Todd's execution' episode for best show.\"cite news| first=Daniel | last=R. Coleridge|title=Soap Dish with One Life to Live Honcho Frank Valentini|publisher=\"TV Guide\"|date=2006-11-08 |accessdate=2008-07-21 |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News-Views/Soaps/QA/default.aspx?posting=%7B4CB5B552-1362-4CA9-ADDE-D492083FED29%7D] While St. John was not nominated for an Emmy, the storyline surrounding \"Todd's Execution\" landed the show an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Drama Series, and Towber was among one of the show's composers nominated in the Outstanding Achievement in Music Direction And Composition For A Drama Series category.cite news|title=NOMINEES ANNOUNCED FOR THE 34TH ANNUAL DAYTIME ENTERTAINMENT EMMY AWARDS TODAY ON CBS NEWS' \"THE EARLY SHOW\" Released by CBS|publisher=thefutoncritic.com|date=2007|accessdate=2008-07-22 |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20070314cbs01] cite news|title=Daytime Emmys nominations (part II)|publisher=Variety Magazine\"|date=2007|accessdate=2008-07-22|url=http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_article/VR1117961139.html]\n\nControversy\n\nThough the rape storyline of Marty Saybrooke received praise, it was also met with criticism. Points were made that it polarized the gap between rapists and the raped. There was concern that the show departed from the rape paradigm by not only insisting the essential \"goodness\" of Powell Lord, who had also raped Marty, but that it implied that peer pressure could be an adequate (or even physiologically possible) excuse for rape. The redemption of Todd was viewed as controversial as well.\n\nIn a June 1994 interview with \"TV Guide\", Michael Malone described the pattern of rapists redeemed as \"the bond between the woman and violator\". He stated that it is a great historical tradition in fiction and films, and cited actors such as Rudolph Valentino, Humphrey Bogart, Kirk Douglas, and Clark Gable, saying that they all began as totally irredeemable villains. \"You certainly don't want to say that these women want to be raped or that they are drawn to violence, because that's not true,\" he cited. \"But they are responding to the intensity of passion and an actor who lets you inside the torment. Some [women] believe they can be swept up in that passion and still turn it good. They think, 'With me, he'd be different.'\" To this, the publisher of the article, Michael Logan, created controversy when he commented on Malone's analysis by stating that \"there is a large contingent of American female soap viewers who find something very attractive about rapists\".\n\nThe actual female viewers who were aware of Logan's rape comment were infuriated by it. A woman from her r.a.t.s group criticized this argument, elaborating that she did not like Todd because he is a rapist; but that she liked Todd because of Howarth's performance as the character.\n\nMerchandising\n\nABC executives viewed Todd as their main bad guy, and felt that the idea of marketing him in the form of a toy would be promising. In 2002, they finally acted on this notion, and released a rag doll into their store based on the character, but were thwarted by a backlash.cite news |title=Todd Doll Gets Ragged On!|publisher=\"Soaps In Depth\"|date=2002-06-11|accessdate=2008-07-20] As did other news outlets, on May 6, 2002, \"The Stranger\", self-titled as Seattle's only newspaper, gave insight into the matter of what went wrong:\n\n\"Today the \"Associated Press\" reported on the messy merchandising mishap currently making waves at ABC. At the center of the mini-snafu is Todd Manning, a fictional character on ABC's never-say-die soap opera \"One Life To Live\", portrayed by actor Roger Howarth. So popular was the recurring character that ABC execs licensed and produced a collectible Todd Manning doll, selling the daytime-TV action figure through the network's online store for $19.95. But after only a few days, the Manning doll was unceremoniously yanked from the ABC site, with marketing execs citing Todd Manning's 'unsavory past' as the reason for the about-face. For those out of the soap opera loop, Manning's unsavory past includes one attempted murder and two attempted rapes, the latter of which left him with a menacing scar down his right cheek &mdash; a flaw lovingly reproduced on the Manning doll. 'We didn't exercise proper sensitivity to the history of the character of Todd,' said Sally Schoneboom, vice president of media and talent relations. 'We have reevaluated and decided not to sell the doll.'\"cite web| first= David | last= Schmader|title=Last Days: The Week in Review|publisher=\"The Stranger\"|date=2002-05-06|accessdate=2007-08-28|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=10762]\n\nThe uproar started when \"The Jack Myers Report\" harshly criticized the network's judgment on creating and releasing the doll.cite news| first=Bob | last=Tedeschi|title=E-Commerce Report; Recent snafus at the online shops of TV networks have barely dimmed the glow of merchandising on the Web|publisher=\"The New York Times\"|date=2002-05-13|accessdate=2007-08-31|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E0DD1739F930A25756C0A9649C8B63]\n\nBob Tedeschi of \"The New York Times\" stated, \"In the charge toward e-commerce revenues, ABC learned a useful lesson last week: Don't try to sell cuddly rag dolls depicting homicidal rapists.\"\n\nRecast\n\nFollowing Howarth's departure from the series in 2003, and Todd being recast, controversy ensued again; there was significant outcry from fans who felt that Todd Manning is a character that should never be recast, voicing that Howarth would always be the only Todd to them.cite web| title=The Replacements|publisher=\"Soap Opera Digest\"|accessdate=2007-08-28|url=http://soapoperadigest.com/features/oltl/features/recasts/] However, St. John managed to win over his share of fans by integrating his own \"spin\" on the character, a \"spin\" which resulted in positive response from viewers who had come to accept St. John's portrayal. Eventually, the soap opera media took notice as well. Soap opera columnist Jill Berry professed her love for the new spin in her weekly commentary: cquote|Trevor's Todd continues to impress me. He has given some sweetness to Todd that I find totally appealing.cite news |title=\"Reflections by Jill\" - A Weekly Commentary on \"One Life to Live\" |publisher=About.com|date=2003-09-15|accessdate=2007-08-28|url=http://onelifetolive.about.com/library/reflections/2003/bl091503.htm]\n\nIn late 2006, with speculation that St. John would be departing from the series, rumors began to circulate that Howarth would be returning to the role. \"TV Guide\" looked to clear up the matter and questioned executive producer Valentini. \"I can't really comment on contracts,\" Valentini stated. \"I'll get in trouble. [Pause] I will say that we're doing our best to make sure that we do right by the audience. In 2007, \"TV Guide\" received official word that Howarth would not be returning to the series. \"The answer to the question,\" they stated, \"is a resounding 'Nope!'\"cite news| first=Daniel | last=R. Coleridge|title=Will Roger Howarth Return to One Life to Live as Todd Manning?|publisher=\"TV Guide\"|date=2007-04-12 |accessdate=2008-07-22|url=http://community.tvguide.com/thread/Soaps-News/Roger-Howarth-Return/800012724&start=0] What initially started the rumor of Howarth's return was the fact that both actors were in the midst of contract negotiations at their individual shows. \"It was widely speculated that Howarth could return as \"OLTL's\" Todd.\" To gauge the reactions of Howarth's possible return, TVGuide.com conducted a poll; an overwhelming 82 percent of voters wanted to see Howarth come back to portray Todd. Daniel R. Coleridge of the website, however, disagreed with the results, stating, \"Perhaps I'm in the minority, but I absolutely adore Trevor St. John. His Todd is very cocky, arrogant and humorous in a sexy way that makes this Llanviewer wanna slap him — and then totally make out with him!\"\n\nTeenagers manhandled\n\nIn March 2008, the audience witnessed \"some of the most explosive and ugliest scenes ever broadcast on daytime\" television when Todd beat up teenager Cole Thornhart (his daughter's boyfriend and Marty's son), and manhandled fellow teenagers Markko Rivera and Langston Wilde.cite web| first= Nelson | last=Branco |title=REWIND: MASTER CLASS ACHIEVEMENTS. OLTL unleashes Todd the Monster |publisher=\"TV Guide\"|date=2008-03-10|accessdate=2008-07-24|url=http://tvguide.sympatico.msn.ca/The+Nelson+Ratings+March+10+2008/Soaps/Nelson_Ratings/Articles/080310_ratings_nelson.htm?isfa=1] Viewers were outraged, and wanted Todd punished for his physical abuse of the minors.cite web| first= Jill | last=Berry |title=Reflections by Jill - A Weekly Commentary for OLTL|publisher=About.com|date=|accessdate=2008-07-24|url=http://onelifetolive.about.com/od/pollscommentaries/a/reflecs060208.htm?once=true&] According to Nelson Branco of \"TV Guide\", head writer Ron Carlivati wanted to return Todd to his dark roots; part of that was showing Todd as a monster yet again. \"Carlivati chose to do something rather unique, bold and risky with one of his marquee characters. Instead of trying to sell [the audience] that Todd is a changed man, Carlivati essentially initiated a dialogue with the audience: 'You want to know how damaged this man is? I’ll show you — and it ain’t pretty.'\" It was Starr Manning and Cole's first time having sex. Todd barged in \"and beat the son of his rape victim relentlessly\". The attack turned Starr's \"magical\" night into one of the worst days of her life. What inflamed the situation upon Todd's arrival in witnessing the two in Starr's bed is the character's inability to sometimes separate sex from violence. Branco related that, due to this fault, Carlivati conveyed Todd as convinced that Cole had raped his daughter as karmic payback. \"Todd, in that instance, became unhinged, paranoid, and out-of-control. Ripping into Langston for setting the rape in motion because 'she’s jealous Starr has parents, and wants Cole for herself.'\" Starr insisted that Cole did not rape her, but Todd was in denial. \"As Starr wrote her father off, Todd reactively almost hit Starr — twice.\" The scenes, though controversial, were praised as \"riveting\".\n\nRomancing rape victim and rape revisited\n\nIn December 2007, Marty was thrown from a van during a crash. The van exploded, and Marty was presumed dead.cite news|title=Comings and Goings: Susan Haskell (Marty Saybrooke)|publisher=\"Soap Opera Digest\", Vol. 33, No. 24|date=2008-06-10|accessdate=2008-06-11] cite web|title=One Life to Live recap|publisher=abc.com|date=2008-06-11|accessdate=2008-06-11|url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/2008/20080611.html ] In June 2008, the writers had Todd discover Marty alive, Marty now afflicted with amnesia and crippled since the crash; Todd subsequently started to nurse her back to health, which has unnerved the audience.cite news|title=OLTL Scribe On A Todd And Marty Pairing. Todd and Marty are growing closer, despite their \"dark\" history|publisher=\"Soap Opera Digest\"|date=August 2008|accessdate=2008-08-19] Viewers witnessed Todd lying to Marty about who she is and what she means to the people she loves, Todd and Marty bonding, and Marty having a flashback as she thinks positively of Todd. This created speculation that the writers would romantically pair the two. Howarth was against the writers romantically pairing Todd and Marty when he was in the role and sensed attempts to go through with the idea.cite news|first=Nelson|last=Branco|title=FF: SOAP MALFUNCTION CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS OLTL: Raping Marty softly with his kiss |publisher=\"TV Guide\"|date=2008-09-29|accessdate=2008-10-03|url=http://tvguide.sympatico.msn.ca/Soaps/Nelson_Ratings/Articles/080929_ratings_nelson_NB] Viewers thus became conflicted about whether or not they believed the writers would now follow through with the storyline.\n\nSt. John felt the need to apologize following comments he made at an August Fan Club Luncheon. When asked about the controversial storyline involving Todd and Marty, St. John replied, \"I'm all for gang rape.\" He issued the following apology to SOAPnet.com:\n\n\"I regret the way I responded to the question about the upcoming Todd and Marty storyline. It was meant in jest and I should know better than to ever try and make a joke about such a serious subject. I intended no disrepect and apologize to anyone I offended.\"cite news|first=Jamey|last=Giddens|title=One Life to Live's St. John Apologizes for \"Gang Rape\" comments|publisher=\"Daytime Confidential\"|date=2008-08-18|accessdate=2008-08-18|url=http://daytimeconfidential.com/2008/08/one-life-to-lives-st-john-apologizes-for-gang-rape-comments]\n\nIn response to viewer concern about the direction the writers seemed to be taking the Todd and Marty bond, head writer Carlivati assured \"Soap Opera Digest\" that he would have never written this under different circumstances. He explained, \"We're not talking about Marty with all her memories. She would never get close to Todd in any way. This is about a Marty who doesn't remember anything about him, and he starts to feel close to this new person and starts to feel this gratitude for the fact that she doesn't remember this horrible thing he did.\" Carlivati added, \"It is like this new chapter and this new arc. I don't think I would ever attempt to tell this relationship the way we're telling it if she knew who she was. I think that's a much different scenario. If we had Marty just come back to town and we started to build a relationship between the two of them...I can't imagine.\"\n\nTodd and Marty's relationship became based on a psychiatrist/patient dynamic and not something physical. When asked if romance is a possibility, Carlivati stated, \"I'd like to watch it unfold a beat at a time, a day at a time, a week at a time and not have the audience jump to, 'Are they going to kiss? Are they going to fall in love? Are they going to sleep together?' The goal is more to take these two characters who have an unbelievable, dark history with each other and explore where it would or could go if they didn't have that obstacle &mdash; the rape &mdash; between them.\" However, Carlivati further relayed that this obstacle still exists between them and that the audience is going to see close moments. Todd helping her walk, physical contact between the two as he continues to nurse her back to health are a few of these close moments in which will take place. \"I think the thing about the two of them, the characters and the actors, is you feel a chemistry when they're just talking, so I don't necessarily categorize it as romantic,\" stated Carlivati. \"They're definitely forming a relationship and it continues to grow and build through the fall.\"\n\nRegarding viewer resistance to a romantic pairing between the two, Carlivati acknowledged, \"I understand the initial impulse, but then again, I feel that action is more appropriate if we were telling a story where she had all of her memories. It's not that I don't get or understand the seriousness of putting these two characters together, but I don't think we're in any way damaging Marty's character.\" Carlivati stated that \"this is not the same Marty and, to [him] , it's fascinating to watch because you're wondering if and when it is all going to come tumbling down\".\n\nOn September 5, 2008, Todd and Marty shared a passionate kiss as Todd helped Marty walk. [Todd and Marty kiss:, \"One Life to Live\" (2008-09-05). Retrieved on 2008-09-05.] Todd initiated the intimate contact, and viewers, as well as critics, argued that, given Todd's sexual intimacy issues, it was out of character for him to be as sexually bold towards Marty, especially given the fact that Marty is his rape victim and a source of his sexual hangups. On September 23, 2008, the show went further with the intimacy between the two characters and almost had them engage in sex. Todd eventually backed away from the contact, presumably due to his conscienc.\n\nIn his September 29, 2008 article, \"TV Guide's\" Nelson Branco declared the soap opera in a \"state of emergency\" due to its insistance on going through with a Todd and Marty romance. Critics and fans questioned whether the current head writer of the show was the same head writer who had given the series a string of good storylines just a year before. Branco stated, \"Three weeks ago, Carlivati's risky and oh-so-reckless decision to turn the gold standard of rape stories — Michael Malone’s 1992 Emmy-winning gang-rape storyline — into a soap cliché culminated in a shocking, controversial and highly publicized kiss.\"\n\nRomantically pairing Todd and Marty had been contemplated and proposed by almost every \"One Life to Live\" writer at one point, even though the notion was considered career suicide. Howarth and Susan Haskell's refusal to act out the storyline is what largely kept writers from going with the story. However, Haskell decided to return to the series as Marty in 2008, and has seemingly reconsidered doing a Todd and Marty romance, likely due to Carlivati's insight that this is not Real Marty and is rather a Marty with amnesia, a Marty with her past wiped clean.\n\nBranco argued that the Todd and Marty story should have focused \"on the inspired karmic thread of Todd and Marty’s children, Starr and Cole, falling in love Romeo and Juliet-style\". With Starr pregnant and Starr and Cole expecting a Manning-Thornhart baby, the teen pregnancy storyline would have provided \"the perfect catalyst to keep conflict brewing between Marty and Todd without having to resort to the characters falling in love,\" cited Branco. He called Carlivati's decision to instead opt to \"parasitically rape Malone’s storyline\" another disappointing story in Carlivati's writing for 2008."
