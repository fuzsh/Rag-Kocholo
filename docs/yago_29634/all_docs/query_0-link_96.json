Alderson announced the passing of her dog, while revealing a prior loss.\n\nGeneral Hospital spoilers reveal Kristen Alderson not only shared news of her dog Pooka’s death, but that she had also lost her Granny a short time prior. Alderson disclosed that she lost her Granny on Saturday, just days before having to say goodbye to Pooka.\n\nWe extend our sincere condolences to Kristen and her family during this difficult time.\n\nDaytime TV alum, Kristen Alderson has been an iconic part of the soap opera world since age six. In 1998, Alderson auditioned and took on the role of, Start Manning. That name become a household familiarity after she stole the hearts of her One Life To Live, audience.\n\nAfter the cancellation of ABC’s OLTL, Kristen joined the cast of General Hospital, as her all familiar role, playing Starr Manning. Shortly after her character, along with Roger Howarth’s portrayal of Todd Manning, arrived in Port Charles de Llanview, the characters then has to be renamed due to lawsuits regarding the usage of character names. Alderson remained on General Hospital with a new identity, Kiki Jerome. She then left the soap opera in 2015.\n\nGeneral Hospital rumors have developed surrounding Roger Howarth’s character Franco Baldwin and his untimely death. Since General Hospital news confirmed that Howarth will in fact be returning to GH, fans have been coming up with theories for Howarth’s return and just “who” he will be when he returns. There has been talks surrounding Roger’s OG character from One Life To Live, and a possible revival of Todd Manning.\n\nA major fan theory involving the return of Todd Manning could involve the return of Starr Manning as well. When asked about the possibility of returning to General Hospital, Anderson was quick to reply with a positive response. She said, “It would be a dream come true.” When reflecting on leaving GH back in 2015, she believes it was the best situation for her personal life at the time. She continued Bobby explaining, “I just learned a lot about who I am. But I would be really sad if someone said you could never play Starr Manning again because she is a part of me. So, if I had the chance to play her again it would just be the happiest thing.”\n\nGeneral Hospital news and spoilers have confirmed Roger will return to GH. However, his character, Franco Baldwin, seems to be undeniably dead. Franco’s death, along with GH news confirmation of Roger’s return has left GH fans open to theories for his comeback. It’s been rumored that Howarth will reprise his role on GH as Todd Manning, possibly leaving an open opportunity to reunite the Manning family.\n\nWhat are fan thoughts on the return of Todd and Starr Manning? Feel free to share and discuss!\n\nThe story of Nina Reeves (Cynthia Watros) and the search for her biological daughter has come back and forth to the front burner of story lines. It first looked as though Kiki Jerome (Kristen Alderson, Hayley Erin) would be written as not the daughter of Ava Jerome (Maura West), but that of Nina Reeves. Then the story went on the back burner for a while, only being mentioned here and there.\n\nNina has most recently been hurt when she thought she had finally found her daughter, just to have it ripped away like a cruel joke. Sasha Gilmore (Sofia Mattsson) led Nina to believe she was her child as instructed by Nina’s own fiancé, Valentin Cassadine (James Patrick Stuart). When that mess hit the fan, Nina was devastated. It’s been a little bit of time since this let down and Nina is revisiting her situation.\n\nGeneral Hospital previews show Nina confiding in Jasper ‘Jax’ Jacks, tell him she still feels her daughter is out there.\n\nIn a new promo video for General Hospital, General Hospital spoilers reveal Willow Tait (Katelyn MacMullen) spots Nina with one half of a pendant which seems to strike a cord in Willow, promoting her to mention the necklace.\n\nIn recent General Hospital rumors, it has been claimed that two woman may be candidates for being revealed as Nina’s daughter, some claiming both women will be her daughters, claiming Nina had twins. General Hospital rumors suggest Nelle Benson (Chloe Lanier) and Willow Tait could be long lost twin sisters. However, other GH news and spoilers have indicated just one woman will end up with that title.\n\nDid Willow recognize the pendant because she has the other half, it or did she see it in Nelle’s possession at a given point in time?\n\nThis cannot be expressed enough, “don’t believe everything you read.” Especially when it comes to the internet. Today, many internet sources post false information and completely misleading headlines just to get an audience to view their posts. In this particular case, that is exactly what has happened.\n\nDespite the rampant rumors regarding the return of Kristen Alderson as Kiki Jerome, that line of you know what, is absolutely false.
