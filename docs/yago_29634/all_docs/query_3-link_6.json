        "text": "So today we finally got to see who Tracy is working with Blair Kramer, from One Life, to live the ex-wife of Martin. It seems that somehow Blair created did the desepter design and Martin blab that secret to Lucy’s, without telling her the truth. Now Blair wants revenge on Martin and the despeter design. How Blair met Tracy is a different story, it seems Tracy has her own motives for doing this. And Blair really didn’t mention much about what she’s been doing since 2013 when she was last in Port Charles or how she met Martin.\n\nMartin & Lucy are quite the comedic pair. Those scenes made me chuckle several times.\n\nI love Blair Cramer but as the long awaited reveal of Martin’s ex #3 was underwhelming for me. I did like hearing an update on Jack & Sam, though.\n\nAs for Kassie, that woman looks amazing. Her hair was so silky & shiny & that suit was extremely flattering.\n\nI would love for Todd Manning to come back because I like him better than Austin. Unfortunately, I don’t think ABC will go in that direction because they didn’t want any characters that had to do with rape and they kind of got rid of most of that stuff. I think it would be great to have Todd Manning back because he did spend time in Port Charles.\n\nThey would take Tony Garry back in a second. They have characters who murder each other and are my bosses. I I think it’s just an excuse for not bringing Todd back immediately after there was a deal between ABC and that short-lived Internet company that produced the One Life to Live sequel online. I think Austin as a character may be wrapped up soon, and if they already have Blair on campus, they can certainly bring Todd back. And, of course, Blair already mentioned her two sons. It would add some excitement to General Hospital have a power of broken family.\n\nProspect Park lost the lawsuit. ABC can do whatever they want with the OLTL & AMC characters since they are part of ABC. Blair, Nora, Star, Todd, John McBain from OLTL & Jackson Montgomery from AMC have all been on (some before) & some even after the lawsuit. I think Disney didn’t like the image of Todd Manning raping Marty Saybrook years before on OLTL. I’m not sure that Disney/ABC would let Tony Geary return, even for the Bobbi Spencer memorial, because his character raped Laura. Besides Tony Geary left because he likes his life in Amsterdam. I believe he also has some chronic health issues. I agree that it’s hypocritical because of Sonny being a mob boss, but that’s the way it is.\n\nI want to know one thing did Blair patent her idea on the Deceptor if not too bad too sad, the product belongs to Lucy. Oh she can stand around saying she had drawings she had the ideas, but unless she patented the idea she can’t stake claim to it because under law Lucy was the first to patent the idea. Now right now the lawsuit has validity thanks to the stuff that Tracy stole from Deception claiming she had in her possession all along. I’m hoping Brooklyn goes to the judge and admits to taking the stuff from Deception at Tracy’s request which will make the entire lawsuit blow up in her face. Sorry not on Tracy’s side here she’s out of line, and not even thinking about the others being her because of her actions but then she never does. As or Blair and her stupid logic that if Lucy lost Deception she’d push Marty to marry her is stupid, first Lucy has a real estate license to fall back on she could sell her share in ELQ to say Michael now that would burn Tracy to get money and wouldn’t she and Marty be better off just living together while he still get’s his alimony would make more sense.\n\nI wasn’t watching way back when, but by what I heard on Friday’s episode, it doesn’t sound like she did. If she had Lucy would not have been able to patent it.\n\nI believe this is why Tracy blackmailed Brooklyn to getting her the schematics and everything from Deception. Now Tracy can produce proof even though it’s stolen proof, that she came up with the idea.\n\nStill wondering when just after some digging:\n\nBlair born in 1969 came to Lanview in 1991 at 22\n\nMarried Asa Buchannan later divorced that year\n\nBlair met Todd shortly after in 1994, married then divorced 1995-1997\n\nBlair then began romance with Max Holden, married then divorced 1999-2001\n\nBlair remaried then divorced Todd 2001-2002\n\nBlair then married Walker Laurence who was revealed to be Todd Manning (who was actually Victor Lord Jr.) from 2003-2004\n\nThey remaried again 2007-2008\n\nBlair married and divorced John McBain in 2009\n\nBlair married and was widowed by Eli Clarke in 2010\n\nBlair remarried Todd Manning as of 2013 on OLTL ending unknown status afterwards\n\nSo really that leaves 2013-2023 as the only time her and Martin could’ve plausibly married? Unless it was way earlier in 1989-1991ish? So if its 2013-2023 time frame, we need some background on how they met, how long they were together and what happened to Todd/Star over that period of time as well!"
