        "text": "By\n\nKassie DePaiva went back to work this week in the role of Blair Cramer in the One Life to Live reboot! While everyone is getting their footing being back in the soap saddle again, DePaiva was extremely enthusiastic of Prospect Park’s hands-on efforts with production and bringing the soaps back to life online.\n\nIn a new interview with Tainted Dreams blogger and noted soap opera columnist Carolyn Hinsey, DePaiva spoke of what to possibly look for when Todd (Roger Howarth) and Blair share scenes again in Llanview, and where the story picks up! And of course, the million dollar question is addressed … what about a possible return by Trevor St. John as Victor Jr? Here are a few interesting excerpts from the chat below!\n\nKassie on where we find Blair when One Life to Live picks up the story again: “Blair is pretty much where she was. They’re addressing what happened at the end of OLTL, not what went on in Port Charles [on GH]. There’s a Tomas reference, then we pick up with her relationship with Todd. Roger Howarth is there. Todd comes back to town because of a family issue, and Blair and Todd pick up where they left off. They have a lot of unfinished business, a lot of rich history to pull from. Fans need to know that (head writer) Susie Bedsow Horgan was producing OLTL during the ‘Golden Balloon’ wedding, and she honors that.\n\nKassie on what she can say about the possibility of a return of Trevor St. John as very much alive Victor Jr: “We’ve got to address something there – that was the last shot of the episode! That’s all I’m going to say.”\n\nSo One Lifers, how do you want to see the story pick-up between Blair and Todd? Do you think the show will address where Victor Jr. is too? Let us know!\n\nUp Next\n\nEmme Rylan On Why She Chose to Leave Y&R & Become GH's New Lulu Spencer Falconeri!\n\nDon't Miss\n\nY&R Sneak Peek: Adam is Shot As Nikki & Victor's Reception Is About To Explode!\n\nYou may like\n\nJennifer Pepperman, Former ATWT and OLTL Director/EP, Now AEW VP Content Development, Talks Similarities Between Soap Operas and Pro Wrestling\n\nJudith Light Joins the Cast of AMC’s ‘The Terror’ Season 3 Anthology Series\n\nMichael Easton Looks to the Future & Finding Next Role and Great Storyline; Where Would You Like to See Him Turn Up Next?\n\nDAYS and OLTL Favorite, Farah Fath Opens About Her Life with Husband Phil Galfond in New Docuseries\n\nTrevor St. John Announces His Departure from The Young and the Restless\n\nOne Life to Live Alum Jonathan Groff Wins First Tony Award For ‘Merrily We Roll Along’\n\nGeneral Hospital\n\nGeneral Hospital Adds ‘Star Trek: Discovery’ Alum Sawandi Wilson to the Cast\n\nBy\n\nAs Lucky Spencer’s returns begins to unravel, bringing back to five-time Daytime Emmy-winner, Jonathan Jackson, there is another actor who will definitely be a part of his story.\n\nIn casting news, Sawandi Wilson is joining the cast in the role of Isaiah, who is tied to Lucky’s story and will first air next week beginning on the August 26th episode of the ABC daytime drama series.\n\nif Wilson looks familiar it’s from his role in Star Trek: Discovery as Captain Leto in its fifth and final season which ended this past May. In addition to that series, Sawandi’s credits include: a recurring role in Netflix’s The House of Flowers, Harlem, Law & Order: SVU, Quantico, The Get Down, Bull and more.\n\nJackson’s return began on today’s August 23rd episode and her previously teased to TV Insider, “He’s (Lucky) been away for almost a decade, so I would say that the reasons for him being away and what he’s been up to are revealed. He hasn’t just been sitting in an apartment writing his novel. He’s been up to stuff.”\n\nHow does Isaiah fit into the equation? Will he be working with Lucky? Against Lucky? Who might Isaiah be connected to in Port Charles?

Later, she returned to play Sam in 2021, and once again in January of 2024. Taking to her Instagram Story, Hartley wrote, “Grateful to be stepping in again.” She was pictured in a photo from the funeral of Molly (Kristen Vaganos) and TJ’s (Tajh Bellow) baby alongside her on-screen mother, Nancy Lee Grahn (Alexis) and also Kristina played by Kate Mansi.\n\nThe timing of Kelly’s temporary exit comes at a pivotal time for the character as her man, Dante (Dominic Zamprogna) awaits to see just what the prognosis is of his ex-wife, Lulu, who has been in a coma in a longterm care facility, plus all the drama between the Davis sisters.\n\nLast fall, Monaco celebrated her 20th anniversary with General Hospital and her fans have been clamoring for her to have more story as Sam has been a bit back-burnered of late. Is that all about to change? Stay tuned.\n\nSo, glad that if anyone was replacing Kelly, it was soap vet, Lindsay Hartley?

This early renewal and upgrades are a testament to our commitment to The Drew Barrymore Show and its loyal audience, who tune in every day to see Drew’s warmth, inquisitiveness and spontaneity.”\n\nMcMahon added, “Over the last few seasons, stations have realized that The Drew Barrymore Show’is like no other series in daytime, bringing Drew’s brand of positivity and ad-friendly content to viewers on a consistent basis. Many of these upgrades now pair ‘Drew’ with a CBS Mornings lead-in, which has proven to be a powerful combination. This season, in markets where ‘Drew’ airs at 9:00 a.m., its ratings are +21% higher among total viewers when CBS Mornings is the lead-in.”\n\nThe announced station upgrades will be given to CBS stations in six markets, which include five of the top 10 markets, along with a station and time slot upgrade in Houston.\n\nComing up, The Drew Barrymore Show will get the 9:00 a.m. timeslot block following “CBS Mornings” in three major markets, New York (WCBS), Dallas (KTVT) and Boston (WBZ). In three other markets, the talk show will air as an hour block at 3:00 p.m., including in Philadelphia (KYW), San Francisco (KPIX) and Miami (WFOR). In Houston, ‘Drew’ is moving to NBC affiliate KPRC and will air at 10am.\n\nMeanwhile in an interview released with Entertainment Tonight on Thursday, Barrymore addressed audience criticism for her touchy-feely nature with her guests. She told ET, “I’ll try to practice physical distance, which is not my strong point.” She added, “Do you know how hard the pandemic was for me? I was alone in a studio by myself! I like to be around people. It’s not everyone’s favorite, but I’m sorry to those people.”\n\nAre you glad that The Drew Barrymore had been picked up for a 6th season?
