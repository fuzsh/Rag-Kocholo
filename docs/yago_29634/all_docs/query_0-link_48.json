Easton will play John McBain (the character had previously been given the name Mike McBain), a private investigator. \"Frank Valentini [OLTL's executive producer] really wanted him on the show, and he's very excited,\" says Easton's rep. \"He's looking forward to working with one of his best friends, Kamar de los Reyes (Antonio Vega).\" Easton makes his first One Life to Live appearance on October 1st.\n\n© Soap Central\n\nExcerpt from TV Guide 8/1/03: Michael Easton\n\nEASTON TO OLTL\n\nABC is keeping at least one of its Port Charles alums-to-be in the family. Michael Easton (Caleb) has nailed a role on One Life to Live, a show rep confirms. Easton will play Mike McBain, a private investigator.\n\n....\n\nLook for the actor's OLTL debut on Oct. 1.\n\n© TV Guide\n\nExcerpt from Chicago Tribune 8/30/03: Michael Easton\n\n1 leaves, 1 joins `One'\n\nAugust 30, 2003|By Tribune Media Services.\n\nMichael Easton debuts Oct. 1 in his new \"One Life to Live\" character, Mike McBain. The character may have a tie to Walker, who is turning out to have more than a few of his own secrets.\n\n© Chicago Tribune\n\nExcerpt from Soapdom 9/13/03: Michael Easton\n\nFive fan favorites return to daytime, big season expected for ABC\n\nAlso on Oct. 1, Michael Easton takes a bite out of Llanview when he lands on One Life to Live as mysterious pool scout John McBain. Easton sent hearts racing on Port Charles as sexy vampire Caleb Morley. On OLTL, he will butt heads with Cristian as John tries to get Natalie to take part in a major pool tournament. Soon, John will reveal a dark side as we see his determination to get what he wants.\n\n© Soapdom\n\nExcerpt from Washington Post 8/9/05: Michael Easton\n\nProteus Teams With ABC To Offer Cell Phone Content: TV Shows' Fans Can Download Ring Tones, Images\n\nBy Mike Musgrove Tuesday, August 9, 2005; Page D04\n\nThe ABC television network said yesterday that it has tapped local software developer Proteus to run a new online store where fans of ABC shows including soap operas such as \"All My Children,\" the action series \"Alias\" and late-night talk show \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" will be able to download custom ring tones and images to their cell phones.\n\n....\n\nIn addition to theme-song ring tones, ABC and Proteus said they are planning to make tracks available as answering-service messages when customers are unable to pick up their phones. One proposed \"ringback\" script, which has not yet been recorded, would feature the voice of \"One Life to Live\" actor Michael Easton in his role as police detective John McBain: \"If you're the kidnapper, the money's on the way. Everyone else, please leave a message and be sure to leave a number.\"\n\n© Washington Post\n\nSoap Central.com 6/14/06: Michael Easton</center>\n\nEaston's future with OLTL in question\n\nby Dan J Kroll Posted Wednesday, June 14, 2006 12:50:04 AM Updated Sunday, June 18, 2006 5:09:47 PM\n\nRumors continue to circulate regarding Michael Easton's (John McBain) status with One Life to Live. While the actor is officially keeping a low profile, a not-so-amicable parting of ways with the webmaster of his official web site has many fans fearing the worst. Easton and the webmaster of his now-former official web site had a falling out earlier this year - a fallout that unfortunately became far too public. In the squabble, the webmaster expressed frustration over not knowing the details of, among other things, Easton's contract status. For his part, Easton explained that his plate was full with work and other projects and that he hadn't had the time to keep up with the webmaster. The webmaster then posted on the web site a series of personal emails that Easton had written. One of the emails posted from Easton explained that the actor did \"not feel comfortable\" committing to an appearance at this year's One Life to Live Fan Club luncheon because he was not sure if he would be with the show at that time. The luncheon will be held in August. As expected, when the news of Easton's contract uncertainty surfaced, Internet rumors spread like wild fire. According to some posters, Easton would head to General Hospital to play opposite his former Port Charles love interest, Kelly Monaco (Samantha McCall). Other rumors had Easton returning to Days of our Lives. Easton and ABC remain in contract talks. As is network policy, ABC would not offer comment on the talks. Easton has also remained silent while the talks continue. According to a setside source, One Life to Live has a major storyline in place for Easton if he does, in fact, re-sign. For his part, Easton has established a new official web site and offered some comment on his contract situation. \"Unfortunately, I am unable to comment on the situation at this time and truth be told no decisions have been made,\" Easton stated. \"I will say only that ABC has been nothing less than wonderful to me from day one, as has my entire experience been on One Life To Live. Anybody saying anything to the contrary is simply misinformed.\"\n\nLastly, I just wanted to say no matter what happens come August, thank you for giving me a home for the past three years. None of this would have been possible without you -- the best fans in the world. I am truly blessed.\n\nEaston joined the cast of One Life to Live in October 2003.\n\n© Soap Central.com\n\nExcerpt from Soap Central 8/14/06: Michael Easton\n\nContract Inked, Easton Won't be \"Killed Off\"\n\nPosted Sunday, August 13, 2006 12:23:52 PM\n\nAfter months of will-he-or-won't-he rumors, soapcentral.com has learned that Michael Easton's (John McBain) has signed a new contract that will keep him in Llanview for some time to come. The uncertainty surrounding the star's future at One Live to Live has swirled for much of the summer. The news should bring about more than a sigh of relief to fans of Easton and his One Life to Live character. If negotiations had broken off, soapcentral.com has learned that the show was prepared to kill off the character of John McBain. Earlier this year, as talks between the two sides dragged on, the show's writing staff was instructed to script the death of Easton's character. Presumably that storyline would have played out later this month. \"So here we go again. Got a lot of work to do,\" Easton said in a statement on his official web site. \"Gonna work harder. Dream bigger. And here's to the second time around being even sweeter. Thank you for standing by me, thick and thin, without you this is meaningless. I won't ever forget. With love and respect, Michael.\"\n\n....\n\nOfficially, ABC policy does not allow the show to discuss actors' contracts. Easton joined the cast of One Life to Live in October 2003.\n\n© Soap Central\n\nExcerpt from Soaps.com 10/5/07: Michael Easton\n\nOne Life To Live - NEWS ROOM\n\nRecently, there has been some rumors flying around the net saying that two of One Life to Live’s top actors are leaving the show. Well, I’m here to tell you they are not!\n\n.....\n\nAlthough Michael Easton is another actor who found his contract status being questioned in recent rumor mills, he has also confirmed on his official website that he’s not leaving the show either and that his current contract with OLTL runs past 2007! Born in California, of Irish heritage, Michael Easton attended prep school in Ireland and England before taking up English and history at the University of California. He also studied film at New York University.

According to Daytime Confidential, Howarth, Easton and Alderson will leave \"General Hospital\" as per an agreement between ABC and Prospect Park. The actors are expected to help launch \"One Life to Live\" on Prospect Park's The Online Network, but could return to \"General Hospital\" after \"OLTL\" launches.\n\n\"Prospect Park realizes these three characters could initially help draw fans to the new 'One Life,'\" a source told Daytime Confidential. \"There are ongoing talks between ABC and Prospect Park about the characters returning to 'General Hospital' at some point, which could be fine with [Prospect Park] as they eventually want to go much younger with their soaps.\"\n\nA rep for ABC told TVLine that the network and Prospect Park are in ongoing collaborative conversations. \"We have various strategies in place depending on the outcome of these talks and of Prospect Park’s plans,” the ABC rep said.\n\nProspect Park originally planned to take \"One Life to Live\" and \"All My Children\" online after the two soaps ended their runs on ABC, but the plans were scrapped in late 2011. However, the company recently announced it made the appropriate deals and secured the proper funding and will revive the soap operas with production scheduling to start in February.\n\n© Huffington Post\n\nExcerpt from We Love Soaps 2/1/13: Michael Easton\n\nProspect Park Statement on ABC and ONE LIFE TO LIVE Characters On GENERAL HOSPITAL\n\nProspect Park released the following statement regarding its licensing agreement with ALL MY CHILDREN and ONE LIFE TO LIVE.\n\n....\n\n\"Prospect Park understands that GENERAL HOSPITAL has featured Llanview transplants Michael Easton (John) and Kristen Alderson (Starr) among others while we arranged production of the new version of ONE LIFE TO LIVE. These characters, who we own under our agreement, are obviously essential to our production efforts, and a large reason we licensed the program. We also understand that legions of GENERAL HOSPITAL fans have grown to love these actors and characters in a short time. So even though we are paying ABC millions of dollars to license the shows, we have been, and continue to be willing to equally share the characters with GENERAL HOSPITAL and ABC. It's a win-win for the actors, the shows and fans, who love all of the shows and storylines. We hope to work out these agreements with ABC and the actors.\"\n\n© We Love Soaps\n\nSoap Opera Digest 2/1/13: Michael Easton\n\nEaston, Howarth And Alderson Off GH\n\nBy SOD • Steven Bergman Posted: Feb 1, 2013\n\nThe legal skirmish between ABC and Prospect Park has resulted in the mandatory exits, at least for now, of Llanview transplants Michael Easton (John), Roger Howarth (Todd) and Kristen Alderson (Starr). Easton confirmed his departure in a Facebook post, saying, \"I've been informed, that due to some ongoing legal this and that, I cannot be at 'General Hospital' after February 8th.\" A GH spokesperson says, \"GENERAL HOSPITAL is excited about Michael Easton, Kristen Alderson and Roger Howarth staying on the show and we are exploring ways to allow that to happen.\" The characters are expected to air through March, and sources say that the show hopes to resume use of all three performers, who are under contract to ABC (not to Prospect Park), likely as different characters. PP, meanwhile, is said to intend to recast the roles of Starr, John and Todd for its OLTL reboot.\n\n© Soap Opera Digest"
