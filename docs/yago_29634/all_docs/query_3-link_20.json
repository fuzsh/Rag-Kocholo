        "text": "Chapter 20\n\nWhere are you going, Todd? Blair Cramer demanded to know as they drove off the main road and onto a gravel one. It was so dark here that it was hard to tell just where they were or where Todd intended to take them.\n\nDidnt anyone ever tell you that getting there is half the fun? Todd Manning countered, not taking his eyes off the path ahead of them. Blair was always so impatient but he was willing to bet that she would like what he had done. Just like he was willing to bet that she still loved him.\n\nI did not know you considered kidnapping to be fun! she declared, folding her arms in front of her, I guess we will see how much fun you have from a jail cell I still have a restraining order out against you.\n\nBo or Hank will probably tell you that a restraining order doesnt work all that well if you refused to stay away from the person youve got the restrain against, he remarked coolly, stopping the car and cutting the engine before turning to her and saying confidently, Your problem is that you cant stay away from me.\n\nIn your dreams, Todd! You are the one who cant stay away from me, Blair told him doubtfully, with the roll of her green eyes, wondering why he had driven them to the middle of nowhere.\n\nThats not what people will say tomorrow after your actions tonight, Todd disagreed, reaching over to release her safety harass and watching it retract across her waist and chest.\n\nI dont know what you are talking about! she exclaimed, opening her car door and getting out. She did not want to be stuck in a car with Todd, if he was going to be a smug jerk. She didnt want to be stuck with Todd period. She was not going to be stuck with Todd. She was going a divorce, once she got out of here!\n\nYes, you do, Blair. You just dont want to admit that you had fun tonight with me. Why else would you take my part against the Rappadorks and make Flanboy open the envelope? he scoffed, following out of the car and lifting the front trunk of his Porsche.\n\nAll I did tonight was try to keep you from making a public spectacle of yourself tonight, Blair insisted, curious to see what he was doing in what seemed to be a clearing on top of Llantano Mountain. They were not Vikis cabin like she had hoped. Vikis cabin had a working phone and she had forgotten her cell phone in her other purse. As far as she could tell they were in the middle of nowhere.\n\nThat was your only reason for making me leave the party with you? Todd asked, finding a flashlight and shining it in her face before swinging back to highlight his own and teasing, For kissing me?\n\nYou kissed me! I did not kiss you! she snapped and turned to go back into the car but he caught hold of her arm, I am not playing these junior high games with you, Todd.\n\nI am not playing games with you, Blair, he assured her with a laugh, putting the flashlight under one arm and removing a blanket and a bottle of Johnny Walker Blue Label.\n\nThen, what are we doing out here in the middle of nowhere? Its dark! Its late and I want to go home, Blair demanded but found herself holding the blanket and the scotch, while he slammed the trunk shut.\n\nFunny, you should say that, Blair, because home is just where I promised to take you. Todd said with a mischievous smile, taking her free hand in his and leading her up what seemed to be a gravel path.\n\nGlad that she had worn her flats, even if it gave Todd a six-inch height advantage, Blair followed his lead.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nWhat are you going to do, Princess Jessica? Chad Bennett jeered, holding her face to his, so he could look into her ice blue eyes, Sic one of your uncles on me?\n\nI will do whatever I have to keep you away from my sister, including sicing both my uncles on your sad ass,  Jessica Buchanan promised coldly, trying to force his larger hands off her face.\n\nWhy do you have to resort to threats? Why do you care who Natalie is with? She is an adult. She is the same age as you, he reasoned, bending to meet her eyes, If she needs a keeper, why dont you? Why do you get to make your own decisions and she doesnt?\n\nNatalie knows nothing about people like you! People who dont care about her just her money! Greedy gold-diggers like you! she accused, sinking her nails into the back of his hands.\n\nWhat would change your stubborn mind about me? Chad asked hopelessly, wondering why he bothered with this spoiled princess. She was cold as ice, except when she melted soft and warm in his arms. At that moment, he thought he could fall in love with this girl of fire and ice.\n\nThere is nothing you can say or do could change my mind. If you cared about Natalie or the baby, you would not have been with me tonight! You would have been with her! Not screwing me, Jessica answered with a thin, vicious smile that did not go to her eyes, I think you are the lowest form of the low. And if you come near me or Natalie again, Ill tell Natalie all about what we did.\n\nYou would do that to your own sister? What makes you think she would ever forgive you? he asked curiously, dropping his hands and deciding it was pointless.\n\nNatalie and I are family. Sisters. She will get over it in time. But she wont forgive your betrayal. Tell you what, Chad if you go quietly away leave town and dont contact her again, I will make worth your while, she promised, not surprised she could see the greed in his blue eyes.\n\nJessica Buchanan was perfect ice. Cold and mean. Her crazy uncle would be so proud. Chad frowned.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nI am not going another step until you tell me where we are going, Blair declared, stopping in her tracks.\n\nI already told you that I am talking you home, Todd replied cryptically, walking behind her as the flashlight flickered around on the ground.\n\nMy home is the Cramer Mansion, she informed him in growing annoyance with his games.\n\nThats Dorians home, not yours, he corrected in a whisper against her neck, Actually, it belongs to Starrs. But its Dorians home as long as she pays the rent.\n\nYoure splitting hairs. My home is the Cramer Family Mansion, Blair said with an indifferent shrug.\n\nYou never had a home of your own. Something that belonged to you and only you. Until now, this is, Todd announced with a pleased grin, flickering the flashlight upward to reveal a large white mansion with two wings that spread out off a center porch that was supported by four Grecian columns.\n\nOh my god! Blair exclaimed and ran up the rest of the way to the columns she had dreamed about.\n\nTodd grinned and followed her up, thinking this might be what would finally give him his wife back.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThen, Chad wants nothing to do with the baby, Cris Vega concluded with a nod and tightened his arms around her waist, Thats fine with me. Its perfect as long as we are together.\n\nI Cris you dont understand, Natalie sighed and smiled in spite of his miscomprehension. How could she not love him so much? Cris was wonderful. Simply wonderful but she had to set him straight.\n\nThere is nothing to understand. Just things to feel good about, he smiled at her smile, feeling just short of wonderful. Only Natalie agreeing to marry him could make him feel wonderful.\n\nI want you to feel good about us, she agreed, wondering how she should be blunter about the baby.\n\nI do. You, me and our baby. We will have our own family. I like that. Scratch that. I love it. I love you, Natalie, Cris laughed as she turned in his arms and touched his face. Her fingers felt great. She was great.\n\nI love you, too. Besides Seth, you are the only one whom I have been. So this baby is OUR baby, Cris, Natalie told him plainly, holding his face to her, so she could see that he understood this time.\n\nWait, youre saying I am the babys father? he asked, placing his hands on her shoulders.\n\nNatalie nodded in relief that he understood and in worry that he would not explain why she lied.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nYou hate the columns  Blair exclaimed, hugging one of the four columns and looking at her husband as he walked up the front steps.\n\nIts not my home, Blair. Its yours. You should have everything the way you want in your house, Todd replied with a half-smile, trying to remember the last time he had seen her this happy. It was probably the day the social worker told them that they could keep their kids.\n\nWhen did you do this? she wondered, looking out at the view of Llanview in the valley below.\n\nI started it after you threw me out last summer. That was what I had wanted to tell you before I discovered what you had been up to  he explained, trying not to think about whom she might have done while he was gone, I paid the contractor in half and they did about half until I returned. It was going to be my peace offering to let me see the kids.\n\nI would have let you see the kids I was just so angry at first, but I would have let you see them eventually,  Blair said awkwardly, but not wanting to dwell on the past, she asked, When will the house be finished?\n\nIt wont be ready for another month. The contractor promised me it would be done by December 20th. Youll need to pick out furniture and interior design but the electric and other utilities will be finished. If you want, you could move in January. Do you want to see the interior? Todd asked, his smile returning as he handed her the flashlight.\n\nYes  she grasped and struggled not to drop the flashlight, blanket or scotch as he bent and picked her up in his arms, What are you doing, Todd?\n\nCarrying the new owner over her new threshold its good luck, he said carelessly, not caring if it was true. He was just determined that she would not enter the house he built her any other way but in his arms.\n\nHe also hoped to christen the place with scotch and maybe a little more, if he was lucky\n\nI am over the threshold, Todd, Blair commented coolly as Todd kicked the door closed behind them. But her attention was diverted when she saw the grand stairs that connected the two wings of her house. White marble with black banister and two more columns on either side of the stairs. She was in heaven.\n\nYou like your house, Scarlett? Todd teased, loving her smile but he had no intention of putting her down. Not yet. Not until he took her up those damned stairs that cost him an arm and leg. As it was, he still needed to get her a long red robe maybe for Christmas it would be his gift to himself.\n\nI thought I love it where are we going? she asked with a slight jerk of her legs when she realized that he was headed up the stairs but there was a skylight above the stairs how had Todd known she wanted a skylight on her stairs?\n\nDont you want to see the view from the top? he countered, stopping midway when he realized that she noticed the skylight. When it was light out, Blair would realize that it was similar to the one in Dorians old Penthouse. He had always liked the way the light poured down on Blair when she stood under it. She turned into liquid light soft and shimmering.\n\nYou dont need to carry me, Blair stated in a half-hearted protest as they climbed higher and she could look down the foyer below. The foyer was also white marble as was the top of the stairs. East wing was dark but there seemed to be a dim light in the west wing.\n\nYou could slip in those ridiculously high shoes you insist on wearing, he complained, deciding to ignore the fact that she was in facts and that he loved in heels. Blair was only wearing flats because she did not want to tower over her vertically-challenged date. When she was with him, she could wear as high a heel as she wanted.\n\nI am not wearing heels where are we going now? she demanded, as he walked towards that light in the west wing. Todd was only carrying her, so he got to control where she went. This had to set a new benchmark in his need for control.\n\nBut if Todd thought she was going to let him carry her about the rest of the night, he was mistaken.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nNatalie! How could you? Cris cried in shock, dropping his hands and looking away from her in attempt to absorb this latest shock on an evening of shocks. His head could explode from this latest revelation.\n\nI was trying to do the right thing I didnt want to  Natalie told his stiff back, just knowing that he could not bear to look at her. She was as big a liar as Jen.\n\nTo tell me the truth? How could you keep this from me? he asked, trying to control his anger but not quite managing as he turned to face her,  Didnt you think I had the right to know about our baby?\n\nYou already had a baby with Jen. I didnt find out about our baby until after you left for Cape May with Jen. What was I supposed to do? Make my big announcement after you announced your engagement to her? she countered with a flash of her own temper, disappointed that he did not see the sacrifice she had been willing to make for his sake.\n\nYes! Engagements can be broken. Marriages annulled, Cris told her bluntly, wanting to shake some sense in her beautiful red head, But you arent going to tell me, were you? You would have let me think Chad was the father of our baby! You would have run off to Switzerland, if your crazy uncle had not stopped you! Natalie, dont you see how messed up that?\n\nI dont want interfere in your happiness  Natalie said stubbornly, thinking he should be a little more grateful, I was only thinking of you!\n\nNatalie, you are my happiness! Dont you get that I cant be happy without you? he questioned with a sigh of exasperation and twisted a lock of her fiery red hair in his fingers. Didnt she get that he loved her?\n\nYoure not happy with me anymore, she observed with a frown but took a step towards him.\n\nNot particularly, Cris agreed, frowning back and walking away from her to control his overwhelming urge to shake some sense into her beautiful but thick skull. Would their baby be as pigheaded?\n\nYoure angry, Natalie decided her lie had cost the man she loved, There was nothing more to say.\n\nYes, I am angry! Where are you going, Natalie? he asked as he watched her run back to the house.\n\nSwearing she drove him as crazy and crazy for her, Cris took a deep breath and followed her back inside.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThis is your master bedroom, Todd declared over the click of his shoes on the bare hardwood floor.\n\nIts beautiful, Blair exclaimed, looking over his shoulder at the fireplace and then in front of her at the wall of glass that looked onto a balcony. Except for the rising moon, she could not see much else of the view. She could make out three other doors on the third wall but she just assumed they were closets and a bathroom.\n\nThe room was empty except for a bed Dorians old sleighbed Sam had not wanted it at the Penthouse he was renting from her, so she had removed it and placed in storage at Llanfair, where Todd must have found it. Did she need to ask why he had placed in the master bedroom of the house he had built for her?\n\nYoure beautiful, Blair, he told her, placing her dead center on the bed that the contractor had added pillows, sheets and comforter to. It was a pretty setup and better than what he had in mind when he had taken his old blanket from his car, but the pretty setup would probably cost him another small fortune.\n\nStill if it got him what he wanted, it would be worth every penny he had poured into this money pit!\n\nTodd, what are you doing? Blair asked as he took the blanket, the scotch and the flashlight from her and put them on the floor.\n\nWhat do you think? Todd laughed, kicking his shoes off and pulling his jacket and shirt in a single pull over his head. He ran his fingers through his hair in a moment of indecision before dropping them on the ground. He might be waiting a long time if he waited for an invitation back into her bed.\n\nI am not sleeping with you, Todd Manning, she declared in alert, sitting up and attempting to scoot off the bed, Youre nuts, if you think I am going to sleep with you just because you built me a house!\n\nIts not a house! Its bigger than Asas and Llanfair. So it is a @#%$ mansion and I wasnt planning on doing much sleeping, he corrected, catching her before she had time to just more than sit up.\n\nTodd, let me go! Blair ordered uncomfortably, not liking that he was half-dressed, that they were alone in an empty house on top of a mountain or that he was stroking the end of her bare legs.\n\nI cant, Blair! I swear to God I tried all summer long on that stupid island I even tore you out of a picture I had of you and the kids  Todd told her, moving her back of the center of the bed, I tried to forget I tried to hate I tried so damn hard but I could not.\n\nTodd, dont, she cried, cupping his troubled face, uncertain if she was protesting his words and his deeds."
