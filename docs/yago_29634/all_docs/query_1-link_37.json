        "text": "Perhaps the most polarizing soap opera character ever. OLTL fans know he was originally a fratboy rapist who later became \"redeemed\" but was still the great antihero of Llanview. Shook up the Lord family and breathed new life into Viki's tired D.I.D. storyline. Epic romances with Blair Cramer and Tea Delgado. He was especially hot when played by Roger Howarth, but then the producers fucked up by replacing him with an aspie actor who had no lips. Roger's return was so epic. Where is the love on DL for Victor Lord's baby boy? Are you team Blair or team Tea Delgado? Poll included.\n\nAs is a disturbing tradition in daytime, the character he had the most chemistry with was his rape victim, Marty Saybrooke. If it was even possible to avoid backlash, they would’ve paired Todd and Marty as a super-couple and they would’ve been a smash. But we knew better in the mid-90s.\n\n[quote] But we knew better in the mid-90s.\n\nVery true R5 which is why I was so perplexed in 2008 when producers paired Marty with fake Todd(Trevor St. John) and had them living together as a couple. The real Todd Manning would have never done that. Of course all the original OLTL actors had better chemistry with Roger than his replacement.\n\nI hope Roger is having a good life. He was so young and played such a compelling antihero/byronic hero, and it was still following him wherever he went, way back when I quit daytime soaps.\n\nBut definitely Team Blair for true love.\n\nYou do realize R11 that Trevor St. John was never really Todd Manning, right? Roger was always Todd and always will be. You don't have to acknowledge it, but that doesn't make your delusion a fact.\n\nR3, no. He seemed very happily married and had two kids.\n\nOnce I saw him walk into a restaurant where I was dining with a friend. Roger bee-lined over to our table to introduce himself to my friend, who couldn’t get over how nice he was.\n\nRoger was quite good as Todd. Both on OLTL and GH.\n\nI can't say the same about his Franco. And definitely can't say it about Austin Gatlin-Holt.\n\nRoger Howarth gave one of the most riveting performances on soaps in the 90s....the writing was good too. Sad what both the former and the latter has been reduced to....Roho is a shell of who he was as an actor, in part due to horrible writing (and Roho's laziness).\n\nRoger Howarth did an appearance at the Steamtown Mall in Scranton, PA in 1993-ish. I went to see him. There was a fat woman in line also waiting to meet him. She handed him a bunch of fake silk roses that she had gotten at the dollar store. He looked at them like he been handed a bag of dog shit. It still makes me chuckle.\n\nWhen he played Todd as a dark tortured soul he was riveting. Jerry ver Dorn stole his second Emmy. His tapes in 95 were ridiculously good. It was Todd apologizing to Marty and then saving her from the car crash and she wouldn't let him touch her. Crying \"I need to know that you feel bad.\"\n\nI never cared that much about the Tea vs Blair wars...to me Todd's most compelling scenes and stories were with all the women he wasn't romantically linked to...sister Vicki, Marty, Starr...I felt his character development really shined with them. Plus I did find it a tad inapropriate to treat a gang rapist as a romantic lead (though all in all I did prefer Blair because KdP is a genius)\n\nI loved Roger as Todd. He did have chemistry with all the ladies - viki, Nora, tea, Blair, Starr, Jessica and for sure Marty!!! Hard to pick the best pairing! Wish they kept him bad. I was sold on the super couple status of tnb when he came back. The reunion was chilling! Wish he had more interactions with Andrea Evan’s Tina. His one legit sibling.\n\nI don't think any true OLTL fan would ever think that Todd belonged with anyone other than Blair but Howarth's true scene partner will always be Susan Haskell. I doubt either actor would ever disagree.\n\nR31 It drove me crazy that in his 2011 return SH and RH JUST missed each other, her last day was like the the day before Todd returned. I soo wanted a reunion.\n\nr32 That was a big slap in the face to longtime viewers that the real Marty and the real Todd never had any scenes together in 2011.\n\nAt the time, many people speculated that Susan Haskell was let go to free up money to pay for Roger Howarth's return.\n\nHilary Smith was so great with Howarth. There was a scene at the hospital I recall where Nora runs into Todd months after the Wait Until Dark sequences and Howarth says to her \"I guess I probably scared you pretty bad last summer.\" Smith was awesome in her full body response \"You did more than scare me Todd.\" As she looked at him with complete fear in her eyes.."
