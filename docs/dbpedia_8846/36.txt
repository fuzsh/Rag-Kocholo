Portugal, a country with a rich history and a profound cultural legacy, has an intriguing economic history that is reflected in its currency. From the early days of the Portuguese escudo to the adoption of the euro, understanding the evolution of Portugal’s currency provides valuable insights into its economic history and the language surrounding it. For language learners, delving into this topic not only broadens their historical perspective but also enhances their vocabulary and comprehension of economic terms in Portuguese.

The Early Days of Portuguese Currency

The origins of Portuguese currency date back to the establishment of the Kingdom of Portugal in the 12th century. Initially, the currency in circulation was the **dinheiro**, a small silver coin used during the reign of King Sancho I. It was later replaced by the **real**, introduced by King João I in 1433. The real (plural: réis) became the standard currency for over four centuries, reflecting the economic and political changes in Portugal.

The term “real” comes from the Latin word “regalis,” meaning royal, which signifies the authority of the monarchy over the currency. This historical context is essential for language learners to understand the etymology of economic terms used in Portugal.

The Birth of the Escudo

In 1911, following the establishment of the Portuguese Republic, the escudo (meaning “shield” in Portuguese) replaced the real as the official currency. The escudo was subdivided into 100 centavos, much like the dollar is divided into cents. This shift marked a significant change in the Portuguese economy and introduced a new set of vocabulary for economic transactions.

The term “escudo” itself is rooted in Portuguese culture, symbolizing protection and strength. Understanding this term provides learners with a deeper appreciation of the historical and cultural significance of the currency.

Key Vocabulary Related to the Escudo

The introduction of the euro in 1999, and its physical circulation starting in 2002, replaced the escudo, integrating Portugal’s economy more closely with the rest of Europe.

The transition to the euro brought with it a new set of vocabulary and concepts. Key terms from this period include:
