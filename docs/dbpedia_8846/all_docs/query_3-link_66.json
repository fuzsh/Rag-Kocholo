        "text": "I wasn't looking for work-from-home jobs. I was just simply cruising on Facebook one day and found an article about transcription jobs. The article had listed five transcription companies that allowed you to work from home, I applied to two. I was accepted into Rev that week. My very first week I made $70, my husband gave me the, \"I'll believe it when I see it,\" speech. So that following Monday I was paid my $70 and I couldn't have been happier.\n\nBecause of this company, because of the hard work I put in, I'm glad to say that I have helped my family so many times financially. This job has saved us so many times that I think to myself, \"If it wasn't for this, we'd be screwed.\" Sure there are days where I get discouraged and think maybe it would be easier for me to go out and get a brick and mortar job, but then I remember above all else I'm a mother. I have four crazy kids at home and I don't want other people raising my children. It's MY job.\n\nI can now proudly report that through the help of my income, my husband has now found a great paying local truck driving company where he is home every single day. My income supported our family of six through his employment transition.\n\nSo thanks Rev. I'm almost two years strong and don't plan to leave. I enjoy what I do here. I enjoy the people on the forums. I enjoy helping those who need it. Thanks for this opportunity, it has truly saved my family!\n\nI LOVE LOVE LOVE working for Rev! I work 30 hours a week as a legal secretary, and do Rev part-time. I love that I can do it from home, in the comfort of my PJs.\n\nI also love being paid once a week, and being able to keep track of how much I make with every job I turn out. I appreciate being heard. Every single time I have needed to address an issue, I have had a real person return my e-mail. No automatic replies! Which in today's world is a refreshing change. I love that every day is different.\n\nI thank you every day for allowing me to work here. There are some weeks where I wouldn't be able to make it through the week without this extra income, and I am very grateful!"
