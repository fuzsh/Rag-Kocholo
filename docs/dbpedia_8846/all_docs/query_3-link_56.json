        "text": "On November 16th, 2020, Pix, the instant payments platform developed by the Central Bank of Brazil, was launched. This payment method allows transactions to occur in under 10 seconds, 24/7, and soon become a huge hit among Brazilians. And the numbers prove this: in 2022, Pix moved BRL 10,9 trillion, according to the Central Bank, and sums over 146 million users.\n\nRead also: Pix in 2023: main developments on Brazil’s instant payment\n\nThe modality even surpassed cash, becoming the third preferred method of payment among Brazilians, ranking behind credit and debit cards, according to a McKinsey survey.\n\n10 questions and answers about Pix\n\n1 – What institutions are offering Pix?\n\nAll financial institutions and payment institutions can offer their clients and users Pix, including fintech companies. However, institutions with over 500,000 active accounts are obligated to offer Pix.\n\n2 – What are the address keys – or Pix keys?\n\nThe address key is a way to identify the user’s account. There are four types of address keys that users can use:\n\n• CPF/CNPJ\n\n• Email address\n\n• Cellphone number\n\n• Random key – a set of random number, letters, and symbols\n\nThis key binds the basic information to the user’s complete account information, allowing users to send and receive money using only an address key.\n\nRead more: The first-year anniversary of Brazil’s instant payment method, Pix\n\n3 – How do users register an address key?\n\nUsers can register an address key directly with their financial institutions and payment institutions. To complete the registration, users must confirm the key’s ownership and link it to their accounts by inserting a code provided by the institution via SMS or email.\n\nIt is essential to highlight that while users are not obligated to register an address key, they highly recommend that they benefit from more agility when sending and receiving payments.\n\n4 – How do users send payments with Pix?\n\nUsers can send money by using the receiver’s address key, scanning a QR Code or manually inserting the receiver’s account information.\n\n5 – How do users receive payments with Pix?\n\nThere are two ways to receive payments with Pix: by informing the payee of your address key, or by generating a QR Code.\n\nQR Codes can be both static and dynamic. With static QR Codes, the transaction amount doesn’t need to be included, which means payees must manually insert the payment amount; with dynamic QR Codes, however, the amount must be included.\n\n6 – How much does Pix cost?\n\nPix is free of costs to individuals. For Legal Entities. However, the cost is much lower than the amount charged today for TED transactions.\n\nRead more: Central Bank of Brazil announces Pix Cobrança and Pix API, the instant payment’s new functionalities\n\n7 – Is it possible to request a refund or cancel a transaction carried out with Pix?\n\nAs the transactions with Pix will occur in real-time, they cannot be canceled. However, it is possible to request the recipient a refund.\n\nIt is also possible to change the amount to be paid or cancel the transaction before confirming the payment. In special cases, such as fraud, the Central Bank has developed a transaction called in Portuguese, Mecanismo Especial de Devolução (MED), or Special Return Mechanism in English.\n\n8 – Is there a minimum or maximum amount to make a Pix?\n\nThere is no minimum limit for transactions with Pix, only at night time — the limit for digital payments between individuals, between 8 pm and 6 am, is BRL 1,000.\n\nIn general, there is also no maximum limit for transactions; however, participants can establish maximum limits in order to prevent risks. These limits may not be lower than those established for other payment methods, nor may they limit the use of Pix in regard to the characteristics and profile of the payer.\n\nRead more: Research shows that 55.4% of Brazilians have made an online purchase with Pix\n\n9 – After paying or receiving a Pix, does the user receive a receipt?\n\nYes. After completing a transaction, a receipt is generated for both the payer and the recipient. The receipt generated by the payer contains:\n\n• ID / Transaction number\n\n• Transaction amount\n\n• Date and time\n\n• Description of the transaction\n\n• Recipient information\n\n10 – Will Pix have more functionalities besides the typical money transfer?"
