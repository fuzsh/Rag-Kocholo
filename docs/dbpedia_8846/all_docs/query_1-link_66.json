        "text": "The Portuguese Empire started shaping around 1415 in the Atlantic Ocean. It was gradually transformed into a multi-continental empire. Around 1500, it expanded particularly in Asia, at that time known as India, and Morocco, known as Africa or Berberia. At the same time, it possessed other areas in Africa and Brazil. However, too many interests eventually began to manifest negatively. It was so despite the fact that the Crown tried to isolate from the simultaneous European events and Portugal had been engaged exclusively in activities on the world stage. The rationalization of overseas expansion began to be discussed at the domestic political level. A rivalry between Morocco and India as areas of expansion emerged and the possibility of leaving one of those areas began to be considered. This rivalry was present most intensivelly from the discovery of the sea route to India (1498) to the dismantling of most Moroccan fortresses (1542–1550) and determined the character of Portuguese expansion in general. The question of abandonment of Morocco or India was debated for the last time on the occasion of King Sebastião's campaign to Morocco in 1578.\n\nThe Ottomans, who had already expanded into the maritime space of the Mediterranean in the fifteenth century, attempted to control the traditional trade routes connecting Asia with Europe by occupying the key strategic trade centers lying on the maritime rim of Indian Ocean. The Portuguese efforts to monopolize the eastern trade by making the commodities flow to Europe through the Cape route had started at the cost of the Ottomans and reducing the flow of wealth to the treasury of the Ottomans. This process in turn invited the latter to come out from the role of being the controller of inland caravan trade to be the key factors deciding the course of commodity movements through maritime channels. Though the Ottomans did not make any substantial impact on India by being on this soil, their frequent attempts to enter into the maritime space of Indian Ocean and particularly into the diverse maritime exchange centers of India as well as their unbroken commercial linkages with the Marakkar traders of Kerala, created multifaceted challenges to the Portuguese, who, while responding to them, developed a set of politico-military arrangements including the devices of fortresses and patrolling, which eventually had greater impact on the politico-economic history of India. The central purpose of this paper is to see the processes and mechanisms by which the Ottomans expanded into the Indian Ocean for the purpose of controlling its trade and also the ways as well as the means by which the Portuguese managed to contain the Ottoman expansion and retain their predominant position in conducting the Indian trade. This is done chiefly by locating the Ottomans in the context of Portuguese commercial expansion in the Indian waters. I hope that this paper will provide a glimpse into the parallel stream-developments of the sixteenth century in this maritime space.\n\nThis thesis examines in comparative perspective the Dutch and the Portuguese Atlantic empires in the 17th century, using West Africa as a case study. The book is divided into two parts. In Part I, we study how the conditions in the home countries influenced the building of the empires. Here we examine the goals of the Dutch and the Portuguese States and of the mercantile elites and their strategies for the building of their empires. In order to do so, we analyse the transfer of institutions, the labour migration and the formation of colonial societies. Part II deals mainly with the economic strategies of the Dutch and the Portuguese in their Atlantic Empires. Here, we examine the way these two European sea powers and their private entrepreneurs organized the trade on both an international and local level, as well as the way in which they structured their commercial and business networks, our final goal being a discussion of their struggle for the control of the supply and the consum..."
