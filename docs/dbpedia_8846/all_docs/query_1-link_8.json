        "text": "For almost two hundred years, the Avis dynasty ruled Portugal and helped drive its transition from a small agricultural kingdom on the periphery of Christendom to a pioneer in global exploration, colonization, and trade. The story of the dynasty began in 1383 when the last king of the Burgundian line, Fernando I, died, prompting a succession crisis.\n\nOn December 3, 1383, Fernando’s half-brother, , rose up against the pro-Castilian regency government ruling Portugal after Fernando’s death. The coup was successful, and on April 6, 1385, João was proclaimed King João I. However, the struggle with Castile remained unfinished. The decisive moment came later that summer when João defeated a numerically superior army led by the King of Castile (Juan I). The Battle of Aljubarrota secured Portuguese independence for the next two centuries.\n\nSupport for the triumphant João became virtually universal in Portugal, and he moved quickly to secure his new kingdom. In 1386, he signed the with King Richard II of England and further strengthened Anglo-Portuguese ties by marrying Philippa, Richard’s cousin. Commerce and cultural exchange flourished between the two maritime nations, and Philippa and João had five children who lived into adulthood. The most famous was Prince Henry, known later as the “Henry the Navigator.”\n\nIn 1415, Henry and his brothers pressured João into attacking the Moroccan port of . The Portuguese captured the city, an act which has been traditionally seen as the beginning of the European “Age of Exploration.” Henry was appointed Grand Master of the Order of Christ in 1426 and used its funds to sponsor exploratory missions into the Atlantic and along the west coast of Africa in search of gold. The Portuguese were aware of the existence of extensive gold deposits in west Africa because Muslim caravans had been bringing gold across the Sahara to the ports of northwest Africa for centuries.\n\nHenry patronized navigators, sailors, mapmakers, and shipbuilders and helped sustain interest in exploration in the early years when there was more risk than reward. Only in the 1440s, when the Portuguese reached the coast of Ghana, did the expeditions begin to make money by importing gold, ivory, and, tragically, enslaved Africans. By the 1450s, the sugar plantations of , were beginning to prosper, and demand for laborers for those plantations spurred the expansion of the African slave trade.\n\nThe typical settlement in the early phase of Portuguese colonialism was the feitoria, or fortified trading post. Generally, these did not entice many settlers and colonists in the traditional sense, but rather a relatively small number of Portuguese officials, soldiers, merchants, and priests. In 1482, São Jorge da Mina, the most significant of the feitorias, was founded in Ghana to secure access to West African gold and slaves. With royal backing, Portuguese explorers continued to push further down the African coast and made history in 1488 when Bartolomeu Dias rounded the southern tip of Africa and briefly entered the Indian Ocean. As a result, the Portuguese then knew that a sea route to India and its spice wealth was possible. Christopher Columbus’ erroneous claim in 1493 that he had reached Asia by sailing west further incentivized Portuguese efforts to reach India by the eastern route they had been mapping for decades.\n\nManuel I and Portuguese Power\n\nPortuguese expansion reached its peak during the reign of Manuel I, who was known even in his own lifetime as \"The Fortunate,\" between 1495 and 1521. The crucial moment came in 1498 when Vasco da Gama’s expedition reached Calicut on the Indian coast and returned to Portugal the next year after a voyage of 24,000 miles. The surviving ships brought back modest amounts of the precious spices of the east—pepper, cinnamon, and cloves—but the merchants of Europe immediately saw the implications of a successful sea voyage to India. With direct access to India by sea, Portugal could import spices more cheaply than the traditional spice merchants of Italy, who had to obtain them after long overland routes through many Muslim intermediaries.\n\nWith royal support, Portuguese explorers and traders sponsored expedition after expedition and were quickly able to break the spice monopoly of Venice and other Italian powers, reaping vast profits for themselves and the crown in the early years of the sixteenth century. The conquest in quick succession of three key ports in the Indian Ocean trade network—Ormuz (1509), Goa (1510), and Malacca (1511)—ensured that Lisbon supplanted all of the Italian states as the hub of the spice trade in Europe. The arrival of Portuguese merchants further east in Macau (1513) and Nagasaki (1543) began the flow of Chinese and Japanese luxuries such as porcelain and silk into Lisbon and only enhanced its role as the most dynamic trading hub in Western Europe.\n\nThe accidental discovery of Brazil by an east-bound fleet in 1500 led to commercial interest and settlement there due to the abundance of brazilwood, a source of red dye used in the production of luxury textiles like velvet. Exports of brazilwood remained a staple well into the seventeenth century, though they suffered a relative decline in importance as the plantation sugar industry began to boom there from the mid-sixteenth century. Sadly, the growth of sugar there further drove the growth of the .\n\nA flood of wealth flowed into the royal coffers, which Manuel used to build monuments in a grand style. Architecture built under Manuel has proven notoriously hard to define since it was a flamboyant composite style that has been called . The most notable buildings of early modern Portugal—the new Riverside Palace (O Paço de Ribeira) in Lisbon, destroyed by the Earthquake of 1755; the Jieronymite Monastery (O Mosteiro dos Jerónimos) and the Tower in the suburb of Belém; and elements of the Royal Cloister in the Battle Monastery in Batalha—were all commissioned by Manuel and paid for mostly by import duties on the spice trade. At the time, and for long after, many Portuguese viewed the reign of Manuel as Portugal’s Golden Age."
