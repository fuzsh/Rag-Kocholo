        "text": "It took me years to understand how to align my time, energy, attention and money to create a life and business I loved. For the first several years of my business life, I prioritized money over everything else because that's what I thought I had to do. But, if I had understood earlier how these 4 resources of time, energy, attention and money interacted, as I'll lay out for you here, I would have had a far better life and business, far earlier.\n\nThat would have meant more time with my family, more time for self care, more time for mental health, and more freedom to travel, more\n\nWe've been taught to think that the answer to freedom is to save money, but what I learned is that if you want more freedom, learn to align your time, energy, attention AND money (T.E.A.M. resources) wisely.\n\nWhile many of the principles of alignment of your T.E.A.M. resources may seem counter-intuitive at first, it'll all make sense once you start to really understand the underlying dynamics, and you'll begin to see the bind traditional \"financial freedom\" has created for most of us.\n\nIt's like those chinese finger handcuffs we played with as kids, the more you try to pull your fingers apart, the more stuck they get. But, if you do the opposite of pulling, and push your fingers in, they come off.\n\nQuesting for financial freedom through saving money is like pulling to free your fingers from the finger handcuffs. Saving money will not get you freedom. In fact, the more you save (or try to save), the more trapped you will likely be.\n\nWhen you align your resources, and focus on relaxing your nervous system by using all of your resources -- your time, energy, and attention included -- you'll see exponential growth in your earning power, and your capacity to keep earning, and discover that financial liberation can be yours, even if you don't have much money saved at all.\n\nAs you'll hear me say a lot \"money is infinite, when we know how to be in right relationship with it.\" It's your time, energy and attention that you cannot make more of, and those are actually your most valuable resources of all.\n\nManagement of your time, energy and attention is everything when it comes to creating a life worth living, and a business you love.\n\nSo, with that, there are 4 essentials for you to build upon to go from J.O.B -- whether that's a job you don't love, or a practice you've already launched that's keeping you \"just over broke\" -- to a Lifestyle (or Legacy) Business You Love.\n\nWhen you have a valuable service, and align your time, energy, attention and money in the right order, at the right time, you will have everything you need.\n\nThat may sound like a \"duh\", BUT I didn't find it a duh myself. I found it to be extremely confusing and it took me YEARS to simplify into this framework of focus for all of my resources. So I'm sharing it with you so it can be a \"duh,\" for you too, and you can just do it, and focus your resources wisely starting now.\n\nTIME: USE a pricing and delivery model that provides high value to people you love to serve, and can be provided efficiently with the support of a team, and less and less of you over time.\n\nENERGY: IMPLEMENT a clear intake/enrollment structure that ensures you only meet with people ready to hire you, and can even lead to a 100% engagement rate.\n\nATTENTION: CREATE an education-based marketing system that provides value to everyone who engages with your content, and filters out the people who you canâ€™t serve, and brings the people you can serve well into your intake/enrollment process.\n\nMONEY: ADOPT a calendaring and cash flow forecasting system that takes all of the above into consideration and allows you to use money to buy back your time, energy and attention whenever possible.\n\nIf you have a service to offer the world, structure that service as I've laid out here, and you'll never have to worry about money again. Instead, you can focus on serving, giving, and reaping the rewards of being a business owner."
