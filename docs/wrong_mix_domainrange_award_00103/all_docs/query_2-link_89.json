        "text": "Last year‚Äôs (2022) Nobel Prize in Physics went to Alain Aspect, John Clauser, and Anton Zeilinger for ‚Äúfor experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science.‚Äù\n\nI did not think much of that award last year. Proving that Bell‚Äôs No-Go Theorem cannot be right? Great. Finally! I think many scientists ‚Äì including Bell himself ‚Äì already knew this theorem was a typical GIGO argument: garbage in, garbage out. As the young Louis de Broglie famously wrote in the introduction of his thesis: hypotheses are worth only as much as the consequences that can be deduced from it, and the consequences of Bell‚Äôs Theorem did not make much sense. As I wrote in my post on it, Bell himself did not think much of his own theorem until, of course, he got nominated for a Nobel Prize: it is a bit hard to say you got nominated for a Nobel Prize for a theory you do not believe in yourself, isn‚Äôt it? In any case, Bell‚Äôs Theorem has now been experimentally disproved. That is ‚Äì without any doubt ‚Äì a rather good thing. üôÇ To save the face of the Nobel committee here (why award something that disproves something else that you would have given an award a few decades ago?): Bell would have gotten a Nobel Prize, but he died from brain hemorrhage before, and Nobel Prizes reward the living only.\n\nAs for entanglement, I repeat what I wrote many times already: the concept of entanglement ‚Äì for which these scientists got a Nobel Prize last year ‚Äì is just a fancy word for the simultaneous conservation of energy, linear and angular momentum (and ‚Äì if we are talking matter-particles ‚Äì charge). There is ‚Äòno spooky action at a distance‚Äô, as Einstein would derogatorily describe it when the idea was first mentioned to him. So, I do not see why a Nobel Prize should be awarded for rephrasing a rather logical outcome of photon experiments in metamathematical terms.\n\nFinally, the Nobel Prize committee writes that this has made a significant contribution to quantum information science. I wrote a paper on the quantum computing hype, in which I basically ask this question: qubits may or may not be better devices than MOSFETs to store data ‚Äì they are not, and they will probably never be ‚Äì but that is not the point. How does quantum information change the two-, three- or n-valued or other rule-based logic that is inherent to the processing of information? I wish the Nobel Prize committee could be somewhat more explicit on that because, when everything is said and done, one of the objectives of the Prize is to educate the general public about the advances of science, isn‚Äôt it?\n\nHowever, all this ranting of mine is, of course, unimportant. We know that it took the distinguished Royal Swedish Science Academy more than 15 years to even recognize the genius of an Einstein, so it was already clear then that their selection criteria were not necessarily rational. [Einstein finally got a well-deserved Nobel Prize, not for relativity theory (strangely enough: if there is one thing on which all physicist are agreed, it is that relativity theory is the bedrock of all of physics, isn‚Äôt it?), but for a much less-noted paper on the photoelectric effect ‚Äì in 1922: 17 years after his annus mirabilis papers had made a killing not only in academic circles but in the headlines of major newspapers as well, and 10 years after a lot of fellow scientists had nominated him for it (1910).]\n\nAgain, Mahatma Gandhi never got a Nobel Price for Peace (so Einstein should consider himself lucky to get some Nobel Prize, right?), while Ursula von der Leyen might be getting one for supporting the war with Russia, so I must remind myself of the fact that we do live in a funny world and, perhaps, we should not be trying to make sense of these rather weird historical things. üôÇ\n\nLet me turn to the main reason why I am writing this indignant post. It is this: I am utterly shocked by what Dr. John Clauser has done with his newly gained scientific prestige: he joined the CO2 coalition! For those who have never heard of it, it is a coalition of climate change deniers. A bunch of people who:\n\n(1) vehemently deny the one and only consensus amongst all climate scientists, and that is the average temperature on Earth has risen with about two degrees Celsius since the Industrial Revolution, and\n\n(2) say that, if climate change would be real (God forbid!), then we can reverse the trend by easy geo-engineering. We just need to use directed energy or whatever to create more white clouds. If that doesn‚Äôt work, then‚Ä¶ Well‚Ä¶ CO2 makes trees and plants grow, so it will all sort itself out by itself.\n\n[‚Ä¶]\n\nYes. That is, basically, what Dr. Clauser and all the other scientific advisors of this lobby group ‚Äì none of which have any credentials in the field they are criticizing (climate science) ‚Äì are saying, and they say it loud and clearly. That is weird enough, already. What is even weirder, is that ‚Äì to my surprise ‚Äì a lot of people are actually buying such nonsense.\n\nFrankly, I have not felt angry for a while, but this thing triggered an outburst of mine on YouTube, in which I state clearly what I think of Dr. Clauser and other eminent scientists who abuse their saint-like Nobel Prize status in society to deceive the general public. Watch my video rant, and think about it for yourself. Now, I am not interested in heated discussions on it: I know the basic facts. If you don‚Äôt, I listed them here. Look at the basic graphs and measurements before you would want to argue with me on this, please! To be clear on this: I will not entertain violent or emotional reactions to this post or my video. Moreover, I will delete them here on WordPress and also on my YouTube channel. Yes. For the first time in 10 years or so, I will exercise my right as a moderator of my channels, which is something I have never done before. üôÇ\n\n[‚Ä¶]\n\nI will now calm down and write something about the mainstream interpretation of quantum physics again. üôÇ In fact, this morning I woke up with a joke in my head. You will probably think the joke is not very good, but then I am not a comedian and so it is what it is and you can judge for yourself. The idea is that you‚Äôd learn something from it. Perhaps. üôÇ So, here we go.\n\nImagine shooting practice somewhere. A soldier fires at some target with a fine gun, and then everyone looks at the spread of the hits around the bullseye. The quantum physicist says: ‚ÄúSee: this is the Uncertainty Principle at work! What is the linear momentum of these bullets, and what is the distance to the target? Let us calculate the standard error.‚Äù The soldier looks astonished and says: ‚ÄúNo. This gun is no good. One of the engineers should check it.‚Äù Then the drill sergeant says this: ‚ÄúThe gun is fine. From this distance, all bullets should have hit the bullseye. You are a miserable shooter and you should really practice a lot more.‚Äù He then turns to the academic and says: ‚ÄúHow did you get in here? I do not understand a word of what you just said and, if I do, it is of no use whatsoever. Please bugger off asap!‚Äù\n\nThis is a stupid joke, perhaps, but there is a fine philosophical point to it: uncertainty is not inherent to Nature, and it also serves no purpose whatsoever in the science of engineering or in science in general. All in Nature is deterministic. Statistically deterministic, but deterministic nevertheless. We do not know the initial conditions of the system, perhaps, and that translates into seemingly random behavior, but if there is a pattern in that behavior (a diffraction pattern, in the case of electron or photon diffraction), then the conclusion should be that there is no such thing as metaphysical ‚Äòuncertainty‚Äô. In fact, if you abandon that principle, then there is no point in trying to discover the laws of the Universe, is there? Because if Nature is uncertain, then there are no laws, right? üôÇ\n\nTo underscore this point, I will, once again, remind you of what Heisenberg originally wrote about uncertainty. He wrote in German and distinguished three very different ideas of uncertainty:\n\n(1) The precision of our measurements may be limited: Heisenberg originally referred to this as an Ungenauigkeit.\n\n(2) Our measurement might disturb the position and, as such, cause the information to get lost and, as a result, introduce an uncertainty in our knowledge, but not in reality. Heisenberg originally referred to such uncertainty as an Unbestimmtheit.\n\n(3) One may also think the uncertainty is inherent to Nature: that is what Heisenberg referred to as Ungewissheit. There is nothing in Nature ‚Äì and also nothing in Heisenberg‚Äôs writings, really ‚Äì that warrants the elevation of this Ungewissheit to a dogma in modern physics. Why? Because it is the equivalent of a religious conviction, like God exists or He doesn‚Äôt (both are theses we cannot prove: Ryle labeled such hypotheses as ‚Äòcategory mistakes‚Äô).\n\nIndeed, when one reads the proceedings of the Solvay Conferences of the late 1920s, 1930s and immediately after WW II (see my summary of it in https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341177799_A_brief_history_of_quantum-mechanical_ideas), then it is pretty clear that none of the first-generation quantum physicists believed in such dogma and ‚Äì if they did ‚Äì that they also thought what I am writing here: that it should not be part of science but part of one‚Äôs personal religious beliefs.\n\nSo, once again, I repeat that this concept of entanglement ‚Äì for which John Clauser got a Nobel Prize last year ‚Äì is in the same category: it is just a fancy word for the simultaneous conservation of energy, linear and angular momentum, and charge. There is ‚Äòno spooky action at a distance‚Äô, as Einstein would derogatorily describe it when the idea was first mentioned to him.\n\nLet me end by noting the dishonor of Nobel Prize winner John Clauser once again. Climate change is real: we are right in the middle of it, and it is going to get a lot worse before it gets any better ‚Äì if it is ever going to get better (which, in my opinion, is a rather big ‚Äòif‚Äò‚Ä¶). So, no matter how many Nobel Prize winners deny it, they cannot change the fact that average temperature on Earth has risen by about 2 degrees Celsius since 1850 already. The question is not: is climate change happening? No. The question now is: how do we adapt to it ‚Äì and that is an urgent question ‚Äì and, then, the question is: can we, perhaps, slow down the trend, and how? In short, if these scientists from physics or the medical field or whatever other field they excel in are true and honest scientists, then they would do a great favor to mankind not by advocating geo-engineering schemes to reverse a trend they actually deny is there, but by helping to devise and promote practical measures to allow communities that are affected by natural disaster to better recover from them.\n\nSo, I‚Äôll conclude this rant by repeating what I think of all of this. Loud and clear: John Clauser and the other scientific advisors of the CO2 coalition are a disgrace to what goes under the name of ‚Äòscience‚Äô, and this umpteenth ‚Äòincident‚Äô in the history of science or logical thinking makes me think that it is about time that the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences does some serious soul-searching when, amongst the many nominations, it selects its candidates for a prestigious award like this. Alfred Nobel ‚Äì one of those geniuses who regretted his great contribution to science and technology was (also) (ab)used to increase the horrors of war ‚Äì must have turned too many times in his grave now‚Ä¶\n\nI wrote a post with this title already, but this time I mean it in a rather personal way: my last paper ‚Äì with the same title ‚Äì on ResearchGate sums up rather well whatever I achieved, and also whatever I did not explore any further because time and energy are lacking: I must pay more attention to my day job nowadays. üôÇ\n\nI am happy with the RG score all of my writing generated, the rare but heartfelt compliments I got from researchers with far more credentials than myself (such as, for example, Dr. Emmanouil Markoulakis of Nikolaos, which led me to put a paper on RG with a classical explanation of the Lamb shift), various friendly but not necessarily always agreeing commentators (one of them commenting here on this post: a good man!), and, yes, the interaction on my YouTube channel. But so‚Ä¶ Well‚Ä¶ That is it, then! üôÇ\n\nAs a farewell, I will just quote from the mentioned paper ‚Äì The End of Physics (only as a science, of course) ‚Äì hereunder, and I hope that will help you to do what all great scientists would want you to do, and that is to think things through for yourself. üôÇ\n\nBrussels, 22 July 2023\n\nBohr, Heisenberg, and other famous quantum physicists ‚Äì think of Richard Feynman, John Stewart Bell, Murray Gell-Mann, and quite a few other Nobel Prize winning theorists[1] ‚Äì have led us astray. They swapped a rational world view ‚Äì based on classical electromagnetic theory and statistical determinism ‚Äì for a mystery world in which anything is possible, but nothing is real.\n\nThey invented ‚Äòspooky action at a distance‚Äô (as Einstein derogatorily referred to it), for example. So, what actually explains that long-distance interaction, then? It is quite simple. There is no interaction, and so there is nothing spooky or imaginary or unreal about it: if by measuring the spin state of one photon, we also know the spin state of its twin far away, then it is ‚Äì quite simply ‚Äì because physical quantities such as energy and momentum (linear or angular) will be conserved if no other interference is there after the two matter- or light-particles were separated.\n\nPlain conservation laws explain many other things that are being described as ‚Äòplain mysteries‚Äô in quantum physics. The truth is this: there are no miracles or mysteries: everything has a physical cause and can be explained.[2] For example, there is also nothing mysterious about the interference pattern and the trajectory of an electron going through a slit, or one of two nearby slits. An electron is pointlike, but it is not infinitesimally small: it has an internal structure which explains its wave-like properties. Likewise, Mach-Zehnder one-photon interference can easily be explained when thinking of its polarization structure: a circularly polarized photon can be split in two linearly polarized electromagnetic waves, which are photons in their own right. Everything that you have been reading about mainstream quantum physics is, perhaps, not wrong, but it is highly misleading because it is all couched in guru language and mathematical gibberish.\n\nWhy is that mainstream physicists keep covering up? I am not sure: it is a strange mix of historical accident and, most probably, the human desire to be original or special, or the need to mobilize money for so-called fundamental research. I also suspect there is a rather deceitful intention to hide truths about what nuclear science should be all about, and that is to understand the enormous energies packed into elementary particles.[3]\n\nThe worst of all is that none of the explanations in mainstream quantum physics actually works: mainstream theory does not have a sound theory of signal propagation, for example (click the link to my paper on that or ‚Äì better, perhaps ‚Äì this link to our paper on signal propagation), and Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs hydrogen model is a model of a hypothetical atom modelling orbitals of equally hypothetical zero-spin electron pairs. Zero-spin electrons do not exist, and real-life hydrogen only has one proton at its center, and one electron orbiting around it. Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs equation is relativistically correct ‚Äì even if all mainstream physicists think it is not ‚Äì but the equation includes two mistakes that cancel each other out: it confuses the effective mass of an electron in motion with its total mass[4], and the 1/2 factor which is introduced by the m = 2meff substitution also takes care of the doubling of the potential that is needed to make the electron orbitals come out alright.\n\nThe worst thing of all is that mainstream quantum physicists never accurately modeled what they should have modeled: the hydrogen atom as a system of a real proton and a real electron (no hypothetical infinitesimally and structureless spin-zero particles). If they had done that, they would also be able to explain why hydrogen atoms come in molecular H2 pairs, and they would have a better theory of why two protons need a neutron to hold together in a helium nucleus. Moreover, they would have been able to explain what a neutron actually is.[5]\n\n[1] James Stewart Bell was nominated for a Nobel Prize, but died from a brain hemorrhage before he could accept the prize for his theorem.\n\n[2] The world of physics ‚Äì at the micro-scale ‚Äì is already fascinating enough: why should we invent mysteries?\n\n[3] We do not think these energies can be exploited any time soon. Even nuclear energy is just binding energy between protons and neutrons: a nuclear bomb does not release the energy that is packed into protons. These elementary particles survive the blast: they are the true ‚Äòatoms‚Äô of this world (in the Greek sense of ‚Äòa-tom‚Äô, which means indivisible).\n\n[4] Mass is a measure of the inertia to a change in the state of motion of an oscillating charge. We showed how this works by explaining Einstein‚Äôs mass-energy equivalence relation and clearly distinguishing the kinetic and potential energy of an electron. Feynman first models an electron in motion correctly, with an equally correct interpretation of the effective mass of an electron in motion, but then substitutes this effective mass by half the electron mass (meff = m/2) in an erroneous reasoning process based on the non-relativistic kinetic energy concept. The latter reasoning also leads to the widespread misconception that Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs equation would not be relativistically correct (see the Annexes to my paper on the matter-wave). For the trick it has to do, Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs wave equation is correct ‚Äì and then I mean also relativistically correct. üôÇ\n\n[5] A neutron is unstable outside of its nucleus. We, therefore, think it acts as the glue between protons, and it must be a composite particle.\n\nI had been wanting to update my paper on matter-antimatter pair creation and annihilation for a long time, and I finally did it: here is the new version of it. It was one of my early papers on ResearchGate and, somewhat surprising, it got quite a few downloads (all is relative: I am happy with a few thousand). I actually did not know why, but now I understand: it does take down the last defenses of QCD- and QFT-theorists. As such, I now think this paper is at least as groundbreaking as my paper on de Broglie‚Äôs matter-wave (which gets the most reads), or my paper on the proton radius (which gets the most recommendations).\n\nMy paper on de Broglie‚Äôs matter-wave is important because it explains why and how de Broglie‚Äôs bright insight (matter having some frequency and wavelength) was correct, but got the wrong interpretation: the frequencies and wavelengths are orbital frequencies, and the wavelengths are are not to be interpreted as linear distances (not like wavelengths of light) but the quantum-mechanical equivalent of the circumferences of orbital radii. The paper also shows why spin (in this or the opposite direction) should be incorporated into any analysis straight from the start: you cannot just ignore spin and plug it in back later. The paper on the proton radius shows how that works to yield short and concise explanations of the measurable properties of elementary particles (the electron and the proton). The two combined provide the framework: an analysis of matter in terms of pointlike particles does not get us anywhere. We must think of matter as charge in motion, and we must analyze the two- or three-dimensional structure of these oscillations, and use it to also explain interactions between matter-particles (elementary or composite) and light-particles (photons and neutrinos, basically). I have explained these mass-without-mass models too many times now, so I will not dwell on it.\n\nSo, how that paper on matter-antimatter pair creation and annihilation fit in? The revision resulted in a rather long and verbose thing, so I will refer you to it and just summarize it very briefly. Let me start by copying the abstract: ‚ÄúThe phenomenon of matter-antimatter pair creation and annihilation is usually taken as confirmation that, somehow, fields can condense into matter-particles or, conversely, that matter-particles can somehow turn into lightlike particles (photons and/or neutrinos, which are nothing but traveling fields: electromagnetic or, in the case of the neutrino, some strong field, perhaps). However, pair creation usually involves the presence of a nucleus or other charged particles (such as electrons in experiment #E144). We, therefore, wonder whether pair creation and annihilation cannot be analyzed as part of some nuclear process. To be precise, we argue that the usual nuclear reactions involving protons and neutrons can effectively account for the processes of pair creation and annihilation. We therefore argue that the need to invoke some quantum field theory (QFT) to explain these high-energy processes would need to be justified much better than it currently is.‚Äù\n\nNeedless to say, the last line above is a euphemism: we think our explanation is complete, and that QFT is plain useless. We wrote the following rather scathing appreciation of it in a footnote of the paper: ‚ÄúWe think of Aitchison & Hey‚Äôs presentation of [matter-antimatter pair creation and annihilation] in their Gauge Theories in Particle Physics (2012) ‚Äì or presentations (plural), we should say. It is considered to be an advanced but standard textbook on phenomena like this. However, one quickly finds oneself going through the index and scraping together various mathematical treatments ‚Äì wondering what they explain, and also wondering how all of the unanswered questions or hypotheses (such as, for example, the particularities of flavor mixing, helicity, the Majorana hypothesis, etcetera) contribute to understanding the nature of the matter at hand. I consider it a typical example of how ‚Äì paraphrasing Sabine Hossenfelder‚Äôs judgment on the state of advanced physics research ‚Äì physicist do indeed tend to get lost in math.‚Äù\n\nThat says it all. Our thesis is that charge cannot just appear or disappear: it is not being created out of nothing (or out of fields, we should say). The observations (think of pion production and decay from cosmic rays here) and the results of the experiments (the mentioned #E144 experiment or other high-energy experiments) cannot be disputed, but the mainstream interpretation of what actually happens or might be happening in those chain reactions suffers from what, in daily life, we would refer to as ‚Äòvery sloppy accounting‚Äô. Let me quote or paraphrase a few more lines from my paper to highlight the problem, and to also introduce my interpretation of things which, as usual, are based on a more structural analysis of what matter actually is:\n\n‚ÄúPair creation is most often observed in the presence of a nucleus. The role of the nucleus is usually reduced to that of a heavy mass only: it only appears in the explanation to absorb or provide some kinetic energy in the overall reaction. We instinctively feel the role of the nucleus must be far more important than what is usually suggested. To be specific, we suggest pair creation should (also) be analyzed as being part of a larger nuclear process involving neutron-proton interactions. [‚Ä¶]‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúCharge does not get ‚Äòlost‚Äô or is ‚Äòcreated‚Äô, but [can] switch its ‚Äòspacetime‚Äô or ‚Äòforce‚Äô signature [when interacting with high-energy (anti)photons or (anti)neutrinos].‚Äù\n\n‚Äú[The #E144 experiment or other high-energy experiments involving electrons] accounts for the result of the experiment in terms of mainstream QED analysis, and effectively thinks of the pair production being the result of the theoretical ‚ÄòBreit-Wheeler‚Äô pair production process from photons only. However, this description of the experiment fails to properly account for the incoming beam of electrons. That, then, is the main weakness of the ‚Äòexplanation‚Äô: it is a bit like making abstraction of the presence of the nucleus in the pair creation processes that take place near them (which, as mentioned above, account for the bulk of those).‚Äù\n\nWe will say nothing more about it here because we want to keep our blog post(s) short: read the paper! üôÇ To wrap this up for you, the reader(s) of this post, we will only quote or paraphrase some more ontological or philosophical remarks in it:\n\n‚ÄúThe three-layered structure of the electron (the classical, Compton and Bohr radii of the electron) suggest that charge may have some fractal structure and ‚Äì moreover ‚Äì that such fractal structure may be infinite. Why do we think so? If the fractal structure would not be infinite, we would have to acknowledge ‚Äì logically ‚Äì that some kind of hard core charge is at the center of the oscillations that make up these particles, and it would be very hard to explain how this can actually disappear.‚Äù [Note: This is a rather novel new subtlety in our realist interpretation of quantum physics, so you may want to think about it. Indeed, we were initially not very favorable to the idea of a fractal charge structure because such fractal structure is, perhaps, not entirely consistent with the idea of a Zitterbewegung charge with zero rest mass), we think much more favorably of the hypothesis now.]\n\n‚ÄúThe concept of charge is and remains mysterious. However, in philosophical or ontological terms, I do not think of it as a mystery: at some point, we must, perhaps, accept that the essence of the world is charge, and that:\n\nThere is also an antiworld, and that;\n\nIt consists of an anticharge that we can fully define in terms of the signature of the force(s) that keep it together, and that;\n\nThe two worlds can, quite simply, not co-exist or ‚Äì at least ‚Äì not interact with each other without annihilating each other.\n\nSuch simple view of things must, of course, feed into cosmological theories: how, then, came these two worlds into being? We offered some suggestions on that in a rather simple paper on cosmology (our one and only paper on the topic), but it is not a terrain that we have explored (yet).‚Äù\n\nSo, I will end this post in pretty much the same way as the old Looney Tunes or Merrie Melodies cartoons used to end, and that‚Äôs by saying: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all Folks.‚Äù üôÇ\n\nEnjoy life and do not worry too much. It is all under control and, if it is not, then that is OK too. üôÇ\n\nWhen I wrote my first PS in November last year, I thought it would be my last blog post here ‚Äì but the stats keep going up. Good enough here on WordPress, and even better on ResearchGate: a 170+ score now and still rising fast: top 1% climber still ‚Äì despite that I have published nothing since a year now ‚Äì which got me into the top 25% bracket of RG researchers in less than two years ‚Äì and, while it is far from going viral, further rise looks a bit inevitable now.\n\nIt clearly shows that I am not mad and that you are reading serious physics here ‚Äì but without the usual hocus-pocus and ‚Äòmystery‚Äô that leaves so many young and-not-so-young people disgusted. I repeat: there is no serious puzzle in physics any more. All that is being done now, is to further work out the consequences of the fundamental laws of physics that were written down about a hundred years ago (de Broglie wrote his thesis in 1924, so this centenary is almost there). For those who are seeking to simplify further by resorting to some kind of ‚Äòmeta-symbolism‚Äô or an even more ‚Äòholistic‚Äô perspective (whatever that might mean), I think the exchange below (from my ResearchGate account) might be useful. For the rest, I have nothing to add anymore. It is all there ! üôÇ\n\nM (7 days ago): Dear JL ‚Äì I was amazed to find your piece on the jitter-bugging phenomena [sic] (not hypothesis). I think you may find my more holistic perspective useful in fine-tuning your work. I hope you agree, and I would love to collaborate. After all, as far as I know, your work is the first substantive effort in nearly 60 years+ (in this very fertile direction). Cheers, etc. ~ M\n\nAstronomy_geometry_logic-v.1.pdf\n\nM (7 days ago): Dear JL ‚Äì Bravo!!! I just saw the abstract of your paper on conserving the enthusiasm of young people afflicted by modern SM-QM nonsense, dogma, etc. I am now even more motivated to have your help reviewing, editing, and developing my next-gen ontology of the cosmos. Cheers ~ M\n\nMy rapid-fire answers (yesterday and today):\n\nTxs man ! This developed partly because (1) I had too much time on my hands (a difficult past five years as I came back from abroad and my mom and bro died from cancer ‚Äì I had to go through cancer surgery myself) and (2) helping my son getting through his exams on quantum physics as part of his engineering studies (he is just as much as a rebel as me and (also) wanted more ‚Äòcommon-sense‚Äô explanations. The ‚Äòorbital‚Äô or ‚Äòcircular‚Äô motion concept for interpreting de Broglie‚Äôs wavefunction (orbital frequencies instead of linear ones) is the key to everything. üôÇ No magic. üôÇ Charge and motion are the only concepts that are real. üôÇ There is no copyright to what I produced (a lot is just about building further on strands the ‚ÄòOld Great‚Äô (including Schroedinger himself) had in mind) so feel free to use it and further develop. My blog post on Paul Ehrenfest‚Äô s suicide is probably still the most ‚Äòaccessible‚Äô introduction to it all. It is also tragic ‚Äì as tragic (or more, probably) as Dirac‚Äôs depression when he sort of ‚Äòturned his back‚Äô on the young wolves he used to support ‚Äì but still‚Ä¶ https://readingfeynman.org/2020/05/27/ehrenfest-and-other-tragedies-in-physics/\n\n[‚Ä¶]\n\nI also did some YouTube videos to ‚Äòmarket‚Äô it all ‚Äì but there is only so much one can do. It is a weird situation. APS, WSP and even Springer Verlag wanted to do something with me but they all backed off in the end. Fortunately I do not suffer from much ego (one advantage of my experience in war-torn countries such as Afghanistan and in Ukraine (March)) ‚Äì so I take everything lightly. My ‚ÄúPost Scriptum‚Äù to my papers ‚Äì https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356556508_Post_Scriptum ‚Äì is a read of 15 minutes only and guides all of the material. Have fun with it ! Life is short. I know ‚Äì having come clean out of cancer (unlike my mom and my bro), so every day is a perfect day now. As for day job: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jean-louis-van-belle-85b74b7a/\n\n[‚Ä¶]\n\nAs for the formalism that you are introducing, I would recommend close(r) study of:\n\n(1) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrodynamics : my physics is a ‚Äòmass without mass‚Äô approach ‚Äì but I do not believe charge can be further reduced (we need the concept to distinguish between matter and anti-matter, for example ‚Äì geometry does not suffice to explain all degrees of freedom there);\n\n(2) The failure of Wittgenstein‚Äôs formalism ‚Äì as he admitted himself in what is commonly referred to as the ‚ÄòWittgenstein II‚Äô (nothing more than some of his comments in letters on his little booklet). I studied Wittgenstein as part of my philosophy studies and I am not too impressed. I feel we need a bit of ‚Äòcommon‚Äô language to add nuance and meaning to the mathematical symbols. Without the ambiguity in them, they do not mean all that much to me. Also see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_language_philosophy\n\n[‚Ä¶]\n\nTo add ‚Äì I also believe step (3) of the geometrodynamics is not possible. We can do without the mass concept (and still it is useful to use in the higher-level physics), but not without charge or fields. Charge and field are not further reducible. The last slide of my ‚Äòphilosophy and physics‚Äô presentation on YouTube shows the fundamental ‚Äòcategories‚Äô I believe in (categories in an Aristotelian sense). These concepts can be both ‚Äòrelative‚Äô or ‚Äòabsolute‚Äô (not-relative, in the sense of (special/general) relativity theory). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJxAh_uCNjs&t=16s\n\nOne more thing, despite my criticism on ‚ÄòWittgenstein-like‚Äô formalism, his first statement in his Tractatus should obviously be the point of departure of any ‚Äòmetaphysics‚Äô or epistemology: 1.1 Die Welt ist die Gesamtheit der Tatsachen, nicht der Dinge. Perhaps it is the only thing we can seriously say about ‚Äòthe world‚Äô or ‚Äòreality‚Äô. It serves as a ‚Äògood enough‚Äô definition to me, in any case. üôÇ\n\nAfter a long break (more than six months), I have started to engage again in a few conversations. I also looked at the 29 papers on my ResearchGate page, and I realize some of them would need to be re-written or re-packaged so as to ensure a good flow. Also, some of the approaches were more productive than others (some did not lead anywhere at all, actually), and I would need to point those out. I have been thinking about how to approach this, and I think I am going to produce an annotated version of these papers, with comments and corrections as mark-ups. Re-writing or re-structuring all of them would require to much work.\n\nThe mark-up of those papers is probably going to be based on some ‚Äòquick-fire‚Äô remarks (a succession of thoughts triggered by one and the same question) which come out of the conversation below, so I thank these thinkers for having kept me in the loop of a discussion I had followed but not reacted to. It is an interesting one ‚Äì on the question of ‚Äòdeep electron orbitals‚Äô (read: the orbitals of negative charge inside of a nucleus exist and, if so, how one can model them. If one could solve that question, one would have a theoretical basis for what is referred to as low-energy nuclear reactions. That was known formerly as cold fusion, but that got a bit of a bad name because of a number of crooks spoiling the field, unfortunately.\n\nPS: I leave the family names of my correspondents in the exchange below out so they cannot be bothered. One of them, Jerry, is a former American researcher at SLAC. Andrew ‚Äì the key researcher on DEPs ‚Äì is a Canadian astrophysicist, and the third one ‚Äì Jean-Luc ‚Äì is a rather prominent French scientist in LENR.]\n\nFrom: Jean Louis Van Belle\n\nSent: 18 November 2021 22:51\n\nSubject: Staying engaged (5)\n\nOh ‚Äì and needless to say, Dirac‚Äôs basic equation can, of course, be expanded using the binomial expansion ‚Äì just like the relativistic energy-momentum relation, and then one can ‚Äòcut off‚Äô the third-, fourth-, etc-order terms and keep the first and second-order terms only. Perhaps it is equations like that kept you puzzled (I should check your original emails). In any case, this way of going about energy equations for elementary particles is a bit the same as those used in perturbation equations in which ‚Äì as Dirac complained ‚Äì one randomly selects terms that seem to make sense and discard others because they do not seem to make sense.

As such, it repeats de Broglie‚Äôs mistake, and that is to interpret the ‚Äòde Broglie‚Äô wavelength as something linear. It is not: frequencies, wavelengths are orbital frequencies and orbital circumferences. So anything you would want to do with energy equations that are based on that, lead nowhere ‚Äì in my not-so-humble opinion, of course. To illustrate the point, compare the relativistic energy-momentum relation and Dirac‚Äôs basic equation in his Nobel Prize lecture (I hope the subscripts/superscripts get through your email system so they display correctly):\n\nm02c4 = E2 ‚Äì p2c2 (see, for example, Feynman-I-16, formula 16-3)\n\nDivide the above by c2 and re-arrange and you get Dirac‚Äôs equation: W2/c2 ‚Äì pr2 ‚Äì m2/c2 = 0 (see his 1933 Nobel Prize Lecture)\n\nSo that cannot lead anywhere.

I thought long and hard about some kind of model in which we have the charge radiate out a sub-Planck field, and that its ‚Äòretarded effects‚Äô might arrive ‚Äòjust in time‚Äô to the other side of the orbital (or whatever other point on the orbital) so as to produce the desired ‚Äòcourse correction‚Äô might explain it. I discarded it completely: I am now just happy that we have ‚Äòreduced‚Äô the mystery to this ‚ÄòPlanck-scale quantum-mechanical oscillation‚Äô (in 2D or 3D orbitals) without the need for an ‚Äòaether‚Äô, or quantized spacetime, or ‚Äòvirtual particles‚Äô actually ‚Äòholding the thing together‚Äô.\n\nAlso, a description in terms of four-vectors (scalar and vector potential) does not immediately call for ‚Äòretarded time‚Äô variables and all that, so that is another reason why I think one should somehow make the jump from E-B fields to scalar and vector potential, even if the math is hard to visualize. If we want to ‚Äòvisualize‚Äô things, Feynman‚Äôs discussion of the ‚Äòenergy‚Äô and ‚Äòmomentum‚Äô flow in https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_27.html might make sense, because I think analyses in terms of Poynting vectors are relativistically current, aren‚Äôt they?

So I want to ‚Äòclean‚Äô that up‚Ä¶ üòä JL\n\nFrom: Jean Louis Van Belle\n\nSent: 18 November 2021 21:21\n\nSubject: Staying engaged‚Ä¶\n\nPlease do include me in the exchanges, Andrew ‚Äì even if I do not react, I do read them because I do need some temptation and distraction. As mentioned, I wanted to focus on building a credible n = p + e model (for free neutrons but probably more focused on a Schrodinger-like D = p + e + p Platzwechsel model, because the deuteron nucleus is stable). But so I will not do that the way I studied the zbw model of the electron and proton (I believe that is sound now) ‚Äì so that‚Äôs with not putting in enough sleep. I want to do it slowly now. I find a lot of satisfaction in the fact that I think there is no need for complicated quantum field theories (fields are quantized, but in a rather obvious way: field oscillations ‚Äì just like matter-particles ‚Äì pack Planck‚Äôs quantum of (physical) action which ‚Äì depending on whether you freeze time or positions as a variable, expresses itself as a discrete amount of energy or, alternatively, as a discrete amount of momentum), nor is there any need for this ‚Äòontologization‚Äô of virtual field interactions (sub-Planck scale) ‚Äì the quark-gluon nonsense.\n\nAlso, it makes sense to distinguish between an electromagnetic and a ‚Äòstrong‚Äô or ‚Äònuclear‚Äô force: the electron and proton have different form factors (2D versus 3D oscillations, but that is a bit of a non-relativistic shorthand for what might be the case) but, in addition, there is clearly a much stronger force at play within the proton ‚Äì whose strength is the same kind of ‚Äòscale‚Äô as the force that gives the muon-electron its rather enormous mass. So that is my ‚Äòbelief‚Äô and the ‚Äòheuristic‚Äô models I build (a bit of ‚Äònumerology‚Äô according to Dr Pohl‚Äôs rather off-hand remarks) support it sufficiently for me to make me feel at peace about all these ‚ÄòBig Questions‚Äô.\n\nI am also happy I figured out these inconsistencies around 720-degree symmetries (just the result of a non-rigorous application of Occam‚Äôs Razor: if you use all possible ‚Äòsigns‚Äô in the wavefunction, then the wavefunction may represent matter as well as anti-matter particles, and these 720-degree weirdness dissolves). Finally, the kind of ‚Äòrenewed‚Äô S-matrix programme for analyzing unstable particles (adding a transient factor to wavefunctions) makes sense to me, but even the easiest set of equations look impossible to solve ‚Äì so I may want to dig into the math of that if I feel like having endless amounts of time and energy (which I do not ‚Äì but, after this cancer surgery, I know I will only die on some ‚Äòmoral‚Äô or ‚Äòmental‚Äô battlefield twenty or thirty years from now ‚Äì so I am optimistic).\n\nSo, in short, the DEP question does intrigue me ‚Äì and you should keep me posted, but I will only look at it to see if it can help me on that deuteron model. üòä That is the only ‚Äòdeep electron orbital‚Äô I actually believe in.

Even with no expectation of your contributing at this point, such emails might be an unwanted temptation and distraction.\n\nDear Jean-Luc,\n\nThank you for the Wiki-Links. They are useful. I agree that the 4-vector potential should be considered. Since I am now considering the nuclear potentials as well as the deep orbits, it makes sense to consider the nuclear vector potentials to have an origin in the relativistic Coulomb potentials. I am facing this in my attempts to calculate the deep orbits from contributions to the potential energies that have a vector component, which non-rel Coulomb potentials do not have.\n\nFor examples: do we include the losses in Vcb (e.g., from the binding energy BE) when we make the relativistic correction to the potential; or, how do we relativistically treat pseudo potentials such as that of centrifugal force? We know that for equilibrium, the average forces must cancel.

I‚Äôve been juggling a lot of work ‚Äì my regular job at the Ministry of Interior (I got an internal promotion/transfer, and am working now on police and security sector reform) plus consultancies on upcoming projects in Nepal. In addition, I am still recovering from my surgery ‚Äì I got a bad flue (not C19, fortunately) and it set back my auto-immune system, I feel. I have a bit of a holiday break now (combining the public holidays of 11 and 15 November in Belgium with some days off to bridge so I have a rather nice super-long weekend ‚Äì three in one, so to speak).\n\nAs for this thread, I feel like it is not ‚Äòphrasing‚Äô the discussion in the right ‚Äòlanguage‚Äô. Thinking of E-fields and retarded potential is thinking in terms of 3D potential, separating out space and time variables without using the ‚Äòpower‚Äô of four-vectors (four-vector potential, and four-vector space-time). It is important to remind ourselves that we are measuring fields in continuous space and time (but, again, this is relativistic space-time ‚Äì so us visualizing a 3D potential at some point in space is what it is: we visualize something because our mind needs that ‚Äì wants that). The fields are discrete, however: a field oscillation packs one unit of Planck ‚Äì always ‚Äì and Planck‚Äôs quantum of action combines energy and momentum: we should not think of energy and momentum as truly ‚Äòseparate‚Äô (discrete) variables, just like we should not think of space and time as truly ‚Äòseparate‚Äô (continuous) variables.\n\nI do not quite know what I want to say here ‚Äì or how I should further work it out. I am going to re-read my papers. I think I should further develop the last one (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351097421_The_concepts_of_charge_elementary_ring_currents_potential_potential_energy_and_field_oscillations), in which I write that the vector potential is more real than the electric field and the scalar potential should be further developed, and probably it is the combined scalar and vector potential that are the ‚Äôreal‚Äô things. Not the electric and magnetic field. Hence, illustrations like below ‚Äì in terms of discs and cones in space ‚Äì do probably not go all that far in terms of ‚Äòunderstanding‚Äô what it is going on‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just an intuition‚Ä¶\n\nCheers ‚Äì JL\n\nFrom: Andrew\n\nSent: 23 September 2021 17:17\n\nTo: Jean-Luc; Jerry; Jean Louis\n\nSubject: retarded potential?\n\nDear Jean-Luc,\n\nBecasue of the claim that gluons are tubal, I have been looking at the disk-shaped E-field lines of the highly-relativistic electron and comparing it to the retarded potential, which, based on timing, would seem to give a cone rather than a disk (see figure). This makes a difference when we consider a deep-orbiting electron. It even impacts selection of the model for impact of an electron when considering diffraction and interference.\n\nEven if the field appears to be spreading out as a cone, the direction of the field lines are that of a disk from the retarded source. However, how does it interact with the radial field of a stationary charge?\n\nDo you have any thoughts on the matter.\n\nBest regards,\n\nAndrew\n\n_ _ _\n\nOn Thu, Sep 23, 2021 at 5:05 AM Jean-Luc wrote:\n\nDear Andrew, Thank you for the references.

Of course, it has got nothing to do with Feynman‚Äôs original lecture‚Äîtitled: on Quantum Behavior: I just made some fun of Feynman‚Äôs preface and that‚Äôs basically it in terms of this iconic reference. Hence, Mr. Gottlieb should not make too much of a fuss‚Äîalthough I hope he will, of course, because it would draw more attention to the paper. It was a fun exercise because it encouraged me to join an interesting discussion on ResearchGate (I copied the topic and some up and down below) which, in turn, made me think some more about what I wrote about the form factor in the explanation of the electron, muon and proton. Let me copy the relevant paragraph:\n\nWhen we talked about the radius of a proton, we promised you we would talk some more about the form factor. The idea is very simple: an angular momentum (L) can always be written as the product of a moment of inertia (I) and an angular frequency (œâ). We also know that the moment of inertia for a rotating mass or a hoop is equal to I = mr2, while it is equal to I = mr2/4 for a solid disk. So you might think this explains the 1/4 factor: a proton is just an anti-muon but in disk version, right? It is like a muon because of the strong force inside, but it is even smaller because it packs its charge differently, right?\n\nMaybe. Maybe not. We think probably not. Maybe you will have more luck when playing with the formulas but we could not demonstrate this. First, we must note, once again, that the radius of a muon (about 1.87 fm) and a proton (0.83-0.84 fm) are both smaller than the radius of the pointlike charge inside of an electron (Œ±¬∑ƒß/mec ‚âà 2.818 fm). Hence, we should start by suggesting how we would pack the elementary charge into a muon first!\n\nSecond, we noted that the proton mass is 8.88 times that of the muon, while the radius is only 2.22 times smaller ‚Äì so, yes, that 1/4 ratio once more ‚Äì but these numbers are still weird: even if we would manage to, somehow, make abstraction of this form factor by accounting for the different angular momentum of a muon and a proton, we would probably still be left with a mass difference we cannot explain in terms of a unique force geometry.\n\nPerhaps we should introduce other hypotheses: a muon is, after all, unstable, and so there may be another factor there: excited states of electrons are unstable too and involve an n = 2 or some other number in Planck‚Äôs E = n¬∑h¬∑f equation, so perhaps we can play with that too.\n\nOur answer to such musings is: yes, you can. But please do let us know if you have more luck then us when playing with these formulas: it is the key to the mystery of the strong force, and we did not find it‚Äîso we hope you do!\n\nSo‚Ä¶ Well‚Ä¶ This is really as far as a realist interpretation of quantum mechanics will take you. One can solve most so-called mysteries in quantum mechanics (interference of electrons, tunneling and what have you) with plain old classical equations (applying Planck‚Äôs relation to electromagnetic theory, basically) but here we are stuck: the elementary charge itself is a most mysterious thing. When packing it into an electron, a muon or a proton, Nature gives it a very different shape and size.\n\nThe shape or form factor is related to the angular momentum, while the size has got to do with scale: the scale of a muon and proton is very different than that of an electron‚Äîsmaller even than the pointlike Zitterbewegung charge which we used to explain the electron. So that‚Äôs where we are. It‚Äôs like we‚Äôve got two quanta‚Äîrather than one only: Planck‚Äôs quantum of action, and the elementary charge. Indeed, Planck‚Äôs quantum of action may also be said to express itself itself very differently in space or in time (h = E¬∑T versus h = p¬∑Œª). Perhaps there is room for additional simplification, but I doubt it. Something inside of me says that, when everything is said and done, I will just have to accept that electrons are electrons, and protons are protons, and a muon is a weird unstable thing in-between‚Äîand all other weird unstable things in-between are non-equilibrium states which one cannot explain with easy math.\n\nWould that be good enough? For you? I cannot speak for you. Is it a good enough explanation for me? I am not sure. I have not made my mind up yet. I am taking a bit of a break from physics for the time being, but the question will surely continue to linger in the back of my mind. We‚Äôll keep you updated on progress ! Thanks for staying tuned ! JL\n\nPS: I realize the above might sound a bit like crackpot theory but that is just because it is very dense and very light writing at the same time. If you read the paper in full, you should be able to make sense of it. üôÇ You should also check the formulas for the moments of inertia: the I = mr2/4 formula for a solid disk depends on your choice of the axis of symmetry.\n\nDear Peter ‚Äì Thanks so much for checking the paper and your frank comments. That is very much appreciated. I know I have gone totally overboard in dismissing much of post-WW II developments in quantum physics ‚Äì most notably the idea of force-carrying particles (bosons ‚Äì including Higgs, W/Z bosons and gluons). My fundamental intuition here is that field theories should be fine for modeling interactions (I‚Äôll quote Dirac‚Äôs 1958 comments on that at the very end of my reply here) and, yes, we should not be limiting the idea of a field to EM fields only. So I surely do not want to give the impression I think classical 19th/early 20th century physics ‚Äì Planck‚Äôs relation, electromagnetic theory and relativity ‚Äì can explain everything.\n\nHaving said that, the current state of physics does resemble the state of scholastic philosophy before it was swept away by rationalism: I feel there has been a multiplication of ill-defined concepts that did not add much additional explanation of what might be the case (the latter expression is Wittgenstein‚Äôs definition of reality). So, yes, I feel we need some reincarnation of William of Occam to apply his Razor and kick ass. Fortunately, it looks like there are many people trying to do exactly that now ‚Äì a return to basics ‚Äì so that‚Äôs good: I feel like I can almost hear the tectonic plates moving. üôÇ\n\nMy last paper is a half-serious rewrite of Feynman‚Äôs first Lecture on Quantum Mechanics. Its intention is merely provocative: I want to highlight what of the ‚Äòmystery‚Äô in quantum physics is truly mysterious and what is humbug or ‚Äì as Feynman would call it ‚Äì Cargo Cult Science. The section on the ‚Äòform factor‚Äô (what is the ‚Äògeometry‚Äô of the strong force?) in that paper is the shortest and most naive paragraph in that text but it actually does highlight the one and only question that keeps me awake: what is that form factor, what different geometry do we need to explain a proton (or a muon) as opposed to, say, an electron? I know I have to dig into the kind of stuff that you are highlighting ‚Äì and Alex Burinskii‚Äôs Dirac-Kerr-Newman models (also integrating gravity) to find elements that ‚Äì one day ‚Äì may explain why a muon is not an electron, and why a proton is not a positron.\n\nIndeed, I think the electron and photon model are just fine: classical EM and Planck‚Äôs relation are all that‚Äôs needed and so I actually don‚Äôt waste to more time on the QED sector. But a decent muon and proton model will, obviously, require ‚Äùsomething else‚Äô than Planck‚Äôs relation, the electric charge and electromagnetic theory. The question here is: what is that ‚Äòsomething else‚Äô, exactly?\n\nEven if we find another charge or another field theory to explain the proton, then we‚Äôre just at the beginning of explaining the QCD sector. Indeed, the proton and muon are stable (fairly stable ‚Äì I should say ‚Äì in case of the muon ‚Äì which I want to investigate because of the question of matter generations). In contrast, transient particles and resonances do not respect Planck‚Äôs relation ‚Äì that‚Äôs why they are unstable ‚Äì and so we are talking non-equilibrium states and so that‚Äôs an entirely different ballgame. In short, I think Dirac‚Äôs final words in the very last (fourth) edition of his ‚ÄòPrinciples of Quantum Mechanics‚Äô still ring very true today. They were written in 1958 so Dirac was aware of the work of Gell-Man and Nishijima (the contours of quark-gluon theory) and, clearly, did not think much of it (I understand he also had conversations with Feynman on this):\n\n‚ÄúQuantum mechanics may be defined as the application of equations of motion to particles. [‚Ä¶] The domain of applicability of the theory is mainly the treatment of electrons and other charged particles interacting with the electromagnetic field‚éØa domain which includes most of low-energy physics and chemistry.\n\nNow there are other kinds of interactions, which are revealed in high-energy physics and are important for the description of atomic nuclei. These interactions are not at present sufficiently well understood to be incorporated into a system of equations of motion. Theories of them have been set up and much developed and useful results obtained from them. But in the absence of equations of motion these theories cannot be presented as a logical development of the principles set up in this book. We are effectively in the pre-Bohr era with regard to these other interactions. It is to be hoped that with increasing knowledge a way will eventually be found for adapting the high-energy theories into a scheme based on equations of motion, and so unifying them with those of low-energy physics.‚Äù\n\nAgain, many thanks for reacting and, yes, I will study the references you gave ‚Äì even if I am a bit skeptical of Wolfram‚Äôs new project. Cheers ‚Äì JL\n\nJoseph Larmor is surely not among the more famous participants in the Solvay Conferences. He only joined the 1921 Conference, together with Charles Glover Barkla and others, and his one and only substantial intervention there is limited to some remarks and questions following a presentation by H.A. Lorentz on the Theory of Electrons, during which Lorentz highlights all of the issues in regard to what was then supposed to be the understanding of what an electron actually is (which, in my not-so-humble-view, is still pretty much the state of our current understanding of it).\n\nI find his one intervention (and Lorentz‚Äô reply to it) very interesting though, and so that‚Äôs why I am writing about it here. I am not aware of any free online English translations of the proceedings of the Solvay Conferences (nor of any translation of Lorentz‚Äô paper in particular) but you may be luckier than me when googling: if you find it, please do let me know. In the meanwhile, I am happy to freely translate part of Larmor‚Äôs rather short intervention after Lorentz‚Äô presentation from French to English:\n\n‚ÄúI understand that Mr. Lorentz was given the task to give an overview of how electrons behave inside of an atom. That requires an overview of all possible theories of the electron. That is a highly worthwhile endeavor which, in itself, would already justify the holding of this Conference. However, Mr. Lorentz might have paid more attention to the viewpoint that the electron has some structure, and that its representation as a simple distribution of electric charge can only be provisional: electrons explain electricity, but electricity does not explain electrons. However, the description of an electron in terms of a charge distribution is, for the time being, all we can imagine. In the past, we thought of the atom as an indivisible unit ‚Äì a fundamental building block ‚Äì and we imagined it as a swirling ring. That idea is gone now, and the electron has now taken the place of the atom as an indestructible unit. All we can know about it, is how it influences other bodies. If this influence is transmitted all across the aether, we need to be able to express the relations between the electron and the aether[1], or its force field in the space that surrounds it. It may have other properties, of course, but physics is the science that should analyze the influence or force of one body upon others.\n\nThe question we should raise here is whether or not an electron formed by a perfectly uniform current ring can grab onto the aether in a physical sense, and how it does so if its configuration does not change.‚Äù (Joseph Larmor, 1921, boldface and italics added)\n\nLarmor then talks about the (possible) use of the energy-momentum tensor to address the latter question, which is a very technical discussion which is of no concern to us here. Indeed, the question on how to use tensors to model how an electron would interact with other charges or how it would create an electromagnetic field is, effectively, a rather standard textbook topic now and, in case you‚Äôd be interested, you can check my blog on it or, else, (re-)read Chapters 25, 26 and 27 of Feynman‚Äôs Lectures on electromagnetism.\n\nWhat grabbed my attention here was, effectively, not the technicality of the question in regard to the exact machinery of the electromagnetic force or field. It was Larmor‚Äôs description of the electron as a perpetual or persistent current ring (the French reference to it is this: un electron form√© par un courant annulaire parfaitement uniforme), and his language on it, which indicates he thought of it as a rather obvious and natural idea! Hence, Parson‚Äôs 1915 toroidal ring model ‚Äì the precursor to Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs Zitterbewegung model and modern-day ring current models ‚Äì was apparently pretty well established at the time! In fact, Rutherford‚Äôs lecture on the Structure of the Atom at the 1921 Conference further confirms this, as he also talks about Parson‚Äôs √©lectron annulaire (ring electron) and the apparent magnetic properties of the electron (I will talk about Rutherford‚Äôs 1921 Solvay lecture in my next post).\n\nLarmor‚Äôs belief that the electron was not pointlike should, of course, not surprise us in light of his rather famous work on the quantum-mechanical precession of the magnetic moment of an electron, but I actually wasn‚Äôt aware of Joseph Larmor‚Äôs own views in regard to its possible reality. In fact, I am only guessing here but his rather strong views on its reality may explain why the scientific committee ‚àí which became increasingly dominated by scientists in favor of the Bohr-Heisenberg interpretation of physical reality (basically saying we will never be able to understand it) ‚àí did not extend an invitation to Larmor to attend the all-important Solvay conferences that would follow the 1921 Conference and, most notably, the 1927 Conference that split physicists between realists and‚Ä¶ Well‚Ä¶ Non-realists, I guess. üôÇ\n\nLorentz‚Äô immediate reaction to Larmor mentioning the idea of a swirling ring (in French: un anneau tourbillon), which is part of his reply to Larmor‚Äôs remarks, is equally interesting:\n\n‚ÄúThere is a lot to be said for your view that electrons are discontinuities in the aether. [‚Ä¶] The energy-momentum formulas that I have developed should apply to all particles, with or without structure. The idea of a rotating ring [in French: anneau tournant] has a great advantage when trying to explain some issues [in the theory of an electron]: it would not emit any electromagnetic radiation. It would only produce a magnetic field in the immediate space that surrounds it. [‚Ä¶]‚Äù (H.A. Lorentz, 1921, boldface and italics added)\n\nIsn‚Äôt that just great? Lorentz‚Äô answer to Larmor‚Äôs question surely does not solve all of the problems relating to the interpretation of the electron as a current ring, but it sure answers that very basic question which proponents of modern quantum mechanics usually advance when talking about the so-called failure of classical physics: electrons in some electron orbital in an atom should radiate their energy out, but so they do not. Let me actually quote from Feynman‚Äôs Lectures on Quantum Mechanics here: ‚ÄúClassically, the electrons would radiate light and spiral in until they settle down right on top of the nucleus. That cannot be right.‚Äù\n\nSurely You‚Äôre Joking, Mr. Feynman! Here is the answer of the classical quantum theorists: superconducting rings of electric current do not radiate their energy out either, do they?\n\n[1] Larmor believed an aether should exist. We will re-quote Robert B. Laughlin here: ‚ÄúThe word ‚Äòether‚Äô has extremely negative connotations in theoretical physics because of its past association with opposition to relativity. This is unfortunate because, stripped of these connotations, it rather nicely captures the way most physicists actually think about the vacuum. [‚Ä¶] The modern concept of the vacuum of space, confirmed every day by experiment, is a relativistic ether. But we do not call it this because it is taboo.‚Äù\n\nOn the concept of the aether, we can also usefully translate part of Lorentz‚Äô answer to Larmor: ‚ÄúAs for the aether, even the physicists who still talk about it have stripped the concept of anything it might have in common with matter. I was a believer in an immobile aether myself but I realize that, because of relativity, we cannot talk about any force acting on the aether. However, I still think of the aether as the seat of electromagnetic energy (in French, le si√®ge de l‚Äô√©nergie √©lectromagn√©tique). Now, we can all think of the components of the energy-momentum tensor like we want, but if we think of some of them being real in some sense, then all of them should be real in the same sense.‚Äù\n\nPost scriptum: I should really stop duplicating posts between this and my other blog site on physics. Hence, I beg the readers who want to keep following me to do so on my ideez.org site. I think I‚Äôll devote it a historical analysis of how useful and not-so-useful ideas in physics have evolved over the past hundred years or so, using the proceedings of the Solvay Conferences as the material for analysis."
