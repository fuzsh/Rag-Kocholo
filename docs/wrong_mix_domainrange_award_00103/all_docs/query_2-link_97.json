        "text": "Kay\n\nI have just seen your posting. I don't think I can help you with your basic question but I am descended from the Quines.\n\nBecause there are so many Quine families I struggled to piece my family together. However, I have ascertained that my great grandfather William Quine had an older bother John. I understand that when their father died, their mother Esther could not inherit their farm, Conrhenny on the Onchan/Lonan border, so it went to John the oldest son. He appears to have sold it, throwing out the family, married Catherine Cain, and then immediately emigrated to Australia (on the John and Lucy). They ended up in Maryborough Victoria via Melbourne. They had Esther and 3 sons, one of whom died. Then Catherine died, so John Quine came back to the Island (onboard the SS Great Britain) with Esther and the surviving sons. John Immediately re-married and then died. (see old Onchan churchyard - he is buried with both wives named on his stone!). My great great grandparents, John's parents, are buried immediately in front of John.\n\nEsther married John Thomas Cowell. Their daughter Minnie married Charles Glover Barkla who later won the Nobel prize for Physics in 1917. Esther herself launched the Ben-my-chree III. J.T. Cowell was the last Receiver-General of the IOM, I think.\n\nThis is most of my research on this branch of 'my' Quines.\n\nI hope this enhances your story.\n\nI would be very interested in your photo(s) as I have no photo of Esther Quine.\n\nCould you kindly contact me direct on ben@filsham.co.uk.\n\nMany thanks\n\nBen"
