        "text": "Barbie\n\nUSA | 2023 | Greta Gerwig\n\nNow Playing - Jul 24, 2024\n\nSIFF Cinema Downtown\n\nTo live in Barbie Land is to be a perfect being in a perfect place. Unless you have a full-on existential crisis. Or you’re a Ken. Wear a \"Barbenheimer\" t-shirt to a screening for a free fountain soda.\n\nMore Details\n\nFantastic Fungi\n\nUSA | 2019 | 80 min. | Louie Schwartzberg\n\nNow Playing - Jul 25, 2024\n\nSIFF Cinema Uptown\n\nOriginally released in 2019, Fantastic Fungi quickly dazzled critics and moviegoers worldwide with its stunning visuals, captivating storytelling, and enlightening exploration of the interconnectedness of all life forms. Now, five years later, audiences will have the opportunity to rediscover this cinematic masterpiece in a whole new light.\n\nMore Details\n\nKinds of Kindness\n\nUSA | 2024 | 164 min. | Yorgos Lanthimos\n\nNow Playing\n\nSIFF Cinema Uptown\n\nKinds of Kindness is a triptych fable, following a man without choice who tries to take control of his own life; a policeman who is alarmed that his wife who was missing-at-sea has returned and seems a different person; and a woman determined to find a specific someone with a special ability, who is destined to become a prodigious spiritual leader.\n\nMore Details\n\nThelma\n\nUSA | 2024 | 97 min. | Josh Margolin\n\nNow Playing\n\nSIFF Cinema Uptown\n\nJune Squibb stars as a woman who gets scammed out of $10,000 and embarks on a daring mission across Los Angeles to recover it.\n\nMore Details\n\nThe Terminator\n\nUSA | 1984 | 107 min. | James Cameron\n\nJuly 25, 2024\n\nSIFF Cinema Egyptian\n\nIn 2029, the war between man and machine has desolated the Earth, leaving humanity all but wiped out. Pockets of survivors remain - either living as slaves serving their technological overlords, or as resistance fighters attempting to overthrow the sentient defence network that controls the machines.\n\nMore Details\n\nAdios Buenos Aires\n\nGermany | 2022 | 93 min. | German Kral\n\nOpens July 26, 2024\n\nSIFF Cinema Uptown\n\nBuenos Aires, November 2001. Argentina is embroiled in crisis, with the peso plunging deeper and deeper. Julio Färber, the charismatic bandoneon player of the \"Vecinos de Pompeya,\" a five-piece working-class tango band, is trying to keep his head above water, but every month he is earning less and less from their gigs as well as from the traditional shoe shop he inherited from his father.\n\nMore Details\n\nRewind, Be Kind: Scooby-Doo\n\nUSA | 2002 | 89 min. | Raja Gosnell\n\nJuly 26, 2024\n\nSIFF Cinema Egyptian\n\nZoinks! In the first live-action Scooby-Doo film, we find Mystery, Inc. hesitantly reconnecting on a horror-themed tropical island vacation. Some may roll their eyes at a modern adaptation of Scooby-Doo, but we consider this to be a comedic Zillennial masterpiece!\n\nMore Details\n\nRewind, Be Kind: Josie and the Pussycats\n\nUSA | 2001 | 98 min. | Deborah Kaplan, Harry Elfont\n\nJuly 27, 2024\n\nSIFF Cinema Egyptian\n\nA small-town rock band has a chance at fame and fortune when plucked from obscurity and offered a record deal from a major label. But what is the cost? Directors Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont in attendance for an in-person Q&A.\n\nMore Details\n\nRewind, Be Kind: The Mummy\n\nUSA | 1999 | 124 min. | Stephen Sommers\n\nJuly 27, 2024\n\nSIFF Cinema Egyptian\n\nAt an archaeological dig in the ancient city of Hamunaptra, an American serving in the French Foreign Legion accidentally awakens a mummy who begins to wreak havoc as he searches for the reincarnation of his long-lost love. Director Stephen Sommers in attendance for an in-person Q&A.\n\nMore Details\n\nRewind, Be Kind: Uptown Girls\n\nUSA | 2003 | 92 min. | Boaz Yakin\n\nJuly 27, 2024\n\nSIFF Cinema Egyptian\n\nBrittany Murphy stars in Uptown Girls as a New York City it-girl and daughter of a deceased rock star. When she loses her trust fund, she begins working as a nanny for an uptight eight-year-old (Dakota Fanning). Initially maligned by critics for being an immature chick flick with a specific focus on the female leads being “unlikeable”, Uptown Girls stands the test of time as a heartbreaking coming-of-age story.\n\nMore Details\n\nRewind, Be Kind: Van Helsing\n\nUSA | 2004 | 131 min. | Stephen Sommers\n\nJuly 27, 2024\n\nSIFF Cinema Egyptian\n\nHugh Jackman stars as the titular Van Helsing who must face off against Dracula and a monster mash of classic Universal creatures in a movie that Roger Ebert called “...silly and spectacular, and fun.” We think he was right. Director Stephen Sommers in attendance for an in-person Q&A.\n\nMore Details\n\nRewind, Be Kind: Lady in the Water\n\nUSA | 2006 | 110 min. | M. Night Shyamalan\n\nJuly 28, 2024\n\nSIFF Cinema Egyptian\n\nM. Night Shyamalan crafts a fairy tale about a jaded superintendent (Paul Giamatti) who discovers a water nymph in the community pool and is tasked with returning her to her blue world. Both a critical and financial failure, this one is too beautiful and sincere to dismiss as a strike.\n\nMore Details\n\nRewind, Be Kind: Sunshine (35mm)\n\nUnited Kingdom | 2007 | 107 min. | Danny Boyle\n\nJuly 28, 2024\n\nSIFF Cinema Egyptian\n\nSunshine has us join a team of eight international astronauts aboard the Icarus II, a ship on a mission to reignite our dying sun. Despite impressive visuals and a stacked cast, audiences didn’t take to Danny Boyle’s sci-fi thriller. Even so, this ship merits a ride in our book. Presented on 35mm.\n\nMore Details\n\nRewind, Be Kind: The Phantom of the Opera\n\nUnited Kingdom | 2004 | 143 min. | Joel Schumacher\n\nJuly 28, 2024\n\nSIFF Cinema Egyptian\n\nJoel Schumacher brings Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “The Phantom of the Opera” to the silver screen. Despite this film being one of Schumacher’s largest spectacles, critics had an inconsistent list of complaints. We feel that The Phantom of the Opera is a beautiful dream that deserves a revisit!\n\nMore Details\n\nScope Screenings\n\nUSA | 3 hours\n\nJuly 30, 2024\n\nSIFF Cinema Egyptian\n\nJoin us at Scope Screenings for a monthly celebration of cinema and community. Each session features a diverse lineup of narrative shorts, music videos, and feature trailers. Doors open at 6:30 PM for socializing, with screenings kicking off at 7:30 PM, creating a dynamic hub for creatives and film enthusiasts alike.\n\nMore Details\n\nKneecap\n\nIreland | 2024 | Rich Peppiatt\n\nOpens August 1, 2024\n\nSIFF Cinema Uptown\n\nThere are 80,000 native Irish speakers in Ireland. 6,000 live in the North of Ireland.
