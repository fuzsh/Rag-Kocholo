        "text": "Winner of the Palme d’Or at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe latest from legendary director Ken Loach is a gripping, human tale about the impact one man can make.\n\nDaniel Blake (Dave Johns) has worked as a joiner most of his life in Newcastle. Now, for the first time ever, he needs help from the State. Gruff but goodhearted, Blake is a man out of time: a widowed woodworker who’s never owned a computer, he lives according to his own common sense moral code.\n\nBut after a heart attack leaves him unable to work and the state welfare system fails him, the stubbornly self-reliant Daniel must stand up and fight for his dignity, leading a one-man crusade for compassion.\n\nHe crosses paths with a single mother Katie (Hayley Squires) and her two young children, Daisy and Dylan. Katie’s only chance to escape a one-roomed homeless hostel in London has been to accept a flat in a city she doesn’t know, some 300 miles away.\n\nDaniel and Katie find themselves in no-man’s land, caught on the barbed wire of welfare bureaucracy as played out against the rhetoric of ‘striver and skiver’ in modern day Britain.\n\nGraced with humor and heart, I, Daniel Blake is a moving, much-needed reminder of the power of empathy from one of the world’s greatest living filmmakers.\n\nNATIONAL EVENING OF SCIENCE ON SCREEN®\n\nEnrichment, plasticity – capabilities of the brain we now take for granted – were the scientific battleground where Dr. Marian Diamond decisively challenged the old view and changed forever our paradigm for understanding the brain … and all our lives as well. What she revealed about the brain allows us to get the most out of our brain, not just as children but for our entire lives.\n\nHer YouTube lecture series has almost 2 million hits. She did the first-ever scientific analysis of the most famous brain ever, Albert Einstein. She is a beloved professor, worthy role model especially for women and girls in science, and all round brain-whisperer.\n\nThe documentary is part biography, part scientific adventure story, part inspirational tale – filmed over 5 years.\n\nBefore the film, Wendy Suzuki, Ph.D., Professor of Neural Science and psychology at New York University, will speak on the effects of exercise on the brain. The film’s co-director Catherine Ryan will field Q&A after the film via Skype.\n\nAbout Science on Screen®\n\nAn initiative of the COOLIDGE CORNER THEATRE\n\nWith major support from the ALFRED P. SLOAN FOUNDATION\n\nCoolidge Corner Theatre started Science on Screen in 2005 with funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. The program went national in 2011. Real Art Ways was one of the eight original theaters chosen nationally to receive funding to curate our own series.\n\nAbout the Speaker\n\nWendy Suzuki, Ph.D. is a Professor of Neural Science and psychology at New York University. She received her undergraduate degree from U.C. Berkeley and her Ph.D. in Neuroscience from U.C. San Diego. She completed a post-doctoral fellowship at the National Institutes of Health before starting her faculty position in the Center for Neural Science at New York University in 1998.\n\nWendy is a recipient of numerous grants and awards for her research including the Lindsley Prize from the Society for Neuroscience, the prestigious Troland Research award from the National Academy of Sciences and NYU’s Golden Dozen Teaching award.\n\nHer research has focused on understanding the patterns of brain activity underlying long-term memory and understanding how aerobic exercise affects mood, learning, memory and cognitive abilities.\n\nHer first book “Healthy Brain Happy Life” came out in paperback in March of 2016 and is an international bestseller.\n\nToshiro Mifune (1920-97) was the most prominent actor of Japan’s Golden Age of Cinema in the 1950s and 60s. He appeared in nearly 170 films, but his most compelling work was with director Akira Kurosawa with whom he made 16 films. Together they created enduring works of art — RASHOMON, SEVEN SAMURAI, THRONE OF BLOOD, YOJIMBO, THE BAD SLEEP WELL, RED BEARD — that thrilled audiences and influenced filmmaking around the world. Without them, there would be no MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, Clint Eastwood wouldn’t have A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, and Darth Vader wouldn’t be a samurai.\n\nJust as John Ford and John Wayne elevated the American Western, exploring the human side of America’s violent expansion, Kurosawa and Mifune transformed the chanbara film, the period sword fighting movie, into bold, provocative narratives that pushed beyond the boundaries of the genre and examined the role of the individual in society. Mifune – wry, charismatic and deadly — was the first non-white action star to attract international attention.\n\nMIFUNE: THE LAST SAMURAI explores the evolution of Chanbara movies; Mifune’s World War II experience; his accidental entry into moviemaking; and fortuitous collaboration with Kurosawa. The film is narrated by Keanu Reeves; directed by Academy Award-winning filmmaker Steven Okazaki; and produced by Toshiaki Nakazawa (13 ASSASSINS and the Academy Award-winning DEPARTURES) and Toichiro Shiraishi. It focuses on six of Mifune’s greatest films and features interviews with Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Teruyo Nogami (Kurosawa’s longtime script supervisor), Kyoko Kagawa (RED BEARD), Yoshio Tsuchiya (SEVEN SAMURAI), Takeshi Kato (THRONE OF BLOOD), Yoko Tsukasa (YOJIMBO), and many others.\n\nOctober, 2008. Young nun Colleen (Addison Timlin) is avoiding all contact from her family, until an email from her mother announces, “Your brother is home.”\n\nOn returning to her childhood home in Asheville, NC, she finds her old room exactly how she left it: painted black and covered in goth/metal posters.\n\nHer parents (Ally Sheedy & Peter Hedges) are happy enough to see her, but unease and awkwardness abounds. Her brother (Keith Poulson) is living as a recluse in the guesthouse since returning home from the Iraq war.\n\nDuring Colleen’s visit, tensions rise and fall with a little help from Halloween, pot cupcakes, and GWAR.\n\nLittle Sister is a dark comedy about family – a schmaltz-free, pathos-drenched, feel good movie for the little goth girl inside us all.\n\nIn this vibrant portrayal of Australian adolescence, Greta Driscoll’s bubble of obscure loserdom is burst when her parents throw her a surprise 15th birthday party and invite the whole school!\n\nPerfectly content being a wallflower, suddenly Greta’s flung far from her comfort zone into a distant, parallel place – a strange world that’s a little frightening and a lot weird, but only there can she find herself.\n\nEqual measures Wes Anderson and Lewis Carroll, GIRL ASLEEP is an enchanting journey into the absurd – and sometimes scary – depths of the teenage mind.\n\nBased on the critically acclaimed production by Windmill Theatre (Adelaide, Australia), Girl Asleep is a journey into the absurd, scary and beautiful heart of the teenage mind.\n\nAlso on the bill is the short film, “Pickle.”\n\nAmy Nicholson’s award-winning short “Pickle” has no business being as funny as it is. The award-winning 15-minute short is an energetic and amusing overview of what sounds like an entirely traumatizing experience, as it chronicles 25 years of Tom and Debbie Nicholson’s unbelievably bad luck with a bevy of rescue animals, from the eponymous Pickle the fish to an entire flock of ill-fated fowl.\n\nThe film’s official synopsis strikes the appropriate balance between off-kilter humor and almost overwhelming heartache: “Let us reflect on the brief existence of Pickle the fish. Although he could not swim, he was lovingly cared for by a couple that kept him propped up in a sponge. Along with an obese chicken, a cat with a heart condition, and a paraplegic possum, his life is a celebration of man’s eternal capacity to care for all creatures. He will be dearly missed.”\n\nStanley Kubrick’s Paths of Glory is among the most powerful antiwar films ever made. A fiery Kirk Douglas stars as a World War I French colonel who goes head-to-head with the army’s ruthless top brass when his men are accused of cowardice after being unable to carry out an impossible mission.\n\nThis haunting, exquisitely photographed dissection of the military machine in all its absurdity and capacity for dehumanization (a theme Kubrick would continue to explore throughout his career) is assembled with its legendary director’s customary precision, from its tense trench warfare sequences to its gripping courtroom climax to its ravaging final scene.\n\nAbout Film 101:\n\nModeled after a college Introduction to Film Studies course, the series features lively and engaging post-film discussions with fellow film buffs, guided by a professor from a local university. Participants learn how to view a series of classic and/or contemporary films with a critical eye and engage with the screen on a deeper level.\n\nThe films are shown in our cinema and the post-film discussions take place in our galleries.\n\nAbout Lecturer, Pedro Bermudez:\n\nPedro Bermudez is a Visiting Assistant Professor of Cinema at the University of Hartford, an award-winning filmmaker and co-founder of Revisionist, a film and music video production company whose work runs the gamut from commercials to documentaries.\n\nThis unorthodox dream western by Robert Altman may be the most radically beautiful film to come out of the New American Cinema. It stars Warren Beatty and Julie Christie as two newcomers to the raw Pacific Northwest mining town of Presbyterian Church, who join forces to provide the miners with a superior kind of brothel experience.\n\nThe appearance of representatives of a powerful mining company with interests of its own, however, threatens to be the undoing of their plans. With its fascinating flawed characters, evocative cinematography by the great Vilmos Zsigmond, innovative overlapping dialogue, and haunting use of Leonard Cohen songs, McCabe & Mrs. Miller brilliantly deglamorized and revitalized the most American of genres.\n\nAbout Film 101:\n\nModeled after a college Introduction to Film Studies course, the series features lively and engaging post-film discussions with fellow film buffs, guided by a professor from a local university.

In Congress, Neruda (Luis Gnecco) accuses the left-wing government of betraying the Communist Party and is swiftly impeached. The bumbling Police prefect Oscar Peluchonneau (Bernal) is appointed to arrest him.\n\nNeruda tries to flee the country with his wife Delia, but they are forced into hiding. Yet the poet is somehow inspired by the dramatic events of his new life as a fugitive, and uses this struggle as an opportunity to reinvent his work and life, leaving clues for his nemesis designed to make their game of catand- mouse more dangerous, more intimate. Indeed in this ingeniously-crafted tale of the persecuted poet and his implacable adversary, Neruda discovers his own heroic possibilities: a chance to become both a symbol for liberty, and a literary legend.\n\nGripping, funny and ingeniously conceived, Neruda is undoubtedly Larrain’s finest accomplishment to date, and not to be missed.\n\nHELD OVER!\n\nIn Deconstructing The Beatles’ White Album, composer/producer Scott Freiman takes Beatles fans young and old into the studio with The Beatles as they create their bestselling album, The Beatles (commonly referred to as the White Album).\n\nReleased in 1968, the White Album’s thirty songs span almost every style of music—from hard rock to country to chamber music to avant garde. Its recording took place during a remarkable year in Beatles history that included the death of Brian Epstein, the creation of Apple Corps, and a trip to India to study meditation.\n\nIn this multimedia presentation, Mr. Freiman transports his audience into Abbey Road Studio for a look at the revolutionary techniques used during the production of “Revolution,” “While My Guitar Gently Weeps,” “Blackbird,” and other songs from the White Album.\n\nIt will be an educational journey into the creative process of The Beatles performances and recording sessions, allowing the audience to see and hear the evolution of these groundbreaking songs and their lasting influence on popular music.\n\nTHE BRAND NEW TESTAMENT begins with one simple conceit: God exists, and He’s a jerk. He lives in a high-rise apartment in Brussels and never gets out of His pajamas. He takes sadistic delight in dreaming up new “laws” to torment humanity, and He’s a petty tyrant to his wife and ten year-old daughter, Ea.\n\nLike her brother before her, Ea has had enough of her Father’s abuse and when she spies the right opportunity, she hacks into His computer and leaks to the entire world—by text message—the only thing He has over them: their inevitable death date.\n\nEa, after escaping and with her Father in pursuit, gathers apostles and writes her own New Testament to try to fix the mess her Father has made of humanity.\n\nHer six apostles —a one-armed woman, a sex maniac, a killer, a woman who has been left by her husband, an office worker, and a gender dysphoric child—learn to celebrate life and love, and provide us with Jaco Van Dormael’s dark, witty and eccentric answer to the loaded question: what would you do if you knew exactly how much time you had left to live?\n\nFINAL WEEKEND!\n\nTHE EAGLE HUNTRESS follows Aisholpan, a 13-year-old girl, as she trains to become the first female in twelve generations of her Kazakh family to become an eagle hunter, and rises to the pinnacle of a tradition that has been handed down from father to son for centuries.\n\nSet against the breath-taking expanse of the Mongolian steppe, THE EAGLE HUNTRESS features some of the most awe-inspiring cinematography ever captured in a documentary, giving this intimate tale of a young girl’s quest the dramatic force of an epic narrative film.\n\nWhile there are many old Kazakh eagle hunters who vehemently reject the idea of any female taking part in their ancient tradition, Aisholpan’s father Nurgaiv believes that a girl can do anything a boy can, as long as she’s determined.\n\nThe story begins after Aisholpan has been training with her father’s eagle for many months. As every eagle can only have one master, the time has come for Aisholpan to capture an eagle of her own. Clambering down a sheer rock cliff with a rope, Aisholpan retrieves a fledgling eagle from its nest as its mother circles overhead. Her eagle will live, train, and hunt with her, until she releases it into the wild years later, so the cycle of life can continue.\n\nAfter months of training her eagle with her father, Aisholpan is ready to test her abilities. She enters a renowned competition, the Golden Eagle Festival, and faces off against 70 of the greatest Kazakh eagle hunters in Mongolia.\n\nThe most arduous challenge is yet to come, as the rite-of-passage for every young eagle hunter is to take part in a hunt. Aisholpan must ride with her father deep into the frigid mountains and endure 40 below zero temperatures and perilous landscapes to prove she is a true eagle huntress.\n\nTHE EAGLE HUNTRESS is executive produced and narrated by STAR WARS’s Daisy Ridley. Like Ridley’s character “Rey,” Aisholpan never doubts her ability to be as strong or brave as any boy. She recognizes no obstacles and refuses to have her ambition denied.\n\nWhile she practices an ancient art, Aisholpan’s story is a modern and inspiring one because she represents a world where a young girl’s dreams-no matter how challenging-can come true.\n\nDirected by Otto Bell, THE EAGLE HUNTRESS is narrated by Daisy Ridley, executive produced by Ridley, Morgan Spurlock and Jeremy Chilnick, and produced by Stacy Reiss, Sharon Chang and Otto Bell. The director of photography is Simon Niblett, the editor is Pierre Takal and the film features a stirring end credits song, “Angel by the Wings,” by Sia.\n\nWith its exceptional footage of animals in the wild, Seasons is the awe-inspiring and thought-provoking tale of the long and tumultuous shared history that inextricably binds humankind with the natural world.\n\nAfter traveling the world alongside migrating birds (Winged Migration) and diving the oceans with whales and manta rays (Oceans), Jacques Perrin and Jacques Cluzaud return to more familiar ground: the lush green forests and megafauna that emerged across Europe following the last Ice Age.\n\nWinter had gone on for 80,000 years when—in a relatively short period of time—the ice retreated, the landscape metamorphosed, the cycle of seasons was established, and the beasts occupied their new kingdom. It was only later that man arrived to share this habitat, first tentatively as migratory hunter/gatherers, then making inroads in the forest as settled agriculturalists, and later more dramatically via industry and warfare.\n\n– Opening Night Selection – 2016 Maine International Film Festival\n\n– Official Selection – 2016 Seattle International Film Festival\n\n– Official Selection – 2016 Martha’s Vineyards Environmental Film Festival\n\n– Official Selection – 2016 Boston French Film Festival\n\n– Official Selection – 2016 Columbus Children’s Film Festival\n\nOliver Sacks, the great neurologist, wrote that John Hull’s memoir, On Sight and Insight: A Journey into the World of Blindness is “the most extraordinary, precise, deep and beautiful account of blindness I have ever read.”\n\nWhen theologian John Hull (1935-2015) lost his sight at age 48, he embarked upon an audio diary, recording the physical and emotional transformations he experienced, as well as his brilliant, sophisticated philosophical observations on this life-changing event.\n\nMiddleton and Spinney dramatize Hull’s life and words: “I am concerned to understand blindness, to seek its meaning, to retain the fullness of my humanity.” He becomes aware of what he can experience, perhaps with even greater intensity: listening to music or the sound of rain falling onto different surfaces, dancing with his wife, feeling sunlight on his face, dreams, and memories.\n\nIntimate and immersive, the film embraces one man’s successful struggle to employ his intellectual and sensual resources to navigate this great trauma.\n\nRebecca Hall stars in director Antonio Campos’ third feature film, a behind-the-scenes look at the news crew at a 1970’s television station. Aspiring newswoman Christine Chubbuck (Rebecca Hall) finds herself butting heads with her boss, who pushes for sensationalized stories to drive up ratings.\n\nBased on true events, this intimate and sensitive portrait of a woman on the brink is grounded by Hall’s impeccable and transformative performance. Also starring are Michael C. Hall (“Dexter”), Maria Dizzia (“Orange Is The New Black”), and Timothy Simons (“Veep”).\n\nPlagued by self-doubt and a tumultuous home life, Christine’s diminishing hope begins to rise when an on-air co-worker (Michael C. Hall) initiates a friendship which ultimately becomes yet another unrequited love. Disillusioned as her world continues to close in on her, Christine takes a dark and surprising turn.\n\nBased on true events, Campos’ intimate and sensitive portrait of a woman on the brink is grounded by Hall’s impeccable and transformative performance as Christine. Rounding out the supporting cast are superlative performances by Michael C. Hall (“Dexter”), Tracy Letts (“Homeland,” Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright), Maria Dizzia (“Orange Is The New Black”), Timothy Simons (“Veep”) and J. Smith-Cameron (“Margaret”).\n\nThe magnificent Sônia Braga stars in the new film by acclaimed Brazilian director Kleber Mendonça Filho (Neighboring Sounds), about a retired music critic battling a corrupt real-estate firm as she struggles to hold on to her apartment.\n\nBrazilian writer-director Kleber Mendonça Filho, in the follow-up to his extraordinary 2013 feature debut Neighboring Sounds, continues to mine concerns about the alienating effects of urban development in Recife. Yet where that first film drew its insights from a broad range of characters uneasily cohabiting in a modern high-rise, Aquarius focuses on an individual: Clara (Sônia Braga, magnificent), a retired music critic and the sole tenant of an older apartment block being bought up by ruthless condo developers.\n\nAfter surviving a bout of cancer and the loss of her beloved husband, Clara is hardly about to let herself be bullied by the “generous” offers or insidious charms of Diego (Humberto Carrão), the American-educated scion of a powerful local real-estate firm. Diego tries everything in his power to force Clara out of her home, including hosting a noisy orgy in the suite above Clara’s — one that leaves a putrid mess in its wake. But when Clara starts pushing back, secrets are revealed, exposing the festering corruption that infects so much big business in Brazil.\n\nAquarius is a harsh study of classism, nepotism, and the lack of corporate accountability, but it is also about the meaningfulness of places and things: the history and memories contained in an apartment, a piece of furniture, or an LP purchased years ago in a used record store. Mendonça Filho has crafted a suspenseful drama about our relationship to the physical world. In doing so, he has given the inimitable Braga one of the finest roles of her storied career — a career she will discuss in detail in this year’s In Conversation With… programme.\n\nClara (Sonia Braga, “Kiss of the Spider Woman”), a 65-year-old widow and retired music critic, is the last resident of the Aquarius, one of the few buildings of its age and character that remains in a rapidly changing seaside Recife neighborhood.\n\nNow that the other apartments have been swept up by a company with ambitious plans for redevelopment, pressures to move on surround Clara from all sides. But she has pledged to leave only upon death, and will engage in a cold war with the developers to keep a home that has been a silent witness to her entire life.\n\nThe resulting confrontation is mysterious, frightening and nerve-wracking, tingeing even Clara’s most familiar routines with the tension of a thriller. But it is her passion for those close to her, for music, for her memories of past loves, and hunger for future ones, that makes the film a tremendous kaleidoscope of life’s pleasures and our reasons for defending them, from Brazil’s great chronicler of its present moment, Kleber Mendonça Filho."
