        "text": "Wise words on love by poet Gabriela Mistral. Lucila Godoy Alcayaga, aka Gabriela Mistral, born in Vicuna in Chile, was South America's first ever Nobel Prize laureate in literature. The daughter of a school teacher and poet, she began working as a teacher herself at the age of just 15 until her poetry became known. Her pseudonym, Gabriela Mistral, was taken from her favourite poets, Gabriele D'Annunzio and Nobel Prize laureate Frédéric Mistral. Have you read any of Mistral's poems?\n\n“Without him [Nobel Prize laureate James Allison], without my oncologist, my kids wouldn’t be here. My husband wouldn’t have a wife.” - cancer survivor Sharon Belvin. She was one of the first patients to benefit from an immune checkpoint inhibitor drug invented by Allison, which is one form of immunotherapy widely available today. At the age of 22, she was looking forward to getting married but was instead diagnosed with a type of skin cancer called metastatic melanoma that had spread to her lungs, lymph nodes and brain. Belvin was offered the opportunity to participate in a clinical trial for immunotherapy and received a checkpoint inhibitor called ipilimumab, which was the first treatment of any type with the ability to offer the hope of survival for patients with metastatic melanoma. “It worked textbook,” she said. Belvin’s tumours grew smaller until there was no evidence of cancer after one round of treatment. Belvin and several other cancer survivors who have benefitted from immune checkpoint therapy were in Stockholm, Sweden in December 2018 to help Allison and his co-laureate Tasuku Honjo celebrate receiving the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

And when you dream, you should make your dream as big as you can.\" Tawakkol Karman's dream for a more just world with freedom of expression and equal rights for all individuals, positioned her as a courageous leader in Yemen during the Arab Spring. Despite imprisonment and persecution for her journalism and advocacy for democracy and freedom of speech, she continued to stand firm in her beliefs under an oppressive regime. She was awarded the peace prize in 2011 for her non-violent efforts to promote peace and her struggle for women’s rights. Watch Karman's Nobel Prize lecture here: https://bit.ly/3a19mHr #NobelPrize\n\n\"It just so happens that people who value freedom the most are often deprived of it\" – Ales Bialiatski's 2022 Nobel Peace Prize lecture. The human rights activist is currently imprisoned in one of the harshest prisons in Belarus, having been jailed for 10 years without trial or conviction in the wake of demonstrations against President Lukashenko's dictatorship in 2021. It is not the first time that Bialiatski has been targeted by the country’s authorities. He has worked to promote democracy and human rights in Belarus since the 1980s and been imprisoned before. In response to a crackdown on protests, he founded Viasna (Spring) to provide support for the incarcerated demonstrators and their families. Last year, it was reported that Bialiatski had been denied contact with his lawyer and relatives, and was being held in a cell-type room. Recently it has been reported that his health is deteriorating yet medicines being provided by his family are not reaching him in jail. Learn more about Bialiatski's work: https://lnkd.in/g9-cXpAv"
