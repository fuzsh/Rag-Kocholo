        "text": "I'll take a shot but misplaced my Up Wi' the Bonnets book so may be a bit off with some of this.\n\nThink Chris Higgins is actually a harsh inclusion as we never conceded a goal with him on the pitch (3 substitute appearances). It was just a bit of a disappointment. I don't know what we really expected tbh, he'd just stepped up from part-time football and we dumped him as quickly as possible. No worse than loads we've had.\n\nCalls for Samson or Bullock are pretty harsh as well. We've had way worse goalkeepers and Kelvin Jack playing in a World Cup (which he fell down some stairs and conveniently missed two games) for a country with only like two 'keepers shouldn't let him off with it. Bullock was actually quite decent for us and Samson kept Roy out of the team for a while.\n\nBased on their playing ability with us:\n\n(5-3-2)\n\nSchenk\n\nCasement McCluskey Grassi\n\nKitamirike Law\n\nAlex Mearns Hughes\n\nKhaled Forbes\n\nGK: Arvid Schenk: Sorry Arvid, I have seen no evidence yet that you can catch a ball or have had any 'keeper training.\n\nRWB: Joel Kitamirike: When Duffy picked up this boy from Chelsea, we were pretty excited and thought we had unearthed a gem. Let's just say that it didn't end up like that. After leaving us, a spell in America didn't work out for him and he had a period in jail for drug supply. Since then, he seems to be off the radar.\n\nCB: Stuart McCluskey: In an attempt for new manager Alan Kernaghan to make his mark on the team, this 28 year old centre half was brought in who he knew from his time at St Johnstone and Clyde. Somehow, he went on to make 12 league starts (we conceded 20 goals). He made an ageing Bobby Mann look pacey at times.\n\nCB: Chris Casement: This right back/centre back was signed by Jocky Scott on a 3 year deal in the same summer where a considerable sum had been spent on Harkins and Griffiths. It was definitely exciting times and we thought we maybe had landed on a gem with a bit of hype about him. Uncomfirmed rumours suggest that Jocky had signed Casement to a large contract without watching him play, this would make a lot of sense. He charged from his dugout to abuse him in a pre-season friendly at Arbroath as he lacked any sort of positional awareness and would just hammer the ball out of play whenever he had time to walk down the wing. Only made one substitute appearance in the league and was limited to the cup. After a horror show in the first half in a Scottish Cup match at Livingston, Casement was hooked and sent back to Ireland. Never saw him again but I'm sure he made a fair whack out of Dundee.\n\nCB: Davide Grassi: In an effort to prepare ourselves for top flight football at short notice, Barry signed Grassi who had experience in this division with Aberdeen. Some of the reviews were awful but we accepted him with an open mind and we were vindicated with a great performance at Hearts which sealed our first win. The guy obviously had some sort of ability but I don't think he will ever compare to any defender at Dens for his positional sense. He was all over the place! One of my favourite Grassi moments was when he was brought on in Bomber's first match in charge (2-2 draw with St Johnstone) to play left back after a red card forced a defensive reshuffle. I vividly remember a St Johnstone attack where there seemed to be someone missing from the defence, when I looked up the park, he was strolling around the centre circle touching his hair before realising that he was a defender and jogging back towards the 18 yard box. There were some incredible things he would do that suggested that he had no defensive training whatsoever.\n\nLWB: Graeme Law: 22 year old signed up by Kernaghan after the relegation season and played three times (one of which was the 7-0 defeat at Airdrie). No words to describe how poor he was in those games. Now player/assistant manager at Tamworth and he's been playing in the English non leagues for years.\n\nCM: Eddie Mearns: After a successful trial spell, 19 year old Mearns joined up from Hearts. He sounded like he might be a player for us but in the few games he appeared in (Challenge Cup defeat to Alloa is one), he looked pretty out of his depth. Playing with Vale of Leithen in the Lowland League now.\n\nCM: Alex Cerdeira: Jim Duffy signed Dundee's first ever Brazilian in late October of our relegation season. Despite the hype and excitement around him, he only started one match (2-2 draw against Celtic where he played an hour) and he never really looked good in his appearances. He always seemed to be an observer and all these highlight reels we were shown of him were of the ball just hitting off him and him being pretty unaware. Amazed to see he was still going last season at Billericay Town in the English lower leagues.\n\nCM: Stephen Hughes: Inconsistent form was hurting our title run and Bomber needed to bring someone in to provide a lift. The sort of player we needed was a winger with pace (Martin Boyle was benched) as we missed Nicky Riley but Bomber opted for experience and signed this player from East Fife (while letting him play an additional match against his beloved Rangers before arriving). He was described by Aberdeen fans in their season before as making an ageing Gavin Rae look pacey, we found that hard to believe. Started his only game against Falkirk and managed only a half in what was quite possibly the worst half I have ever seen Dundee play in. Combined with Christian Nade, who was clearly not match fit, we were ripped to shreads and it was a miracle we went in only 1 down at half time. After being substituted, he sat on the bench for a few weeks and was then sent back to East Fife on loan.\n\nST: Khemas Khaled - Algerian boy that arrived during the Bonneti era. Would have been around 21 or 22 at the time. Found out he's still kicking around as a striker for a B team in a French regional league. Here is something I found on his wikipedia that was pretty apt:\n\nOn July 11, 2010, Kemas signed a two year contract with MC Alger.[1] However, he was released from the club the following month after failing to convince head coach Alain Michel of his abilities.[2]\n\nST: Barry Forbes - Young forward that played under Bonneti and Duffy. One of these players who the phrase 'he'll come on and learn' never worked for."
