        "text": "'It's fitting the game took place in the City of Discovery... we all learned a lot about Hearts'\n\nGreg Playfair\n\nFan writer\n\nItâs fair to say there were few joyous Jambos on Saturday evening after witnessing a filleting by Dundee during a first half collapse.\n\nIf it went on for 10 minutes longer, you sensed that the ravenous Dees would have got another couple of goals before the break, such was their buoyancy in that period and Hearts looking all at sea.\n\nIt's rather fitting that this humbling defeat took place in the City of Discovery, as all connected with Hearts would have learned something from that game.\n\nSupporting Hearts is a rollercoaster of emotions, with what feels like countless lows and sporadic highs, however this result will not define our season and will not be the âworst resultâ that will happen between now and next May... we're only two games into the season.\n\nThereâs quite rightly been questions asked of Steven Naismithâs decision to change formation and revert to a back three, despite the encouraging display against Rangers where we looked promising with a back four of defenders.\n\nNaismith said he wanted to counter against Dundeeâs two strikers and thereâs been talk that Yan Dhanda was struggling for fitness, which is why he swapped him out the starting line-up for defender Daniel Oyegoke.\n\nIâd rather force the opposition to worry about our strengths and try to contain them, like what Tony Docherty did. The worrying thing is it was clear 10 minutes into the match that our central midfielders were being overran by the impressive Dundee trio.\n\nAs soon as right-back Gerald Taylor got away with escaping a red card, you could see he and the rest of the team were all at sea. Forget the debate about formations at this point, their heads had gone and who knows what Taylor was thinking when he put the ball into his own net moments later to make it 2-0.\n\nI would have liked Naismith to address the glaring lack of leadership in our defensive third by getting Stephen Kingsley on there and then, as mistake across the backline soon followed.\n\nA reaction came along with the three half-time substitutions but we lacked the quality and perhaps belief to overturn the three-goal deficit, despite getting one back.\n\nAs said, we canât jump to conclusions after one poor result, but hopefully everyone will have been analysing this all week, and can eradicate the abundance of errors that were on display up in Dundee.\n\nUp next? A banana skin of a fixture in the trip to face John McGlynnâs Falkirk. Theyâre a confident team, given their unbeaten League 1 season last year as they bulldozed sides away to the title, and their strong, unbeaten start to the Championship season.\n\nI don't believe Naismith will disrespect Falkirk by making wholesale changes to his side and quite frankly, he shouldnât given the players need to right the wrongs from last weekâs performance. We might see some older and experienced heads come back into the starting line up however in Craig Gordon â as the cup goalkeeper â and experienced defenders Craig Halkett and Stephen Kingsley.\n\nIf the fans' clamour is listened to and a back four is deployed, Iâd expect us to shade this tricky League Cup tie by one goal.\n\n'Unacceptable'; 'outfought and outplayed'\n\nHearts fans, we asked for your views after that defeat to Dundee on Saturday.\n\nHere's what some of you had to say:\n\nIan: Terrible. We have to stop changing the team every week. Find the best 11 and stick with it. It's the managers' fault for this latest shambles.\n\nIan F: Yesterday showed why we will not challenge Celtic or Rangers in the league. Too many games like that have you lagging behind. We were outfought and outplayed and Dundee look more likely to challenge for third spot. Three defeats in friendlies, a draw and a defeat in two league games show a worrying trend. Big problems.\n\nSteve: Looking at the line-up, I never thought weâd get anything from this game. Gerald Taylor has been outstanding at right-back, but was pushed into right midfield, Yan Dhanda left on the bench, Jorge Grant and Cammy Devlin not up to the job, but the manager should take the blame. Gutted.\n\nBrian: Hopeless. Going to be another average season with a very average manager.\n\nGeorge: Why change the team after such a good performance? Continuity of team selection is underestimated and the Dundee players' attitude should be a benchmark for the Hearts squad.\n\nDavid: Why are we always so sluggish at the start of a game? I would have thought the players would have taken the game to Dundee after last week's fine performance but it didnât happen. We have to sign another goalscorer as I canât believe Lawrence Shankland will be with us at the end of the transfer window.\n\nKevin: Worst performance for a long time. Poor system choice by Naismith. Grant and Barrie McKay have talent but no heart and aren't good enough. The second half was better, but the damage was done. Hopefully a lesson has been learned.\n\n'A class act' - your views on Naismith's new deal\n\nWe asked for your thoughts after Hearts head coach Steven Naismith signed a new deal with the club.\n\nHere's what you had to say:\n\nBob: A great piece of management from the hierarchy at Tynecastle. We often worry about what might happen to our best players if we let them go on the cheap but, by tying Naismith down to a longer-term contract we show consistency and confidence while protecting ourselves from losing Naismith to another team. The future is maroon!\n\nKevo: His high standards and knowledge of the game are permeating through the squad, would have been sacrosanct not to allow this.\n\nRichard: Based on last season extending the coaching staff's contracts is a no-brainer. They'll now be judged on this season though, and many fans have a binary relationship with managers and players, them being either great or awful without recognition that progress is either slow or stop-start in reality. I hope he does well (obviously) and any hiccups are tolerated.\n\nIan: I'll be expecting Hearts to do better in the cup competitions this season. If not, it has not been a good idea to extend Naismith's contract. There's been a lot of talk about how good the new signings will be for Hearts; let's see.\n\nMike: Good news that Hearts have tied down the management team for a further year. I think Naismith will have a huge career as a manager at a higher level. As a player he maximised his ability going from Killie to Rangers and then Everton. Hopefully his time at Hearts will get us closer to the Old Firm despite the disparity in budgets and wages.\n\nRonnie: Naismith needs to beat the Old Firm for me to take to him. Repeatedly he goes at it against Celtic but flatters to deceive against Rangers which isn't for me as a long-time Hearts fan. He needs to go to Glasgow like Alex Ferguson did and beat them in their own back yard and repeatedly beat them both at Tynecastle. If he does this then OK.\n\nAlan: Loving Naismith's quiet confidence and how he goes about his business. Quality and competition throughout the squad, more resilience mentally, front foot attacking intent, a youth team pathway, player development generating income and tactical aptitude. This isn't just down to him obviously but he puts the pieces together. A class act.\n\nSteven: Extending Steven Naismith's contract is a clever bit of business. Hearts are already trying to extend the contracts of their key players; keeping the manager really cements the intention to build for the future. Very positive.\n\nNaismith's first year 'better than expected'\n\nNaismith has been reflecting on his \"better than expected\" first year in charge of Hearts after penning a contract extension until 2026.\n\nThe former B team manager also praised Hearts' transformation off the pitch, saying the club has some facilities that rank as the \"best in the league\".\n\n\"It probably has gone better than I expected because of the amount of hard work and change we have managed to do,\" Naismith said.\n\n\"Thatâs the way we play, the squad in general. Itâs the whole bigger picture, the facility, the way we prepare, our nutrition, the chefs weâve got. I would argue in some areas we have got the best in the league.\"\n\nNaismith's coaching staff, who have also signed extended contracts, were all promoted from within when he took the top job last summer.\n\nHe said: \"Iâve worked with Gall [Paul Gallacher] at the club, I worked with Gordy [Gordon Forrest] a player and a coach, and I worked with Frankie [McAvoy] when I was a player at Norwich.\n\n\"Then I worked with him up here in his role with the academy. I think we fit really well together.\n\n\"When I was a player and you know youâre going down this (management) route, you start to think of who would you have working with you.\n\n\"Right from the off, Frankie and Gordy were guys high on my list. It probably fell into place much easier than I expected. Thatâs who I would have picked if Iâd gone anywhere in my first job.\""
