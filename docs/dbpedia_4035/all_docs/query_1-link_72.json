        "text": "Capturing the Hearts of a Nation\n\nHearts found inspiration for their namesake from the historical Old Tolbooth (or tax-house) on Edinburgh's Royal Mile, which served as a meeting place for Parliament, the Town Council, the Privy Council, and the High Court. The club's crest is based on the mosaic located outside the now demolished building.\n\nThe team were formed in 1874 and have been on quite a journey since then. They have won the Scottish Championship 4 times, the Scottish Cup 8 times, the Scottish League Cup 4 times - as well as battling some darker periods with financial uncertainty.\n\nThe Jam Tarts\n\nHearts have a dedicated following, who are often referred to as the 'Jambos' in reference to the clubs' nickname, The Jam Tarts. This originated from the First World War, when Edinburgh-based soldiers adopted Cockney rhyming slang from their southern army comrades!\n\nHearts have played their home fixtures at Tynecastle Park, in the Gorgie area of Edinburgh, since 1866. The stadium has a capacity of 20,099 and is widely considered to be one of the country's most atmospheric arenas.\n\nGiving Back to the Fans\n\nFootball is a way of life for Hearts supporters - having backed their team through thick and thin, we understand the importance of the club to its people.\n\nIn 2013 the club were on the brink - having filed for administration, their future was in doubt. However, following a period of upheaval, in 2021 the Jam Tarts were taken over by the Foundation of Hearts Supporters Trust - a group of 8,000 dedicated fans with the club's best interests at heart. They are now the largest fan owned club in the United Kingdom and are looking forward to a brighter future.\n\nOur partnership allows us to give back to the people of Edinburgh, through various initiatives such as signed giveaways and match day sponsorship packages."
