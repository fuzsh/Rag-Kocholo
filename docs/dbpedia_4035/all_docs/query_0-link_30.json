The Kennedy Award was the brainchild of Wheeling native Harrison H. Kennedy, who made his fortune on New York's Wall Street and became a member of the Downtown Athletic Club, the sponsor of the Heisman Trophy. Kennedy proposed the idea of sponsoring â through his estate with WesBanco, a state High School Football Player of the Year award to the West Virginia Sports Writers Association. It was called, for the first few years, the Heisman Trophy for Outstanding Football Player in West Virginia. However, the WVSWA named it for the originator, Mr. Kennedy, who had attended many banquets and presented the award before his death on Aug. 3, 1963. There have been only four state chairmen for the Kennedy Award selection: John B. Reynolds of Wheeling (1947-52), John T. Gellner of Charleston (1953-59), A.L. âShortyâ Hardman of Charleston (1960-91), and Doug Huff of Wheeling (1992-present).\n\nThe voting order:\n\nÂ\n\n2021\n\n1.

Eleven underclassmen have won the award â all juniors except sophomore J. R. House of Nitro in 1996. Athletes who won as juniors: Pat Shires of Hinton, 1947 (1st year); Bob Kelley of Weir, 1960 (age ineligible as senior); Danny Williams of DuPont, 1972; Robert Alexander of South Charleston, 1975; Mark Cisar of Magnolia, 1992; Chris Yura of Morgantown, 1997; Brandon Barrett of Martinsburg, 2002; Tyler Harris of South Charleston, 2009; Ryan Switzer of George Washington, 2011; and Jeremy Dillon of Mingo Central, 2016.\n\n2. Two-time winners are Williams, Alexander, Cisar, Barrett, and Switzer.\n\n3. African-American winners: Larry Drake of Fairmont Senior (1958), Bob Kelley (1960), Paul Allen of Huntington (1961), Melvin Walker of Dunbar (1965), Kerry Marbury of Monongah (1969), Rick Hurt of Charleston (1970), Alexander; Curt Warner of Pineville (1978), Tony Johnson of Morgantown (1983), Keith Jeter of Weir (1988), Eric McGhee of Wheeling Central (1990), Daryl âBoogieâ Johnson of Wheeling Park (1991), Randy Moss of DuPont (1994), Quincy Wilson of Weir (1998) (tie), Todd Mosby of Musselman (1999), Barrett; Tyler Harris of South Charleston (2009), Jamie âChazzyâ Thomas of Morgantown (2013), Kashuan Haley of Capital (2014), TyRhee Pratt of Capital (2015), and Latrell âMookieâ Collier of Bluefield (2017).\n\n4. Only honoree inducted into W.Va. Sports Hall of Fame is Warner, also an inductee into the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\n5. The only players to win the Hardman Award (Amateur Athlete of the Year) in the same year are Curt Warner of Pineville (1978) and J.R. House of Nitro (1998).\n\n6. As with college football's Heisman Trophy, most of the honorees played quarterback or running back. There are three notable Kennedy Award exceptions: two-time winners Brandon Barrett of Martinsburg (2002-03) and Randy Moss of DuPont (1996, â98), were honored primarily as wide receivers while Ted Kester of Winfield (1985) was honored primarily as a linebacker although he also was a running back-fullback.\n\n7. There was no award given for 1966 or 1967 because of estate problems for Harrison H. Kennedy, who passed away in 1963. He attended a few Victory Awards Dinners to present the award. When his estate, handled by WesBanco in his hometown of Wheeling, was settled, not only was the award continued but two annual monetary college scholarships have been given to Kennedy Award runners-up since 1997.\n\n8. Mr. Kennedy was a Wall Street banker and member of the Downtown Athletic Club, the sponsor of college football's Heisman Trophy. He eventually became Chairman ofÂ the Heisman Selection Board and wanted to start a similar award for high school athletes in his home state. For the first three years of the award, it was called the High School Heisman for W.Va., but was changed to the Kennedy Award in his honor in 1950.Â\n\n9. The Kennedy Award has had just four Selection Award chairmen: John B. Reynolds of Wheeling (1947-52), John T. Gelder Jr. of Charleston (1953-59), A.L. âShortyâ Hardman of Charleston (1960-91), and Doug Huff of Wheeling (1992-present).\n\n10. If any historical questions, or background, on the Kennedy Award are needed by the Kennedy Watch Panel, do not hesitate to contact Doug Huff at 304-233-5152 or huffsports@yahoo.com.\n\n11. During the 30th annual Victory Awards Dinner in Morgantown in 1976, John Dwight Kennedy, Orlando, Fla., resident, and Wheeling native, presented Kennedy Award in memory of his uncle, Harrison H. Kennedy, to South Charlestonâs Robert Alexander.Â\n\nÂ\n\nKENNEDY SCHOLARSHIPS\n\nHarrison H. Kennedyâs estate, which includes the Kennedy Award selections from the WVSWA, is handled by the Trust Department of WesBanco in his hometown of Wheeling. Besides sponsoring the award, as well as paying for the trophy and expenses, his will states that any interest in his estate can be used for scholarships.\n\n2024 â Murphy Clement, Martinsburg and Matt Frye, Scott\n\n2023 â Brett Phillips, Wheeling Park and Ezra Bagent, Martinsburg\n\n2022 â Jeremiah King, Robert C.
