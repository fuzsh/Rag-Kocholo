        "text": "This year, Digital Xtra received an overwhelming response with a record 141 submissions – a 50% increase on the previous year. While it is very encouraging to see the growing demand for extracurricular tech activities in Scotland, it also makes it even more difficult to select which applications are successful. After a lengthy evaluation process by a panel of volunteers from industry and education and skills sector, the charity is pleased to be supporting 26 schools and educational organisations during the 2023/24 academic year. The 26 grants cover 18 Local Authorities and include 13 primary schools, 4 secondary schools, 1 school for pupils with additional support needs, 2 councils, 1 library and 5 additional educational organisations. Altogether, this means Digital Xtra’s eighth round of grant awards has a projected engagement of 2,567 children and young people, including 1,344 girls and young women."
