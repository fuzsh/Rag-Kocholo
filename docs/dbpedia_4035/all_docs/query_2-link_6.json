        "text": "Saturday 23 September 2017, 14.30, New Dundas Park\n\nScottish Junior Cup First Round action between East Super League’s Bonnyrigg Rose and Shettleston of the West Super League First Division.\n\nIt was good to get to the football after plans to go to the League Cup Quarter Final between Motherwell and Aberdeen on the Thursday and the Scottish Cup tie between Spartans and Vale of Leithen both didn’t pan out.\n\nA first sight of Rose this season and despite the fantastic season they had in 2016-17, they ended up empty handed. They will be looking to rectify that this season.\n\nRunners-up in the East Super League to the now senior side Kelty Hearts, a semi-final defeat in the Junior Cup to Glenafton, a penalty shoot-out defeat to Tranent in the East of Scotland Cup Final and a run to the fourth round of the Scottish Cup where they went out to a clinical Hibs. The plaudits were plentiful, but the silverware was not as the number of games caught up with them at the end of the season.\n\nSince last season, they have signed goalkeeper Bryan Young from Whitehill Welfare, left back Neil Martynuik and midfielder Lee Currie from Newtongrange Star, Ross Gray from Linlithgow Rose, Mark McConnell from Edinburgh City and right back Dean Brett, who had left Rose to join Montrose, but changed his mind and came back.\n\nLeft back Ruaridh Donaldson has signed for Stenhousemuir, Chris Tobin has gone to Craigroyston, Scott Gray has gone to the United States and Ross Archibald has re-retired. Striker Sean Jamieson went to Penicuik Athletic in the week leading up to the game against Shettleston. The biggest loss has been the departure of manager Robbie Horn, who has taken the reins at Berwick Rangers. Coach David White has stepped into the Rose hot seat.\n\nRose have had six wins and two draws in the league and sat in second place, two points behind leaders Penicuik.\n\nIt’s a long time since I’ve seen Shettleston in action. Formed in 1903 they are nicknamed ‘The Town’ and are currently in the West Super League First Division, the second top league in the West Juniors.\n\nThey started life playing at Well Park, but were forced to vacate at short notice in 1932 as the land was required for house building. They moved to Frank Field Park and renamed it Greenfield Park, where they still play their home fixtures today, in the East End of Glasgow.\n\nThey have won a number of trophies in their history including the Central A League in 1959-1960 and 1976-1977 and the West of Scotland Cup in 1974-1975, 1992-1993 and 1994-1995.\n\nTheir solitary appearance in the Junior Cup Final came in 1959 when they lost 2-1 to Irvine Meadow at Hampden Park. They also reached the semi-final in 2001.\n\nThey have become a bit of a yo-yo club in recent times and most recently played in the top league in 2014-15, but it was a one season stay. Last season saw them finish in seventh spot.\n\nSome may recognise the name of goalkeeper Gary Whyte. He gained nationwide fame last season for being sent off in a match against Shotts Bon Accord for urinating behind his own goal during the match.\n\nIt’s been a tumultuous start to the season for Shettleston. A new management duo of James McKenna and Keith Docherty were sacked 36 days after being appointed and just before the start of the season. The two had made a raft of signings after being left with just 4 players for the season ahead.\n\nSeven players had come on board from Broomhouse Amateurs where Docherty had been manager, and a further nine had also been signed up. Hugh Kelly and Bernie Beacom have now taken on the managerial duties and several of the players brought in over the summer departed after the changes in management.\n\nIt had been a tough start and they went into the cup tie rooted to the bottom of the league, with a solitary point from their five games and they also finished bottom of their Central Sectional League Cup Group.\n\nThere’s been a few changes at New Dundas Park since we were last there, with some smoothing of ground and new dugouts etc. Although it may have been the undulations of the pitch, it looked as if the edge of the box had been lined by someone at the end of a night out.\n\nThere were around 250 in attendance.\n\nRose looked to make a positive start and in the opening minute McIntosh found Gray on the left, but his ball into the middle was too hard for anyone to get on the end of.\n\nAs a gentleman arrived next to us, he was greeted with “Alright Jock, how’s things?” Jock replied “F*cking terrible.” When asked what was wrong, he replied “oh nothing, just living the dream.”\n\nIn the sixth minute, Hoskins struck a shot on the Shettleston goal from the left which whistled just past the post.\n\nBrown curled a free kick towards goal in 13 minutes from around 22 yards, but it hit the side netting of the visitor’s goal.\n\nWith 17 minutes gone, Martin trotted across to take a Shettleston free kick and sent an attempted cross behind the goal for a bye-kick. This was the second time he had wasted one from a promising position.\n\nBrett crossed into the Shettleston box in 18 minutes and the ball was booted high in the air by a defender. It dropped at the edge of the box to McIntosh, whose half volley was just wide of the post.\n\nMcGachie was next to have a go from the edge of Shettleston’s box, but he skyed his shot from 20 yards.\n\nRose’s Moyes had to go off for treatment in 20 minutes with a bleeding nose but quickly returned to the fray.\n\nIn 23 minutes, Hoskins took out Makofo on the right touchline. Martin went across to take the free kick and again sent the ball behind the goal.\n\nShettleston worked the ball to Kisuka near the edge of the Rose box in 25 minutes, but his shot lacked power and it was comfortable for Young, although Kisuka may have been caught as he struck it.\n\nA long ball forward into the Shettleston box by Young in 28 minutes saw a defender put the ball behind. Currie’s corner was met powerfully by the head of Young and it flew into the top corner to give the hosts the lead.\n\nYoung was involved again in 31 minutes when his through ball saw McGachie racing into the box on the right and as Whyte came out he dinked it over him, but could only hit the side netting.\n\nRose put some good football together in 37 minutes after Currie had intercepted the ball in midfield. It ended with Brown playing the ball to Currie who beat a defender before seeing his shot take a nick as it went narrowly wide.\n\nA minute later Rose came forward again and Gray passed to McIntosh on the right. His cross was taken down expertly by Gray before he volleyed just wide of goal.\n\nAfter McDowell had been booked for a foul on McGachie, Brown put Rose’s free kick into the box in 41 minutes. It was half cleared but played back in to McGachie who looked to miskick, which took him somewhat fortuitously past the keeper, before he rolled it into the net to make it two-nil.\n\nScott picked up the game’s first booking in 43 minutes, for taking out Rose’s McIntosh as Bonnyrigg broke.\n\nTwo nil to the home side at the interval.\n\nWith three minutes of the second half gone Currie chipped the ball into the Shettleston box for Brett, but he couldn’t keep his header down.\n\nA Brett cross from the right in 49 minutes picked out the head of McGachie in the heart of the Shettleston box and his clever header completely wrong-footed Whyte, but shaved the post as it went wide.\n\nMcGachie was brought down just outside the “D” on the edge of the Shettleston box in 60 minutes and it was three Rose defenders who discussed who would take it. Brett eventually won the argument and his effort took a deflection off the wall and spun into the net past a helpless Whyte to make it three.\n\nRose showed no sign of being happy to rest on their lead and when McGachie laid the ball back to Brown in 62 minutes, his first time cross picked out Brett at the back post, but he headed over.\n\nShettleston’s McIntosh needed treatment in 65 minutes after a challenge by Hoskins. He limped back on soon after. He only lasted another five minutes though.\n\nKisuka won the ball for Shettleston in 70 minutes and Luczi took it forward, but his shot was too high.\n\nIn 74 minutes, Brett cut the ball back to Turner from the Shettleston by-line, but Whyte blocked his shot.\n\nMartin was yellow carded in 75 minutes for bringing down a Rose player on the side of the box after being nutmegged. Brown played the free kick back to Currie on the edge of the box and he hit a very well controlled shot low into the corner for Rose’s fourth.\n\nA Rose corner in 80 minutes by Currie was met well by the head of McConnell, but Whyte pushed the ball away from goal.\n\nMcEwan picked up a loose ball in 82 minutes and had a go at the Rose goal, but there wasn’t sufficient power in his shot to trouble Young.\n\nWith 6 minutes to go Brett’s cross into the Shettleston area eluded everyone in the middle and came to Martynuik at the far post. He fired the ball back into the mix and McConnell showed good reactions to nod the ball into the net to make it 5-0.\n\nCurrie played a one-two with McGachie inside the Shettleston box in 87 minutes, but off balance, he was unable to get a good strike on the ball and Whyte gathered.\n\nIn injury time Young was booked for bringing down Kisuka as Shettleston looked to break.\n\nAn easy win for Bonnyrigg who never really looked to be at the top of their game but were very comfortable throughout. A tough afternoon for Shettleston but they never gave up and kudos goes to them for continuing to try to play football as the match progressed.\n\nMoyes and Currie were both excellent for Rose and Brown also had a very good game, although the whole defence looked very solid. Shettleston won’t be up against that level of defender every week, but Kisuka, McIntosh and Makofo all showed good touches which suggests they will cause problems in the league this season.\n\nRather than the Shettleston keeper, it was the crowd that were relieved this time. Relieved that he managed to hold on until after the game to go to the toilet.\n\nFull Time: Bonnyrigg Rose 5 Shettleston Juniors 0\n\nAdmission: £6\n\nBonnyrigg Rose: 1 Bryan Young, 2 Dean Brett, 5 Ewan Moyes, 4 Kerr Young, 6 Dean Hoskins, 3 Jonny Brown (Martynuik 78), 7 Scott Gray (Turner 66), 11 Lee Currie, 10 Alan Horne, 9 Wayne McIntosh (McConnell 57), 11 Kieran McGachie.

On that occasion, they won 3-2 at Camelon in a league match.\n\nIt is, however, our first visit to Laing Park, which ‘the Gowfers’ have called home since 2004. There is grass banking all round with the changing rooms on one side, along with a snack bar and a couple of containers, one of which houses a bar for hospitality purposes.\n\nWith no cover, we had our fingers crossed that the rain would stay off. It was raining earlier in the afternoon.\n\nThey are in their seventh season in a row in the Super League and finished 11th last season. New signings for this term are winger Marc Walker from Arbroath Vics, central defenders Adam Harwood from Montrose and Derek Paterson from Kirriemuir Thistle, midfielder Jake Mair from Broughty Athletic and strikers Ryan Dignan from Dundee Violet and Pat Martin from Dundee North End.\n\nPanmure began their campaign with a 2-1 loss at Bo’ness United, before losing 5-0 at home to Lochee United. A 3-2 home win over Broxburn Athletic steadied the ship and then they won 2-0 at Forfar West End. Wins at Newtongrange Star and at home to Camelon were followed by a 3-3 draw at Kennoway Star Hearts which saw them sitting in fifth place after their seven league games.\n\nAdam Harwood was suspended after being sent off in the draw at Kennoway and captain Steven Cook was on holiday. Long term injury victims Ryan Roche and Liam Scott were also missing.\n\nWe saw Penicuik when they won against Newtongrange in August, making it two wins from two after their opening day win over Linlithgow Rose. They then won at Dundonald Bluebell and Bo’ness United before drawing at home to Sauchie. A one-nil win at Hill of Beath Hawthorn set them up for a top of the table clash against Bonnyrigg Rose where they drew 2-2. They went into the game with Panmure top of the table.\n\nPenicuik were without Keith Lough who was injured against Bonnyrigg, the unavailable Sam Jones and Ross Montgomery and Andrew Forbes, who was possibly experiencing a different kind of strip, as he was on his stag do. Penicuik only had three substitutes, with one a trialist, rumoured to be manager Johnny Harvey.\n\nBoth sides had makeshift right backs, with Penicuik playing a central defender there and Panmure playing a midfielder.\n\nThere were around 70 in the ground as the game kicked off.\n\nWith 5 minutes gone, Roberts chipped the ball through the Penicuik defence and Dignan beat the offside claims and he hammered the ball across goal from the by-line. Allison managed to get an arm to block the cross and the defence cleared.\n\nDignan played the ball wide to Urquhart in 8 minutes as Panmure came forward again. His cross into the middle saw Martin go down in the box, but nothing was given.\n\nPenicuik broke in 11 minutes and Young passed down the right to Kateleza. His cross was deflected and Mair headed behind.\n\nMcGeehan got a sore one in 13 minutes when Kateleza blocked his attempted clearance and he seemed to jar his ankle. He went off for treatment and limped back on, but soon after had to succumb to his injury. Buggins went to right back with Conway dropping back into defence.\n\nSome good build up play by Penicuik in 19 minutes ended with Kateleza crossing into the box, but Paterson headed behind.\n\nMartin created some space for himself on the edge of the Penicuik box in 26 minutes, but his shot drifted wide.\n\nIn 29 minutes, Kateleza nicked the ball away from Conway and charged towards the Panmure goal. As Robbie came out to meet him, he tried to knock the ball into the path of Jack Hamilton, but there was a misunderstanding between the two Penicuik strikers and Robbie gratefully dived on the ball.\n\nRoberts may have been lucky to escape a booking in 30 minutes for a late tackle on Penicuik’s Barr, but the referee made do with having a word.\n\nKateleza showed some great skill in 32 minutes before laying the ball off to Jack Hamilton in the Panmure box. His shot was close, but hit the side netting.\n\nMore good football by the visitors in 34 minutes saw Ponton through on goal, but he was denied by Robbie who managed to turn the ball behind.\n\nBarr and McCrory-Irving played a one-two in 35 minutes which saw the former through on the right side of the Panmure box, but Conway slid in to block the shot behind.\n\nMacDonald brought down Panmure’s Roberts on the corner of the box in 38 minutes, but the free kick was fired over the bar.\n\nA fine cross by Kateleza in 40 minutes looked to be right on the head of Jack Hamilton, but Robbie got a finger to it to direct it over his head. The ball was eventually played back to McCrory-Irving, but his effort was wide.\n\nPenicuik’s Gary Hamilton picked up the game’s first booking in 42 minutes for a foul.\n\nWith 44 minutes gone McCrory-Irving latched onto a headed clearance and curled a shot towards the Panmure goal, but Robbie was there again to tip the ball over the bar.\n\nJust before the break McCrory-Irving found Kateleza and his shot at goal took a nick before going wide of the Panmure goal.\n\nStill goalless at the break and Penicuik were getting more on top as the half progressed and really should have been in front. Robbie wasn’t in the mood to concede and had made a number of good stops in the first 45 minutes.\n\nWith three minutes of the second half gone Hume made a good interception and burst out of the Penicuik defence. He played a pass over the Panmure defence for Hamilton. Robbie came out of his goal and managed to block and Kateleza was eased off the ball going for the rebound.\n\nThere were winces all round after Panmure’s Martin was hit with the ball between the legs in 49 minutes.\n\nPonton put the ball across the face of the Panmure goal in 51 minutes, but there were no takers.\n\nA great cushioned header by Jack Hamilton found Kateleza in the Panmure box in 54 minutes, but he could only hit the side netting.\n\nPenicuik reorganised in 57 minutes after bringing Mendes on, with MacDonald going to right back and Young taking over from Gary Hamilton in central defence.\n\nMcCrory-Irving intercepted a Roberts pass in 60 minutes and passed into the path of Kateleza who was clean through on the Panmure goal, but the flag was up for offside.\n\nKateleza was the next Penicuik player booked in 61 minutes.\n\nPanmure attacked in 63 minutes with Dignan finding Martin, but his cut back from the by-line was turned behind by Barr.\n\nThere was a bit of a melee in 65 minutes as Barr caught Panmure’s Martin on the touchline, with Simpson spoken to by the referee for mouthing off at some Penicuik fans in the crowd and was booked.\n\nMendes was brought down on the edge of the Panmure box in 66 minutes by Conway, who was cautioned, but the resultant free kick hit the wall.\n\nA great run by Barr from half way in 72 minutes saw him go past a number of Panmure players and Hamilton took over at the edge of the box, but his shot was too high.\n\nKateleza took the ball into the Panmure box in 73 minutes and Conway’s tackle took the ball into the path of MacDonald whose cut back from the by-line picked out Barr at the front post. His first time shot saw Robbie get a foot to it, but he couldn’t keep it out and Penicuik led.\n\nHamilton ran onto a through ball in 76 minutes and outmuscled Paterson, but his shot was off target.\n\nIn 80 minutes Barr found Mendes and he played the ball in behind the home defence. Kateleza and Hamilton chased the ball and the latter got there first and knocked the ball past the outrushing Robbie and into the net to make it 2-0.\n\nPenicuik came forward again in 82 minutes with Hamilton playing the ball to MacDonald on the right. His cross was booted up in the air by Paterson and Hamilton tried a volley when the ball came down, but he was off balance and he couldn’t make good contact.\n\nHamilton was through again in 87 minutes, but Robbie saved again.\n\nAs Penicuik continued to press Hamilton fed Ponton on the left of the box in 88 minutes. He stepped inside a defender before shooting for goal and the ball came off the raised arm of Paterson. Penalty and a booking for the defender. Kateleza put the ball just out of reach of the diving Robbie to make it three.\n\nAs Hume won the ball from Dignan in the Penicuik box in 89 minutes, the Panmure striker held onto him. Hume looked like he was going to react as he went towards him, but he restrained himself before offering the ball to Dignan as he “hadn’t had a shot of it all through the game.”\n\nMacDonald was booked just before the whistle for kicking the ball against Panmure’s Roberts as he lay prone on the ground.\n\nA convincing win in the end for Penicuik to remain at the top of the league although they did leave it late. Robbie had kept ‘the Gowfers’ in the game, but the pressure told eventually. Not a good day for Panmure.\n\nRobbie was best for Panmure and Conway performed well after going back into defence. For Penicuik, Hume, Barr and Hamilton all played very well, with Barr’s energy and running a real stand out.\n\nSpecial mention to the tap in the gents toilet in the ground. I’ve not seen one like that before.\n\nFull Time: Carnoustie Panmure 0 Penicuik Athletic 3\n\nAdmission: £6\n\nCarnoustie Panmure: 1 Jamie Robbie, 2 Luke McGeehan (Steel 18), 3 Jake Mair, 4 Ewan Buggins, 5 Derek Paterson, 6 John Roberts, 7 Marc Walker (Simpson 57), 8 Alan Conway, 9 Ryan Dignan, 10 Patrick Martin, 11 Robert Urquhart.

Subs: 12 Fernando Yaffa Mendes, Aaron Somerville, Trialist.\n\nReferee: Chris Fordyce\n\nProgramme: £2\n\nSaturday 9 September 2017, 15.00, Murrayfield Stadium\n\nWe last saw Hearts lose on penalties to Dunfermline Athletic at Tynecastle at the end of July, which resulted in them going out of the League Cup. This proved to be the final match for manager Ian Cathro who was sacked a couple of days later, just before the start of the league season.\n\nPlayers have departed too, with Bjorn Johnsen going to ADO Den Haag, and Conor Sammon and Liam Smith have gone out on loan. It looked like Jamie Walker was also going to leave and sign for Rangers in the transfer window, but their refusal to meet Hearts’ valuation and seemingly wanting to pay in instalments means Walker is still in maroon. Hearts signed keeper Jon McLaughlin, who came in from Burton Albion.\n\nA lengthy process of appointing a new manager resulted in Jon Daly giving up his interim role in charge as existing Director of Football Craig Levein became manager on 28 August. Needless to say, not everyone was happy, with several fans already blaming Levein for everything in his previous role. Many still haven’t forgiven him for playing with nobody up front in the Czech Republic when he was Scotland manager. They clearly have forgotten Levein’s previous spell at Hearts when he presided over a 7-1 win over Dunfermline, 5-1 against Hibs, and a 4-4 draw also against Hibs. Not really evidence of a negative philosophy.\n\nFurther new faces have arrived since Levein was appointed, with midfielder Ross Callachan arriving from Raith Rovers and winger David Milinkovic joining on loan from Foggia in Italy. Jordan McGhee left to sign for Falkirk.\n\nCaretaker manager Daly had been in charge for the four league games Hearts had played, with defeats at Celtic and Motherwell, a win at Kilmarnock and a draw at Rangers.\n\nThe building of the new main stand at Hearts’ home has meant every game so far has been away from home. Delays meant that they faced Aberdeen at the home of Scottish rugby, Murrayfield, where they were scheduled to play their first three home games. It was Levein’s first game in charge.\n\nIt’s a first look of the season at Aberdeen. It was just before the end of 2016 we saw them last, in a 1-0 win at Tynecastle.\n\nAberdeen will be looking to go one better in at least one competition this season after finishing runners-up to Celtic in the league and both cups last time around.\n\nA number of players have left the Dons over the summer, with the most high profile ones being Niall McGinn and Jonny Hayes, the two most responsible for unlocking opponents defences. Also going through the departure door were captain Ryan Jack, Jayden Stockley, Neil Alexander, Peter Pawlett, Ash Taylor, Cammy Smith, Aaron Lennox, Miles Storey and Lawrence Shankland.\n\nWith many of those leaving featuring regularly in the first team, there was a lot to do in the summer, but they look as if they might be even stronger this time.\n\nCentral defender Kári Árnason has returned to the club from Omonia Nicosia in Cyprus, central midfielder Greg Tansey has come in from Inverness Caley Thistle, Gary Mackay-Steven from Celtic and strikers Nicky Maynard from MK Dons and Stevie May from Preston North End.\n\nThey have made some fantastic loan signings for the season with Ryan Christie signed up for another term on loan from Celtic, centre half Dominic Ball from Rotherham United, and forward Greg Stewart from Birmingham City. Stewart did very well in Scotland previously with Dundee.\n\nSome very good signings in that lot, but potentially the most important bit of business in the summer was manager Derek McInnes turning down the manager’s job at Sunderland to stay at Pittodrie.\n\nIt certainly hasn’t taken long for the team to gel and after four games they sit top of the league, two points clear of Celtic, with a 100% record after playing Hamilton Accies, Ross County, Dundee and Partick Thistle. They also beat Hamilton in the League Cup and a trip to Motherwell in the quarter finals awaits them. They were disappointed to go out in the third qualifying round of the Europa League to Cypriots Apollon Limassol, but that may prove a blessing in their hunt for a domestic trophy.\n\nThere were 24,248 in the ground which included 7,000 Aberdeen fans.\n\nDespite the bumper crowd the cavernous stadium was less than half full, making for an odd atmosphere. I’ve seen football at Murrayfield before and while it is an impressive stadium, it wasn’t designed for football which is very apparent. It was good to get a varied selection of catering and I went for a hog roast roll, although the prices were pretty steep for those used to football ground prices.\n\nBoth sides lined up with unusual formations. Hearts went with three at the back and Randall and Grzelak as wing backs. Djoum was in defensive midfield and Gonçalves was up front on his own. Although Randall and Djoum were playing in unfamiliar positions in terms of their Hearts careers, Randall played there for Liverpool and Djoum plays there for Cameroon. Callachan debuted in midfield.\n\nAberdeen went with Rooney and May starting together up front for the first time with Wright and Christie supporting from out wide. Ball made his debut at the heart of the Dons defence.\n\nThe visitors began knocking the ball around confidently and in the second minute, McLean cleverly chipped the ball forward into the box on the left side and as McLaughlin came out, May lifted the ball over his head and it looked like Rooney had the simple task of heading the ball into the empty net, but he was put off by Berra and couldn’t get a clean header away. The Hearts defender was very fortunate, as he seemed to hold Rooney round the waist and could have had no complaints if a penalty had been awarded.\n\nSome good footwork by Randall in 4 minutes saw him skip past an Aberdeen defender and he knocked the ball in front of Walker. As he entered the Aberdeen box there was a coming together with Ball and both players went down and the Hearts fans screamed for a penalty, but it would have been very soft.\n\nCallachan had a poor looking challenge on Christie in the fifth minute, but he had slipped just before he got there. Aberdeen took a short free kick and Christie went past Djoum, but shot straight at McLaughlin from the edge of the box.\n\nCallachan was in trouble again in 6 minutes, when he caught Wright in the face with a flying arm as he went to challenge him.\n\nAberdeen’s May went down very easily when challenged by Souttar in 11 minutes who was booked by the referee, pointing round the pitch to suggest that it was for persistent fouling. Only it was Souttar’s first foul. He must have got him mixed up with Callachan.\n\nMay stepped away from Djoum and moved into the Hearts box in 13 minutes, but he was halted by a fine tackle from Callachan.\n\nHearts broke forward on the right in 21 minutes and Gonçalves knocked the ball in front of Walker on the right of the Aberdeen box. Ball leaned into him and they both went down again, but the fans appeals for a spot kick were waved away.\n\nAfter a Hearts attack was broken up in 22 minutes, Christie sprinted forward from his own half and got away from Grzelak who looked as if he tried to hold him. He got to the edge of the box on the right before he was tripped by Cowie. The Hearts midfielder a bit fortunate to escape a yellow card.\n\nChristie took the free kick himself and it was blocked as far as Ball who lashed wide under pressure from Grzelak.\n\nRandall burst up the right for Hearts in 30 minutes and Walker nipped the ball away from Logan on the edge of the box before Logan brought him down. Walker curled the free kick towards goal, but Lewis pushed his effort away.\n\nA minute later and Gonçalves latched on to a flick on and ran at the Aberdeen defence. With Callachan to his right, he decided to go himself and got away from O’Connor before seeing his low shot to the corner magnificently turned around the post by Lewis. Cowie’s corner was met by the head of Gonçalves and Lewis juggled the ball, but held on.\n\nThe game was fast and furious and Shinnie laid the ball into the path of Christie in 34 minutes on the left of the Hearts box, but he shot wide of the far post.\n\nMcLean had a shot at the Hearts goal from 25 yards in 37 minutes and it took a deflection and spun not too far wide of the post.\n\nRandall was starting to make inroads on the right for Hearts and another run forward saw him pick out Walker on the edge of the box in 39 minutes. He curled a smart effort for the top corner, but Lewis dived to tip the ball over the bar. Another great save.\n\nIn 41 minutes, Gonçalves showed great skill to get away from two Aberdeen defenders and he ran all the way into the Hearts box where he should have played the ball into the path of the unmarked Callachan, but he took too long on the ball and was eventually tackled.\n\nWright received the ball on the left for Aberdeen a minute before the break and swung a deep cross to Logan, who cleverly chested the ball away from Cowie, but McLaughlin blocked his shot with his foot.\n\nGoalless at the break and Aberdeen had bossed the opening 30 minutes before Hearts came roaring back into the game. The Dons looked as though they should have had a penalty in the opening minutes, but Lewis had prevented them from going behind with two fine saves.\n\nHearts won a corner in 47 minutes and Cowie’s cross was headed on by Callachan and it came to Berra, who saw his volley headed off the line.\n\nBerra crossed into the Aberdeen box from the left in 55 minutes and Gonçalves perfectly chested the ball into the path of Callachan who took a great first touch before hammering at goal, but Lewis was there again to make another fantastic save.\n\nA minute later and Souttar teed up Walker on the edge of the Dons box, but you’ve guessed it, Lewis saved the curling effort, pushing the ball behind.\n\nMcLean had a go at the Hearts goal in 61 minutes after being set up by Wright, but his shot from 22 yards was comfortable for McLaughlin.\n\nWalker stole the ball for Hearts on the half way line in 63 minutes and passed inside to Gonçalves. He ran at the defence and shot from the edge of the box. This time a shot finally beat Lewis, but it smacked off the underside of the bar and the defence managed to clear.\n\nWith 68 minutes gone Wright attempted a one-two with Shinnie as he approached the Hearts box. Grzelak got a foot in, but the ball went back to Wright whose low shot from the edge of the box was saved by McLaughlin.\n\nBack up the other end a minute later and Walker created space for himself after exchanging passes with Callachan before seeing his shot come off the arm of O’Connor on the edge of the box and spinning wide of the goal. Cowie’s corner was headed over by Lafferty.\n\nHearts’ Walker was booked in 73 minutes for a foul on Shinnie.\n\nA fine passing move by Hearts in 80 minutes ended with Callachan picking out Lafferty in the box, but rather than shooting first time, he took a touch, which allowed Logan to get back and send the ball behind.\n\nHearts continued to press but McLean won Aberdeen a free kick 22 yards from goal with two minutes left. McLean took the kick, but his shot hit the wall.\n\nSo no goals but a much improved performance from Hearts. Aberdeen would be disappointed they didn’t hit the heights they have in recent times and despite starting well, they were under pressure for most of the second half. Lewis prevented the home side from taking all three points.\n\nHughes was excellent at the back for Hearts and Callachan had a good debut in midfield. Gonçalves caused problems running at the Aberdeen defence and was unlucky not to score, although a couple of times he should have passed to a team mate in a better position.\n\nFor Aberdeen, Wright started off very well on the left but faded, Ball was solid at the back on his first start and Christie showed some good ability.\n\nA very decent nil-nil game of which there are few.\n\nFull Time: Heart of Midlothian 0 Aberdeen 0\n\nAdmission: £15 (Price when bought through season ticket holder)\n\nHearts: 1 Jon McLaughlin, 4 John Souttar, 5 Aaron Hughes, 6 Christophe Berra, 16 Connor Randall, 15 Don Cowie, 20 Ross Callachan, 7 Jamie Walker (Milinkovic 77), 27 Rafal Grzelak, 10 Arnaud Sutchuin-Djoum, 77 Esmael Gonçalves (Lafferty 65).

They’ve already lifted the first trophy of the 2017 season when they retained the Premier League Cup.\n\nHibs stood top of the Scottish Women’s Premier League after 11 games with ten wins and one defeat. Champions Glasgow City had nine wins and two draws and were right behind the women from the Capital.\n\nThey had just returned from playing games in the Champions League Qualifying Group in Romania, where they were unfortunate not to go through after they were unbeaten in their three games. Having already won 11-0 at SWPL2 side Motherwell in the previous round, they were favourites to progress again.\n\nIt was our first viewing of Celtic Ladies since their quarter final tie in the Scottish Cup against the same opponents last season.\n\nCeltic had played 12 league games and had won and lost five, with two draws. They sat fifth in the SWPL1 table, thirteen points behind Hibs. They were the losing finalists in the Premier League Cup.\n\nLast season, Celtic finished in third place in the league.\n\nCeltic won 5-0 at SWPL2 side East Fife in the previous round.\n\nThere were around 90 in the ground at the start, but this was boosted as the game progressed by several of the players from different pitches coming to watch once their game had finished.\n\nIt was odd to see neither team in their first choice strips, with Hibs in all black and Celtic in a kind of headache green colour.\n\nCeltic started confidently and were knocking the ball about well in the opening minutes. They forced a couple of corners which came to nothing.\n\nWith 5 minutes gone, Ewens crossed into the Hibs box from the right and Mulvey tried a volley, but it came off her ankle and ran through to Fife in the Hibs goal.\n\nA cross into the Celtic box in 8 minutes eluded everyone in the middle and came to Murray on the left. She lifted the ball into the box where Harrison’s powerful header saw Cunningham get fingertips to it, but the ball bounced down off the bar over the line. Graham dived in to head into the net just to be sure.\n\nDespite Celtic’s promising start it was Hibs who took the early lead.\n\nEwens showed some good skill on the right for Celtic in 18 minutes, but her cross was too close to Fife.\n\nUp the other end a minute later Robertson passed to Harrison on the left. She put a great ball across goal which was just out of reach of two team mates in the middle.\n\nHarrison was pulled down on the edge of the Celtic box by Ross in 20 minutes. Murray stepped up and fired the free kick into the corner of the net past the despairing dive of Cunningham to double Hibs’ lead.\n\nA Celtic corner taken by Rafferty in 26 minutes came to McCulloch at the back post and Fife did well to turn her shot over the bar.\n\nHibs came forward quickly in 28 minutes with Brownlie playing a fine ball down the left to Smith. Her cross into the middle was punched clear by Cunningham.\n\nA great run by Gallacher in 32 minutes saw her go past three Celtic defenders before she was eventually tackled in the box.\n\nRobertson floated in a free kick from the half way line in 35 minutes which Murray headed into the middle of the Celtic box. A Celtic defender managed to head the ball behind.\n\nSoon after, Harrison had a shot at the Celtic goal from the edge of the box, but there wasn’t sufficient power in it to trouble Cunningham.\n\nHarrison picked out Small in the centre of the Celtic box in 40 minutes, but she was foiled by a good save by Cunningham, who turned the ball behind. From the corner, Gallacher’s cross was met by Murray’s downward header, which looped over Cunningham for her second and Hibs’ third.\n\nMichie put a free kick into the Celtic area in 43 minutes and the ball was bouncing around before it came to Harrison who thumped a shot against the bar.\n\nWith a minute to go before the break, Robertson’s tackle on McCulloch on the half way line sent the ball towards the Celtic goal and Harrison was onto the ball in a flash. She ran clear of the defence and slotted past Cunningham for her double and Hibs’ fourth of the afternoon.\n\nThe hosts four up at the break and they had improved as the half wore on. Celtic had some good periods of possession and a couple of decent chances, but Hibs were clinical.\n\nHibs replaced Michie at half time with Small moving to right back to allow Cornet to take her place in midfield.\n\nWith the second half three minutes old, Harrison took the ball down the left and her cross saw Robertson throw herself at the ball to send a header into the bottom corner to make it 5-0.\n\nHarrison received the ball on the edge of the Celtic box in 53 minutes, but was forced wide. She managed to get the ball across the face of the goal, but there were no takers.\n\nCeltic’s Ross picked up the game’s first booking in 54 minutes.\n\nNot long after Hibs made a couple of further substitutions, Celtic did it en masse, with five subs coming on all at once.\n\nThere was a scramble in the Hibs box in 62 minutes, but Fife eventually smothered the ball.\n\nHowat chased the ball to the Hibs by-line in 67 minutes and lobbed the ball into the middle. It almost went in at the far post, but there was nobody there to supply the finishing touch.\n\nA pass back by Littlejohn in 70 minutes was a little short and Cunningham hit the ball against Tweedie, who had charged the ball down, but it went wide of goal.\n\nSome decent build up play by Celtic in 72 minutes ended with Ewens shooting for goal, but a defender headed the ball behind.\n\nCeltic were starting to put a bit of pressure on but it was Hibs who had the next opportunity. Some intricate build up play in 76 minutes led to Tweedie squaring the ball to Harrison on the edge of the box, but her shot didn’t have the power to beat Cunningham.\n\nHowat’s corner in 79 minutes was brought down well by Littlejohn in the Hibs box, but she shot wide of the target.\n\nIn 86 minutes Howat crossed from the right and the ball came off the face of the Hibs bar, before the defence got the ball away.\n\nIn injury time Ross had a strike at the Hibs goal from 22 yards, but Fife pushed the ball away.\n\nA convincing win by Hibs who were always a threat and looked a very solid side. Celtic started and ended the game well and were unlucky not to score at least one goal. They really kicked on after their multiple substitutions, although Hibs knew the game was won by then.\n\nBest for Hibs were Murray, Smith, Robertson and Harrison. For Celtic Ross, Ewens and Hayley Cunningham stood out.\n\nHibs would go on to play Glasgow Girls in the quarter final.\n\nFull Time: Hibs Ladies 5 Celtic 0\n\nAdmission: £3\n\nHibernian: 1 Jenna Fife, 8 Cailin Michie (Cornet 46), 17 Joelle Murray, 24 Emma Brownlie, 11 Kirsty Smith (Leishman 57), 23 Rachel Small, 6 Lisa Robertson, 13 Lucy Graham (Notely 73), 15 Amy Gallacher, 18 Katey Turner (Tweedie 57), 21 Abi Harrison.

It’s one of the biggest pitches in Scottish football and has a large newly recovered terracing down one side of the pitch. A strange looking building houses the dressing rooms on the other side and there is a structure behind one goal which houses the refreshments area and bar. It has everything you’d want from a junior ground and is a good place to watch football.\n\nA Pumpherston football team was originally formed in 1896 although the first junior team were likely Pumpherston Rob Roy, who were around at the beginning of the 1900s.\n\nPumpherston Rangers emerged to join the Linlithgowshire Junior League for the 1911-12 season. They had great success, winning seven trophies before the First World War intervened. Although they quickly won another cup when football returned, they decided to turn amateur in 1928.\n\nPumpherston Juniors began in the Edinburgh & District League for season 1954-55. Against all the odds, they reached the Scottish Junior Cup Final in 1958 where they lost out to Shotts Bon Accord.\n\nThey continued to challenge for honours and had a number of hard luck stories before a precarious financial position led to them folding in the middle of season 1976-77.\n\nThe club was re-formed and joined Division 2 of the East Region in 1990–91. League reconstruction saw them go into the First Division in 2002, but they were relegated straight away. A second place finish in 2004 saw them back in the First again, but they were relegated again in 2006, which saw them drop into the new South League. A runners-up spot in 2012-13 saw them promoted, but they fell back again the following season.\n\nThey just missed out on promotion to the East Premier Division last season with a third placed finish. Manager Craig Martin will be hoping his team can go one better this season.\n\nPumpherston have made a lot of signings for the new season. From Tynecastle Under 20s they’ve enlisted defenders Ross Kneebone and Adam Forrest, midfielder Greg Sneddon and winger Ciaron Small. Midfielders Jack Beaumont and Darren Carroll have signed from Linlithgow Rose and Crossgates Primrose respectively, Laurie Devine – a forward- has come in from Livingston along with forward Kyle Sampson and midfielder Jack Ogilvie signed on loan from the same club. They’ve also procured forward Joe Brady from Stoneyburn, defender Colin Pace from Broxburn Afc, defender Marcus Millar from Broxburn Athletic and forward Liam Magee from Broxburn u19s. Finally, goalkeeper Connor Muir has joined from Edinburgh Amateurs.\n\nIn the league this season, they lost 2-1 on the opening day at home to West Calder United, but won their next three – 5-0 at home to Livingston United, 2-1 at Harthill Royal and incredibly, 11-1 at Kirkcaldy YM.\n\nEdinburgh United were formed in 1985 and are also currently in the SJFA East Region South Division. They play their home games in the Colinton area of the city at Paties Road Recreation Ground.\n\nFor the majority of their existence they have been the only Junior side in Edinburgh, although Craigroyston joined them in 2016.\n\nUnited won the East Region Division 2 title in their first season and went on to win three cups in the ‘80s. They won the South Division title in 2013-14, but were relegated back to it in 2015-16. Last season saw them finish seventh in the 14 team league.\n\nThey have got off to a great start ihe league this season with four wins out of four. They’ve won 3-0 at Oakley, 3-1 at Easthouses Lily, 6-0 at home to Kirkcaldy YM and 3-1 at home to Stoneyburn.\n\nManager John O’Hara has his first full season in charge after taking over in mber 2016 from former Hearts striker Calum Elliot. For the season ahead United have signed defender Jim Young and keeper Jamie Newman from Newtongrange Star, midfielders Eddie Mearns from Lothian Hutchison Vale, and Sean Conaghan from Hawick Royal Albert, left back Daniel McAleavey from Peebles Rovers, and strikers Daniel Garvey from from Leith U21’s and Paul Murray.\n\nSo the teams sitting in third and first faced off in the East of Scotland Cup. I was impressed to see that Pumpherston had produced a programme for the day.\n\nThere were around 75 at the game.\n\nIn the opening minute, a long ball forward saw McRitchie run between two United defenders, but his attempted lob from 20 yards went over the bar.\n\nHastings went up for a header in 2 minutes and went over the top of a United player, landed badly and seemed to be out cold. He came to about a minute later and I was surprised that he stayed on the pitch after being unconscious.\n\nMcAleavey swung a ball into the Pumpherston box in 6 minutes from the left and Shaw considered coming for it, but it went all the way to the back post where Hendry nodded into the net to give the visitors the lead.\n\nWith 12 minutes gone, Millar passed the ball to the feet of Nicholson in the United box. He played it back to Carroll whose shot was destined for the bottom corner until Newman dived full length to turn it around the post. Beaumont’s corner saw Millar get a touch, but Newman smothered.\n\nPumpherston’s Forrest was shown a yellow card in 14 minutes for dissent.\n\nCarroll crossed from the right in 15 minutes and picked out Sampson free in the United box, but he headed over the bar.\n\nAuriemma intercepted a Pumpherston pass in 21 minutes and played the ball wide for Hendry. He cut inside and tried to curl the ball over Shaw, but it was off target.\n\nSome lovely football by United in 22 minutes led to McKinley putting Hendry through on goal. Shaw came out of his goal and blocked at his feet, but the ball spun to Conaghan who went down under the challenge of Derek Shaw. Penalty.\n\nConaghan stepped up and saw his shot to the bottom corner pushed away by Shaw, diving to his right.\n\nFrom the corner, Hastings seemed to have two hands on the back of a United player to ease him off the ball, but the referee wasn’t interested in a second penalty.\n\nA loose header by United’s Johnston in 25 minutes saw McRitchie through on the right hand side of the box. He hammered wide of the far post, much to the annoyance of his team mates who let him know that he had to score those kind of chances.\n\nUnited came forward again in 26 minutes and Hendry passed to McKinley on the right. He cut inside away from Millar but shot over the bar.\n\nA clever ball into the Pumpherston box by Hendry in 27 minutes sent McKinley through again, but Shaw was out quickly to get the ball away.\n\nA long ball forward by Hastings in 28 minutes picked out McRitchie in the United box and he took a touch first time which took him past Newman and he and Richardson chased the ball into the box with the striker going down and the referee awarding a penalty. Richardson was booked.\n\nMcRitchie took the kick himself and Newman went the right way, but couldn’t stop it. 1-1.\n\nThe referee had words with the home bench in 30 minutes about something which had been said.\n\nAuriemma picked out Hendry on the right of the Pumpherston box in 33 minutes, but he shot wide.\n\nThere were winces all round in 35 minutes as United’s Johnston was caught by the ball in a particularly tender area.\n\nA Pumpherston free kick in 36 minutes was put into the box by Beaumont and Hastings went up for the header, but put it straight at Newman.\n\nMcRitchie broke down the right for Pumpherston in 37 minutes and looked for Sampson in the middle, but it was just too far in front of him.\n\nA misplaced header by United’s McAleavey in 38 minutes presented the ball to McRitchie, but his attempted curler from the corner of the box was well wide.\n\nJohnstone was yellow carded in 39 minutes. He hadn’t made contact, but it was the second time he had dived in and narrowly missed an opponent.\n\nIn 40 minutes, a Hendry flick on sent McKinley running into the Pumpherston box. He was tackled, but the ball came to Conaghan who saw his shot blocked by the keeper.\n\nWith two minutes to the break Nicholson sent a pass through the legs of a United player to Derek Shaw on the right. He was in acres of space and had time to pick out a cross and he floated it to the far post where McRitchie rose to head home.\n\nTwo-one to the home side at the interval and that had looked unlikely for much of the first half. United started better and when they were awarded their penalty it looked like they would have a comfortable afternoon. Pumpherston came more into the game as the half developed, but it was still a surprise they were not behind, never mind in front.\n\nA fine run by United’s Auriemma in the opening minute of the second half saw him feed the ball to McKinley on the right hand side of the box, but the referee called play back for a foul on Auriemma when advantage would have suited them better.\n\nHendrie swung over a United corner in 49 minutes and Richardson got his head to it, but it was wide of the goal.\n\nNicholson was stopped in his tracks by a Richardson challenge in 53 minutes, giving Pumpherston a free kick about 22 yards out. Carroll took it and put it right in the top corner for the home side’s third of the afternoon. It was a fine strike, but seemed to go in at the side the wall was supposed to be covering.\n\nIn 56 minutes McKinley’s cross into the Pumpherston box came all the way to Auriemma on the other side. He lifted the ball into the area and Hendry tried an overhead kick which Shaw was forced to push behind. The corner came to the head of Richardson, but Shaw blocked again.\n\nPumpherston broke forward in 60 minutes with a long ball out of defence and Sampson was fouled by McKinley as he went down the left. The United player was booked. Although the referee had been well behind play, it looked the right decision.\n\nShaw had a lucky escape in the Pumpherston goal in 64 minutes when he took too long with the ball at his feet and was closed down. He managed to kick it against a United player for a goal kick.\n\nPumpherston’s Carroll was shown the yellow card in 67 minutes for a foul on Grieve.\n\nSampson burst into the United box on the left in 71 minutes, but his cutback was cleared by Richardson.\n\nA long throw-in by Carroll into the United box in 72 minutes saw keeper Newman shouting for the ball, but Richardson ignored the shouts of his goalie and headed the ball away to the edge of the box. It went straight to the head of McRitchie who sent a clever looping header over both and into the net to put the hosts three in front.\n\nUnited’s Johnston and Pumpherston’s McRitchie had a bit of a push at each other in 75 minutes. The referee made do with a warning for both.\n\nHendry almost picked out Subasic in the middle of the Pumpherston box in 77 minutes, but the ball ended up running through to Shaw.\n\nWith two minutes to go Carroll strode forward and had a go at the United goal from 30 yards, but it drifted wide.\n\nIn injury time Carroll played the ball wide to number 15 who crossed into the United box for Derek Shaw, but he headed over the bar.\n\nA convincing win in the end for Pumpherston who improved considerably in the second half. United would have regretted not making the most of their first half dominance.\n\nI felt a bit sorry for the referee, who was operating without linesmen. Players and fans of both sides shouted for offside at pretty much every forward pass and he got a lot of abuse for some of the decisions he made. It certainly wouldn’t be easy to tell in most cases.\n\nHastings had a fine game at the back for Pumpherston and was very competitive, although he probably should have gone off after his second minute head knock. Beaumont had some nice touches and took nearly every dead ball situation for the hosts. McRitchie deserves a mention for his hat-trick.\n\nFor Edinburgh, McKinley showed some good control and has very quick feet, Hendry was very prominent and Auriemma looked like he could cause problems.\n\nI don’t have the numbers of the Pumpherston subs, but the ones who did come on were Magee, McLaren and Sneddon.\n\nAn entertaining game.\n\nFull Time: Pumpherston Juniors 4 Edinburgh United 1\n\nAdmission: £5\n\nPumpherston Juniors: 1 Connor Shaw, 2 Derek Shaw, 3 Marcus Millar, 4 Neil Hastings, 5 Adam Forrest, 6 Darren Carroll, 7 Barry Nicholson (15 66), 8 Jack Beaumont, 9 Ally McRitchie, 10 Kyle Sampson (17 77), 11 Nik Rendall (16 83).

Since returning from the mid-season break, they have lost 3-1 at league leaders Forfar Farmington and drew 1-1 at home to bottom side East Fife.\n\nThey finished in fourth spot last season, but the league seems to get tougher every year and there are a number of good sides in SWPL2 this time around.\n\nWe last saw Vale in the same fixture in May, when they triumphed by a goal to nil.\n\nHearts are hanging onto fourth spot despite a poor run of results. Defeats to top of the league Forfar and second placed Motherwell were followed by a break from the league in their last game, but that was in the cup against SWPL1 perennial champions Glasgow City, so it certainly hadn’t got any easier and despite a gallant showing, it was another defeat.\n\nThe games between the teams are always tight, close affairs and we weren’t expecting anything different from usual.\n\nAround 60 went along to watch the Edinburgh derby.\n\nVale had the first shot at goal, after 3 minutes, when Sturrock’s shot from 22 yards was held by Watson.\n\nBrown crossed from the right in 6 minutes and the ball came to Forker on the edge of the Hearts box, but her shot at goal was too high.\n\nA good ball into the path of Brown by McLeod in 15 minutes sent her running into the Hearts box, but Watson was out quickly to claim.\n\nIn 17 minutes, Sturrock played a forward pass for Hume and she ran to the edge of the Hearts box before expertly lobbing the outrushing Watson to give the hosts the lead.\n\nVale continued to make the running and Sturrock passed to Murray in 27 minutes who struck for goal from 25 yards, but it drifted wide.\n\nMcLeod played the ball to Craig on the left in 38 minutes as Vale came forward again. She played it inside to Hume in the box, but Moultray managed to get a foot to her shot to turn it behind.\n\nHearts created their first real chance in 40 minutes when Smith found Carse on the left. Her ball into the box was dummied by Hutchison and Kidd’s shot for goal was blocked by the foot of Lessells.\n\nA commanding first half performance by Vale. They didn’t create too many clear cut chances but had all the pressure and were well on top. Hearts were struggling to create anything, with Carse too often isolated up front. With Kidd and Dodds playing on the wings, they were too far away from Carse to support her and she often was the only outlet and was forced to run with the ball. Although this is her forte with her good close control, she was invariably crowded out.\n\nIt wasn’t a surprise that Hearts changed to two up front at the break.\n\nA fine run forward by McLeod in 47 minutes saw her strike for goal from the edge of the Hearts box, but it was too close to Watson.\n\nHearts were more in the game as the second half developed, but neither side was able to create as both sides fought for possession.\n\nA Kidd cross into the Vale box in 71 minutes was missed by Lessells, but Forker was able to get the ball clear.\n\nMcLeod took the ball along the edge of the Hearts box in 73 minutes and squared it to Forker, but her low shot was wide of the target.\n\nA minute later and Brown got to the Hearts by-line and cut the ball back for Hume, but her shot was blocked.\n\nVale’s Murray was booked in 77 minutes.\n\nIn 81 minutes Aitchison found Carse on the left and she put the ball across the face of the Vale goal but there were no takers and the ball was cleared.\n\nWith a minute left, Stewart chased the ball forward and tried a clever lob which went narrowly over, although it did get a nick on the way.\n\nAs Hearts tried to put the pressure on to grab an equaliser Carse had a shot at goal in injury time, but Lessells saved comfortably.\n\nA good win for Vale who couldn’t replicate their first half dominance in the second period, but held on for the win. The second half was much more even, but they did enough in the first 45 minutes to merit the three points.\n\nHearts did improve, partly due to the manager’s changes, but couldn’t get on top as they pressed for a leveller.\n\nWith defences on top it was hard to pick out others, but Sturrock showed some real quality for Vale with Shepherd and Hume also impressing. Hutchison, Carse and Smith were best for Hearts.\n\nFull Time: Edinburgh University Hutchison Vale 1 Hearts Ladies 0\n\nAdmission: £3\n\nEdinburgh University Hutchison Vale: 1 Charlene Lessells, 2 Nicole Clark, 6 Fiona Boslem, 4 Jude Shepherd, 5 Hannah Craig, 14 Lucy Brown, 10 Nichola Sturrock, 11 Leanne Forker, 7 Anna Murray (Haines 82), 8 Anna Hume, 9 Beth McLeod.

It was a difficult time for “the Panners” and they lost their Lowland League status at the end of last season after finishing in bottom spot.\n\nThey parted company with manager Craig Nisbet in April and replaced him with co-managers Jack Lynch and Paul Riley. Preston were already certain to finish bottom when the two arrived.\n\nThey are still reshaping the squad and two trialists started the match with a further one on the bench. They originally had another trialist listed as number 8, but he was replaced by Woodcock before the start.\n\nPreston began their league season with a 2-0 defeat at Leith Athletic, before bouncing back with a 3-2 win at home to Tweedmouth Rangers.\n\nIt was May 2016 when we last saw Peebles Rovers. Founded in 1893, Peebles were actually members of the Scottish Football League between 1923 and 1926 and have competed in the Scottish Cup on many occasions. Their first Scottish Cup tie was against Celtic in 1907, but their best result in the competition was in 1923, when they held Hibs to a 0-0 draw at Easter Road. Their last appearance was in season 1965-66 when they went out in a replay to Dumbarton.\n\nThey moved from their original home at Victoria Park to Whitestone Park in 1937, where they still play home games to this day. Those facilities would put paid to their Scottish Cup appearances, as they became only Associate members of the Scottish Football Association due to the inadequacy of them. This meant that they were no longer eligible to compete in the Qualifying Cup and Scottish Cup.\n\nRovers joined the junior grade of Scottish football in 1966–67 and had little success. They rejoined the seniors and the East of Scotland League in 1980-81. League reorganisation at the end of that decade placed them in the second of two divisions, named the East of Scotland First Division.\n\nSince that time, they have won promotion on several occasions, but their stays in the East of Scotland Premier Divisionwere short. Peebles became a yo-yo club for many years, but season 2012-13 saw them struggling at the bottom of the second tier of the East of Scotland leagues. A new manager, John O’Hara arrived and two years later led the team to a league and cup double. O’Hara’s success was spotted by Newtongrange Star who snapped him up in 2016.\n\nFormer player Ger Rossi took over and he is seeking to get as many locals into the team as possible.\n\nPeebles are preparing for another season in the East of Scotland League, which is now back to one division again. Although they have won the title six times, the last East of Scotland win was in 1946. Last season saw them finish eighth in the twelve-team league.\n\nRovers started the league campaign with a 3-1 win at Ormiston. This was their second game.\n\nDespite multiple tweets to Peebles Rovers, I have been unable to get confirmation of their team numbers, so apologies if any are inaccurate.\n\nMcMath had the game’s first shot in 3 minutes, from the edge of the Preston box, but it was a comfortable save for Inglis.\n\nGregor Lamb was next to have a go, his effort from 25 yards going narrowly wide of the Preston goal.\n\nPreston struggled to clear a Peebles corner in 9 minutes and the ball eventually came to Gregor Lamb, but he shot over.\n\nA poor pass back by Rovers’ Fleming in 10 minutes forced McGinley to concede a corner. Cochrane took the kick and found Jardine, but he didn’t make good contact and McGinley gathered.\n\nPreston’s trialist number 5 received a yellow card in 11 minutes for a late tackle.\n\nCochrane made a good run in 13 minutes which got him to the Rovers by-line and his ball across goal picked out Young. He struck for goal first time, but McGinley made a good reaction save.\n\nA long ball forward by Preston in 16 minutes came to Cochrane on the right. Jardine was free in the middle, but the cross was deflected. Jardine got possession and went down in the box as he was challenged. There were penalty appeals but nothing was given.\n\nRovers had a couple of long range efforts with Rossi’s effort going out for a throw in and then Gregor Lamb having a go, but his shot was also wide.\n\nPreston’s number 5 trialist miskicked on half way in 21 minutes and as he tried to recover he booted McMath in the face. It wasn’t deliberate, but it certainly looked a sore one.\n\nAn Innes corner in 25 minutes went right across the Rovers 6-yard box, but nobody got a touch.\n\nWoodcock hit a powerful shot at the Rovers goal from 25 yards in 26 minutes, and McGinley had to parry before catching.\n\nIn 31 minutes, Zavaroni played the ball through to McMath in the Preston box. Inglis blocked his effort and the rebound came to Lindsay who saw his effort cleared off the line before Inglis dived on the ball.\n\nRoss Lamb had a strike at the Preston goal from distance in 33 minutes, but it was too high.\n\nA lovely ball from Rossi found McMath through on goal in 34 minutes, but Preston keeper Inglis blocked again. Preston’s trialist number 5, who was chasing McMath as he ran into the box, was forced to limp off in 35 minutes after appearing to pull a hamstring.\n\nRoss Lamb put a dangerous ball across the face of the Preston goal in 38 minutes, but McGinley managed to get a touch to push it away from danger.\n\nSmith became the first Rovers player yellow carded in 40 minutes for pulling back Young.\n\nA Peebles free kick in 42 minutes was put into the box by Ross Lamb and found Lindsay, but his side footed effort had no power.\n\nYoung latched onto a pass from McFarlane in 44 minutes and hit a half volley at the Rovers goal, but Inglis dived to pushed the ball away.\n\nJust before the break Innes passed through the Rovers defence and sprung the offside trap. Woodcock ran in from the right before squaring the ball for Stevenson who tapped into the net for the opening goal.\n\nRovers would have been disappointed not to have led at the break and yet they went in a goal behind. They had passed up several clear cut chances in a half which they had the better of.\n\nIn the second minute of the second half, Cochrane took a Preston corner which went over the head of McGinley and Liddle got his head to the ball, but it went over the bar.\n\nWoodcock took a Preston free kick from the right in 58 minutes and McFarlane rose to head powerfully into the net from close range to double the lead.\n\nLindsay was booked for a late tackle on a Preston player in 61 minutes.\n\nA Preston free kick in 62 minutes Woodcock’s cross come to Jardine, but his shot hit a defender and spun wide.\n\nMcMath ran into the Preston box in 63 minutes, but Woodcock got back to block the ball behind.\n\nJardine received a throw in inside the Rovers box in 67 minutes, but his shot was deflected over.\n\nA great turn on the edge of the Rovers box by Young in 68 minutes got him away from a defender, but McGinley blocked his shot as the flag went up for offside.\n\nPreston’s Jardine was forced to come off in 71 minutes after injury.\n\nZavaroni passed to Mackay on the right in 74 minutes and his cross was tipped over the bar by Inglis in the home goal.\n\nPreston came forward in 76 minutes and Binnie played the ball into the path of Young who shot first time, but McGinley got down to turn the ball behind.\n\nMcMath was through on the Preston goal after a pass by Ross Lamb in 77 minutes, but Woodcock got back to get a tackle in.\n\nRovers’ Ross Lamb was booked in 81 minutes for kicking out at a Preston player. Fleming joined him in the book in 85 minutes, before Preston’s Stevenson was also carded a minute later.\n\nWith two minutes left, Rovers were through on goal, but Stevenson managed to head McMath’s shot off the line.\n\nA frustrating afternoon for Peebles who really should have taken something from the game, which they seemed to be in control of for spells. Preston took their chances when they needed to and would have been delighted with the result.\n\nInglis had a great game in goals for the hosts and Woodcock gave a fine performance in midfield, with Cochrane causing problems on the wing. For Rovers, Mackay performed well at right back and Rossi showed some good passing.\n\nFull Time: Preston Athletic 2 Peebles Rovers 0\n\nAdmission: £5\n\nPreston Athletic: 1 Sinclair Inglis, 2 Michael McFarlane, 3 Craig Innes, 4 David Liddle, 5 Trialist (Stevenson 35), 6 Shaun Conway (D Pennycuick 79), 7 Jay Cochrane, 8 Macauley Woodcock, 9 Jason Young, 10 Jack Jardine (Binnie 71), 11 Trialist.

Finn Daniels-Yeoman, who is always prominent in midfield, would be a big loss.\n\nSince their game in Innerleithen, they have lost 4-1 at BSC Glasgow, 5-0 against Strollers themselves in the Qualifying Cup, before picking up their first win, 2-1 at home to Whitehill Welfare. With 3 points from their opening four league games, they would have been looking to add points to the board as quickly as possible.\n\nThe last time we saw Strollers they were holding title winning East Kilbride to a draw in March, and delaying them being crowned champions. They finished last season in twelfth spot, 21 points and four places off the bottom.\n\nLeft back Kyle Fee and striker James Hainey have joined Strollers from Leith Athletic along with midfielder Ross Nisbet, defender Jack Verth and forward Kyle Boggie from Craigroyston. Midfielder Andy Mair has also joined from Spartans.\n\nJordan Finnie, Scott Ritchie, Michael Lee, Mark Torrance and Joe Dingwall have all departed in the close season\n\nStrollers began their league campaign with a 2-0 win at Gretna 2008, before losing 2-1 at home to Spartans in the North Edinburgh derby. They then went down 4-2 at home to University of Stirling and then had that 5-0 win in the cup. A 2-2 draw at East Stirlingshire means they are a point better off than Edinburgh Uni after their four league games.\n\nI’m pleased to report that the legendary Edinburgh Uni cake maker was on duty.\n\nThere were around 70 in attendance, including Selkirk management team Ian Fergus and David Bingham.\n\nA terrible pass back by Uni’s Verkaik in the fourth minute saw Churchill through on goal, but as he delayed, Sutherland got across to block his shot.\n\nA mistake by Strollers’ Ballantyne in 6 minutes gave possession to Evans and he sprinted towards the box. He was held up by a defender and Ballantyne recovered to win the ball back.\n\nClapperton struck for goal from 20 yards in 8 minutes and Uni keeper Tait tipped the ball over the bar. The resultant corner was played to the edge of the box where a mishit shot fell to the feet of Verth who poked the ball into the net, but the flag was up.\n\nA nice one-two between Strollers’ Mair and Churchill in 12 minutes saw the former get to the by-line on the left. Murray blocked his cross behind. From the corner, Downie’s delivery found the head of Verth, but he put it over the bar.\n\nIn 14 minutes, the ball came to Stewart on the Uni by-line, who looked offside, but he pulled the ball back to Cunningham on the edge of the box and his drive at goal was saved by the foot of Tait.\n\nA Uni long throw in 16 minutes was flicked to the back post and came to the feet of Murray. He had acres of space but lashed over the bar.\n\nVerkaik was forced to go off in 17 minutes. The Uni player suffering from concussion.\n\nStrollers’ Churchill got past Sutherland on the left in 20 minutes and played the ball across goal for Stewart, but under challenge, he was unable to make contact.\n\nA cross into the Uni box in 22 minutes was partly cleared by Ritchie and Clapperton fired back towards goal, but it was off target.\n\nUni sent a ball into the Strollers box in 31 minutes from the right. Boyle took possession in the box and may have been caught by Burnside, but the ball went behind and the referee gave a corner. McNicholas took it and picked out Ritchie who was free in the box, but headed well over.\n\nIn 34 minutes, Stewart passed to Downie on the right. He struck a terrific shot for goal from 25 yards and Tait got his fingertips to it, although it may have been going just wide anyway.\n\nWith four minutes to the break, Evans passed the ball through to Boyle in the Strollers box and he took a touch before shooting, but Burnside managed to push the ball away.\n\nStalemate at half time in a game that was short on quality, with Strollers looking the slightly more likely.\n\nWith 49 minutes gone Mair tried a chip from 22 yards which wasn’t too far over the Uni bar.\n\nUni’s Ritchie and Strollers Ballantyne clashed heads in 58 minutes, but both were ok to continue.\n\nBallantyne played a good crossfield ball to Mair in 63 minutes as Strollers came forward. He passed to Downie in the box, but his first time effort was sliced wide.\n\nStrollers’ Verth was booked in 68 minutes for bringing down Evans. A shout, which seemed to come from the area of the Strollers’ bench stated that “number 10, you’re a shitebag.” Gair floated the free kick into the box and Burnside was unable to hold it, but the ball went behind for a fruitless corner.\n\nVerth struck a low shot at the Uni goal from around 25 yards in 71 minutes which didn’t seem too far wide.\n\nFroude was next to have a shot at the Uni goal, this time from the edge of the box, but Tait pushed the ball away.\n\nA small cheer went up in 75 minutes as the linesman got the ball in the stomach which made him double over.\n\nIn 76 minutes, Verth was shown his second yellow card for a challenge on Evans. It looked as if he may have got at least some of the ball from where I was, but off he went.\n\nMurray managed to get the ball back from the by-line in 80 minutes to McNicholas whose shot was deflected wide of the Strollers goal.\n\nIt was noticeable that the referee was enthusiastically blowing his whistle for everything, throw-ins, offsides etc. He was perhaps trying to make things more dramatic, or just making sure the crowd was still awake\n\nGood closing down by Froude in 83 minutes saw him get a foot on Uni keeper Tait’s attempted clearance and he chased the ball and played it to Mair, but his shot was well wide.\n\nMcNicholas ran at the Strollers defence in 86 minutes and made some space at the edge of the box, but got no power in his shot and it was an easy save for Tait.\n\nUni’s Ritchie was booked in 88 minutes for persistent fouling.\n\nIn injury time Downie found Stewart in the Uni box, but his low drive was blocked by Tait.\n\nNo goals at the final whistle in a game which never really got going. Both sides put in a lot of effort but misplaced passes were the order of the day. Strollers seemed to improve after they went down to ten men in the second half and almost snatched it, but neither side really deserved to win.\n\nStrollers defence looked solid with Laird performing particularly well. Mair showed some good touches going forward. For Uni, McNicholas showed some good control and Ritchie was competitive in midfield.\n\nA game unlikely to live long in the memory.\n\nFull Time: Edinburgh University 0 Civil Service Strollers 0\n\nAdmission: £6\n\nEdinburgh University: 1 Mark Tait, 2 Luke Murray, 3 Max Condie, 4 Max Verkaik (Flett 17), 5 Paul Sutherland, 6 Mark Gair, 7 Greg Swann, 8 Ewan Ritchie, 9 Joe Boyle, 10 Nathan Evans, 11 Stuart McNicholas.

After losing to league leaders Forfar Farmington the following week, their chances of sealing the single promotion spot to the Women’s Premier League 1 are looking very slim.\n\nIn what was already going to be a very difficult cup tie for Hearts manager Andy Enwood, Hearts were missing several first team players and 6 young players stepped up from the Development Squad to the squad. Jenny Smith, the 15 year old who had made her debut against Motherwell and performed admirably, was cup tied. Michelle Stewart, who had been out for a lengthy period through injury, was surprisingly in the starting 11.\n\nHearts went with one up front and had a number playing out of position as they started with their most experienced players.\n\nHearts beat Division 1 North side Tayside Ladies 11-0 in the previous round.\n\nIt was a first view for a while of Glasgow City.\n\nFormed in 1998, City were founder members of the Scottish Women’s Premier League when the Premier Division broke away from the Scottish Women’s Football League for season 2002-03. They finished runners-up in the second season before winning the title in 2005. They were runners-up again the next two years before retaining the title in 2008. They have won the league every season since, with last season being their tenth in a row.\n\nThey’ve won the domestic treble in 2012, 2013 and 2014 and went undefeated in the league for over 6 years until a defeat in 2014. The have actually won the Scottish Women’s Cup 8 times and the Premier League Cup 6 times. And they are regular competitors in the Champions League, having been as far as the quarter final.\n\nIn their ten league games to date this season, they have won nine and drawn one.\n\nIt’s fair to say that Glasgow City have been the best women’s team in Scotland for some time\n\nCity are currently managed by ex-Aberdeen and Scotland striker Scott Booth, who has been in charge since 2015.\n\nCity arrived at Kings Park with a team full of internationals, with new signings Joanne Paton (from Hamilton Accies) and Republic of Ireland International Katie McCabe (on loan from Arsenal).\n\nGlasgow City won 5-0 at fellow SWPL1 side Spartans in the previous round.\n\nThere were around 120 in attendance.\n\nFor the second game in two days, a midfielder from the home side got the ball in the face in the opening minute, with Hutchison feeling the brunt of the pain this time.\n\nWith two minutes gone, Murray found Grant in the Hearts box, but Watson saved well with her feet.\n\nA fine ball by Paton picked out Grant on the left for City in 3 minutes. She cut inside and fired narrowly wide of the far post.\n\nA long ball from half way picked out Grant inside the Hearts box and she went round Watson before squaring it to Lauder. Her shot was blocked by Miller and came back to Paton, whose effort was blocked by Paterson before Kidd cleared behind. Ross took the corner and found the head of Grant who nodded in for the opening goal.\n\nAfter putting their bodies on the line to block the preceding shots, Hearts would have been disappointed to concede such a simple goal. Despite it being Glasgow’s first game back after the mid-season break, they certainly didn’t look rusty.\n\nIn 13 minutes, McCabe passed to Grant on the edge of the Hearts box, but under pressure from Moultray, she shot wide.\n\nA good turn in the Hearts box by Murray, after she had received the ball from Lauder gave her a chance, but pressure from Moultray saw her shoot off target.\n\nWhile it was good to see Stewart back for Hearts after such a long time out, she only lasted 21 minutes before she was replaced.\n\nMcCabe came forward for City in 26 minutes after receiving the ball from Paton and skipped past the challenges of Miller and Paterson, but shot over the bar.\n\nCity certainly had some novel ways to line up when taking a corner. A lot of work had clearly gone in on the training ground.\n\nThe ball was chipped forward by Love for Murray in 29 minutes and she lifted the ball over Watson in the Hearts goal into the net, but the flag was up for offside.\n\nLauder burst into the Hearts half in 35 minutes, but her cross was deflected and Watson was out quickly to smother.\n\nCity won a hotly disputed free kick on the edge of the box in 37 minutes and Ross stepped up to curl a fantastic effort into the net to double the visitors’ lead.\n\nIn 43 minutes, a good move by City ended with Ross going down the right and beating a couple of challenges before cutting the ball back for Paton who swept the ball into the corner to make it three.\n\nGrant got a foot on an attempted pass back by Paterson in 44 minutes, but the ball ran through to Watson in the Hearts goal.\n\nIn injury time, a great ball in from McCabe from the right found Kerr who smashed a shot off the bar before the Hearts defence got the ball away.\n\nA commanding first half by City who controlled the game throughout. Hearts defended resolutely and would have been disappointed at conceding two goals in the last few minutes of the half.\n\nCity won a corner in 49 minutes, when the referee overruled the assistant, much to the annoyance of the Hearts players. Murray got her head to the delivery, but it was off target.\n\nCrichton and Ross exchanged passes in 57 minutes before the former passed to Murray in the box. She quickly stepped away from Paterson and got a shot away which came off the underside of the bar before bouncing out. Play went on for a few seconds before the assistant signalled that the ball had crossed the line. It didn’t look in from where I was and the Hearts players again were not happy, but the assistant had the best view. Four for City.\n\nTwo minutes later Ross chipped into the Hearts box where Paton controlled and laid the ball off to Lauder, who shot low into the net for number five.\n\nMcCabe played the ball to the feet of Boyce in 64 minutes and Paterson did well to get a challenge in to push her wide and Watson saved the shot.\n\nIt was interesting to see Hearts’ diminutive striker Carse coming back to defend corners to use her height in the box.\n\nBrogan Hay latched onto a McCabe header in 80 minutes and drove at the Hearts defence, going past Moultray and Paterson before slotting past Hamilton to make it 6-0 to City.\n\nBoyce shot at the Hearts goal from the corner of the box in 82 minutes, but it was a couple of feet over.\n\nA plane flew over the ground with 5 minutes left and it was a relief to see that there was no “Enwood must go” banner flying from it.\n\nHearts were still trying hard and Moultray threw herself to block a shot on the edge of the box in the last minute. The rebound saw another shot which saw central defensive partner Paterson also dive in front of the ball to stop. Impressive commitment, particularly so late in the game.\n\nIn injury time McCabe went on a run on the left, waltzing past defenders as she made her way into the Hearts box before she was upended by Paterson for a City penalty.\n\nRoss fired the ball high into the net to make it seven.\n\nThe Hearts players looked disappointed as they trudged off at the final whistle but they could be proud of the fight they showed against real quality players. They battled to the end and didn’t let their heads go down despite being under incessant pressure.\n\nIt was a pleasure to see City in action and they are a fantastic side. It’s easy to see why they have been so successful over the years.\n\nMoultray, Paterson and Kidd put in excellent performances in the Hearts defence – we’ve attended a lot of Hearts Ladies games over the past couple of seasons, and it’s up there as one of the best displays we have seen from the central pair. It’s hard to pick out the best players for City as they were all superb, but Grant and Ross hardly put a foot wrong and McCabe looks like some signing.\n\nFull Time: Hearts Ladies 0 Glasgow City 7\n\nAdmission: £3\n\nHearts Ladies: 1 Ashley Watson (Hamilton 75), 14 Lynsay Miller, 4 Louise Moultray, 6 Megan Paterson, 9 Kara Kidd (Cunningham 87), 16 Danni Pagliarulo, 17 Stacey Hutchison, 5 Kasia Stevens (Simmons 83), 8 Michelle Smith (Shankie 21), 10 Ashley Carse, 12 Jennifer Dodds (Delworth 62).
