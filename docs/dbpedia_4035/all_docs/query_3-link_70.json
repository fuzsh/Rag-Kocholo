        "text": "I’ve never played against/with anybody of note but\n\nI watched Scott Rumsby playing a 7’s game on holiday from the side of the pitch stood out like a sore thumb. He was probably 16- 18 years old at the time and was signed with us or the sheep .\n\nHe just bossed it against some guys who looked the part ( gym bodies and wannabes ) saw him ‘step up a gear’ with a few guys when opposition frustration kicked in.\n\nNext thing his da turns up and tells him to fùckin calm it and go easy it’s just a kick about.\n\nI spoke to his da and Scott later on that night, good guys and bears. Plays with Clyde now, I’ve kept an eye out for him since and saw footage of him sticking his head in where others wouldn’t put their foot in!\n\nLots of guys who were absolute world-beaters at their age, absolutely untouchable, and who have done next to nothing in football.\n\nIt always struck me that, for as good as these guys were, there were guys out there better than them. And because we're in Scotland, guys in Europe and the world significantly better than them again.\n\nIt genuinely blew my mind how amazing some of these guys were and they still weren't good enough.\n\nOften it's the case that abìlity only gets you so far.\n\nThose with the right attitude and mentality to match the ability, are normally the ones who make a career out of football.\n\nLots of guys who were absolute world-beaters at their age, absolutely untouchable, and who have done next to nothing in football.\n\nIt always struck me that, for as good as these guys were, there were guys out there better than them. And because we're in Scotland, guys in Europe and the world significantly better than them again.\n\nIt genuinely blew my mind how amazing some of these guys were and they still weren't good enough.\n\nI think a lot of players develop at different levels & ages CO.\n\nTommy Wilson was in my school team & was maybe 7/10 every week but never outstanding, but his professionalism took him through.\n\nOther guys were regarded as better yet didn’t show his drive.\n\nAnother poster mentioned Durrant not being that great as a youngster. I saw Ian in a youth tourney for Scotland at 17 & he didn’t look special. Within 12-18 months he was just everything you’d want in a midfielder.\n\nOften it's the case that abìlity only gets you so far.\n\nThose with the right attitude and mentality to match the ability, are normally the ones who make a career out of football.\n\n^ Very much so,guy in the year above me at Larkhall Academy was seen as 'better than Barry Ferguson and Paul Hartley put together' by a scout who worked for Mill United in Hamilton(and Hivs) who the former club at one point used to be a feeder for the old firm in particular.\n\nGuy's name is John Paul Martin,catholic dad and protestant mum but nice folk and very well liked.John was Rangers daft and although at boys' club level I played with a few who were at Rangers,Motherwell,Dundee Utd. etc he was several levels above anyone else I ever played with or against-frightening.\n\nAs usual off field stuff stopped him realising his potential,real shame.Always liked him and enjoyed playing against him (I was a wide right at that time so didn't have the job of stopping him thankfully).\n\nBest I played against was McGeady, he was frightening.\n\nRan rings around our team for the first half then I put him in the air 4 or 5 times in the 2nd and his dad got him subbed.\n\nBest I played with was someone who went down the drink and weed route and never made it at any level, him and Ross McCormack where the 2 best players around, McCormack wasn't even half as good as the one who never made it.\n\nThe best players I have ever seen never made it. Normally for the reasons you mention. You need incredible commitment to make it as a footballer professionally, which means you need parents who keep you in check. You need to miss out on a lot of normal things growing up with your pals, drinking/holidays/partying etc.\n\nA combination of these things is why so many exceptional players from working class areas never make it.\n\nDorrans and Snodgrass are probably the two best I played against growing up but I seen far better who never came anywhere near making it.\n\nPlayed with Paul McGinn for years when we were younger. Cracking lad but I am a bit surprised he's reached the level he's at now. Fair play to him. His wee brother John was class even at about 8 years old.\n\nPlayed against loads of the Rangers players like Fleck etc. He was actually playing a year or two above himself at the time. The best player in that team was Lachine Cherif...he was unreal the few times I came up against him. Don't think he made it.\n\nPlayed with James McCarthy briefly at Hamilton as well. Didn't think he'd have the career he's had either.\n\nPlayer I've played with who impressed me the most is probably Peter Weatherson. It was towards the tail end of his career as well but he was a superb striker. Morton legend.\n\nPeter Weatherson is really good on CM 03/04 my favourite game of all time. Speaking of, my best friend at Uni played for 2 different english clubs at academy up until 18, and the best player he ever came across was Supat Rungratsamee who is also amazing on CM. He said there was serious questions over his real age as he was twice the size of everyone. Best real player he played was Jack Wilshere who was clearly very special for his age group.\n\nI played against Spencer at the Ayr International many years ago. He was head and shoulders above anyone else on the park\n\nProbably played against others who made it at these tournaments but I only knew him by name as he was well known\n\nThe thing I remember about Spencer as a 11/12 year old was he was lightning quick and, for a wee guy, had some leap on him. I was on holiday in Blackpool when he signed S forms for us and I'm sure it made the front page of the record making a big thing of him being a kafflik.\n\nMy old man also played against Hood, after he'd retired from the seniors at junior level.\n\nHe said he was the cleanest striker of a ball he'd ever seen.\n\nHe also played against Jim Brogan and Jim Denny.\n\nDenny was player coach at Irvine Vics at the time and was probably in his early to mid 30s.\n\nI know my old man never rated him at Ibrox, but said he totally ran games from centre mid and was on a different level to anyone else on the park.\n\nMy dad has always said that was the day he saw the real difference in quality between a decent junior player and someone who'd played senior at a high level.\n\nRobert Prytz ended up playing with Pollok about 10 stone overweight and double the age of the guys round aboot him. Still ran the show"
