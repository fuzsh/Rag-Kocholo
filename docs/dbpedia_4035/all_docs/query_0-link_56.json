        "text": "Sunday 21January 2018, 14.05, Tynecastle Park\n\nThe Scottish Cup Fourth Round tie between Heart of Midlothian and Hibernian.\n\nThe third year in a row that the sides have met in the cup, this time a round earlier than the last two. In season 2015/16 Hibs won in a replay in the fifth round after drawing at Tynecastle on their way to winning the cup. Last season also saw the sides paired in the fifth round, with Hibs winning a replay again at Easter Road before losing in the semi-finals.\n\nHibs could also boast a nine match unbeaten run in derbies with Hearts, while Hearts fans point to several lengthy undefeated spells against their capital rivals, most notably 22 in a row between the 1980s and’90s.\n\nHearts were unbeaten in December and were on a nine-game unbeaten run and a club-record six straight clean sheets. They sat in fifth place in the league, 5 points behind fourth placed Hibs. We last saw them in mid-December, when they won 2-0 at home to Dundee,\n\nDeparting Hearts since the transfer window opened were Jamie Walker and Rafal Grzelak. They brought in left back Demetri Mitchell on loan from Manchester United and Steven Naismith on loan from Norwich City.\n\nRoss Callachan and Arnaud Djoum returned to fitness for Hearts with Prince Buaben, Malaury Martin and Krsytian Nowak injured. Kyle Lafferty was suspended.\n\nWe also last saw Hibs in mid-December, when they lost 2-1 at home to Rangers. Since then they drew twice, won one and lost one. One of those was when they visited Tynecastle for a league match on 27 December and the teams played out an uninspiring 0-0 draw.\n\nThey have also had some movement in the transfer market since the window opened at the start of the year, with Sam Stanton leaving the club and coming in, keeper Scott Bain on loan from Dundee, former Hearts left back Faycal Rherras on loan from KV Mechelen and striker Jamie Maclaren from SV Darmstadt 98.\n\nHibs were without David Gray, Ross Laidlaw and Steven Whitaker through injury, and also Anthony Stokes was absent, with rumours of a bust up with manager Neil Lennon.\n\nThe first competitive game of 2018 for both sides, although they both went to sunnier climes during the winter break, where they played some bounce games against foreign sides. Also the first Scottish Cup game in front of Hearts’ new stand.\n\nA crowd of 18,907 turned up to greet the end of the winter shutdown.\n\nThe first action came in the fourth minute when a fine passing move by Hearts saw Naismith play the ball to Cochrane, who passed to the feet of Goncalves. He laid the ball off to Milinkovic who threaded the ball in behind the Hibs defence for Naismith. Marciano came charging out of his goal and the Hearts player sidestepped him and knocked the ball at goal in one movement as Stevenson got back to challenge. Agonisingly for Naismith, the ball ran wide of goal.\n\nBoyle burst down the right for Hibs in 10 minutes and his cross was deflected by Berra and fell to Slivka in the centre of the box, but under pressure from Randall, he couldn’t get the ball under control.\n\nIn 16 minutes, the referee played a good advantage as Bartley went through the back of Naismith as he laid the ball off to Djoum. The Hearts midfielder strode to the edge of the box but got no power in his shot and it trickled through to Marciano.\n\nHibs Boyle got possession down the right again in 22 minutes and put a dangerous looking ball into the box, but it was just too far in front of Shaw and McLaughlin was able to gather.\n\nShaw picked up a loose ball on the right a minute later and crossed into the Hearts box where Slivka missed his kick. The ball continued to run across the face of goal and came to Boyle free at the back post, but he somehow put it wide of the target from inside the six-yard box.\n\nUp the other end in 24 minutes, Mitchell ran on to a clever ball from Naismith in the left of the Hibs box, but his cutback looking for Goncalves was well cut out by Hanlon.\n\nAs Hibs came forward in 28 minutes, Bartley pushed over Cochrane and the Hearts player then tripped Bartley as he ran past. Both a little fortunate that the referee hadn’t seen the events.\n\nMcGinn tried a shot from 23 yards after receiving a pass from Slivka in 29 minutes, but he was off balance as he struck it and it drifted harmlessly wide of the Hearts goal.\n\nIt was great to see fans all around the ground unite to stand and applaud in the 30th minute to support the fight to get justice for the late Shaun Woodburn and his family, the Junior footballer and Hibs fan who was fatally attacked outside a pub in Leith.\n\nHearts came forward in 33 minutes and Milinkovic chipped the ball over the Hibs defence looking for Goncalves. As McGregor ran back to challenge, it looked like the ball came off his hand in the box as Goncalves was forced wide. He couldn’t get his shot past Marciano as the home fans screamed for a penalty which the referee ignored.\n\nA loose pass from Ambrose in 36 minutes gave Djoum a sight of the Hibs goal from 20 yards, but he sliced his first time effort wide.\n\nThe referee played another good advantage in 39 minutes when McGeouch was caught in his own half. The ball went to McGinn who fed Boyle on the left. He cut inside and let fly from 20 yards, but McLaughlin in the Hearts goal was down quickly to hold the shot.\n\nMilinkovic and Bartley squared up to each other in 42 minutes after Bartley had used his physicality to let the ball run out for a Hibs goal kick, but it was soon over.\n\nA competitive first half in which both sides had had their moments, but still goalless at the break.\n\nHearts began the second half on the front foot and forced a couple of early corners, but the Hibs defence weren’t overly troubled.\n\nA free kick to Hearts in 52 minutes about 25 yards from goal saw Mitchell run over the ball and Naismith playing it into his stride on the left of the box, but he sliced wide of the post.\n\nShaw found Slivka on the left for Hibs in 54 minutes and his first time ball was just too far in front of Boyle and McLaughlin smothered.\n\nIn 57 minutes, Randall played a fine ball into the feet of Goncalves in the left of the Hibs box. He chipped the ball across the box and the inrushing Mitchell hit a thunderous half volley right at the bottom corner which saw Marciano make a magnificent save to keep the ball out.\n\nHibs McGinn picked up the game’s first booking in 61 minutes for persistent fouling after bringing down Cochrane and it looked like it had been coming for a while.\n\nFrom Cowie’s free kick, the ball dropped for Berra in the centre of the box, and he hit it well, but it was straight into the arms of Marciano.\n\nDjoum was a bit lucky to escape a booking in 68 minutes for taking down Hibs McGeouch from behind next to the dug outs.\n\nWith 70 minutes gone, Mitchell had an ambitious effort at goal from a 25 yard free kick, but it was well off target.\n\nSoutar was the first Hearts player booked in 73 minutes for going in very late on Bartley as he went down the wing.\n\nHearts were looking the more likely at this point but weren’t really creating any clear cut chances.\n\nBarker made a good run forward for Hibs in 81 minutes, using his pace to take the ball from his own half and going past Cochrane and Randall, but he overhit his pass when looking to play in Stevenson on the left.\n\nHibs were really coming back into the game and it was them who was starting to put the pressure on in the final ten minutes.\n\nHibs won a free kick on the left in 85 minutes after another Djoum foul and McGinn’s cross was headed on in the middle of the box. It came to Boyle on the corner of the six-yard box on the other side and he struck it on the volley, but McLaughlin did well to push it over the bar.\n\nThe resultant corner saw Hearts break forward in numbers, but Randall’s cross was deflected behind by McGeouch. Cochrane took the corner and Berra rose above everyone to head the ball towards goal. Cowie waved a foot at it and got the slightest touch to make the ball deviate slightly from its original path. It hit McGinn on the line but spun back toward the goal and he couldn’t react quickly enough to prevent the ball going just over the line.\n\nBedlam in three of the four stands.\n\nBerra was booked in the final minute for time wasting.\n\nIn the second minute of injury time, Boyle and Hearts manager Craig Levein were involved in a bit of a shoving match on the touchline, but the referee made do with having a word.\n\nFive minutes of injury time were played but Hibs couldn’t fashion a chance to find an equaliser and it was Hearts through to the next round.\n\nNot the greatest game of football you will see by any manner of means, but few in maroon would care about that.\n\nBerra was immense at the heart of the home defence and Djoum was very competitive in midfield. Mitchell showed real promise on his debut. For Hibs, McGeouch continues to impress every time I see him and Boyle looked a threat, although he really should have scored with his first half sitter.\n\nFull Time: Hearts 1 Hibs 0\n\nAdmission: £28\n\nHearts: 1 Jon McLaughlin, 4 John Souttar, 5 Aaron Hughes, 6 Christophe Berra, 16 Connor Randall, 10 Arnaud Djoum, 11 David Milinkovic (Cowie 57), 47 Harry Cochrane (Smith 93), 77 Isma Goncalves (Moore 88), 24 Demetri Mitchell, 14 Steven Naismith.

Not for the first time, Bonnyrigg Rose managed to get their game on. With all other games in Midlothian off, Rose and their fans cleared all the snow off the pitch, got the covers down, then got up very early on Saturday to take the covers off. Superb work and a lot of credit has to go to all involved.\n\nBonnyrigg sat top of the East Super League and were still unbeaten in all competitions since the start of the season.\n\nWe were at their first round game in the Junior Cup when they won 5-0 against Shettleston and they went on to win at Fauldhouse in round 2. Round 3 saw a win at Vale of Leven to take them into the fourth round.\n\nSince we saw them last, Rose have added former Hearts midfielder Neil Janczyk to their squad. Janczyk had been playing for Penicuik, but left for Tranent Juniors at the end of last season. He signed for Rose in November.\n\nWe hadn’t seen Star since August when they visited Penicuik in the Super League. They sat in eleventh spot in the league, having lost half of their 14 games played.\n\nThere was a bye in the first round of the Junior Cup for Star, before wins against Dundee East Craigie and Cumbernauld United after a replay.\n\nWith so many games off, people from all over came to take in the Midlothian derby. There were a few Musselburgh Athletic players, Broxburn Athletic manager Brian McNaughton and former Hearts player and manager Gary Locke brought another former Hearts manager, Paulo Sergio to see his home town team. They helped swell the crowd to a very impressive 1,063.\n\nRose won a free kick in the opening minute and Currie swung the ball into the Star box and it went all the way through to Renton, who took the ball low to the ground.\n\nThe visitors won a free kick of their own in 6 minutes and when it was headed away to the edge of the box, Melvin struck for goal, but Kerr Young got in the way with a brave block.\n\nBonnyrigg had a corner cleared off the line in 12 minutes, after Currie had found Nelson in the box. Renton got fingers on the shot and O’Hara booted it away. It came to Young who flashed a shot just wide of goal.\n\nIn 15 minutes up the other end, Bryan Young in the Rose goal took a heavy touch from a passback and saw his attempted clearance partially blocked by Scott. The keeper would have been relieved to see the ball go to a home player.\n\nMartynuik crossed into the Star box in 17 minutes and it came to Gray, who saw his shot well parried by Renton. McIntosh and Lough fed the ball to the feet of Currie who shot into the corner to give the hosts the lead.\n\nA quick break by Rose in 20 minutes saw Currie feed Gray on the left. His low cross was dangerous, but the defence managed to clear.\n\nO’Brien played a clever ball behind the Rose defence in 21 minutes to Scott who stepped inside Brett on the edge of the box, but his shot lacked power and it was an easy save for Young.\n\nRose won a free kick in 24 minutes when Osborne brought down Currie. He took the kick himself and his delivery was headed to the edge of the box by Star’s Bracks. The ball fell perfectly for Young who hit a fabulous volley in off the underside of the bar past a helpless Renton to double the home side’s lead.\n\nThey continued to threaten and in 28 minutes, McIntosh crossed from the left into the box where Lough headed the ball down for Nelson, but he lashed over the bar.\n\nNext Janczyk found Nelson who played the ball inside for Young in 30 minutes. He tried his luck from distance, but this time Renton was there to save.\n\nStar won a corner in 37 minutes and Scott’s cross was missed by Bryan Young, but his defence got the ball away.\n\nWith 5 minutes until half time, Star won a free kick about 22 yards from goal. O’Hara hit a low drive which took a slight nick off the wall and flew into the bottom corner to give the visitors hope.\n\nTwo minutes later Star’s Forster tried to clear a cross and played the ball right to the feet of Rose’s Brett on the right. He swung the ball into the box and found the head of Lough who nodded in from close range to restore the two goal lead.\n\nThree one to Rose at half time and they had been the more likely for most of the opening 45 minutes. Star would have been disappointed to lose a goal so soon after hauling themselves back into the match.\n\nStar took off a forward and put on a midfield player at the interval to try and have a bit more of the ball in the second half.\n\nWith just 3 minutes of the second half gone, Forster slide the ball through for Scott, but he fired wide of the Bonnyrigg goal.\n\nScott took a Star corner in 55 minutes which came to O’Hara outside the box, but his well hit shot was too high.\n\nThere was some pushing and shoving between players in 61 minutes after Rose’s Brett was penalised for holding the ball between his legs when on the ground. He tried to carry the ball away after the free kick award and was pushed over. The referee booked Brett and Star’s O’Hara.\n\nStar’s Osborne was the next player carded for a foul on Nelson in 66 minutes.\n\nNewtongrange had got themselves more into the game after flooding the midfield, but they were not really threatening the Rose goal. Rose seemed content with their lead and did not seem to be pushing themselves to extend it.\n\nA high ball into the Rose box in 73 minutes saw Scott running in at the back post to head at goal from close range, but Young was able to make a fine save.\n\nStar were awarded a free kick about 23 yards out in 75 minutes after Gray was harshly adjudged to have fouled Scott. O’Hara took it and curled the ball around the wall and past a static Young in goal to score his second free kick of the day and put his team just one behind again.\n\nMcIntosh passed to Martynuik on the left in 78 minutes and his ball to the back post saw McGachie rise well, but his powerful header was blocked at point blank range by Renton. The rebound was fired goalwards by Nelson but was cleared off the line, then there were penalty appeals when Gray went down, before Star finally hacked the ball clear.\n\nRose came forward again in 79 minutes with McGachie going into the box before going down under the challenge of Swaney in the box. The referee pointed to the spot. The Newtongrange players and management were unhappy with the decision and there was a lengthy delay while the referee spoke to the Star management team before he sent one of them off. It turns out that he hadn’t been studying the VAR system to see if the award was correct.\n\nMartynuik smashed the penalty home and Renton couldn’t quite keep it out, despite going the right way. 4-2 to Bonnyrigg.\n\nStar still kept going and a ball into the feet of O’Brien in 82 minutes saw him turn sharply before shooting just wide from the edge of the box.\n\nIn the final minute of the regulation ninety, McGachie showed great strength to hold the ball up and then take it into the box before laying it off to McIntosh. He squared it to Brett who side footed the ball into the corner of the net to make it 5-2.\n\nThere was still time for O’Hara to try and get his hat-trick of free kicks for Star, but Young managed to push his effort away.\n\nA comfortable win for Rose and they progress into the fifth round. Bonnyrigg looked formidable, and the five players who they had on the bench showed their strength in depth. With Brown and Moyes not even in the squad they look like they will be hard to stop once everyone has regained full fitness. A tough day for Star, but they never gave up and will not be up against this standard of opposition often. Losing a goal quickly both times after they got a goal back meant they never put Rose under enough pressure.\n\nGood performances from many of the home players, but Kerr Young and Currie were the stand outs, with Janczyk not far behind. For Star, Melvin and Bracks played well and O’Hara seems to have become a free kick expert.\n\nFull Time: Bonnyrigg Rose 5 Newtongrange Star 2\n\nAdmission: £6\n\nBonnyrigg Rose: 1 Bryan Young, 2 Dean Brett, 3 Neil Martyniuk, 4 Kerr Young, 5 Alan Horne, 6 Neil Janczyk (Stewart 86), 7 Ross Gray, 8 Adam Nelson (Hoskins 82), 9 Keith Lough (McGachie 65), 10 Wayne McIntosh, 11 Lee Currie.

We’d also seen Edinburgh United at Pumpherston in the East of Scotland Cup in September and Easthouses Lily Miners Welfare, when they faced Bonnyrigg Rose in the Fife and Lothians Cup.\n\nThe game was originally scheduled to be played at West Calder’s Hermand Park, but with their pitch unplayable, the fixture was reversed to Paties Road.\n\nEdinburgh United came into the game in second spot, seven points behind leaders Pumpherston. The chasing pack all had games in hand on the capital side, one of which were West Calder United, who were three points behind with two games in hand.\n\nUnited have been challenging at the top of the league since the season’s start, but have fallen away in recent weeks. Their last six league games have only seen one victory and three defeats. Most recently they lost 3-0 at leaders Pumpherston. They needed to get back on track as quickly as possible.\n\nIt’d been a number of years since we had seen West Calder United.\n\nThere isn’t much information available in terms of West Calder United’s history, but they were formed in 1950.\n\nThe new century saw them playing in the South Juniors East Division 2 and they were finishing in pretty lowly positions. When reorganisation came for season 2002-03, they became members of the Lothian Region Division B, which was renamed Division Two the following season.\n\nFurther reorganisation saw them in the East Region South Division for season 2006-07. They have been finishing in the bottom half in the majority of seasons since then, although they were sixth of fourteen in 2009 and 2010.\n\nLast season saw another sixth place finish and this season is looking a lot more promising for the men from West Lothian. They have, however, also been struggling a bit in recent games.\n\nThey’ve won one in their last five, which was a 4-0 win against Lochgelly, but have lost the other four, conceding 16 goals in the process. Their most recent game had seen them lose 6-5 at Harthill Royal.\n\nBoth sides were therefore in need of a win to keep their promotion hopes alive.\n\nArguably West Calder’s most notable game this season had been their Fife and Lothians Cup tie against Super League side Bo’ness United in October. With West Calder leading 2-0 at half time a shock was on the cards, but Bo’ness came back in the second half to tie the score before winning on penalties.\n\nStrangely, it was the first time we had been to Paties Road Stadium.\n\nThe ground sits in the Colinton area of the city, with tennis facilities nearby. The area also has woodland that have paths to the Water of Leith.\n\nA covered stand dominates one side of the pitch which also houses toilets, a pie stand, changing rooms and a nursery. A fence surrounds the area the pitch is in with grass standing areas on the other three sides which extend beyond the fence. A nice setting.\n\nThere were around 40 in attendance.\n\nIn the second minute, Edinburgh’s Johnson was caught by a late tackle from Mochan as he cleared the ball. The referee didn’t see it.\n\nInglis turned well on the edge of the Edinburgh box in 7 minutes before being brought down by Young. I don’t think he got booked for the challenge, but I was distracted by my watch having stopped at this point.\n\nMcInnes stepped up to take the free kick and placed it right into the corner past the despairing dive of Newman to give the visitors an early lead.\n\nEdinburgh’s Conlon got the ball in the face from close range in 10 minutes and went down. He was soon back on his feet, but the referee insisted he go off for what must have been blood on his face. He was quickly back on.\n\nMcLaren took the ball down the right for West Calder in 13 minutes and went past three Edinburgh players before poking the ball across goal, but Johnson sent the ball behind.\n\nThere was almost disaster for Edinburgh in 15 minutes when Newman passed the ball to Young without realising Mochan was in close proximity. The West Calder player stole the ball, but his shot was recovered by Newman.\n\nHendrie was unhappy with a challenge from West Calder’s Nicol in 16 minutes, but the referee was content to just award the free kick.\n\nMcInnes was causing real problems for the Edinburgh defence with his quick feet and direct running on the left.\n\nA good ball down the left by Edinburgh’s Flynn in 24 minutes found Hendry, but Fyffe got a cross to block the ball for a corner.\n\nMearns lost the ball to McLaughlin in 25 minutes after a heavy touch and he picked up a yellow card for fouling him to prevent his progress.\n\nIn 31 minutes, Hendry had a shot at the West Calder goal from 22 yards, but it was well wide of the target.\n\nHamilton showed a good bit of skill deep in his own box in 32 minutes to turn away from Flynn, although the West Calder keeper had taken quite a risk.\n\nA good run by Edinburgh’s Subasic in 34 minutes took him into the box, but he was halted by a fine Nicol tackle. The ball came to Hendry who saw his powerful shot blocked.\n\nFlynn had a shot at the West Calder goal from outside the box in 42 minutes which was well held by Hamilton.\n\nEdinburgh came forward again a minute later with a good ball to Hendry on the left, but his low effort was saved by Hamilton.\n\nWest Calder broke in 44 minutes and Mochan got through a couple of challenges to get into the box and got the break of the ball off Newman, but it forced him wide and his ball from the by-line was cleared.\n\nJohnson got into the West Calder box in first half injury time and as he crossed into the middle he was caught by a defender and the referee pointed to the spot. Johnson took the penalty himself and put it right in the corner to level the score.\n\nOne each at the break and it had been a very competitive first half. There certainly had been no lack of commitment from either side, but there were a lot of loose passes and possession was changing hands rapidly.\n\nMcLaren and McInnes had caused Edinburgh real problems from the flanks, but they had both faded out of the game as the half progressed. McInnes in particular had looked almost unplayable in the opening 20 minutes, but hadn’t touched the ball much since. The hosts all action midfield had hauled them back into the game after a poor start.\n\nEdinburgh United have a rather novel approach to half time entertainment.\n\nThe home side started the second half on the front foot with Hendry taking the ball down the left in 49 minutes and playing a one-two with Flynn and getting to the by-line. His chipped cross was lifted over everyone in the middle and the chance was gone.\n\nNicol was booked in 51 minutes for a foul on Hendrie just inside the West Calder half. As they waited for the free kick in the West Calder box, Edinburgh’s Johnson and West Calder’s Cooper were having a full blown hug. I’ve no idea what brought this on, but the free kick was headed away.\n\nThere looked to be at least 10 more people in the crowd in the second half.\n\nWith 56 minutes gone, McLaren played the ball through the Edinburgh defence for Mochan. With the whole defence screaming for offside, the referee gave it. The visiting players were not happy.\n\nI’ve said before how difficult it must be for referees when they have no assistants, and defenders of all teams claim for offside every time the ball is played forward.\n\nEdinburgh’s Hendry was cautioned in 61 minutes for a lunge at Cooper, who managed to jump out of the way of the brunt of the challenge, which was probably just as well.\n\nIn 63 minutes, West Calder’s Mochan was the next player in the referee’s notebook for a tackle on McAleavey. He looked like he may have won the ball from where I was. The free kick was played into the box and Hamilton punched it clear. Fyffe was left prone in the box as play raged to the other end. Nearly everyone on and off the pitch was shouting to the ref that he was down (and didn’t look like he had moved) and after the West Calder attack had broken down he eventually realised,\n\nAs the referee made his way to the injured player one of the West Calder subs told him that everyone had been shouting to him. Hamilton in goal responded to his team mate with “It was alright if we’d scored, the ref wasn’t going to cure him!”\n\nDevine threaded the ball through for Mochan in 65 minutes, but Newman was quickly out of the Edinburgh goal to smother.\n\nA break of the ball sent Hendry running through on the left for Edinburgh in 67 minutes. He looked as if he may have been offside, but got to the ball near the by-line before being caught by Hamilton. The West Calder keeper was the latest player booked.\n\nHendry sent the free kick low into the box and found Hendrie, but he blasted over.\n\nDevine looked like he was through on the Edinburgh goal in 71 minutes, but was given offside.\n\nMcAleavey played the ball into the West Calder box from the left in 74 minutes and it went over everyone in the box. Subasic retrieved it and nutmegged Tinning. As he raced into the box, Tinning brought him down and it was another Edinburgh penalty.\n\nJohnson sent Hamilton the wrong way to put Edinburgh in front.\n\nWest Calder won a corner in 76 minutes and McInnes’ cross was met by a thumping header from Devine. Newman got his fingertips to it and touched it onto the bar. Devine was first to the rebound but under pressure, could only nod wide. A great save by the keeper.\n\nEdinburgh’s Mearns and West Calder’s Devine went into a crunching tackle with each other in 77 minutes and Devine was shown a yellow card. It had looked to me as though it might have gone the other way, but the referee was well placed.\n\nWhen West Calder won a free kick about 22 yards out in 79 minutes, one of the Edinburgh defenders wasn’t happy with the speed that the wall was being formed. He shouted “Will four midfielders get in the bastarding wall!” McInnes’ free kick was blocked by the bastarding wall.\n\nHendry burst into the West Calder box in 80 minutes but was stopped by a fantastic tackle from Nicol.\n\nWhen Edinburgh’s Flynn was substituted in 82 minutes, he went as far away from the bench as possible, then kept stopping to fix his boot on the way off. The West Calder players made their feelings known.\n\nConlon was the next to receive a yellow card. The Edinburgh player fouling McLaren in 84 minutes.\n\nWest Calder were bending over backwards to try and get an equaliser.\n\nA McInnes cross into the Edinburgh box in 86 minutes saw Devine win the ball in the air against keeper Newman to nod the ball down, but McAleavey was there to hammer the ball clear.\n\nTwo minutes into injury time, Hendry played the ball forward to Auriemma who went down under the challenge of Fyffe, who insisted he hadn’t touched him. Johnson put the free kick well over the bar.\n\nThere was still time for a final West Calder chance when they won a free kick. Keeper Hamilton went up for it. Adams crossed into the area and there was a scramble in the Edinburgh box and at least two different claims for handball before the defence eventually got the ball away.\n\nThe final whistle blew soon after with West Calder’s McLaren booked for complaining afterwards.\n\nA vital win for the hosts and a disappointing one for the visitors. The game could easily have gone either way with chances at both ends and plenty of decisions that may or may not have been correct. The game was littered with fouls and how nobody got sent off was beyond me.\n\nIt was, however, a game that certainly held the attention with both teams desperate to win and everyone on the park could claim to have given their all.\n\nBest for Edinburgh were Conlon and Mearns, who got through a power of work in midfield and Johnson who was involved in all the big plays. For West Calder, McLaren and McInnes were both good in parts, but didn’t sustain their performance for 90 minutes. Nicol was outstanding in defence.\n\nThanks to Edinburgh United’s twitter account for some help with their team.\n\nFull Time: Edinburgh United 2 West Calder United 1\n\nAdmission: £5\n\nEdinburgh United: 1 Jamie Newman, 8 Daryl Johnson, 5 Jim Young, 10 Sean Conaghan, 3 Daniel McAleavey, 12 Chris Hendrie, 4 Eddie Mearns, 6 Shaun Conlon (Grieve 90), 2 Ano Subasic (Murray 88), 21 Jim Flynn (Auriemma 82), 7 Taylor Hendry.

Despite scoring 104 goals in their 30 league games last season, they could only finish as runners-up, which prevented them from gaining an immediate return to league football. East Kilbride, who pipped them for the title, lost out in the play-off to Cowdenbeath.\n\nThey didn’t start the season well and dropped a long way behind the leaders, but their last seven games had seen them win six and draw one, which was against last season’s champions. This had put them into fourth spot, ten points behind the leaders. With the other teams in the league playing the day before, a win would see them close the gap.\n\nEast Stirlingshire continue to share Stenhousemuir’s ground, and the plastic pitch was likely the only reason that the game beat the cold snap.\n\nJamie Glasgow and Dean Shaw have departed since last season with manager John Sludden bringing in right back Jamie McCormack from tenants Stenhousemuir, striker Kevin Kelbie from Linlithgow Rose, centre half Jordan Tapping from Sauchie Juniors and goalkeeper Iain Ure, who was last at Camelon Juniors. Defender Michael Bolochoweckyi had been on loan from Montrose, but he had just returned to his parent club. That didn’t stop him being in the stand to watch the game.\n\nIt’s the first time for a while we’d seen the University of Stirling side. The last time was at Edinburgh University in April 2016 when the Capital side won by a solitary goal in the Lowland League.\n\nTwo years after the University was founded in 1967, the football club was formed. Initially, they had two sides in midweek student competitions. This became three teams and then four at the end of the 1990s.\n\nThe club now has six men’s teams who compete in senior and amateur leagues across Scotland and in Scottish and British University competitions.\n\nThey first played outwith University football in 1971 when they entered the Scottish Combined Reserve League. This consisted of reserve teams of Second Division clubs and top amateur clubs.\n\nThe Stirling and District Amateur League was the next foray in the late 1970s and the Third XI still play in that league to this day.\n\nThey were members of the Caledonian League from 1983-4 until 2012-13.\n\nUni joined the East of Scotland League for season 2008-09. They won the Premier Division title in 2012 and their second team currently play there. The title win meant a first appearance in the Scottish Cup, where they went out to Junior side Bonnyrigg Rose.\n\nWhen the Lowland League was formed in 2013-14, Stirling University were founder members. August 2014 saw them appoint new manager Shelley Kerr, becoming the first senior club in Britain to appoint a female manager. Kerr is now manager of the women’s national team.\n\nThey lifted the Lowland League Cup in 2014. Last season saw them finish in fourth spot.\n\nThey went into the game in sixth, five points behind East Stirling. Last time out, they had lost 2-1 to BSC Glasgow.\n\nThe University side made a number of signings for this season. They were Kevin Walker and Nathan Brown, keepers from Berwick Rangers and Stranraer respectively, midfielders Craig Brown from Ayr United, David O’Brien from Camelon Juniors, Ollie Monguel, who has returned to the club and former Ross County player Eachainn Miller, defender Kevin Keane from Haddington Athletic and strikers Blair Lyons from the Upper Iowa University and Kieran Hall from Carlisle United.\n\nThe young man on the turnstile tried to give back £14 from a £20 note, which would have made for a particularly cheap afternoon. We pointed out his mistake and hope he wasn’t doing this with everyone!\n\nThere were 142 at the game on a freezing afternoon.\n\nWith the hosts in their black and white hoops, it was a surprise that Uni were in their purple and white hoops. Anyone who was watching who was colour blind would have had a bit of difficulty differentiating between the two strips.\n\nSludden reacted to a bouncing ball in the Uni box in 4 minutes, but the ball didn’t come down for him and he couldn’t get enough power in it to trouble Walker in the Uni goal.\n\nA good ball forward sent Sludden in on goal on the right in 8 minutes and although he looked offside, he was allowed to continue and saw his shot turned around the post by Walker.\n\nBrisbane robbed Uni defender Keane on the right in 11 minutes, but the defender managed to recover to block the ball behind. Walker punched the resultant corner clear.\n\nHunter played the ball to the left for Bonar in 13 minutes and his shot was acrobatically pushed away by East Stirling keeper Barclay.\n\nBack up the other end Walker got down well to save a shot from Brisbane in 14 minutes.\n\nA good ball from Rodgers in 17 minutes created some space for Ure on the edge of the Uni box, but his attempted through ball was overhit and the chance was gone.\n\nThe home side won a corner in 20 minutes and when the ball came over, Tapping headed home powerfully from inside the six-yard box in the middle of the area to give East Stirling the lead.\n\nTwo minutes later, the Shire won another corner on the same side. Ure’s delivery was slightly deeper, but Tapping was there again to head into the net to make it two.\n\nIn 27 minutes, Uni got the break of the ball and Lyons passed to Mailer. He shot for goal from the edge of the box, but it was an easy save for Barclay.\n\nRodgers flicked the ball to Brisbane in 29 minutes as the Shire came forward again. He returned the ball to Rodgers on the left who crossed into the middle where Sludden sent a fine header into the bottom corner to make it three nil.\n\nAnother corner for the home side in 37 minutes saw Ure cross to the back post where it was Greene this time who sent a header at goal, but it was wide.\n\nSludden hit a first time shot at the Uni goal in 39 minutes when the ball bounced to him about 25 yards from goal and Walker was forced to push the ball away. From Sludden’s corner, Tapping headed the ball down and Greene lashed the ball over from about 3 yards, although it did take a nick on the way over.\n\nThis time the corner was taken short and then Ramsay passed to McCormack who sent a curling shot at goal which Walker tipped over the bar.\n\nThe Shire again took the corner short and Rodgers put the ball into the middle where both Tapping and Greene went up with hands raised and the referee awarded a free kick for hand ball, booking Greene.\n\nThree nil at the break and it was hard to see a way back for Uni. They had struggled throughout the half to deal with crossed balls and all the goals came via this route. If anything, it could have been even worse for them. The hosts were starting to knock the ball about with confidence as the half ended and would have been looking to boost their goal difference if Uni heads went down.\n\nWith just three minutes of the second half gone, Mailer crossed low into the East Stirling box and O’Brien got there first to touch the ball away from Tapping who brought him down. Penalty. Bonar sidefooted the ball into the middle of the goal as Barclay dived and Uni had a lifeline.\n\nIn 52 minutes, Brisbane played the ball to Murray on the left. He cut the ball back from the by-line for Rodgers who somehow put the ball over the bar from close range when it looked easier to score.\n\nBrisbane found Rodgers inside the Uni box in 55 minutes and he shot first time when he could have taken the ball closer to goal and Walker blocked.\n\nThings were starting to get a bit tetchy between a few of the players as the match wore on.\n\nUni were starting to put a bit of pressure on and a sustained period of play inside the home side’s half ended with a shot from distance by MacEwan in 62 minutes, but it was off target.\n\nSludden had a go at the Uni goal from a free kick in 65 minutes and the ball rebounded back to him. He threaded the ball through to Brisbane on the right hand side of the box and Uni’s Hunter was blocked by the referee as he tried to get across. Brisbane’s shot saw Walker get down well to block. The referee elected not to book himself.\n\nSludden required treatment in 66 minutes before resuming.\n\nStirling Uni won a free kick on the edge of the box in 69 minutes and Slattery dinked the ball over the wall and everyone stood and watched as it nestled in the corner for Uni’s second. It had almost seemed like slow motion, but was very well placed.\n\nO’Brien was booked in 71 minutes for attempting to bring down the Shire’s Murray.\n\nThere was an almighty stramash in the East Stirling box in 75 minutes when the defence couldn’t get the ball away for a good 30 seconds before they eventually managed to clear.\n\nUni’s Mailer was caught by a Brisbane late tackle in 76 minutes who picked up a yellow card. Two minutes later, it was the other way round as Mailer was cautioned for a tackle on Brisbane, although it looked as if he may have won the ball.\n\nEast Stirling came forward in 80 minutes with Brisbane passing to Ure. He squared the ball to Rodgers on the edge of the box who shot for goal first time. Walker seemed to be down to save the ball in the corner, but he looked to dive over the ball and the ball went into the net for the home side’s fourth.\n\nThe tannoy announcer yelled out “Ya beauty!” over the PA system after the goal went in, which seemed a bit bizarre.\n\nRodgers received the ball from Brisbane on the edge of the Uni box in 84 minutes and he tried to lift the ball over Walker, but could only find the top of the net.\n\nIn the final minute Brisbane knocked the ball past Webb who caught him late. The referee showed the Uni defender a straight red card, which looked a bit harsh from where I was sitting. Brisbane had to go off following the challenge.\n\nAn entertaining game, which was fortunate, as it got very cold in the second half and frostbite seemed to have set in at one point.\n\nIt looked as if the Shire were out of sight at half time, but Uni showed good commitment to fight their way back into the game, and it seemed like they would get something when they pulled two goals back. Rodgers goal sealed the win for the hosts who didn’t look at their best, but still managed to win the three points.\n\nUre and Tapping played well for East Stirling while Walker and Mailer stood out for the University.\n\nBoth teams didn’t reply to my requests for team line-ups, so apologies if any are inaccurate.\n\nFull Time: East Stirlingshire 4 University of Stirling 2\n\nAdmission: £8\n\nEast Stirlingshire: 1 Jamie Barclay, 2 Connor Greene, 5 Jordan Tapping, 4 Andy Grant, 3 Adam Murray, 9 Jamie McCormack, 8 Derek Ure, 11 Drew Ramsay, 7 Andy Rodgers, 10 Paul Sludden (White 82), 6 Steven Brisbane (Allison 90).

Kerr had been on the coaching staff since the beginning of the season. He had a busy pre-season. Leaving the club were Ross Stewart, Mark Ferry, Scott McBride, Calum Ferguson, Kevin McCann, Ross Dunlop, Mick Dunlop, Paul Willis, Ryan Wallace, Ross Gilmour, Kyle Turnbull and player manager Darren Young.\n\nComing in were midfielders Scott McLaughlin, keeper Mark McMillan, striker Sean Higgins and defender Ross Perry, all from Clyde, keeper Graham Bowman from Stenhousemuir, strikers Joao Vitoria from East Kilbride and Alan Trouten from Brechin City, from Alloa Athletic, midfielder Graeme Holmes and defender Jason Marr, and defender Michael McMullin from Partick Thistle. Also arriving at the club were keeper Kieran Wright on loan from Rangers and free agents, midfielder Ryan Watters and midfielder Craig McLeish.\n\nRovers sat in eighth place with 6 wins, three draws and 8 losses from their 17 games played. They’d had two draws and a win in their last three, including most recently a 2-2 draw at Queens Park, where they were 2-0 down with two minutes left.\n\nStriker Alan Trouten had scored 23 goals in 23 games in all competitions in the season to date.\n\nWe last saw Airdrie in pre-season at Gala Fairydean Rovers in June when they were managerless. Former East Fife boss Willie Aitchison took over in August and left two weeks later. Under 20s coach Stevie Findlay became the new incumbent in September.\n\nDeparting Airdrie since the end of the season were Daniel Boateng, Jack Leitch, Simon Mensing, Rohan Ferguson, Andy Ryan, Joe Gorman, Murray Loudon and Ian Russell, who retired.\n\nComing in were defender David Brownlie from Ross County, and midfielders Tom Fry from Motherwell and Willis Furtado, who left Stenhousemuir at the season’s end. They have taken full advantage of the loan market, with winger Jake Hastie, right back Luke Watt and keeper Rohan Ferguson all coming in from Motherwell, the latter who they had just sold to Motherwell. More keepers, Kelby Mason from Hearts and Kyle Gourlay from Dundee were also on loan, as were defender Jordan McGregor from Hamilton Accies, and strikers Jordan Allan from Wolves and Ryan Tierney from Hamilton Accies. A number of players were also promoted from the under 20 side.\n\nAirdrie sat one place above Rovers, a point better off with one more draw and one less defeat. They had two wins and two draws in December, most recently beating league leaders Ayr United by two goals to nil.\n\nIt was a particularly soggy afternoon and the water at the side of the pitch showed that the pitch was going to be very heavy.\n\nThere was a presentation to Rovers defender Alan Reid for 400 appearances, before kick off, with both teams giving him a guard of honour as he came out.\n\nThere were 1,032 in attendance.\n\nA nice turn by Airdrie’s Hastie in the second minute saw him create some space, before he tried to thread the ball through for Russell, who was brought down before he could get to the ball. From the free kick, Brownlie got his head to Furtado’s delivery, but it was straight at Potts in the Rovers goal.\n\nIn 4 minutes, the ball was played to Shields inside the Airdrie box, but he took his eye off the ball (and there may have been a bobble) and he failed to control the ball.\n\nAirdrie keeper Ferguson had an attempted clearance up the pitch blocked by Vitoria in 5 minutes. The striker chased the ball which had spun away to the left and took the ball back towards goal, but saw his shot blocked by the recovering Ferguson. The rebound came to McMullin, but Ferguson blocked again.\n\nAirdrie were playing a back three, but it seemed a very fluid formation, with several midfielders dropping in to make it a back four as and when required. Similarly, midfielders were getting forward to support Russell through the middle up front. Rovers were in a much more structured 4-4-2.\n\nMcIntosh had an unfortunate moment in 13 minutes. As he shepherded the ball over the byline for a goal kick, he got a bit of a shove in the back and ended up in one of the puddles off the pitch. Of course, nobody found this funny…\n\nWith 21 minutes gone, McLaughlin had a go at the Airdrie goal from the left, but it was wide of the target.\n\nHastie got to the Rovers byline on the left in 23 minutes and his cross went over the head of Potts, but came off the top of the bar.\n\nThe rain was pretty constant, but now and again it became torrential for a few minutes. Not the easiest conditions for the players to deal with. Nor for some of the Airdrie fans who were in the uncovered terrace behind the goal.\n\nShields got the better of an Airdrie defender down the right in 27 minutes, but his cross into the box was straight into the arms of Ferguson.\n\nRovers’ McMullan received the game’s first booking in 29 minutes, but I didn’t see what for.\n\nThere was a chance for Rovers in 31 minutes when the ball came to Vitoria in the Airdrie box, but his shot was charged down.\n\nFisher lined up a Rovers free kick from around 23 yards in 33 minutes, but he dragged his shot wide.\n\nThere was some good build up play by the visitors in 36 minutes, but the Rovers defence held firm to prevent any chances being created.\n\nMcMullin had a shot at the Airdrie goal from distance in 38 minutes, but it was well off target.\n\nStill no score at half time and not the greatest game in the opening 45 minutes. The conditions were certainly not conducive to good football and both teams were trying hard, but there had been little in the way of goalmouth action.\n\nIt looked as though Airdrie had completely fresh kits as they returned for the second half, whereas Rovers were in the ones covered in mud splatter from the opening period.\n\nRovers created the first chance of the half, when McMullin got down the right and cut the ball back for Vitoria in 49 minutes, but his shot was deflected behind.\n\nIn 55 minutes, Airdrie broke forward and Russell was bundled over by the strength of Perry. The away fans screamed for a foul, but the referee wasn’t interested.\n\nThe hosts came forward in 57 minutes and Vitoria played a one-two with Shields before moving inside the Airdrie box. He stepped away from a defender and fired at goal. Ferguson got hands to it to keep the ball out, but it fell to the feet of Trouten who had the simple task of knocking the ball into the empty net to give Rovers the lead.\n\nAirdrie won a corner in 59 minutes and Fry’s delivery was met by the head of Stewart, but he put it wide.\n\nIn 63 minutes, Hastie played the ball inside to Fry. He was halted in the Rovers box by a fantastic Perry block.\n\nFry was again involved for Airdrie in 69 minutes when he took the ball down the left and crossed into the middle, but there were no team mates there.\n\nA minute later and Fry played a ball through the Rovers defence to put Furtado through on goal. Potts came racing out of his goal and managed to block the shot, but the rebound hit Furtado and rolled into the net for the equaliser.\n\nA smoke bomb went off in the Airdrie end in the aftermath of the goal.\n\nFry had certainly made a difference since coming on.\n\nReid was booked in 74 minutes for hauling down Furtado in the corner on the left. The free kick was fired across the face of goal by Watt and Hastie stooped to head home from close range to put Airdrie in front.\n\nAnother smoke bomb was set off from the visitors’ terracing as their fans went wild.\n\nA lovely touch by Furtado in the Rovers box in 79 minutes set up Stewart on the right of the area, but under pressure, he could only hit the side netting.\n\nRovers put a free kick into the Airdrie box in 86 minutes which eventually came to Hopkins, but his effort was turned over via the bar, by Ferguson.\n\nFurtado attempted to run the clock down for Airdrie by taking the ball into the corner in 89 minutes, but he was quickly dispossessed. Rovers went up the park and won a corner. The ball was played out for another corner as the game went into injury time.\n\nThis time, Fisher’s corner wasn’t cleared and the ball fell to McLaughlin who smashed the ball into the net for a late equaliser, much to the delight of the home contingent.\n\nThere was no time for any further incident and the spoils were shared.\n\nRovers shaded the first half and Airdrie the second, but a draw was probably a fair result. The game was much improved after the break and both teams served up some decent entertainment for the crowd.\n\nHolmes and Fisher did a power of work for Rovers in midfield and Perry had a fine game in defence. For Airdrie, Edwards and Stewart performed well and Furtado showed some good touches.\n\nFull Time: Albion Rovers 2 Airdrieonians 2\n\nAdmission: £14\n\nAlbion Rovers: 1 Daniel Potts, 2 Daniel Lightbody, 4 Alan Reid, 5 Ross Perry, 3 Scott McLaughlin, 7 Michael McMullin (Hopkins 75), 6 Graeme Holmes, 8 Gary Fisher, 10 Alan Trouten, 9 Connor Shields, 11 Joao Vitoria.

The vast majority of Junior sides do not have games scheduled over the festive period, with the arrangement in the East that teams can request fixtures. That was until the Junior Cup Third Round ties kept getting postponed. All the unresolved ties were moved to the 23rd and would then be pencilled in for the 30th if they were off again.\n\nWith milder weather all week, this resulted in us heading to the Junior Cup tie between East Premier side Downfield and West Central League Division 1 side Wishaw Juniors. It had been a toss-up between this and Lochee United v Johnstone Burgh, but the away side there withdrew as they could not field a team.\n\nIt was a case of fifth time lucky for this tie, with 4 previous postponements.\n\nDownfield do exactly what it says on the tin. They play in the Downfield area of Dundee at Downfield Park.\n\nThey were founded in 1904 and are known as ‘The Spiders’. This comes from the same term applied to Queen’s Park as Downfield play in the same narrow black-and-white hooped shirt. When Downfield were first founded, Queen’s donated a set of strips to them to assist with the start-up.\n\nIt’s maybe because they have that nickname that there seems to be a web of secrecy about their history. There is very little to be found online about the early years of the club or, for that matter, after that.\n\nIt isn’t clear if Downfield have been in existence the whole time since their formation, as the first trophy they seem to have won was in 1987, when they began a great period of success. The cups came thick and fast as they won the Tayside Premier Division three times in a row at the end of the ‘80s.\n\nThe trophies continued until 1995, until there was a ten year gap before the next silverware, the Division One title in 2004-05.\n\nLeague reconstruction prior to the 2006–07 season, saw Downfield find themselves in the twelve-team East Region, North Division, where they finished third in their first season in the division. They’ve won the North Division three times, in 2010-11, 2014-15 and 2015-16. They currently play in the East Premier Division.\n\nLast season saw Downfield finish in tenth place, whereas this season has been tough. They sat in thirteenth with ten defeats from their 16 games, and just four wins. The three teams below them all had several games in hand.\n\nThey hadn’t played a league game since 18 November due to several postponements.\n\nDownfield won 3-2 at Neilston in the second round, after getting a first round bye. Neilston play in the same league as Wishaw.\n\nWe saw Wishaw in their second round replay at Arniston Rangers on 4 November when they won 3-2. (Arniston are in the same league as Downfield). We hadn’t expected to be seeing them in the next round, but circumstances meant that we would.\n\nThey had continued their league challenge, having won six of the eight league games they had played. Their last league game was also on 18 November.\n\nIt’s a first visit to Downfield Park for us and it’s a neat and tidy place with a big social club attached. A small enclosure is opposite the side with the club and changing rooms and there is a portacabin selling food and drink. There is grass banking behind both goals.\n\nI was unable to get a response from Downfield on social media, so I do not have their full team. Apologies for any errors in the ones I do have. Thanks to Wishaw’s Facebook team for providing their names and numbers.\n\nThere were around 70 in attendance.\n\nThe game was just two minutes old when Wishaw’s Collinder went down in the Downfield box, but the referee waved away penalty appeals.\n\nTimmons broke down the right for Downfield and his cross was cleared back to him. He returned it to the front post where Blackwood got there first to turn the ball into the net and give the hosts an early lead.\n\nThe goalscorer was caught as he scored and was down for several minutes and required treatment before rejoining play.\n\nWith 9 minutes gone, Timmons played the ball up the right to Davidson. He played it to Blackwood who laid the ball into the path of Hagen on the edge of the box. He curled it into the corner to double Downfield’s lead.\n\nWishaw looked shell shocked, but created their first opportunity in 12 minutes, when Dan Kindlan found some space on the corner of the box, but sent his low shot straight at Sloan.\n\nDan Kindlan was involved again in 14 minutes, sending a free kick into the Downfield box which saw Coffey rise well, but head over.\n\nThe visitors continued to look for a way back into the game and McCafferty tried his luck from the edge of the box in 15 minutes, but his half volley was a couple of feet too high.\n\nBlackwood had failed to shake off his injury and was replaced in 21 minutes. A blow for Downfield as he had scored the first goal and made the second.\n\nDavidson caused more problems for Wishaw down the right in 22 minutes as he got to the bye-line and cut the ball back for number 12. His shot was half blocked and when it came back to Davidson, he was offside.\n\nIt was Downfield’s turn to shout for a penalty in 23 minutes when Colquhoun went down, but again, the referee wasn’t interested.\n\nA Wishaw free kick in 25 minutes struck Hagen in the Downfield wall, with the referee stopping play for the injury with Wishaw still on the attack. He restarted with a bounce up just outside the Downfield box on the right.\n\nWishaw’s Dean Kindlan picked up the game’s first booking in 28 minutes for a late tackle on number 12. The free kick into the box was cleared but came to Hagan 20 yards out, but he shot wide.\n\nA clearance by Duell in 29 minutes sent Cameron racing through on the Wishaw goal, but he was halted by a late flag. It looked from where I was as if the striker had been unlucky to be penalised.\n\nDan Kindlan went up the right for Wishaw in 30 minutes and played the ball back to McCafferty, but his shot was well off target.\n\nThe Lanarkshire side came forward again in 33 minutes and Dan Kindlan played a one-two with McGeough which took him into the Downfield box and he slotted past Sloan to put Wishaw right back in it.\n\nTwo minutes later, Downfield’s number 6 lost possession inside his own box and Coffey cut the ball back into the path of McCafferty who fired low into the corner for the equaliser.\n\nA long range effort from the left by Wishaw in 37 minutes was turned behind by Sloan.\n\nWhenever Downfield keeper Sloan was in possession of the ball, he seemed to be taking an age to play it. On one particularly lengthy occasion, the Wishaw bench suggested that someone tell him there was “still another half to go.”\n\nWith a minute to half time, Duell was short with an attempted head back to Sloan and McCafferty latched onto it. He was forced wide and Sloan managed to block the ball behind.\n\nWishaw’s Collinder was booked in 45 minutes for a rugby tackle on Davidson on the half way line.\n\nIn first half injury time Downfield’s number 6 won the ball and lifted it into the Wishaw box. Cameron won the header, but the ball drifted over the bar. He stayed down after receiving a knock as he headed it. The Wishaw bench helpfully advised that he was alright, as he was “just tired.”\n\nTwo each at the break and yet again Junior football confounds the old ‘game of two halves’ adage, with a half of two halves. There are often 6 or 7 different halves in 90 minutes…..\n\nWishaw created a decent chance in 49 minutes with Dan Kindlan and McCafferty involved in setting up Grant on the right of the box, but Sloan saved.\n\nMcCafferty got to the Downfield bye-line in 55 minutes, but his ball across goal didn’t find a team mate.\n\nDuell tried his luck from around 22 yards in 62 minutes, but it sailed over the Wishaw bar.\n\nIt was Wishaw’s turn to lose someone to injury when right back Martin limped off in 68 minutes.\n\nHagan crossed into the Wishaw box in 69 minutes and the ball was met by the head of Colquhoun who watched it thump off the base of the post with Thomson beaten. The defence got the ball away.\n\nDownfield’s number 3 was the next to have a go from distance, but his 25 yard effort was well over the bar.\n\nThe crosses of Hagan were causing problems for the Wishaw defence and another ball in from the left by him found Davidson’s head, but he nodded over.\n\nWishaw broke forward in 76 minutes and McCafferty played the ball to Smillie. His shot was well saved by Sloan. The rebound came to Coffey whose shot was cleared off the line.\n\nColquhoun was cautioned in 78 minutes for taking out Wishaw’s Dean Kindlan.\n\nDan Kindlan put a great cross into the Downfield box in 80 minutes, but the defence managed to get the ball away.\n\nDownfield won a corner in 81 minutes and Thomson punched Hagan’s delivery clear. Number 15 for Downfield fired it back at goal, but the keeper was down well to save.\n\nHagan swung another ball into the Wishaw box in 83 minutes which Thomson punched behind. Number 12’s corner saw a glancing header from number 6, but it flashed wide.\n\nWith 5 minutes to go Downfield’s number 15 had a shot which whistled past the post.\n\nIn the final minute, Smillie played the ball to the feet of Dan Kindlan in the Downfield box. He turned quickly and rifled a shot inches wide of the post.\n\nAs we reached injury time Wishaw’s Dan Kindlan was yellow carded for a late tackle on Duell.\n\nIn the third minute of injury time Hagan latched onto a loose ball 23 yards from the Wishaw goal, but his shot was too high.\n\nAll square at the end and after the game going ahead at the fifth time of asking, they would now have to replay.\n\nAn entertaining game and one that could have gone either way. Credit to both teams for getting the ball down and playing some good football on a windy afternoon.\n\nBest for Downfield were Hagan, Davidson and the number 6. For Wishaw, McCafferty and McGeough played well and Crawford was solid at the back.\n\nFull Time: Downfield 2 Wishaw Juniors 2\n\nAdmission: £6\n\nDownfield: 21 Ryan Sloan, 2 Jordan Timmons, 5 Bryan Duell, 4 Charlie Cargill, 3 , 7 Dale Davidson (15 77), 8 Calvin Colquhoun, 6 , 11 Philip Hagan, 9 Lee Cameron, 10 Paul Blackwood (12 21).

They have also brought in further loan players, with forward Scott Shepherd and left back/midfielder Liam Henderson coming in from Falkirk as well as defender Stuart Morrison from Dunfermline Athletic and Ian Smith, a winger, from Dundee.\n\nManager Gary Jardine resigned at the end of September with former Falkirk Assistant Manager James McDonaugh taking over on 10 October.\n\nAfter City’s terrible start last season, they climbed to seventh by the end of the campaign, but things haven’t been easier this season. When Jardine quit after a 3-0 defeat at Stenhousemuir, they sat a point off the bottom, with six points from 8 games. After 15 games, they were still in the same spot, four points clear of the foot, but having played a game more than basement team Cowdenbeath. Nine points from 15 games is far from ideal and new boss McDonaugh was still looking for his first win since taking over.\n\nCity have had terrible injury problems, and were missing Shaun Harrison, Gareth Rodger, Zdravko Karadachki, John Dunn, Andrew Blake, Jesus Tena Garcia, Sean Mackie and Stuart Morrison. Chris McKee was suspended.\n\nWe also last saw Stenhousemuir in July, when they played Indian side Real Kashmir in a friendly. Since then, they have supplemented their squad with the signings of right back Ross Gilmour from Albion Rovers, former East Fife midfielder Nicki Paterson and loan signings Paul Allen, a defender from Dunfermline Athletic and midfielders Innes Murray from Hibs and Alan Cook from Alloa Athletic.\n\nStenhousemuir sat in sixth, but just two points from fourth spot and a play-off position.\n\nThere were 271 in attendance on a very cold afternoon.\n\nThe visitors created the first opportunity with 6 minutes on the clock. Cook broke down the left, went past a defender then cut the ball back for Marsh, who was off balance as he shot wide of the post.\n\nSome nice football by Stenhousemuir in 8 minutes ended with Donaldson putting in a fine cross from the left touchline which was aimed at Scott, but a defender managed to head over.\n\nA Stenny corner in 11 minutes was missed by Antell in the City goal, but the defence managed to get the ball clear.\n\nA minute later, McGuigan was through on the City goal and Antell made a great save to deny his half volley.\n\nCity were almost gifted a goal in 16 minutes when Smith in the away goal completely missed his kick, as he looked to clear. El Alagui almost nipped in, but the keeper managed to poke the ball away.\n\nStenny’s Cook required treatment in 17 minutes before continuing.\n\nGrimes sent Shepherd through on the Stenny goal in 18 minutes. With Ross Dunlop chasing back, Shepherd managed to get his shot away from a tight angle, but it was wide of the post.\n\nA well struck shot from just outside the box on the left by City’s Henderson in 22 minutes was goal bound, but Ross Dunlop managed to get his head on it to send the ball behind.\n\nScott passed to Paton on the right in 25 minutes as Stenny came forward. He cut inside and went past two City defenders before sending a low shot into the net to give the visitors the lead.\n\nCity would have been annoyed at conceding such a soft goal, with Paton having got the break of the ball a couple of times on his run, but the tackles had not been firm enough to dispossess him.\n\nIn 29 minutes, Cook played the ball back to Paton on the edge of the City box. He beat two defenders, one of which looked to catch him, but he stayed on his feet to get a shot away, which Antell did well to turn behind.\n\nStenny were putting some dangerous crosses into the City box, and the hosts did well to repel three corners in a row around the 31 minutes mark, with Marsh and Paton’s deliveries of high quality.\n\nCity won a corner in 36 minutes which saw Thomson’s cross half cleared by the defence. Laird played a one-two with Thomson then swept the ball into the corner of the net past a static Smith for the equaliser.\n\nStenny’s Cook was shown a yellow card in 37 minutes. I’m not sure what it was for, but he had already been spoken to by the referee.\n\nCook got to the City bye line in 41 minutes and cut the ball back looking for Scott, but it was turned behind by Walker. From the corner there was a scramble in the box before a defender poked clear. Cook put the ball back into the area and it fell to the feet of McGuigan who rifled the ball into the net to put Stenny back in front.\n\nTwo minutes before the break Donaldson had a shot at the City goal from 25 yards. It was very well struck, but a couple of feet too high.\n\nStenny led at the interval and they had been the better side in the opening period. Neither team could have been happy with the defending which led to the goals.\n\nCity won a free kick around 23 yards from goal in 48 minutes and Thomson had a go, but it was well over the bar.\n\nA free kick for Stenny 20 yards from goal in 57 minutes was played to Cook whose shot took a nick as it went past the post.\n\nWith an hour gone, El Alagui sent Shepherd through on the Stenny goal. Smith came out of his goal and Ross Dunlop challenged and the striker fell to the ground. Penalty. Although there were calls for the defender to receive his marching orders, he was only shown a yellow card.\n\nEl Alagui stepped up to take the spot kick and slipped as he struck it, sending the ball high over the bar. A lucky escape for the visitors.\n\nCity’s McKee was booked in 66 minutes for pulling back Scott when he had dummied the ball and got away from him.\n\nMcGuigan had a good chance in the City box in 69 minutes, but he didn’t catch his shot well and the home side survived.\n\nCity were looking much more likely in the second half and were putting some pressure on in the hunt for a leveller.\n\nDonaldson got a sore one in 72 minutes when he was booted in the face by El Alagui as he headed the ball on the half way line. It certainly wasn’t deliberate, but it didn’t stop it from looking a bad one. He was ok to carry on after treatment.\n\nAllan had a go at the Stenny goal in 74 minutes from the edge of the box, but Smith saved.\n\nShepherd burst into the Stenny box in 79 minutes on the right, but Ross Dunlop got a tackle in and managed to play it against the City player for a goal kick.\n\nGreat skill by Walker on the edge of the Stenny box in 84 minutes as he lifted the ball up and volleyed at goal, but Smith managed to get hands to it before it was scrambled behind.\n\nWith three minutes left a Thomson effort was fumbled by Smith, but the Stenny defence managed to hack the ball away with Allan about to pounce.\n\nThomson was booked in 88 minutes for trying to take out Cook as he broke forward for Stenny.\n\nIn injury time, Walker broke through a Stenny challenge before sending a dipping shot at goal, but it was too high.\n\nStenhousemuir held on to take maximum points.\n\nWhile the visitors had been the better side in the first half, City really took the game to them in the second half, and but for the untimely slip at the penalty, may have got something from the game.\n\nStenny seemed to try to sit on their lead in the second half and nearly paid the price, but they would have been delighted with the three points.\n\nHenderson looked a useful addition for City and played well, while Walker always looks as though he should be playing at a higher level with his passing and reading of the game. For Stenny, Paton showed some great ability and Cook was a threat on the wing. Scott also has to get credit for the shift he put in.\n\nA slight problem at full time. With the usual portaloos shut, dressing room toilets were being used. Those were also shut after the game as other teams were using the dressing rooms. Now I don’t know about you, but sitting in the freezing cold for nearly two hours tends to mean I am in need of a visit to the facilities before heading home.\n\nFull Time: Edinburgh City 1 Stenhousemuir 2\n\nAdmission: £12\n\nEdinburgh City: 1 Calum Antell, 2 Jordan Caddow, 25 Stuart Morrison, 3 Chris McKee (Allan 66), 7 Craig Thomson, 5 Josh Walker, 6 Marc Laird, 15 Liam Henderson, 11 Ashley Grimes, 18 Farid El Alagui (Malin 76), 19 Scott Shepherd (lanrewaju 81).

We last saw them in February, when they drew 0-0 at Tynecastle in the Scottish Cup, one of four games we saw them play last season.\n\nHibs finally got back to the Premiership at the third time of asking last season when they won the Scottish Championship title. Manager Neil Lennon made considerable changes to the squad following promotion.\n\nLeaving the club were Jason Cummings, Danny Handling, Fraser Fyvie, Aaron Dunsmore, Brian McLean, Scott Gallacher, Alex Harris, Brian Graham, Chris Humphrey, James Keatings, Jordon Forster, Jamie Insall and Grant Holt.\n\nComing in were goalkeeper Ofir Marciano from FC Ashdod in Israel (he had been on loan to Hibs last season), midfielders Vykintas Slivka from Juventus and Danny Swanson from St Johnstone, central defender Efe Ambrose from Celtic, strikers Anthony Stokes from Blackburn Rovers, Simon Murray from Dundee United and Deivydas Matulevicius from Mouscron, right back Steven Whittaker from Norwich City and winger Brandon Barker, who is on loan from Manchester City.\n\nHibs had started the season brightly and went into the game in fourth spot. Rangers and Aberdeen were second and third respectively and both three points ahead, so a win would have put them right into the mix. Their previous game had seen them come back from two down to get a home draw against champions Celtic.\n\nWe hadn’t seen Rangers since March 2016, when they went down 3-2 at Falkirk in the Championship. Their arrival in the top league after the much-publicised financial issues put them in the Scottish Second Division came at the end of that season and they finished in third last season.\n\nAs seems to happen at Rangers every year, there was a lot of comings and goings during pre-season. With manager Pedro Caixinha taking over in March, it was the chance for him to get his own players in.\n\nLeaving Ibrox were Martyn Waghorn, Jow Garner, Barrie McKay, Matt Crooks, Philippe Senderos, Harry Forrester, Rob Kiernan and Clint Hill.\n\nComing in were midfielders Carlos Pena from Guadalajara, Graham Dorrans from Norwich City and Ryan Jack from Aberdeen, strikers Eduardo Herrera from Pumas and Alfredo Morelos from HJK Helsinki, central defenders Fabio Cardoso from Vitoria Setubal and Bruno Alves from Cagliari and winger Daniel Candeias from Benfica. On loan at the club were winger Aaron Nemane from Manchester City, left back Declan John from Cardiff City and midfielder Dalcio from Benfica.\n\nWhen Rangers lost in the League Cup semi final to Motherwell on 22 October, then followed it up with a home draw at then bottom of the table Kilmarnock, manager Caixinha was relieved of his duties. They sat fourth at the time. Graeme Murty took over as caretaker.\n\nRangers approached Derek McInnes, the Aberdeen manager to take over in early December but he turned them down. Rangers announced that Murty would remain in charge until at least the end of the year.\n\nThey came into the match with three wins in a row. The first time they had managed that in the season.\n\nHibs were without the injured David Gray, Danny Swanson and Liam Fontaine. Brandon Barker and Steven Whittaker, who had been injury concerns both made the bench.\n\nGraham Dorrans, Jordan Rossiter, Jak Alnwick and Lee Wallace were all out for Rangers, with Ryan Jack suspended.\n\nThere were 20,057 at the game.\n\nIt was a fast and furious start with lots of tackles and possession changing hands very quickly.\n\nRangers created the first opportunity in the third minute, when Windass played the ball back to Morelos 20 yards out, but his shot was wayward, and ended up going out for a throw in.\n\nHolt robbed McGinn in 4 minutes and Morelos played the ball back to him, but his shot from the edge of the box was deflected wide of the Hibs goal by McGinn.\n\nStokes picked out Boyle on the right for Hibs with a great pass in 5 minutes, and he got the ball into the box, but Alves turned it behind.\n\nA good interception by McGeouch in 6 minutes saw him break forward and lay the ball off to Boyle, but he dragged his shot wide of the Rangers goal from 23 yards.\n\nHibs came forward again in 9 minutes, with Stevenson playing the ball down the left for Murray. He took the ball into the area before laying it back to Stevenson just outside the box. He shot for goal and it came off the foot of the diving Alves and flew into the corner to give Hibs the lead.\n\nThere was more bad news for Rangers in 13 minutes when Miller was forced to come off after going down when attempting to challenge McGeouch and he departed the pitch on a stretcher.\n\nMorelos fed Barjonas in 21 minutes and he had a shot at the Hibs goal from outside the box, but his low shot was a few feet wide.\n\nRangers won a corner in 22 minutes after McGregor had headed a free kick from Windass behind. John’s corner saw Marciano come out of his goal and get nowhere near the ball and it came to the unmarked Morelos at the back post, but he made a mess of the header and knocked it wide.\n\nMcCrorie picked up the game’s first booking in 24 minutes, when he kicked the ball away after fouling Hibs’ McGinn.\n\nIn 26 minutes, Hanlon strode forward from defence and played a one-two with Stokes and burst into the Rangers box on the left. He got his shot away, but Foderingham parried and the defence cleared.\n\nA minute later and McGeouch found Shaw, who played the ball inside John for Boyle, but Foderingham was there to block again.\n\nBoyle played Stokes in down the right in 37 minutes and his cross into the Rangers box was turned behind by Tavernier with Murray lurking.\n\nThe already booked McCrorie bundled over McGinn in 38 minutes and was a bit fortunate to escape further punishment.\n\nA headed clearance from Ambrose in 42 minutes was picked up by Barjonas who stepped inside McGeouch, but dragged his shot wide.\n\nIn 42 minutes, Holt took possession of a loose ball and cleverly flicked the ball into the path of Windass who took a touch before whipping the ball past Marciano into the corner of the net to bring Rangers level.\n\nQuick passing by Rangers in the second minute of first half injury time saw Holt, Candeias then Barjonas play first time passes before the latter played the ball to Morelos. He took the ball into the box on the right and turned Hanlon inside out before rifling past Marciano at the near post from a tight angle to put the visitors in front.\n\nThe half time whistle blew straight after kick off. With 5 minutes to the interval, Hibs would have been disappointed not to be more than one in front in a half they had controlled, then found themselves behind at the break.\n\nIn 50 minutes, McGeouch passed to Boyle on the right and he put a terrific cross into the box for Murray inside the six yard box, but he somehow didn’t make contact.\n\nAmbrose picked up Hibs first booking in 57 minutes for hauling down Windass.\n\nTavernier went down the right for Rangers in 58 minutes and put in a fantastic cross to the back post for the unmarked Morelos who made a complete mess of his header, looking as though he was trying to head it down for a team mate, who wasn’t there. McGregor headed the ball behind.\n\nThe resultant corner was played to Morelos on the left, but he smashed the ball into the side netting.\n\nBoyle swung a cross into the Rangers box from the right in 59 minutes, which came all the way to Barker on the other side. He brought the ball into the box then sent a curling effort past Foderingham which thumped off the base of the far post.\n\nHanlon came forward for Hibs in 63 minutes and played a one-two with Stokes, but his shot was wild.\n\nBarjonas was booked in 64 minutes for a cynical challenge on Boyle on the touchline as the Hibs winger came forward.\n\nWith 68 minutes gone, Boyle exchanged passes with Ambrose on the right before hitting a low cross into the Rangers box, where Foderingham touched the ball away.\n\nHibs attacked again in 69 minutes with Hanlon playing the ball to Barker on the left touchline. He came inside and smashed a low shot from 20 yards which came off the inside of the near post with Foderingham beaten. Stokes was first to the rebound, but he was offside.\n\nHolt picked up a booking in 74 minutes for preventing McGinn from taking a Hibs free kick.\n\nAmbrose crossed into the Rangers box in 77 minutes and Murray didn’t make good contact with his header, but the ball looked to come off the arm of Bates as it bounced. The home fans screamed for a penalty, but the referee wasn’t interested.\n\nIn 80 minutes, Stokes passed inside to Barker who took the ball away from Bates and hammered the ball at goal, but this time he was just too high.\n\nWindass took down McGeouch in 86 minutes and became the next player to be shown the yellow card.\n\nHibs threw Hanlon up front in the last few minutes as they chased an equaliser, but they were unable to create another chance.\n\nHibs should have taken something from the game and were the better side on the night, but Rangers took their chances when they came and defended resolutely to gain all three points.\n\nBoyle and McGeouch were best for Hibs, with Barker causing a lot of problems when he came on. For Rangers, Holt and McCrorie worked hard in midfield and were the stand outs for them, with Foderingham making a couple of vital saves.\n\nFull Time: Hibs 1 Rangers 2\n\nAdmission: £28\n\nHibernian: 1 Ofir Marciano, 25 Efe Ambrose, 24 Darren McGregor, 4 Paul Hanlon, 17 Martin Boyle, 10 Dylan McGeouch, 7 John McGinn, 16 Lewis Stevenson, 28 Anthony Stokes, 15 Simon Murray (Whittaker 87), 32 Oli Shaw (Barker 50).

While everyone at Hearts was delighted to get back to Tynecastle, they haven’t hit the heights since being back home. After that draw, there were further home draws with Ross County and Hamilton, before they got their first win in front of the new stand in their last game. That 1-0 win against Motherwell was their first win in 6 games and took Hearts up to sixth spot. They would be looking to cement a place in the top half for the rest of the season.\n\nMidfielders Jamie Walker and Arnaud Djoum both limped off in the win against Motherwell and only Djoum was fit enough to play. Aaron Hughes was missing again, and teenage striker Rory Currie is out for the season. Jamie Brandon returned from suspension.\n\nA first look at Dundee this season and the first time we had seen them since December the year before, when they won 3-2 against Hearts at Dens Park.\n\nHearts made four changes. Rafal Grzelak, Anthony McDonald, Cole Stockton and Esmael Goncalves came in for Michael Smith, Don Cowie, Jamie Walker and Kyle Lafferty. Sixteen year old McDonald was making his first team debut in midfield.\n\nDundee interim manager Neil McCann had announced he was leaving the club before being given the job on a permanent basis in June. There have been a number of changes in the playing staff since then.\n\nLeaving the club were Matty Allan, Yordi Teijsse, David Mitchell, Rory Loy, Tom Hateley, Nick Ross, Kevin Gomis, Calvin Colquhoun and Danny Williams.\n\nComing in were central defenders Jack Hendry from Wigan Athletic and Josh Meekings from Inverness Caledonian Thistle, midfielders Lewis Spence from Dunfermline Athletic, Glen Kamara from Arsenal and Roarie Deacon from Sutton United, goalkeeper Elliot Parish from Accrington Stanley, winger Randy Wolters from Go Ahead Eagles, left back Jon Aurtenexe from SD Amorebieta and forward Sofian Moussa from FC Lokomotiv Gorna Oryahovitsa. In on loan were midfielder Scott Allan from Celtic and AJ Leitch-Smith, a forward from Shrewsbury Town.\n\nIt hasn’t been a great start to the season for Dundee, and they came into the game in tenth spot. They have been showing real signs of improvement recently, which saw them draw with Kilmarnock, beat Rangers and win at Ross County. Their previous outing some them lose by a single goal at home to Aberdeen.\n\nDundee had a full squad to choose from and Scott Allan and Kerr Waddell came into the starting line-up for Cammy Kerr and Faissal El Bakhtaoui, who were both on the bench.\n\nThere were 15,566 in attendance, with 531 in the away end.\n\nThe home side looked to get on the front foot from the start, but the Dundee defence comfortably dealt with early crosses into their box.\n\nDjoum then had a go at the Dundee goal from around 20 yards in 10 minutes, after a forward run by Moore, but it was too high.\n\nWhile Djoum’s shot didn’t really threaten, it did so more than his team mate Isma’s’, when his effort in 15 minutes went out for a throw in.\n\nThe long range efforts continued for Hearts as Randall had a go after driving forward towards goal in 18 minutes, but again, it was too high.\n\nHearts were really starting to put some pressure on and Buaben’s shot from the edge of the box in 20 minutes appeared to hit Meekings’ hand, but the award of a penalty would have been very harsh.\n\nBerra’s ball across the face of the Dundee goal in 22 minutes was half cleared by Waddell, but Djoum picked up the ball and played in Stockton. His shot was blocked by the foot of Parish.\n\nDjoum and O’Hara both required treatment in 24 minutes after going into a tackle on the half way line, but both looked able to continue.\n\nDundee looked to get into the game in 28 minutes when Deacon was brought down by Grzelak, 25 yards from the Hearts goal. Allan struck for goal, but it didn’t unduly trouble McLaughlin.\n\nMcDonald picked up a loose ball midway inside his own half in 30 minutes and burst forward into the Dundee half. He continued his run before slipping Isma through in the box and he held off Meekings before sliding the ball past Parish and into the net to give the hosts the lead.\n\nHearts were delighted to be in front, but in the aftermath of the goal, Djoum was forced to go off. With his replacement, Cochrane aged 16, they now had two 16-year-olds and a 19-year-old (Moore) in midfield. Twenty-nine-year-old Buaben, the other in the midfield brought the average age up a bit.\n\nThe departure of Djoum seemed to signal more possession for the visitors, but they lacked any penetration.\n\nA cross to the back post by McDonald in 38 minutes saw Stockton challenge for the ball in the air with Dundee’s Hendry, and the defender collided with the post. It was good to see that he was ok to continue after treatment.\n\nDundee fashioned a great chance in 43 minutes when Moussa chested the ball down for Deacon. He turned well, but scuffed his shot, which deflected into the path of Moussa, but he couldn’t sort his feet out quickly enough and McLaughlin smothered.\n\nAurtenetxe won Dundee a free kick in 45 minutes and Allan’s cross found the head of Meekings, but he glanced it wide.\n\nWhile Dundee were finishing the half strongly, it was Hearts who had the final chance of the half. Isma went on a run that saw him spin away from a couple of defenders before he fed Moore. His shot though, was straight at Parish.\n\nHearts in front at the break and deservedly so, although Dundee had grown into the game as the half wore on. They still struggled to create much though and needed to get through the Hearts defence in the second half.\n\nHendry didn’t come out after the interval, probably still suffering from his argument with the post. Dundee switched to a 4-2-3-1 formation as Kerr came on.\n\nFour minutes into the second half, Aurtenetxe picked out Deacon on the right hand side of the Hearts box. He cut inside Grzelak and sent a low shot narrowly wide of the post.\n\nA fine move by Hearts in 51 minutes ended with Moore feeding Randall on the right and his cross was perfect for Stockton who tapped the ball into the net from close range, but the flag was up for offside.\n\nDundee broke forward in 54 minutes and McGowan looked for Moussa in the box, but Souttar managed to turn the ball behind. From the corner, Meekings won the header, but his effort was too high.\n\nThe visitors were having a good spell and won a couple of corners before Hearts’ Grzelak was booked for a foul on the dangerous Deacon in 57 minutes.\n\nAllan tried to catch out McLaughlin in the Hearts goal in 59 minutes with a free kick from the right, but the keeper was quickly across.\n\nThere was a blow for Dundee in 63 minutes when Deacon had to go off, not having fully recovered from the earlier tackle.\n\nIn 65 minutes, Stockton did well to control a high clearance from the Hearts defence just inside the opponents’ half and he sent a great ball for Callaghan who was clean through on the Dundee goal. He charged through the middle, but shot straight at Parish and the ball was cleared.\n\nO’Hara won a free kick for Dundee in 69 minutes on the edge of the Hearts box after being fouled by Cochrane. Aurtenetxe curled the ball around the wall, but it was wide of the post.\n\nThe next few minutes seemed to be littered with fouls as both teams looked for the crucial next goal.\n\nBuaben had a shot at the Dundee goal from outside the box in 75 minutes, but it was off target.\n\nA Hearts corner in 77 minutes was taken by McDonald. O’Hara tried to clear but the ball came off the head of team mate Kerr and fell to Berra at the back post. He took a touch before slamming the ball past Parish and into the net to make it 2-0.\n\nAurtenetxe receive a long ball on the left for Dundee in 82 minutes and sent a great curling effort with the outside of his foot at goal. McLaughlin looked beaten, but the ball landed on the top of the net.\n\nLafferty strode into the Dundee box in 87 minutes, but his shot was blocked by the legs of Parish.\n\nThere was no further action and Hearts walked away with the three points.\n\nHearts had looked the more dangerous throughout, but the visitors did improve in the second half, without looking hugely threatening. Dundee’s change in formation at the interval seemed to help them, but Hearts still had some good chances to extend their lead.\n\nMcDonald made a fine debut for Hearts and was heavily involved in both goals. Moore also did well on the other flank, but Berra was the stand out, as he didn’t put a foot wrong at the back and even managed to score the clinching goal. Dundee had decent spells of possession and Allan tried to probe his way through the Hearts defence and Deacon looked a threat until his departure, but too many errors were their downfall.\n\nFull Time: Hearts 2 Dundee 0\n\nAdmission: £19\n\nHearts: 1 Jon McLaughlin, 16 Connor Randall, 4 John Souttar, 6 Christophe Berra, 27 Rafal Grzelak, 46 Anthony McDonald, 8 Prince Buaben, 10 Arnaud Djoum (Cochrane 31), 33 Lewis Moore (Lafferty 73), 77 Isma Goncalves (Callaghan 57), 23 Cole Stockton.
