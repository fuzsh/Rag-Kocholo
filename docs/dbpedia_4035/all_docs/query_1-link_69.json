        "text": "Following the draw this afternoon in Nyon, Switzerland, it has been narrowed down from 22 to eight to two possible opponents.\n\nHearts will play the winners of the Europa League third qualifying round tie between the Ukrainian side Kryvbas and Czech outfit Viktoria Plzen. The first-leg is this Thursday when the Ukrainians host Plzen in Kosice, Slovakia with the second-leg in Czechia the following week.\n\nThe play-off round is scheduled for August 22 and 29 with Hearts set to be away first with the second-leg at Tynecastle Park.\n\nSo, what do we need to know about the two possible opponents?\n\nViktoria Plzen\n\nFact file\n\nFounded: 1911\n\nManager: Miroslav Koubek - A highly experienced manager who is in his third spell as Plzen boss, more than 20 years after his first stint. He also counts Mladá Boleslav and Slavia Prague amongst his former clubs during his managerial career.\n\nStadium: Doosan Arena (Capacity: 11,700)\n\nNearest airport: Prague\n\nLast season: Third in the Czech First League, Conference League quarter-finals, final of the MOL Cup.\n\nWho are Viktoria Plzen?\n\nThe club have had several name changes in their long history but the current one has been around since 1993. Between 1999 and 2005 they were relegated from the Czech top-flight three times and spent four seasons in total in the second tier. It wasn't until 2010 that they became one of the most prominent teams in Czechia. In fact, in the last 14 seasons, they have been the most successful team in the country, winning the league six times, finishing outside of the top three just once. Their most recent title came in 2022.\n\nBecause of their success in the league, they are seasoned European campaigners. A crack outfit if you will. In 2010, they qualified for Europe for just the second time in their history. They have qualified for Europe every year since, appearing in the Champions League group stage on four occasions.\n\nThe list of teams they have defeated in the last 14 years includes Atlético Madrid, Napoli, Shakhtar Donetsk, Lyon and Roma.\n\nWhat can fans expect?\n\nPlzen predominantly play a back three and field two strikers. Although they demonstrated an ability to switch to a back four when needed last season. They are a team that likes to focus their attacks down the flanks. Of the five most frequent crossers in the Czech league last campaign, three were Plzen players. This suits key player Pavel Sulc. The young forward is adept at getting involved in the build-up and then breaking into the box to convert crosses.\n\nAs a collective, they are neither a possession-based side nor a pressing side. But they did have 53 per cent of the ball across their league games last season and are active out of possession without suffocating teams.\n\nKey players?\n\nThey lost last season's second-top scorer Tomas Chory to Czech rivals Slavia Prague for €3million but top scorer Sulc remains. He plays at the top of the midfield in their 3-4-1-2 behind the strike pairing. He has, however, garnered strong interest from MLS side Real Salt Lake. Plzen have a strong spine with centre-backs Sampson Dweh and Czech international Robin Hranac. Lukas Kalvach provides experience in front of them in midfield.\n\nWhile they have lost Chory, they have added two forwards in Ricardinho from Levski Sofia for €1.2million and Czech under-21 international Christophe Kabongo.\n\nPrice of a pint\n\nHearts fans can expect to pay around £1.75 for a pint.\n\nRead more\n\nHearts in Europe: Finances, opponents, and why Conference League could be best\n\nInside story of Gerald Taylor's Hearts move: Mentality, transfer options, demand\n\nInside Hearts new kits: JD Sports deal, Umbro partnership, colour confirmation\n\nKryvbas Kryvyi Rih\n\nFact file\n\nFounded: 2020\n\nManager: Yuriy Vernydub - The 58-year-old had a playing career that was spent mostly in Ukraine but he finished his career with Russian side Zenit St Petersburg. He has had management success, leading Shakhtyor Soligorsk to the Belarusian Premier League and Sheriff Tiraspol to two Moldovan league titles. During his time with Sheriff he led them into the Champions League group stages for the first team and masterminded wins over Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk. He was appointed Kryvbas boss in 2022.\n\nStadium: They are using Kosicka Futbalova Arena in the Slovakian city of Kosice for their third qualifying round match (Capacity: 12,555)\n\nNearest airport: Kosice International Airport\n\nLast season: Third in the Ukrainian Premier League\n\nWho are Kryvbas Kryvyi Rih?\n\nThey have had a somewhat complex history. The current club was founded only four years ago and was renamed from another club re-established in 2017. Beyond that, the history of the football club can be traced back to 1925. In reality, it requires a lot of string, bits of paper, and pictures to get a handle on it.\n\nIn its current guise, the club first ascended to the Ukrainian top-flight in 2022 where they finished seventh. Last season's third-place finish was just their second at that level and the first ever time the club had qualified for Europe. Should they defeat Plzen, Hearts will be just their second-ever opponents in Europe.\n\nThe game with the Czechs is taking place in Kosice which is less than 100km from the Ukrainian border but more than 1,100km from their home of Kryvyi Rih. Or, in other metrics, a nearly 16-hour drive.\n\nWhat can fans expect?\n\nThey are a team that sets up in a variation of a 4-3-3, rarely playing two strikers together. Last season they had big 'Hearts finishing third under Csaba Laszlo' energy. Their top scorer, Oleg Kozhushko, finished the campaign with nine goals.\n\nHearts can expect to dominate the ball against the Ukrainians. Despite their third-place finish, they averaged under 50 per cent of the ball. But when they get it they are pretty direct. They were seventh out of 16 teams for the number of passes per 90 minutes but no team averaged more through passes, second for crosses and third for progressive passes.\n\nThey are relatively standoffish out of possession but do commit a lot of fouls despite not being a high-pressing side.\n\nKey players?\n\nTheir captain is former Ukraine international Dmytro Khomchenovskyi who played more than 220 times for Zorya Luhansk. He can play as an attacking midfielder, in a deeper role or out wide. Two young African players play prominent roles for the team, left-back Yvan Dibango whose value has risen with the club, and Prince Kwabena Adu who led the line in the opening game of the season.\n\nDibango is heavily involved in and out of possession. He recorded five assists in the league - only two players made more - and was a regular crosser of the ball. Without it, he is competitive, recording the highest number of defensive duels.\n\nPrice of a pint\n\nIf the game takes place in Slovkia - reports elsewhere suggest that is not set in stone - it is slightly more expensive with a pint priced around €2."
