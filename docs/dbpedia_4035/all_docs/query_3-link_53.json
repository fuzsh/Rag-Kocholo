        "text": "NORTH WALES CRICKET LEAGUE REPORTS – AUGUST 3\n\nDIVISION ONE\n\nBethesda (12) 143-10 Brymbo 2nd XI (3) 111-10\n\nNicholas Parry led the way with 49 as Bethesda set a winning total of 143 all out at Parc Villa after winning the toss and choosing to bat.\n\nIoan Roberts added 25 for the home side, Jack Williams taking an excellent 5-32 for the Steelmen, while Gareth Pugh scooped 2-30.\n\nIn response, the visitors were dismissed for 111, Adam Smith 29 and skipper George Bourne 24, Craig Newey bagging 4-19, Daniel Oshyer 3-27 and Andrew Day 2-20 for Pesda.\n\nConnah’s Quay (15) 264-8 Abergele (0) 111-10\n\nSkipper Darren Leach scored a North Wales League career-best 67 not out in Connah’s Quay’s mammoth total at Central Park.\n\nCalling the coin correctly and opting for first knock, Quay slumped to 48-4 and then 111-6 before launching a major recovery.\n\nRhys Stout (59) put on 57 with Leach for the seventh wicket. Then came a tremendous eighth-wicket stand of 95 between Leach and Lee Davies (32).\n\nNumber eight bat Leach’s half-century came off just 47 balls and included eight fours and two sixes as the hosts ended on 264-8 from 45 overs.\n\nLewis Tolond nabbed 3-42 off nine for the visitors.\n\nGele could only muster 111 in reply, number 10 Rana Das top-scoring with 23 no.\n\nDavies gathered 5-32 and Mali Auty 2-28 as Quay completed a 153-run, 15-0 points success.\n\nDolgellau (1) 138-7 Halkyn (14) 139-3\n\nOpener Nabeel Khan’s unbeaten 69 did most to guide Halkyn to a seven-wicket triumph at The Marian.\n\nDolgellau could only manage a modest 138-7 off 45 overs, Morgan Yorke best with 29, Ben Roberts 2-20 and Khan 2-23 for the visitors.\n\nAnd Khan was the main man in Halkyn’s reply of 139-3 in 33.3, Lufras Van Vuuren 2-30.\n\nMold (14) 178-3 Conwy (1) 176-8\n\nOpener Evan Williams’ 88 not out was the major highlight of Conwy’s innings, but it was not enough to save his side from a seven-wicket loss at Mold.\n\nThe visitors set 176-8 off 45 after electing to bat, Williams hitting 13 fours in his magnificent effort, but he lacked support with Gareth Thomas (22) the next highest score.\n\nMunowar Samsodien produced outstanding figures of 4-20 for Mold.\n\nThe hosts cruised to 178-3 from 29.5 in response, Richard Crane 46 not out, Thomas North 44 and captain Isaac Allen 34. Points: 14-1.\n\nNorthop 2nd XI (13) 207-6 Hawarden Park (2) 146-10\n\nLeaders Northop seconds were indebted to their top four batsmen for making such a formidable total at home to Hawarden.\n\nCharlie Collins (53), Thomas Hughes (52 not out), David Foulkes (39) and James Roberts (31) all produced fine knocks as the hosts posted 207-6 off 45, Michael Wootton 2-47 for Park.\n\nHawarden were sent packing for 146, Evan Shaw 36, with Scott Oates collecting 5-25 and Mark Poynton 2-29 for the victors.\n\nPontblyddyn (15) 223-7 Buckley (0) 47-10\n\nThree key innings ensured Pontblyddyn chalked up a winning score at Alder Meadow – Alistair Roberts (61 not out), Gethin Thomas (58) and Chris Myles (46).\n\nLee Taylor snared 3-31 for Buckley, who were then skittled out for a paltry 47, Chris Moss 4-17, James Hughes 3-6 and Ioan Jones 2-20.\n\nDIVISION TWO\n\nCarmel and District (14) 148-3 Bersham (1) 146-7\n\nA very solid all-round display ensured Carmel skipped to a comfortable win at home to Bersham on Saturday.\n\nPut into bat, the visitors were limited to 146-7, skipper Jonath David 29 and Anirudh Menon 26 not out, Stephen Skates 3-36 for the hosts.\n\nCarmel reached 148-3 in 35.1, skipper Ben Sim 40, Ryan Roberts 33 no and Gwion Dafydd 30 no, Sujeesh Vazhadan 3-36 for the travellers.\n\nCorwen (13) 276-6 Bangor 2nd XI (2) 204-5\n\nOpener Harry Pooler cracked both a maiden century and career best 133 for winners Corwen in a high-scoring battle.\n\nThe hosts made the most of being inserted by piling up 276-6 off 40 overs, Pooler’s magical ton coming off 100 balls with 13 fours and six sixes.\n\nSimon Harrison contributed 42 for the home team, sharing in a third-wicket partnership of 118 with Pooler.\n\nBangor’s response ended on 204-5, Sohaib Khan 82 and Peter Jones 42 no, Liam Thomas 2-39 for Corwen, who won by 72 runs and 13-2 points.\n\nMarchwiel and Wrexham (3) 130-10 Mochdre 2nd XI (12) 163-9\n\nTable-toppers Marchwiel and Wrexham suffered an uncharacteristic second defeat in a row, second-place Mochdre seconds finishing on top.\n\nSkipper Adam Jones headed the chart on 57 as the visitors set 163-9 from 40, Gareth Evans 3-37, Muhammad Ghufran and George Forgrave both 2-18 for the leaders.\n\nThomas Opie scooped 3-35 and Munim Khan 2-16 as Mochdre dismissed the home side for 130 to seal a 12-3 points success, Ghufran 34.\n\nMenai Bridge 2nd XI (14) 122-2 Gresford 2nd XI (1) 121-8\n\nDion Owen bagged 4-12 off eight and Ian Granger 3-1 as Menai Bridge seconds restricted Gresford seconds to 121-8 from 40 at Tyn-y-Caeau Drive, Ryan Williams 36.\n\nThe Anglesey side eased to 122-2 off 25 to claim a 14-1 victory, Edward Gadsby 48 not out and Andrew Wannop 40 no.\n\nSt Asaph 2nd XI (15) 202-8 Llanrwst (0) 55-10\n\nSkipper Andy Mearns (56), Roger Cloete (46) and John Ross (34) were the chief scorers in St Asaph seconds’ winning effort of 202-8.\n\nDewi Parry took 4-27 and Owen Booth 2-20 for the Rwsters, who were then rolled over for a mere 55, Aron Hughes 23, Liam Moores 5-12, Ankush Upadhyaya 2-17 and Russell Moore 2-20 for the emphatic home winners.\n\nDIVISION THREE\n\nBuckley 2nd XI (2) 133-10 Ruthin (13) 198-7\n\nOpener Duncan Roberts struck 83 not out and Murray Whitehead made 54 in Ruthin’s 198-7 off 40 at Lane End, Ravichandran Vinoj 4-21 for the hosts.\n\nIn reply, Bucks seconds were all back in the pavilion for 133, Harry Sprowell 24, Joshua Duckworth 4-23, Dafydd Roberts 2-10 and Jonny Clayton 2-16 for the visitors.\n\nConwy 2nd XI (3) 140-9 Mold 2nd XI (12) 178-9\n\nA 38-run win for Mold seconds at Bodlondeb.\n\nThe visitors set 178-9, George Jones 44, Louis Boulton 35 and Daniel Williams 33, Nick Davies 2-15 and Philip Davies 2-18 for Conwy seconds, who in response were kept down to 140-9, Lewis Jones 53 and Carwyn Thomas 31, Chris Boulton 4-23 and Noa Grant 3-23 for the Flintshire victors.\n\nDenbigh 2nd XI (15) 186-10 Clwb Criced Caernarfon (0) 85-10\n\nGerallt Lyall top-scored with 50 as Denbigh seconds rustled up 186 all out off 39.5, skipper Daniel Nixon adding 36 for the hosts, Simon Davis 3-21 and Monis Altaf 3-36 for the Cofis.\n\nCaernarfon were all out for 85, William Schrimshaw 2-9, Paul Threlfall 2-11 and Ifan Jones 2-13 for the home side, who celebrated a 15-0 points verdict.\n\nHalkyn 2nd XI (11) 79-10 Connah’s Quay 2nd XI (4) 78-10\n\nThe closest finish of the day occurred at Pant Newydd where Halkyn seconds won by a single run.\n\nAaron Thomas was leading contributor with 27 as the hosts were bowled out for 79, Hashmat Safi 3-16, Matthew Dix 2-3 and Jack Griffiths 2-10 for the Deesiders.\n\nQuay were dismissed for 78 with plenty of overs remaining, Josh Edwards 4-23 and Will Baker 3-18 for the narrow winners.\n\nHawarden Park 2nd XI (14) 169-10 Bethesda 2nd XI (1) 79-10\n\nMan of the match Tom Wilson’s superb batting and bowling totally dominated this match at Moor Lane.\n\nThe Hawarden Park all-rounder hammered 72 not out off 64 balls, including nine fours and then took 4-6 off seven overs as Pesda were blown away for 79.\n\nWilson’s wonder knock was the main feature of Hawarden seconds’ total of 169 all out, Sopan Patil 3-33 and Ashley Rowlands 2-15 for the visitors, who were blasted out by Wilson’s heroics, well-backed by Ahmed Javed (3-14) and Owen Ford (2-25).\n\nPwllheili 2nd XI (14) 112-2 Gwersyllt Park 2nd XI (1) 111-10\n\nKalim Al Baloshi picked up 4-12 and Adam Williams 2-5 as Pwllheli dismissed Gwersyllt Park seconds for 111, skipper Ben Griffiths 32, Jack Watkins 29.\n\nCaptain Ioan Jones then made 47 as Pwll reached 112-2 off 22.2 for a 14-1, eight-wicket triumph.\n\nDIVISION FOUR\n\nAbergele 2nd XI (13) 172-4 Mynydd Isa and Maeshafn (2) 168-6\n\nSebin Sebastion (70 not out) and David Holmes (41) played the vital innings as Abergele seconds recovered from 34-3 to reach the 169 needed for a six-wicket victory.\n\nMynydd Isa and Maeshafn set a handy 168-6, opener Abs Dey an excellent 86, Devon Shaw pouching 2-31 for the hosts.\n\nGele got home on 172-4 off 37 thanks to the fine work of Sebastion and Holmes.\n\nHawarden Park 3rd XI (4) 190-2 Carmel and District 2nd XI (11) 214-2\n\nThe batting was certainly on top in a match which featured 404 runs for just a total of four wickets lost.\n\nCarmel seconds posted 214-2 thanks to brilliant efforts from Steven Jones (108 not out) and Rick Kirkham (85 no).\n\nHawarden Park thirds’ response was a good one, but ended 25 short of victory on 190-2, John Cooper a stand out unbeaten 98.\n\nLlandudno 2nd XI (14) 220-7 Marchwiel and Wrexham 2nd XI (1) 137-10\n\nAnother big score for Llandudno seconds guided them to victory.\n\nLucas Hughes made 63, Andrew Christian 43 and Ryan Bean
