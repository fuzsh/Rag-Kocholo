        "text": "North Berwick's Golfing Pioneers.\n\nIn 1891, in the same class at North Berwick Public School were Willie Anderson, James Souter, George Livingstone, James Hutchison and George Turnbull. All emigrated and left their mark on American golf. In the junior form was Jack Hobens who helped to draft the constitution of the Professional Golfers Association of America and in the year below, class mates Fred McLeod and Daniel Kenny, were to become national champions.\n\nGeorge Douglas was the first golf caddie to emigrate from North Berwick. He arrived on 18th April 1896 and was appointed golf professional to the Country Club of Brookline, Boston, Massachusetts. He was followed a year later by Harry Gullane who was invited to join Philadelphia Country Club in 1897. That year Robert M Thomson was appointed to Merion Cricket Club, Philadelphia and George Thomson was the first of Ben Sayers apprentice clubmakers to emigrate and was assistant to Jack Hobens at Yountakah Country Club, New Jersey.\n\nListed among the first forty golf professionals in the United States prior to 1898 are George Douglas, Tom Warrender, Harry Gullane, and Willie Anderson and today they are recognised as the true pioneers of American golf. The list of the earliest Australian Golf Professionals includes twins Alex and Jack McLaren, William Russell and brothers Alec and Duncan Denholm.\n\nThe first North Berwick golf professional to leave the town was John Johnstone in 1895 when he was appointed to the Port Elizabeth Golf Club, South Africa on a two year engagement. John Johnstone served an apprenticeship as a club maker with Ben Sayers and resided at 11 Heriot Place, North Berwick. He extended the Port Elizabeth Golf Club course to eighteen holes in 1902.\n\nWillie Anderson arrived in America on Sunday 21st March 1896 to take up his position at Misquamicut Golf Club, Watch Hill, Rhode Island. Anderson was accompanied on the journey by Tom Warrender from North Berwick. who followed Carl Fox from North Berwick as professional at Nassau Country Club, Hempstead, NY before moving to Knollwood Country Club, NY in 1896.\n\nDuring the winter of 1896, Anderson travelled back to Scotland and returned in February the following year with Harry Reddie, a school friend from North Berwick. Harry was a caddie on the West Links and was appointed greenkeeper and pro at Saint Andrews Golf Club, New York. When Anderson moved to Lakewood Golf Club NY, Harry Reddie replaced him as pro at Misquamicut in 1898.\n\nIn December 1899 Willie Anderson travelled to California with Horace Rawlins where they played in exhibition matches and taught the game. They were hired as instructors to Oakland Golf Club and entered the Pacific Coast Open Tournament in 1900 which Anderson won. He also won the Southern California Open at Coronado Golf Club, in San Diego.\n\nIn 1899 David Stephenson joined Robert Johnstone from North Berwick at San Francisco Golf Club where they played in demonstration matches. On his return northeast Anderson signed up with Apawamis Golf Club, MA. In 1901 Willie Anderson was persuaded by John D. Dunn to winter in Florida. Dunn was employed by the Florida West Coast Railroad Company to develop their golfing hotels. During Anderson's three-days in Florida he entered tournaments at Magnolia Beach and Tampa Bay. Robert Johnstone brother of John Johnstone listed above moved from California to Seattle in Washington State where he laid out the Seattle golf course.\n\nJack Hobens emigrated to America in January 1900 and was accompanied on the journey by Tom Anderson Snr, former North Berwick head greenkeeper and his son Thomas Jnr. brother of US Open Champion Willie Anderson. Hoben's first position was at Nutley Golf Club, NJ in 1900. In April that year Tom Anderson Snr. took up a position ten miles away at Montclair Country Club. In 1901 Hobens moved less than five miles to Glen Ridge Golf Club. In 1902 George Thomson from North Berwick took over at Yountakah when Jack Hobens moved to Glen Ridge, situated in the northeastern region of Essex County in New Jersey. In 1902, Jack returned to Yountakah where he stayed until 1904. The following year he moved to Englewood Country Club where he was the pro for over seventeen years. Emglewood was described as a 'colourful' place featuring many show business and Mafia personalities.\n\nJack Forrester sailed to America from Glasgow on the S.S. Columbia and arrived in New York on 8th March 1920. His contact was Carl H. Anderson manager of the golf equipment store Thomas E. Wilson & Co, in the Emporia building at 25 West, 45th Street, New York. Forrester was appointed pro at Meadow Brook Golf Club, New Jersey in 1921. He laid out the course at Hollywood (Oradell) NJ. (1923-25) and won the Mid-South Open at Pinehurst N.C in December 1928. He moved to Baltusrol NJ (1926-28) and then to Oradell NJ (1929) before moving to Hackensack Golf Club, NJ (1930-34) when he won the New Jersey PGA Championship at Braidburn Country Club.\n\nHarry Reddie also played in the pro tournament at Ocean County Hunt and Country Club, Lakewood, NJ on New Years Day 1898. Reddie was representing St Andrews Golf Club, Yonkers, NY. According to the New York Times the field also included North Berwick pros, Harry Gullane, Robert M. Thomson, Jack Litster, Willie Anderson, Jamie Campbell and Tom Harley. The Fitzjohn brothers played-off for the first prize. Tom Harley from Aberlady won the first Canadian Amateur Championship in 1895. Harley joined the professional ranks and was appointed golf instructor at the North Jersey Golf Club. Tom Harley also played in the pro tournament at Ocean County Hunt and Country Club, Lakewood, NY on New Years Day 1898.

He was promoted from the rank of sergeant to major, was mentioned in dispatches twice by Sir Douglas Haig, and awarded the D.C.M. In March 1915 a report in the Haddingtonshire Courier told the story of how Colour Sergeant Alex Denholm was dispatched with the 1st Canadian Division to France in February and became part of the First British Army under Haig. As thousands of troops massed behind the Allied lines in preparation for Haig's offensive at Neuve Chapelle, Alex Denholm almost literally bumped into his brother Jock, a Sergeant with the 8th Royal Scots. In great excitement the pair went looking for their younger brother Robert, who was also in the Royal Scots.

The trophy took the form of a silver reproduction of an 18-pounder German shell which had been captured from the Turks by Australian soldiers.\n\nAn article in the Sydney Morning Herald in 1933 entitled 'The Golfing Denholm Brothers', discribed how Alex Denholm was competing in the Queensland Professional Open on the banks of the Brisbane river, while in the background, Alex's brother George D. Denholm, the purser on the liner Jervis Bay, had just arrived from London, and swept up stream past the golfers. The Jervis Bay was owned by the shipping company Aberdeen and Commonwealth Liners which berthed at Hamilton Cold Stores Wharf on the Brisbane River.

In 1930, Bob Denholm was invited to represent Great Britain and Ireland in the Walker Cup team but declined because it was too expensive. George D. Denholm with a handicap of two (Scottish Grading) played his golf on the municipal course in Victoria Park, Brisbane. Their father, a foreman joiner died in 1935 and did not play golf.\n\nNorman Von Nadi, a young caddie at Royal Queensland Golf Club under the supervision of Alex Denholm, became the first Australia born golf professional to win on the British PGA Tour.

Also in the American party was Jimmy Thomson and his wife film star Viola Dana. Jimmy Thomson (listed below) was originally from North Berwick and his father Wilfred Thomson attended North Berwick Public School at the same time as Alex Denholm. In the International match Alex finished all square against the American Harry Cooper and according to the Australian press this was one of Alex's finest golfing moments. To complete the North Berwick connection Jimmy Thomson won the Melbourne Centenary Trophy.\n\nAlex Denholm was one of only a handful of pro's in Australia to have a range of golf clubs stamped with their own name. His branded clubs were sold in the sports department of W.J Overell & Sons, The Valley, Brisbane. The heads were forged in Scotland and comprised of a brassie, mid-iron, mashie and putter. Recently a set of clubs form the 1930s branded with Alex's name were sold at auction for $750 . The irons had hand forged heads and steel shafts, while the woods had hickory shafts. They were branded with A.G. Spalding Bros. and Alex Denholm.\n\nIn July 1942, Denholm was pictured in the Courier-Mall (Brisbane) newspaper, working a drilling lathe in a munitions factory during WW2. When Alex retired in 1947, Len King secretary at Royal Queensland during the period Alex was pro, organised a fund raising committee for a memorial to Alex's twenty years with the club. Several of the Brisbane club's held an Open Golf Day with all proceeds going to the fund, including Royal Queensland, Tattersall's Golfing Society at Nudgee and Indooroopilly.

At the professional tournament to celebrate the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932 he played with Peter Merrilees (below) from North Berwick. Peter was two years older and they both attended the Public School in School Road.\n\nMosman or 'Swaggerdom' as the Sydney Labour Daily dubbed the members of Mosman Golf Club, which reflected the 'snobbery' attached to golf in Australia at the time. Like most clubs in Australia, women were associate members, had no voting rights and were not allowed to play on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons or public holidays, a restriction on women golfers that remained until the passage of equal opportunity legislation in 1984. The nine-hole course at Mosman Golf Club was commandeered by the military during WW2 and consequently the course was closed by the Australian Government in 1940. Following WW2 Duncan Denholm joined the NSW Police Department.
