        "text": "Well then, after a pretty epic and fun filled twelve (!!!) years at Universal Production Music, I am leaving for a new role & challenge at the end of July. Iâ€™ve been here long enough to see a fair few ups and downs over the years ðŸ‘€ However it has been a huge privilege to work with such a dynamic and innovative team who have partnered with some of the industryâ€™s best brands/companies and pushed what production music can be to a new level. Iâ€™ve met a huge amount of the UKâ€™s most inspiring and creative individuals and synced thousands of hours of music to some incredible content. I leave with fantastic memories, friends and stories to tell. If we are currently working on anything together or you need some great production music for a new project then get in touch. I have a couple more weeks to wrap things up at Universal towers and Iâ€™ll happily make sure you are looked after by the great team here. After a bit of time off at the start of August, Iâ€™ll be excited to get stuck into my new role. Hopefully Iâ€™ll be working with a large number of you again in the near future, announcement on that soon. Thanks to everyone who made the twelve years here so brilliant, couldnâ€™t have done it without you!\n\nEdit: This accidentally blew up. Thanks for all the interest and applications. Unfortunately we can't get back to everyone but I appreciate all those who enquired and applied. I'm hiring! Looking for an easy going, organised and enthusiastic junior music supervisor; someone who loves digging out the best tunes and most importantly has a great ear for music across multiple styles. We're a busy and exciting team / department, with lots of fantastic projects to get stuck in to across advertising, gaming, film, sports, TV and more. If interested apply below or feel free to share. Applications close soon. Thanks!"
