        "text": "I recently had the pleasure of visiting the Tynecastle Park Hotel, situated within the iconic #Tynecastle Football Stadium, and I can't recommend it highly enough! The hotel boasts 25 modern rooms, each designed with luxury in mind. The spacious rooms feature premium bedding, Molton Brown toiletries and a Maroon GHD® hairdryer - the attention to detail is truly impressive! The Roseburn Rooms which offer live stream of either the Tynecastle Park pitch, or the Castle Skyline has to be my favourite! Beyond the excellent rooms, the hotel offers a range of amenities, including an on-site restaurant, a club lounge, and several meeting and event spaces that are ideal for #MICE conferences or training days. Whether you're a football fan or not, the Tynecastle Park Hotel provides a unique and unforgettable experience for all. Thank you once again to Valerie Grace Mentiplay-Kerr for your time to show me around and to James Brosnan for arranging it - I already know our guests visiting Edinburgh are going to love it as much as I did! jetlogic - Jet Charter Specialists Heart of Midlothian FC #TynecastlePark #EdinburghHotel #Hospitality #MICE #VisitScotland\n\nThis summer, Big Hearts Community Trust welcomed 47 young people to School's Out!, our holiday club for local pupils facing social isolation. Thanks to funding from Forth One's Cash for kids, the Scottish FA's Extra Time Fund and The Pleasance Trust, participants enjoyed a brilliant 2 weeks of activities and day trips! ❤️ Receiving feedback is beneficial to our charity and allows us to plan and improve on future activities! ℹ️ https://lnkd.in/ezDKCkb6"
