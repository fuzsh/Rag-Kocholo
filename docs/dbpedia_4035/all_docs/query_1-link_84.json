        "text": "In his first competitive start for the Jam Tarts, Dhanda came close to scoring, hitting the crossbar during a tightly contested match against Rangers at Tynecastle Park on Saturday.\n\nWhile the game ended in a stalemate, many observers felt that Hearts had the upper hand in terms of chances created.\n\nHowever, both goalkeepers, Zander Clark and Jack Butland, were instrumental in ensuring a goalless draw.\n\nLooking ahead, Dhanda remains optimistic about the season and was asked if he believes Hearts can realistically compete with the Glasgow giants, who have dominated the top-flight since the Aberdeen triumphed during the 1984-85 season.\n\nDhanda's response reflects a strong belief in the capabilities of Steven Naismith's squad as they aim for the top.\n\nRead more:\n\nRaith Rovers sack Ian Murray after 'falling short of expectations'\n\nPositive fan/player connection important for Aberdeen to be successful\n\n“Yes, definitely,\" he told BBC Scotland. \"I think we can go past the top two. We have shown how good we can be, so what’s stopping us?\n\n\"As long as we keep believing the talent we have in the changing room and the togetherness along with the staff and the group of players, we can do anything this season. I think the most important thing is just keep believing.”"
