        "text": "Dundee’s trip to the capital ended in disappointment when they couldn’t hold on to a two goal lead and were beaten 3-2 at Tynecastle by Hearts. Goals from Jordan McGhee and Lyall Cameron gave the Dee a well deserved lead at half time. However, the Dark Blues couldn’t hold out when the Jam Tarts fought back after the restart. Calem Nieuwenhof, Dexter Lembikisa and Yutaro Oda scored the goals that gave Hearts the win.\n\nThere were five changes to the Dee team tonight following Saturday’s cup defeat at Kilmarnock. Trevor Carson, Lyall Cameron, Malachi Boateng and Zach Robinson all returned to the starting eleven, and Owen Dodgson was given his first start. They replaced Adam Legzdins, who was injured, and Ryan Howley, Josh Mulligan, Mo Sylla and Scott Tiffoney, who were all named as subs.\n\nHearts dominated possession in the opening minutes without troubling the Dee defence. Dundee were first to create any danger after six minutes. A short corner allowed Luke McCowan to send a dangerous cross into the goalmouth. It was cleared, but in the second phase Amadou Bakayoko’s cross created a scramble with two Dee shots blocked.\n\nHearts could have taken the lead from a corner after 15 minutes. Stephen Kingsley sent a near post glancing header flying across goal and wide.\n\nThe Dark Blues opened the scoring four minutes later. Zach Robinson must have thought he’d scored when he connected perfectly with Bakayoko’s cross to sent his header arrowing inside the far post, but Zander Clark pulled off a superb save. The escape was fleeting because Luke McCowan’s deep cross was touched back for Jordan MCGHEE to score from 18 yards with a beautiful curling shot away from Clark and inside the far post. The goal was initially disallowed for offside against Bakayoko. However, a VAR review established that the Dee striker was played onside by a defender’s foot and the goal stood.\n\nDundee grew in confidence and started to move the ball around smoothly in midfield. Robinson thrilled the travelling support with a run in from the wing that took him past four players into the penalty area, but the fifth stopped him.\n\nHearts only chance in the remainder of the first half was a first time shot by Lawrence Shankland, which flew well over the bar from 10 yards.\n\nOn 38 minutes Dundee took a two goal lead, punishing Hearts for slackness as they tried to build from the back. Dara Costelloe intercepted a crossfield pass and sent Lyall CAMERON in to score with a lovely low finish across Clark.\n\nThe Dark Blues ended the half well on top, playing impressive, composed football in midfield, holding Hearts at bay, and looking dangerous when they came forward.\n\nDundee continued in the same form at the start of the second half. McCowan sent a 20 yard free kick just over the crossbar. That was the important midfielder’s last contribution because he was then replaced by Josh Mulligan.\n\nHearts had been struggling to get through the Dundee defence, but forced their way back into the game with a goal from nothing after 57 minutes. Calem NIEUWENHOF didn’t seem to have many options when he took possession in space 40 yards from goal. However, there was no challenge, and he advanced to hit a perfectly struck low shot from 30 yards inside Carson’s right hand post.\n\nThe Jam Tarts were given the perfect opportunity to get back on level terms midway through the half when they were awarded a penalty after another lengthy VAR review. Owen Dodgson was judged to have pushed Shankland as a cross came over.\n\nShankland’s spot kick was firm and well directed, but Carson somehow pulled off a magnificent save.\n\nThe setback checked the momentum that Hearts were building and the game went through a scrappy spell which suited Dundee. However, the Jam Tarts gradually put their game together again and cranked up the pressure on Dundee.\n\nHearts eventually broke through after 74 minutes. First half substitute Alan Forrest reached the byline, perhaps too easily, and crossed for Dexter LEMBIKISA to score with a header across Carson and inside the far post.\n\nA couple of minutes later the Dark Blues were awarded a penalty when Craig Halkett fouled Malachi Boateng as he ran into the penalty area. Again the VAR penalty review went Hearts way, and less controversially this time; the foul was just outside the line. Owen Dodgson’s free kick was cleared.\n\nDundee looked like they could hold out for a deserved point. However, they were beaten by a fine finish from substitute Yutaro ODA after 86 minutes. The Japanese striker spun on a pass from Forrest and beat Carson from 16 yards.\n\nThere were eight minutes of added time. Dundee had a go at saving the game, but it wasn’t to be. Charlie Reilly again made a big impression coming off the bench. He always looked dangerous running at the Hearts defence but none of his crosses fell for a teammate.\n\nDundee had Hearts in real trouble for the first 57 minutes until Nieuwenhof’s goal arrived out of the blue. They played the better football and were the more dangerous team in the final third. However, Hearts’ first goal transformed the game and Dundee fell out of the match. The Jam Tarts took over and Dundee’s defence couldn’t hold out. When Hearts equalised there was only going to be one winner.\n\nHearts might be well clear in third place, but it is nevertheless very disappointing to return from Tynecastle with nothing after a narrow defeat. This was a new experience for many of Dundee’s young players and they can take pride and confidence from the level of their performance for much of the game, but they will have to learn from tonight’s painful lesson. There was lots to admire from the Dee tonight. They could easily have have claimed a memorable result. It didn’t pan out the way we wanted, but there is plenty to build on in this team, if the right lessons are learned.\n\nHearts 4-4-2\n\nClark\n\nKent, Halkett, Kingsley\n\nLembiska, Baningime (Tait 56), Denham (Forrest 32), Nieuwenhof, Cochrane (Grant at half time)\n\nShankland (c), Vargas (Oda 73)\n\nUnused subs: Gordon (gk), Sibbick, Pollock, Tagawa, Wilson.\n\nGoals: Nieuwenhof (57), Lembikisa (74), Oda (86).\n\nBooked: Lembikisa (foul on Costelloe).\n\nDundee FC 3-5-2\n\nCarson\n\nAshcroft, Shaughnessy (c), Dodgson\n\nMcGhee, Cameron, Boateng, McCowan (Mulligan 49), Costelloe\n\nBakayoko (Reilly 80), Robinson (Main 70)\n\nUnused substitutes: Sharp (gk), Astley, Tiffoney, Howley, Robertson, Sylla.\n\nGoals: McGhee (19), Cameron (38).\n\nBooked: McGhee (foul on Cochrane), Costelloe (timewasting), Bakayoko (foul on Halkett), Dodgson (Shankland penalty incident), Main (simulation), Ashcroft (foul on Clark).\n\nReferee: Chris Graham.
