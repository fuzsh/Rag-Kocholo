        "text": "Saturday 13 January 2018, 13.45, Paties Road Stadium\n\nEdinburgh United against West Calder United in the East Region South Division.\n\nOur second game of the season in the South league after seeing Lochgelly Albert and Rosyth in December. We’d also seen Edinburgh United at Pumpherston in the East of Scotland Cup in September and Easthouses Lily Miners Welfare, when they faced Bonnyrigg Rose in the Fife and Lothians Cup.\n\nThe game was originally scheduled to be played at West Calder’s Hermand Park, but with their pitch unplayable, the fixture was reversed to Paties Road.\n\nEdinburgh United came into the game in second spot, seven points behind leaders Pumpherston. The chasing pack all had games in hand on the capital side, one of which were West Calder United, who were three points behind with two games in hand.\n\nUnited have been challenging at the top of the league since the season’s start, but have fallen away in recent weeks. Their last six league games have only seen one victory and three defeats. Most recently they lost 3-0 at leaders Pumpherston. They needed to get back on track as quickly as possible.\n\nIt’d been a number of years since we had seen West Calder United.\n\nThere isn’t much information available in terms of West Calder United’s history, but they were formed in 1950.\n\nThe new century saw them playing in the South Juniors East Division 2 and they were finishing in pretty lowly positions. When reorganisation came for season 2002-03, they became members of the Lothian Region Division B, which was renamed Division Two the following season.\n\nFurther reorganisation saw them in the East Region South Division for season 2006-07. They have been finishing in the bottom half in the majority of seasons since then, although they were sixth of fourteen in 2009 and 2010.\n\nLast season saw another sixth place finish and this season is looking a lot more promising for the men from West Lothian. They have, however, also been struggling a bit in recent games.\n\nThey’ve won one in their last five, which was a 4-0 win against Lochgelly, but have lost the other four, conceding 16 goals in the process. Their most recent game had seen them lose 6-5 at Harthill Royal.\n\nBoth sides were therefore in need of a win to keep their promotion hopes alive.\n\nArguably West Calder’s most notable game this season had been their Fife and Lothians Cup tie against Super League side Bo’ness United in October. With West Calder leading 2-0 at half time a shock was on the cards, but Bo’ness came back in the second half to tie the score before winning on penalties.\n\nStrangely, it was the first time we had been to Paties Road Stadium.\n\nThe ground sits in the Colinton area of the city, with tennis facilities nearby. The area also has woodland that have paths to the Water of Leith.\n\nA covered stand dominates one side of the pitch which also houses toilets, a pie stand, changing rooms and a nursery. A fence surrounds the area the pitch is in with grass standing areas on the other three sides which extend beyond the fence. A nice setting.\n\nThere were around 40 in attendance.\n\nIn the second minute, Edinburgh’s Johnson was caught by a late tackle from Mochan as he cleared the ball. The referee didn’t see it.\n\nInglis turned well on the edge of the Edinburgh box in 7 minutes before being brought down by Young. I don’t think he got booked for the challenge, but I was distracted by my watch having stopped at this point.\n\nMcInnes stepped up to take the free kick and placed it right into the corner past the despairing dive of Newman to give the visitors an early lead.\n\nEdinburgh’s Conlon got the ball in the face from close range in 10 minutes and went down. He was soon back on his feet, but the referee insisted he go off for what must have been blood on his face. He was quickly back on.\n\nMcLaren took the ball down the right for West Calder in 13 minutes and went past three Edinburgh players before poking the ball across goal, but Johnson sent the ball behind.\n\nThere was almost disaster for Edinburgh in 15 minutes when Newman passed the ball to Young without realising Mochan was in close proximity. The West Calder player stole the ball, but his shot was recovered by Newman.\n\nHendrie was unhappy with a challenge from West Calder’s Nicol in 16 minutes, but the referee was content to just award the free kick.\n\nMcInnes was causing real problems for the Edinburgh defence with his quick feet and direct running on the left.\n\nA good ball down the left by Edinburgh’s Flynn in 24 minutes found Hendry, but Fyffe got a cross to block the ball for a corner.\n\nMearns lost the ball to McLaughlin in 25 minutes after a heavy touch and he picked up a yellow card for fouling him to prevent his progress.\n\nIn 31 minutes, Hendry had a shot at the West Calder goal from 22 yards, but it was well wide of the target.\n\nHamilton showed a good bit of skill deep in his own box in 32 minutes to turn away from Flynn, although the West Calder keeper had taken quite a risk.\n\nA good run by Edinburgh’s Subasic in 34 minutes took him into the box, but he was halted by a fine Nicol tackle. The ball came to Hendry who saw his powerful shot blocked.\n\nFlynn had a shot at the West Calder goal from outside the box in 42 minutes which was well held by Hamilton.\n\nEdinburgh came forward again a minute later with a good ball to Hendry on the left, but his low effort was saved by Hamilton.\n\nWest Calder broke in 44 minutes and Mochan got through a couple of challenges to get into the box and got the break of the ball off Newman, but it forced him wide and his ball from the by-line was cleared.\n\nJohnson got into the West Calder box in first half injury time and as he crossed into the middle he was caught by a defender and the referee pointed to the spot. Johnson took the penalty himself and put it right in the corner to level the score.\n\nOne each at the break and it had been a very competitive first half. There certainly had been no lack of commitment from either side, but there were a lot of loose passes and possession was changing hands rapidly.\n\nMcLaren and McInnes had caused Edinburgh real problems from the flanks, but they had both faded out of the game as the half progressed. McInnes in particular had looked almost unplayable in the opening 20 minutes, but hadn’t touched the ball much since. The hosts all action midfield had hauled them back into the game after a poor start.\n\nEdinburgh United have a rather novel approach to half time entertainment.\n\nThe home side started the second half on the front foot with Hendry taking the ball down the left in 49 minutes and playing a one-two with Flynn and getting to the by-line. His chipped cross was lifted over everyone in the middle and the chance was gone.\n\nNicol was booked in 51 minutes for a foul on Hendrie just inside the West Calder half. As they waited for the free kick in the West Calder box, Edinburgh’s Johnson and West Calder’s Cooper were having a full blown hug. I’ve no idea what brought this on, but the free kick was headed away.\n\nThere looked to be at least 10 more people in the crowd in the second half.\n\nWith 56 minutes gone, McLaren played the ball through the Edinburgh defence for Mochan. With the whole defence screaming for offside, the referee gave it. The visiting players were not happy.\n\nI’ve said before how difficult it must be for referees when they have no assistants, and defenders of all teams claim for offside every time the ball is played forward.\n\nEdinburgh’s Hendry was cautioned in 61 minutes for a lunge at Cooper, who managed to jump out of the way of the brunt of the challenge, which was probably just as well.\n\nIn 63 minutes, West Calder’s Mochan was the next player in the referee’s notebook for a tackle on McAleavey. He looked like he may have won the ball from where I was. The free kick was played into the box and Hamilton punched it clear. Fyffe was left prone in the box as play raged to the other end. Nearly everyone on and off the pitch was shouting to the ref that he was down (and didn’t look like he had moved) and after the West Calder attack had broken down he eventually realised,\n\nAs the referee made his way to the injured player one of the West Calder subs told him that everyone had been shouting to him. Hamilton in goal responded to his team mate with “It was alright if we’d scored, the ref wasn’t going to cure him!”\n\nDevine threaded the ball through for Mochan in 65 minutes, but Newman was quickly out of the Edinburgh goal to smother.\n\nA break of the ball sent Hendry running through on the left for Edinburgh in 67 minutes. He looked as if he may have been offside, but got to the ball near the by-line before being caught by Hamilton. The West Calder keeper was the latest player booked.\n\nHendry sent the free kick low into the box and found Hendrie, but he blasted over.\n\nDevine looked like he was through on the Edinburgh goal in 71 minutes, but was given offside.\n\nMcAleavey played the ball into the West Calder box from the left in 74 minutes and it went over everyone in the box. Subasic retrieved it and nutmegged Tinning. As he raced into the box, Tinning brought him down and it was another Edinburgh penalty.\n\nJohnson sent Hamilton the wrong way to put Edinburgh in front.\n\nWest Calder won a corner in 76 minutes and McInnes’ cross was met by a thumping header from Devine. Newman got his fingertips to it and touched it onto the bar. Devine was first to the rebound but under pressure, could only nod wide. A great save by the keeper.\n\nEdinburgh’s Mearns and West Calder’s Devine went into a crunching tackle with each other in 77 minutes and Devine was shown a yellow card. It had looked to me as though it might have gone the other way, but the referee was well placed.\n\nWhen West Calder won a free kick about 22 yards out in 79 minutes, one of the Edinburgh defenders wasn’t happy with the speed that the wall was being formed. He shouted “Will four midfielders get in the bastarding wall!” McInnes’ free kick was blocked by the bastarding wall.\n\nHendry burst into the West Calder box in 80 minutes but was stopped by a fantastic tackle from Nicol.\n\nWhen Edinburgh’s Flynn was substituted in 82 minutes, he went as far away from the bench as possible, then kept stopping to fix his boot on the way off. The West Calder players made their feelings known.\n\nConlon was the next to receive a yellow card. The Edinburgh player fouling McLaren in 84 minutes.\n\nWest Calder were bending over backwards to try and get an equaliser.\n\nA McInnes cross into the Edinburgh box in 86 minutes saw Devine win the ball in the air against keeper Newman to nod the ball down, but McAleavey was there to hammer the ball clear.\n\nTwo minutes into injury time, Hendry played the ball forward to Auriemma who went down under the challenge of Fyffe, who insisted he hadn’t touched him. Johnson put the free kick well over the bar.\n\nThere was still time for a final West Calder chance when they won a free kick. Keeper Hamilton went up for it. Adams crossed into the area and there was a scramble in the Edinburgh box and at least two different claims for handball before the defence eventually got the ball away.\n\nThe final whistle blew soon after with West Calder’s McLaren booked for complaining afterwards.\n\nA vital win for the hosts and a disappointing one for the visitors. The game could easily have gone either way with chances at both ends and plenty of decisions that may or may not have been correct. The game was littered with fouls and how nobody got sent off was beyond me.\n\nIt was, however, a game that certainly held the attention with both teams desperate to win and everyone on the park could claim to have given their all.\n\nBest for Edinburgh were Conlon and Mearns, who got through a power of work in midfield and Johnson who was involved in all the big plays. For West Calder, McLaren and McInnes were both good in parts, but didn’t sustain their performance for 90 minutes. Nicol was outstanding in defence.\n\nThanks to Edinburgh United’s twitter account for some help with their team.\n\nFull Time: Edinburgh United 2 West Calder United 1\n\nAdmission: £5\n\nEdinburgh United: 1 Jamie Newman, 8 Daryl Johnson, 5 Jim Young, 10 Sean Conaghan, 3 Daniel McAleavey, 12 Chris Hendrie, 4 Eddie Mearns, 6 Shaun Conlon (Grieve 90), 2 Ano Subasic (Murray 88), 21 Jim Flynn (Auriemma 82), 7 Taylor Hendry.

The vast majority of Junior sides do not have games scheduled over the festive period, with the arrangement in the East that teams can request fixtures. That was until the Junior Cup Third Round ties kept getting postponed. All the unresolved ties were moved to the 23rd and would then be pencilled in for the 30th if they were off again.\n\nWith milder weather all week, this resulted in us heading to the Junior Cup tie between East Premier side Downfield and West Central League Division 1 side Wishaw Juniors. It had been a toss-up between this and Lochee United v Johnstone Burgh, but the away side there withdrew as they could not field a team.\n\nIt was a case of fifth time lucky for this tie, with 4 previous postponements.\n\nDownfield do exactly what it says on the tin. They play in the Downfield area of Dundee at Downfield Park.\n\nThey were founded in 1904 and are known as ‘The Spiders’. This comes from the same term applied to Queen’s Park as Downfield play in the same narrow black-and-white hooped shirt. When Downfield were first founded, Queen’s donated a set of strips to them to assist with the start-up.\n\nIt’s maybe because they have that nickname that there seems to be a web of secrecy about their history. There is very little to be found online about the early years of the club or, for that matter, after that.\n\nIt isn’t clear if Downfield have been in existence the whole time since their formation, as the first trophy they seem to have won was in 1987, when they began a great period of success. The cups came thick and fast as they won the Tayside Premier Division three times in a row at the end of the ‘80s.\n\nThe trophies continued until 1995, until there was a ten year gap before the next silverware, the Division One title in 2004-05.\n\nLeague reconstruction prior to the 2006–07 season, saw Downfield find themselves in the twelve-team East Region, North Division, where they finished third in their first season in the division. They’ve won the North Division three times, in 2010-11, 2014-15 and 2015-16. They currently play in the East Premier Division.\n\nLast season saw Downfield finish in tenth place, whereas this season has been tough. They sat in thirteenth with ten defeats from their 16 games, and just four wins. The three teams below them all had several games in hand.\n\nThey hadn’t played a league game since 18 November due to several postponements.\n\nDownfield won 3-2 at Neilston in the second round, after getting a first round bye. Neilston play in the same league as Wishaw.\n\nWe saw Wishaw in their second round replay at Arniston Rangers on 4 November when they won 3-2. (Arniston are in the same league as Downfield). We hadn’t expected to be seeing them in the next round, but circumstances meant that we would.\n\nThey had continued their league challenge, having won six of the eight league games they had played. Their last league game was also on 18 November.\n\nIt’s a first visit to Downfield Park for us and it’s a neat and tidy place with a big social club attached. A small enclosure is opposite the side with the club and changing rooms and there is a portacabin selling food and drink. There is grass banking behind both goals.\n\nI was unable to get a response from Downfield on social media, so I do not have their full team. Apologies for any errors in the ones I do have. Thanks to Wishaw’s Facebook team for providing their names and numbers.\n\nThere were around 70 in attendance.\n\nThe game was just two minutes old when Wishaw’s Collinder went down in the Downfield box, but the referee waved away penalty appeals.\n\nTimmons broke down the right for Downfield and his cross was cleared back to him. He returned it to the front post where Blackwood got there first to turn the ball into the net and give the hosts an early lead.\n\nThe goalscorer was caught as he scored and was down for several minutes and required treatment before rejoining play.\n\nWith 9 minutes gone, Timmons played the ball up the right to Davidson. He played it to Blackwood who laid the ball into the path of Hagen on the edge of the box. He curled it into the corner to double Downfield’s lead.\n\nWishaw looked shell shocked, but created their first opportunity in 12 minutes, when Dan Kindlan found some space on the corner of the box, but sent his low shot straight at Sloan.\n\nDan Kindlan was involved again in 14 minutes, sending a free kick into the Downfield box which saw Coffey rise well, but head over.\n\nThe visitors continued to look for a way back into the game and McCafferty tried his luck from the edge of the box in 15 minutes, but his half volley was a couple of feet too high.\n\nBlackwood had failed to shake off his injury and was replaced in 21 minutes. A blow for Downfield as he had scored the first goal and made the second.\n\nDavidson caused more problems for Wishaw down the right in 22 minutes as he got to the bye-line and cut the ball back for number 12. His shot was half blocked and when it came back to Davidson, he was offside.\n\nIt was Downfield’s turn to shout for a penalty in 23 minutes when Colquhoun went down, but again, the referee wasn’t interested.\n\nA Wishaw free kick in 25 minutes struck Hagen in the Downfield wall, with the referee stopping play for the injury with Wishaw still on the attack. He restarted with a bounce up just outside the Downfield box on the right.\n\nWishaw’s Dean Kindlan picked up the game’s first booking in 28 minutes for a late tackle on number 12. The free kick into the box was cleared but came to Hagan 20 yards out, but he shot wide.\n\nA clearance by Duell in 29 minutes sent Cameron racing through on the Wishaw goal, but he was halted by a late flag. It looked from where I was as if the striker had been unlucky to be penalised.\n\nDan Kindlan went up the right for Wishaw in 30 minutes and played the ball back to McCafferty, but his shot was well off target.\n\nThe Lanarkshire side came forward again in 33 minutes and Dan Kindlan played a one-two with McGeough which took him into the Downfield box and he slotted past Sloan to put Wishaw right back in it.\n\nTwo minutes later, Downfield’s number 6 lost possession inside his own box and Coffey cut the ball back into the path of McCafferty who fired low into the corner for the equaliser.\n\nA long range effort from the left by Wishaw in 37 minutes was turned behind by Sloan.\n\nWhenever Downfield keeper Sloan was in possession of the ball, he seemed to be taking an age to play it. On one particularly lengthy occasion, the Wishaw bench suggested that someone tell him there was “still another half to go.”\n\nWith a minute to half time, Duell was short with an attempted head back to Sloan and McCafferty latched onto it. He was forced wide and Sloan managed to block the ball behind.\n\nWishaw’s Collinder was booked in 45 minutes for a rugby tackle on Davidson on the half way line.\n\nIn first half injury time Downfield’s number 6 won the ball and lifted it into the Wishaw box. Cameron won the header, but the ball drifted over the bar. He stayed down after receiving a knock as he headed it. The Wishaw bench helpfully advised that he was alright, as he was “just tired.”\n\nTwo each at the break and yet again Junior football confounds the old ‘game of two halves’ adage, with a half of two halves. There are often 6 or 7 different halves in 90 minutes…..\n\nWishaw created a decent chance in 49 minutes with Dan Kindlan and McCafferty involved in setting up Grant on the right of the box, but Sloan saved.\n\nMcCafferty got to the Downfield bye-line in 55 minutes, but his ball across goal didn’t find a team mate.\n\nDuell tried his luck from around 22 yards in 62 minutes, but it sailed over the Wishaw bar.\n\nIt was Wishaw’s turn to lose someone to injury when right back Martin limped off in 68 minutes.\n\nHagan crossed into the Wishaw box in 69 minutes and the ball was met by the head of Colquhoun who watched it thump off the base of the post with Thomson beaten. The defence got the ball away.\n\nDownfield’s number 3 was the next to have a go from distance, but his 25 yard effort was well over the bar.\n\nThe crosses of Hagan were causing problems for the Wishaw defence and another ball in from the left by him found Davidson’s head, but he nodded over.\n\nWishaw broke forward in 76 minutes and McCafferty played the ball to Smillie. His shot was well saved by Sloan. The rebound came to Coffey whose shot was cleared off the line.\n\nColquhoun was cautioned in 78 minutes for taking out Wishaw’s Dean Kindlan.\n\nDan Kindlan put a great cross into the Downfield box in 80 minutes, but the defence managed to get the ball away.\n\nDownfield won a corner in 81 minutes and Thomson punched Hagan’s delivery clear. Number 15 for Downfield fired it back at goal, but the keeper was down well to save.\n\nHagan swung another ball into the Wishaw box in 83 minutes which Thomson punched behind. Number 12’s corner saw a glancing header from number 6, but it flashed wide.\n\nWith 5 minutes to go Downfield’s number 15 had a shot which whistled past the post.\n\nIn the final minute, Smillie played the ball to the feet of Dan Kindlan in the Downfield box. He turned quickly and rifled a shot inches wide of the post.\n\nAs we reached injury time Wishaw’s Dan Kindlan was yellow carded for a late tackle on Duell.\n\nIn the third minute of injury time Hagan latched onto a loose ball 23 yards from the Wishaw goal, but his shot was too high.\n\nAll square at the end and after the game going ahead at the fifth time of asking, they would now have to replay.\n\nAn entertaining game and one that could have gone either way. Credit to both teams for getting the ball down and playing some good football on a windy afternoon.\n\nBest for Downfield were Hagan, Davidson and the number 6. For Wishaw, McCafferty and McGeough played well and Crawford was solid at the back.\n\nFull Time: Downfield 2 Wishaw Juniors 2\n\nAdmission: £6\n\nDownfield: 21 Ryan Sloan, 2 Jordan Timmons, 5 Bryan Duell, 4 Charlie Cargill, 3 , 7 Dale Davidson (15 77), 8 Calvin Colquhoun, 6 , 11 Philip Hagan, 9 Lee Cameron, 10 Paul Blackwood (12 21).

With the previous weekend also meaning several postponements, there were a large number of Junior Cup ties to choose from.\n\nWe decided upon a trip to Fife to see East Region South Division’s Crossgates Primrose against West Super League Premier side Beith Juniors.\n\nJust as we arrived in Dunfermline, the news broke that the game had been called off. About 35 minutes before kick off. We quickly scanned the fixtures and saw that the nearest game that looked to be on was Lochgelly, so we headed there. It was hard not to start thinking about the fiasco we had in Fife in February – which you can find at https://gameofthrowinssite.wordpress.com/2017/02/10/football-in-fife/\n\nWe managed to find our way to Gardiners Park, a first visit to the home of Lochgelly Albert.\n\nLochgelly Albert were formed in 1926 and began life as an amateur team. The most common reason given for their name, is that it was taken from the town of Albert, which was involved in the battle of the Somme, during the First World War. Several men from Lochgelly and the surrounding area fought near the town of Albert in northern France.\n\nWith the senior side Lochgelly United folding just before the start of the war, Albert brought football back to the town. They joined the Junior ranks in 1933 and won their first trophy, the Fife Cup in 1934-35. A feat they have repeated a further 5 times. While never one of the giants of the Junior game, they have picked up trophies throughout their history, including being Fife League Champions 5 times. The vast majority of their silverware came in the 1930s, ‘50s and ‘70s. The last trophy to come to Gardiners Park was the Beckett Cup in 1993. Their first trophy since 1978.\n\nWith three changes to the league structure since the new century began, Albert are now in the East Region South Division. Recent seasons have seen the club improve their league position every season, with finishes since 2013-14 of ninth, eighth, fifth and fourth. Improvement again this season would see a promotion challenge.\n\nComing into the game, Albert sat in sixth, with six wins, two draws and three losses. They had a game in hand on most of their rivals and were certainly not out of the promotion chase.\n\nWith major work on the pitch having taken place, Albert played all their games away from home until the end of September.\n\nThere have been several comings and goings since last season, with the departures of Andy Watt, Craig Paterson, Lewis Elder, Scott Gibson, John Ferguson, Ryan Robertson, Lee Wilson and club legend Stevie Brown, who had been with the club for 13 seasons.\n\nComing in have been strikers Calum Geddes, from Kirkcaldy YM, Liam Forbes from Thornton Hibs and Ewan Henderson, midfielders Joseph Kirby from Kelty Hearts Colts, Ricki Cooper from Glenrothes Juniors Under 19s, Josh McPhie from Kelty Hearts and Scott Renton from Hill of Beath. Defender Ross Ogden from Kirkcaldy YM and goalkeeper Shaun Hunter from St Andrews United have also signed on.\n\nGoalkeeper Ryan Couser and striker Chris Ireland both came in but have since left.\n\nThe biggest change has been of the manager. Craig Ness who had been in charge since 2014 left the club in November. Stevie Kowbel was appointed the new manager on 23 November. He was most recently assistant manager at Brechin Vics. With last week’s game being postponed, the game against Rosyth would be his first in charge.\n\nThe current incarnation of the Junior side from Rosyth were established in 1992, but there was first a Junior team there in 1916.\n\nThe 1916 version were called Rosyth Dockyard Recreation and folded in 1926. They re-emerged in 1946 and won the Fife League, Cup and Cowdenbeath Cup in 1949, but they lasted just a year longer than the first time, folding in 1957.\n\nThere was a big gap before Junior football returned to the area, when in 1992,\n\nDunfermline Jubilee Athletic, founded in 1967, relocated to New Recreation Park and renamed themselves Rosyth Recreation. (They subsequently dropped the ‘Recreation’ bit.)\n\nFollowing reconstruction, Rosyth became a member of the East Region Premier League and finished third in 2006-07, the first season. They were relegated the following season.\n\nThe last four seasons have seen them finish twelfth, third, seventh and eighth. This term, seven wins, a draw and three losses saw them in fifth, two points ahead of Albert having played a game more.\n\nThe team have been managed since July 2016 by Kevin Smith and Barry Cockburn. Cockburn took sole charge in February and he has brought in Andy Penman to work alongside him.\n\nNew signings include Dale Prattis from Crossgates Primrose, the returning Scott Houston, Scott Russell, Blair Clark and Baillie Kay, Ryan Cowie from Lumphinnans United.\n\nThe joys of an internet connection got us to Gardiners Park which is located on the edge of Lochgelly. The pitch is railed off from the grass banking which surround the pitch (but sadly don’t seem to protect the fans from the wind.) A small enclosure is on one side which was added in 2009 and a container houses the food outlet on the same side.\n\nThe game had just kicked off as we entered the ground and there were around 70 in attendance.\n\nThe first piece of action we saw was in the second minute, when a long throw by Millar into the Rosyth box was headed away to the edge of the box. Albert’s Cooper picked up the ball and shot for goal. It seemed to go through a ruck of players and ended up in the bottom corner of the goal to put the hosts in front.\n\nDespite the early goal, both sides seemed to be still trying to find their feet in the next few minutes, with little in the way of chances.\n\nRosyth’s Page chased a through ball in 12 minutes, but Hunter was quickly out of his goal to collect the ball.\n\nA good turn by Albert’s Duffy in 13 minutes on the edge of the box saw him get a shot away, but it took a nick as it went wide. Cooper’s corner was sliced behind by a Rosyth defender at the front post for another corner. Cooper took it again and this time aimed at the back post, where Millar rose unchallenged to head into the net to make it 2-0.\n\nPoor defending by the visitors to leave the biggest player on the pitch free at a corner.\n\nWhile Rosyth continued to try and fight their way back into the game, they looked a bit shell-shocked to be two behind so quickly.\n\nMcPhie tried his luck from distance at the Rosyth goal in 21 minutes, but his effort was off target.\n\nIn 24 minutes, Duffy had a go at goal from even further out, but his shot from fully 30 yards was well over the Rosyth bar.\n\nRowbotham was alert in 25 minutes, coming racing out of his goal to get there before Henderson to smother.\n\nRosyth won a free kick about 22 yards out in 27 minutes and Duff sent a great effort goalwards which came off the bar. Gilfillan was first to the rebound, but his cross was taken by Hunter.\n\nSome lovely football by Albert with half an hour gone when Duffy fed Rennie, who backheeled the ball into the path of Henderson on the right hand side of the box, but he flashed his shot wide of the far post.\n\nAt this stage it looked and sounded like the Rosyth manager was about to spontaneously combust in the dugout at the other side of the pitch.\n\nHenderson showed some nice footwork on the edge of the Rosyth box in 33 minutes to create some space, and he hit a low shot which went right into the corner to make it three for Albert.\n\nMillar did well down the left for the home side in 35 minutes and a Lochgelly fan near us complimented him in a way that only Scottish people can. “He’s on fire that c*nt.”\n\nWith 44 minutes gone a ball up the right for Rosyth’s Page saw him take the ball into the box and go past Millar, but Murray managed to block the ball behind.\n\nIn first half injury time, Duff swung a free kick into the Albert box and Hampson rose well to get his head on the ball, but it was straight at Hunter.\n\nA mountain to climb for Rosyth after the first half and Albert looked very comfortable at the break.\n\nCooper got a sore one in 52 minutes after coming off worse in a 50/50 challenge where he seemed to hurt his back.\n\nRosyth’s best way back into the game seemed to be through set pieces, as they had sent in a number of decent deliveries from corners, and another good one by Page in 54 minutes found the head of Robertson, but he couldn’t direct it on target.\n\nAlbert’s Henderson received the game’s first booking in 56 minutes, for pulling back Gilfillan.\n\nAnother good delivery from a Page corner again found Robertson at the back post in 57 minutes, but his header back across goal was cleared by the Albert defence.\n\nMcPhie was the next Albert player booked after a foul in 61 minutes. It wasn’t clear from where I was if it had been for the foul or something he said.\n\nRosyth were starting to put a bit of pressure on, particularly with their set pieces.\n\nAlbert broke forward in 63 minutes and had three against two. Henderson played the ball left for Kirby who picked out Rennie in the box. He sidestepped a defender but saw his shot blocked by Rowbotham.\n\nRennie found some space on the left for Albert in 67 minutes and his cross was dummied by Cooper at the front post, but the Rosyth defence got the ball clear.\n\nA minute later and a good ball up the right from Bateson sent Forbes away. He decided to go for goal himself with Cooper free in the middle, but blasted wide.\n\nA long range strike by Rosyth’s O’Connor in 70 minutes was parried by Hunter and Murray got the ball behind. Page’s corner to the back post picked out Robertson and he had a free header and nodded home to give Rosyth some hope.\n\nCooper sent a good ball from a free kick into the Rosyth box in 74 minutes and Prattis sliced the ball over his own bar.\n\nRosyth won a free kick on the edge of the box in 75 minutes after Page had been brought down. Hampson’s free kick came off the wall and went behind.\n\nSlimmings took a Rosyth corner in 77 minutes and incredibly, Robertson was left unmarked at the back post again and headed home to make it 3-2.\n\nJust a minute after the goal, Rosyth’s Hampson looked to go in two footed on Millar on the touchline and the left back was quickly up and pushed the striker. A huge melee resulted, with players from both sides involved. It was on the opposite side from where we were, so it wasn’t easy to see what happened, but the referee showed a straight red card to Hampson, which didn’t seem to result in too many complaints. Millar appeared lucky to escape any card for raising his hands and nobody else was punished.\n\nWith Rosyth having their tails up and right back in the game, this was a big blow to their hopes.\n\nKirby picked up a loose ball in 83 minutes and carried it across the pitch on the edge of the Rosyth box. Once he reached a central position, he struck for goal, but somewhat scuffed his shot. Keeper Rowbotham was wrong footed and couldn’t get across in time to stop the ball, which just about managed to hit the net as it trundled over the line. 4-2 to the hosts.\n\nCooper was put through on goal in 86 minutes and took the ball around Rowbotham but was forced wide, and the keeper managed to claim the attempted cross.\n\nRosyth’s Kay was shown the yellow card in 88 minutes for dissent.\n\nIn the final minute, Kirby played the ball across for Sutherland, but he dragged his shot wide of the Rosyth goal.\n\nThere was still time for Rosyth to collect another booking, Robertson being shown the yellow card for dissent.\n\nAn entertaining game and one I wasn’t expecting to be at. Albert looked out of sight at half time, but not learning their lesson to pick up at the back post from corners almost cost them. Who knows if Rosyth could have got something from the game if they had stayed at full strength. They didn’t give up and looked like they might just do it when they got their second. A bit of a Jekyll and Hyde performance from the hosts who played some good stuff in spells, but should never have let Rosyth back into it.\n\nA good start for Albert’s new manager.\n\nBest for Albert were right back Bateson, centre half Murray and winger Cooper, with Glifillan and Chitemere showing good flashes of ability in the Rosyth midfield.\n\nThanks to both sides for their help with the team line-ups. And thanks to the referee for letting the game go ahead, which seemed very much the right decision.\n\nOne question remains. Why is Albert goalkeeper Shaun Hunter known as Tuna?\n\nFull Time: Lochgelly Albert 4 Rosyth 2\n\nAdmission: £5\n\nLochgelly Albert: 1 Shaun Hunter, 2 Craig Bateson, 5 Douglas Swan, 4 Scott Murray, 3 Iain Millar, 7 Ricki Cooper (Sutherland 88), 8 John Duffy, 6 Josh McPhie, 11 Joseph Kirby, 9 Martin Rennie, 10 Ewan Henderson (Forbes 65).

They sat third from bottom in the league after 13 games, with 8 defeats, four wins and a draw. They had also been knocked out of the East of Scotland Cup by East Premier side Haddington Athletic.\n\nIt wasn’t a massive surprise that Bo’ness would take a while to get going this season. They needed a big overhaul of the squad after a lot of departures at the season’s end. Leaving the club were Roddy and Ruari MacLennan, Colin Strickland, Ross Philp, Robert Sloan, Calum Smith, Ross Tierney, Jack Simpson, Sam Collumbine, Fraser Eddington and Ali El Zubaidi.\n\nComing in were keeper Alex Marshall, defenders Jamie Boyd and Rico Quitongo and midfielder Marc Kelly, who all came on loan from Hamilton Accies, striker Scott Sally from Fauldhouse United, defender Hassan Nyang from Bathgate Thistle, midfielders Calum Scott from Camelon, Alan Comrie from Livingston United and Devon Jacobs from Kelty Hearts. Also coming in were Andy Shirra and Ryan Miller, both midfielders, from Sauchie, defender Connor Flynn-Gillespie from SD Lenense in Spain and midfielder Ryan Batchelor from Hutchison Vale. Connor McGregor was signed from Whitehill Welfare but has since returned and Jordan Cropley was signed from Newtongrange Star, but has also moved on.\n\nWe last saw the BUs in May when they were beaten by Broxburn Athletic in the Fife & Lothians Cup semi-final.\n\nBo’ness reached the third round after wins against Lochee Harp and Brechin Vics. This was the round that they had gone out in the last two seasons, both against sides that they would have been expected to win against. The opposition this time would be tougher.\n\nWe last saw Kilwinning Rangers in April, when we saw their home game against Cumnock in the West Super League Premier Division. They ended up in third bottom spot and had to negotiate a tricky play-off against Kilsyth Rangers which they came through 3-2 on aggregate to retain their place in the division.\n\nThis season has been very different for ‘the Buffs’ so far. In their 8 league games they have won 6 and lost 2, and were in second spot (if they were to win their games in hand they would be top.) They suffered a blip in their season when they lost to Irvine Meadow from the league below in the West of Scotland Cup.\n\nSince last season, Kilwinning have lost Darren Miller and Michael Morris, who moved on and Martyn Campbell, who retired.\n\nComing in were midfielders Sam McCloskey from Stranraer and Michael Wardrope from Ayr United, striker David Winters from Pollok and midfielder James Latta and defender Craig Pettigrew from Auchinleck Talbot.\n\nKilwinning reached the third round after being awarded the first round tie against Saltcoats Victoria after they were unable to raise a team, then won against Larkhall Thistle in round 2. Last year saw them reach the quarter final.\n\nThere was a healthy crowd through from Kilwinning of around 100 bringing the attendance up to around 350 on a bitterly cold afternoon. The home supporters were clearly looking for a Brucey Bo’ness.\n\nCredit to Bo’ness for the state of the pitch. It looked better than many we have visited this season and with some pretty awful weather during the week, it was impressive.\n\nThere were claims for handball in the Bo’ness box in the second minute, but nothing was given.\n\nKilwinning won a corner in two minutes and Monti crossed to the back post where Boylan rose and tried to guide the ball goalwards with his hand. It was pretty obvious, and he was shown the yellow card.\n\nThe teams were feeling each other out over the next few minutes (and I was eating a steak slice and trying to get some feeling in my fingers.)\n\nA lovely pass from United’s Kelly sent Scott running into the box on the right in 14 minutes and he fired a shot at the far corner. Strain looked to get fingertips to it, but couldn’t stop it going in the net and the hosts were in front.\n\nScott took a Bo’ness free kick in 18 minutes and his ball into the box was headed across goal by Hunter. It fell to the feet of Gibb about three yards from goal but he somehow half-volleyed over the bar.\n\nKilwinning looked very uncomfortable in defence and a pass back by Pettigrew in 21 minutes was miscontrolled by Strain, who let the ball run out for a corner.\n\nA cross from the right by Keast in 22 minutes was scrambled behind by the Kilwinning defence. Scott’s corner was right on the head of Hunter, but it was deflected behind.\n\nMcGuiness found Boylan in 24 minutes and he took the ball into the box, but Hunter got across to deflect his shot over the bar.\n\nAnother United free kick in 27 minutes saw Scott’s cross find Hunter’s head, but Strain got both hands to the header. Hunter tried to head the rebound across goal, but the defence cleared.\n\nNice build up play by the home side in 32 minutes ended with Keast setting up Scott on the edge of the box, but he shot straight at Strain.\n\nScott curled another free kick into the Kilwinning box in 37 minutes which was headed away to the edge of the box. Snowdon ran onto it, but put his shot over the bar.\n\nKilwinning broke forward in 41 minutes and the ball was played to Monti on the edge of the box, but his powerful shot was deflected wide.\n\nJust before half time Kilwinning won a free kick about 25 yards from goal. Pettigrew struck for goal, but it was a comfortable save for Murphy.\n\nBo’ness a goal in front at the break and had controlled the first half. Kilwinning had been poor and it was hard to think they would be as bad in the second period.\n\nA United corner in 47 minutes was taken by Scott and dropped to Campbell in the box, but his shot was blocked.\n\nIn 52 minutes, Shirra played a ball down the right wing for Scott. He burst past a defender and crossed into the box for Keast who sent a side footed volley high into the net to double the lead for Bo’ness.\n\nMonti picked up on a loose Bo’ness header in 54 minutes, but he didn’t catch his shot well from the edge of the box.\n\nWith 58 minutes gone, Monti found some space on the left for Kilwinning, but his cross was taken by Murphy.\n\nUnited’s Gemmell was struggling a bit after getting the ball full in the face.\n\nWhen Kilwinning’s Maitland brought down Shirra in 61 minutes, he was shown a yellow card for persistent fouling.\n\nKeast got a sore one in 66 minutes after being caught on the back of the head in an aerial challenge.\n\nMcCloskey was the next Kilwinning player cautioned, for pulling back Gibb in 68 minutes.\n\nHunter had a chance at the near post for Bo’ness in 69 minutes but was crowded out. Kilwinning defender Maitland seemed to say something to the referee in the aftermath and was shown a second yellow card, then a red. The mountain his side had to climb had just got even steeper.\n\nIn 70 minutes, Keast was almost through on the visitor’s goal, but Pettigrew managed to get in front of him to steer the ball back to his keeper. Remarkably, Strain took the ball into his hands. Even more remarkably, the referee didn’t give Bo’ness a free kick for a pass back.\n\nKelly was next to get a sight of the Kilwinning goal, breaking through on the right in 71 minutes, but his shot flashed wide of the far post.\n\nNisbet did well on the left for Kilwinning in 72 minutes, going past two defenders before Jacobs got back to poke the ball behind. The corner came to Boylan at the back post, but he sclaffed his shot behind.\n\nThings weren’t improving for Kilwinning, with Pettigrew overhitting a pass back in 73 minutes which went out for a corner.\n\nKelly went down the right for Bo’ness in 75 minutes, but his cutback was between Jacobs and Scott in the middle.\n\nWardrope cut in from the right in 76 minutes, he fired well over the Bo’ness bar.\n\nGreat skill by Keast in 77 minutes to turn away from two Kilwinning players and he managed to poke the ball through for Scott. He drew the keeper before slotting past him into the corner to make it three.\n\nColeman was the next player shown the yellow card for bringing down United’s Keast in 79 minutes.\n\nBo’ness continued to attack and Shirra got away from two defenders on the right in 81 minutes before swinging a cross into the box. Scott got a header in, but it went wide of goal.\n\nMonti showed some good skill on the right for Kilwinning in 82 minutes and his ball across goal was played back by Wardrope for Frye, but he lashed over the bar.\n\nWith 5 minutes left, Gemmell found Flynn-Gillespie on the right for Bo’ness. He cut the ball back for Miller, but his shot was wide.\n\nMiller was shown a yellow card in 88 minutes for Bo’ness.\n\nThere was a chance for Boylan in the Bo’ness box in the final minute, but his shot was saved by Murphy. The ball came back to the same player, but the defence managed to block his effort.\n\nIn injury time, Kilwinning won a free kick about 23 yards from goal. Monti curled it over the wall, but Murphy was able to touch it wide.\n\nA convincing win for Bo’ness and one which only their most ardent fan would have predicted. They were impressive all over the park and played some great football. Certainly not how they had reportedly been playing previously. As good as the hosts were, Kilwinning were very poor. They seemed nervous from the start and basic errors throughout cost them. They couldn’t deal with Bo’ness in the air and it seemed incredible that they kept giving away free kicks and corners to give United the opportunity to get the ball into their box. It was a big surprise that they didn’t lose a goal as a result of one of these.\n\nAs surprising as the result may have been, it didn’t flatter Bo’ness who could easily have scored a few more.\n\nHard to pick out the best players for Bo’ness, as there wasn’t a failing in the team. Hunter was immense in defence and the whole midfield put in a good shift. Keast and Kelly caused problems throughout, but it was Scott that Kilwinning really couldn’t cope with and his two goals and an assist were testimony to that.\n\nIt was equally hard to pick out Kilwinning’s best for entirely different reasons. McGuiness tried to continue to play football and had some success and Monti showed flashes of his ability. Very much an off day for the Ayrshire men.\n\nFull Time: Bo’ness United 3 Kilwinning Rangers 0\n\nAdmission: £6\n\nBo’ness United: 21 Andy Murphy, 3 Scott Gibb (Flynn-Gillespie 83), 4 Ross Campbell, 5 Stuart Hunter, 2 Will Snowdon (Batchelor 92), 6 Andy Shirra, 7 Devon Jacobs, 8 Michael Gemmell, 11 Calum Scott, 10 Marc Kelly, 9 Fraser Keast (Miller 80).

Cup ties and a postponement have meant that they have only played twice in the league since then. A draw at Haddington and a win at Dunbar saw them sitting in second spot in the table, five points behind the leaders. With the top two going up automatically to the Super League (third spot wins a play-off place against third bottom of the Super League) they were looking to maintain their form for the rest of the season and go straight back up to the top league after relegation.\n\nFauldhouse had made a couple of signings since we last saw them. Midfielder Chrissy Patrick had joined from Whitburn Junior and former Falkirk and Albion Rovers forward Jake Coulter had also signed up.\n\nIt was a first sighting of the season of Musselburgh for us, having last watched them fall on penalties to Tranent Juniors in the semi-final of the Fife and Lothians Cup in May.\n\nMusselburgh suffered heartbreak when they were relegated on the final day of last season, ending their eight year stay in the Super League. They managed to keep the bulk of the squad together and have quickly taken to their new surroundings in the Premier League.\n\nThey sat in top spot after 12 matches, having won eleven and drawn one. With their lead over their second placed opponents at five points, a win would provide a big step in making their time in the Premier League a short one.\n\nTo supplement the squad for their assault on the Premier League, Musselburgh brought in former Hibs and Hearts youth player Bradley Whyte, left back Chris Gray has returned to the club from Linlithgow Rose after 7 years away, goalkeeper Asher Tufail from Edinburgh United and striker Stephen MacDonald, who arrived at the club from American football. (That’s soccer, not grid iron.)\n\nWith Fauldhouse’s scheduled home fixture being postponed the week before, we’d kept an eye on the weather all week, but a 9.30am pitch inspection confirmed the game would be on.\n\nWe were through early and were greeted by the always friendly gents at the entrance who must provide the warmest welcome in football. Always ready for a chat regardless of your team and always with good humour. This continued after we procured something from the pie stand as a local by the name of “Robert” chatted to us in the ground. He told us he’d been married 51 years and was always concerned when he went out to put something in the bin, that his wife would “lock the door so I couldn’t get back in.”\n\nThe friendly nature of those associated with Fauldhouse was spoiled a little when a BMW parked behind the goals was hit by a ball shot by a home player warming up. I’m sure it wasn’t deliberate. The car was moved soon after.\n\nFauldhouse are one of the sides that have a board up that they write the team names and numbers on before the game. I can’t tell you how much I like teams doing that.\n\nIt was clear a lot of work had been done to get the pitch playable, but it was certainly patchy in parts. The referee was inspecting the worst parts and we had worries of a very late call off when he bounced the ball several times without any movement whatsoever.\n\nThere were around 100 in attendance.\n\nWith 7 minutes gone, Moffat won the ball for Burgh from O’Donnell and exchanged passes before winning his team a corner which came to nothing.\n\nA minute later up the other end Currie flicked the ball on for Bennett. He took the ball past a defender and was through on goal. He struck his shot well, but Adams made a good save and the Burgh defence got the ball clear.\n\nWard had a strike at the Burgh goal from 25 yards in 10 minutes, but he was off target.\n\nBurgh’s Whyte looked as if he might have a chance when he ran onto a pass on the right hand side of the box in 13 minutes, but Ward was across to slide tackle the ball away.\n\nCurrie ran into the Burgh box on the left in 16 minutes and flashed a shot across the face of goal, but it was wide of the far post.\n\nDunn won the ball from O’Kane in 17 minutes and took it forward before deciding to go himself from 20 yards, but it was a comfortable save for Adams.\n\nCurrie turned very well in the Burgh box in 23 minutes to get away from McManus, but a heavy touch gave Adams the opportunity to claim the ball.\n\nIn 24 minutes, King ran onto a pass down the right and took the ball into the Fauldhouse box. He cut inside a defender before seeing his shot blocked by Hutchison’s leg at the near post.\n\nThomson came forward for Burgh on the right in 27 minutes and beat Brown before cutting the ball back for Cherrie, whose shot was blocked behind.\n\nFauldhouse broke quickly in 28 minutes and Currie sent Bennett through on goal. It was another great chance, but again he couldn’t beat Adams.\n\nMcLeod required treatment in 29 minutes after the Fauldhouse player was subjected to a robust tackle in the middle of the park.\n\nIt was clear the importance of the game with how much players were shouting at team mates. Particularly if they made a poor decision.\n\nDunn took the ball into the Burgh box in 32 minutes and exchanged passes with Currie, but his shot was blocked.\n\nA cross from the right in 33 minutes came to the feet of Bennett who struck the ball on the half volley, but it fizzed wide of the Burgh goal.\n\nMusselburgh won a free kick 25 yards from goal in 35 minutes and Thomson had a go at goal, but his curling effort was too high.\n\nAfter an offside call against Musselburgh in 36 minutes, a defender played the ball across to Fauldhouse keeper Hutchison. With the ball at the goalie’s feet, Burgh striker King asked him if a free kick had been awarded. Hutchison replied, “I dunno”, before booting the ball up the park.\n\nCurrie played the ball through to Bennett in 38 minutes and a Burgh defender flew across the box to block his shot. The rebound was fired back at goal by Currie, but deflected over.\n\nWith 39 minutes gone, Bennett played the ball across the Burgh goal and it came to Brady at the back post with the goal gaping. The defender didn’t make good contact though, and the ball drifted wide. He may have been put off by an uneven bounce.\n\nDunn attempted a low cross into the Burgh box in 40 minutes, but it was blocked. The ball came back to him, but he lashed it over the bar.\n\nJust before the break, as the ball was cleared into the crowd near where I stood, it came off the corner of one of the steps and flew up over my head where I caught it one handed. The Fauldhouse official running the line shouted “Sign him!” Still got it.\n\nThe hosts had the better of the first half and had some very good chances but had failed to score. You couldn’t help feeling that might come back to bite them.\n\nAs the teams lined up for the second half, the referee looked to both keepers to check they were ready by waving at them. Adams acknowledged him from the Burgh goal, then Hutchison did so with a very enthusiastic over the top wave, which we found funnier than it probably was.\n\nIn the opening minute of the half, Fauldhouse’s O’Donnell had a strike from the edge of the box, but his low effort was taken by Adams.\n\nCurrie played a one-two with O’Donnell on the right for Fauldhouse in 47 minutes, but his cutback was cleared.\n\nO’Kane had a go from a Burgh free kick from more than 25 yards away in 48 minutes, but he put it well over the bar.\n\nA deep cross into the Fauldhouse box by Moffat from the right in 50 minutes found King at the back post, and he sent a looping header over Hutchison, but a defender headed the ball off the line.\n\nBurgh’s Gray was shown the yellow card in 51 minutes and had a bit of a slanging match with the Fauldhouse linesman afterwards.\n\nCurrie crossed into the Burgh box in 52 minutes and the ball dropped between players, but Adams was quick to smother.\n\nIn 54 minutes, MacDonald threaded a ball through the Fauldhouse defence for King, but Watson got across to clear the danger.\n\nBennett played the ball into the feet of Currie in the Burgh box in 57 minutes and he showed great skill to turn the defender in close proximity before shooting low into the corner to give the home side the lead.\n\nTwo minutes later and King read an attempted passback from Fauldhouse and was onto it in a flash. He quickly took the ball around Hutchison and slotted home for the equaliser.\n\nBurgh had their tails up after the leveller and broke forward in 61 minutes with Whyte playing the ball to Thomson on the right. He cut the ball back to King, but Hutchison made a fantastic save to keep out the shot.\n\nFauldhouse’s Bennett was next to go into the referee’s book in 62 minutes.\n\nMoffat passed to Whyte in 67 minutes and his shot was partly blocked and spun up in the air into the grateful Hutchison’s arms in the Fauldhouse goal.\n\nBurgh’s MacDonald made progress down the left in 68 minutes and smashed the ball across the face of goal, but nobody could get a touch in the middle.\n\nThe visitors were having a good spell and Whyte set up King in 70 minutes, but a block took the sting out of his shot and Hutchison saved easily.\n\nMacDonald burst up the left in 73 minutes and beat two defenders before he was tackled in the Fauldhouse box. The ball came to King and his shot took a bit of a deflection, but Hutchison saved well.\n\nBurgh were almost undone in 75 minutes when a passback to Adams was hit a little hard and he took a heavy touch, but managed to get the break of the ball as Bennett tackled him.\n\nKing limped off in 76 minutes with what looked like a hamstring pull. Not good news for Burgh.\n\nNice play by Fauldhouse in 78 minutes between Bennett and Currie saw the latter’s shot blocked. The ball came to O’Donnell, whose shot was also blocked and Adams was able to take possession.\n\nO’Kane passed to Moffat on the edge of the Fauldhouse box in 82 minutes and he sent a shot goalwards which beat Hutchison, but came off the bar. The defence managed to get the ball away.\n\nMoffat was involved again a minute later when he picked out Murphy at the back post in space, but Hutchison made a fine save to turn his shot around the post.\n\nRalton raced into the Fauldhouse box in 85 minutes, but Hutchison was out quickly to save at his feet.\n\nFauldhouse were guilty of overplaying a bit in their own half in 86 minutes and Murphy stole the ball and found Ralton on the left. He took the ball into the box, but dragged his shot wide.\n\nWith two minutes left Brogan found some space on the right as Fauldhouse came forward. His cross into the middle was met by the head of Currie, but went inches wide of the goal.\n\nMoffat was booked in 89 minutes for a foul on Fauldhouse’s O’Donnell.\n\nAs we reached 90 minutes, a kick out by Adams was headed on by MacDonald for Ralton, but he was given offside.\n\nAn entertaining game and very much the proverbial game of two halves. Fauldhouse would have been disappointed not to be leading at the break, but Burgh will wonder how they didn’t win the game in the second half.\n\nCredit has to go to both teams for trying to get the ball down and play football the right way, despite the difficult conditions.\n\nThere were a number of good performances and it was easy to see why the two sides are at the top of the table. For Fauldhouse, Dunn and Ward impressed in the middle of the park and Currie did well up front. In Burgh’s colours, I was surprised at Cherrie being withdrawn after an hour as I thought he had done well, and Thomson was a constant danger on the right. Moffat also stood out for the East Lothian side.\n\nThere also has to be praise for both keepers, who handled well and made a number of good saves. They were both helpless at the goals.\n\nAn enjoyable afternoon all round.\n\nFull Time: Fauldhouse United 1 Musselburgh Athletic 1\n\nAdmission: £6\n\nFauldhouse United: 1 JC Hutchison, 2 Sammy Watson, 3 James Brown, 4 Chrissy Patrick, 5 Declan Brady, 6 David Dunn, 7 David O’Donnell, 8 Aiden Ward, 9 Jack Currie, 10 Jamie McLeod (Brogan 66), 11 Mathew Bennett.

This derives from the Robert Burns poem The Inventory. Ever since that formation, they have consistently picked up at least one trophy every decade.\n\nThey won the Junior League in 1903-04, not giving their fans long to wait to see their first silverware. The Ayrshire Cup was won in 1913 and again in 1924, when they made it a cup double, also winning the League Cup.\n\nThe ’30’s saw two more League Cups come their way and then the late 1940s/early 1950s saw a golden period, with 3 league titles, two Ayrshire Cups and the first time they won the holy grail of the Juniors, the Scottish Cup in 1952.\n\nSeason 1967-68 saw a league win before the ‘70s saw another league title, three Ayrshire Cups and in 1977, a second Junior Cup.\n\nThe eighties saw victory in the Ayrshire Cup and League Cup and they reached the Junior Cup final in 1987, but this time they were unsuccessful.\n\nAnother League Cup came in 1994-95 and the noughties saw a West of Scotland Cup win in 2008 before the League Cup again came the way of Kilbirnie in 2010. That has been their last trophy, so to keep up the trophy record, they have three years left to get their hands on something this decade.\n\nWith a good start to their league season and several cups still up for grabs, this may well be their year.\n\nFormer Clydebank manager Billy McGhee took over at Kilbirnie in May after former Linlithgow Rose manager Mark Bradley returned to his old club. It wasn’t the smoothest of starts for the new management team, with only 5 of the previous season’s squad staying at the club.\n\nHe has had to get players in quickly and began with three Possil YM players – Bradley Rodden, Kris Lafferty & Harry Clark. Further players have arrived, including forward Jon Scullion from Greenock Morton, former Queens Park defender Gavin Mitchell and defender Dominic McLaren from East Kilbride.\n\nThe newly assembled squad has gelled quickly and fans of the Blasties are hopeful of a successful season.\n\nKilbirnie went out in the second round of last season’s Junior Cup at Banks O’ Dee.\n\nThe original tie between the sides was postponed at the eleventh hour with Penicuik’s players, officials and supporters already in Ayrshire. The teams then met in Kilbirnie and played out a 2-2 draw, with Kilbirnie twice coming from behind in a game that Penicuik probably should have won.\n\nWith both teams coming from the top league in their respective sides of the country, there had been a certain symmetry that both were sitting in second spot in their respective tables. Since the first game between the two, Penicuik had dropped to third, with Lochee leapfrogging them.\n\nThere was a bumper crowd in the ground, with a noisy contingent from Ayrshire making themselves heard.\n\nThere was a minute’s silence before the game to mark Remembrance Day.\n\nWith 6 minutes gone, Kilbirnie’s Finlay got the ball on the left and went past Hamilton before cutting inside and seeing his shot take a nick off Forbes on its way behind.\n\nScullion’s corner was headed away by Young and Penicuik broke forward. Barr found the feet of Somerville who cut inside a defender before shooting from the edge of the box, but it was well wide of goal.\n\nBembo played the ball to Williamson on the right in 8 minutes as Kilbirnie came forward again, but his cross was too hard for those in the middle.\n\nA good run forward by Finlay in 13 minutes was halted by a fine tackle by Penicuik’s Williams.\n\nKateleza turned well in the Kilbirnie box in 15 minutes to get space to make it to the bye-line and win a corner. McCrory-Irving’s delivery was met by Hamilton, but was off target.\n\nBack up the other end a minute later and Scullion passed wide to Williamson whose cross picked out Finlay in the box, but he headed wide from a good position.\n\nIn 20 minutes, Ponton crossed into the Kilbirnie box and Somerville appeared to be pushed in the back by O’Byrne before the ball dropped to Kateleza. He stepped away from a defender and struck for goal but saw his effort come back off the bar and the defence cleared.\n\nA good turn by Penicuik’s Kateleza in 22 minutes gave him some space on the edge of the box, but his shot was straight at Hughes.\n\nForbes came forward in 25 minutes and threaded a pass through for Jones who ran in behind the Kilbirnie defence before rounding Hughes and firing into the net. But the flag was up for offside.\n\nWith half an hour gone, Kilbirnie’s Scullion sent Finlay through on goal, but he was also given offside.\n\nA good run forward by Barr in 34 minutes saw him shoot at the Kilbirnie goal, but there wasn’t enough power to trouble Hughes.\n\nAnother through ball to Finlay in 36 minutes saw the Kilbirnie striker not given offside, although he certainly looked to be, and take on the Penicuik defence, but Hamilton managed to get the ball behind.\n\nPenicuik came forward in 38 minutes with Young finding McCrory-Irving on the right. He brought the ball inside before beating a defender and shooting for goal, but Hughes made a magnificent save to keep the ball out.\n\nThree minutes away from half time, a cross into the Kilbirnie box saw the referee award Penicuik a penalty. Very few in the ground seemed to know what it was for and I certainly didn’t see anything, but it appeared to be for holding. The referee booked MacKinnon who must have been the culprit, then keeper Hughes who must have complained too much.\n\nSomerville sent Hughes the wrong way from the spot to give Penicuik the lead.\n\nAs we reached the 45 minutes, Kateleza released Forbes down the right for Penicuik. He reached the bye-line, but his attempted cutback was deflected to Hughes.\n\nIn the third minute of injury time, McGill had a shot at the Penicuik goal from distance and Allison watched it carefully as it bounced just in front of him before he claimed.\n\nPenicuik a goal in front at the break and they had the better chances in a first half that didn’t quite catch fire.\n\nKilbirnie’s Scullion sprinted down the left in the third minute of the second half, but his cross was cleared by Williams.\n\nA free kick for Kilbirnie in 51 minutes was not cleared by the Penicuik defence and fell to the feet of Bembo in the heart of the box. His shot took a deflection and wrong-footed keeper Allison and rolled into the net for the equaliser.\n\nMcCrory-Irving took a Penicuik free kick in 56 minutes and his cross into the box was knocked down to the feet of Jones, but as the ball bounced up, he could only volley over the bar.\n\nAs Kilbirnie looked to clear their lines in 58 minutes, Ponton got across to block and the ball fell to Somerville, but his effort was too high.\n\nBembo was booked in 61 minutes for a late tackle on Penicuik’s Barr.\n\nMcCrory-Irving turned well in 62 minutes before his attempted shot came to the feet of Kateleza in the Kilbirnie box, but he was given offside.\n\nSome fine flowing football by Penicuik in 63 minutes created a chance for McCrory-Irving to deliver into the box, but his ball into the middle was cleared.\n\nIn 65 minutes, Jack Hamilton chased a ball down the right for Penicuik. Hughes came out of his goal and the ball broke back to Kateleza as the two challenged. He tried to shoot for goal from out wide, with the keeper out of his goal, but couldn’t find the target.\n\nPonton played a ball forward into the Kilbirnie box in 68 minutes and McLaren managed to get his head to it, but it went behind him. Jack Hamilton ran in behind him and tried to lift the ball over the head of Hughes in the Kilbirnie goal, but didn’t make good contact with the ball.\n\nA Kilbirnie corner into the Penicuik box in 73 minutes was again only half cleared by the Penicuik defence and when the ball was headed back into the box, O’Byrne acrobatically sent a volley in off the post to put the visitors in front.\n\nPenicuik had looked very much the more likely to score and it must have come as a shock that they found themselves trailing.\n\nStraight from the restart, Penicuik burst forward and Kateleza got to the bye-line on the right. He cut the ball back for Somerville who saw his shot blocked. The ball came back towards the edge of the box where Barr raced in to smash the ball into the net for a quickfire equaliser. Hughes had got his fingers to the shot, but couldn’t keep it out.\n\nIn the aftermath of the goal, Kilbirnie’s Finlay was shown the yellow card for dissent.\n\nWorse was to come for the men from Ayrshire when O’Byrne was shown a straight red as the game got going again, putting his team down to ten. He was claiming that he was fouled in the build-up to Penicuik’s equaliser, but had clearly taken his protests too far.\n\nPenicuik’s Forbes was booked in 77 minutes for a late tackle on the touchline.\n\nA quick break by the home side in 79 minutes saw Kateleza play the ball into the path of Ponton in the Kilbirnie box, but his shot went into the side netting.\n\nKilbirnie’s Roberts was next to go into the increasingly full referee’s book for dissent.\n\nMcGill and Cory Hughes needed treatment after separate incidents over the next few minutes, but both Kilbirnie players seemed ok to continue.\n\nSomerville passed in behind the Kilbirnie defence in 82 minutes for Kateleza on the right. He cut the ball back for Jack Hamilton and although the ball was a little behind him, he twisted his body to get his foot to it and send it into the net to put Penicuik in front.\n\nKilbirnie won a corner a minute later and Scullion’s cross was headed away to the edge of the box, where McGill volleyed towards goal. Allison could only parry the ball and Finlay was first to react in a crowded box to poke the ball over the line for the equaliser.\n\nPenicuik began piling on the pressure in search of a winner.\n\nBarr had a shot which took a touch off a Kilbirnie defender on its way over the bar in 87 minutes, then Barr squared the ball to Ponton a minute later, but he shot wide.\n\nIn the third minute of injury time, Roberts passed to Scullion, but his shot was wide of the Penicuik goal.\n\nSo penalties were to settle the tie. The noisy section of the away support made their way round behind the goals to do their best to put off the Penicuik players.\n\nJones scored first for Penicuik, before Williamson squared things. Williams and Jack Hamilton missed Penicuik’s next two, while Tuohy and Crerand scored for Kilbirnie to put them 3-1 in front.\n\nBarr scored for Penicuik and Scullion missed for Kilbirnie, then Young scored for Penicuik. Finlay stepped up for Kilbirnie and sent his kick into the net to win the match for Kilbirnie.\n\nA game which just got better and better the longer it went on and a great watch. Penicuik must have wondered how they didn’t win the match. They were the better side, had the better chances and controlled long periods of the game. They also had a numerical advantage for the key part of the game after O’Byrne’s sending off. Their inability to deal with crosses into the box was their downfall.\n\nThe celebrations by the Kilbirnie players and fans at the end showed how much the Junior Cup means to Junior sides, and it certainly didn’t look like it was only the second round. They had ridden their luck, but their never say die attitude had seen them through when it looked like they had lost. It looked as if they had lost their discipline, but they dug deep to get the result and there was almost an inevitability that they would win the shoot-out by the fact that they had got the game to that point. With Lanark United visiting Ayrshire in the next round, they will certainly fancy their chances of progressing further.\n\nJones, Kateleza and Barr were best for Penicuik, while McLaren, Bembo and Kieran Hughes were the Kilbirnie stars on the day.\n\nFull Time: Penicuik Athletic 3 Kilbirnie Ladeside 3 (Kilbirnie won 4-3 on penalties)\n\nAdmission: £6\n\nSaturday 4 November 2017, 14.00, Newbyres Park\n\nScottish Cup Second Round Replay between Arniston Rangers of the East Premier League and West Central Division One’s Wishaw Juniors.\n\nA quick return to Newbyres after seeing Arniston beat St Andrews in the Fife and Lothians Cup in October.\n\nSince that game in October, Arniston went to St Andrews in the league and got a draw, before a home fixture with Kirriemuir was a victim of the weather. They then visited Wishaw and came from behind to draw 1-1 which brought about the replay.\n\nAndy Watson was carried off at Wishaw in a neck brace after just four minutes, but was fit enough to take his place in the team for the rematch.\n\nWishaw Juniors began life as Wishaw Thistle in 1885 and had some early success in the Junior game and won the Junior Cup in 1888. They then turned senior, but were unsuccessful in gaining entry to the football league. They still managed to pick up silverware, but mainly in Lanarkshire competitions.\n\nFollowing the First World War, they reinvented themselves as Wishaw YMCA Juniors in 1919-20 as they returned to Junior football, enjoying early success before shortening their name to Wishaw Juniors in 1924 when the club switched to the Lanarkshire Junior League.\n\nRe-organisation of Scottish Junior football in 1968 saw Lanarkshire clubs joining with those from the greater Glasgow area to form the Central Junior League. Further re-organisation saw the Central League amalgamate with the Ayrshire Junior League to form the West Region in 2002. The vast majority of this spell saw Wishaw in the bottom league, but they gained promotion out of the bottom Division in 2013-14.\n\nWhile league success has been hard to come by, Wishaw have saved their best performances for cup ties.\n\nWith the Wishaw manager Chris McGroarty and his team leaving to take over at Kilsyth Rangers in August, John Brogan took over the reins. They’ve started this season well and are challenging at the top of Central League Division 1.\n\nAround 100 turned up to watch the action.\n\nCoffey shot towards the Arniston goal from the half way line straight from kick off and it wasn’t a million miles away from causing Cornet concern in the Arniston goal.\n\nA good run down the left by Wishaw’s Collinder in 2 minutes saw him cross into the box, but the ball eluded those in the middle.\n\nThe visitors continued their good start with Crawford chipping the ball into the box just out of reach for the strikers before a header went wide of the goal.\n\nArniston first showed their attacking intentions in the fifth minute, with McIntosh going down the left before sending a deep cross into the box where Somerville’s header came off the foot of the post before going wide.\n\nKindlan and McGuire did some good work for Wishaw coming forward in 12 minutes, but Woods cleared the cross.\n\nA Wishaw corner in 14 minutes was taken by Kindlan and Coffey got his head to the ball at the near post, but it went narrowly wide.\n\nIn 18 minutes McGuire passed to Coffey in the Arniston box. Offside was given as he was challenged, and Arniston’s Crawford got a knock to the head which resulted in him having to be replaced.\n\nWishaw’s McGeouch was caught by a late tackle from Callaghan in 24 minutes and the Arniston player was given a warning. McGuire took the free kick from about 24 yards out, but put it wide of the goal.\n\nA great turn by Kindlan on the edge of the Arniston box in 28 minutes saw him beat a defender before cutting inside and beating another, but his shot was blocked.\n\nA Watson pass in midfield in 31 minutes was blocked by Wishaw and the ball went towards the Arniston goal. Cornet was out quickly and got there first but had a collision with McGuire. Both were ok to continue.\n\nMcTernan laid the ball off to Aitchison on the edge of the Wishaw box in 32 minutes, but his shot was too high.\n\nArniston came forward again in 35 minutes with Dunn passing to McTernan who found Watson, but his shot from 22 yards was wide.\n\nUp the other end a minute later Collinder slid the ball through to Coffey, but a good tackle by Callaghan halted his progress.\n\nA fine cross by Martin from the right in 37 minutes found McGuire unmarked in the Arniston box, but he headed wide.\n\nWith 40 minutes gone Arniston’s Somerville cross from the right was sliced towards his own goal by Martin, but Thomson made an acrobatic save (which may have been one for the cameras.)\n\nWith a minute to the break Coffey sent McGuire running into the Arniston box but Cornet raced from his line to get something on his shot to send it behind. From the corner McGuire went down in the box and the referee awarded a penalty, booking Waugh. McGuire took the kick himself and sent Cornet the wrong way to give Wishaw the lead.\n\nOne nil to Wishaw at the break and they had been the better side in a competitive first half.\n\nArniston had the ball in the net within 2 minutes of the start of the second half, but offside was given.\n\nO’Kane’s corner for Wishaw in 52 minutes saw Sconville go up to challenge Arniston keeper Cornet and the ball dropped behind them, but the defence managed to get the ball away.\n\nAn attempted clearance by Arniston’s Aitchison in 53 minutes cannoned off Collinder and fell to the feet of Coffey, but his shot was wild.\n\nMcAfferty threaded a pass through the Arniston defence in 56 minutes for Coffey, but Cornet blocked. The rebound hit McGuire and went straight back to the keeper.\n\nIn 60 minutes Aitchison sent Fairgrieve away down the right for Arniston. He shot for goal under pressure from Crawford, but it was straight at Thomson.\n\nA good ball from the right by Martin in 61 minutes gave Coffey the chance to head at the Arniston goal, but he put his header wide.\n\nWith 63 minutes gone, Jeffrey was brought down by Crawford in the Wishaw box for the second penalty of the afternoon. Also at the same end. This time there was no booking for the culprit. Watson had put the ball into the net, but the referee had already given the spot kick. Callaghan took it and although Thomson got his fingers to it, he couldn’t keep it out. 1-1.\n\nFairgrieve went down in the Wishaw box in 65 minutes, with Sconville in close attendance, as he tried to get on the end of a free kick, but nothing was given.\n\nA minute later and Wishaw’s Martin was caught late, but the referee didn’t see it.\n\nThe game looked to be fading away as the minutes passed, with little of note happening for a while.\n\nWatson turned well in the Wishaw box in 81 minutes, but he lashed wide.\n\nA terrible pass out from his own box by Cornet in 83 minutes was straight to McGuire instead of the intended Deland, and the Wishaw striker took the ball into the box before shooting into the corner to put Wishaw back in front.\n\nWith 5 minutes left Kindlan crossed to the back post and McGeachie headed into the Arniston net to make it three for Wishaw.\n\nWishaw keeper Thomson came out of his goal in 88 minutes and missed the ball, giving Watson the simple task of sending the ball into the empty net and the hosts were only a goal behind again.\n\nWith a minute left of the regulation 90, Deland set up Watson on the edge of the Wishaw box, but his shot was blocked.\n\nDeep into injury time there was a final chance for Arniston to send the game to penalties when they won a corner. Keeper Cornet was up for it too, but Wishaw survived to go through to round three.\n\nAn entertaining affair which Wishaw probably deserved to win. Arniston made more of an impression in the second half, but defensive lapses cost them dearly.\n\nMcTernan and Devlin (whose early withdrawal was a surprise) played well for Arniston, while McGeouch, McGuire and McAfferty stood out for Wishaw.\n\nThanks to @WishawJuniorFan on Twitter for help with the Wishaw team.\n\nFull Time: Arniston Rangers 2 Wishaw Juniors 3\n\nAdmission: £6\n\nArniston Rangers: 1 Dale Cornet, 2 Ross Aitchison, 5 Stephen Woods, 4 David Dunn (Callaghan 20), 3 Michael Deland, 9 Kieran Somerville, 8 Scott Devlin (Jeffrey 54), 6 Darren McTernan, 11 Liam McIntosh, 10 Andy Watson, 7 Scott Waugh (Fairgrieve (46).

After paying your way in, there is a refreshment outlet on your right and as you walk up a hill, there is a choice of two enclosures, A smaller one to the right which seems to house away fans and a larger home one on the left. Cars can drive straight in and either park in the car park or go round and park at the side of the pitch. I counted 21 cars round the pitch and on a particularly blowy day, some may have stayed inside to watch proceedings. It’s a tidy ground and has everything you’d need. The pitch looks in pretty good nick too.\n\nLanark United were formed in 1920 and have been at their current home since a year after that date. They are known as ‘The Yowes’, which came about after they initially moved to Moor Park, which was originally a field as part of Newmains Farm, and they had to regularly chase sheep, or ‘the ewes’ off the pitch before a game.\n\nEarly success arrived after their formation, winning the Lanarkshire Hozier Cup in 1924 and also winning it the next two seasons. The Lanarkshire Junior Cup was won in season 1926-27 and again in 1934-35.\n\nDespite the initial triumphs, it was 1960 before the next silverware made its way to Lanark, with the Hozier Cup being won again. The ‘70s saw more sustained success, with a league win, in the Central League Division C in 1970, the Central Sectional League Cup and Central League Cup in 1976 and the West of Scotland Cup in 1977 all procured.\n\nThe Central League Division 2 title was won in 1984-85 and again in 1995-96. After the latter win, they were promoted again the next season as winners of the Division 1 title.\n\nThe new millennium started off well, with Lanark winning the Central League Division 1 title in 2000-01 but after the West Region of the Scottish Junior Football Association was formed in 2002, they fell back into the Central League Division 2 in 2004. The following season saw them win the Evening Times Cup and then 2006-07 the Central League Cup.\n\nSeason 2007-08 saw Lanark gain promotion to Division 1 again and they won the Clydesdale Cup in 2009 and retained it a year later. Their stay in Division 1 ended in season 2014-15.\n\nLast season saw them lose out on promotion by a point.\n\nManager John Brogan left just before the start of the season to take over at local rivals Wishaw Juniors. Defender Paul Burns was put in interim charge and has since been given the job on a permanent basis.\n\nAndy Crilley, Cammy Lawson, David O’Donnell, Gareth Halford and Kieran McGurk have all departed United. Coming in are Conor Stewart from Larkhall Thistle, midfielders Darren Sneddon from Wishaw HSFP, Kyle Gillespie from Clydesdale Amateurs, and Jack Stubbs from Eddlewood Amateurs, goalkeeper Jonathan Duncan from Croftfoot Amateurs, defenders Ben Fraser from Rossvale Juniors 21s and James Brophy from Shotts, and forwards Martin Hannaway from Forth Wanderers and Shaun McKenna have also signed on.\n\nThey sat in fifth place in the league coming into the game, having won 3, drawn 4 and lost 2. Their most recent outing saw them defeat bottom of the table Newmains United by twelve goals to nil.\n\nWe last saw Dalkeith Thistle in a pre-season friendly against Hearts Under 20s. Since then, left back James Redpath has left the club, with central defender Ross Connell joining from Danderhall Amateurs.\n\nIt was a difficult start to the season for Dalkeith, with the fixtures giving them a tough opening to the campaign. Losses to Fauldhouse United, Haddington Athletic and Musselburgh Athletic in their opening three games saw them concede 13 and score 3, but a 2-0 win at Tranent Juniors got them back on track. Three further defeats were followed by an 8-2 win at Whitburn and that inconsistency has continued. They currently sit in ninth spot, with 4 wins, 8 defeats and a draw.\n\nBoth teams got a bye in the first round.\n\nWith no official linesmen at the game, the traditional one from each club ran the lines, with the home one kitted out looking as if he was trying to avoid a biological attack. It had been a while since I’d been in Lanark, but had things really got that bad?\n\nI wasn’t able to get a response in my requests for team names and numbers, so apologies if any are incorrect.\n\nLanark went with three at the back and two up front with five in midfield. Dalkeith went with 4-4-2.\n\nThere were around 110 at the game with a strong wind prevalent.\n\nWith three minutes gone, Dalkeith’s Wales took possession and had a strike at goal from around 25 yards, but he pulled it wide.\n\nThe visitors were making the early running and in 7 minutes, McMillan chipped the ball up to the back post, but under pressure, Laing couldn’t get his header on target.\n\nA good move by Lanark in 8 minutes saw them work the ball down the left and the cutback was dummied in the box, but a defender whacked it clear.\n\nA long throw into the Dalkeith box in 10 minutes wasn’t cleared properly and Kearney showed great feet to move into the box past two defenders, but he shot straight at Findlay.\n\nIn 12 minutes, Robertson played the ball up the left for Dalkeith to Bain. He put a great ball across goal, but nobody could get a touch in the middle.\n\nFraser passed to Kearney on the right in 13 minutes and he raced into the Dalkeith box on the right, but his cross/shot across goal drifted wide.\n\nA poor pass by Dalkeith’s Whitson in 20 minutes was picked up by Gallagher and Kearney was free in the middle. He decided to go for goal himself and Findlay made a bit of a meal of his shot, but gathered at the second attempt.\n\nAfter a bit of jostling between Lanark’s Stubbs and Dalkeith’s Laing in 23 minutes, they received a lengthy telling off from the referee.\n\nBain received the ball to his feet on the edge of the Lanark box in 25 minutes and turned away from a defender into the box, but he dragged his shot wide.\n\nO’Donnell worked the ball through to McKenna in the Dalkeith box in 28 minutes, but the referee gave offside as Findlay saved his shot.\n\nStraight up the other end and Bain was almost on the end of a cross into the Lanark box, but a defender managed to turn the ball behind.\n\nSome good football by Lanark in 34 minutes got Schoneville to the bye-line and his cross was just too high for the leaping Fraser.\n\nA fine cross to the back post by Robertson in 37 minutes was met by a looping header from Leslie, but it dropped just wide of the other Lanark post.\n\nLanark had a shout for a penalty in 40 minutes when Lawson’s long range shot looked to hit the arm of a defender in the box, but it was by his side and the ref waved away the appeals.\n\nDalkeith broke straight up the park and McMillan was played in on the right of the box, but his shot came back off the bar. Wales got to the rebound first, but his shot was smothered by Colquhoun.\n\nLanark won the break of the ball just outside the Dalkeith box in 41 minutes and Kearney took a touch to create some space before rifling a low shot into the corner of the net to give the hosts the lead.\n\nA minute after the goal Dalkeith came forward and Laing passed to Bain on the left. His cross was sliced towards his own goal and it hit Colquhoun in the Lanark goal and spun wide.\n\nWith a minute to the break, Leslie cut in from the right for Dalkeith and made his way to the edge of the box, but his effort at goal was wide.\n\nThe last action of the half saw McKenna cross to the back post for Fraser, but his header was taken comfortable by Findlay in the Dalkeith goal.\n\nOne nil at the interval in what had been a fairly even first half.\n\nMcMillan put a decent ball into the Lanark box in 51 minutes for Bain, but the defence blocked his shot.\n\nA nice turn and shot by Lanark’s Kearney in 52 minutes saw Findlay throw a hand out and manage to block the ball and he was able to catch it as it spun in the air.\n\nDevlin took the ball into the Lanark half in 54 minutes and left it for Leslie who shot over the bar from about 24 yards out.\n\nA long throw into the Dalkeith box was headed clear to the edge of the box in 57 minutes and Fraser struck a volley goalwards. It was well hit, but it was too close to Findlay.\n\nThere was some pushing and shoving in the Dalkeith box in 62 minutes as tempers started to flare.\n\nWales played the ball wide to Bain in 65 minutes and he burst past Lawson on the left. He cut the ball back, but the defence cleared.\n\nAnnetts received the ball in the Dalkeith box in 68 minutes. He lost his footing but still managed to poke it to Fraser, but his shot was saved by Findlay.\n\nIn 69 minutes O’Donnell looked to shoot at the Dalkeith goal from the left side of the box, but saw the ball go across goal. Fraser got a touch to it and it came to McKenna who hammered a low shot into the opposite corner to double Lanark’s lead.\n\nAs the ball ran through to Colquhoun in the Lanark goal in 71 minutes, Bain continued his run and bundled over the keeper. The home fans wanted a red card, but the referee made do with speaking to him.\n\nLaing put a free kick into the Lanark box in 72 minutes and Bain headed it towards goal, but it was straight at Colquhoun.\n\nLanark broke quickly in 73 minutes and McKenna and Schoneville worked the ball to Annetts, but he couldn’t get power in his shot.\n\nGallagher wasn’t happy after feeling he had been caught by an elbow from Dalkeith’s McMillan. When McMillan got the ball in 74 minutes, he chased after him and had a kick at him. Again, the referee decided not to show a card.\n\nDevlin was next to go in late on Colquhoun after he had caught the ball and this time the referee had lost patience and booked him.\n\nIn 76 minutes Devlin hit a wind assisted shot from 25 yards which flashed over the Lanark bar.\n\nA clever ball forward by Schoneville in 79 minutes sent McKenna running towards the Dalkeith goal, but Connell made a fine challenge to halt his progress.\n\nThe next scuffle saw Lanark’s O’Donnell and Dalkeith’s McGlashan look as if they were taking swings at each other while both were on the deck.\n\nWith 5 minutes left Dalkeith won a free kick on the corner of the box and Wales’ delivery was headed in at the back post by Devlin to give Dalkeith a lifeline.\n\nIn the aftermath of the goal, all hell broke loose as Dalkeith tried to get the ball back with skirmishes all over the place. When the dust settled the ref showed Colquhoun the red card and Gallagher a yellow.\n\nHe then marched into the Dalkeith half and booked Whitson. The defender must have said something and with the Dalkeith players crowding round the official, he showed Whitson a second yellow and sent him off.\n\nWith no goalkeeper on the bench for Lanark, defender Lawson went in goals. It took a long time before the game got started again.\n\nSchoneville was suffering from cramp as we approached 90 minutes.\n\nTwo minutes into injury time a Lanark free kick from halfway came to Kearney on the edge of the Dalkeith box. He chested the ball down and swivelled and hit a volley which took a nick off Connell before going wide.\n\nWith Lanark doing their best to waste as much time as possible, Dalkeith striker McMillan was heard to shout “referee, they’re making a c*nt of you”.\n\nLeslie finally got a Dalkeith shot away at the stand-in keeper in 93 minutes, but it didn’t unduly trouble Lawson.\n\nLanark’s O’Donnell and Stubbs both picked up bookings as the lengthy stoppage was added on.\n\nWith 96 minutes on the watch there was a bit of scramble in the Lanark box, but they got the ball away.\n\nDalkeith won a corner in the seventh minute of injury time and even their keeper was up for it, but a foul was awarded to Lanark as the ball came over.\n\nThe final whistle came seconds later to confirm Lanark’s victory.\n\nQuite a game on our inaugural visit to Moor Park. Two sendings off, a stand-in keeper, three goals, penalty claims, woodwork hit and a win for the underdog. It’s hard not to like the Junior Cup.\n\nA great win for Lanark who matched their more illustrious opponents and it was hard to grudge them their win, despite the game being very close. Dalkeith would be very disappointed not to get at least a draw, but both teams had chances and it could have gone either way. It was amazing that Dalkeith only had one shot at goal in the ten minutes they faced a defender in the Lanark goal. The strong wind made it a difficult afternoon for the players, but there was certainly no lack of commitment from those on the pitch.\n\nFor the home side, Lawson, Kearney and Schoneville were best, while Devlin, Connell and Bain were Dalkeith’s top players on the day.\n\nFull Time: Lanark United 2 Dalkeith Thistle 1\n\nAdmission: £5\n\nLanark United: 1 Allan Colquhoun, 2 Cameron Lawson, 3 Jack Stubbs, 4 Shaun Gallagher, 5 James Brophy, 6 Stuart Annetts, 7 Ben Fraser, 8 Peter O’Donnell, 9 Shaun McKenna (15 41), 10 Ronan Kearney, 11 Scott Schoneville.

They’ve had two wins in the Super League since then, most recently a 4-1 win at Broughty Athletic and sit two points clear at the top. With three cup ties won in three different competitions it’s been a great start for the Midlothian side. In their thirteen competitive games this season, they’ve won 11 and drawn 2.\n\nSince we last saw Penicuik, striker Sean Jamieson has joined from Bonnyrigg Rose, with Keith Lough going the other way.\n\nWe haven’t seen Lochee United since a 1-1 draw in the East Premier League at Arniston Rangers at the end of season 2015-16 season.\n\nThe area of Lochee is in the City of Dundee and United were formed in 1892. They began as a juvenile side before becoming an amateur team following the second world war. They became members of the Junior grade in 1959 when they moved into their present home at Thomson Park.\n\nLochee’s Junior experience began in the then Dundee Junior Football Association, later to become the Tayside Region Junior Football Association. Their first Junior trophy was the Courier Cup in 1965, but it was in the 1970s and ‘80s when they really started to make their mark, winning seventeen trophies between 1977 and 1987.\n\nRelegation in 1993 came at the end of a poor spell and although they went back to the top league in Tayside the following season, their challenge for silverware appeared to have ended.\n\nWhen the East Super League was formed in 2002, United won the Tayside Premier League and after finishing fourth in their first season in the Super league (and winning two cups), they won the Super League title in 2004-05. They also reached the Junior Cup Final in the same season, for the only time in their history to date, but lost to local rivals Tayport.\n\nThe trophies continued to make their way to Thomson Park and they also won the Super League title for a second time in 2007-08. This qualified them for the Scottish Cup and they reached the third round before losing out in a replay to Ayr United.\n\nA poor league season in 2008-09 almost cost them their Super League status, but the season ended on a high when they became the first side from Tayside to win the East of Scotland Cup.\n\nTop five finishes in the next two seasons with no trophy wins, but they did make the semi final of the Junior Cup in 2009-10.\n\nFurther cups were won by ‘the Bluebells’ in 2012 and 2014, but season 2014-15 saw them drop into the East Premier League after finishing bottom. It was only to be one season away from the Super League as they returned at the first time of asking.\n\nLast season saw Lochee finish in fifth place.\n\nThey started the season in good form and came into the game with Penicuik in fifth spot, 6 points behind their opponents and having played a game more. They had won six, drawn two and lost three, with two of those defeats coming in their previous two league games. Their previous game had seen them lose 3-1 at home to Bo’ness United. Last season, Lochee beat Penicuik home and away.\n\nGraham Hay, Paul Blackwood, Ryan Winter, Connor Gray and Darren Clarkson had all left the club since the end of last season. Coming in were forward Craig Smith from Downfield, with keeper Mark Stewart, defender Danny Millar and midfielder Grant Lawson all signing on. Goalkeeper Jordan Millar joined on loan from Montrose two days before the game.\n\nLochee went into the game missing both first choice central defenders. Penicuik were without top scorer Lumbert Kateleza and had newly capped Scotland Junior International Andy Forbes on the bench, fresh (or otherwise) from getting married the week before.\n\nThere were around 200 in attendance.\n\nLochee came forward in the opening minute with Ritchie playing the ball to McComiskie on the right. He put a dangerous cross into the box which was turned behind by Hume.\n\nUp the other end a minute later, Somerville passed to Jamieson on the edge of the box, but his shot was too close to Millar in the Lochee goal.\n\nIn 4 minutes, Lawson received a throw-in on the left and fired the ball across the face of the Penicuik goal, but nobody was able to get a touch.\n\nCameron won the ball for Lochee on the half way line in 8 minutes and Lawson played the ball wide to McComiskie on the right. His cross into the box saw Hamilton get a foot to it, but the ball came back to Lawson who took a touch before firing into the net to give the visitors the lead. Penicuik claimed Lawson had controlled the ball with his hand before he shot, but the referee ignored the claims.\n\nLawson featured again in 10 minutes when he got the ball at the corner of the box on the left and cut inside before seeing his shot turned behind by Allison.\n\nLochee came forward again in 13 minutes with McComiskie picking out Lawson on the left. He went past MacDonald before cutting the ball back for Deane who side footed the ball into the corner to make it 2-0.\n\nThe referee played advantage in 15 minutes as Somerville"
