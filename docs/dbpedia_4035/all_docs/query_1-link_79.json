        "text": "I was not satisfied with the first half, the first half hour for sure. We lacked intensity in the duels. There were a lot of long balls where we didn’t win the first duel, also not the second duel, also not the third duel. Because of that we came under pressure.\n\nWith the ball, we were not calm enough, not brave enough to do the right things and be in the right positions like we want. So it was really important to have those 15 minutes during half-time to put things straight, show them where we were going wrong and change that.\n\nIt changed a lot in the second half. We took control of the game and played better football. We had good chances also and we dominated the second half.\n\nI expect that to happen during the game, and that’s why we need experience on the pitch to guide things. Those are things to work on for the future.\n\nYou always need to see whether it was the correct result or not. I think it was a fair result today. The first half was for Hearts, the second half was for us.\n\nWe had good chances to finish off the game. I prefer to be decisive in the second half because then the other team cannot come back. We were really close with Cyriel’s header, against the crossbar and the post - that doesn’t happen that much. And we had good offensive actions, with new players coming into the team and recognising the spaces better.\n\nIt’s a progression in that way, and we need to say that it was a fair point that we got. Of course I wanted to get the three points like all the players, but we need to look forward now and not be sticking in results all the time.\n\nTuesday is again a massive game, an important game against a team who could rest this weekend to be fresh on Tuesday. We need to put all our focus on that.\n\nI was confident (it wouldn’t be a penalty). My arms were right by my side but you never know what can happen. It goes through your head a little bit but I knew I was safe. We didn’t get the three points so it wasn’t the perfect day for me. The result wasn't exactly what we wanted to go out and do today but I think there were good bits in there that we can look at going forward and bits we can get better at. It’s going to be a long season so it’s about us picking ourselves up after games like today and making sure we correct things.\n\nWe had chances to win the game but of course they had chances it’s well but it’s about being more ruthless in both boxes. I enjoyed (the midfield battle) but I’m not happy because we didn’t get the result we wanted. I’ve settled in really quickly. The understanding is there - it’s just about making sure we’re all on the same page when the subs are coming on as well and making sure we’re doing the same things. You could see that at times today, there was chances at the end and it’s about us putting them away and being more clinical."
