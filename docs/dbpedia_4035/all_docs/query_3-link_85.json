        "text": "Doddie Weir OBE was one of rugby’s most recognisable personalities. He earned 61 caps for Scotland during a successful playing career, represented the British and Irish Lions on their successful tour to South Africa in 1997, and won championships with his two club sides, Melrose and Newcastle Falcons.\n\nA talented, committed and athletic lock forward, Doddie then faced his biggest challenge. In June 2017 the Scot revealed he was suffering from Motor Neuron Disease. From the outset, Doddie was driven to help fellow sufferers and seek ways to further research into this, as yet, incurable disease.\n\nIn November 2017, Doddie and his trustees launched the registered charity, My Name’5 Doddie Foundation. Our vision is simple: A World Free of MND.\n\nThe number “5” is a special number for the Foundation. It features in the Foundation’s name and is a reference to Doddie’s playing number for his clubs, Melrose and Newcastle Falcons, and the jersey he wore when he earned his 61 caps for Scotland.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to helping improve the lives of those affected by Motor Neuron Disease. We help to fund grants, giving considerable sums to our friends at MND Association and MND Scotland to administer to individuals and families living with MND.\n\nHow We Will Do This\n\nWe work in partnership with existing frontline care providers to ensure the holistic needs of patients and their families are understood and met. We do this through supporting our friends at MND Scotland and MND Association who conduct the due diligence and manage these grants on our behalf. To find out more about the grants and to apply, head to either MND Scotland or MND Association’s grant pages.\n\nWe initiate and encourage research to better understand the information and support needs of MND patients and their families.\n\nWe engage with patients through the provision of information about latest developments and the opportunity to shape research priorities clinical trials and rapidly translating results into clinical practice."
