        "text": "County Derry footballer Lauren Wade has this week signed for Heart of Midlothian.\n\nThe Coleraine native was playing for English side Reading in the previous two seasons before her transfer this summer across the border.\n\nWade posted on Instagram her excitement for her new chapter in Scotland.\n\nIt said: “Delighted to have signed for @heartswomenfc. Looking forward to getting started.”\n\nShe will join fellow Northern Irish internationals Joely Andrews and Kerry Beattie in the Scottish capital of Edinburgh.\n\nA move away from Reading was expected following financial difficulties over the past 12 months for the club.\n\nThe owners have made cuts across the board, leading to fears that the women's team would be scrapped altogether.\n\nBut Reading withdrew from the Championship to play in the fifth-tier of English football.\n\nWade thanked her previous club as she starts this new chapter at Hearts.\n\nShe wrote on Instagram : “Thank you @readingwomenfc for the last two years.\n\n“Thank you to all the staff, my teammates and our incredible fans. Even with the ups and downs, the challenges we faced, the incredible people I have met I have loved every part of the journey. These are memories I will cherish forever.\n\n“A special mention goes to the incredible fans. Your support never went unnoticed.\n\n“Excited for what’s next.”"
