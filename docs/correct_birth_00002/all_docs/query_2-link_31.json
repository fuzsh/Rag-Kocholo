        "text": "Most people think of Bob Dylan as a folk musician but he had a tremendous influence on the history of rock music. He was born in 1941 in Duluth, Minnesota. He grew up listening to country music before discovering rock in the 1950s. That lead in turn to blues and folk music; specifically the songs of Woody Guthrie ( Guthrie wrote \"This Land is Your Land\"). The first major turning point in his life came in 1961 when he went to visit Guthrie, who was dying of a hereditary degenerative disease called Huntington's Chorea at a hospital in New Jersey. Guthrie's songs were a combination of poetry and political activism and Dylan idolized him. The next couple of years were spent bouncing around coffeehouses in New York City's Greenwich Village. It was there that Dylan began to craft songs that were unlike anything else anyone was writing. He was \"discovered\" by Columbia Records' John Hammond and he released his first album in 1962. The following year, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan came out featuring several social protest songs including \"Blowin' in the Wind,\" \"Master of War,\" and \"A Hard Rain's A -Gonna Fall.\" By 1964, Dylan had become one of America's pre-eminent musicians. His music was often simple but the lyrics could be profound (listen to \"The Times They Are A Changin'\").\n\nIn 1965 Dylan turned the folk scene upside down when he appeared at the Newport Folk Festival backed by an electric band. To traditionalists, he had betrayed his heritage but others saw him as a pioneer. His appearance at Newport launched the genre known as folk-rock and among the groups he inspired were Buffalo Springfield, the Byrds, and Crosby, Stills, and Nash.\n\nIn the late 1960s Dylan dabbled in country music (Nashville Skyline) and a decade later, following a serious motorcycle accident, he came out with Slow Train Coming. This album, with songs like \"Gotta Serve Somebody,\" revealed a strong Christian faith.\n\nAlthough Dylan has never had a #1 single, several of his albums did reach #1 on the charts. These included Planet Waves (1974), Blood on the Tracks (1975), and Desire (1976)."
