        "text": "Irish-born Conor McPherson had already established quite a career for himself on London and New York theater stages when Bob Dylan came calling with an offer: The playwright could use any of his songs in a new work if he came up with a good concept. The resultant Girl From the North Country features the cast performing 20 Dylan songs as part of its tale of travelers at a Depression-era guesthouse in Duluth, Minnesota, where Robert Zimmerman (Dylan) was born.\n\nAfter successful engagements in London and on Broadway, where it was nominated for seven Tonys and won one, the touring musical comes to the Aronoff Center for the Arts October 17â29. (By coincidence, Dylan performs October 20 at the Andrew J Brady Music Center.)\n\nHow did this partnership with Dylan come about?\n\nMy agent said people had come to him wondering if doing a show based on the music of Bob Dylan was something I was interested in doing for the theater. I said, âThat doesnât sound like a great idea to me,â because Iâd never done a musical and I wasnât sure if Dylanâs songs were musical theater-type songs. Then, out of the blue, I had the idea of a show set in the 1930s with a kind of Eugene OâNeillâtype of feeling. I felt Bobâs songs could fit into that.\n\nSo I wrote out an idea for a story set during the Great Depression in a boarding house up in Minnesota, where the guests were looking for somewhere to live because times were hard. I thought that could generate an interesting scenario for the story. I sent it off to my agent, and in a couple of days I was told that Bob Dylan really liked the idea and, if I wanted to proceed, I had his blessing to use his songs.\n\nHow would you describe this compared to the many âjukeboxâ musicals that tell bits of their subjectâs biography between performing their songs?\n\nWeirdly, it never occurred to me to think of this as a biographical story. I suppose I knew that if thatâs what he wanted me to do, probably thereâs a million people he could get to do that. So maybe he was looking for something else.\n\nIâve discovered over the years that Broadway is a kind of genre when it comes to musical theater. It has a certain kind of sound and a certain kind of energy. In the shows that are successful and popular, you can tell the songs are from a musical when you hear them. Quite often they have a certain slightly overwrought energy, which works in that genre.\n\nWith Bob Dylan songs, first of all, what are they about? Thatâs still up for debate. Theyâre poetic and impressionistic a lot of the time. In terms of driving a narrative forward in a show, theyâre not obvious choices. Just in terms of 90 percent of what might be available to go and see if you wanted to buy a Broadway ticket for tonight, youâre probably not going to get a lot of songs like Dylan writes in any of those other shows. So it wasnât obvious to me what a musical theaterâtype presentation of Bob Dylan would be like.\n\nHaving said that, I know they tried to do another Dylan musical in the past, which I donât think was a biographical show either. [In 2006, Twyla Tharp brought The Times They Are a-Changin,â a musical of Dylan songs, to Broadway for a short run.]\n\nYouâve talked about being able to remove the songs from Dylanâs own biography, but thatâs not completely the case. The show is set in Duluth, where he was born in 1941. He grew up in nearby Hibbing. Was it critical that you had that direct connection to Dylan?\n\nThe idea to set it in Duluth in the years before Bob was born there felt like a beautiful way to honor him. In a sense, thereâs the idea that things change when Bob comes into the world, the same way that things change when Jesus Christ comes into the world. There are prophets who come into the world, and things change. I feel that artistically about Bobâs presence, so for me maybe there were those kinds of feelings going on.\n\nI wanted to ask about the Dylan song âGirl From the North Countryâ and whether using it for the title of the musical came after your vision for a show set in Minnesota.\n\nI like the song anyway, and then the title was good for us. The weird thing is I think the North Country that Bob is referring to is in England. That song is based on his interpretation of songs like âScarborough Fair.â Itâs an early folk song for Bob, and a lot of early folk songs are a development of other folk songs.\n\nThat didnât really click with me until after we had done the show, because I thought the âGirl From the North Countryâ did refer to the northern U.S. But I donât think people in America really refer to those states as the North Country, do they? For me, though, it works geographically for our show.\n\nAnd in our show, that song is done pretty much a cappella, with beautiful choral backing underneath, and itâs actually an underscore while someone is talking about something else in the show. So, in a way, the title song of the show isnât foregrounded in the showâitâs hidden there in the background. I guess itâs like lots of things about this show, and like Bob Dylan: There are many unexpected things.\n\nMight I ask you about using âLike a Rolling Stoneâ?\n\nBecause theyâd given me complete freedom to use any songs I wanted, they sent me all his albums. I set about listening to everything. âRolling Stoneâ is one of Bobâs most famous songs, if not the most famous, and also happens to be a really good song. Itâs also such an influential songâa lot of musicologists would see it as a landmark in the development of popular music. Itâs just too big to ignore.\n\nAlso, the lyrics are particularly striking, being about the fear of destitution and the fear of being homeless. For a pop song to articulate that very freely is so unusual, so revolutionary. And it has a pretty chord sequence in its verses and bridge, and then its chorus is really three-chord rock and roll, which gives it that big release. Itâs such a good song, it can be performed in different ways. Itâs very well built.\n\nHow about one with a very mysterious lyric, âSweetheart Like You?â\n\nThatâs a lovely song, from Bobâs album Infidels. Wow, some great lyrics in the song. I mean, oh my God! Thatâs just Bob doing a beautiful free associationâheâs talking to you, heâs singing to you, itâs kind of like a love song and yet it also seems far more philosophical than that. Itâs a religious song perhaps. Itâs terrific.\n\nOne more song, also one of his most famous: âForever Young.â\n\nSuch a lovely song. Itâs almost like a hymn, that song. It could be sung at a wedding or a funeral or a baptism or any of those things. Itâs a beautiful song of blessing and healing. I think thereâs a lot of warmth and goodness that come from the sentiments in a lot of Bobâs songs. This is one of pure benediction, so having that song toward the end of our show is really moving for its healing feeling.\n\nI read he saw a show and was moved to tears. How do you respond to making Bob Dylan cry at the beauty of his own work and of course the beauty of your work, too?\n\nThrough the whole process we never really had any contact with Bob. He gave us that freedom. I asked his manager, âDoes Bob want to see a tape of a show or a rehearsal run-through?â He said, âI think the way Bob feels is heâs just going to let you do it the way you want to do it, because if he says something, youâre going to feel pressured to change what youâre doing.â\n\nSo we never knew what he thought until he spoke about it. I wasnât there the night he came. He slipped in from the back of the theater, watched it from the audience, and then left. When we heard what he thought about it and how moved he was, I suppose it was the ultimate praise. Getting that reaction from that particular audience member, itâs like âjob done.â Even if the whole world hates this show, Iâve done my job. (The show has gotten strong praise from critics and audiences and was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Musical.)\n\nSince then, Bob has written to us and sent us lovely gifts. When heâs met members of the cast, heâs been very gracious and spoken to them about it. Heâs been hugely supportive of the show.\n\nWhat kind of gifts?"
