        "text": "Abram H. Zimmerman, Bobâs father, was born in America, in Duluth, Minnesota, on October 19, 1911, into a family of four other children. If you believe the 1920 census details, Abe was the first of the family born in the USA. Itâs more reasonable to believe the 1930 census, which says that Jack/Jake was born in the USA a year ahead of Abe. Abeâs fatherâBobâs paternal grandfatherâis Zigman Zimmerman; his Hebrew name is Zisel. âI donât know how they got a German name,â said Dylan in the 1978 Playboy interview. Zigman was born in the thrusting Russian port of Odessa on Christmas Day 1875, and grew up in an atmosphere of active, vicious anti-Semitism. He seems to have run a shoe-making business before he fled Tsar Nicholas IIâs pogroms in 1906. His brother Wolfe not only stayed behind but became a soldier in the Russian army. Zigman arrived into the US in 1907, through Ellis Island to New York City, like so many others. From there he moved north-west until he arrived in Duluth. He worked as a peddler and sent for his family soon afterwards: by 1910 they had arrived. His wife Anna, formerly Chana Greenstein, born in Odessa on March 16, 1878, had given birth to three children before their emigration: Maurice, aged eight on arrival; Minnie, aged six; and Paul, four. They squeezed into a small apartment at 221/2 West 1st Street, where we presume the fourth child, Jake, was born (though the 1930 census says he was born in Wisconsin). Either way, before the next brother, Max, came along in 1914, the Zimmermans had moved to a house: 221 Lake Avenue North, Duluth. It is the only one of the houses Bob Dylanâs father lived in as a child and as a young adult that does not still exist. Zigman was still a peddler when Abe was born, but by 1917, Zigman, now styling himself Zigmond H. Zimmerman, was a âsolicitorâ working for the Prudential Life Insurance Co. He had obtained his naturalisation papers in 1916, but when the USA entered the Great War in 1918, the Zimmermans were forced to register as aliens. His wife Anna told the registrar she was a dressmaker, and that she spoke âa little Englishâ. Zigman could speak it but not read it. By 1920 he was a dry goods salesman; later that decade he opened his shoe store but it failed, and by 1930 he was a salesman in someone elseâs. All the same, in 1925 they moved again, to a two-storey house at 725 East 3rd Street. By 1930 the oldest children, Maurice and Minnie had left home, Maurice first working on railway equipment repairs and then as a railway ticket inspector, while Minnie worked as a typist at the Duluth Herald newspaper. Still living at home, 24-year-old Paul had become packer, clerk and then salesman for the Manhattan Woollen Mills. Abe, who by the age of seven had been shining shoes and delivering newspapers, had graduated from the Central High School in 1929, was now 18 and working for the Standard Oil company, first as messenger boy and then as clerk. As Bob commented in 1978: â. . . my father never had time to go to college.â When Abe, aged 22, married 18-year-old Beatty, whom heâd met on one of her weekend trips to Duluth, on June 10, 1934 at her parentsâ house in Hibbing, his older brother Paul was best man. They honeymooned in Chicago and then came back to live in Duluth, with Abeâs mother and the three youngest brothers at 402 East 5th Street. Abeâs father, Zigman, had moved out and had an apartment in the Kinsley Apartments on West 1st Street. On July 6, 1936, he died of a heart attack in the street on 2nd Avenue West, in a heat wave, at the age of 60. Abe duly became a senior manager at Standard Oil, and ran the company union; he and Beatty moved house several more times, finally escaping Abeâs siblings by moving into the upstairs of a duplex at 519 3rd Avenue East, high up on the hillside overlooking the port and Lake Superior. Their first child, Robert Allen Zimmerman, was born at the nearby St. Maryâs Hospital on May 24, 1941, weighing in at 7lb 13oz: âabout as big as a good-sized lake trout,â writes Dave Engel, in Just Like Bob Zimmermanâs BluesâDylan in Minnesota. Robert Allenâs Hebrew name is Shabtai Zisel ben Avraham. In 1947 the family moved to Hibbing, where Abeâs brothers Maurice and Paul had set up Micka Electric Co. the year Bob was born. Abe became an appliance salesman. When Bobâs little brother David was a bit older, Beatty started working as a clerk at Feldmanâs clothing shop in the main street, Howard Street. Abe contracted polio and suffered its debilitating physical consequences all through Bobâs childhood. âMy father,â Dylan told the French paper LâExpresse in 1978, âwas a very active man, but he was stricken very early by an attack of polio. The illness put an end to all his dreams, I believe. He could hardly walk . . .â But others reported that he walked with a slight limp, not always noticeable. His mother, Anna, who had also moved to Hibbing, and lived for some years with Bobâs Uncle Maurice, moved into a nursing home in St. Paul and died there of arteriosclerosis on April 20, 1955. She had outlived her husband by almost 20 years. Her death certificate, with the information supplied by Uncle Maurice, confirmed that sheâd been born in Odessa. Dylan contradicts this, writing in Chronicles Volume One of visiting her when she still lived in Duluth: she âhad only one leg and had been a seamstress. She was a dark lady, smoked a pipe. . . . [Her] voice possessed a haunting accentâ face always set in a half-despairing expression. . . . Sheâd come to America from Odessa. . . . [but] Originally sheâd come from Turkey, sailed from Trabzon, a port town, across the Black Sea. . . . Her family was from Kagizman, a town in Turkey near the Armenian border, and the family name had been Kirghiz. My grandfatherâs parents had also come from that area. . . . My grandmotherâs ancestors had been from Constantinople.â Abe Zimmerman had a heart attack in summer 1966. On June 5, 1968 he died of a second heart attack. He was buried in Duluth."
