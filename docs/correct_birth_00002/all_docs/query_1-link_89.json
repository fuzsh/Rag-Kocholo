        "text": "Dylan became part of the folk music scene of the Greenwich Village neighborhood in New York City. He soon developed a following. Within a year of moving to the city, he came to the attention of John Hammond, an important music producer. Hammond signed Dylan to his first record contract. Dylan’s first album, Bob Dylan, was released in 1962.\n\nDylan’s first few albums kept to the folk music tradition. He began to mix folk with rock and roll on Bringing It All Back Home (1965), which included electric instruments. The transition from folk to rock music was complete with the release of Highway 61 Revisited (1965). Dylan toured throughout 1965 and 1966 until a motorcycle accident caused him to stop touring.\n\nDylan emerged two years later with John Wesley Harding (1968). The album was influenced by country music. His next album, Nashville Skyline (1969), is considered one of the albums that helped launch the genre of country rock.\n\nIn the 1970s Dylan released two chart-topping albums—Blood on the Tracks (1975) and Desire (1976). In 1979 Dylan converted to Christianity. He recorded and performed only religious material for three years.\n\nThrough the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, Dylan continued to tour and record. Oh Mercy (1989), Time Out of Mind (1997), and Love and Theft (2001) were some of his most popular albums during this time. He was still actively performing as he entered his 70s.\n\nIn addition to his recordings, Dylan has published a book of poetry, Tarantula (1971), and an autobiography, Chronicles: Volume 1 (2004). He has appeared in a number of films, including the popular documentaries Don’t Look Back (1967) and No Direction Home: Bob Dylan (2005)."
