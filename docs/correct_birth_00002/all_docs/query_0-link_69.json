        "text": "You could argue that Bob Dylan was not born 80 years ago at St. Maryâs Hospital in Duluth. However, Robert Allen Zimmerman did arrive on the evening of May 24, 1941. By the mid-â40s, he moved with his family to a house in Hibbing, and the âDylanâ bit came along during Zimmermanâs brief stint at the University of Minnesota in the late â50s.\n\nIt was only after Bob Dylan left Minnesota that he gained worldwide notoriety writing songs about the North Country and Highway 61. Aside from a return in the â70s to record some tracks for the masterpiece Blood on the Tracks, the state has mainly been just another stop on his âNever Ending Tour.â (It did end last year, but only because of coronavirus.)\n\nBits of both Dylan and Zimmerman still live on here. A fervent fan recently bought his familyâs Hibbing home. (He already owns the one in Duluth.) Thereâs the annual Duluth Dylan Fest, which takes place over his birthday, coming up May 22-30. And, in Brazilian artist Eduardo Kobraâs 2015 mural, three sets of Dylanâs eyes keep watch over Hennepin Avenue in downtown Minneapolis. St. Louis County has proclaimed the year to follow his 80th birthday will be âThe Year of Dylan.â\n\nWhen Dylan does come back to Minneapolis, itâs news. He played at the U of Mâs Northrop Auditorium the night President Barack Obama was elected in 2008, and broke into a rare moment of onstage candor to say, âIt looks like things are going to change now.â His most recent Minnesota show was in 2019 at the Mankato Civic Center. âHe was focused, impassioned, and arguably singing at his best in decades,â said the Star Tribuneâs Jon Bream. In the same review, Bream noted, âhis raspy but expressive voice is an acquired taste.â\n\nAcquired taste and an unending appetite are required for digesting the prolific yet enigmatic Dylanâs oeuvre. Many savor his near-six decades of recording and performing, sip his Heavenâs Door whiskey brand, admire his Nobel Prize in Literature, make plans for the opening of a museum dedicated to him in Oklahoma, and still theorize about the further multitudes he contains.\n\nHe is a notoriously elusive interview subject, but did grant AARP his time a few years back. âDonât try to act like youâre young,â he told the interviewer at one point. âYou could really hurt yourself.â So with no birthday quote to close, hereâs something for the occasion from his constantly quoted body of work. âHe not busy being born,â he sings in âItâs Alright, Ma (Iâm Only Bleeding),â âis busy dying.â\n\nÂ"
