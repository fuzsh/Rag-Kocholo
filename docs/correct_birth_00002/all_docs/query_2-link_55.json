Greil's playlist is:\n\nBlowin' In The Wind (1962)\n\nThe Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll (1964)\n\nAin't Talking (2006)\n\nThe Times They Are A-Changin' (1964)\n\nDesolation Row (1965)\n\nJim Jones (1992)\n\nMurder Most Fould (2020)\n\nDylan has a new book of his own out in November, The Philosophy of Modern Song, his first collection of new writing since his Chronicles: Volume One memoir appeared in 2004. This will feature more than 60 essays concentrating on songs by other artists, and in particular song lyrics techniques, as well as around 150 photos."
