        "text": "A visit to Bob Dylan’s childhood home is a must for any fan of the country music legend. This house is located in Hibbing, Minnesota, where Dylan spent his early years. It was his family’s first home. His parents moved to Minnesota in 1948 and remained there until 1959. When he went to college, he attended the University of St. Paul in Minneapolis. In 1961, he sold the home to Gregg and Donna French, who lived in St. Paul at the time.\n\nIn 2001, Pagel, who lives in Wisconsin Rapids, purchased Dylan’s first boyhood home in Duluth. He spent his early childhood there, where his mother and sister were neighbors. He began collecting Bob Dylan memorabilia when he was a teenager, and his collection has spanned the country. In 2011, he bought a three-bedroom house in Hibbing and is hoping to turn both homes into Dylan museums.\n\nThe owner of Dylan’s childhood home in Duluth is Bill Pagel. He had lived in Duluth until he was six years old. When he was a child, he went by Robert Zimmerman. His family moved to Hibbing after that, and the house is still there. Both homes have a mezuzah in the shape of a guitar and are valued at $84,000 each. Learn More\n\nBesides his childhood home, Bill Pagel owns several other pieces of Dylan memorabilia. He has 15,000 photos of the legendary singer, 4,000 concert posters, and two of his highchair. The collector does not analyze Dylan’s music. In fact, he is only a year older than the musician. Despite his impressive collection of Dylan items, Pagel says he isn’t a “fanatic” of the artist.

There’s also a museum in Hibbing, but it’s not open to the public yet. The collector plans to use the homes as a base for his touring business.\n\nThe home is an important piece of Dylan’s life. It was his childhood home, where he wrote his songs. He grew up in Duluth, but his family later moved to Hibbing. He attended the University of Minnesota there. His name, however, became Dylan in the mid-1950s. As a result, he was very inspired by the beauty and simplicity of his surroundings. He wrote some of his most beloved songs in this place.\n\nIn Hibbing, the town’s public library has a Bob Dylan exhibit in its basement. Fans continue to make the pilgrimage to the city and sign the town’s guestbook. One former teacher in Hibbing, Craig Hattam, gives tours to fans and history buffs. The street where Dylan grew up has been named Bob-Dylan Drive. In the future, he hopes to convert the street into a museum."
