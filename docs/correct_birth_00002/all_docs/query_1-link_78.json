After a redevelopment and three failed businesses since 1998, the former pharmacy now sits empty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith this location, the former Gray’s Campus Drugs certainly won’t be vacant for long. But one can’t help but wonder how long the next business will last. Change isn’t always good, apparently. If you visit Dinkytown to knock around a few of Dylan’s old haunts, be sure to stop in and grab some pancakes or a “Spike” at Al’s Breakfast – another Dinkytown institution.\n\nWant more Minnesota in your inbox?\n\nGet the latest on things to see, do, and eat around Minnesota!\n\nspinner\n\nThank you!
