He, however, later returned to Judaism. HobbiesWatching TV, Fishing, Playing Chess ControversiesThe 1965 Sexual Assault Lawsuit: Bob was once accused of sexually assaulting a woman for six weeks in 1965 when she was 12. The woman alleged that he used drugs, alcohol, and threats of violence. The woman, however, withdrew the case in 2022 after Dylan's legal team claimed that she destroyed evidence. The case was then permanently closed by the court.\n\nThe Palimony Suit: In 1994, Ruth Tyrangiel, a former lawyer, sued Dylan for USD 5 million. She claimed that they lived together like husband and wife for 17 years and Dylan promised to leave his first wife Sara Dylan for her. The case was later settled privately by them.\n\nTurning Rock: In 1965 and 1966, Bob's shift to electric rock music stirred controversy among folk enthusiast.\n\nThe Nobel Controversy: In 2016, Dylan won the Nobel Prize for Literature which soon stirred a controversy as many media outlets reported him to be the first musician and songwriter to receive it. Many debated whether songwriting should be considered as literature.

He sang ‘Some Sunday Morning’ and ‘Accentuate the Positive.’\n\nHe had learned to play piano on his own by the age of nine; he chose not to take any formal lessons at that time.\n\nHe celebrated his bar mitzvah, a coming-of-age ceremony for Jewish boys when they reach the age of 12 or 13, with around 400 guests.\n\nDylan formed various bands while he was in high school. He formed his first rock and roll band, the Golden Chords, when he was a freshman in high school.\n\nAs a kid, he loved cherry pie and often ordered it with ice cream at his high school’s diner.\n\nHis high school principal stopped his performance during the grade 10 talent show as he found the music too shocking, loud, and unsuitable.\n\nIn the late 1950s, he switched from an electric guitar to an acoustic guitar after being inspired by American singer Odetta’s folk music; he had traded his electric guitar for a flat-top Gibson.\n\nIn his 1959 Hibbing High School Yearbook, Dylan expressed his desire to join American singer and pianist Little Richard. He skipped his graduation party in 1959 and left the town that night.\n\nDylan enjoyed free access to movies in his youth as his great-grandfather owned movie theatres in Hibbing, Minnesota, at that time.\n\nHe initially enrolled at the University of Minnesota, but he dropped out at the end of his first year in May 1960.\n\nHe had joined the Sigma Alpha Mu, a college fraternity, before dropping out of the university.\n\nBob Dylan often smokes cigarettes. In college, he was infamous for tricking his friends to give him cigarettes and clothing items.\n\nIn 1960, Dylan performed with the Smothers Brothers, a duo of American folk singers, in Denver, Colorado. When he started playing unknown songs, they wanted him removed from the lineup as they thought he sounded and looked like a homeless.\n\nIn the early 1960s, he had a romantic relationship with singer and civil rights activist Mavis Staples whom he met at a folk festival. The duo bonded over their love for music and started dating. Although they considered getting married, it never happened.\n\nDylan initially used to like to joke with reporters and claim that he was an orphan and had been with a carnival since he was 13. His parents attended one of his concerts in the early 1960s and were surprised when he said in an interview that he did not know them and had lost contact with them for years.\n\nBob has often mentioned comic actor and filmmaker Charlie Chaplin as a major influence since 1961. He even paid tribute to him with his 2006 album ‘Modern Times,’ which he named after Chaplin’s 1936 film.\n\nHis first professional recording was as a harmonica player for American singer and actor Harry Belafonte on the title track of Belafonte’s 1961 album ‘Midnight Special.’\n\nHe once visited folk musician and singer Woody Guthrie, who was sick, in a New Jersey hospital. There, he taught how to play the harmonica to Guthrie’s son, Arlo, who later became a musician and songwriter.\n\nIn 1961, he moved to New York. He played his first gig at Cafe Wha? in Greenwich Village.\n\nDylan and Suze Rotolo, an artist, met at a folk festival in New York in 1961 and dated for four years. Rotola inspired some of his protest songs. Their relationship, however, was affected by Dylan’s growing fame.\n\nIn 1962, when Dylan joined Columbia Records, he claimed to be an orphan to avoid a requirement of his parents’ signature. Dylan, who was 20 (at 20, people were considered minor at that time), convinced the music critic and producer John Hammond to sign the document.\n\nJohn Hammond signed Dylan even though a vice president at Columbia Records thought his singing voice was “the most horrible thing he’d ever heard in his life.”\n\nDylan and Johnny Cash, a singer and songwriter, had been friends since 1962. Cash played a crucial role in convincing Columbia Records not to drop Dylan before he could record his second album ‘The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan.’\n\nIn May 1963, Dylan, who was relatively unknown at that time, was scheduled to perform ‘Talkin’ John Birch Paranoid Blues’ on ‘The Ed Sullivan Show.’ He, however, refused to go on the show when a CBS censor told him that he could not play the track on air due to the possibility of a lawsuit.\n\nBob Dylan and Joan Baez, a singer, songwriter, and musician, met at the Monterey Folk Festival in 1963 and soon fell in love. They often performed together at various events. Their relationship, however, ended in 1965.\n\nDylan made his first major appearance on American television with The Steve Allen Show in 1964. When he announced that he was going to play the song “Hattie Caroll,” only one audience member applauded in recognition.\n\nDylan initially loved to pick up hitchhikers and talk to them about Jesus while driving around secretly in an old damaged car with a ski hat covering his famous curls.\n\nIt has been reported that Dylan uses Ouzo, a dry anise-flavoured aperitif (an alcoholic drink used to stimulate the appetite), as a hair relaxer to set his curly hair.\n\nOn 28 August 1964, Bob met the members of the rock band ‘The Beatles’ and asked if they wanted to smoke weed with him, but he later came to know that they were not familiar with it. Dylan had mistakenly assumed that they had smoked marijuana before as he misheard the lyric ‘I can’t hide’ of their song “I Wanna Hold Your Hand” as ‘I get high.’ They, however, all ended up getting stoned together.\n\nHis first wife, Sara Lownds, initially worked as a bunny girl, a waitress at a playboy club.\n\nHe met Sara shortly after the death of her husband in late 1964. They later began dating and got married the next year. He adopted Maria Dylan Himmelman, Sara’s daughter from a previous marriage.\n\nDuring the Newport Folk Festival in 1965, while Dylan played an electric set on the stage, an American singer named Pete Seeger tried to cut the cables with an axe. Dylan later criticised folk singers and called them “a bunch of fat people.”\n\nDylan is good at inventing fake names. In 1965, he gave the name ‘William W. Kasonavarich’ to a reporter in Los Angeles, and in 1988, he provided the name ‘Knezelvitz’ to a reporter in Sydney, Australia.\n\nDespite reaching number 2 on the Billboard charts with songs like ‘Like A Rolling Stone’ and ‘Rainy Day Women #12 & 35’ in 1965 and 1966, Bob has never had a number 1 single. The cover of his song ‘Mr. Tambourine Man’ by The Byrds, however, reached the top spot in 1965.\n\nDylan has often served as a great distraction. When he arrived at Heathrow Airport in 1965, it caused such excitement among reporters that they completely ignored the renowned singer and actor Lena Horne.\n\nIn 1965, Bob Dylan’s concert tour was held in England, UK. The tour was recorded by the American filmmaker D. A. Pennebaker, who later used the footage in his documentary ‘Bob Dylan: Don’t Look Back’ (1967).\n\nDuring his visit to the United Kingdom, he played a prank on Donovan, his supposed British counterpart, by showing up to their meeting wearing Halloween masks with his friends.\n\nIn 1966, he met an accident on his motorcycle that he believed saved his life. He suffered broken vertebrae and a concussion. This experience later made him re-evaluate his priorities and gain a new perspective on life.\n\nDylan explored an abandoned house along with the members of The Spencer Davis Group in England in 1966. The house was rumoured to be haunted by a dog’s ghost. When they heard a dog bark, Dylan was convinced it was the ghost. He was excited, running around like a kid, exclaiming, “This is unbelievable!”\n\nDylan’s father, Abraham Zimmerman, died of a heart attack in Hibbing, Minnesota, at the age of 56 on 29 May 1968.\n\nIn an interview in 1968, Dylan’s mother, Betty Zimmerman, mentioned that she used to put ribbons in his hair when he was a child and jokingly tell him that he should have been a girl.\n\nApart from being a songwriter, Dylan is also a prolific painter. His artwork became publically known when he painted the cover of The Band’s ‘Music from Big Pink’ album in 1968. He has also created artwork for many of his album covers including the cover of his 1970 album ‘Self Portrait.’\n\nDylan was unhappy to find no toilet in his dressing room at the UK’s Isle of Wight Festival in 1969.
