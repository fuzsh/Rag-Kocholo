His unique songwriting style and contributions to American culture have earned him many awards including the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize in Literature. In a 1997 interview, after Dickey appeared on Bob's Jimmie Rodgers tribute album, Dickey talked about his old friend. \"I've known Bob for quite a while, you know. For some reason he likes to hang out with me when we run into each other on the road. He don't let too many people very close to him, you know. I think it's because he likes guitar playin'\". One night does stand out... A few months after the Allman Brothers were inducted into the Rock & Roll HOF in 1995, Dickey received another special invitation: to sit in with Bob Dylan during his concert at the USF Sun Dome in Tampa at the end of September. This was not the first time these legends played together. Dickey played guitar on Dylan's Cats In The Well in Sarasota, FL. in 1992. What stood out was Bob singing a song written by a contemporary. Betts was pleasantly surprised too. Dylan says, \"Let's do Ramblin' Man.\" \"All right, let me write the words down,\" Betts tells him. \"I know the words,\" Dylan says, \"I should have wrote that song.\" Dickey lets out a warm laugh. \"I said, Bob, just sing whatever you want to. I didn't think he knew the words. I figured he'd just make up some stuff,\" Betts recalled. \"He knew the song word for word. Man, it was such an honor. He sang it and I told him later that those words have never had so much feeling. It was really beautiful.\" Dickey sat in for 6 songs that night including Highway 61 Revisited and Rainy Day Women 12 & 35. In 2020, Bob mentioned Dickey in his new song Murder Most Foul. Bob is a real American treasure. He has had a profound impact on popular music, and is one of the most important figures of the 20th century. Here's an iconic photo of Bob and Dickey at the grand opening of the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame. Cleveland, OH. September 1995. ðŸ“·: Sidney Smith. #bobdylan #RIPdickeybetts #allmanbrothers #songwriters #americanicons #rrhof #theroadgoesonforever @bobdylan\".",
