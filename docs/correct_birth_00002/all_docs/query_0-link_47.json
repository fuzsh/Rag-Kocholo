        "text": "Greg Tiburzi performed the songs of Bob Dylan on the porch of the legendary singer-songwriter’s childhood home in Duluth on Friday afternoon to celebrate Dylan’s 83rd birthday. Fitting with the stormy weather that accompanied the event, Tiburzi performed songs like “Blowin’ in the Wind” and “A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall” to a crowd of dozens who filled the sidewalk around the home.\n\nOne person in attendance said they had traveled from Ireland for the event.\n\nThe event was organized by Duluth Dylan Fest who continue to work to celebrate the work of the now 83-year-old Dylan who was born in Duluth back in 1941."
