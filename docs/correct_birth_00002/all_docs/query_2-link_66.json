        "text": "Sir Paul McCartney affectionately mocked Bruce Springsteen, as he presented him with a prestigious prize at the Ivor Novello Awards. Springsteen was in London, England to receive the ceremony's highest honour - a fellowship of the songwriting academy. He was the first international star to receive the award, and Sir Paul said he \"couldn't think of a more fitting recipient... except maybe Bob Dylan. Or Paul Simon, or Billy Joel, or Beyoncé, or Taylor Swift\" he added. \"The list goes on.\" \"He's known as the American working man,\" Sir Paul continued, \"but he admits he’s never worked a day in his life.\"\n\nCanadian musician, songwriter, film composer, producer, actor, Robbie Robertson died at the age of 80, after a year-long battle with prostate cancer. He joined The Hawks in 1962 who became known as The Band. Bob Dylan and the Hawks toured the United States throughout 1965 and a world tour the following year.
