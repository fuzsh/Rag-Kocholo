        "text": "Bob Dylan’s childhood home is a drive-by visit only, unless you see a small sign on the front lawn with a number to call. That means the owner will walk over and let you in, and give you a tour. Either way, the street sign at the edge of the property, Bob Dylan Drive, makes a great photo op. The Zimmerman family moved to Hibbing from Duluth when young Bobby was 6. After a brief stay with relatives, they moved into the Seventh Avenue house where Bob lived until leaving home. The Zimmerman’s former home is located on the corner of 7th Ave East (renamed Bob Dylan Drive) and 25th Street in Hibbing. Check out Dylan ephemera, including items from the home, at the Hibbing Public Library, 2020 East 5th Ave. Call 608-217-5232 for a tour."
