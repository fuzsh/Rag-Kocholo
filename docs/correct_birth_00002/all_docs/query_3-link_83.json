        "text": "PBS Western Reserve (WNEO 45.1 / WEAO 49.1):\n\nFridays, July 12 & 19, at 9 PM\n\nSaturdays, July 13 & 20, at 2 AM\n\nSundays, July 14 & 21, at 3 PM\n\nExplore musician Bob Dylan's evolution from folk troubadour to iconic rock star. Live concert footage and press conferences from the 1960s and a new interview with Dylan are used to draw a portrait of the legendary singer-songwriter.\n\nThe two-part film, which focuses on the singer-songwriter’s life and music from 1961 to 1966, includes never-seen performance footage and interviews with artists and musicians whose lives intertwined with Dylan’s during that time. Dylan talks openly and extensively about this critical period in his career, detailing the journey from his hometown of Hibbing, Minnesota, to Greenwich Village, New York, where he became the center of a musical and cultural upheaval, the effects of which are still felt today.\n\nFor the first time, The Bob Dylan Archives made available rare treasures from its film, tape and stills collection, including footage from Murray Lerner’s film “Festival” documenting performances at the 1963, 1964 and 1965 Newport Folk Festivals, previously unreleased outtakes from D.A. Pennebaker’s famed 1967 documentary “Don’t Look Back,” and interviews with Allen Ginsberg, Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, Maria Muldaur and many others. In anticipation of the film, members of Dylan’s worldwide community of fans also contributed rarities from their own collections. Directed by Martin Scorsese."
