        "text": "Bob Dylan's native county will honor him with an entire year's worth of 80th birthday celebrations.\n\nBorn in Duluth and raised in Hibbing, Minn., the musician, writer and Nobel laureate hits the milestone birthday May 24, and St. Louis County is expected to proclaim that day until his next birthday \"The Year of Dylan.\"\n\nA Dylan celebration \"needed to be big,\" said Zane Bail, a member of Duluth Dylan Fest, a grassroots fan group. \"Given the cultural icon he is in the U.S. and around the world, he deserved more than a day.\"\n\nThe proclamation, which organizers say will be read in front of his childhood homes in Duluth and Hibbing, lauds the \"cultural giant\" for his 60-year musical career and points to his many connections to northeastern Minnesota.\n\nDuluth Dylan Fest teamed up with the Hibbing Dylan Project, Visit Duluth, the Hibbing Area Chamber of Commerce, Iron Range Tourism and the Minnesota Discovery Center to organize events. The first is the groundbreaking of a Dylan monument at Hibbing High School on May 22, followed by a Greg Tiburzi performance of Dylan music at Dylan's former Hibbing home after the proclamation is read.\n\nHibbing Dylan Project member Molly Johnsrud admires Dylan most for his 2016 Nobel Prize in literature.\n\nIt shows how important education was to the \"genius songwriter,\" she said.\n\nThe annual Duluth Dylan Fest runs from May 22-30, back after a pandemic hiatus. Other events include a Dylan-themed Mesabi Trails bike tour in July, a concert and exhibit at the Minnesota Discovery Center in August and a show celebrating Dylan and Buddy Holly in January.\n\nJana Hollingsworth â€¢ 218-508-2450"
