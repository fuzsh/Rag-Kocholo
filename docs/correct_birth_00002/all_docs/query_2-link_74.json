        "text": "WKCR is excited to announce a 24-hour birthday celebration for Bob Dylan, broadcast on FM and HD radio and online all day on Friday, May 24th. The special broadcast will run from Middle Eastern Influences until one hour into The Mambo Machine. The broadcast will preempt all regularly scheduled Friday shows.\n\nBob Dylan, born in Duluth, Minnesota, on May 24th, 1941, is an American singer and songwriter whose influence continues to be felt worldwide. Throughout his storied sixty-year career, which began with his 1962 self-titled debut album, Dylan has inspired countless artists and listeners with his songs, which tackle subjects ranging from civil rights to social justice, war, love, and loss. Frequently cited as one of the greatest songwriters of all time, Dylan has won multiple Grammy Awards, and an Academy Award, been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and was awarded the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature for “having created new poetic expressions within the great American song traditions.” Although Dylan began his career as a folk artist and bastion of the burgeoning counterculture movement, he has dabbled in rock, country, gospel, and has even released albums of rerecorded American standards. Bob Dylan’s contributions to American music and culture make him a uniquely large figure in the music world, and his music is timeless even on the eve of his 83rd birthday."
