        "text": "Hibbing, Minnesota, is home to famous songwriter and musician Bob Dylan. The world-known artist was born on May 24, 1941, and named Robert Allen Zimmerman. The Zimmerman family moved to Hibbing in 1948, and for most of Bob’s life in Hibbing, he resided at 2425 7th Avenue East, a street renamed named “Dylan Drive”.\n\nAlthough the house is not open for tours, fans can connect with the Dylan mystique by driving past the great musician’s childhood home.\n\nDylan graduated from the historic Hibbing High School in 1959. A copy of the ‘59 yearbook with his high school photograph is located at the Hibbing Public Library, along with a collection relating to Dylan’s life and accomplishments. Tours are available of the historic Hibbing High School where Dylan once performed in the fabulous auditorium. The actual piano that Dylan played in school is still used today.\n\nThe Atrium / Zimmy’s Restaurant located in downtown Hibbing features more Dylan memorabilia., and every May, people from all over the world travel to the City of Hibbing to celebrate “Dylan Days”. The event typically includes a Mystery Bus Tour, Open Mic Night, Live Poetry & Short Story Contest about Bob Dylan, a Bob Dylan Birthday Bash and more! For a complete list of ongoing events and to learn more about Dylan Days contact the Hibbing Area Chamber of Commerce at 800-4-HIBBING or visit online at http://www.hibbing.org/dylan1/."
