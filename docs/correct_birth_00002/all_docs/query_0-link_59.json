        "text": "Bob Dylan, who was born Robert Zimmerman in Duluth, Minnesota in 1941, is an American singer-songwriter, author, and artist. He legally changed his name to Robert Dylan in 1962. In 2016 Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the first musician to ever receive that award.\n\nDylan first came on the scene in the 1960s, gaining fame with so-called protest songs. After performing in New York’s Greenwich Village, he was signed by Columbia Records. Dylan continues to record and perform and is considered by many to be one of the most influential musicians of all time. It is estimated that he has sold over 120 million albums worldwide.\n\nIn addition to music, Dylan has published several books of poetry, prose, and artwork. Dylan has also received numerous awards in addition to the Nobel Prize, including the Presidential Medal of Honor. Time magazine included him in its list of most influential people of the 20th century."
