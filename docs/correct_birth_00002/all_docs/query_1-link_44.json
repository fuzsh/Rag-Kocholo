        "text": "Duluth’s an iron ore shipping town in Minnesota\n\nIt’s built up on a rocky cliff that runs into Lake Superior\n\nI was born there — my father was born there –\n\nMy mother’s from the Iron Range Country up north\n\nThe Iron Range is a long line a mining towns\n\nthat begin at Grand Rapids and end at Eveleth\n\nWe moved up there to live with my mother’s folks\n\nin Hibbing when I was young –\n\nHibbing’s got the biggest open pit ore mine in the world\n\nHibbing’s got schools, churches, grocery stores an’ a jail\n\nIt’s got high school football games an’ a movie house\n\nHibbing’s got souped-up cars runnin’ full blast\n\non a Friday night\n\nHibbing’s got corner bars with polka bands\n\nYou can stand at one end of Hibbing’s main drag\n\nan’ see clear past the city limits on the other end\n\nHibbing’s a good ol’ town\n\nI ran away from it when I was 10, 12, 13, 15, 151/2, 17 an’ 18\n\nI been caught an’ brought back all but once\n\nDYLAN: I had some amazing projections when I was a kid, but not since then. And those visions have been strong enough to keep me going through today.\n\nPLAYBOY: What were those visions like?\n\nDYLAN: They were a feeling of wonder. I projected myself toward what I might personally, humanly do in terms of creating any kinds of reality. I was born in, grew up in a place so foreign that you had to be there to picture it.\n\nPLAYBOY: Are you talking about Hibbing, Minnesota?\n\nDYLAN: It was all in upper Minnesota.\n\nPLAYBOY: What was the quality of those visionary experiences?\n\nDYLAN: Well, in the winter, everything was still, nothing moved. Eight months of that. You can put it together. You can have some amazing hallucinogenic experiences doing nothing but looking out your window. There is also the summer, when it gets hot and sticky and the air is very metallic. There is a lot of Indian spirit. The earth there is unusual, filled with ore. So there is something happening that is hard to define. There is a magnetic attraction there. Maybe thousands and thousands of years ago, some planet bumped into the land there. There is a great spiritual quality throughout the Midwest. Very subtle, very strong, and that is where I grew up. New York was a dream.\n\nPLAYBOY: Why did you leave Minnesota?\n\nDYLAN: Well, there comes a time for all things to pass."
