        "text": "About\n\nLegendary singer-songwriter who revolutionized folk music in the 1960's with albums such as The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, Highway 61 Revisited, and Blonde on Blonde and songs such as \"The Times They Are a-Changin',\" \"Like a Rolling Stone,\" and \"Positively 4th Street.\"\n\nBefore Fame\n\nBorn Robert Zimmerman, he changed his name to Dylan after the poet Dylan Thomas. He was born into a Jewish family, but later converted to Christianity. While studying at the University of Minnesota, he became more enthused with folk music than rock and roll.\n\nTrivia\n\nHis 1975 protest song \"Hurricane,\" telling the story of the wrongfully imprisoned African-American boxer Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter, is one of the most well known examples of activism through music. He won a Nobel Prize for Literature in 2016.\n\nFamily Life\n\nHis real name is Robert Allen Zimmerman. He married Sara Dylan on November 22, 1965; after their divorce on June 29, 1977, he married Carolyn Dennis on June 4, 1986. He has three daughters and three sons. One of his sons, Jakob, also became a singer and guitar player. One of his daughters is Desiree Gabrielle Dennis Dylan. His grandson Levi Dylan is a model.\n\nAssociated With"
