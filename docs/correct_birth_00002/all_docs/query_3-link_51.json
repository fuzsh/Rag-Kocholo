        "text": "DULUTH — Until Friday, I hadn't given much thought to the fact that both of Minnesota's greatest rock stars are indelibly associated with rain.\n\nThis year marks the 40th anniversary of Prince's towering classic, \"Purple Rain.\" The late legend solidified his power in precipitation during the 2007 Super Bowl halftime show, often cited as the greatest ever.\n\nBob Dylan, partial to Biblical imagery, has cited rain and floods numerous times. His best-known song in that vein is \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall,\" but there are also \"Rainy Day Women #12 and 35\" and \"Buckets of Rain.\" Rain is mentioned in Dylan classics \"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues,\" \"Make You Feel My Love\" and \"Desolation Row.\" For good measure, Dylan has even covered Gordon Lightfoot's \"Early Morning Rain.\"\n\nGiven all that, and the fact that Duluth's weather is famously unpredictable, no one seemed particularly surprised that Dylan's 83rd birthday party on Friday was nearly rained out.\n\n\"The weather's like this every year,\" said Barry Tusin, standing on the boulevard at 519 N. Third Ave. E. just before the noontime event began. Tusin had his phone out, displaying an image of his cousin and a friend posing with a young Bobby Zimmerman in Hibbing circa 1945.\n\nAbe and Beatty Zimmerman moved to Hibbing when Bobby was just 6 years old, so Dylan's Duluth connection can seem tenuous. In fact, a 1986 effort to rename Harbor Drive in Dylan's honor was thwarted by Duluthians who argued that the city should \"take no credit whatsoever\" (as the News Tribune editorialized at the time) for a mere \"accident of birth.\"\n\nFor the few dozen people who braved the chill winds on Friday, though, it was truly meaningful to sing \"Happy Birthday\" to the only rock 'n' roll Nobel laureate while standing outside the first place he ever called home. Sitting on the porch with an acoustic guitar, Greg Tiburzi led the group in that song and performed several more Dylan compositions.\n\nAmong those who joined the gathering were Bill Pagel, the collector who owns both the Duluth house and the Zimmermans' later home in Hibbing, and representatives of the Duluth Armory Arts and Music Center. The birthday party was presented, per usual, as part of the annual Duluth Dylan Fest.\n\n\"It takes a village to put this together,\" said festival representative Zane Bail, addressing the crowd Friday, \"and we're a pretty small village.\"\n\nDuluth Mayor Roger Reinert, stepping onto the porch, mentioned his service on the Armory board and described the birthday party as \"another opportunity to celebrate, not just our history and the legacy that folks like Bob have helped contribute to our community, but also where we're at and where we're going.\"\n\n2024 marks a particularly poignant moment of continuity amid change for Dylan fans in Duluth. The day before Bob's birthday, I attended a grand opening event for Zenith DCHS, the apartment building converted from the city's Historic Old Central High School.\n\nHaving never set foot inside the building, I was curious to walk the halls where countless notable Duluthians — not least the voice of Garfield — were educated. In a room containing shelves of vintage yearbooks, I grabbed a volume from 1929 and found a photo of Abe Zimmerman, Dylan's dad.\n\nWhile Abe (1911-68) might be surprised to find a pickleball court in his old high school auditorium, he would presumably be pleased to see that the school still stands. Before long, that will likely no longer be true of the building where Beatty gave birth to Bobby.\n\nWith the new Essentia Health-St. Mary's Medical Center now complete, Essentia plans to tear down the hospital it replaces. An exact timetable for the tear-down hasn't yet been determined, Essentia media relations specialist Tony Matt told the News Tribune.\n\nMatt also said that existing records don't indicate where exactly in the building babies would have been born in 1941. So while it's impossible to pinpoint precisely where little Bobby drew his first breath, fans likely have only a matter of months to grab a glance of the building where Dylan was born, 407 E. Third St.\n\nDylan's first home, the hospital where he was born, and the building where his dad attended high school are all within easy walking distance of each other on Duluth's hillside. Dylan himself demonstrated that he appreciated the neighborhood's significance when he played at Bayfront Festival Park in 1999.\n\n\"I was born on the hill over there,\" said Dylan. \"Glad to see it's still there.\"\n\nWhile most of Friday's attendees were local, at least a couple made long pilgrimages to be here. Martin McCauley, a man originally from Ireland and currently residing in the Netherlands, said that coming to Dylan's original home city was the fulfillment of a 50-year dream.\n\nThe crowd — many aware of the distance McCauley had come — fell into a hush when McCauley took a turn at the microphone, passionately performing Dylan's \"To Ramona\" despite the day's numbing cold and a struggle to catch his breath after climbing the hill.\n\n\"I'm glad I did it,\" said McCauley, who said his breathing challenges were associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. \"I was going to say, 'No, you're going to f--k it up! Don't do it!'\"\n\nAlthough Stacy Stephens didn't travel as far to the event, in some respects he took an even bigger leap of fan faith. Stephens said he moved from Los Angeles to Duluth on May 1, having never even been to our city before.\n\nThe draw: Stephens is Pagel's newest renter in the first-floor unit at the Dylan duplex. (The Zimmermans lived upstairs.) A retiree and Dylan fan, Stephens connected with Pagel on Facebook and prevailed in the competitive selection process to live under the Zimmermans' former roof.\n\n\"I love it,\" said Stephens about living in Duluth. \"I enjoy the cold weather. The house is incredible.\"\n\nStephens was wearing a souvenir T-shirt from Dylan's spring 2024 tour. That's right, the octogenarian is still touring. Stephens caught Dylan twice in Austin, Texas.\n\n\"For me,\" said Stephens, \"every (Dylan concert) I see is the best one. So those are both of the best I've seen.\"\n\nAs Stephens spoke, Tiburzi was playing \"Blowin' in the Wind.\" He followed that with \"Happy Birthday,\" wishing Dylan \"many, many more.\"\n\nThat sentiment may not have quite made it to Dylan's ears, wherever they were that afternoon. Still, it was easy to imagine the artist sparing a thought for that little Duluth house — and being glad to know it's still there."
