The collection contains English and German language material and provides both American and European commentary on the life and music of Bob Dylan.\n\nMNHS call number: Digital Finding Aid\n\nBob Dylan is an American musical icon of folk and rock music and the voice of his generation. He moved from folk to rock (folk/rock) infusing his lyrics with poetry and setting the standard for lyric writing. His first major composition “Blowin’ in the Wind” (considered by many as the greatest protest song of his era) and “the times they are a changing” became anthems of the anti-war and civil rights movements. He has been referred to as the “Shakespeare” of his era and the “greatest poet” of the second half of the 20th century.\n\nBorn in Duluth, May 24,1941, he grew up in in Hibbing where he was known as Bob Zimmerman. He briefly attended the University of Minnesota becoming fascinated with the folk singer Woody Guthrie. He began performing in coffee houses near the University campus and changed his last name to Dylan. In 1961, he moved to New York City and built a cult following as a folk singer playing in Greenwich Village. Over the years he has performed throughout the world, sold millions of albums and written over 500 songs.\n\nDylan has received national and international recognition and many awards. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1982. Other awards include a lifetime achievement award from the Recording Academy in 1992, Kennedy Center Honors in 1997, a Grammy in 1998 (Time out of Mind), an Academy Award 2000 (Things have changed), Presidential Medal of Freedom 2012 and the Nobel Prize for Literature 2016 (\"for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition”)."
