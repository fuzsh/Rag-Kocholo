An amazing display of the southern lights, or aurora australis as it is known as in the southern hemisphere, was visibly on Saturday morning in Southern Africa.

We've also posted a number of photos from outside of Africa, mostly sent in by South African expats.

According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), who issued a solar storm warning for the category G5 event, this is the strongest geomagnetic storm to hit earth in twenty years.

The event is likely to continue once it gets dark on Saturday evening, although it will be less strong than on Friday.

More photos will be posted here so check back regularly.

All photos are carefully examined to ensure that they seem authentic. The main photo of Table Moutain, which some people are convinced is fake, has been verified in detail and we are certain that it and the other six photos and one video that were taken by the same person are genuine (details will be posted on our social media shortly).

Please be sure to send photos and videos to us via whatsapp and also tell us where and when they were taken.

See below for a link to our whatsapp channel but since the link does not work in the instagram app you will need to send us a whatsapp message and we'll send you a link.
