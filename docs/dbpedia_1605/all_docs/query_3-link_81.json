        "text": "Last time out, the Twos fell to the Tacoma Defiance in a tough 5-1 road loss. MLS NEXT All Star Darius Randell bagged the Loonsâ lone goal of the evening in the 69th minute, with an assist from fellow academy player Will Schmidt. Despite the lopsided scoreline, the Loons continued to gain valuable experience for some of their younger members, and theyâll be ready to prove that theyâve learned a few lessons in this weekâs match. The Town FC is coming to the Twin Cities for MNUFC2âs next MLS NEXT Pro matchup, and itâs set to be a special affair, as the Twos will be taking to the pitch at Allianz Field for the first time this season. The Town have captured 11 of their last 15 possible points, picking up three wins, a shootout victory, and just one loss at the hands of Timbers 2. The opposition is in fine form, but the Allianz Field aura might be the secret sauce the Twos need to find another gear and pull off the upset. Come see if they can reverse their fortunes under the big lights and start a winning streak; get your tickets today at SeatGeek.com. Can't make it to out to Allianz Field? No problem; you can stream the game for FREE on MLSNEXTPro.com.\n\nAutograph Alley\n\nMNUFC2 players will be signing autographs on their way back to the locker room after the match. Fans that want to score some signatures should make their way to the bottom of section 28 at the end of the game, where they will be guided down to the autograph area by event staff. Fans of all ages are invited to participate.\n\nPostgame PKs\n\nOnce the players have cleared the field after Autograph Alley, fans between the ages of 3 and 15 will have the chance to take a PK on the very same turf that the team plays on. After signing a waiver, participants gathered at the bottom of section 36 of the seating bowl will be guided down to the field by event staff."
