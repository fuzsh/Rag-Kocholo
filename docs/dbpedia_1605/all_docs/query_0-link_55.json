        "text": "11 May 2024\n\nBy Staff Writer\n\nAn amazing display of the southern lights, or aurora australis as it is known as in the southern hemisphere, was visibly on Saturday morning in Southern Africa.\n\nWe've also posted a number of photos from outside of Africa, mostly sent in by South African expats.\n\nAccording to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), who issued a solar storm warning for the category G5 event, this is the strongest geomagnetic storm to hit earth in twenty years.\n\nThe event is likely to continue once it gets dark on Saturday evening, although it will be less strong than on Friday.\n\nMore photos will be posted here so check back regularly.\n\nAll photos are carefully examined to ensure that they seem authentic. The main photo of Table Moutain, which some people are convinced is fake, has been verified in detail and we are certain that it and the other six photos and one video that were taken by the same person are genuine (details will be posted on our social media shortly).\n\nPlease be sure to send photos and videos to us via whatsapp and also tell us where and when they were taken.\n\nSee below for a link to our whatsapp channel but since the link does not work in the instagram app you will need to send us a whatsapp message and we'll send you a link.\n\nFollow our channels\n\nStandard users are welcome to use the standard sharing buttons on this page to share our content.
