        "text": "Synopsis\n\nNorthern lights also known as aurora borealis are caused due to activity on the sun surface. These beautiful lights are seen in the northern and southern hemisphere.\n\nBoth the northern and southern hemispheres' poles are good places to watch the aurora. The phenomenon is referred to as the aurora australis in the south and the aurora borealis in the north. People have been captivated, terrified, and inspired by these 'northern' and 'southern lights' for millennia. More recently, photographers have gone to extraordinary lengths to try and capture the magnificence of these atmospheric phenomena. In reality, activity on the Sun's surface is what causes the lights we see in the night sky.\n\nHuge clouds of electrically charged particles are released from solar storms on the surface of our star. These particles can travel for millions of miles, and some may eventually impact the Earth. Astronomer Tom Kerss of the Royal Observatory explains that when these particles collide with atoms and molecules in the atmosphere, they effectively heat them up. We refer to this physical process as 'excitation', yet it is quite similar to heating a gas and making it light.\n\nTherefore, what we see is the result of solar particle collisions with atoms and molecules in our atmosphere. The Earth's magnetic field's lines of force are what give the aurora its distinctive wavy patterns and 'curtains' of light.\n\nThe two main gases in the Earth's atmosphere are nitrogen and oxygen, and these substances emit various hues when an aurora show occurs.\n\nAurorae are likely to exist on any planet with an atmosphere and magnetic field. On Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, aurorae have been photographed by scientists in breathtaking detail. The Sun's activity varies, with peaks occurring every 11 years. The cycle is nearing its minimum right now, and the last peak in solar activity occurred in 2014. By the middle of the 2020s, solar activity is anticipated to go up once more.\n\nObservers in high latitudes should keep an eye out for aurorae at all times, regardless of the Sun's activity.\n\nFAQ:\n\nFor how much duration can northern lights be seen in the sky?\n\nA good display may last for no longer than 15-30 minutes at a time, although if you're really lucky, it could extend to a couple of hours or longer. To see the Northern lights, the sky needs to be dark and clear of any clouds. Some people claim the aurora comes out when temperatures are colder.\n\nWhat is the biggest myth northern people still fear about aurora borealis?\n\nThe biggest faux pas you can commit while viewing the Northern Lights is to wave, sing or whistle at them. Alerted to your presence, the spirits of the lights will come down and take you away.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by an external agency.
