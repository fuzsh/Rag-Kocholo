        "text": "“I messaged my mum and said ‘I feel like I’m gonna cry’, it was so amazing to see.”\n\nThe 29-year-old has typically headed to her secret hunting ground near the lake twice or three times a year for the last decade. She uses an Aurora-tracking website to give her hints of what to expect.\n\nCapturing the southern lights is the result of a culmination of good intel, an understanding of weather and sometimes, according to Crowther, a good gut instinct.\n\nWhile location-spotting ahead of her next attempt, Crowther had been visiting Lake Ellesmere and discovered a rusted, burned ute abandoned on the side of the road.\n\n“I’d never seen it there before, I thought it would make the perfect foreground.”\n\nThe media had reported a solar flare would be hitting New Zealand a month ago but nothing came to fruition. However, Crowther’s observations of data on Sunday revealed signs of hope.\n\n“It showed a new moon coming down and it was a clear night, it looked really promising,” she said.\n\n“I decided to leave home just before 6pm and hoped to get there just before the sun went down, I was getting notifications and everything met up. In my mind, I thought this would be perfect.”\n\nHer mind proved her right.\n\nArriving at her shooting spot, Crowther watched the sunset and saw a small haze of pink, further cementing her belief her run of bad luck would finally be broken.\n\nThe sun disappeared from view, twilight arrived and for the following two hours, the photographer witnessed “weird fog curtains” and small verticle beams of pink light - constantly changing in front of her.\n\nCrowther pointed her Canon60 and 40mm lens towards the ute and started clicking.\n\n“I haven’t been out photographing for a while as I’ve had lots of things going on, so it’s about charging batteries for me,” she said.\n\n“The first time I saw it was when I was 18 years old, now everyone is out taking photos of it. People were on the hill trying to capture it - but not knowing what direction to look.”\n\nChristchurch can prove a tricky city to capture the lights from, particularly during autumn as grey cloud becomes a prevalent mask for the lights to hide behind.\n\nBut it’s a night that will last long in the memory of the accomplished photographer whose hobby produced a wonderful moment of achievement.\n\n“It’s just a matter of timing and when you come out, you go ‘yes, all perfect’.”\n\nWhile Crowther was winning in Christchurch, members of the Aurora Australis (NZ) Facebook page were showing off their cunning captures as the evening sky turned a purple and pink hue.\n\nThe lights were spotted all over the country - from the Bay of Plenty, Hawke’s Bay and Wellington, to the south in Cromwell, Twizel, and Queenstown.\n\nJonathan Usher captured the light display in Wellington and said the Aurora Australis was “strongly visible.\n\n“The beams of light were clearly visible to the naked eye, though the camera was also able to capture the colour of the aurora,” Usher said.\n\nHauraki Gulf weather reported a significant G4 level geomagnetic storm had been under way.\n\nAs explained by astronomer and Otago Museum director Dr Ian Griffin last month during another stunning display, solar storms are caused by magnetically driven explosions on the sun that fire material at high speed away from the sun.\n\n“That sounds terribly complicated, but what it is is basically the sun fires material occasionally towards Earth,” he told the Otago Daily Times.\n\n“And we’ve had two of those ejections in the last two days.”\n\nBoth were travelling between the sun and the Earth at about 800km per second.\n\nWhen that material hits the Earth’s magnetic field it starts to spiral around it, he said.\n\nWhen energetically charged particles travelling along the Earth’s magnetic field lines strike the upper atmosphere, the Southern (and Northern) Lights can be observed around the magnetic poles.\n\nThese powerful electrons produce light when they strike atmospheric gases.\n\nThe phenomenon is known as the Aurora Borealis in the Northern Hemisphere and as Aurora Australis down under."
