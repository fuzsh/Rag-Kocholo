        "text": ":: Astral Light\n\nThe Elite Collection > Astral Light\n\nLocation:\n\nMornington Peninsula, Victoria - Australia\n\nPrint Code:\n\nMG00345-AL\n\nEdition Size:\n\nOnly 5 Prints + 1 Artist Proof, World-Wide - SOLD OUT (Email our gallery consultants to enquire about existing copies)\n\nFraming:\n\nThe print is expertly face-mounted onto 4.5mm museum-grade Acrylic for the best possible presentation and extreme protection from damaging UV light. It is then backed onto acid-free Aluminium and surrounded by a thick beveled board wrapped with black fabric. To finish it off, we frame the print with our hand-finished Elite Dark Ash frame, imported from Italy. (as pictured above)\n\nDetails:\n\nBelieve it or not, on rare occasions when the conditions allow, the Southern Lights or Aurora Australis can be viewed from as far north as the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria!\n\nI initially began researching this phenomenon back in 2010 however only witnessed my first Aurora on the Mornington Peninsula in early 2012. I captured a few average shots but the aurora was quite faint and I wasn't entirely happy with them. From that moment I was hooked, spending countless cold nights out in the wild attempting to capture this amazing spectacle.\n\nIn early 2013, it was a Wednesday night and I was packing my suitcase ready for an early morning flight to Alice Springs to run a workshop when I did a random check of the space weather. According to the charts - the Aurora was in full force! I dropped everything and raced out the door to one of my preferred viewing locations.\n\nI knew the moon was going to rise soon so I only had an hour of shooting time. I found my way down to this still rock pool and setup my gear. It was near impossible composing the shot in complete darkness! I fine tuned my composition with each shot until it was perfect then captured a number of long exposures settling on this one as my favourite. The red and green colours in the sky were amazing, there was no mistaking this was the best Aurora I had ever witnessed, and from the Mornington Peninsula!\n\nAs the moon rose the colours disappeared so I headed home for a few hours sleep before heading to the airport.\n\nPrint Information\n\nMark Gray's fine art limited edition photographs are individually produced on archival quality Metallic Pearl paper.
