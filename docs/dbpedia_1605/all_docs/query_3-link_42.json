        "text": "MOST of our readers saw last week, for three\n\nnights, commencing after sunset, and light-\n\ning up the heavens with a gorgeous hue of\n\nred, the Southern Aurora. At Sydney they\n\nonly appear to have had a tithe of the beauty,\n\nas the Aurora did not shine so long or so\n\nbrightly as in Queensland. Friday night\n\nwas the grandest in appearance here, the\n\nAurora being visible from seven o'clock in\n\nthe evening until after midnight. At times\n\nthere was an appearance of rays down the\n\nwhole range of light, which seemed many\n\nmiles in extent, and a number of stars were\n\ndistinctly visible, contrasting their pale efful-\n\ngence with the red hue of the Aurora. The\n\nsight was the general object of remark on\n\nFriday night by reason of its brilliancy and\n\nthe length of time it appeared. As all our\n\nreaders most probably saw the Aurora as\n\nwell as ourselves, and as some of those who\n\ndid see it testified to a similar appearance in\n\nthe Southern Islands, we shall take the evi-\n\ndence of Mr. Scott, of the Sydney Observa-\n\ntory, who, writing on the 29th ult., last Mon-\n\nday week, to the Herald, says:—\n\n\"I have just been watching, with considerable\n\ninterest, the first specimen that I have ever wit-\n\nnessed of the Southern Aurora. I was in the act\n\nof observing a transit of our Pole Star when I\n\nwas struck with the redness of the southern sky.\n\nAttributing it to some distant fire, I continued\n\nthe observation, and on looking out immediately\n\nafterwards I was surprised to find a considerable\n\nportion of the southern sky in a glow of red\n\nlight, similar to that which sometimes precedes\n\nthe rising of the sun. This red light formed a\n\ntolerably regular arch from E.S.E. to W.S.W., ex-\n\ntending in depth from the South Pole to within a\n\nfew degrees of the horizon. There was a partial\n\nbreak to the S.S.W., and in some places there\n\nwere radiating streams of light brighter and of a\n\nlighter red than the rest. I was immediately re-\n\nminded that Mr. Cracknell had, this morning,\n\ncalled my attention to some singular irregularities\n\nin the workings of the Electric Telegraph. I\n\nhad been unable to point out any peculiarity in\n\nthe state of the atmosphere which could account\n\nfor such effects, but there can be little doubt that\n\nthey were connected with the same magnetic dis-\n\nturbances as produced the Aurora. During the\n\nlast two days, we have had strong winds varying\n\nfrom N. to W., accompanied by a somewhat\n\ngreater amount of evaporation than usual, and\n\nfollowed to-day by moderate S. wind. The\n\namount of ozone indicated by the test papers has\n\nbeen small, as is generally the case with a land\n\nwind. Hoping to detect some sensible electrical\n\ndisturbance, I carried a gold-leaf electroscope to\n\nthe top of the tower, but could perceive no signs\n\nof activity; this, however, cannot be considered a\n\nfair test, as there is so great an extent of metallic\n\nsurface on the tower, connected by a lightning-\n\nconductor with the ground. The Aurora was\n\nfirst noticed by me at twenty minutes after seven\n\no'clock, and continued visible for about half an\n\nhour, when it gradually faded away, and the sky,\n\nwhich had been clear to a great extent, became\n\nrapidly covered with clouds. On directing the\n\ntransit telescope to the most brilliant portion of\n\nthe Aurora, I noticed that stars of the eighth\n\nmagnitude were as distinctly visible as if there\n\nhad been no such phenomenon occurring.\"\n\nThe difference in the appearance of the Au-\n\nrora in Queensland to that spoken of by Mr.\n\nScott is, we had three nights of beauty,\n\nbrought to a finale early on Saturday morn-\n\ning, after the greater space of red light and\n\nrays and visible stars through the Aurora,\n\nlasting with slight variations for eight hours.\n\nIn Brisbane, on Friday, the air was hot, and\n\nthere was an unpleasant feeling from the\n\ncloseness of the atmosphere. On Saturday,\n\nabout noon, the clouds gathered in black-\n\nness, the rain fell, and for about two hours\n\nafterwards a thunder-storm raged, in which\n\nthe lightning was very vivid. For two days\n\nafter the storm it was noticed that the air\n\nhad become colder than ordinarily for the\n\ntime of year.\n\nThe Herald has the following:—\n\n\"It is only of late years that the laws of elec-\n\ntricity and magnetism have been studied, that\n\nanything like a rational exposition of the phe-\n\nnomena of the Aurora has been afforded. That\n\nit was connected with the magnetic peculiarities\n\nof the earth was indicated by the fact that its\n\nfirst appearance in the sky was generally in the\n\nform of an arch, and that the crown of the arch\n\nwas in the line of the magnetic meridian of the\n\nobserver. This, however, is not always the case,\n\nand Captain Sabine mentions instances where he\n\nhas observed it to be otherwise. Among\n\nthe most patient observers of the phe-\n\nnomena of the Aurora was the late\n\nprince of French astronomers, M. Arago. He\n\nset himself particularly to mark the occurrence of\n\nAuroras, and the contemporaneous agitation of\n\nthe magnetic needle. The needle is not always\n\ndisturbed in the presence of Aurora, but it sympa-\n\nthises with it at spots far removed from the scene\n\nof its visibility. The Aurora, though only\n\nvisible at certain places, is not a merely local\n\nphenomenon like a shower of rain, but is con-\n\nnected with a movement of the entire magnetic\n\ncondition of the earth. It would be premature\n\nin the present state of science, to assert that\n\nevery Aurora would make its existence known in\n\nevery part of the world by its effect on the\n\nmagnetic needle, but there can be no doubt that\n\nit does in this way telegraph itself far and wide.\n\nThe manifestation of Aurora in Australia has\n\nbeen observed to synchronise with movements of\n\nthe needle in Paris, and it has been supposed that\n\nthe connection is not accidental. For ten years\n\nM. Arago patiently watched with a microscope\n\nthe movements of the magnetic needle in its ob-\n\nservatory at Paris, till the accumulated result\n\nconvinced him that in respect of declination, in-\n\nclination, and force, the needle moved contem-\n\nporaneously with Aurora. When he noticed the ac-\n\ncustomed agitation of the needle, he would venture\n\nto predict that there was an Aurora somewhere.\n\n\"Long experience,\" he says, \"taught me that\n\ngreat oscillations at hours when the needle is\n\nalmost always stationary are a nearly certain in-\n\ndication of the existence of an aurora.\" He often\n\nhad to wait a long while before he heard of any\n\nverification of his predictions, and sometimes he\n\nnever got any at all. He could not prove that\n\nthere had been aurora when nobody could be found\n\nthat had seen it. Still it was permitted to sup-\n\npose that it had existed, though without being\n\nnoticed, inasmuch as the great majority of obser-\n\nvations showed that the light in the heavens\n\nand the tell-tale needle on the earth spoke toge-\n\nther. The coincidence of aurora and magnetic\n\ndisturbances does not reveal which of the two is\n\nthe cause of the other. The facts as ob-\n\nserved being admitted, we are still in the\n\ndark as to whether the aurora gives rise to\n\nthe magnetic disturbance or the magnetic\n\ndisturbance to the aurora. The Aurora is not\n\nthe generally seen in low latitudes. It has been\n\nwitnessed in Italy, however, and has not infre-\n\nquently been noticed by mariners off the Southern\n\npart of the coast of Australia. It has been occa-\n\nsionally distinctly observed in daylight, though of\n\ncourse not with the same brilliancy as at night.\n\nBut it is most frequently remarked shortly after\n\nsunset. Some persons have averred that they\n\nhave heard it accompanied by a crackling sound,\n\nlike the rustling of silk, but others who have\n\nwatched purposely to detect the faintest trace of\n\nsuch a noise, declare that it must be an illusion\n\nof the senses. It is impossible of course to prove\n\na negative, but it has been supposed that it would\n\nbe so natural to imagine a sound as connected\n\nwith the aurora, that observers have fancied they\n\nheard it, and reported accordingly. What the\n\nAurora is, remains as much a puzzle as ever.\n\nFaraday ventures the conjecture that it may be\n\nelectricity returning from the poles to the equator\n\nto restore the electrical equilibrium of the earth.\n\nBut he proposes this only as a guess, and puts it\n\nforward rather as a guide to future inquiry than\n\nas at all proved by what is known. We know\n\nthat under certain conditions electricity becomes\n\nluminous. We can produce the phenomenon on a\n\nsmall scale with our apparatus; we see it in\n\nnature on a large scale in lightning. It is easy\n\nto imagine, therefore, that under other conditions,\n\nthe precise nature of which we are unacquainted\n\nwith, and which we cannot, therefore, attempt to\n\nreproduce, it may become luminous in the form of\n\nAurora. The effect of the Aurora on the working\n\nof electric telegraphs has been observed in Eng-\n\nland and in Italy. We are not aware whether\n\nthis effect has been observed in localities beyond\n\nthe range of the visibility of the Aurora. Had the\n\ncause of the stoppage of the electric communica-\n\ntion been suspected on Monday, it is possible that\n\nsome signs of the Aurora might have been detect-\n\ned, or at any rate magnetic observations would\n\nhave verified the fact of its existence.\n\nLAMENTABLE ACCIDENT.—On Monday\n\nevening an accident occurred to a widow,\n\nlately residing in Brisbane, whose name is\n\nMrs. Ross. A party was proceeding to the\n\nresidence of Mrs. Genery, Kedron Brook,\n\nwith a bullock-dray, and between this and\n\nthe Three-Mile Scrub the dray, by some\n\nmeans, was overthrown. There were three\n\nwomen on the dray, Mrs. Genery, her sister,\n\nand Mrs. Ross, and some children. The arm\n\nof Mrs. Ross was crushed, but the others\n\nescaped without injury. The poor woman\n\nreached the hospital, and on examination of\n\nthe crushed limb by Drs. Cannan, Barton,\n\nand Bell, amputation was deemed necessary,\n\nwhich operation was skillfully performed.\n\nWe made inquiries yesterday, and were in-\n\nformed that the woman was progressing fa-\n\nvorably.\n\nNEW FRUIT.—The papaw apple (carica\n\npapaga). Mr. A. J. Hockings has succeeded\n\nin fruiting this beautiful tree, which is the\n\nfirst of his Indian fruit trees in bearing;\n\nand if he is as successful with the mango,\n\nstar apple, Bengal quince, &c., our dessert\n\nwill have some dainty and attractive acces-\n\nsions. The papaw apple is exhibited at Mr.\n\nHockings' establishment in Queen-street, or\n\nmay be seen on the tree at his orchard, South\n\nBrisbane. The flavour somewhat resembles\n\nthe rock-melon, and the following description\n\nby Stocqueller, in his \"Fruits of India,\"\n\nmay be interesting. Speaking of the papaw\n\napple he says, \"As a fruit eaten both raw\n\nand boiled, pickled or preserved, it ranks\n\nhigh; the choice ones being of a very rich\n\nand melon-like flavour when eaten with sugar\n\nand wine. As a tree, it is highly ornamental,\n\nfew garden or orchard trees surpass it in\n\ngracefulness of appearance, in which indeed\n\nit approaches to the palm. The size and\n\nbeauty of the leaf, and even of the leaf\n\nstalks, are always much admired when close-\n\nly examined by those to whom the wonders\n\nof tropical vegetation are new. One of the\n\ncurious properties of the papaw tree is, that\n\nit renders tough or newly-killed meat tender,\n\nwhen hung up amongst its leaves for a few\n\nhours.\"\n\nPROSECUTIONS FOR LIBEL.—The particu-\n\nlars of the Shoalhaven libel case will be re-\n\nmembered; how Dr. Lang fared, and also\n\nhow the proprietor of a country newspaper\n\nwas mulcted for the insertion of articles in\n\nconnection with that remarkable outburst of\n\nfeeling. A sympathetic movement has been\n\ncommenced in Sydney, and circulars, re-\n\nquesting the aid of those who have any re-\n\ngard for those concerned, have been issued,\n\ncalling them to aid by subscriptions. A pre-\n\nliminary meeting, to organise a relief fund\n\nfrom Brisbane, is announced for Friday even-\n\ning next, time, half-past seven in the even-\n\ning, to which all those who take any interest\n\nin the matter are invited.\n\nTHE A. S. N. Co.'s NEW WHARF.—By\n\nreference to an advertisement it will be seen\n\nthat the Yarra Yarra wiil discharge cargo\n\nat the new wharf, North Brisbane.\n\nOH MY PROPHETIC SOUL! THE DOCTOR!\n\nThe Herald will certainly make something\n\nof Dr. Lang before it has done with him.\n\nOne week he is pictured as a \"heathen,\"\n\nanother he is denounced as a \"firebrand,\"\n\nbut our contemporary on Saturday last \"caps\n\nthe climax\" by introducing him as \"the\n\nprophet Jeremiah!\" We would suggest to\n\nour friend, the \"ingenious youth,\" the possi-\n\nbility of taking the Doctor's parliamentary\n\nseat from under him, on the ground that,\n\nbeing \"Jeremiah,\" he cannot be John Dun-\n\nmore Lang, and consequently his election for\n\nWest Sydney must be void.—Bell's Life in\n\nSydney.\n\nFAT BULLOCK AND SHEEP.—The immense\n\nfat bullock and two sheep purchased by Mr.\n\nSparke of Mr. Reynolds, of Tocal, have been\n\nslaughtered and were on Wednesday afternoon\n\nhanging outside Mr. Sparke's shop, where a\n\nnumber of people were inspecting the meat,\n\nwhich was very fine, and admiring the gigan-\n\ntic proportions of the bullock. The bullock\n\nweighed 1440 lbs. when dressed, and the\n\nsheep each 80 lbs.—Maitland Mercury.\n\nFAT STOCK.—On Thursday, Dodds and\n\nCo. sold, at Campbell's Hill Sale Yards, two\n\nfat Devon bullocks, and seven fat sheep,\n\nbred and fed by Charles Reynolds, Esq., of\n\nTocal, Paterson. The bullocks were magni-\n\nficent animals, and were pronounced by\n\ncompetent judges to be equal to any prize\n\ncattle exhibited in England. There was a\n\nlarge attendance of purchasers, and after\n\na brisk competition, one bullock was knocked\n\ndown to G. and E. Lee, and the other to A.\n\nSparke, for £40. The sheep were disposed\n\nof for £4 odd each. The prices must con-\n\nvince farmers that Mr. Reynolds is right in\n\nbreeding and fattening first-class cattle.\n\nSome people have thought Mr. Reynolds too\n\nlavish in the prices he has paid for imported\n\nbulls and heifers, but the sale of his fat stock\n\nis a proof that high breeding is profitable.—\n\nNorthern Times, August 20.\n\nMAGNIFICENT BULLOCKS.—We were yes-\n\nterday invited by Messrs. Pritchard and\n\nWilliams, to view a splendid beast, sold by\n\nthem on account of Messrs. G. and E. Lee of\n\nMaitland, to Mr. Henry Bell of Pitt-street.\n\nThe animal is a splendid specimen of Aus-\n\ntralian Beef, weighing (alive) 2040lbs. He\n\nwas bred by Charles Reynolds, Esq, of\n\nTocal, and is stall fed. Mr. Bell, we under-\n\nstand, had a photographic likeness taken of\n\nhis purchase this afternoon, and both it and\n\nthe original are well worthy of inspection.\n\nBell's Life in Sydney."
