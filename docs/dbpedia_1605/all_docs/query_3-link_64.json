        "text": "The Magellanic Clouds from the Southern Hemisphere\n\nIf you want to see the Magellanic Clouds, you have to head south. They’re not visible north of about 17 degrees north latitude. If you’re in the Southern Hemisphere, you can see these satellite galaxies any night of the year because they’re south circumpolar. In other words, they’re close enough to the South Celestial Pole that they never set.\n\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud is one of the closest galaxies to us at about 160,000 light-years away. It’s about 40,000 light-years closer than the Small Magellanic Cloud. As some of the closest galaxies to our home galaxy, they stand out as big, misty blobs of light under dark skies.\n\nScientists estimate the Small Magellanic Cloud contains around 3 billion stars, while the Large Magellanic Cloud houses some 30 billion stars.\n\nThe Clouds in myth\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, Australian Aborigines, the Maori people of New Zealand and the Polynesian people of the South Pacific were familiar with both the Large and Small Clouds. They used them as navigational markers during their oceanic expeditions. They considered these hazy star-clouds predictors of the winds. The website OzSky.org explains:\n\nMany tribes of Australian Aboriginals have ‘dreamtime stories,’ which they have passed down from generation to generation, to explain the universe as they perceive it. One such legend describes the Clouds as the campfires of an old couple, the Jukara. The Jukara relied on other star people to supply them with fish and lily bulbs caught in the Milky Way to survive. The old couple cooked the food over their campfire, which was the star Achernar. The Large Cloud represented the old man while the Small Cloud was the old woman.\n\nAnother myth comes from South Africa. The nearby constellation Mensa the Table got its name from South Africa’s Table Mountain. One story says that the Large Magellanic Cloud is a puff of smoke from a pipe-smoking contest held on the mountain.\n\nIn history, Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi, a Persian astronomer, described the Large Magellanic Cloud in his Book of Fixed Stars in 964 CE. He called it Al Bakr, describing it as the White Ox of southern Arabia.\n\nScience of the Magellanic Clouds\n\nHenrietta Swan Leavitt – famous for her work on the Cepheid variable stars – studied the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds from Harvard College Observatory in Southern Peru. In the early 1900s, she published her work on variable stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, famously showing the relationship between the periods (cycles) of the stars’ variability and their luminosities. Her study was titled 1777 variables in the Magellanic Clouds. The period-luminosity relationship later became a reliable gauge for astronomers trying to parse the riddle of star and galaxy distances.\n\nAstronomers believe that the Large and Small Clouds formed around the same time as our Milky Way, some 12 to 13 billion years ago. Due to their repeated interaction with our larger Milky Way galaxy, it’s thought that great galactic tides might have caused their irregular shape.\n\nThe ongoing Dark Energy Survey found a dark stream of interacting matter between the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Simulations performed by a team of scientists at the University of Arizona suggested that the two galaxies might be interacting with each other and might eventually merge.\n\nRename the Magellanic Clouds?\n\nThe controversy about renaming the Magellanic Clouds is heating up again. It’s been brewing for at least a couple of years. On September 12, 2023, astronomer Mia de los Reyes of Amherst College wrote in an opinion piece in the American Physical Society’s online magazine Physics:\n\nThe Milky Way is surrounded by a host of smaller satellite galaxies. The two brightest are known as the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Both galaxies are visible to the unaided eye, and both have been known for centuries by viewers of the Southern Hemisphere sky.\n\nBut the beauty of these starry objects is clouded by their names, which honor a man who was a colonizer, a slaver, and a murderer. Now I and a coalition of astronomers are calling for the scientific community to rename these galaxies …\n\nThese two famous Milky Way satellites are named for the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, who led the first expedition to circumnavigate the globe.\n\nWhy rename the galaxies?\n\nAccording to Mia de los Reyes and her colleagues, on Magellan’s travels, he killed and enslaved the native peoples he met. De los Reyes wrote:\n\n… Magellan was no astronomer, and he was not the first to document these galaxies. Indigenous peoples across the Southern Hemisphere have names and legends for these systems that predate Magellan by thousands of years.\n\nSome of the previous names and descriptions for the satellite galaxies are beautiful and descriptive. De los Reyes wrote:\n\n… the Mapuche of modern-day Chile and Argentina call them Rvganko, or water ponds, which they think are in the process of drying out. The Kamilaroi of modern-day Australia regard the galaxies as places where people go after death. And the Arimi of modern-day Tanzania see the clouds as a man and a woman who help the Pleiades bring heavy rains during the rainy season.\n\nRead the September 12, 2023, opinion piece by Mia de los Reyes here.\n\nWhat do you think? Share your opinion in the comments below.\n\nMore from Mia de los Reyes\n\nFurthermore, she wrote:\n\n… Magellan committed horrific acts. A first-hand account of Magellan’s expedition describes how, in what is now known as Argentina, Magellan enslaved the native Tehuelche people. He placed iron manacles on the ‘youngest and best proportioned’ men, telling them that the manacles were gifts. In what became Guam and the Philippines, Magellan and his men burned villages and killed their inhabitants.\n\nDespite his actions, Magellan has been – and continues to be – widely honored by the field of astronomy. Magellan’s name currently appears in over 17,000 peer-reviewed academic articles. His name is attached to astronomical objects such as a lunar crater and a Martian crater, both of which are named Magalhaens; the NASA Magellan spacecraft; the twin 6.5-m Magellan telescopes; and most recently, an under construction, next-generation extremely large telescope called the Giant Magellan Telescope. The Magellan telescopes are all located in Chile, a country with a history of violent Spanish conquest. Indeed, Magellan’s ‘discovery’ of the Strait of Magellan allowed Spanish conquistadors to explore Chile’s coast and led to genocidal campaigns against the native Mapuche people.\n\nI and many other astronomers believe that astronomical objects and facilities should not be named after Magellan, or after anyone else with a violent colonialist legacy. We would like the International Astronomical Union – the body in charge of naming astronomical objects – to rename the Magellanic Clouds. We hope other astronomical institutions, particularly the consortia that manage the 6.5-m Magellan telescopes and the upcoming Giant Magellan Telescope, will also revisit the use of Magellan’s name.\n\nRead the September 12, 2023, opinion piece by Mia de los Reyes here.\n\nWhat do you think? Share your opinion in the comments below.\n\nWhat would we call them?\n\nWriting in Science News on September 26, 2023, senior physics writer Emily Conover explained:\n\nThe galaxies have been known scientifically by Magellan’s name since only the end of the 19th century, well after Magellan’s voyage. That’s just a blip in the history of astronomy, the researchers argue.\n\nMore than 100 astronomers have expressed interest in the campaign, anchored by a core group of about 50, de los Reyes says. The group aims to bring the proposal to the International Astronomical Union, in hopes of eventually holding a vote on the name change …\n\nThe astronomers are now trying out new names. One popular suggestion is to call them the ‘Milky Clouds.’ That would maintain the commonly used acronyms, LMC and SMC.\n\nAnd, Conover wrote, it would reflect the galaxies’ connection to something much bigger than any one person: our home galaxy, the Milky Way.\n\nRead the September 26, 2023, reporting by Emily Conover in Science News, here.\n\nWhat do you think? Share your opinion in the comments below.\n\nBottom line: The Large and Small Magellanic Clouds are two of the closest galaxies to the Milky Way. They can be seen without optical aid from southern skies. In September 2023, astronomers again began calling for the clouds to be renamed."
