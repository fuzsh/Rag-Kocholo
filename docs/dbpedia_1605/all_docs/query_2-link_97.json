        "text": "On Saturday, minutes before midnight, folks parked their cars, whipped out the bug spray and laid out blankets at a dark recreation area off the side of Interstate 75 in South Florida and waited for a glimpse of the northern lights.\n\nWhile they didn't see much more than dozens of twinkling stars and an alligator lurking in dark, murky waters behind a guard rail, the ongoing solar storm provided a celestial spectacle in other parts of the country where enthusiastic viewers took to social media and elsewhere to share the sights.\n\nAs forecasters predict even better viewing on Sunday night, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, here's what people saw Saturday.\n\nBetter luck elsewhere\n\nThose in Reno, Nevada, got to see a spectacle of purples and blues as the northern lights danced across the horizon.\n\nPhotos from the National Weather Service's Reno office near Truckee Meadows Community College show the full extent of the colorful night sky.\n\nPeople in Seattle and Mexicali, Mexico, got to take some photos of the northern lights, too\n\nHowever, folks in Joshua Tree National Park, California, had the same bad luck as people in South Florida\n\nWill the northern lights be visible Sunday night?\n\nAccording to NOAA, people in most of Canada and Alaska will be able to see the dazzling lights.\n\nNOAA also predicts that the lights will most likely be visible over a large portion of the US. People as far south as Iowa and Nebraska could potentially see the northern lights tonight."
