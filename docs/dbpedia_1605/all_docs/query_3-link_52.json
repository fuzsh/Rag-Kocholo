        "text": "Over the weekend, Melburnians were treated to an unforgettable display of the southern lights. Thanks to an extreme geomagnetic storm, stargazers around Melbourne were able to see the mesmerising aurora australis in locations like Altona Beach and St Kilda Beach. And if you happened to miss out, don’t worry. While the weekend storm was particularly extreme, we are entering a period of time in the solar cycle known as solar maximum, which means that there will be more solar activity, and possibly more southern lights, to look forward to this year. Stay prepared for the next sighting by figuring out some locations around Victoria for you to visit the next time aurora australis strikes.\n\nGenerally speaking, you’ll want to find somewhere dark, with a view to the south. The further south you go, the better. Visiting a beach is a good plan, because the ocean is nice and flat, allowing you to see further out. Here are some locations for you to check out the next time you’re searching for aurora australis in Victoria.\n\n1. Werribee South Beach\n\nThis beach is a great spot to look out for aurora australis if you’re living in Melbourne’s western suburbs. Located roughly 4o minutes away from the CBD, Werribee South Beach is quiet, faces south and offers great views towards the horizon. While there are a few street lights on the roads, it should be dark enough on the beach for you to enjoy the southern lights.\n\n2. Rickett’s Point\n\nWith its rockpools and clear waters, Rickett’s Point in Beaumaris is a lovely spot to visit during the day. It’s also a great place to look out for aurora australis in Melbourne, as it faces south and offers clear views.\n\n3. Cape Schanck Lighthouse\n\nCape Schanck Lighthouse is a favourite spot for photographers looking to capture the southern lights. Located on the southernmost tip of the Mornington Peninsula, on top of dramatic cliffs, this beautiful corner of Victoria offers panoramic views of the Bass Strait and the night sky. The area has a number of scenic viewing platforms, so you can take your pick.\n\n4. Flinders Blowhole\n\nJust a 15 minute drive away from Cape Schanck Lighthouse, you’ll find Flinders Blowhole. From the carpark, head down the wooden boardwalk and stairway to the lookout, where you can admire the blowhole and take in more southern ocean views.\n\n5. Point Lonsdale Lighthouse\n\nHeading west to the Bellarine, you’ll have a good chance of seeing aurora australis at Point Lonsdale Lighthouse. The surrounding area offers views over the entrance the Port Phillip, and along the coast to Ocean Grove in the west and Cape Schanck in the east. And, most importantly, it provides a great vantage point to seeing the ocean in the south.\n\n6. Great Ocean Road\n\nIt’s hard to pick just one spot on the Great Ocean Road, as this scenic coastal drive has a number of beaches and lookout points that face south. The famous Bells Beach, for example, is about 90 minutes away from Melbourne, and has some lookout points on top of cliffs that will offer a stunning glimpse of the night sky and the southern lights. Aireys Inlet has a number of walking trails that will provide a great vantage point, including the iconic Split Point Lighthouse. And can you just imagine seeing the colourful aurora australis dance through the sky above landmarks like The Twelve Apostles? Given its distance away from Melbourne, a trip to the Great Ocean Road will need some planning ahead of time, but if the stars, or lights, align, it would make some unforgettable photos.\n\n7. Phillip Island\n\nPhillip Island is famous for its adorable penguins, but this island also has wonderfully clear skies and endless ocean views. Simply head to any southern spot or lookout point on the island, like Pyramid Rock and Cape Woolamai. Find more tips here.\n\n8. Wilsons Prom"
