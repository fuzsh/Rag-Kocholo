        "text": "An achromatic lens can be defined as a lens which is made by a combination of two different types of lenses carrying different focal powers in a manner such that the images formed by the light of both the combined lenses are free from chromatic aberration or achromatism. Description: A lens which is specially designed to control the effects of chromatic distortion or aberration (a defect of opt\n\nAn aurora is a natural phenomenon which is characterised by a display of a natural-coloured (green, red, yellow or white) light in the sky. It is a light show which is caused when electrically-charged particles from the sun collide with particles from gases such as oxygen and nitrogen present in the Earth’s atmosphere. Description: Aurora is sometimes referred to as ‘polar light’. It is predomi\n\nCELSS (Controlled Ecological Life Support System) is a scientific endeavor towards the creation of self-supporting environments to maintain and support human life on space stations or colonies. CELSS are typically “Living machines” which should ideally provide full life support (fresh air, organic food and clean water) to its inhabitants by continuous recycling of the waste products produced by th\n\nChandrayaan-1, India’s first mission to moon, was an unmanned spacecraft weighing 1380-Kg along with 11 scientific payloads built in India, UK, USA, Germany, Bulgaria and Sweden. The mission comprised an orbiter and an impactor. Launched successfully by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on October 22, 2008, the spacecraft was designed to study the Moon orbiting around it at a height of\n\nChromosphere is a reddish and glowing layer of gas above a star’s (or Sun's) photosphere. It is actually the transition between corona and the photosphere. Out of the three layers of the Sun’s atmosphere, chromosphere is the second one (with photosphere being the first layer and corona as the third). Description: As the name suggests, chromosphere literally translates into ‘sphere of light’. It\n\nCorona is a luminous envelope of plasma that surrounds the Sun and other celestial bodies. It is extended to millions of kilometres into space and is commonly seen during a total solar eclipse. The intense temperature of the Sun's corona is due to the presence of highly ionized ions which give it a spectral feature. Description: The corona of the Sun is much hotter than its visible surface. The\n\nA cryogenic engine/ cryogenic stage is the last stage of space launch vehicles which makes use of Cryogenics. Cryogenics is the study of the production and behaviour of materials at extremely low temperatures (below -150 degree Centigrade) to lift and place the heavier objects in space. Description: Cryogenic stage is technically a much more complexed system with respect to solid or liquid prop\n\nDSN (Deep Space network) is a network of large antennas and communication facilities, developed and established in the US by the NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration). It is spread across the world to support communication with spacecrafts on interplanetary missions. The DSN also provides the ability to support some Earth-orbiting missions (at Sun-Earth LaGrange points, at lunar dis\n\nDark Matter is referred to the hypothetical matter that scientists have not been able to locate in the universe - either through telescopes or using any other technological method. 27% of the matter in the universe is said to be dark matter. Its existence came to the fore because of its gravitational effects on matters that are visible in the universe. Description: Scientists have been unable t\n\nDoppler Effect refers to the change in wave frequency during the relative motion between a wave source and its observer. It was discovered by Christian Johann Doppler who described it as the process of increase or decrease of starlight that depends on the relative movement of the star. Description: Doppler Effect works on both light and sound objects. For instance, when a sound object moves tow"
