        "text": "Location: South Shore of Iceland near Vik\n\nCamera Gear: Nikon D3, Sigma 20mm ƒ/1.8\n\nCamera Settings: Aperture of ƒ/2.8, Shutter speed of 8 seconds, ISO1600\n\nPicture Discussion: The sharpness of the bands would not be evident if I would have taken a photo that lasted longer. One of the things that attracted me to this image was how evident the curl was to the naked eye.\n\nI waited until the aurora band was low enough on the horizon so that the photographer was visible inside the aurora band.\n\nThis was not a new moon. It was taken mid-month. The moon illuminated the sky. I had to darken the blues, lower the exposure in the foreground shadows, and increase the blacks to get a darker-looking image.\n\nLocation: Yellowknife, Northwest Territories\n\nCamera Gear: Nikon D850, Nikon 14-24mm ƒ/2.8\n\nCamera Settings: Aperture of ƒ/2.8, Shutter speed of 3 seconds, ISO2000\n\nPicture Discussion: The sharpness of the bands would not be evident if I would have taken a photo that lasted longer. One of the things that attracted me to this image was how evident the curl was to the naked eye as it came over the tree line on the other side of the pond.\n\nI took two images and blended them together in post-processing.\n\nIn the image I took of the sky I took the shutter speed down to 3 seconds and increased the ISO to 2000. By doing that I defined the curl and made the sensor more sensitive to light. This captured the magenta between the green curls.\n\nI took a second image. That image was taken with the following settings. An aperture of ƒ/2.8, Shutter speed of 10 seconds, ISO1600.\n\nI then blended the two photos in photoshop so I had a cleaner foreground that was exposed to bring out the details.\n\nThis photo was taken right before the new moon. There was no ambient light because the minimal moon sliver had already gone behind the hills.\n\nI often alter between landscapes and portrait format when photographing the northern lights. The aurora often lends itself to this format of a photo.\n\nLocation: Nunavut, Canada\n\nCamera Gear: Nikon D850, Nikon 20mm ƒ/1.8\n\nCamera Settings: Aperture of ƒ/2.0, Shutter speed of 12 seconds, ISO1250\n\nPicture Discussion: I allowed the image to curl in the sky for longer than I usually do. It softened the aurora bands but allowed it to turn through more of the sky. It also allowed the colors to burn into the image. The magenta started to come through, and the bands of the aurora were exposed throughout the entire image.\n\nI blended two images together to create this image (Reflection and Sky). The sky was a 12-second exposure. The reflection photo was a 20-second exposure. That brought out the pebbles in the foreground. It created a nice anchoring element."
