        "text": "If you've spent any time at all on a social media, chances are you've stumbled across some serious #TravelInspo in the form of swaths of ethereal-looking green and pink lights in the night sky.\n\nWhile the northern hemisphere — we're looking at you, Iceland, Norway and friends — may have a monopoly on the northern lights, there is no need to travel all that way if seeing the aurora phenomena is on your bucket list.\n\nWe have the southern lights, otherwise known as aurora australis, right here in our own backyard.\n\nFor the weather uninitiated, ABC Weather reporter Kate Doyle said the process could be compared to that used in neon lighting.\n\n\"The sun excites atoms of gas in the same way electricity is used to excite the atoms of gas in a neon tube,\" she said.\n\n\"When the excited atoms come back down to earth, as it were, they release their energy in the form of mesmerising light.\n\nExperiment, adjust and enjoy\n\nWe asked our audience to share some of the places they have captured aurora australis.\n\nAnd while the lights are most visible and occur more regularly the further south you go, sightings are not limited to Tasmania.\n\nTo photograph aurora australis there are a few things you will need:\n\nA clear night — the Bureau of Meteorology has a space weather page providing aurora predictions\n\nSet up in a position looking south and away from city lights to avoid light pollution and flare\n\nA tripod, camera, and wide-angle lens (ideally f2.8 or faster)\n\nTo increase your chances of capturing the aurora australis in all its glory:\n\nUse a remote trigger with mirror lock to reduce camera shake — if you do not have a remote try using a timer on your camera\n\nShoot in raw format for better quality photos\n\nTurn your manual focus to infinity — test this on a clear, non-aurora night to avoid disappointment\n\nSet your ISO from 1,600 to 3,200 or greater if your camera has the capability\n\nSet your exposure from 10 to 30 seconds — longer exposures will start to show stars as trails rather than dots\n\nKeep in mind all of these settings will depend on the brightness of the aurora, so experiment, adjust, and enjoy the magic.\n\nBruny Island, Tasmania\n\nTasmanian photographer, Luke Tscharke, has been taking regular snaps of the state's solar activity from Bruny Island, less than an hour's drive south of Hobart.\n\n\"The clearest air in the world also provides for some of the clearest skies, and when the clouds stay away it provides an unobstructed view into the cosmos,\" he said.\n\nCradle Mountain, Tasmania\n\nIn the heart of Tasmania's wilderness and far from any light pollution, Cradle Mountain made an incredible backdrop when Jai Moyle captured an aurora.\n\n\"Never will I see a night like this again,\" he said.\n\nBreamlea, Victoria\n\nSurrounding light pollution, and its more northerly location, can make it harder to see the aurora australis in areas like Breamlea in Victoria, but if there is enough cosmic activity and the aurora is big enough, you might just be in luck.\n\nAugusta, Western Australia\n\nMichelle Peak spotted aurora australis from Augusta in the far south-west of Western Australia in 2015.\n\n\"I have been chasing those amazing southern lights ever since.\""
