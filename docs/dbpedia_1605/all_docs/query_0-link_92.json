        "text": "Every single person who has witnessed the aurora will tell you it’s one of, if not THE, most magical sight they’ve ever seen. It leaves me speechless every time I see it, and I honestly can’t even find words to describe just how breathtaking and unreal it is.\n\nLike all things beautiful, we want to capture it to save the memory, but photographing the night sky in any regard can seem like an incredibly daunting task. It requires a great deal of patience and planning, not to mention the right gear, but I’m here to tell you that everyone is absolutely capable! With this guide, I’ll cover everything to get you started from what gear to use to how to even go about finding the aurora. Warning: once you know when, where, and how to photograph the aurora, it can get extremely addicting.\n\nAs a massive nerd, it’s no shock that I’ve always been enamored by space and its stunningly mystifying celestial objects. One of the reasons why I love shooting the night sky and its many mysteries is how it evokes such wonder in me, like I’m a child again gazing up at the twinkling stars and pondering all the secrets of life, but I digress. Follow along with this guide, whether you’re already an astro shooter or hoping to take your first aurora shot this year, and come away with some seriously epic photos!\n\nP.S. I lead aurora borealis photography tours every winter if you’d like to shoot with me! You can view all of the details on my workshops site, In the Wild Workshops.\n\nWhat Exactly is Aurora?\n\nThe dancing aurora that many know as the northern and southern lights are formed by particles, primarily electrons, that stream into Earth’s atmosphere from the sun and hit atoms and molecules. When these particles collide, they release energy that we see as glowing light. Simplistically speaking, aurora occurs when there’s a disturbance to Earth’s magnetosphere. Thanks to Earth’s magnetic field, the particles flow into our atmosphere at about 65º North and South, which is why the aurora only occurs near the North and South Poles. Aurora is known as aurora borealis in the Northern Hemisphere and aurora australis in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nMany colors can be seen in an auroral display, but the most common colors that our eyes see are green and magenta. The green color is associated with oxygen molecules in the upper atmosphere at around 80 miles, magenta and/or blue is associated with nitrogen molecules that are located at around 50 miles, and the rarest of all colors, red, comes from atomic oxygen higher up in the atmosphere at around 200 miles.\n\nThe aurora can occur year-round, but is only seen in dark skies. In the summer, it doesn’t get dark enough at 65º North and South to see the lights, so the best time for viewing is fall through spring.\n\nI got lucky and had some help from the wispy clouds to diffuse the light reflecting off the quarter moon—think of it like nature’s softbox. Compositional aspects aside, the white snow reflects the aurora extremely well without any moonlight (too well, some might say). As a result, your images may turn out with just a green wash over the entire image. This is where the moon comes into play; it helps to illuminate the foreground elements and neutralize the green cast on the snow. This effect helps to add depth to your photos by separating the foreground and sky.\n\nSmaller city lights can also help you achieve this effect. In the photo below, bridge lights helped to illuminate the mountains in the foreground, which minimized the green cast from the aurora.\n\nFinding the Aurora\n\nAs I said above, aurora can be very difficult to predict (it even confounds scientists!), but there are some helpful apps out there with all of the information you need in order to improve your chances of seeing a spectacular light show. Okay, let’s get nerdy.\n\nThere are two phone apps that I use to help me predict the aurora. I prefer using the app Aurora Alerts for the actual data and My Aurora Forecast for visual representations.\n\nAurora Alerts provides data directly from the DSCOVR (Deep Space Climate Observatory) satellite, which monitors solar winds in real-time from a distance of 932,056 miles from Earth. This is largely beneficial for forecasting, because the satellite can provide anywhere from 15-60 minute advanced warnings, which gives you time to prepare for a fabulous aurora show if need be.\n\nThere is quite a lot of overwhelming information on the “Short Forecast” screen, but once you’re familiar with it, it’s all very useful information.\n\nTo start, let’s look at the screenshots below. There are percentages at the top for the likelihood of seeing aurora at your current location both overhead and at the horizon. Since the aurora borealis is near the North Pole, it will appear to the north if you aren’t quite in the aurora oval, and that’s where the horizon percentage comes into play. I was in Tromsø, Norway for these screenshots, so the percentage is the same because I was so far north at 69.6º N.\n\nBelow that is the most useful information on the screen, four data points from DSCOVR located inside odometer graphics:\n\nSpeed: This measures the speed of solar winds coming from the sun. Particles with a higher speed hit Earth’s magnetosphere harder and have a higher chance of causing collisions and therefore aurora. Ambient solar wind speeds are around 300 km/s, so anything above 500 km/s is good news for aurora.\n\nBz: This is generally regarded as the most important parameter when predicting the aurora. Bz is the solar wind’s magnetic orientation in the south to north direction. Although an aurora can happen with a positive Bz, a negative Bz is generally better. A negative Bz helps the solar wind grab the Earth’s magnetic field, which can more easily lead to an auroral display. The more negative the Bz, the better. -7 and -8 seen in the screenshots are excellent numbers to see!\n\nDensity: Measures how dense the solar wind is. The more particles in the solar wind, the greater chances of an auroral display as more particles collide with Earth’s magnetosphere. A density of 10 is pretty good, but the higher the number, the better.\n\nBt: This measures the strength of the interplanetary magnetic field or IMF. Again, the higher the number, the better.\n\nNext up is the Kp Index, which is a measure of how strong the geomagnetic activity is. The Index is a number from 0 to 9, which is used to refer to geomagnetic activity for a 3-hour period. The lower the number, the lower the geomagnetic activity. This number is also used in relation to how far south the storm will be visible. Many people look at this number alone when trying to predict the aurora, but it should be taken with a grain of salt if you’re far enough north. The Kp isn’t the only indicator for good aurora; I’ve seen Kp 7+ aurora that didn’t result in much, and I’ve seen Kp 1 aurora that absolutely blew my mind. Use the other four metrics above to further your prediction.\n\nLastly at the bottom of the screen, there is an overview of the weather and moon—the current cloud cover, the cloud cover in one hour, when sunrise and sunset is, moon phase, and when the moon rises and sets.\n\nThe “Long Forecast” section of the app (as seen below) is basically just a Kp indicator, so I don’t typically pay a whole lot of attention to that, depending on where I’m located obviously. It can be a good indicator as to when DSCOVR is predicting high aurora activity, but again, the Kp isn’t the tell-all for the strength of aurora if you’re far enough north. The percentages to the right of the Kp-indices measure the cloud cover.\n\nThere is a “Graph” section, but I don’t find the visuals to be that helpful. You can see an image of the aurora oval, but it’s hard to pinpoint exactly where you are as it’s quite a large map.\n\nGear\n\nNow that you know how to predict the aurora, it’s time to shoot! You don’t need top of the line gear to shoot the aurora, but there are certain requirements to keep in mind that will make a big impact. A camera body that’s able to operate manual shooting mode is mandatory, lenses that are wide angle (8mm - 35mm) with fast apertures (think f/1.4 - f/2.8) are preferable, and don’t forget a tripod (which I have, ahem, done)! The following gear options that I use and recommend will give you the best results, but this is by no means an exhaustive list; there are more affordable options out there, but at the cost of image quality.\n\nGetting the Right Exposure\n\nYou’ve made it to your shooting spot and set your camera up on the tripod—now what? It’s time to manually focus on the brightest star in the sky. Take a test photo, scope it out, and adjust from there. Don’t worry, it’s rare if I nail the focus on the first try, especially with a super wide lens. Once you’ve focused and generally set up your composition, the fun begins!\n\nThere are an infinite number of variables that can affect your exposure, and I encourage you to experiment and play around with it. Aurora changes quickly and dramatically, so it can be tough to give a rough estimate of the proper exposure that you’ll need. This is a good place to start:\n\nAperture (f/): It’s generally a best practice to choose the widest aperture that is available for your lens. You want as much light as possible to hit your sensor. A range from f/1.4 - f/2.8 is ideal. The aurora can be quite bright, but it isn’t always, so using the widest aperture available allows you better flexibility.\n\nShutter Speed: This is my most-changed variable when shooting the aurora. I like to play around with different speeds for different effects or for compositing photos together later in post. Because the aurora tends to move rather quickly, you’ll use a faster shutter speed than you may think for photographing the night sky. When photographing the Milky Way, I typically start out with a shutter speed of 8-10 seconds, but I typically start at 2 seconds for the aurora. Sometimes it’s moving quicker and I need to speed up my shutter, sometimes it’s slower and I can slow it down to 4 or 5 seconds. Thankfully you don’t really need to worry about capturing any star trails when photographing the aurora, because your shutter speed will most likely be fast enough. You have creative freedom here as well: if you want to capture the texture of the aurora, choose a faster shutter speed, and if you want to capture something more dreamy and flowy, choose a slower shutter speed.\n\nISO: My second most-changed variable when shooting at night. Usually an ISO around 1600-3200 will be sufficient with an aperture of f/1.8 or f/2.8 for the aurora.\n\nWhite Balance: An oft-overlooked setting, it’s possible to leave this on auto and come away with great results when photographing the Milky Way or other celestial objects, but not so much with the aurora. While it’s easy enough to adjust white balance through post-processing if you shoot in RAW, it’s a good practice to handle this in-camera. When choosing a custom white balance for aurora, I find that I’m drawn toward cooler skies and usually live in the Kelvin range of 3700 - 4200, depending on the scene.\n\nPost-Processing\n\nThis can be a touchy subject for some people, and I’m honestly not sure why. Photography is an art-form, and whatever I like, you may not. Just like with any other subjective art piece. It should be noted that every photo that is displayed on this page (and this entire website) has had some sort of adjustment made to it. With that being said, post-processing can amplify your aurora shots immensely in so many different ways. I almost exclusively use Adobe Photoshop for editing because I personally do a great deal of selective editing and compositing, but Adobe Lightroom will also work just as well for more basic editing.\n\nMy first step in post-processing is envisioning what I wish the photo looked like. What do I want the aurora to look like? Do I want the foreground to play a large role or do I want it to fade away to allow the aurora to truly shine? From there I make my adjustments. I like to split the image into sky and foreground sections and start with the foreground first.\n\nIn the photo below, you’ll see the result of about an hour of editing in Photoshop. You definitely don’t need to make as many edits as I have—this is an extreme example—but it just depends on your vision. I wanted to bring out the epic mountains in the foreground to make them a centerpiece along with the aurora, but just a few edits to bring the shadows up alone would have sufficed as well for a different, moodier photo.\n\nGenerally speaking, these are the steps I take when editing aurora photos:\n\nApply noise reduction.\n\nBring up the shadows and lower any peaking highlights.\n\nUp the contrast to darken the sky while simultaneously brightening the aurora.\n\nRemove any unwanted items, such as airplane lights and hot pixels.\n\nNeutralize any yellow/red cast on foreground from city lights.\n\nColor balance the foreground snow to have a slightly less green/cyan hue.\n\nLast Minute Thoughts\n\nOne cardinal rule of photographing the aurora is that you MUST take some time away from your camera to witness the aurora with your God-given lenses. Simply observing the aurora as a spectator is a full-body experience; you would be remiss not to allow yourself this very special, human activity.\n\nWhile I’m still learning so much myself about aurora, I hope this guide helps you on your photography journey! Remember that art, including photography, is subjective and if you like something that I’ve advised against or vice versa, that’s perfectly okay! Actually, I encourage you to explore and try all sorts of settings and lens variations to find what YOU most like. The more time you spend with your camera practicing, learning, and experimenting, the better your chances of capturing the aurora shot of a lifetime."
