        "text": "A solar storm currently impacting Earth’s magnetic field is bringing with it the possibility to see aurora borealis and aurora australis at locations in the southern US and elsewhere around the world that are normally far out of range for the Northern Lights. You can boost your chances of seeing the dancing magnetic collisions by using something more sensitive than your eyes: your smartphone or anything else with a camera sensor.\n\nA series of energetic blasts from the sun began arriving Friday night and are now continuing into the weekend. These so-called coronal mass ejections (CMEs) have triggered the first extreme (G5) geomagnetic storm, as determined by NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center since 2003. The storm generated aurora seen across the US and beyond. Some were only able to catch a glimpse with the help of some technology most of us carry around all the time.\n\nThere’s entire books written on astrophotography (including this free one from NASA) that will instruct you on how to get dazzling photos like the above, but today I’m more interested in letting the casual skywatcher know your phone may be the best tool to be able to see auroras at all, especially if you’re in a location where they’re rarely visible.\n\nA number of readers shared their best shots from late Friday into Saturday morning.\n\nSimply put, the sensors in your phone or other camera are more sensitive than your eyes.\n\n“Things that the human eye can’t see, your phone can,” explained Brent Gordon at NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center.\n\nGordon says recent geomagnetic storms have yielded photographs of aurora taken in places like Mexico where aurora are rarely ever glimpsed with human retinas.\n\nPointing your camera at a darkened sky with little cloud cover or light pollution during times of heightened geomagnetic activity could yield “a surprising treat” as Gordon puts it.\n\nTo know when to check the sky for the presence of invisible aurora with your camera, you can check the Space Weather Prediction Center’s forecast, or sign up for alerts from a site like SpaceWeather.\n\nOther tips include putting your smartphone camera into night mode, or setting your camera to take longer exposures. For best results, a tripod is also a good idea."
