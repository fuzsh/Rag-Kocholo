        "text": "Nau mai!\n\nThis weeks blog is a quick one to show you what I captured during the spectacle that was Tahu-nui-a-rangi - more commonly known as the aurora australis. It was a light-show visible all over the country (from Saturday morning through to Sunday evening) and it was a once in a lifetime phenomenon!\n\nMy mornings start well before the sun comes up and Saturday morning was no different, although this particular morning the sky to the southeast had a faint pink glow to it. My bro noticed it first so we headed up to the sand dunes before our walk and my first thought was the northern lights, but, as we got in to our walk I assumed it was the glow of the morning sun coming up. It wasn’t until later in the day a photographer I follow shared a few pics of the morning that I realised it was in fact the southern lights lighting the sky. It didn’t take long to figure out there was going to be another flare up that night so I waited patiently for the sun to set and headed to the beach with the fam.\n\nHere’s what I captured."
