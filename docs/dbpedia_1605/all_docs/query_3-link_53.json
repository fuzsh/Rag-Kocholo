        "text": "2. Sequence of events\n\nOn September 1, 1859, Richard Carrington and Richard Hodgson, while observing a large sunspot group independently, were the first to observe a white light flare (Carrington, 1860; Hodgson, 1860). Both observers also noted the nearly simultaneous Solar Flare Effects (SFE) seen in ground-based magnetometers from currents arising from enhanced ionospheric ionization. Within ~17 h later the Earth experienced the massive auroral display of September 2–3 from a coronal mass ejection (CME). The Great Storm in 1859 occurred about 10 months prior to the peak of the sunspot number, but that was not an unusually strong peak, only about 98. Of the 33 cycles since 1700, there have been 16 that have peaked higher. This indicates that the sun is capable of producing solar wind conditions (e.g., CME) necessary to produce a comparable auroral event during almost any solar cycle.\n\nThe database developed for this study contains observations of aurora, magnetometer, and telegraph station information and was complied from scientific reports [primarily Editors, 1859, 1860a,b,c; Loomis, 1860a,b, 1861a,b, 1865] (periodicals and books), newspaper accounts, ship logs, other manuscript reports, and the catalogs created by Kimball (1960) and Silverman (see Hills, 1998). The auroral observations used in this study must contain three major elements. They have to provide a start and stop time of the aurora along with the location of the observation and a description of the auroral form or color. There are literally several hundred reports that the authors have uncovered that could not be used since they typically do not report a start and stop time of the observed aurora. Since aurora are produced by precipitating particles carrying field-aligned currents that close in the ionosphere, magnetic fields generated by these currents can be measured by ground-based magnetometers and induce currents in telegraph systems. As discussed earlier, for the great storm of 1859, these ionospheric currents were so strong that magnetometers frequently went off scale and telegraph systems became inoperable. These observations where included in this study since they provide strong indirect evidence that the aurora was nearby even during the daytime. Once again, start and stop time of these events and location were necessary.\n\nEach panel in is a geographic mercator projection of data for 1-h time spans of the Northern hemisphere for the August 28–29. is the same for September 2–3. The blue lines are the corresponding geomagnetic dipole latitudes. is populated with orange dots marking the location of the auroral observations and blue dots the magnetometers stations. The poleward (yellow) and equatorward (orange) auroral boundaries from the Holzworth–Meng model (Holzworth and Meng, 1975) have been added to show the extreme lower latitude auroral zone boundary. It is important to note that the equator-ward boundary uses a Q index of 60 in which a Q index of 11 is the largest recorded over the last 40 years. Although use of Q index of 60 is not a valid input to the model it is the only way we can obtain some idea of where the auroral zone might be located. In the second panel from the top of , close to the height of event on September 2 the auroral zone from the extrapolated Holzworth–Meng model is within 8° of the magnetometer observations in Bombay, India.\n\nThe database used in this study contains all the information the authors have been able to find in the 1859 event no matter where the location of the observations comes from (for example there might be several papers that describe the aurora observed in New York City). The only filter that is used is that each observation must contain information that can uniquely describe the time of the observation (i.e.; “at sunset,” “at 8PM,” “lasting till midnight,” “continued till sunrise”). It is important to note that 1859 was well before the adoption of a standard time system and that variations of an hour can easily exist. All efforts were made to map the reported observation time to universal time, which is then used throughout this study. As a default, reported times were assumed to be “local time” unless specifically noted in the report. The fact that the observed aurora existed for many hours greatly facilitates this analysis making the data set look more uniform than it probably is, as shown in . In addition, nearly all of the observations are not precise beyond 30–60 min as reported.\n\nAll auroral observations used in this study are plotted in by the absolute value of their corrected geomagnetic latitude versus the derived universal time (ranging over 8 days around the event) using the 1900 model coefficients in the international geomagnetic reference field (IGRF) model (see for example: Campbell, 1997). The IGRF 1900 model coefficients are the closest to 1859 that have been published, and are the most authoritative magnetic field model that can be used (we did not extrapolate the coefficients back to 1859). Corrected geomagnetic coordinates are important for accurate mapping of the observations. Since this event is very near equinox it is reasonable to add both the Northern and the small number of Southern hemisphere data together. The long black bars show that the auroral sightings were made over significant portions of the night and over an extensive range in geomagnetic latitudes, the blue bars are from telegraph stations and the orange bars from ground magnetometer stations.\n\nThe data in are all ground-based observations that by their very nature must be made on a cloudless night. The unique data in are from US government ship logs stored in the archives of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and provide the data containing the lowest latitude observations of the aurora. The NARA Record Group (RG) 24 contains records from the Bureau of Naval Personal while RG27 are records from the Weather Bureau. Clearly, regions on the globe were very cloudy accounting for gaps in coverage. Many of the US government ships were in harbors at various locations in Japan and did not see the aurora, however, we have an observation of a red aurora being observed in Northern Japan at the same time (Nakazawa et al., 2004). To compensate for times of clouds an “envelop” or probably maximum extent for the aurora is given in as a dashed line. The actual variation is not known but it is expected that it would be within this envelope at any one time. Also shown is the Bombay magnetometer station data that Tsurutani et al. (2003) claim is measuring the ring current.\n\nTable 1\n\nShipDateLocal timeLatitudeLongitudeReferenceReleaseAugust 288 to midnight39° 11′N72° 07′RG24SavannahAugust 288 to midnight37°24′N65°51′WRG24ArcoleAugust 28–298PM-morning41° 40′46° 45′RG27SavannahAugust 29Midnight to 436°09′N64°11′WRG24SaranacAugust 29Till 4AMPanamaRG24ReleaseSeptember 2Midnight to 435° 32′N60°14′WRG24MessengerSeptember 2By 1AM49° 09′67° 28′RG27ArcoleSeptember 24AM41° 16′27° 12′RG27St. Mary’sSeptember 212:00 AM12°23′00″N88°28′00″WRG24SabineSeptember 212:30 AM11° 14′19″N83°49′30″WRG24\n\nNearly, all the reports during the time of the two maximum auroral expansions to the lowest geomagnetic latitudes were for the brilliantly bright red (Type A) aurora. A vertical strip pattern appears in that is a direct result of the majority of observations coming from English speaking countries when they are on the nightside. Some observations of the aurora in Russia and Asia (Japan was mostly cloudy during the event) and from ship logs fill in this gap and lead us to the conclusion that the aurora was observed steadily for many hours at a time over very large regions as indicated by the latitudinal envelop of the aurora drawn in .\n\n3. Discussion\n\nThe appearance and dissipation of the ring current, as measured by Dst, are the basic definition of a geomagnetic storm. A typically geomagnetic storm lasts for a day or more. The process of onset, expansion, and recovery of high latitude aurora during a geomagnetic storm is defined as a substorm. During a geomagnetic storm, multiple substorms (auroras) are nearly always observed.\n\nSince the white light flare that Carrington (1860) and Hodgson (1860) observed on September 1 is believed to be the initiator of a CME that reached the Earth on September 2–3 (Tsurutani et al., 2003) it is therefore, most likely, that the two major auroral storms on August 28–29 and again on September 2–3 as shown in are from two closely spaced interplanetary CME’s reaching the Earth very close together. The interaction of a fast CME plowing through a slower CME has been observed (Gopalswamy et al., 2001) and produces a stronger shock. This effect may be partially responsible for the extreme nature of the September 2–3 auroral event. It is for these reasons that this study has loosely referred to these two major auroral substorms as part of one geomagnetic storm.\n\nMany of the high latitude ground-based magnetometer data are unusable since the auroral currents were so strong that they went off scale. Recently, Tsurutani et al. (2003) reanalyzed the ground-based magnetometer observations at Bombay, India. The main conclusion reached by that study was that the Bombay magnetometer, on September 2–3, was primarily observing the ring current and that it reached a phenomenal Dst of −1760 nT at the beginning of the event. The long red bar in , on September 2 near 10° corrected magnetic latitude, shows the total time interval of the reported Bombay magnetometer Dst observations. As shown in , the large negative Dst values of the Bombay magnetometer occurred during a time of rapid equatorward expansion of the aurora to the incredibly low geomagnetic latitudes (as observed on the nightside) of ~18°. Ground-based auroral electrojet magnetometer measurements of −1760 nT, although large, are much more in line with what is measured from auroral currents than the ring current. Based on these results, the Bombay magnetometer was most likely measuring magnetic field perturbations from currents in the nearby auroral electrojet and the magnetopause, in addition to the ring current with the nearby auroral electrojet potentially dominating the measurements."
