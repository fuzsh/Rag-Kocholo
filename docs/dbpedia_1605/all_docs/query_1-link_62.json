        "text": "Recommended Camera Settings\n\nYou will need to crank up the light sensitivity (ISO) of your camera as far up as your camera allows while still retaining a decent image quality. For entry level cameras that will be something around ISO 800- 1500. With professional cameras like the Nikon D850, Sony A7R4, Canon 5D IV, Canon EOS R 5 and many more, you can also go way further up to ISO3600-8000 and still get a printable result. Then there are also the ISO monster like the Sony Alpha A7S III. These fantastic little night vision devices allow you to go up to ISO 45000 and still retain a nice workable file at a lower resolution.\n\nOpen the aperture (f-stop) of your lens as much as you can to let as much light as possible hit the sensor. After all we are talking about night photography, which of course includes shooting in total darkness depending on the moon. Entry level l enses will most like stop at f 4 or f 5.6. This doesn´t mean that it´s impossible to shoot night images with them, but you won´t have much playground compared to more sophisticated lenses. Even a small jump in the aperture will mean significantly less light hitting the sensor of your camera. You´ll most likely be forced to shoot at the higher end of your ISO range and still need to do long exposures of around 30\". Most professional lenses will offer at least f2.8. A very popular lens for aurora photography which i almost exclusively use for this purpose is the NIkkor 14-24 2.8.\n\nEven Canon and Sony users often use this Nikon lens on their cameras, as it has had the fame to be the sharpest zoom lens with the best values for coma and corner sharpness. There are also many prime wide angle lenses that offer wider apertures, but many of them face different issues when used wide open. If this interests you, check out Petapixel about how to read MTF charts. I personally don´t give much about all these charts and controlled test examinations. Instead, i´ll always just search for real life user feedback and then rent a lens in order to test it out there in the field- that´s the only thing that matters to me in the end.\n\nThe exposure you should go for is depending on the intensity of the Aurora and especially the speed of the movement. The faster it dances- the shorter we have to expose to retain the gorgeus textures preventing rendering the result to nothing more than a colorful blop in the sky.\n\nIf the lights are faint and only slowly moving, start with f2.8, ISO1000, 20-30\"\n\nWhen they pick up pace adjust to f2.8, ISO2000, 10-20\"\n\nNow the lights go totally crazy like they are likely to do in the next days you will need to play with the settings to stay under 10\" exposure for the best results.\n\nSomething i have frequently used: f2.8, ISO3600, 2-8\"\n\nAll this is dependant on your camera gear and most importantly light sources like the moon and also the light pollution of street lamps, cities and even boats on the sea. While searching for tips to shoot the Aurora borealis one will often find people saying that the days around new moon are the best. I disagree with this and prefer to shoot with increasing or decreasing moon- but not at full moon. The landscape will be extremely dark around full moon while it get´s lid up beautyfully when the moonlight shines to gently play with the surrounding landscapes. This effect adds so much to a landscape photograph... in the end the best you can do is extending your trip as much as possible to make sure to get multiple chances to shoot the northern lights- this way you can also learn how much moonlight adds to your scenery and how much it can cause trouble when it´s missing.\n\nHow to nail focus in the dark\n\nDuring the night we will be opening the aperture to collect as much light as possible, which also leads to a shallow depth of field. For most purposes of Aurora photography we will want to have as much of our scene tack sharp as possible. We can achieve this by avoiding to have elements too close to the lens.\n\nThe easiest way of focussing in the darkness of the night is searching for a bright light source that is far away from you- some cameras are capable of doing this in liveview using a bright star, for most we´ll have to drop a lamp around 50m from us and then focus on it. Sometimes we can also use the car lights of some other photographers which might be somewhere around or street lamps, houses (which we normally try to avoid- some of the best locations still feature a few of them unfortunately). This will lead to an image that is sharp enough overall and with some sharpening applied in postprocessing it´s totally useable.\n\nNow shooting with wideangle lenses really invites to play with prominent foregrounds- this can result in quite a pain. But luckily there is the great technique of focus stacking. For this you shoot different images at the same settings while adjusting only the focus throughout the scene. I do it manually without even watching it anymore nowadays, but using liveview and a torch to light up the area of interest is also a good technique. This can be very disturbing for other photographers though- so be always conscient about this and don´t overdo it."
