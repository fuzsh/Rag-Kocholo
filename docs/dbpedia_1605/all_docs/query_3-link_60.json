        "text": "A mirror is a surface that reflects almost all incident light. Mirrors come in two types: those with a flat surface, known as plane mirrors, and those with a curved surface, called spherical mirrors. In this article, we will explore two specific types of spherical mirrors: convex mirrors and concave mirrors. We will also delve into the concept of ray diagrams, which help us understand how light behaves when it interacts with these mirrors. By examining the ray diagram of a spherical mirror, we can gain insights into the fascinating phenomena of reflection and image formation.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is a Mirror?\n\nPlane Mirror vs Spherical Mirror\n\nCharacteristics of Concave and Convex Mirrors\n\nConcave Mirror Definition\n\nCharacteristics of Concave Mirrors\n\nConvex Mirror Definition\n\nCharacteristics of Convex Mirrors\n\nImage Formation by Spherical Mirrors\n\nGuidelines for Rays Falling on the Concave and Convex Mirrors\n\nImage Formation by Concave Mirror\n\nObject at Infinity\n\nObject Beyond the Centre of Curvature\n\nObject at the Centre of Curvature or Focus\n\nObject Between the Centre of Curvature and Focus\n\nObject at the Focus\n\nObject Between the Focus and the Pole\n\nConcave Mirror Image Formation Summary\n\nImage Formation by Convex Mirror\n\nObject at Infinity\n\nObject at a Finite Distance\n\nConcave Mirror Image Formation Summary\n\nEngaging Videos on Spherical Mirror\n\nFrequently Asked Questions â€“ FAQs\n\nWhat is a Mirror?\n\nA mirror plays a fascinating role in reflecting light, resulting in the formation of images. When an object is placed in front of a mirror, we observe its reflection. Incident rays originate from the object, and the reflected rays converge or appear to diverge to create the image. Images formed by mirrors can be classified as real image or virtual image. Real images are produced when light rays converge and intersect, while virtual images are formed when light rays appear to diverge from a point.\n\nRay diagrams are employed to comprehend the behaviour of light and better understand image formation. These diagrams use lines with arrows to represent incident and reflected rays, allowing us to trace their paths and interactions with the mirror. By interpreting ray diagrams, we gain valuable insights into how images are formed and a deeper understanding of how our eyes perceive objects through reflection.\n\nPlane Mirror vs Spherical Mirror\n\nA plane mirror is a flat, smooth reflective surface with a clear, undistorted reflection. When an object is reflected in a plane mirror, it always forms a virtual image that is upright, of the same shape and size as the object.\n\nOn the other hand, a spherical mirror exhibits a consistent curvature. It possesses a constant radius of curvature (In the context of spherical mirrors, the radius of curvature refers to the distance between the centre of the spherical mirror and its curved surface.). Spherical mirrors can create both real and virtual images, depending on the position of the object and the mirror. Spherical mirrors are further categorized into concave and convex mirrors, each with distinct properties and image formation characteristics.\n\nIn the upcoming sections, we will detail the characteristics of convex and concave mirrors, along with a comprehensive understanding of the images formed by these mirrors when the object is placed at various positions with the help of ray diagrams.\n\nCharacteristics of Concave and Convex Mirrors\n\nConcave Mirror Definition\n\nA concave mirror is a curved mirror where the reflecting surface is on the inner side of the curved shape. It has a surface that curves inward, resembling the shape of the inner surface of a hollow sphere. Concave mirrors are also converging mirrors because they cause light rays to converge or come together after reflection. Depending on the position of the object and the mirror, concave mirrors can form both real and virtual images.\n\nCharacteristics of Concave Mirrors\n\nConverging Mirror: A concave mirror is often referred to as a converging mirror because when light rays strike and reflect from its reflecting surface, they converge or come together at a specific point known as the focal point. This property of concave mirrors allows them to focus light to a point.\n\nMagnification and Image Formation: When a concave mirror is placed very close to the object, it forms a magnified, erect, and virtual image. The image appears larger than the actual object and is upright. The virtual image is formed as the reflected rays appear to diverge from a point behind the mirror.\n\nChanging Distance and Image Properties: As the distance between the object and the concave mirror increases, the size of the image decreases. Eventually, at a certain distance, the image transitions from virtual to real. In this case, a real and inverted image is formed on the opposite side of the mirror.\n\nVersatile Image Formation: Concave mirrors have the ability to create images that can vary in size, from small to large, and in nature, from real to virtual. These characteristics make concave mirrors useful in various applications such as telescopes, shaving mirrors, and reflecting headlights.\n\nConvex Mirror Definition\n\nA convex mirror is a curved mirror with the reflecting surface on the curved shapeâ€™s outer side. It has a surface that curves outward, resembling the shape of the outer surface of a sphere. Convex mirrors are also known as diverging mirrors because they cause light rays to diverge or spread out after reflection. Convex mirrors always form virtual, erect, and diminished images, regardless of the objectâ€™s position. They are commonly used in applications requiring a wide field of view, such as rear-view mirrors and security mirrors."
