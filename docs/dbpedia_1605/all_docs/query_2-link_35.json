        "text": "I get this question very frequently, whenever I post a photo depicting the Aurora Borealis.\n\nThe answer is simple, but complicated: It depends. üôÇ There is no universal recipe for photographing the Northern Lights, but there are some general aspects that have to be taken care of.\n\nFirst, you need a tripod. Yup, it‚Äôs more important than the camera. Why is that? Usually, you are going to shoot the Aurora from polar or sub-polar regions. Quite often, that means pretty strong winds. And we don‚Äôt want comma shaped stars, right? So, get the sturdiest tripod you can afford. If it‚Äôs not rigid enough, you can hang some sort of weight to your tripod. Most tripods will have a hook, under the central column. Hang anything heavy from it: your backpack, a bottle of water, a rock, your fat cat etc.\n\nThen, you need a camera. Basically, almost any digital camera nowadays (even some mobile phone cameras) will be able to get decent photos of the Lights. The best option would be a DSLR or a mirrorless that gives you full manual control (exposure, aperture, ISO and focus). I use a Canon EOS 5D Mark III for Northern Lights photography, but I got great shots with an Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark II camera, too (the Live Composite mode of the Oly is pretty useful in Aurora photography).\n\nIn terms of lenses, you need a fast wide angle one. f/2.8 would be awesome. Usually, you don‚Äôt want to shoot the Aurora with a focal length longer than 35 mm. A fisheye lens might be useful for those very high activity nights.\n\nA cable/infrared/radio release would also be very useful. I prefer the cable version as you don‚Äôt need batteries to operate it, and that‚Äôs pretty important when you‚Äôre shooting in the cold. If you don‚Äôt have one, you can use the self timer feature on your camera. You need this to get rid of vibrations induced by actually pressing the shutter button.\n\nAs long as we talked about cold conditions, it‚Äôs a good idea to have 2 or three spare batteries and a few memory cards.\n\n[Best_Wordpress_Gallery id=‚Äù2‚Ä≥ gal_title=‚Äùaurora‚Äù]\n\nProbably the most challenging part of the actual shooting is focusing. Your auto-focus won‚Äôt work in the dark, so this is how to do it. Set the camera on manual focus, open the aperture as much as you can, turn on the live view and set a high ISO (around 6400, if possible). If you‚Äôre using a zoom lens, set the focal length. If you want to change it later, you will have to refocus. Now, point your camera to the sky and find a brighter star in the field of view of your camera. Centre the star and zoom in the live view image (not by using the zoom ring on your lens, but the controls on the back of your camera; read the manual of your camera, if you don‚Äôt know how to do it). Now, gently move the focusing ring of your lens and get that star into focus. Once focus is achieved, carefully tape down both the focus and the zoom ring (if there is one) on your lens, using some gaffer tape. Even though you taped the rings, try as much as possible not to touch the rings from now on, unless you need to change settings.\n\nNow, it‚Äôs pretty tricky to give you any advice on the exposure time and ISO. And that‚Äôs because the behaviour of the Northern Lights is unpredictable. They can be static and, in a matter of seconds, they can start moving like there‚Äôs no tomorrow. That‚Äôs why you have to adapt to the Lights. One thing is sure: open up the aperture as much as you can. As a general rule, if the Lights are static you can try ISO‚Äôs between 800 and 1600 and exposure times of 10 to 20 seconds. If the lights move very fast, you will need high ISO (3200 to 6400) and short exposure times (sometimes below 3 seconds; I have even shot Northern Lights at 0.5 seconds).\n\nBe careful with your maximum exposure time, so that you don‚Äôt get trailing stars. We want the stars to be points of light, not small arcs. It‚Äôs a simple formula that gives you this value: 500 divided by the focal length (full frame equivalent) of your lens (t = 500/fl, where fl = focal length and t = maximum exposure time for point stars). Stay below that number and you will get nice point like stars.\n\nAnother thing to be careful with is framing. Try to include some terrestrial elements and/or people in the photo and use the rule of thirds. The results will be a lot better than shooting just the sky. Of course, shoot RAW files. Many photographers will tell you to avoid Moon lit nights when shooting the Northern or Southern Lights. I tell you the contrary. The landscape will always look better when you have the Moon present in the sky. Moonless nights will make all terrestrial elements look dark and featureless. I don‚Äôt like that at all.\n\nLast, but totally not least, take the time and look at the Aurora with your own eyes. It‚Äôs a mind blowing experience. Yes, the Lights will look a lot more saturated and brighter in your photos, because of the way cameras see the world, but experiencing a strong display of the Northern Lights with your naked eye could be life changing.\n\nClear skies!"
