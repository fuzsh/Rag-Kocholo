Bell Funeral Home Inc. Condolences may be sent to the family via the guestbook at www.jfbellfuneralservices.com\n\nVirginia Lee Germino\n\nVirginia Lee Germino, née Roseborough, a Charlottesville resident for over half a century, died of a stroke at the age of 88 on March 2, 2022. Born in DeLand, Florida, on August 5, 1933, she was the daughter of Rudolph William Roseborough, Sr., and Mary Audrey Bullington Roseborough. Her older sister, Margaret Paul Jones, survives her, as do five children: Helen Lianos with her partner David Shorto, Ruskin Roseborough, Laura Germino with her husband Greg Asbed, Renata Germino with her husband Anthony Smith, and Monica Germino, whose husband Louis Andriessen died last year. Her firstborn, Margaret Julia Germino, died in 1956, leaving a hole in Virginia's heart that never fully healed. She leaves five grandchildren: Rebecca Lianos, Chloe Lianos with her husband Ben Upton, Ariana Smith, Maya Jane Smith, and Isaiah Germino Asbed, and a step-granddaughter Laura McIntosh Kellert with her husband Will Kellert. She is also survived by many beloved nieces and nephews, their children and grandchildren, and by many godchildren.\n\nA brilliant and precocious student, Virginia Roseborough left her sleepy inland Florida hometown to lead a life full of travel and discovery. Her adventures took her to Allied-occupied Germany at the age of 15, where she sold cigarettes to GIs to fund her travels, then to Duke University at 16, and onto Harvard and Wellesley, followed by several years in the Philippines. After returning to establish the family home in Charlottesville, Virginia continued her travels, including a year-long stay at the American Academy in Rome and an archeological dig in Palermo, Sicily at the age of 50. While at Duke she met and married Dante Germino, with whom she later traveled around the world, their five children and 26 suitcases in tow. She received a full scholarship for her graduate studies in history at Harvard, was graduated summa cum laude, and was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship for studies in Italy. During her years in Manila, Virginia strove to add Tagalog to her repertoire of Italian and German. She was perpetually curious, blessed with a voracious and expansive mind.\n\nVirginia was tender but fierce, devoted to justice and equality and the need to actually accomplish both. As a teenager at Duke in the 1950s, she used a petition to end the practice of maids from Durham having to make the beds daily for students in campus dormitories. Virginia said the privileged youth of Duke ought to be old enough to handle that task on their own. In 1968, Virginia settled with her family in Charlottesville, two years before the University of Virginia went co-ed and only a few years after public schools had desegregated. While raising five children, she fought for civil rights, taking stances some deemed controversial at the time, but are now simply the right thing to do. She joined Trinity Episcopal Church in 1969, and later, St. Paul's. A longtime member of the City's Committee to select \"Bridge Builders\" for the Drewary Brown Memorial Bridge, Virginia initiated the idea for stories of the Bridge Builders and collaborated on writing and editing Bridge Builders 2001-2016, recounting the lives of the 37 people honored for crossing racial, economic, and social barriers to create a better Charlottesville. Virginia was instrumental in the decision by St. Paul's Memorial Church to sponsor a Vietnamese family of refugees in 1979 following the Vietnam War. She took the family of four into our household of seven, making space for them to live in the already-full house and in our family's hearts for what continues today as a lifetime of friendship.\n\nAn active parent in making Charlottesville schools a welcoming place for all, regardless of gender, religion, or race, she joined with other parents to pioneer the Unitarian Co-op nursery school uniting the children in town. Virginia's reaction to a daughter being sent home from 3rd grade in the 1970s for wearing a pantsuit was to inform the school their dress code needed to change. And so it did. Her commitment to bettering the city and the schools, and welcoming newcomers to the community, is carried on by one of her daughters, a teacher and program director for immigrant and refugee students. A founding member of the Yellow Dog Democrats, Virginia rarely missed a Wednesday lunch, and when the political landscape was bleak, she embodied the attitude of \"pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will.\" She was recognized for distinguished service by Offender Aid and Restoration (OAR) for her outreach to the prisons, and was active in the local ARC, advocating for children with special needs. She was a loyal supporter of migrant farm workers' fight for human rights, even marching with hundreds of workers and alongside her elderly mother, a daughter, and son-in-law behind a 12-foot tall, papier mache replica of Lady Liberty.\n\nVirginia taught as a faculty instructor at the Darden Business School for many years, teaching composition and grammar to students who may not have understood the importance of good writing for their careers at first, but certainly did by the end of her class. She sang enthusiastically in the St. Paul's Memorial Church choir and the Oratorio Society, and proudly claimed her role as last-chair clarinet in the Charlottesville Municipal Band. She ensured that all her children played at least one instrument, and to her relief a daughter and a son became highly accomplished musicians and her eldest inherited her voice.\n\nVirginia was quick to smile with an impish grin and never lost her beautiful and wry sense of humor. She was a linguist, an editor, a proofreader, a teacher, and a master of the Letter to the Editor. She inhaled museums and absorbed concerts. She loved baseball, and later in life became an impressively informed fan of football so she could stay connected to her grandson. She was an insatiable reader, a passionate gardener, and a competent carpenter. She loved the Blue Ridge Pool and knew every single person there. Despite her declining health over recent years, Virginia continued to relish each day, watching the bird feeder for cardinals and orioles, scolding the squirrels and the deer, delighting in crocuses, snowdrops, and Magnolia blossoms, and relishing the frequent visits from family, friends, and neighbors.\n\nMore than anything, she listened. To her children, their spouses, her grandchildren, to all those she loved. She loved her family and her enormous group of friends with all her heart. Her house was a hub, a homeplace to all. Children and grandchildren remember her cinnamon apples, German's chocolate cake, Rocky Road fudge Christmas cookies, and her seven-layer rainbow cake.\n\nIn fond remembrance of our dear mother, the fearless editor, we hope no grammar or punctuation have been harmed in the writing of this obituary.\n\nThe funeral service will be held on Monday, March 14 at 2:00 pm at Saint Paul's Memorial Church in Charlottesville, followed by a reception back at her home and yard, the site of many Egg Hunts, weddings, and legendary parties. J.F. Bell Funeral Home is in charge of arrangements.\n\nThe family wishes to thank Mavis Boateng and Virginia's other dedicated caregivers. Contributions in Virginia's memory may be sent to the NAMI Blue Ridge, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, the International Rescue Committee, or to a charity of your choice.\n\nChristine E Crenshaw\n\nChristine E Crenshaw age 87, of Charlottesville VA entered into eternal rest peacefully at her residence on Wednesday, March 2, 2022. She was born on May 31, 1934, to the late Theodore R and Elizabeth Carter Walker of Covesville VA.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her husband of 67 years, Lawrence E Crenshaw Sr.; a daughter Gloria Luck, a son Michael Crenshaw; and a grandson Gerald Luck; three sisters, Emma Berkley, Wilma Roland, and Annie Banks; three brothers, Theodore Walker Jr, Charles Walker, and Walter Walker.\n\nShe is survived by her son Lawrence E Crenshaw Jr, two daughters, Patricia Crenshaw (friend William) and Vivian Sandridge (Larry) all of Charlottesville VA; two granddaughters, Regina Luck of Charlottesville VA and Alicia Patterson (Quincy) of Fluvanna County; one grandson, Aaron Sandridge (Alexis) currently of Richardson TX; six great-grandchildren, Dionte Ruffin, Cordaisia Ruffin, Camren Woodson, Cayson Sandridge, Aubree Patterson, and Mela Sandridge; two sister, Evelyn Watkins of Charlottesville VA and Ruth Goodloe of Providence Forge VA; one brother, William Walker of Charlottesville VA; and a host of other relatives and friends.\n\nChristine was educated in the Albemarle County school system.

There she served on the usher board and volunteered in the soup kitchen. She attended church faithfully until her health declined her to do so.\n\nMost of all she loved her family, she was a caring and devoted wife, mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, sister, aunt and friend to all. The strong values that she instilled in us have served us all well. She will be dearly missed and forever be in our hearts.\n\nA graveside service will be held at 12 p.m. on Saturday, March 12, 2022, at Oakwood Cemetery.

His love of browsing began when working as a page at the New York Public Library. Working in 1963 at MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory, he met Gayle Mueser; they married weeks later at her parents’ home in Chappaqua, NY. In 1965 he became a professor of cognitive psychology at UVA, where he was a devoted teacher, colleague and mentor until retirement in 1998. Soon after arriving in Charlottesville, he helped found the Virginia chapter of the ACLU. A question from his daughter Ruth in the 1970s inspired him to take up birding; from 1991-1993 he served as President of the Ivy Creek Foundation. He was an avid player of table tennis and squash until almost 85.\n\nArthur was fascinated by the mental life of expert problem-solvers, which he explored in a course called “The Mind of The Puzzler.” He won the senior division of the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament in 2007 and 2015 — though he considered himself a better creator than solver. He published his first crossword in the New York Times in 1952, at 17. He contributed puzzles to the Times for almost seven decades. In 2010, Times puzzle editor Will Shortz described him as “one of the 10 best constructors in the country.” Arthur ultimately persuaded Shortz to publish a new kind of puzzle he pioneered — the vowelless crossword.\n\nHe published two books, “Websterisms,” with Jill Lepore, and “Resonances,” a commonplace book designed by Josef Beery. On April 26, 2020, he was delighted when two fellow travelers from the National Puzzlers League used an Arthur Schulman quotation as the solution to the New York Times acrostic. That phrase resonates with his own omnivorous cast of mind: “Roget had many irons in the fire before compiling his thesaurus. His writings include treatises on physiology and phrenology, on inhaling nitrous oxide; and a method of completing a knight's tour of the chessboard.”\n\nHe leaves behind his beloved spouse of 57 years, Gayle Schulman, his sister Phyllis Greer, daughter Ruth, son David and his spouse Anne, and many beloved friends.\n\nArrangements by J.
