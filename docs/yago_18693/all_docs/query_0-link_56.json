Observing the situation from the deck, her coach, Andrea Fuentes, quickly realized that something was amiss. Without hesitation, Andrea dove into the pool fully clothed and pulled Anita to safety. Anita, in an unconscious state, was unable to make any efforts to save herself. Andrea's prompt action was a decisive factor that prevented a potential tragedy. This incident serves as a powerful reminder that in challenging times, having individuals who actively watch out for us and take immediate action is crucial. Reflecting on this scenario, it prompts us to consider who plays the role of a vigilant supporter in our lives. In moments when we feel overwhelmed or incapable, who are the people that would notice, seek us out, and extend a helping hand to bring us back to the surface? Conversely, can others count on us to be that vigilant and supportive presence? Are we willing to dive in and offer assistance when they find themselves struggling in the turbulent waters of life, depleted of strength and resilience? This story underscores the significance of building a supportive network and being a reliable source of aid for those around us when they face challenges beyond their capacity to navigate alone.\n\nGood morning, champions! Ja, even though we lost the Ruggers, we‚Äôre still champions! I mean, Kgothatso Montjane won the Wimbledon Wheelchair Doubles Title, Kearsney College Choir was crowned the champions of the Golden Voices of Barcelona competition, and The Kiffness is R23,000 away from raising R1 million to help a little hero battling Lyme Disease. See champions! It‚Äôs another Monday, and I'm here to remind you that self-motivation is the key to unlocking your true potential. It is a surefire way to becoming a champion! So let's have a real talk for a second... because we're all in this together. Some days, even the most driven individuals wake up with zero motivation. Trust me, I've been there, and today is one of those days. I believe South Africans are solar-powered‚Ä¶ and this cold weather outside is making it even harder to find the strength to get out of bed (it is currently 2¬∞ in Jozi). But you know what? We can do this! Being motivated, being inspired, and finding those good things in life requires effort. It's not always easy, but nothing truly worthwhile ever is. It's like personal hygiene ‚Äì just as we need to shower or bath every day to stay clean, we need to take care of our minds every single day. Motivation is not a one-time fix; it's a continuous process. To help us get there, I've listed 10 ways to keep that flame of motivation and inspiration burning bright: 1. Kick-Off with Positive Affirmations. 2. Surround Yourself with Positivity. 3. Set Achievable Goals. 4. Draw Inspiration from Others. 5. Embrace Failure as a Stepping Stone. 6. Take Care of Your Well-being. 7. Keep a Gratitude Journal. 8. Step Out of Your Comfort Zone. 9. Celebrate Small Victories. 10. Stay Connected to Your Purpose. Remember my friends, motivation is a daily practice. It's not always easy, but it's worth it. Embrace the challenges, find inspiration in the little things, and keep pushing forward. Together, we can achieve greatness. Wishing you a week filled with motivation, inspiration, and an abundance of good things. You've got this! Okay. Love you. Bye.\n\nWhile there have been many displays of grit at this summer's Olympic Games in Paris, one in particular will remain etched in my memory -- Britain‚Äôs Tom Pidcock's mountain bike race to victory. If you missed it, here are the highlights. Pidcock had to make an unplanned pit stop on his third lap (in this 8-lap event) to replace a flat tire, which put him way behind the leaders and almost certainly out of the running for a stellar finish. With five laps to go, he jumped back in and is quoted as telling himself, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no point in stressing over it, is there? That‚Äôs not going to get me back to the front.‚Äù Pidcock gave it his all. Fast forward to the final lap of the 22-mile race, and Pidcock was in the number two position, following the top-ranked mountain biker in the world. When the leader had an unlucky break, Pidcock jumped to the lead to claim the gold for Great Britain. You can check out the details here: https://lnkd.in/gxsp7q2k. I have an observation from Pidcock's surprising comeback that I believe applies to us as business leaders. With so much uncertainty in our environment, a catastrophe in the early stages of a project or career isn't always fatal. But it does require grit -- including an abundance of mental toughness -- to make a comeback. If you've got a personal comeback story, I'd love to hear about it over a cup of coffee.\n\nChapter 2. Clapping. ________________ * *There is a noise/a sense/ an inner something? .....to insert in the blank. I'm not sure exactly what it is? 2-1. England footballing performances... __________ Make your own noise here! .................... But wait, A win is a win. Enjoy the moment - Live in the present. We must ALWAYS celebrate our wins. A win is a great thing. I spent the afternoon with a group of some 40 others. For 90 and a bit minutes the mood had been quite different. Frustrated, challenged, opinionated. And then............... Somewhere in the 90+ something minute a single moment changed the mood of a nation. Amidst the immediate euphoria - When the jumping, punching of the air, cheering, whooping and hollering had subsided ..... A moment of calm brought with it a round of applause. It was collective. This wasn't one of those \"Its time for us all to clap\" moments - This was involuntary. It was spontaneous. It brought with it a smile to everyones face. Things don't always go exactly as we might think they will. The path is often not straight, and very frequently littered with potholes, a dodgy paving slab, and a wonky kerb. - But reaching the next junction is the goal. In English football terms - The checkpoint for this moment in time has been reached. Mission so far accomplished.... Lets move onto the next part of the journey. That goal was magnificent. But be it Sport, Business, or I think just life...... If we are here to accomplish a common goal (Which we all are) - then we do it together, its the only way. And what better way to do it..... than by supporting one another - and when able.... with a round of applause. ------------------------------------------ Ps - Gareth and the team - Thank you. (Sigh of relief). You got there üëè Keep believing, Keep working, Keep enjoying. We know you CAN reach the destination.\n\nI‚Äôm back. I was away for the week cheering for my daughter and her team in a World Cup qualifier. Only one team would qualify. And it wasn‚Äôt our team. My daughter‚Äôs the captain of the team and the most experienced. Not sure what you know about international sport, but when you play your first international game you get your ‚Äúfirst cap‚Äù. We had eight players on our team get their first cap in this tournament. It was a long shot to qualify. But they didn‚Äôt act like it. They acted like they had just as much right to be there as all the other teams. At this level, it‚Äôs experience that wins and or loses. Skill wise, there‚Äôs not too much difference. It‚Äôs what happens to those skills under pressure that‚Äôs the challenge. It becomes a mental game more than a physical game at this point. I always learn about life when I have the honour of watching one of these tournaments. Here‚Äôs what I learned this time (to be fair, I already knew a lot of this): 1. Umpires control the game. Don‚Äôt piss them off. (Think, auditors here) 2. You can still compete when 8 of your players have food poisoning. (1. Stop making excuses; just do what you have to do. 2. Find out ahead of time which GI drugs will make it through the athlete drug tests.) 3. Weather happens. Plan accordingly. (Plan! Get snow tires!) 4. The organizing committee will sometimes change their decisions after they give permission for uniform exceptions (1. Get it in writing. 2. Bring a needle and thread. 3. Arguing with the boss is futile.) 5. You can play with a broken thumb. (Take a minute to process the pain, wrap it up, and get on with things.) 6. It‚Äôs not over till it‚Äôs over. (Anything can happen. Keep acting like you‚Äôre going to win.) 7. Skill and composure together lead to respect. 8. You can lead from anywhere. 9. Stop trying to do it on your own. That won‚Äôt work. 10. Play each minute. 11. Timing is everything. 12. Communicate on the court. 13. Build relationships with everyone - your teammates, your coaches, the umpires, the organizing committee, the other parents. You‚Äôll always be glad you did. 14. Have fun and soak up the experience! I couldn‚Äôt be more proud of my daughter. More important to me than how well she played was how well she led a really young team in a really tough tournament with a lot of really unlucky circumstances. This mum is ‚Äúlump in the throat‚Äù proud! ______ I help people communicate well and have more impact at work.
