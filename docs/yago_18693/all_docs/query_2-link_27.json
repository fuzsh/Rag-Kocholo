        "text": "When he fell in love with her, she was 13 years older. When he married her he was 28 and she was 41. After trying to get pregnant and many miscarriages, he stays close to her and supports her. They decide to adopt two children and build their own family. He is dealing with cancer 6 times. She supports him. They have been married for 26 years, scandal-mongering magazines continue to talk about how sexy he is at 53, how fit she is at 66, and at the same time Hugh Jackman and Deborah Furness upload joint photos on Instagram ignoring comments and toxic critics. Every relationship has its own story. Her own path. But common to all relationships that remain alive, it is not love. Many times love alone is not enough. It's the decision to be there, no matter what happens along the way. Choose to stay when the going gets tough. To see the world with the same eyes But don't let it get in the way of the journey"
