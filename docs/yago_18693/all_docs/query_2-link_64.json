        "meta_description": "<u>The Postcard</u>\n\t\n\tA postally unused carte postale that was published by Lévy et Neurdein Réunis of 44, Rue Letellier, Paris. The card has a divided back.\n\t\n\t<u>Diane de Poitiers</u>\n\t\n\tDiane de Poitiers, who was born on the 9th. January 1500 at the Château de Saint-Vallier, Drôme, France, was a French noblewoman and prominent courtier. She wielded much power and influence as King Henry II's royal mistress and adviser until his death. \n\t\n\tHer position increased her wealth and family's status, and she was a major patron of French Renaissance architecture.\n\t\n\t<u>Diane de Poitiers - The Early Years</u>\n\t\n\tDiane de Poitiers' parents were Jean de Poitiers, Seigneur de Saint Vallier, and Jeanne de Batarnay. She became a keen athlete, and kept a fit figure by riding and swimming regularly, remaining in good physical condition.\n\t\n\tWhen still a girl, Diane was briefly in the retinue of Princess Anne de Beaujeu, King Charles VIII's eldest sister who skillfully held the regency of France during his minority. Like her fellow charges, Diane was educated according to the principles of Renaissance humanism, including Greek and Latin, rhetoric, etiquette, finance, law, and architecture.\n\t\n\tOn the 29th. March 1515, at the age of 15, Diane was married to Louis de Brézé, seigneur d'Anet, Count of Maulévrier, and Grand Seneschal of Normandy, who was 39 years her senior. He was a grandson of King Charles VII by his mistress Agnès Sorel, and he served as a courtier to King Francis I. They had two daughters, Françoise (1518–1574) and Louise (1521–1577).\n\t\n\t<u>Post Marriage</u>\n\t\n\tShortly after her marriage, Diane became lady-in-waiting to Queen Claude of France. After the Queen died, she served in the same capacity to Louise of Savoy, the King's mother, and then Queen Eleanor of Austria. In 1523, her husband uncovered Constable Charles de Bourbon's plot against King Francis I, but did not know at the time that his father-in-law was involved as well. \n\t\n\tIn 1524, Jean de Poitiers was accused of treason and sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted. Instead he was confined to prison until the Treaty of Madrid in 1526.\n\t\n\tAfter her husband died in 1531 in Anet, Diane adopted the habit of wearing black and white for the rest of her life. They were among the permitted colours of mourning, and the symbolic colours of the sides of the moon, playing on her name which derived from the Roman moon goddess. \n\t\n\tDiane commissioned sculptor Jean Goujon to build a tomb for Louis in the Cathedral of Rouen. (To see the large, elaborate tomb, please search for the tag 35CDR97)\n\t\n\tDiane's keen interest in financial matters and legal acumen became apparent for the first time during this period. She managed to retain her late husband's emoluments as grand seneschal of Normandy, and challenged in court the obligation to return the family's appanages to the royal domain. Impressed, King Francis I allowed the widowed Diane to manage her inherited estates without the supervision of a male guardian, and to keep their considerable revenues.\n\t\n\t A noted beauty, Diane maintained her good looks well into her fifties and was immortalized in both sculpture and paintings. She sat for other paintings of the time, often topless or nude, and at other times in traditional poses.\n\t\n\tCharles V's troops captured Francis during the battle of Pavia (1525), and in 1526 the princes Francis and Henry were sent to Spain as hostages for their father. Because the ransom was not paid, the two boys (eight and seven at the time) spent nearly four years isolated in a bleak castle. \n\t\n\tThe experience may account for the strong impression that Diane made on Henry, as the very embodiment of the ideal gentlewoman: as his mother was already dead, his grandmother's lady-in-waiting gave him the farewell kiss when he was sent to Spain. \n\t\n\tAt the tournament held in 1531 for the coronation of Francis's new wife, Eleanor of Austria, the Dauphin Francis wore the colors of the new Queen as expected, but Henry wore Diane's colors.\n\t\n\tIn 1533, Henry married Catherine de' Medici despite opposition to the alliance, since the Medicis were no more than merchant upstarts in the eyes of many in the French court. However, Diane approved of the choice of bride, to whom she was related (Catherine's maternal grandfather and Diane's paternal grandmother were siblings). \n\t\n\tBased on their correspondence, it is generally believed that Diane became his mistress in 1534, when she was 35 years old and Henry was 15. As the couple remained childless and she became concerned by rumours of a possible repudiation of a royal wife that she had in control, Diane made sure that Henry's visits to the marital bedroom would be frequent, to the point that he had ten legitimate children. In another act of self-preservation toward the royal family, Diane helped nurse Catherine back to health when she fell ill.\n\t\n\tDespite his occasional affair with such as Philippa Duci, Janet Fleming, and Nicole de Savigny, Diane remained Henry's lifelong companion. For the next 25 years, she was one of the most powerful women in France. \n\t\n\tWhen Francis I was still alive, Diane had to compete at the court with his mistress, Anne de Pisseleu d'Heilly. In 1544, Anne convinced Francis I that Henry (now the Dauphin) and Diane were working to reinstate Constable Montmorency at court. After his father banished Diane, Henry and his supporters retreated to the Château d'Anet; father and son wouldn't reconcile until 1545. \n\t\n\tAfter Francis' death, Henry had Anne banned from court, and confiscated her duchy of Étampes. By then, Diane's position in the Court was such that when Pope Paul III sent the new Queen the &quot;Golden Rose&quot;, he also presented the royal mistress with a pearl necklace. She received the prestigious title of Duchess of Valentinois in 1548, and was made Duchesse d'Étampes in 1553. Through the extensive patron-client network she cultivated, her sons-in-law received important positions.\n\t\n\tAlthough she was not openly involved, Diane's sharp intellect, confident maturity and loyalty to Henry II made her his most dependable ally in the court. He trusted her to write many of his official letters, which were signed jointly with the one name: &quot;HenriDiane&quot;. \n\t\n\tUntil 1551, she was in charge of the education of Henry's children, and gave orders to their governors, Jean and Françoise d'Humières. Her daughter Françoise managed the Queen's household as première dame d'honneur (chief lady-in-waiting). \n\t\n\tThe King's adoration for Diane caused a great deal of jealousy on the part of Queen Catherine, particularly when Henry entrusted Diane with the Crown Jewels of France and gave her the Château de Chenonceau, a piece of royal property that Catherine had wanted for herself. However, as long as the King lived, the Queen was powerless to change that.\n\t\n\t<u>Diane de Poitier's Construction Projects</u>\n\t\n\tDiane financed and built the bridge of the Château de Chenonceau on the river Cher. \n\t\n\tMost of the written sources in Diane's hand are accounts, demonstrating her meticulous attention to finances. She profited from the confiscation of Anne de Pisseleu's estates and managed the lands well, to the point where she became the beneficiary of 300,000 écus. \n\t\n\tOne of the most successful royal mistresses in acquiring wealth, Diane used her income to build castles by commissioning architect Philibert de l'Orme. Making strikingly effective use of Renaissance arts and rhetoric, she constructed an image of herself as a paragon of virtue, and presented an image of Henry II as a model of chivalry.\n\t\n\tDiane supervised the remodeling of Château d'Anet, her late husband's feudal castle of stone. It has a porch with widely spaced ionic columns between towers crowned by pyramidal spires. The château is noted for its exterior, notably the Fountain of Diana, in which the mistress represented the goddess reclining with her two dogs and stag. \n\t\n\tThere is also the mortuary chapel built according to Diane's wishes to contain her tomb, commissioned from architect Claude de Foucques by her daughter Louise, Duchess of Aumale.\n\t\n\tAlthough her ownership remained with the crown until 1555, Diane was the unquestioned mistress of Château de Chenonceau, the jewel of the Loire Renaissance palaces. In 1555, she asked de l'Orme to build the arched bridge joining the château to its opposite bank, and oversaw the planting of extensive gardens filled with varieties of fruit trees. Set along the banks of the river, her exquisite gardens were famous and much copied.\n\t\n\t<u>Diane de Poitiers - Later Years and Death</u>\n\t\n\tDespite wielding such power over the court, Diane's status depended on the King's welfare, and remaining in power. In 1559, Henry was critically wounded in a jousting tournament, when his lance wore her favour (ribbon), rather than his wife's. \n\t\n\tQueen Catherine soon assumed control, restricting Diane's access to the royal chambers. Although Henry was alleged to have called out repeatedly for Diane, she wasn't admitted to his deathbed, nor invited to his funeral. \n\t\n\tShe was immediately obliged to give to the Queen Mother the Château de Chenonceau in exchange for the less attractive Château de Chaumont, a punishment much less severe than the ones suffered by other royal mistresses.\n\t\n\tDiane lived out her remaining years in her château in Anet, where she lived in comfortable obscurity as a virtual exile. At the age of 64, she suffered a fall during a ride from which she never fully recovered, and died a year later on the 25th. April 1566 at the age of 66.\n\t\n\tIn accordance with Diane's wishes and to provide a resting place for her, her daughter completed the funeral chapel, built near the castle. \n\t\n\tDuring the French Revolution, her tomb was opened, her corpse desecrated, and her remains thrown into a mass grave. \n\t\n\tWhen French experts dug up her remains in 2009, they found high levels of gold in her hair. It is suggested that the &quot;drinkable gold&quot; that she reportedly regularly took, believed to preserve youth, may have ultimately killed her. In May 2010, Diane was re-buried in her original tomb in the Château d'Anet.",
