        "text": "Imagine if you could help educate girls in India just by watching a film. 'A Girl Can Touch the Sky' is a heart warming and insightful documentary that does just that, with the majority of proceeds from streaming going to the incredible charities featured in the film. The film explores the tensions between traditional and modern expectations for young women in rural India, seeking to understand the barriers facing girls in education and possibilities of how they might be overcome. The documentary has been officially selected for 14 International Film Festivals and won many awards including being nominated for a Royal Television Society Award. It's great to see the power of film being harnessed to tell such important stories and make a meaningful difference in people's lives. Congratulations to Ravinol Chambers of Be Inspired Films | Certified B Corp 2015 for completion of such an incredible and ambitious project. I highly recommend watching it over the weekend. #documentaryfilm #education #charity #bcorp #genderequality #india\n\nIt's a little known fact that the Wholegrain Digital website has a meditation timer on it. If you access the website when you don't have a working internet connection, like when traveling on the train, it will offer you the option to take a few moments to meditate instead. It's a little thing to try to promote better mental health in our increasingly digital world. Thanks to Built for Mars for including this feature recently as a UX Bite. #uxdesign #ux #mentalhealth #digitaldetox #meditation #easteregg\n\nIn recent times I've become fascinated with the Hopi and the more I learn about their history, beliefs, philosophy and culture, the more fascinated I become. At this pivotal time in world history, the Hopi quietly offer us wisdom that they have carried with them throughout their history to help humanity. I think we have a lot to learn from them and having visited Hopi earlier this year, I feel some duty to help share their message with the outside world. In this latest Substack post I share just a little of their fascinating cosmology and instructions for humanity, together with some reflections on how this relates to the world of work, business and sustainability. #indigenouswisdom #wisdom #sustainability #sustainablebusiness #peace #hopi #humanity #future\n\nI enjoyed this new Substack post from Jessica Böhme about why we always want more and how we can attempt to overcome our culture of infinite wants. \"our wanting has been misdirected. We have designed a world that caters to every want, based on the notion that unmet wants cause pain. And we should do everything to avoid pain. Yet, pain brings growth. When we... avoid pain by replacing challenging desires... with desires that can be easily and always fulfilled, like sugar and TV, we stop growing.\" So much food for thought. #sustainableliving #personalgrowth #personaldevelopment #happiness #purpose #consumption #motivation #sustainability\n\nThis morning I simultaneously got two calls. One from my Mum, stuck at Amsterdam Schipol airport due to today's plague of the infamous \"blue screen of death\" across major IT systems, and the other from a BBC journalist asking me for my take on the issue. Let's be honest, I'm more qualified to help my Mum find a hotel than to be a technical expert on this topic, but I did share some more philosophical thoughts that I'll post here as I think it ties in with the important topic covered in my book (https://lnkd.in/dbvNM6v) and the Sustainable Web Manifesto (https://lnkd.in/dmbRWA3) about digital resilience. \"The outage highlights the hidden level of dependency that our society has on digital technologies that provide many benefits but are also themselves a threat to social resilience, even in the case of those designed to protect us like cyber security systems.\" \"Developers and engineers often talk about the 'tech stack' behind their services but what we overlook is that the stack is in some cases a Jenga tower. It appears solid and stable but if you pull out the wrong brick it can bring down the entire tower.\" \"Businesses and governments sign up for services from tech providers without understanding what is in the Jenga tower that they are buying and what would happen if one of the layers failed.\" I don't think there's a simple solution to this but I think it's important that we look more deeply at our dependencies to ensure that the systems we depend on our truly resilient. #digitalsustainability #resilience #tech #cybersecurity #socialresilience"
