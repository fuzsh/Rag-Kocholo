        "text": "Diane von Furstenberg, a name synonymous with elegance, reinvention and resilience, finds herself once again in the spotlight with the Tribeca Festival premiering the documentary Diane von Furstenberg: Woman in Charge. Directed with a keen eye for the intricacies of an extraordinary life by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy and Trish Dalton, the film offers an intimate portrait of a woman who transformed not just fashion, but also the concept of feminine power and independence.\n\nThe film opens with von Furstenberg, now in her 70s, perched on the edge of a sink, both feet in, facing the mirror to apply makeup. This unconventional choice sets the tone for a documentary that does not shy away from von Furstenberg’s unrepentant embrace of her age. Her attraction to wrinkles, as she candidly shares, is a testament to her acceptance of every phase of life, and being true to herself.\n\nThe documentary delves into von Furstenberg’s early life, beginning with World War II. Born in Brussels to a Holocaust survivor, she was a “miracle baby.” Her mother, shaped by the traumas of war, instilled in the designer a sense of confidence from a young age. This tough love, while seemingly harsh, prepared her for a world that was anything but gentle. With her mother’s lessons in tow, von Furstenberg left the confines of Brussels to the liberating experience of boarding school, where her sexual fluidity in the 1960s led to her expulsion. This period of rebellion and self-discovery laid the foundation for a life characterized by bold choices and fearless exploration. She met and eventually married Egon von Furstenberg, a German prince, who introduced her to a world of wealth and privilege. As a middle class Jewish girl, von Furstenberg navigated this new world with an ease that surprised her.\n\nRELATED: Tribeca Festival 2024: Read All Of Deadline’s Movie Reviews\n\nVon Furstenberg’s foray into fashion began almost by accident. What started as a casual hobby quickly transformed into a full-fledged career after she showcased her clothing samples to fashion columnist Diana Vreeland. The whirlwind success that followed saw von Furstenberg juggling the roles of a businesswoman, wife and mother, a balancing act that took its toll — which the film chronicles showing her numerous lovers, her wild partying days, and her complex relationship with her children. Despite her success as a businesswoman, her personal life was marked by distance from her kids, a consequence of her relentless drive and socialite lifestyle.\n\nThe moment that transformed von Furstenberg’s career is her recollection of seeing Richard Nixon’s daughter in a simple yet elegant top and skirt combo, inspiring her to create the now-legendary wrap dress. This affordable and stylish garment became a status symbol, empowering countless women during a pivotal era for women’s rights and entry into the workforce. The wrap dress’ significance in the 1970s cannot be overstated, as it embodied the newfound voice of women and fashion during that time. Despite moments where she considered abandoning her fashion career, von Furstenberg’s resilience saw her through. The late ’90s resurgence of her signature designs after being embraced by the influencer generation revitalized the DVF brand for the modern era.\n\nThrough archival footage and meticulous research, there is a lot to learn from and about von Furstenberg with her unique style of personal connection to the people around her, and the refusal to ever see herself as a victim. Personal anecdotes provide a rich tapestry of her journey. Her unapologetic attitude and fierce independence are central themes throughout the documentary, with testimonials from friends and admirers such as Oprah Winfrey, Marc Jacobs, Anderson Cooper, Gloria Steinem, Hillary Clinton and Fran Lebowitz, and more. While the film could benefit from a tighter edit to maintain its pacing, it nonetheless offers a wealth of insight into von Furstenberg’s enduring legacy.\n\nDiane von Furstenberg: Woman in Charge is a celebration of life. It captures the designer’s ongoing journey of self-discovery and reinforces her belief that there is always more to accomplish, and that life should be lived to its fullest. This film is a fitting tribute to a woman who has never ceased to inspire, innovate, champion women’s causes, and live by her mantra “see the woman, not the dress.”"
