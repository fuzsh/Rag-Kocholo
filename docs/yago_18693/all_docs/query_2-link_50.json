        "text": "OBITUARY FOR RICHARD LEON ERICKSON\n\nRichard Leon Erickson died on August 20, 2023. His bright light and spirit passed on at the age of 64. Richard was born January 19, 1959, in Baker, Oregon to Donis Leon Erickson and Janet Waldron Erickson. He is the sibling to Cindy (Raymond) Rounds, Randy Erickson, John Eric (Debbie) Erickson, Lance Charles Erickson (deceased), Sonya Erickson, Anthony (Trisha) Erickson, Russell (Antoinette) Erickson, and Katrina Erickson. The family moved to Ogden, Utah where Richard graduated from Ogden High School in 1977. He was a lifeguard at the Ogden High swimming pool, which gave him money and time to date, fix cars, and ski until he left to serve in the Aspen/Denver, Colorado Mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in 1979.\n\nRichard loved life, good rock and roll, rice crispy treats, original Coca-Cola (with sugar), and creating wonderful pieces of art. His goal was to be an architect or an artist and illustrator. Throughout Richard’s secondary school years, he was fortunate to have excellent art teachers who mentored and encouraged him to expand his gifts. He began his undergraduate studies at Weber State College. While there, he met his future wife, Diane Koster, under the Weber State bell tower, where she purchased his used schoolbook and stole his heart.\n\nThey were sealed together for time and all eternity in the Salt Lake Temple in 1982. Richard continued to pursue his interest in the study of fine arts while their family grew. He relished learning about the “Old Masters” of the art world, studied under Arnold Friberg, and was fascinated by variations in the trends of modern artists. He graduated from the University of Utah with a Bachelor of Fine Arts.\n\nRichard had been a loyal Utah Utes supporter and was an esteemed guest lecturer for the design and illustration classes taught at local universities where he inspired many future artists. Richard’s integrity, kind nature, and patience brought him into the service of teaching and executive positions within his church. He worked for Deseret Book for many years, eventually becoming the Senior Art Director where he led a dedicated team of designers and illustrators. His keen eye and committed leadership made a remarkable contribution to the company. Richard’s work includes countless bestsellers, many of which have won national awards and reached markets worldwide.\n\nRichard was always genuine, quick to smile, and ready to share full-hearted laughter. He consistently showed his devotion to family. His love for the beauty of God’s masterful palette and creations was present in the efforts he and Diane made to beautify their home in Bountiful, Utah. We will miss his stories of adventure with his children, fly-fishing on a pristine river, and the joy of interacting with his grandchildren.\n\nOBITUARY FOR DIANE KOSTER ERICKSON\n\nOn August 25th, 2023, Diane Koster Erickson, the “Queen Bee,” was returned to heavenly gardens at the age of 62. Diane was born June 4, 1961, to Robert Daniel Koster and Betty Sundberg. She was the youngest of six siblings: Kathy (Rick) Irwin, Bruce (Verlynn) Koster, Becky (Randell) Zaugg, Paula Jo (Kim) Cannon, and John (Debbie) Koster. Their family was later joined by stepmother Florence Koster, stepbrother Clifford (Kristel) Law, and stepsister Debbie (Ron) Opp.\n\nDiane’s family lived in Sunset, Utah and she graduated from Clearfield High School with the class of 1979. She attended Weber State College for three years, during which time she met and fell in love with Richard L. Erickson. They were sealed for time and all eternity in the Salt Lake Temple in 1982 and added three children to their family in the years that followed.\n\nFor many years, Diane stayed home to raise their beautiful family. Their home was filled with music, laughter, and the comforting smells of freshly baked pumpkin chocolate chip cookies. She taught her children to work hard, “bee” kind, and to always “bee” good. Diane would throw herself headfirst into anything she wanted to learn, becoming an expert in it. Cross stitch, books, gardening, quilting, massage, and astronomy were just a few of her many interests and passions. In 1998, Diane received a certification as an Advanced Master Gardener from Utah State University. She trained for seven years under the late Peter Lassig learning garden design and worked at the world-famous Temple Square Gardens. Diane designed the prairie garden on the Conference Center roof in Salt Lake City, served as the director of “Garden Talks in the Park,” and co-authored the book Temple Square Gardening (2002).\n\nDiane was also an avid quilter and worked for eight years at Quilter's Haven designing quilts and quilt patterns. She wrapped countless loved ones and friends in warmth with over 400 quilted masterpieces.\n\nIn 2012, Diane fulfilled a life-long dream and attended the Utah College of Massage Therapy to become a Licensed Massage Therapist. Diane had a thriving private practice, Honey Bee Therapeutic Massage, where she soothed aches and brought healing with her touch.\n\nDiane lived with an open hand, sharing all her love by serving others, even complete strangers. She was constantly working on a quilt to bring joy to another. She relished in entertaining friends and loved ones in her garden oasis. Diane consistently encouraged those around her to marvel at the beautiful world that God had created for her by sharing her knowledge of plants, animals, and the heavens above.\n\nTHEIR LIFE TOGETHER\n\nRichard and Diane were as together in their life as they were in their deaths. Together they raised three children: Robert (Emily) Erickson, Melissa Erickson (DJ Gray), and Michael (Megan) Erickson. They were rewarded with nine grandchildren: Ethan, Jackson, Isaac, Lydia, Ira, Lily (deceased), George, Cynthia, and Maryella, with a tenth grandbaby on the way.\n\nRichard’s favorite job was as “Paga,” an attentive and fun grandfather. Diane was the world’s best “Nana,” always providing back rubs and love to anyone within reach. Together they shared their love for their family with parties, visits, and thoughtful gifts.\n\nWhile Diane studied family history, she learned that her ancestors were attacked by Viking raiders from Scandinavia, which was Richard’s ancestry. From that point on Diane called Richard her Viking and she was his mermaid. Their love was shown through songs, dancing, love notes, cute texts, and romantic getaways. Richard and Diane were repeatedly invited to teach marriage and family relationship classes to members of their community. Friends and family have often commented that they admired and envied the close bond and passionate love Richard and Diane shared. Their relationship is an example to all of patience, kindness, and happiness.\n\nRichard and Diane worked together to design and build a grand oasis in their garden where both people and animals would happily spend their time. Their home was a respite from the challenges and trials of the world. One could always count on aromatherapy, chocolate, healing conversation, and overwhelming love within their four walls.\n\nThey are preceded in death by Robert Koster and Betty Sundberg (Diane’s parents), Florence Koster (Diane’s stepmother), Lance Erickson (Richard’s younger brother), Lily Clark (granddaughter), and numerous lost pregnancies (grandchildren).\n\nRichard and Diane are survived by the family listed in their obituaries above.\n\nThe family would like to thank the attentive physicians, nurses, and other caregivers of St. Mark's Hospital ICU who tenderly cared for each member of the family during Diane’s hospitalization.\n\nThe family would also encourage anyone struggling with mental health challenges to seek help from a trusted friend or professional. Please call 988 if you feel that all may be lost. You are not alone and there is help waiting for you.\n\nThe day of remembrance for Richard and Diane is Friday, September 8th, 2023.\n\nReception 3:30-5:30 p.m.\n\nFuneral Program at 6:00 p.m.\n\nLocated at the Orchard Stake Center, 3599 S Orchard Dr, Bountiful, UT 84010.\n\nLive stream @ https://youtube.com/@orchard6thward971?si=C4hrEDwmGTusNLjd\n\nDonations can be made to the Richard and Diane Erickson Memorial account at America First Credit Union, account # 9127705. Donations may also be sent by Venmo to @r7erickson.\n\nTo Richard and Diane, who we all love and miss, “Have fun storming the castle!”"
