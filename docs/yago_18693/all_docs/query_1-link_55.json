        "text": "On Saturday, July 2, 2016, Jackie OâSullivan and Peter Carter suddenly lost their eight-year-old son George Peter Carter to a freak accident.\n\nGeorge was an intelligent young person. Unafraid to share his knowledge, he could tell you the difference between various animals and list their predators. Full of imagination, he could use the same straw or coffee stirrer for a different toy each week. He was always willing to help anyone and everyone, and would often be found planting something in the garden or working in the barn. He loved going to fairs helping with the cattle and playing with fiends. George also enjoyed going to the park and taking part in varous programs at the Nevins Memorial Library. To know him was to love him, as in evidence from the following messages written by the friends he made at fairs:\n\nDear George, I hope you know that there will always be something missing at the fairs. You won't be searching for me, I won't be seeing you at the state show, I won't have you helping me brush down a calf, and I won't be able to play with your trucks. An amazing young boy was taken much too soon. You will truly ALWAYS be loved and missed. Deana Gould\n\nGeorge, Heaven needed another angel today. We lost a wonderful little boy, but God has bigger plans for you. You are so loved, George, and will be missed so much. We don't know why God takes back what he lends us when he does. Heartbroken as we are, may you play in the fields of heaven and show in the show ring alongside Keely Walsh. Rest in peace, little George. Gail Leclaire\n\nI'll always love you, George. Iâll never forget watching you play around with the cows. You loved them so much. You were always a strong boy. Fly high, little buddy. I'll never forget you. Samantha Bertrand\n\nGeorge is survived by his sister Bellah; father Peter; mother Jackie; grandparents Charles and Carol Carter, and Kerry Anderson; and several aunts, uncles, and cousins.\n\nRelatives and friends are kindly invited to attend his Funeral Mass of the Angels on Friday, July 8th at 11AM in St. Mary's Church, Georgetown.
