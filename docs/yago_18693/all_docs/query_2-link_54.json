She has her Ph.D. in Educational Policy and Leadership from Ohio State and an M.Ed. in Counselor Education from Penn State. In 2004, Andrea returned to Penn State as director of Student Affairs Research and Assessment, became assistant vice president in 2009, was promoted to associate vice president in 2017, and began the interim vice president role in February 2023. She assumed the vice president role in May 2024. As the University's chief Student Affairs officer, she has oversight for the senior administrators, over 500 full-time staff and 28 administrative departments in Student Affairs. She serves on numerous committees at Penn State including the President’s Council.\n\nAs Assistant Vice President for diversity, equity and inclusion in Student Affairs, Brian is responsible for strengthening and furthering a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming environment for all students at Penn State. He provides strategic leadership for six Student Affairs units.\n\nThroughout his career in higher education, Brian has worked to build educational opportunities around issues of student advocacy and development and a diversity of thought and human experience. While at Penn State he has worked to broaden the understanding of diversity and commitment to inclusive excellence not as separate entities, but rather as part of the larger tapestry of student life and experience.\n\nBrian served as the assistant director of the Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity from 2008-2012. Prior to returning to Penn State as the center’s director, he served as an associate dean of students at Cornell University focused on student support, sexual violence, and advocacy while also directing Cornell’s LGBT Resource Center and co-directing the Center for Intercultural Dialogue. Before joining Cornell, Brian was the founding director of the Office of LGBTQ Services and deputy Title IX officer at Dickinson College.\n\nBrian received his master’s degree in higher education from Penn State and his bachelor’s degree in counseling and human services from the University of Scranton. He lives in State College with his husband Greg, their twins Declyn and Keegyn, and their two dogs.\n\nServing as assistant vice president (AVP) for Student Affairs since 2017, Danny Shaha supervises various essential offices in Student Affairs. He also cochairs the University's Behavioral Threat Management Team and leads Student Affairs’ efforts related to free speech, emergency management, and crisis response. During his first year as AVP, he served as the University’s Title IX Coordinator.\n\nPreviously, Shaha served as the senior director of the Office of Student Conduct (OSC) at Penn State for seven years. In this role, he oversaw the administration of the University’s conduct process at its primary campus in University Park, PA, as well as its 23 additional campuses across the Commonwealth and online, with a total enrollment of 96,000+ students.\n\nWhile serving as senior director of OSC, from January of 2012 to July of 2017, he served as a Deputy Title IX Coordinator at the University and helped to institute and formalize a comprehensive education, response, and prevention program. From November of 2015 to July of 2017, Shaha served as the interim director of the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life, working with staff to advise four councils that governed over 80 chapters with a membership of approximately 7,500 students.\n\nPrior to joining Penn State, Shaha worked in different capacities at The Ohio State University, Texas A&M University, and the College of William and Mary. He also served as a Special Agent in the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 2001 to 2004.\n\nStephanie is an alum of Penn State's College of Health and Human Development (2004) where she earned her Bachelor's degree in Children, Youth and Family Services and is a current graduate student in the Masters of Public Policy program in the College of the Liberal Arts. After 11 years in the private, non-profit sector, providing services to under-served and low-income families, Stephanie's path led her to Penn State. She has been at Penn State serving in Administrative Support roles since September 2015 and in Student Affairs since November 2017.\n\nIn her free time, Stephanie enjoys spending time with her partner, Ben and their two cats, Suki and Oliver. She has two adult children, Kaitlyn and Milo/Nova, who have flown the nest but with whom she enjoys spending time playing Mario Kart or D&D online and visiting when she can. She also enjoys reading, cooking/baking, being outdoors, running, dancing, and shopping. Stephanie feels privileged to provide support for the overall Student Affairs DEI efforts of the University and is part of the onboarding committee. She loves being a part of the Student Affairs team as they continue to be a leader in providing services and support to the all students in the community at Penn State."
