        "text": "On the morning of July 26th, Dianna Annis gracefully and courageously passed into the presence of the Lord Jesus, whom she loved dearly and served passionately and unceasingly since childhood. She lived tirelessly for Him and there was seldom a moment when He did not figure into her decisions and manner of life. She was a glowing example of all it means to \"seek ye first the kingdom of heaven and His righteousness\" and because of that \"all these things\" (and there were a great many of them) \"were added unto her.\"\n\nShe was married to Richard for over 42 of the happiest years of his life and never did not make him feel loved, appreciated and respected. Together they endured many things, including the rigors of nursing school for her and optometry school for him. She worked many happy years at Holland Hospital, where she made many steadfast friends and created many lasting memories.\n\nAlong the way were born Rick, Kevin and Kyle, now fine young men who married spouses, Samantha, Amanda and Kristina, who were prayed for while they were still children and before they even met their future husbands. She was also blessed with two grandchildren, Melanie and Aaron, who had the ability to light up her life and make her day special whenever they were around. For a brief time, she leaves these all behind.\n\nShe also temporarily leaves behind her mother, Kathy Belk, with whom she spent untold hours on the road and in caring for her household of foster and adopted children, and brothers Melvin (with Jeannie) and Kevin (with Karol) Belk and sister Kathy (with Greg) Wixom. All made, and continued to make, important contributions toward whom she became as an adult.\n\nAfter husband Richard came on the scene, Dianna quickly gained the admiration of her new in-laws, Richard and Marian Annis, who often decided it was preferable to speak with her instead of their son whenever they called the house.\n\nAll who knew Dianna were touched by her unfailing kindness and thoughtfulness and there was seldom a time when that was not on full display. Besides a huge and irreparable hole which can never be filled, she leaves behind a selfless legacy of putting others first.\n\nShe was spontaneous and always keen for a spur-of-the-moment adventure, to the constant consternation of her plodding, planning husband. She was able to assess people and situations with a keen and witty perspective that few have ever owned. And her perpetual good humor and sense of humor will be completely and sorely missed.\n\nShe loved to be outside in the sunshine and nothing made her happier than sharing time with family or friends. She loved the beauty and serenity of exploring the outdoors in kayaks, on bikes or on foot and spent many delightful hours in her little garden, which seemed to provide more sustenance for the wildlife than it ever did for the family.\n\nOf all who have been left behind, we know that each one who is trusting in the amazing, saving grace of the Lord Jesus will someday be present with her again at a reunion which will be far beyond any ever held on this earth, when hugs and kisses will be exchanged in the presence of the One who has made such a happy reunion possible. How we look forward to that wonderful day!\n\nThe family will receive visitors on Friday July 30, from 5:00pm to 8:00pm, at the Dykstra Funeral Home - Mulder Chapel, 188 West 32nd Street, Holland, MI. A funeral ceremony will be held on Saturday July 31, at 11:00am, at Cultivate Community Church, 4872 136th Avenue, Hamilton, MI. Pastor Cory Potter will preside over the service. Interment will be in Hamilton Riverside Cemetery.\n\nProfessional service entrusted to the Mulder Chapel."
