        "text": "British-Spanish actress (born 2005)\n\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is Keen and the second or maternal family name is Fernández.\n\nDafne Keen Fernández (born 4 January 2005) is a British-Spanish actress.[2] Born in Madrid, Keen made her debut as a child on the series The Refugees (2015). Her breakthrough role was Laura in the superhero film Logan (2017), which won her several accolades. She starred as Lyra Belacqua in the television series His Dark Materials (2019–2022) and Jecki Lon in the Star Wars series The Acolyte (2024), and reprised the role of Laura in Marvel's Deadpool & Wolverine (2024).\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nKeen was born in Madrid.[3] Her parents are English actor Will Keen, and Spanish actress and director María Fernández Ache.[4][5] Her paternal great-grandfather was Edward Curzon, 6th Earl Howe.[6][7] Her aunts are poet Alice Oswald and writer Laura Beatty.[8][9]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nKeen made her acting debut in 2015 at the age of 10, on the BBC television series The Refugees, where she starred alongside her father Will.[10][11] The show ran from 2014 to 2015, ending after one season.\n\nKeen was next cast in James Mangold's superhero film Logan as Laura, the child clone of Wolverine, played by Hugh Jackman.[12][13][14] Casting director Priscilla John endorsed Keen for the role, saying that \"She had an innocence and a vulnerability... people are going to fall in love with her.\"[15][16] The film was released in 2017 to commercial and critical success, and is ranked among the best superhero movies of all time.[17][18] Writing for Vanity Fair, Lisa Liebman called Keen \"extraordinary\" and \"memorable not only for her slice-and-dice adamantium-claw action scenes but also for her ability to convey the young heroine’s feral yet innocent nature.\"[15] Tasha Robinson of The Verge said Keen's \"indomitability and ferocious energy go a long way toward keeping the film from wallowing in its own misery.\"[19] Keen won the Empire Award for Best Newcomer, and nominations from the Critics' Choice Movie Awards, Chicago Film Critics Association, and Saturn Awards,[20][21][22] among other accolades.\n\nIn 2018, Keen was cast as Lyra Belacqua in the BBC/HBO series His Dark Materials, an adaptation of the book trilogy of the same name.[23] To prepare for the role, Keen \"religiously\" read the books in her first two weeks on set.[24][25] Her father Will stars with her, playing Hugh MacPhail.[26] The series ran from 2019 to 2022.[27][28] Keen remarked to W that \"I've grown up on the show. It's really hitting me now.\"[29] On her portrayal, The Hollywood Reporter's Daniel Fienberg called Keen \"star-studded\"[30] and Allison Shoemaker for RogerEbert.com said she was \"excellent (and perfectly cast)\".[31] Keen was nominated for the British Academy Cymru for Best Actress in 2020.[32]\n\nKeen next starred alongside Andy García in Charles McDougall's comedy-drama film Ana. She worked on the film immediately after Logan in 2017,[33][34] and after a series of delays, it was released in 2020.[35] The film received mixed reviews, although Amari Allah of Wherever I Look praised Keen's \"charisma and presence\" and compared her to a younger Natalie Portman.[36][37]\n\nIn 2022, Keen joined the cast of Leslye Headland's Star Wars series The Acolyte.[38][39] Headland created the character for Keen after seeing her performance in Logan.[40] Keen got into character by listening to David Bowie and joked with Headland that her character also looked like the musician.[41] The series premiered on Disney+ in 2024 and was subject to review bombing campaigns.[42] Also in 2024, with a surprise announcement, Keen reprised her role as Laura in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Deadpool & Wolverine, reuniting with Jackman.[43][44] It became Keen's highest-grossing release and the second-highest-grossing film of 2024.[45]\n\nKeen will star in the upcoming horror film Whistle, directed by Corin Hardy.[46] She will also star in Jay Hernandez's directorial debut Night Comes.[47]\n\nArtistry\n\n[edit]\n\nIn interviews with British Vogue and The Untitled Magazine, Keen cited Gena Rowlands, Meryl Streep, Olivia Colman, Jennifer Lawrence, and Timothée Chalamet as influences. Her favorite films include the musicals Singin' in the Rain (1952), Oklahoma! (1955) and West Side Story (1961), the comedies Some Like It Hot (1959) and Daddy's Home (2015), and the dramas A Woman Under the Influence (1974), Opening Night (1977) and In the Mood for Love (2000).[48][49][50]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nKey † Denotes films that have not yet been released\n\nList of film roles Year Title Role Notes Ref. 2017 Logan Laura / X-23 [12] 2020 Ana Ana [34] 2024 Deadpool & Wolverine Laura / X-23 [44] TBA Whistle † TBA Post-production [46] Night Comes † TBA In production [47]\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nList of television appearances and roles Year Title Role Notes Ref. 2015 The Refugees Ana \"Ani\" Cruz Oliver Main role [11] 2019–2022 His Dark Materials Lyra Belacqua Lead role [23] 2024 The Acolyte Jecki Lon Main role [38]\n\nPodcast\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Battersea Poltergeist (2021)[51]\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nList of awards and nominations received by Dafne Keen Award Year[a] Category Nominated work Result Ref.
