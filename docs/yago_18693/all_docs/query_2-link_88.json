But for a more ancient perspective take a look at the tale of Robin Hood and Maid Marian.\n\nByron - Poet, Letter Writer and Lover\n\nTake a Valentine's stroll around Newstead Abbey and there's a good chance you'll be inspired to write a verse.\n\nLord Byron's romantic poems have certainly stood the test of time.\n\nHis interpretation of Don Juan is often thought to be a reflection of his varied love life.\n\nLady Caroline Lamb, Lady Oxford, Augusta Leigh and Lady Frances Webster are but four ladies with whom he is alleged to have been closely related.\n\nAnnabella Milbanke became his wife and bore him a daughter. But the marriage didn't last and Byron left the British Isles never to return. His time abroad resulted in more romances and illegitimate children. Don Juan indeed.\n\nLady Chatterley and all things naughty\n\nWho would have thought Eastwood could have produced something as steamy as Lady Chatterley's romance with Mellors.\n\nBut the town's most famous son, DH Lawrence, wasn't content to produce one couple so willing to perform in public (or at least between the pages of a paperback).\n\nIn The Rainbow and Sons and Lovers more complicated relationships were developed. Two of the central characters in The Rainbow reappeared in Women In Love.\n\nLawrence explored the romantic ups and the downs of Ursula and Gudrun Brangwen. While Ursula found love with Rupert Birkin, her sister's relationship with industrialist Gerald Crich was far less satisfactory.\n\nLusty weekends\n\nDH influenced many people including writers from Nottinghamshire. So it's no surprise to find the lusty Arthur Seaton appearing in Alan Sillitoe's Saturday Night and Sunday Morning.\n\nIn both novel and film Seaton's deeds shocked many a reader/viewer. His dalliance with married neighbour Brenda caused quite a stir at the time, not least because Brenda enjoyed the lovemaking just as much as young Arthur.\n\nDon't step into the shower\n\nStrange as it may seem, one true Nottingham romance concerns the master of suspense - film director Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nHe might have referred to actors as cattle but I'm sure he never called his wife Alma a cow! The connection? Alma Hitchcock was born in Nottingham and played a major role in many of Hitch's finest works - even Psycho!\n\nLoveable sports personalities\n\nNotts has a strong love with sporting personalities.\n\nYou can't get away from the fans love of former Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough or former Reds defender Stuart \"Psycho\" Pearce.\n\nOld big 'ed Brian Clough is almost as famous as Robin Hood. And like the famous outlaw, Brian and Stuart are loved and hated across the county. The reason is simple. For every Forest fan who holds them up as gods, there are probably just as many Notts County and Mansfield supporters who could never bring themselves to admit they were any good!\n\nLove on thin ice\n\nLove, of course, doesn't always run smoothly. Sadly for fans of Nottingham ice skaters Torvill and Dean, it never ran at all.\n\nThe world, it seemed, desperately wanted the Olympic gold medallists to become an item. But Jayne and Chris never got it together. They both found love - but not with each other.\n\nFor the good folk of Nottinghamshire it's a romance they can only dream about.\n\nTell us about your Notts romance\n\nHas love blossomed for you in Nottinghamshire? Is this the county where you first met your sweetheart? If you would like your story to feature on this page then tell us your story."
