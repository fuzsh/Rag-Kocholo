        "text": "Ann Carlin Thompson DeGuerin died on October 11, 2023, on her own terms and surrounded by family and friends at the home of her beloved sister Kay Thompson Pizzitola. She was born on March 29, 1941 to Dow Carl Thompson and Loleat Linam Thompson in Robstown, TX. She grew up with her younger sister, Kay Thompson Pizzitola in Robstown, TX and graduated from Robstown High School. In 1961 the family moved to Houston for Carl’s job. It was in Houston that she later met and married Dick DeGuerin in 1970. They had a daughter, Ann Carlin DeGuerin Miller, and she became a second mother to Dick’s daughter Anna Michele DeGuerin Luke, a role she cherished for the rest of her life, even after their divorce.\n\nAnnie was the embodiment of unconditional love and acceptance which applied to family and friends alike. She loved fiercely and lived bravely, proving to all who knew her that tough could also be beautiful and that having a bad day was no excuse to forget your lipstick. She was a lover of art, nature, animals, and books – mysteries most of all – and could debate politics with the best of them.\n\nAnnie was fiercely independent and determined to support her daughter as a single working mother and lived many lives. If there was one word to describe her it would be Glamourous. She brought a touch of glamour to everything she did from her immaculate taste in decorating, working for David Sutherland Showrooms; to her eye for beautiful jewelry as a buyer for Tootsie’s department store, and finally to her near-miraculous knack for gardening and design, first as the owner of The Garden Store, a gardening and lifestyle boutique, and then with the firm Thompson + Hansen, where she realized her true passion for gardening and landscape design, working there until she retired in 2015.\n\nShe is survived by her daughters Carlin DeGuerin Miller, and her husband Stuart, and Michele DeGuerin Luke and her husband Robert; her beloved grandchildren Yael and Harris Miller and Eli and Rowan Luke; her sister Kay Thompson Pizzitola and her husband Michael Jerome Pizzitola; her niece Margaret Thurmond and her husband Matt and their children Luke and Madeline Loleat. Annie also had a large extended family whom she treasured, including Gayle DeGeurin and her husband Mike; and their children Michael DeGeurin and his wife Ginger and their children Hannah and Charles; Katherine Houston and her husband Eric and their children Geurin, Reid and Ross; Laura Robertson and her husband William and their children Gayle, Keen and Kaki; Dick DeGuerin and his wife Janie and their daughters Lori and Kayla; dear friends Michael Dale and his partner Robert; Beverly Jacomini and her husband Tommy; and Cindy Howze as well as Diane Whitworth and her husband Eddie and Dick Dunavan and his wife Stacy.\n\nA memorial service will be held at a later date. In lieu of flowers please consider a donation to the ASPCA or The Houston Audubon Society."
