        "text": "Scroll down for more\n\n★★★★★\n\n\"Diane listed our home and we were both so impressed with her professionalism. She far exceeded what we thought listing a home entailed. Diane was so conscientious getting the house ready in order for it to show at it's best. Diane also had great communication skills, keeping us informed every step of the way and explaining things we didn't understand. We feel so lucky to have had Diane as our listing agent and had it not been for moving out of her area, we would have loved the opportunity to work with her on our purchasing end. Diane is a true professional in every sense of the word.\"\n\n★★★★★\n\n\"Diane is a true real estate professional. She has a seasoned understanding of the housing market, what buyers are looking for, and does a great job defining who are serious and qualified buyers. I've several homes over the years but have never seen an agent chase down and qualify leads the way she did. I knew from the moment I first discussed selling my home with her, that I was in great hands. I could not be happier with the results. Would absolutely hire Diane again as my agent and would highly recommend her to anyone looking to sell their home\"\n\n★★★★★\n\n\"Hire an expert early on and listen. Diane was a tremendous help from the time we started the process to sell our home through the close. She was always well prepared, She gave knowledgable advice as we prepared the house to sell. We were very pleased and impressed by how Diane marketed the house. We would definitely use Diane again an can highly recommend her.\"\n\n★★★★★\n\n\"Diane Kneis is a strong advocate for her clients. When it came time for us to sell our Redwood City family home, of close to 30 years, we thankfully chose to ask Diane to represent us in the sale. Diane listened to our hopes and concerns and deftly managed our expectations. We never felt out of the information loop during the sale process due to Diane’s keen communication skills. Our home in 6 days for well over asking. Diane is a consummate professional and we strongly recommend her to anyone who needs supportive representation in selling your home.\"\n\n★★★★★\n\n\"Diane was amazing! We didn't even know when we picked her as our realtor. But now she is like family. Selling the home I grew up in was emotional and stressful. Diane was with us the whole way. I trusted her during the process. She was very sensitive to our needs. Our house in 5 days, over asking and she negotiated the best terms. I would highly recommend Diane..\"/b>"
