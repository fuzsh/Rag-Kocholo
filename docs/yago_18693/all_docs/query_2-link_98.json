        "text": "The announcement came as a surprise, recalled Diane Bell, former city columnist for The San Diego Union-Tribune newspaper.\n\nAfter 48 years at the U-T, including 28 of those years as the page B-1 columnist, Bell said she was faced with a “momentous decision.”\n\nIn July of this year, it was announced that Los Angeles billionaire Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong had sold the U-T to an affiliate of the MediaNews Group, owned by Alden Global Capital, which owns roughly 200 publications, including the Chicago Tribune.\n\n“The new owner immediately made a buyout proposal to the entire staff,” Bell told Times of San Diego. “We were given about a week to make a decision with the final employment date of Friday, July 21, for most jobs. It was a dizzying rate of speed for such a momentous decision.”\n\nAfter a career that included more than 4,000 columns, she took the buyout.\n\n“The first thing I did with my free time was schedule a manicure and pedicure,” Bell said. “And, I signed-up for Pilates classes.”\n\nBell also has time to attend the San Diego Press Club’s 50th annual Excellence in Journalism awards on Tuesday, Oct. 3 in Balboa Park. At the event, she will be presented with the Harold Keen Award, which is given to a journalist who has gone above and beyond for the sake of fairness and truth telling.\n\n“I am both thrilled and deeply honored to receive an award named after Harold Keen,” Bell said.\n\nKeen, who anchored San Diego’s first television news broadcast in 1949, is often described as the dean of San Diego journalists. Keen arrived in San Diego in 1936 as a reporter for The San Diego Sun. He later worked for the San Diego Union, San Diego Magazine and KFMB-TV Channel 8. He passed away in 1981.\n\nSince leaving the paper, Bell said, “I’ve received many, many notes, emails, calls and contacts through social media. When I’m out in the community, readers regularly come up to thank me for my many years of column writing. It is a warm, wonderful feeling to know that my stories have made an impact.”\n\nDuring her final week at the U-T, Bell wrote her good-bye column.\n\n“I am saying farewell to the many local readers who have become my friends, my confidants and my sounding board over the years. It is with a leaden heart that I write my last official column 28 years after my debut on May 2, 1995, as The San Diego Union-Tribune city columnist,” she wrote.\n\nBell’s 1,700-word column included her career-long memories of interviews with celebrities, once-in-a-lifetime experiences (including piloting a Navy nuclear submarine) and news stories about ordinary folk turned local heroes.\n\n“The unforgettable gift San Diego has given me over the years is my interaction with famous, infamous and every day folks who make up the fiber of the region,” she wrote in her final column. “I publicized many deeds of kindness and spur-of-the moment acts of heroism as I chronicled the daily scene, always trying to define what makes San Diego tick.\n\n“As a journalist, I’ve been an editorial writer, opinion page editor, president of the national Association of Opinion Page Editors, features section editor, consumer columnist and more. I’ve occupied a catbird seat watching San Diego grow from a lazy beach-side oasis with a reputation as a Navy town to a thriving center of high tech, biotech and innovation.”\n\nBell’s final column drew emotional responses from readers, she said.\n\n“I knew one day I would be faced with writing a farewell column, and I always vowed to start a `final column’ file, but I never did,” Bell wrote to Times of San Diego in an email. “I had planned to retire in a year or so, but when the buyout offer came so suddenly, there was less than a week to prepare, and I was still writing my regular column. So, my rearview mirror glimpse was really a stream of consciousness prepared in a couple of days without the benefit of time to labor over the content.\n\n“My deadline training apparently paid off because people seemed appreciative. Some said they shed tears; others noted that they thought they knew me but had no idea of some of the things I had done, such as tracking mountain gorillas in Uganda. One reader texted me that he only subscribed to the paper for my column and the crossword puzzles. And more than one thought my final column was the best I’d ever written. My farewell column was heartfelt, but admittedly it is challenging to try to capture more than four decades of journalism in 45 inches of type.”\n\nBell’s family includes husband Roy (they’ve been married 33 years this month) and three teenagers, including Brad, 19, and twins, Cassie and Chase, 15. After Bell left the paper, the family took a 12-day trip to Italy.\n\n“The trip was planned before the Union-Tribune was sold, but it was a wonderful way to shift gears and relax. We hadn’t had a getaway outside the U.S. or Mexico since before the pandemic,” Bell said.\n\n“My husband and I became parents later in life. Our oldest child is in college, but two others are high school juniors just embarking on college exam prep and campus visits. I want to share time with them without the distraction of work.”\n\nBell admits she has received new job offers over the past two months.\n\n“Several people have suggested I write a blog or put together a book drawn from my San Diego columns. That is in the back of my mind. Many of the topics are timeless,” she said.\n\n“But for now, I’m taking a break and not entertaining any (job) offers. Maybe down the line, I will change my mind. I truly want to savor my time with family before my twins head off to college in less than two years and my husband and I become empty-nesters.”\n\nAnd, what do the teenagers think about having mom now at home all the time? “They love having a built-in Uber drive,” Bell quipped.\n\nAt the Press Club’s awards event, Bell will be one of two recipients of career achievement awards. Georgeanne Irvine, who has worked for 45 years at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, will receive the Andy Mace Award for career achievements in public relations.\n\nCurrently the director of publishing, Irvine’s other roles at the Zoo have included public relations and spokesperson, along with marketing and philanthropy. She also has authored 30 children’s books.\n\nThe PR award is named after Andy Mace, former public relations manager at Pacific Telephone in San Diego. In 1971, Mace is credited with the idea of starting the San Diego Press Club. He later started his own PR consultancy, called Andy Mace & Associates, with an office at the Mission Valley’s Stardust Hotel & Country Club, now the Handlery Hotel. He passed away in 2009 at age 88.\n\nThe Press Club awards event is open to the public. More than 400 people are expected to attend. Admission cost is $60 for members, $75 for nonmembers and $60 for students. A table of 10 (regardless of membership status) is available for $600.
