        "text": "A woman from Cornwall who’s living with a brain tumour has been invited to take over a slot on a local radio station on 17 August.\n\nEllen Yates, 67, chatted to the presenters at Rewind Radio when she accompanied her husband Kev to the studio to collect a prize he had won in one of their competitions.\n\nAs a result, they invited her to guest host their Saturday Morning Takeover slot to raise awareness of brain tumours. She’ll be choosing 20 tracks to play from the 80s, 90s and noughties that all mean something to her.\n\nJoining the brain tumour community\n\nFirst symptoms\n\nEllen first thought something was wrong when she started being more clumsy than usual and was falling over more often. She had hearing loss in her left ear that was affecting her balance.\n\n“I would black out sometimes and felt like I was looking through fog. I used to joke that I’d feel normal if I could cut off the top of my head. And I’d say ‘if I fall over, just walk over me!’”\n\nOn 29 December 2014, Ellen felt fine when she went to bed but woke with raging earache.\n\nShe staggered to the bathroom and, looking in the mirror, thought that her had drooped. But Kev checked that she could raise both hands above her head so they knew it wasn’t a stroke.\n\nBenign is not fine\n\nEllen said: “The doctor told me I had an ear infection and it was causing vertigo. I kept going back to the doctors and was treated with the Epley Manoeuvre, a procedure that can help some kinds of vertigo. You have to stay upright for 48 hours afterwards. But it didn’t help and I couldn’t sleep for two weeks.\n\n“I kept going back to the doctors and in March, I was referred for a scan. I was diagnosed with a low-grade acoustic neuroma on 20 April. My doctor said I was the first person he had seen with one of these.\n\nWhen Ellen tried to find support and information, she could only find a Facebook group that was based in the USA. Then she set up her own – the South West Brain Tumour Friendship Group and has since joined The Brain Tumour Charity’s Facebook groups.\n\nThe Twilight Walk\n\nEllen said: “A few years ago I was interviewed on the radio and a man heard me and said to his partner, ‘that sounds like your symptoms.’ She got checked out and had successful surgery. So if I can help one person not feel as alone as I did, I feel like I was given a brain tumour for a reason.”\n\nClick on the button below to find out how you can tune in live to Ellen’s Saturday Morning Takeover on Rewind Radio from 10 – 11am on 17 August, or listen back to it in your own time."
