        "text": "With over 9 years as a college counselor and 20+ years in corporate meeting and event planning, college counselor Diane Bidna has a keen eye for details. She has worked as a counselor both in a high school setting as well as independently, and has advised students of all levels including IB, AP and college prep. Diane strives to help students create a diverse list of schools that are a good fit for each student, instead of focusing solely on “brand name” schools.\n\nDiane has served as the college counselor at international high schools both Mexico and the United States, where she worked with students from around the world. She has also worked as an academic and college advisor at small private high schools in the San Fernando Valley, as well as for a company that coordinates college visit trips for students and parents. These trips included meeting with professors, deans, admissions representatives and current students. Diane has visited dozens of colleges; she loves exploring “hidden gem” colleges and sharing information about them with her students.\n\nDiane graduated from USC with a BS in Business, is married to an educator, and has 3 boys, all three of whom have successfully navigated the college search and application process."
