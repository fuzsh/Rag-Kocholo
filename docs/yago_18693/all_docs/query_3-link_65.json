        "text": "Hello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nSo, back in 2022, I did a quick review on the 2015 BBC TV adaptation of ‘Partners In Crime’, featuring Agatha Christie‘s less well-known characters in crime English literature – Tommy and Tuppence – played by David Walliams and Jessica Raine. I enjoyed checking out that short-lived six-part TV series. Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nIt’s that time again to share my thoughts on some movies I saw on Disney+ lately, except this time it’s not two or three films I’m sharing my thoughts on, but four. Yes, I’ve seen about four movies in October 2023. A couple of them have spooky elements to them. Are they any good? Let’s find out. 🙂 Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nBack in March, I gave my Mum her birthday present, which she enjoyed. Since she loves crime drama, I gave my Mum the 2015 series of Agatha Christie‘s ‘Partners In Crime’ on DVD. I’m glad she enjoyed it as well as me and my Dad. I’m saddened the series wasn’t renewed for a second season. 😦 Continue reading →\n\nSPOILERS ALERT!!!\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nI’ve recently seen the latest film adaptation of ‘Death on the Nile’ by director/actor Kenneth Branagh. This is the sequel to the 2017 film ‘Murder on the Orient Express’. This film was meant to come out in 2020. Sadly, due to the Covid-19 pandemic – please keep safe – the film was delayed. 😐 Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nIt’s time for me to share some a few quick reviews on some Christmas presents I gave to my Mum and Dad last year. I’ll be sharing more reviews on Christmas presents I’ve received from my best mate Stephen in 2021. There was a lot to check out over Christmas last year and it’s been exciting. 🙂 Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nFor Christmas 2020, I gave my Mum a 3-disc DVD set of an ‘Agatha Christie Collection featuring Peter Ustinov’ in his ‘classic role’ as Hercule Poirot. For my Dad, I gave him a Blu-ray edition of 2016’s ‘Pete’s Dragon’. We’ve enjoyed watching these films very much over the Christmas holidays. Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nIt’s taken me a while to get around to this, but I can finally share some thoughts and predictions about the upcoming ‘Death on the Nile’ movie by director/actor Kenneth Branagh, which is the sequel to the 2017 movie ‘Murder on the Orient Express’. This should be an intriguing film to see. 🙂 Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nMany of you Agatha Christie fans will be anticipating the upcoming film adaptation of ‘Death on the Nile’ by Kenneth Branagh. Before that time comes, here are four reviews on four film adaptations of Agatha Christie’s books from producers John Brabourne and Richard Goodwin to enjoy. Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nWell, Sarah Sutton said I should do more Agatha Christie stuff on my blog in the Aprils Fools sketch we did earlier this year and what good timing to post this after my ‘Doctor Who’ post on ‘The Unicorn and the Wasp’. Today, I’ve added my reviews on the 12 stories featured in the BBC ‘Miss Marple’ TV series, starring Joan Hickson as the title sleuth. I’ve enjoyed watching these adaptations. Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nAnd welcome back to the world to ‘The World of Agatha Christie’!\n\nYeah it’s been a while since I’ve posted reviews on any Agatha Christie-related stuff. But today, I’m not going to add my reviews on Series 2 of ITV’s ‘Agatha Christie’s Marple’ series. Although I will get to do that someday. Instead, I’m adding my reviews on the ‘Miss Marple’ series with Margaret Rutherford. Continue reading →"
