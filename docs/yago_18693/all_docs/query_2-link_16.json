        "text": "A: I definitely knew early on that I had a fascination with mixing together color and texture. By the age of 8, I had memorized all 120 of the colors from my mom's art supply catalog and began formulating color palettes. From the age of 13, I knew I wanted to be a designer in three-dimensional space, preferably an event designer. Taking elements from my performance, fashion design, archival background, events were always my true calling. There was something special about getting home in the middle of the night after an event, after handcrafting something that existed for only a short period of time and could be experienced only by those in attendance, inspired me enough to pursue a life bordered by being a designer and a small business owner: the only two things in life that ever truly challenged me to use the fullest extent of my potential.\n\nA: Those who know me best, truly know that I love to turn the saturation dial up to level 11. I also can’t resist that pop of color that can only come from the combination of hot pink and orange. Yet there’s something about warm undertones of ballet pink and coral that take me back to the beautiful costuming I wore as classically trained ballet dancer, and memories of performing with American Ballet Theater at the Lyric Opera in Chicago.\n\nA: My favorite part has been building this company, and it’s brand, from the ground up. To start with nothing, and create something no one has seen before is a designer’s greatest challenge. It’s also a lonely road to travel alone, which is why we are proud to be a family owned and operated company. Being able to bounce ideas off of my business partner and family member at the same time, is not a support system everyone can say they have. Many people also can’t say that they work well with their family, although we truly balance each other through our own independent artistic and technical skills, and there’s no one I would trust more on those 18 hour installation days, which have been perfected down to a science over the past decade and half, than my mom and business partner.\n\nA: I've learned a lot about myself as a person, the capabilities of expanding our two person team, and my own preferences in design style. I realize our traditional style is something that I continue to fall back on over the years. Growing up we had these wonderful formal holidays with our home decorated to the nines. My mom instilled this love of decoration and ornament in me from a young age, and because we did it together that became one of my greatest values. The best part is we still get the opportunity to continue decorating together.\n\nA: As a family owned company, we take your trust in us, including you vision and investment, seriously and we believe you should be treated as a member of our own family. Details truly make the design, and all of the little things that you share with us throughout our Design Experience will become incorporated into the design that we handcraft for you. You’ll never be another number for us and we’ll always care more about the satisfaction of our clients, over our profit margins. One of the things I love more about our company is that each of our client work directly with and get to know Diane and I throughout the entire process for a personalized experience large scale design companies cannot offer.\n\nA: I always say our brand is it's own entity. It lives, breathes, grows and matures as much as we do. When we started in 2005, I wasn't considering the potential we had to be what we are, although I knew I wanted to take on more of the industry. I wanted to tackle many of things I found troubling in our industry and make a change, from kickbacks, to quality, transparency, lack of proper attribution and stolen images from other designers within competitor advertisements. If you told me a decade and a half later that we would be where we are today, I'd probably do that little overjoyed happy dance I do every time something major happens in our small business' history, such as earning your business.\n\nA: Our company truly represents who we are. It’s our hope and dreams, and much of our personalities. We think our company is an easy one to remember, aside from our unique signature style and artful twist, as it stands for our founders, Amanda and Diane.\n\nA: Designing in a specific style, and taking notes from our backgrounds in fashion design, we acknowledge that our work will speak volumes to a specific kind of client. This client loves adornment, color, and the timelessness of formality, and is willing to invest to receive it, although doesn’t believe good design has to include an elitist price tag to be exceptional. Everything we do revolves around this idea of an aesthetic build around these values, and we are always considering how best to represent this as a concept through everything that we do.\n\nA: I would love to open a larger studio and warehouse space with public access, expanding our line of fresh floral products for every occasion, along with bumping up our corporate division, which is my favorite of our three divisions. I am also excited to see where our Decor department takes us in the future through the endless possibilities of Fabrication. My mind is constantly thinking about how to make our Design Experience better from the client perspective, how our design work can be more efficient and streamlined, how our website, social media and marketing materials can better communicate our brand, and how we can best use your investment dollars to provide the largest return possible."
