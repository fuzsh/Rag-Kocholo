        "text": "Chris and Fliss Hawthorne are young, recently married and in love. However, their cash flow is virtually non-existent and they are as poor as the proverbial church mice. Their living room furniture consists of a deckchair marked 'Property of Prestatyn UDC' and they have no room for the luxuries of life, a fact that makes Chris rather doleful. Fliss generally cheers him up with a murmur of 'Chriss-Fliss-Kiss', followed by a quick snog.\n\nTo ease their financial problems, the Hawthornes take in Chris's friend, Gavin Rumsey, a refugee from a broken marriage, as their lodger. Unlike his hosts, sporty Gavin always has cash to burn. He brings with him a vanload of expensive furniture and a flashy car. He also tends to flirt with his pretty landlady, who always remains loyal to her lacklustre journalist husband. In the fourth series, he gives way to another lodger, Adrian Lockett, who, to complicate matters, alo quickly becomes besotted with Fliss."
