        "text": "DD ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT REVIEW – 9 to 5 the Musical Combines Entertaining Escapism with Meaningful Themes\n\nBy Sheryl Jensen, Editor DD A&E\n\nAmid a steamy heat wave and unnerving political turmoil, the audience was ready for an entertaining escape as they entered the NorShor Theatre in Duluth for 9 to 5 the Musical. Laughter is medicine for the soul, and the Duluth Playhouse cast delivered a healthy dose.\n\nDolly Parton herself made a brief cameo video appearance at the Duluth Playhouse on Friday night before 9 to 5 the Musical began, even singing a few bars of the show’s instantly recognizable theme song.\n\nShe also reminded the audience of a time in 1979 before computers and cell phones, when shag rugs, disco, and pet rocks were all the rage, and when gas was 88 cents a gallon. And of the show’s workplace environment, Parton added, “There was no such thing as office assistants, we were ‘just’ secretaries.”\n\nParton wrote the music and lyrics for the title song for the beloved 1980 movie starring Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda, and the inimitable Dolly herself. Both the iconic song and the film owe their titles to 9 to 5, an organization founded in 1973 to bring about fair pay and equal treatment for women in the workplace. Parton went on to write the music and lyrics for 9 to 5 the Musical which opened on Broadway in 2009.\n\nIt is certain that many people under thirty in the opening night audience had never seen the movie, much less the musical adaptation, and were encountering these characters and this revenge comedy for the first time.\n\nAnd those who were very familiar with the characters and story were ready to sing along with the opening song.\n\n“9 to 5” feels like a classic old-school musical comedy, with a large cast, big production numbers, plenty of dancing, colorful period costumes, and many opportunities for laughter.\n\nThe three leads, Jen Burleigh-Bentz (Violet Newstead), Haley Methner (Doralee Rhodes), and Alyson Enderle (Judy Bernly), are top-notch, all with convincing acting chops, great comedic timing, and powerhouse vocals. Each of their characters gives a different perspective of working the 9 to 5 life.\n\nViolet is an office supervisor at Consolidated Industries. She has been passed over for promotions given to much less qualified men, seeing her boss take credit for her work, and been ignored when she had ideas to improve productivity and working conditions.\n\nEarly on, Doralee laments about being a “backwoods Barbie” with “too much makeup and too much hair” and being the victim of malicious lies and gossip about having an affair with the company’s sleazy boss, Mr. Franklin Hart Jr. (Ole Dack).\n\nPrim and proper Judy, recently divorced from her philandering husband who left her for another woman, has never even had a job before. She gets swept up in a whole new world of fixing jammed copy machines, hearing office gossip, and finding allies and friends.\n\nThe three represent all those who were and still are victims of gender injustices, passed over for getting “fair promotions,” and tired of being just “a step on the bossman’s ladder.”\n\nEach actress has great fun with the comic fantasy sequence songs, where they imagine how they could get revenge on Hart. “The Dance of Death” is Judy’s turn as a femme fatale, in a sexy tango in which she both enchants, scares, and dominates Hart.\n\nDoralee’s “Cowgirl’s Revenge” is a Western hoot where she fantasizes about lassoing, dragging to the ground, hog-tying, and even “branding” Hart on his backside.\n\nThe hysterically funny “Potion Notion” has Violet playing Snow White, who sings in an ever-so-sweet voice about poisoning her despicable boss.\n\nAfter escalating despicable behavior from Hart, crazy circumstances lead the women to take matters into their own hands. And, in a series of initially unintended happenings with poison, guns, and tangled telephone cords, they kidnap him.\n\nDack is appropriately smarmy and disgusting as Hart, who is repeatedly described as a “sexist, egotistical, lying, hysterical bigot.” The audience can’t wait to see how he will get what he deserves for being such a deplorable human being.\n\nCarrie Rossow's performance as Roz Keith, Hart’s frumpy assistant who spys, digs up dirt, and is Hart’s ever-faithful sycophant, was a true scene-stealer.\n\nRoz’s “Heart to Hart” show-stopping number has her writhing on Hart’s desk, revealing her unspoken feelings of love and lust for the boss and her unexpected scarlet red bra underneath her nondescript work attire. (Cue howls of laughter and more cheers from the audience)\n\nPlaying Joe, Violet’s love interest, Ryan Haff was charming, endearing, and funny, with a beautiful voice and great stage presence. Here’s hoping his job as a local Northern News anchor won’t keep him from appearing again soon in another show.\n\nDirector Ann Aiko Bergeron, UMD Professor Emeritus, gathered a fabulous cast, including both her leads and her wonderful ensemble, who played multiple roles.\n\nAntony Ferguson was the ensemble's standout dancer, putting his ballet training to good use with some incredible pirouettes.\n\nBergeron’s company choreography was intricate, complex, and engaging. Her vast experience directing and/or choreographing over 65 plays, musicals, and staged operas, was on clear display throughout the evening.\n\nHer detailed character study with her actors was also evident with some of her past students from UMD Theatre productions, actors new to the Playhouse, and some Playhouse “veterans,” who all had a clear sense of the characters they were portraying and how to bring them to vivid life.\n\nKudos to Music Director Kyle Picha and the 12-piece orchestra for providing strong musical energy and support for the singers.\n\nDespite the engaging entertainment that “9 to 5” provided to its audience on a warm summer evening, one statistic to keep in mind is that American women today earn, on average, about 82 cents for every dollar a man earns. For Black women, it's about 65 cents. For Latina women, it's about 60 cents.\n\nIn Destination Duluth's recent profile Bergeron said, “The 9 to 5 movement was a historical movement that bears recognition. ‘9 to 5 The Musical’ catapults the issues through humor, camp, music, and dance, and we hope the audience leaves with a spark of empowerment and/or impetus for change.”\n\nInformation for “9 to 5 the Musical” Duluth Playhouse\n\nPerformances July 12-28 at the Duluth Playhouse at 211 E.

Her production of William Shakespeare’s Taming of the Shrew at East High School won the National High School Theater award from the BRAVO television network.\n\nShe has written theater, music, dance, and opera reviews for the Duluth News Tribune for many years and is now the Arts & Entertainment Editor for Destination Duluth.\n\nDD THEATRE REVIEW – Lyric Opera of the North (LOON) Celebrates La Vie Bohème\n\nLyric Opera of the North’s dazzling production of Puccini’s “La Bohème” wowed their full-house audience on Friday night at UMD’s Marshall Performing Arts Center. Soaring and breathtaking arias, solos, and ensemble songs portray both the blissful happiness and the devastating heartache of love.\n\nFrom Puccini’s beloved original iconic opera “La Boheme” in 1896 to Jonathan Larson’s modern adaptation “Rent” in 1996, and the award-winning movie “Moulin Rouge” in 2001 and stage musical in 2018, the view into the “carefree” Bohemian lifestyle has long enraptured audiences.\n\nThe opera’s little “family” of aspiring artists, the poet/dramatist Rodolfo(Gennard Lombardozzi), the artist Marcello (Bill McMurray), the philosopher Colline (Jeremiah Sanders), and the musician Schaunard (Robert Riordan) enthusiastically portrayed the “hearty fellows well met” who have a shared love of wine, women, and song. Their scenes and songs together evoke the essence of La Vie Boheme, with each having a masterful voice to help tell the story.\n\nTenor Lombardozzi, as Rodolfo, “victim” of love at first sight, tenderly professed his love for Mimi (soprano Lacy Sauter), in the sweeping “Che gelida manina,’” “What a frozen little hand.” Later, the two blend gorgeously in their duet, “O soave fanciulla\" (\"O gentle maiden”).\n\nAs the pitiful and consumptive heroine, Sauter has heartbreaking songs and scenes throughout. Mimi’s illness causes her to break down, and she eventually returns to the garret one last time to be with Rodolfo.\n\nThe standout performance of the evening was from Vicki Fingalson, playing the self-centered and ever-flirtatious, Musetta. Her “Quando m'en vo” or 'Musetta's Waltz” has the most recognizable melody in the opera. With her flaming red hair, her elegant costumes, and her total command of the stage, Fingalson steals the show from her first appearance.\n\nA marvelous 26-piece orchestra, under the direction of conductor Dirk Meyer, provided wonderful accompaniment for the singers and underscore for the events, whether they be romantic or tragic moments. Meyer, in view from the pit, is always a commanding presence with his lyrical conducting style bringing out the best in the musicians.\n\nUnder Michael Fuchs's chorus direction, the powerful ensemble, seen in the street and cafe scenes, brought the stage to life with their strong voices and creative characterizations.\n\nAn adorable children’s chorus bombards the beleaguered toy-seller Parpignol (Brian Kapp) for their Christmas gifts, bringing moments of joy and excitement to the stage as they enjoy a holiday parade. Their voices, blending in with the adult ensemble, add even more shades and dimension to the score.\n\nAnn Gumpper’s masterful sets, from the colorful Latin Quarter garret to the streets of Paris on Christmas Eve, created the perfect ambiance for the doomed love story to take place. And with the addition of evocative lighting from designer Alex Flinner, the dramatic and beautiful stage pictures were an important element to the show’s overall look and style.\n\nColorful period costumes, designed by Ora Jewel-Busche, swept the audience away to another place and time. The costumes worn by Musetta and Colin were particularly colorful, helping to establish their characters.\n\nThe sheer number of costume pieces from Jewel-Busche, working with Laura Piotrowski (costume construction) was impressive, including everything from ragged paint-covered paints to gorgeous gowns and scores of accessories.\n\nDirector Rose Freeman describes their directing style as the “belief in communal storytelling,” which they do with sure-handed effectiveness in La Bohème. Their overview of “the joyful celebration of each other” shines through in every moment of this production.\n\nBy encouraging opera and theatre companies with whom they work to “Live truthfully in imaginary circumstance,” Freeman was able to create both truthful and imaginary worlds at the same time.\n\nBravo to Sarah Lawrence and Cal Metts, LOON’s co-artistic directors, and their team for bringing over 90 people together to present “La Boheme” to appreciative opera patrons, some long-time and some new audience members, who cheered wildly and stood up for a standing ovation. LOON deserves to build its audience base even more and make more people aware of this true gem of Northland culture.\n\nLOON Presents La Bohème\n\nComposed by Giacomo Puccini\n\nLibretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa\n\nLOON's first production of Puccini's classic, featuring passionate lovers, struggling artists, and gorgeous singing. One of the best and most popular operas of all time.\n\nFriday, June 14 at 7:00 pm\n\nSunday, June 16 at 3:00 pm\n\nTickets at loonooera.org.Fonr ticket assistance, call 218-464-0922.\n\nMarshall Performing Arts Center (MPAC) at UMD\n\nUp next for LOON is their “Summer Sparkler” concert fundraiser on Tuesday, August 6 at the Historic Scott House. Tickets at loonopera.org or 218-464-0922.\n\nLoon Opera revealed their 20th anniversary season for 2024-25 :“The Impres Ario” & “Circe on Superior” in November; “The Radio Hour” in January; and “Die Fledermaus” in June o f2025. Season tickets are now available at loonopera.org\n\nThey will also present works for their Little Loon 24-25 season by visiting area schools, opera karaoke in September, their annual February fundraiser, and a summer concert at the Historic Scott House in August of 2025.\n\n_____\n\nAbout Sheryl Jensen - Arts & Entertainment Editor\n\nA retired educator with the Duluth Public Schools, Sheryl Jensen has been a theater director of over 60 school and community productions. Her production of William Shakespeare’s Taming of the Shrew at East High School won the National High School Theater award from the BRAVO television network.\n\nHaving written theater, music, dance, and opera reviews for the Duluth News Tribune for many years, she now is the Arts & Entertainment Editor for Destination Duluth.\n\n“Trailer Park” Rocks in a Raucous and Raunchy Romp\n\nThe opening night audience at “The Great American Trailer Park Musical” was instantly immersed into the grimy world of Armadillo Acres before the show even began.\n\nCurtis Phillips and Jeff Brown’s outstanding scenic design of a run-down trailer park in a little Florida town provided the perfect ambiance for the seven actors to portray the wackiest of characters.\n\nWith a perfect replica of a travel Florida sign above, two realistic-looking trailers on each side of the stage, and ridiculous set decoration, complete with a toilet as a flower “pot,” the set is a character in and of itself.\n\nSasha’s Howell’s trashy costume design also clearly, from the first, established time, place, and characters’ personalities, with the actors rocking their ragged cut-offs, tank tops, t-shirts, glitz, and bright colors. Jamie Snyder’s makeup and hair design also hit the mark with colorful makeup and the intentional use of the rattiest of wigs.\n\nDirector Michael Kraklio shepherded his cast well through all the show’s sledgehammer comedy in a mash-up of a Jerry Springer show, “Hee-Haw,” “Little Shop of Horrors,” a \"Saturday Night Live” skit, and a country music concert, “Trailer Park” is a raucous parody that is unashamedly raunchy, much to the audience’s delight.\n\nPlaying a Greek chorus who knows all and tells all, the trio of TJ Mayrand (Betty), Erin Blazevic (Lin), and Amber Burns (Pickles), were hysterical, having great fun singing of their own tales of woe and giving a dirty running commentary of the crazy goings on at Armadillo Acres.\n\nAmber Burns, who also choreographed the show, filled in to play Pickle, just over a week before opening due to actress Rylee Kubera’s illnesss. Burns didn’t miss a beat showing her dancing chops and bringing her sassy character to life with her always adorable and identifiable voice.\n\nAs Jeannie, the agoraphobic wife, who hasn’t left her trailer in twenty years, Sara Marie Sorenson had some of the the evening's best vocals in “Owner of My Hear” and “That’s Why I Love My Man.” Sorenson’s portrayal is the most honest and sincere, playing a sweet and sympathetic character who can, however, show her fiery ire when her man does her wrong.\n\nBryan Burns as Jeanne’s husband Norbert, the beleaguered toll booth collector,\n\nIs at the center of a love triangle, with his wife and a colorful newcomer to the park. Burns brings an earnestness to the role that is a touchstone for the events and intrigues that he manages to get himself embroiled in, without his taking time to realize the full impact off his actions.\n\nAlways using her powerful voice to blow the audience’s hair back, audience favorite Christina Stroup was eminently believable as Pippi, the stripper, and newest resident of Armadillo Acres, who gives the other residents plenty to gossip about. Stroup is at her best when playing these bigger-than-life roles, giving her ample chances to command every scene in which she appears.\n\nEric Elefson does comic double duty, donning a ridiculous flamingo costume, hilariously taking care of scene changes, and as the show’s villain, Duke, who makes his “dramatic” entry on a “motorcycle” in the aptly named song “Road Kill.” Elefson is convincing as a crazed lunatic, stalking his ex-girlfriend, who at an unexpected turn of events, helps the story end happily.\n\nIs “Trailer Park” a masterpiece in the musical theatre genre? Decidedly no. Its humor is often over-the-top filfthy, its songs are pretty forgettable, and its irreverent satire of trailer park life is filled with stereotypical jabs at those who live on the wrong side of the tracks. Rather than the use of pre-recorded tracks, a small live band, dressed as “trailer trash,” would have made the show’s music tighter and more fun.\n\nAnd yet, the audience came ready to be entertained and chortled heartily during the entire show. Some audience members were literally doubled over with laughter, even slapping their knees and throwing their heads back at some of the most audacious lines.\n\nTwo of the marks of a successful production are did the audience enjoy themselves and were they buying into the story and the characters, no matter how preposterous? “Trailer Park’s” appreciative opening night audience laughed uproariously, clapped loudly throughout, and rose to their feet at show’s end.\n\nMission accomplished.\n\nBoat Club Production’s “The Great American Trailer Park Musical”\n\nPresented at the Spirit of the North Theater at Fitger’s. 600 East Superior St.\n\nJune 7-16, 2024\n\nSHOWTIMES June 7-8 7:30 pm | June 9 2:00 pm\n\nJune 13-15 7:30 pm | June 16 2:00 pm\n\nTickets available at boatclubproductions.com\n\nFor more information, call 218- 623-7065\n\n*Content Warning: Due to the mature nature of this production, it is not suitable for children.\n\nUp next for Boat Club Productions, the thriller “Wait Until Dark,” running October 4-13.\n\nDD THEATRE REVIEW - PETER AND THE STARCATCHER\n\nThe Duluth Playhouse’s ”Peter and the Starcatcher” is a wild adventure ride telling the “origin story” of Peter Pan and what happened before the boy who “wouldn’t grow up” flew into the Darlings’ nursery one fateful night.\n\nBravo to Phillip Fazio who had to be not only the director, but also a circus ringleader of sorts, keeping all the balls in the air, the actors “spinning,” and the plot driving forward. It is a choreographic whirlwind of a show, not for dance, but for keeping all the constantly role and costume changing actors in the right place at the right time.\n\nFazio also establishes the right mix of sweetness, silliness, playfulness, and even, at times, pathos to tackle this challenging piece of theater. He and his cast take the audience into a world of make-believe and inventive storytelling\n\nWriter Rick Elice (based on a novel by humorist Dave Barry) turned the beloved tale upside down in this 2012 Tony award-winning play. While keeping elements of the charm and magic of J.M Barrie’s beloved 1911 story, there is little that is “Disneyesque” or even remotely reminiscent of the Mary Martin original Broadway musical of decades ago.\n\nThis version is filled with fast and furious dialogue delivered with sometimes thick, intentionally unrecognizable accents, requiring the audience’s full attention. Sly and often witty allusions to everyone from Shakespeare to Michael Jackson also require the audience to be attentive to catch them all.\n\nOne of the first “stars” of the show is Jeff Brown’s magnificent set, an attic with nooks, crannies, platforms, stairs, and even a hatch door, giving the perfect “playground” for the 12 actors to perform 100 characters.\n\nBrown’s masterful lighting provides shadows and sunshine, starlight and the dark of night, and much more, to create imaginative and captivating stage pictures.\n\nKudos to prop designer April Ellingsen who uses the cluttered attic to plant the needed “bells and whistles,” trunks, fabrics, musical instruments and other ephemera as creative props for the actors to tell the story.\n\nPeg Ferguson’s wonderfully colorful and eclectic costumes intentionally look as if they are mostly made up of cast-off pieces that might have been pulled from the attic’s trunks by children playing dress-up.\n\nWhile providing necessary exposition and set up of the complicated plot, Act I got a bit bogged down at an hour-and-a-half. After intermission, however, the show shifts to a higher gear, and the audience came alive.\n\nOpening Act II. a hilarious mermaids’ “chorus line” of the entire cast, costumed in ratty sequins and wigs of every color of the rainbow, delivers a preposterous song and dance. Then, all the puzzle pieces of the plot start quickly falling into place, leading to an emotional and heartfelt ending.\n\nThe show requires its actors to be onstage prop masters, musicians, stage crew, and singers, and to change roles at the literal drop of the hat. An ensemble cast, onstage for almost the entire show is filled with talented performers.\n\nStandout ensemble members include Alyson Enderle, who, with a nod to the ever so prim and proper nanny Mary Poppins, turns from a governess into a lascivious wench by the show’s end. Enderle also takes on other roles with fast costume changes on the fly, playing a variety of musical instruments, and even broadly conducting the “chorus” in the company’s biggest vocal number.\n\nPlaying two beleaguered Lost Boys, Greyson Holste and SJ Olson evoke both laughter and sympathy as they try to keep up with the ever-changing twists and turns of events.\n\nJustin Peck’s Smee is a delightful “right-hand man” and devoted sycophant for the Pirate Captain. At one point, Peck gives a hysterical turn as a singing mermaid “siren,” unsuccessfully trying to lure men to the rocks.\n\nPlucky, courageous, and decidedly not a girl to leave the dangerous “stuff” to the boys, the character of Molly Aster (Hope Nordquist), at first, seems to be the Wendy of Barrie’s tale. It is not until the very end of the show, however, that her true identity is revealed.\n\nNordquist is entirely convincing, charming, and funny as the courageous, fearless, adorable, and bossy leader of the story’s mission, determined to set things right.\n\nPlaying the title role of Peter, Jake Mathey tugs at the heartstrings as, at first, the nameless Lost Boy, who so desperately wants an identity, home, family, and ultimately love. Mathey hits all the right notes of the earnest, sweet, and conflicted boy, who needs to make the ultimate decision to come into Molly’s world and grow up or to stay on an island to play forever.\n\nDespite the title, Evan Kelly is decidedly the star of the show, “swashing and buckling” with the best of them in his role of Black Stache, the “avatar” of Captain Hook. Kelly’s commanding presence, his magnificently tailored red coat, his impossibly coiffed and lush mustache, and his endless stream of double entendres, modern references, and smarmy dialogue make him the show’s black heart.\n\nKelly revels in every nuance of being the villain, playing it to the hilt and shamelessly stealing every scene when he is on onstage, much to the audience’s raucous approval.\n\nThe conundrum of “Peter and the Star Catcher” to consider: “Is it a children’s show?” Despite it being based on a favorite children’s story, its length of 2 1/2 hours (with intermission) may be tough for the wee ones in the audience. A few sleepy faces at intermission in the lobby were sipping blue mermaid drinks.\n\nMuch of the dialogue and complicated plot would be lost to all but the most precocious children. Yet, the action, color, and broad comedy, could hold many kiddos. Parents’ discretion is the best rule here.\n\nThe Playhouse and Fazio are commended for choosing a demanding play (not a musical in the traditional sense), and finding the cast and artistic team to bring all the elements of the creative staging to enchanting life.\n\nSee “Peter and the Star Catcher” to remember what you have always loved about the “Peter Pan” characters. Then enjoy following the trail of the “basket of Easter Eggs,” discovering the hidden surprises and clues of the prequel to the story.\n\nYou’ll find Peter, the Lost Boys, Neverland, the crocodile, Tinker Bell, Captain Hook, and the scurvy pirates, all there in new and whimsical ways you have never seen before.\n\nPeter and the Starcatcher\n\nWritten by Rick Elice\n\nBased on the novel by Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson\n\nMusic by Warne Barker\n\nAt the Duluth Playhouse at the NorShor Theatre\n\n211 E.

The story spins around in a tilt-a-whirl going in different directions, echoing two actors’ movements around each other as they discuss love, anger, quantum physics, beekeeping, death, romance, sex, jealousy, and, indeed, the very meaning of life.\n\nThe Playhouse Lab is an intimate 60-seat space that helps to draw the audience even more into a universe of potential paths one couple’s relationship could take.\n\nEvery shifting scene goes “backwards, forwards, and sideways” showing the multitude of choices and decisions the characters in this “two-hander” make. The audience is left to decide what the couple’s true linear path is, or if there ever is a linear path to their lives.\n\n“Constellations” is a tour-de-force acting high wire act for real-life husband and wife Phil Hoelscher and Alyson Enderle. Hoelscher plays Roland, a funny, romantic, sweet, caring, and down-to-earth beekeeper. Enderle as Marianne, is a theoretical physicist, who is brilliant, passionate, complex, quick-witted, and endlessly frustrating.\n\nAs the two characters try to learn about each other, it is not just the small stuff they attempt to figure out, but the big questions of time, space, fate, and free will, as they ride an emotional roller coaster together and apart.\n\nBeing so close to the actors allowed the audience to see both the fire and frustration in Enderle’s eyes and the pain and pathos in Hoelscher’s. There was a an undeniable sense of the deep inner life that they each brought to these roles.\n\nHowever, the nature of the configuration of audience seats means that the actors have their backs to the audience part of the time. People seated to the extreme far left and right (as I was) missed hearing a few lines and seeing some of the actors’ facial expressions. The actors do their best to compensate, making this only a small issue throughout the show.\n\nWatching the actors execute the exhausting and intricate blocking patterns required, and realizing what memorization of this tremendously complex script would have taken them, adds to how impressive these talented actors are. At one point, they even replayed an earlier scene, this time using sign language, offering a whole set of nuances and meaning different from the spoken word.\n\n“Constellations” is a challenging, engaging, and at times, funny piece of theater that raises more questions than it answers. Are Roland and Marianne truly in love? Are they in other relationships? Do they end up together? How do their lifelines connect or diverge? Why do conversations keep rewinding and unwinding, spooling and unspooling in rapid succession?\n\nWhile making this emotional voyage with the couple, audience members can’t help but ponder their own life choices and how changing even a few small details could derail or improve the train ride of one’s life.\n\nAt a fast-paced seventy minutes, without an intermission, the audience is at the center of a whirlwind of alternate realities. Director Justin Peck and his actors had obviously delved into layers of character analysis and the depths of late-night philosophical discussions on some of life’s great conundrums.\n\nAnd, as if the show is not complex enough, Peck raised the bar even more by using four actors over the nine-performance run. Alyson Enderle and Jess Hughes will alternate as Marianne; with Phil Hoelscher and Hunter Ramsden alternating as Roland.\n\nThe impact of this casting choice is certain to make some audience members want to see the show more than once to note the changing dynamics that will happen with the actors as they play the same roles with different actors playing opposite them.\n\n“Constellations” requires quite a bit, not only from the actors, but from the audience as well. Yet, it is a play that is sure to elicit many thoughtful after-show discussions as audience members share views on what they saw and heard, what they felt, and what this thought-provoking show is really all about for them.\n\n“Constellations”\n\nBy Nick Payne\n\nApril 11-27\n\nThe Lab at the NorShor Theatre\n\n213 E.

From their first entrance in their colorful costumes, it was fun to identify the character traits of Dopey, Grumpy, Bashful, Sneezy, Sleepy, Happy, and Doc.\n\nPiper Linn, Martha Kliewer, Adelaide von Rabenau, Kadence von Rabenau, Kylin Hahn, Zinnia Kracker, and Natalie Carter, were obviously having great fun using their dancing and acting skills to bring these classic characters to life.\n\nOther students in the company charmed with their portrayals of birds, deer, bees, bunnies, and butterflies, enchanting Snow White, and bringing laughter and applause from the audience.\n\nProviding opportunities for the young students to shine, to grow, and to feel a part of something much bigger than themselves, was clearly part of the evening’s mission. Whether playing pages, a master of ceremonies, or a sweet woodland creature, each provided an important threads to the tapestry of the ballet.\n\nWill each of these students pursue a career in dance? Obviously not. But will they remember these performances with pride? Absolutely! And the chance to watch the professional company and how they pursue their craft is an invaluable life lesson.\n\nMembers of the professional company used both their exceptional dancing skills, as well as their clear characterizations, to bring new shades of meaning to the story. One standout was Matthew Frezzell, the Huntsman, who starts as a seemingly heartless villain, and ends showing the depths of his humanity and sympathy for Snow White. His dancing was athletic and powerful, and his stage presence was electric.\n\nXimena Azurmendi’s Evil Queen, with her legion of gargoyles, was everything one would want in a narcissistic and murderous diva. Beautiful, but lethal, Azurmendi was convincing throughout, both with her elegant dancing and her spot-on characterization, to the inevitable moment when she hands Snow White the bright red, poisoned apple.\n\nAnthony Cefalu, in the role of the King, had some of the evening’s stronger dancing, and was an empathetic father to Snow White, even while being blind to the Evil Queen’s plots.\n\nWith a beautiful pairing with the Evil Queen on the other side of the magic mirror was dancer Jessica Lopes, evoking Snow White’s Mother, looking like Snow White herself, and serving as a stark contrast to the Evil Queen.\n\nAs the Prince, Issac Sharratt was a commanding presence and partnered well with Brianna Crockett as Snow White. He demonstrated both a strong ability to showcase Crockett and to dance as a polished soloist with skill and finesse. His lifts were gorgeous, showing the range of his strength and agility.\n\nCrockett was a delight, channeling all the sweetness, innocence, and gentleness required for one of the all-time favorite fairy tale heroines. Her dancing was graceful and expressive as she moved with a seemingly effortless ease, while showing beautiful technique en pointe.\n\nCrockett and Sharatt had marvelous dances in the wedding celebration scene at the end of the ballet, with both of them able to show their individual virtuosity and their partnering skills.\n\nServing as Artistic Director for the Minnesota Ballet and Choreographer for “Snow White,” Karl van Rabenau’s choreography was cohesive, creative, and appropriate for the varying ages and abilities of his dancers. He was able to bring out the talents of his smallest students, all the way up to challenging his professional dancers to show the depths of their talents.\n\nRabenau’s choreographic story-telling was strong throughout. It was only in the long wedding celebration in Act. III that things dragged a little, with a bit of repetition in the choreography and use of dancers.\n\nThe show’s technical elements, while not especially complex or intricate for the most part, provided the needed elements to tell the story. Ann Gumpper’s designs were especially effective in creating the ambience of the shadowy woods and in the drop for the elegant palace. The lighting was serviceable, but a bit dark at times, especially in the Dwarf’s cottage.\n\nCostumes were decidedly a star of the show. Designers Heather Boudreau and Sandra Ehle did a marvelous job, from the cutest bunny tail or set of bees’ wings, to the regal and elegant costumes of the court and the principals. The detail work in each piece, for each dancer, was impeccable.\n\nWith “Snow White,” the Minnesota Ballet obviously had an “entry level” ballet for the youngest members in the audience, and also appealed to sophisticated ballet lovers who could enjoy all the nuances and power of the professional dancers in the company.\n\nFundraising Dinner/Auction Next Up for the Minnesota Ballet\n\n“The Resplendent Table” on Friday, April 5 in the Depot’s Great Hall, is described as “an enchanted evening inspired by the grace and grandeur of classical ballet” with lavish tables, candelabra, and beautiful table settings.\n\nThe five course dinner from Midcoast Catering is accompanied by wine parings. Attendees can support the Ballet by shopping experiences and items from their silent and live auctions.\n\nTable side entertainment by the Minnesota Ballet’s company dancers will add to the evening’s festivities.\n\nFor tickets and information, visit minnesotaballet.org or call 218-733-7570.\n\nABOUT THE EDITOR\n\nSheryl Jensen\n\nA retired educator with the Duluth Public Schools, Sheryl Jensen has been a theater director of over 60 school and community productions. Her production of William Shakespeare’s Taming of the Shrew at East High School won the National High School Theater award from the BRAVO television network.\n\nHaving written theater, music, dance, and opera reviews for the Duluth News Tribune for many years, she now is the Arts & Entertainment Editor for Destination Duluth.\n\nDestination Duluth Arts & Entertainment Review of Duluth Playhouse's \"Next to Normal.\"\n\nChronic mental illness has touched almost every family, and sadly is becoming even more prevalent today. It is hard to fathom the heartache, devastation, and pain felt by the husbands, wives, and most particularly the children, as they helplessly watch their loved ones spiral down into an abyss of darkness.\n\nDirector Wes Drummond tackles these issues head on with the 2010 Pulitzer Prize winner, and the 2009 winner of three Tony awards, “Next to Normal.” This is not your light-hearted, “feel-good” musical, but it is dazzling in its brutal honesty and in its raw emotion, driving its messages home with a magnificent cast of six actors and a fabulous orchestra.\n\nOn the surface and from the outside, the play’s Goodman family seems “normal,” with the loving parents, Diana and Dan, their teenaged son Gabe and daughter Natalie.\n\nBut as one lyric says about the Goodman house, “Everything is perfect and nothing is real.” After an early tragic incident, Diana has withdrawn for nearly twenty years into the depths of bipolar disorder, and no amount of psychotropic drugs or even ultimately electroconvulsive therapy, have been able to help her.\n\nJen Burleigh-Bentz breaks the audience’s hearts as the bruised and broken Diana, wanting so desperately to be the wife and mother her family needs, and trying unsuccessfully every day just to “hold it all together”.\n\nIn her most anguished song “You Don’t Know,” the audience is able to fully sense the searing pain Diana’s illness has caused her when she vocalizes, “Do you know, do you know what it's like to die alive?” In every song, Burleigh-Bentz bares the very depths of Diana’s tattered soul using her masterful soprano voice to its full advantage.\n\nThomas Bevan delivers a nuanced performance as the ever-patient and devoted husband and caretaker Dan, who is only surviving by “Living on a latte and a prayer.” Bevan has a powerful voice that can, in turns, show both his fear about what he can’t control and his quiet despair as Diana’s manic-depressive episodes destroy all their lives.\n\nBevan shows how Dan is truly a “good man” constantly trying to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives who is pushed to the edge mentally and emotionally himself.\n\nBevan’s clearest statement in song about his life and his view of himself, is in “I Am The One.” He tries to make Diana see that he is the one who knows her, the one who cares, the one who has always been there, which sends her into a combative argument, leading them on a path to nowhere, especially when Gabe jumps into the vocal argument.\n\nNatalie, played brilliantly by Daylen Moore, is a lost soul who has never felt much of any affection or even acknowledgment from her mother. In “Super Boy and the Invisible Girl,” Moore seizes the moment to reveal the essence of her character to the audience, using their amazing Broadway belt voice to tell their story.\n\nMoore’s songs in Act II. get even more impressive as they ride the roller coaster of emotions, wanting to be angry at everyone and have someone show her love at the same time. Moore breaks the audience’s hearts with their lament, “I don’t need a life that’s normal/That’s way too far away/But something next to normal/Would be okay.”\n\nOn the periphery of the staging and at the story’s heart, all at the same time, is the son Gabe. Jake S. Nelson shows the intensity of his character’s rebelliousness, petulance, and even anger, as he fights for his mother’s exclusive attention. Nelson’s best vocals were in his anthem “I’m Alive” where the rock score is particularly suited for his voice.\n\nPlaying both of Diana’s doctors, the aptly named Dr. Fine and Dr. Madden, Antony Ferguson has some of the show’s few comic moments, and convincingly presents how, though well-meaning, the medical establishment is at a loss of how to “cure” Diana. Ferguson’s playing a rock star in one of Diana’s fantasies demonstrated both his comic chops and his strong voice.\n\nSJ Olson plays the only character from the “real” world who comes into the Goodman home as Natalie’s boyfriend, Henry. Olson humorously plays the “stoner” kid and the sweetness of a sympathetic shoulder for Natalie to cry on, as her world falls even more apart. Vocally, Olson had a few early issues with their lower register, but they got stronger as the play progressed, especially with “Perfect for You.”\n\nMusic Director Beth Brophy brought together a tight six-piece band, with musicians at the top of their game playing a difficult score. Bravo to musicians Kyle Picha, Emily Ramsey, Toko Nakajima, Gregg Curleo, Cory Clay, and Kurt Savela.\n\nAll the shows technical aspects were firing on all cylinders too, including designers Nick Gosen (Sound), Curtis Phillps (set) and Jeff Brown (lighting), all doing some of their best work.\n\nSleek and sophisticated with angles, two-levels, and wrought iron railings, Phillips’ set for “Next to Normal” is appropriate for the home of an architect, Dan’s occupation in the play.\n\nIn a play where light is a strong symbol and is also integral to the show’s themes and motifs, Brown’s lighting design is exciting and dynamic, with hundreds of light cues, all emblematic of the music, lyrics, mood, characters, and the intensity of the story.\n\nKudos to Wes Drummond for choosing and bringing to life a show that is challenging for the actors, the production team, the orchestra, and ultimately also for the audience. While it may not be known to many audience members, it is as deserving to be seen as “The Sound of Music” and “Young Frankenstein,” or any other musical this season.\n\nAfter the cast finishes the final song, “Light,” the audience is left mostly silent and emotionally drained. The show leaves everyone with more questions than answers and, undoubtedly, was the impetus for after-show discussion about where the Goodman family could possibly go from here.\n\nYet there is a glimmer of hope for this tortured family, as the lyrics of the final song “Light” assert, “We'll find the will to find our way/ Knowing that the darkest skies will someday see the sun.”\n\nNote: This production is intended for mature audiences and contains profanity, depictions of mental illness, drug use, and self-harm.\n\nInformation for “Next to Normal”\n\nMusic by Tom Kitt and Book and Lyrics by Brian Yorkey\n\nRunning March 15-31\n\nSaturday matinee on March 16 @2 pm\n\nSunday matinees on March 24 & 31 at 2 pm\n\nAudio description March 16 @ 2 pm\n\nASL interpretation on March 29 @ 7:30 pm\n\nFor tickets, call 218.733.7555. or visit the Playhouse site @ duluthplayhouse.org\n\nDD ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT REVIEW - PRIDE & PREJUDICE\n\nZeitgeist Theatre opens its 2024 season with Pride & Prejudice\n\nBy Jane Austen adapted by Kate Hamill - Directed by Justin Peck\n\nPlaying at Teatro Theatre now through February 24\n\nFor more info and tickets, visit zeitgeistarts.com/theater\n\n“It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.” Jane Austen\n\nThat sarcastic opening line from “Pride and Prejudice,” Jane Austen’s 1813 classic novel about the Bennet household of five unmarried daughters and their mother’s frantic pursuit of husbands for them, has been adapted many times. With classic film adaptations and a mini-series, a musical, and even an improbable movie where the Bennet sisters become zombie hunters, the story has endured.\n\nZeitgeist Theater’s version, by contemporary playwright Kate Hamill, takes the prim and proper story of manners and polite society from Austen’s novel and turns it upside down. Slapstick, farce, sexual innuendo, pratfalls, and general comic mayhem all made it a raucous evening of comedy.\n\nHad she been in the audience, would Jane Austin’s face have turned several shades of bright red, and her reaction have been one of shock? Undoubtedly!\n\nAnd would, dear readers, the traditionalist “Janeites” and devoted English literature teachers in the crowd (including this reviewer) be offended? Except for the most immovable among us, absolutely not!\n\nDirector Justin Peck keeps the balls in the air (literally and figuratively), and his actors performing at an appropriately frenetic pace for a wildly entertaining evening. As the show’s ad describes, Peck wanted his staging, with just “two chairs and four boxes” (and an anachronistic keyboard), to rely on the talents of eight actors.\n\nPeck chose wisely with his enormously talented troupe members playing multiple roles with some crazy quick costume changes, sometimes moving from male to female and back again for humorous effect. It is the level of the acting throughout that is the show’s hallmark. Each of the eight is deserving of praise.\n\nPlaying the two leads, Alyson Enderle as Lizzy Bennet and Zachary Stofer as Mr. Darcy, are the only two actors taking on just one role. Enderle has all the pluck, wittiness, intelligence, and high-spirited nature of Austin’s original. For the requirements of this comic adaptation, however, the role is meant to be more giddy and silly. Enderle uses a catalog of expressions and broad physical reactions to display her inner feelings about the hysterical goings-on around her.\n\nBecoming a favorite leading lady in area theater, Enderle is a perfect Lizzie Bennet and also demonstrative of the title’s themes, filled with pride and her own prejudices that she must overcome to find her true match.\n\nStofer’s patented nostril flare is used to great effect as Mr. Darcy to show his disdain for those out of his sphere and station. His gradual softening as he falls in love with Lizzy, without even realizing it himself, are subtle and then gradually more apparent, to charming effect.\n\nStofer has less of the humor in this adaptation to rely on. His commanding presence stands out, even when he is in the background and not directly a part of a scene, as he observes all.\n\nStofer and Enderle go toe-to-toe throughout, in this early 19th century version of a rom-com. With each a quick match for the others banter, independence and intellect, their verbal sparring matches are integral to the show’s success.\n\nStuart Gordon has the evening’s broadest trio of characters to play, the smarmy and villainous Wickham, the overbearing and pandering Collins, and the lusty and fawning Miss Bingley. Using different accents, hilarious facial expressions, and constant costume changes, Gordon gave a comedy acting class.\n\nThe character of Jane Bennet is the less showy or comic. as the perfect, angelic, and beautiful sister. Agatha Pokrzywinski is always believable and sweet as the innocent bystander who gets caught in the web of the marriage game.\n\nPokrzywinski doubles as Miss deBourgh, the infirm and completely shrouded daughter of the infamous Lady Catherine, and “intended” bride for Mr. Darcy. She babbles in an unintelligible language and communicates with only her ridiculous verbal intonations, gaining her some of the biggest laughs of the night.\n\nJess Hughes impeccably performed the nuances of the epitome of haughtiness and snobbishness, Lady Catherine. And, in the sharpest of contrasts, playing the ultimate airhead in the family, Bennet daughter Lydia, with a fascinating blend of ditziness, innocence, guile, and duplicitness, Hughes is spot-on in both roles, showing a complete shift in accent, diction, and demeanor, delineating the two roles.\n\nOften stealing the show was Phil Hoelscher, particularly as the doltish, gangly, and perpetually whining and coughing daughter Mary Bennet. After a while, it only took the unexpected entrances of Mary with her bonneted head, dowdy dress and straggly hair to send the audience into waves of laughter.\n\nHoelscher also played Jane’s suitor. Mr. Bingley, with a sweet shyness and child-like stage business, including bouncing a ball which provided comic fodder for other characters.\n\nNever missing a beat, Christine Winkler Johnson is in perpetual motion with her preposterous orange flowered “party” hat, her endless beleaguered nerves, and her panic to arrange suitable, and sometimes not so suitable husbands for her four girls. (The novel’s fifth sister Kitty is AWOL in this adaptation). Winkler Johnson was also funny as the loud servants, introducing guests.\n\nJennie Ross was a delight as the droll, sarcastic Mr. Bennet, and suitably mousy and downtrodden Charlotte, friend to the Bennett sisters. She marries someone she does not love, since she is from a poorer family and is without a dowry. This is emblematic of one of the important themes from Austen’s novel.\n\nCostumes from UMD’s costume supervisor, Laura Piotrowski, gave the needed sense of the time period, with appropriate hats and accessories to allow for the endless changes and the sense of each character and their fashion sense (or lack thereof).\n\nThe show’s only off “notes” were the jarring pre-show and curtain call’s blaring rock music. While the lyrics may have been thematic, they were hard to understand. Contemporary music would have been fine with different song choices.\n\nOne of the most quoted lines from the novel is, “For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbors, and laugh at them in our turn?” Zeitgeist’s production gave ample opportunities for that sport and laughter for their appreciative full house.\n\n(This review was based on the February 15 performance).\n\nAfter a long hiatus, welcome back to the former Renegade Theater, now renamed Zeitgeist Theater! The theater community is richer for their often irreverent, envelope-pushing production styles and script choices, with a five show season set through 2024.

With this dark pronouncement, the Playhouse audience was sent hurtling down the tracks on a wild ride.\n\nAuthor Dame Agatha Christie penned over 60 detective novels, 14 story collections, and 19 plays. Her works have been translated into over a hundred languages, and more than 150 movies and television program adaptations have been made, making her the undeniable icon of the golden age of the English detective story.\n\nHer beloved novel, Murder on the Orient Express, was adapted into a play by modern playwright Ken Ludwig, who the Christie estate commissioned, managed by her grandson, to choose any of her works to adapt.\n\nAuthor of such popular shows as the musical “Crazy for You” and the play “Lend Me a Tenor,” Ludwig used his comic credentials to add humorous elements to Christie’s dark tale of murder on the famed, elegant, and opulent “King of Trains” Orient Express.\n\nThe train becomes a character itself, both in the novel and the play. Scene designer Ann Gumpper meets the challenges of effectively recreating passenger berths, hallways, a dining car, and the snowy landscape as a backdrop. Her proscenium-framing pieces give an elegant look with the theater’s red curtains and serve as an effective place to project the snow effects of a blizzard.\n\nTraveling from Istanbul to Paris, the train gets caught in a blinding storm, and is stopped by the mounting snow, with the first-class passengers stuck far from civilization while they await rescue. It is then that a bloody, gory murder is discovered in a locked berth, and Poirot is hot on the trail to find out “whodunit.”\n\nThe crafty detective soon deduces, after finding out the true identity of the victim, that the murder is related to a famous American kidnapping case where a child, Daisy Armstrong, was kidnapped and later found dead.\n\nChristie was fascinated by the real-life mystery and tragedy of the 1932 kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby and used many of the details from that true story as the connecting thread of “Orient Express.”\n\nKnowing the story well of the Armstrong kidnapping, Poirot can start unraveling the threads of the mystery of the murder victim and his body full of stab wounds to discern who might have had the motive to kill him.\n\nThe colorful cast of suspects includes a young Englishwoman, a Russian princess, a Swedish missionary, a Scottish colonel, a train conductor, a Hungarian Countess, an American businessman, and an American divorcée.\n\nThe veritable United Nations of accents the show requires is handled with varying degrees of success. At times, the accents got in the way of clarity, clean diction, and an understanding of clues, making some comic lines fall flat.\n\nStandouts in the eclectic group of possible murderers are Christa Schultz as the brash, loud, and obnoxious Minnesotan, Helen Hubbard. Schultz brings her considerable acting chops and comedic timing to the role. With her bright orange, satin dress, broad accent, and hip-swaying brashness, she commands every scene in which she appears.\n\nPortraying the beautiful Countess Andrenyi, who also just happens to be a doctor, Playhouse newcomer Sarah Blossom was elegant in bringing the mystery and contradictions of her character to life.\n\nDirector Julie Ahasay has assembled a talented cast (of all local actors) to take this ill-fated trip. Ahasay’s direction makes this a fun guessing game for the audience as they try to become amateur detectives to figure out the murderer's identity.\n\nMonsieur Bouc, director of the train company and friend to Poirot, becomes his “assistant” in sorting through the tangled clues and in dealing with all the idiosyncrasies and hysteria of the eccentric passengers. Michael Kraklio portrays a perfect, mostly calming presence who comically does have his own moments of sheer panic. His line delivery was always on point, with impeccable diction and projection.\n\nMike Pederson as the dandified Poirot, with the character’s iconic mustache, deftly portrays all the character’s fastidiousness, vanity, and ego.\n\nPersonifying Poirot’s reliance on his intelligence, conviction, and morality, Pederson makes strong comedic and dramatic choices. Ludwig described Poirot as having “ethics and eccentricities.” Pederson weaves both into his dignified detective.\n\nThere were a few instances of opening night wobbliness with a couple of miscues of raising train set pieces early, a clunky moving of a podium in the dark, and hesitancy in a few lines, but nothing that derailed the show.\n\nEspecially in Act One, the scene shifts of moving the train cars were slow and made the pacing slower. The show picked up steam, however, in Act Two.\n\nThe final dramatic scene, where Poirot gathers all the suspects to tell them who is guilty, was cleverly done with the repetition of significant lines that were important clues. One of Christie’s patented surprise twist endings brings the show to a satisfying close, with chaos restored to order, albeit with more than a little moral ambiguity.\n\nThe story’s inherent theatricality, Christie and Ludwig’s masterful writing, and an ensemble cast obviously having great fun in the storytelling, all made for an enjoyable mid-winter’s eve escape.\n\nThe show runs January 26- February 11. Most performances are sold out; a few tickets remain for select performances.

Her production of William Shakespeare’s Taming of the Shrew at East High School won the National High School Theater award from the BRAVO television network.\n\nHaving written theater, music, dance, and opera reviews for the Duluth News Tribune for many years, she now is the Arts & Entertainment Editor for Destination Duluth.\n\nBoat Club Productions’ A Don’t Hug Me Christmas Carol\n\nTurns the Dickens’ Classic Upside-Down\n\nIs the Boat Club Production’s of A Don’t Hug Me Christmas Carol a preposterous parody of Minnesotans, mocking life in the frozen tundra we call home, and making fun of snowmobilers, small-town bars, and (gasp) even Charles Dickens’s immortal classic, A Christmas Carol ?\n\nYa sure, you betcha!\n\nWas much of the show’s bawdy and risqué humor absolutely groan-worthy?\n\nFor sure!\n\nOh, fer cryin’ out loud is this really a musical too?\n\nYup, you’ll want to be a-singing along with such show stoppers as “The Wheel is Turnin’ but the Hamster is Dead,” “Gramma Cut the Christmas Cheese,” “Gunner Fell Into an Ice Hole,” “I’m So Hosed,” and “I Love You More Than Football.”\n\nOkie, dokie then, here’s the “thin as ice” plot for the show. So, it is Christmas Eve in frosty Bunyan Bay, Minnesota. A few of the denizens of the local bar are downing a few suds and listening to crotchety, cranky Gunner (Michael Kraklio) get into yet another argument with his long-suffering wife, Clara (Tanya Moore).\n\nWhen Gunner storms out, climbs on his trusty Skidoo, and promptly goes through the ice, he ends up in the hospital in a coma. And like his literary counterpart, the “wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner,” Ebenezer Scrooge, Gunner is visited by three spirits who make him realize what his life and wife really mean to him.\n\nKraklio fully embodies the Christmas-hating bah-humbugging Scrooge alter ego character. And while he spends much of the show sitting in a corner in a hospital gown, watching the alternate realities of what his life could become, Kraklio convincingly throws in his snarky punchlines and comments to the audience’s delight.\n\nAt the heart of the show, Tanya Moore’s Clara follows in the footsteps of classic sitcom wives who should have left their jerk husbands long since. Think Edith and Archie Bunker in All in the Family; Alice and Ralph Kramden in The Honeymooners; Peg and Al Bundy from Married with Children, and even the cartoon characters of Marge and Homer Simpson.\n\nMoore shows all the shades of Clara’s sweet, kind, and understanding nature, finally coming to a breaking point. After putting up for years with Gunner’s foul temper, she makes the audience root for her to find someone better to share her life. Moore also has a beautiful voice, not always given the best chance to shine with the silly songs.\n\nAbsolutely in her element, Christina Stroup is a scream as the town floozy, Bernice Lundstrom. The drunker her character becomes, the more audacious her over-the-top behavior ratchets up. She uses her Broadway belt voice well, even on cheesy songs with ridiculous and provocative lyrics.\n\nStroup has her biggest moments in the show portraying a hilarious Tiny Tim and later paying a comic tribute to Bernice’s idol in the song What Would Barbra Streisand Do?\n\nSupporting actors Chris Ibarra as the nitwit Kanute Gunderson, and Stuart Gordon playing the smarmy and suave Sven Jorgensen, are strong additions to this hard-working troupe of actors. They all do their best to wring out every nuance, innuendo, and double entendre in a ludicrous show that is definitely not Tony-award-winning material.\n\nWearing two hats for Don’t Hug Me (one of them a baseball cap, fer sure), Jason Vincent both produced and directed the show, in his directorial debut. His quick pacing made the show fly by in under two hours with intermission.\n\nHaving produced this same show last year, Vincent knew his audience well and how they would find this absurd show a stress reliever and a place to laugh out loud, in the hustle and bustle of the holiday season.\n\nAnd guffaw they did throughout, even when being insulted for wearing a baseball cap in the theater or when being “flashed” by the drunken Bernice.\n\nVincent even made a shameless plug in the show for his Boat Club restaurant, without missing a beat, gaining one of the biggest laughs of the night.\n\nOne of the true stars of the show is Jeff Brown and Curtis Phillips’ fabulous bar set. Looking every bit the seedy, tacky small-town hang-out, each element of the set decoration, from authentic beer signs to a deer head decorated for Christmas, created the perfect ambiance for this raucous, madcap romp.\n\nIs this show necessarily everyone’s cup of egg nog? Geez Louise, maybe not . . . but the sold-out house on opening night was buying what the cast was selling.\n\nTo keep the fun going after the show, the crowd happily headed straight to the August Fitger Room next door for libations and hors d oeuvres . . . cheese balls and crackers anyone?\n\nTo get in the spirit of the show, load up before on lutefisk, tater-tot hot dish (with a big dollop of top the tater), and jello salad with plenty o’ Reddi-Wip!\n\nOkay, youse guys and gals, put on your best flannel or favorite beer t-shirt, loosen your belt, and sit back for a wild ride on a “skidaddle” to Bunyan Bay’s tackiest establishment.\n\nDon’t cha’ know, if yer not busy goin’ to the “Cities,” out ice-fishin,’ or to a meat raffle or a potluck, you have a few more chances to catch A Don’t Hug Me Christmas Carol before last call at the bar!\n\nInformation on A Don’t Hug Me Christmas Carol\n\nWith book and lyrics by Phil Olson\n\nDATES: December 8-17, 2023\n\nSHOWTIMES: December 8-9 7:30 pm | December 10 2:00 pm\n\nDecember 14-16 7:30 pm | December 17 2:00 pm\n\nLOCATION: Spirit of the North Theatre, Historic Fitger’s Building – 3rd Floor\n\nTICKETS: (218) 623-7065 or at boatclubproductions.com\n\nThis production does contain adult humor and may not be suitable for children.\n\nNext up for Boat Club Productions:\n\n“For the Love of Theatre” A Theatre Gala on Friday, February 6, 2024\n\nWith A Sneak Peek of Boat Club’s 2024 Season\n\nTickets available at 218-623-7065 or boatclubproductions.com\n\n100 percent of the profits going to benefit Boat Club Productions\n\n_____\n\nAbout Sheryl Jensen - Arts & Entertainment Editor\n\nA retired educator with the Duluth Public Schools, Sheryl Jensen has been a theater director of over 60 school and community productions.

With its plucky heroine, brave hero, a septet of endearing children, cloister full of singing nuns, and its sentimental look back at the old-fashioned book musical, the show is destined to be a perennial favorite.\n\nThe Playhouse orchestra and cast delivered from the first note of the nun’s chorus, bringing the audience back to the true story of the von Trapp family, with songs that many in the audience would have gladly sung along with the cast.\n\nCurtis Phillips’ single von Trapp villa set was truly majestic and stately. It did, however, seem limiting for some scenes, especially at times such as Maria’s opening title song, “The Sound of Music,” meant to be sung with a backdrop of the awe-inspiring Alps and countryside she so loves. Having her walk down steps in an interior set lost some of the song’s impact, even with a few shadowy Alp mountains dimly seen through the interior set’s windows.\n\nJeff Brown’s lighting helped to create mood and time, and worked to enhance the story-telling. Particularly effective was the bold lightning as the impetus for the von Trapp children to tumble into Maria’s bed and gleefully sing “The Lonely Goatherd.”\n\nBalancing the orchestra and the cast especially well, sound designer Nick Gossen kept the dialogue and lyrics crisp and clear throughout. Under the direction of Kyle Picha, the orchestra was a wonderful accompaniment to the singers, never overwhelming them, but providing the fullness and liveliness that Rodgers’ score deserves.\n\nTrue to period style throughout, costume designer Peg Ferguson had fun with the children’s matching outfits with their sailor suits and their cute play clothes made from Maria’s curtains. From the nuns’ habits with every tunic, wimple, coif, and veil in place, to the menacing Nazi uniform with the glaring red swastika on the sleeve and threatening jackboots, Ferguson’s costumes were also essential to evoke time and place.\n\nThe children are double cast, alternating shows. Opening night had the “Green” cast with Liesl (Abrianna Schmidt); Frederich (Dane Ottjes); Louisa.(Addy Wheeler); Kurt (Cole Ottjes); Brigitta (Gigi Calland): Marta (Norah Pierson) and Gretl (Ada Sather).\n\nFrom the youngest to the oldest, each of the children had a chance to shine, with the septet of von Trapp children clearly an audience favorite throughout. Sather, as the tiny blond-haired Gretl, was absolutely adorable, starting from her first moment on stage when she gave a little wave to family in the front row.\n\nSchmidt’s shy but ready-to-be grown-up Liesl, with Greyson Holste as Rolf in their “Sixteen Going on Seventeen” song is an early moment of sweet innocence, later contrasted with the literal and figurative darkness in the show’s last scene.\n\nAlyson Enderle, with her boundless energy, earnestness, and vulnerability, paired with her sense of mischief and play, made the role of Maria her own. Showing the transformative power of music and love, Enderle was the heart and soul of the show.\n\nWith her charming songs with the children, in her unguarded solos, and in her sweeter moments with the Captain, she used the power and nuance of her voice to command the stage and show all the facets of Maria’s inner life and her growing feelings for the children and the Captain.\n\nAs the domineering Captain von Trapp with his incessant whistle, Jace Le Garde’s powerful voice was undeniably a musical highlight. While he seemed a bit young for the role, he made the most of each song with his gorgeous voice, especially in the heartbreaking anthem of patriotism in “Edelweiss,” wanting desperately to bless his homeland, about to be lost to the Nazi encroachment.\n\nThe nun’s full chorus had breathtaking harmonies in each of their songs. In the role of the Mother Abbess, Lacy Sauter’s pure, warm, and soaring soprano voice and her stratospheric final note in “Climb Ev’ry Mountain” brought well-deserved, and roaring applause to end the first act. Reprising it with the nuns as the von Trapp family starts their ascent to escape through the Alps was inspirational at show’s end.\n\nAlthough The Sound of Music was written over sixty years ago about events that happened over eighty years ago, it is tragically as current and heart-wrenching as today’s headlines, with displaced and terrorized innocents in more than one war zone, running in fear of their lives. The musical is a beacon of light, showing the best of the human spirit, determination, and will to survive against all the darkest forces of evil, hate, and tyranny.\n\nWith all 14 performances of THE SOUND OF MUSIC nearly completely sold out, they have added TWO extra performances on Wednesdays, December 6 and 13.

Her production of William Shakespeare’s Taming of the Shrew at East High School won the National High School Theater award from the BRAVO television network.\n\nHaving written theater, music, dance, and opera reviews for the Duluth News Tribune for many years, she now is the Arts & Entertainment Editor for Destination Duluth.\n\nCSS's The Comedy of Errors Is Filled with Double Trouble\n\nThe College of St. Scholastica (CSS) opened their run on Friday night of William Shakespeare’s first comedy and one of his earliest plays, The Comedy of Errors.\n\nComedy has a preposterous plot with ridiculous complications, all devolving into complete and utter chaos. Shakespeare requires that the audience to suspend disbelief that identical twin brothers and their two identical twin servants, shipwrecked and separated as young children, would all end up in the same town a few decades later. Each pair of brothers is meant to be dressed exactly alike, and each is completely oblivious to the presence of the other.\n\nAs it is Shakespeare’s shortest play (Friday night it ran 75 minutes, without intermission) and with its broad comedy and colorful characters, it is accessible for audiences and also for younger and sometimes less experienced actors to give it a go. Its mistaken identities, broad gags, and crowd-pleasing nonsense make it a popular choice as “entry-level” Shakespeare.\n\nAccording to the CSS Theatre Program Mission Statement, included in the show’s program, they are “distinguished from professional actor preparation. programs in that the production selection is firmly grounded in academic, not populist plays.” It also states that they look at theatre as a component of a liberal arts education.\n\nThe cast of CSS alumni and current students have a broad range of majors from computer science to nursing, biochemistry to social work. None of them is planning on life in professional theatre with a major and a wide variety of supporting coursework.\n\nWith that in mind, I applaud that the cast had obviously worked diligently on their line memorization and acting choices and were truly earnest as a group to tell the story to the best of their abilities. Shakespeare is not easy—the Bard is hard, and it was obvious that the cast and team had done a lot of work to get to opening night.\n\nPlaying the two “rich” brothers, Tom Rajcula (Antipholus of Syracuse) and his counterpart Jacob Barto (Antipholus of Ephesus) had the best facility with the language. Both were commanding and mature presences onstage, and while they did not look all that much alike, they were convincing in their roles.\n\nThe two beleaguered twin servants, Dromio of Syracuse (Dawson Ness) and Dromio of Epesus (Michael Schmidt) seemed to be having the most fun onstage and by extension gave the audience the most to laugh at.\n\nThe two actors portrayed well the bewilderment and confusion of trying to complete the tasks assigned by their masters, while each was the wrong servant for the wrong master at the wrong time.\n\nAudrey Eklof (Luciana) had wonderful facial expressions and had a good grasp on her unmarried sister role, who finds herself attracted to her sister Adriana’s husband when it is really his long-lost brother. Rylan Klomp (Duchess Solinus) with her elegant costume, was also strong in her role as the stern, but benevolent leader of Ephesus.\n\nMore creative and dynamic approaches to design and direction, however, could have made the show more vibrant. Blocking, staging, setting, and costume period choices were, at times, limiting in terms of showing something new for this play and its audiences.\n\nIt would have helped to more clearly establish the setting. The seaside setting was the one word “Mediterranean” in the program, a few sound effects at the beginning of the show of seagulls and water, and some line references. Perhaps, a hectic port marketplace with wildly costumed Bohemian-style vendors plying their eclectic wares in overbrimming stalls, would have given a vivid setting in which to place the action.\n\nUnderscore music could have also made the atmosphere more dynamic, helped to create excitement, and also added to a sense of time and place.\n\nAs an audience, do you need to understand all the intricacies of iambic pentameter, blank verse, and antiquated references that your hard-working English teacher tried so hard to make you care about to enjoy Shakespeare?\n\nDecidedly and emphatically no.\n\nShakespeare can be enjoyed as a look at the foibles of al aspects of human nature even in modern day America. And giving audiences any chance to laugh in these difficult times is another way that theatre still remains relevant and important.\n\nShow Information\n\nThe CSS Theatre is located on the campus of The College of St. Scholastica in Duluth.

In the Ballet’s intimate Depot performance space, formerly used by the Playhouse’s Underground Theater, the audience could feel the dancers’ energy and intensity more intimately than in the Company’s usual large venue at the DECC.\n\nReading facial expressions, seeing up close the connections between company members, and even hearing the sounds of their feet and toe shoes on the floor made this experience different and exciting. The physical makeup of the brick walls, shadowy exits, and nooks and crannies of the space also helped create the mood of apprehension and dread.\n\nPoe the Ballet uses macabre and chilling Edgar Allan Poe stories as its source material and is choreographed by Minnesota Ballet’s Artistic Director Karl von Rabenau. He describes his adaptation as both a “literal” and, at times, “creative” interpretation. Effectively using dance, movement, and the talents of his Company, von Rabenau created an evening of sinister storytelling.\n\nIn the opening piece, “The Masque of the Red Death,” a mysterious and fatal disease has been sweeping across the kingdom of Prince Prospero. Locking the gates of his palace, with a few select guests inside, they party, dance, eat, and ignore the chaos and tragedy outside, feeling safe and smug that the “red death” cannot enter.\n\nWhen a beautiful and mysterious stranger dressed in bright red suddenly appears in their midst, one by one they are stricken and fall to their deaths. Kyra Olson, stunning in the persona of Death, dances elegantly en pointe as she “kills” with a slight gesture of her outstretched hand. Olson shows a coquettishness and charm at first and then her character’s unmoved and uncaring demeanor comes through as she goes about her appalling appointed task.\n\nBilled as “The Purloined Letter and More,” the second piece combines Poe’s famous detective story, his epic poem “The Raven,” and his chilling tale of murder and madness, “The Telltale Heart.”\n\nThe tragic story tells of a queen who has an affair with a priest, raising the ire and jealousy of a politician. He steals the letter the priest had written to the Queen, using it to blackmail her.\n\nXimena Azurmendi, resplendent in her sparkling jewels and gorgeous costume, is exquisite with her every movement, dance, and expression in showing the Queen’s joy of her hidden desire for the priest, her hatred for the smarmy politician, and her terror as his intentions and actions become more and more abusive.\n\nPlaying the male roles in this ill-fated triangle are Sean M. Sullivan as the Priest and Isaac Sharratt as the politician. Sullivan is convincing as his combination of infatuation with the queen conflicts with his obligations as a Priest.\n\nSharratt brings one of the strongest performances of the night, as he progressively descends into a dark world of madness and evil. His frustration and unrequited love lead to a tragic end. Sharratt’s unnerving looks, mixed with his character’s inherent ostentatiousness, and his villainous cape-swirling dance and movements, are mesmerizing.\n\nThe inclusion of “The Raven,” however, with a taped reading of the poem, work less well, when combined with the detective story. The “dark and dreary” piece works for tone-setting for the first few stanzas, but then seems less logical. Just combining “Letter” with “The Telltale Heart,” to show the internal turmoils of a guilty and ultimately murderous soul would have been a more cohesive fit.\n\nWhen a detective and two police officers enter the scene and chat with the Politician, a few moments of comic relief, before gruesome discovery, come in the form of a drunken dance from the Investigator, played by Brooke Bero, and two police officers, performed by Jessica Lopes and Victor Smith.\n\nThe triumph of the evening was undeniably the final piece, “The Pit and the Pendulum,” where costumes, set pieces, lighting, staging, acting, movement, and dance combine for this breathtaking pinnacle of terror.\n\nIt is the time of the Inquisition when poor souls, most innocent, are imprisoned, tortured, and often put to death. Opening with a ghastly white-masked group of Judges sitting at a lit table, where they are ready to pronounce sentence on The Accused (Matthew Frezzell),\n\nThe Judge’s movements, with at first just using their hands, arms, and upper bodies, are completely unnerving and set the tone for the unspeakable horrors yet to come. When they later move as a black-robed, intimidating hoard, they are even more dehumanizing and threatening.\n\nComic relief here comes in the form of three rats who befriend The Accused, share his scraps of food, and untie him from the torture table. Victor Smith, Brianna Crockett, and Taylor Phillips are funny and ultimately tragic as well.\n\nFrezzell’s performance alone is worth the price of admission. With his incredibly expressive face and his aspects of desperation and unspeakable fear, he portrays in excruciating detail, what it would be like in his place, alone in the dark, starving, wishing for death and fearing it at the same time.\n\nAnd Death does appear. Kyra Olson, again in her startling red costume, playing the role in this story as well. Reminiscent of the character of the Angel of Death, in the musical The Kiss of the Spider Woman, Olson is seductive and seemingly sympathetic at first. She and Frezzell perform a beautiful and prophetic pas de deux before she ties him again to the table to await his end, the sharp-bladed pendulum set to swing down to slice him in half.\n\nIt ends, however, a bit anti-climactically, without any sign of a pendulum. A representative dancer’s body, held aloft with a swinging and menacing arm would have been a spine-chilling last picture.\n\nFor Minnesota Ballet’s longtime season ticket holders or for those experiencing what the Minnesota Ballet has to offer for the first time, this Halloween season production offers both its “tricks” and its “treats.”\n\n*Note: Some roles are doubled and will be played by different dancers on alternate nights. This review is based on the October 20 opening night performance. Performances continue October 21-22 and October 26-29.\n\nThe Nutcracker: A Duluth Tale, a favorite holiday tradition, is up next for the Minnesota Ballet, back onstage at the DECC in Symphony Hall, December 8-10.

Her production of William Shakespeare’s Taming of the Shrew at East High School won the National High School Theater award from the BRAVO television network.\n\nHaving written theater, music, dance, and opera reviews for the Duluth News Tribune for many years, she now is the Arts & Entertainment Editor for Destination Duluth.\n\n“The frankest and freest product of the human mind and heart is a love letter,\" wrote Mark Twain. Sadly, the love letter has all but disappeared in the age of texts, tweets, video chats, and generic greeting cards.\n\nThe love letter is, however, very much alive and well in A.R Gurney’s 1988 two-person play Love Letters at Fitger’s Spirit of the North Theatre.\n\nGurney insisted that Love Letters requires “no theatre, no lengthy rehearsal, no special set, no memorization of lines.” The Boat Club production, with work from designers Jeff Brown and Curtis Phillips, does add some beautiful set pieces to give richness to the contrasting environments in which the two characters read their letters to each other.\n\nDirector Jonathan Manchester cast two favorite actors from the Twin Ports theater scene for these challenging roles, Michael Kraklio and Julie Ahasay. Both bring a wealth of acting experience to this show and, for Ahasay, also a number of directing gigs. Manchester too brings his varied theatrical background of acting and directing to guide his actors through a story of love, wrong turns, and fate.\n\nSince its first performance in 1988, when the play was presented at the New York Public Library, with the author himself and actress Holland Taylor playing the roles, it has become a staple of community, regional, and professional theater, including on Broadway. Love Letters was also a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in Drama in 1990.\n\nThe list of some of the big-name actors who have taken on these two parts is impressive and includes: Carol Burnett and Brian Dennehy; Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels; Katharine Ross and Sam Elliott; Alan Alda and Candice Bergen; Rita Wilson and Tom Hanks; Sally Field and Bryan Cranston; and Elizabeth Taylor and James Earl Jones, among a legion of others.\n\nThe biggest challenge of the show is for the actors to bring these two complex characters to life, through only the reading of cards and letters that they write to each other over the fifty years of their relationship. For the most part, the two actors sit and read the letters, not looking at each other throughout much of the play.\n\nKraklio has the less showy role as the conservative, shy, sometimes stuffy and hesitant Andrew Makepeace Ladd III. As his middle name suggests, he is more likely to make peace, than to face confrontation.\n\nKraklio best uses his comic acting chops in places like in his funny discussion of a groin pull that prevented him from dancing with Melissa.\n\nHe also shows well his true love of writing in his eloquent speeches about why he wants to write to Melissa.”I feel like a true lover when I'm writing you. This letter, which I'm writing with my own hand, with my own pen, in my own penmanship, comes from me and no one else, and is a present of myself to you.”\n\nKraklio shines when he talks about the importance of writing letters in amusing lines such as, “One thing about letters, you can’t hang up on them.” Melissa, of course, quickly retorts, “You can tear up the letters though, enclosed are the pieces.”\n\nWhile at times, Kraklio could have used more facial and vocal variance, he is truly wonderful as an effective foil, occasional adversary, dear friend, and finally, a remorseful lover, who realizes too late the years lost, not spent with his true soul mate.\n\nAhasay is in entirely in her element, showing the many sides of the prism that is Melissa, an awkward, rebellious, wild, artistic, troubled, and, at times, “lost princess,” a phrase that Andrew uses to describe her from the first time he saw her in elementary school.\n\nAhasay reflects Melissa’s entirely different view of writing letters in her own uninhibited way. “Why do they keep pushing us together then pulling us apart? I think we’re all being brought up by a bunch of foolish farts. Now we’ll have to write letters which I hate.”\n\nUsing her absolutely magnificent repertoire of facial expressions, Ahasay has many shades of emotion showing on her face, whether she is reading one of her own letters or listening and reacting to one of his.\n\nHer pacing, expression, and tone are demonstrative of her character’s petulance, anger, sadness, sense of humor, and ultimately her long unrequited love for her Andy.\n\nGurney, in praising actors who have played Andrew and Melissa, said, “What they do is a testament to the actor’s art. They just have the text. It’s like hang-gliding, they jump off the cliff and they fly. “\n\nBoth Kraklio and Ahasay do take the required leaps, and each of them delivers a performance that most often flies. Then the audience and their imaginations fill in the blanks between the lines to understand this tale of love land sadness, joy, and remorse, and these two flawed but fascinating people.\n\nThis play is both a love letter to the theater and an ode to the lost art of writing love letters. It deserves to be seen. A disappointment was the small number of audience members in attendance for opening night.\n\nIt is vital for audiences to also be patrons for the smaller arts organizations. Without the support of area audiences, it is challenging for these smaller organizations to continue to add their important piece to our theatrical and cultural landscape.\n\nBravo to producers like the Boat Club’s Jason Vincent and to companies who sponsor and contribute to arts organizations, small and large.\n\nA Boat Club Production\n\nLove Letters by A.R.Gurney At Fitger’s Spirit of the North Theater\n\nSHOW DATES & TIMES September 22-23 7:30pm | September 24 2:00pm\n\nSeptember 28-30 7:30pm | October 1 2:00pm\n\nBox Office Phone Number: (218) 623-7065\n\nBuy tickets at boatclubrestaurant.com Click on tickets from main site menu.\n\nNext up for Boat Club Productions is A Don’t Hug Me Christmas Carol, running December 8-17.

Her production of William Shakespeare’s Taming of the Shrew at East High School won the National High School Theater award from the BRAVO television network.\n\nHaving written theater, music, dance, and opera reviews for the Duluth News Tribune for many years, she now is the Arts & Entertainment Editor for Destination Duluth.\n\nIt was a raucous evening of theater at the NorShor as the Duluth Playhouse opened their 2023-24 season with the Mel Brooks musical Young Frankenstein. The opening night crowd came ready to laugh, and the stellar cast was prepared to give them every opportunity to chuckle, chortle, cackle, and often downright howl and roar at the ridiculous shenanigans onstage.\n\nMel Brooks’ wildly successful 1974 film Young Frankenstein, a cult black-and-white classic, was the inspiration for him to write the music and lyrics for his musical version that opened on Broadway in 2007.\n\nWhen it went to London’s West End in 2017, the musical’s original creative team including Brooks himself, made some revisions and enhancements to the Broadway version. It is the celebrated West End version that the Playhouse used for their production.\n\nIn Young Frankenstein, Brooks made his signature use of every kind of humor possible: sight and running gags, physical comedy, puns, pratfalls, innuendos, double entendres, and often just plain naughty, bawdy, and occasionally downright raunchy dialogue and lyrics. The Playhouse cast does justice to them all, playing to an appreciative audience of both people who seemed to know almost every line and bit to first-timers.\n\nWith this musical, Brooks also wanted to parody Broadway-style tunes, Golden Age movie musicals, and Universal Films’ classic black-and-white monster and horror movies of the 1930s. While using the classic characters of Frankenstein lore, Brooks brings it to a second generation when a young Doctor Frankenstein, mortified by his father’s legacy, returns to Transylvania when he inherits the family castle.\n\nWes Drummond, Executive Director at the Playhouse, both directed and choreographed the show. His direction is crisp, sharp, and as Brooks intended, on-point with parodies of the original source material of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, Boris Karloff’s Frankenstein, and the later sequels of Bride of Frankenstein and Son of Frankenstein.\n\nKeeping the pace fast throughout, Drummond and his exceptional cast take the audience on a runaway ride of nonstop hilarity from start to finish. His choreography is equally on point, with its peak in the show’s signature tap-dancing mega-production number, “Putting On the Ritz,” that brought some of the opening night audience to their feet.\n\nLeading the troupe of madcap players is Equity actor Kyle Weiler playing Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (or Fronkensteen, as the character repeatedly insists). Paying homage to the film’s young Frankenstein Gene Wilder, Weiler’s curly, wild mane of hair becomes an unbilled character in itself. Yet, he makes the role his own, without trying to be a carbon copy of Wilder’s performance..\n\nWeiler is indeed a triple threat as a dancer, a singer, and an actor. A Julliard graduate in dance, and a veteran of the original Broadway cast and three National Tours of Hamilton (as a Universal Swing and Dance Captain), his every move is that of a dancer who is in complete control of the demanding physical aspects of the role, throwing his body around with wild abandon one minute and then dancing with complete finesse the next.\n\nHis voice is also completely up to the task, ranging from a fast almost rap style in “The Brain” and a leading man’s panache and power in “Frederick’s Soliloquy.”\n\nWeiler is believable every second, acting a role that, in turns, requires him to be panicked and nearly maniacal, to tender and sweet, and then back to frenzy and despair. Always in command of every line, pitch, tone, gesture and nuance, Weiler’s performance was a true star turn for an actor who deserves more leading roles.\n\nHis sidekick Igor (or Eyegor as he also demands), played brilliantly by Sif Oberon, is the Doctor’s constant companion. Oberon is impressive in a physically demanding role, requiring them to be bent over and having to drag themself back and forth with alacrity across the stage as the Doctor’s faithful flunky.\n\nOberon doesn’t miss a beat with their accented delivery, grim and often menacing facial expressions, and having to keep track of the mysteriously shifting hump on their back. Again, while many in the audience were aware of Marty Feldman’s masterful performance of the character in the film, Oberon too does their own distinct take with the role.\n\nThe actresses who play the musical’s leading women’s roles are also on top of their games. Hope Nordquist plays Inga, the sexy assistant to the Doctor. She becomes an irresistible temptation to him from the first when she sings and yodels about the joys of a “roll in the hay” while the couple bounces around on a wild hayride to the castle.\n\nNordquist is a delightful foil to the Doctor’s uptight fiancée Elizabeth played by Lacy Sauter Sauter has an incredible soprano voice, clearly showing her soaring range and power from playing major roles in both opera and theater.\n\nSauter’s acting chops are also on display when she goes from being a prude in her song “Please Don’t Touch Me” at the beginning of the show to a sex-crazed nymphomaniac at show’s end, after her “encounters” with the Monster with her song, the blush-inducing “Deep Love.”\n\nJanet Rowney was an audience favorite, playing the castles’s mysterious housekeeper Frau Blücher whose very name induces wild, high-pitched whinnying from horses. Rowney’s hilarious Cabaret and Marlene Dietrich style song,“He Vas My Boyfriend,” laments her lost love, the original Dr. Frankenstein.\n\nRecreating the iconic monster himself, Phillip Hoelscher had the “gigantic” task of walking on mile-high boots and making guttural vocalizations reflecting his emotions without saying a word. While lacking some of the monster’s beefier physicality, Hoelscher conveyed both the threatening and sweet nature of the bewildered creature.\n\nHoelscher’s standout laugh-inducing moment was in “Putting on the Ritz,” where, without giving too much away, he becomes the lead song and danceman, joined by the entire cast in true Broadway musical style.\n\nJeff Brown’s sets provide creative locales, varying from a boat dock, to the woods, from different locales in the creepy castle, to a hermit’s cottage. Brown designed each to be visually impressive and, at the same time, easy to shift to a new scene.\n\nBrown’s lighting was another powerful contribution to the show’s success. Using everything from old-fashioned, footlight-style instruments, to atmospheric castle shadows, and the eerie lighting of the Doctor’s chamber of horrors, Brown’s evocative lighting kept the audience in the moment.\n\nThe only thing lacking was some sort of definitive electrification, major lighting style bolt going into the Monster’s body for that bringing him “alive” critical moment.\n\nThe show’s ensemble took advantage of chances to shine playing everything from medical students, to pitchfork-wielding villagers, to a Broadway chorus line.\n\nKudos to Peg Ferguson for creating gorgeous costumes for all the residents of Transylvania and for the leads, reflecting hours of work for her and her talented volunteer seamstresses.\n\nBravo to the wonderful orchestra, led by music director Kyle Picha, meeting the challenges of playing all the different styles of music that the score requires. Special mention to violin player Lian Ojakangas for some truly beautiful solos.\n\nOn a personal note\n\nMy first encounter with Young Frankenstein was in its pre-Broadway run in Seattle in 2007 which featured the Broadway cast of some amazing stars including Sutton Foster (Inga), Andrea Martin (Frau Blücher), and Megan Mullally (Elizabeth Benning).\n\nThe night I saw it, Mel Brooks himself was in the audience a few rows ahead of us, laughing uproariously at his own musical reboot of his movie classic. I think that Brooks, even at age 97, would find the Playhouse production as hilarious and audacious as his own.\n\nYoung Frankenstein at the Duluth Playhouse NorShor Theatre runs now through October 1.
