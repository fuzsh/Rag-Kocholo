        "text": "The Federal Archives is continuously working on the digitisation and online presentation of its written holdings. However, in light of the total amount of files stored within the Federal Archivs (more than 530 km), it is obvious that the majority of our documents will hardly be accessible in digitised from within the next few years. When we look at younger personal data in particular, legal provisions can also be an obstacle to the online presentation.\n\nOn this page we offer you a current overview of the Federal Archives' fonds that have been digitised comletely or in part and are accessible online without any restrictions. The links we provide lead to our research tools invenio and ARGUS (expiring) where you will find the digitised files in the context in which they are described.\n\nThe list's order is following the structure of the Federal Archives' records groups - a mainly chronological order, followed by the personal papers and the special collections."
