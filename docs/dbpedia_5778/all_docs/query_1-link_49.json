        "text": "The Apostle Paul Church... is a neo-Gothic brick church building. It was built between 1892 and 1894 on what was then Prinz-Heinrich-Platz according to designs by the royal building councilor Franz Schwechten (note: he also designed the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church and helped plan the Anhalter Bahnhof).\n\nThe church was inaugurated on December 29, 1894. The church, in a historicized Gothic style, reminiscent of Brandenburg tradition, is a listed building.\n\nToday the Apostle Paul parish is a parish in the Tempelhof-Sch√∂neberg church district of the Berlin district in the Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia.\n\nInteresting clergyman: \"On May 6, 1923, Eitel-Friedrich von Rabenau took up his post as second pastor at the Apostle Paul Church, where he served until 1954... After Jews and Christians, predominantly of Jewish descent, had to wear the yellow star from September 1, 1941, they were easily identified as churchgoers by the star. On December 22, 1941, the destroyed German Evangelical Church (DEK) called on the churches to take appropriate measures to exclude star wearers from all church events. This was not possible with Rabenau, so star wearers remained welcome in the Apostle Paul Church.\"\n\nSource de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostel-Paulus-Kirche_(Berlin-Sch%C3%B6neberg)\n\nThis Berlin church was dedicated to Saint Paul. He was initially an opponent of the Christian movement and was not called to the apostleship by Jesus Christ during his lifetime like the other apostles, but was only converted later with the famous \"Damascus experience\" (see Acts of the Apostles, Chapter 9).\n\nHis attribute, with which he is usually depicted in paintings or as a statue, is the sword with which he was executed. According to the Roman law of the time, such a sentence was a \"privilege\" (quick death and not, like other types of execution, associated with a long, painful death struggle) that was available to the citizens of Rome.\n\nPeter (Peter) is also known together with Paul as the \"prince of the apostles\"; their common memorial day in the calendar of saints is June 29th."
