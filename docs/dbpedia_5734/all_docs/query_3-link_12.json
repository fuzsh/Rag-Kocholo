        "text": "Broadcast call signs are call signs assigned as unique identifiers to radio stations and television stations. While broadcast radio stations will often brand themselves with plain-text names, identities such as \"cool FM\", \"rock 105\" or \"the ABC network\" are not globally unique. Another station in another city or country may (and often will) have a similar brand, and the name of a broadcast station for legal purposes is normally its internationally recognised ITU call sign. Some common conventions are followed around the world.\n\nAsia[]\n\nBoizenkau[]\n\nBoizenkau uses the BL prefix since 1950. It can only used for Television and Radio.\n\nDischia[]\n\nBoxland[]\n\nBoxland uses the J9 prefix, followed by four letters. They were rarely used however, as the station's name is mostly used instead.\n\nExamples:\n\nJ9TVIB: Televisión de Interboxia\n\nFuntenia[]\n\nAlthough Funtenia originally used Lucianian call signs, this changed upon its independence in 2023, when it started using the O3 prefix following by a three-letter sequence and using the same two-letter suffixes as Luciania, with one addition being \"-NT\" for NTSC-M simulcasts (as \"-TV\" is already used for PAL-A broadcasts).\n\nExamples:\n\nO3FNF-TV: Funtimesreichisch Nationales Fernsehen (PAL-A)\n\nO3FNF-NT: Funtimesreichisch Nationales Fernsehen (NTSC-M)\n\nO3FNF-DT: Funtimesreichisch Nationales Fernsehen (digital)\n\nGabesia[]\n\nGabesian stations use the H5 prefix, followed by three letters.\n\nExamples:\n\nH5GTV: Gabesia Televisión\n\nH5RDG: Radio Gabesia\n\nJosesia[]\n\nInterestingly, Josesia is the only country in the world to use ones and zeroes on their call signs, something not allowed by the ITU; as of December 2023, this has yet to be resolved.\n\nThe pattern followed is similar to Luciania, except that the ITU prefix is O1 and the time zone is instead two digits of negative UTC (despite all time zones in Josesia only having one digit), albeit not subtracted by any number. Also similar to Luciania is networks mostly identifying to them by name.\n\nExamples:\n\nO1JO06-TV: Josesia Televisión (UTC-6; analog TV)\n\nO1AM05-DT: Canal Amatista (UTC-5; digital TV)\n\nLuciania[]\n\nIn Luciania, radio and TV stations use an ITU prefix of E8, followed by a two-letter sequence (usually an abbreviation of the station's name, depending on the language), a number showing the time zone in negative UTC subtracted by 4, ending with \"-AM\" for AM radio, \"-FM\" for FM radio, \"-TV\" for analog television, \"-DT\" for digital television and \"-DR\" for digital radio. Despite this, like Europe, they're usually only identified with names, and that call signs were mostly used in test cards and documents.\n\nExamples:\n\nE8UL4-TV: UDL TV (Luciani; UTC-8; analog TV)\n\nE8UD5-DT: UDL TV (Spanish; UTC-9; digital TV)\n\nE8RL5-FM: Radio Luciania (Luciani; UTC-9; FM radio)\n\nE8RA5-AM: Radio Luciania (Spanish; UTC-9; AM radio)\n\nE8RP5-DR: Lucianska Radio Polska (Polish; UTC-9; digital radio)\n\nNicoland[]\n\nThe former Republic of Nicoland used the O2 prefix, followed by three letters, and an additional one indicating the medium (\"T\" for analog television, \"D\" for digital television, \"F\" for FM radio and \"A\" for AM radio). After the country was bombed, it became a Lucianian state and therefore, started using Lucianian call signs.\n\nFormer examples:\n\nO2TVNT: Televisión Nicolandesa (analog)\n\nO2TVND: Televisión Nicolandesa (digital)\n\nYanoland[]\n\nYanoland uses the E9 prefix for both radio and television, followed by a three-letter sequence. Once again, they're usually only referred to by name, making Yanolandic call signs much more scarce.\n\nExample:\n\nE9TVY: Télévision Yanolandaise\n\nEurope[]\n\nLaotianlands[]\n\nBroadcast callsigns in the Laotianlands can begin with a B, G, L or M. No ITU prefixes are used. if one is required, then the RP prefix is used. Callsigns are usually 4 letters long, with some older 3 letter callsigns still in use today.\n\nFM stations use the suffix \"-FM\", with TV stations using \"-TV\". AM and SW stations don't use suffixes, though stations simulcasting on AM and FM sometimes use the \"-AM-FM\" suffix.\n\nDAB and National analogue radio stations do not use callsigns.\n\nExamples[]\n\n3 letters[]\n\nBOW: Bow Classic Hits (AM)/Bow 100 (FM)\n\nMAY: MAY63 (AM)/Stereo MAY (FM)\n\nBFB: Classic Hits Hunden (AM)/DOI Radio Hunden (FM)\n\n4 letters[]"
