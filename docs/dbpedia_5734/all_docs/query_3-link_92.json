I believe the FM staions have 3 letters such as the famous Triple J.\n\nThere have been examples of UK stations emulating American call letters - BRMB and WABC in the West Midlands spring to mind.\n\nAnd was there not a fort based 60's pirate which called itself Britain's Better Music Station aka BBMS\n\n0\n\nThere have been examples of UK stations emulating American call letters - BRMB and WABC in the West Midlands spring to mind.\n\nAnd was there not a fort based 60's pirate which called itself Britain's Better Music Station aka BBMS\n\nWhich makes me wonder if it would be legal under ITU for a MW station in the UK to emulate call signs from other countries.\n\nI can see some North American scratching his head one evening if the frequency comes close to *0 Khz.\n\nI read somewhere once Aussie stations sometimes make up a call sign even though they have one assigned to them.\n\n0\n\n2CR name originally came from 'Two Counties Radio\" and wasn't a call sign that the licensing authority issued.\n\nAmerican stations used their call signs as there were so many stations that interference was often caused and something distinct was necessary to identify which stations was which - regular names only would not have sufficed. Many 'heritage' calls did opaquely refer to the stations though - like the station in Chicago owned by a newspaper which was WGN - Worlds Greatest Newspaper, and is still all news today. Same city has WLS 0n 890 AM which was owned by Sears, the Worlds Largest Store.\n\nThe Uk had nothing like the interference problems, and I dare say the pedestrian style of presentation and frequent long breaks in transmission, not to mention the ID \"This is the BBC\" meant there was rarely any confusion, so no need for call signs. They could not be mandatory, as there is no global licensing authority. The ITU is a talking shop and international 'treaty' body with no bite or power at all beyond that which each state deems to confer on it.\n\nThe US FCC still insists on regular station IDs, something the UK doesn't bother with.\n\n0"
