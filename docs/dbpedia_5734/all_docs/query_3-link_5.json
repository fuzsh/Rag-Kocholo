        "text": "I believe this is the applicable regulation, if anyone is bored:\n\n----------------\n\n47 CFR\n\nSec. 90.425 Station identification.\n\nStations licensed under this part shall transmit identification in\n\naccordance with the following provisions:\n\n(a) Identification procedure. Except as provided for in paragraphs\n\n(d) and (e) of this section, each station or system shall be identified\n\nby the transmission of the assigned call sign during each transmission\n\nor exchange of transmissions, or once each 15 minutes (30 minutes in the\n\nPublic Safety Pool) during periods of continuous operation. The call\n\nsign shall be transmitted by voice in the English language or by\n\nInternational Morse Code in accordance with paragraph (b) of this\n\nsection. If the station is employing either analog or digital voice\n\nscrambling, or non-voice emission, transmission of the required\n\nidentification shall be in the unscrambled mode using A3E, F3E or G3E\n\nemission, or International Morse, with all encoding disabled.\n\nPermissible alternative identification procedures are as follows:\n\n(1) A mobile relay stations call sign may be used to identify the\n\nassociated control and mobile stations, except in the Public Safety Pool\n\nwhere the stations operate on frequencies below 450 MHz. Alternatively,\n\na base station (including a mobile relay station) which is controlled by\n\nradio may be identified by the transmission of the call sign of the\n\nstation at which communications originate.\n\n(2) One or more fixed relay stations may be identified by the\n\ntransmission of the call signs of the stations at which the\n\ncommunications originate.\n\n(3) When a mobile station transmits on a different frequency than\n\nits associated base station, the assigned call sign of either the mobile\n\nstation or the base station may be transmitted. Further, a single mobile\n\nunit in the licensee's authorized geographic area of operation may\n\ntransmit station identification on behalf of any other operating mobile\n\nunits in the fleet.\n\n(4) Use of an identifier other than the assigned call sign. (i) In\n\nthe Public Safety Pool, mobile units licensed to a governmental entity\n\nand which operate on frequencies above 30 MHz may use an identifier\n\nwhich contains, at a minimum, the name of the licensee if the licensee\n\nmaintains at the station a list of the special identifiers to be used by\n\nthe mobile units.\n\n(ii) In the Industrial/Business Pool, licensees may request the\n\nCommission's local Engineer-in-Charge to approve the use of special\n\nmobile unit identifiers in lieu of the assigned call sign. Such\n\nrequests, however, will not\n\n[[Page 414]]\n\nbe granted where it appears that harmful interference to international\n\noperations may be caused by stations below 50 MHz, or by stations\n\noperating in areas within 80 km (50 miles) of an international boundary,\n\nor where it appears that the proposed method of identification will not\n\nadequately distinguish the mobile units of the applicant from the mobile\n\nunits of other licensees in the area.\n\n(iii) In the Industrial/Business Pool, railroad licensees (as\n\ndefined inSec. 90.7) may identify stations by the name of the railroad\n\nand the train number, caboose number, engine number, or the name of the\n\nfixed wayside station. If none of these forms are practicable, any\n\nsimilar name or number may be designated by the railroad concerned for\n\nuse by its employees in the identification of fixed points or mobile\n\nunits; Provided, That, a list of such identifiers is maintained by the\n\nrailroad. An abbreviated name or the initials of the railroad may be\n\nused where such are in general usage. In those areas where it is shown\n\nthat no difficulty would be encountered in identifying the transmission\n\nof a particular station (as, for example, where stations of one licensee\n\nare located in a yard isolated from other radio installations), approval\n\nmay be given to a request from the licensee for permission to omit the\n\nstation identification.\n\n(5) Use of identifiers in addition to assigned call signs. Nothing\n\nin this section shall be construed as prohibiting the transmission of\n\nstation or unit identifiers which may be necessary or desirable for\n\nsystem operation, Provided, That, they are transmitted in addition to\n\nthe assigned station call sign or other permissible form of\n\nidentification.\n\n(b) Use of automatic Morse code identification equipment.\n\nAutomatically activated equipment may be used to transmit station\n\nidentification in International Morse Code pursuant to the following\n\nconditions:\n\n(1) The signal output of the automatic identification equipment\n\nshall be connected to the transmitter at the microphone input or any\n\nother manufacturer-provided signal input terminal and shall be adjusted\n\nto produce 40 percent 10 percent of the maximum\n\npermissible modulation or deviation level. This adjustment shall be\n\nperformed when all other modulating signals are absent.\n\n(2) The Morse code transmission rate shall be maintained between 20\n\nand 25 words per minute.\n\n(3) The frequency of the keyed tone comprising the identification\n\nsignal shall be 1200 800 Hz. A licensee may be\n\nrequired to change the frequency in order to prevent interference to the\n\noperations of another co-channel licensee.\n\n(4) Should activation of automatic Morse code identification\n\nequipment interrupt the communications of another co-channel licensee,\n\nthe Commission may require the use of equipment which will delay\n\nautomatic station identification until such co-channel communications\n\nare completed.\n\n(c) Special provisions for identification in the Radiolocation\n\nService. (1) Stations in the Radiolocation Service are not required to\n\nidentify except upon specific instruction from the Commission or as\n\nrequired by paragraph (c)(2) of this section.\n\n(2) Stations in the Radiolocation Service operating on frequencies\n\nabove3400 kHz that employ spread spectrum techniques shall transmit a\n\ntwo-letter manufacturer's designator, authorized by the Commission on\n\nthe station authorization, at the beginning and ending of each\n\ntransmission and once every 15 minutes during periods of continuing\n\noperation. The designator shall be transmitted in International Morse\n\nCode at a speed not exceeding 25 words per minute, and the spread\n\nspectrum mode of operation shall be maintained while the designator is\n\nbeing transmitted. The identifying signal shall be clearly receivable in\n\nthe demodulated audio of a narrow-band FM receiver.\n\n(d) General exemptions. A station need not transmit identification\n\nif:\n\n(1) It is a mobile station operating on the transmitting frequency\n\nof the associated base station.\n\n(2) It is a mobile station in the Public Safety Pool using F1E or\n\nG1E emission.\n\n(3) It is transmitting for telemetering purposes or for the\n\nactivation of devices which are employed solely as a means of attracting\n\nattention, or for\n\n[[Page 415]]\n\nremote control purposes, or which is retransmitting by self-actuating\n\nmeans, a radio signal received from another radio station or stations.\n\n(4) It is any type of radiopositioning or radar station authorized\n\nin a service other than the Radiolocation Service.\n\n(5) It is used solely for automatic vehicle monitoring or location.\n\n(6) It is a paging station authorized in accordance with the\n\nprovisions of Sec. 90.20(a)(2)(v).\n\n(7) It is a mobile station employing non-voice emissions and the\n\nassociated base station identifies on behalf of the mobile unit(s).\n\n(8) It is a base or mobile station in the 220-222 MHz band\n\nauthorized to operate on a nationwide basis in accordance with subpart T\n\nof this part.\n\n(9) It is a wireless microphone station operating in accordance with\n\nthe provisions of Sec. 90.265(b).\n\n(e) Special provisions for stations licensed under this part that\n\nare classified as CMRS providers under part 20 of this chapter.\n\n(1) Station identification will not be required for 929-930 MHz\n\nnationwide paging licensees or MTA or EA-based SMR licensees. All other\n\nCMRS stations will be required to comply with the station identification\n\nrequirements of this paragraph.\n\n(2) CMRS stations subject to a station identification requirement\n\nwill be permitted to use a single call sign for commonly owned\n\nfacilities that are operated as part of a single system. The call sign\n\nmust be transmitted each hour within five minutes of the hour, or upon\n\ncompletion of the first transmission after the hour.\n\n(3) CMRS stations granted exclusive channels may transmit their call\n\nsigns digitally. The station licensee must provide the Commission with\n\ninformation sufficient to decode the digital transmission to ascertain\n\nthe transmitted call sign.\n\n[43 FR 54791, Nov. 22, 1978]"
