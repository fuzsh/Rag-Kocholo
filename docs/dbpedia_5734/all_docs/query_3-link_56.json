        "text": "Water skiing while deployed and fighting Eagles out of Tyndall, Fl. Put in hack for two weeks, stood the duty...rode the pine...got the call sign.\n\nComment by one officer who caught me, \"Stupidist thing I've ever seen, also the funniest; now go to your room and I'll tell you when you can come out.\"\n\nI hear tell the Navy is scrubbing their call signs to comply with current convention... boring, inaccurate, meaningless, limp.\n\nNo, not from a carrier landing. It's from when I was off base, pulling out of a bar on my motorcycle and ended up getting clotheslined by the cable of a winch on a wrecker.\n\nThe bar was having a car towed, and this tow truck driver hooked up to it and was trying to pull it away from the edge of the lot enough to get in front of it. He just happened to be pulling it across the entrance and exit to the lot, and didn't see me pulling out, and threw tension on the cable...just as I was riding towards the exit. The cable stripped me off the seat of the motorcycle, in full view of two of my squadron mates.\n\nEarly days of GWOT, circa 2002. Young LT was older, non-Prior E, guy who was a Wall Street investment banker, or something similar. Very sure of himself... fit right in.\n\nHe was also \"Metro\" before the term had its peak as a pop culture movement, and he maintained the perfect shade of Bronze #5 from the local tanning salon. He was also decently in shape and like to think he was the next star at Magic Mike's Cabaret.\n\nHe decided his callsign, since he was \"fast\" and a badass, would be Cheetah ?\n\nThe Major wasn't having it... \"Bro! You're as orange as a corn pop...you're Cheeto!\"\n\nCrashes Into Pretty Huge Emergency Room (Girls).\n\nDude was towards the end of his service on the PC-21 and about to transition on the F/A-18. On one of his last flights he and the instructor overshot the runway laterally due to heavy raining, landing gear broke, the FI pulled the rear handle and ejected both of them.\n\nGets to the emergency room at the hospital to be checked on, they tell us we can visit him later. Whole training squadron wanted to check on him, not even one hour after being delivered to the medics we get the text message “I’m all fine” and two one time-watching videos on WhatsApp in which he was having sexual relations with two different (chubby) nurses.\n\nHence, his callsign from that day on. We had to invent a backup story to tell to the air force commander on graduation day when he asked about our callsigns."
