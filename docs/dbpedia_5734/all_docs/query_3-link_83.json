        "text": "Common practice is to give your own call sign last. So, if KA1ABC is calling KZ8ZYX, they'd call \"Kay zed eight zed wye ex, kay aeh one aeh bee cee.\"\n\nRegulations, however, don't require doing it this way. What US regs require is that you give your own call sign at least every ten minutes during an ongoing \"communication\" and at the end of the \"communication\". Obviously, you need to give the sign of the station you're calling, or they won't know they need to answer back (unless it's a sched QSO) -- but otherwise, if it's just \"Hey, buddy, just checking if you're awake,\" you could give your call only when you sign off and be perfectly legal.\n\nDoing it the common way is just a matter of convention.\n\nI'd recommend saying something like this, \"This is KA1ABC calling KZ8ZYX\". HAM radio can be very conversational. We call it \"rag chewing\" but that term is just part of the jargon that evolves in almost every hobby or profession.\n\nOutside some contests where people are trying to make as many contacts as possible with in a time limit using a specific verbiage you don't have to be overly rigid in your communications.\n\nAs you should know the regulations require you to give your call sign at least every 10 minutes and at the end of every conversation. Most people find it works better if they also give it at the beginning of the conversation so we know who is talking.\n\nI would avoid the stereotypical \"CB lingo\" that we some times run into. Most people find it incredibly annoying and at least a few will make those feelings known. The same goes for the \"10 codes\" that public service sometimes uses.\n\nI'd even be careful about Q codes that HAM radio operators do use. You can always ask, \"where do you live\" instead of \"what is your QTH\".\n\nI believe it is conventional to do as they do with HF transmissions. You should give your call sign last and their call sign before -from-.\n\n[content of the message] [their call sign] from [your call sign]\n\nso something very similar to: \"Is this simplex frequency in use? [Friend's call] from [your call]?\"\n\nRemember that on simplex calling(checking a supposedly empty band) you should turn your squelch down or off."
