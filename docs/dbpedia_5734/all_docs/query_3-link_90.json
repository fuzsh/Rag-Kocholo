        "text": "PD1WP\n\nIf got a question.\n\nThe settings section has a a rule \"Allow only DMR-ID's as C4FM witch i can check. He is un-checkt now. What is the purpose and must i check this option. If got a TYT MD-390 with\" Travisgoodspeed\" running on it. Now i can't see the callsign during a QSO on C4FM (YSF or FCS). I it possible to explain me that option so i can use that function. Thanks for your time to answer my questions. 73ers from Apeldoorn the Netherlands. PD1WP\n\nHA2NON\n\nIf you check that checkbox, then only those C4FM calls coming from a radio are allowed which source callsign is a number (which can be parsed as a DMR ID).\n\nFor example, if the setting is enabled, and your C4FM radio's callsign is \"PD1WP\", then you won't be able to access openSPOT. If your C4FM radio's callsign is \"12345\" then you will be able to access it, as openSPOT will use the DMR ID \"12345\" for your call.\n\nIf the setting is not enabled, and your C4FM radio's callsign is \"PD1WP\", then the \"Default DMR ID for C4FM calls\" setting is used as your DMR ID.\n\nPD1WP\n\nThe only thing i see when i receive a incomming call from the C4FM Network YSF-Almere is 9998 -> TG9 Echo (NCPRN). But when i check the dashboard i see the Callsign. must i change the setting is the openSPOT to receive more information on my display. The other station is receiving all my information in its display. there is no manual available whit the correct settings because the BÃ©ta firmware. i don't know what i can do to fix this. thank you for your time.

My Email adress : pd1wp.apeldoorn@gmail.com\n\nHA2NON\n\nThe callsign for the C4FM call coming from openSPOT will only be displayed on a radio which supports talker alias (currently only Hytera radios).\n\nPD1WP\n\nBut why can others users with c4fm radio's see my callsign and works it not backwards?\n\nYesterday i tested it with a station and he owed a Yeasu radio. He saw my callsign in his display.. I have a TYT MD-390. The openSPOT has talking alias but only to the network but not to the radio. When will create SharkRF an way to get the alias function in the display."
