        "text": "This is a question that is just to satisfy my curiosity.\n\nI am a licensed ham operator as well as a licensed GMRS operator. I am familiar with the FCC's Amateur radio call sign format - its easily found many places as to the format they use to issue Amateur call signs. But I'm curious about the GMRS format. I realize that it isn't broken up in the various classes as Ham radio is - like tech, general, and extra class. I have searched but haven't found anything describing the format for determining GMRS licenses. Is there any info out there that describes the format rules they use.\n\nI'm just curious to see if the call sign can be somewhat descriptive of the user in any way. For example does a call sign that starts with a W or K or whatever else indicate any length of time that the license has been issued. For example Amateur (HAM) call signs can be somewhat descriptive of the operator. Like the first letter in my call sign of KF5YKO - \"K\" shows that I'm located west of the Mississippi river, and the number 5 in my call sign supposedly shows that I'm located in region 5 of the US covering Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana,and Mississippi. The 2x3 format length of the call sign shows that I have either a technician class license or a general class license that I didn't get a shortened \"general class\" calls sign when upgrading \"by choice\".\n\nOr is it simply issued sequentially/randomly out of a pool of call signs formatted for GMRS - 4 letter prefix and 3 number suffix?\n\nThanks to anyone who can waste some time answering this really unimportant question.\n\n73's\n\nHam - KF5YKO\n\nGMRS - WQWJ296\n\nThe new format is the same as Part 90 licenses 4/3\n\nThe older style was KAA#### thru KA?-####\n\nThis is a question that is just to satisfy my curiosity.\n\nI am a licensed ham operator as well as a licensed GMRS operator.

GMRS\n\nWRXX202 - Bob Jones, GMRS\n\nWRXX203 - Johnson Trucking Company, Part 90 Business Band Conventional\n\nWRXX204 - 123 Electronics LTD, Part 90 LMR system\n\nWRXX205 - City of Bayview, VHF Water Department Telemetry system\n\nWRXX206 - City of Bayview, Point-to-Point Microwave system\n\nWRXX207 - Roger Davis, GMRS\n\nWRXX208 - State of Arizona, Highway Information AM radio station ('Tune 1610 AM for traffic info')\n\nWRXX209 - Hooterville Volunteer Fire Department, Part 90 Public Safety low band\n\nYou get the point. There is no special geographical or service identifier in GMRS calls like you find in Amateur calls or even the K*** and W*** for broadcast stations. They're just sequential, and a lot of different radio services draw from this pool.\n\nAs someone else mentioned, the old GMRS calls (back when it was \"Class A CB Radio\") had the KA*-**** calls. I am KAE-9978.\n\nI'm KAE9013 on GMRS, first issued in December, 1992. Still an active license today. GMRS was already called GMRS in 1992 but my callsign resembles an old Class A CB callsign (KAx nnnn). FRS didn't exist back then. When I applied for the GMRS license, you had to pick any 2 of the GMRS primary frequencies plus the corresponding repeater inputs and put the 4 frequencies on the license application.\n\nI had to file the old paper Form 574 and it had to be typewritten, absolutely no exceptions. The only thing allowed to be handwritten on the application was my signature. It's a good thing I still had my old Smith Corona Cartridge Ribbon electric typewriter.\n\nFrequency coordination was required and repeaters and bases and antenna information had to be included on the application. Licenses were site-based, like Part 90 Industrial/Business licenses. Your area of operation also had to be listed. I licensed as mobiles only, no base station, and at 50W output to get around the need for coordination. My area of operation was nationwide south of Line A. The license fee was $35. The process took about 2 months where if you heard nothing then it was a done deal and you had to wait it out. If there was a problem with the application, it was rejected and returned immediately. So if you received nothing after a month then just wait another month for the license to arrive. The license comes with a note at the bottom saying that additional freqs are authorized per 95.29. Rule section 95.29 in the old GMRS rules authorized the 7 interstitial channels plus the use of the 462.675 primary for emergency and traveler assistance. Many REACT groups operated on 675. The designation of 675 for emergency and traveler assistance and the need for frequency coordination went away with the switch to all-channel licensing in 1999.\n\nIIRC the change to callsigns being issued sequentially across multiple radio services occurred with the switch to the Universal Licensing System (ULS) (in 1996??). It's easy to identify old GMRS callsigns which predate the ULS."
