        "text": "Are these the actual callsigns used over the radios though?\n\nMy understanding is that radio call signs were (and are), technically assigned to radio stations on the net, not individual platforms or people (the pilot/aviator \"callsigns\" are something different, more like a nickname).\n\nSo a carrier and a carrier group would have multiple different callsigns depending on whom you are talking to --- traffic control, fighter/operation control, etc.. Is that correct? Of course, if you only talk to one station on the carrier (e.g. the traffic control), then there is only one callsign for the carrier. E.g., I recall that off Yankee Station \"RED CROWN\" was the callsign of the fighter control, but it was based on a different ship. You talked to traffic control at and after take-off, then you switched to Red Crown.\n\nhttps://www.public.navy.mil/airfor/cvn71/Pages/TRADITIONS.aspx\n\nRADIO CALL SIGN\n\nWhen TR was commissioned, Captain P.W. Parcells requested that the TR be given \"Big Stick\" as her radio call sign; however, that call sign belonged to the White House and was not available. He then requested \"Rough Riders\" instead of \"Old Soldier\" which had been arbitrarily assigned by the Navy bureaucracy. He was told \"Rough Rider\" had already been assigned to USS LOS ANGELES (SSN 688). With that in mind, Captain Parcells armed himself with compelling logic and convinced the LOS ANGELES' Commanding Officer to swap call signs.\n\nSo it is that USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT is known throughout the fleet as \"Rough Rider.\"\n\nI'll see if I can find more"
