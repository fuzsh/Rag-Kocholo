        "text": "How do you handle any other pirates or other \"Illegal callsigns\"? I thought you usually attempted to be a fairly complete and accurate record of every APRS packet heard on the air (and reported to the APRS backbone) and quite a few packets that were never on the air and may or may not ever be gated on to the air (CWOP etc but also packets injected direct into the backbone by various other services like ISS trackers and ham smartphone apps)\n\nI think I see some value in highlighting / marking in red / doing strike-though (which google groups won't let me do) of any callsigns that appear to be NOT valid \"of a form recognised by the ITU\" perhaps, but I don't think you should make it D1-specific / Ukraine-specific, keep it neutral, you'd want to mark those unlicensed truck trackers and things as well. Maybe then allow a filter \"show me only valid calls\", vs \"show only invalid-looking calls\" vs \"show all calls\", up to you which is enabled by default, but I can certainly imagine license-enforcement teams appreciating a view of ONLY the invalid-looking calls? You'd obviously have to keep up-to-date pretty quickly as ITU introduces new prefixes reasonably often.\n\nThere's the awkward issue of objects / items vs callsigns. If I recall, the spec says they share the same namespace even though objects/items do NOT have to be valid ITU callsigns, and are often deliberately and by design tactical things like HAMFEST07, club names, \"Runner001\" or \"Water001\" in the marathon, \"Car001\" in the rally, hospitals, storm names, nets, meetings, FREQUENCIES even, http://www.aprs.org/localinfo.html\n\nTo be clear, D1FOO would be COMPLETELY valid as an object/item, there's almost no rules and certainly no licensing requirements there at all... but source callsigns almost certainly SHOULD be valid? How about digipeating paths - presumably NOT, because q-constructs, WIDEn-n, ARISS, RELAY, etc? It's reasonably obvious which is which on the backbone based on where in the packet they fall, but how does/should APRS.fi (and OTHER display programs/apps/sites, for there are many) handle it on the display side?\n\nI guess ideal would be for different display formats for each of:\n\nValid-looking ITU-compatible callsign appearing as an object/item (NOT required to be a call but might be nice to show if it looks like one?)\n\nNon-callsign appearing as an object/item (PERFECTLY valid but could be displayed differently?)\n\nValid-looking ITU-compatible callsign appearing as the actual SOURCE callsign or in the digipeating path\n\nDESTINATIONS definitely aren't required to be valid calls, and are usually APRS or software name/ver - APLWS2, APMI06, APRX29...\n\nOther valid things appearing in the digipeating path, like q-constructs, WIDEn-n, WIRES? DSTAR? ARISS? RELAY? ECHO? Backbone node names - hang on, can't these be ANY desired digipeat selector hops in almost freeform text, D1234 would be valid here, no?\n\nOther things, that don't look like valid ITU-compatible callsigns, appearing in the source callsign - perhaps display these with a strikethrough and a hover-text explaining why?\n\nI'm wondering if the only thing that is \"required\" to look like an ITU callsign is the SOURCE? Even there, not for WX on CWOP or... Well, let's look at real-world data on the actual APRS backbone, before APRS.fi gets its hands on it: I don't see a huge number of these AS SOURCES. In yesterday's data for example:\n\n294 D18015318>APRARX,SONDEGATE,... - a \"403.810 MHz Type=DFMx7 Radiosonde auto_rx v1.3.2 !wXX!\" - what's a Radiosonde? Is this in Ukraine/ \"DPR\"?\n\n69 D1APRS>APRS - an \"APRS iGateway\", this might be what you are complaining about?\n\n1 D1K6S-10>AK12q-9 - an invalid position \"393.0N082.50t7\" (wrong number of decimal places and no E/W) from a D1 callsign. Given the corruption in the rest of the packet, I'm inclined to believe the source call might have been corrupted as well, and gated by an igate that doesn't verify checksums?\n\nIs 1 packet every 20min worth ANYONE's time? Is this ACTUALLY a problem, or just anticipating a problem in advance?\n\nAnd questions for UR4URD, have you made similar requests to other APRS display sites / programs / apps, or only aprs.fi? Will you be asking APRS-IS backbone providers to block them on ingress, egress, or transit, or only (perhaps a subset of) sites / programs / apps on the display side? I assume you appreciate that APRS.fi IS NOT APRS, it's only one of many ways to display the contents of the APRS-IS backbone (and in this case CWOPS and a few other APRS-IS alternatives)?\n\n73, Nick VA3NNW"
