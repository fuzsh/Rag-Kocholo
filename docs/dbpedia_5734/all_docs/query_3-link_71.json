If you're really concerned about it, you could try, \"Bandido 123, say type aircraft.\" However, within a couple of calls you'll have a pretty good idea how fast they're moving.

One we hear a lot of is \"Minn-State\", which is the University of Mankato's aircraft. I can see where it can help when a flight school has a fleet of trainers with very similar tail numbers, as they do. They have over 40 aircraft all with MK tail numbers. Minn-State 42, Minn-State 43 is a little easier than 424MK, 434MK, etc., especially when a bunch of them are on CTAF or Center frequencies together.\n\nSoonerAviator\n\nFinal Approach\n\nJoined\n\nJul 21, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n9,646\n\nLocation\n\nBroken Arrow, OK\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nSoonerAviator\n\nJun 30, 2023\n\n#9\n\nSpartan School of Aeronautics goes by call sign \"Skelly\" in Tulsa.

I forget the USAF Academy call signs, haven't been south of Denver in a while. CAP has FAA approval to use CAPxxx. Angel Flight has FAA approval to use \"AngelFlight\" but only during the actual flight, not if re-positioning.\n\nOne of the \"pro\" flight schools in the area has a call sign (forget what it is) but at this point, none of the many flight schools along the Front Range (Longmont to Pueblo in Colorado) use call signs. Should that happen, I dread the day.\n\nThe many schools along the Front Range have carved up airspace and freqs, I have no clue if the FAA has approved. If you're curious, the Colorado Pilots Assoc (coloradopilots.org) has published a map, downloadable to ForeFlight of all the areas.\n\nThis is a good idea because the area on the NW side of Denver (Longmont, Boulder, Erie and Jeffco) has always been a nightmare with all the training and confusion on the radios.\n\nhttps://coloradopilots.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&club_id=612720&module_id=540533\n\nFreakin' huge! And PITA for us that just want to go fly. Who knows if the students understand and pay attention to the marked areas?\n\nOn the other hand, it's an attempt to be \"good neighbors\" to the rest of the pilot community. But for anyone not local and/or not aware of this, what a nightmare! Imagine someone coming in from the east and not knowing about this. Surprise!\n\nUSAF (Academy & IPT) has always had a map of training areas in Colorado a little bit is part of the CPA download. You can find those on the CDOT Div of Aeronautics aviation map download or get a paper copy.\n\nhttps://www.codot.gov/programs/aeronautics\n\nLast edited: Jun 30, 2023\n\nVelocity173\n\nTouchdown!

If it’s a “nationally registered flight school” they can apply for a special callsign with the FAA. They could also get approval for a local callsign with ATC such as what we use in EMS.\n\nmark.staggs\n\nPre-takeoff checklist\n\nJoined\n\nJun 19, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n134\n\nLocation\n\nNC\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nMark Staggs\n\nJun 30, 2023\n\n#12\n\nI've noticed in the last year or two that in and around Nashville there's lots more \"Career Track\" and \"Blue Raider\" (Middle TN State) callsigns on the radio.

I know I used to hear a LOT of \"Diamond 123MT <position>...\" when I've temporarily been based at Murfreesboro in the past. I knew they had other types, too, but your reminder's a good one. I took the time to educate myself. Looks like it's about a 10-1 ratio of DA-40s to PA-44s.\n\nSo, I generally agree it'd be easier to know the type of these trainer/callsign planes, especially when entering a swarm of them or when based on or near their training areas.\n\nJim_R\n\nPattern Altitude\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 17, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n1,984\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nJim\n\nJun 30, 2023\n\n#24\n\nFor those that HAVE ADSB-in.\n\nIt's 2023.

First time I heard Blue Raider at CHA, I thought it might be military. One of my medcrew from the local area explained that’s the name associated with MTSU.\n\nJim_R\n\nPattern Altitude\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 17, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n1,984\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nJim\n\nJun 30, 2023\n\n#26\n\nOr in range - my home drone shows nuthin' down at PA.\n\nMy $100 Stratux is dual-band and if you're in the pattern with someone, they're in range.\n\nJim_R\n\nPattern Altitude\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 17, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n1,984\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nJim\n\nJun 30, 2023\n\n#27\n\nI'm not saying with ADSB-in you don't need any radio calls. I'm saying the combo of \"rando123 on 3 mile final straight-in\" plus a glance at the tablet screen is better than \"Baron123 on 3 mile final\". I don't know whether that Baron is doing 100kts or 150kts or 85kts because I don't know Barons. But if I need to know that, I can look for the dot that's lined up 3 miles out and see what speed it's showing.\n\njrcox19\n\nPre-takeoff checklist\n\nJoined\n\nMay 5, 2019\n\nMessages\n\n374\n\nLocation\n\nKFIN\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\njrcox19\n\nJun 30, 2023\n\n#28\n\nThe FAA publishes a list of callsigns.. Odds are good that Kilo Charlie just has a \"local\" approval for Pit-Boss. They weren't using that when I was at IXD, so I assume it's new-ish. Outside of Kansas City area, I assume they go back to their tailnumber.\n\nVelocity173\n\nTouchdown!

On the controller side, some of the callsigns and squawks are preloaded in the software. In some cases, the controller doesn’t have to do any manual typing. Makes for a more efficient system. Now, random N numbers out there wanting their own callsign? Yeah, that ain’t gonna happen.\n\nSFDukie\n\nPre-takeoff checklist\n\nJoined\n\nMar 4, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n313\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nDon\n\nJun 30, 2023\n\n#30\n\nIt seems to me that a whole lot more flight schools are using \"callsigns\" on the radio now…\n\nFormerly, callsigns were mostly used by the airlines or the military. I flew into IXD a few months ago, and there was a \"Pit Boss 21\" in the pattern. Now, what's Pit Boss? I incorrectly assumed it was an ANG F-16 or something like that. Nope, typical trainer from a flight school, \"Pit Boss\" being chosen for Kansas City's love of BBQ Pits.\n\nI would opine that not having any indication of aircraft type in the radio calls is a safety issue. \"Cessna 123\" at least tells you something. \"Bandido 123\" could be anything from a 152 to a C-5.\n\nWas there a recent policy change on this (applying for a school callsign), or has it always been this bad and I just haven't seen it due to the type of places I was flying?\n\nRegardless, on initial radio call (or on self announce at untowered sirport) pilot should include AC type- ie “San Carlos ground, archer bandito 41”\n\nAnalogous to call up with n number.\n\nPinecone\n\nEn-Route\n\nJoined\n\nMay 24, 2022\n\nMessages\n\n4,128\n\nLocation\n\nMD\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nPinecone\n\nJun 30, 2023\n\n#31\n\nIt's 2023.

ADSB will give you position and speed of other aircraft, mitigating the situational awareness concern.\n\nLast edited: Jul 1, 2023\n\nJim_R\n\nPattern Altitude\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 17, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n1,984\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nJim\n\nJul 1, 2023\n\n#34\n\nOh yeah, if they're ADSB-Out . . .I don't see much of anything else down there - someone here posted a link of the ground station coverage areas - our airport isn't well served.\n\nThe OP is talking about flight schools making radio calls without including aircraft type, presumably causing ambiguity in other pilots' situational awareness. ADSB can mitigate that issue. Are flight school aircraft flying without ADSB out?\n\nIn your area, are planes without ADSB out making calls that don't include the aircraft type?

One we hear a lot of is \"Minn-State\", which is the University of Mankato's aircraft. I can see where it can help when a flight school has a fleet of trainers with very similar tail numbers, as they do. They have over 40 aircraft all with MK tail numbers. Minn-State 42, Minn-State 43 is a little easier than 424MK, 434MK, etc., especially when a bunch of them are on CTAF or Center frequencies together.\n\nAt flights schools where the young CFI staff decides it’s cool to enact a call sign and it is not FAA approved, it is an indicator of poor supervision by flight school.\n\nJim_R\n\nPattern Altitude\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 17, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n1,984\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nJim\n\nJul 1, 2023\n\n#38\n\nIs there a requirement for ADSB-In now that I missed?

But if someone's going to complain about behaviors that create a perceived deficiency in cockpit situational awareness and they're not using ADSB-in, then they're going to lose a lot of credibility with me. If you're really serious about maximizing your situational awareness in the cockpit, then you're going to prioritize getting ADSB-in. There are dozens of affordable ADSB-in solutions today, including portable ones.\n\nIs ADSB-in the be-all, end-all, solution to everything? Of course not. But it's a huge improvement over NOT having ADSB-in.\n\nLast edited: Jul 1, 2023\n\nDoc Holliday\n\nEn-Route\n\nJoined\n\nDec 9, 2016\n\nMessages\n\n2,961\n\nLocation\n\nTombstone\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nDoc Holliday"
