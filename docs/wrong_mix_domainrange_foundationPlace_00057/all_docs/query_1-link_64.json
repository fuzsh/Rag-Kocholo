        "text": "Inphinity Forms is a brilliant write-back, seamlessly integrated in Qlik. The ops team loved the concept of rapid and secure write-back and creating a clear evidence trail. We use Forms in combination with Qlik & Qlik Alerting for data quality improvement. We also use it for real-time data capture in Qlik. And we see many more highly appealing use cases.\n\nBefore Forms, we were using Excel spreadsheets. Despite months spent building the templates, we were not able to achieve a seamless planning process mainly due to the complexity, manual steps that are prone to errors, and difficult consolidation of multiple spreadsheets. We needed a governed solution, unified front-end, and automation of manual calculation steps.\n\nWe manage our data quality issues directly in Qlik with Inphinity. It is very easy both to develop and to use, especially because the work is done right where the data is, so everything can be taken in full context. It’s the right way, with Inphinity Forms.\n\nInphinity Forms enables us to remove Excel spreadsheets in our business modeling in Qlik and bring information faster to the people who need it in the field.\n\nThe setup was incredibly easy. We put all our spreadsheets on Dropbox, signed-up to Inphinity platform, picked the app we wanted, and followed the instructions to feed our data to the dashboards. The result was outstanding! We subscribed right after expiration of trial period for a fraction of the competitor’s price.\n\nWe’ve built the whole Project tracking solution around Inphinity Forms in Qlik Sense. The development was much faster and easier than it would be with other technologies. A crucial part was the unique option to upload files to the server directly from the Qlik application by using Inphinity Forms. It is already used in production, saves time, and brings value also by having data directly in Qlik where we analyze it.\n\nThe implementation of Sales Planning in Forms took us just 4 weeks – incredible achievement compared to our previous planning solution in Excel, which took us months to build.\n\nThe use of writeback has been pivotal. Allowing our clinical staff to capture information in real-time and augment clinical records has been so important. Without question, it’s a mission critical app that impacts on the safe care of patients"
