        "text": "From Wimbledon and Euros to the summer games, there's been no shortage of viewing for sports fans this year ‚Äì all enhanced by #data analytics. Data has touched all sides of the sports industry, from in-game decisions and tactics to business decisions off the field to how we view the games at home. As someone who works in the data industry and is an avid sports fan, I've noticed this transformation, but for the everyday fan, it may be something they've not given much thought to. Built In dive into how data and #AI are transforming the sports industry and the fan experience in-person and at home ‚¨áÔ∏è https://bit.ly/4cT7u1c\n\nWe at Qlik are excited to announce that #QlikTalendCloud is now generally available (GA). This is a massive achievement and a major leap in Qlik delivering on the #Talend integration roadmap for #AI-ready #data. Qlik Talend Cloud combines our robust data integration and quality capabilities into a single, cohesive platform. This powerful tool enables our customers to build AI-driven data pipelines, ensuring reliable data access anytime. Find more here: https://bit.ly/3zU3LSo\n\nThe manufacturing industry is just one that has been slow to adopt #AI, and in many cases, this is because of a lack of accessible #data. Though there are some manufacturing companies with the right data who are starting to experience the benefits of adopting AI such as: üü¢ Monitoring and improving production line efficiency üü¢ Boosting quality control üü¢ Helping make more informed decisions But these capabilities are only successful when they are underpinned by reliable, trustworthy data ‚Äì and this is where Qlik comes in. I did a Q&A with Rachael Brown for Manufacturing Digital sharing insights on AI and how it's set to fundamentally reshape the Manufacturing production line: https://bit.ly/465EGjj\n\n#AI is and will play an increasingly big role in most business decisions enterprises will face daily, but the path to full adoption is not without its hurdles. VentureBeat does well listing the main challenges and opportunities of #GenAI, including how #data is at the heart of it. The single biggest thing that I think holds people back from getting real value with AI is the notion of data literacy; how we develop skills and how we help people to work with and question data is key üëâ https://bit.ly/4bNl8Bv\n\nThe UK government should be cautious of overregulation, as too many guardrails can stifle innovation and end up prejudicial for businesses and the British tech and innovation ecosystem ‚Äì this being said, ensuring that #AI is developed and deployed ethically is essential. In my view, the new UK government's toughest job is striking this delicate balance between protecting its citizens from potential misuse or abuse of AI while enabling innovation and fuelling growth for the UK economy. Find more on the AI legislation plans from the #KingsSpeech here ‚¨áÔ∏è\n\nI had a coffee with TechInformed at Qlik Connect and shared my perspectives on the tech industry and my vision for the future of #data. Thoroughly enjoyed this sit down by not only giving my insight into the industry but also going back into how I found myself in the role I‚Äôm at today as CSO Qlik. I delve into the critical need for data literacy and #AI literacy to unlock the true potential of data and AI and where Qlik comes into play in delivering this for our customers. Listen here ‚û°Ô∏è https://bit.ly/3S7cXZL\n\nI‚Äôve said before that #GenAI is here and it‚Äôs here to stay, but with that is the importance of #data quality. If you can‚Äôt trust your data, it will lead to incorrect results. AIM share how data, as well as human oversight, is crucial in the adoption of #GenAI. It isn‚Äôt #AI that may take people‚Äôs jobs, but people who can effectively use and understand AI. Find out how banking and finance sectors are using GenAI by generating realistic synthetic customer data for testing models, while addressing privacy and regulatory issues ‚Äì something that might help you ‚§µÔ∏è https://bit.ly/3XPzEp3\n\nI believe #GenAI is fundamental for businesses looking to succeed in this economy. Research from Gartner showing it‚Äôs the most commonly deployed type of #AI within organisations only proves this. To safely leverage GenAI, organisations require a radically different approach to governing unstructured #data. This includes focusing on the quality, tracing the lineage and automating the curation of unstructured data. Even though I understand GenAI can frighten many, as a new technology you might not understand, it should be embraced. These steps from Rehan Jalil via Forbes will help break down how to do exactly that. Read them here ‚¨áÔ∏è https://bit.ly/4cC8o1N\n\nOne of Qlik's main goals is to provide customers with a trusted foundation for building new #AI models and applications. Though as a new era evolves, new challenges come with it, such as most businesses being limited in their AI work by not being able to manage their #data in the right way ‚Äì something I understand can be daunting for many organisations. So, how are we addressing it? üü¢ Our platform is purpose-built to govern your data and make it ready for AI. üü¢ We have data lineage capabilities built into our platform so you can see whether data belongs in an application. üü¢ We're building trust scores around AI data quality. CEO Mike Capone shares more on Qlik's AI strategy with Eric Avidon of TechTarget News. Read it here ‚§µÔ∏è https://bit.ly/4e3IvZJ\n\nWith almost half of businesses still using spreadsheets to manage their ESG #data, the challenge of managing and analysing sustainability data is bigger than many might think. Relying on the more basic data management tools like spreadsheets makes it difficult to deal with large volumes of data and can leave you vulnerable to security breaches. This is especially a worry for often sensitive ESG data. But there is a better way, as Qlik's very own Julie Kae told Technology Magazine recently: focus on building the right data foundation whereby analytics can turn that trusted data into actionable insights.
