        "text": "Download Comparison Guide\n\nProduct Overview\n\nQlik offers a number of business intelligence solutions for visualization analytics, including QlikView, Qlik Sense, and Qlik AutoML. For this review, we’ll focus on all the Qlik Sense editions.\n\nQlik Sense is a dynamic self-service analytics and visualization tool that simplifies data exploration for a full spectrum of users (from the non-tech savvy to the data expert). With intuitive data prep, drag-and-drop abilities and drill-down features, organizations can easily spot and share data relationships and key insights quickly and efficiently.\n\nOpen application program interfaces (APIs) allow developers to embed Qlik Sense into other applications so they can customize and extend Qlik’s features to meet an organization’s unique needs.\n\nFeatures\n\nQlik Sense has many dynamic features that are flexible enough for all types of users. Some of its best features are listed below:\n\nInsight Advisor – The Insight Advisor brings machine learning to real-time insights. Its natural language functionality allows users to ask questions and get visual answers. The Insight Advisor can also provide chart suggestions, association recommendations and other smart suggestions, in order to streamline the data preparation process.\n\nSelf-service creation – Drag-and-drop capabilities offer easy dashboard and report creation without the need for scripting, complex queries or joins.\n\nData integration – Unify disparate data sources on a single platform. Also, Qlik Sense doesn’t “hide” any data. When manipulating views and dimensions, irrelevant data is “grayed out” instead of disregarded, so you’re still able to discover hidden trends.\n\nInteractive visualizations – Qlik Sense offers users simple visualization creation that instantly responds to changes in dimensions and data context.\n\nData storytelling – Easily share multiple viewpoints at once while assigning context to data. Storytelling features can also access the original analysis so users can quickly drill down into data to answer questions and change viewpoints.\n\nResponsive design – Whether on desktop, tablet or smartphone (or if you’re simply changing the size of your browser window), Qlik Sense automatically adjusts to give you the best view of its apps.\n\nAdvanced and predictive analytics\n\nAutomated data-driven alerts\n\nThe ability to share reports in Microsoft Office, PDFs, email or a centralized hub\n\nNotes and discussion threads for explaining context surrounding the data\n\nTarget Market\n\nQlik Sense is intended for all users, regardless of their technical expertise. We’ve listed 10 of its customers below.\n\nImplementation/Integration\n\nQlik Sense has both cloud-hosted and on-premise solutions, depending on the company’s needs. With its cloud-based solution, users can simply sign up for a free trial. Qlik offers free and paid training programs, including self-paced learning and instructor-led training.\n\nCustomer Service & Support\n\nUsers can access the knowledge base for self-service articles and other resources, connect with other users via Qlik Community or submit a support ticket. Qlik provides 24/7 support availability for critical issues.\n\nIn addition, Qlik offers an optional Signature Success program for companies with unique requirements that need a personalized success plan, such as customized onboarding and training, a dedicated Customer Success Manager, business reviews, proactive assessments, faster priority tech support and exclusive access to Qlik’s product roadmap.\n\nPricing\n\nQlik has launched a new analytics pricing strategy that’s comprised of three tiers:\n\nStandard – The Standard tier is intended for small teams or users that only need basic features. It costs $20 per user, per month and requires at least 10 users minimum. It accommodates up to 50 GB of data per year and includes basic capabilities of Qlik Sense, such as:\n\nThe ability to connect and combine data from over hundreds of sources\n\nInteractive dashboards and visualizations\n\nAugmented analytics with advanced AI\n\nEmbedded analytics\n\nMobile app\n\nCollaboration features\n\n24/7 critical customer support\n\nDigital onboarding\n\nNote that clients can only pay for full users (the tier doesn’t accommodate basic users).\n\nPremium – The Premium tier starts at $2,700 per month for 50 GB of data per year. It includes all of the features of the Standard plan, plus:\n\nUnlimited basic users (who can view and interact with analytics)\n\nAutomated report compilation and delivery\n\nThe ability to connect data from cloud, legacy, SAP and mainframe sources\n\nPredictive analytics\n\nNo-code automation builder for triggering dynamic actions\n\nEnterprise-grade data governance\n\nGuided customer success onboarding\n\nEnterprise – The Enterprise tier support unlimited basic and full users, and it starts with 500 GB of data per year. Pricing is available by quote only. This tier adds on:\n\nAdditional flexibility for data governance\n\nEnterprise performance and scalability\n\nVolume discounts available\n\nPersonalized customer success plan and onboarding\n\nShortcomings\n\nSome customers have said that the software has limited customization, so users that want advanced customization will have to integrate with a third-party tool. Also, some users have mentioned that the software slows down when compiling large datasets.\n\nScreenshots\n\nAbout\n\nQlik’s vision is a data-literate world, where everyone can use data and analytics to improve decision-making and solve their most challenging problems. It provides an end-to-end, real-time data integration and analytics cloud platform to close the gaps between data, insights and action. Qlik does business in more than 100 countries and serves over 40,000 customers around the world.\n\nDownload Comparison Guide\n\nSend feedback or corrections to feedback@betterbuys.com.\n\nRelated Solutions"
