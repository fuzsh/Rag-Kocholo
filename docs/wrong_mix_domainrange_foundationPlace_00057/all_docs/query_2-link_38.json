        "text": "Position education appropriately\n\nYou should position your education on your resume according to your current status. For a sales account executive, the ability to understand customer needs and industry trends is essential. If you have recently completed a relevant course or degree, such as a marketing or business administration degree, this should be at the top to highlight your fresh knowledge.\n\nIf you have been working in sales for many years, place your experience first. Your practical skills in managing client relationships and achieving sales targets show your capability in the role more than your education might. Still, include your education section after the experience to provide a complete picture but focus on relevant degrees or certifications that show your understanding of sales processes and customers.\n\nIdeal resume length\n\nAs a sales account executive, you should aim for a resume that is concise and to the point. If you have less than 10 years of experience, a one-page resume is best. This helps you show that you can prioritize information, an important skill in sales. Focus on your most relevant experiences and successes.\n\nFor those with over 10 years of experience or in a senior-level position, a two-page resume is acceptable. Use the extra space to detail your sales achievements and key accounts you've managed or closed. Ensure the highlights of your career are on the first page as this is where hiring managers look first. Remember, clarity is key, so keep your formatting clean and your text readable."
