        "text": "GMCS was a partner of the Qlik Data Transformation Day 2021 conference, which took place on September 28 in Moscow. Here are the most interesting things.\n\nThe Conference attracted over 300 people. Participants, experts and Qlik partners shared practical approaches and cases of building a data-driven culture and also discussed various possibilities of using data to increase business efficiency using Qlik technologies.\n\nOne of such cases was the GMCS’s data-driven project for the Skolkovo Foundation, which was described by Dmitry Arkhireyev, Project Manager at Skolkovo. A solution based on Qlik Sense is used to obtain financial analytics, visualization of the annual report of the Fund's participants and analytics of the work of development institutions in Russia. The application is used by both Skolkovo Foundation employees and external users. Dmitry also shared his plans for the development of the solution to be implemented jointly with GMCS.\n\nAt the GMCS booth, participants were able to test their knowledge in the “Guess Where Is Qlik” quiz, and the winners received an author's sticker pack on the BI theme. Also, GMCS experts introduced the participants to solutions based on Qlik Sense and QlikView for HoReCa, retail, distribution, logistics, manufacturing and other industries.\n\nThe conference ended with a ceremony to award the winners of the Qlik Data Transformation Awards. The BI project GMCS for Wolkonsky Trading House based on Qlik Sense became the winner in the Sales and Marketing Analytics nomination.\n\nTo receive GMCS’s materials from the conference, send a request to info@gmcs.ru marked as “Qlik Data Transformation Day”.\n\nBack"
