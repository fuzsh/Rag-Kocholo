        "text": "Nowadays, the data we’re constantly surrounded by could potentially fill an ocean. Luckily, there are a lot of options on the market for business intelligence (BI) tools. But how do you make the right call on which one’s ideal for your business?\n\nWell, with lots of research, of course! So, with the intention of saving you time in googling, reading, and cross-checking, we decided to make an article that encapsulates the platforms’ essence.\n\nDiscover Our Data Analytics Services\n\nWe’ll be comparing the top leading BI platforms according to Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for Analytics and Business Intelligence Platforms – Microsoft Power BI vs Qlik Sense vs Tableau. These leaders do more than just visualize data into pretty images; they help their users explore all sides of their data in a scalable and controlled manner. So, before we dive into the comparisons, let’s get a brief overview of the current market leaders.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOverview of Qlik, Tableau, and Power BI Platforms\n\nVisual Comparison: Qlik vs Tableau vs Power BI\n\nDetailed Feature Comparison: Qlik, Tableau, and Power BI\n\nTop Competitors to Qlik, Power BI, and Tableaua Analytics Explained\n\nQlik vs Tableau vs Power BI: FAQs\n\nMaking an Informed Decision: Qlik, Tableau, or Power BI?\n\nOverview of Qlik, Tableau, and Power BI Platforms\n\nGenerally speaking, all three of these platforms are business intelligence solutions offering interactive data visualizations and the tools to aggregate, analyze and share users’ data. But what makes them unique?\n\nMicrosoft Power BI: Key Features and Benefits\n\nWell, Power BI started off as an add-on to Microsoft’s very popular Excel software but quickly became its own separate product. Microsoft’s acquisition of Datazen actually helped set the foundations and propel the Power BI software, and since then, the platform has been steadily growing.\n\nA big part of its adoption came from the seamless integration with the Office 365 suite it provided, which most companies were already using. So, with the gradual expansion of the Office 365 software lineup, Power BI’s widespread use became more and more prevalent as time went on.\n\nQlik Sense: A Closer Look\n\nQlik’s product lineup initially began with QlikView, which had at its core the Qlik Associative Engine – technology that allowed for fast handling of large amounts of users and data. Later Qlik came up with a new product for their arsenal – Qlik Sense – which also ran on the same engine. It was intended to replace QlikView by offering a more intuitive and user-friendly interface.\n\nQlik Sense went on to become the main focus of Qlik’s updates; because of its web-based nature, Qlik could easily support both the cloud-based and client-managed versions to keep up with the current trends.\n\nSalesforce Tableau: What You Need to Know\n\nTableau as a platform gained noticeable popularity through its large demo library, which featured its prime objective – creating simple and user-friendly visualizations. Tableau made the process of populating and sharing a dashboard quick and easy through its VizQL engine – which introduced a drag-and-drop interface that anyone could use without any coding skills.\n\nSince the Salesforce acquisition in 2019, Tableau’s business intelligence features have only improved and continued to marketize its easy-to-use nature, boasting impressive-looking dashboards done in minutes.\n\nVisual Comparison: Qlik vs Tableau vs Power BI\n\nIn the landscape of data analytics tools, Qlik Sense, Power BI, and Tableau have emerged as frontrunners, each with its unique set of strengths and functionalities. The following visual comparison table provides an objective breakdown across multiple critical categories, from deployment and data connectivity to pricing. These metrics aim to offer a comprehensive perspective, allowing businesses and individual users to determine which tool aligns best with their specific needs.\n\nDetailed Feature Comparison: Qlik, Tableau, and Power BI\n\nThe choice between Qlik, Tableau, and Power BI can significantly impact outcomes. This section offers a detailed comparison of their features to guide informed decision-making. Understanding each tool’s capabilities will help you pick the tool that aligns with your business needs and expectations.\n\nDeployment Options Across Tools\n\nWe begin with Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure deployment flexibility of Power BI … or more like their lack of flexibility. You see, Power BI runs only in Azure – Microsoft’s public cloud computing platform. And even though Azure itself maintains multiple geographies, thus ensuring that customers across the world have low-latency access to their infrastructure, it still doesn’t excuse this total lack of flexibility. For that reason, we’ll be giving Power BI a 2/5 for their Deployment options.\n\nDiscover Our Power BI Services\n\nMoving on to Qlik Sense now, we see a drastic change in deployment flexibility where customers can utilize any major cloud provider, deploy on-premises, or even take advantage of a combination of these two approaches.\n\nThis is really refreshing to see since having total freedom and control over your own data is key when you want to make the most out of it. By allowing their customers to deploy Qlik Sense without requiring a change in their cloud analytics strategy or locking their data in one specific platform, Qlik will be receiving a 5/5 from us.\n\nAnd last but not least, the flexibility that Salesforce offers with Tableau is very similar to what we see from Qlik. Tableau wants to fit into your current setup and not try to dictate what or where your architecture should be deployed in.\n\nSalesforce tries to cover all of their clients’ needs with the help of either Tableau Server or Tableau Cloud, or even both, if necessary. And once again, for providing their customers a variety of choices for their deployment needs, we’ll give Salesforce Tableau a 5/5.\n\nData Connectivity: Which Tool Connects Better?\n\nAs Microsoft is a huge and popular company, it’s only natural that they implement data connections to various types of sales, marketing, project management, payment processing, and productivity platforms. Naturally, the list of supported connections expands periodically, and with such a big community behind Power BI, all the ones that are currently unavailable have established workarounds.\n\nPower BI customers can expect to import the data from popular sources like SAP, ODBC, Snowflake, Apache Hive, etc. They can also take advantage of Direct Queries, which request the information from the source but never import it. All these reasons combined mean that Power BI will be scoring a solid 5/5 on the data connectivity scale.\n\nQlik boasts full customization and flexibility options with their Qlik Sense product and by going through their available native connectors, we can see most of the popular sources any customer would need. Additionally, any sources that aren’t available out-of-the-box are likely to be available for download through the Qlik website. They are also adding new data connections with every new patch, so the list is constantly expanding.\n\nFrom our search, we couldn’t find any support for eCommerce or payment processing platforms, which can impede the data analysis of some clients. So, at the end of the day, Qlik Sense will be receiving a 4/5 from us.\n\nTableau has the native benefit of connecting to plenty of popular and not-so-popular sources. However, comparing its list of connections to Qlik Sense’s or Power BI’s, it feels like Tableau is lacking in several fields. We see some of the more widely used data connectors like Amazon Redshift, Microsoft Excel, Google Analytics, SAP, Snowflake, and, of course, Salesforce. However, we couldn’t find any out-of-the-box connections to project management, payment processing, or eCommerce platforms.\n\nAdditionally, there don’t seem to be any workarounds to establish these missing connections, apart from finding third-party or partner integrations online. Because of this comparative lack of data connectivity options, we’ll be assigning Tableau a 3/5 in this category.\n\nEase of Use: A User-Friendly Analysis\n\nLooking at Power BI’s interface, we can see a clean drag-and-drop look with all the tools you’d need sectioned off into tabs on the side. If a user has ever worked with any Microsoft Office product, they would likely feel right at home with Power BI’s interface. Beginners could quickly make some visualizations thanks to the pre-built templates that Microsoft offers for each chart.\n\nAdditionally, the builder is WYSIWYG, so users can freely place their charts and free-transform them as they’d like, or they could enable the grid view and snap them to precise measurements. Because of its familiar design and easy-to-use interface, which can predispose a new user to start creating appealing visualizations from the get-go, we’ll award Power BI a nice 5/5 here.\n\nMoving on to Qlik Sense, we can observe a unique interface with everything clearly labeled so that new users can easily maneuver around. The dashboard builder is once again drag-and-drop with all the customization and data tuning options on one side and the charts and fields lists on the other.\n\nThere is no free-transform option when adjusting the size of the visualizations; everything snaps to the grid. Luckily, the grid itself can be made bigger or smaller to allow for more precise layouts. We once again see a WYSIWYG editor, which nicely represents the final look of your dashboard while you’re developing it. Overall, apart from Qlik Sense’s distinctive design, everything we experienced seems to match the set expectations, so Qlik Sense will be receiving a 5/5.\n\nDiscover Our Qlik Services\n\nTableau is even more unique than its competitors, which could be considered a plus if you don’t enjoy the layout of the previous two platforms. In order to create charts, you have to first populate the columns and rows section, and then Tableau will present you with the most suitable chart for the dimensions you’ve provided. The given visualization can be switched afterward, but only to charts that match the dimensions you’ve set.\n\nTableau’s dashboard builder is a bit different as well since you have to make all the charts you need first in separate sheets, and then when you build the dashboard, you can drag and drop those sheets and free transform them as you see fit. All these minor sidetracks accumulate to form a visually appealing but ultimately tedious and time-consuming process of chart creation and so Tableau will end up with a 4/5 from us.\n\nData Visualization: How Qlik, Tableau, and Power BI Compare\n\nMicrosoft’s Power BI has most of the popular and classic visualizations available out-of-the-box, as well as some generic customization options, which users can apply quickly through the use of templates. However, developers will have to resort to the custom visuals marketplace if they want to make something more unique for their dashboards.\n\nMost of the charts you can find there are free and either beautify some existing classic charts or add new and interesting ones. If nothing fits their needs, they always have the option to use code to create their own custom design and package them for either organizational sharing or publishing in the marketplace.\n\nSo, at the end of the day, Microsoft offers their Power BI users flexibility and customization, but they would either have to be satisfied with the options on the marketplace or be prepared to learn to code on their own. For that reason, we give Power BI a 4/5 here.\n\nQlik Sense also comes with most of the traditional charts and tables, and their customization levels are about what you’d expect – change colors, labels, and on some charts, even their presentation styles. Users can also use some emojis in their visualizations, provided they code them in.\n\nAnd here’s the part which might deter some newcomers – you have to be able to code if you want to make your dashboard visually unique. Of course, there’s always the option to utilize extensions to achieve your vision; however, Qlik doesn’t make them as readily available and applicable as Power BI. Qlik Sense handles data visualization adequately, but the lack of easily accessible customization options hampers it, and therefore we’ll be giving it a 3/5.\n\nTableau is praised for its data visualization capabilities and the amount of customizations users can do on their charts and graphs. It’s relatively easy to make a unique-looking dashboard by using custom images and icons – generally, the only restriction one might have is their imagination.\n\nAdditionally, the free-transform option allows users to adjust their charts to show the full label names. And if you think the size of your dashboard will be a constrain here, think again because Tableau’s dashboards can be extended as much as you need by presenting you with a scroll for maneuverability. Thanks to this freedom of customization of chart backgrounds, images, trend lines, sizes, and so on, we happily give Tableau a 5/5 in this category.\n\nData Transformation Capabilities: A Comparative Overview\n\nMicrosoft has ensured that its business intelligence products are equipped with the necessary ETL functionality, and that’s why both Power BI and Excel have Power Query to utilize.\n\nThe Power Query Editor comes with Power BI Desktop, allowing customers to connect to one or more of the available data sources, then extract, shape, and transform the data to meet their requirements, and finally, load and utilize that data in their own models.\n\nAs far as the ETL process goes, everything we’ve seen from Power Query seems to meet all the standards – you can even use the Advanced Editor to dive into the query code and adjust it to your needs.\n\nHowever, from our experience, Power BI doesn’t seem to handle large data sets well. Users may encounter issues connecting to or importing from larger data sets and may be faced with performance issues throughout the process. So, that’s why Power BI will be receiving a 4/5 from us.\n\nQlik Sense also has a built-in ETL functionality. With it, users can really take advantage of Qlik’s performance optimization by storing the extracted raw data in a QVD file. Additionally, that format is 10-100 times faster than other data sources. Using a QVD library allows users to reuse the data in other Qlik Sense applications instead of having to extract it all over again.\n\nSimilar to Power BI, clients can dive into the ETL query code in Qlik Sense and modify it to get the most desired results out of the process. Users just need to be familiar with the Qlik Sense script syntax to do so. Because Qlik has optimized its engine well, customers can focus on the quality of their data rather than worry about the challenges that come with an increasing data volume. The well-tuned performance of Qlik Sense really gives it an edge over its competition.\n\nAdditionally, having the engine available out-of-the-box and for all deployments of Qlik Sense really shows consideration for the customer. And that’s why Qlik Sense will be getting a 5/5 here.\n\nSalesforce Tableau doesn’t come with built-in ETL functionality, but customers can download Tableau Prep (a.k.a. Tableau Prep Builder). This is a stand-alone subscription-only product that works with Tableau Desktop, Tableau Online, and Tableau Server.\n\nIn terms of functionality, Tableau Prep has a user-friendly interface that could help any user work on data preparation without too much of a struggle. The tool itself isn’t really made for customizing complex logic since it doesn’t have a way to adjust the ETL query code.\n\nAdditionally, some of its available functionality isn’t fully developed for each step of the ETL process, like aggregations for example. Overall, the whole experience is serviceable to a point but will leave some of the more experienced developers wanting more. Couple that with the additional subscription it requires, and, in our opinion, Tableau will be going home with a 3/5 in this category.\n\nDiscover Our Tableau Services\n\nData Modeling: Which Tool Stands Out?\n\nPower BI is all about providing users with a complete business intelligence package, but amongst all the features hides a very crucial limitation – it isn’t well optimized. And there’s no place we can observe this better than when doing data modeling. First off, as we mentioned in the previous section, Power BI doesn’t deal well with loading in large data sets. In fact, it was the slowest one out of the bunch when we compared uploading around 40 million records in the Desktop version.\n\nOn the bright side, its data modeling system does have all the expected functionality. However, all connections and relationships need to be manually set by the user, which slows things down a lot, especially when dealing with multiple tables. So, all this leads us to the score for this section, which will be a 3/5 for Power BI.\n\nQlik Sense, on the other hand, is very well optimized to handle all tasks relatively quickly. When we tried the 40 million records test upload in our on-premises instance, Qlik Sense managed to deal with it in about a minute – faster than any of the other platforms.\n\nFurthermore, because of its Associative Engine, all data relationships were automatically indexed and connected. This meant that even non-technical users could set up and create data models. The automatic table previews, unions, and connections were refreshing to see, and from what we gathered, there were no missing features or functionalities to speak of. Qlik’s performance and speed are so far unmatched by its competitors, so that’s why we’ll be awarding Qlik Sense with a 5/5.\n\nTableau has its priorities focused on nice-looking visuals and a user-friendly interface, so you wouldn’t be remiss if you thought their performance wasn’t very optimized as well. However, Tableau is surprisingly well-optimized to handle larger datasets, which sadly comes at a price. When we ran the 40 million records test here, Tableau was still a bit slow, but it was quicker than Power BI, which is impressive.\n\nBut as we mentioned, this was probably because of the way its data modeling experience was built. Users can’t pull in all tables and play with connections to establish the right connections on the go; rather, they need to drag them in one by one in the correct order or risk starting over again.\n\nFurthermore, the connections need to be manually determined by the user as well, and there’s no table preview to speak of, which makes the whole experience more tedious and cumbersome. In the end, the whole experience was slow and unpleasant, so we’ll award Tableau a 3/5 for this category.\n\nData Governance Features Across Qlik, Tableau, and Power BI\n\nMicrosoft has woven the concept of governance within all of its products, so it only makes sense to see features to control the security and management of data assets in Power BI, as well. Users can utilize features like endorsing data sets and showcasing which ones are important for their team, even marking them as certified or not for more authority.\n\nAdditionally, Power BI lets you add sensitivity labels to your dashboards, reports, data sets, and even data flows, which can then be used to control access between your userbase.\n\nAnd, of course, Microsoft’s Defender for Cloud Apps provides some protection options for the more sensitive data through alerts and session monitoring. Overall, Power BI gives its users much of the necessary control to mark, section off, and organize their data, and for that, we will award them with a solid 5/5.\n\nQlik Sense has some built-in functionality that controls who gets to see what – it’s called Section Access. By setting it up within an app’s data load script, it dynamically reduces the shown data to the appropriate scope when the application gets accessed by another user.\n\nBut that’s not even the best Qlik has to offer since all customers get their own Qlik Management Console (QMC). From there, many adjustments, limitations, and notifications can be enabled, which helps tailor the Qlik Sense experience to best fit the customer’s needs.\n\nIt may be a bit hard to wrap your head around at first, but it offers some great options like setting up tags, adjusting security rules, controlling stream (or space) access, and much more. So, we’ll give Qlik Sense a 5/5 as well for providing their users with lots of choices and flexibility throughout their data governance features.\n\nTableau also puts a lot of effort into giving its users the flexibility to control who has access to what data. Most of what you’ll find here is based on account authentication and authorization mechanisms, like the user filters, metadata management, and so on.\n\nAlso, users can monitor and audit their workbook or dashboard usage to ensure the intended use of their data assets. Tableau can also connect to other security protocols such as Kerberos, Active Directory, SAML, trusted tickets, and certificates.\n\nAll in all, a user will be able to find all the standard data governance features here as well. And although they may not be as in-depth in some places as they are in Qlik Sense or Power BI, it’s still a valiant effort worth a 5/5 in our books.\n\nAugmented Analytics: A Three-Way Tool Analysis\n\nOn the Augmented Analytics front, Power BI has plenty of ways to enhance dataflows with artificial intelligence. Its automated machine learning (a.k.a. AutoML) feature allows users to train, validate, and invoke models. The service itself extracts the most relevant features of the provided data and trains the model based on them.\n\nMicrosoft has also thought about the professionals in the field by arming them with Azure Machine Learning, which can both create new machine learning models and import any previously built ones from platforms like Pytorch, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn.\n\nHowever, the Azure Machine Learning feature is only available to Power BI Desktop users. And last but not least, users can take advantage of Power BI Q&A, the platform’s natural language processing tool, to get quick visualization results based on natural language questions or requests.\n\nFrom all this, we can see that Microsoft has ensured that all its users could enjoy a large enough plethora of augmented analytics features, and their efforts haven’t gone unnoticed in our eyes. That’s why we’ll be giving Power BI a 5/5.\n\nMoving on to Qlik Sense now, we can see that their philosophy on speed and efficiency has led them to enhance the preparation, exploration, and authoring functions with associative suggestions. This augmented performance is due to their Associative Engine, and it helps all their users, no matter the skill level, to search through their existing data sets for insights and correlations.\n\nAdditionally, users can utilize the Insight Advisor to speed up the data preparation and analysis process through natural language inputs, provided they have the needed subscription.\n\nQlik Sense also has an automated machine learning (a.k.a. Qlik AutoML) feature up its sleeve, a separate platform requiring its own license. With it, users can easily generate machine learning models, make predictions, and test scenarios without interacting too much, if at all, with the code behind it.\n\nSo, Qlik’s customers can get a lot of use from the available augmented analytics features. However, if users want to incorporate any models they’ve already developed somewhere else, they’d have to resort to extensions and community guidelines. All this puts Qlik Sense at the 4/5 point for this category.\n\nTableau continues its no-code user-friendly approach even in the augmented analytics category. The platform has its own Insight Advisor called Ask Data, which provides context-aware suggestions and visualizations based on natural language queries from the user. They’ve also coupled their advisor with an Explain Data feature that shows users relevant explanations when hovering over particular highlight points.\n\nAsk Data:\n\nExplain Data:\n\nSalesforce has even invested in integrating their Einstein Discovery no-code environment into Tableau’s business intelligence feature list. It requires a separate subscription, and with it, any user, regardless of skill or experience, can create machine learning models that offer recommendations and predictions with the data at hand.\n\nSo, Tableau also has a way to lower the barrier to predictive modeling. Still, because of their no-code approach, they haven’t got a way to accommodate the more experienced ML model creators, similarly to Qlik Sense. So, overall, Tableau will be running off with a 4/5 for the augmented analytics category.\n\nReporting Capabilities: Qlik vs Tableau vs Power BI\n\nIn terms of report sharing and delivery, Power BI has some built-in functionality both within its desktop and online instance that don’t really flow well together. By uploading online, the reports created in Power BI Desktop, users can set up scheduled email subscriptions for those reports with role-based data access limitations. Admins have more control over the overall report adjustment and distribution process through the online instance since the desktop version is a bit limited on that front.\n\nFurthermore, the reports themselves can only be added to emails as attachments, but various file types are supported, such as PPTX, PDF, XLSX, etc. So, to summarize, Microsoft does provide reporting out-of-the-box; however, they really haven’t put much effort in smoothening the whole process throughout the Power BI platform versions.\n\nThis unintuitive design and setup have many users darting to the community forums for guidelines and even going as far as utilizing Power Automate, which requires a separate subscription in case you don’t have Microsoft 365 Suite subscription, to achieve a smoother distribution process. For that reason, we’ll be giving Power BI a 4/5 here.\n\nQlik Sense, on the other hand, doesn’t support report distribution and sharing from the get-go. Rather it requires a separate subscription to its Qlik NPrinting platform to make that work. The platform itself, though, is pretty rich in functionality and customization.\n\nUsers can set up scheduled email distribution, with different types of reports going to varying positions or roles. The elements for the reports can come from several apps at once, and the data can be customized and filtered as much as necessary. The reports sent to email can be both available as attachments and embedded within the message body.\n\nOverall, Qlik NPrinting is great for reporting and offers users a lot of options and flexibility; it’s just a shame that it doesn’t come included with Qlik Sense. So, we’ll award them a 4/5 for this section.\n\nSimilar to Power BI, Tableau also has some built-in reporting functionality, which comes in the form of site subscriptions. They need to first be enabled by the server administrator, and the recipient of the email report needs to have at least a Viewer license. Apart from that, users can add recipients to the relevant scheduled subscription service, which can send the report either as an image or a PDF file.\n\nBut let’s get one thing clear here, Tableau doesn’t actually have a report creation or customization option; it just allows you to share and distribute any regular dashboard as a report, which is quite basic, to say the least. And because of this limited functionality and flexibility, we’ll be giving Tableau a 3/5.\n\nMobile App Experience: Choosing the Best Interface\n\nPower BI’s mobile app is compatible with Android phones and tablets, iPhones and iPads, and, of course, Windows phones. With it, users can access their reports and dashboards in real-time through a great mobile interface.\n\nAdditionally, users can take advantage of the Q&A feature where they discover new insights just by typing, or in the mobile app’s case, even speaking naturally. Collaboration is also possible through comments, @mentions, and annotations.\n\nThe one limitation that we noticed was that users couldn’t develop new visualizations or dashboards on the go. Overall, apart from that restriction, we were pretty happy with the mobile experience of Power BI, and we’ll be giving it a nice 4/5.\n\nQlik Sense’s mobile app is only compatible with Android and iOS devices, so Windows phone users won’t be able to take advantage here. On the bright side, app users can view, analyze, control, and even create new dashboards and visualizations.\n\nQlik Sense’s mobile interface provides users with a quick and easy way to collaborate on projects, set up alerts, and find new insights through the Insight Advisor Chat Bot. Qlik also boasts that the dashboards built within the mobile app can seamlessly transition across all devices.\n\nFinally, there’s offline support, where users can download apps and data to interact with and explore before going into environments with unreliable connectivity. All of this combined equals a 5/5 for Qlik Sense in our books.\n\nTableau’s mobile app is also compatible only with Android and iOS devices, so it looks like Windows phone users will only be able to rely on Power BI. In terms of functionality, Tableau’s mobile app allows users to preview and interact with their workbooks, worksheets, and individual visualizations.\n\nCollaboration, sadly, isn’t an option yet, but on the bright side, since the June 2022 patch, users can share content directly with others.\n\nFurthermore, offline support allows previewing all the required data at any time regardless of internet connection. From what we’ve seen, creating new visualizations or workbooks isn’t possible. Ultimately, we’ll be rating the Tableau mobile app with a 4/5 for its pleasant interface, interactive options, and offline support.\n\nHave a data analytics project?\n\nB EYE partners with Qlik, Power BI, Tableau, and Snowflake Data Cloud.\n\nPricing Structures: Comparing Costs and Value\n\nMicrosoft offers two options to Power BI users – Power BI Pro and Power BI Premium, where the former has quite a few limitations and the latter provides a lot more functionality. Users have to option to try the tool out for free by downloading the Power BI desktop application. This free version allows for personal report and dashboard creation and limits the data source connections. In order to unlock the connecting, sharing, and collaborating options, users will need to pay $15 (per user/month) for a Power BI Pro license.\n\nTo get access to some of the more exciting features, though, customers will need to pay $29.9 (per user/month). This includes stuff like Dataflows, Advanced AI capabilities, paginated reports, etc. These license options are manageable for companies under 100 employees, but, naturally, bigger companies will need to contact Microsoft’s sales team for a custom-tailored price quote. Overall, we’ll award Power BI a 5/5 here for the price flexibility it provides.\n\nQlik’s price list, on the other hand, aims to get users straight into the action with their Qlik Sense Business license. It costs $30 (per user/month) and contains all the features that come built-in with Qlik Sense, with some limitations at places like the app size limit or the number of shared spaces a user can access. If unsure about the cost, clients can utilize the 30-day free trial to explore and test out this cloud-based version.\n\nThis license option is great for small businesses, but the bigger the company size, the more beneficial it becomes to request a custom price quote from Qlik’s sales team. In the end, the timed free trial and the lack of options Qlik Sense provides within its price list will net it a 4/5 in this category.\n\nLooking at Tableau’s prices, we can spot several different licenses which have varying prices depending on the client’s preferences to go with Tableau Server – the on-premises approach – or Tableau Cloud. Naturally, the cloud-based option costs a bit more.\n\nGoing through the different licensing tier features, we can see that Tableau Viewer costs $15 (per user/month) when activated in Tableau Cloud or $12 (per user/month) in Tableau Server. It’s only useful for users that want to view, analyze, and interact with data visualizations and workbooks but not create any themselves. That option is available with the Tableau Explorer license, which is $42 (per user/month) or $35 (per user/month) depending on the deployment approach again. It has some limitations in terms of what data governing, authoring, and preparing features it offers, but it’s useful enough to get users started.\n\nWhat most companies will likely go for, though, is the Tableau Creator license, which is their most expensive one – $75 (per user/month). It gives access to Tableau Desktop and Tableau Prep Builder, as well as Tableau Cloud or Server, and it’s the most complete version of the platform. Users also have the option of a free 14-day trial that gives them a taste of the full suite experience.\n\nOverall, Tableau offers business intelligence users some flexibility when it comes to choosing a license, but it’s also the most expensive tool out of the three. So, for that reason, we’ll be awarding it with a 4/5, as well.\n\nDiscover More: Gartner Magic Quadrant 2023: In-Depth Comparison of Power BI, Tableau, and Qlik\n\nTop Competitors to Qlik, Power BI, and Tableau\n\nAs a bonus, we thought we’d briefly talk about some competitors that are worth looking into or, at the very least, keeping an eye on.
