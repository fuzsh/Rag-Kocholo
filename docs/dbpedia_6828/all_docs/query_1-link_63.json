        "text": "Why We Need JWST\n\nScience is all about standing on the shoulders of giants, and thatâs certainly the case for JWST. The observatory builds upon three decades of discoveries by the Hubble Space Telescope, which launched in 1990 and has revolutionized our understanding of the cosmos.\n\nEarthâs atmosphere distorts our view of distant celestial objects and blocks certain wavelengths of light, including slices of infrared that human eyes cannot see. Infrared-capable space telescopes can determine the atmospheric composition of planets orbiting other stars, look through clouds of dust and gas to see newborn stars, and even peer back through time to see galaxies that formed right after the Big Bang!\n\nJWST is able to see a much larger portion of the infrared spectrum than Hubble, and collects six times more light. It complements and extends Hubbleâs observations, becoming the worldâs newest premiere space observatory.\n\nSo far, we know of more than 4,000 exoplanets â planets orbiting stars. Do any of these worlds host life as we know it? JWST will take us another step closer to finding out. One of the ways we study exoplanets is by watching them pass in front of their host stars, which creates a small dip in the amount of starlight we see from Earth. Not only does the amount of light change, the type changes too, due to interactions between the starlight and exoplanetâs atmosphere.\n\nThese changes show up particularly well in the infrared, which is exactly the kind of light JWST is equipped to see. What are we looking for? Life on other worlds may be more exotic than anything weâve ever imagined, but it makes sense to start by looking for worlds like our own. An Earth-like planet would have an atmosphere made primarily of nitrogen and oxygen, with trace amounts of gases associated with life like methane and ozone. An early target for JWST will be TRAPPIST-1, a star system 40 light-years away that contains multiple planets in the habitable zone, the not-too-hot, not-too-cold region around a star where liquid water can exist on a planetâs surface.\n\nJWST is an international observatory. In addition to providing the Ariane 5 rocket, the European Space Agency contributed to two of JWSTâs four science instruments. The Canadian Space Agency also provided one instrument.\n\nIn order to see infrared light, JWST must block out heat from both the Sun and its own instruments. The first line of defense is a five-layer sunshield, which will keep the telescope chilled to -233 degrees Celsius (-388 degrees Fahrenheit). At a glance, JWSTâs sunshield looks a little like the solar sail aboard The Planetary Societyâs LightSail spacecraft. Although JWSTâs sunshield isnât used for propulsion, the Sunâs rays will still give it a push, so the spacecraft has a reflective trim tab that deploys at a different angle to help offset the forces of solar radiation.\n\nBut even a sunshield's not enough: JWST also needs to block out light from Earth and the Moon, which is difficult in Earth orbit. Therefore JWST is located at a special spot called L2, 1.5 million kilometers (932,000 miles) away. There, the Sun and Earthâs gravity balance out in a way that allows JWST to permanently keep the Sun, Earth, and Moon at its back while it observes the cosmos.\n\nOnce JWST arrived at L2 with its instruments and equipment deployed, the fun began. Light from distant objects bounces off its hexagonal mirrors, which are coated with a thin layer of gold to help it see better in the infrared. The light travels up to a secondary mirror, which focuses it into a beam the size of a dinner plate, sending it back through a hole in the center of the primary mirror. From there, it is focused further and can be sent through 4 different science instruments.\n\nThe farther away objects are, the longer it takes their light to reach us, meaning when we look at a distant galaxy, we are actually seeing what that galaxy looked like in the past. When you look at the Moon, you are seeing it as it existed 1 second ago. The sunlight warming your face on a beautiful day is eight minutes old. The Andromeda Galaxy, which looks like a smudge of light through binoculars, is actually 2.5 million years older than it appears now!\n\nJWST can see galaxies up to 13.4 billion years old, just 400 million years after the Big Bang. Galaxies at this distance are quickly speeding away from us due to the expansion of the universe. This makes the wavelength of their light longer due to the Doppler effect â the same phenomenon that causes an ambulance siren to sound higher-pitched as it approaches you and lower-pitched after it passes you.\n\nLong-wavelength light from objects formed even closer to the Big Bang is shifted deep into the infrared; in some cases beyond Hubbleâs capabilities. JWST may be able to see objects as far back as 100 million years after the Big Bang, which will help us better understand our cosmic origin story."
