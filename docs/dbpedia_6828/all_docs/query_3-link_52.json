        "text": "Understanding the Challenge\n\nTo appreciate the magnitude of testing, it's important to understand how Webb works.\n\nWebb's primary mirror detects infrared light and reflects it onto a smaller secondary mirror, which then directs the light into the scientific instrument compartment for processing. To make that happen, Webb must unfurl from its compact stowed configuration, a complex series of mechanical articulations that starts with solar array to provide power and includes the tennis court sized sunshield that shades the cold part of the Observatory from the heat and light of the sun.\n\nTo say it's a complex operation understates the matter: there were more than 344 possible single points of failure in the system, meaning if anything went wrong it could jeopardize the entire mission.\n\nTo ensure the mission went smoothly, Northrop Grumman, alongside NASA, developed a testing regime for a telescope that had to unfold in space — the first time that had ever been done. This was especially challenging since there is no facility in the world large enough to test the entire observatory under the conditions it would encounter in space.\n\nTesting in Action\n\nTesting wasn't just about proving that the design worked. Because nothing like Webb had been built before, at every stage, testing actually helped to drive the design process and generate a better end product.\n\nIn the case of the sunshield, for example, Arenberg explained, \"We built a one-third scale unit and tested it in a vacuum chamber.\" Those tests helped to drive future iterations of this key component.\n\nIn particular, the testing team took a deep dive into the operations of the sunshield's technologically complex folding membrane.\n\n\"We took a section of that membrane, all folded up, and put it in a cold chamber to see how it might act differently than in an ambient test,\" Flynn said. \"We got that difference, and we ran some analytical models to understand the rotation of the hinges and other operations.\"\n\nWith Webb, as with any of the complex systems Northrop Grumman designs, \"the point of testing is to understand how it performs,\" Arenberg said. \"In the early phases, it's about understanding the fundamental physics of the system, the role of workmanship. Then as we move toward the latter part of the program, it's all about: Did we implement our design properly? Does it work as expected? Did we remember everything?”"
