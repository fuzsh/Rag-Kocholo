Webb Society is a group of individuals who so believe in SENG's mission and vision that they leave SENG in their estate plans.\n\n​\n\nSpecifically, people who make planned gifts, such as bequests, trusts, charitable gift annuities, and more, are eligible for induction to the Webb Society in perpetuity, as well as those who make endowment gifts over $5,000. Donors who give one-time gifts of $500+ to the James T. Webb Scholarship Fund may be members of the Webb Society for that year.\n\nBecause of the extraordinary commitments made to SENG by this legacy circle, they will be invited to special meetings with the President of the Board and Executive Director, receive stakeholder updates, and enjoy benefits, like complimentary membership, SENG merchandise, the Webb Society dinner, and more.\n\n​\n\nMost importantly, Webb Society members will be able to create their own legacy for the GT/2E community, just as Jim Webb did, and honor his memory in perpetuity."
