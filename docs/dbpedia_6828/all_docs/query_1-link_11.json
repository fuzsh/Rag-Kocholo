        "text": "James Henry Webb Jr. (born February 9, 1946) is an American politician and author. He has served as a United States senator from Virginia, Secretary of the Navy, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs, Counsel for the United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and is a Marine Corps officer.\n\nOutside of working in government, Webb has also worked as a journalist, filmmaker, and author of ten books. In addition, he taught literature at the United States Naval Academy and was a Fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics. As a member of the Democratic Party, Webb announced on November 19, 2014, that he was forming an exploratory committee to evaluate a run for President of the United States in 2016. On July 2, 2015, he announced that he would be joining the race for the Democratic nomination for president, but stepped down from running in the primaries on October 20, 2015, stating that he was \"not comfortable\" with many political positions from the party's leadership.\n\nIn 2020, Webb was named the first distinguished fellow of University of Notre Dame's International Security Center.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nWebb was born in St. Joseph, Missouri, to James Henry Webb, and his wife, Vera Lorraine (Hodges). The second of four children and the older son, he grew up in a military family, moving frequently as his father's career in the United States Air Force required. The family crisscrossed the country, living in Missouri, Illinois, Texas, Alabama, Nebraska, California, and Virginia, as well as in England, where his father was an exchange officer with the Royal Air Force. His father flew B-17s and B-29s during World War II, and flew Air Force cargo aircraft during the 1948-49 Berlin airlift. After developing an inner ear disorder, Meniere's Disease, he became a pioneer in the Air Force missile program, later serving as the commanding officer of the 1001st Missile Squadron at Vandenberg Air Force Base. Webb's parents are buried at the Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nWebb is descended from Scots-Irish immigrants from Ulster who emigrated in the mid-18th century to the British North American colonies. Webb's 2004 book Born Fighting: How the Scots-Irish Shaped America details his family history, noting that his ancestors fought in every major American war. A 2014 TV documentary on the Smithsonian Channel, also entitled Born Fighting, was adapted from Webb's book and is narrated by him.\n\nWebb attended more than a dozen schools across the U.S. and in England. After graduating from high school in Bellevue, Nebraska, he attended the University of Southern California on a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps scholarship from 1963 to 1964 and he also was a member of Delta Chi. In 1964, Webb earned appointment to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. At Annapolis, Webb was a member of the Brigade Honor Committee and the Brigade Staff. When he graduated in 1968, he received the Superintendent's Letter for Outstanding Leadership. After his medical retirement from the Marine Corps due to injuries received in Vietnam, Webb enrolled in law school at Georgetown University where he earned a Juris Doctor and received the Horan Award for excellence in legal writing.\n\nMilitary service\n\nAfter graduating from the Naval Academy, Webb was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps. Attending the Marine Corps Officer Basic School shortly after leaving Annapolis, he graduated first in his class. He was promoted to first lieutenant in the second half of his tour in Vietnam. He served as a platoon commander with Delta Company, 1st Battalion 5th Marines. He was awarded the Navy Cross for heroism in Vietnam, the second-highest decoration in the Navy and Marine Corps. Webb also was awarded the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars, and two Purple Hearts. After returning from Vietnam, he was assigned to Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, as an instructor for Officer Candidates School (OCS). He was then assigned to the Secretary of the Navy's office for the remainder of his active duty. His war wounds left him with shrapnel in his knee, kidney, and head. The injury to his knee led a medical board to recommend his medical retirement.\n\nAwards and decorations\n\nKnown decorations and medals include:\n\nNavy Cross Silver Star Bronze Star Purple Heart Achievement Medal Combat Action Ribbon National Defense Service Medal Vietnam Campaign Medal\n\nWebb received the Navy Cross for actions on July 10, 1969.\n\nIn 1980, Webb was interviewed for Vietnam: The Ten Thousand Day War, a Canadian television documentary about the Vietnam War. In one segment, he discussed how hard it was to adjust to arriving in Vietnam. \"we stepped off an air conditioned plane, where I just watched a first-run movie, and you know, this German stewardess says, 'have a nice war.\"\n\nIn the October 13, 2015, CNN Democratic Debate, when asked, \"Which enemy are you most proud of?\", Webb stated, \"I'd have to say, the enemy soldier that threw the grenade that wounded me, but he's not around right now to talk to.\"\n\nIn a November 19, 2006 appearance on Meet the Press, Webb told host Tim Russert, \"I'm one of these people who – there aren't many of us – who can still justify for you the reasons that we went into Vietnam, however screwed up the strategy got.\"\n\nPost-military career\n\nWebb attended Georgetown Law Center from 1972 to 1975, graduating with a Juris Doctor degree. While at Georgetown, he wrote his first book, Micronesia and U.S. Pacific Strategy.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1981, Webb worked on the staff of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs. During this time, he also represented veterans pro-bono. Webb taught at the Naval Academy and was criticized for a 1979 article published in Washingtonian magazine, titled \"Women Can't Fight\" (see \"2006 Senate campaign\" below). He attended the 1980 Republican National Convention in Detroit and led the Pledge of Allegiance in the opening session.\n\nDuring the Reagan Administration, Webb served as the nation's first Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs from 1984 to 1987. In 1987, he served as Secretary of the Navy, becoming the first Naval Academy graduate to serve as the civilian head of the Navy. As Navy Secretary, Webb pushed the appointment of Alfred M. Gray, Jr. as Commandant of the Marine Corps, hoping that Gray could reshape the Corps into the elite unit it once was. Webb resigned in 1988 after refusing to agree to reduce the size of the Navy. Webb had wished to increase the Navy to 600 ships. As revealed in The Reagan Diaries, President Ronald Reagan wrote on February 22, 1988: \"I don't think Navy was sorry to see him go.\"\n\nIn a 1990 New York Times opinion piece, Webb opposed further U.S. military escalation in Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Shield citing lack of a coherent strategy and consent from the United States Congress. He also warned against a permanent military presence in the Middle East.\n\nDuring the 2004 presidential campaign, Webb wrote an op-ed piece for USA Today in which he, as a military veteran, evaluated the candidacies of John Kerry and George W. Bush. He criticized Kerry for the nature of his opposition to the Vietnam War in the 1970s while affiliated with the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, and accused Bush of using his father's connections to avoid service in Vietnam. Webb wrote that Bush had \"committed the greatest strategic blunder in modern memory\" with the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nWebb supported Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey's campaign for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. In 1994, he endorsed incumbent Democrat Charles Robb for reelection to his Senate seat, over Webb's former Naval Academy classmate Oliver North; like Webb, both Robb and North were decorated Marine veterans of the Vietnam war. Webb subsequently endorsed Republican George Allen over Robb in 2000, and then ran against Allen himself in 2006.\n\nUnited States Senate\n\n2006 Senate campaign\n\nMain article: 2006 United States Senate election in Virginia\n\nIn late 2005, a campaign to draft Webb to run for the Senate in 2006 began on the internet, promoted by netroots activists such as those at the blog Raising Kaine. On February 7, 2006, he announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for the 2006 Senate race against incumbent Virginia Senator George Allen.\n\nIn the Democratic primary on June 13, 2006, Webb faced longtime businessman and lobbyist Harris Miller. Webb won with 53.5% of the vote, in a race with low turnout.\n\nOn August 11, 2006, an incident occurred in which Allen used the word macaca to refer to Webb campaign associate S.R. Sidarth, who was filming an event as a \"tracker\" for the Webb campaign. A poll the following week showed Webb gaining 10 percentage points. The race, which at one point looked like a sure win for Allen, became one of the most watched and closest races of the 2006 elections. Webb's entry into the race and primary victory changed the political landscape. Political analyst Larry Sabato said in May that \"Jim Webb is George Allen's worst nightmare: a war hero and a Reagan appointee who holds moderate positions.... Allen tries to project a Reagan aura, but Webb already has it.\"\n\nOn September 7, 2006, Webb released his first television advertisement, which included footage of a 1985 speech by Ronald Reagan that praised Webb's service as a Marine. The next day, the Chief of Staff for the Reagan Library wrote Webb's campaign on behalf of former first lady Nancy Reagan, urging them not to air the advertisement saying it was neither fair nor respectful because it gave the impression of an endorsement. The Webb campaign disagreed, saying, \"What Reagan said about Jim Webb, that belongs to Jim Webb, frankly.\" The library said they ask all candidates to refrain from using the former president's image but declined to say if they would request the Allen campaign to remove the image of Reagan used on his campaign website.\n\nFive female graduates of the United States Naval Academy held a press conference, decrying Webb's 1979 article, \"Women Can't Fight.\" The women said Webb's article contributed to an atmosphere of hostility and harassment towards women at the academy. Webb was later endorsed by nine military women who stated that Webb is a \"man of integrity\" who \"recognizes the crucial role that women have in the military today.\"\n\n..... The press release said that the passages showed a \"continued pattern of demeaning women\". Allen's campaign refused to tell a local radio news station, WTOP-FM, whether it in fact had issued a news release on the matter.\n\nIn response, Jim Webb explained to The Washington Post, \"I actually saw this happen in a slum in Bangkok when I was there as a journalist.\" According to an article on Raw Story, the conservative website CNS News cited a case in Nevada in which a Cambodian mother was arrested for a similar act. According to the CNS article, an office manager for the Cambodian Association of America confirmed it is a cultural norm in Thailand and Cambodia.\n\nOn November 9, 2006, after AP and Reuters projected that Webb had won the seat, Allen conceded the election. Although the margin was narrow – less than half of 1% of the total vote and therefore small enough under Virginia law to allow demanding a recount – Allen stated that he would not challenge the result.\n\nSenator-elect\n\nOn November 15, 2006, Senate majority-leader-in-waiting Harry Reid assigned Webb to three committees: the committees on Foreign Relations, Veterans' Affairs, and Armed Services.\n\n\"That same day, an op-ed authored by Webb appeared in the pages of The Wall Street Journal. Titled 'Class Struggle: American workers have a chance to be heard'. The piece addressed the harmful economic inequality in the U.S., with the elites on one side and American workers on the other side. The article cites the \"age of globalization and outsourcing, and with a vast underground labor pool from illegal immigration\", as well as extravagant executive compensation, the detrimental effects of free trade and globalization, iniquitous tax cuts, speedily rising health care costs, and stagnation in income as the reasons for the increasing disparity between the elites and American workers.\n\nExchange with President Bush\n\nOn November 28, 2006, at a White House reception for those newly elected to Congress, Webb did not choose to wait in the line to have his picture taken with the president, whom Webb often criticized during the campaign. The president approached Webb later and asked him, \"How's your boy?\", referring to Webb's son, a Marine serving in Iraq. Webb replied \"I'd like to get them out of Iraq, Mr. President.\" Bush responded, \"That's not what I asked you. How's your boy?\", Webb responded, \"That's between me and my boy, Mr. President.\" The Hill cited an anonymous source who claimed that Webb was so angered by the exchange that he confessed he was tempted to \"slug\" the president. Webb later remarked in an interview, \"I'm not particularly interested in having a picture of me and George W. Bush on my wall.\"\n\nIn response to the incident, some conservatives criticized Webb, including George Will, who called Webb a \"boor\" and wrote, \"[Webb] already has become what Washington did not need another of, a subtraction from the city's civility and clear speaking.\" Others, such as conservative columnist and former Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan, reserved their criticism for Bush, writing: \"I thought it had the sound of the rattling little aggressions of our day, but not on Mr. Webb's side.\"\n\nWebb was asked about the exchange in a January 4, 2007 appearance on Hardball with Chris Matthews.\n\nAfter his son returned from Iraq, Webb \"buried the hatchet\" with the president by setting up a private chat with his son, the president, and himself in the Oval Office.\n\nTenure as Senator\n\nOn January 3, 2007, Webb was sworn into the 110th U.S. Senate, accompanied by Sen. John Warner, R-Va., a fellow former Secretary of the Navy; and former Virginia Democratic Sen. Chuck Robb, who held the same seat before losing to Allen. On his first day in the Senate, Webb introduced the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act, to expand benefits for military families, which he had written. The act replaces key provisions of the Montgomery G.I. Bill for recent veterans and \"makes veterans benefits identical to those soldiers received following World War II\". \"With many of our military members serving two or three tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is past time to enact a new veterans' education program modeled on the World War II era G.I. bill. This is exactly what our legislation does\", Webb said. It became law on June 30, 2008, as part of the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008.\n\nOn January 23, 2007, Webb delivered the Democratic response to the president's State of the Union address, focusing on the economy and Iraq. Webb's speech drew positive reviews, and was regarded as one of the stronger State of the Union responses in recent memory.\n\nOn March 5, 2007, Webb introduced his second piece of legislation, S. 759, intended to prohibit the use of funds for military operations in Iran without the prior approval of Congress. In a statement on the floor of the Senate, Webb said, \"The major function of this legislation is to prevent this Administration from commencing unprovoked military activities against Iran without the approval of the Congress. The legislation accomplishes this goal through the proper constitutional process of prohibiting all funding for such an endeavor.\"\n\nOn March 26, 2007, a senatorial aide of Webb, Phillip Thompson, was arrested for carrying Webb's loaded pistol as he entered the Russell Senate Office Building and for carrying unregistered ammunition. The weapon was discovered when Thompson went through an X-ray machine with a briefcase that contained a loaded pistol and two additional loaded magazines. Charges against the aide were dismissed after prosecutors concluded it could not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Thompson was aware that the gun and ammunition were in the briefcase.\n\n2009 visit to Southeast Asia\n\nSee also: Burma – United States relations\n\nOn August 14, 2009, Webb visited Myanmar (Burma), seeing its junta's leader, Gen. Than Shwe, and also the pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who was under house arrest. During Webb's visit with Than Shwe, Webb negotiated the release and deportation of an imprisoned American, John Yettaw. Upon his return to the U.S., Webb wrote an editorial titled \"We Can't Afford to Ignore Myanmar\" for The New York Times, arguing for the easing of sanctions on the country. Webb stated that sanctions have isolated the country, thereby encouraging the ruling regime to turn to China and allowing \"China to dramatically increase its economic and political influence in Myanmar, furthering a dangerous strategic imbalance in the region.\" Webb also noted that, unlike Myanmar, China does not allow opposition parties. Webb has stated that he started the pivot to Asia during the Bush Administration.\n\nWebb visited Vietnam as part of a two-week trip to five Southeast Asian countries. Webb, who can speak Vietnamese, has had a continuous involvement in Asian and Pacific affairs that long predates his time in the Senate. In addition to his more recent visits as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Webb has worked and traveled throughout this vast region, from Micronesia to Burma, for nearly four decades, as a Marine Corps officer, a defense planner, a journalist, a novelist, a Department of Defense executive, and as a business consultant. He worked in the 1990s as a consultant for companies attempting to do business in Vietnam.\n\nRetirement from the U.S. Senate\n\nOn February 9, 2011, Webb announced that he would not run for re-election to his Senate seat in 2012.\n\nCommittee assignments\n\nCommittee on Armed Services\n\nSubcommittee on Airland\n\nSubcommittee on Personnel (Chairman)\n\nSubcommittee on SeaPower\n\nCommittee on Foreign Relations\n\nSubcommittee on African Affairs\n\nSubcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs (Chairman)\n\nSubcommittee on European Affairs\n\nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs\n\nJoint Economic Committee\n\n2008 vice presidential speculation\n\nMain article: 2008 Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection\n\nWebb was frequently mentioned as a possible vice presidential Democratic nominee for Barack Obama in 2008 due to his military experience and moderate policy positions. Although he said he was not interested in the vice presidency, speculations about his being picked by Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee at the time, were still heard.\n\nOn July 7, Webb effectively removed himself as a possible candidate for Vice President in a statement made to Time, stating that he intended to serve his term in the Senate and \"under no circumstances will I be a candidate for Vice President.\" Obama went on to choose fellow senator Joe Biden as his running mate.\n\n2016 presidential campaign\n\nOn November 19, 2014, Webb announced the formation of an exploratory committee in preparation for a possible bid for the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States in 2016. He made the announcement via a video posted on his website, as well as on YouTube.\n\nOn June 15, 2015, Webb announced he would make a decision regarding a presidential bid by the end of the month.
