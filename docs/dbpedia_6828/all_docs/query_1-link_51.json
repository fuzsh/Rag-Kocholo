He is spiritually led, floating between the spiritual realm and the very human space we all occupy here on earth. He provides a tool kit that includes everything you need to tap into your own spirit: meditation, vision boards, affirmative prayer, and channeled messages from his spiritual guides. He is thoughtful, humorous, sincere, and joyful. He draws from his keen intellect, his life experiences, and business acumen to provide sound and inspirational guidance. With the twitch of an eyebrow, he pivots between conversations with Spirit and his own very human memories of even the right song to capture the moment. Ask him about “Motown Metaphysics”. A master teacher of A Course in Miracles, he grounds much of his teachings in this landmark guide to personal and spiritual transformation. “ Regina B Chesapeake VA"
