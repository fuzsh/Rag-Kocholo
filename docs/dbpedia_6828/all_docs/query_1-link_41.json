        "text": "Mr. James D. Webb, age 82, passed away Sunday, June 16, 2024 at Moses Cone Hospital. Funeral service will be held at 10:00 a.m. Saturday, June 22, 2024 at Mt. Pisgah Church with Dr. Jeff Johnsen officiating. Burial will follow at Westminster Gardens.\n\nJim was born to the late Dewey and Sylvia Webb in Roanoke, VA. He had a strong work-ethic and often shared stories about working at Mick-or-Mack grocery store, and delivering newspapers. For most of his working career he was employed as a provider associate for Blue Cross Blue Shield, Partners, and Travelers insurance companies, prior to United Healthcare where he retired. Jim loved classic cars and was an avid vintage toy collector. Gardening was also his passion. He took pride in his vegetable garden and maintained a beautiful, landscaped lawn. Being on his hands and knees pulling weeds and planting greenery was therapy to him, not work. After retirement, his main devotion was to his family.\n\nIn addition to his parents, he is preceded in death by his wife of 60 years, Norma June Barnett Webb.\n\nMr. Webb is survived by his sons Darren Webb and wife Michele of Greensboro, and Travis Webb and wife Erin of Summerfield; also surviving are his grandchildren Preston, Madeline, Landon, and Eliza, and his sister Anita Webb Hare.\n\nThe family will receive friends at George Brothers Funeral Service on Friday, June 21, 2024 from 5:00 p.m. -7:00 p.m.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials may be directed to Alzheimerâ€™s Foundation, https://www.alzfdn.org."
