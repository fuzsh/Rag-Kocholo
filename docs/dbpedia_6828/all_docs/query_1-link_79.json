        "text": "The decision to name this telescope after Webb was made by a different NASA administrator, Sean O'Keefe, who is now at Syracuse University. Like Webb, O'Keefe didn't have a background in science before coming to NASA, but rather he had one in professional management and administration.\n\nHe says in his field, Webb was a towering figure, who helped establish the National Academy of Public Administration and was a thought leader in developing the best ways of bringing people from diverse fields together to pursue ambitious goals.\n\nWhen O'Keefe took over the top job at NASA, he says, everyone was referring to an exciting new space telescope that was in development as the \"Next Generation Space Telescope.\"\n\n\"That's about as illuminating and exciting as, you know, whatever,\" says O'Keefe, who previously served as secretary of the Navy, a role that involves deciding on the name of ships.\n\nHe decided, after casual conversations with others at NASA, to name the new telescope after Webb. \"There was no appointed group of commissioners to come up with a name,\" says O'Keefe, who said everyone he spoke with seemed to like the idea."
