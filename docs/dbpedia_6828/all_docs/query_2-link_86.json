        "text": "President Johnson then went to a viewing of the USIA film on the March on Washington. The film had drawn strong criticism from southern senators, especially John McClellan, who argued that it portrayed the United States in an unfavorable light and therefore was an inappropriate product for the United States’ propaganda agency. The President’s difficulty was increased by the criticism the administration had come under from Robert Kennedy and supporters of the Attorney General for bowing to southern pressure and seeking to suppress a flattering portrayal of the civil rights movement.\n\nAfterward, Johnson ate lunch with Senator Richard Russell. The Georgia senator stayed on to join the President in a meeting to discuss nuclear testing matters with Robert McNamara, Dean Rusk, and AEC head Glenn Seaborg. Later in the afternoon, the President attended the dedication of the $9 million National Geographic Society building. In an idealistic address, he urged the creation of a world science pool, announcing that “the more we share with each other, the less we misunderstand each other.” Johnson speculated that the National Geographic Society could function as a “clearinghouse for knowledge” that brought “together men of science of every land.” He then departed for Camp David with Lady Bird, Hearst reporter Marianne Means, and his longtime Texas associate Horace Busby, who was soon to join the White House staff. Evening recreation was a round of bowling, followed by bed at 11:00.\n\nOn Sunday at Camp David, he talked primarily to close aides and friends, but recorded no calls. He held morning conversations with Richard Russell, Wesley West, R. E. Chambers, and Jesse Kellam—all of whom had figured prominently in his activities almost three weeks earlier on New Year’s Day at the ranch. He then surprised the circuit preacher at the Thurmont Methodist Church by showing up for morning services with Lady Bird, Means, Jack Valenti, and Busby and his wife. In the afternoon, he spoke to Thomas Mann, James “Scotty” Reston, Abe Fortas, Walter Jenkins, Pierre Salinger, Ken O’Donnell, and William Hagerty. He returned to the White House around 8:00 p.m."
