        "text": "January 24th, 1952 - January 5th, 2019\n\nIowa Chapter 31\n\nSons of AMVETS\n\n​James “Jim” “JR” Lee Webb, died on Saturday, January 5, 2019 at the age of 66 at his home. He was born January 24, 1952 in New Hampton, IA: the son of Dewayne and Darlene (Tonn) Webb.\n\nJim graduated from Waterloo West High School with the class of 1970. He was married to Janice Wood on July 15, 2000 in Waterloo.\n\nHe worked at John Deere Engine Works as an engine tester, retiring in 2001. Jim was a member of the Sons of AMVETS Evansdale Post #31 and ABATE of Iowa District 16. Jim spent time as a motorcycle safety instructor with ABATE and was financial secretary with the UAW Local 838. Jim served as Chapter 31 Rod Captain and planned many rides and kept many riders safe.\n\nHe enjoyed riding his Harley Davidson, NASCAR and watching dirt track racing. He loved traveling with Janice on his Harley.\n\nLast Chapter\n\nThe AMVETS Riders would like to honor all those faithful Riders who have passed from this life to the next. Their voices and the the roar of their motorcycles have been stilled, but their names and faces are indelibly etched in our hearts and minds. Their passing has left a void that will never be filled, but we are grateful to have had the opportunity to serve and ride alongside them. We were blessed to know them, and we pray that God will bless us to be reunited when it is our time to take the final ride. Now as they ride forever free across the heavens, these AMVETS Riders are part of an eternal fellowship,\n\n​The Last Chapter.\n\nArchives\n\nJuly 2024\n\nMay 2024\n\nOctober 2023\n\nSeptember 2023\n\nAugust 2023\n\nJune 2023\n\nDecember 2022\n\nNovember 2022\n\nMay 2022\n\nApril 2022\n\nMarch 2022\n\nJanuary 2022\n\nSeptember 2021\n\nAugust 2021\n\nJune 2021\n\nJanuary 2021\n\nDecember 2020\n\nOctober 2020\n\nSeptember 2020\n\nAugust 2020\n\nJuly 2020\n\nMarch 2020\n\nDecember 2019\n\nAugust 2019\n\nMay 2019\n\nMarch 2019\n\nFebruary 2019\n\nJanuary 2019\n\nDecember 2018\n\nNovember 2018\n\nSeptember 2018\n\nJune 2018\n\nMarch 2018\n\nApril 2017\n\nMarch 2017\n\nJanuary 2017\n\nNovember 2016\n\nJuly 2016\n\nJanuary 2016\n\nJuly 2015\n\nJune 2015\n\nFebruary 2015\n\nJanuary 2015\n\nNovember 2014\n\nSeptember 2014\n\nAugust 2014\n\nJune 2014\n\nApril 2014\n\nFebruary 2014\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nDecember 2013\n\nNovember 2013\n\nJuly 2013\n\nDecember 2012\n\nOctober 2012\n\nJuly 2012\n\nMarch 2011\n\nMay 2010\n\nRSS Feed"
