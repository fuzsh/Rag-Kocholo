        "text": "Refresh\n\nInvestigating the origins of 3 of the universe's earliest galaxies\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has helped astronomers see what could be three of the universe's earliest galaxies. The galaxies are seen as they were when the 13.8 billion-year-old cosmos was between 400 million and 600 million years old.\n\nThe three galaxies are in the process of forming as the JWST imaged them, feeding on surrounding hydrogen and helium to facilitate the creation of new stars and, thus, their growth. Though shapeless and disorganized, as we see them less than a billion years after the Big Bang, these galaxies will eventually evolve into more familiar morphologies, such as the spiral shape of the Milky Way.\n\n\"You could say that these are the first 'direct' images of galaxy formation that we've ever seen,\" study lead author Kasper Elm Heintz, an astrophysicist at the Cosmic Dawn Center, said in a statement. \"Whereas James Webb has previously shown us early galaxies at later stages of evolution, here we witness their very birth, and thus, the construction of the first star systems in the universe.\"\n\nRead more: James Webb Space Telescope spots 3 of our universe's earliest galaxies\n\nNo we haven't spotted life on an alien planet (yet)\n\nLast year, it was widely reported that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) had spotted what could be the telltale signs of life in the atmosphere of a distant extrasolar planet, or exoplanet.\n\nIt had been reported that the powerful space telescope had seen dimethyl sulfide, or DMS, in the atmosphere of the exoplanet K2-18 b, a super-Earth located around 120 light-years from Earth. This was significant because on Earth DMS is created primarily by ocean phytoplankton.\n\nNew research suggests, however, that this detection was a false positive with a reassessment of the JWST data, causing the DMS signal to fade away. The research calls into question whether the JWST would even be capable of seeing DMS unless it is in incredibly large volumes in the atmosphere of this super-Earth.\n\n\"The signal strongly overlaps with methane, and we think that picking out DMS from methane is beyond this instrument's capability,\" team member and UCR project scientist Shang-Min Tsai said in a statement.\n\nRead more: Did the James Webb Space Telescope really find life beyond Earth? Scientists aren't so sure\n\nA new stunning view of the Horsehead Nebula\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has proved to be the \"mane\" telescope when it comes to looking at stunning celestial objects.\n\nThe JWST was able to see never-before-seen details of the Horsehead Nebula, also known as Barnard 33, revealing some regions of this iconic astronomical target in a completely new light.\n\nThe JWST images show turbulent waves of gas rising from the western side of Orion B, a star-forming molecular cloud located 1,300 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Orion, where the nebula is located.\n\nInvestigating the starburst Cigar Galaxy\n\nUsing its powerful and sensitive infrared eye, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has peered through the dense gas and dust at the heart of the Cigar Galaxy to investigate a region of intense star formation.\n\nThis starburst galaxy, also known as Messier 82 (M82), produces stars around 10 times as fast as our galaxy, the Milky Way. Much of this star birth is concentrated in a central region, which NIRCam imaged in long and short-wave infrared light. This revealed a hitherto unknown connection between sooty chemical molecules known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and structures of hot ionized gas.\n\n\"M82 has garnered a variety of observations over the years because it can be considered as the prototypical starburst galaxy,\" Alberto Bolatto, team leader and University of Maryland researcher, said in a statement. \"Both Spitzer and Hubble space telescopes have observed this target. With the JWST's size and resolution, we can look at this star-forming galaxy and see all of this beautiful new detail.\"\n\nRead More: James Webb Space Telescope gets to the heart of a smoking starburst galaxy (images)\n\nSolving the mystery of gas giant formation\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has investigated gas flowing from a protoplanetary disk surrounding an infant star, an outflow known as \"disk winds.\" The observations could help scientists better understand how gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn are born.\n\nThe team behind the study focused the JWST on a young, low-mass star called T Cha, located around 350 light-years from Earth. This star is known to have a large gap in the protoplanetary disk that swirls around it. Gaps like this indicate a budding young planet is moving around the star, gathering material.\n\nBy studying how gas escapes from this disk, the team could learn what conditions favor the formation of gas giants and what conditions favor the formation of rocky planets like Earth.\n\n\"Rocky planets very close to the star will have very little or no atmosphere [like Mercury], as it will be stripped away by the sun's high energy photons — similar to photoevaporation,\" Naman Bajaj, lead author of the new disk-wind analysis and a scientist with the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Science Laboratory, told Space.com. \"For gas giants, if they happen to form close to the star, it is possible that they find a balance between their gas and the sun's energy.\"\n\nRead more: The James Webb Space Telescope is digging deep into the mysteries of gas planets\n\nThat's cool! Icy ingredients for life swirl around infant stars\n\nAstronomers have used the James Webb Space Telescope to spot several of the building blocks of stars, planets, and even life in ice form swirling around two infant stars, or \"protostars.\"\n\nThe complex organic molecules (COMs) spotted range from relatively simple molecules to complex compounds. Some of the familiar compounds spotted around the protostars IRAS 2A and IRAS23385 include ethanol, which we call alcohol on Earth, acetic acid found in vinegar, and formic acid, the compound that makes bee stings and ant bites painful.\n\nThe discovery of the compounds around IRAS 2A is particularly interesting because these protostars, a lot like the sun, would have 4.6 billion years ago in its infancy before the formation of the planets. That means the discovery of these icy compounds may help confirm that the vital ingredients for life were delivered to Earth by comet bombardments.\n\n\"This finding contributes to one of the long-standing questions in astrochemistry,\" team leader and Leiden University researcher Will Rocha said in a statement. \"What is the origin of COMs in space? Are they made in the gas phase or in ice? The detection of COMs in ices suggests that solid-phase chemical reactions on the surfaces of cold dust grains can build complex kinds of molecules.\"\n\nRelated: James Webb Space Telescope spots the icy building blocks of life swirling around infant stars\n\nChecking Hubble's work complicates expanding universe picture\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has double-checked the Hubble Space Telescope's calculations of the expanding universe, finding its older sibling telescope was spot on the money. This possibly intensifies an existing headache for cosmologists called the \"Hubble tension.\"\n\nThe Hubble Tension arises from the fact that measurements of the rate of the expansion of the universe made with a cosmic fossil called the cosmic microwave background (CMB) don't tally with a measurement technique referred to as the \"cosmic distance ladder.\" One possibility for Hubble tension was that measurements made by the Hubble telescope to form the bottom rung of this ladder were inaccurate.\n\nThis distance ladder is made up of \"rungs\" of different techniques to measure increasingly larger cosmic distances. The JWST discovered that the bottom rung, measurements to stars that pulse in brightness called \"Cepheid variables,\" isn't a little loose after all. Observations made with the increased resolution of the JWST revealed that a suspected error in Hubble's measurement of Cepheid variables isn't present.\n\n\"We've now spanned the whole range of what Hubble observed and we can rule out a measurement error as the cause of the Hubble tension with very high confidence,\" research leader and John Hopkins University scientist Adam Riess said in a statement. \"With measurement errors negated, what remains is the real and exciting possibility we have misunderstood the universe.\"\n\nRead more: James Webb Space Telescope complicates expanding universe paradox by checking Hubble's work\n\nHow do some balck holes get so big?\n\nUsing the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) researchers identified a population of supermassive black hole-powered quasars that could help explain how such objects grew to sizes equivalent to millions or billions of times that of the sun.\n\nThe relatively small quasars, which were identified as tiny red dots of light, represent a transitional stage on the road to becoming truly gigantic supermassive black holes. This means that this quasar population could fill a mass gap, the existence of which has perplexed scientists.\n\n\"One issue with quasars is that some of them seem to be overly massive, too massive given the age of the universe at which the quasars are observed,\" Jorryt Matthee, lead author of the study and an assistant professor at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria, said in a statement. \"We call them the 'problematic quasars.'\"\n\nRead more: How do some black holes get so big?

Its red color comes from the shroud of gas and dust that surrounds it.\n\n\"Several other supermassive black holes in the early universe have now been found to show a similar behavior, which leads to some intriguing views of the black hole and host galaxy growth, and the interplay between them, which is not well understood,\" Princeton University researcher Jenny Greene said.\n\nRead more: James Webb Space Telescope finds 'extremely red' supermassive black hole growing in the early universe\n\nQuartz crystals detected on alien planet\n\nThousand-mile-per-hour winds are blowing a hail of tiny quartz crystals through the silicate-enhanced, scorching hot atmosphere of a distant gas giant planet called WASP-17b, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has found.\n\n\"We knew from Hubble [Space Telescope] observations that there must be aerosols — tiny particles making up clouds or haze — in WASP-17b’s atmosphere, but we didn’t expect them to be made of quartz,\" Daniel Grant of the University of Bristol in the UK and leader of a new study on the discovery, said in a statement.\n\nRead more: James Webb Space Telescope detects quartz crystals in an exoplanet's atmosphere\n\nStunning image of young stars in the galaxy next door\n\nA star-studded cosmic neighbor 210,000 light-years away is now available to view on our computer screens in unprecedented detail, thanks to NASA’s mighty James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the power of modern internet connection.\n\nThe newly released James Webb Space Telescope photo captures NGC 346, a star-forming region in a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way called the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC).\n\nRead more and see the entire image: James Webb Space Telescope spotlights gorgeous young stars in a galaxy next door (photo)\n\nJWST strikes gold (again) with stunning images of the Ring Nebula\n\nApproximately 2,200 light-years from where you're sitting lie the Cheerio-shaped remains of a dying star — remnants that form a structure famously known as the Ring Nebula.

At this temperature, the exoplanet's atmosphere is likely extremely thin, if it exists at all, according to a statement from NASA.\n\nRead more: James Webb Space Telescope spies on rocky TRAPPIST-1 exoplanet, finds bad news for life\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope reveals how galaxies made the early universe transparent\n\nShortly after the Big Bang, the universe was a dark and mysterious place. The gas between stars and galaxies was opaque, so no light could shine through.\n\nUsing observations from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, an international team of astronomers led by Simon Lilly of ETH Zürich in Switzerland has found how the universe changed in opacity. The team looked back in time at galaxies from the end of the Era of Reionization, a dramatic period in the universe's history in which gas was heated, cooled and then reionized (given an electrical charge once again).\n\nRead more: James Webb Space Telescope reveals how galaxies made the early universe transparent\n\nJWST discovers 717 ancient galaxies\n\nThe James Webb Telescope has unveiled hundreds of ancient galaxies that could be among the first members of the universe — a leap from only a handful that were previously known to exist at the time.\n\n93% of the newfound galaxies that Webb spotted had never been seen before.\n\nRead more: James Webb Space Telescope discovers 717 ancient galaxies that flooded the universe with 1st light\n\nFaintest galaxy yet in the infant universe found\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has detected the faintest galaxy yet in the infant universe.\n\nThe galaxy, known as JD1, is part of the first generation of galaxies to pop up in our universe's 13.8-billion-year history.

Not long after, intriguing new results suggests astronomers are blasting past that metric with possible detections up to redshift 20. If confirmed, those galaxies are quite early, as they were in existence just 200 million years after the Big Bang.\n\nWebb then turned its attention to the most distant star, called Earendel, after a character in J.R.R. Tolkien's \"Lord of the Rings\" prequel \"The Silmarillion.\" The star's light took about 12.9 billion years to reach Earth and is now visible in a bit more detail than previous imaging from a Hubble Space Telescope deep field image.\n\nWebb also observed a wheel-shaped galaxy, called the Cartwheel, showing unprecedented detail in the galaxy's structure. Using infrared light, Webb detected individual stars within the galaxy's star-forming regions, and more young star clusters surrounding the galaxy's central supermassive black hole. These zones are full of dust and best visible in infrared light, which can peer through that.\n\nThe science scramble is in full swing!\n\nJust weeks into its tenure, the James Webb Space Telescope is keeping scientists and space fans busy.\n\nThe astronomy community's preprint server, arXiv.org, has seen a host of new papers analyzing JWST data. One particularly hot topic is the search for ever-more-distant galaxies: The observatory is now beating its own records, spotting galaxies that we may be seeing just 200 to 300 million years after the Big Bang.\n\nOther scientists are looking ahead to what the observatory will be able to uncover about supermassive black holes.\n\nMeanwhile, amateur image processors are digging into early observations, turning data into works of art, like a spiraling galaxy that looks like a wormhole. And for those more inclined to snail mail than high-tech image analysis, the U.S. Postal Service has a stellar new stamp on offer.\n\nBreaking records already!\n\nScientists are already making record-breaking discoveries in data from the James Webb Space Telescope. For example, astronomers have spotted two galaxies that may be the most distant ever seen. If the analysis is confirmed, we are seeing the galaxies as they existed 300 to 400 million years after the Big Bang.

The agency shared sample images that, while small, showcase the sharp focus of the instrument and offer a tantalizing look at what's to come. Read more>\n\nWebb cools down\n\nIn a new update, NASA revealed that the James Webb Space Telescope is almost fully-cooled.\n\nWebb observes in infrared light, which we know best as heat. To make sure its observations aren't contaminated by any heat from the scope itself, Webb has to be extremely cold. In a new blog post, NASA shared that the space telescope is very close to its final temperature.\n\nWebb's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) is now cooled to under 7 kelvins (-447 degrees Fahrenheit (-266 degrees Celsius) and so Webb's instruments are all at their operating temperatures. Now, the scope's mirrors just need to reach their final cooled-down temperatures.\n\nWebb meets crucial temperature milestone\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) finally reached the super-cold temperature needed to operate as designed. Because the instrument targets infrared light, which manifests as heat, the instrument must remain under 7 degrees Kelvin, which is equivalent to minus 447 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 266 degrees Celsius). And after a complicated, careful cooling process, that milestone has been reached, according to NASA. Read more>\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope most heat-sensitive instrument cooling to absolute zero\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope continues to cool down to its operating temperature of minus 369.4 degrees Fahrenheit ( minus 223 degrees Celsius) as it prepares to take its first scientific images of the distant universe this summer. One of the telescope's four instruments, the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI), needs some extra help from a dedicated cryocooler as it needs to get to an even colder temperature of minus 447 degrees F ( minus 266 degrees C), only 12 degrees F (7 degrees C) above absolute zero, the temperature where the motion of atoms stops.\n\nJust one alignment left\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has just one step of its seven-phase alignment process left to complete, NASA announced on April 1. The remaining step requires that the observatory's most heat-sensitive instrument, the mid-infrared instrument or MIRI cool even farther. That should occur in the next few weeks, NASA said, at which point mission personnel can begin calibrating the observatory's instruments.

Read our full story here.\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope notches \"fine phasing\" alignment milestone\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope keeps checking off boxes on the way toward the start of science operations this summer.\n\nThe Webb team has aligned the $10 billion scope's 18 primary mirror segments and focused them on a single star, NASA officials announced today (March 16). More fine-tuning work remains, but it's a huge milestone for the mission and for NASA.\n\n\"More than 20 years ago, the Webb team set out to build the most powerful telescope that anyone has ever put in space and came up with an audacious optical design to meet demanding science goals,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said in a statement today. \"Today we can say that design is going to deliver.\"\n\nRead the ful story here.\n\nNASA will update the public on Wednesday about progress aligning the James Webb Space Telescope's primary mirror. The golden mirror is made up of 18 hexagonal segments that must be in perfect alignment for the observatory to capture sharp images.\n\nAnd it sounds like that process is going well: NASA has promised a new image as well. \"Participants will share progress made in aligning Webb’s mirrors, resulting in a fully focused image of a single star,\" NASA officials wrote in a statement.\n\nThe NASA briefing will begin on Wednesday (March 16) at 12 p.m. EDT (1600 GMT) and you can watch live here at Space.com or directly via the agency's YouTube. Speakers will include:\n\nThomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator, Science Mission Directorate, NASA Headquarters in Washington\n\nLee Feinberg, Webb optical telescope element manager, NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland\n\nMarshall Perrin, Webb deputy telescope scientist, Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore\n\nJane Rigby, Webb operations project scientist, Goddard\n\nErin Wolf, Webb program manager, Ball Aerospace in Broomfield, Colorado\n\nWebb telescope to study quasars, Kuiper Belt\n\nAs the James Webb Space Telescope continues its checkout tests in deep-space, scientists continue to eagerly await the flood of science discoveries they hope to make with the $10 billion space observatory.\n\nOur latest updates on the Webb space telescope's mission have to do with the Kuiper Belt and quasars, targets both near (in astronomical scales) and far that Webb will observe to better understand the universe.\n\nFirst, the Kuiper Belt, which is home to icy objects leftover from the formation of the solar system. As contributing writer Elizabeth Howell writes today, some of Webb's earliest tasks will be to observe brilliant quasars at the heart of distant galaxies to study how these distant objects (powered by black holes billions of times the mass of our sun) shaped the early universe. You can read the full story here.\n\nMore closer to home is the Kuiper Belt, the stomping grounds for Pluto and its biggest moon Charon, which will be a target for Webb. As contributing writer Stefanie Waldek reports, another one of Webb's early science goals will be to observe Pluto and some other objects in the Kuiper Belt at the fringe of the solar system to track them over time and learn about their surface chemistry and why there is such a diverse range of objects there.\n\n\"Using Webb, we will be able to get information about surface chemistry that might be able to give us some clues into why there are these different populations in the Kuiper Belt,\" Heidi Hammel, a Webb interdisciplinary scientist for solar system observations, said in a statement.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWebb instrument work continues\n\nNASA engineers are working on the fourth stage of the long process to align the mirrors of the James Webb Space Telescope, according to a new statement from the agency.\n\nThe observatory's Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instrument has finished initial check-out and its three key mechanisms have successfully been characterized, the statement noted. The instrument will allow Webb to study the \"fingerprint\" of light of up to 100 galaxies at a time, giving scientists crucial information about mass, temperature and chemical composition.\n\nWe're also highlighting more of the research that Webb will execute once science observations begin, including studying strange \"sub-Neptunes\" and evaluating how the activity of stars might affect nearby planets.\n\nRead more\n\nNearly halfway through mirror alignment\n\nImage 1 of 2\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope team just completed the third of seven planned steps to align the 18 segments of Webb's big mirror.\n\nDuring the second stage, called \"segment alignment,\" the team corrected the positions of Webb's primary mirror segments and updated the alignment of the secondary mirror to bring the 18 individual images into focus. They then stacked the 18 images to produce one unified image. \"After future alignment steps, the image will be even sharper,\" NASA officials said in a statement Friday (Feb. 25).\n\nRead the full story\n\nWebb instrument work continues smoothly\n\nAs the James Webb Space Telescope continues the slow commissioning phase, work is going smoothly, according to a NASA statement published Thursday (Feb. 24). That update notes details about progress in several instruments, including filter wheel calibration for the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) and wheel tuning for the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam). Engineers are also working to precisely align the 18 hexagonal segments that make up the observatory's massive golden mirror.\n\nScience observations are not expected to begin until this summer, but there's plenty of science to get excited about during the wait. That science includes plans to contribute to the Event Horizon Telescope's observations of the black hole at the center of the Milky Way and a program to observe star formation currently hidden by layers of dust.\n\nSharpening sight\n\nThe first image NASA shared from the brand new James Webb Space Telescope showed a star warped over 18 different images due to inconsistencies in the mirror's alignment. Just a week later, a new image still shows one star 18 times, but now the sparkle forms a sort of cosmic snowflake as the observatory's image has sharpened. Read more>\n\nScience sneak peek: interstellar asteroids\n\nWhile James Webb Space Telescope engineers continue aligning the observatory's segmented golden mirror, scientists are looking ahead to the research the telescope will begin conducting this summer. Overall, the observations will range from our own solar system to the very earliest days of the universe.\n\nOne example of what astronomers hope to do with Webb? Study any interstellar objects that come rushing through our solar system. To date, scientists have spotted two: 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet Borisov in 2018. But the James Webb Space Telescope is more powerful than anything in the sky during those two visits, plus it has the capacity to observe in infrared, a key skill. Read more>\n\nIt's a lock!\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope's Fine Guidance Sensor has successfully locked onto a star for the first time, according to a NASA statement. The instrument plays a crucial role facilitating observations, since it keeps the telescope pointing toward the proper target. Read more>\n\nBefore science observations can begin, however, the observatory still needs to finish aligning the 18 hexagonal segments of its golden primary mirror, a process that the Fine Guidance Sensor also supports. Although Webb has begun gathering observations and shared its first images last week, those will show the same star multiple times until the mirror segments are properly aligned.\n\nWebb mission team ecstatic over first images\n\nToday (Feb. 11), NASA revealed that the James Webb Space Telescope has captured its first images of starlight.\n\nAnd, while the mission team is still cautiously looking ahead as there is much work to be done before the scope is fully operational and ready to begin science observations, they are ecstatic.\n\n\"After all these years, to actually see data when we're in zero gravity in space, it is emotional,\" Lee Feinberg, the Webb optical telescope element manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, told Space.com today during a news conference\n\nHowever, \"We still are being a little cautious, because we still have things that we have to get through ... but I will definitely say when I went home Saturday night, two days later [after the image was taken], I know my wife said to me it was the first time she'd seen me smile since December,\" he added.\n\nRead more about the team's excited response and Webb's thrilling milestone here.\n\nSee Webb's first view of space!\n\nNASA has unveiled Webb's first image. The photo, as seen above, shows a star called HD 84406 as seen through each of the observatory's 18 golden mirror segments as scientists continue to work to align the mirror to produce a single, ultra-crisp image of the universe.\n\nThe agency also posted a video sharing the story behind the image:\n\nBut that's not all the excitement for today! NASA has also released an annotated version of the same image, plus a \"selfie\" taken by the observatory of its own golden mirror. See those images and read more here>\n\nAnd don't forget to listen to NASA scientists talk about the new images live right now (11 a.m. EST/1600 GMT)! You can listen here at Space.com.\n\nFirst Webb images available tomorrow, NASA says\n\nNASA will release some of the first images taken by the James Webb Space Telescope on Friday (Feb. 11) at 10:30 a.m. EST (1530 GMT), according to an agency update. While these images are an important milestone in the observatory's commissioning, don't get your hopes up for the next great view of the universe: These are images taken during the mirror alignment process and are strictly utilitarian.\n\nIn addition, NASA will offer an update on its progress aligning the 18 mirror segments of Webb's massive primary reflector. The teleconference will begin at 11 a.m. EST (1400 GMT) and will be available to listen to on NASA TV or here at Space.com.\n\nSpeakers will include:\n\nLee Feinberg, Webb optical telescope element manager, NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland\n\nMarshall Perrin, Webb deputy telescope scientist, Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore\n\nMarcia Rieke, principal investigator for the NIRCam instrument and regents professor of astronomy, University of Arizona in Tucson\n\nWebb is painted black - but why?\n\nNASA's James Webb Space Telescope is finally at its home in space where it's preparing to observe the cosmos. But to do this, it has to stay ultra-cold. (Webb's \"cool side\" is minus 388 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 233 degrees Celsius).)\n\nWebb observes infrared light, aka heat, which means that to ensure that observations aren't affected by any additional warmth the scope has to stay super cold. To keep Webb cold enough, the mission team painted its radiator (which helps to radiate heat away from the telescope) and components an ultra-black color.\n\nRead more about Webb's paint job and why it has to stay so cold here.\n\n\"First light\" images coming soon\n\nNASA could be releasing the first images from the James Webb Space Telescope in the next few days, NASA's Webb program director Greg Robinson said in an agency town hall meeting today (Feb. 8). But don't expect these first images to be pretty.\n\n\"So the beautiful, very clear images that we expect to see, you'll see those in the summer sometime approximately six months after launch,\" Robinson said. \"Sometime next few days, you will see some of the first images that are not so clear ... the purpose of those is to align the mirrors and make sure the entire system is working,\" he added. \"We are in that process right now. We just recently started it. So stay tuned over the next few days on those.\"\n\nTelescope alignment begins\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope mission team has begun the three-month process of aligning the telescope, NASA officials announced today (Feb. 3).\n\n\"This milestone marks the first of many steps to capture images that are at first unfocused and use them to slowly fine-tune the telescope,\" NASA officials wrote in an update today. \"This is the very beginning of the process, but so far the initial results match expectations and simulations.\"\n\nRead the full story: Alignment of James Webb Space Telescope begins\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope's exoplanet plan, instruments on\n\nNASA flight controllers are have switched on the four main instruments aboard the James Webb Space Telescope as they prepare to snap the first images of a target star that will be used to align the observatory's 18-segment main mirror.\n\nThe instrument activation began last week. Here's our full report from senior writer Tereza Pultarova.\n\nMeanwhile, with Webb's commissioning underway, scientists are now eyeing a future of amazing astronomy with the huge space observatory. One scientist, the Ph.D. candidate Louis-Philippe Coulombe of the University of Montreal, wrote in an op-ed that he is eager to see how Webb will help map the atmosphere of exoplanets, something the observatory should be able to do better than any space telescope to date.\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope waking up\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is beginning to wake up.\n\nIn a town hall press conference on Friday (Jan. 28), scientists with NASA's Webb Space Telescope mission outlined the work so far to commission the observatory at its new home at the Earth-sun Lagrange point 2. During that virtual briefing, Webb scientists outlined the activation sequence for Webb's main instruments, as well as the months-long mirror alignment and focusing work that is underway now.\n\nRead our full story from Elizabeth Howell on Webb's commissioning work from the briefing.\n\nMeet Webb's 1st target star: HD 84406\n\nScientists with NASA's James Webb Space Telescope have picked the first star they will aim at with the new observatory and it's in a very familiar place.\n\nThe star, called HD 84406, is located in the constellation Ursa Major, the Big Bear, which is home to a star pattern you may know better as the Big Dipper.\n\nWebb scientists will use the star to focus each of the 18 mirror segments of Webb's primary mirror. HD 84406 is a sun-light star about 260 light-years from Earth, and may need binoculars to see clearly.\n\nHere's our full story on HD 84406, the first target of the James Webb Space Telecope.\n\nAlso this week, Bill Ochs, NASA's Webb telescope project manager, thanked the mission team for its amazing work and dedication to get the observatory to its L2 observing spot. Ochs quoted Jimmy Buffett as he hailed the team, changing some key lyrics.\n\nCheck it out!\n\nHello, instruments!\n\nAccording to an emailed statement from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), Webb will begin turning on its science instruments today (Jan. 28). That will include the Fine Guidance Sensor, which will guide the observatory's mirrors through the delicate alignment process to turn 18 small individual views into one massive view of the universe.\n\nIn the meantime, consider reading this op-ed from Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's associate administrator for science, celebrating the vast team behind the James Webb Space Telescope.\n\n\"We did it. We did it, and you can see that speck of light in the sky because of an incredible team with extraordinary tenacity,\" Zurbuchen wrote.

After just over a month in space (and decades in development), Webb is now at its observing site.\n\n\"We're a month in, and the baby hasn't even opened its eyes yet. But that's the science that we're looking forward to,\" Jane Rigby, Webb operations project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said during a media teleconference on Monday.\n\nYou can read Rigby's reaction and those of her Webb telescope colleagues in this update from today's teleconference by contributing writer Elizabeth Howell.\n\nSpace.com Senior Writer Chelsea Gohd has this account of Webb's arrival at L2 with comments from NASA chief Bill Nelson and others.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is \"home\"\n\nToday (Jan. 24), the James Webb Space Telescope arrived in orbit around L2, the second sun-Earth Lagrange point, its final destination after a long almost million-mile (1.5 million kilometers) journey from Earth.\n\nTo learn more about Webb's arrival at L2, check out this article on Space.com here.\n\nWebb arrives at L2!\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has arrived!\n\nWebb has completed the mid-course correction burn (MCC2), an insertion burn that has guided it into its orbit around its final home in space, NASA announced in a blog post today (Jan. 24).\n\nBeginning at 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT), the space telescope fired its onboard thrusters for about five minutes (297 seconds) to complete this burn maneuver. The burn added just about 2.6 miles per hour (1.6 meters per second) (a walking pace, NASA noted), to Webb's speed as the craft sailed into a halo orbit around its destination: L2, the second sun-Earth Lagrange point.\n\nL2, which lies just about a million miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth opposite the sun, is a gravitationally stable point that Webb will orbit as it works. Webb will spend the next few weeks in its new home cooling down before taking about five months to prepare its science instruments to get to work.\n\n\"Webb, welcome home!\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in the blog post. \"Congratulations to the team for all of their hard work ensuring Webb’s safe arrival at L2 today. We’re one step closer to uncovering the mysteries of the universe. And I can’t wait to see Webb’s first new views of the universe this summer!\"\n\nJoin NASA live at 3 p.m. EST (2000 GMT) here to learn more about the successful arrival and what's next for Webb.\n\nInsertion burn starting!\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has begun its mid-course correction burn (MCC2), the insertion burn that will ease it into its halo orbit around its ultimate home in space: L2, the second Lagrange point.\n\nLagrange points are gravitationally stable points in space, and L2 is located almost a million miles (1.5 million kilometers) away from Earth on the opposite side of the sun. This vantage point will help Webb to stay cold, which is crucial for its science instruments to work as planned.\n\nJoin NASA experts LIVE at 3 p.m. EST (2000 GMT) to hear about Webb's progress and new home at L2.\n\nNASA Live: Official Stream of NASA TV - YouTube\n\nWatch On\n\nAbout to begin insertion burn!\n\nNASA Live: Official Stream of NASA TV - YouTube\n\nWatch On\n\nWebb is about to fire its thrusters to get to its ultimate destination!\n\nToday (Jan. 24), the James Webb Space Telescope makes its arrival at its new home in space, in orbit around L2, the second sun-Earth Lagrange point which lies on the opposite side of Earth as the sun.\n\nTo get into orbit around L2, Webb is beginning what is known as the mid-course correction burn (MCC2), an insertion burn that will ease the space telescope into its operating orbit, a halo orbit, around L2.\n\nWebb will begin MCC2 at 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT) and, at 3 p.m. EST (2000 GMT), NASA officials will be updating the public and answering questions live right here.\n\nToday is the day!\n\nNearly a month after its stunning Christmas Day launch, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is due to arrive in orbit around L2 today (Jan. 24).\n\nAt about 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT), the mission team will direct the observatory to fire its thrusters for about five minutes, completing the long journey of nearly 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers).\n\nNASA will not be broadcasting the burn live, but scientists will be talking about what's next for the observatory during a 3 p.m. EST (2000 GMT) broadcast and the agency will hold a media teleconference at 4 p.m. EST (2100 GMT) as well. You can watch both events live on Space.com.\n\nAlthough arrival in orbit marks the last major milestone in the observatory's deployment, the telescope isn't quite ready to do science. The mission team still needs to precisely align the 18 golden mirror segments into one vast reflector and to calibrate the observatory's instruments.\n\nNASA has said to expect the James Webb Space Telescope to begin science operations this summer.\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope 1 day from L2\n\nNASA's James Webb Space Telescope is one day away from arriving at its final destination for its ambitious science mission: a gravitationally stable point in space known as the Earth-sun Lagrange point 2, or L2.\n\nAs of 8 a.m. EST (1300 GMT), the Webb Space Telescope was about 17,310 miles (27,854 kilometers) away from the L2 location, and about 893,897 miles (1,438,484 km) from the Earth. The L2 location is nearly 1 million miles from Earth on the opposite side of the Earth from the sun.\n\nWebb is expected to enter orbit around the L2 point on Monday, Jan. 24. To do so, it will fire its thrusters at 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT) on Monday for a few minutes to push it the final distance into L2 orbit.\n\nNASA is expected to host a live webcast of the L2 arrival insertion burn and follow it up with a NASA Science Live program to discuss the event at 3 p.m. EST (2000 GMT). At 4 p.m. EST (2100 GMT), NASA will hold a press teleconference on the event to discuss the next steps for the space telescope.\n\nL2 on Monday\n\nNASA's James Webb Space Telescope is just a few days away from its arrival at its home in space: L2, or the second Lagrange point, gravitationally stable points in space. L2 is positioned on the side of Earth opposite the sun.\n\nWhile NASA had previously expected Webb to arrive at L2 on Jan. 23, 29 days after its Dec. 25 launch, Webb is now expected to begin its mid-course correction burn (MCCB), or insertion burn, into an orbit around L2 on Monday (Jan. 24).\n\nYou'll be able to watch a live broadcast with scientists and engineers operating the space telescope on Monday at 3 p.m. EST (2000 GMT).\n\nNext stop, L2.\n\nWebb's next major milestone will be its arrival in orbit around a point in space called the Earth-sun Lagrange point 2, or L2. This video explains where L2 is and why the observatory will camp out in orbit around it.\n\nMirror deployment is complete\n\nThe 18 primary mirror segments of the James Webb Space Telescope are fully deployed, according to a tweet from NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. The observatory has one deployment milestone outstanding, a final course correction burn. Read more>\n\nFast forward to Webb's first look\n\nNASA is continuing to adjust the individual mirror segments of the James Webb Space Telescope as the observatory continues its trek to orbit nearly 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) away from Earth. In the meantime, we're looking ahead to the big moment: What will the observatory look at first? Read more>\n\nTime to adjust those mirrors\n\nNASA has confirmed that the team behind the James Webb Space Telescope have begun the process of aligning the observatory's mirrors, which were stowed for launch. The preliminary adjustments will take about 10 days, according to a mission timeline, although NASA expects to spend about three months to completely align the panels into a working telescope. Read more>\n\nOnto Webb's mirror segments\n\nAccording to a NASA timeline, the team behind the James Webb Space Telescope will likely begin moving the 18 individual segments of the observatory's hexagonal golden mirror out of their launch configurations on Wednesday (Jan. 12).\n\nThis process is slow and finicky, and is expected to take about 10 days. Each of the 18 primary mirror segments is held in place by seven different actuators that can adjust their position and curvature super precisely. But even once this process is complete, the observatory team will need to spend about three more months getting the honeycomb of mirrors to work together to produce one sharp image.\n\nWebb has been in space for 18 days now and is more than 82% of the way to its final destination. The observatory will orbit a point called the Earth-sun Lagrange point 2, or L2, which is located nearly 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) away from Earth on the side opposite the sun. The observatory has covered more than 740,000 miles (1.2 million km) and has 160,000 miles (250,000 km) more to go.\n\nYou can track the telescope's location, temperature and deployment via NASA.\n\nWebb keeps trekking out to space\n\nNASA has again delayed beginning work on aligning the individual mirror segments of the James Webb Space Telescope, according to an agency timeline, with that project now scheduled to begin Wednesday (Jan. 12). The process will take several days and moves the 18 individual hexagons of the golden primary mirror out of their launch configuration.\n\nIn the meantime, Webb continues its long journey out to Earth-sun Lagrange point 2, or L2. The observatory is currently 80% of the way to L2 and has traveled nearly 725,000 miles (1.16 million kilometers) away from Earth. To follow Webb's journey, consult NASA's tracking website for the observatory, which also tracks the deployment process.\n\nWebb work continues\n\nAdjustments to the 18 golden mirror segments of Webb's primary mirror are due to begin tomorrow, Jan. 11, according to the deployment timeline provided by NASA. That process is expected to take several days and marks the observatory's transition from deployment into commissioning.\n\nMeanwhile, the observatory continues its trek out to its station orbiting Earth-sun Lagrange point 2, or L2, which is located about 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) away from Earth on the side opposite the sun. As of today (Jan. 10), the telescope is more than 78% of the way to orbit, having traveled more than 700,000 miles (1.1 million km) from Earth, according to NASA's observatory tracker.\n\nMirror alignment to begin for Webb Space Telescope\n\nWith the James Webb Space Telescope now fully deployed, work is expected to begin today to start aligning the 18 individual mirrors that make up the observatory's primary mirror. It is not a fast process.\n\nFull story: The James Webb Space Telescope is fully deployed. So what's next?\n\n\"This operation is a multi-day multi-step activity to activate and move each of its 18 primary mirror segments (which are adjustable) out of their launch configuration, NASA wrote in a deployment guide. \"The primary mirror segments and secondary mirror are moved by six actuators that are attached to the back of each mirror piece. The primary mirror segments also have an additional actuator at its center that adjusts its curvature. The telescope's tertiary mirror remains stationary.\"\n\nThe primary mirror is Webb's main light collection surface. It will reflect light to the tertiary mirror located on booms in front of the telescope, which then bounces the light into Webb's instruments.\n\nEach of the 18 segments of the primary mirror is plated in a shiny, but ultra thin, layer of gold. If left in launch position, they would act as individual telescopes with images that would be fuzzy and unclear. Once aligned, the mirror segments will act as one giant mirror 21.3 feet (6.5 meters) across, the largest ever in space.\n\nNASA has estimated that it could take up to 120 days after launch for Webb's mirror alignment work to be complete. The first photos from Webb are not expected until about five months after launch once commissioning ends. -- Tariq Malik\n\nHere's a look at how Webb's focusing works:\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope deployment success\n\nAn elated mission team for NASA's James Webb Space Telescope confirmed that the space observatory is in great shape after a deployment phase that was 100% successful.\n\n\"It is a fully deployed telescope ready to perform fantastic science to expand our knowledge,\" said John Durning, Webb Deputy Project Manager of NASA Goddard.\n\nUp next for the Webb team is a five-month commissioning phase to calibrate the telescope's optics and adjust its mirrors. Webb is currently making its way to its final observing site nearly 1 million miles (1.6 km) from Earth and is due to arrive around Jan. 23.\n\nTo enter orbit around its Lagrange 2 point, Webb will have to perform a short maneuver, but it is expected to go well.\n\nYou can read our wrap story on today's Webb mirror deployment success here. -- Tariq Malik\n\nNASA Webb Space Telescope press conference underway\n\nNASA's post-deployment press conference is underway now and you can watch it live in the video window at the top of this page.\n\nNASA is holding two panels, one on the deployment's success and the other on what's next for the Webb Space Telescope.\n\nHere's a rundown of the speakers for the briefing:\n\nPanel on Webb Space Telescope deployment success\n\nBill Ochs, Webb Project Manager, NASA Goddard\n\nMike Menzel, Mission Systems Engineer, NASA Goddard\n\nScott Willoughby, Vice President and Program Manager, Webb, Northrop Grumman\n\nVince Heeg, Deputy Program Manager, Northrop Grumman\n\nPanel on what's next for James Webb Space Telescope\n\nJohn Durning, Webb Deputy Project Manager, NASA Goddard\n\nLee Feinberg, Webb Optical Telescope Element Manager, NASA Goddard\n\nJane Rigby, Webb Operations Project Scientist, NASA Goddard\n\nHeidi Hammel, Vice President for Science, Space Telescope Science Institute\n\nSuccess! Webb Space Telescope primary mirror latched\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope mission engineers confirmed that the observatory's starboard primary mirror wing successfully latched into place at 1:17 p.m. EST (1817 GMT), marking an end to a two-week process that was NASA's most-complicated deployment in space telescope history.\n\nCheers erupted at Webb's mission operations center at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, as the mission team now prepares for an arduous three-month process to align and calibrate the $10 billion space telescope.\n\n\"Today, NASA achieved another engineering milestone decades in the making!\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said on Twitter. \"While the journey is not complete, I join the Webb team in breathing a little easier and imagining the future breakthroughs bound to inspire the world.\"\n\nNASA will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. EST (1930 GMT) for today's successful deployment. You'll be able to watch that live here at start time.\n\nLatching underway for Webb telescope mirror\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope engineers have passed the halfway mark in latching the observatory's starboard mirror wing in place.\n\nThe latching process began shortly after 10:30 a.m. EST (1530 GMT) and was expected to take around two hours to complete.\n\nWebb Space Telescope mirror fully deployed!\n\nIt's official, the primary mirror of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is completely deployed, the final step of its unprecedented two-week deployment phase that began with a Dec. 25 launch.\n\n\"I just feel this kind of glow in my chest right now just seeing that mirror deployed all together,\" NASA scientist Michelle Thaller said in a live webcast as the Webb mission team applauded and shared high-fives.\n\nWebb space telescope starboard mirror in motion\n\nThe Webb Space Telescope's mission operations team has commanded Webb to deploy its starboard mirror wing.\n\nIt should take 4 to 5 minutes for the mirror segment to swing into place, after which it will take a few hours to latch into place.\n\nLaunch locks released from Webb mirror\n\nThe four launch locks securing the Webb Space Telescope's starboard mirror wing in place have successfully been unlocked, freeing the mirror segment for its final move.\n\nA series of motors successfully worked to unlock the launch locks. They were the final critical movies of 178 mechanism firings that were vital to go smoothly for Webb's deployment over the last two weeks, NASA says. Those actions were non-redundant, if one failed it would have doomed the Webb Space Telescope.\n\n\"178 out of 178, congratulations,\" Webb's Mission Operations Manager just said.\n\nThe mirror segment is expected to begin slowly moving soon, with major movement to begin in about 20 minutes. Once in place, it will take about two hours to latch it securely in place. -- Tariq Malik\n\nFinal mirror unfolding begins for Webb Space Telescope\n\nNASA has begun unfolding the final mirror wing for the James Webb Space Telescope. You can watch it in the live video feed at the top of this page.\n\nTelescope controllers are working to send commands that will remove the launch locks on Webb's starboard mirror wing. Today's mirror unfolding will swing three final mirror segments into place to complete the 18-segment primary mirror deployment, the final step for Webb's two-week deployment phase.\n\nHere's a closer look at the primary mirror of James Webb Space Telescope\n\nWebb Space Telescope final deployment underway\n\nNASA's James Webb Space Telescope mirror deployment webcast is underway.

NASA received confirmation of the successful deployment at approximately 2:11 p.m. EST (1911 GMT), agency officials wrote in a blog post.\n\nFull story: James Webb Space Telescope has unfolded 1st wing of massive golden mirror\n\nWebb's main mirror deployment has begun!\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has begun unfolding the left side panel of its golden primary mirror, according to a NASA statement published just before 9:30 a.m. EST (1430 GMT). The panel holds three of the hexagonal mirror segments the observatory uses to catch light.\n\nDuring the deployment, team members will unlatch the wing from its stored position, then motors will unfold the panel in a process expected to take about five minutes. Then, the team will spend about two hours latching the panel into place, according to the statement.\n\nThe team is expected to repeat the process tomorrow (Jan. 8) on the right side of the observatory, which will mark the last major unfolding from the spacecraft's launch position. That event will be livestreamed beginning around 9 a.m. EST (1400 GMT), NASA has stated.\n\nWebb main mirror deployment begins today\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope will begin its final major unfolding events today with the first of two primary mirror deployments.\n\nToday, Webb is expected to unfold and secure its port primary mirror wing, which contains three of the space telescope's 18 hexagon-shaped mirror segments.\n\n\"Webb's final series of major deployments is planned to start tomorrow, Jan. 7, with the rotation into position of the first of two primary mirror wings,\" NASA wrote in an update on Jan. 6. \"The second primary mirror wing – Webb’s final major spacecraft deployment – is planned for Saturday, Jan. 8.\"\n\nWebb's two primary mirror wings, port and starboard, each have three mirror segments. They were folded back behind the central mirror face during launch in order to fit inside the payload fairing of Webb's Ariane 5 rocket.\n\nIn other Webb news, the European Space Agency released a stunning HD video of the James Webb Space Telescope captured just after it separated from its Ariane 5 rocket. You can watch that video of Webb here. It is the last view of the space telescope we'll ever see.\n\nWhy is it the last view? The James Webb Space Telescope doesn't have onboard cameras.\n\nThis is an update to note that NASA's webcast of the James Webb Space Telescope's mirror deployment will actually occur on Saturday, Jan. 8, at a time still to be determined based on NASA's latest live broadcast schedule.\n\nWebb's flight controllers plan to deploy the the telescope's aft radiator as soon as today before proceeding with the port and starboard mirror deployments on Friday and Saturday. Sorry for any confusion, space fans! -- Tariq Malik\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope to deploy port mirror wing\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is expected to begin unfolding its primary mirror today, Jan. 6, starting with the port side.\n\nIn what could be a two-day process, Webb will unfold first the port side and then the starboard side wings of its 18-segment primary mirror, which is made up of shiny gold hexagons. There are three mirror segments on each wing.\n\nEach of the wings were folded for launch in order to fit inside the payload fairing of Webb's Ariane 5 rocket.\n\nWhile the mirror unfolding process is scheduled to take two days, it could occur faster.
