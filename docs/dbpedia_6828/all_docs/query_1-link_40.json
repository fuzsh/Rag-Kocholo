        "text": "\"I never got to hear Berlin or Gershwin perform in a club, however, I will be able to say I saw Jimmy Webb sitting at a Steinway. . . performing his songs. Words and Music that are embedded in the musical soul of our country, and will be played for generations to come.\n\n...To hear the composer sing and play his songs is always something special, and to hear the songs of Jimmy Webb performed by Jimmy Webb is a momentous experience. I hope it’s not too over the top to say, but for the non-music lovers out there, I can only compare it to hearing Thomas Jefferson reading the Declaration of Independence...\"\n\n– Stephen Sorokoff - The Times Square Chronicles\n\nBILLBOARD'S TOP 10 SONGS WRITTEN BY JIMMY WEBB\n\n​\n\n01.
