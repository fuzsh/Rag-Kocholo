        "text": "WASHINGTON  Senator Jim Webb, Democrat of Virginia, has decided not to run for re-election, avoiding a blockbuster rematch with the man he beat in 2006, George Allen, and giving Senate Republicans another opportunity to try to reclaim the majority.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Webb said he had “decided to return to the private sector, where I have spent most of my professional life, and will not seek re-election in 2012.”\n\nThe announcement is a disappointment to Democrats and a blow to President Obama and Tim Kaine, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, who had urged Mr. Webb to run for a second term.\n\nThere had been rumblings for weeks that Mr. Webb, a former Navy secretary who was once a Republican, would not continue in the Senate. But he and his staff had remained tight-lipped.\n\nMr. Allen now faces a challenge from a Tea Party supporter, Jamie Radtke, for the Republican nomination.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Allen said: “I respect Senator Webb’s service to our country and the very personal decision that he and his family have made. I did not enter into this race to run against any one person, but to fight for the families of Virginia to improve their opportunities in life.”\n\nOn the Democratic side, attention now turns squarely to Mr. Kaine, who served four years as governor and whose popularity would make him a formidable candidate. Mr. Kaine has repeatedly said he would remain as chairman of the Democratic Party, but an appeal by the president and party leaders could change his mind.\n\nMr. Kaine issued a statement Wednesday praising Mr. Webb’s service but avoiding saying anything about his own future.\n\nIf Mr. Kaine does not run, the Virginia Democratic Party will need to find another candidate to challenge Mr. Allen. Brian Moran, the chairman of the state’s Democratic Party, said in an interview that “my life just got a little bit more complicated.”\n\nAmong the possible challengers who have been mentioned is Tom Perriello, who spent two years as a member of Congress from Southern Virginia but lost his re-election bid last year. Also, some have suggested that Terry McAuliffe, who lost a bid to be the Democratic nominee for governor in 2009, could run for Senate, though he is believed to want to try again for the state’s chief executive job."
