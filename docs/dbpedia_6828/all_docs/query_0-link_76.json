        "text": "Webb is an international collaboration between NASA, ESA (the European Space Agency), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is managing the development effort. The main industrial partner is Northrop Grumman; the Space Telescope Science Institute will operate Webb after launch.\n\nSeveral innovative technologies have been developed for Webb. These include a primary mirror made of 18 separate segments that unfold and adjust to shape after launch. The mirrors are made of ultra-lightweight beryllium. Webb's biggest feature is a tennis court sized five-layer sunshield that attenuates heat from the Sun more than a million times. The telescopeâ€™s four instruments - cameras and spectrometers - have detectors that are able to record extremely faint signals. One instrument (NIRSpec) has programmable microshutters, which enable observation of up to 100 objects simultaneously. Webb also has a cryocooler for cooling the mid-infrared detectors of another instrument (MIRI) to a very cold 7 kelvins (minus 447 Fahrenheit) so they can work.\n\nMarcia Rieke, a UArizona Regents Professor of Astronomy, is principal investigator for the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam), which sits at the heart of the Webb Telescope. She led the development of the instrument, which was conceived to carry out the telescope's original purpose: to discover what astronomers refer to as \"first light\" galaxies at the moment of their formation in the very early universe. George Rieke, also a Regents Professor of Astronomy, is science team lead for the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) built by a consortium of European scientists and engineers and NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab. MIRI was added to Webb to expand the telescope's reach even farther into the infrared spectrum and enable many additional investigations."
