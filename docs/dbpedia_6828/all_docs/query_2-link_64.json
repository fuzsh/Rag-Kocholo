        "text": "Dr. Webb is a world-renowned astrophysicist specializing in the variability of Blazars across the Electro-magnetic spectrum. He has hosted international conferences, edited conference proceedings, guest edited publications on Blazar variability, and published a graduate-level textbook on Extra-Galactic Astrophysics. He specializes in optical observations using large telescopes located around the world and also NASA satellite telescopes in the Gamma-ray, UV and IR region of the spectrum.\n\nIn addition to these scientific pursuits, Dr. Webb popularizes science, hosting a public lecture series at FIU for 26 years, giving hundreds of public lectures on topics ranging from SETI to gravitational waves. He has given guest lectures across the country and wrote a suite of astronomy songs which he recorded in a professional studio. The resulting CD entitled \"Reaching for The Stars\" contains his original astronomy songs and he also performs them live at special planetarium concerts around the country."
