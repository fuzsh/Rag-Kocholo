        "text": "How To Calculate The Cost Of ICF Foundations In Southern Ontario\n\nThe concept of estimating the cost of construction is as much art as it is math. This conclusion is particularly the case of choices related to the custom home building.\n\nOne person may determine value by lowest cost or highest quality while another makes a decision purely on intangibles (i.e., comfort, “peace of mind,” design, etc.).\n\nRegardless of the method to determine value, a homeowner should make informed decisions about foundation construction options.\n\nWhy ICF foundation?\n\nNinety percent of all basements in Canada are built using some form of a concrete wall system. The most favourite three are:\n\nconcrete blocks\n\npoured concrete walls and\n\ninsulated concrete forms.\n\nInsulated Concrete Forms (ICFs) are polystyrene forms that stack like “Lego” blocks with steel rebar inside. These blocks are assembled on top of each other, and concrete is poured into the hollow core of the block to create walls.\n\nBuilding with insulated concrete forms results in durable, fire-resistant, wind-proof, super-insulated, energy-efficient, seismically superior, environmentally-friendly basements.\n\nWhy build a foundation with ICFs?\n\nYour basement will feel cool in the summer and warm in the winter.\n\nYou will have the space available for expanding without the cost of adding more structure.\n\nYour outside basement walls will be ready for drywall. No framing, insulation or vapor barrier needed to finish the wall.\n\nOne trade does it all. No bricklayers, waterproofers, farmers or insulation companies.\n\nIt can be done under adverse weather conditions. Concrete can be poured below freezing temperatures as it cures between two pieces of insulation and does not freeze.\n\nMuch faster time of construction. In most of the cases analyzed, ICF saved over 50% of the time needed to achieve the same result.\n\nWhat does the typical ICF foundation cost?\n\nThe average 2500 sq. ft. home has approximately 230 linear feet of wall. If the wall is 8′ tall, you end up with 1840 gross sq. ft. of the ICF wall.\n\nIn this example, we’ll figure the area without windows and doors as the material and labour for installing and supplying the “bucks” is a trade-off for formed ICF wall area.\n\nThose numbers work well on the paper. However, ICF foundation cost also depends on the degree of difficulty of construction.\n\nIf the job has a lot of corners, or radius walls like most custom homes do, it slows the labor rate down; it will cost more per square foot to build.\n\nThe following is the list of other factors that determine the cost of your project:\n\nThe concrete factor – how wide of a block will you use? What are the concrete prices like in your area?\n\nWhich block will you use? Price varies according to the manufacturer and the distance for delivery.\n\nSome ICF installers will charge more if the client wants to use a particular block because it is harder to work with.\n\nHow accessible is your building site? Is there a place to store a large volume of blocks?\n\nWho is going to engineer your project and are they familiar with ICFs? The cost of a project can increase drastically because of the extra rebar or other stuff engineers build in due to ignorance, and which the project does not need.\n\nYou should be able to speak with an installer in your area, give them an idea of your project and get a ballpark from them.\n\nWhen it comes to ICF, you are paying for the expertise due to the concrete.\n\nICF is not a DIY job while some claim it is, one cannot compare it to wood framing a home.\n\nIt’s a night and day difference. 90% of the horror stories out there from ICF are due to inexperienced people thinking they can DIY.\n\nIn Germany, one has to go through two years of on the job training with concrete before they can even pour jobs on their own.\n\nMany times we hear that ICF is “not more expensive, just different.”\n\nWhether ICF is more expensive than the poured concrete foundation is not something that can be said in blanket terms for all areas and every project.\n\nPricing of labor and materials, as well as building methods, vary widely. Every homeowner should be aware of the variables that affect their market areas to discuss the ICF option with confidence.\n\nThe lowest price doesn’t always get the nod, many times, the educated buyer is sold by the knowledge of the salesperson."
