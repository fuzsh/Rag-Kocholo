        "text": "Footings are the concrete support platform at the bottom of your piers or basement walls. There are a few different types of footing: pad footings (t-shaped), stepped footings, and sloped footings. Piers are the concrete columns or piles that rest on top of the footings, usually connected using steel rebar.\n\nIf you need foundation repair in the Chicagoland area, call The Real Seal.
