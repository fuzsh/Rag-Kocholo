To view, click here.\n\nOPWDD Front Door Information Session Videos Now Available\n\nThe Office for People With Developmental Disabilities is pleased to announce that new Front Door Information Session videos are now available for viewing on the OPWDD website.\n\nThe Front Door Information Session outlines the process of how a person can become eligible for OPWDD supports and services, the types of supports and services available and where they can get assistance. These short videos provide easy-to-understand information about OPWDD services and how to get started receiving services. The videos are separated into segments that provide an overview of important steps in the process and will replace the practice of requiring Front Door Information Sessions in person or online:\n\nGetting Started with OPWDD\n\nThe Front Door Process\n\nEligibility\n\nServices\n\nOPWDD Residential and Housing Supports\n\nOPWDD Employment Services\n\nSelf-Direction\n\nOPWDD Care Management\n\nAssessment\n\nFunding\n\nView The Arc Ontario’s 2022-2024 Strategy & Action Plan\n\nWe are excited to share with you our 2022-2024 Strategy & Action Plan, which outlines ways The Arc Ontario plans to evolve in all areas including finances, workforce, leadership, structure, and infrastructure so that we may continue to flourish and prosper in the years ahead.\n\nThe Arc Ontario is Now Offering Adult ADOS Testing to Assist in Diagnosing Autism\n\nThe Arc Ontario’s Senior Behavior Specialist, Ashley Hanvey has received certification to administer ADOS (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule). This has allowed the agency to begin offering testing while serving as an additional resource for the community in assessing and diagnosing autism and related diagnoses.\n\nThe Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule is a standardized assessment of communication, social interaction, play, and restricted and repetitive behaviors in children. During an ADOS assessment, a specialist interacts directly with the child in play and social activities. If you would like more information about ADOS testing, or if you would like to schedule an appointment, please contact JoEllen Schaefer, Family Support and Intake Coordinator at jschaefer@thearcontario.org or (585) 919-2118.\n\nNY HERO Act: The Arc Ontario’s Safety Plan\n\nOn September 6, 2021, Governor Kathy Hochul announced the designation of COVID-19 as an airborne infectious disease under the HERO Act. This designation requires all employers to implement workplace safety plans. The New York Health and Essential Rights Act (NY HERO Act) was signed into law on May 5, 2021, and mandates extensive new workplace health and safety protections in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of the NY HERO Act is to protect employees against exposure and disease during a future airborne infectious disease outbreak.\n\nIn response to this designation, The Arc Ontario has developed a new safety plan to protect the individuals we support as well as our staff members.
