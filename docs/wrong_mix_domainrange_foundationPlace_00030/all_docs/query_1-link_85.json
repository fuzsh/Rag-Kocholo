        "text": "HOW-TO VIDEOS\n\nA great way to view and understand your building or repair project before you get started. Find out just about everything you need to know by watching the video below.\n\nBuilding a Block Wall\n\nBuilding a concrete block wall is one of the more involved building projects that requires careful planning and a little heavy lifting, but easy to accomplish with QUIKRETE Mason Mix.\n\nProject Instructions\n\nWhen working with cement-based products, always wear eye protection and waterproof gloves.\n\nStep 1\n\nEnsure a solid footing. Footings should be a minimum of twice the width of the concrete block Â (i.e., a typical 8x8x16 block would require a 16-inch wide footing) and extend below the frost line.\n\nNOTE: it is important to check local building codes for construction requirements in your area.Â Â\n\nFor load-bearing walls, tie rods should be set a minimum of 6 inches into the concrete footing before it is set.Â Rebar should be placed in every other masonry core to provide structural support.Â\n\nFor masonry cores over 4 inches wide, QUIKRETE Core Fill Grout â Coarse should be poured around the rebar; for masonry cores under 4 inches wide, QUIKRETE Core Fill Grout-Fine should be used.\n\nStep 2\n\nLay out the block, making sure to leave a 3/8 inch gap between the blocks to allow for the vertical mortar joints (i.e., a typical 8x8x16 block is actually 15-5/8 inches long and 7-5/8 inches high to accommodate the mortar joint).\n\nStep 3\n\nSnap a chalk line on each side of the block wall as a reference line.\n\nStep 4\n\nMix Mortar.\n\nTIP: when preparing to place a trowel full of mortar, gently âsnapâ the trowel downward to remove any excess mortar. The proper consistency is achieved when the wet mortar will âhangâ on a trowel held at a 90° Â angle.\n\nStep 5\n\nDampen the footing surface with water and place a one-inch bed of mortar on the footing. Furrow the mortar bed using the tip of the trowel to create a âvâ to help distribute the mortar evenly.Â The mortar should be workable but firm enough to support the weight of the block.\n\nStep 6\n\nButter the inside end of the first block and then press the block into the mortar bed to create a 3/8 inch mortar joint.\n\nStep 7\n\nTrim and remove any excess mortar.\n\nStep 8\n\nUsing the same process, set the opposite corner block.\n\nStep 9\n\nRepeat steps 6 and 7, adjusting the blocksÂ to be flush and level; continue this process until the first course is completed.\n\nStep 10\n\nTo set the next course of block, apply a one-inch thick mortar bed along top of the first course.\n\nStep 11\n\nAt the end of the wall, set an â8x8x8â half block into the mortar bed with the smooth side facing out.Â\n\nStep 12\n\nUsing a masonâs line as a guide for the remaining block, continue building the wall until it is complete.\n\nStep 13\n\nOnce the mortar joints have become âthumbprintâ hard, use a jointing tool to smooth the fresh joints and remove any excess mortar.\n\nShopping List\n\n80 lb QUIKRETE Mason Mix â Type S\n\n8x8x16 standard block\n\n8x8x8 standard block\n\nMasonry brick trowel\n\nMasonâs line\n\nLine chalk\n\nMasonry line blocks (2)\n\nStiff brush\n\nJointing tool\n\n4â level\n\nPlastic mixing tub or wheel barrow\n\nMixing hoe\n\nMeasuring tape\n\nGloves\n\nSafety glasses\n\n(For Structural walls)\n\n#3 rebar\n\n80 lb QUIKRETE Core fill grout or\n\n80 lb QUIKRETE 5000 Concrete Mix\n\n(Footing Construction)"
