        "text": "After I sold the management company, I decided to make a decision and move the buildings over to Beach Front. I’ve known Kyle and Robert [members of the leadership team] for a long time. They’re good guys. I’ve known them through school with the kids and sports and just being friendly competitors. They’ve always been right as rain. If they say it’ll be done, it’ll be done. Or if they promise something, I’ve just always known them to be really good guys.\n\nI chose Beach Front Property Management Inc. as a property management company because I like the fact that I can pick up a phone because I am hands-on. So, I like the interaction with Beach Front Property Management Inc., and I don’t feel like I have to be as worried about what’s going on at the building, or who’s involved. I like their chain of command; it makes me feel more comfortable. Plus, when I talk to the investors and I tell them how it’s all going, and I go to the building and see for myself, I like what’s going on, which makes everybody feel more comfortable. So, I just like their procedures. I like their process, and I think they have a lot of competent people there.\n\nI think all the departments are very strong. Accounting department with institutional level accounting reports, operations department with excellent oversight and many experienced people. This is a business that takes many, many years to learn. It’s not something you can just walk into a class. Lots of it is experience based likewise on the maintenance department, which is great for handling all sorts of jobs that would otherwise cost a lot more with vendors. So, at the end of the day, it’s a well-oiled machine.\n\nBeach Front has been managing my properties for 6+ years and I couldn’t be happier. I inherited the properties and didn’t know the first thing about managing them (and definitely didn’t have the time to!).\n\nGetting Beach Front to start service was easy and everyone there is so knowledgeable (and so patient with my million questions!) that I felt very comfortable right from the start. My properties are in great hands!\n\nI own several investment properties in Southern California and appreciate how well Beach Front manages everything from A to Z. The fact that I can be so hands-off with the day to day allows me to focus my energy and time on better things, like running my company and spending time with my kids.\n\nI invest in a multitude of industries so being able to watch my ROI increase every year is what’s important.\n\nFirst thing’s first: they implemented RUBS. What a game-changer. Secondly, they are always available to take a call. Not typical of a property management company.\n\nTrust me, I’ve worked with many. And lastly, they manage everything in-house from service and repairs to repositioning to getting the units rented. My efforts are minimal and I have Beach Front to thank for that.\n\nBeach Front made the transition from my former property management company very smooth. I own three apartment buildings in Long Beach that were being managed poorly and no one was communicating with the tenants…so they called me non-stop.\n\nWhen I finally made the change, Beach Front took over with a quick onboarding and all my headaches went away. Only regret I have is not switching over sooner.\n\nTo be honest when I first entered your office I felt this vibe of neat and tidy and modern, especially when you explained how your team and system work. I knew already you are the professional who we want to work with. I really need my partner to come to see your office and meet you. I’m sure that he’d like to work with you. You have such a strong influence on people.\n\nA property management company typically charges a percentage of the monthly rent as a management fee, which can range from 8-12% of the monthly rent. In addition, some companies may also charge additional fees for services such as leasing or advertising, and some companies may charge a flat fee for their services. The fee can vary depending on the company, location, and services provided.\n\nSwitching property management companies can be done by reviewing your current contract, researching new companies, and signing a new contract with the chosen company. Notify your current company and tenants of the change, and schedule a walk-through with the new property management company. Keep an eye on the transition process and address any issues that may arise during it."
