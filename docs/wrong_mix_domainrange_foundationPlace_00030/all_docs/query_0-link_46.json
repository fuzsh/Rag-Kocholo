Take a photo of the entire storefront.\n\nTake a look at your storefront and envision the placement of the ramp.\n\nYou will want to place your ramp in an area where there is enough space for a person using a mobility device to make a turn to get on and off the ramp. You will need 42″ of space in addition to the length of the ramp (which is 6 times the height of the step) to provide a turning space that works for many mobility aids, though not all.\n\nTake a picture of the entire storefront including the step and the sidewalk.\n\n2. Take two photos of your step height measurement using a standard imperial tape measure placed up against the step to show the measurement. The two photos should be taken 34″ apart.\n\nOne on the left side. The other on the right.\n\nTake these photos with the camera aimed straight-on and at level with the step to make sure we are able to get clear and accurate measurements. Please include a small sign in the photo noting the side the measurement is being taken on.\n\nOnce you have your measurements and photos, please fill out the form below, and select your location type."
