        "text": "Shapes Lab\n\nForces Lab | Materials Lab | Loads Lab | Shapes Lab\n\nAbout This Lab\n\nThese labs simplify the real-life conditions that affect structures (shapes), in order to illustrate key concepts. In the real world, many variables affect the strength and stability of any give shape. The choice of materials, joints, load distribution, and size and thickness of a structure all affect its ability to resist loads. For example, a triangle made of paper would collapse much sooner than an arch made of steel -- an effect that was not demonstrated in this lab.\n\nThe shape comparisons in this lab depend upon the following conditions: each shape is of equivalent thickness, the joints are hinged, and the live load is applied downward to the structure at a single point at its top and center.\n\nIntro/Instructions\n\nThe shape of a structure affects how strong it is. Rectangles, arches, and triangles are the most common shapes used to build big structures.\n\nOne Elephant on Rectangle\n\nThe weight pushes down on the rectangle and causes the top side to bend.\n\nOne Elephant on Arch\n\nThe weight presses down on the arch and is spread outward along the curve to the ground below.\n\nOne Elephant on Triangle\n\nThe weight causes the top two sides to squeeze together and the bottom side to pull apart.\n\nThree Elephant on Rectangle\n\nThe weight caused the top side to bend too much, so it failed!\n\nThree Elephant on Arch\n\nThe arch likes to be pushed and squeezed. The weight pushes this arch into a stable, tightly squeezed shape.\n\nThree Elephant on Triangle\n\nUnlike the rectangle, the sides of the triangle did not bend under the tremendous weight. This is why the triangle is still standing.\n\nSix Elephant on Rectangle\n\nThe weight caused the top side to bend too much, so it failed!\n\nSix Elephant on Arch\n\nThe arch likes to be pushed and squeezed, but not this much! When an arch is pushed too hard, the sides spread apart and collapse.\n\nSix Elephant on Triangle\n\nThe triangle is still standing because the pulling force in the bottom side is balancing the pushing forces in the upper sides.\n\nNine Elephant on Rectangle\n\nThe weight caused the top side to bend too much, so it failed!\n\nNine Elephant on Arch\n\nThe arch likes to be pushed and squeezed, but not this much! When an arch is pushed too hard, the sides spread apart and collapse.\n\nNine Elephant on Triangle\n\nEven triangles have their limits! All this weight made the third side stretch so much that it snapped in half.\n\nPush Rectangle\n\nWhat happens when you push the side of a rectangle?\n\nThe rectangle is a wobbly, unstable shape. When you push the side, it flops into a slanted parallelogram. This happens without any of the rectangle's sides changing length.\n\nPush Braced Rectangle\n\nNow when you push the side, the diagonal brace gets squeezed, preventing the rectangle from flopping over.\n\nPush Arch\n\nWhat happens when you push down on an arch that is not supported on both sides?\n\nThe force of the finger pushes the sides of the arch outward.\n\nPush Braced Arch\n\nAs the arch tries to spread outward, external supports, called buttresses, push back on the sides of the arch and prevent it from spreading apart.\n\nPush Triangle\n\nWhat happens when you push the side of a triangle?\n\nThe outer edge squeezes together, and the inner edge pulls apart. When one side experiences these two forces at the same time, it bends. The weakest part of the triangle is its side!\n\nPush Braced Triangle\n\nWhen you poke the top of the triangle, the two sides squeeze together and the bottom side pulls apart. The triangle doesn't bend because each side experiences only one force at a time. When used properly, triangles are the most stable and rigid shapes used in construction today.\n\nFlash version of this lab"
