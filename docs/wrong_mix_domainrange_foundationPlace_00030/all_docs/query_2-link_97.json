        "text": "Image\n\nWe Are\n\nHousing\n\nUniversity Housing has something for everyone! First-year students enjoy living in suites and rooms in traditional and renovated residence halls throughout campus. Upper-class students can select from traditional and renovated residence halls, suites, single-occupancy rooms, and apartments. Graduate students and students with families will find White Course Apartments a convenient option.\n\nUndergraduate Housing\n\nButton\n\nGraduate & Family Housing\n\nButton\n\nParents & Families\n\nButton\n\nHousing Areas\n\nImage\n\nEast Halls\n\nEast Housing Area is the largest residence hall complex on campus, housing approximately one-half the first-year student population in 16 coed renovated residence halls that offer double rooms and individual, private-use bathrooms.\n\nImage\n\nEastview Terrace\n\nEastview Terrace houses upperclass students in seven residence halls. Each student has a single room with a private bath. A study/social space and laundry facility is located in each hall.\n\nImage\n\nNittany Apartments & Suites\n\nNittany Apartments features four-person apartments for upperclass or undergraduate students. Students can preference either a two- and four-bedroom garden apartment or a four-bedroom townhouse apartment. Each apartment features a living room and kitchen.\n\nNittany Hall is a suite-style building located in the complex. It offers a four-person suite with two double-occupancy rooms and a shared bathroom.\n\nImage\n\nNorth Halls\n\nNorth Housing Area, an all co-ed housing complex, is home to many first-year students participating in a Living Learning Community. North Housing Area accommodates the majority of students in four-person suites, with a few two-person suites available for upperclass students. First-year students can also live in Robinson Hall, a renovated residence hall that offers more traditional-type housing, with double rooms and individual, private-use bathrooms.\n\nImage\n\nPollock Halls\n\nPollock Housing Area is the second largest residence hall complex, with nine traditional co-ed residence halls. The majority of the halls are reserved exclusively for first-year students, making Pollock the second largest first-year living environment.\n\nImage\n\nSouth Halls\n\nSouth Housing Area is flanked by campus and downtown State College. South Halls offers co-ed residence halls, with the majority of space being reserved exclusively for upperclass students, sorority chapter members, and first-year students who are members of the Schreyer Honors College.\n\nImage\n\nWest Halls\n\nWest Housing Area has a traditional collegiate feel - the brick buildings open onto a quad with symmetrical walkways and arches that lead to the heart of campus. First-year and upperclass students are assigned to the six co-ed traditional residence halls.\n\nImage\n\nWhite Course Undergraduate Apartments\n\nWhite Course Apartments are located on the west-end of campus and provides a convenient and comfortable apartment complex for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as students with families.\n\nBrowse & Compare Your Housing Options!\n\nGet Connected\n\nAnchor Destination\n\nHousing FAQs\n\nAudience\n\nSearch FAQs\n\nContracts\n\nGeneral\n\nCan an on-campus contract/lease be cancelled?\n\nIncoming First-Year Students\n\nFirst-year students are required to reside on campus at University Park as part of the offer of admissions to Penn State. This includes students admitted for the spring semester or students who have deferred enrollment to a later semester. A student may submit a residency exemption request if they are 21 years or older, the student is married and the spouse will be living with them at the University, the student has performed active-duty military service, or has graduated from a Centre County High School and will be living with their parent/guarding in a permanent residence. To claim this exemption, please submit a completed Housing Exemption form (pdf file) to the Housing Assignment Office.\n\nUpper-Class Undergraduate Students\n\nOnce the Housing and Food Service (HFS) Contract is accepted, it cannot be cancelled.\n\nGraduate Students / Students with Families\n\nOnce a White Course Apartment Lease is accepted, it cannot be cancelled.\n\nCan I change my housing or roommate preferences after the deadline?\n\nStudents have the ability to update preferences for housing area, room type, roommate requests, and Living Learning Communities (LLCs). This must be completed before the advertised deadline:\n\nincoming first-year students: 12:00 p.m. (noon) May 15. The housing preference deadline for incoming first-year students has been extended from May 15 to 12:00 p.m. (noon) Monday, May 20.\n\nupper-class students: Typically beginning of April\n\nOnce the deadline has passed, students will not be able to submit changes or request that the Housing Assignment Office make a change. The Housing Assignment Office extracts student data from the eLiving system to create spreadsheets and reports to begin the process of assigning over 14,000 students. To ensure that students' preferences are considered, room assignments are processed individually. The University must stick to a hard deadline in order to have room assignments completed by the posting time.\n\nRoom Exchange eBoard\n\nSince preferences cannot be updated after the deadline, the Room Exchange eBoard was created to provide students an opportunity to manage their room assignment. Once room assignments are posted in eLiving, the eBoard is available for students to either conduct a direct room switch with another student, or post their room assignment and search for someone to swap spaces with. Learn more about the Room Exchange eBoard.\n\nCan I request a roommate?\n\nThe Housing and Food Service (HFS) Contract is available in eLiving, Contracts > Summary.\n\nIncoming First-Year Students\n\nIncoming first-year students are able to update housing preferences on the HFS Contract until the housing preference modification deadline of 12:00 p.m. (noon) ET May 15. The housing preference deadline for incoming first-year students has been extended from May 15 to 12:00 p.m. (noon) Monday May 20. To request a roommate, enter the roommate's Penn State Access Account (e.g. xyz5000) on the \"Roommate Preferences\" screen. Roommate requests must be mutual. Students who are attending Summer Session will have two HFS Contracts and can list roommate preferences for both HFS Contracts (they can be different students).\n\nCurrent Students/Change of Campus Students\n\nDuring the LiveOn Housing Process: When a student receives a housing invitation, they can add a friend when selecting a housing option. Both students would then receive an HFS Contract offer which must be accepted before the expiration date. Each student can update housing preferences and indicate each other as a roommate preference. Preferences can be modified until 12:00 p.m. (noon) ET April 2, 2024.\n\nAfter the Housing Process: A student who missed the LiveOn Housing Process may still Request Housing to be considered for housing. Once the student receives an HFS Contract offer, the student can update housing preferences and indicate a roommate preference during the acceptance steps. Roommate requests must be mutual and students must have an HFS Contract for the same type of housing option (e.g. double room, traditional residence hall, North Suites, etc.) to be considered for assignment together in a room.\n\nTransfer Students\n\nTransfer students who Request Housing when accepting the offer of admission are able to update housing preferences for the HFS Contract until the housing preference modification deadline of 12:00 p.m. (noon) ET May 15. The housing preference deadline for incoming first-year students has been extended from may 15 to 12:00 p.m. (noon) Monday May 20.To request a roommate, enter the roommate's Penn State Access Account ID (e.g. xyz5000) on the \"Roommate Preferences\" screen.\n\nGraduate Students\n\nGraduate students applying for a single-student White Course Apartment may indicate a roommate preference in the comments section of their lease application by including the student's Penn State Access Account (e.g. xyz5000). After submitting the lease application, it is recommended that both students also email the White Course Apartments Office to indicate the roommate request. Roommate requests must be mutual.\n\nDo current or change of campus students have to pay a housing deposit?\n\nNo, current and change of campus students are not required to pay a housing deposit. The housing deposit fee is only paid by students who accept the offer of admission AND the HFS Contract through the MyPennState system.\n\nDoes Penn State have a roommate matching survey?\n\nPenn State values diversity in its student population and feels strongly that living with others from different backgrounds, cultures, and ethnic groups serves to enhance the college experience. Therefore, Penn State does not utilize a roommate matching survey or ask questions regarding a student’s personal preferences and will randomly match students to reside together.\n\nStudents are able to indicate a roommate preference when updating the housing preferences on the Housing and Food Service (HFS) Contract by entering the other student's Penn State Access Account. Roommate requests must be mutual in order to be assigned together. If a student does not have a roommate request the University will randomly assign another student.\n\nDuring the LiveOn Housing Process, when do I have to accept the HFS Contract?\n\nThe LiveOn Housing Process includes an invitation and HFS Contract offer, which both have the same expiration date, so a student must complete the process of selecting a housing option AND accepting the HFS Contract before the expiration date:\n\nMonday invitations expire at 12:00 p.m.(noon) Thursday\n\nThursday invitations expire at 12:00 p.m.(noon) Monday\n\nIf a student adds a friend to their housing option, their friend will have the SAME expiration date as the student who received the invitation, so don't delay in selecting a housing option and creating the HFS Contract. HFS Contracts cannot be reoffered. Students are encouraged to ensure they allow enough time for both the invited student AND their friend(s) to accept the HFS Contract!\n\nHow are first-year students assigned?\n\nRoom assignments for first-year students are processed in a random order. The date that the student accepts the offer of admission has no bearing on the room assignment process.\n\nFirst-year students are able to update preferences for housing area, roommate, Living Learning Communities (LLCs), and Campus Meal Plan level on the HFS Contract before the preference modification deadline of 12:00 p.m. (noon) May 15. The housing preference deadline for incoming first-year students has been extended from May 15 to 12:00 p.m. (noon) Monday May 20.This information will be referenced when the University processes your room assignment.\n\nRoom assignments based on preferences are not guaranteed - some students will not be assigned to preferences requested due to supply-and-demand.\n\nHow do I change my room and what is the room exchange eBoard?\n\nStudents are able change their room assignment by utilizing the Room Exchange eBoard. When room assignments are posted in July, the Room Exchange eBoard function will be available in eLiving for a period of two or three weeks. This option will be turned off so the Housing Assignment Office and Commons Desk Operations staff can prepare for fall arrival. The eBoard will again open one or two weeks after arrival for students who need to change rooms.\n\nThe Room Exchange eBoard allows students to conduct a direct room switch with another student. The eBoard will also allow students to post their room assignment and indicate what housing area they are looking to move to. Once a student's room is posted, they will have access to view other rooms available and the method for contacting students to switch rooms.\n\nTo access the Room Exchange eBoard, login to eLiving, My Info > Room Exchange eBoard. Students will be informed of the timeline to complete a room change. Some students may not be eligible to use the eBoard, based on their HFS Contract type or accommodation requirement.\n\nHow do I find off-campus housing?\n\nThe Off-Campus Student Support Office is a great resource for students seeking off-campus housing.\n\nHow do I request a specific roommate in the LiveOn Housing Process?\n\nDuring the LiveOn Housing Process, students will receive an invitation to view available housing options.\n\nOnce the student selects a housing option, the student can add friends based upon the space selected. Students who select single-occupancy housing option cannot add a friend; some housing options allow for more than one friend, such as suites or apartments. Different Housing Options allow for different numbers of roommates that can be added: most allow for one roommate; some housing options allow up to 3 roommates (Nittany Apartments, White Course Apartments, triple rooms, and supplemental housing), and others do not allow any roommates (Eastview Terrace, single rooms).\n\nThe friend(s) must be eligible to participate. They must have Requested Housing and not yet accepted an HFS Contract in order to be added to your invitation.\n\nOnce confirming the friend, the system will send all students an HFS Contract offer in eLiving for the housing option selected.\n\nAll students must Accept the HFS Contract in eLiving before the offer expiration date.\n\nOnce the HFS Contract is accepted, students can update preferences to indicate the specific roommate(s). Upperclass students can add or change this preference before the early April deadline to indicate the specific roommate preference.\n\nYou do not need to have a friend/roommate to live on campus. Students who do not have a roommate listed will be randomly assigned with another student.\n\nA friend added to an invitation does NOT have to be the roommate!\n\nHow do I request housing preferences?\n\nHousing preferences are not guaranteed. The University will review indicated preferences when processing a room assignment but may not be able to accommodate every student's requested preferences.\n\nIncoming First-Year Students\n\nIncoming first-year students will accept their offer of admission and the Housing and Food Service (HFS) Contract through MyPennState. The student will receive a confirmation email, sent to the student's email address on file when they applied for admission, within one (1) hour of accepting the offer of admission. The email will provide instructions on how to indicate housing preferences.\n\nLogin to eLiving, Contracts > Update Preferences. Select the appropriate Housing and Food Service (HFS) Contract. The system will provide prompts to enter two choices for housing area and room type; roommate requests, Living Learning Community (LLCs), and Campus Meal Plan level (defaults to level 2).\n\nHousing preferences for both summer session and the fall-spring academic year can be updated until 12:00 p.m.(noon) ET May 15.The housing preference deadline for incoming first-year students has been extended from May 15 to 12:00 p.m. (noon) Monday May 20.\n\nCurrent Students\n\nCurrent students who accept a Housing and Food Service (HFS) Contract for the following academic year will be able to indicate housing preferences on the HFS Contract.\n\nLogin to eLiving, Contracts > Update Preferences. Select the appropriate Housing and Food Service (HFS) Contract. The system will provide prompts to enter two choices for housing area and room type; roommate requests, Living Learning Community (LLCs), and Campus Meal Plan level (defaults to level 2).\n\nHousing preferences can be updated until 12:00 p.m. (noon) ET April 2, 2024.\n\nHow do I sign up to receive text message notifications during the LiveOn Housing Process?\n\nText message notifications can be managed in the student's eLiving Account Settings.\n\nStudents log in to eLiving using their Penn State Access ID and password\n\nMy Info > Account Settings\n\nStudents will select the functions for which they would like to receive a text message notification\n\nHow do I update my cell phone number to receive text message notifications during the LiveOn Housing Process?\n\nThe cell phone number listed in eLiving is pulled from LionPATH for the purpose of text notification.. Students can update their mobile number, visit Penn State's Account Management portal.\n\nI already accepted an HFS Contract, but now I found someone with whom I want to live. How can I live with my friend?\n\nBoth students must have their own HFS Contract. Students will log into eLiving and update their roommate preferences: Contracts > Update Preferences. Select the contract and enter the friend as a roommate preference. Roommate requests must be mutual and entered into eLiving before the April deadline. Students must have the same contract type as their friend (e.g. Double Room, Renovated, etc.)\n\nIf the friend does not have an HFS contract, the friend will need to Request Housing and accept the same type of housing contract. (e.g. Double Room, Traditional Residence Hall) If that space is not available the friend would need to accept any contract offered. Once the contract has been accepted in eLiving, one student would need to add their name to the Waitlist for the same housing option (e.g. Double Room, Traditional; Triple Room, Renovated, etc.). Students must mutually indicate each other as a roommate preference.\n\nI received an HFS Contract because my friend added me as a roommate, but the offer expired before I could accept it. What do I do?\n\nAs indicated on the LiveOn Housing Process page, all HFS Contract offers must be accepted by the expiration date:\n\nMonday invitations expire at 12:00 p.m.(noon) Thursday\n\nThursday invitations expire at 12:00 p.m.(noon) Monday\n\nEven if the HFS Contract offer was not generated in a timely manner and did not provide students time to accept the offer before the expiration date, the University is not able to re-offer that HFS Contract.\n\nOnce a student in this situation receives an invitation through eLiving, they can select a housing option and accept that HFS Contract offer. There is no guaranteed that the housing option originally offered by a friend will still be available. If the housing option is not available, students in this situation can select another housing option. Then one of the two friends would need to use the Housing Options Waitlist for the same hosuing option (e.g. Double Room, Traditional; Triple Room, Renovated, etc.) and update preferences to indicate each other as roommate preferences.\n\nIf I currently live in Nittany Apartments, White Course Apartments, or Eastview Terrace, am I guaranteed to return next year?\n\nNo. The LiveOn Housing Process is designed to randomly offer invitations to students who Requested Housing; priority is not given to current residents in a specific housing option or semester standing. Every student who Requests Housing has an equal chance of receiving an invitation. The availability of a specific housing option is not guaranteed.\n\nIf I include my friend when I create the HFS Contract offer, but they do not accept the Contract offer, will it impact my housing?\n\nNo. Each student’s HFS Contract is independent from each other. Students will still be assigned to the housing option that they selected.\n\nIf I like my summer roommate, can I room with them in the fall?\n\nFirst-year students who live on campus for Summer Session II will be eligible to request an updated roommate request for fall semester. This offer will be available for a limited time period, shortly after Summer Session II starts, and contain a deadline for submitting the request. An email will be sent to students with instructions on how to submit the request. Summer students may not be able to stay in their summer room assignment for fall semester.\n\nStudents who want to request to room together for fall semester must agree to the following conditions:\n\nBoth students must be attending Summer Session II and living on campus.\n\nAny preferences originally indicated on the HFS Contract for fall semester, such as roommate, housing area, room type, will no longer be considered.\n\nYour room assignment will be in any housing area where a vacant space is available.\n\nA student's request may not be honored, especially if there is no more space available to accommodate requests. Students may also utilize the Room Exchange eBoard in eLiving which will be available once fall room assignments are posted.\n\nBoth roommates must submit the request by the deadline, and the request MUST be mutual (both students must request each other). If the request is not mutual, each student will be assigned based on preferences listed on the fall HFS Contract, provided that space is available when the student's account is processed.\n\nIf I no longer want to live on campus, can I transfer my contract to another student?\n\nIncoming First-Year Students\n\nThe offer of admission to Penn State University Park includes the first-year residency requirement. First-year students are required to live on campus and are not able to cancel the Housing and Food Service (HFS) Contract to live off campus, nor are they able to transfer the contract obligation to another student.\n\nCurrent Students\n\nThe Housing and Food Service (HFS) Contract is a legally binding contract. The University is not obligated to release a student from the HFS Contract.\n\nHowever, the University does provide a \"contract transfer of obligation\" option during a limited time frame that is announced by the Housing Assignment Office. This option allows a student to transfer the obligation of the HFS Contract to another eligible student. The student is responsible for locating an eligible student who has not already accepted an HFS Contract. The student agreeing to the contract transfer of obligation will not receive the same type of housing option but will receive a HFS Contract for supplemental housing.\n\nBoth the student who is interested in processing a contract transfer of obligation and the student agreeing to accept this HFS contract will need to send an email from their Penn State account to the Housing Assignment Office within a 24-hr period. The Housing Assignment Office will review the request. If the request is approved, the new student will receive an HFS Contract offer. Once the student accepts the offer, the original student will have their HFS Contract cancelled and will be assessed a $100 administrative fee charged to their LionPATH account.\n\nDetails about the contract transfer of obligation are available in the Terms, Conditions, and Regulations of the HFS Contract.\n\nIn the LiveOn Housing Process, I received an HFS Contract offer from another student, what do I need to do?\n\nIf a student is added as a friend when another student completes their housing selection during the LiveOn Housing Process, the student will receive an HFS Contract offer for that specific housing option.\n\nIf a student is interested in living on campus in that housing option, they will need to accept the HFS Contract offer before the expiration date. To accept the offer, log in to eLiving and select the Shopping Cart icon. The HFS Contract offer will be displayed, and a student must go through the steps to accept the offer. They will agree to the Terms, Conditions, and Regulations and electronically sign the HFS Contract to accept it. Verify that the HFS Contract is in accepted status.\n\nIf a student is not interested in living on campus, simply let the HFS Contract offer expire.\n\nIf a student is interested in living on campus, but not in that type of housing option, simply et the HFS Contract offer expire. Students can then wait to receive their invitation to be able to select from available housing options, then create/accept a HFS Contract offer.\n\nAccepting a HFS Contract offer that was made from a friend does not mean that you must live with this person. All students will Update Preferences on the HFS Contract after it is accepted. Roommate requests must be mutual.\n\nIs the LiveOn Housing Process first-come, first-served?\n\nNo. The LiveOn Housing Process is a random invitation system. The date that students Request Housing will not impact when they are selected to receive an invitation. All students who Request Housing will receive an invitation to select housing.\n\nWhat if I only need housing for one semester?\n\nThe University will cancel a student's Housing and Food Service (HFS) Contract for the semester that the student will be participating in an educational activity, such as study aboard, student teaching, internship, or co-op, or if the student processes a leave of absence, or graduation. The HFS Contract will NOT be cancelled for a student to move into off-campus housing. If a student is approved for an HFS Contract Cancellation, but then their plans change and they re-enroll in classes, the HFS Contract will be reinstated and the student will be responsible for room and board charges.\n\nHousing for Fall Semester Only: The HFS Contract is for the entire academic year (both fall and spring semesters), and students will need to accept the full year HFS Contract. Once the student's LionPATH account is updated to reflect the student's plan (intent-to-graduate is filed, study abroad class scheduled, etc.), the student can Request Contract Cancellation in eLiving. The Housing Assignment Office will confirm the student's plan and then cancel the HFS Contract for the spring semester. No cancellation fee will be charged.\n\nHousing for Spring Semester Only: Students who need housing for just the spring semester will be able to add their name to the spring semester On-Campus Housing Waitlist that is available in eLiving beginning at 12:00 p.m. (noon) ET on October 1. HFS Contract offers are released on Monday afternoons starting late-November/early-December until the beginning of spring semester. All students on the On-Campus Housing Waitlist will be eligible to receive on-campus housing provided they are registered for University Park courses.\n\nWhat is Online Room Selection?\n\nOnline Room Selection (or self-assigning) is an option for current students and select first-year groups to log on to eLiving and choose the specific room in which they'd like to live. This option may not be offered to all groups or at every campus; students who are not able to participate in Online Room Selection enter contract preferences and are assigned by staff.\n\nTimelines for Online Room Selection vary but usually occur in mid-spring for the fall semester. A second selection period may be offered in early summer if additional housing options become available.\n\nStudents who are able to participate in Online Room Selection will receive an email reminder with more detailed instructions before their selection period begins. Selection periods are also found in the Contract Summary in eLiving and posted online.\n\nView Online Room Selection dates for your campus.\n\nInvitations\n\nAm I guaranteed to receive a housing invitation in the LiveOn Housing Process?\n\nYes! Every student who Requests Housing during the LiveOn Housing Process timeline will receive an invitation to view available housing options. However, we are not able to guarantee when the invitation will be made or that your preferred housing option will be available when you receive your invitation.\n\nNeed more information?\n\nCurrent students\n\nChange of Campus students\n\nCan I transfer my invitation to another student during the LiveOn Housing Process?\n\nInvitations cannot be transferred to another student. All students who Request Housing will receive an invitation to view available housing options.\n\nStudents who did not Request Housing or are not eligible to participate in the LiveOn Housing Process can add their name to the On-Campus Housing Waitlist in eLiving to be considered for housing.\n\nHow do I choose a space and accept the HFS Contract?\n\nStudents who Request Housing will receive an invitation in eLiving to view available housing options.\n\nInvitations are sent by email and text message notification (students must opt in to text message notification; through eLiving under Account Settings).\n\nView Invitation in eLiving when it is received.\n\nThe invitation allows students to view all housing options.

Some quads may offer a bathroom in the quad, but not all quads have bathrooms. Quads are located in traditional residence halls in South, West, and Pollock, and are available for both first-year and upperclass students.\n\nA suite is a two-bedroom/four-person space that also offers a small entry way and bathroom that is shared by the roommates in the suite. Suites are offered in North for both first-year and upperclass students, and in Nittany Hall for upperclass students only. North Halls also offers limited two-bedroom/two-person suites for upperclass students only.\n\nThere are different room rates for quads and suites.\n\nWhat is the difference between renovated and traditional residence halls?\n\nA traditional residence hall is typical, collegiate-style 'dorm' building. Students are housed mainly in double-occupancy rooms on either side of the corridor, and there are communal bathrooms located on each floor. The communal bathroom is a large room that offers individual toilet stalls, private shower stalls, and several sinks. Traditional residence halls do not offer air conditioning.\n\nA renovated residence hall is a building that has been upgraded by the University. Students are housed mainly in double-occupancy rooms on either side of the corridor, and there are several individual-use bathrooms located on each floor. The bathroom is a single-user bathroom that offers a shower, toilet, and sink. Some bathrooms are only a toilet and sink. External sinks and mirrors are also available for quick use. Renovated residence halls also offer a community space on the ground floor with a kitchen and living area space, and rooms are climate-controlled.\n\nWhat size beds does the University offer?\n\nUniversity Housing offers different size mattresses, depending upon housing area and building type. You will want to check your assigned building to determine what size mattress is provided. If a student requires a larger mattress due to height, please contact the Housing Assignment Office to discuss options. There are limited 90\" x 36\" beds available, but can only fit in a limited number of buildings. For some room configurations, only one extra-long twin bed can be added to the room upon request, depending upon availability of beds.\n\nEast Halls\n\nrenovated residence halls: extra-long twin (80\" x 36\") - can accommodate a student up to 6'8' tall\n\nPollock Halls\n\ntraditional residence halls: regular twin (76\" x 36\") - can accommodate a student up to 6'4\" tall\n\nSouth Halls\n\nregular twin (76\" x 36\") - can accommodate a student up to 6'4\" tall\n\nextra-long twin (80\" x 36\") - can accommodate a student up to 6'8' tall\n\nNorth Halls\n\nextra-long twin (80\" x 36\") - can accommodate a student up to 6'8' tall\n\nWest Halls\n\nextra-long twin (80\" x 36\") - can accommodate a student up to 6'8' tall\n\nNittany Apartments\n\nextra-long twin (80\" x 36\") all apartments, except those listed below\n\nextra-long full-size (80\" x 54\") for these apartments: 4101, 4102, 4103, 4104, 4401, 4402, 4403, 4404, 4501, 4502, 4503, 4504, 4505, 4506, 4507, 5101, 5102, 5103, 5104, 5105, 5106, 5107, 5108, 5109, 5201, 5202, 5203, 5204, 5301, 5302, 5303, 5304, 5401, 5402, 5403, 5404, 5501, 5502, and 5503\n\nNittany Hall\n\nextra-long twin (80\" x 36\") - can accommodate a student up to 6'8' tall\n\nEastview Terrace\n\nextra-long twin (80\" x 36\") - can accommodate a student up to 6'8' tall\n\nWhite Course Apartments: single-student apartments\n\nextra-long twin (80\" x 36\") - can accommodate a student up to 6'8' tall\n\nWhen are room assignments available?\n\nSummer and spring assignment information will be made available approximately two weeks prior to arrival.
