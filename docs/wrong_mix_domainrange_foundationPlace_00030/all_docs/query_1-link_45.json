        "text": "“Principals really matter.” That’s the key finding in this report analyzing research since 2000 about school principals.\n\nThe report affirms that effective principals have a pronounced, positive effect on the schools they lead. They contribute to important outcomes like student achievement, reduced absenteeism, and teacher retention. The report also describes the practices that drive effectiveness. And it takes a close look at educational equity and the principal’s role in promoting it.\n\nPrincipal Impact\n\n“Students learn substantially more in both reading and math in schools with more effective principals,” the authors say. This affirms findings from other studies. Among them is a review of activities to strengthen school leadership. This review found links between student achievement and several principal training and related efforts. Another is a 2019 RAND examination of the impact of school leaders in districts with high-quality principal pipelines.\n\nThe authors of How Principals Affect Students and Schools reach their conclusion after analyzing two types of studies that use an approach different from the one used in the RAND pipeline study. One type is based on “value-added measures,” an approach that some researchers have misgivings about for examining principal effects. The other is based on ratings that supervisors or teachers give to principals. Both types find links between principals and student performance.\n\nResearch over the years points to other benefits, too. They include higher student attendance rates and less likelihood of chronic absenteeism. These effects are higher in urban schools and schools with greater concentrations of student poverty. Principals also affect teachers in areas including job satisfaction and turnover.\n\nGaps in Representation and Experience\n\nThe racial and ethnic make-up of the student K-12 population has changed markedly in recent decades. But the composition of the principal workforce has failed to keep pace during that period, 1988 to 2016.\n\nFor example, in 1988, about 9 percent of students were Hispanic.\n\nBy 2016, that figure was 23 percent.\n\nYet the percentage of Hispanic principals grew far more slowly, from 3 percent to 8 percent.\n\nIn addition, novice principals are more likely to be found in the highest poverty schools. “Declines in principal experience in high-poverty public schools…are an equity concern,” the authors say. That’s because “students from low-income families and other marginalized groups likely benefit the most from having an experienced principal.”\n\nOne other point. Effective principals are more likely to retain high-quality teachers and shed the lowest performers. But this pattern, called “strategic retention,” is seen more often in low-poverty than high-poverty schools, where hiring may be more challenging.\n\nFour Behaviors of Effective Principals\n\nMastery of organizational, people, and instructional skills underpins strong principal performance. They all come into play when principals carry out four key behaviors that the research points to:\n\nFocusing their work with teachers on instruction. This covers a range of activities, from coaching and evaluation to smart use of data to inform improvements. Some activities often considered important in principal work with teachers may, in fact, not be helpful. These include classroom walkthroughs, depending on how a principal uses them.\n\nBuilding a productive school climate\n\nForging collaboration and professional learning among teachers and others\n\nManaging personnel and resources well.\n\nThe Behaviors Through an Equity Lens\n\nA growing body of research describes leadership for educational equity and the practices that characterize it. It also leads to questions, such as:\n\nHow can principals remove barriers to equity?\n\nHow can they promote access to resources and supports for the success of all students?\n\nHow can they confront institutional factors that keep certain students from realizing their full potential?\n\nFor each of the four behaviors, the authors offer possible answers. For example:\n\nIn instruction, principals might work with teachers to introduce alternative teaching methods that better meet the learning needs of marginalized students.\n\nIn productive climate, they could review and change disciplinary procedures. Would home visits with parents work better than suspensions?\n\nIn collaboration, principals could build stronger connections with families and communities to better serve marginalized students.\n\nIn resources, principals could look at how they assign teachers to classes to make sure that lower-performing students benefit from outstanding instruction."
