        "text": "Navigation Sounds\n\nJust as lights play a significant role in understanding what other boats are doing, so do sounds. Understanding what you hear is another step towards being a \"complete mariner\". Virtually every boat is required to have some sound producing device. There is a great deal of latitude in what type of sound making device you choose, but loud is good!\n\nLegal Requirements\n\nEquipment for Sound Signals is based on the length of your boat as follows.\n\nBoats less than 39.4 feet in length - must carry an efficient sound producing device. In general, this may be a bell, whistle, or air horn. Though guns--even pots and pans--can make a suitable sound signal useful in getting attention in an emergency, you should always carry the appropriate equipment.\n\nBoats at least 39.4 feet to less than 65.6 feet in length - Must carry a whistle and a bell. The whistle must be audible for 1/2 nautical mile. The mouth of the bell must be at least 7.87 inches in diameter.\n\nWhen and How to Sound Off\n\nSound signals are to be used only when vessels are in sight of each other and are meeting or crossing at a distance within half a mile of each other. These signals must never be used in fog or other conditions of reduced visibility, where the vessels are not visible to each other by eye. Only the fog signals listed under the Inland Rules, Rule 35 may be sounded at such time.\n\nSignals\n\nSound signals are called \"blasts\". There are two different blasts used for warning and steering signals.\n\nShort Blast - Lasts about one second.\n\nProlonged Blast - Lasts from four to six seconds.\n\nManeuvering Signals\n\nThere are different blasts combinations for various movements on the water that may use both short and prolonged blasts. When power-driven vessels are in sight of one another and meeting or crossing at a distance within half a mile of each other, each vessel underway, when maneuvering as authorized or required by the Inland rules must use the following sound signals.\n\nOne Short Blast - This means \"I intend to leave you on MY port side\". When you pass near another boat, you will manuever by leaving them on your left side as you pass. If you are behind another boat, going the same direction and about to overtake it, one short blast means: \"I intend to pass you on YOUR starboard side, MY port side\".\n\nOne Prolonged Blast - This means you are leaving a dock or departing your slip. It signals to others a change in status and that you are getting underway. A prolonged blast is also sounded when a vessel is approaching a bend in a river where vessels coming from another direction cannot be seen. It is sometimes referred to as the “blind bend signal\".\n\nTwo Short Blasts - This means \"I intend to leave you on MY starboard side\". When you pass near another boat, you will manuever by leaving them on your right side as you pass. If you are behind another boat, going the same direction and about to overtake it, two short blasts means: \"I intend to pass you on YOUR port side, MY starboard side.\"\n\nThree Short Blasts - This means you are operating in astern propulsion, for example backing away from a dock\n\nOne Prolonged Blast + Three Short Blasts – This is technically two different signals in succession. One prolonged blast indicates you are getting under way, and three short blasts indicate you are backing up. This is what is sounded when you are departing a dock in reverse.\n\nFive Short Blasts - This is the DANGER signal. Remember, that when you approach another vessel and hear either one or two short blasts, and you both understand their signal and can safely let them do it, then you are required to respond with the same signal in response. However, if you don't understand their intentions, or feel that their proposed maneuver is dangerous to either vessel, then you are required to sound the DANGER signal.\n\nProper Sound Signals\n\nPassing Port to Port\n\nWhen you meet an oncoming vessel, and wish to pass port to port, you are required to sound one short blast with your horn. If the other boat is in agreement, they should respond with a similar blast.\n\nPassing Starboard to Starboard\n\nIf you approach another vessel head on, and wish to pass it on its starboard side, you are required to sound two short blasts with your horn. If the other vessel is in agreement, they should sound the same signal in response.\n\nOvertaking on Portside\n\nWhen you are planning on passing another vessel from behind, there are several things you must do. Any vessel that is overtaking another must keep out of the way of the vessel being overtaken. This means that you can't expect them to move, slow down, or change their course. If you plan on passing them on THEIR starboard side, you must sound one short blast. If they understand your signal and agree, they will sound one short blast in response. The vessel being overtaken has a responsibility to maintain course and speed in order to minimize the potential for collision.\n\nOvertaking on Starboard\n\nWhen you are planning on passing another vessel from behind, there are several things you must do. Any vessel that is overtaking another must keep out of the way of the vessel being overtaken. This means that you can't expect them to move, slow down, or change their course. If you plan on passing them on THEIR PORT side, you must sound two short blasts. If they understand your signal and agree, they will sound two short blasts in response. The vessel being overtaken has a responsibility to maintain course and speed in order to minimize the potential for collision."
