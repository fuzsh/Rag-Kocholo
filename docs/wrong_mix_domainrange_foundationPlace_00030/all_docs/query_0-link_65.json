        "text": "The Butterflyway Project is a citizen-led movement growing highways of habitat for bees and butterflies across Canada.\n\nIn 2017, the David Suzuki Foundation initiated the Butterflyway Project, and its sister L’effet Papillon in Quebec, in five Canadian cities. This volunteer-led movement brings nature home to neighbourhoods, one butterfly-friendly garden at a time.\n\nFrom inception to 2023, the foundation trained 1,450 Butterflyway Rangers in hundreds of communities throughout Canada. Rangers then connected with neighbours to create habitat gardens in residential yards, school and corporate grounds, boulevards and parks. When 12 or more patches are established, a new Butterflyway is born.\n\nHere is a summary of Ranger accomplishments up to 2023:\n\nMore than 106,300 native wildflowers and grasses planted\n\nApproximately 2,900 trees and shrubs planted\n\n7,200 habitat gardens established\n\n119 Butterflyways established (a Butterflyway is 12 or more habitat gardens in close proximity)\n\nThe Butterflyway Project is based on our Homegrown National Park Project, an award-winning initiative that created butterfly-friendly corridors in three Toronto neighbourhoods from 2013 to 2015. In 2020, the Butterflyway Project received the Canadian Museum of Nature’s Nature Inspiration Award. Project popularity surged in 2021, with 1,000 Canadians applying to become Butterflyway Rangers, and it has remained at that level ever since. Learn more about Butterflyway Rangers here.\n\nThe David Suzuki Foundation is committed to helping Canadians rewild their neighbourhoods. Here is a list of additional pollinator and native plant gardening resources.\n\nThank you for your interest in the Butterflyway Project. Ranger recruitment for 2024 is complete."
