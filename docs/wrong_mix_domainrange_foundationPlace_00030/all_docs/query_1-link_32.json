        "text": "Adding a storage shed to your property or performing a backyard shed renovation can add value to your home and increase storage space. Our guide will help you decide the best shed foundation type for you, how to build a shed, and when to hire a professional.\n\nPreparing for the Project\n\nBuilding a shed foundation requires intensive planning, especially for larger sheds. Most local municipalities require that homeowners file for a building permit before they begin this home improvement project.\n\nOnce you secure a permit, determine where you want to put your shed and what size of shed you can fit in the space available. Consult building codes and any homeowner associations for guidelines, and get in touch with your local utility company by calling 811. The utility company will help you identify underground utilities so you don’t damage them during construction.\n\nShed Foundation Types and How to Choose\n\nShed foundation options include on-grade and frost-proof types. You can construct an on-grade foundation more quickly, cheaply, and easily, but if you’re looking for a larger or more permanent shed, you may want to consider a frost-proof foundation. Frost-proof foundations support more weight because their footings are below the frost line, preventing shifting during temperature fluctuations and the onset of frost heaves.\n\nBefore building a frost-proof foundation, determine where your property falls on a frost-line penetration map. You must place foundation footings below the frost line during installation. The further north you live and the colder the climate, the deeper you’ll need to dig foundation footings.\n\nWe’ve listed 12 types of shed foundation types, their benefits and drawbacks, and their frost-proof ratings below. Note that you’ll only be able to construct certain types of sheds on inclines or slopes.\n\n*Cost data in this article was sourced from Angi and HomeAdvisor.\n\nHow to Build a Shed Foundation\n\nA post-and-beam foundation is a popular choice among the DIY crowd, no matter the shed size. Below is a step-by-step guide for how to build one.\n\nStep 1: Lay Out the Area\n\nYou don’t want to build a shed on uneven ground. Find a location that’s close to level and doesn’t collect water. Mark the dimensions for your shed base with mason string and batter boards, which are temporary frames that contractors use to map excavation sites.\n\nStep 2: Square\n\nSquare the area to ensure the foundation corners are at right angles. When you square your structure’s foundation, its floor joists and beams will fit together properly to ensure the building is structurally sound.\n\nSquare the corner by measuring three feet on one side and four feet on the adjacent side. Measure the distance between the two points. The distance will be five feet if squared correctly. Adjust the strings as necessary and repeat the process on all corners.\n\nStep 3: Install Posts\n\nPosts should be four feet apart. Measure for each post and mark them with more mason string and batter boards. Square the corner where you plan to plant the post using the same method listed in Step 2. Dig holes 12 inches round in diameter and 12 inches below your frost line with a post hole digger.\n\nPour approximately six inches of gravel into the hole, and compact it using a tamper. Once you’ve mixed the concrete according to the package’s instructions, pour it into the hole. Set the post into the hole, and make sure it’s level. Hold it straight as you pour concrete around the post’s sides, and top the concrete with soil.\n\nStep 4: Cut the Posts\n\nOnce you’ve installed the posts around your foundation’s perimeter, determine how high you want to construct your shed floor and mark it on the post. Measure and cut posts with a saw until they’re all at the same height. Attach brackets and the beams you’ve chosen as your runners. Then you can begin building your shed’s floor frame.\n\nHiring a Professional\n\nLabor costs for professional installation of your shed foundation fall between 40% and 60% of the total cost of the project. Taking the DIY approach to building a shed foundation may be more cost-efficient, but it requires some carpentry skills. We recommend hiring a professional if you don’t have home improvement experience, especially if you’re building a frost-proof foundation. Foundation repair is pricey—building a shed foundation yourself may lead to errors and damage down the line, even if you’re only constructing a small shed.\n\nOur Recommendation\n\nWe recommend hiring a contractor to construct your shed foundation if you want a frost-proof foundation and don’t have any home improvement DIY experience. It’s more expensive to hire a professional up-front, but you’ll ensure the job is done properly and save on repair costs down the line."
