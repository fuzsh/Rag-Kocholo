        "text": "A mattress foundation is a type of bed base. It’s the surface upon which a bed lays, offering support and protection.\n\nMost buyers assume a mattress is the end-all-be-all for comfort, but the truth is that the foundation is just as critical.\n\nWhat is a mattress foundation? It’s the sturdy, solid surface that goes beneath your bed to provide the proper support a mattress needs. Without adequate support, a mattress tends to sag or creak.\n\nWith so many options, how do you choose the right type of foundation? Read on to learn more about the most common foundations and how to select the right one for you.\n\nWhat Is a Mattress Foundation?\n\nA mattress foundation is the stable surface upon which your bed lays. A foundation provides additional support, protects your mattress, and allows airflow that helps cool your bed at night.\n\nThe terms “mattress foundation,” “bed frame,” and “base” are often used interchangeably. However, they are unique parts that make up a bed.\n\nBed frame: decorative and functional furniture with four sides that suspend a mattress off the floor\n\nMattress base: the structure that a bed lays directly upon and can support a mattress on its own\n\nMattress foundation: a type of mattress base or the portion of the base, such as slats or planks, that cannot support the bed alone\n\nA mattress foundation is a type of mattress base. Some foundation types are more commonly referred to as a “base” rather than a foundation — this rings true with an adjustable base. Some types of foundations cannot be used by themselves. For example, you should not place a mattress over a roll of slats or atop a boxspring that lies directly on a bedroom floor.\n\nWhile many bed frames come with foundational support in planks or rods, it may not be enough for your specific mattress. This is common in panel bed frames as their wide gaps between slats don’t offer enough support. In this case, you would need to purchase an additional foundation. Be sure to double-check your mattress’s setup and care instructions to determine if extra support is needed.\n\nRead the FAQ at the bottom of the article for more information specific to different types of mattresses.\n\nMattress Foundation Benefits\n\nA solid mattress foundation has the ability to improve your overall sleep experience. Here are six benefits of a mattress foundation:\n\nImproves support: A quality base helps to maintain the shape and integrity of even the most pliable of latex mattresses. In turn, this allows your mattress to provide the proper support your body needs for deep sleep.\n\nPromotes mattress cleanliness: Bed foundations act as a barrier between your mattress and the floor to keep dirt, dust, and other unwanted elements from gathering within and on top of your mattress.\n\nIncreases mattress lifespan: By providing support and promoting cleanliness, a bed foundation helps extend your mattress’s life.\n\nAdds height: A mattress base provides the bed height needed to make getting in and out of bed easier.\n\nIncreases airflow: Bed foundations allow for airflow above and below the mattress, helping to keep you cool while you sleep.\n\nPrevents mattress sliding: ​​A proper bed foundation prevents mattresses from sliding as you move throughout the night.\n\nTypes of Mattress Foundations\n\nMost mattresses have a complementary base that provides the proper support and keeps them in place. Here are some of the most common bed foundations and their corresponding mattresses.\n\n1. Adjustable Bed Base\n\nAlso known as a power base, an adjustable bed base moves and flexes to accommodate any sleeping style. Adjustable bed bases are typically electronic metal frames that allow you to lay at an incline or with your feet and legs elevated. Many adjustable bases can be placed within a bed frame by using the adjustable height legs or zero clearance feature.\n\nAdjustable bases can be particularly helpful for customizing comfort to improve your sleep and health while elevating your everyday lifestyle, whether spent working or watching television from bed.\n\nIdeal Sleeper:\n\nThose who use their bed for other activities outside of sleep (i.e. work, reading, etc.)\n\nThose who find an elevated position improves overnight comfort and, therefore, better sleep\n\nPeople who struggle with snoring\n\nSleepers who need extra help with getting in and out of bed more easily\n\nIdeal Mattress Type:\n\nMemory foam\n\nLatex\n\nSome hybrid and innerspring mattresses\n\n2. Platform Base\n\nPlatform foundations are typically made of wood or metal planks or a grid of metal bars to support a mattress, like the Purple Platform Bed Frame. Platform bases already have foundational support built into their design and do not require extra slats or a box spring.\n\nThis pared-down option is engineered to exact measurements of standard mattress sizes. Platform beds often sit higher, allowing extra storage space underneath.\n\nIdeal Mattress Type:\n\nMemory foam\n\nLatex\n\nHybrid\n\nInnerspring\n\nSome air mattresses\n\nSome water beds\n\n3. Flat Foundations\n\nModern box springs, often called flat foundations, are similar to box springs in appearance and aesthetic but are simply just a metal or wood box covered with fabric, no springs included. With no springs, flat foundations can be used with most mattress types.\n\nFlat foundations are ideal for:\n\nTall individuals looking to add height to their bed\n\nPanel bed frames with an open design or wide gaps between support rails\n\nIdeal Mattress Type:\n\nMemory foam\n\nLatex\n\nHybrid\n\n4. Box Springs\n\nTraditional box springs have innersprings and are typically constructed of wood or semi-flex steel.\n\nBox springs are almost always paired with innerspring mattresses. In most cases, memory foam beds, latex, hybrid, and Purple mattresses shouldn’t be used with box spring foundations. The coils in a traditional box spring can damage these beds over time.\n\nBox springs are ideal for:\n\nTall individuals looking for a bed that’s not low to the ground\n\nPanel bed frames with an open design or wide gaps between support rails\n\nIdeal Mattress Type:\n\nInnerspring mattresses\n\nREAD MORE:Bed Slats vs Box Springs\n\n5. Bed Slats\n\nA slatted foundation is a set of long solid wood inside a bed frame. Slats are an inexpensive and straightforward solution for proper bed support. They also provide added air circulation, meaning cooler sleep.\n\nBed slats should be no more than 3 inches apart from one another and each slat should be about 2.5 to 3.5 inches wide and 1 inch tall. These measurements ensure your mattress gets the support it requires while preventing sag over time. Narrow slats may offer more air circulation but less support. Be sure to check your slatted mattress foundation's spacing regularly to avoid damaging your mattress\n\nMany bed frames come with a built-in slatted foundation, though the option to buy slats separately means you don’t have to buy an entire frame if a slat breaks. Rolled slats are a common option that are easy to assemble and store and more likely to stay in proper placement over time.\n\nIdeal Mattress Type:\n\nMemory foam\n\nLatex\n\nMost hybrids\n\nMost innersprings\n\n6. Bunkie Boards\n\nA bunkie board is a 1- to 3-inch flat barrier, usually made of wood, plywood, or particleboard, designed to fit between your mattress and the bed frame it rests on. While they offer additional support and firmness, it comes at the cost of blocked airflow.\n\nBunkie boards are ideal for:\n\nBunk beds\n\nChildren's beds, like floor beds\n\nSleepers who don't want extra height for their mattress\n\nPanel bed frames with an open design or wide gaps between support rails\n\nIdeal Mattress Type:\n\nAll mattress types\n\nPurple Mattress Foundations\n\nThe right bed frame can dramatically improve your sleep experience.

Here’s what to consider before deciding on a bed foundation.\n\n1. Consider Mattress Type and Size\n\nYour mattress plays a crucial role in the bed foundation that will suit you best. When replacing bedroom furniture, it’s best to buy the bed foundation and frame that suits your mattress, not the other way around. First, pick the best mattress type for your typical sleeping position, then decide on the complementary bed frame that provides proper support.\n\nMost bed foundations will work with any mattress type, though, to be safe, reference the graphic below of the ideal mattress and foundation pairings.\n\nMost bed foundations can be paired with most mattress sizes unless you have a specialty size, such as an Alaskan king bed, which may require a custom-built frame.\n\n2. Set Your Budget\n\nIdentifying a budget for a bed frame is important when you begin looking. Generally, adjustable bed frames and platform foundations fall within a higher price range, while slatted mattress foundations or bunkie boards are less expensive. The most inexpensive option may not always be the best, so weigh the pros and cons.\n\nREAD MORE: Best Time To Buy a Mattress\n\n3. Assess the Durability\n\nMost adjustable bases and some bed frames include weight capacities in their product specifications. Weight capacity identifies the specific weight — including mattress, bedding, and sleepers with even distribution — a bed frame or base is built to support.\n\n4. Review the Assembly Requirements\n\nNobody wants to struggle with bed frame assembly, so take a bit of time to decide if you can assemble your unit by yourself or will require help. This is especially important if you move often, as you’ll have to take apart the base and frame.\n\n5. Choose Your Style and Design Preference\n\nMany people consider a bed frame’s design to be one of the most important factors when choosing a unit. Depending on the foundation you choose, you may or may not need a separate bed frame — it just depends on your preferred aesthetic.\n\nVisualize how your foundation will look with your other bedroom fixtures and furniture. You may also want to match your windows and doors' metal and wood finishes to those of your bed foundation.\n\n6. Read the Warranty\n\nMost mattress warranties will outline appropriate bed foundations as well as which ones will void the warranty. For example, Purple mattresses do not work with box springs, and using one will void your warranty. Be sure to check the warranty label before buying if you plan to use a prior base with a new mattress.\n\nWhen To Replace Your Mattress Foundation\n\nIt’s not always necessary to purchase a new foundation with the acquisition of a new mattress. Identifying their compatibility and the condition of your current foundation will be the determining factor.\n\nYou should purchase a new base for your bed in the following scenarios:\n\nParts are loose and cannot be tightened\n\nParts are cracked, broken, or stop working\n\nProtective fabric is ripped or has holes (for box springs)\n\nYour mattress sags or dips even though it’s relatively new\n\nYour mattress moves around or won’t stay in place\n\nYour new mattress doesn’t pair well with your old foundation (i.e., you upgrade to a hybrid mattress from an innerspring and only have a panel bed frame)\n\nHow long your mattress foundation will last depends on its type, materials, how much daily weight it supports, and how much activity it sees. On average, this is when you should replace your foundation based on which type you have:"
