        "meta_description": "Portrait of Edna Amos Nice\n\t\n\t•Artist: Stanislav Rembski (1896-1998)\n\t•Title: Edna Amos Nice (1882-1955)\n\t•Date: 1961\n\t•Medium: Oil on Canvas\n\t•Dimensions: 40 × 32\"\n\t•Accession Number: MSA SC 1545-1203\n\t\n\tEdna Viola Amos Nice (1882-1955)\n\t\n\tMSA SC 3520-2299\n\t\n\tFirst Lady of Maryland, 1935-1939\n\t\n\t•Born: April 14, 1882 in Baltimore, Maryland\n\t•Amos Family Home: Baltimore, Maryland\n\t•Marriage: June 8, 1905 to Governor Harry W. Nice\n\t•Children: Harry, Jr. and William (who died in infancy)\n\t•Second Marriage: Widowed on February 24, 1941, Married Waitman F. Zinn\n\t•Died: March 11, 1955 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida\n\t•Buried: Greenmount Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland\n\t\n\tEdna Viola Amos was born in Baltimore on April 14, 1882. She attended public schools  and “The Girls’ Latin School.” Between 1901 and 1904 the family lived in Atlanta, Georgia; they moved back to Baltimore in 1904. On June 7, 1905, Edna married Harry W. Nice, to whom she had gotten engaged before the move to Atlanta. The couple had two children: Harry W. Nice, Jr., and William, who lived only one year.\n\t\n\t“You may be quite sure there will be plenty of social life with us in the Governor’s Mansion; we’ve always been fond of company. We like informal entertaining,” Mrs. Nice remarked in an interview with The Evening Capital shortly after assuming her role as First Lady of Maryland. Maryland once again had an official state hostess in Mrs. Nice; the state had been without one since the death of Governor Ritchie’s mother several years before the end of his term. Mrs. Nice increased the number of formal occasions and receptions at Government House and the number of staff persons in the house along with them. She preferred to do her own daily shopping and was seen frequenting the Annapolis shops and grocery stores in the mornings. Although a cook who had been with the Nice household for 17 years accompanied the Nices to Annapolis, Mrs. Nice also enjoyed using the kitchen of the newly-remodeled governor’s mansion to do her own cooking for herself, Governor Nice and Harry, Jr.\n\t\n\tMrs. Nice had few hobbies, most of which centered around her home. “I love my flowers. I love my car. I love my home, and my husband most of all. I’m not a club woman. I don’t play golf and I’m not fond of bridge. Frequently when my husband is busy with meetings at night I take in the movies,” declared Mrs. Nice.  Before Nice’s election as governor, Mrs. Nice enjoyed driving her husband to work every day from their home in Mount Washington to his Baltimore law office. She and her husband enjoyed traveling, and she did all of the driving on their many trips around the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.\n\t\n\tMrs. Nice spent much of her first two years as Maryland’s First Lady supervising the renovation of Government House from a dilapidated mid-Victorian house into the Georgian structure that is seen today. Mrs. Nice took an active role in the project, planning the alterations in the interior along with her husband, supervising the removal of dead trees from the property, interviewing decorators and accepting bids on interior work, choosing color schemes and fabrics for draperies and the reupholstering of furniture, and seeing to the finishing touches. After the house was complete, Mrs. Nice planned and planted a garden for the grounds in which she grew phlox, Shasta daisies, lilies, and roses. She also added a fish pond and stocked it with goldfish, a diamond back terrapin, a turtle, and a frog.\n\t\n\tA highlight of Mrs. Nice’s term as First Lady was the visit of President Franklin D. Roosevelt to Government House for tea on a stop from his speaking tour through Maryland in the fall of 1938 on behalf of candidates for the U.S. congress. Although Roosevelt and Nice belonged to different political parties, President Roosevelt spent an hour or two with Governor and Mrs. Nice at Government House, during which the two politicians were reported to have had a friendly discussion on a first-name basis. This was not the first gathering of the Nices and Roosevelts, as Governor and Mrs. Nice had been guests of the Roosevelts at the White House shortly after Nice assumed office in January 1935 and had lunched on the presidential yacht Sequoia when President and Mrs. Roosevelt had come to Annapolis that spring to watch the Navy and Harvard rowing races on the Severn River.\n\t\n\tOne of Mrs. Nice’s fondest memories was said to have been a dinner party given by friends several years preceding the start of her husband’s governorship during which he paid her the following tribute:\n\t\n\t“For nearly twenty years it has been my pleasing and wholesome privilege to have had, as the companion of my heart and soul, one, whose purity of mind and simplicity of love and affection has ever rendered my anticipation sublime. To me, twenty-five years ago, she appeared like a young rapt saint, exuding the faint and intoxicating perfume of pure womanliness; her beauty broke on me like some rare flower; her glory was the glory of the lily; her loveliness was the loveliness of the full blown rose, which so flushed her brow that it radiated the refulgent rays of womanly virtue, unimpeachable character and a heart of gold.\n\t\n\t“The years have vanished like snow when comes the thaw. Like the disappearing May snow drifts they have sunk into the past, and have become as shadowy faces, which we see in our dreams, and which pass as petals upon a swift moving stream. All of these virtues she has retained to an emphasized and marked degree. Her caresses, as then, are as soft as the down of the turtle dove; her love still falls about, and on me, like a sweet rain; something divine seems to cling around her like a sweet, subtle vapor which steals lingering on the placid bosom of a beautiful lake. Her loyal, loving presence has ever been my beacon; guiding and strengthening me in the dark hours of sorrow, filling me with joy and happiness in my moments of prosperity, ever, and always, my incentive to better things. The poverty of my language forbids an attempt at expression of my real love, gratitude, and respect. I can only say I love her; she is my heartease, my life with her has been sweeter than the honey in the honey-comb; her voice is like sweet music; her face like unto the angels; her eyes flashing with sunbeams, smiling a divine delight into my soul; and until death shall claim me as her very own, I pledge her unabated, undying love, fidelity and respect.\n\t\n\tMay the gathering glory of her life shine like the dawn; may her days be as long and as happy as the waves that dance on the sea; may her patient, sweet disposition ever fill my weary hours, shining upon me with the brilliance of the stars always unutterably bright, as they move like silver barques upon the azure sea of heaven, may it fall upon me like a ray of light from a heaven of peace.\n\t\n\t“Surrounded by you, my friends, I welcome this opportunity to thus publicly pay tribute to My Love, and before presenting this intrinsic evidence of my affection, I ask you to join me in drinking to the health of her, whose holy love has like some vestal flame, burned into my soul and left its indelible impress upon my heart—to my wife.”\n\t\n\t\n\tPortrait of Mary Byrnes O’Conor\n\t\n\t•Artist: Stanislav Rembski (1896-1998)\n\t•Title: Mary Byrnes O’Conor (1896-1971)\n\t•Date: 1961\n\t•Medium: Oil on Canvas\n\t•Dimensions: 40 × 32\"\n\t•Accession Number: MSA SC 1545-1204\n\t\n\tEugenia Byrnes O’Conor (1896-1971)\n\t\n\tMSA SC 3520-2289\n\t\n\tFirst Lady of Maryland, 1939-1947\n\t\n\t•Born: December 24, 1896 in Baltimore, Maryland\n\t•Mother: Catherine Hawkins Byrnes\n\t•Father: James Byrnes\n\t•Byrnes Family Home: Baltimore, Maryland\n\t•Marriage: November 24, 1920 to Governor Herbert R. O’Conor\n\t•Children: Herbert, Jr., Eugene, Mary Patricia, James, Robert\n\t•Died: October 11, 1971 in Baltimore, Maryland\n\t•Burial: Cathedral Cemetery, Baltimore, Maryland\n\t\n\tMary Eugenia Byrnes O’Conor was the wife of Herbert R. O’Conor, the fifty-first governor of Maryland serving in office from 1939-1947. Known as Eugenia, she met Herbert in the spring of 1911 at St. John’s Catholic Church in Baltimore when she was only twelve and he just fourteen years old. Herbert and Eugenia maintained their friendship throughout their teens and through Herbert’s term in the Navy Reserves during the last stages of World War I. The two became active members of the Loyola Club, a Catholic social club for young singles that held dances, performed plays and sponsored musical events. Herbert graduated from the University of Maryland Law School in June, 1920, and although his parents would have preferred that he was better established in his law career before getting married, Herbert and Eugenia set the date for November 24, 1920, and the two were married at St. Philip and St. James Church in Baltimore. The O’Conors would eventually have five children: Herbert, Jr., Eugene, Mary (O’Conor) Farley, James, and Robert.\n\t\n\tDuring her eight-year tenure as First Lady of Maryland, Mrs. O’Conor led an active home life as a mother while maintaining a full schedule in her capacity as wife of Maryland’s governor. At the beginning of the first O’Conor administration in 1939, the five children ranged in age from sixteen to three. Four of the children attended school in Baltimore, and Mrs. O’Conor spent a lot of time driving them back and forth between Baltimore and Annapolis. At the same time, she  held at least two series’ of receptions at Government House that were open to the public, and was active in the Democratic Women’s Clubs of Annapolis and Baltimore, hosting members of the clubs for tea at Government House. In 1943, Mrs. O’Conor served as one of the hostesses for the “President’s Ball” in Annapolis, the proceeds of which went to fund polio research. The O’Conors continued the tradition of holding formal receptions for members of the General Assembly and their friends at Government House, attended by more than 1,000 people at a time. They hosted Naval Academy officials for dinner at the house and held several fund-raising events in the house to support such causes as improvements to the local hospital and to the new Ritchie Highway.\n\t\n\tThe O’Conor administration paralleled the war in Europe and America’s entry into World War II. Mrs. O’Conor supported the war effort by donating blood and by serving as a patron along with her husband for fund-raisers for the benefit of the National War Fund and for general war relief. The O’Conors also held a special reception at Government House for servicemen stationed at Fort Meade.\n\t\n\tAs First Lady of Maryland, Mrs. O’Conor became “noted for her skills as a hostess, entertaining a wide variety of diplomats and royalty in Government House” including the royal family of Luxembourg, the exiled president of Lithuania, the Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark, British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden, and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. In June, 1939, the O’Conors attended a garden party given at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C. by King George and Queen Elizabeth of England. The O’Conors occasionally attended events in Washington, D.C. such as teas and luncheons with congressmen and cabinet members of the Roosevelt administration and their families.  In May, 1940, Eugenia was a guest along with Herbert and a few others at the Maryland home of Under-Secretary of State Sumner Welles, where she enjoyed a friendly chat with President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  In spite of her full social calendar and her active work on behalf of public causes, her oldest son Herbert O’Conor, Jr. remarked upon her death in October, 1971 that “her favorite place was at home, close to her family.”\n\t\n\t\n\tPortrait of Dorothy Byron Lane\n\t\n\t•Artist: Stanislav Rembski (1896-1998)\n\t•Title: Dorothy Byron Lane (1897-1993)\n\t•Date: 1961\n\t•Medium: Oil on Canvas\n\t•Dimensions: 40 × 32\"\n\t•Accession Number: MSA SC 1545-1184\n\t\n\tDorothy Byron Lane (1896-1993)\n\t\n\tMSA SC 3520-2290\n\t\n\tFirst Lady of Maryland, 1947-1951\n\t\n\t•Born: August 9, 1896 in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania\n\t•Mother: Virginia Brewer Byron\n\t•Father: Lewis T. Byron\n\t•Byron Family Home: Mercersburg, Pennsylvania and Hagerstown, Maryland\n\t•Marriage: January 17, 1922 to William Preston Lane, Jr.\n\t•Children: Dorothy Lane Campbell, Jean Lane Goddard\n\t•Lane Family Home: Hagerstown, Maryland\n\t•Died: January 29, 1993 in Hagerstown, Maryland\n\t\n\tDorothy Byron, daughter of Lewis T. and Virginia Brewer Byron, was born in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania in 1896. When she was two years old, the family moved to Hagerstown, Maryland where they lived across the street from the Lane family. William Preston (“Pres”) Lane, Jr. was four years her senior, and the two married on January 17, 1922. The house they purchased in 1925 in Hagerstown served as their permanent residence for all but their four years in Annapolis. The couple had two daughters, Dorothy and Jean.\n\t\n\tAs First Lady of Maryland, Mrs. Lane made few changes to Government House. She was an avid gardener and her daily routine included placing fresh flowers in the various rooms in order to add her own personal touch to the house. Her other interests included playing golf as well as attending operas and symphonies. She was a member of the Hagerstown Garden Club, Arts and Letters Club, and Women’s Club.\n\t\n\tKnown as “shy” and “self-effacing,” and described as “uncomfortable in public,” Mrs. Lane nevertheless campaigned with her husband and invited visitors to Government House during her tenure as First Lady. “I really love to receive groups here, particularly groups of children,” reported Mrs. Lane. “It’s an impressive and historic house, and I think it makes an impression on children.”\n\t\n\tIn 1947 a controversy arose around Mrs. Lane when rumors began circulating that she was personally benefiting from the state sales tax that her husband had supported and had pushed through the legislature. “It’s very disheartening when you are so careful with expenditures to hear the rumor that the sales tax paid for your daughter’s wedding,” she said. Her older daughter Dorothy reported that, “Mother is a worrier and terribly conscientious. She really takes her job seriously, and I know she’s often hurt by the rough and tumble of politics.” Mrs. Lane proved to be fiscally conservative, however, and reported at the end of her tenure as First Lady that she had saved enough money from the housekeeping allowance to buy an eighteenth-century portrait of  Horatio Sharpe (Governor of Maryland from 1753 to 1769) and his family from the Vose Galleries in Boston. The portrait was presented to the state in 1951 and now hangs in the Government House dining room.\n\t\n\tIn 1973 Mrs. Lane cut the ribbon opening the second span of the William Preston Lane, Jr. Memorial Bridge across the Chesapeake Bay, named after her husband following his death in 1967. Her later years were spent quietly in her Hagerstown home that she had once shared with her husband. It was there that she died in 1993 at the age of ninety-six.\n\t\n\t\n\tPortrait of Honolulu Claire Manzer McKeldin\n\t\n\t•Artist: Stanislav Rembski (1896-1998)\n\t•Title: Honolulu McKeldin (1900-1988)\n\t•Date: 1961\n\t•Medium: Oil on Canvas\n\t•Dimensions: 40 × 32\"\n\t•Accession Number: MSA SC 1545-1188\n\t\n\tHonolulu Claire Manzer McKeldin (1900-1988)\n\t\n\tMSA SC 3520-2291\n\t\n\tFirst Lady of Maryland, 1951-1959\n\t\n\t•Born: January 26, 1900 in Sidney Center, New York\n\t•Mother: Maud F. Manzer\n\t•Father: Merton G. Manzer\n\t•Siblings: Janet and Helen Manzer\n\t•Manzer Family Home: Sidney Center, New York and Baltimore, Maryland\n\t•Religious Affiliation: Episcopal Church of the Redeemer\n\t•Marriage: October 17, 1924 to Governor Theodore R. McKeldin\n\t•Children: Theodore, Jr. and Clara Whitney Ziegler\n\t•McKeldin Family Home: 203 Paddington Rd., Homeland\n\t•Died: August 8, 1988 in Homeland, Maryland\n\t•Burial: Greenmount Cemtery, Baltimore, Maryland\n\t\n\tHonolulu Claire Manzer McKeldin was the wife of Theodore R. McKeldin (1900-1974), the fifty-third governor of Maryland, serving in office from 1951-1959. She was born in Binghamton, New York and graduated from the Maryland Institute in Costume Design. Mrs. McKeldin met her future husband while they were both working in a bank in Baltimore. They were married on October 17, 1924, during his last year in law school.  They settled into an unassuming home in a quiet area of Baltimore, where they lived for most of their married lives. The McKeldins had two children, Theodore R. McKeldin, Jr., and Clara Whitney (McKeldin) Zeigler.\n\t\n\tDuring her husband’s term as Mayor of Baltimore from 1943-1947, Mrs. McKeldin served as a nutritionist for the Red Cross and worked regularly in the annual Flower Mart of the Women’s Civic League. A prize-winning gardener, she also enjoyed drawing and painting still lifes and landscapes.\n\t\n\tUpon becoming First Lady of Maryland in 1951, Mrs. McKeldin asserted in an interview with The Evening Capital that she while she anticipated an enjoyable tenure in Annapolis, she planned to avoid the “public eye” and focus her energies on her home and family (Teddy was 14 and Clara 11 when the family moved into Government House). “When your husband is in politics,” she said, “I think it’s just as well for the wife to keep in the background and let him do all the talking. That way she can’t make any mistakes for him.”\n\t\n\tOne would not have guessed, however, that this was her intention judging by the list of activities with which  Mrs. McKeldin became involved while in Annapolis. She was an honorary member of the Naval Academy Women’s Club and frequently attended its meetings; on one such occasion she received First Lady Mamie Eisenhower when she made the trip from Washington, D.C. to Annapolis in order to address the members of the Club. Mrs. McKeldin’s other memberships included the Women’s Division of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, the Women’s Auxiliary to the Salvation Army, the Women’s Civic League of Baltimore, the Women’s Auxiliary to Anne Arundel General Hospital, the Empty Stocking Club, the Free Arts Club, and the Homeland Garden Club, where she served as treasurer.\n\t\n\tIn April, 1952, Governor and Mrs. McKeldin took a month-long trip to Europe and the Middle East in which they combined business with pleasure. During that trip, the McKeldins lunched with General and Mrs. Eisenhower at their villa outside Paris, met Pope Pius XII in Rome and spent Easter in Jerusalem. While in Israel, the McKeldins took a day trip to the mines at Elath, near the Red Sea. In order to get there, they had to endure a bumpy jeep ride over twenty-five miles of sand, which Mrs. McKeldin weathered while dressed for a tea planned for later that day, holding on to her hat and trying not to bounce out of the jeep. “Now I’ve seen everything,” declared Mrs. McKeldin to The Evening Capital upon her return to Annapolis.\n\t\n\tAnother highlight of Mrs. McKeldin’s term as First Lady of Maryland was the visit to Annapolis on November 8, 1954 of Queen Elizabeth of England, the Queen Mother. The McKeldins escorted the Queen Mother in a tour of colonial Annapolis that included the State House, St. Anne’s Church, and the Naval Academy. Local schools closed early to permit schoolchildren to join the thousands of Annapolitans who lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the Queen Mother as she and the McKeldins greeted the crowds. The McKeldins then enjoyed traditional Maryland fare at a luncheon with the queen and her entourage in Government House.\n\t\n\tA collector of old jewelry and antiques, Mrs. McKeldin enjoyed attending antique shows with her husband. As First Lady,  Mrs. McKeldin acquired several pieces of silver for Government House, including a tea and coffee service currently displayed in the State Dining Room.\n\t\n\t\n\tPortrait of Helen Avalynne Gibson Tawes\n\t\n\t•Artist: Stanislav Rembski (1896-1998)\n\t•Title: Helen Avalynne Gibson Tawes (1898-1989)\n\t•Date: 1961\n\t•Medium: Oil on Canvas\n\t•Dimensions: 40 × 32\"\n\t•Accession Number: MSA SC 1545-1217\n\t\n\tHelen Avalynne Gibson Tawes (1898-1989)\n\t\n\tMSA SC 3520-2292\n\t\n\tFirst Lady of Maryland, 1959-1967\n\t\n\t•Born: October 9, 1898\n\t•Gibson Family Home: Crisfield, Maryland\n\t•Religious Affiliation: Ashbury United Methodist Church, Crisfield\n\t•Marriage: December 25, 1915 to Governor J. Millard Tawes in Fruitland\n\t•Children: Philip W. and Jimmie Lee\n\t•Died: July 17, 1989\n\t•Burial Place: Sunny Ridge Memorial Park, Crisfield, Maryland\n\t\n\tHelen Avalynne Gibson, daughter of Minerva Amerinth and Oliver P. Gibson, was born in Crisfield, Maryland on October 9, 1898. The last of nine children, she became known as “Lou” to her closest companions and as “Miss Avalynne” to many other admirers. As a young girl, Helen studied piano and voice at the Peabody Institute. Although she lived the majority of her life in Crisfield, her years as a student at the Peabody were spent with her family in Mt. Washington, Baltimore. During her education, she was asked to showcase her musical talents by performing live on a Salisbury radio program. Helen continued her interest in music throughout her life, and was often found at her electric organ when the first family was entertaining at Government House during the Tawes administration. She also was a longstanding member the choir of Crisfield’s Asbury Methodist Church. In addition to her personal artistic endeavors, Mrs. Tawes was also an active patron of local cultural programs. She was a member of the Baltimore Opera Guild as well as the Women’s Symphony Organization, the Baltimore Music Club, and the Women’s Organization of the Salvation Army. When she was in Baltimore she enjoyed attending the concerts of the Baltimore Symphony, and invited friends from Annapolis and Baltimore to share the Governor’s box with her.\n\tAt the age of sixteen, Helen met J. Millard Tawes on a hayride. He was the twenty-year-old son of Alice Byrd and James B. Tawes of Crisfield. The two were married about a year later on Christmas Day, 1915, in a secret ceremony at a Methodist Church in Fruitland; they eloped because they believed that their parents would not approve of her marrying at the young age of seventeen. The two lived apart at their parents’ homes for two weeks before Helen’s older sister Oneida discovered the marriage license in a drawer and told everyone about it. Years later, Helen described the elopement as “the most romantic thing I ever did in my life.” Millard and Helen had two children, daughter Jimmie Lee and son Philip Wesley. The family lived in Crisfield in a house that Millard built right next door to his parent’s home. The Tawes lived in this home for their entire married lives, except for the years spent in Annapolis during Governor Tawes’ administration.\n\t\n\tMillard Tawes’ political career began in the 1930s when he was elected Clerk of the Somerset County Circuit Court. He later became State Comptroller as well as a State Banking Commissioner. He won the governorship of Maryland in 1958, an office which he held for eight years. Mrs. Tawes had been an enthusiastic participant in Millard’s campaign for governor, handing out a pamphlet of her favorite Maryland recipes along with the campaign literature.  Later expanded into a best-selling cookbook entitled My Favorite Maryland Recipes, the recipe collection revealed her family secrets for preparing traditional Maryland delicacies such as blue crabs, terrapin, and oysters. In addition to the recipes, she also shared her personal cooking philosophies which included using simple seasonings in order to prevent overpowering the true taste of the dish and always shucking your own oysters to make sure the shell is removed properly.\n\t\n\tMrs. Tawes’ recipes became famous outside the boundaries of the state after being served in the Maryland Pavilion at the 1964 World’s Fair in New York. Among the dishes offered was her fast food version of a crab cake, called a “crab-burger.” Her cooking abilities apparently became world renowned, since she personally took over Government House’s kitchen in order to cook a special crock of terrapin soup to send to Sir Winston Churchill in London for which England’s former Prime Minister sent a grateful letter of appreciation. Mrs. Tawes’ efforts to popularize Maryland cuisine culminated in 1964 when the House of Delegates drafted a resolution to recognize her success and to commend her for promoting Maryland as “the land of fine food.”\n\t\n\tIn addition to her culinary pursuits, Mrs. Tawes also worked to make a positive difference in public affairs. She worked with former First Lady Lady Bird Johnson on the Head Start program. She joined with the Maryland Federation of Women’s Clubs to educate the public on civil defense home preparedness, receiving the club’s Home Preparedness Award for her efforts to use Government House as a model for safe homes across the state. She secured the approval of the legislature to hang portraits of former first ladies in Government House, and began the publication of a pamphlet on the history of the House.\n\t\n\tTawes also shared her husband’s avid interest in environmental conservation. During his administration, Governor Tawes not only made Assateague Island a national park, but also doubled the area of land covered by the state parks system. Reflecting Mrs. Tawes interest in educating the public about the rich diversity of Maryland, in 1975 she broke ground on a six-acre garden, named in her honor, at the Tawes State Office Building in Annapolis. This garden was designed cooperatively by the Federated Garden Clubs of Maryland, the Department of Natural Resources, and the Department of General Services, to showcase the harmony inherent in the various state landscapes including the mountains of the West and the beaches of the Eastern Shore.\n\t\n\tPerhaps Mrs. Tawes is most noteworthy, especially in the context of this study, because of her own personal interest in Maryland’s First Ladies. In an interview with the local press, Mrs. Tawes remarked that “a governor’s wife comes here and she works like a dog. I just feel that they get so little credit, some recognition would be nice.” To remedy what she felt was a glaring omission in the state’s history, during her tenure at Government House, she commissioned official portraits of the last five women to occupy the post. In addition to the portrait of herself, Mrs. Tawes hired Baltimore artist Stanislav Rembski to paint Honolulu McKeldin, Dorothy Lane, Eugenia O’Conor, and the late Edna Viola Amos Nice Zinn. The Maryland General Assembly granted Mrs. Tawes ten thousand dollars from the state’s general emergency fund to complete the paintings. With these portraits, Mrs. Tawes not only succeeded in preserving the images of five First Ladies, but she also elevated their position as a whole. Due to her efforts, it is now customary for the First Lady or Official Hostess to have an official portrait made, just like the governor. Inspired by Mrs. Tawes’ sentiments, current First Lady Frances Hughes Glendening, with the assistance of the Maryland State Archives, created an exhibit of the thirteen First Ladies’ portraits from the state’s collection. These portraits now adorn the walls of Government House, and the Archives is seeking out other paintings to complete the collection.\n\t\n\tAfter their tenure in Annapolis, the Tawes family moved back to their Crisfield home. Both Mr. and Mrs. Tawes remained active and visible members of their community. Mr. Tawes continued serving in the state government in the Department of Natural Resources and after his retirement continued to work two or three days a week in an office in Crisfield. After his death in 1979, Mrs. Tawes remained a widow and continued to live in their Crisfield home until her death at the age of ninety on July 17, 1989.",

        "text": "Portrait of Edna Amos Nice\n\n•Artist: Stanislav Rembski (1896-1998)\n\n•Title: Edna Amos Nice (1882-1955)\n\n•Date: 1961\n\n•Medium: Oil on Canvas\n\n•Dimensions: 40 × 32\"\n\n•Accession Number: MSA SC 1545-1203\n\nEdna Viola Amos Nice (1882-1955)\n\nMSA SC 3520-2299\n\nFirst Lady of Maryland, 1935-1939\n\n•Born: April 14, 1882 in Baltimore, Maryland\n\n•Amos Family Home: Baltimore, Maryland\n\n•Marriage: June 8, 1905 to Governor Harry W. Nice\n\n•Children: Harry, Jr. and William (who died in infancy)\n\n•Second Marriage: Widowed on February 24, 1941, Married Waitman F. Zinn\n\n•Died: March 11, 1955 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida\n\n•Buried: Greenmount Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland\n\nEdna Viola Amos was born in Baltimore on April 14, 1882. She attended public schools and “The Girls’ Latin School.” Between 1901 and 1904 the family lived in Atlanta, Georgia; they moved back to Baltimore in 1904. On June 7, 1905, Edna married Harry W. Nice, to whom she had gotten engaged before the move to Atlanta. The couple had two children: Harry W. Nice, Jr., and William, who lived only one year.\n\n“You may be quite sure there will be plenty of social life with us in the Governor’s Mansion; we’ve always been fond of company. We like informal entertaining,” Mrs. Nice remarked in an interview with The Evening Capital shortly after assuming her role as First Lady of Maryland. Maryland once again had an official state hostess in Mrs. Nice; the state had been without one since the death of Governor Ritchie’s mother several years before the end of his term. Mrs. Nice increased the number of formal occasions and receptions at Government House and the number of staff persons in the house along with them. She preferred to do her own daily shopping and was seen frequenting the Annapolis shops and grocery stores in the mornings. Although a cook who had been with the Nice household for 17 years accompanied the Nices to Annapolis, Mrs. Nice also enjoyed using the kitchen of the newly-remodeled governor’s mansion to do her own cooking for herself, Governor Nice and Harry, Jr.\n\nMrs. Nice had few hobbies, most of which centered around her home. “I love my flowers. I love my car. I love my home, and my husband most of all. I’m not a club woman. I don’t play golf and I’m not fond of bridge. Frequently when my husband is busy with meetings at night I take in the movies,” declared Mrs. Nice. Before Nice’s election as governor, Mrs. Nice enjoyed driving her husband to work every day from their home in Mount Washington to his Baltimore law office. She and her husband enjoyed traveling, and she did all of the driving on their many trips around the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.\n\nMrs. Nice spent much of her first two years as Maryland’s First Lady supervising the renovation of Government House from a dilapidated mid-Victorian house into the Georgian structure that is seen today. Mrs. Nice took an active role in the project, planning the alterations in the interior along with her husband, supervising the removal of dead trees from the property, interviewing decorators and accepting bids on interior work, choosing color schemes and fabrics for draperies and the reupholstering of furniture, and seeing to the finishing touches. After the house was complete, Mrs. Nice planned and planted a garden for the grounds in which she grew phlox, Shasta daisies, lilies, and roses. She also added a fish pond and stocked it with goldfish, a diamond back terrapin, a turtle, and a frog.\n\nA highlight of Mrs. Nice’s term as First Lady was the visit of President Franklin D. Roosevelt to Government House for tea on a stop from his speaking tour through Maryland in the fall of 1938 on behalf of candidates for the U.S. congress. Although Roosevelt and Nice belonged to different political parties, President Roosevelt spent an hour or two with Governor and Mrs. Nice at Government House, during which the two politicians were reported to have had a friendly discussion on a first-name basis. This was not the first gathering of the Nices and Roosevelts, as Governor and Mrs. Nice had been guests of the Roosevelts at the White House shortly after Nice assumed office in January 1935 and had lunched on the presidential yacht Sequoia when President and Mrs. Roosevelt had come to Annapolis that spring to watch the Navy and Harvard rowing races on the Severn River.\n\nOne of Mrs. Nice’s fondest memories was said to have been a dinner party given by friends several years preceding the start of her husband’s governorship during which he paid her the following tribute:\n\n“For nearly twenty years it has been my pleasing and wholesome privilege to have had, as the companion of my heart and soul, one, whose purity of mind and simplicity of love and affection has ever rendered my anticipation sublime. To me, twenty-five years ago, she appeared like a young rapt saint, exuding the faint and intoxicating perfume of pure womanliness; her beauty broke on me like some rare flower; her glory was the glory of the lily; her loveliness was the loveliness of the full blown rose, which so flushed her brow that it radiated the refulgent rays of womanly virtue, unimpeachable character and a heart of gold.\n\n“The years have vanished like snow when comes the thaw. Like the disappearing May snow drifts they have sunk into the past, and have become as shadowy faces, which we see in our dreams, and which pass as petals upon a swift moving stream. All of these virtues she has retained to an emphasized and marked degree. Her caresses, as then, are as soft as the down of the turtle dove; her love still falls about, and on me, like a sweet rain; something divine seems to cling around her like a sweet, subtle vapor which steals lingering on the placid bosom of a beautiful lake. Her loyal, loving presence has ever been my beacon; guiding and strengthening me in the dark hours of sorrow, filling me with joy and happiness in my moments of prosperity, ever, and always, my incentive to better things. The poverty of my language forbids an attempt at expression of my real love, gratitude, and respect. I can only say I love her; she is my heartease, my life with her has been sweeter than the honey in the honey-comb; her voice is like sweet music; her face like unto the angels; her eyes flashing with sunbeams, smiling a divine delight into my soul; and until death shall claim me as her very own, I pledge her unabated, undying love, fidelity and respect.\n\nMay the gathering glory of her life shine like the dawn; may her days be as long and as happy as the waves that dance on the sea; may her patient, sweet disposition ever fill my weary hours, shining upon me with the brilliance of the stars always unutterably bright, as they move like silver barques upon the azure sea of heaven, may it fall upon me like a ray of light from a heaven of peace.\n\n“Surrounded by you, my friends, I welcome this opportunity to thus publicly pay tribute to My Love, and before presenting this intrinsic evidence of my affection, I ask you to join me in drinking to the health of her, whose holy love has like some vestal flame, burned into my soul and left its indelible impress upon my heart—to my wife.”\n\nPortrait of Mary Byrnes O’Conor\n\n•Artist: Stanislav Rembski (1896-1998)\n\n•Title: Mary Byrnes O’Conor (1896-1971)\n\n•Date: 1961\n\n•Medium: Oil on Canvas\n\n•Dimensions: 40 × 32\"\n\n•Accession Number: MSA SC 1545-1204\n\nEugenia Byrnes O’Conor (1896-1971)\n\nMSA SC 3520-2289\n\nFirst Lady of Maryland, 1939-1947\n\n•Born: December 24, 1896 in Baltimore, Maryland\n\n•Mother: Catherine Hawkins Byrnes\n\n•Father: James Byrnes\n\n•Byrnes Family Home: Baltimore, Maryland\n\n•Marriage: November 24, 1920 to Governor Herbert R. O’Conor\n\n•Children: Herbert, Jr., Eugene, Mary Patricia, James, Robert\n\n•Died: October 11, 1971 in Baltimore, Maryland\n\n•Burial: Cathedral Cemetery, Baltimore, Maryland\n\nMary Eugenia Byrnes O’Conor was the wife of Herbert R. O’Conor, the fifty-first governor of Maryland serving in office from 1939-1947. Known as Eugenia, she met Herbert in the spring of 1911 at St. John’s Catholic Church in Baltimore when she was only twelve and he just fourteen years old. Herbert and Eugenia maintained their friendship throughout their teens and through Herbert’s term in the Navy Reserves during the last stages of World War I. The two became active members of the Loyola Club, a Catholic social club for young singles that held dances, performed plays and sponsored musical events. Herbert graduated from the University of Maryland Law School in June, 1920, and although his parents would have preferred that he was better established in his law career before getting married, Herbert and Eugenia set the date for November 24, 1920, and the two were married at St. Philip and St. James Church in Baltimore. The O’Conors would eventually have five children: Herbert, Jr., Eugene, Mary (O’Conor) Farley, James, and Robert.\n\nDuring her eight-year tenure as First Lady of Maryland, Mrs. O’Conor led an active home life as a mother while maintaining a full schedule in her capacity as wife of Maryland’s governor. At the beginning of the first O’Conor administration in 1939, the five children ranged in age from sixteen to three. Four of the children attended school in Baltimore, and Mrs. O’Conor spent a lot of time driving them back and forth between Baltimore and Annapolis. At the same time, she held at least two series’ of receptions at Government House that were open to the public, and was active in the Democratic Women’s Clubs of Annapolis and Baltimore, hosting members of the clubs for tea at Government House. In 1943, Mrs. O’Conor served as one of the hostesses for the “President’s Ball” in Annapolis, the proceeds of which went to fund polio research. The O’Conors continued the tradition of holding formal receptions for members of the General Assembly and their friends at Government House, attended by more than 1,000 people at a time. They hosted Naval Academy officials for dinner at the house and held several fund-raising events in the house to support such causes as improvements to the local hospital and to the new Ritchie Highway.\n\nThe O’Conor administration paralleled the war in Europe and America’s entry into World War II. Mrs. O’Conor supported the war effort by donating blood and by serving as a patron along with her husband for fund-raisers for the benefit of the National War Fund and for general war relief. The O’Conors also held a special reception at Government House for servicemen stationed at Fort Meade.\n\nAs First Lady of Maryland, Mrs. O’Conor became “noted for her skills as a hostess, entertaining a wide variety of diplomats and royalty in Government House” including the royal family of Luxembourg, the exiled president of Lithuania, the Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark, British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden, and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. In June, 1939, the O’Conors attended a garden party given at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C. by King George and Queen Elizabeth of England. The O’Conors occasionally attended events in Washington, D.C. such as teas and luncheons with congressmen and cabinet members of the Roosevelt administration and their families. In May, 1940, Eugenia was a guest along with Herbert and a few others at the Maryland home of Under-Secretary of State Sumner Welles, where she enjoyed a friendly chat with President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In spite of her full social calendar and her active work on behalf of public causes, her oldest son Herbert O’Conor, Jr. remarked upon her death in October, 1971 that “her favorite place was at home, close to her family.”\n\nPortrait of Dorothy Byron Lane\n\n•Artist: Stanislav Rembski (1896-1998)\n\n•Title: Dorothy Byron Lane (1897-1993)\n\n•Date: 1961\n\n•Medium: Oil on Canvas\n\n•Dimensions: 40 × 32\"\n\n•Accession Number: MSA SC 1545-1184\n\nDorothy Byron Lane (1896-1993)\n\nMSA SC 3520-2290\n\nFirst Lady of Maryland, 1947-1951\n\n•Born: August 9, 1896 in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania\n\n•Mother: Virginia Brewer Byron\n\n•Father: Lewis T. Byron\n\n•Byron Family Home: Mercersburg, Pennsylvania and Hagerstown, Maryland\n\n•Marriage: January 17, 1922 to William Preston Lane, Jr.\n\n•Children: Dorothy Lane Campbell, Jean Lane Goddard\n\n•Lane Family Home: Hagerstown, Maryland\n\n•Died: January 29, 1993 in Hagerstown, Maryland\n\nDorothy Byron, daughter of Lewis T. and Virginia Brewer Byron, was born in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania in 1896. When she was two years old, the family moved to Hagerstown, Maryland where they lived across the street from the Lane family. William Preston (“Pres”) Lane, Jr. was four years her senior, and the two married on January 17, 1922. The house they purchased in 1925 in Hagerstown served as their permanent residence for all but their four years in Annapolis. The couple had two daughters, Dorothy and Jean.\n\nAs First Lady of Maryland, Mrs. Lane made few changes to Government House. She was an avid gardener and her daily routine included placing fresh flowers in the various rooms in order to add her own personal touch to the house. Her other interests included playing golf as well as attending operas and symphonies. She was a member of the Hagerstown Garden Club, Arts and Letters Club, and Women’s Club.\n\nKnown as “shy” and “self-effacing,” and described as “uncomfortable in public,” Mrs. Lane nevertheless campaigned with her husband and invited visitors to Government House during her tenure as First Lady. “I really love to receive groups here, particularly groups of children,” reported Mrs. Lane. “It’s an impressive and historic house, and I think it makes an impression on children.”\n\nIn 1947 a controversy arose around Mrs. Lane when rumors began circulating that she was personally benefiting from the state sales tax that her husband had supported and had pushed through the legislature. “It’s very disheartening when you are so careful with expenditures to hear the rumor that the sales tax paid for your daughter’s wedding,” she said. Her older daughter Dorothy reported that, “Mother is a worrier and terribly conscientious. She really takes her job seriously, and I know she’s often hurt by the rough and tumble of politics.” Mrs. Lane proved to be fiscally conservative, however, and reported at the end of her tenure as First Lady that she had saved enough money from the housekeeping allowance to buy an eighteenth-century portrait of Horatio Sharpe (Governor of Maryland from 1753 to 1769) and his family from the Vose Galleries in Boston. The portrait was presented to the state in 1951 and now hangs in the Government House dining room.\n\nIn 1973 Mrs. Lane cut the ribbon opening the second span of the William Preston Lane, Jr. Memorial Bridge across the Chesapeake Bay, named after her husband following his death in 1967. Her later years were spent quietly in her Hagerstown home that she had once shared with her husband. It was there that she died in 1993 at the age of ninety-six.\n\nPortrait of Honolulu Claire Manzer McKeldin\n\n•Artist: Stanislav Rembski (1896-1998)\n\n•Title: Honolulu McKeldin (1900-1988)\n\n•Date: 1961\n\n•Medium: Oil on Canvas\n\n•Dimensions: 40 × 32\"\n\n•Accession Number: MSA SC 1545-1188\n\nHonolulu Claire Manzer McKeldin (1900-1988)\n\nMSA SC 3520-2291\n\nFirst Lady of Maryland, 1951-1959\n\n•Born: January 26, 1900 in Sidney Center, New York\n\n•Mother: Maud F. Manzer\n\n•Father: Merton G. Manzer\n\n•Siblings: Janet and Helen Manzer\n\n•Manzer Family Home: Sidney Center, New York and Baltimore, Maryland\n\n•Religious Affiliation: Episcopal Church of the Redeemer\n\n•Marriage: October 17, 1924 to Governor Theodore R. McKeldin\n\n•Children: Theodore, Jr. and Clara Whitney Ziegler\n\n•McKeldin Family Home: 203 Paddington Rd., Homeland\n\n•Died: August 8, 1988 in Homeland, Maryland\n\n•Burial: Greenmount Cemtery, Baltimore, Maryland\n\nHonolulu Claire Manzer McKeldin was the wife of Theodore R. McKeldin (1900-1974), the fifty-third governor of Maryland, serving in office from 1951-1959. She was born in Binghamton, New York and graduated from the Maryland Institute in Costume Design. Mrs. McKeldin met her future husband while they were both working in a bank in Baltimore. They were married on October 17, 1924, during his last year in law school. They settled into an unassuming home in a quiet area of Baltimore, where they lived for most of their married lives. The McKeldins had two children, Theodore R. McKeldin, Jr., and Clara Whitney (McKeldin) Zeigler.\n\nDuring her husband’s term as Mayor of Baltimore from 1943-1947, Mrs. McKeldin served as a nutritionist for the Red Cross and worked regularly in the annual Flower Mart of the Women’s Civic League. A prize-winning gardener, she also enjoyed drawing and painting still lifes and landscapes.\n\nUpon becoming First Lady of Maryland in 1951, Mrs. McKeldin asserted in an interview with The Evening Capital that she while she anticipated an enjoyable tenure in Annapolis, she planned to avoid the “public eye” and focus her energies on her home and family (Teddy was 14 and Clara 11 when the family moved into Government House). “When your husband is in politics,” she said, “I think it’s just as well for the wife to keep in the background and let him do all the talking. That way she can’t make any mistakes for him.”\n\nOne would not have guessed, however, that this was her intention judging by the list of activities with which Mrs. McKeldin became involved while in Annapolis. She was an honorary member of the Naval Academy Women’s Club and frequently attended its meetings; on one such occasion she received First Lady Mamie Eisenhower when she made the trip from Washington, D.C. to Annapolis in order to address the members of the Club. Mrs. McKeldin’s other memberships included the Women’s Division of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, the Women’s Auxiliary to the Salvation Army, the Women’s Civic League of Baltimore, the Women’s Auxiliary to Anne Arundel General Hospital, the Empty Stocking Club, the Free Arts Club, and the Homeland Garden Club, where she served as treasurer.\n\nIn April, 1952, Governor and Mrs. McKeldin took a month-long trip to Europe and the Middle East in which they combined business with pleasure. During that trip, the McKeldins lunched with General and Mrs. Eisenhower at their villa outside Paris, met Pope Pius XII in Rome and spent Easter in Jerusalem. While in Israel, the McKeldins took a day trip to the mines at Elath, near the Red Sea. In order to get there, they had to endure a bumpy jeep ride over twenty-five miles of sand, which Mrs. McKeldin weathered while dressed for a tea planned for later that day, holding on to her hat and trying not to bounce out of the jeep. “Now I’ve seen everything,” declared Mrs. McKeldin to The Evening Capital upon her return to Annapolis.\n\nAnother highlight of Mrs. McKeldin’s term as First Lady of Maryland was the visit to Annapolis on November 8, 1954 of Queen Elizabeth of England, the Queen Mother. The McKeldins escorted the Queen Mother in a tour of colonial Annapolis that included the State House, St. Anne’s Church, and the Naval Academy. Local schools closed early to permit schoolchildren to join the thousands of Annapolitans who lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the Queen Mother as she and the McKeldins greeted the crowds. The McKeldins then enjoyed traditional Maryland fare at a luncheon with the queen and her entourage in Government House.\n\nA collector of old jewelry and antiques, Mrs. McKeldin enjoyed attending antique shows with her husband. As First Lady, Mrs. McKeldin acquired several pieces of silver for Government House, including a tea and coffee service currently displayed in the State Dining Room.\n\nPortrait of Helen Avalynne Gibson Tawes\n\n•Artist: Stanislav Rembski (1896-1998)\n\n•Title: Helen Avalynne Gibson Tawes (1898-1989)\n\n•Date: 1961\n\n•Medium: Oil on Canvas\n\n•Dimensions: 40 × 32\"\n\n•Accession Number: MSA SC 1545-1217\n\nHelen Avalynne Gibson Tawes (1898-1989)\n\nMSA SC 3520-2292\n\nFirst Lady of Maryland, 1959-1967\n\n•Born: October 9, 1898\n\n•Gibson Family Home: Crisfield, Maryland\n\n•Religious Affiliation: Ashbury United Methodist Church, Crisfield\n\n•Marriage: December 25, 1915 to Governor J. Millard Tawes in Fruitland\n\n•Children: Philip W. and Jimmie Lee\n\n•Died: July 17, 1989\n\n•Burial Place: Sunny Ridge Memorial Park, Crisfield, Maryland\n\nHelen Avalynne Gibson, daughter of Minerva Amerinth and Oliver P. Gibson, was born in Crisfield, Maryland on October 9, 1898. The last of nine children, she became known as “Lou” to her closest companions and as “Miss Avalynne” to many other admirers. As a young girl, Helen studied piano and voice at the Peabody Institute. Although she lived the majority of her life in Crisfield, her years as a student at the Peabody were spent with her family in Mt. Washington, Baltimore. During her education, she was asked to showcase her musical talents by performing live on a Salisbury radio program. Helen continued her interest in music throughout her life, and was often found at her electric organ when the first family was entertaining at Government House during the Tawes administration. She also was a longstanding member the choir of Crisfield’s Asbury Methodist Church. In addition to her personal artistic endeavors, Mrs. Tawes was also an active patron of local cultural programs. She was a member of the Baltimore Opera Guild as well as the Women’s Symphony Organization, the Baltimore Music Club, and the Women’s Organization of the Salvation Army. When she was in Baltimore she enjoyed attending the concerts of the Baltimore Symphony, and invited friends from Annapolis and Baltimore to share the Governor’s box with her.\n\nAt the age of sixteen, Helen met J. Millard Tawes on a hayride. He was the twenty-year-old son of Alice Byrd and James B. Tawes of Crisfield. The two were married about a year later on Christmas Day, 1915, in a secret ceremony at a Methodist Church in Fruitland; they eloped because they believed that their parents would not approve of her marrying at the young age of seventeen. The two lived apart at their parents’ homes for two weeks before Helen’s older sister Oneida discovered the marriage license in a drawer and told everyone about it. Years later, Helen described the elopement as “the most romantic thing I ever did in my life.” Millard and Helen had two children, daughter Jimmie Lee and son Philip Wesley. The family lived in Crisfield in a house that Millard built right next door to his parent’s home. The Tawes lived in this home for their entire married lives, except for the years spent in Annapolis during Governor Tawes’ administration.\n\nMillard Tawes’ political career began in the 1930s when he was elected Clerk of the Somerset County Circuit Court. He later became State Comptroller as well as a State Banking Commissioner. He won the governorship of Maryland in 1958, an office which he held for eight years. Mrs. Tawes had been an enthusiastic participant in Millard’s campaign for governor, handing out a pamphlet of her favorite Maryland recipes along with the campaign literature. Later expanded into a best-selling cookbook entitled My Favorite Maryland Recipes, the recipe collection revealed her family secrets for preparing traditional Maryland delicacies such as blue crabs, terrapin, and oysters. In addition to the recipes, she also shared her personal cooking philosophies which included using simple seasonings in order to prevent overpowering the true taste of the dish and always shucking your own oysters to make sure the shell is removed properly.\n\nMrs. Tawes’ recipes became famous outside the boundaries of the state after being served in the Maryland Pavilion at the 1964 World’s Fair in New York. Among the dishes offered was her fast food version of a crab cake, called a “crab-burger.” Her cooking abilities apparently became world renowned, since she personally took over Government House’s kitchen in order to cook a special crock of terrapin soup to send to Sir Winston Churchill in London for which England’s former Prime Minister sent a grateful letter of appreciation. Mrs. Tawes’ efforts to popularize Maryland cuisine culminated in 1964 when the House of Delegates drafted a resolution to recognize her success and to commend her for promoting Maryland as “the land of fine food.”\n\nIn addition to her culinary pursuits, Mrs. Tawes also worked to make a positive difference in public affairs. She worked with former First Lady Lady Bird Johnson on the Head Start program. She joined with the Maryland Federation of Women’s Clubs to educate the public on civil defense home preparedness, receiving the club’s Home Preparedness Award for her efforts to use Government House as a model for safe homes across the state. She secured the approval of the legislature to hang portraits of former first ladies in Government House, and began the publication of a pamphlet on the history of the House.\n\nTawes also shared her husband’s avid interest in environmental conservation. During his administration, Governor Tawes not only made Assateague Island a national park, but also doubled the area of land covered by the state parks system. Reflecting Mrs. Tawes interest in educating the public about the rich diversity of Maryland, in 1975 she broke ground on a six-acre garden, named in her honor, at the Tawes State Office Building in Annapolis. This garden was designed cooperatively by the Federated Garden Clubs of Maryland, the Department of Natural Resources, and the Department of General Services, to showcase the harmony inherent in the various state landscapes including the mountains of the West and the beaches of the Eastern Shore.\n\nPerhaps Mrs. Tawes is most noteworthy, especially in the context of this study, because of her own personal interest in Maryland’s First Ladies. In an interview with the local press, Mrs. Tawes remarked that “a governor’s wife comes here and she works like a dog. I just feel that they get so little credit, some recognition would be nice.” To remedy what she felt was a glaring omission in the state’s history, during her tenure at Government House, she commissioned official portraits of the last five women to occupy the post. In addition to the portrait of herself, Mrs. Tawes hired Baltimore artist Stanislav Rembski to paint Honolulu McKeldin, Dorothy Lane, Eugenia O’Conor, and the late Edna Viola Amos Nice Zinn. The Maryland General Assembly granted Mrs. Tawes ten thousand dollars from the state’s general emergency fund to complete the paintings. With these portraits, Mrs. Tawes not only succeeded in preserving the images of five First Ladies, but she also elevated their position as a whole. Due to her efforts, it is now customary for the First Lady or Official Hostess to have an official portrait made, just like the governor. Inspired by Mrs. Tawes’ sentiments, current First Lady Frances Hughes Glendening, with the assistance of the Maryland State Archives, created an exhibit of the thirteen First Ladies’ portraits from the state’s collection. These portraits now adorn the walls of Government House, and the Archives is seeking out other paintings to complete the collection.\n\nAfter their tenure in Annapolis, the Tawes family moved back to their Crisfield home. Both Mr. and Mrs. Tawes remained active and visible members of their community. Mr. Tawes continued serving in the state government in the Department of Natural Resources and after his retirement continued to work two or three days a week in an office in Crisfield. After his death in 1979, Mrs. Tawes remained a widow and continued to live in their Crisfield home until her death at the age of ninety on July 17, 1989."
