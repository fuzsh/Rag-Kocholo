This was disputed by Isabelle Cota, and her descendants who contend that previous to the marriage of Louis Gurnoe and Archange Cadotte in 1820, Gurnoe had taken unto himself a lawful wife in the person of Angelique Defoe and that his children by her, to- wit: Isabella Cota, Frank, Louis and Joseph Gurnoe are his legal heirs. Many interesting features arose during the progress of the trial, as, in attempting to prove the marriage of Gurnoe and Angelique Defoe 1809, the marriage ceremonies as performed by the Indians, and by contract with witnesses in the early days of the Sault were pretty thoroughly described by witnesses, some of them so far removed from youth that their own ages had been long since forgotten.
