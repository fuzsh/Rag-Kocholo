In a statement, Mr. Glendening, who is 59, said, ''We wish each other well and each remain dedicated to careers in public service.'' Mr. Glendening, a Democrat, has been separated from his 50-year-old wife, a lawyer for the Federal Election Commission, since July 2000. In August, The Washington Post reported that the governor was involved with one of his aides. Gary Gately (NYT)"
