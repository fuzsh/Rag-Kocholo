        "text": "The portrait gallery showcases many of the photographs and portraits of the Cahoon family and other early Bay Village residents.\n\nIn the Victorian era, technology was going through rapid developments, including the new process of photography. With the introduction of albumen prints, photography and portraiture was now cheap enough to become commercially available to the middle class. Instead of spending time and money to sit for an artist to paint a single portrait of their loved ones, families could now take a short afternoon trip to one of many photography studios.\n\nCleveland had many studios during this time, including the “Studio of Photographie, M. M. Udell,” at 11 & 13 Euclid Avenue. The back of one of their cabinet cards, pictured here, features an ornate advertisement for the studio. The portraits of the Cahoon brothers are some examples of cabinet cards (Frame #25).\n\nPhotography had also progressed far enough that cameras could be taken outside of the studio. In fact, a photographer could come out to document important events such as wedding anniversaries and family reunions. Rose Hill’s portrait gallery showcases many of these photographs, such as Joel and Margaret Cahoon’s golden wedding anniversary in 1881 (Frame #10).\n\nBesides photographs, other types of portraits are seen here. Before commercially available photography a few early Dover residents sat for more traditional portraits such as Joel and Margaret Cahoon when they were a young couple (Frames #5 and #6). Large hand-drawn crayon copies of photographic portraits are also on display, likely made so that the portraits could be framed and hung on the walls rather than kept in a photo album.\n\nPortrait Gallery Key: To read about a particular portrait or photograph, click on the frame number and title below. Or start from the beginning with Emma Hackett Cahoon’s portrait.\n\nFrame #1: Emmeline “Emma” Hackett Cahoon\n\nb. 1808\n\nd. 1876, Elyria, Ohio\n\nEmeline “Emma” Hackett Cahoon was born in 1808. She married Benjamin Cahoon on December 1, 1835. They had at least eight children together. Their daughters can be seen in a group portrait at Rose Hill in frames #8 and #22. She was described by Ida Cahoon, in her book History of the Cahoon Family, as “…a most excellent wife and model mother.” Emma lived to be 68 years old and is buried in Ridgelawn Cemetery, Elyria, Ohio.\n\nFrame #2: Joel Butler Cahoon\n\nJoel Butler Cahoon, along with his family, were the first settlers of Bay Village. He sat for a few different portraits over the years. This portrait was painted in his old age, after he had let his beard grow long. To read more about Joel and view a portrait of him as a young man, go to frame #5.\n\nFrame #3: Benjamin Reynolds Cahoon\n\nb. 14 July 1805, Montgomery County, New York\n\nd. 29 Sept. 1872, Elyria, Ohio\n\nBenjamin Reynolds Cahoon was the eighth child of Joseph and Lydia Cahoon and came with the family to Dover in 1810. Benjamin worked as a stone cutter in Cincinnati and Elyria. He married Emeline Hackett on December 1, 1835. They had at least eight children together. Benjamin and Emma’s daughters can be seen in a group portrait at Rose Hill in frames #8 and #22.\n\nAccording to Ida Cahoon, in her book History of the Cahoon Family, “…Uncle Benjamin was very fond of flowers, fruits and all the beautiful objects he could have about him and was excellent company among his many friends.” Benjamin passed away at the age of 67. He is buried in Ridgelawn Cemetery, Elyria, Ohio.\n\nFrame #4: Lydia, Laura, and Ida Cahoon\n\nLydia, Laura, and Ida Cahoon pose with a book for a studio portrait. It was likely taken sometime after 1903, when their sister, Martha, passed away. It appears to be a part of a series of photographs taken at one session. Another photograph from this session is Lydia’s portrait in frame #7 where she is seen reading the same book, likely a prop provided by the studio. Read more about the sisters here.\n\nFrame #5: Joel Butler Cahoon\n\nb. 27 Aug. 1793, Salisbury, New York\n\nd. 28 Sept. 1882, Rose Hill, Dover Township, Ohio\n\nJoel Butler Cahoon was the third son of Joseph and Lydia Cahoon. He moved to Dover with his parents and siblings in 1810. Joel and his brother Daniel started a contracting business building public works such as canals, aqueducts, viaducts, and railroads in Ohio, Indiana, and Maryland.\n\nWhile in Maryland he married Margaret Van Allen Dickson on July 14, 1831. They would move into Rose Hill in 1842. In 1881, they celebrated their golden anniversary. A photo was taken of the couple with the many guests who visited them at Rose Hill for the occasion. Joel passed away the next year at the age of 89 and is buried in Lakeside Cemetery.\n\nHe likely sat for this portrait soon after his marriage to Margaret. You can view other portraits of him in frames #2 and #26.\n\nFrame #6: Margaret Van Allen Dickson Cahoon\n\nb. 8 Feb. 1810, Washington D. C.\n\nd. 21 June 1894, Cleveland, Ohio\n\nMargaret Van Allen Dickson Cahoon married John Douglas Van Allen on August 16, 1827, who passed away two years later in March 1829. She met Joel in Maryland in 1830 while staying with an aunt. They married a year later and had eleven children together, eventually settling at Rose Hill. In 1881, they celebrated their golden anniversary. A photo was taken of the couple with the many guests who visited them at Rose Hill for the occasion. Margaret passed away at the age of 84, outliving her husband and all but six of her children. She is buried in Lakeside Cemetery.\n\nFrame #7: Lydia Elizabeth Cahoon\n\nLydia poses here with a book for a photography session with her two surviving sisters, Laura and Ida. Another photograph from this session is a portrait of the three sisters reading the same book in frame #4. Read more about Lydia here.\n\nFrame #8: Children of Benjamin Cahoon and Joel Cahoon\n\nThe daughters of Benjamin Cahoon (back row) pose with the children of Joel Cahoon (front row) at Rose Hill. The Cahoon Barn (now the Community Center) can be seen in the distance. This group portrait was likely taken at the Cahoon reunion seen in frame #22. Of Joel’s children, only the four sisters and Thomas are seen, placing the photograph between 1899, when John Marshall Cahoon passed, and 1903, when Martha Cahoon (far left) passed. Scroll down to read about Benjamin’s daughters, visit frame #17 to read about Joel’s daughters, and visit frame #25 to read about Thomas.\n\nDaughters of Benjamin Cahoon, back row, left to right: Helen Bullock, Abigail Schneerer, Jeanette Cahoon, and Minerva Hollenbach.\n\nChildren of Joel Cahoon, front row, left to right: Martha Cahoon, Lydia Cahoon, Thomas Cahoon, Ida Cahoon, and Laura Cahoon.\n\nBenjamin Reynold Cahoon’s Daughters\n\nHelen Cahoon Bullock\n\nb. 24 Dec. 1836, Elyria, Ohio\n\nd. 19 July 1924, Elyria, Ohio\n\nHelen was the second child of Benjamin and Emma Cahoon. She married Aaron H. Bullock in 1870. They lived in Elyria. Helen lived to be 88 years old and is buried in Ridgelawn Cemetery.\n\nAbigail Frances Cahoon Schneerer\n\nb. 7 Aug. 1852, Elyria, Ohio\n\nd. 13 Aug. 1925, Norwalk, Ohio\n\nAbigail was the eighth child of Benjamin and Emma Cahoon. She married Dr. Frederick W. Schneerer, a Union soldier. She passed away at the age of 73 and is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery, Norwalk, Ohio.\n\nJeanette Rebecca Cahoon\n\nb. 26 Jan. 1842\n\nd. 18 Dec. 1902, Elyria, Ohio\n\nJeanette was the sixth child of Benjamin and Emma Cahoon. She never married. Jeanette lived with her cousin, Thomas Cahoon, and his wife, Elizabeth, in Cleveland. She lived to be 59 years old.\n\nMinerva Cahoon Hollenbach\n\nb. 1 Mar. 1838\n\nd. 1 Dec. 1915, Cuyahoga County, Ohio\n\nMinerva was the fourth child of Benjamin and Emma Cahoon. She married Reuben Hollenbach on September 17, 1863 in Lorain County. They lived in Cleveland. She lived to be 77 years old.\n\nFrame #9: Rebecca Cahoon Griffith\n\nb. 1798, Salisbury, New York\n\nd. 1859\n\nRebecca Cahoon was the sixth child of Joseph and Lydia Cahoon. She came to Dover with her parents when she was twelve years old. She married Jacob Heath on November 16, 1823. The couple had two children, Silicia Heath and Franklin Heath. However, the marriage didn’t last and they divorced. On November 14, 1850, Rebecca married Ebenezer Griffith. Her daughter’s son, Walter Wright, became the Cahoon family’s lawyer and processed the will that set up Rose Hill as a museum. Walter and his family can be seen at the Cahoon family reunion in frame #22 and their daughter, Margaret Wright Glendenning’s portrait is in frame #16.\n\nFrame #10: 1881 Golden Wedding Anniversary\n\nThe Cahoon family gathered at Rose Hill for Joel and Margaret’s golden wedding anniversary on July 14, 1881. In Margaret’s autobiography, she estimates there were 150 guests present. She describes how, that morning, she and Joel exchanged rings engraved with their initials and date of their anniversary. A photograph was taken that day of all the guests. Her children can be seen in the front row, sitting from youngest to oldest.\n\nFrame #11: Leverett Judson Cahoon\n\nThis portrait of Leverett Judson Cahoon is a carte de visite or calling card print. This type of photographic portraiture was popular between 1859 to the early 1870s.\n\nA four lensed camera could take eight negatives on a single glass pane. The resulting print would be cut into eight individual portraits and pasted to cards. With eight copies automatically made per session, carte de visite prints could be used similarly to calling cards and exchanged socially. They were mailed, given at holidays and birthdays as small gifts, and collected in albums.\n\nHowever, in the 1870s the carte de visite cards began to be replaced by the larger cabinet cards as technology improved. Large prints were no longer as labor intensive and expensive as they had been. People jumped on the chance to have larger, more detailed photographs of their family and friends.\n\nThis carte de visite portrait of Leverett was likely taken in the 1860s. The back is decorated with the studio’s name, Ryder’s, which was located at 239 Superior Street, Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nTo learn more about Leverett go to frame #25.\n\nFrame #12: Henry C. Wischmeyer, Jr.\n\nb. 27 Sept. 1872, Dover Township, Ohio\n\nd. 4 July 1959, Bay Village, Ohio\n\nHenry C. Wischmeyer, Jr. was the fifth child of Henry Wischmeyer, Sr. and Regina Rentschler Wischmeyer. He worked with his father raising grapes. The family had a winery and lakefront hotel on Lake Road near Glen Park Drive. This was likely where Henry gained an understanding of many types of boats, inspiring him to build and design model boats. Blueprints of his boats are at Osborn Learning Center and many of his completed models are displayed in the basement of Rose Hill. Henry lived to be 87 years old and is buried in Lakeside Cemetery.\n\nHis portrait and his sister’s are both opaque watercolor over a photographic print. The artist is unknown.\n\nFrame #13: Olga Wilhemine Wischmeyer\n\nb. 19 Feb. 1869, Dover Township, Ohio\n\nd. 27 Mar. 1948, Village of Bay, Ohio\n\nOlga Wilhemine Wischmeyer was the fourth child of Henry Wischmeyer, Sr. and Regina Rentschler Wischmeyer. She worked at her father’s hotel as a cook and was a member of the Library and Museum Committee for the City of Bay Village. She never married.

This photograph of Joel Cahoon was enlarged by John Kavanagh of Cleveland in 1881. He studied at the National Academy of Design in New York, studied genre painting in Munich, and studied at the Académie Julian in Paris. In Cleveland he became well known for his portraiture, specifically in crayon as seen here. Kavanagh also painted landscapes, including one of Rose Hill which hangs in the 1818 parlor. In 1889, he became the director of the Art Club in Cleveland, teaching portraiture and figure painting. He passed away in 1898.\n\nTo read more about Joel Cahoon, visit frame #5.\n\nFrame #27: John Marshall Cahoon\n\nThis photograph of John Marshall Cahoon served as the reference for a crayon enlargement by an unknown artist. The enlargement process began with the sun. A camera with an angled mirror captured the sunlight and directed it through the photo negative and an enlarging lens onto a piece of treated paper. This took several hours, and the mirror had to constantly be adjusted to account for the sun’s movement. Between this and any inherent flaws in the image now seen at a much larger scale, they almost always had to be retouched and enhanced using crayons and paint. A skilled artist could maintain the original photograph’s realism, providing a portrait that was worthy of framing and hanging on the wall.\n\nTo learn more about John Marshall Cahoon go to frame #25.\n\nFrame #28: Martha Washington Cahoon\n\nThis portrait of Martha Washington Cahoon was done by an unknown artist. It may be a crayon enlargement, although the effect is more painterly than Joel’s or John Marshall’s. To learn more about Martha, visit frame #17.\n\nFrame #29: Lydia Elizabeth Cahoon\n\nThis crayon portrait of Lydia Elizabeth Cahoon is signed “Tanquerey, Brooklyn, N.Y.C.” A positive identification of the artist is difficult, although an ‘A. Tanquerey’ won a Medal of Merit in photographs and crayon portraits in 1890. However, Tanquerey is also associated with a crayon portrait scam. In a 1891 circular for the Tanquerey Portrait Society, signed by an ‘A. Tanquerey,’ a free crayon portrait is advertised. An interested party would send a photograph to be turned into a larger portrait free of charge.\n\nThe deal was too good to be true. After the photograph was sent, the customer would be sent a pamphlet advertising extravagant frames they would have to buy before receiving their original photograph and portrait.
