        "text": "HISTORY OF THE\n\nBADEN VOLUNTEER\n\nFIRE DEPARTMENT & LADIES AUXILIARY\n\nOn January 31, 1955, the first meeting to organize a volunteer fire department for the Brandywine, Baden and Aquasco area was conducted. Mr. Pete Dorsey, President of the Marlboro Volunteer Fire Department presided over the meeting. Joseph N. Ridgely, Jr. was elected as temporary President and Ed Middleton was elected as Secretary. Mr. Harry Taylor, Attorney-at-Law volunteered his legal services. On March 7, 1955, President Ridgely appointed a committee to locate a site for the firehouse. The second and fourth Mondays of each month were announced to be the regular meetings of the fire department.\n\nA financial report on March 28, 1955 showed the following expenses: Seal - $10.00, Incorporation Papers as Brandywine-Aquasco Volunteer Fire Department, Inc. - $30.00, Insurance - $20.00 and the purchase of two used trucks for $2.00 - total expenses were $62.00, leaving $49.00 in the treasury.\n\nOn April 24, 1955, Mr. George Curtis reported that the site committee had selected Baden as the site for the new firehouse.\n\nAt the May 22, 1955, meeting, the following persons were elected to hold operational and administrative positions:\n\nVice President - Richard Hohing\n\nTreasurer - O.B. Willett\n\nCaptain - Bob Molan\n\n1st Lieutenant – J.F. Summers, Jr.\n\n2nd Lieutenant – H. J. Lohman\n\nSergeant – Earl Greenfield\n\nEngineer – W. Teslik\n\nAssistant Engineer – J. Cooke\n\nBoard of Directors – W. Burroughs, W. Jowett, Dr. Seron, W. Thornburg\n\nOn June 22, 1955, Ms. Margaret Carr of Baden presented a deed of land as a donation for the site of the present firehouse that was then known as the Brandywine-Aquasco Volunteer Fire Department, Inc. The Building and Plans Committee reported they were ready to lay the foundation for the building and work began on the construction of a three bay engine room and a large kitchen in the rear of the engine room. The entire construction, including cutting, hauling and milling the lumber was completed by a host of actively involved members too numerous to mention individually.\n\nOn February 13, 1956, specifications were accepted and an order was placed for a new fire truck. Also the first permanent election was held for the department for both administrative and operational positions.\n\nBoard of Directors (15) consisted of:\n\nGeorge Curtis, Sr., Charlie Turner, Raymond Young, Vernon Seron, Wilton Jowett, Ward Burroughs, Robert Dobson, Arthur Jones, Francis Summers, Sr., Willis Thornburg, S. O. Willett, Robert Downing, Willard Beavers and Kenneth Wilson.\n\nThe administrative and line officers were elected as follows:\n\nPresident – Joseph N. Ridgely\n\nVice President – Richard LeVieuz\n\nSecretary – George Gaydos\n\nTreasurer – O.B. Willett\n\nChief – Willard Beavers\n\nAssistant Chief - Bill Wiseman\n\nCaptain – Bob Mollan\n\n1st Lieutenant – John Summers, Jr.\n\n2nd Lieutenant – Harry (Bunky) Lohman\n\nSergeant – Earl Greenfield\n\nEngineer – William Teslik\n\nAssistant Engineer – Jimmy Cooke\n\nThe department, on May 25, 1956, submitted their fire equipment to inspectors from the standards committee of the Prince George’s County Volunteer Firemen’s Association for tests in order to qualify as a running company. The company passed and became a member of the Prince George’s County Volunteer Firemen’s Association.\n\nPresident Ridgely called a meeting on August 29, 1955. It was held in St. Paul’s Church Hall in Baden. Several ladies from the community listened as President Ridgely give a brief history on the organization and development of the fire department. Mr. Guy Baden, chairman of establishing a Ladies Auxiliary, then introduced Mrs. Frances Wintermayer, President of the Ladies Auxiliary of Prince George’s County, who gave a brief outline on the purposes of the Ladies Auxiliary and their achievements. Also present was Mrs. Magdaline Schmidt, Past President, Mrs. Tobin, President of Clinton Ladies Auxiliary, and Mrs. Jean Glaublitz, President of Morningside Ladies Auxiliary. A temporary committee was formed and thus was the beginning of the Ladies Auxiliary. By October 3, 1955, the original by-laws had been written and approved by the 27 members and the first officers were elected:\n\nPresident – Dorothy Aaro\n\nSecretary – Maude Baden\n\nHistorian – Ida Wiseman\n\nIn November 1956, Baden Ladies Auxiliary joined forces with the Prince George’s County Auxiliary and in May 1957, became a member of the Maryland State Ladies Auxiliary.\n\nOn October 21, 1957, a new 1957 Ford 500 GPM pumper, built by Glen D. Culvert Fire Apparatus, was received.\n\nThe department was accepted on November 25, 1957 by the County Rescue Squad and assigned as Squad 22, to go into service on December 16, 1957. This operation was approved by the addition of Captain and Lieutenant of the Rescue Squad by adding to Article 9 of the fire department by-laws.\n\nOn June 9, 1958, a motion was accepted to add a Chaplain to the by-laws. The President appointed Reverend Walter Zabel as the first chaplain to the Brandywine-Aquasco Fire Department and Rescue Squad.\n\nIn September of 1961, the Brandywine-Aquasco name was officially changed to the Baden Volunteer Fire Department, Inc.\n\nOn October 22, 1961, a new Ford 750 GPM pumper was delivered to the Baden Fire Department from the Young Fire Department apparatus Company in Buffalo, New York.\n\nIn 1962, the fire department purchased the acreage adjacent to the firehouse and created the park and playground area. It was used for picnics, ball games, turkey shoots, and training drills by the firemen.\n\nOn November 27, 1963, an order was placed for a new Ford Tanker, which would act as a hydrant on wheels for the area, which is not served by city water supplies.\n\nOn August 9, 1964, the parking areas around the firehouse were asphalted, giving the entire area a look of beauty and decreased maintenance required on a gravel lot. Also, at this time, a decision was made to start drawing up plans to add a social hall to the station. With the appointment of Joe Ridgely as Chairman of the Building Committee and Denny Mandragos, Sr., as Planning Coordinator, work began in December 1964. Volunteer labor and building materials were sought from the community to get the ground excavated and leveled out and was completed in 1965. Building specifications were written, issued for contractor bids and cost estimates ranged from $116,000 to $135,000.\n\nOn March 28, 1966, a new Cadillac ambulance was placed in service for the community, thus retiring the used Pontiac ambulance, which had served us well.\n\nThe addition of the ballroom was completed on August 22, 1966. Named the “Willow Room”, it is enjoyed by the community, and surrounding areas along with numerous government, civic and private organizations, which choose this facility for its accommodations and the excellent service, provided by Baden’s men and women. During emergency situations, tornadoes and other severe weather, the station and hall is offered as a shelter.\n\nThe Department operated as a 100 percent all-volunteer home response service until the year 1970. With the creation of Charter form government in Prince George’s County; the Department began operating as a combination service of volunteer and career Fire Department members.\n\nOn July 10, 1973, the darkest day in our history occurred when we lost three of our members in an ambulance/fire engine collision while responding to a rescue call. This tragedy took the lives of Dennis Mandragos, Mark Van Tassel, and Richard Myers. Dennis had been a volunteer for nearly three (3) years, and was elected as Junior Officer in January 1973. Mark, known to everyone as “HUEY”, joined the department in August 1967. Ricky joined the department in 1972 as soon as he turned 16 and had just completed the 11th grade in high school. Bronze plaques are displayed on the brick columns on the front of the firehouse as a tribute of their supreme sacrifice.\n\nIn August 1980, a new 1,000 GPM Hendrickson pumper, powered by an 871 cu.in., Detroit turbo-charged diesel engine, was custom built to our specifications.\n\nOn November 2, 1980, the Baden Volunteer Fire Department hosted an open house at which time pumper E362 was dedicated to our Ladies Auxiliary. The old E362 was retired and later sold to a volunteer fire company in Wisconsin.\n\nBaden Volunteer Fire Department hosted the 63rd Annual Convention of the Prince George’s County Volunteer Firemen’s Association in September 1985. The Convention book was dedicated to the Ladies Auxiliary.\n\nIn 1989, our department designed and purchased a new 2250 Gallon Tanker with a Mack Cab and Chassis to serve our area. This tanker was built by 4-Guys, Inc. and dedicated to the citizens of the area for which we serve in recognition of their generous contributions.\n\nBaden also began remodeling the area adjacent to the engine room, which provided a bunkroom for the female firefighters, and a larger lounge area for our members.\n\nIn 1989, the department began the process of applying for funds under the Capital Improvement Program (CIP) to renovate the station. This much-needed project would provide apparatus space to house larger apparatus and also provide a more functional and safe work environment for the volunteers as well as career fire fighters and paramedics. The amount of money requested at this time was $850,000. Unfortunately, the project was on hold for many years and it wasn’t until fall of 2009 that Baden unveiled a completely renovated station at a cost of 2.8 million dollars.\n\nAt the annual election of officers for 1990, the department elected Valerie Tarbox to become the first female Deputy Chief in Prince George’s County.\n\nThe department, in 1990, with the financial support of the Ladies Auxiliary, made further advances in providing emergency service with the purchase of a Hurst Tool used for auto extrication and in 1991 purchased heavy rescue air bags to be used in conjunction with the Hurst Tool for lifting capabilities.\n\nFor the second time, Baden Volunteer Fire Department hosted the Annual Convention of the Prince George’s County Volunteer Fire and Rescue Association. The 69th Annual Convention was held in September 1991 and dedicated to Baden’s First President, Joseph Ridgley.\n\nIn 1993, the “Butler” Building was built behind the fire station. The building provided much needed storage plus a work/tool shop for the engineers.\n\nBaden Sports Complex was created in 1994 and dedicated to SMECO for their assistance in providing the lighting on the ball field. Fire departments and community youth leagues for seasonal games, tournaments and various fundraisers share the complex.\n\nWith a $10,000 grant, a Helicopter pad was constructed on the lower end of the department grounds, adjacent to the Sports Complex. The State Police helicopter uses the pad for transporting seriously injured/ill patients to a “shock trauma” hospital.\n\nIn December 2001, major renovation began to the “Willow” Room. The renovation included upgrading the stage area, lighting, round columns, ceilings, flooring and painting.\n\nOn Saturday, October 15, 2005, the department celebrated 50 years. The program highlighted our six (6) Charter Members, Dick Riess, Ernie Riess and John Summers, Jr. of the Fire Department along with Phyllis Cooke-Decker, Dorothy Thornburg and Virginia Stallings of the Ladies Auxiliary. The department saluted long-time treasurer, Donnie Ellis also. Donnie Ellis has served as Treasurer since 1961 and decided to step down as treasurer, but still serves on the Board of Directors and as Assistant Treasurer.\n\nIn July 2008, Baden Volunteer Fire Department elected their first female chief, Wendy Boswell-Baden. Chief Baden is the 2nd female chief elected in Prince George’s County.\n\nAt the end of 2008, the County finished installing three (3) 30,000-gallon water tanks in the rural tier, allowing local firefighters to tap into ten times as much water as the small tankers they had been relying on. Unlike the more suburban areas of southern Prince George’s County, the roughly 68 square mile rural area served by Baden Volunteer Fire Department is not equipped with fire hydrants, which often makes it difficult to fight fires. The location of the three (3) new tanks are Dr. Bowen Road (Aquasco), the second one is opposite Orme School, and the third behind Baden Fire Station.\n\nSadly, in 2009, the Ladies Auxiliary lost Charter Member, Dorothy Thornburg. Mrs. Thornburg served as President in 1961-1962.\n\nBaden Volunteer Fire Department unveiled a renovated station, complete with new facilities, and technology in October 2009. Community members, Prince George’s County Fire Officials, local politicians and special guests attended to celebrate the completion of a $2.8 million station renovation project. The 54 year old station was outfitted with new training facilities, engine bays that allow apparatus to drive through instead of having to back in, and new electrical wiring and water distribution systems, among other things. The project took over 14 months to complete.\n\nOn Saturday, October 31, 2009 the Prince George’s County Volunteer Fire and Rescue Association held their 2009 Tribute Program in the Willow Room. The honorees from Baden Volunteer Fire Department were Dick Riess, Ernie Riess and John F. Summers, Jr., all active Charter Members.\n\nSadly the following year, on April 9, 2010, Charter Member and Hall of Fame recipient, John Francis Summers passed away. Mr. Summers had 54 years of accredited service during which time he held several elected and appointed positions.\n\nFebruary 19, 2011 proved to be the busiest day in the history of the Prince George’s County Fire/Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Department. Now known as “Firestorm 2011”. All stations were engaged and over 600 personnel operated at seven (7) simultaneous major incident scenes, among multiple smaller incidents. Baden Volunteer Fire Department had a 340 acre brush fire at the Chalk Point Power Plant. The day began early that Saturday morning and didn’t end until the next morning. Unfortunately, Baden’s 1964 brush truck was consumed by the fire, but thankfully, no serious injuries.\n\nIn 2011, a decision was made to replace our 1993 Pierce fire engine. A committee was formed and after extensive planning found the department needed a Pumper-Tanker to meet the current and future needs of the community. Close to a year of planning lead to a contract with Redstorm Fire and Rescue Apparatus. On Wednesday, May 15th, 2013, a 2012 Spartan Gladiator built by CustomFire was delivered. Pumper-Tanker 36 has enough equipment and ability to complete all duties of an Engine and a Tanker in one piece of apparatus. It holds 2,500 gallons of water, 50 gallons of class A foam with a 1,500 gallons per minute mid-ship pump. This unit carries 6 firefighting personnel and is the same height and only 2’ longer than our current fire engine. The cost of the Pumper-Tanker was $565,000.\n\nOn August 1, 2015, the Prince George’s County Volunteer Fire and Rescue Association and the Ladies Auxiliary of the Prince George’s County Volunteer Fire and Rescue Association held a Special Tribute to honor the years of dedication and service of four (4) of Baden’s own. Honored were Roy A. “Tony” Hall (50 years), Frank W. Hall (47 years), Robert Eugene “Buddy” Boswell (49 years) and Shirley A. Boswell (39 years). Edward M. Mutchler, (45 years) Brentwood Volunteer Fire Department, and John W. Hoglund, ( 65 years) College Park Volunteer Fire Department were also honorees. The event was held at Baden with approximately 240 in attendance.\n\nThe fire department covers approximately a 68 square mile area; the largest geographic response area in Prince George’s County and serves Brandywine, Aquasco, Croom, Eagle Harbor, Clinton, Marlboro and provides mutual aid service to Hughesville and Waldorf on an as needed basis. The station houses Engine 362, Pumper-Tanker 36, Tanker 36, Ambulance 369 (basic life support) and Brush Unit 36. Not covering the “Willow Room Banquet Hall”, the station is now approximately 10,500 square foot. Annually, the Department provides fire, rescue and emergency medical services in excess of 1000 calls per year. Some 28 personnel trained and certified to a minimum operational level of emergency medical first responders and firefighters provide our services. Our total membership today consists of some 80 plus members providing various duties and services. Two charter members who remain very active today are brothers, Dick and Ernie Riess.\n\nThe Baden Ladies Auxiliary continues to work very diligently year round and provide exceptional banquet services for all occasions. Each year at the Annual Installation/Award banquet, the Auxiliary has presented a generous monetary gift to the fire Department. The Department fully realizes their success stems from the support of the Ladies Auxiliary. Charter Member Phyllis Cooke-Decker remains in the department today.\n\n2015 marked the 60th anniversary of Baden Volunteer Fire Department. The Annual Awards Program was held on October 17, 2015. Highlight of the evening was the unveiling of the new Benjamin “Gene” Walls plague purchased and presented to the firehouse by Valerie Walls-Pullliam.\n\nWith it being the 60th Anniversary, interviews took place prior to the banquet with the three (3) Charter Members, Phyllis Cooke-Decker, Ernie Riess and Dickie Riess to get their “take” on the firehouse then and now.\n\nWhen asked Charter Member, Phyllis Cooke-Decker of her thoughts on 60 years, she said, “I am proud to be a Charter and Lifetime member. She continued, “ from a humble beginning with the first and organization meeting held at St. Paul’s Church Hall, to these large, modern buildings here today, I realize that we have always stayed true to the goal, which was to always meet the needs of this community. Baden has always had the enthusiasm and support of the community to have successful fundraisers, such as dances, dinners, parades, car shows, card parties, and other events that funded the construction of our buildings, purchased our trucks and other needed equipment. But foremost, great thanks has to go to the dedication of the men and women for their “thousands” of hours of volunteer service to the Baden Volunteer Fire Department and Ladies Auxiliary as we celebrate our 60th Anniversary of which I am so thankful to be a part of”.\n\nCharter Member Ernie Riess recalls the day when land in Baden was presented to them to build a firehouse on. The name, he says, on the first building was Brandywine-Aquasco Volunteer Fire Department. Along with the other Charter Members, he also gives credit to the many actively involved members that donated their lumber, their equipment and their time to help construct the building. Charter Member Riess said, in those days you didn’t contract a company, you relied solely on what the volunteers and locals had to offer. Times were rough, he added, but back then, there were fewer rules, less regulations and less government involvement. The “Volunteer” system was a necessity in communities, and young boys waited anxiously to become of age to join and some even making the firehouse their home. Charter Member Riess speaks of the first official fire call on Letcher Road East. The fire, thankfully, was minor, but he can still see the firefighters quickly jumping on the tailboard as the truck was leaving the building. Back in those days, the siren rung three (3) times for a fire call, and (1) time for an ambulance call. As for today he says the Baden Volunteer Fire Department has grown into a facility of which the entire community can take pride in. From the engine room to the Willow Room Banquet Hall, they have seen most of our lives evolve, through the good times and the bad times. Weddings, dances, parties, breakfasts, dinners, family gatherings, and yes sadly funerals, it is here, we come together for support, for joy and to share tears. This is what has made Baden Volunteer Fire Department special for 60 years now.\n\n60 years brings back wonderful memories for Charter Member, Dickie Riess. When asked what he thinks of most often, he is quick to say “his old buddies”. The ones who helped with the entire construction, including cutting, hauling and milling the lumber, lumber that came from neighboring farms. He said the building stood right up against bushes, and how, when a call came in, you had to slowly inch the equipment out in order to see if 381 was clear. Charter Member Riess, also remembers going door to door asking for donations in order to continue working on the building. The community was our saving grace back then, as they are today. He remembers how those first fire vehicles were purchased for mere dollars, but dollars hard to come by. Credit, he says goes to those first few members that gathered together on January 31, 1955 to discuss plans to organize a volunteer fire department in our community. Charter Member Riess recalls the good times held in the engine room, the dances, and the parties. Also he is proud that the annual Red Cross blood drives are a huge part of the community and held at the firehouse. Today, he says, even though we have the latest in equipment and apparatus, plus all the modern technology, nothing will erase the memories of those early days. Charter Member Riess said, Baden was always teased for being plain old “country boys” , but today, he says when I look at this beautiful complex, I think to myself, for being plain old “country boys”, DAMN we did good.\n\nSadly on July 7, 2015, Baden Volunteer Fire Department and Ladies Auxiliary lost Charter Member, Virginia Stallings at age 91. Besides being a dedicated member of the Ladies Auxiliary, Virginia was a staple in Prince George’s County, having worked more than 40 years for the Prince George’s County Gov’t. under several county executives. In 1989, she received the Gladys Noon Spellman Award for her public service from then County Executive Parris Glendening. In 1967, Virginia was one of the founders of the Prince George’s Community Federal Credit Union. She served on the Board of Directors for more than 40 years, and in 2014 their Bowie Office was dedicated to Virginia. She was always working for the well-being of the community.\n\nEven as Virgina laid in pain, knowing her time was near, when told what an extraordinary woman she was, and how much she had did for others, she replied “thank you”, then after a pause she said “maybe I should of did more”. Now that’s a true Volunteer, one Baden was blessed with and one that will be missed by many.\n\nOn February 21, 2017, Phillip Higgins Carr passed away. In addition to being President and Chief of Baden Volunteer Fire Department, Phil was Charter Commissioner of Prince George’s County Volunteer Fire Association.\n\nSadly on April 8, 2020, we lost Charter member, Phyllis May Cooke-Decker. Phyllis worked on many fundraisers to help build the first fire department building in the Baden neighborhood. At age 95, she still continued to help."
