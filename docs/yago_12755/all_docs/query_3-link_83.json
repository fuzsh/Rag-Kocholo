Whittet and SheppersonRichmond, Virginia\n\nPreface\n\nIn his challenging book, “American Heroes and Hero-Worship,” by Gerald W. Johnson, the distinguished American author and former North Carolinian says:\n\n“Nothing changes more constantly than the past; for the past that influences our lives . . . . does not consist of what actually happened, but of what men believed happened. It is not upon the event that we act, but upon our belief about that event.”\n\nIn this booklet, “Our Church—Then and Now,” we have tried to discover some of the major events in our Church history and relate those events to the lives of members who lived during a particular era.\n\nIn attempting to meet this goal, we realize how correct was Mr. Johnson in his statement that the history of events is in reality the story of what people believed happened.\n\nIt is to be expected that older generations of our Church may differ as to the when, what, why and how of events. Vague and incomplete Church records make accurate research a difficult task. Memories also dim as years come and go.\n\nYet, in mid-century where events have happened before our very eyes, there is also a difference of opinion about the circumstances surrounding events.\n\nNevertheless, it is our belief that the history of the Seaboard Methodist Church as related within these pages is basically factual. Furthermore, we believe this booklet will stimulate our Church officials and its members to keep more accurate records as well as more personal history of their families. Emerson, the great American essayist, once said: “There is properly no history, only biography.”\n\nIt is therefore with grateful hearts and deep appreciation that we thank the members of our Church, and members of the Baptist Church as well, who labored so long and so hard to help make our dream of a Church history a reality.\n\nSteering Committee\n\nMRS.

To him his community is uniquely gracious in spirit and in projection of that spirit. Even objective observers would doubtless agree upon the friendliness and graciousness of Seaboard as manifested by its people. It is not a showy friendliness, however, to be evaluated by synthetic gestures and protestations, but rather it is authentic and responsive to the exigencies that validate its reality.\n\nFriendliness is essentially the spirit of Seaboard, and there are many facets of it.\n\nThere is warmth in the response to need when once that need, whether insistently tangible or subtle, becomes evident. Surely Seaboard is unique in its warm-hearted answer to the calls for material help and in its organization of opportunities to serve herein. There is generosity as well as warmth of feeling in the responses. If the intrinsic value of gifts to community exigency could be totaled, even over a period of two decades, the result would amaze the generous citizenry itself.\n\nThere is cooperation. This does not imply an easy acceptance of causes, untested and unprobed by thinking people. But once convinced of merit in the appeal, a people are enlisted in mind as well as in heart to work together to accomplish worthy objectives.\n\nThere have been beautiful examples of this spirit of cooperation in religious, civic and cultural life in general. It has manifested itself in the fellowship and love between the two churches. Once during a vacancy in the Baptist pulpit, the Methodist minister was a real pastor to the Baptists, even on occasions holding their prayer meetings for them. While Baptists were building their new church, Seaboard Methodists made available to them their own sanctuary for their worship services. Cooperation among the Methodists themselves has made possible the notable history of Methodism in this area.\n\nIn larger aim and purpose and in brotherly affection, indeed, the people are one. Friendship cements the fellowship, and its warmth extends to all the areas of living.\n\nThe citizens of the community go more or less equably about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Not uncompromisingly heroic in equivocal situations, perhaps, they yet have given sons to become veterans and casualties of Corregidor and Guadalcanal and Normandy beaches and Iwo Jima.\n\nWhat better summing up is there than to say a people gives its allegiance to its country and to its God!\n\n—Bernice Kelly Harris\n\nPART ONE\n\nOUR HISTORY\n\nA Look Into The Past\n\nTHE life story of a church is the life story of people as well. The story must, therefore, be related to the history of the community. It must tell something about the life of the families and individuals whose spiritual and financial contriutions made the church possible.\n\nAccordingly, a “Look into the Past” is necessary if one is to appreciate fully the rich history of the Seaboard Methodist Church. It should be recalled that on June 11, 1739, John Wesley, the Founder of Methodism said: “I look upon all the world as my parish.”\n\nThe Founding Fathers in Northampton County\n\nThe first record of a Methodist Church in Northampton County, North Carolina, is shown by a deed for an acre of land, “with all houses, buildings and every other appurtenance,” signed on June 12, 1793. This deed is recorded on page 60 of Book 10 in the Office of the Northampton County Register of Deeds. It was given by one Howell Hobbs of Brunswick County, Virginia, to the “Founding Fathers” of Methodism in Northampton County. Coming from the border of Virginia and North Carolina in the Northeastern part of the county, the Founding Fathers were: Matthew Myrick and Nathaniel Mason of Virginia; John Moore and Nancy King of the County of Northampton, North Carolina.\n\nFor the sum of twenty shillings (current money of Virginia), land was thus conveyed for the first Methodist Church in Northampton County. Known as Concord Meeting House, the\n\nchurch still stands, bearing this simple legend: “Concord M. E. Church—1795.” Concord was however a part of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South.\n\nIn her “History of Northampton County Churches”, Mrs. Nancy Moore Froelich, historian of the Northampton Historical Society, points out the evangelistic zeal of the Founding Fathers for the spread of Methodism. From a memorandum written on June 5, 1793, before the deed was signed on June 12, 1793, Mrs. Froelich makes this interesting summary of the intent of the Church Fathers.\n\n“Memorandum made this fifth day of June 1793 especially specifies that the above-named committee doth hereby covenant and agree for themselves and their heirs forever that the within acre of land and buildings thereon shall be appropriated to the sole use and benefits of the preachers of the Methodist Episcopal Church to expound the word of God in so long as they shall preach the doctrines contained in Mr. Wesley's notes on the New Testament and his four volumes of sermons.”\n\nConcord Methodist Episcopal Church—1795\n\nFor the historical minded, the name—Concord—proposes an interesting speculation. There are those who say that the name relates to another Concord, famous in American history. For it was just 20 years before—1775—that Paul Revere made his famous midnight dash from Boston to Concord, 21 miles away, to warn the people in every village and on every farm that the British were coming and to get up and fight.\n\nWithin those 20 years, our nation had won its freedom, established a federal government and gained the admiration of the world. In 1795, George Washington was also serving out the remaining year of his second term as President.\n\nIt can, therefore, be imagined that the patriots who founded and helped develop Concord Church were not unmindful of the great courage of the embattled farmers in Concord town when they gave the British.\n\n“- - - - ball for ball\n\nFrom behind each fence and farm-yard wall, chasing the redcoats down the lane, then crossing the fields to emerge again, under the trees at the turn of the road, and only pausing to fire and load.”\n\nConcord Becomes A Community Center\n\nSituated on an important thoroughfare between Emporia, Virginia, and Franklin, Virginia, Concord Church drew its parishioners from the rich plantation owners and the rural belles and gay young blades as well as from the poor and enslaved. Old records point out that the pious settlers established the church for the “better instruction of unwary youth, the expounding of truth to untutored slaves, and the spiritual consolation of the old.”\n\nAll-day religious festivals brought out the families for miles around. Usually held in August, these festivals were characterized by exhortings, shouting and praying in the church with great feasts spread under the oaks for relaxation. At noon time slaves passed platters of delectable foods prepared under the direction of the mistresses of the plantations.\n\nIt was during this hour of relaxation that youth had its day. Exhausted from the exhortations of the morning and quieted by the feast of the hour, the elderly and pious dozed under the oaks while the belles and the blades shyly sought each others’ company. Such gatherings occasionally brought about love affairs that led to lavish weddings in the big mansions on the plantations where feasting and dancing lasted ’til dawn.\n\nThe Descendants of Old Concord\n\nThe founders of Concord Methodist Episcopal Church and the early families who promoted its growth were pious and proud people who believed devoutly in the principles of Methodism as outlined by its founder, John Wesley. These principles constituted a way of life that was hammered into the hearts and minds of each succeeding generation. Over the breakfast table and in the evening hour of prayer, parents explained to their children the spiritual values of Methodism and the importance of building strong Methodist families. Service to the church, community and nation, they said, was a major requirement of all good Methodists.\n\nJohn Wesley himself laid down the importance of Service in one of his Letters devoted to “Rule of Conduct”:\n\n“Do all the good you can,By all the means you can,In all the ways you can,In all the places you can,At all the times you can,To all the people you can,As long as ever you can.”\n\nThe significant relationship between Old Concord Church and the Seaboard Methodist Church lies in the continuity of leadership handed down through generations of old Concord families who later became leaders in the Seaboard Methodist Church.\n\nThe Captain Nathaniel Mason, 1757-1834, who was a Concord Founding Father, is the great, great, great-grandfather of Dr. John W. Parker, Jr., a leader in the Seaboard Methodist Church for the past 30 years.\n\nReid Vick Harris, one of our able young leaders, is a descendant of William Reid, the father of Alex Reid, Reid Harris’ great-grandfather on his mother's side.\n\nMrs. Maggie Vassar Stephenson is also a descendant of the Vassars who were active in the early Concord Church.\n\nPleasant Grove Methodist Episcopal Church—1836\n\nAfter the organization of Concord Methodist Episcopal Church in 1795, Methodism began to spread to other communities in Northampton County. Pleasant Grove Methodist Episcopal Church, now a part of the Seaboard charge, followed in 1836.\n\nAccording to an article written by Mrs. Willie Pritchard Matthews in the JACKSON NEWS of August 6, 1937:\n\nThis first church building of 1836 was a small one-room, frame building, only weatherboarded and without ceiling, plaster, paint and even without a means of heating. When the house was ready for worship, there arose the problem of a name for it. One of the very devout and active members of the church, Miss Elizabeth Roland, suggested the name of Pleasant Grove because she said the shade trees surrounding the new church made a very pleasant grove for the meetings. The congregation was pleased with Miss Roland's suggestion, and by this name the proud members called their house of worship.\n\nAs we check the roll of the Seaboard Methodist Church for the years of 1885 to 1892, we find that many of the members transferred from Pleasant Grove Church. C. W. Rose and T. B. Rose had transferred by 1886.\n\nOther transfers were: John T. Ramsay, brother of J. H. Ramsay; Mrs. Helen Bridgers Joyner, mother of Bertha Joyner Parker; Rupert N. Bridgers; Henry E. Bridgers; and Miss Johnnie Sue Bridgers, our first organist.\n\nT. S. Taylor, a member of Seaboard Methodist Episcopal Church's first Board of Trustees, came from Pleasant Grove. He was the son of Rev. Turner S. Taylor, the great-grandfather of Lucy Leake Spaine and Florence Leake Crocker.\n\nW. H. Ivey, another member of Seaboard's first Board of Trustees, was a Pleasant Grove transfer. Mr. Ivey was the father of Mrs. J. P. Spencer and Mrs. Millard Long, devoted Seaboard members, and the grandfather of J. P. Spencer, Jr., now on the Seaboard Official Board.\n\nThomas R. Hargrove, and Sarah and Frank M. Reese, original Seaboard members, were also transfers.\n\nSharon Methodist Episcopal Church—1839\n\nThree years after the founding of the Pleasant Grove Methodist Church, another Methodist Church—Sharon—was organized.\n\nWhen the beautiful new Sharon Church was dedicated on October 23, 1955, the Dedication program presented a brief history of the Church:\n\nLong before a building was erected, a bush arbor was made near this spot and different preachers were invited to stop by and hold services for the people. It was on September 7th, 1839, that Macajah Garriss gave a deed for three acres of land, upon which to erect a meeting house. . . . The site of the church was given with the understanding, stated in the deed, that a meeting house be erected and that a minister be employed from the Conference, a man able and willing to exhort and expound the Word of God. A one-room wooden structure was erected on the given site. The pews of the church were quite high, and the pulpit stood afar off where only the head of the minister could be seen. A division ran down the center aisle, one side used exclusively for men and the other for women. Sharon was the name selected for the church, meaning a beautiful place.\n\nThe Sanctuary of the Church\n\nPhoto of exterior of Concord Church\n\nThe Exterior and Interior of Concord Church\n\nMany past and present members of the Seaboard Methodist Church came from old Sharon Church families. Among past members are: William Robert Vick, deceased; Charles Booker Vick, deceased; Mrs. Aggie Vick Edwards, deceased. Present membership includes Dr. C. L. Vick and Mrs. Elizabeth Bottoms Bullock.\n\nFrom these accounts of early Church history, we learn that of the four Churches now on the Seaboard Charge, three were founded before the War Between the States, 1861-1865: Concord, 1795; Pleasant Grove, 1836; and Sharon, 1839.\n\nIt was not until 1880, however, that the Seaboard Methodist Church was born. From the date of the founding of Sharon in 1839, Northampton County citizens were destined to endure the rigors of two wars: the War with Mexico, 1846-1848; and the War Between the States, 1861-1865, with the aftermath of the Reconstruction Period, 1865-1877.\n\nOut of these long and torturous years of Reconstruction, law and order was finally re-established in the South. Our people then turned their talents once more toward the building of homes, churches and communities.\n\nBy 1880, the Seaboard Methodists were preparing to organize a Church community and to build a place of worship.\n\nThe Rise and Spread of\n\nMethodism\n\nHALFORD E. LUCCOCK states that “The Greatest Beginning of all was in a manger and in an obscure home in Nazareth. Methodism, very fittingly, was born in a nursery.” For the training which John Wesley received in the nursery at his mother's knee was the seed-plot of the Methodist movement.\n\nIn 1729, John and Charles Wesley began Bible reading and practicing inward and outward holiness, and they invited others to do so. The Holy Club at Oxford University was an outgrowth of this practice.\n\nJohn and Charles Wesley came to Savannah in 1735 as missionaries of the Church of England (of which both were members and clergymen) to work among the Indians in Governor Oglethorpe's colony. They had great plans for their work among the heathen savages, but John soon realized his mission was a failure. Finally on December 22, 1737, he returned to England, Charles having sailed the previous year. On the boat trip to America John had become associated with a group of Moravians and was impressed with their faith. This association continued in Georgia and was renewed in England upon his return. On the evening of May 24, 1739, he very “unwillingly” accompanied a friend to a society on Aldersgate Street in London. Here he had his heart-warming experience. Here the Methodist Church in England was born.\n\nFrom England, Methodism spread to Ireland and thence to America by immigration. Early leaders in the movement in America were Robert Strawbridge in Maryland (after 1760),\n\nPhilip Embury in New York (1766), George Whitefield, Freeborn Garrettson, Francis Asbury (1771), and others.\n\nIn answer to the request from the American colonists for preachers, John Wesley sent Richard Boardman and Joseph Pilmoor in 1769 as the first regular itinerant Methodist preachers. Their appointment: America. Pilmoor went first to Philadelphia, then south to Maryland, Virginia, and finally in 1772 became the first itinerant Methodist preacher to enter North Carolina. He preached at Coinjock September 28, 1772, and continued along the eastern coast, stopping at Edenton, Bath, New Bern, Wilmington. George Whitefield, who came to America about the time John Wesley returned to England from Georgia, had visited in North Carolina several times (1740, 1748, 1764) and had preached in several eastern towns. There were some Methodists living in the colony, but there was no organized society. Whitefield was not here in the capacity of an itinerant minister.\n\nMethodism Is Organized in North Carolina\n\nTo Robert Williams goes the distinction of having organized the first Methodist society in North Carolina, in 1773 or 1774 (the exact date is uncertain). He made out a plan for a six weeks’ circuit from Petersburg to the south over the Roanoke River some distance into North Carolina. Williams was instrumental in bringing Jesse Lee, one of our first and finest preachers, into the Methodist Church. When Williams married in 1775, he was forced to locate in order to support a wife. He died later that same year, September 26, 1775.\n\nA period of great revival began in southern Virginia in 1775 and swept into Halifax and Bute (later divided to form Franklin and Warren) Counties in North Carolina. By the close of the revival in 1776, more than 1880 new members had been\n\nadded. This led to the formation of the Carolina Circuit, May 21, 1776, with Edward Dromgoole, Francis Poythress, and Isham Tatum as pastors. The circuit included the eastern half of the state. In 1777, there were four pastors assigned to the circuit—John Dickins, John King whose family in England disinherited him when he refused to return to the Church of England, Lee Roy Cole, and Edward Pride.\n\nSo great were their labors that in 1778 the North Carolina Circuit was divided to form three circuits—New Hope, Tar River, and Roanoke. William Glendenning was appointed the first pastor of the Roanoke Circuit. He was Jesse Lee's pastor and made him class leader. Later Glendenning went insane, but recovered and settled near Raleigh, where he had a publishing business.\n\nJohn Dickins traveled Roanoke Circuit in 1779-80. It was he who suggested the name Methodist Episcopal Church which was adopted at the Christmas Conference in Baltimore, 1784. He also made the motion to establish a college, and Cokesbury College was subsequently built in 1787. In 1786, he prepared for publication the first Discipline in its present form (divided into sections instead of questions and answers). When the Book Concern was established in 1789, he used $600 of his own money for capital and became the first Book Agent. He served in this capacity until his death in 1798.\n\nAmong the early preachers who served Roanoke Circuit were: 1782—James Martin; 1783—John Easter and William Dameron; 1789—Jonathan Bird; 1795—Daniel Shines; 1797—William Ormond who left money to build Ormond's Chapel between Kinston and Snow Hill, near his home community. Thomas Bowen served Roanoke Circuit sometime prior to 1790 when he became Presiding Elder; later he served as Book Steward in 1795.\n\nJohn Tunnell was Presiding Elder of the Yadkin District in 1785, an area which included Roanoke, Caswell, New Hope, Guilford, Salisbury, Yadkin, and Halifax Circuits. He carried Methodism west of the Blue Ridge Mountains. In 1800, Francis Poythress was Presiding Elder of the large area from Asheville to Hatteras, from Wilmington to the Virginia line.\n\nThe Famous Roanoke Circuit\n\nWhen the Roanoke Circuit was formed in 1778, its area was along the Roanoke River and probably included Bertie, Northampton, Halifax, and Warren Counties. It has been called the “Cradle of Methodism in North Carolina.” The Roanoke Circuit has always been an honored name in the annals of Methodist history. Here Lovick Pierce, one of the publishing agents of the church, was born. In the bounds of this circuit at “The Old Barn”, Jesse Lee preached his first sermon on September 17, 1779. He took John Dickins’ place on the Roanoke Circuit for a few weeks in 1779. One of the finest preachers of Methodism, he was the church's first historian, author of “Short History of the Methodists.”\n\nThe Roanoke Circuit had 480 members in 1780. By 1790, the one circuit had been divided to form Camden, Bertie, Roanoke, and New River Circuits, with a membership of 3072 whites, and 1220 colored. The records of 1800 show that the following circuits were in existence: Roanoke, Pamlico, Newbern, Goshen, Contentney, Camden, Bertie, Banks, and Mattamuskeet, with a white membership of 2073.\n\nIn 1796 North Carolina was second to Virginia in the number of members of the Methodist Church. And by 1805 the North Carolina Circuit had increased from one to twenty-two circuits, with 11,000 members.\n\nAsbury and Coke First American Methodist Bishops\n\nFrancis Asbury was sent to America by Wesley in 1771, to be superintendent of all the work in America. His travels carried him across the length and breadth of the land. His journal records that he entered North Carolina June 16, 1780. From then until July 3, he traveled the Roanoke Circuit, preaching in homes and crude log chapels or outdoors. In January 1784, he was again in North Carolina, first in the eastern section, then through Bertie, Northampton, and Hertford Counties.\n\nIn 1784, Dr. Thomas Coke was sent to America by Wesley with instructions to form a separate church in the new country. Coke and Asbury met together and worked out plans for the organization, and on Christmas Eve, 1784, at Lovely Lane Chapel in Baltimore, the preachers met and organized The Methodist Episcopal Church. Asbury and Coke were elected the first bishops. The following spring, the first annual conference of The Methodist Episcopal Church was held at Green Hill's house, one mile from Louisburg, North Carolina, on April 20, 1785. The conference was attended by Asbury, Coke, and twenty preachers from this area. There was no housing problem—they simply slept on the floor. The office of Presiding Elder was born at this meeting.\n\nCalled the “Prophet of the Long Road,” Francis Asbury was continually going, superintending the work, preaching, holding conferences, and founding new churches. The Church was growing, but men were giving their lives upon its altars.\n\nThe early pioneers were an unusual group. They attended no theological schools, only “Brush Colleges” (on-the-job training you might say). With the Bible and Discipline as their principal books, they not only helped to build churches,\n\nthey helped to build a Nation out of the wilderness—both physical and human. Most did not serve long in the itinerancy. Many died young (nearly half who died before 1847 were less than thirty years old) or were forced to locate for health reasons. When they married, many were forced to locate because they could not support a wife and family on the preacher's salary—$64 annually until the General Conference in 1792 added travel, etc. Wedding fees were acceptable, but fees for baptisms and funerals were strictly forbidden.\n\nMethodism was especially adapted to American life. These itinerant preachers served the people under conditions where a settled ministry was not feasible. They followed the tide of migration as it moved west, preached the gospel, organized societies, and formed these into circuits. At first Methodism was looked upon as a despised and persecuted sect. The preachers were often persecuted during these early years, but they were a consecrated group of men who labored earnestly and fruitfully.\n\nFrancis Asbury's journal records a total of sixty-three trips in North Carolina, and it is quite likely that he preached at Concord Church on one of his trips. The Concord Society in 1793 was looking forward to the purchase of land and the erection of a meeting house. This dream was fulfilled in 1795 when the property was deeded to the “Founding Fathers.” We do know from Asbury's journal that he also preached several times at Rehoboth Chapel in Northampton County. While the building itself was not erected until 1798, the church or society had its beginning in the home of Richard Whitaker, probably as early as 1785. Asbury visited in his home several times. There were few churches in those days. The preaching places were usually in homes, barns, schools, or outdoors in bush arbors when the weather permitted.\n\nThe Influence of the Methodist Church in\n\nNorthampton County\n\nThe influence of the Methodist Societies has been felt in the communities of Northampton County through the years. The Reverend Turner Stephens Taylor, a resident of the Mount Carmel community, felt this influence and began to preach in the early 1800's. He was the father of T. S. Taylor, one of the trustees on the original deed of the Seaboard Methodist Episcopal Church, South. His grandson, the Reverend Charles R. Taylor, served in the Arkansas, Virginia, and North Carolina Conferences. Among the descendants of this pioneer preacher in our membership today are Mrs. Annie Taylor Bass, Mrs. Lucy Leake Spaine, and Mrs. Florence Leake Crocker. While the Seaboard Church has not sent any of its sons into the ministry of the church, there are families in our membership who have given of their sons to the ministry through other Methodist congregations.\n\nRufus Bradley joined the North Carolina Annual Conference in 1894 and served for forty-three years. His mother, Mrs. Mary E. (Mollie) Bradley, transferred to Seaboard from Pleasant Grove in 1901. T. M. Grant in his memoir said, “We are happy that he lived and dwelt among us. We know God lives because he lived in Rufus Bradley.”\n\nJohn G. Long, Jr., whose father transferred to Seaboard from Concord, is a member of the Virginia Conference.\n\nRichard Clifton Spaine, Jr., is director of the Wesley Foundation at Iowa State Teachers College. He went out from Broad Street Methodist Church, Portsmouth, Virginia, before his mother, Mrs. Lucy Leake Spaine, returned to Seaboard and again joined the church of her youth.\n\nThe rapid growth of Methodism in the early days, as sketched above, could not have taken place by the work of ministers alone. It was by and large the teamwork between the consecrated laymen with warm hearts and their pastors. Both the laymen and ministers were dedicated to the faith and guided by the doctrines described below.\n\nThe Principles and Spiritual\n\nValues of Methodism\n\nBISHOP CHARLES C. SELECMAN in The Methodist Primer writes: “The Methodist Church may be said to represent the trained mind, the warm heart, and the serving hand.”\n\nJohn Wesley was taught at his mother's knee, then attended Charter House School, London, and Oxford University. Then followed his heart-warming experience at Aldersgate Meeting House on May 24, 1738. Out of this heart-warming experience he went forth to serve.\n\nMethodism today is continuing what its human founder started.\n\nThe Trained Mind\n\nMethodism began in a college. Methodism was born with a passion for education. The Christmas Conference in Baltimore, 1784, voted to establish a college. Cokesbury College at Abingdon, Maryland, opened its doors in 1787. This was done despite the fact that of the 83 preachers in America in 1784, only Dr. Thomas Coke had attended College or had even what we today would consider a high school education! All of the 63 preachers who were present were desperately poor financially, but these men of faith and vision began to pledge and raise the money before leaving the Conference.\n\nThe circuit riders were educators as they visited in pioneer homes and brought news from the outside world. Many children were taught their ABC's, as well as the teachings of Jesus, in the Sunday Schools.\n\nNorth Carolina Methodists had an early concern for education. Francis Asbury made a tour of the Roanoke Circuit with John Dickins in the summer of 1780. While visiting in the home of Brother Bustian, Dickins drew up a subscription list for a Kingswood School in America. Brother Bustian and Gabriel Long (a non-Methodist) made the first subscriptions to this school—and this was while the colonies were still struggling for their independence and the future was unknown. Cokesbury School on the Yadkin River in Davie County was the first school sponsored and maintained by a conference in Methodism. It was opened sometime prior to 1793.\n\nThere were several small Christian colleges in eastern North Carolina, including Wesleyan Female College at Murfreesboro, Carolina College at Maxton, Louisburg College, and Littleton Female College. Many young ladies from this area attended Littleton Female College. This school was begun in January 1882 as Central Institute. It was granted a new charter in 1887 and the name changed to Littleton Female College. The influence of this school is evidenced by the following excerpt from the 1887 Journal of the North Carolina Annual Conference:\n\nWe are pleased to learn that this institution, located at Littleton, N. C., is in a growing and prosperous condition, the patronage increasing since last January from 20 to 79 pupils. This school deserves the attention and support of our people.\n\nProfessor J. M. Rhodes purchased this property in the spring of 1899, and became its president in August of that year. He maintained that relationship for thirty years, or until the night of January 22, 1919, when flames swept away the entire college plant, leaving only the steel water tower standing as a lone sentinel on the deserted campus.\n\nThe Methodist Church is still building schools to meet not only the educational needs, but the spiritual needs, of today's students. Again North Carolina is leading the way with two new colleges now under construction, North Carolina Wesleyan College at Rocky Mount and Methodist College at Fayetteville.\n\nIn his little book, Endless Line of Splendor, Halford E. Luccock tells us that “Martin Luther is reported to have thrown a bottle of ink at the Devil once . . . Churches have been throwing ink at Satan since the invention of the printing press.” John Wesley began the Methodist printing business, and he insisted that the circuit riders carry tracts with them to sell or distribute. The Book Concern, started in 1789, has been in operation ever since, and is now the largest Protestant publishing establishment in the world. The Methodist Publishing House, as it is now called, uses three carloads of paper each working day and one hundred tons of ink annually—quite a large bottle of ink to throw at the Devil!\n\nThe Warm Heart\n\nMembership in The Methodist Church is based on a personal, vital religious experience that is fitted to the spiritual needs of each individual, rather than being determined by conformity to some creed or form. As John Wesley expressed it once, “We think and let think.” Conduct rather than creed is still the test of membership in the Methodist Church.\n\nThrough the General Board of Evangelism, The Methodist Church is actively engaged in a program to carry the good news of Jesus to all men and to strengthen and undergird the spiritual life of all Christians.\n\nThe Serving Hand\n\nIn 1739, when the Bishop of Bristol refused John Wesley permission to preach in his parish, Wesley replied, “The world is my parish.” Following this principle and Jesus’ command, “Go ye into all the world . . .”, The Methodist Church has become a world church with a world vision.\n\nThrough the Division of World Missions, work is carried on in more than fifty countries. Our one thousand missionaries work with more than 16,000 trained Christian national workers to carry out its program of medical, evangelistic, social, and educational work. In addition, the Woman's Division of Christian Service has approximately 500 missionaries serving in thirty-two countries.\n\nThe Division of National Missions serves missionary and church extension needs in the United States and its territories, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. It includes work among language and racial groups, in remote mountain and rural areas, settlement work in cities and industrial areas. In the field of church extension, the Board of Missions makes loans and grants to modernize existing churches and to erect new churches in new population centers. The North Carolina Annual Conference leads to all others in the field of church extension, having begun seventy new churches in the last seven years.\n\nThe Methodist Orphanage (now The Methodist Home for Children, Inc.) at Raleigh was founded in 1898 to provide a home for homeless children. The first building was completed in 1900. At this time thirty-two children were enrolled under the supervision of the Reverend J. W. Jenkins.\n\nMethodists believe that Jesus is the Savior of all, and the task of getting the message of Jesus to all is the responsibility of all Christians.\n\n“Methodism stands for an inclusive Christianity, believing that the things that unite Christians are more important than the things that divide,” is Dr. Gilbert T. Rowe's definition of our church's ecumenical spirit. It was this spirit that led the three branches of Methodism to unite in 1939. It is this same spirit that now is leading to the study of possible union with the United Evangelical Brethren and the Episcopal Churches. Methodism was also one of the leading forces in the formation and support of the World Council of Churches.\n\nJohn Wesley said: “If thy heart be right with my heart, give me thy hand.” The Methodist Church extends the hand of brotherhood to “the Christians of other Churches and the Churches of other Christians.”\n\nFrom its inception The Methodist Church has been concerned about bringing wholesomeness to an unwholesome society. Members of the Holy Club at Oxford visited jails, taught Sunday classes for children who worked in mines and factories and could not attend school, and distributed food and clothing to those in need.\n\nIn 1908, the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church adopted “The Social Creed of the Methodist Episcopal Church.” Its aim was to help prevent social evils as well as to minister to the victims. It declares that the church stands for equal rights and justice for all men; abolition for child labor and regulation of work for women; abatement of poverty and liquor traffic and other evils that threaten society; for a living wage and the right of workers to unite.\n\nIn our historic position we have sought to follow Christ in bringing the whole of life, with its activities, possessions, and relationships, into conformity with the will of God.\n\n—from The Social Creed of The Methodist Church.\n\nWith official observers in Washington and the United Nations, the Methodist Church today is voicing in firm tones\n\nits opposition to those forces which do not permit the abundant life to be available to all.\n\nProminent Doctrines of The Methodist Church\n\n1. Universal Redemption—Christ died for all men, and salvation is for all men.\n\n2. Repentance—All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God and therefore need a Savior who can say, “Thy sins which are many are forgiven.”\n\n3. Justification—Forgiveness of sins. Justification is by faith and only through the merit of Christ and is proved by works.\n\n4. Regeneration—Spiritual rebirth in Christ. “Justification is the removal of guilt, while regeneration is the removal of the pollution of sin.”—N. C. Methodist Handbook, 1905.\n\n5. Sanctification—John Wesley described this doctrine as a life fully surrendered to love God with the whole heart and our neighbors as ourselves. It has been called “perfect love”.\n\n6. Witness of the Spirit—“By the witness of the Spirit, I mean an inward impression on the soul, whereby the Spirit of God, immediately and directly, witnesses to my spirit that I am a child of God; that Jesus Christ hath loved me and given himself for me; that all my sins are blotted out, and I, even I, am reconciled to God.”—John Wesley.\n\n7. Childhood Religion—John Wesley was a pioneer in religious instruction of children. The Church stresses infant baptism and urges that children be given religious training by precept and example from the earliest days.\n\n8. Sacraments—The Church practices two sacraments which were ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel—Baptism and the Supper of the Lord. “Baptism is the symbol of purification; it is the emblem of the baptism by the Spirit of God; it is the sign and seal of a new spiritual birth.” Baptism may be by sprinkling, pouring, or immersion.\n\nAll followers of Christ who desire to partake with us of the symbols of the body and blood of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ may do so.\n\n9. Final Apostasy—This doctrine teaches that it is possible to fall into sin again after justification, but by the grace of God we may rise\n\nagain and amend our lives. Therefore, we should not deny the place of forgiveness to such as truly repent.\n\nThese were not theoretical doctrines but were practical guides in the life of the early church. Judge Gaston, one of the most eminent jurists of his day, and who was a Roman Catholic in his religion, said that “the Methodist ministry had done more to improve the society of the rural districts than any other class of men, or any other class of agencies that had ever been brought to bear on this subject.”\n\nWhere To From Here?\n\nWe must not be satisfied simply to hold on firmly to the past. We must be adventurous. We must reach out and take firm hold of the future.\n\nThe chief dangers that lay in the path of Methodism as it spread itself from Aldersgate over all the earth as a vital religious force still lurk along the way to hinder its effectiveness today. John Wesley wrote of the dangers on August 6, 1786, as follows:\n\nI am not afraid that the people called Methodists should ever cease to exist either in Europe or America. But I am afraid lest they should exist only as a dead sect, having the form of religion without the power. And this undoubtedly will be the case unless they hold fast both the doctrine, spirit and discipline with which they first set out.\n\nWe have the physical plant ample for the needs of the present. We must be alert not to lose “the power of godliness,” but to seek after it relentlessly.\n\nHalford E. Luccock writes: “Christianity is a serial story. It has been published in great installments.”\n\nThe history of our church is a story to be continued. Some of the installments are to be written by us. The broad outline is apparent already. The details must be filled in from day to day and year to year.\n\nPleasant Grove Church\n\nPleasant Grove Church (TOP); Sharon Grove Church (BOTTOM)\n\nASSEMBLY ROOM OF THE ANNEX BUILDING\n\n- FIRST ROW (LEFT TO RIGHT): Yvonne Edwards, Nancy Ann Crocker, Philip Mitchell, Andrew Mitchell, Melody Edwards, Dana K.

THIRD ROW: Mary Ann Mumford, Ann White, Steve Edwards, Gene Taylor, Joe Magee, Claire Irvin, Billy Reese Bullock, Steve Taylor. TEACHERS: Rachal Little, Helen Irvin, Hazel Edwards, Cleo White, Elizabeth B. Bullock, Shirley Warrick Taylor.\n\nThe emphasis of the future should be personal spiritual enrichment. The vehicles of this enrichment must be a trained mind, an awakened social concern, a dedicated and active stewardship of time, abilities, and means.\n\nOn the level of the local church this means we must not organize as an end in itself, but that every member of the Official Board, the Commission on Membership and Evangelism, the Commission on Education, the Commission on Missions, the Commission on Stewardship and Finance, and other committees and officers must perform their task as a work of Christian worship to Almighty God. Their work cannot be done most effectively without the support of every member.\n\nToday we join our hands and hearts to go forward in the blessed hope\n\n“That in the name of Jesus,The World shall be reborn.”(Vachel Lindsay, in “Endless Line of Splendor”)\n\nOur Church . . . 1880-1922\n\n. . . The First Era\n\nRECORDS show that the town of Seaboard, North Carolina, had a considerable number of Methodists long before 1880. Using an old wooden schoolhouse as a meeting place, the Methodist population in 1880 took steps to secure land for the purpose of building a church. Old Seaboard residents recall the old schoolhouse with pleasant memories. Situated on the spot where the C. R. Kee residence now stands, the school building was later bought by J. R. Bradley who moved and renovated the building into a beautiful home for his family. It is still a gracious home with Mrs. J. R. Bradley, Sr. and her daughter, Edith, as residents.\n\nThe Founding Fathers of the Seaboard Methodist Episcopal Church, South, consisted of the first Board of Trustees and the early Stewards. The members of the first Board of Trustees were: F. E. Foster, W. H. Bridgers, T. S. Taylor, W. H. Ivey and W. H. Lynn. The first Steward mentioned in Church records was “Brother W. F. Grubbs,” 1885. In 1900, records show the names of J. G. L. Crocker and W. F. Grubbs. Church Conference Records for February 11, 1900 say: “Stewards report being called for the assessment plan for raising preacher's salary. Subject was discussed and adopted and a committee consisting of the Stewards, J. G. L. Crocker and W. F. Grubbs and the following Church members, R. W. Edwards, T. B. Rose, M. R. Stephenson, Mrs. R. W. Edwards, Mrs. M. R. Stephenson and Mrs. W. S. Pruden was appointed to fix and determine the amount each member should contribute.”\n\nLand Is Deeded to the Trustees\n\nThe deed to the land for the First Seaboard Methodist Church was given on August 5, 1881, by Joseph M. Phillips, Arnetta E. Ramsay and John Ramsay of Northampton County to the above named Trustees for the “consideration of ten dollars.” The deed further stipulated that the “said premises shall be used, kept, maintained, and disposed of as a place of Divine Worship for the use of the Ministry and Membership of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South.”\n\nAs a first step, the Founding Fathers constructed a little one-room building near the spot where the Seaboard Methodist Church parsonage now stands. Built of undressed lumber, hewn by hand, the little building was heated by two stoves—one at each end of the structure.\n\nJ. R. Stephenson, one of Seaboard's highly respected senior citizens, recalls that he made his first “public” appearance in a Thanksgiving program presented by Cary Parker, an early Seaboard school teacher, in this little one-room building.\n\nMr. Stephenson also points out that the movement for a place of worship in Seaboard actually came from a community Sunday School, organized by Mrs. Cordie Hardee, and attended by both Methodists and Baptists. Mrs. Hardee's husband was the Seaboard Railroad ticket agent, and Mrs. Hardee held Sunday School in the railroad station where she taught Bible stories to the children.\n\nMr. Stephenson, a Baptist, says this little Sunday School in the railroad station marked the birth of the fine cooperation which has always existed between our two great Churches—the Methodist and the Baptist.\n\nLater, what is known as the first Seaboard Methodist Church was built and dedicated on 3rd Sunday in July, 1885. It served as the place of worship until 1922, when it was torn down and\n\nmoved to make way for the second Church. The lumber was bought by J. L. Harris who used it to build a barn on his farm near Seaboard. The barn still stands on the farm now owned by Reid Vick Harris.\n\nThe Church Becomes Part of the North Carolina\n\nAnnual Conference\n\nSeaboard Methodist Church was first part of the Virginia Conference under the Northampton Circuit and the Murfreesboro District. A hard six-year struggle on the part of the Northampton Circuit and the North Carolina Annual Conference finally brought the Seaboard Methodist Church into the North Carolina Annual Conference in 1890.\n\nThe struggle started in 1884 at the 48th session of the North Carolina Annual Conference, when the Conference formed the Garysburg Circuit to include the following churches: Seaboard, Pleasant Grove, Garysburg, Oak Grove and Shiloh.\n\nJanuary, 1886, Church Conference Records reveal a meeting held at Seaboard and attended by all Garysburg Circuit Stewards: J. W. Grant and N. Grant from Shiloh or Oak Grove; W. F. Grubbs, Seaboard; Wm. H. Collins; P. S. Norwood and B. E. Rook, Shiloh or Oak Grove; Wm. H. Ivey, Pleasant Grove; and Dr. A. J. Ellis, Garysburg.\n\nThe reluctance of the Virginia Annual Conference to yield its North Carolina territory to the North Carolina Annual Conference is shown by an emphatic motion made by the Rev. William Grant in 1889 at the North Carolina Annual Conference. “All North Carolina Territory Embodied in Other Conferences To Be Transferred to The North Carolina Conference”—so stated the motion.\n\nA strong petition was sent to the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, scheduled to meet in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1890.\n\nThe North Carolina Annual Conference Journal of 1889 contains the record of this petition on page 48. F. L. Reid introduced the following resolution, which was read and adopted: “Resolved, that if the General Conference, to meet in St. Louis next May, after getting all the facts in reference to the matter, should see proper to transfer the territory without our state now embraced in the Virginia and Holston Conferences, either or both sections, we will most heartly and cordially welcome both the ministry and membership in these sections to the Conference to be formed in North Carolina.”\n\nF. L. Reid\n\nJohn R. Brooks\n\nThe petitions and motions of the North Carolina Annual Conference brought about the desired action on the part of the General Conference. In late 1890, Seaboard Methodist Church came into the North Carolina Annual Conference through the Warrenton District and the Garysburg Circuit. The Warrenton District at this period had only 8 parsonages, 13 charges, and 53 churches.\n\nThe 1890 action of the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, also strengthened the growth of Methodism throughout North Carolina. The 1900 Journal of the North Carolina Annual Conference Session reports its origin and expansion on page 96.\n\nThe North Carolina Conference was set off from the Virginia Conference in February 1837. In 1850, and again in 1870, North Carolina territory in the South Carolina Conference was transferred to this Conference. In 1890, North Carolina territory in the Holston Conference and in the Virginia Conference, except that beyond the Chowan River, was transferred to the North Carolina Conference, and the Conference was divided into the North Carolina and Western North Carolina Conferences. In 1894, the remaining N. C. territory in the Virginia Conference\n\nwas transferred to the North Carolina Conference. So now the two Conferences embrace the whole of North Carolina.\n\nSince 1890, the Seaboard Church has experienced many re-organizational changes. In 1921, by order of the North Carolina Annual Conference, the Warrenton District was changed to the WELDON DISTRICT. In 1924, the Seaboard Circuit was formed from the Garysburg Circuit including the following churches: Seaboard, Pleasant Grove (taken from the Northampton Circuit); Sharon (taken from the Conway Circuit); and Concord (taken from the Garysburg Circuit). In 1931, the Rocky Mount District was formed by a major realignment of District boundaries when the number of Districts was decreased from nine to seven. The Seaboard Circuit was a part of this District.\n\nToday, 1958, Seaboard Methodist Church is in the North Carolina Annual Conference, Rocky Mount District, Seaboard Circuit, with the following churches on circuit: Seaboard, Pleasant Grove, Sharon and Concord.\n\nThe Church Moves Ahead Quickly\n\nBy 1890, the Founding Fathers had brought a new church building into being, and the Seaboard Methodist Church was moving ahead toward spiritual strength through an active and dedicated membership.\n\nThere were many other first steps taken by 1890. Rev. C. E. Hobday was the first minister. J. B. Farmer was the first Sunday School Superintendent, 1885; A. J. Millar, the first Sunday School teacher. The Board of Trustees elected A. B. Daughtrey, first Secretary and appointed C. W. Rose as the first sexton.\n\nOn April 1, 1888, Church Conference Records show a Sunday School with 68 “scholars.” In 1889, W. F. Grubbs\n\nwas elected as the first Seaboard delegate to the North Carolina annual conference.\n\nSeaboard Methodist Church members were also subscribing to the North Carolina Christian Advocate to keep themselves informed on the state-wide progress of the Methodist Church. The North Carolina Annual Conference was exhorting pastors to keep good and permanent records in their churches. Young Seaboard Methodists were joining the Rosebud Missionary Society, a Children's Missionary program, designed to help them learn about the need to help the heathen in foreign lands. They were also reading “Our Little People,” a four-page leaflet containing interesting stories and Bible lessons.\n\nProblems Facing The Church—1880 - 1922\n\nMany problems faced the first Seaboard Methodist Church just as are faced by all new church congregations. Moneyraising, “back-sliders” and disputes among members constituted the most serious headaches. All of these difficulties were surmounted, however, as they usually are when Christians work together.\n\nInteresting side-lights on these problems were culled by Mrs. Lucy Leake Spaine from old church records.\n\nIn 1908, the church Stewards appointed a Committee on Church Assessments composed of W. R. Vick, Dr. M. R. Stephenson, and R. W. Edwards. Here are some of the assessments for that time: Dr. M. R. Stephenson—$25.00; R. W. Edwards—$25.00; J. G. L. Crocker—$25.00; W. R. Vick—$20.00; W. T. Norvell—$10.00; Luke Harris—$10.00; W. T. Jones—$6.00; A. K. Harris—$5.00; Mrs. Nettie D. Crocker—$5.00; Mrs. Nannie Stephenson—$5.00; Mrs. Aggie Edwards—$5.00; Mrs. Lucy Leake—$4.00; Mrs. Rosa Norvell—$3.00; Mrs. Alice Darden—$2.00; Mrs. Bettie Pruden—$2.00; and children were assessed 25c to 75c.\n\nOn February 11, 1900, Rev. G. W. Fisher, pastor, reported that the question of parsonage furniture for the Garysburg circuit was brought up and the Seaboard Church was asked to contribute $12.50.\n\nOn March 20, 1887, Rev. T. O. Edwards, pastor, reported that the amount paid for the pastor's salary for the previous quarter amounted to $21.75. Sunday School money received during that same period was $11.34.\n\nOn April 14, 1889, Rev. T. O. Edwards, pastor, reported that Bro. W. F. Grubbs and Bro. Frank Reese were appointed to inquire into the absence of several members and into the “wrong-doing” of others. Later reports revealed that the “wrong-doing” members had “acknowledged their sins and repented.” Long-time “absentees” promised “to return to the fold.”\n\nOn October 12, 1890, Rev. C. W. Cain reported that the small attendance at Sunday School led him to believe “the church was not fully alive to the importance of this great work.” Rev. Cain also expressed his concern that “the church was not alive to the cause of missions.” And worst of all, out of the $84.00 assessed the Seaboard Church for the Circuit cause, only $19.50 had been raised. Rev. Cain cheerfully laid this “to the short crops of the year 1890.”\n\nIn March 1898, Rev. J. D. Pegram, pastor, reported “prayer meetings led by Bro. Thomas Rose for Wednesday and Sunday nights, alternating with the “Missionary Baptists.”\n\nThere were “lighter” moments in the first Church history, even though they did not seem so “light” to the participants. In 1901, S. V. Edwards, aged six, fell asleep at the evening Church service. Thinking he was at home at the end of the service, he undressed and slept under the bench the entire night. So frightened was he when he woke up at dawn, he ran home in his underwear, leaving his clothes behind. Stoney\n\nis the only “living” person who ever spent the night in the Church.\n\nIn 1907, Ruth Vick, aged 7, was scheduled to recite at the Christmas program. Immediately before the time came, Ruth whispered to her mother that she wouldn't recite unless she got the beautiful doll in Paul Rose's store window. In desperation, Mrs. Vick promised and Ruth said her piece. But the next morning, when she asked for the doll, Mrs. Vick with dire threats told her never to mention “doll” again. And she didn't! She didn't get the doll, either. But the next Christmas Mrs. Vick relented and gave Ruth a beautiful doll. Mary Pruden Vincent earned her first money—$1.00—making the doll's clothes.\n\nDuring the early pastoral years, John W. Leake encountered a cancelled check made out to “myself.” Knowing that he had not been the “beneficiary” of this check, he was ready to descend on the bank in great fury for making a mistake in his account. Mrs. Leake halted him, however, when she explained that the check was made to M. Y. Self, Pastor.\n\nOrgan and Choir Music Become An Important Function\n\nThrough the years, the Seaboard Methodist Church has been blessed with talented musicians and beautiful voices. The music history of the church from 1800 until 1950 has been compiled by Walter D. Barbee and the Church History Committee is proud to present Mr. Barbee's inspiring story.\n\n“Organ and choir music in Seaboard Methodist Church, since its organization has always held an important position in its religious services. Women of Christian churches with musical training and ability have rendered a memorable service to the church. Miss Johnny Sue Bridgers was leader and organist for the first few years of its history, she having died in 1887 at\n\nthe age of 16 years. She was followed by Mrs. Helen Bridgers Joyner, mother of Mrs. Carl Parker, who served as leader and organist for about six or seven years. Under her leadership the young Methodist Church began to attract attention of those who attended. The choir then was small but boasted splendid voices of men and women who loved to sing.\n\n“Upon the death of Mrs. Joyner, the leadership of the choir was given to Mrs. M. R. Stephenson, organist, and under her direction until her death in 1921, a period of 28 years, the church experienced a great interest in church music. Wallen and Buck Jones and their father, W. J., Mrs. Eva McLendon, Mrs. J. H. Ramsay, Mrs. Lottie S. Barbee, Buck Weaver, Paul Edwards, Walter Barbee, Mrs. Garnett Crocker Harris, Estelle Rose, Mrs. Martha B. Maddrey, Mrs. A. K. Harris, and Mrs. Mary Pruden Vincent practiced often on Wednesday nights for special services for next Sunday and their singing was good and pleasant to listen to.\n\n“Then following the death of Mrs. Stephenson, her daughter, Lottie S. Barbee, was made both musical director and organist. She served for 31 or more years, and during these years duets and quartets were greatly enjoyed. Many of the members of the Baptist Church assisted with the music and it was very helpful. Cooperation of the two churches in music and singing added to the quality and volume of the music. The spirit of Baptist folks helping the Methodist and Methodist members helping the Baptist folks greatly improved the music of both churches.\n\n“As a whole, the quality and type of music, both instrumental and vocal, during the years of church history has always been good and notwithstanding the smallness of the groups, the quality of the music has been excellent. Certainly it has helped greatly the Services of Worship of the church. Also the\n\nrecently installed chimes in the church have greatly added to the happiness and joy of the entire community with its scheduled services every day, and especially during Christmas and Easter times.”\n\nSpecial Gifts\n\n1880 - 1922\n\nPiano 1920Mrs. Garnette Crocker Harris made this gift during her last illness, 1920.Organ 1921Mrs. Nannie F.

The Second Era\n\nON the 2nd day of May, 1922, the Trustees of the Seaboard Methodist Church—R. W. Edwards, M. R. Stephenson, G. F. Crocker, and W. R. Vick—for the sum of one dollar received a second deed for the “lot of land upon which the Seaboard M. E. Church, South now is located.” This deed was signed by John T. Ramsay and Annie Ramsay, his wife; Jos. H. Ramsay and Lillian Ramsay, his wife; and W. L. Harris and Bettie P. Harris, his wife. These were the heirs-at-law of the signers of the first deed in 1881, Joseph M. Phillips, Arnetta E. Ramsay and John Ramsay. Such a transaction was necessary because the first Church was to be torn down and replaced with a new one.\n\nBuilding Our New Church\n\nG. F. Crocker was appointed Chairman of the Building Committee for the new Church. At the first meeting of the Building Committee, $12,070 was pledged. The following members made the dream of a new Church an actuality:\n\nBarbee, Lottie S.$ 500Grubbs, D. G.750Crocker, Dean S.225Harris, A. K.300Crocker, Elmo200Harris, J. L.500Crocker, G.

R.500Ramsay, Lillian100\n\nThe total cost of the new Church was $18,000, all of which was raised by pledges. It was a beautiful Church whose members were proud upon its completion in the early 20's. In this day of inflation, the cost of such a Church building would be around $75,000 or more.\n\nThe lovely church was not dedicated until August 25, 1940. Bishop Clare Purcell, the presiding bishop, conducted the impressive dedicatory ceremony. The musical program was arranged by Mrs. Lottie S. Barbee. Rev. J. B. Hurley was pastor in charge at that time.\n\nMemorials and Gifts—1922 - 1950\n\nMemorialsIn Memory ofDonorWindowNannie F. StephensonHer husband, Dr. M. R. StephensonWindowW. F. GrubbsHis son, D. G.

Church\n\nBuilding the Seaboard Circuit Parsonage\n\nIn 1924, the Seaboard Circuit was formed, bringing in Seaboard and Concord from the Garysburg Circuit, Pleasant Grove from the Northampton Circuit, and Sharon from the Conway Circuit.\n\nFormerly, pastors serving the Seaboard Church lived in the parsonage located in Garysburg. Now it became necessary, with the organization of the Seaboard Circuit, to build a parsonage in Seaboard. The four churches of the Seaboard Circuit—Concord, Pleasant Grove, Seaboard and Sharon—assumed the financial responsibility. Started in 1923, the parsonage was completed in 1925, at a cost of $6,000. The first pastor to live in it was one of the best beloved of all our pastors, Rev. Frank Culbreth, who came in 1924.\n\nOur Pastors—1922-1950\n\nDuring these years, many able pastors served our Church and helped contribute to its spiritual growth and physical expansion. Rev. William Towe was pastor when the second Church deed was signed on May 2, 1922. Among other pastors were: Rev. Frank Culbreth; Rev. R. R. Grant; Rev. L. A. Watts with five years of service, the longest service in our Church history; Rev. W. G. Farrar; Rev. J. B. Hurley; Rev.\n\nJ. D. Robinson, and Rev. J. P. Pegg. In the Appendix of this book will be found the names and years of service of all the pastors of this era.\n\nReligious Plays and Pageants\n\nDuring the years 1932 through 1936 the Church, under the direction of Rev. L. A. Watts, inaugurated a series of religious plays and pageants. Where Sunday evening services were formerly attended only by the faithful few, the religious plays drew a “packed” house. Sometimes these religious dramatizations were jointly sponsored by both the Methodist and the Baptist Churches and presented in the Seaboard High School auditorium. Substantial collections were “split” between the two churches.\n\nIn order to make these religious plays look “authentic,” the director borrowed numerous unusual articles. A. K. Harris, local undertaker, loaned his green funeral carpet for “grass” effects. Bailey Maddrey was generous with the “Palms” that decorated his drugstore. Oriental scenes were made realistic with the aid of the neighbors’ lattices, bird baths and stone seats. Religious costumes were devised from bed-sheets and the congregation's best satin bed-spreads.\n\nIn this manner, Biblical plays, written by Bernice Kelly Harris, and pageants for special occasions brought alive the famous persons and events of Biblical times. Teachers, merchants, the Methodist pastor, farmers and housewives put aside their regular duties and became actors and actresses of great ability.\n\nInteresting Notes From Church Records\n\nMeager though are Church records are, Lucy Leake Spaine came up with some interesting notes about this period of Church history, 1922-1950.\n\nIn 1925, the District Conference appointed the following to serve on important Church committees:\n\nEntertainment:J. L. Harris, Dean S. Crocker and S. V. EdwardsArrangements:Mrs. Lottie S. Barbee and Mrs. Minnie CrockerParsonage:Mrs. Bertha Parker, Mrs. Bernice C. Edwards, J. L. HarrisUshers:Bruce Jones and James Harris\n\nIn 1929, a Church record shows the following persons served the Church:\n\nD. S. Crocker, Secretary of Quarterly ConferenceStewards:R. W. Edwards, A. K. Harris, W. J. Jones, D. S. Crocker and J. H. RamsayTrustees:G. F. Crocker and W. R. VickParsonage Trustees:J. L. Harris, H. C. Maddrey, R. W. Edwards, G. F. Crocker\n\nIn 1930, the first central heating plant was installed in the Church. Formerly, faithful Church members, bundled in heavy suits and coats, huddled around coal stoves when winter set in. With the new heating plant installed, Church attendance increased during the winter months and the women members were able to display their “Sunday” dresses.\n\nIn 1932, Rev. R. R. Grant, pastor, organized the first Epworth League. Young people quickly joined in the League's spiritual and social activities.\n\nThe 1932 Stewards were: R. W. Edwards, A. K. Harris, J. H. Ramsay, and Mrs. Lottie S. Barbee.\n\nThe year 1940 was a busy one. The Church dedication was being planned for August. But there was no carpet on the floor.\n\nAll during the year, the women worked furiously to raise the money to buy the carpet. They sold hot dogs, cakes and pies. They held rummage sales of all kinds.\n\nTo the wonder of all, the women raised enough funds to buy the “longed-for” carpet. It arrived on the eve of the Church dedication. But undaunted, the women worked through the night before the Church dedication Sunday, putting down their beautiful new carpet on the floor of the aisles and in the pulpit and choir loft. Husbands and sons assisted them, so tough was the job.\n\nSunday dawn found the Church in readiness for the great event. And the weary yet happy “carpet-layers” were proudly on hand for the dedication, though bleary-eyed and suffering from headaches as well as backaches.\n\nAnother event of significance in 1940 was the introduction of “The Upper Room,” a Church publication. Copies were ordered for the entire membership and this little pamphlet brought joy and comfort to many.\n\nRecords for 1940-1941 show the following leaders:\n\nStewards: R. W. Edwards, J. H. Ramsay, A. K. Harris and Dr. John W. Parker, Jr.\n\nTrustees: G. F. Crocker, A. K. Harris and R. W. Edwards\n\nSunday School Superintendent: A. L. Ford\n\nGolden Cross Chairman: Dr. John W. Parker, Jr.\n\nThen came the World War II years. With 22 young men in service, the women of the Church gave of their time to Red Cross work, making bandages, knitting sweaters and socks. Women also made it their business to see that the young men in the Navy, Air Force and Army received newsy, cheerful letters from their Church.\n\nThe Bible Reading plan was also started during the war years and the members responded well.\n\nThough war news and war activities consumed most of the members’ time and thought, they raised funds to paint the inside of the parsonage in 1943 and to add needed furnishings.\n\nBy 1946, the young men were returning home from World War II and the Church took on new life and new activities. The Unified Budget system was organized by the pastor, Rev. J. D. Robinson, 1946. The Young Men's Bible Class was formed in 1946, and in 1947 its members built an out-door fireplace on the Church grounds.\n\nIn 1951, S. V. Edwards, who had served so long and so faithfully as Sunday School Superintendent, retired from active service. Church members reluctantly accepted his resignation but—“Stoney” said: “It's time for younger men and women to assume their Church responsibilities.”\n\nIt was, therefore, in 1951, that “the old order yielded, making way for the new.” And a young war veteran, Reid Vick Harris, became Sunday School Superintendent. He served ably and faithfully until 1957 when illness forced him to retire.\n\nIn Memoriam\n\n1922-1950\n\nMrs. Hattie P. Rose1923Miss Edna I. Long1936Dr. M. R. Stephenson1924Herbert W.

The Third Era\n\nAs mid-century approached, the Church leadership of the Twenties, Thirties and Forties yielded to a younger generation. Young men who served in World War II had returned home, fired with enthusiasm to do something to help improve their Church and community as well. Furthermore, many were already married or soon to marry. And new families were on their way. Young mothers quickly realized the value of a good Sunday School and they, too, took on their duties as responsible leaders.\n\nChurch Renovation Starts In 1949\n\nIn 1949, the first meeting to discuss the Church renovation program was held in the office of Dr. John W. Parker, Jr. The goal of $7500 was set. Some said this amount of money could never be raised. But the Young Men's Class, organized in 1946, and eager to make a substantial contribution, rallied behind the program. Surprisingly, $10,000 was raised, with most members contributing according to their financial ability.\n\nThe Building Committee\n\nReid Vick Harris was elected Chairman of the Building Committee. With the full support of Rev. J. P. Pegg, pastor, the Building program made a fast start. Oldsters could scarcely believe that the “children” of yester-years were the able, hardworking young leaders of today.\n\nThe necessary renovations were done first. But the Committee always had in the back of its mind the purchase of an organ, if only enough money was forthcoming.\n\nThe following things were done immediately:\n\nNew Furnace$2,800.00Painting Church Inside and Outside985.33Sheet Metal Work770.96New Light Fixtures418.04\n\nAfter the above improvements were made and paid for, the Committee was elated to find there was enough money in the building fund to purchase an electric Organ and Tubular Chimes. Mrs. Lottie S. Barbee was appointed to select an organ. She made trips to various organ companies and decided on a Wurlitzer. The cost of organ and chimes amounted to $3887.19.\n\nNew Choir, Robes, Rehearsals\n\nIn 1950, the church lost the faithful service of Mrs. Lottie S. Barbee as organist and choir director after 31 years of loyal service. Special recognition was given her by the Pastor, Rev. J. P. Pegg. Due to Mrs. Barbee's resignation, Miss Etheleen Carr, local public school music teacher, offered her services as organist and pianist. Under the supervision of Mrs. Annie Taylor Bass, a new choir was organized and regular rehearsals were held.\n\nMuch enthusiasm was shown when the church offered to buy choir robes for the members. Material was bought and the 18 robes were made by Mrs. Margaret Simon in Weldon. After her marriage in 1951 to Walter Rowell, Mrs. Etheleen Carr Rowell gave up her position as organist and joined Pleasant Grove Church with her husband. The church was really at a loss to know where to find someone to take her place. Mrs.\n\nAnnie Taylor Bass was called on to fill in until some other arrangement could be made. Mrs. Bass is still today's organist and pianist, rendering effective service for both the Sunday School and the Service of Worship.\n\nRegular rehearsals have been discontinued but on special occasions at Christmas, Easter, etc., the choir rehearses and brings special music at the Service of Worship. Due to the lack of trained voices in the Methodist Choir, members of the Seaboard Baptist Choir and the Pleasant Grove Methodist Choir assist in rendering special music at revival services and on other special occasions.\n\nSpecial recognition should go to Mrs. Lillian B. Ramsay for her many years of faithful service in the choir. Her beautiful alto voice can be heard in the choir every Sunday when she can attend. She is always the first to come when practice is announced. Members of the choir now are: Mrs. Lillian B. Ramsay, Mrs. Elizabeth B. Bullock, Mrs. Mary Taylor Mumford, Mrs. Cleo M. White, Mrs. Mable Hughes, Ruby Little, Rachel Little, Linda White, Judy Irvin, James T. Edwards, J. P. Spencer, Richard Hughes, Tom Flythe and W. J. Jones. Mrs. Annie Taylor Bass is both organist and choir director.\n\nMemorials\n\nA Brass Cross was given by Mr. and Mrs. E. H. Stephenson in 1958 in memory of their son, Edward Vassar Stephenson, who lost his life in World War II.\n\nBrass candle sticks were given in 1958 by Mrs. W. G. Edwards in memory of Harry Samuel Clark, her brother, who came to Seaboard in 1948 to make his home with her. He was a member of the Weldon Methodist Church but after coming here, he was a faithful worker in this church as long as his health permitted.\n\nA Sterling Silver Baptismal Bowl was given by Mrs. Bertha Parker in 1958 in memory of her husband, Dr. C. P. Parker.\n\nA roll of sacred music was given by Walter D. Barbee and wife, Katherine, in memory of Lottie Stephenson Barbee.\n\nPastors\n\nRev. J. P. Pegg led the Church into mid-century. In 1952, a young and dedicated pastor, Rev. B. F. Musser, came in for a four-year term. He worked untiringly with the young leaders and encouraged the oldsters to support their efforts.\n\nRev. R. S. Gibson served in 1956 and 1957 during the Annex building program. As the Church now dedicates its handsome new Educational Annex, Rev. C. Manes Mitchell is serving his first year.\n\nChurch Weddings—1940 - 1958\n\nEdith Langston Warrick to Benjamin Council Bunn, May 31, 1940, by the Rev. J. B. Hurley.\n\nNancy Hudson Barbee to William Henry Weed Crawford II, December 21, 1940, by the Rev. L. A. Watts.\n\nMarie Duke to Carl Langford Bradshaw, Sept. 1, 1941, by the Rev. J. B. Hurley.\n\nEllen Carlton Maddrey to Charles Walker Davis, Jr., June 7, 1947, by the Rev. L. A. Watts.\n\nJean Crocker Maddrey to Hugh Hayes Wilson, Jr., December 20, 1947, by the Rev. L. A.

Earl Edwards.\n\nJoyce Ann Burton to Jeffe Bernard Myers, Jr., December 20, 1954, by the Rev. B. F. Musser.\n\nProgress at Mid-Century\n\nThe period from 1950 to 1958 saw perhaps the greatest number of improvements in our Church and parsonage since the present building was completed. The change over from hot-water heat to an economical quick-recovery hot-air system for the church was done on the advice of Ivan White. The Sunday School class rooms were painted, decorated and the floors finished. The bathrooms, recreation room, and kitchen were tiled, and a bulletin board, blackboards and furniture purchased.\n\nThe parsonage came in for a share of improvements also. The dining room and living room were painted, decorated and carpeted. The roof and exterior walls were painted and a half bath completed downstairs. A central heating system was also installed and a cabinet sink added to the kitchen.\n\nThis work was financed by pledges and gifts from members. A generous gift was bequeathed to the church in the will of the beloved Mrs. Maie Vick Crocker and $1,000.00 was donated by the Duke Endowment Fund.\n\nThe church has gone forward in the interest of Methodism as well as in Church and parsonage improvements. In January, 1956, six members of the Seaboard Circuit presented a review of the book, “High Hours of Methodism in Town and Country”, before the congregations of Sharon, Pleasant Grove and Seaboard Methodist Churches. They were: Mrs. Frances Ramsay Magee, Mrs. P. A. Bullock, Millard Carpenter, Jr., Mrs. John W. Boone, Sr., Mrs. Mary Frances Stephenson Draper, and L. W. Piland.\n\nThe Woman's Society of Christian Service has also participated in study courses and other activities in Conference, Circuit and Church. Each year Woman's Society of Christian Service members write wonderful letters of encouragement and\n\nappreciation to students and other young people away from home. Their letters, cards, flowers, gifts and visits keep our Methodist Church alive in the hearts and homes of the community.\n\nOfficers of the Seaboard\n\nMethodist Church—1958\n\nAs we look at the names of the Church officers today—1958—we find the names of families who served our Church in its early years: Harris, Edwards, Ramsay, Spencer, Parker, Stephenson. Other names represent families who later moved into our community and became active leaders in our Church: Bullock, White, Draper, Long, Magee.\n\nOrganizational Changes in 1952\n\nIn 1952, the General Conference of the Methodist Church made changes in the organization of the local churches. The Quarterly Conference remains the basic body of control that it has been since the early days of Methodism. But there is no longer a “Board of Stewards” in the Church. The Stewards are now a part of the “Official Board” which is the administrative body of the local church. The Official Board provides broader representation as well as more definite division of responsibility. The Official Board of the Seaboard Methodist Church in 1958 is as follows:\n\nPastor: Rev. C. Maness Mitchell.\n\nTrustees: George W. Harris until 1959; Reid Vick Harris until 1960; Dr. John W. Parker, Jr. until 1960; and J. G. Long until 1961.\n\nStewards: Mrs. P. A. Bullock, James E. Edwards, R. W. Edwards, Jr., S. V. Edwards, Reid Vick Harris, J. M. Magee, Mrs. Bertha Parker, Dr. John W. Parker, Jr., Morrison Ramsay, J. P. Spencer, Jr., and Ivan B. White.\n\nEx-Officio Stewards: The following are ex-officio Stewards by virtue of their office in the Church:\n\n—Church Lay Leader: B. R. Bullock\n\n—Church School Superintendent: T. J.

Its Sunday School\n\nTHE Sunday School of the Seaboard Methodist Church had its persistent struggle to keep alive in its early days. It was an uphill fight against “weather,” “apathy” and “small collections.”\n\nOn October 12th, 1890, a report was given at the Church Conference that “68 scholars were on roll and had an average attendance of 50% but didn't think that the Church was fully alive to the importance of this grand work.”\n\nSuperintendent T. B. Rose reported on February 11, 1900, that the attendance at Sunday School “was not as good as desired; but in some measure due to bad weather.”\n\nThe Church records reveal, however, that the Sunday School “survived” its early struggles and went on to become a “healthy” part of the whole Church program. It's true that “weather” and “apathy” have occasionally attacked the members through the years, but inspired leadership and good organization have eventually relieved them of such onsets.\n\nMemorable Occasions of the Yester-Years\n\nThe oldsters of the Sunday School recall with pleasant memories the annual outing at Ocean View, Virginia. Long before dawn, parents and children arrived at the train station to board the excursion train. Ladened with picnic baskets crammed with chicken, ham, deviled eggs, pickles and cake, happy families made the round-trip to Portsmouth, Virginia, and back at the price of $1.00 for adults and 50 cents for children. Buses delivered the families to Ocean View where they “bathed” in the ocean, rode on the leap-the-dip and ate until they nearly popped. As they boarded the train for the return trip, the men usually\n\nThe Sunday School 1958 (NAMES OF PERSONS IN PICTURE ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE)\n\nThe Sunday School — 1958 Among those in front of building are: Mrs. R.

On one occasion, the Seaboard congregation was let off some distance from the station. Rain was falling in torrents as the families struggled home with their children. But even such a drenching did nothing to dampen their ardor for the next year's excursion.\n\nAnother recreational feature sponsored by the Sunday School, in the days before the automobile, electric lights and movies, consisted of a series of summer-evening lawn parties held on a vacant lot now owned by the Gay boys. Japanese lanterns, hung in the Mimosa trees, cast a soft glow over the young people who came together for an evening of fun. Some couples who met at the parties later married and became residents of the community. Mr. W. J. Jones and Miss Fannie Gay were such a couple.\n\nThese lawn parties were similar to the noon-day festivities of the all-day “revivals” held at the country churches. As was usual, tables were heaped with good things to eat and the happy evening passed too quickly for the oldsters and youngsters.\n\nChildren's Days and Christmas programs brought the Methodist and Baptist Churches into joint activities. Such occasions were “trying” times to proud parents and church leaders. Special “outfits” were made by mothers who vied with each other in designing costumes for their offspring. Poems were learned. Songs were memorized. And occasionally, some child who couldn‘t carry a tune persisted in singing a solo.\n\n“Jesus Wants Me For a Sunbeam” was the “hit” song for Children's Day, while “Silent Night” dominated Christmas\n\nprograms. Many of the bolder youngsters preferred something more sprightly, but they were quickly frowned down.\n\nAt one Christmas program, the elders thought it would be a good idea to place the children on home-made benches in front of the altar, since children were the most important people at the program.\n\nThe children, therefore, dutifully arrayed themselves on the benches made of new pine boards, right in front of the altar, where smiling parents could observe them.\n\nThe smiles, however, were quickly doomed. As each “performer” arose to do his or her number, “rip” went the seat of the boys’ pants and “rip” went the little girls’ frills. All on account of the sticky rosin on the new pine benches. So that marked the end of the “angels” on new pine benches.\n\nSunday School Classes\n\nSunday School excursions, lawn parties, Children's Days, and Christmas festivities were indeed important features of the early Sunday School programs. But learning Sunday School lessons and giving the correct answers were duties required of young and old. Saturday night was not only “bathing night,” it was also the night when we learned our Sunday School lesson and “recited” the answers to our parents. No “scholar” would dare sit “unlearned” before Mrs. Aggie Edwards who taught the young people for 40 years. “The purpose of Sunday School,” she used to say, “is to learn the Bible.” And woe be unto those who didn't want to learn!\n\nAdult Classes\n\nSeaboard Methodist Church has been blessed with many good Sunday School teachers. Early teachers of the Adult Classes were excellent students of the Bible. Among them\n\nwere: J. A. Millar, the first teacher; J. G. L. Crocker; W. R. Vick; T. B. Rose; and Dr. M. R. Stephenson.\n\nLater, Adult Class teachers were: G. F. Crocker, Mrs. Martha B. Maddrey, Mrs. Robert E. Vick, Mrs. Ruth Vick O'Brien, and Mrs. P. A. Bullock.\n\nToday three able teachers teach the Lottie Stephenson Women's Class: Mrs. P. A. Bullock, who has taught for 19 years in both the Adult Department and Women's Class; Mrs. C. G. Matthews, for seven years; and Mrs. Joe Magee.\n\nThe following highly capable young men teach, by terms of a quarter each, the Men's Class: L. S. Ford, George W. Harris, R. W. Edwards, Jr., James Taylor Edwards, J. P. Spencer, Jr., and B. R. Bullock.\n\nThe Men's Bible Class was organized in 1946 by Rev. John D. Robinson, Pastor, who launched the program at a supper in the parsonage. Until then, both men and women constituted the Adult Class.\n\nYoung People's Class\n\nMrs. Nellie Moore was the first young people's teacher. Mrs. J. G. L. Crocker came next. Then followed Mrs. Aggie Edwards, who taught for 40 years. Among others who came later were: Mrs. C. P. Parker, Mrs. G. F. Crocker, Edward V. Stephenson, Mrs. Zena Vick Harris, Miss Pauline Edwards, Mrs. D. S. Crocker and Mrs. John W. Parker, Jr. Today's teacher of the Young People's class is Mrs. Thomas J. Draper, with nine years of service.\n\nChildren's Classes\n\nAmong the teachers with long terms of service in the Children's Classes are: Mrs. J. H. Ramsay, seven years; and Mrs. W. D. Barbee, 10 years. When the Children's Division was organized\n\nin 1937, with three classes, Mrs. J. H. Ramsay was Superintendent of the whole division. She was followed by Mrs. C. L. Vick, Mrs. Robert E. Vick, Mrs. B. R. Bullock, and Mrs. I. B. White.\n\nFormer teachers are: Jean Maddrey Wilson, Mrs. J. T. Edwards, Mrs. R. W. Edwards, Jr., and Mrs. Harvey Irvin, who has taught for eight years.\n\nToday's children's teachers are: Mrs. W. P. Edwards, Jr., with three years of service; Mrs. I. B. White, with four years; and Mrs. Andrew H. Taylor, with six years of service; and Mrs. B. R. Bullock, with fifteen years of service.\n\nThe interest of the teachers in their children is shown by this letter to Mr. and Mrs. J. T. Edwards, from Steve's teacher:\n\nGumberry, N. C.\n\nOctober 3, 1958\n\nDear Jim and Betty:\n\nThe words that I would like to say to you just do not seem to come. I have had Steve in my Primary Class for three years now and, my, how short they have been! I have seen him grow from Sunday to Sunday into a fine young man. I can only hope that he has found the pleasure and knowledge with me there that I have found in him. No teacher could possibly say that a child of Primary age has behaved perfectly every Sunday. There were, of course, some Sundays when the solemnity and reverence of the church could not confine his energy. But as the Sundays have progressed, I have seen Steve become increasingly aware of the meanings of our lessons and of the importance of the Church. I know that the future holds many wonderful things for Steve as he continues to grow in the church and in a fine Christian home. We have the privilege of helping our children grow as Jesus grew “. . . in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man.” It is my hope and prayer that we, as parents, can assure our children such splendid growth.\n\nWe will all miss Steve in our class, but we hope he will be happy in Junior Class.\n\nSincerely,\n\nShirley W. Taylor\n\nSunday School Superintendents\n\nUpon the shoulders of the Sunday School Superintendents falls the responsibility of leadership and organization. Superintendents of the Methodist Sunday School have always been able, dedicated men. Most of them have served long years. The Church owes them an everlasting debt of gratitude.\n\nHere is a list of some of these fine leaders:\n\nJ. B. Farmer1885A. L. Ford1928-1930A. B. Daughtry1888J. H. Ramsay1930-1931T. B. Rose1900A.

Jones1917\n\nVacation Church School\n\nIn 1947, the Baptist Vacation Bible School and the Methodist Vacation Church School began as a joint project. At first, teachers had to provide their own materials and plan their work. This program has continued each summer, first in one Church and then in the other. As time passed, materials were bought and the Schools were properly planned. The 1958 Bible School continued as a joint Vacation School, using the facilities of both Churches. Around 70 children attended.\n\nThe teachers from our Church were: Mrs. C. G. Matthews, Leader; Mrs. R. C. Spaine, Secretary and Treasurer; Mrs. B. R. Bullock, Mrs. A. H. Taylor, Miss Linda White, and Mrs. Thomas J. Draper. On each day of Bible School, refreshments were served by the Missionary Circles from both Churches.\n\nNumber on Sunday School Roll in 1958\n\nLottie S.

No longer do the members fear the fall of the swinging oil lamps on their heads. No longer is there an “Amen” corner with its echoes of “Amens” given to long-winded pastors who disturbed pleasant naps with threats of fire and brimstone.\n\nBut to oldsters who come back from time to time, there is nothing lost in the zeal and determination of the Church leaders to preserve the Sunday School as “the place to teach the Bible,” as well as to provide wholesome recreation for its members.\n\nOur Church . . .
