        "text": "WEST\n\nCALIFORNIA: MONITOR REPORTS ON LOS ANGELES POLICE\n\nA backlog of misconduct complaints and low morale may hinder the Los Angeles Police Department's reform efforts, an independent monitor has found. The report was released on Monday by Michael Cherkasky, who was appointed under a consent degree with the Justice Department. Mr. Cherkasky urged the department to speed its processing of complaints.\n\n(AP)\n\nSOUTHWEST\n\nTEXAS: ENDORSEMENT IN HOUSTON\n\nFormer President George W. Bush waded into local politics with an endorsement of Orlando Sanchez, the conservative Houston mayoral candidate, over Mayor Lee Brown, the city's first black mayor. The race, to be decided in a Dec. 1 runoff, is the first in a major American city to pit a Hispanic candidate against a black one and has drawn the attention of the national parties even though it is officially a nonpartisan election.\n\n(Reuters)\n\nSOUTH\n\nNORTH CAROLINA: CONGRESSWOMAN WILL STEP DOWN\n\nRepresentative Eva Clayton, the first woman to win a Congressional seat from North Carolina and one of the first two black members to do so since Reconstruction, said she would retire next year after five terms. A Democrat, Ms. Clayton, 67, is a member of the House Agriculture Committee, winning top ratings from liberal groups. A political ally, State Senator Frank Ballance, said he was considering running for her First District seat.\n\nDavid Firestone (NYT)\n\nARKANSAS: G.O.P. RETAINS VACANT SEAT\n\nRepublicans held on to a Congressional seat left vacant when Asa Hutchinson resigned to head the Drug Enforcement Administration. A Democrat has not won the northwestern Arkansas district since 1964. The Republican candidate to serve the final 13 months of the term, John Boozman, had 55 percent of the vote, with 96 percent of precincts counted, to 43 percent for the Democratic candidate, Mike Hathorn."
