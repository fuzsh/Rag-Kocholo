The committee met, pursuant to other business, at 10:30 a.m. in room 406, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. John H. Chafee (chairman of the committee) presiding. Present: Senators Chafee, Crapo, Reid, Baucus, and Graham. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN H. CHAFEE, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND Senator Chafee. I want the welcome everyone here this morning. I'm excited about the hearings today and tomorrow on open space and environmental quality. These hearings mark the beginning of a close, extended look by this committee on the issues of open space, sprawl, and their relation to environmental quality. The opening round of hearings has two purposes: first, to provide an introduction to the issues and the vigorous debates surrounding them; second, to provide an opportunity to explore specific Federal proposals that are likely to be raised during the consideration of the budget resolution, which will come up on the floor of the Senate very soon. Much attention has been given to the subject of open space and development in recent months as a result of the resounding success of State and local ballot initiatives across the country and numerous Federal proposals following on the heels of these initiatives. I might say, in my State, it doesn't make any difference whether it's the State or the local community putting a bond issue for open space on the ballot, they receive tremendous support--as high as 60 percent or 70 percent of the voters. The ballot initiatives presume that there is a problem to solve, and the Federal proposals presume there is a role for the Federal Government. Before making these presumptions, we must first look at the nature, extent, and consequences of land development, particularly so-called ``sprawl.'' Land development has been described as a three-legged stool composed of the community, the economy, and the environment. With respect to the last leg, environment, sprawl can have a profound effect on environmental quality, including water quality, air quality, traffic congestion, wildlife and natural habitat, and waste disposal. When one dissects the issue of sprawl and its individual components, one is looking at a panoply of environmental subjects under the jurisdiction of this committee. The conservation of opening space has been one of the most important priorities for me throughout my career. When I was Governor of our State in the 1960's, I started a green acres program, in which the State government would provide matching funds--and, indeed, at that time we could get some Federal funds, likewise--to help the local communities preserve open space, and then, of course, we preserved open space on the State level. When I think of where I will spend my time when I leave the Senate, it is not going to be in the shopping malls. It is going to be in the wildlife refuges that we are blessed with in our State. I believe that the loss of open space occurring in parts of the Nation is a real problem. I believe the Federal Government does have a role in it. States like mine--and I'm sure the State of Idaho, likewise--can benefit greatly in their endeavors from Federal assistance. The most significant project is the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Last week I drafted a letter to the Budget Committee requesting full funding for this fund, the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The letter was cosigned by 35 colleagues in the Senate. Smaller Federal programs also exist, and both Senators and the President believe there is an opportunity for a greater Federal role. It seems to me we should have a better sense of the nature and consequences of sprawl and the efforts by local and State and private organizations to address it. The hearings over the next 2 days will explore these issues. We've got a splendid group of witnesses, and I'm eager to hear their testimony. Senator Crapo, we welcome you here. If you've got a few comments, now is a good time. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL D. CRAPO, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF IDAHO Senator Crapo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll be very brief. I appreciate the attention you are giving to this issue. You are correct that there is a lot of potential for good to be done through these types of initiatives. Obviously, one of the concerns that we all have is to make sure that the Federal Government doesn't impose too much on State and local decisionmaking in those types of matters, but the assistance that can be provided is often invaluable. We have been able to use the Land and Water Conservation Fund very effectively in Idaho in some cases, and I think that looking at how to best utilize those funds in a way that does not increase Federal Government holdings of property to the reduction of private property holdings, but instead in a way which preserves and strengthens our open spaces and the tremendous environmental heritage we have in this country is the approach we ought to be taking, and I commend you for your efforts. [The prepared statement of Senator Crapo follows:] STatement of Hon. Michael D. Crapo, U.S. Senator from the State of Idaho Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the issues of open space, land use planning, and environmental quality and thank you for providing this forum. There are currently a number of proposals before the Senate that would take major steps, commit a significant amount of new funding, and, in some cases, create new Federal programs to address these issues. Most of these proposals would create a permanent funding stream through the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). I agree with the proponents of these bills that we have a responsibility to ourselves and future generations to preserve, protect, and enhance our natural environment and am pleased that these issues are being given the attention that they deserve. As we move forward in consideration of these measures, it is, however, important that we be mindful of all of the potential impacts that the proposed increase in funding and programs will have, especially on the autonomy of State and local governments. We must ensure that Federal assistance through such legislation is structured so as to complement and support, but not direct or inhibit, local decisions and priorities. We must further emphasize that, while the Federal Government has a proper role in LWCF-assisted projects that are used to provide incentives, such as scenic or conservation easements, for private property owners to achieve recreation or environmental goals on their own land that benefit the public, increased Federal land ownership and increased Federal involvement in local planning decisions is not necessary to achieve recreation and conservation goals. As the debate continues as to how best to manage the LWCF, I will work for proposals that meet recreation and conservation goals by involving State and local governments and private landowners without unnecessarily increasing Federal land holdings. Most importantly, however, as we consider new projects and funding under the auspices of the LWCF, we must first honor existing commitments made by the United States for the funding of conservation and scenic easements. In Public Law 92-4000, for example, Congress established the Sawtooth National Recreation Area ``to assure the preservation and protection of the natural, scenic, historic, pastoral, and fish and wildlife values and to provide for the enhancement of the recreational values associated herewith,'' and authorized the purchase of scenic easements to achieve these goals. Unfortunately, for numerous years, willing sellers and landowners interested in signing easement agreements were stalled by lack of funding. I have fought in recent years for this funding to become available and have made some progress. I have also, however, discovered that land has since changed hands, or landowners have become tired of waiting, and the land is therefore no longer available. This situation is lamentable and I would hope that as we move forward in considering legislation to increase funding for the LWCF, we include recognition of existing outstanding commitments that should be honored before new projects are sought out. Senator Chafee. Well, thank you. It is interesting, because you and I have discussed this and I know you are concerned about what is happening in your major city. You and I have discussed that. And frequently the view is that, ``Oh, the westerners don't want the government in this at all,'' but you indicated that the Federal Government could be of a help to you in solving the problem that you are facing, particularly in Boise. Senator Crapo. That's right, Mr. Chairman. And I think the key word there is ``help.'' The concern that we all have in the west is that we don't need to have overly burdensome Federal rules and regulations that tell us all how we should govern ourselves, but the assistance that can be provided in the right way through these resources can be very helpful. And that's the kind of legislation I think we need to work toward. Senator Chafee. Thank you. Our first panel consists of: The Honorable Paul Helmke, mayor of Fort Wayne, Indiana, past president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors; and The Honorable Terry Kauffman, chairman, Board of Commissioners, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. If you gentlemen would please come to the table--and, Senator Reid, I don't know whether you had a comment at this time, but if you had anything you want to say---- OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. HARRY REID, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEVADA Senator Reid. Mr. Chairman, I have a statement I'd like to make part of the record, and I also--later today there is going to be some information that I'm tremendously interested in, and the question is I have another hearing, so I'm going to have to come and go. I'm very appreciative of your scheduling this. I can't think of anything that is more important that we could do than work on this urban sprawl, and Las Vegas is the picture child for urban sprawl. We have so much growth there that we need all the help we can get. Senator Chafee. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Senator Reid follows:] Statement of Hon. Harry Reid, U.S. Senator from the State of Nevada Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was sorry to hear earlier this week that this committee and the U.S. Senate will be losing one of its finest members and greatest leaders at the end of next year. During the years that you have been chairman, the environment has known no better friend in Congress than you, Senator Chafee. Your leadership will be sorely missed. This committee has long had the reputation for being the most nonpartisan on Capital Hill, a tradition you have upheld with great honor, Mr. Chairman. I can only hope that the next chairman of this committee will be able to live up to the standard you have set. However, there is still much work to be done and I am glad that you have chosen to turn to this fascinating and important subject for today's hearing. In this committee we work on some of the most complex, scientific, technical, and, at times, obscure material imaginable. However, today we are going to begin a dialog on something pretty straightforward: Quality of Life. We are going to call it a lot of different things: The Livability Agenda, Open Space Protection, sprawl, smart growth, and Lands Legacy. But they all describing the quality of life issues that face so many of us today, particularly those of us who live in urban or suburban areas. Our challenge is to find the tools and resources that our communities need to ensure that our cities and towns can grow and develop in the ways that its residents want. These challenges are incredible and interrelated. Problems of congestion, poor air and water quality, issues of water quantity, waste disposal, and sewage treatment are all problems of modern life that communities struggle with. Nevada as a State is one of the fastest growing in the country. Las Vegas is one of the nation's fastest growing cities. 5000--7000 new people call Nevada home each month, many of them settling into the Las Vegas Valley. With this growth, which has been wonderful for Nevada, has come many of the problems that we have begun to associate with ``livability'' issues. People move to Nevada and to Las Vegas for the wonderful quality of life, so it is incumbent upon Nevadans to make sure that standard of living is maintained. During her recent campaign for Governor, Las Vegas Mayor Jan Jones made livability issues and urban sprawl a centerpiece of her campaign. Like so many other areas nationwide, the communities of the Las Vegas Valley have begun to work together on regional solutions to many of these tricky problems. Just last month, the Southern Nevada Strategic Planning Authority released its plan for responsible growth in the Valley. This is a several hundred page document dedicated to responsibly and creatively answering the question: ``What will Southern Nevada look like 20 years from now?'' Mr. Chairman, I am looking forward to our field hearing on this subject in Las Vegas later this Spring. We are going to pack the hearing room with citizens and local officials, all of whom are eager to share with you the many unique and innovative things local people are doing in Southern Nevada to make it a wonderful place to call home now and for many years to come. One thing I am sure they will tell us: If the Federal Government has good ideas or resources to devote to these livability issues, then they want our help. Otherwise, they just want us to get out of the way. Let me be clear about one important thing: I am not sitting here today as an advocate of some system of Federal zoning or any other such nonsense. I don't think that any of my colleagues are, either. I am saying, however, that the Federal Government has a role to play, particularly with so much development currently taking place in coastal areas, flood plains, or, in the case of Nevada, on land that borders on Federal property (and probably used to be Federal property) In many parts of the West, the Federal Government has been a not- so-great absentee landlord. Communities have developed as much according to Federal land use policy as they have according to local land use policy. It has not always been a great way to go. Before concluding, I am delighted to see such great attention being focused upon the various proposals to boost the Land and Water Conservation Fund and other land management funds. We cannot continue to ignore the impacts of development on sensitive areas. The LWCF has been critical to the efforts of the California and Nevada congressional delegations to protect and preserve Lake Tahoe. These funds have been used in dozens of other States for similar conservation purposes. LWCF is a tremendously worthwhile program. One area that has not been addressed in any great detail in any of the LWCF proposals I have seen thus far is our National Parks. We are literally loving our National Parks to death and Senator Graham and I hope to be able to work with all of you that have drafted LWCF proposals to see about doing something more than we are doing to protect sensitive and important areas within the Park System. Thank you for your indulgence, Mr. Chairman. As you can see, it is possible to cover a lot of ground on this topic. Thank you, again for holding this important hearing. Senator Chafee. Mayor, we welcome you here. You go to it. STATEMENT OF HON. PAUL HELMKE, MAYOR, FORT WAYNE, INDIANA, PAST PRESIDENT, U.S. CONFERENCE OF MAYORS Mayor Helmke. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Paul Helmke. I'm the mayor of Fort Wayne, Indiana. That's the second-largest city in the State of Indiana. I'm the immediate past president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. The whole issue of livability, of sprawl, of really what's going on in our communities today--smart growth, or whatever the catch words are--is a very important one to all of us. I might say, Mr. Chairman, too, that I was a candidate for U.S. Senate last year and had hoped to be sitting on the other side of the aisle here, but being mayor is a great job and Mayor Coles, I know, from Boise reflects that and the mayors in Rhode Island that I know well and Mayor Jones in Las Vegas are all very concerned about all these issues, and I'm happy to be here on behalf of the U.S. Conference of Mayors talking about these issues. I submitted a statement, and I don't want to read that statement, but I do want to touch on a few of the high points. First of all, when I talk to people in my community, when I talk to other mayors---- Senator Chafee. What's the population of Fort Wayne? Mayor Helmke. About 200,000. When I talk to people in my community, they are concerned about what I call ``front-door issues.'' They're concerned about what they see when they open their front door. Are the schools good? Is the traffic situation OK? Are the streets safe? Are their jobs secure? They're concerned about quality of life. Although I know what we do at all levels, what you do at this level is very important in terms of front-page issues, I think those front-door issues are just as important in terms of what Federal policies do to impinge on what my folks and what the folks in your cities see out their front door. It is my sense that, in the past, oftentimes we've had policies at the Federal level that end up having an anti-urban bias, that end up causing problems for people out their front doors, and that's why I think it is important to have this discussion about livability, about environment, about open space. I think there are a few things that really show this pretty clearly. One is the whole issue of brownfields. Brownfields are the abandoned industrial sites that are in every city and town in America. It can be the abandoned gas station. It can be the old factory. And these are sites that really, I think, reflect a lot of this discussion. I think one of the best things we can do to preserve open space is to find a way to help redevelop the brownfield sites. And a lot of that deals with the legislation that has been talked about, that has been proposed by you, Mr. Chairman, and proposed by Congressman Boehlert on the House side, that deals with changing the liability rules so that we don't just worry about who we are going to be suing, but we worry about how we are affecting our neighborhoods, how we make it easier for developers and investors and private sector, public sector, not-for-profit sector to come in and redevelop these brownfield sites. I think, as a country, we've learned that it is important to recycle glass and aluminum and paper. We need to recycle our land, and there are Federal policies that have made it difficult to do this, so I think the whole issue of brownfields is an important one. One of the statistics that I mention in my text is taken from the American farmland trust. This was part of a report that the U.S. Conference of Mayors issued a year ago. During the 10-year period from 1982 to 1992, the United States converted more than four million acres of prime farmland to urban land. This is the prime farmland, the good soybean fields, corn fields that we've got in Indiana. That's an area that's larger in size than the entire greater Chicago metropolitan area, which runs from southern Wisconsin into Indiana. It's an area equal in size to the States of Connecticut and Rhode Island combined. Mayor Daley, a former head of our organization, uses the quote a lot that the U.S. destroys more farmland each year than any nation on earth. In that same 10-year period, 1982 to 1992, all of the land developed, not just the prime farmland, was equal in size to the States of Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, and one-quarter of Maryland. I think, when you look at those sorts of statistics, even though there is a lot of open space, particularly in the west, we still need to be careful about what we're doing with our land. I think the brownfields issue is one that needs to be talked about as a way to preserve open space, to make sure that people are staying close to where they want to work, that we're not contributing to sprawl, that we're not contributing to pollution. I think transportation issues are also crucial. What we've done oftentimes is contribute to the problem of sprawl with the way that we've spent the transportation dollars. From the U.S. Conference of Mayors' perspective, if we could give more flexibility to local communities on how they are going to spend it, get the money directly to local communities so we don't have to fight with the Governors and the legislatures to make sure that we're doing the things that we think at the local level are best able to help it. A recent survey by one of the groups that is concerned about reinvesting in America found that most people are more concerned with putting more money into fixing the streets and the roads they already have than building new streets and roads. People are concerned about public transit and how we get to work from where folks live, so that's a crucial issue. The parks issue that you mentioned, Senator, is a crucial one to us, too. Oftentimes, we love our national parks, but the crucial park for most of my citizens isn't the national park, it's the park across the street, the park down the block. We need to put some of that money into our local parks, too. So I salute you for addressing these issues. This is something where I think it is appropriate to take a Federal role, to look for a Federal partnership. The Federal role in the past has caused some problems, and I think we can correct that we a good open discussion and find out what we can do with brownfields, transportation, environmental programs, so we really do address those front-door issues. Thank you for the opportunity to be here today. Senator Chafee. Well, thank you very much, Mayor. We'll all have some questions for you when we finish up. Now we're going to hear from Mr. Terry Kauffman, who is chairman of the Board of Commissioners, Lancaster County, PA, which I suspect is an area of considerable growth. STATEMENT OF THE HON. TERRY KAUFFMAN, CHAIRMAN, BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS, LANCASTER COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA Mr. Kauffman. It is. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I actually today represent the National Association of Counties. Obviously, as the mayor would have said, our first priority is our home, however, and remember that. I first want to also echo our support of what the mayor has said, and the efforts between the National Association of Counties and the Conference of Mayors to try to address these issues. Quality of life concerns, as the mayor said, the high cost of providing those services and infrastructure--and in our case in Lancaster County, many other areas have loss of farmland, and our environmental resources are topping the list of many of my colleagues throughout the country. And increasingly, whether we want to or not--and some of us probably want to more than others--we are being called upon to make the difficult decisions in this arena. Our local citizens come first to the local elected officials to say, ``This is a quality of life. We're losing farmland. We don't have parks. We don't have traffic.'' We have been asked to take a lead role in that, and we are looking for partnerships to develop new approaches to better direct the way we grow. The country, in general, also, I think, has highlighted and expanded its understanding, and, if not its understanding, it's awareness as citizens are concerned about what we call ``suburban sprawl.'' That could be described as an explosion of concern over our current use or growth patterns. What I really think it is, they're worried about change and how it affects the quality of life issues. Again, I applaud this committee for looking at those. In my county, suburban sprawl over the last three decades has depleted our farmland and natural resource base and threatened the lifestyle of our Amish and Mennonite communities, the things that we believe are the most unique and appealing for citizens to live there. Important on our list of growth-related problems is financial burden that residential sprawl is placing on county government, just as it is in our cities and our towns. Those are the areas which supply services and infrastructure to new housing, often without a corresponding tax base. We are aware that some are encouraging the Federal Government and State legislatures to take the decisions about land use out of the hands of local elected officials and place them in the hands of appointed regional bodies or State entities who would establish growth or planning policies applicable to our governments. State mandates and preemption are something that are scarce, but they are coming. For example, in Tennessee, counties and cities have been mandated to adopt State-designed growth plans by July of 2001. In Florida, State-appointed regional water districts have a great deal of authority to approve or deny certain land uses. In the opposite end of the spectrum, States like Virginia make it very difficult for counties to manage growth, requiring, for example, specific authorization from the legislature before a county is allowed to impose impact fees. The approach of the National Association of Counties, on whose behalf I am speaking today, is to better equip our counties and elected officials to make decisions about smart growth alternatives for themselves. What do we mean by ``smart growth''? NACO believes that includes efforts that accommodate growth in a way that integrates economic prosperity and environmental quality and affords to enhance the unique attributes of counties that are valued by the community. In particular, NACO supports comprehensive local land use planning as a mechanism for achieving smart growth. Because we believe that how we use our land directly affects our ability to maintain a high quality of life for existing and future residents, our board of directors recently listed smart growth as a priority issue for the next 3 years. We have been holding extraordinarily popular workshops within our NACO conferences and developing working team sessions, and we hear over and over and over again this is one of the primary concerns and issues facing county governments. At the same time, we look forward to partnerships with agencies and governments such as yourselves to help us guide our activities. At the same time, we recognize we derive our legal authority primarily from our State governments, and, without the necessary ability to control those land uses, we will remain limited in our ability to implement our comprehensive plans and smart growth initiatives. Every State has its own distinct land use structures. Some States simply fail to respect local autonomy and authority. On the Federal level, we see other policies that indirectly limit local land use decisionmaking. For example, in some areas, Federal facilities are placed without any correspondent view on how they affect local land use planning. There are a lot of models out there. In my county, we lack the authority of zoning, but, through intermunicipal agreements, we've developed a voluntary approach with our boroughs and towns and townships, through sheer persuasion and dollars, and convinced them to look at a unique planned effort by Lancaster County. There are other models as we go forward, other techniques, critical areas. Another growth management technique is the use of impact or development fees. I will say to you that that's controversial, but we have about 22 States which allow it, and it provides a timing issue. In other words, we don't have housing, we don't have hype, we don't have any growth until we have the infrastructure to support it. On the Federal level, we are hearing about some new, interesting proposals for additional funding and assistance. We look with favor on programs that assist us with acquiring land and purchasing rights, and we look forward, again, to a continuing expanded role. We would only caution, on behalf of NACO and counties, that Federal funding should be careful to respect local land use and decisionmaking. As we view these progress, will Federal growth management goals conflict with the goals we have established within our communities? We fully expect those answers will be complimentary and will not supersede. In conclusion, there are a wide variety of tools, both already available and in the proposed stage, that hold a promise for better management of our land resources and better control over growth. We have to be careful, however, in this effort that local governments decisionmaking need not be pushed aside, and that our authority to determine what our community looks like isn't relegated to merely advisory status. We look forward to working with this committee, the Federal Government, our State legislators, our city and town partners to achieve what we believe our citizens want--smart growth for the community. Senator Chafee. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Kauffman. Senator Baucus, do you have a statement or anything you'd like at this time? Senator Baucus. I do, Mr. Chairman. And first I thank you for holding this hearing. It is a new, developing area which I'm glad that you are paying very close attention to, and I thank our witnesses for taking the time and effort to come here. I can speak with some personal experience to the problems that you're facing, Mr. Kauffman. I have relative in your county who I go visit, and I've seen how much Lancaster County is changing, and I appreciate the problems that you have. I'd also like to say that--and somewhat similar to the problems facing Lancaster County--that this is not just a big- city issue. We're not talking just about urban sprawl. I'm sure that's a lot of the problem that you're facing, Mayor, but it is not just urban sprawl. It's not just a big-city issue or an East Coast issue or a California issue; it is an American issue. I might say that in some part I say that because the State I represent, Montana, has the motto of, ``The Big Sky State.'' We pride ourselves in our open space. We're the least metropolitan State, with only three cities, I might say, Mr. Chairman, that have a population of 50,000 people or more. We just don't have a lot of people. Open space is a very big issue in the rural west for two reasons. First of all, open space defines us. It is why we call our State, ``The Last Best Place,'' the State of Montana. And you'll be interested in this, Mr. Chairman. We, I think, are the last State to successfully write a constitution. I think it was 20 years ago. And let me just read you part of the preamble. It begins by first thanking God for the quiet beauty of our State, the grandeur of our mountains, and the vastness of our rolling plains, thanking God for the quiet beauty of our State, the grandeur of our mountains, and the vastness of our rolling plains. Unfortunately, though, our State is changing. It is growing. It has been discovered. Montana was discovered about 10 years ago, people moving in to Montana to escape--to escape what they regard as congestion or poverty or long commutes or crime, to a much better quality of life. As a consequence, we're growing very quickly. Our population has grown by more than 10 percent, and in Flathead County, which is in the northwestern part of the State, and in Gallatin County, which is the southwestern part of the State, our population in the last decade has grown 20 percent because of people moving into the State. This has its benefits, this growth, but it also has its costs. We now face some forms of sprawl, and we have congestion, pollution, increased demand for services. Let me read you an editorial by the Billings ``Gazette'' just last Sunday. ``Something must be done, or in time we will not have to lock the gates because the best parts of Montana will be ruined, and then no one will want to come here, let alone live here.'' That said, preserving open space raises very difficult issues. For one thing, we in the west love, as much as anything, and including open space, our independence. We don't like to be told what to do. And we don't trust big government. It runs in conflict with attempts to resolve the issues that we're facing here. We want to try to find a balance in Montana. We want to preserve open space, but we also want to preserve environmental quality, but we want to avoid red tape. This requires a lot of creativity. For example, the Montana Land Reliance has been a real leader in using conservation easements to preserve farmland. In the past 20 years, Montanans have required conservation easements of over 500,000 acres. Boseman and Gallatin County are trying their own different approaches, and the State is also doing a very good job in bringing leaders together Statewide. That helps all this. So I hope, Mr. Chairman, these hearings--and I know they will--will help us find that right balance. Two approaches I think are particularly constructive. First is, ``Let's make the Federal Government a better neighbor.'' Right now, many agencies often work against the interests of local communities. For instance, they often abandon downtown areas that the community is trying to redevelop. I've seen this in many communities in my State. And we should reexamine Federal policies that contribute to sprawl. We've made some progress. For example, as you well know, Mr. Chairman, we tied highway construction more closely to environmental protection. In addition, I've joined in asking the GAO to look at the effects of other Federal programs on sprawl, a report which should be done by mid-April, and that should help us even further. Second, let's help local communities get more control over their own destinies. For example, the Administration has proposed Better America Bonds and land's legacy initiative. Senator Lautenberg on this committee has proposed legislation to help redevelop brownfields in inner city areas. And Senator Boxer and others have introduced bills to conserve opening statement and habitat and protect farmland. These are reasonable ideas and deserve careful consideration. As I told EPA Administrator Browner a few weeks ago, I am particularly interested in the Administration's bond proposal. It would provide financial incentives for communities to preserve open space, reduce water pollution, and protect the environment in the ways that make most sense locally. But I also have questions. I want to make sure that the proposal is workable. I want to make sure that it supplements local control rather than displacing it. And I want to make sure that the initiatives are suited to the needs of various problems in various parts of the country, not just urban, not just eastern and western, and not just rural, but so it is tailored to suit specific local needs in specific parts of our country. I look forward, Mr. Chairman, to exploring these issues and others and hearing from our witnesses. And I apologize for taking the time here to---- Senator Chafee. No, that's very interesting, Senator. Thank you for your remarks. Senator Baucus. Thank you. Senator Chafee. This is a very difficult field. For example, I think it was--was it you, Mr. Kauffman, that mentioned about Virginia, which, as I understand it, if a local community in Virginia--let's take McLean--wishes to impose a transfer tax of, let's say, 2 percent on real estate transfers to go into a fund for open space purchases, that's prohibited. You have to get the permission of the State of Virginia. And, you know, that's a Virginia problem. I presume that--and the arguments always are, ``This is elitist. You're going to keep out--you're forcing up the cost of real estate.'' In our State we've tried several different--trying to do this on the city level I think is difficult because I don't think you have much open space left except for your brownfields, probably. In our State, we're doing it on a State basis in our State, and, for instance, one of the things that has proven quite popular as far as the purchase of farmland is not to buy the farmland but to buy what we call the ``development rights,'' not an easement. It's similar to an easement, to a degree, but let's say the land is worth $10,000 an acre as development and $2,000 an acre as farmland, we would say to the owner of the land, ``We'll pay you $8,000 an acre. You will continue to own your farm and you will receive this $8,000 an acre, but it ever hereafter can only be used as farmland. You lose the development rights.'' That is expensive, but it keeps what few dairy farms we have going, and it is a good program. Mayor, what I'd like to ask you is what would you do if you got--you know, there are a whole variety of bills that Senator Baucus mentioned, and others, but primarily it is the Land and Water Conservation Fund that people are looking to. Suppose you got some money with no strings attached but you've got to use it for the general theme we're on here, you can't use it to help your schools. What would you do with it? Mayor Helmke. In the city of Fort Wayne we'd probably use it first for brownfields redevelopment. We've identified a number of sites. They are in areas that are close to where people live, close to where some schools are, but they have, in effect, become dead zones. And we have already put together some coalitions with bankers, with not-for-profits, with developers to do something with these sites and try to get the assessments and make sure that the pollution is taken care of, but to start building housing on these sites and then do these things. So if we got flexible funds, I think we'd use them first to acquire this land, make sure that the land is properly assessed and cleaned up, and then start getting some productive uses out of it. What we have found in our city and in cities around the country is that there are so many tax dollars lost, so many jobs lost by the fact that we can't redevelop these brownfield sites. What I think is exciting about the bond program that was discussed is that, as I understand at least the initial drafts of this program is that it does give communities a lot of flexibility, which is the important thing. What's going to work in Fort Wayne might be different than what's needed in Providence, what's needed in other communities. And giving local communities the flexibility to design the program to their existing needs I think is the crucial one. But if we can take care of brownfields, we can get more investment, we can get more jobs, we can get more tax revenue, and, most important, we can have stronger neighborhoods and that's going to make a stronger city. Senator Chafee. But why would what you've described in any way fit under the rubric of preventing urban sprawl or preserving open spaces? Is your theory that if something went there it wouldn't go out in some lovely cornfield outside of-- -- Mayor Helmke. My theory is that if we find ways to help encourage investment in our cities, then they are less likely to automatically run to the cornfield or the soybean field. What happens in my community--and we've got rich farmland around us--is that it is just cheaper and easier and quicker to buy that cornfield, buy that soybean field, and put the new development, whether it's commercial, industrial, or residential, in the cornfield. And we---- Senator Chafee. Then you've got all the expenses of the infrastructure, the sewers, the---- Mayor Helmke. Right. And what ends up happening is that eventually someone has to extend the roads, someone has to extend the water, someone has to extend the sewer, and then someone has to figure out how to get the workers who don't live there to those jobs. That's why, if we can take away some of the barriers that are already there with the brownfield sites, we have the existing infrastructure. Water and sewer are there, roads are there. We've got other challenges--crime and perceptions of crime, racism in some areas. But if we can take away some of the barriers that, in effect, have been created by some Federal policies in the past, I think we can get the investment back in the city. That will help preserve the open spaces that are so important to all of us. Senator Chafee. Mr. Kauffman, what would you do if you got some money? You are a county official, right? Mr. Kauffman. We get blamed for that, Sir. I think we would take---- Senator Chafee. By the way, what does the county do? What is your jurisdiction? Do you run the schools? Mr. Kauffman. No. We do not have schools and we do not have law enforcement. Actually, our county is made up of 60 municipalities, one city of approximately 55,000. We have 16 boroughs, and the remaining are incorporated townships. Again, everyone has their own local zoning opportunities. We have comprehensive planning. But to the question, I think we would really use two processes. First of all, I support the investment in our urban center, because, just for the reasons the mayor has said, if we keep our urban centers healthy, then we will keep the pressure off sprawl or utilizing cornfields and agriculture. Senator Chafee. So that would mean what? Keep them healthy? How can you do it? Mr. Kauffman. We would to brownfields. I think, also, reinvesting in some efforts to reestablish businesses, to rehabilitate buildings, to do any of those things--parks in neighborhoods, quality of life issues. By the same token, we would also use dollars, I think, for the transfer development rights, as you outlined that your State is using. What we'd do with those moneys then would be to take those transfer of development rights or property rights, if you will, and transfer them from a rural township to a suburban township, where there is sewer and water and infrastructure, and then encourage higher densities in those areas where the infrastructure is. So the purchase of those development rights are then sold to a developer who then reuses those to get higher density. So ours would do, too. And our community is a bit different than some of my other colleagues in that we have a pretty large--we're kind of rural suburban. We have a population approaching half a million. But we also probably have the No. 1 agricultural non-aerated land. We currently, in our county, have over 30,000 permanently preserved agricultural lands. So we not only, I think, would attack what I perceive the issue that is there today that is the root, but also try to attack it from the other end, which is prevention. Mayor Helmke. I'd like to mention, Senator, if I might, one of the things I had mentioned in my text. We're getting ready to release a second survey from mayors across the country on brownfields. One of the things we found preliminarily is that 110 cities that responded estimate that they could absorb more than 3.5 million new residents into their cities if we could do something about redeveloping brownfield sites, taking down some of those other anti-urban barriers. That's equivalent to 1 year's growth in the Nation's population. Again, there are other barriers than just brownfields, but if we can find ways to use our existing city resources, our existing urban resources, to make that land attractive, those neighborhoods attractive, it can do a major thing in terms of preserving the open space that, again, our farm community and all of us want to see preserved. Mr. Kauffman. If I may also follow on, our city, which is about 50,000 people, is about---- Senator Chafee. Is that Lancaster? Mr. Kauffman. Lancaster. It is about 50,000 people. That's about the growth that we've had in our county in the 1990's. But that new 50,000 has taken 40 square miles rather than the seven square miles. So it's the way we've grown, the sprawl. And there's a clear, classic example of what sprawl has done. We've utilized six times the land than we would have in traditional patterns. Senator Chafee. I know your county a little bit. I'm an ancient buggy aficionado, so I come up to the Martin auctions, which I believe are in Intercourse, Pennsylvania. Mr. Kauffman. That's correct. Senator Chafee. And so I like your community very much. Senator Baucus? Senator Baucus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like your reaction, both of you, to the Better America Bonds proposal. Do you think that's a good idea? Or how might you tailor it or change it and so forth? As you know, the Administration is suggesting allocating-- basically it's an allocation. It would be an EPA allocation of tax credits, I guess, in the amount of the interest, and the credit would go to the purchaser of the bond, with the purpose of the bond I guess in various categories. Open space would be one. I've forgotten the others. As you know, this is different from, say, industrial development bonds, which, under current law, there's an allocation according to a State's population, and I guess the States, themselves, decide which projects make sense within the State. Your general thoughts on how Better America Bonds would help, the degree to which it would help address some of the problems that we're addressing here today? Mayor Helmke. We've talked about this at the U.S. Conference of Mayors, had a number of our mayors, both Republican and Democrat, look at the idea, and we seem to like the idea. It is something--again, we're still waiting for more details, but, in effect, we're getting a loan, that we're paying back in 15 years with no interest. The fact that it is tax credits means that it is less of a burden on the Federal Treasury. And these seem to be available for projects that will make a difference. I've talked to Carol Browner about the concept, and the thing that I find most exciting is that it preserves local flexibility. It doesn't tell us, ``Clean up this site,'' or, ``Use it for this specific purpose.'' It gives you the general rubric of what you need to deal with and then allows the local community to tailor those bonds to that community. That's what we need more of. I see it as sort of the equivalent of community development block grant dollars, where general purposes are outlined. It is made available directly to the local community, and the local community decides how best to use that to help the local community. Here we are paying them back, so it is different from CDBG, but it is something that I think could make a major difference in our community, and at this stage we support it, I support it. Senator Baucus. So you don't mind having EPA make the decision? Mayor Helmke. As long as it is a general rubric and it allows us to make the decision on how we are going to implement it. As I understand it from my conversations with Administrator Browner, they wouldn't be saying, ``Do this site. Don't do that site.'' They would say it's available for brownfields, they would say it's available for some urban park programs, they would say it is available for some open space type things. Those sort of criteria I think are important. As I understand it, we would be applying for these bonds and saying, ``Here's what we want to use it for,'' and they'd be either granting it or not granting it. But we'd be the one who is defining what we want to use it for. And if that part is not in there, then we are not as supportive, obviously. Senator Baucus. Commissioner? Mr. Kauffman. Well, Administrator Browner has also, as recently as a couple of weeks ago, addressed the National Association of Counties, and I would say there's certainly a fair amount of intrigue and interest in the program. I think our concerns are simply along what the mayor has said, as we believe it has to be workable with local governments and what our plans are. It has to supplement what we do. And it has to be suited to areas. It has to have flexibility to allow each community--just as you heard with us this morning, there is just a difference of opinion. The other thing I'd have to say is there is some fear. We're in part of a changing paradigm. We're talking about this partnership, and I think we really believe that, but, from local government's perspective, we're concerned when either the State or the Federal Government comes to us and says, ``Trust us, we're going to help you.'' And I would wager to guess our citizens probably say, as we as commissioners or mayors go to a citizens, ``Trust us,'' they have the same skepticism. However, we believe it is worth looking at. We think there's certainly merit to it, provided it supplements what is happening in local government and it really is a choice of local government to decide how to use it. What we've heard so far I think fits in the program of what the counties would look at. Again, flexibility and cooperation and complementing what we do are keys. Senator Baucus. I appreciate that. Mayor, would you support legislation removing State liability for perspective purchasers of contaminated brownfield sites? Mayor Helmke. Quite definitely. When I was president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, I made that my top priority item for the U.S. Conference of Mayors. That follows the tradition we've had with the Conference. Mayor Daley made it an issue. But it is one that I'm excited with the possibility that something is going to happen this session. We did quite a bit of work on the House side last year with Congressman Boehlert's bill that would have removed liability for prospective third party innocent purchasers. That, to me, is the crucial thing to change how brownfields are treated. Right now, it is almost impossible for us to get someone in there because of the fear factor. There might not even be any pollution on the site, but, just because they don't know, they don't want to touch it. And if we had that, I think we could do a lot. And I think it is exciting that, you know, it has been tied up with Superfund, I know, and that's an important issue, too, but if we can move the--if we can't get it all, let's move the brownfields reform through. I think that would make a big difference in Montana, it would make a big difference in Rhode Island, it would make a big difference in Indiana. Every community has these brownfield sites and needs some help. Senator Baucus. So that's one way we can help you---- Mayor Helmke. Definitely. Senator Baucus.--plan in your local areas? Mayor Helmke. Right. Senator Baucus. And I don't know what we're going to do in Superfund. You're right that it is a little problematic. But if we can't get it passed, I certainly hope that we can get something passed, and this would helpful. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Chafee. Senator Crapo? Senator Crapo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This question is for both gentlemen. I'm following up on the question asked by Senator Baucus with regard to local control and whether there is concern over having the EPA or any other Federal agency in effect determine how the funding can be used. And I appreciated your answers to Senator Baucus question. He echoed the very same introductory comments I did about how we in the west have concern about being told what to do and how to do it. The question I have is, I just want to get a little further into the issue of how such a bond proposal could be administered, because, even though there may not be a requirement that, say, the EPA in this case, tell exactly how the funding can be used, if the city or the county or the State or whatever government entity was requesting the bond or the grant knew that they would not be given the grant or receive the funding if they didn't fill in the boxes the right way and propose that they were going to use the funding the right way, don't you think that there still could be a very high risk that, just through the control of the purse strings, if the control was not very broadly used, that essentially we could get into a situation where the dollars were being designated by a Federal agency for the achievement of Federal purposes and that cities and counties were basically having to comply or not participate? Mayor Helmke. You make a very good point, Senator. This needs to be a true partnership, and Federal purposes, as long as they're general enough, I think can work within the local communities deciding how to implement those purposes. And this is where the devil is in the details. If there are so many strings on it, folks aren't going to apply for it because we're not going to want to jump through those hoops. We don't want to have to spend a lot of additional staff time filling out forms, filing out reports, meeting all those criteria, getting so many approvals that it doesn't make sense. The concept is a good one. How it works is going to be the crucial thing for us. And the major things would allow as much local flexibility as possible, make the application, approval, reporting process as simple as possible, and make sure that it doesn't really cause more problems than it attempts to solve when you set it up, or we won't take advantage of it. Senator Crapo. Mr. Kauffman? Mr. Kauffman. I would echo that. I think the concern we have is a partnership. And, again, this is sort of a new thing we're talking about that we trust each other. In our county, where we adopted urban growth boundaries without any implementing legislation, we basically sat down and discussed with each of our municipalities 23 boundaries and said, ``How is it? What is it?'' And I would tell you, each one of the 23 boundaries look a little different, financial resources look a little different. For some there were highway issues, for some there were park issues. And if that flexibility is not in this proposed bond program, I would see many county governments walking away from it, because there has to be that ultimate flexibility as long as we have as wide array as local government mixtures or there's just no value. Having a Federal program that tells us how to do that, that really doesn't get us where we need to go. Senator Crapo. Do both of you really think the cities or the counties would walk away from those dollars---- Mayor Helmke. Yes. Senator Crapo.[continuing] If they didn't have the ability to exactly determine how they are going to be used? Mayor Helmke. It depends how many strings are there. Again, general purposes, we can handle that. But being told how to do it--and, again, when I talked to Administrator Browner in January, she was saying part of this is to make it as flexible as possible for the cities or for local communities. Whether that's what ends up in the legislation, though, is the crucial thing. This gets back to my front door concept, you know. My citizens don't see differences between EPA, HUD, what this agency does. They see the overall picture, and we need to make sure it fits with that. Part of our concern is that we've had so many frustrations with EPA in the past. I raised the issue a few years ago. It's great to see EPA encouraging brownfields redevelopment, but I was concerned that if they made their clean air standards so stringent that I could never get anybody to go to the brownfields site, and all we were doing was encouraging somebody to go to Montana and take good, clean air away again, and we don't want that. I'm sure folks don't like to see that. Since then, we've been able to work with the EPA on some pilot programs where, in effect, credits are given if it is saving greenfield space by doing a brownfields redevelopment. I mean, there are ways to work it. But sometimes it's getting folks to realize that in the real world a lot of our citizens don't separate all these things into different jurisdictions, different agencies. Senator Crapo. I think it is very positive that we are all talking flexibility now, and what I wanted to do in these questions is flesh that out a little bit, because flexibility to one may not be flexibility to another. Could I get you both to agree or at least comment on whether you agree with the notion that really what we are talking about here is a revenue-sharing approach in which there doesn't need to be much directive, if any, from the Federal Government as to the specific use of the funds other than the categories of use that may be authorized, and that it should be a true block grant type approach, as much as is conceivably possible. Mayor Helmke. I think maybe it is a little closer to a community development block grant approach than the old revenue-sharing program, but, yes, outline a general purpose, and then allow the local community to find how best to reach that goal. Senator Crapo. Would you agree, Mr. Kauffman? Mr. Kauffman. I absolutely do. I want to reiterate I think most local governments would walk away if strings were attached, both some because they don't have the resources to comply initially to get the money, and second, the other side, those that have the resources are going to do it their way. So, again, I'd look at this as an incentive program that is being talked about of how we get everybody talking about the same issues. I think the block grant concept certainly has a lot more merit--again, though, I would say if the entitlement or block grant or what you have passes through to the local governments. The problem is, if we go through State legislatures, unless there is some guidance, it may not be directed to all communities with that flexibility. Mayor Helmke. Let me reiterate that. That's an important point, not only on this but on transportation funding and a lot of the other issues. We want the control to come back to the local level. That doesn't just mean the State House. We've got some great Governors. The former mayor of Boise is now there in Idaho, and Dirk Kempthorne does a great job. But it is--rather than having to lobby all of our Governors all the time, if we've got good intentions and good programs, let's get it back to the local level without creating another level of bureaucracy, oftentimes at the State House. Senator Crapo. Thank you. Senator Chafee. Senator Graham? Senator Graham. I hope it is not necessary for me to come to the defense of Governors. Mayor Helmke. No, it isn't. [Laughter.] OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BOB GRAHAM, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA Senator Graham. I feel there are a couple of characteristics that a proposal for Federal involvement in an area that previously has been a State and local responsibility that have to be articulated. One is: what is the rationale for the Federal role in this area? Two, is the Federal role going to be of a sufficient scale that it can have a meaningful and positive impact on that rationale? So let me ask a question. Why do you think the Federal Government should become involved in land acquisition programs for the purpose of constraining urban sprawl and creating more urban open space? Mayor Helmke. I think it is appropriate for the Federal Government to get involved in the issue of preserving open spaces and the issue of sprawl for two main reasons. But if you go too far into land control and zoning control, you're going too far. But, in terms of the general issue, I think it is appropriate for two reasons. One is that Federal policies in the past have contributed to an anti-urban bias and have helped create the problem, whether it's the Superfund legislation that scared people away from brownfield sites or the transportation legislation that helped move people into the Naples/Fort Meyers area and then make that community burgeon in an area where a family used to have property. Federal policies have contributed to this. EPA policies, wastewater policies, stormwater policies, stormwater regulations now basically encouraged folks to put their development outside my city limits because the stormwater regulations don't yet apply outside city limits. There have been a lot of Federal policies that have an anti-urban bias, so I think it is appropriate for the Federal Government to try to correct some of the unintended consequences of some of that legislation. Second, these are issues that cut across city, county, State boundary lines in many areas, and we need more of a regional approach oftentimes in helping to address those issues. But, again, the devil is in the details. I don't want local planning authority, local zoning authority taken away from my community, and I'm sure other mayors and county officials agree. But to have a Federal partnership role, partnership position in helping with these issues, that's the way to go. Senator Graham. And what about the issue of is the scale of the Federal program sufficient in order to have an impact. And your rationale, at least on point one, was largely an almost remediation. The Federal Government screwed things up through past decisions, and now needs to play a role in trying to put them back together. How large is that Federal role going to have to be in order to have an effective remediation impact? Mayor Helmke. I think, just starting to play a role--again, as long as it is a partner role, as long as it is a role that allows flexibility--that sends the message to local communities and to others that there is a partner that wants to do something here. The numbers we're talking about, whether it is in the bond program or in some of these other ``livability'' programs are fairly small dollars, but I think they send the message, as long as they don't attach too many strings, that the Federal Government wants to be a partner in dealing with these issues. That, at least at this stage, is enough of a signal to me. It's not something where it needs major Federal dollars involved, but it needs to be a positive Federal partnership role, and I think it can make a major difference. Mr. Kauffman. Senator, if I may, I would like to piggyback on the issue of investment. I think clearly the Federal Government today spends a tremendous amount of money on remediation, whether it be brownfields, whether it is water quality issues, air quality, or stormwater issues, and I think the investment, if we don't start dealing with the root cause over here, I think will just cause the Federal Government and other entities to spend many, many more dollars to deal with environmental concerns for our grandchildren and great- grandchildren. So I think it is highly appropriate to invest today to deal with the problems, but also put a portion of the investment on the root cause so that it will be a window at the end of the day that we can see out of and we can see progress being made, and ultimately the investment of tax dollars, all of our tax dollars, gets reduced. Senator Graham. My concern with the numbers associated with the proposals that are before us, I have a tendency to apply a 5 percent factor, because that happens to be the percentage that Florida is of the Nation's population, and I see a billion-dollar program, which would be $50 million in my State. Last year, our State probably spent $300 or $400 million of its own money on these open space programs. So with that scale it is hard to see that it is going to have the kind of impact against the problem that you described as the rationale. Mayor Helmke. I see it, though, as pilot programs, and it does help get the attention of mayors and local officials. A similar thing with the HUD budget last year, where for the first time I think they just had $50 million in terms of brownfields--first time it had shown up in the HUD budget. It had always just been in the EPA budget. That's hardly enough to clean up a decent-sized city of the brownfield sites in any of our cities around the country, but it started to say, ``This agency is going to play a partnership role, and hopefully get the attention in terms of changing regulations, bringing down barriers, working to do things.'' I think there is importance and there's value in pilot programs that send that message. Oftentimes, that's what's needed to get State legislatures to move along, to get some of the local committees to realize, ``Look, we can do this. Maybe it's not going to solve everything, but we've got a start here.'' Mr. Kauffman. Also, on that, we've done some programs within our county, both on open space preservation, farmland preservation, and transportation funds to local municipalities. I look at this as a leverage tool that the Federal Government uses to bring partners together. In our transportation grants, we generally leverage both public and private dollars on top of the county investment about 4.5 times the investment. I also look, generally, in public parks it is 2 to 1 leverage, that for every $1 we get $2 back. So I see this as a wonderful tool, and I don't think we should look to the Federal Government only to do this. I see this as--and hearing Administrator Browning, it's one of the things that I think she would like to see as a leverage. This is how you would apply for grants. How much money you brought to the table would certainly, if you will, give you points in the application process. It makes us work harder. That's truly how partnerships are formed and truly how we invest all our taxpayers dollars most wisely. Mayor Helmke. We've had some brownfield grants--again, not very large dollars, but we've gotten the faith community involved, not-for-profit sector involved, private sector involved in helping to renew, rehabilitate some brownfield sites. Again, it is a small piece of the pie, but it encourages others to get involved with it. Senator Chafee. OK, gentlemen. Thank you both very much. Before you leave, just one quick question. Do you, in your city or in your county, now go out and buy open space? I suppose--my son is the mayor of a city of about 80,000, second- largest city in our State. Oddly enough, we have some open spaces left there, obviously not in the hundreds of acres, but in the 60-acres or so, so he has put forth bond issues, which the people have approved, to go out and buy these places to preserve them for open space. Do you do similar things yourself? Mayor Helmke. We do two things. One is, inside the city we'll pick up some areas where it has been dilapidated housing, clear them, and create some open space inside the city in some situations, oftentimes in connection with trying to put a new project in there. With our parks program, we've acquired property outside the city limits for open space in areas where we see growth coming from the city, so we've put investment both in sort of residential lots that have deteriorated as well as open space outside. Mr. Kauffman. We do. We invest several million dollars a year for purchase of development rights or outright agricultural preservation easements on agricultural land. Then we invest slightly over a million dollars a year on park land acquisition. Senator Chafee. Boy, that's pretty good. Mr. Kauffman. Pretty much partnershipping with municipalities. Again, we have increased our agriculturally preserved land in the last 8 years from 10,000 acres to 30,000, our park land has increased from about 800 acres to slightly over 2,000 acres in the last 8 years. And every referenda question--and I think that's important--that has been in our community, which is perceived, I think, as being pretty conservative, has had 75 to 78 percent approval rating. Senator Chafee. Can't beat that. Mayor Helmke. I'd like to mention real quick---- Senator Chafee. That's the kind of figures that Senator Graham gets when he's running for reelection. Mayor Helmke. One of the exciting things here on this issue is that cities and counties are working together on this issue. On a lot of issues in the past, we didn't talk together. We've worked together on the Joint Center for Sustainable Communities that was set up a few years ago, both National Association of Counties, U.S. Conference of Mayors. We realize this is an issue where we have to be working together, not at odds with each other. I think, with that sort of partnership at the local level and a partnership at the Federal level, we can make a real difference. Senator Chafee. I think the point you've made here, that there has to be an effort on your part, too, I think in any of these proposals we've got it's not just 100 percent funds coming in your direction. I think there has to be---- Mayor Helmke. Definitely. Senator Chafee. [continuing] Some contribution; otherwise, it makes life too easy. Mayor Helmke. Generally, the larger share is really going to come at the local level, but I think a Federal role can help encourage a lot of that happening. Senator Chafee. OK. Thank you all. Senator Baucus. Mr. Chairman, I just want to say this last point about the leverage I think is a very good one. I don't think it is very well recognized, and I appreciate it. Mr. Chairman, I think it has been a great panel, very helpful. And I would like, Mr. Chairman, if they could both think about the Better America Bonds proposal and give us your thoughts as to what would help make it work and, along with that, some of the points that you think we should try to avoid with it, because we need your direct experience. I mean, you're there on the front lines. You know what works and doesn't work, so if you could tell us how you'd like to see it put together, what some of the packages, guidelines, and provisions would be, that would be very helpful. Mayor Helmke. We'd be happy to do that. Senator Baucus. Thank you, sir. Senator Chafee. Thank you very much. Mayor Helmke. I'd like to say, Senator Chafee, too, we just want to thank you for your service, and we're sorry to see you retire. Senator Chafee. Aren't you nice. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Mr. Moe, president of National Trust for Historic Preservation; Kathryn Hohmann, director, Sierra Club; Mr. Steve Hayward, senior fellow, Pacific Research Institute; Mr. Gary Garczynski, National Association of Homebuilders; and Mr. Nelson Rising, National Realty Committee--if you each would take your seat, and each will have 5 minutes. Mr. Moe, why don't you go to it. We want to welcome you here. Senator Baucus. Mr. Chairman? Senator Chafee. Yes? Senator Baucus. If I might just say something about Mr. Moe, I've known Dick Moe for many years. He's a very close personal friend, totally dedicated to service. He's served the Senate, he's served the Administration. He's now president of the National Historic Trust. I might add he's an historian of note. He's written a couple of history books. I read your statement, Dick, and I was very much struck by your Churchill quote, but not surprised that you would come up with something like that. Anyway, Mr. Chairman, we're very honored and we're lucky to have someone of his stature. Senator Chafee. Well, I echo that, Senator Baucus. Mr. Moe has been a very active and efficient head of the National Trust. If you look at some of the--it is just a wonderful organization. I always think back that one of the great crimes of this century, I think, was maybe what stirred the formation of your organization, when Penn Station was torn down in New York City. As a child I can--well, not such a child. I believe---- Senator Baucus. I remember Penn Station. Senator Chafee. [continuing] It was designed after the baths of Caracole, I believe, so they used to tell us. Is that true? Mr. Moe. I believe it was. Senator Chafee. And to have that torn down was one of the great architectural crimes of this century. Because of what Dick Moe is doing and his organization, hopefully things like that won't occur again. Go to it, Mr. Moe. STATEMENT OF RICHARD MOE, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL TRUST FOR HISTORIC PRESERVATION Mr. Moe. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Baucus, Senator Graham. I appreciate those kind remarks. I only regret that I now have to live up to them. I really appreciate your convening this hearing today, because this is an enormously important set of issues that you are addressing, and we really applaud your leadership in this area. Sprawl is a major concern for the National Trust because preservation these days is in the business of trying to save special places and the quality of life that they support, and sprawl destroys both. Sprawl really has become a very important preservation issue because it tends to suck the economic and social life out of existing communities where most of our historic resources exist. Now, there are, obviously, other factors--crime, bad schools, poor public services--that push people out of cities and contribute to sprawl, and those are the push factors. But sprawl, itself, becomes a pull factor, because once more and more economic activities leave the city, they pull even more behind them. Our goal is to revitalize existing communities to reduce the demand for sprawl. Sprawl is clearly a national problem and it needs a national debate, which you are helping to give it today, but the debate should not, in my judgment, focus on finding a national solution, because there isn't one. There are two essential elements in any effective program to combat sprawl: the sensible use of land and the revitalization of existing communities. These are issues traditionally and I think best handled at the State and local levels. In the end, that's where the fight against sprawl will be won or lost. But the Federal Government also has a very important role to play in the process, because the decline of our cities and the rampant development of our countryside have both been facilitated by Federal policies. Because the Federal Government has contributed so heavily to the problem, we believe it has the duty to help find solutions. Regrettably, there has been very little systematic review of how Federal policies have encouraged or perhaps even subsidized sprawl. Even though there is a GAO study expected, as Senator Baucus mentioned--and we have hopes for that--if it is not as comprehensive and as thorough as we hope it will be, I hope this committee will continue its efforts to try to really determine the effects of Federal policies on sprawl. I think it is the single most important thing that can be done. In summary--and I spell these out in greater detail in my submitted testimony--there are four ways that the Federal Government can help. First, it should correct Federal policies that encourage or reward sprawl. Tax and transportation policies have historically played the largest roles in this arena, but other policies, particularly the siting of Federal facilities and the availability of Federal funds for rehab versus new construction, are important; also, the ready availability of things such as water and sewer grants. Second, the Federal Government should reward States and communities that promote smart growth and help to revitalize existing communities, perhaps by designing a Federal smart growth score card that evaluates the effectiveness of States and communities in creating systems that favor sensible and sustainable growth and giving those entities an edge in the competition for Federal funds. Third, the Federal Government should promote regional cooperation as a key to effective control of sprawl. When it comes to sprawl, city limits and county lines are often meaningless marks on a map. Efforts to control sprawl in a limited area often just shift the problem from one community to another. Fourth, the Federal Government should provide incentives for reinvestment in existing communities and promote moderate- and middle-income home ownership in cities and older suburbs. We and a number of partners, some of whom you will hear from tomorrow, representing a range of interests, are now coming together to form a coalition that will advocate for Federal policies and promote smart growth. We've identified a few issues, and I would just like to summarize them briefly. First, the sound implementation of TEA-21 by the Federal and State departments of transportation, which, thanks to the leadership of you Senators and this committee, builds on the vision of ISTEA. The passage of the historic homeowner tax credit, which you, Mr. Chairman, and Senator Graham are championing here in the Senate, and which I believe can do more to revitalize cities such as Providence, Helena, Miami, and many others, than any other thing I can think of. The comprehensive implementation of the Presidential executive orders dealing with the citing of Federal facilities, which directs that Federal facilities should go into downtown areas, and, where possible, historic districts. Passage of the Post Office Community Partnership Act, which Senator Baucus and Senator Jeffords have led the way on here in the Senate--a very important piece. And several more, including the broadening and enactment of the Clinton Administration's proposed ``Livability agenda.'' Specifically, we would urge the Congress to expand the eligible activities for the proposed Better America Bonds to include infill development on brownfields and historic preservation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Chafee. Thank you, Mr. Moe. Ms. Hohmann? STATEMENT OF KATHRYN HOHMANN, DIRECTOR, ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY PROGRAM, SIERRA CLUB Ms. Hohmann. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I'm proud to be here representing the Sierra Club. My name is Kathryn Hohmann, and I'm the director of the Sierra Club's environmental quality program. I'm gratified to be here, but disappointed to hear of your impending retirement. There is not an environmental statute out there that doesn't have your fingerprints on it. You've been an inspiration to us all. Senator Chafee. Thank you very much. That's generous of you. Ms. Hohmann. I would like to start by saying that our board of directors every 2 years goes through a process where we poll our grassroots activists to find out what is of concern to them. As we did this polling process from California to Rhode Island, from Washington to Florida, we found out that sprawl was there on all of their concern lists. Even though we went from community to community and found out that each place was unique, in each place sprawl was ubiquitous. So the Sierra Club has begun and we've kicked off a national top-level priority campaign that is called, ``Challenge to Sprawl.'' I'd like to talk for a few moments about what that campaign is really going to consist of. This work is not new. Our activists have been fighting the effects of sprawl for many years. From Connecticut's trap rock ridges and California's San Mateo Creek to Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay, folks have been challenging sprawl. We are proud to say that we've had some real successes. For instance, in Utah our activists have been battling the Legacy Highway, a 1950's-style thoroughfare that would cut through the heart of the Great Salt Lake wetlands. We're happy to say that we've just had an interim success when the EPA came out in opposition to that highway, the Legacy Highway. But our efforts expand from there. In Georgia we are working for more transportation choices in a city where people put on the most vehicle miles and a city that has lost its Federal share for highway dollars because of its air pollution. Our efforts don't stop there. In our very own back yard here in the District of Columbia we have a program called, ``Restore the Core,'' which hopes to funnel more resources into the urban areas so that we don't fuel sprawl. It's what Mr. Moe described as one of the pushes. If we don't bring infrastructure dollars to our city centers, we can expect more sprawl. Again, this program is nationwide. We have some efforts-- even though we are trying to focus on a local level, we have some efforts that are national. We put out a report called, ``The Dark Side of the American Dream,'' which listed the top sprawl-threatened cities across America. That garnered lots of media attention because people care so much about this issue. They see it affects their very lifestyle. They see themselves caught in traffic. They know that, for example, in Washington, DC, the time commuters spend stuck in traffic climbed 69 percent between 1982 and 1994. And you can bet they didn't make up for those hours by trimming back on their work days. No, they trimmed back on the amount of time they spent with their families. The effects of sprawl go beyond this, though. We're talking about air pollution and water pollution, city streets running off poisoned runoff into our water systems. Urban areas and our city centers are also threatened. But there is good news, as well. There is bipartisan support behind this issue. There is a mandate coming from the public to work on sprawl. From coast to coast in this last election there were 150 ballot measures, as the chairman mentioned, about growth management, open space, and those sorts of measures. In New Jersey, voters, even in the State's famously tax- averse republican counties, asked overwhelmingly to approve the use of $1 billion in tax revenue to conserve open space and farmland. How can we solve this problem? Will there be a Federal role? Well, the Sierra Club believes that there will be, but sometimes what is needed is not more government but more government leadership. Sometimes the Federal Government just needs to get out of the way or reform policies that create perverse incentives that fuel sprawl--policies like the ones that our colleagues mentioned about stormwater, which pushes-- again, one of the push factors--pushes development out of our city centers and creates more third-, fourth-, and fifth-ring suburbs. There are some positive things that the Federal Government can do, as well. The Sierra Club is especially inspired by the Better America Bonds program, the idea that is being floated by the White House. We think that this program will get us off the ground forging partnerships with communities. We ask why, in a country that has for many years used bonds to create roads and bridges, why we can't use bonds to create open spaces, greenways? We think that this program is a great first step. It will provide $700 million in new tax credits. But that money would really be bigger, would expand as we go. There's a magnifying force here that would, over 5 years, leverage nearly $10 billion in bonding authority for communities to shape their futures in ways that are healthier, greener, more stable. We are looking forward to working with this committee as you grapple with this important issue of sprawl and thank you again for asking us to testify. Senator Chafee. Well, thank you very much, Ms. Hohmann. Mr. Hayward, Senior Fellow, Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy? STATEMENT OF STEVE HAYWARD, SENIOR FELLOW, PACIFIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE Mr. Hayward. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think maybe the best way to begin putting the current debate on sprawl into some context is to make recourse to that proverbial barometer of the American soul, the taxi driver. Not long ago I was in a taxi on my way from Lindbergh Field in St. Louis out to St. Charles County, which is where the growth is taking place in the St. Louis region. Trying to get some local insight, I asked him what he thought was going on, what he thought about what was going on. And he said, as so many people say, ``Man, they're building so fast out here that if they keep building like this there won't be any land left.'' So I asked him where he lived, and he said, ``Well, I live down in the city of St. Louis,'' but he added, without any prompting from me, ``I'm going to move out here. The quality of life is so much better. You get so much more value for your housing dollar out here.'' And that, I suggest, is what social psychologists have longed called ``cognitive dissonance''--the ability to keep two contradictory ideas in your mind at the same time and be untroubled by it. Jim Johnson, who just retired as the chairman of Fannie Mae likes to say, more elegantly, I think, ``The American people are against two things. They're against sprawl, and they're against density.'' So now we go and try to sort that problem out. What I want to suggest is that there's a lot of cognitive dissonance at work on this issue, quite a bit of misperception, and a lack of proportion about our current discourse about this. I'd like to start this way, in what I'll describe in a minute as an irrelevant fashion, by making reference to aggregate land use statistics. We hear a lot about, you know, million acres here, 10 million acres here. The total amount of urbanized land in the continental U.S. is less than 5 percent of the total area. And, based on some figures that are now a little outdated--and we'll have some better ones in about 2 months from the U.S. Geological Survey--we develop every year about .07 of 1 percent of the land area of the continental U.S. There's even some evidence that the rate of sprawl may be slightly lower than it was in the 1960's and 1970's. There is a sprawl index that is used a lot in these discussions that is sort of a rough comparison between rates of population growth and the rates of urbanization, and it is a fairly crude and not very good measure, in some ways, but the point is that that measure has been declining since 1980. One last fact. In 1969, there were about 2.6 acres of land specifically designated for parks and wildlife and wilderness conservation for every acre of urbanized land in the country. Today there's about four acres of land designated for parks, wilderness, and wildlife for every acre of urbanized land, and those figures don't include our national parks, by the way. Now, these are the kind of aggregate figures that I say are irrelevant to the politics of the issue, because the acres dwarf the human scale. I'm reminded of President Roosevelt's famous quip about critics of the long-run effects of the New Deal. He used to say, as you might remember, ``People don't eat in the long run, they eat every day.'' Similarly, every piece of open space that yields to the bulldozer in this country is in the line of site of a populated area where people live, and the change and disruption it brings trumps the fact that the land area may be statistically very small. I think it is the aversion to rapid change that's the dominant social fact behind the controversy over sprawl, and it is enhanced and magnified by a second social fact of modern life today, and that is that in all other areas of life we have increasing latitude for choice and control over our lives. Thirty years ago we didn't own our own phones. They were the property of the phone company. Today we choose our own long distance service. And next year we may choose our own electric power generator. Right? And so what we're seeing in city life, it seems to me, is that people feel that their range of choice and control is diminishing. Most acutely, we aren't able to choose where and when we are able to drive in the same way we used to because of traffic congestion. And people have a sense of what they can't control events, themselves, they wish someone else would do it, typically the government. Now, my opinion is that most of the ideas that make up the conventional wisdom at the moment, such as urban growth boundaries and, to a lesser extent, the bundled ideas that go forward under the banner of smart growth, are misguided because I think they misperceive a lot of what is going on, especially the major traffic congestion. But also I think as remedies they would not be that effective in solving the main problems associated with growth. Why this is so takes a long time to go through, so let me just mention what I think is the single most important reason for being cautious about embracing ambitious land use schemes or other measures that might distort our land market. It seems to me that a century of regulation has taught us that regulation typically favors the affluent and organized over the less-affluent and less-organized, and there are few groups less-organized and represented than the people who would benefit from new houses and new jobs. Now, most smart growth advocates will tell you that this is not a debate about growth, per se, but it is a debate about the form growth should take. And, while I take them at their word at this and believe they are quite sincere about it and right in many aspects of their critique, I think we are naive if we fail to recognize that growth management schemes often become the machinery of negation for existing residents. To pick a local example, the angry voters attending Fairfax County Commission hearings out in the suburbs here are not angry because of the form of development. What a lot of them told the ``Washington Post'' a few months ago is, ``Our housing values are stagnant because the county is allowing too many houses to be built, and we'd like to see fewer of them built.'' Everyone's favorite model right now of enlightened growth management is Portland, Oregon. It strikes me that it is starting to show some of the same kind of exclusionary effects you've seen in some boutique regions like Boulder, Colorado, Santa Barbara, Marin County, and so forth. In my testimony I've attached a little table that shows comparisons of housing prices between Portland and other sprawling cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas. Since the red light is on, I'll stop right now. Senator Chafee. Thank you very much. Mr. Garczynski on behalf of the Homebuilders? STATEMENT OF GARY GARCZYNSKI, VICE PRESIDENT AND TREASURER, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HOMEBUILDERS Mr. Garczynski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Gary Garczynski, and I am currently the vice president and secretary of the National Association of Homebuilders. I am a builder and land developer in Northern Virginia and have worked in this industry for nearly 30 years. I am currently developing some infill projects in Alexandria and Fairfax County, and have served as the president of the Northern Virginia Transportation Alliance and serve at the pleasure of Governor Gilmore and Virginia's Housing Study Commission. If I could take 1 second, though, on behalf of the 197,000 firms and its members across the country, we would be remiss if we did not acknowledge your contributions, Senator, over many years of service. We haven't always been on the same side of issues, but you've always conducted yourself as a gentleman and a dedicated and committed public servant and our hat is off to you. Senator Chafe"
