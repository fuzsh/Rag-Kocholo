        "text": "All online obituaries can be found on our Facebook page.\n\nEdward A. Grooms\n\nEdward A. Grooms, age 78, of Carmichaels, died August 13, 2024, of a heart attack in his family’s home.\n\nEd was born June 20, 1947, in his family’s home, the son of the late Raymond (Ray) and Helen Haky Grooms.\n\nHe was a graduate of Carmichaels Area High School and worked for decades with his late dad at Grooms Hilltop Service, on Rt 88, as an alignment specialist and mechanic.\n\nBack in the day, alignments were all hand measured and adjusted. Along with his late wife, he later worked as a guard with U.S. Security.\n\nEd married Brenda Nicholson Grooms on November 12, 1988. She passed away on May 2, 2024. They were both members of the Carmichaels Methodist Church.\n\nHe enjoyed reading, watching “old Star Trek and Mash” TV shows, the History Channel, and Pirates Baseball, although they are once again “in the cellar”, as he commented shortly before he passed.\n\nHe and Brenda always put in a huge garden behind the house, and I can remember morning glories or sweet peas hanging from their front porch.\n\nHe will be remembered by his many in-laws, nieces, nephews, and great nieces and nephews.\n\nHe could be gruff at times, but he was always a good man.\n\nServices are private and entrusted to the Paul M. Lesako Funeral Home In., 204 Dowlin Avenue, Carmichaels, PA 15320. 724-966-5100.\n\nBlaine Allen Casseday\n\nBlaine Allen Casseday, 81, of Greensboro, passed away August 15, 2024, at his home, where he wanted to be with his son by his side. He courageously battled lung cancer in 2020 and was able to live an independent life until the time of his passing from a brief illness.\n\nBlaine was born May 30, 1943, the son of the late Emma Juanita Shaffer and Harold Edward Casseday. He is preceded in death by his wife of over 43 years, Ruby Wise Casseday, and two brothers Clarence and Lawrence.\n\nHe is survived by an aunt and uncle, Dave and Norma Shaffer; a sister Norma Bateman and brothers Sonny Casseday and Edward Casseday, 3 children, Ray Casseday (Kathy), Hope Black (Scott), and Damon Casseday. In addition, Blaine was blessed with six grandchildren Shane, Nicole, Eric, David, Brittany, and Pap Pap's special young man Dustin Damon; 6 great grandchildren who affectionately called him pappy-great, as well as numerous nieces and nephews.\n\nThere is not enough room to share how special of a person Blaine truly was as it seemed he never met a stranger and acquired more friends through life than one could count. He was a graduate of Mapletown Jr-Sr High School and married his wife Ruby soon after graduating. After a brief stay in Alexandria, Virginia, Blaine returned his family to Greene County where he had a very successful carpentry business. There are too many locations to list where his fine workmanship can still be seen today. Many young men who worked for him later became their own successful business owners carrying with them the work ethic and education from Blaine's mentorship of high-quality workmanship.\n\nBlaine was an avid hunter, especially \"buck season\" and turkey hunting. He had such a love of conservation that for fifteen years he volunteered his time as a Deputy in the Pennsylvania Game Commission under Robert Shaffer. Even upon retirement, Blaine found a personal satisfaction of doing small construction jobs. He felt a sense of satisfaction in being able to interact with customers and enjoy the trade he loved.\n\nIf you knew Blaine, you understood what such a positive personality and jovial demeanor he had by making people smile and out of the blue cracking a joke that turned into hours of conversation and reflection. His legacy will be that he made an impact on many and their lives are better for knowing him. Only a few years old when he lost his mother, his childhood was very hard; however, he made sure that he gave his own children a remarkable childhood. He was a wonderful father and grandfather.\n\nFinally, the most important fact of all is that Blaine was saved through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. He fought the good fight, lived an honorable life, and now rests with our Lord.\n\nFamily and friends will be welcomed from 2-4 and 7-9pm, on Monday August 19, 2024, and from 10-11am, the time of service with Pastor French Jenkins performing the eulogy, on Tuesday August 20, 2024, in the Paul M Lesako Funeral Home Inc., 204 Dowlin Avenue, Carmichaels, PA 15320. 724-966-5100.
