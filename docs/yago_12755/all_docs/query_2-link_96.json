It’s been tough. It’s been a challenge.”\n\nBoth parents, Walker said, grew up with their own painful struggles and in a certain way have looked at the life they’ve attempted to provide for her and have wondered what on earth could possibly be wrong with your life?\n\nThe Commonwealth Club, a public forum group, hosted Walker at Berkeley Hillel -The Reutlinger Center on Monday night where she read from her autobiography and took questions about herself and the Third Wave Foundation, a philanthropic group she founded after graduating from Yale University, Cum Laude, in ’92 for women between the age of 15-30.\n\nWalker’s has been a contributing editor to Ms. magazine since 1989.\n\nHistorically her writing has engaged such topics as feminism, race, sexuality reproductive freedom and domestic violence and has been published in Essence, Mademoiselle, The New York Daily News, Harper's, Sassy, SPIN, The Black Scholar, and various women's and black studies anthologies including Listen Up (Seal) and Testimony (Beacon).\n\nConsidered as a signature voice for the young women's movement, and named in ’96 as one of the 50 Future Leaders of America by Time magazine, Walker’s most recent writing appears to be taking a step back and inside to explore the duality of her existence — and reveals the insecurity of an adolescent who spent many years of her life looking at two cultures from the outside and longing to be apart of either. In Shifting Self she writes about what’s not so apparent about the successful, intelligent and beautiful woman the world sees.\n\nYears before her parents were separated, Walker details the resentment she experienced from darker-skinned black girls, setting the groundwork for her own self-discovery.\n\n“It does not occur to me that I’m doing something against the other dark-skinned girls.... It does not occur to me that I am somehow betraying them,” Walker writes about herself and a sense of entitlement that not being perceived as being black gave her.\n\nShe also recalls the invisibility of not belonging and the confusion of living underneath the changing perception of others.\n\n“What I found in writing this book was that remembering was very painful. I found that in order for me to remember I had to let go... So it was through writing this book that I created a cohesive and surrogate Rebecca and that I was able to let go of experiences that have been so long etched onto my body,” Walker said of her book.\n\nWalker was born in 1969 in Jackson, Mississippi, to an interracial “movement” couple who married in defiance of Mississippi's anti-miscegenation laws — African-American novelist Alice Walker and white Jewish civil rights attorney Mel Leventhal.\n\n“Movement folk... In 1967, when my parents break all the rules and marry against laws that say they can't, they say that an individual should not be bound to the wishes of their family, race, state, or country. They say that love is the tie that binds.”\n\nBut she also recalls with the same clarity and honesty the pain of her parents break-up and somewhere in the middle she says she learned when to break those rules in order to find her place in the world.\n\nIn San Francisco her mother struggled to balance the demands of writing with the responsibilities of motherhood, and according to daughter Rebecca Walker it was at times they were so close it was difficult to discern the lines between mother and daughter and to know the limitations of being a child.\n\nIn New York, however, her father had remarried to a more traditional homemaker and this environment she says left her feeling stifled. Walker chronicles the ambivalent relationship she has with her father's new wife, a woman whom she describes as her “white, holier-than-thou, Jewish stepmother,” but in her more vulnerable moments also calls “Mom.”\n\nWalker describes the paradox of these two existences in passages of the book. “...It is too hard to be the translator between two worlds,\" she writes.\n\nIn addition Walker talks of difficult early years with her Jewish family, recalling a scene when her Jewish grandmother would occasionally “kvetches] about how ungrateful her daughters-in-law are and how tragic it is that she isn't ever going to have Jewish grandchildren because her sons married shiksas.\" And pages later revisits visiting her mother’s family in Atlanta and how that intimacy was tainted by discomfort.\n\nWalker writes, \"How do I reconcile my love for my uncles and cousins with the fact that I remind them of pain?\"\n\nIn a recent interview, Walker elaborated on that discomfort. “It was painful for my [black] uncles to notice white attributes and characteristics in me. I brought them all this joy, but at the other end were traits [in me] that they thought were dangerous and repulsive. [On the other hand], my blackness reminds my father of a time in his life that is different from the time he lives in now. It reminds him of how committed he was to civil rights and how adamant he was about that work before he became a corporate litigator. One of the profound facts of my body is that it becomes a location, a reminder, particularly for my father, of what he lost romantically and politically.\"\n\nThe Shifting Self is a story of change, of negotiating with social constructs and coming to the point where you’ve got the upperhand.\n\ncontact reporter:\n\ndevona@berkeleydailyplanet.net\n\nCold town, warm heart Park City hosts its biggest party ever\n\nPARK CITY, Utah — This town knows how to host a party.\n\nLong before the Olympics, this mountain ski village east of Salt Lake City was one of the few places in Utah with name recognition. Three ski resorts and the Sundance Film Festival bring thousands of visitors every winter and concertgoers and arts festival patrons in the summer.\n\nNow, for its biggest party ever, Park City has unleashed all its practiced hospitality. Area resorts are hosting snowboarding, slalom and moguls events, with ski jumping close by at Utah Olympic Park. The city’s Old Town is hosting the fun.\n\nPark City is hipper, richer, smaller and cooler than its valley neighbors. With the state’s smallest percentage of Mormon residents, the former mining town has never followed Salt Lake’s conservative lead.\n\nPark City boomed in the 19th century — with many more saloons and brothels than churches — after silver was discovered in the hills, but it was a ghost town by the 1950s. It was revived in the 1960s when the city’s biggest mining company realized snow could be more lucrative than silver and opened a resort.\n\nNow, it’s one of the nation’s swankiest winter destinations. Average house prices are twice those in the rest of the state, and it’s probably the only place in Utah where Gucci bags and men in full-length fur coats don’t merit a second look.\n\nDuring the Olympics, Park City is capitalizing on its history, with entertainment ranging from dancing cowgirls to Budweiser horses trotting along historic Main Street. Sponsors hand out goodies and drinkers occasionally sneak beer out onto the street — a sight unknown in Salt Lake.\n\nTight security is still evident; officers clad in yellow parkas roam everywhere.\n\nTammy Smith, a police dispatcher from California here to work for the games, was in town to enjoy a day off with several colleagues. She said Park City residents and city officials have been enthusiastic.\n\n“They’ve made law enforcement feel very welcome. The people here are very gracious,” she said. “Everybody comes up and thanks them for being here.”\n\nDespite the scope of this party, most residents seem to be taking it in stride. There are crowds, but no bigger than for any other festival here. Perhaps because of the cold or the economy, the place hasn’t been overrun with hordes of visitors.\n\nEven this bastion of wealth shows signs of penny-pinching. Shops selling expensive wares are relatively quiet. Inexpensive eateries are packed, while upscale restaurants whose meals normally cost upward of $50 are selling pizza and pasta on the street for $6.\n\n“People, when they find out it’s a set menu at a certain price, would rather buy from street vendors,” said Ryan Wells, a manager at the hip Chimayo restaurant on Main Street.\n\nA Wasatch Brew Pub booth on Main Street featured the model who graces the company’s ads for St. Provo Girl Pilsner. Ingrid Liepnicks signed posters showing her in a revealing beer-garden barmaid outfit and saying, “I may be from Provo, but I’m no saint.” It was a tongue-in-cheek reference to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, whose members are supposed to forswear alcohol.\n\nA line of men drinking beer stretched toward the door.\n\nThe busiest spot in town was the Roots shop, selling clothing made by the official outfitter of the U.S. Olympic team. There was a line out the door on Sunday.\n\nUp the street, Salt Lake City resident Mike Christy was trying to sell T-shirts reading “Polygamy is better than monotony.” He said his other T-shirt idea, five linked wedding rings with the slogan “Utah Polygamy Association: Proud supporter of the 2002 Olympic Winter Games” would have gotten him in trouble with games organizers.\n\n“I heard the state of Utah was going to be distancing itself from polygamy during the games,” Christy said. “I thought to myself, maybe someone less noble could get in on that and make a dime.”\n\nEnvisioning more for the Gill Tract for education and vegetation\n\nEditor:\n\nWest of the intersection of San Pablo and Marin avenues you can see a small grove of conifers, behind which lie several acres of cultivated land and a small cluster of buildings. This is the undeveloped remnant of the Gill Family Nursery, which once extended west to what is now I-80. The entire property was subsequently gifted to the University of California (the UC Gill Tract) for research and environmental studies.\n\nUC is now preparing to redevelop 26 acres of this land, primarily as a mixed use of campus housing, retail commercial, administrative offices, etc., ignoring the history of the area and the original intent of the gift.\n\nThe University is also overlooking the fact that 30 percent of the food grown in this country is produced in and nearby metropolitan areas. A nearby food source means reduced transportation costs and quite often fresher food. It makes sense to better understand and improve food production in the metropolitan area to assure that it is sustainable, and focuses on the optimal usage of the soil, water and energy resource.\n\nThe Gill Tract is ideally positioned for just such a research focus – open land, soil free from pesticides and a supportive community and nearby labor source. A university-community research garden would allow faculty researchers a nearby experimental area and an excellent extension educational opportunity.\n\nBut why limit the Gill Tract to experimental gardens. The now empty buildings could provide classroom space for workshops and demonstrations not only by university personnel, but also by local businesses and nonprofit groups, enabling them to exhibit, demonstrate and even sell products needed by the city farmer and gardener. This could include soil and garden mix suppliers, drip irrigation and other water conservation methods (low flush, low flow, etc), vendors of solar and photovoltaic equipment, beneficial insect suppliers (ladybird beetles, green lacewings, etc.) and least toxic pesticides and fertilizers to name a few. Rather than the usual commercial mall, the Gill Tract could become a one-stop ecological/educational mall where questions relating to gardening, food production, food storage and nutrition could be answered. The potential for benefiting the community and providing leadership for other metropolitan areas is exciting.\n\nThe area already has groups that provide gardening and other ecological information, but these remain scattered and often overlooked – city of Berkeley Ecology Center, Bio Integral Resource Center (least toxic pest controls), Tilden Regional Park and University of California Botanical Gardens (information and sources of native plants), California Native Plant Society, California Rare Fruit Growers Society, San Francisco League of Urban Gardeners, among others.\n\nIs the life we live in our metropolitan areas sustainable, or have we already passed that point? We all agree that a proper mix of clean food, water, air and energy is essential, but how do we arrive at the proper blend on a local and regional level? The Gill Tract offers the university and community an excellent chance to answer these questions.\n\nLloyd Andres\n\nBerkeley\n\nTuesday, Feb. 12\n\nWetland Restoration\n\n10 a.m. - 1 p.m.\n\nMartin Luther King,, Jr. Shoreline, Oakland\n\nRestoration activities include planting native and removing non-native plants, shoreline clean-ups, and water quality monitoring.

According to hospital officials, Morales was released on Sunday after some minor surgery.\n\nPolice said they are uncertain if the shooting was random or if the bullets were intended for Morales.\n\n“The case is under investigation, and right now we don’t know if Mr. Morales was the target,” Capt. Bobby Miller said adding that Morales’s was the only unit hit by gunfire.\n\nMiller said there were no witnesses to the shooting and currently there are no suspects.\n\nThis incident follows a recent rash of shootings in the city.\n\nOn Jan. 22, Rammar Johnson and Noel Turner, Jr. were found in a vehicle with multiple gunshot wounds to the head at 63rd and King streets. Both men later died.\n\nIn another incident, a man was wounded in the thigh during a domestic dispute on Jan. 28, and on Feb. 5, yet another man was wounded in the thigh by an acquaintance.\n\n“There is an increase in shootings from last year,” Miller said although he did not have last year’s figures immediately available. “We haven’t been able to distinguish a particular pattern or associate any of the other shootings. So far they appear to be independent of each other.”\n\nMiller said he was unaware if there has been a history of drug activity in the vicinity of Friday’s shooting. Councilmember Margaret Breland, who represents the neighborhood, did not return calls on Monday.\n\nMayor Shirley Dean said she was alarmed to hear about the Friday shooting.\n\n“I’ve heard it’s possible that some of the shootings are drug related,” she said. “If that’s the case then this is a real wake up call.”\n\nDean encouraged anyone who knows anything about the shooting to call the police. “The best way to fight this type of thing is with the help of the community,” she said.\n\nCity Manager Weldon Rucker, who was on the scene of the shooting as police investigated the Friday night incident, said the recent shootings are an indication that there needs to be some changes in the neighborhood.\n\n“In addition to police we also plan to have City Services take a look at some of the businesses and blighted properties in the area that might be contributing to the problem,” he said.\n\nRamsey stands for diversity and inclusion\n\nEditor:\n\nI would like to address points made by Paul Hogarth in his letter of 2/2/02. He implies that Charles Ramsey’s campaign is somehow tainted by the support of property owners whom he calls “crapacious and callous” these inappropriate comments send chills up the spine when one considers that Mr. Hogarth sits on a board which is supposed to make unbiased determinations on tenant-landlord disputes. He is a clearly and viscerally biased against property owners.\n\nMr. Hogarth tries hard to portray Charles Ramsey’s support as one dimensional (real estate interests); but the standing-room-only Ramsey campaign kick off event two weeks ago told a different tale. If you wanted true diversity in Berkeley that is where you found it: African-Americans, Latinos, labor union representatives, property owners, members of the Berkeley fire department and families lined up to take their assignments to walk precincts.\n\nIf Charles Ramsey is in the pocket of landlords and real estate interests as Mr. Hogarth would have you believe, how does he explain his endorsements by Maudelle Shirek and Barbara Lee, icons of progressive politics in Berkeley.\n\nMr. Hogarth states that if any East Bay resident cares about the “housing crisis” they should vote for Loni Hancock. If my memory serves me well, it was Ms. Hancock who opposed the building of the Foothill dorms on UC property – she even went as far as standing in front of the bulldozers to prevent construction.\n\nMr. Hogarth is not concerned about student housing, he merely wants more rent control. Here is the paradox: almost all of the rent control programs in the nation (including Berkeley’s started out as a response to inflation – not a housing crisis. That came later.\n\nUnfortunately, the more rent control a city has, the worse the housing crisis becomes, the more demand that rent control be expanded and enforced more severely (Mr. Hogarth’s and Loni Hancock’s true agenda).\n\nPlaying the rent control card shows how out of touch with the voters the Hancock campaign is by relying on juvenile demagogues such as Mr. Hogarth.\n\nMr. Charles Ramsey is a moderate with much more broad appeal in a district where Berkeley represents only one third of the electorate and where he has solid support not only from Mayor Shirley Dean, councilmembers Betty Olds and Maudelle Shirek, but from Berkeley police and firefighters as well.\n\nCharles Ramsey is ready to take the new 14th District into the 21st century by building bridges to the entire community, while Ms. Hancock wants to drag us back to the ‘60s with the politics of division.\n\nRobert Cabrera\n\npresident\n\nBerkeley Property Owners Association\n\nCounty suffers from child care cost, scarcity\n\nLicensed child care in Alameda County is both scarce and expensive, according to a report released last week by the California Child Care & Resource Referral Network, a statewide organization that conducts research on child care issues.\n\nAccording to the report, the third in a series of biannual statewide studies, the average cost of full-time care for an infant in the county is $9,501, or 19 percent of the median income. The figure rivals housing costs, falling just below the $11,050 fair market rent for a two-bedroom unit in Alameda County.\n\nThe study, based on 2000 figures, also found that child care is available for only 32 percent of the children in the county who may need it, a 7 percent increase since 1998.\n\nShelley Waters Boots, research director for the Referral Network, said the modest increase in child care availability, both in the county and statewide, is disappointing given the recent economic boom.\n\n“Our expectations were that, because of all the increasing demand, child care would grow to reach that demand,” she said. “But, even in the best of times, the market didn’t respond the way normal markets would respond.”\n\nWaters Boots said high rental costs, for commercial spaces and private homes that host child care, played a role in discouraging growth.\n\nJudy Kriege, resource referral counselor for Bananas, an Oakland-based group that helps parents in northern Alameda County find childcare, said low salaries also contributed to the problem.\n\n“Child care doesn’t pay well,” Kriege said, pointing to statistics from the Referral Network report which show that statewide the average salary for a pre-school teacher is $21,130 and the average salary for an assistant is $17,420. Entry-level public school teachers, by contrast, make an average of $25,433.\n\nDarlene Percoats, executive administrative director of the Child Educational Center, a child care center in Berkeley, said low salaries make it difficult to find qualified staff. But no matter what the pay scale, she said, it is simply difficult to find people with a passion for the work.\n\n“You can find a body,” Percoats said, “but quality people who are committed to what they’re doing is something else.”\n\nBeatriz Leyva-Cutler, director of the Bay Area Hispano Institute for Advancement, a 26 year-old child care agency in Berkeley, said it is particularly difficult to find qualified bilingual staff to serve the needs of her clientele.\n\nBut more than anything else Leyva-Cutler said she needs more funding, both to boost salaries and secure more space. “We’d like to serve more children,” she said, noting that she has 60 families on her waiting list, “but we don’t have the facilities.”\n\nThe city of Berkeley spends over $500,000 per year on child care services, and the state has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into early childhood development in California in recent years through Proposition 10, a 1998 voter-approved cigarette tax.\n\nAlameda County has received about $20 million per year. Over the course of 18 months in 2000-2001, through its Every Child Counts program, the county spent about $5 million on child care, including $4.1 million in stipends for child care workers who have spent at least nine months at a given center. Stipends range from $500 to $5,100, depending on a teacher’s education level.\n\nPercoats said the stipends have been helpful in retaining staff in the industry. But ultimately, with salaries still low, she said, it is commitment to children that keeps people in the job.\n\nToday in History\n\nToday is Tuesday, Feb. 12, the 43rd day of 2002. There are 322 days left in the year.\n\nToday’s Highlight in History:\n\nOn Feb. 12, 1809, Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, was born in present-day Larue County, Ky.\n\nOn this date:\n\nIn 1733, English colonists led by James Oglethorpe founded Savannah, Ga.\n\nIn 1870, women in the Utah Territory gained the right to vote.\n\nIn 1892, President Lincoln’s birthday was declared a national holiday.\n\nIn 1909, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was founded.\n\nIn 1915, the cornerstone for the Lincoln Memorial was laid in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 1924, George Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue” premiered in New York.\n\nIn 1940, the radio play “The Adventures of Superman” debuted on the Mutual network with Bud Collyer as the Man of Steel.\n\nIn 1942, painter Grant Wood, creator of “American Gothic,” died in Iowa City, Iowa, a day before his 51st birthday.\n\nIn 1973, the first release of American prisoners of war from the Vietnam conflict took place.\n\nIn 1999, the Senate voted to acquit President Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice.\n\nTen years ago: Democratic presidential candidate Bill Clinton released a letter he’d written as a student in 1969 in which he said he had decided to give up a draft deferment in order to “maintain my political viability.” President Bush formally announced his bid for re-election.\n\nFive years ago: The highest-ranking official to flee communist North Korea, Hwang Jang Yop, asked for political asylum at South Korea’s consulate in Beijing.

Painesville is about 30 miles east of Cleveland.\n\nOccupation: criminal\n\nYORK, Pa. — When court clerks asked York County Prison inmate Greg Gould Jr. to list his occupation for a marriage license, he replied “criminal.”\n\nIt was part of a ceremony Jan. 25 held in the basement of the county courthouse.\n\n“That was a joke. Did they write it down that way?” asked Gould, 30, who was escorted by sheriff’s deputies.\n\n“Well, he is a criminal,” said York County Sheriff Bill Hose.\n\nGould married 27-year-old Valentina Marie Natasha Roberts, the mother of his two children. No family or friends were allowed in the courtroom where the wedding took place.\n\nGould was convicted Jan. 10 of multiple robbery counts in a 1999 gas station holdup. His new wife is on probation until 2003; she pleaded guilty to supplying Gould and a co-defendant with handguns used in the robbery.\n\nValentina Gould said “it isn’t tough” being married to someone in prison, and she’s standing by her husband.\n\n“I love him; the commitment’s there,” she said.\n\nHeading out\n\nANNAPOLIS, Md. — Maryland’s former first lady — not the current one — soon will sit for an oil portrait that may hang permanently in the governor’s residence.\n\nFrances Glendening and Gov. Parris Glendening divorced in November. But the hanging of their official state portraits will go ahead as planned, said officials with the Government House Foundation. The foundation raises money to pay for the portraits and other improvements to the residence.\n\nThe portraits traditionally are not hung until after a governor is out of office. It is not known whether Glendening’s bride, Jennifer Crawford, 35, a former deputy chief of staff, will request a portrait of her own.\n\nMike Morrill, the governor’s spokesman, said, “They just got married. It’s not the appropriate time to ask.”\n\nThe foundation so far is not raising money for a portrait for Crawford, said board chairman William Myers.\n\nThe former first lady is known for her work promoting the arts in Maryland. She also initiated a Maryland State Archives research project that became an exhibit highlighting the state’s other first ladies.\n\nThe governor, 59, and Frances Glendening, 50, were married nearly 25 years. He married Crawford, the state’s 56th first lady, last month.\n\nFrances Glendening said she looks forward to sitting for the portrait and plans to wear “something bright.”\n\n———\n\nITHACA, N.Y. (AP) — Wanted: ornery felines.\n\nResearchers have begun recruiting 20 of the most foul-mannered cats in upstate New York for an experiment to see whether drugs will calm their nerves and stop fights.\n\nBehavior specialists at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine want to test the theory that the scrappy cats are really suffering from social anxiety.\n\n“We’re looking for 20 real bullies — the ones that start the fights — to see whether cat-to-cat aggression can be reduced with anti-anxiety medication,” said Tracy Kroll, a veterinary resident and researcher in Cornell’s Animal Behavior Clinic.\n\nThe researchers will be using clomipramine, which is used in humans under the brand name Anafranil to treat panic and anxiety disorders. In dogs, under the brand name Clomicalm, it treats “separation anxiety,” when canines find the absence of their owners to be unbearable.\n\n“Some of the over-anxiety may be territorial or it may start when you bring a new cat into the house,” Kroll said. “Then there’s the so-called redirected aggression, when your indoor cat can’t reach a cat outside the window, so it fights with a sibling or other feline friend inside.”\n\nFBI says another terror attack may be imminent\n\nWASHINGTON — The FBI issued an extraordinary terrorist alert Monday night, asking law enforcement and the American public to be on the lookout for a Yemeni man and several associates who might be plotting a terrorist attack as early as today.\n\nThe FBI scrambled to put the warning out after information emerged that one or more people were involved. Officials said the intelligence, while deemed credible, was not specific about possible targets.\n\nThe alert identified one possible attacker as Fawaz Yahya al-Rabeei, a Yemeni national born in Saudia Arabia in 1979. It listed about a dozen associates of al-Rabeei.\n\nThe bureau planned to put photos and information on a Web site to help Americans identify the possible perpetrators.\n\n“Recent information indicates a planned attack may occurred in the United States or against U.S. interests on or around Feb. 12, 2002. One or more operatives may be involved in the attack,” the alert to 18,000 law enforcement agencies said.\n\nThe alert asked police “to stop and detain” any of the named individuals in alert and that all “should be considered extremely dangerous.”\n\nSteve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said all state agencies were on high alert after the FBI issued its warning.\n\n“We’ve been advised of the specific names on the list,” Maviglio said.\n\nLaw enforcement officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the alert was prompted by recent information from interviews of detainees in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where several al-Qaida operatives are being held.\n\nLaw enforcement officials said there was no evidence that al-Rabeei had entered the United States. The alert did not say whether the attack was planned or that it involved Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaida network. Before Monday, FBI and Homeland Security officials had issued three general alerts urging all Americans to be cautious and on the lookout for possible terrorist activities.\n\nBay Area Briefs\n\nBay Area Briefs\n\nSurfers swept away in riptide\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — Ten surfers were plucked from the Pacific Ocean after an unusually strong riptide swept them out and kept them from returning to shore.\n\nTwo U.S. Coast Guard boats training in a nearby area were diverted to the scene Sunday to rescue the surfers, said Coast Guard spokesman Darrin Wallace.\n\nWallace said nine of the surfers were picked up off about 300 to 400 yards off the coast of Ocean Beach. One surfer was taken aboard a passing sailboat about half a mile from the shore. No one was injured.\n\nWallace said the surfers preferred to be dropped off a few yards from the beach where they were able to swim to shore.\n\nThe Coast Guard also dispatched a helicopter to scan along the coast but found no one else in distress.\n\nOakland library sets them free\n\nOAKLAND — The Oakland Public Library has forgiven almost $120,000 in overdue fines and restored borrowing privileges for nearly 58,000 patrons.\n\nThe amnesty program was mainly aimed at a large number of middle and high school students. Officials hope that forgiving fines will bring students back into the fold. Some 20,000 students had borrowing privileges revoked because of unpaid fines for lost or overdue books.\n\nOnce a patron accumulates $12.50 in fines, library privileges are suspended.\n\nThe Oakland Unified School District co-sponsored the program and publicized it with banners at local high schools.\n\nThe foundation dilemma\n\nSAN JOSE — The public parking garage being constructed downtown already has a problem: Its foundation was built 5 feet from where it belonged.\n\nAs a result, the project had to be redesigned — and 20 parking spaces disappeared, leaving 755 spaces.\n\nThe seven-story structure was approved a year ago by the City Council.\n\nThe foundation problem has delayed the opening of the project until December — seven months late. And the garage’s estimated cost, first pegged at $31.4 million, has increased to $54.1 million.\n\nThe contractor, Hensel Phelps Construction Co., a national firm with an office in San Jose, blames the mistake on a survey company hired to lay out the foundation.\n\nJon W. Ball, vice president of Hensel Phelps, did not want to name the surveying firm or comment on the issue, saying that both companies are in the middle of a disputed resolution.\n\nThe council is expected to vote Tuesday on another $280,000 to pay for work related to the error.\n\nStanford OKs ‘living wage’; student group says it’s too low\n\nSAN JOSE — Stanford University will require some companies that perform campus work to pay their employees a “living wage,” but student activists who have insisted upon such a rule said Monday the plan falls short of what they wanted.\n\nStanford President John Hennessy announced last week that the private university will require that some subcontractors pay workers at least $10.10 an hour with benefits, or $11.35 without benefits. California’s minimum wage is $6.75 an hour.\n\nThe policy will apply to companies that have multiyear Stanford contracts worth more than $100,000 annually and use workers not covered by a collective bargaining agreement.\n\nAdministrators are not certain how many workers would be affected, but Chris R. Christofferson, Stanford’s associate vice provost for facilities, estimated it could be about 100.\n\nStudents on the Stanford Labor Action Coalition complained Monday that the plan does not cover enough Stanford workers. They also said they were not properly consulted on the decision and that the living wage is too low.\n\nEven people making well above $10.10 an hour in this exorbitantly expensive area struggle to get by, said Molly Goldberg, a Stanford freshman in the labor group.\n\nShe and other Stanford students will ask Hennessy to impose a “prevailing wage,” based on the average pay of similar workers in the region, and ensure a range of other perks. That would go even beyond Harvard University’s recent announcement that it would raise several hundred workers’ pay beyond the “living wage” that its students had demanded during a three-week sit-in last year.\n\n“We want the university to agree to a code of conduct that addresses more than the wage issue,” Goldberg said. “We want to look at things like education and health benefits, and family leave policies that we also think are important to provide to workers.”\n\nStanford’s Christofferson said students’ criticism was understandable but added that the living wage policy is still being finalized, and the minimum pay requirements could rise.\n\nSF city attorney sues PG&E Corp.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — City Attorney Dennis Herrera sued Pacific Gas and Electric Co.’s parent corporation Monday, accusing it of driving the utility into bankruptcy through unfair and illegal business practices.\n\nThe suit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, asks PG&E Corp. to return as much as $5 billion to ratepayers. That includes $4.6 billion in dividends and stock purchases Herrera alleges were illegal, plus $663 million in tax payments made by the utility to its parent.\n\n“What we’re alleging is that PG&E essentially defrauded California ratepayers,” said Marc Slavin, deputy city attorney. The suit alleges the parent company ignored state regulations requiring it to keep the utility financially healthy.\n\nGreg Pruett, a spokesman for PG&E Corp. said the issues raised already have been reviewed and found to be invalid.\n\n“It’s unfortunate when such a great city as San Francisco resorts to political tactics by filing this type of a lawsuit as an attempt to obstruct Pacific Gas and Electric Co.’s emergence from bankruptcy,” Pruett said.\n\nSlavin said the city’s suit complements another one filed a month earlier before by state Attorney General Bill Lockyer.\n\nThe utility filed for federal bankruptcy protection 10 months ago after soaring power prices drove it into debt.\n\nS.F. Chronicle managing editor resigns\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — Jerry Roberts will step down as managing editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, the paper and Roberts announced Monday.\n\nNo replacement was announced. Executive Editor Phil Bronstein appointed senior editor Narda Zacchino as assistant executive editor and Sunday editor Kenn Altine as associate managing editor.\n\n“Zacchino and Altine will assume many of Roberts’ responsibilities while the paper conducts a nationwide search for a managing editor,” the Chronicle said in a press release. The staff was notified Monday by memos sent by Bronstein and Roberts.\n\nRoberts’ departure is effective March 1, although Monday was to be his final day in the Chronicle news room.\n\n“The first thing I’m going to do is take a family vacation in Mexico, and then come back and take a good look at several opportunities that I’m lucky to have in teaching, writing and broadcasting,” Roberts said in his memo.\n\nRoberts, 53, joined the Chronicle in 1977 and served as reporter, political editor, political columnist and city editor before being named managing editor in 1997. In November 2000, the Hearst Corp., which previously owned the San Francisco Examiner, took control of the Chronicle and installed Bronstein as executive editor.\n\nRoberts’ departure follows that of Matthew Wilson, who resigned as vice president of news and associate publisher in July. Wilson was the Chronicle executive editor before the Hearst Corp. took over the paper. Sharon Rosenhause, who served as the Examiner’s managing editor under Hearst and as editor of Hearst’s afternoon Chronicle, resigned in March to become managing editor of South Florida Sun-Sentinel.\n\n———\n\nOn the Net:\n\nhttp://www.sfgate.com\n\nPayPal may shut down in Louisiana, casting cloud over IPO\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — PayPal Inc. warned Monday its popular online payment service is about to be shut down in Louisiana by that state’s banking regulators, casting another cloud over the company’s widely anticipated initial public offering of stock.\n\nThe imminent shutdown of PayPal’s service in Louisiana was disclosed in Securities and Exchange Commission documents. They detail the risks the Palo Alto-based company faces as it tries to overcome the stock market’s distaste for unprofitable Internet companies.\n\nPayPal had hoped to sell 5.4 million shares at $12 to $14 apiece last week, but a patent infringement lawsuit filed by CertCo Inc. threatened to short circuit the company’s online payment service. That prompted investment bankers to delay the IPO until this week.\n\nIn a counterclaim filed Monday in Delaware, PayPal sought to invalidate CertCo’s patent claim and alleged the New York-based company waited until the last minute to file its complaint to disrupt PayPal’s IPO.\n\nThe delay forced PayPal to disclose several new developments, including word that Louisiana regulators sent a Feb. 7 letter ordering the service to stop brokering payments between online buyers and sellers until the company receives a money transmission license.\n\nMonday’s bad news might pressure PayPal to lower its IPO price or pull the offering, said Kyle Huske, an analyst with IPO.com.\n\n“Obviously, you don’t want these kinds of negatives to come out in a panicky market like this,” Huske said. “It’s tough to say what will happen now. It’s all going to depend on the fortitude of the investors that they had already lined up for the IPO.”\n\nWith the latest revisions to its outlook, PayPal now hopes to set the IPO Thursday, paving the way for the company’s shares to begin trading Friday on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.\n\nAt the current target price, PayPal’s IPO would raise more than $60 million. As of Sept. 30, the company had $138.6 million in the bank and its losses have been steadily diminishing over the past year.\n\nIn its SEC filing Monday, PayPal said it will comply with the Louisiana order forcing it to suspend business in that state when management receives the notice. The company also said it may appeal the Louisiana order in an administrative hearing.\n\nPayPal’s Louisiana customers accounted for 0.9 percent of the service’s payment volume during the first nine months of last year, according to the SEC documents. The company makes its money by collecting a commission based on the dollar amount of most transactions completed on its e-mail service.\n\nAlthough Louisiana represents a small portion of PayPal’s overall business, the company’s regulatory problems in that state might not be isolated, management conceded in Monday’s filing.\n\nBesides Louisiana, New York also has notified PayPal the company is running an unlicensed banking business. The New York regulators still haven’t ordered PayPal to stop doing business there, which accounted for 6.4 percent of the payment volume handled by the company during the first nine months of last year.\n\nPayPal said regulators in nine other states and the District of Columbia have indicated the company needs a license to run its online payment service. Those states are: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Massachusetts, Maryland, Texas, Virginia and Vermont.\n\nThe company said it has already filed, or plans to file, applications in those states and the District of Columbia. Based on management’s analysis, the company also has decided to seek money transfer licenses in Connecticut, Minnesota and North Carolina.\n\nPayPal already is licensed in Oregon and West Virginia.\n\nIf state regulators determine PayPal has been running an illegal banking business, the company could face substantial fines dating back to when the service began with 24 users in October 1999. The service had ballooned to 12.8 million accountholders as of Dec. 31.\n\n———\n\nOn The Net:\n\nhttp://www.paypal.com\n\nhttp://www.certco.com\n\nIntel unveils processors for handheld gadgets\n\nSANTA CLARA — Intel Corp. introduced a family of microprocessors Monday that promise to improve the performance and increase the battery life of handheld devices such as cell phones and palm-sized computers.\n\nThe Intel PXA250 and PXA210 processors will enable improved music, movies and games on next-generation gadgets, which are expected to become popular as wireless networks are upgraded in coming months.\n\n“We want to make this explode and be the next $100 billion market,” said Mark Casey of Intel’s handheld-computer division. “To make that happen, you need good clients and a fast wireless connection.”\n\nThe PXA210 will run at speeds up to 200 megahertz and will be used in cell phones, entry-level handhelds and wireless devices. The larger PXA250 will run at clock speeds up to 400 MHz and be part of high-end handheld devices.\n\nProducts built with the new processors are expected to be available by the middle of this year.\n\nThe technology, which is called XScale, is based on the StrongARM architecture that Intel acquired as part of a settlement with Digital Equipment Corp. in 1997.\n\nCambridge-based ARM Ltd. licenses its chip designs to semiconductor companies, which then manufacture the processors.\n\nIntel StrongARM processors are now found in most handheld computers using the Windows CE operating system.\n\nMost Palm OS-based systems use Motorola Inc.’s Dragonball processor.\n\n———\n\nOn the Net:\n\nIntel: http://www.intel.com\n\nARM Ltd: http://www.arm.com\n\nToymax stock soars on takeover news\n\nLOS ANGELES — Shares of Toymax International Inc. were up 38 percent Monday after it agreed to be acquired by Jakks Pacific Inc. for more than $54 million in cash and stock.\n\nShares of the Plainview, N.Y.-based toy company were up $1.17 to $4.22 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Shares of Jakks, based in Malibu, Calif., were down 24 cents to $18.56.\n\nJakks announced Sunday it will pay $3 per share in cash and $1.50 in stock to acquire the 64 percent of Toymax controlled by its two founders. The remaining shares will be acquired from stockholders later in the year.\n\nThere is no danger the deal could be in jeopardy if Toymax stock rises above the $4.50 purchase price, according to William Gibson, an analyst for Banc of America Securities, because Jakks signed a definitive agreement with the founders of Toymax.\n\nGibson said the purchase, which makes Jakks one of the country’s largest toy companies, was a good deal at a good price.\n\n“Jack doesn’t overpay,” Gibson said, referring to Jakks co-founder and chief executive Jack Friedman. “He buys right and he’s doing it again”\n\nJakks announced Monday it has signed a deal with The Walt Disney Co. to develop arts and activities products and junior sports toys based on Disney characters, including Winnie the Pooh, as well as characters from new films.\n\nWildcat is captured on canvas\n\nCollege Freshman Derek Moser tried to capture a pose of the golden-brown King Cheetah lounging on a table in front of his anatomy and life drawing class.\n\n\"I’ve drawn human models, cadavers,\" Moser said. \"This is my first time drawing an animal. It’s different, it’s really neat.\"\n\nThe brown-eyed Kgosi, handled by trainer Rob Dicely, sat for several minutes on the line of tables meant to elevate him. Then he rose and walked back and forth, licked his master’s palm and at times, just stared at the American flag outside the window. Moser’s job was to try to catch the almost three-year-old, 100 lbs, wildcat in action.\n\n\"You have a pose, then they move,\" he said. \"So, you kind of draw from imagination.\"\n\nAs part of the class, students also had three other surprises in store for them – a Siberian lynx, a brown mountain lion, and a snow leopard cub, all courtesy of \"Leopards Etc.,\" an organization that runs a wildcat compound in Sonoma county.\n\nArt instructor Catherine Firpo uses the animals once every quarter to pose for three of her classes. The exercise, she said, enables students to draw quickly, and capture the figure in action and right proportion. The exercise is also special on another level.\n\n\"I want the students to understand the species and honor them,\" Firpo said. \"We are detached from nature and this forces us to remember there is a world out there.\"\n\nTo make sure this happens, Dicely and his wife offer a lecture while the students draw.\n\nOn Tuesday, they learned the cheetah’s small ears and powerful muscles help him reach a speed of 45 miles per hour in two seconds. And, Dicely told them, the cheetah devours his prey in less than an hour and provides no defense for his food if it’s snatched by other wildcats.\n\nThe Dicelys routinely show their animals at various schools and colleges to educate the public. They say the live climbing and leaping demonstrations help spread awareness about the animals’ plight.\n\nOn a 22-acre compound in Occidental, the Dicelys have raised 24 cats in captivity. They include cheetah, blank panther, snow leopard, and lynx, among others.\n\n\"I feel strongly that these are the ambassadors for the ones left in the wild,\" Barbara Dicely said. She said she doesn’t advocate raising wild animals as pets and added that her animals regularly help raise money for nonprofit organizations.\n\nStudent Vonetta Patrice wasn’t too bothered by the captivity issue. Sitting in the back and moving her pencil in quick, short strokes, Patrice, just remembered the majesty of the wildcats.\n\n\"The wildcat is really gracious and beautiful,\" she said. \"Seeing it live, you get a better appreciation of the animal.\"\n\nUC administrator needs to get in gear\n\nEditor:\n\nUCB Transportation Director Nadesan Permaul is out of touch. UC Berkeley needs to work to replace single-driver cars with efficient, affordable, user-friendly public transportation for staff and faculty. UCB needs more student housing, not more parking lots.

They had already blown a halftime lead and were down, 42-38, to archrival Salesian. But St. Mary’s head coach Jose Caraballo still had an ace up his sleeve: DaShawn Freeman.\n\nNormally St. Mary’s starting point guard, Freeman missed the first half of the season with a stress fracture in his leg. He played only three minutes of the first half on Saturday after getting sick late in the week. But when his team needed him, he answered the bell.\n\nWith Freeman back in the game directing traffic on offense and creating havoc on defense, the Panthers (22-2, 10-0 BSAL) ripped off a 19-0 run to take control of the game. When Freeman left the game after just eight minutes of action, St. Mary’s had turned a four-point deficit into a 62-46 lead, ensuring they would stay undefeated in BSAL play with an 70-57 win.\n\n“I felt it when I came in the game. We just got an energy surge,” Freeman said. “We were just in the moment, and it seemed like everybody was everywhere for us.”\n\nSaturday’s game was the fourth time the Panthers have beaten Salesian (14-7, 7-3) in the last two seasons, with each game a tightly-contested affair.\n\nFreeman played just over 12 minutes of the game, but he made the most of his time with 13 points, 4 steals and 4 assists. Backcourt mate John Sharper struggled from the field, shooting just 4-for-11, but made up for it by being perfect from the free-throw line. Sharper hit all 14 of his foul shots, giving him a game-high 24 points to go with 6 steals. He carried the Panthers in the first half, scoring the game’s first six points with Freeman saving his energy for the end, and was unusually aggressive against the Chieftans, resulting in his numerous trips to the charity stripe.\n\n“I didn’t even know I shot that many times,” Sharper said when told of his perfect effort. “I’ve never shot that many free throws in one game before.”\n\nThe Panthers needed everything they got from their backcourt, because Salesian dominated the paint. The Chieftans won the rebounding battle 40-21 and held St. Mary’s big men Chase Moore and Simon Knight to a combined 11 points and 8 rebounds. But when Freeman came in the game for a four-guard setup, Salesian couldn’t match the speed of the Panthers’ defense.\n\n“We had a lot of speed in there, because we needed to change the tempo of the game,” Freeman said.”\n\nSharper also did a superlative job on defense against Salesian star John Winston, who finished with just 9 points on 4-of-16 shooting. Sharper and Freeman both play on the same AAU team with Winston, so they had a special insight into how to slow him down.\n\n“They did a great job on John tonight,” Salesian head coach Bill Mellis said. “But they also stopped our other scorers, so I think John felt more pressure to put more on his shoulders.”\n\nWinston’s night was nicely summed up by a play with the game already decided. Down 14 points, Winston swiped the ball from the Panthers in the open court and had an easy score. But he tried to take his frustrations out on one dunk, and he bounced it off the back rim and all the way to center court, where St. Mary’s Moore calmly collected it.\n\nSalesian was led by Brandon Jones’ 13 points, with Kyle Lankford helping our with 11 points.\n\nSaturday’s game was held at Contra Costa College rather than Salesian’s tiny gym, but even with the extra room the crowd was standing-room-only, and the organizers were forced to turn people away after the game started. Saturday also marked the first appearance of “The Rock,” a golden basketball trophy that will pass between the schools with each year’s regular-season game.\n\n“It’s a great rivalry, and this was a good game,” Caraballo said. “We’ll probably see them again in the playoffs.”\n\nBerkeley named a best bet for the disabled\n\nBerkeley, which has a long history of firsts in accessibility issues, is among the 10 finalists for the National Organization on Disability’s first annual Accessibility America contest.\n\n“Berkeley has been on the forefront of disability access issues for a long time,” said Mayor Shirley Dean. “We still have lots to do but if we keep doing a little bit every year, as we have been, we’ll get there.”\n\nBerkeley and nine other cities were chosen from 65 contest entries. The other cities include Irvine, Cailf., Eugene and Portland, Ore. and Houston, Texas.\n\nThe NOD will present the mayor of the winning community with a check for $25,000, which will used for additional accessibility projects. A panel of five judges will chose the winner on Tuesday. Berkeley residents were among the first in the country to organize.\n\nWhere on Earth is bin Laden, anyway?\n\nEditor:\n\nParents of today's teens and pre-teens may remember a children's television show with a similar title which aired for a few seasons in the mid-1990s. In that animated series, title character Carmen Sandiego, the world's greatest thief, was on the loose and it was up to the ACME Detective Agency to solve her clues and track her down.\n\nMost of the time, the wily thief managed to stay far enough ahead of the crime fighters at the detective agency where she formerly worked to elude capture.\n\nToday's version is not for children and certainly no laughing matter.\n\nThe world's most wanted man, the man with bounties on his head in the tens of millions, and the man who plotted the murder of over 3,000 Americans has eluded capture.\n\nThe most recent hope that bin Laden may have been struck was last week when a CIA-operated unmanned spy plane, armed with Hellfire missiles, scored what appeared to be a direct hit on three white-robed men in Afghanistan. CNN reported that one was believed to be a senior leader of al-Qaeda, the terrorist organization headed by bin Laden.\n\nHowever, the question on everyone's mind remained unanswered.\n\n“We just simply have no idea” if bin Laden was among those killed, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said.\n\nPresident Bush last week praised the military for how much progress has been made in the war on terrorism. But in the same breath, he said defensively that the capture of bin Laden is not the prime barometer for success. His tune has changed since Sept. 17, when he said that bin Laden was “Wanted, dead or alive.”\n\nDespite the current public statements to the contrary, the Bush administration would dearly love to have the al-Qaeda leader in either condition. Like a fisherman focused on a prize catch, the collective U.S. consciousness is frustrated by the one that got away. Therefore, last week's report from CIA Director George Tenet that nearly 1,000 al-Qaeda operatives have been arrested or detained in 60 countries since Sept. 11 went largely unnoticed and unheralded.\n\nTenet warned that despite the progress, “operations against U.S. targets could be launched by al-Qaeda cells already in place in major cities in Europe and the Middle East. Al-Qaeda can also exploit its presence or connections to other groups in such countries as Somalia, Yemen, Indonesia and the Philippines.\n\n“I must repeat that al-Qaeda has not yet been destroyed,” he said.\n\nAl-Qaeda's strength is fueled, in part, by its members' notion that its leader has been blessed by Allah. In their eyes, how else could one man elude the full effort and resources of the evil West, which has surveillance cameras capable of reading automobile license tags from space? It merely adds legendary and mythical qualities to bin Laden's image of never staying in one place long enough to become a fixed target. Even when it looked like he was trapped in Tora Bora in December, somehow he eluded capture.\n\nCharacters of myth, legend and animation achieve more than mortal man. The U.S. has to knock bin Laden out of the former classification and into the latter as soon as possible. Each day that goes by without some determination of bin Laden's fate or location strengthens the belief and resolve of his followers.\n\nSo when Bush, Rumsfeld, Tenet or any other administration official downplays the need to find bin Laden, know that in reality it remains job number one. He is a formidable foe and his eventual capture, dead or alive, will break the resolve of whatever active al-Qaeda cells remain.\n\nTom Mitsoff\n\nBerkeley\n\nTamir leads Bears past Oregon in double OT\n\nCal in four-way tie for third place in Pac-10 Conference\n\nFreshman Amit Tamir scored a career-high 39 points to lead Cal out of a deep hole and defeat Oregon, 107-103, in double overtime on Saturday night at Haas Pavilion.\n\nShantay Legans also scored a season-high 22 for the Golden Bears as they rallied to knock off the No. 13 ranked Ducks, who held a 19-point lead in the first half. The win marked the Bears’ greatest comeback since they trailed Arizona State by 20 in a 95-78 win in 1994.\n\nThe win improves Cal’s record to 17-5 overall and 8-4 in the Pac-10, while Oregon falls to 17-7 and 9-4 in conference. Cal is now in a four-way tie for third place – with Stanford, UCLA and USC – while Oregon falls behind Arizona into second place.\n\nThe Ducks could still be in first if they could have held on their big first-half lead. Guards Luke Jackson and Frederick Jones were thorns in Cal’s side all night, scoring 29 and 23 points, respectively. Jackson and Jones kept bringing the Ducks back almost every time Cal threatened to win the game.\n\nBut in the end, the Ducks’ duo was no match for Tamir and Legans. Tamir scored the first five points of the second overtime period and Legans the next eight to build a 102-95 lead for the Bears. Tamir capped the night with one more free throw and forward Joe Shipp stole the ball from Jones to finally put an end to the Ducks.\n\n“I’m so happy for our guys,” Cal coach Ben Braun said. “They work so hard. Oregon’s a terrific team. They showed you that. They worked so well in the first half. I give our guys credit because we had to withstand a furious assault from them.”\n\nBoth teams shot well for the game, with Cal shooting 57.1 percent to Oregon’s 55.7 percent.\n\nOregon held a 13-point lead at halftime, thanks to lights out shooting mainly from Jackson and Jones. Overall, the Ducks shot 66.7 percent in the first 20 minutes and made 7-of-11 three-point shots in the half. Jackson, a big guard who was a big matchup problem defensively for Cal and Joe Shipp in particular, led the Ducks with 13 points in the half, while Jones had 10.\n\n“[Jackson] is so effective off at getting off the dribble,” Braun said. “At the same time he gets the shot off, because he’s 6-7. He’s a tough matchup. Freddie Jones is a terrific player. He’s really improved his shooting. He’s so dangerous because he can knock down the three now. When you jam him, he’s an explosive a player as there is, because he can get to the rim as well as anybody in our league.”\n\nBut Cal’s defense held the Ducks to just 42.9 percent shooting in the second half, while the Bears clawed their way back with 62.1 percent shooting. They slowed down Jackson and Jones, at least for a little while, by using different defenders against each and then went on a 23-8 run. Cal made a concerted effort to push the ball up court, which led to some easy baskets including layups for Legans and Shipp. A Ryan Forehan-Kelly three capped the run at the 12:22 mark and gave Cal the lead at 58-56.\n\nTamir scored 19 of his points in the second stanza. His 39 points were the fifth-highest total in Cal history and the most since Ed Gray scored 48 points against Washington State in 1998,\n\n“Amit Tamir has a lot of experience,” Oregon coach Ernie Kent said. “His body has been through a lot of games and he’s a veteran, experienced player that knows how to get it done. If Luke Jackson or Freddie Jones were his age, they would’ve had an easier time with him. Tamir stepped up with some big buckets tonight.”\n\n“As Oregon was pulling away,” Braun said, “Amit, I thought, very calmly but routinely, took some shots that were there and he made some big plays for us. He seemed to give our team confidence. He and Shantay generated a lot of enthusiasm and made the guys around them better.”\n\n‘East Bay’s Progressive Team’ rallies the faithful\n\nRep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, came home to the most gorgeous weather – and the cheeriest group of well-wishers when she and Loni Hancock, a candidate for the state Assembly, appeared at their joint campaign office on Saturday.\n\n“I could not have wished for a better day to walk the streets of Berkeley,” said Patrick Campbell, a Hancock staffer and former Associated Students of the University of California president, as he exhorted around 40 Hancock and Lee supporters to spend the afternoon going door to door.\n\nThe get out the vote effort was held at the joint Lee-Hancock HQ at 2472 Shattuck Ave. and was planned in coordination with a recent mailer called “the East Bay’s Progressive Team.”\n\n“This district is very important in terms of progressive politics,” Lee said. “We need to send a message to Sacramento and the rest of the country that we still prefer to build schools over prisons, health care over bombs.”\n\n“Loni will embrace this in the assembly, just as she has embraced it all her life.”\n\nLee is heavily favored over Kevin Green in her 9th district congressional bid. Hancock, on the other hand, faces stiff competition from Charles Ramsey, an El Cerrito attorney and member of the West Contra Costa school board, and Dave Brown, former chief of staff for Alameda County Supervisor Alice Lai-Bitker.\n\n“This race is not going to be a slam-dunk,” she said. “I have two very well-funded opponents and only three weeks left (before the March 5 primary).”\n\nHancock emphasized her commitment to progressive positions on education, the economy and the environment in a short speech to her troops.\n\nShow some respect for the First Amendment\n\nThe County Board of Education and County Office of Education have the responsibility to educate the most at risk students in Alameda County.\n\nThe students are either expelled from local schools or incarcerated. The overwhelming majority of them are African American and Latino.\n\nThis is an awesome task. Yet for years, the County Board of Education refuse to provide Special Education services, used Special Education dollars to support other programs, and maintained a nine percent reserve in the budget, when only three percent is required by the State. The lack of Special Education services to students with Individualized Education Programs (IEP) is a gross violation of Federal and State statutes, and worse yet, a violation of the students' civil rights to a free and equal public education. In addition, the use of Special Education funds to support other programs is fraudulent. Clearly, students have not been the focus for the Board.\n\nIn 1999, the County Office of Education administration started to provide Special Education services to students in County programs and schools and comply with the US Department of Education Office of Civil Rights.\n\nWhen I was elected to the County Board of Education District 3 with 62 percent of the vote, my constituents gave me a mandate clamoring for change.\n\nTherefore, I was determined to have the Board focus on students. But since July 1, 2000, the Board's majority has consistently engaged in petty politics of division and intimidation to squelch any opposition. I am now even more determined to focus the Board on students after eighteen months filled with acrimony and receiving an e-mail message from Jerome Wiggins, Trustee Area 1, expressing his disappointment with my support for his opponent Jacki Fox Ruby. Trustee Area 1 covers Albany, Berkeley, Emeryville, Piedmont, and North Oakland.\n\nThe First Amendment grants us freedom of speech and association. We are free to support any political candidate and issue, and belong to any political organization. But Mr. Wiggins, a resident of Berkeley, the cradle of freedom of speech, has resorted to insults and intimidation to stop me from exercising my rights under the First Amendment. Clearly, he is out of touch with the communities he purports to represent.\n\nAs a member of the Metropolitan Greater Oakland Democratic Club, I have been active to gain votes for candidates I support for the March 5 election. Mr. Wiggins may disagree with my support for his opponent, but his uncivil demeanor is unacceptable.\n\nEnrique E.

Chen ignores the intrusion until her students can no longer hear her voice. \"Could you please turn it down,” she shouts and then, without missing a beat, turns back toward her class of five teenagers.\n\nSurrounded by wall murals, the teens sit at a square table snacking on peanut butter sandwiches and cups of soup. Chen, dressed in baggy jeans and a t-shirt like her students, explains to them what the different HTML codes mean.\n\n“What do you mean, ‘a table within a table’?” asks a student. Chen draws it on a piece of paper and the student gets it.\n\nThis is a typical afternoon at the Youth Radio headquarters where Chen trains students in Web site development. Before the dot.com bust, she worked at snowball.com putting together a teen Web site. “Here I have direct interaction with teens,” she said. “At snowball, interaction felt almost manufactured.”\n\nThe Web design program is based on the radio classes where students go through a 10-week training program and learn how to report, write and produce their own radio shows. The only difference is that during this 10-week period, the students in Chen’s class learn how to create web pages.\n\nOn a recent Thursday, the students were in their third week of design class, and the Web pages were simple. One showed a picture of the group, the team logo and a few links to favorite Web sites.”They’ve just started, give them some time,” Chen said.\n\nOnce they graduate from the Web design or radio program, Cari Campbell, the DJ, Web radio and digital audio instructor, teaches the students studio techniques and how to record music onto a computer to be put on the web.\n\nThe Web radio shows were started to absorb many of the 800 or so graduates of Youth Radio who wanted two things: to stay at the station and more music.\n\nWeb radio was the answer and has been a part of the organization since July of 2001. Web radio allows for more students’ voices to be heard. The Youth Radio programs air about 5 hours a week total on KZQZ ,KQED, KCBS AND KPFB.\n\n“With the Web we always have an outlet,” Chen said. “No matter what, you can get your stuff out there.”\n\nBefore they are able to record, students write a proposal outlining the type of\n\nWeb show they want to produce.\n\n“It makes them think ‘what is my show all about?’” Campbell said.\n\nThe students’ shows range from world music to the all-Michael-Jackson mix.\n\nThe projects for the last class can be viewed at http://www.youthradio.org/webradio/index.shtml.\n\nWhen the students have recorded the show on the computer, they edit it together with Campbell, and once it’s finished it is put on the Web. The 30-minute shows stay up on the Web site for as long as possible. “People’s shows stay up until a new thing takes its place,” Campbell said.\n\nWeb radio is now having the students record their own talk shows, where topics range from cell phones to relationships.\n\n“It’s like a round table,” Campbell said. “They have a topic. They write their show and they talk about it.”\n\nEventually, Youth Radio would like to begin live streaming of their shows on the Internet, where listeners can log in and hear live broadcasts of shows, which is currently not being done. Broadcasting live, however, is expensive. “Mainly it’s about getting someone to donate the live servers,” Campbell said. “You need a connection of servers throughout the United States.”\n\nFor Beverly Mire, Youth Radio Deputy Director, the most important thing is that the kids are enjoying it.\n\n“The kids are totally into it,” Mire said. “It will be one of my dreams for Web radio to be on the air live.”\n\nLegendary beauty had an ugly side\n\nBERLIN — Marlene Dietrich was not the femme fatale she played in her films, but was an emotionally distant woman and a harsh disciplinarian with her only child, her grandson said Sunday.\n\nYet this is not the side of the German-born actress and singer that her grandson, director J. David Riva, chose to explore in a documentary.\n\n“Marlene Dietrich: Her Own Story” focuses on her hatred of the Nazis and her passion for the Allied effort to defeat Hitler’s Third Reich.\n\nGermans have long seen Dietrich, who died in 1992, as a symbol of resistance to Hitler — or a traitor.\n\nA star in pre-Nazi Germany, the beautiful blonde whose father was a Prussian general symbolized the Nazi ideal of the “Aryan” woman. Her decision to become a U.S. citizen and work in Hollywood after the Nazis took power in 1933 was a blow to Hitler and his propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels.\n\nRiva, 40, said he culled World War II footage of Dietrich to make a film he hopes will give a fuller picture, especially to Americans.\n\n5 adults arraigned in baby’s death\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — A strange relationship between a man and four women he lived with has been marred by tragedy. The five adults face a Monday arraignment on charges related to an infant’s death and the mistreatment of their 12 other children.\n\nWinifred Wright, 45, Carol Bremner, Mary Campbell, 37, Deirdre Wilson, 37, and Kali Polk-Matthews, 20, were arrested Friday for the November death of a 19-month-old baby.\n\nThe 12 other children, ranging in age from 8-months to 16-years-old, were found malnourished at the Marinwood home. A majority of them suffered from rickets, said Marin County Sheriff’s detective Fred Marziano, lead investigator on the case.\n\nWright, Bremner, Campbell and Wilson each face one count of second-degree murder and multiple counts of involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment. Polk-Matthews faces one count of involuntary manslaughter and one count of child endangerment, Marziano said.\n\nPolice began investigating the large family in November after four women brought a baby to Kaiser Hospital in San Rafael, where he died from “severe malnutrition and neglect,” according to the Marin County Sheriff’s Department. Test confirmed that Wright had fathered all 13 children with Bremner, Campbell and Wilson, Marziano said.\n\nCal student to square off in Hollywood\n\nUniversity of California Berkeley student Woody Hartman’s tic-tac-toe skills will be tested when he matriculates to Hollywood Squares as a contestant, beginning Tuesday, February 19.\n\nThe nationally syndicated Squares can be seen locally each Monday-Friday at 7:30 p.m. on San Francisco station KPIX-TV (CBS).\n\nHartman, a mechanical engineering major, participates in the University of California Rally Committee and is a member of the Associated Students of the University of California. In addition to his studies, Hartman enjoys snowboarding, camping, hiking and film making.\n\nThe participating student contestants recently traveled to Hollywood’s CBS Television City to play the popular game, where each was paired off to compete against a student from a rival university.\n\n“Talking to the stars was the most rewarding thing about my Hollywood Squares experience,\" said Hartman. When it came to preparing for the fast-paced game, the UC Berkeley student noted, “I watched the show as much as possible and studied tic-tac-toe strategies.”\n\nJakks Pacific buys Toymax for $54.7 million\n\nLOS ANGELES — Jakks Pacific Inc., which makes World Wrestling Federation action figures, is buying Toymax International, Inc., which makes kites, water toys and other products.\n\nBased on the number of Toymax shares outstanding on Sept. 30, 2001, the deal is valued at $54.7 million in cash and stock.\n\nThe two-step transaction will give Jakks control of the company by the end of February, when Jakks acquires approximately 64 percent of Toymax’s outstanding shares from the company’s principal stockholders.\n\nJakks will pay $3 per share in cash and the remainder in shares valued at $1.50 each.\n\nToymax will become a wholly owned subsidiary in the second quarter of 2002, when the remaining shares are acquired.\n\nJakks said it will trim some of Toymax’s products, but said no immediate layoffs are planned.\n\nJakks has been growing steadily since it was founded in Malibu in 1995. Earlier this year, it bought Kidz Biz Ltd., a toy distributor based in the United Kingdom, for an undisclosed price, as the first step in a planned European expansion.\n\nThe company’s highest-profile products are the dolls based on WWF personalities such as “The Rock.” But it also makes Remco die-cast vehicles and Child Guidance educational toys.\n\nJakks’s Flying Colors division, which makes crafts and activity sets, just signed a deal with Miramax to make memo pads, portfolio folders, theme books and other products for “Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams,” the sequel to last year’s successful “Spy Kids” movie.\n\n“We are still aggressively seeking new acquisitions,” Stephen Berman, Jakks Pacific president, said Sunday. “We hope that within the next three years, we will be a $1 billion company in terms of revenue.”\n\nToymax makes “Go Fly a Kite” brand kites, Funnoodle pool and water toys and accessories, and markets toys such as “Creepy Crawlers” under the Toymax brand. Shares of Jakks were up $1.27 to $18.80 and shares of Toymax were up 43 cents to $3.05 at the end of regular trading Friday on the Nasdaq Stock Market.\n\nAbortion key in early gubernatorial bouts\n\nHours after Governor Gray Davis released an advertisement slamming Richard Riordan, the GOP front runner in the gubernatorial race, for his shifting views on abortion issues, Riordan launched a counterattack of his own.\n\n“Enron’s Favorite Governor, Gray Davis,” Riordan said last Monday, calling for Davis to return the more than $15,000 accepted from Enron between 1996 and 2000.\n\nBut many are still talking about Davis’ television ad, which broadcast segments of a 1991 Riordan interview, in which the former Los Angeles mayor told a reporter that he agreed with the Catholic Church’s stance on abortion.\n\n“Being fairly liberal-minded, I surprise myself at my emotions on the abortion issue,” Riordan said during the interview. “Because I feel very—I think it’s murder.”\n\nSome say he has already lost support among women voters. Female leaders gathered in Sacramento on Monday to question him about his stance on abortion. Riordan and his campaign staff insist that he is pro-choice, regardless of his personal views. Carolina Guevera, deputy director of communications of Riordan For Governor, yesterday called Davis’ ads “a carefully orchestrated attack.”\n\nShe said Davis knows Riordan has won over people who usually support Democrats.\n\n“That conversation was over 10 years ago,” Guevera said of Riordan’s statement on abortion. “It was taken out of context. The mayor (was) expressing his views as a Catholic.”\n\nShe said Davis’ early attack—a month before Riordan faces challengers Bill Jones and Bill Simon in the March 5 primary election—shows that the governor considers Riordan a strong threat.\n\nGuevera also said Davis is trying to distract Californians from unemployment rates, the deficit, and campaign contributions from Enron.\n\nBut Roger Salazar, Davis’ press secretary, said the advertisement is merely a way to provide voters with the facts.\n\n“People should know what he has said,” Salazar said. “And whether his rhetoric now matches that.”\n\nLast month Davis released another advertisement attacking Riordan, which detailed thousands of dollars in contributions that Riordan made to anti-abortion groups. For example, he gave $10,000 to Americans United for Life, a group devoted to making abortion illegal.\n\n“Abortion is a violent deception that results in two victims: the child whose life is destroyed, and the woman who suffers devastating physical and psychological harm,” the group’s Web site reads.\n\nDavis supporters say Riordan has flip-flopped on death penalty and minimum wage laws as well.\n\n“There are a whole range of issues in which he’s changed his mind, or he’s just saying what he’s saying to get elected,” Salazar said. “Or maybe he’s just lost his marbles.”\n\nRiordan is one of many California Republicans who have struggled with the abortion issue.\n\nIn California, a predominantly pro-choice state with the highest abortion rate in the nation, many anti-abortion Republicans now avoid discussing their beliefs This worries pro-choice activists.\n\n“We’re not in a position where we can comment on Riordan’s views,” Dunlap said. “We don’t have a record from him. He considers himself pro-choice, but there is documented proof of him donating to pro-life groups.”\n\nThe group endorsed Governor Davis. Riordan is not considered “100 percent” pro-choice.\n\nBelle Taylor-McGhee, the executive director of CARRAL, said many candidates claim they oppose abortion, but promise to uphold the law if elected.\n\n“Our position is to make sure they don’t get that opportunity,” she said.\n\nEven better digital camera on the way\n\nSANTA CLARA — Digital photography is constantly improving, allowing, for instance, 3-megapixel cameras to drop in price from $1000 a year ago to under $500 today.\n\nNow Santa Clara-based Foveon Inc. hopes to shake up the digital camera industry with a new kind of image-sensing chip it claims could double the quality of pictures at either the same cost or less for camera makers.\n\nFoveon will announce Monday that its new X3 image sensors captures true colors as never before.\n\nIf the breakthrough technology is ever widely used in products, analysts say consumers could one day see higher-performance cameras without paying more.\n\nThe chip achieves a technological “holy grail in digital photography,” said Alexis Gerard, president of Future Image Inc., a digital imaging research consulting firm in San Mateo. “And it will simplify the design of digital cameras which will reduce their costs.”\n\nFor the past few years, the camera industry has been racing to achieve higher pixels, which translates to sharper pictures. The highest-pixel point-and-shoot cameras are now at 5 megapixels.\n\nBut until now, image sensors inside the cameras can only partially capture the three primary colors — red, green and blue. Except for high-end professional cameras which use multiple chips to carry out the task of achieving true-color capture, most digital cameras resort to using software to help it extrapolate the colors for the picture.\n\nFoveon claims its X3 technology attains higher quality for each pixel itself by capturing the three primary colors completely and all at once. It does so by stacking three photodetectors in the silicon at each pixel.\n\nFoveon’s first camera-maker customer will be Sigma Corporation, which will use the X3 chip in one of its professional camera models, due to be introduced later this month.\n\nBut some analysts question whether the major camera manufacturers, such as Sony, Olympus, Nikon, Canon and Fuji, will want to invest in Foveon’s new technology.\n\n“Competitive market pressure will impede the penetration of the product,” said Chris Chute, a senior analyst of the digital imaging industry for the International Data Group market research firm.\n\nCamera makers are constantly churning out new models, and changing chip technologies will slow the production process, Chute said.\n\nCity pores over airport security price tag\n\nThe San Francisco Airport Commission wants the Board of Supervisors to adopt a resolution that authorizes the $19.3 million purchase of several explosive detection systems to improve the airport’s security.\n\nThe money is coming from the city, but will be reimbursed by the federal government.\n\nBoard president Supervisor Tom Ammiano said the resolution to spend the funds should take only a couple of weeks to approve. The airport has four CTX-9000 explosive detection systems in place now. These were purchased in May 2000, under a similar arrangement between the city and the federal government.\n\nThe new machines will be in place by the end of the year.\n\n“It will take a minimum of six months to purchase and build, and then several more months to install, put on line and test,” said Ron Wilson, an airport spokesperson.\n\nUnlike the existing Stage 1 x-ray machines, which scan like a two-dimension x-ray, the new machine will automatically evaluate each bag for the presence of explosives and provide a more detailed x-ray.\n\nThe machines comply with the increased security measures called for in the newly enacted Aviation and Transportation Security Act.\n\n“The reimbursement agreement for eleven additional CTX systems at SFO will allow SFO to meet 100 percent of the screening needs of all airlines operating at the international terminal, both present and in the future,” according to a letter written November 29, 2001 by Airport Director, John L. Martin. “This will allow the Airport to utilize 100 percent three dimensional CTX scanning in the new terminal.”\n\nSan Francisco International Airport experienced a breach in security on Wednesday, January 30, when a rookie checkpoint screener’s mistake shut down the United’s terminal for approximately an hour and caused the evacuation of thousands of travelers. In that instance, an explosive trace detector was used to identify the presence of explosive materials, but due to lack of training, the screener failed to report the security breach quickly.\n\nIn theory, scenes like that will be rare once the new machines are installed, Wilson said. “By the time the machines are installed, security screening will be managed by the Federal government,” he wrote in an email responding to questions. “They will be responsible for the training and hiring of screening personnel.”\n\nRamsey ripped for PG&E donations\n\nLoni Hancock and Dave Brown, candidates for the 14th District state Assembly seat, criticized rival Charles Ramsey for accepting a $3,000 PG&E campaign contribution and took him to task on his school board record during a Thursday night debate at UC Berkeley.\n\nRamsey, who serves on the West Contra Costa Unified School Board, downplayed the PG&E contribution and talked of the school district’s “exemplary” financial record since he took office.\n\nHancock, former Berkeley mayor, suggested that it is improper to take a PG&E campaign contribution while the utility company pursues a controversial bankruptcy settlement in the courts.\n\nHancock raised particular concerns about PG&E’s effort, as part of the settlement, to transfer $8 billion worth of assets, including hydro-electric dams, to its federally-regulated parent corporation, escaping the reach of state regulators.\n\nDave Brown, former chief of staff for Alameda County Supervisor Alice Lai-Bitker, also in the running for the Assembly seat, said he was approached by PG&E, but turned down the contribution.\n\n“I understand that people can take a donation and say ‘no,’ ” he said, “but I don’t want the appearance there.”\n\n“PG&E represents 1 percent of the contributions,” said Ramsey, who has raised a total of $300,000 according to his latest filings. The candidate added that he is willing to vote against the utility if elected to the state legislature.\n\nDan Borenstein, political editor of the Contra Costa Times, and debate panelist, stirred up more controversy when he raised concerns about alleged financial mismanagement of a construction bond by the West Contra Costa Unified School District, and asked why voters should approve a new $300 million construction bond on the ballot in the next election.\n\n“We have not mismanaged any money,” Ramsey said, in a vigorous defense of the district, citing an audit by the Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team, a state agency, which approved the district’s handling of its bond program.\n\nThe candidate added that the district has balanced its budget nine years in a row, avoided the financial troubles plaguing local districts like Berkeley and Emeryville and has an A- bond rating from Standard & Poor’s.\n\nBoth of Ramsey’s rivals declined to comment on the fiscal health of the school district and Hancock voiced support for the new bond measure.\n\nBut Hancock and Brown said the public schools in Richmond, one of the municipalities in the West Contra Costa Unified School District, are low-performing and need more attention.\n\n“I think it’s unfair that the other two are blasting me,” Ramsey responded, noting that the Richmond schools serve many children who come from difficult circumstances. “Instead of attacking and harassing, let’s help each other.”\n\nWhen the debate shifted from Ramsey’s record, candidates took time to lay out some of their legislative priorities. Ramsey said he would push for universal health care and Section 8 housing vouchers for college students.\n\nBrown said he would focus on education and transportation. He said extending BART service in the East Bay and breaking ground on new lanes for the Caldecott Tunnel connecting Oakland and Orinda would be top priorities. Brown said he wouldn’t seek higher office if the state failed to break ground on the Caldecott Tunnel during his term as a state Assemblymember.\n\nHancock said her campaign is focused on the “three e’s,” education, the environment and the economy. Hancock said she would work to expand the state’s university system and improve public transportation to reduce pollution. She said there should be one pass that works for all modes of local public transportation.\n\nRetracing the Classic Box housing style\n\nWhile Berkeley is noted nationally, even internationally, for its turn-of the twentieth-century architects such as Bernard Maybeck, and their creative and innovative residential designs, Berkeley also has a large number of housing types that could simply be referred to as common.\n\nThe house pictured here is such a house and it was common style across the country from around 1895 through the 1920s. The style is referred to by several different names: Classic Revival, Edwardian, Neo-colonial Revival, Classic Box and in the mid-west the American foursquare.\n\nThese two-story houses are noteworthy for their rectangular shape, often a square, a hipped or pyramidal roof that often had a single dormer in the center, closed eaves and a covered entry porch. In Berkeley rows of Classic Boxes line the streets along or near early electric streetcar lines and across the country they are associated with early streetcar suburbs.\n\nInspired by the Classic styled architecture of the Chicago World's Fair of 1893, early examples of these houses had Classical detailing such as engaged Ionic or Corinthian columns at the corners or free standing columns supporting the entrance porches. Sometimes there were dentils under the eaves or a three-part Palladian styled window. There are numerous variations on the theme and some are large and "
