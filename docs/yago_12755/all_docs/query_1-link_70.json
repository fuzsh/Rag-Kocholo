Alfred, born about 1809, was the youngest son of Richard Mansfield Beach and Lucinda Root. Rebecca was born about 1808 in New York according to census records. Published genealogies and many online family trees list her maiden name as Strong. Most do not list her parents or give information about possible siblings. The online trees give other family trees as the source of Rebeccaâs maiden name.\n\nFamily papers bring up the name HENDERSON as another possibility for Rebeccaâs maiden name, but I have not found primary sources or online sources to verify it. My great aunt had a photo of a man and woman. Two notes are on the back. One says, âMr. L. Henderson and wife.â The other says, âPapaâs uncle Lafayette Henderson, Evanston, Ill.â Lafayette Hendersonâs obituary gives Delaware County, New York as his birthplace and his death record lists James Henderson and Nancy as his parents, making James and Nancy Nethaway Henderson of Walton his likely parents. However, online family trees offer confusing information. Some say James and Nancy did have a son named Lafayette, but he was born in 1808, not 1829. Others list a daughter named Rebecca born about 1814, but no one has any other information about her. Rebecca married Alfred Beach about 1829.\n\nMy best evidence for Henderson as Rebeccaâs maiden name is her youngest sonâs death certificate. It gives Henderson or Anderson (difficult to read) as his motherâs maiden name. I hope someone can help me find Rebeccaâs true maiden name and connect me to her parents. - Enid Macken - posted 03-2017\n\nBEACH - I am looking for the parents and siblings of Salmon P Beach and info on his early life.

Since I live overseas I have not had the opportunity to examine the land deed records (in particular the grantor/grantee indices) at the Delaware County Courthouse. Galen's sister, Eliza BODDY and her husband, John MOORHOUSE, also emigrated from Yorkshire, England to Delaware County in 1832. It is likely the two families traveled together. John and Eliza MOORHOUSE didn't stay long; the following year they migrated to Lockport, Niagara, NY where they remained until 1842 when they moved further westward to Noble County, IN. Why did Galen BODDY and John MOORHOUSE choose Delaware County? Probably because a friend or relative was already living there who persuaded them to come. But, who could that have been?
