        "text": "ONE‭: REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN I‭\n\nTo say that this book is not the ‬Confessions of St. Augustine‭ may sound as gratuitous as saying that none of my novels is ‬War and Peace‭‬, but the remark has point. In writing these memoirs I have been conscious of the fact that I am not writing the story of a soul‭; that would be an altogether more depressing exercise. The septuagenarian finds self-delusion difficult, and there is an account of my life that could be of interest only to God and myself. Remember Augustine's addressee. Only a saint could be so unflinchingly honest about his life, and I—another needless disclaimer—am no saint. What I have written is the truth, but of course it is not the whole truth, not even the fuller grasp I myself might have of it. Even for that, I would want to invoke St. Paul's ‬neque meipsum iudico‭‬, his admission that he remained largely a mystery to himself and was even unable to say for certain that he was in the state of grace.\n\nWhen friends of mine suggested that I write an autobiography I was at first amused. But the thought grew on me, as unfriendly suggestions will, and I imagined writing little bursts on the order of the End Notes I did for each issue of ‬Crisis‭‬: episodes, people, events, arranged more or less chronologically, but not aiming at any narrative control beyond before and after. The thought enabled me to begin. What emerged is not quite that, but it is close. I recall the past in terms of large categories that enable me to gather together events and activities and people. Of course there is some transgression of genera. The account has a beginning, a middle, and, if not an end, brings matters to where the shadows have lengthened, the sun sinks slowly in the west, and I find myself praying for mercy and the grace of a happy death.\n\nAutobiography is very likely the most various of literary genres. It includes the confessional account—edifying like St. Augustine's, the opposite in the case of Rousseau's, corrupt as practiced by Anaïs Nin and Henry Miller, incredible in the case of Frank Harris. Chesterton's seems to be about everyone but himself, as in a way is that of Kingsley Amis. Most of Amis's chapters bear the names of the persons and places he chooses to pillory and excoriate. The targets of these witty put-downs could scarcely enjoy them, but the reader is soon in the grips of morose delectation. Outright laughter, actually. But then Amis is pretty hard on himself as well.\n\nCollections of letters are more unbuttoned, even more so diaries, particularly when they were kept without any thought of eventual publication. I would mention Evelyn Waugh's letters to Nancy Mitford and Diana Cooper, but he seems to have assumed these more or less pagan ladies were preserving his letters. Why this difference‭? The autobiography, excepting Augustine's, perhaps, is a device that enables the writer to give a carefully edited version of his passage through time. But even Augustine fails to mention the name of Adeodatus's mother. Graham Greene apparently forgot the names of his children. The autobiographer's besetting temptation is summed up in Nietzsche's question, “‬Why am I so wonderful‭?” If life is a book in which one sets out to write one story and ends by writing another, an autobiography tends to be an account which, if not hagiographical, seldom puts the writer in the dock. Even recounting unflattering episodes can seem a preemptive strike.\n\nI began this task reluctantly but soon was taking culpable pleasure in the exercise. Aristotle distinguished between memory and reminiscence, and I began to see what he meant. A hitherto forgotten past—people, places, events—suddenly comes vividly to mind, emerging from who knows what recesses of the self. The greatest problem is to find a principle of exclusion. So much of what comes flooding back can scarcely interest anyone but myself. It is the thought that much of the contents of memory will be interred with one's bones that spurs one on. If nothing else, this record may be of interest to my children and grandchildren.\n\nBecause the real story of one's life is known only to God, few autobiographers put themselves in His presence as they write. The shaping of events makes one acutely aware of the mystery of even the most ordinary human life. “‬Know thyself‭” is not only the slogan for the most difficult task of all‭; it is one few of us care to undertake. The autobiographer becomes increasingly aware that he is plucking items from a vast underground river, the course of which he only dimly perceives. He comes to see that his can only be a partial account, not simply because the whole is quantitatively unmanageable, but because the sense of the whole is hidden from him.\n\nI find that the effort to write one's own life induces a deep skepticism about biographies. As 2003 turned into 2004, sunning myself on Longboat Key, I read a lot of biographies as distraction from, perhaps as a spur to, writing these memoirs. There are wonderful bookstores in Sarasota, and I would periodically bring back a bushel basket of remaindered and discounted volumes to my sybaritic condo. Over the space of a few weeks, I read the lives of Oscar Wilde, of John Gray, of Emily Dickinson, of Wilkie Collins, of Jonathan Swift and Laurence Sterne. All of them were efforts to reconstruct a person from data available in archives and private collections, from the letters and the reminiscences of others. Research projects, in short. Someone emerges from such narratives, but the reader is usually more conscious of the writer than of the subject. Sterne was in his way the Andrew Greeley of his day (‬although to state the obverse would be libelous‭)‬, but what one gets is a version of something essentially unknown. That we cannot get at the full truth of our own lives makes biography seem a branch of fiction. Attempts at a final judgment seem wildly presumptuous and finally impossible.\n\nFor all that, I love biography, particularly literary biography. And I have become perhaps too fond of writing my memoirs. Jude Dougherty and I once entered into a pact to write one another's obituaries—lest the truth come out. It turns out that there is little danger of that. It is not simply that friends have an honorable tendency to see the best in one another. In reflective moments, when one gets an intimation of what one looks like to God, it is a relief to have the moment pass. Such narratives as this are all, in a way, what Newman called the history of his religious opinions, an apologia pro vita sua. One is making a case in the hope that it is, if far from the whole truth, nonetheless true.\n\nTWO‭: BIOSPHERE‭\n\nWhere I grew up, the Mississippi River divides Minneapolis from St. Paul‭; lower down in Lake City, where my great-great-grandfather Patrick and his wife Nora are buried, the river separates Minnesota from Wisconsin‭; on a map, it cuts the whole country in two. The Mississippi takes its rise from Lake Itasca in northern Minnesota, an unpromising beginning and then broadens and winds its way to New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nPatrick and Nora left Ennis in County Clare, Ireland, in either 1844 or 1845‭, and settled for some twenty years near Perth, Ontario, before descending to Lake City, where they are located by the U.‬S. Census of 1870. My great-grandfather Austin Joseph also lived in Lake City following his marriage to Mary Connell in Louisville, but the family moved on to Minneapolis after a spell of farming near De Graff, Minnesota, one of the communities founded by Archbishop John Ireland of St. Paul in order to get the Irish out of the wicked cities and back to the land where they belong. (‬I owe this genealogical lore to my brother Steve.)\n\nMaurice Patrick, my grandfather on my father's side, was successful in both business and politics in Minneapolis. My mother said of him that he was the nicest man she ever knew. He died the year I was born. My father, another Austin—certain names recur in the family with the occasional antic departure like my own—married Vivian Rush in 1926. Nine of their children survived, and indeed all are living as I write.\n\nDuring World War II, my father built tankers in Chaska with Cargill Corporation and once traveled on a completed vessel down the river to New Orleans. When I enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1946, it was a tossup whether one was sent to San Diego or Parris Island for boot camp. My brother Ray had been sent to North Carolina. I was sent to San Diego. The Twin Cities are both east and west of the river, and the Marine Corps vacillated on considering recruits from there western or eastern. Wherever I have gone, wherever I have lived, the Mississippi has dominated the country of my mind.\n\n‬Whenever I reread ‬Huckleberry Finn‭‬, which is almost every year, it is like going home, although Huck's is the only raft I have ever been on. The evocation of the antebellum river is only part of the attraction. ‬Life on the Mississippi‭ is far more evocative of those times. Mark Twain lived most of his life away from his town of origin, and when he did return to Hannibal, Missouri, late in life, he seemed ill at ease in a present that obscured the past. When I saw that little town on the western bank of the Mississippi for the first time, on my way to a stint as visiting professor at Truman State in Missouri, I could understand why Mark Twain went back there only once with ambiguous results. Maybe it was more than merely the passage of time, but the river inhabits the innocence of childhood and can seem to mock tragic old age. Twain had lost his wife and daughter and seemed unable to stave off the despair that not even suits of ice-cream white could diminish.\n\nWhen I was a boy, the Mississippi at first seemed a tributary of Minnehaha Creek, which starts in Lake Minnetonka and runs through Minneapolis to the famous falls and on to the river. Lake of the Isles, Lake Calhoun, Lake Harriet, Lake Nokomis, Lake Hiawatha, and others are linked by the creek, making a vast park of half of Minneapolis. My grandfather had been an alderman when the great system of parks was formed and Minnehaha Creek conceded eminent domain. Just below our street, the creek flowed through what seemed like a vast meadow, though we lived in the heart of the city. There were tennis courts, and in the evenings my father practiced iron shots along the creek. My brother Maurice fell off the footbridge when he was only a toddler and floated hundreds of yards as blissful as Ophelia, before he was fished out. “‬There is a willow grows aslant a brook . . . .” I already had an image for those words when I first read them, as if Hamlet's beloved had drifted down Minnehaha Creek. A replica of Longfellow's house, a branch of the public library, overlooked a skating rink just above the falls.\n\nIt has been said that you cannot step twice into the same river‭; that goes for creeks as well. But that is only literally true. Like the snows of yesteryear, such waterways are gone forever yet ever present. “‬A boy's will is the wind's will, and the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts.” Those of age are even longer.\n\nI came into the world in February 1929, a half year before the Great Depression. I do not suggest a causal connection. I was born at home, on 36th Avenue in South Minneapolis, delivered by my uncle Maurice. I was the third child in what would eventually be a family of nine children. (‬A sister, also delivered at home by my Uncle Maurice, died almost immediately, but I am sure my parents always thought they had ten children.) So in my own family after we lost our firstborn, Michael, my six surviving children were taught to think in the words of Wordsworth's poem, we are seven.\n\nMy grandfather Maurice Patrick, a pillar of the parish of St. Helena, alderman of the ward, and successful businessman—M. P. McInerny Heating and Plumbing was located at 513 Fourth Avenue South in downtown Minneapolis—died in 1929, and that fact coupled with the Depression, plunged us into something very close to poverty. But that was a common fate. Whether this is due to poor memory or a lack of imagination, the realization surprises me. I look back on my childhood as a veritable idyll of happiness.\n\nI went off to kindergarten, at John Ericson School, from 2810 E. Minnehaha Parkway, a house my grandfather had built. After his death, my father and my uncle Clate tried to run his business, but by stages they lost everything, and my most vivid memories are of 4034 27th Avenue, where we lived from my first into my eighth year in the parish school.\n\nAs I have said, winding through my early years is Minnehaha Creek. Even when we lived on 27th Avenue, we were but a block's walk from it where it feeds first into and then out of Lake Hiawatha. (‬In my father's childhood it was called Rice Lake.) It feeds my memories now of the years before I went off to Nazareth Hall in 1942, at the age of thirteen—and of many later memories as well. After my discharge from the Marine Corps, I spent the summer of 1947 lolling on the main beach of Lake Nokomis, courtesy of the veterans‭' program called 52/20, so called because if one succeeded in remaining unemployed, the government supplied twenty dollars a week for a year. It was not a negligible sum in those days, at least for one content to sport with Amaryllis in the sun.\n\nMy original sin had the creek for its setting. As I walked home from school along the muddy banks in spring, one of my rubbers became stuck, and I stepped out of it and continued home. One the way, I discarded the other rubber. Where were my rubbers‭? I said they had been stolen. But the great sin was to accuse a kid named Tony of having taken them. As it happened, Tony's family were not held in high repute, and my story was believed, if not by mother, by my visiting Aunt Charlotte—one or the other of my mother‭'‬s sisters spent greater or lesser lengths of time in our home—and my lie stirred her moral indignation. Over my mother's protests, she marched me off to Tony's home. During the walk I must have found her mood contagious, learning for the first time how an interested lie can have all the allure of the truth. Charlotte pounded on the door and a wary, harried woman answered. From behind Tony's mother came the not yet hushed sounds of her many children. My aunt declared our purpose. Tony was summoned by his mother and just stared at me when the accusation was made. Of course he denied it, but not even his mother believed him. She gave him a whack and he disappeared. My aunt demanded the rubbers. Somehow the incident ended, my aunt apparently satisfied that Tony's mother acknowledged her son was a thief, and I confessed to her that night when she put me to bed. The memory of that lie and false accusation has never gone away. It is firmly embedded in the bottom stratum of myself, representing the day when I achieved what moralists call the Age of Reason and walked for the first time out of the garden of innocence.\n\nWe swam in the lakes and skated on them in winter, played hockey and baseball, and in season our team, The Bluebirds, entered in the schedule arranged by the park board at the pavilion at Lake Hiawatha. We fished, we retrieved golf balls hit over the fence of Hiawatha golf course, and we sold them back to the players. I hawked newspapers on a corner before school began, three cents a copy, earning a pittance, but later went on to a paper route, which was far more lucrative. That entailed collecting money from the customers on my route once a week. In those days, Minneapolis newspapers had metal shacks scattered through the city, at which the papers were doled out to the paperboys. We did not leave the shack until we had folded each paper and stuffed them in the cloth bags we carried as we flung them at our customers‭' doors. The small amounts my brothers and I earned played an important role in the domestic economy. The new clothes bought at the beginning of a school year were paid for with our earnings.\n\nBut what I most remember is the indolence of those days, particularly in summer. There were the sports I mentioned, and there were long hikes. And books. The Roosevelt branch of the Minneapolis Public Library was visible from our screened front porch on 27th Avenue, which was a favorite shaded place. During the summer the library organized reading programs, and one earned stars of different colors for the amount one read, which could be proudly presented to the nun when school resumed. Every three years or so, residential streets were ploughed and then resurfaced and oiled, filling the air with fragrance. Ice and milk and other food stuffs were brought to the door, sometimes drawn by horses, who left mementoes in the street. I particularly remember the horsedrawn Bamby Wagon, bringing bread and pastry, and the Jewel Tea man.\n\nI have learned that my own children become skeptical when I describe the jobs of my own childhood—selling newspapers, delivering them, caddying at the Minnikada Club overlooking Lake Calhoun. What I could not convey, apparently, was how wonderful it was. The early morning hawking of newspapers is eclipsed by the memory of sitting on the screen porch reading the books I brought home from the library. Many years later, I took my father on a little tour of the stations of our life, and we stopped at the Roosevelt library. Some of my own things were on the computer, and my father's delight at this became my own. Any tendency on my part to doubt the idyllic memories of my grade school years is swept away whenever I revisit Minneapolis and drive along Minnehaha Parkway, which runs beside the creek from Lake Harriet to my old neighborhood. Thousands and thousands of middle-class homes look out on vistas that would be rare and costly elsewhere.\n\nAfter half a year of kindergarten at John Erickson School, begun before my fifth birthday, I entered the parish school of St. Helena's Church, where I would spend the next eight years. We were taught by Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet. The parish had not yet built a convent, and the sisters lived in the school, in space across from the classrooms on the second floor. They had a little chapel and once a week, on Monday, Father Rowan, the pastor, would say his 6:45 a.m. Mass there‭; boys assigned as his servers for the week began the Mass in that little chapel. It has become fashionable to grouse about the nuns in parish schools, and there has been much nonsense and libel spread abroad. In the course of my eight years I had seven different nuns, and with one possible exception—we called her Sister Sour Grapefruit—they were a cheerful community which, given their living conditions, is amazing, and they were good teachers. Like us, they dreamt of summer, for then they could return to St. Catherine's College in St. Paul and a comparatively posh existence.\n\nStudents in the parish school assumed that they were miles ahead of the poor devils attending John Ericson across the street, a school we somehow thought of as the Protestant school. Sister Ellen Joseph taught me in both the seventh and eighth grades, moving up to teach the eighth when she became principal. Along the way to that final year I developed a taste for history and literature, thanks to Sister Rose Alma. Boxes of books were delivered to the school each week, often with copies of one of the Father Francis Finn stories—‬Tom Playfair, Percy Wynn‭—and we eagerly read them. We learned how to sing, we learned how to diagram sentences, we learned our catechism.\n\nThe only story I could tell on the nuns took place when I was in first grade and had not yet mastered the mystery of ‬R‭‬. My teacher, Sister Mary Electa, would take me up the hall to other nuns and I would be put through a little ritual. What is your name‭? Walph. What are your brothers‭' names‭? Woger and Waymond. There was nothing cruel in this‭; they obviously found my lisping cute, and I would be hugged and taken back to my desk. A few years later I startled my mother by asking if the nuns were defeminized—I think I used this word. The question was prompted by the absence of bosom in the nun I had in second grade. I could rattle off the names of the nuns I had, but I won't. They are all now consigned to the Tomb of the Unknown Nun. But I remember them all. More importantly, God does.\n\nMy uncle Maurice had one of the first home movie cameras, and my dad got one of his own as soon as he could afford it. It is because of this that I can watch myself and my brothers frisking for the camera at 2810 E. Minnehaha Parkway and later at 4034 27th Avenue. There is no theme to this footage, and the camera jolts and jumps from one scene to another with no continuity. This is part of its charm, since the very amateurishness contributes to the notion that one is eavesdropping on the past. Still photographs are wonderful, but movies have an eerie capacity to evoke the past. Old men are children once again, my father is theatrically handsome, my mother radiant and fruitful. Rog and Ray stage a boxing match, Babe (‬Austin junior‭) walks in and out of the picture, Denny bounces around, and I sit smiling amidst them, more of an observer than a participant. Mary Margaret was the baby then, Theresa and Maurice and Stephen not having yet arrived. My brother Ray has amalgamated all those old films and put them on videos. Nostalgia is only a moment away. I sit and control the past—stop, rewind, play again—my finger on the appropriately named remote control. Eventually the subject of these movies is family weddings, my own among them, so that I can watch Connie and me emerge from St. Thomas Church on January 3, 1953, again and again, and see her throw her flowers, which were caught by Eloise soon to be McDonald, the wife of my best man. My father-in-law could not wait to get out of his formal dress, and he appears in the pictures taken afterwards at the Kunert home in a woolen shirt. Raised a Lutheran, he had not been inside any church for years before he walked Connie down the aisle, so maybe that unusual experience also sped him home before the rest of us.\n\nI was in first grade when I became one of the six so-called choirboys who, wearing cassock and surplice, sat on benches in the sanctuary during the Sunday High Mass. Just sat there. We did nothing else, certainly not sing. The next step was becoming an altar boy, and that meant memorizing the Latin responses. The prayers at the foot of the altar were the real test, the priest and altar boy rapidly exchanging verses of Psalm 42—‬Introibo ad altare Dei, ad Deum qui laetificat iuventutem meam‭—and then there was the bowed recitation of the Confiteor. Once the priest mounted to the altar it was comparatively easy. One had to be on the alert to move the book from the epistle to the gospel side, as we called them—the priest would signal by laying his hand on the linen surface. The altar missal was huge, and one carried it on its stand, descending to the foot of the altar, genuflecting, then mounting to place it on the opposite side. One then stood until the priest began to read, then bowed and returned to the foot of the altar. From time to time, a boy would step on his cassock as he was carrying the book and tumble on the stairs.\n\nThe daily Masses were at 6:45, 7:30 and 8:00 a.m., the first said by Father Rowan, the others by his assistants. In 1940, freshly ordained, Paul J. Gorman was assigned to St. Helena's. One of his tasks was to take charge of the altar boys, and we formed the St. John Berchmans Society. I was made president, to my genuine surprise. Gorman had what in those days was thought of as a late vocation, being twenty-eight when he was ordained. He came from Maple Lake, Minnesota, and was a gifted musician who had been the organist during his seminary days. When the new St. Helena's Church was built with a magnificent organ, Father Gorman would sometimes go up in the loft and play his heart out to an empty church. The sound would reach us across the intervening playground. Dr. Vibes. He was a strange fellow, and I became one of his favorites. He did not own a car, so when he took some of us to the Nankin Restaurant downtown for a massive meal of Chinese food costing a total of $1.25 each, we went by street car or, ‬mirabile dictu‬, by cab. It was under the influence of Father Gorman and Sister Ellen Joseph that I began to think of the priesthood. Father Gorman gave me a Short Breviary, a beautiful volume published by the Benedictines at St. John's in Collegeville, Minnesota, an order Gorman had once thought of joining. I still have the book. In eighth grade, on Sundays in spring, I would carry it as I crossed the Ford Bridge and walked up the river road on the St. Paul side to Summit Avenue to attend vespers in the seminary chapel. The sight of the seminarians processing across the grounds in their cassocks and surplices, birettas set at various angles on their heads, in their hands a ‬Liber Usualis‭‬, stirred me. It was like a recruiting poster in living tableau. And so it was decided that I might enter Nazareth Hall, the minor seminary of the archdiocese of St. Paul, after I graduated from eighth grade.\n\nTHREE‭: SPOILED PRIEST‭\n\nNazareth Hall stood on the shore of Lake Johanna, north of St. Paul, out Snelling Avenue from the fairgrounds. That was where the streetcar line stopped in the fall of 1947 when I set off for my old school on foot, thereby impressing the rector Father Shanahan and doubtless making him more amenable to my request that I be readmitted to Nazareth Hall. I had already spent the best years of my youth here.\n\n‬The seminary system of the archdiocese of St. Paul in those days comprised twelve years, six of them to be spent at the preparatory seminary, Nazareth Hall, and the rest at the major seminary on Summit Avenue and the River Road in St. Paul. As I noted earlier, in the spring of my eighth grade I sometimes walked from home to the chapel of the seminary on Sundays to watch the seminarians process into chapel for vespers, clad in their cassocks and surplices and birettas. Sister Ellen Joseph made sure that the boys in her class knew of the possibility of a vocation. Looking through the bulletins from various seminaries, I was struck by their ‬horaria‭‬. Each day was ordered by the hour, from rising to going to bed. Four boys from my eighth-grade class went off to Nazareth Hall: Eugene Schmidt, John Johnson, Art Hesburg, and myself. In the event, none of us was ordained (‬although our classmate Marvin Deutsch became a Maryknoll missionary‭)‬, but then, the point of the prolonged system was to give one an opportunity to make a careful decision. I had left Nazareth Hall after three years and joined the Marine Corps (‬of which more later‭)‬, and now I wanted to return. I had lolled on the main beach at Lake Nakomis, I had put in a quarter term at the University of Minnesota, but I was dissatisfied.\n\nWhen I entered Nazareth Hall in 1942 I was thirteen years old, a First-Year boy. Each year received its ordinal designation, suggesting a continuum that ran through high school into the first two years of college. My heroes were upperclassmen, especially those college men who held positions of prominence—head prefect, head waiter, editor of the ‬Puer Nazarenus‭‬, even the student barber, Don Schnitizius—and I became a kind of pet during my first year. For one thing I was small, naïve, and sassy. One of my assignments, fulfilled on Sunday morning between the low Mass and the high Mass, was to take a pitcher of holy water along the college corridor and fill the little fonts inside each door. After knocking, I would open the door and call out, ‬Ecce aqua benedicta‭‬. To which the reply was ‬Sit nobis salus et vita‭‬. As the year went on, I intoned my message to the opening notes of “‬My Darling Clementine‭” until, when the novelty wore off, a disapproving frown or two told me that laughter could be had at too high a price.\n\nOne of the agonizing aspects of my first year at Nazareth Hall was the fact that I did not have a suit. It was specified in the list of clothing to bring along, but my mother apparently thought it was optional—a thirteen-year-old wearing a suit‭? I had two sweaters, one red and one green, which I alternated. It was only on Sunday that the lack of a suit mattered, since that is the day one dressed up, but I was dressed as I always was. However keenly I felt this—and in my own mind the humiliation was magnified—I never said a word to my mother. How proud she had been when they brought me to school and she came up to the First-Year dorm to get me settled.\n\n‬Because of our small size, Johnnie Johnson and I were chosen by Father Casey to serve benediction in the sisters‭' chapel in the afternoon. The service could not have occurred every day, but I forget which days it was. In any case, we would set off from Father Casey's freshman English class and march through the refectory into the kitchen, where double doors admitted us to the convent wing. The place was spick and span, but the sacristy and sanctuary were Lilliputian in size, which was why the altar boys had to be small. When we arrived the nuns would already be at prayer in their heavy German accents. This was war time, and one of them, Sister Theotima, had a brother in the German navy, but Catholicism is catholic. How plaintive were their voices lifting in the Eucharistic hymns, their faces veiled. The little chapel was soon full of incense, and when Father Casey took the monstrance and turned to bless the nuns, I rang a bell vigorously.\n\nFather Casey, a gifted, ascetic man—he was called a Detacher, after a movement started by a Pittsburgh priest, Father Hugo, who had a great influence on Dorothy Day—was also prefect of the First-Year dorm‭; each year one moved on to another dorm, until in Fifth Year one got a private room. The curriculum was classical—Latin from the very beginning, Greek starting in Third Year, English, history, math, science of a sort, and French or German. There were sports, of course, but I now accepted the fact that that I would never shine in them. Besides, those on whom I began more or less consciously to model myself, even if they played basketball or hockey, were not known for that. They were writers. They published poems and stories in the ‬Puer Nazarenus‭‬. I wonder if the issues of that magazine could still be found in some archives. Then I might learn how the poems of Leo Noterman would strike me now. At the time, they seemed the very standard of achievement. Leo was in the Fifth Year, and almost every month something by him appeared in the ‬Puer‭‬. If I had had any notion of what a poet should look like, this good-looking but ordinary young man would have been puzzling.\n\nThis is when I first began to regard myself as a writer—in remote potency, as I would learn to say later. At the back of the study hall was a table and a few shelves containing reference books to save a trip to the library. Among them was Kunitz and Haycraft, ‬Twentieth-Century Authors‭‬. It fascinated me. There were photographs the size of postage stamps of the authors with a double-column account of their lives, ending with a list of their books. I began to subtract the birthday of an author from the year of his first book. It was clear that most of them had begun publishing in their twenties, sometimes their early twenties. That gave me time.\n\nWe had nicknames for the faculty—Butch, Kush, Suki, Zip, Uncle Bill, Harpo, the Greek. They were all priests of the archdiocese who had been assigned to teach, a task most would do for perhaps fifteen years and then be rewarded with a parish. Almost none of them had advanced degrees, and in those days Nazareth Hall was not accredited, but they had been chosen because of their academic performance as seminarians. Some had the learning of autodidacts, a few were pursuing higher degrees, but by and large they spent the capital they had acquired as students and to which they had added since. This surprises me when I think of it now. Among them were some of the best teachers I ever had. Classics were at the heart of the curriculum. In Latin, after a year of grammar, we read Caesar, went on to Cicero, and then to Virgil and Horace. I was tutored in Catullus by Father Walter Peters, a vain and eccentric man shaped like the letter S, a German among so many Irish. He also taught me Horace and inspired me to read Thomas Mann. In Greek there was a year of grammar taught by Father Leo White (‬the Greek‭)‬, who was also prefect of the study hall and spent afternoon and evening hours there, seated at a desk set on a high platform, the better to survey his charges, a floor lamp beside his chair. He always seemed to be reading his breviary, either seated in the chair or pacing the outer aisles of the huge room, which held the entire high school. White was also director of the library, and I volunteered to work there, learning how to bind books and letter their spines according to the Dewey decimal system. The great attraction of the job was books bequeathed by deceased priests‭; these arrived in huge boxes at regular intervals. Selections from these cornucopias added to my growing personal library. These were sanctioned acquisitions, by and large. But once I appropriated a beautiful ‬Imitatio Christi‭ bound in green leather with gilt edged pages and a ribbon marker. I spirited it away without asking if I could. My conscience, aided by the irony of stealing a book on how to imitate Christ, led me to return it to the box from which I had taken it. I was so remorseful that I did not ask if I could take it legitimately. Every such donation would include a set of breviaries, often two sets since a new Latin translation had been authorized by Pius XII, necessitating the purchase of four new volumes—one for each season—of the Roman Breviary. One of the principal tasks of a priest is to say his office, that is read the hours of the day with their psalms and hymns and prayers with selections from the Fathers. In those days, this took more or less an hour. It seemed to take Father White several hours, but then, he was regularly interrupted by requests to go to the lavatory or to the library. During evening study hall, from 7:30 to 9 p.m., he was more sympathetic to the second request than the first.\n\n‭The library was a long low room with a beamed ceiling that seemed aimed at the fireplace at the far end. In the center were huge library tables with lamps on them, and along the sides of the room were alcoves, each containing a little desk and chair and a window. Commandeering an alcove was the first order of business, then settling in. My reading during those years was affected by the books on the shelves of the alcove I happened to get. Stevenson's ‬Virginibus Puerisque‭ caught my eye, and I was a bit disappointed to find that the title meant simply For Boys and Girls. So that would have been in Second Year, when puberty had struck and heated thoughts occurred. After I read Proust, in English translation, I suggested to Father White that the volumes of Proust were inappropriate for our shelves, and he removed them. Well, keepers of the ‬Index Librorum Prohibitorum‭ must first have read the books they forbade others to read.\n\nBut back to Greek. We went on from grammar to Xenophon and then to Homer's ‬Iliad‭‬, after which we read St. Basil. Latin and Greek were deemed necessary for future priests, but there was no overt relating of our accumulating knowledge to our presumed future as priests. Doubtless it was assumed that the Latin liturgry was becoming intelligible to us as a result of our classical studies. Tubby Blatz, a disarmingly learned giant of a man, taught Plato to a small group of volunteers meeting in his room, where a Blatz Beer sign adorned one of the walls. He may have been the most naturally talented priest to teach at Nazareth Hall during my time there, but I never had the sense that he enjoyed his assignment. I still have Latin and Greek texts from that time. Scotch taped to my Xenophon is an advertisement of a colorful bottle of Blatz beer. My Horace and Virgil from those days are on my shelves still, along with my Bennet's grammar and Cassell's Latin dictionary. My Xenophon also contains a marginal record of the “‬calls.” When a student's name was called, he stood, read ten or fifteen lines, and then translated them, after which he was asked to parse a few words. Then on to the next call. The hope was that by keeping a record of the calls, it would be possible to predict when one's next turn would come. I don't think this ever proved true. I wrote a much appreciated doggerel poem which included the recurring line, “‬And Senta sits in front,‭” which old friends from those days still remember. Senta was Bob Senta, who was eventually ordained for the Duluth diocese. A prudent man, he kept away from the back seats where rowdies gathered.\n\nIt is in the nature of such schools, perhaps all schools, that much of one's learning takes place independently of classes and teachers. For me, the ‬Puer Nazarenus‭ loomed large. We put on plays, of course, and once a year the faculty was seated in the front rows of the auditorium and subjected to ridicule. There were always mimics of uncanny ability who would bring down the house with imitations of one priest after another. Victims of such imitation never seemed to recognize what for everyone else were their distinctive traits. But it was the informal influence of such precocious and gifted students as Jerome Quinn and George Welzbacher, both a few years ahead of me, whose conversations opened up new possibilities, authors, projects. And Bob Klein and Marvin O'Connell and I began a novel‭; each of us would write a chapter and pass it on to one of the other for him to do the same, and so on. We hadn't written many chapters when we stopped. The plot was getting decidedly raunchy. Klein had been much taken by the cover photo of Truman Capote on ‬Other Voices, Other Rooms‭—by the insolent language, not the decadent.\n\nIn short, we were taught, but we also educated one another and ourselves. I was never caught up in the athletic side of the school, as most others were, and as far as I know neither Welzbacher nor Quinn ever raised a sweat from games or exercise. The late afternoon and evening walks out to the entry on Snelling Avenue and back consumed half an hour at least, and with four or five students together, conversation never lagged. When Thomas Merton's ‬Seven Storey Mountain‭ appeared in 1948, I was a college man. Its account of Merton's efforts to write novels struck me even more than the story of his conversion. After all, I had made a retreat at New Mount Melleray in Iowa with Father Gorman, so I probably thought I already knew something of Trappist monasteries. But Merton's account of the intellectual excitement of Columbia University was inspiring. (‬In the Marine Corps I had also read, in a paperback service edition, Mark Van Doren's ‬Liberal Education‭‬. He was a great influence on Merton.) Most fascinating of all for me was Merton's withdrawal to the woods of upper New York, to a summer cottage with a few friends, each of whom was writing a novel.\n\nWe students were assigned various duties, such as serving Mass in the crypt where the faculty said their swift but licit private Masses at altars along both walls. (‬One could also go to confession any morning in the crypt, although confessors from outside were brought in on a weekly basis. Presumably a morning trip to the crypt spelled an emergency.) There were also outside work details, but the recurrent task was to wait tables in the refectory.\n\nIn those days everybody smoked, of course, but the rule of the school was that only the upper three years were permitted to do so. For under-classmen to be discovered smoking was in principle a cause for dismissal. A lean-to behind the study hall where tools and things were kept came to be called the Smoke Shack, for here the elect repaired at mid-morning for their between-classes cigarette and during the afternoon recreation period from three to four-thirty. The signs of rank and prestige are usually trivial—a medal, something on the sleeve, a different colored cassock, a handshake—but that withdrawal for a licit cigarette separated the sheep from the goats. Of course the practice in the lower years was to anticipate the privilege, and on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons we younger boys would go off on the county roads to a place called Carrier's where cigarettes and candy could be bought. Ah, to stroll those county roads, smoking, talking, smoking some more. In the spring, when the snow had melted and the fields yielded their fragrance, it was especially wonderful. I can smell the humus still. With time the smoking habit became more demanding, and I would sneak off into the woods near school for a quick smoke. This scofflaw practice had much to do, I have come to believe, with my eventual leaving. (‬Recently an old classmate, Jim Dech—called of course Poop—sent me a long poem I had written when the smoke shack was pulled down by a new rector in our sixth year. ‬De Lamentatione Rudophi‭‬, which runs five single-spaced pages, is metrically unsure but evocative. I had completely forgotten writing it. Are there other juvenilia destined to come back and haunt me‭?)\n\nThese were the war years, and some of the students would have been in the service if they were not studying for the priesthood. Soon it became obvious that the usual summer vacation, three whole months and more, was inappropriate at the time. And so began what was called Acceleration‭; my Fourth Year began in the spring of 1945 and would have been completed before the next calendar year if I had stayed. Prefects for the dorms were chosen from Fourth-Year men, and Father Ralph Broker, a painfully ascetic man and another Detacher—his untailored cassock was said to be of the kind altar boys wore—chose me and Bob Lester as prefects of the Second-Year dorm. Shortly after this became known, Mike McDonough, who had preceded me in the job, confronted me on the steps of the Loggia that ran along the front of the school.\n\n‭“‬Did Father Broker ask you to be one of his prefects‭?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You're not going to accept, are you‭?”\n\nNot accept‭? Being a prefect was one of the plums one had looked forward to.\n\n‭“‬Why wouldn't I‭?”\n\n“Because you're a disgrace to the school. Your whole class is a disgrace.”\n\nHe went on to catalog our collective faults, and it was the flaunting of the smoking rule that was at the heart of it. Break one rule and it becomes easier to break others. That was his point. How could I honestly exercise a post of authority in the school when I was a notorious breaker of the rule‭?\n\nI think this was the first time that I saw myself through another's hostile eyes. Yet I agreed with McDonough. I felt awful. But deep inside, I did not really think of myself as other than a model student. I accepted the job despite this chastening experience, but my days at Nazareth Hall were numbered. When summer came, I would leave.\n\nI returned to Nazareth Hall in 1947 after a stint in the Marine Corps, as I have indicated, and was also a college man there, graduating in 1949. Unsurprisingly, however, my most vivid memories are of my first stay there from 1942 to 1945—three years that began in pre-puberty and ended with the thought that celibacy was not for me.\n\nThe chapel at Nazareth Hall was dedicated to the Annunciation and was a marble marvel, with stained glass windows and embedded stations of the Cross, and it seems now as if no time intervened as I moved with my class, year by year from the front pews to the back ones where the Sixth-Year men, the temporal lords of the school, knelt. We gathered there each day at noon to recite the Angelus, then filed out in silence to the refectory. After the meal, it was back to chapel again for a brief thanksgiving. And, of course our day began there. We rose at six and Mass was at 6:30. By eight o'clock, when the classes began, our day was well underway.\n\nIn Sixth Year I was elected editor of the ‬Puer Nazarenus‭‬. If there was any job in that final year I coveted, it was this. The faculty advisor that year was a young priest, Father James Shannon, a man of great charm and talent and energy. Already he was overextended—teaching at Nazarth Hall (‬Greek and English literature‭)‬, pursuing graduate studies at the University of Minnesota, helping out at the cathedral and other things as well. He came and went in a blur. The first time we talked about the magazine, I sensed his disapproval of its appearance. Ever since I had known it, the ‬Puer‭‬ had been mimeographed, the front cover also drawn on a stencil, the pages then stapled together. I myself had worked with John Murphy in a little room across from the rector's suite, wrapping the stencils around the great drum, then turning the handle with increasing speed as the sheets pulled up. They were wet, of course, and one had to be careful not to smear them. This was labor-intensive but satisfying‭; one was getting out the ‬Puer‭ and had a chance to read ‬Quid Nunc‭‬, the anonymous humor column, before others saw it. Fred Merz had written it for several years to great effect. I myself had been ‬Quid Nunc‭ for a year. Shannon's reaction to the magazine enabled me to see it for the modest thing it was. But he had a solution. He would look into offset printing, and would himself cover any extra costs. Thus I edited a far more professional-looking magazine than I had inherited, thanks to Father Shannon.\n\nI have home movies of my graduation from Nazareth Hall. Both my grandmothers were there, my Uncle Maurice and Aunt Helen, Aunt Ruth, old friends like Rosie Holl, and my proud parents. And there am I in the black suit and tie I would wear as street clothes when I moved on to the St. Paul Seminary in the fall.\n\nI have used the past tense in speaking of these days, not only because they are past, but because Nazareth Hall is no more. In the madness that succeeded Vatican II, people who had not attended such schools decided that it was wrong to separate boys from their parents at such an early age. These specious arguments prevailed, and Nazareth Hall was sold to Billy Graham for a risible sum. When I go back there now I feel like a recusant wandering through the confiscated churches of England. The baldachino has been removed from the sanctuary, as well as the beautiful altar it covered. On the baldachino had been inscribed the words from Luke 1:34, in Latin, ‬Spiritus Sanctus superveniet in te, et virtus Altissimi obrumbabit tibi‭‬, and I remember how delighted I was when I found that I could understand them. ‬The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High will overshadow thee. The stations are still embedded in the walls, the windows with their Latin too, and oddly the holy water fonts still flank the entry doors. New buildings have been added in the style of the original, which is still called Nazareth Hall, the whole now a part.\n\nSeveral times I posed on the front steps of the main entrance with my class for photographs. In my first year, Father Connolly, the then rector and the future bishop of Fall River, Massachusetts, chatted there with me and another new boy, Rob Liberati. It was Connolly who, substituting for an absent teacher, wrote “‬Ratiocination‭” on the blackboard when it was clear we had not understood. This was not condescension, far from it‭; we were always addressed as potential peers. On late Saturday afternoons the whole school gathered in the study hall to be addressed by the rector, usually on the history of the archdiocese.\n\nIt is a cruel thing to find the setting of so many memories so changed. But it could be in worse hands. Indeed, I marvel at the evangelical accommodation to that papist setting. The statue of the Boy of Nazareth, ‬Puer Nazarenus‭‬, that stood in the main corridor is gone, but the outdoor statues remain, clinging to their niches—St. Jerome, St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas. Like the iconoclasts of old, those who sold Nazareth Hall have much to answer for. But no later perfidy, on their part or mine, can remove that past from its proper setting, memory.\n\nFrom time to time I hear from men who were boys with me at Nazareth Hall. All too often, when they tell me what their lives have been, it is a sad story. Some were ordained but left the priesthood‭; for others was divorce, estranged children, this or that, and a wistful note comes into their voices when common memories are invoked. Sometimes I think that for those of us who did not go on to the priesthood, Nazareth Hall functions as a kind of Garden of Eden, the measure with reference to which all else must be defective. I have never known anyone from my time there who spoke of the place otherwise than in a laudatory way. Those years formed us and furnished our imagination as well as our memory.\n\nThe St. Paul Seminary occupied a large tract of land running along the River Road and bordered on one side by the great boulevard Summit Avenue, which runs from the Mississippi into the heart of St. Paul, that is, the cathedral built by Archbishop John Ireland, the great formative spirit of the archdiocese. He also founded St. Thomas College—now in these times of inflationary nomenclature a university—and the major seminary, separated only by Summit. Unlike Nazareth Hall, where everything was contained in one large building, the seminary was a plurality of buildings. What were called Jim Hill's boxcars, the red brick residence halls, did indeed look as if they were mounted on tracks: Grace, Cretin, and Loras. There were also a refectory building cum convent and a classroom building, the second floor of which was the ‬aula maxima‭‬, where multiclass lectures were given and, on occasion, memorable plays—not least, ‬Murder in the Cathedral‭‬, in which I was the chorus and Marvin O'Connell played Beckett.\n\nEverything at the major seminary was overtly aimed at our future as priests. First of all, we dressed the role. Our daily garb was a cassock, Roman collar, and biretta. In chapel, wearing surplices over our cassocks, we were ranged in facing choir stalls that filled the whole nave of the place. When we left the grounds—save for an afternoon to St. Thomas across the way, to use the library or gym—we wore black suit and tie and a black hat, covered in winter by a black overcoat. Second, the studies were clearly ecclesiastical: first philosophy, then theology.\n\nThe beginning two classes were known as First and Second Philosophers‭; then there were First, Second, Third, and Fourth Theologians. The target was Holy Orders, the priesthood. First Theologians received the tonsure, making them officially clerics, and then, spread over the next two years of theology, the minor orders were conferred until, at the end of Third Theology, a man was ordained subdeacon. This was the great step. Tonsure might distinguish you from the laity, but the subdiaconate brought with it two things: the promise of celibacy, the better to serve one's bishop and the people, and the obligation to say the office every day. At the beginning of the final year, subdeacons were ordained deacons and then could preach in chapel—we younger seminarians practiced preaching in the refectory, the noise and indifference of the audience enabling us to overcome bashfulness and unease. Such practice sermons seemed addressed to God and the faculty member who taught homiletics, none other than the shy and mumbling Thomas Shanahan, who had moved on from being rector of Nazareth Hall to the post of librarian at the major seminary, where there was a wonderful new library for him to preside over. Deacons could also distribute Holy Communion. Nowadays, when Eucharistic ministers pluck hosts from a ciborium with all the glee of Jack Horner, it is difficult to remember that once to touch the host or indeed the sacred vessels, the chalice and ciborium, was restricted to those with consecrated hands who had promised their lives to God.\n\nThe years of philosophy were in effect the junior and senior years of college. At Nazareth Hall I had read a book by Jacques Maritain on aesthetics but, apart from that and my reading the Prima Pars of the ‬Summa Theologiae‭ in my last semester of Latin, I was wholly innocent of philosophy and theology. Now, by contrast with my studies in the major seminary, Nazareth Hall seemed a lovely island of humanities, dominated by what were once called the liberal arts. Here everything was clearly calibrated on a fine line leading to ordination. At Nazareth Hall, the fact that we were studying for the priesthood was something remote, like being told we would some day be old. It did not play any daily role in our lives. Of course we attended Mass each day, of course we learned Gregorian chant, and Tenebrae was a high moment of the liturgy in the chapel of the Annunciation. The best singers were chosen to sing solo the lamentations: ‬De lamentatione Jeremiae prophetae. Aleph, Beth‭‬, and so on, ending with ‬Jerusalem, Jerusalem, convertere ad dominum Deum tuum‭‬. I can still hear those neums dropped into the listening air, the candles extinguished one by one, until the silence was swallowed up in darkness. It was an unforgettable aesthetic, if not religious, moment. But such participation was that of a choir, not the clergy. When Sixth-Year men donned their new black suits at graduation, the garb marked an end and a beginning far more dramatically than the ceremony of graduation. The long years at Nazareth Hall comprised a kind of education that bears only a contingent or, perhaps more accurately, a remote relation to a priestly vocation.\n\nNot so that of the major seminary. It was here that, at a fateful moment, I was introduced to philosophy, taking two courses from a bright and enthusiastic young priest, William Baumgaertner, who had just received his Ph.D. from Laval University. He taught logic and metaphysics by having us read Aristotle's Organon and the Metaphysics‭ with frequent reference to Thomas Aquinas's commentaries. The slogan of Laval could have been, “‬To the text itself,‭” the text being that of Thomas and of Aristotle. History of Philosophy was taught from a textbook, as was Natural Theology (‬Butch Baskfield‭) and Philosophical Psychology (‬Larry Wolfe‭)‬, but from the beginning I was taught that it is the primary sources to which one must go. The Latin of Thomas Aquinas was not completely unknown to me, but now it pushed aside the classics. I could not get enough of Aquinas. Father Baumgaertner tutored me in Thomas's commentary on Aristotle's ‬Nicomachean Ethics‭‬. After First Philosophy, in the summer of 1950, I took the train to Quebec and enrolled in the summer school at Laval. En route, the Korean War broke out, and scanning a Montreal paper I had no idea what or where Corée was.\n\nI will tell of my career as a philosopher later. It was at the seminary that something like a moral schizophrenia set in. During my few years away from seminary life I had dated girls, gone to dances, got a kiss or two. As a seminarian I think I can say I was considered a success as a student. Rudy Bandas, the rector, appointed me chronicler of the seminary and I had to keep a record of passing events of note—not an onerous task but considered an honor. The egg-bald Curly Ryan, our spiritual director, gave us weekly conferences about our vocation. It was impossible not to confront well in advance the great decision one would eventually make. Needless to say, celibacy loomed large. Dating a girl was cause for immediate expulsion. As I had violated the smoking rule a Nazareth Hall, so, at the major seminary I courted disaster with girls. On vacation, Bob McDonald and I would go out on the town as we always had, and we usually ended up with two compliant blondes. Bob, a great wit, would mutter from the back seat from time to time, “‬Ralph, you shouldn't be here.” It was Bob who, when I asked him if he had ever thought of the end of the world, replied, “‬Which end‭?” I suppose in a mild way I scandalized him, but we had lots of fun. It was when I was in Second Philosophy that it became clear to me that I was not meant for the priesthood. The prospect of a single life was too much for me.\n\nA classmate of mine had a married sister who lived in veterans‭' housing on the campus of St. Thomas, just across Summit. As at Nazareth Hall, we had Wednesday and Saturday afternoons free. When my classmate and I dropped by for a visit, another sister was there, from out of town. How did it begin‭? I don't remember, but begin it did. I began to look forward to those free afternoons because that meant hours of kissing and fondling. And talking about her boyfriend. I had the seminary, she had a boyfriend. It added zest to those stolen hours. The married sister facilitated these meetings, and my classmate seemed to regard the whole thing as a bagatelle. I knew better. I felt divided and miserable. I talked with Curly Ryan and then made an appointment with Bishop Byrne, an auxiliary who was pastor of Nativity parish in St. Paul. He was a severe and rigorous man, and I anticipated hell and brimstone as I told him my story. He was very gentle, He advised me to leave the seminary.\n\nAnd so, for the second time, not without regret, I left the seminary, armed with my bachelor's degree. I didn't leave it physically right away‭; at the beginning of summer, I worked at the seminary during the priests‭' retreat, living in an attic room in Grace, and still wearing a cassock and collar. I was visited there by Rich Fleischaecker, an old classmate from Nazareth Hall with whom I had corresponded while we were both in the service, he in Japan, I in California. In our letters, we had both expressed regret at having left Nazareth Hall and indulged the thought of returning. Restored to civilian life, Rich had lost all intention of becoming a priest. Now, when I told him I was leaving the major seminary, he was very upset. I think he had cast me in the role of sacrificial victim. I would become a priest, and that somehow would justify his living in the world, as we used to say. Well, I felt pretty bad myself.\n\nThe major seminary was not sold, but it has been cannibalized by St. Thomas University, an institution in ceaseless metastasis. Jim Hill's boxcars are now college dorms. The seminary has been pushed into a corner of the grounds near the chapel. And, my God, the chapel. The choir stalls are gone and one now enters from the opposite end, where the sanctuary used to be. The place would look like a basketball court if it weren't for the stained glass windows and stations. Such iconoclasm must have been driven by hatred of the sacred. A generation of post-conciliar revolutionaries wreaked havoc on the church. Well, God is merciful. But I find it hard to forgive such sacrilege.\n\n‭\n\n‬FOUR‭: PATERFAMILIAS‭\n\nSome years ago, whenever I was driving a fair distance, I began the habit of going down the list of our children and seeing how many things I could remember of each of them. I proceed chronologically: Cathy, Mary, Anne, Dave, Beth, and Dan. Of course that is not the whole story. Our first child, Michael, died when he was three. Some of his brothers and sisters never knew him. No matter. One day they will. He lies now beside Connie in Cedar Grove, and I will lie there with them bye and bye.\n\n‭Connie and I were in the fiftieth year of our marriage when she died on May 18, 2002. By then all our children were married and gone, raising families of their own, and we had moved to a house in the northern suburb of Granger, something we had once vowed never to do. For thirty-three years we lived at 2158 Portage Ave. in South Bend, in a great brick house on an acre and half of lawn. Only our youngest, Daniel, was born after we moved there, but all the children grew up in that house and I am sure it is place that figures in their earliest memories.\n\n‭Connie and I were introduced one fateful Saturday in April, 1952, when I was at my typewriter in the Catholic Youth Center on Park Avenue in Minneapolis, preparing an issue of the little magazine I edited for Father Baglio, the director of the center and my part-time employer. I was doing graduate work at the University of Minnesota in philosophy, but every day I put in several hours at the center. In the manner of celibates, Baglio was a tireless matchmaker, and on this occasion he looked in at me, all smiles, “‬There's someone you've got to meet.”\n\nThe someone was Constance Terrill Kunert, who had come to the CYC in the improbable role of assistant leader of a troop of girl scouts. We met in the pool room in the basement because that is where their tour of the center had reached. She was of medium height, her black hair worn in what was called a pageboy, with a lovely smile that had a nice sardonic edge to it. That might have been it if I hadn't run into her on campus some days later. She was completing her junior year. We went off to the Bridge Café for coffee and I met some of her friends. We went out, I introduced her to Bob McDonald. I met her parents, I brought her home. In a memory book she prepared for a granddaughter, Connie wrote that I began to talk marriage right from the beginning. I can believe it. I had gone with half a dozen girls since returning to the world, I had brought some of them home, I had sensed the lack of enthusiasm in my mother. My father had been impressed by one Catherine Brown. But both my parents took to Connie immediately, as who would not have‭?\n\nI have sometimes thought that our marriage was such a good one because we scarcely knew one another on our wedding day. We met in April, when I was in the throes of completing my master's dissertation, defending it, finishing the spring quarter, and working at the CYC. I wanted to get my M.A. in one year so that in the fall I could continue my graduate work in Quebec. The quarter ended early in June, and I went off to Baraboo, Wisconsin, with my family to work at the powder plant where my father was project engineer—that's powder in the sense of gunpowder—and live on the shore of Lake Delton. On Friday night I roared off in a car pool to Minneapolis, a drive of over three hundred miles, in order to be with Connie. As often as not, we spent time with my brother Roger and his wife Lue, who had an apartment overlooking Loring Park. Did I go up every weekend‭? I think I did. But one week Connie spent with my family at Lake Delton. Then, early in September 1952, I went off to Quebec to begin my studies at Univerité Laval. The plan was that I would return after the fall semester, and Connie and I would marry so I could bring her back to Quebec with me. We were married on January 3, 1953, in her parish church of St. Thomas the Apostle, Father Cleary presiding. Bob McDonald was my best man, and in the sanctuary were Fathers Baumgaertner and Henri DuLac, both graduates of Laval and both regarding me as a protégé. (‬The previous summer, I had wisely decided against accepting an offer from Father DuLac to teach at St. Thomas on the basis of my M.A.) Connie and I spent our first night at the Lowell Inn in Stillwater, Minnesota, then drove back to Minneapolis the next morning to catch the train to Quebec. We had an upper in the Pullman car and in the morning, when we parted the curtains and looked out, we found that all the other berths had been stashed away and the seats were filled with black-suited seminarians returning to Windsor. We arrived in Quebec on the Epiphany, January 6. It was a town made even more charming by newly fallen snow, lots of it. We were, in a sense, home.\n\n‭One could calculate how many hours and days Connie and I were actually together before our wedding, but if either of us had been calculating we probably would have waited. During the fall, Connie had foregone her senior year of college in order to work in a boutique to raise money for our future life. To this day I can scarcely believe my own economic naiveté. I had exhausted the G.I. Bill by this point, and a non-Canadian could not get a fellowship at Laval. I had made some money working in Baraboo, but during the fall semester in Quebec I was living on fifteen dollars a week sent by my mother, a week at a time. Five dollars went for my room, so I had the grand total of ten dollars to live on. Breakfast—coffee and toast—cost fifteen cents. I could get a dinner special for sixty-three cents, and have lunch for a quarter at the Greek restaurant across from the Faculté de philosophie on the Chemin Ste-Foye. That adds up to something like $7.25 a week for meals. I was thin but healthy.\n\n‭After our marriage, the parental dole increased to $150 a month, half of which went for rent. At first we shared an apartment with a grass widow named Yolande and then with a divorced man, Ross Thilman, who was seldom home. Next we moved into a basement apartment at 60 Avenue des Braves. In December, Michael was born at Hôpital St. Sacrement, on a Sunday. The Germains, in whose house we were living, took us off to the hospital early in the morning. In the manner of those sensible days, I was kept away from the proceedings. Labor went on all day but finally the news came. ‬Puer natus est nobis‭‬. They let me see Connie and then I went off with George Lavere to celebrate, the two of us singing a then popular song, “‬O Mine Papa.”\n\nHow in the world we managed to afford a child on our budget I don't remember. But then, that was a feature of our life together. Connie was the practical one, so she became chancellor of the exchequer. This was meant to free me for my work. I came to Quebec with an M.A. In the summer of 1953 I was given a Licence en philosophie, magna cum laude‭; my doctorate, summa cum laude, was awarded in the spring of 1954. But we had already left in April, my folks having come to take the three of us to Silver Bay above Duluth, where my father was now project manager at the taconite plant. Connie's folks drove up to fetch us a few weeks later and take us back to their home in Minneapolis. I myself had idiotically agreed to return to Quebec to teach summer school English. I suppose I was flattered to be asked. Connie kept the daily letter I wrote her, and after her death I found one of them in the table beside her bed. Why she had put that one there, I cannot say. I pored over it for significance, but it was only the lovesick letter of an absent husband. In the fall we would be heading for Omaha, where I would begin teaching philosophy at the Jesuit university, Creighton. The salary was $3700 for nine months.\n\n‬Perhaps everyone remembers the addresses at which he has lived. In Omaha we lived in a row house at 4111 Valley, with two floors. My brother Rog and Bob McDonald pulled a trailer load of inherited furniture from Minneapolis for us. My father gave us his 1949 Hudson, on which he had put a lot of miles, but it was only five years old. The camshaft had a disconcerting way of sliding forward when you braked‭; it was turtle-shaped and had a miniature shifting device beneath the steering wheel, not the usual stick. Living above ground for a change, surrounded by other young couples, we were a family. Our friends were for the most part connected to Creighton, but already Connie showed her knack for making friends and soon knew everyone living around us.\n\nIn December I received a letter from the University of Notre Dame telling me that my job would be ready the following fall. This was and was not a surprise. Charles DeKoninck, dean of the Faculté de Philosophie at Laval, director of my dissertation, and all I hoped to become, had told me that he wanted me to teach at Notre Dame. Other students of his were already there. He wrote Notre Dame and was told, not this year but next. Sure. By that time I had become acquainted with the hard cold facts about academic employment. I had sent out some fifty letters to departments of philosophy announcing my availability. Most of them went unanswered. In the end I received two offers, one from Villanova University, which involved classics and philosophy, and the other from Creighton, where I went to be interviewed shortly after we had arrived at the Kunerts‭' home. Ed Rousseau has told me that I had clinched the job halfway into the interview, having allayed his fears about having a Laval Thomist of the strict observance on the faculty. Connie and I loved Creighton, we had made friends, I was flourishing, but still, it was Notre Dame. When I told the dean at Creighton that I would not be back in the fall, he was unhappy. Years later I would learn that he had actually written to his counterpart at Notre Dame, objecting to this raiding of his faculty. All this gave me an undeserved luster when I arrived in South Bend.\n\n‭We had four addresses in South Bend. Our first year, 1955-56, we were at 1727 S. Michigan, a house that no longer exists. We then moved to 15A Vetville, also long since demolished, then 3317 Rexford Drive, from which we moved to our house on Portage Avenue.\n\n‭Marriage is the school in which most of us learn our own defects as well as the joys and griefs of life. I have a vivid memory of the moment in Quebec when I realized that Connie was an autonomous person, not just a footnote to my life. That realization presented the chance, at least, to emerge from egoism. With the birth of Michael, then of Cathleen in September of 1955, and of Mary in September of 1956, the hectic and demanding but deeply satisfying task of raising children was thrust upon us. Connie was to have seven children in the course of some ten and a half years. We just had them. That was the point of being married. And in those days seven was not considered a large number of children, among Catholics, I mean.\n\n‭We had moved into 15A Vetville in 1956 because it was cheaper and we were facing the prospect of large medical bills. The rent was thirty-five dollars a month. Only a few units were reserved for faculty. Those fertile acres, with their rows of barrack-like buildings, children all over the place, were meant for married students. Our living there as the family of a faculty member was a concession, though it was difficult to think of it as a prize. The village is long gone, of course, commemorated by a plaque. I can locate the exact spot where 15A stood, directly west from the north corner formed by the meeting of Bulla and Juniper. Before we could make the move from Michigan Avenue, Connie was off to the hospital to have Mary: she went from one address, and I brought her home to another. So now there were five of us. Connie and I, Michael, Cathy, and Mary. The months ahead were to be our via dolorosa. We were on the threshold of the first great tragedy of our lives. There is a photograph of me at the time, seated on the sofa, bracketed by Mary and Cathy. My expression is one of both joy and sorrow.\n\nAlready in Omaha, Michael's doctor had expressed concern about him, and we went to South Bend with his recommendation of a pediatrician. The diagnosis eventually was encephalitis, perhaps due to the mumps Connie had contracted during her pregnancy. Throughout our first year in South Bend the concern had mounted, and in the summer of 1956 Michael went into the hospital for his first operation. The idea was to introduce a tube to relieve the pressure on his brain. I think there were three such attempts, all eventually unsuccessful. He spent time in every hospital in South Bend: Childrens‭'‬, Memorial, St. Joseph. He died on a Sunday, February 10, 1957, not two months after his third birthday. We learned the meaning of loss.\n\n‬Michael was buried in Highland Cemetery on Portage Avenue, in a row reserved for children. It was February, snow lay on the ground, and we all followed the priests from the cars parked along the cemetery road, Connie and I coming in a car supplied by McGann, the funeral director. Our parents were there, making the long trip from Minneapolis to bury their first grandchild. Our friends the Oesterles were there, the Fitzgeralds, the Smiths, the Caponigris, the Bobiks, and other colleagues, many of them now long since dead themselves.\n\n‭‬When Michael was buried our stay in South Bend was also sealed as permanent. We could not have left him and gone elsewhere, not permanently. And his loss confirmed as well my allegiance to Notre Dame. In 1963 we bought the house on Portage Avenue, a short walk from Highland Cemetery, and for years I would go out there to Michael's grave and grieve the loss of our firstborn. I could see his grave from the road when I drove past. In 1999 we moved him from Highland Cemetery to Cedar Grove, where we had bought three plots. Our friend, Father Marvin O'Connell conducted the brief ceremony.\n\n‭‬One survives such experiences because they retain a note of the incredible. When it was over, Father Philip Moore, vice president of Academic Affairs, called me in. He had a Popeye jaw and a gruff manner, but he too was a philosopher, and I had always found him kind. He mumbled something about the trouble we'd been through, then told me to make a list of what we owed and give it to him. The university would take care of everything. What was more, we would be given a down payment on a house so we could have our own place. Those were simpler days. A neophyte like myself knew and was known by the officers of the university. Father Hesburgh would have put on sackcloth and ashes if he ran into a member of the faculty he didn't know.\n\n‭Things have changed, as things will. The Ladies of Notre Dame once consisted of the wives of professors, and at his annual dinner for the faculty, Father Hesburgh would acknowledge the role that wives played in the work of Notre Dame, subsidiary, of course, as helpmates to their husbands. In those days there wasn't a wife who objected to that. Hesburgh was incapable of a social gaffe or of offending an audience. Well, not wholly incapable. Once, speaking at length after one of his dinners for the faculty, he came to the end of what he had to say—usually a travelogue to divert us homebodies with an account of where he had been during the year—and looked out over the tables on each of which was a floral arrangement. He said it would be a shame to just leave them, but how to fairly distribute them‭? Then came the epiphany: “‬I have it. The oldest woman at each table take the flowers.” Well, on that basis the flowers would still be rotting in the dining hall like Miss Haversham's wedding cake.\n\n‭The kind of help we were given by the university would come to be regarded as paternalistic. Perhaps it was. But when you're down and out, a parent is what you need. I recently found a letter from the nun who directed St. Joseph Hospital, in which she wiped out anything we owed beyond what was covered by Blue Cross. I was only in my second year at Notre Dame when this happened, but the university response did not wholly surprise me. Of course, helping us buy a house was to help us put down roots. I had come to Notre Dame as the promised land and from the beginning had felt welcomed into what was unabashedly called the Notre Dame family. Of course, it would be ironic now to apply such a phrase to a faculty who are largely strangers to one another, but in those years it was a justifiably analogous use of “‬family‭”—as I would have pedantically put it.\n\n‭Eventually, all six of our surviving children graduated from Notre Dame, and the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, the campus church, would be the setting of baptisms, weddings, funerals. Michael was buried from there, and it was there on a chill spring day, May 21, 2002‭, that Connie's funeral Mass was said and Father Marvin O'Connell, who had become almost one of the family, preached a memorable homily.\n\n‭When Connie's cancer was first diagnosed I called my friend Dr. Alex Shirger at the Mayo Clinic and he urged me to bring her there. Lou Solomon came along and stayed in Rochester for the time it took to confirm the seriousness of Connie's illness. Dave and Lou Solomon had long been our closest friends on the faculty‭; never had friendship meant more than during the following seven months.\n\n‭As I followed the casket down the aisle, accompanied by my children and their spouses, the sense of being an emotional amputee was softened by their presence. They have all of them married wonderfully well, they all have families of their own, and had taken turns to be with their mother in her last months. Our friend Sally Norton had come from Devon to spend two weeks with Connie in April and helped her decide which of the girls would get which items of jewelry. And they had spent an afternoon rearranging in its cabinet the bone china Connie had been given by her grandmother. Once Connie and I had followed Michael's little white casket down that same aisle, and now I was following hers. We walked to the cemetery up Notre Dame Avenue, and after the burial and a luncheon for the hundreds who had come to the funeral, I went home with my children. Anne stayed with me for several days, but then I was alone in an empty house. It was days before I could even weep.\n\n‭I had been appointed to the President's Committee on Arts and Humanities in 2001 but could not attend the first meeting because of Connie's illness. When I suggested that if I did go, Mary, who lived in Baltimore, could come along. Connie sat up, eyes flashing. “‬Don't you dare.” The suggestion brought home that we were waiting for her death, and her feisty response was meant to push away the realization. Not that she had any illusions about her condition. We had once promised that we would never keep medical news from one another, and I had the awful duty of telling her when the doctors said there was no need of further treatment. For one MRI, I took her to St. Joseph Hospital, where she stayed overnight. I found a priest for her and when he came, Sally was in the room. He asked Connie if she would like to receive communion. She looked at him. “‬I think I'll go to confession first.” Sally and I stepped into the hall. After that Connie was fully resigned to what lay ahead. Father John Jenkins brought her communion at home, and Father Ernan McMullin, a veritable hero of the works of mercy (‬when Michael was dying, he was often there with us‭)‬, visited as well. Connie had a final luncheon party for her women friends, Nancy Kommers, Liz Christman, Carole McKim, Pat Weber, Nan Shane, Lou Solomon—each of whom seemed sure she was her closest and dearest friend, and it went off well.\n\n‬One or the other of my daughters has usually accompanied me to Washington for meetings of the President's Committee, since there are social functions involved, and they have had a chance to meet Laura Bush. Recently both Anne and Mary came with me, and afterward we drove to Baltimore, Mary at the wheel, Anne beside her, me in the back. My daughters have grown into beautiful women and it takes great discipline not to blurt out to others how I love and admire them and my sons. On that occasion, listening to my daughters chattering in the front seat, I was all but overwhelmed with pride in them. All the children bear the impress of their mother, though in different ways. Doubtless that is why we have been spared the heartbreak that comes when one's child drifts away, going down paths of which one cannot approve, freaking out one way or another. If this does not happen, it is a blessing, not an accomplishment of the parents, save in small part. And that part, I believe, is largely due to the mother. In the grammar from which I learned Latin there was an illustration of a Roman matron, the famous Cornelia, with her children. When a wealthy friend spoke of her jewels, Cornelia said, pointing to her sons, ‬Haec sunt margaritae meae‭‬. These are my jewels. I loved to give Connie rings and watches and bracelets and earrings and necklaces. They have all been distributed now to her real jewels.\n\n‭\n\n‬FIVE‭: EUROPE‭\n\nLouvain‭\n\nOne September day in 1959 we set out on our first trip to Europe. We sailed from Hoboken on the ‬Statendam‭‬, bound for Southampton and on to Amsterdam, courtesy of the Fulbright Commission. I had been awarded a research scholarship to Belgium, to Louvain University for the academic year. By the terms of the grant, Fulbright paid the travel expenses of the scholar alone, though the stipend in Belgium was predicated on our number. I had been awarded a Belgian-American Fellowship as well as the Fulbright, could not have accepted both, and chose the Fulbright because it amounted to a lot more support. But the travel expenses for Connie and three children—Anne had arrived the previous October—presented an obstacle. When I was discussing my good fortune with Father Sheedy, the dean of the College of Arts and Letters, the matter of passage for my family came up. He dismissed it as only one who has taken the vow of poverty could. ”‬We'll take care of that.” And they did, so there we were in first class, the children looked after by a nanny, rubbing shoulders with the affluent and not wholly comfortable. From time to time we would slip down to whatever the next class was called, and there we met other Fulbright awardees. Why weren't they in first class‭? I realized that in the pecking order of the foundation, a research scholar outranked someone like Ray Lavalle, who would be teaching in Dinant, and Ernie Trumble, who would be teaching in Liège, to say nothing of mere graduate students like Jeffrey Russell. None of this mattered once we were in Belgium, and we became quite close to the Lavallees and the Trumbles, the former from Iowa, the latter from Oklahoma. Connie's twenty-eighth birthday occurred while we were aboard, on September 25, 1959, and a great fuss was made about it in the dining room. Violinists came to our table, a special cake was brought in. Connie was asked what music she would like to hear. I was delighted by all this but, like Connie, was not wholly comfortable in those surroundings. Professors in those days knew the meaning of penury.\n\n‭Since I had entertained fantasies about Europe from reading about the expatriate American authors, I was glad to be going at last. Yet at the same time I felt impossibly old, a late bloomer, as one might have said, though it sounds like expired underwear. All my heroes had been off to Europe in their twenties—some earlier, if they had been in World War I—and here I was, at the advanced age of thirty, making my first crossing. But of course I was traveling in my guise as philosopher, the grant was to enable me to study the relationship between Heidegger and Aristotle, and fiction was not in prospect.\n\n‬Connie had been given a lot of bad advice on how to survive a year in Europe with a family. Just about everything she was told turned out to be false. In one trunk we had actually packed cooking utensils, as if these would be unknown in Belgium. Connie was given stories about the impossibility of doing laundry, of the hazards of shopping, all of them utterly false. It was an extremely pleasant year. After the orientation in Brussels, we rented the apartment of a Dr. Zimmerman, who was off to Philadelphia for the year. The apartment was located one floor from the top of the Atlantic building, on the Avenue des Allies (‬Bondgenotenlaan‭) just before it runs into the Place Foch. It was beautifully furnished, the concierge became Connie's protectress, and we had a cleaning lady. Whatever the stipend it enabled us to live better than we ever had before. I actually bought a new car, a Citroen à deux chevaux, in which we traveled everywhere, and when I sold it at the end of the year, I got seven hundred dollars for it. It had cost about nine hundred new. It was the first year that Connie ran our household without anxiety about money.\n\n‬Cathy had just turned four. Mary was just three, and Anne was not yet a year old. We were made welcome by Belgians who had spent time in the States on reverse Fulbrights, and on their advice we decided to enroll Cathy and Mary in the preschool at the Soeurs de Marie. This was to furnish the germ for my first published story, “‬The First Farewell.” They soon loved it. Each morning I would set out for the Institut de Philosophie with the girls in tow, drop them at their school, and then go on to the Institute. This was founded by Cardinal Mercier, one of the great figures in the Thomistic Revival inaugurated by Leo XIII's 1879 encyclical ‬Aeterni Patris‬. The then director was Father Louis De Raymaecker, and he formally received me in his office, gave me tea, and politely inquired about my work, my colleagues, my university. In that setting I felt that I was being initiated into the sources of my philosophical outlook (‬Charles De Koninck held his doctorate from Louvain‭)‬. Years later, in the early 1980s, I was a visiting professor at the University of Leuven, lecturing in English, and one day I went to pay my respects to the current director. Making conversation, I said something to the effect that it must be extremely satisfying to occupy that office, given the enormous influence of the institute. He raised a hand to stop me. “‬We don't do that sort of thing anymore.” Ah yes. Even the great centers of Thomism had abandoned their patrimony.\n\n‬Although my main task was my own research, I also took part in the De Wulf Mansion Seminar with Suzanne Mansion—the niece of the great Auguste—and with Gerald Verbeke, Jean Ladrière, others. But for the most part I was at work in the institute library or in the main library located on Hoover Platz. Often in the afternoon I would write at the dining room table in our apartment, from whose windows we had an unequaled view of the library tower. Far more dramatically than any clock, the tower told the time of day by the play of the weather on it and the dramatic sunsets that silhouetted it against the evening sky. Of course it had a chiming clock as well—a good thing, since Belgium is not noted for its sun. It was at that dining-room table that I wrote my first book, but more of that anon.\n\n‬We were determined to take maximum advantage of our year and see as much as we could. We made several excursions into Holland, riding the canals of Amsterdam and visiting the miniature town of Meduridam. And of course to Antwerp, to Dinant to visit Ray and Felicia Lavallee, to Bruges, and to Ghent. We invaded Germany and were robbed in Cologne of cameras and some dolls of the girls. The Citroen had a top that was little more than a window shade‭; this had been cut through and the items plucked from the back seat. Ah well. Germans. We went on to Bonn and continued east, visiting Dachau. At Christmas we traveled to Davos in Switzerland, to St. Josef Haus, a former hospital, where I fell ill, feeling like Hans Castorp. The nuns plied me with hot milk into which eggs had been stirred, a Dominican gave me a German work on existentialism when he heard what my research project was, and I lay reading while Connie and the kids cavorted in the winter paradise. One night Connie went on a sleigh ride with a group of seminarians, an ambiguous excursion she never failed to refer to without a sly look. I could make the look fade by reminding her that she had married a former seminarian.\n\nAt Easter we drove to Paris, which was of course crowded, and we had difficult time getting settled. My besetting sin as a traveler is never to make plans in advance, but rather to drive into a town in the full expectation that comfortable accommodation can be had. By and large this is true, but in Europe in those days, and on holidays, it was not. One of the places where I stopped to see if they could accommodate us turned out to be a brothel. We were not flying completely blind. We had met and regularly entertained a number of American priests studying at Louvain. There were several from Kentucky‭; Jim Doig from Notre Dame‭; Dave Boileau, a Michiganer from the diocese of Little Rock‭; Bob Smith of Rockville Center and Tony Lovegrove of Hove, who rode a motorcycle with RAF abandon. The map of Europe for these men consisted of religious houses or inexpensive hotels where they could stay when they were traveling. It was from them that we had learned of St. Josef Haus in Davos, and Connie actually arranged for our stay there before we left Louvain. These more or less short excursions went on throughout the year, but in the spring we set off on our grand tour. We went down the Rhine valley, over to Switzerland, and then through the Brenner Pass to Italy and on to Rome. In returning we followed the Riviera and went west to Spain and Barcelona, after which we ascended through France to Paris and then home to Louvain.\n\nConnie kept a book in which she logged our progress and recorded our expenses. There were five of us, two adults, three children, and an automobile that however abstemious did need gas from time to time. We made the great circuit I have sketched on less than a thousand dollars, closer to eight hundred dollars. We were not traveling first class, but only rarely did we stop at a place we wished to flee as soon as possible. Germany was less hospitable to children, to put it mildly, whereas in Italy the sight of our little girls was the open sesame. In Florence a waiter took Anne and led her up and down so that everyone at the outside tables could see her. Anne had been a babe in arms when we left home, and I remember the joy with which we abandoned her stroller in Heidelberg. From now on she could walk or at least be carried. The front wheel of the stroller was possessed by a demon who made forward progress all but impossible. In parting with it, I effectively told the demon to take it home with him.\n\nIn Louvain, French was the language of the university and shops, but beneath the surface the resentment of the Flemish toward the French-speaking Walloons seethed. The time would come when prosperity switched from the Walloons to the Flemings, and the latter made their move. The impact on the university was almost comic. The historic university became Flemish—Leuven—and a new university would be built for the French-speaking students, not directly reachable from the old, called Université Catholique de Louvain. My dear friend Eugeen DeJonghe was then an officer of the university and argued fruitlessly against this division. How do you divide a historic library‭? “‬Eenie meenie minie mo‭” was the method agreed on, one for you, one for me. Well the havoc this wrought has been somewhat repaired by time, but the prestige and influence of the university have been halved by this doubling.\n\n‬That year Connie went on a trip to Libya with Felicia Lavallee, who had a sister in Tripoli. I, in turn, drove to Copenhagen in order to present offprints of articles I had written on Kierkegaard to the Royal Library. On the way back I stopped at the University of Groningen to see if I could find a copy of G. O. Muskens's book on analogy, which had been a dissertation there. Coming through Breda, passing a hospital, I was hit broadside by a car that came roaring out of the drive. My little car tumbled over, I was thrown out, and the car came to rest on my inner leg. I was briefly in shock, but then I looked up into the face of a bearded Capuchin and thought it was all over. ‬Nunc dimittis‭‬. I was taken into the hospital and checked over. Nothing broken. The damage had been to my clothing and my car. Connie was notified and was driven up by a contingent of our clerical friends. When she came into the ward, the way I lay gave her the impression that I had lost a leg. After shock wore off, she and her cohorts seemed almost disappointed that I was not on the brink of death or maimed for life. They had to settle for the bad news about the car.\n\n‬The car was repaired for a negligible sum, and I later went up to Breda to retrieve it. I was clearly the innocent party in the accident, as the other driver, the wife of a physician, had insisted as she followed me into the hospital. Her memory altered under the counsel of calculating friends. After all, I was an American and therefore presumably rich. For years I was annoyed by official letters demanding that I appear in court in Breda to answer the charges against me. Replies more appropriate to my time in the Marines than to a professor of philosophy occurred, but I simply ignored these absurd demands and eventually they stopped.\n\n‬When our year was done and the car sold, we headed for England. We visited Tony Lovegrove's family and had a picnic at Norfolk, then on to London. We stayed near Victoria station in a bed and breakfast, and the kids loved the breakfasts, as big as those in Holland. We went sight-seeing by public transportation—the Abbey, the Tower, Oxford Street. Now when I see young couples traveling with their children I find it difficult to believe the insouciance with which we set off with our three little ones, doing things we ourselves had never done before. Only the young have the resilience for such adventures. In Rome I can locate the hotel in which we stayed, having arrived unannounced. I simply drove around stopping at hotels and asking if they could put us up. The Olympics were about to be held in Rome, and this complicated matters so far as housing went. We ended up in a place not far from the Piazza San Silvestro, on the top floor, in one of the rooms with one large bed for the five of us. Am I wrong to think we managed it because it all seemed a game, unreal, fun‭? In Rome I drove up to the front steps of St. Peter's on a Wednesday, and we went in to see Pope John XXIII being carried into the basilica, blessing benignly as the carriers struggled under his avoirdupois. It was pure chance but at the time it seemed just right. You want to see the Pope‭? Drop into St. Peter's. As if he were perpetually on display. Connie had her hair done on the Corso, and I have a wonderful photograph of her in her new French roll, with one of the fountains in St. Peter's square as background. She is beautiful, the woman I loved. Whenever I pass that fountain I think of the photograph and of late would like to cry, except that the memory is so pleasant. That trip was the harbinger of two more pleasant years in Rome.\n\n‬In London the kids came down with mumps and we had to smuggle them aboard and into the cabin before anyone noticed. Once underway, we called the ship's doctor, and they received wonderful care and arrived cured. Our next voyage by ship would exact revenge for this ruse.\n\n‭\n\nOxford, Edinburgh, Duns‭\n\nMy next European trip, in 1965, was solo. I flew to Britain for a Dun Scotus meeting that began in Oxford, went on to Edinburgh, and ended with the unveiling of a memorial to the Subtle Doctor at Duns. I lodged in Merton College and was most impressed by the original library, with its warped wavy floors and sections named after the liberal arts. The post-Reformation shenanigans at high table stood in stark contrast to the origins of the college and the university. It is only in recent years with Eamon Duffy's ‬Strippng of the Altars‭‬, that the English have been made to confront the depredations of Henry and Elizabeth. This is likely due to the fact that nowadays belief of any kind is in short supply in once Merrie England. What was I, a Thomist, doing at a Scotus conference‭? Reading a paper, of course, on Scotus and univocity and enjoying the Franciscan triumphalism of the occasion. In Oxford I had tea with Stephen Brown and the bishop of Beirut—or was he only one of the bishops of Beirut‭?—and in Edinburgh, at a reception given by the provost of the city, there was a Trappist abbot wearing a swallow-tail coat and a hearing aid. Think about it.\n\n‭‬Via Ugo Balzani‭\n\nThe ‬annus mirabilis‭ of our family has to be 1969-70, which we spent in Rome courtesy of the National Endowment for the Humanities. The year began with a series of disasters. Mindful of our pleasant Fulbright voyage, we planned to travel by ship. I had flown to the Scotus meeting, and being set down in England after a few hours in the air seemed too abrupt. There were now eight in our party, with David and Beth and Dan having come along in 1961, 1962, and 1964, respectively. The ship was to embark from a Manhattan dock, so there was no need, as before, to arrange for transfer to Hoboken. We settled into a hotel within sight of the ship, and Dave and I went off to drop something at my then literary agent's, walking most of the way. The following day we went aboard, all the wonderful memories of the ‬Statendam‭ came back, the kids loved it, and we weighed anchor and were off. As the ship progressed up the east coast, Beth fell ill. Seasickness‭? Perhaps. The nurse and doctor visited her. She didn't get better. The pain was severe in her abdomen. It turned out to be appendicitis. What to do‭? There was an operating theater on board, but this was for emergency purposes. Nor did the ship's doctor look eager to perform surgery. The solution was to disembark at Halifax so that Beth could be operated on there. There was talk of sending out a helicopter, but that was not necessary. We docked, an ambulance was waiting, and we all followed Beth to the hospital.\n\nThere was a ten-day recovery period after the operation. Our ship sailed away. The first night we all, all but Beth, stayed in a reception depot for immigrants. It was an experience that induced long thoughts of my ancestors during the night. All our plans had collapsed. The VW van that awaited us in Le Havre would wait in vain. The boat tickets had been given back to me, so I guess we sailed from New York to Halifax for free. To our rescue came a marvelous doctor and his family, who helped us get settled in a rooming house and entertained us at their home. The kids loved it. Meanwhile, I had to figure out how to get us to Rome. The original idea was to pick up our van and drive in a leisurely fashion to Italy. I was able to exchange the ship tickets for air fare to Montreal and then to Paris. The plan was that from Paris I would then go to Le Havre, pick up the van, return for the family, and drive us all to Rome. The problem was that the papers that had been prepared for the van were now out of date, and new ones would not be ready for a week. So there we were stranded in Paris. We did a little sightseeing‭; we ran into John Beach and his wife, just returning from their place on the Costa Brava (‬a philosopher with a place on the Spanish Riviera‭?); and we fretted. My solution was to take all the traveler's checks that had been meant to make our journey to Rome so pleasant and buy plane tickets to Rome. Eight tickets pretty well wiped us out, but we had to get to Rome.\n\nWe got to Rome. Father Mullahy, who had spent years in Rome at the generalate of the Congregation of Holy Cross, had assured me that Vince McAloon would smooth our way, help get us settled, and find a place for us to spend the year. I was ready to be pampered. We called on Vince in his ad hoc Notre Dame Club near Santa Maria Maggiore and, more importantly, near the restaurant the Scoglio di Frisio. Vince had graduated from Notre Dame in the late 1930s and spent the war years in Italy. He never went home. (‬Well, eventually he did. He returned to campus and lived with the brothers in Columba Hall until he died.) He was the soul of affability and Irish charm. He was a big hit with the kids. He was utterly useless. His way of helping us find an apartment was to give me a copy of the ads in ‬Il Tempo‭‬. I went to an agency, was taken to an apartment at Via Ugo Balzani 6, and rented it. I would have rented any apartment I was taken to first. Then I rented a car, we had our gear delivered to the apartment, and we moved in. The next "
