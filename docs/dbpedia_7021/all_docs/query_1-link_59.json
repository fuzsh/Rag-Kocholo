        "text": "Benjamin Franklin, a talented man. Vital statistics Title Chief Printer of the Pennsylvania Gazette, Postmaster General of the United States of America, leading author, printer, political theorist, politician, free mason, scientist, inventor, humorist, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat Gender Male Race Indo-European (northern) Faction America Health {{{health}}} Level {{{level}}} Age 67 (1773) Status Alive (in series) Location Philadelphia (hometown)\n\nParis, France (1776-1785)\n\nBenjamin Franklin is the owner of the Pennsylvania Gazette, Moses and James' employer, and Sarah's host during her time in the colonies. He is also an author, scientist, inventor, statesman and ambassador. He is regarded as \"the First American,\" and is one of the founding fathers of the United States of America.\n\nPhysical appearance[]\n\nBen is a stout, elderly man with fair skin, blue eyes, and long hair with a receding hairline. He normally keeps his hair loose. He wears a cream shirt and simple tie with a brown waistcoat, brown breeches and matching buckle shoes. He has a brown overcoat to match, and is often seen wearing a coonskin cap. He uses bifocal spectacles and occasionally requires a cane due to gout. In his youth, he had light brown hair that he kept tied back in a standard ponytail, as was the fashion of the 18th century.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nBenjamin Franklin is a kind person who took in two orphans (James Hiller and Henri Richard Maurice Dutoit LeFebrve), and agreed to host Sarah Phillips, a British loyalist and the daughter of a friend. He respects other people's opinions and is also courteous to others. He stands up for what he believes is right, and acts as one of the cooler heads in the Continental Congress. He is bold, daring to go to the king of France and ask for help, and even play the French and British off of one another to secure an alliance with France. He is incredibly intelligent, witty and clever, with a great sense of humor. Despite his age, he is very popular with all the ladies of the aristocracy. He is a staunch opponent of slavery, hiring Moses, a freed slave, as his mechanic and shopkeeper and encouraging him to continue his education and pursue his goals.\n\nLife[]\n\nBen was born in 1706 (on the Gregorian calendar) into a household of 17 children in Boston, Massachusetts. At the age of nine, his parents' financial situation forced him to drop out of the local school system, so Ben continued his education at home. He worked as an apprentice candlemaker under his father and saved up the money he made to buy books. As a teenager, Ben became an apprentice printer under his older brother James. During this time, Ben began writing a humor and opinion column under the pseudonym Mrs. Silence Dogood, a middle aged widow. He enjoyed watching people laugh at his work and wonder about the identity of the author. When his brother James found out Ben was the author, he began abusing him. Ben eventually left Boston altogether and moved to Philadelphia. James' poor treatment of Ben helped shape Ben's views of tyranny and slavery.\n\nBen eventually became a journalist and author. One of his most famous works was his Poor Richard's Almanac, which contained many of his witty sayings and nuggets of wisdom. Ben also developed an interest in science and invention, becoming especially curious about electricity. He is well remembered for flying a kite into a thunderstorm to study the buildup of static charges at the cloud base. His insatiable curiosity and knack for out-of-the-box thinking resulted in many, many inventions, including the lightning rod, the glass armonica, the Franklin stove, the rocking chair, and bifocal lenses for glasses. He eventually moved into politics and was appointed the postmaster general of Pennsylvania Colony by the king of England.\n\nBen married a woman named Deborah Read. He had three children; William from a previous relationship; Francis, who died of smallpox at the age of four; and Sarah (known as Sally), who married and raised a family in Philadelphia. William was appointed governor of New Jersey for a time. He and Ben clashed severely over the issue of American identity and independence, eventually becoming estranged. Ben took in William's son, William Temple Franklin, and raised him from the age of four. Temple accompanied Ben on all of his journeys from that time on.\n\nRole in the series[]\n\nAt the opening of the series, in 1773, Ben is on trial in England, accused of inciting the Boston Tea Party and acting traitorously to the Crown. Ben maintains his innocence by claiming that America is not a British country, but a new and unique entity, and he can only betray his own country. Since he has not betrayed America, he cannot be counted a traitor. He is stripped of all titles and authority bestowed upon him by the Crown, returning home to Philadelphia two years later to aid the cause of independence.\n\nDuring his time in Philadelphia, Ben oversees Sarah and James' work as journalists, encouraging them to follow the growing Continental Army. He joins the Continental Congress, eventually forming a committee to draft the Declaration of Independence along with John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. After the resolution for independence passes, Ben travels with Adams to try and convince the Howe brothers, Admiral Richard Howe and General William Howe, to recognize America's sovereignty. They refuse to do so, prompting Ben and Adams to travel instead to France and appeal to them for aid. Ben spends the next nine years in France, working hard to build an alliance. Thanks to the rebellious aid of the Marquis de Lafayette, Ben is able to establish the alliance and secure funding for his fledgling nation.\n\nDespite being separated by his young apprentices by an ocean, Ben regularly writes to them, encouraging them and reminding them how proud he is of their work. When he finally returns to Philadelphia, his reunion with his charges is a joyous one. He brings along with him Sarah's mother, Lady Phillips.\n\nAfter the war, Ben sets to helping the Continental Congress hammer out a new government. When it's decided that the Articles of Confederation are no longer working to keep order in and between the states, Ben asks George Washington to preside over a convention for establishing a new constitution. Ben participates in the Constitutional Convention, but becomes increasingly frustrated with the constant lack of agreement and childish name calling happening. While not shown in the series, he eventually calls the convention to a two day prayer recess, the first thing they all agree on. Afterward, Ben is temporarily sidelined by a flare up of his gallbladder, which is riddled with gallstones. Sarah tends to him during his illness. After a conversation with her about how his bifocals work, Ben is inspired with a solution to one of the most pervasive issues of the convention: How each state should be represented in Congress. Determined to get back to the convention, he hires some men to carry him in a sedan chair into Independence Hall, where he lays out his idea for the upper house (the Senate) to be composed of two representatives from each state, while the lower house (the House of Representatives) will consist of a number of representatives based on each state's population. The plan is accepted and marks a breakthrough in the convention. Unfortunately, and to Ben's chagrin, the issue of slavery is not only not addressed in the new Constitution, but the convention decides to put a halt on all discussions of the issue at a federal level until 1808. Ben breaks this news to Moses with an apology.\n\nDespite the setbacks and imperfections, the US Constitution is finished and signed on September 17, 1787. Two years later, George Washington is sworn in as the first president of the United States. Ben attends the inauguration along with Moses, James and Sarah. He reminds them that the Constitution doesn't guarantee happiness, but only the freedom to pursue it. They have to catch up to it themselves.\n\nThe series ends before Ben passes away the following year.\n\nGallery[]\n\nFor more images, see Benjamin Franklin/Gallery\n\nTrivia[]\n\nBenjamin Franklin is voiced by the late Walter Cronkite (1916-2009) in the TV series, but in the PC game, he is voiced by Terry McGovern.\n\nSome of Benjamin Franklin's family appears in the \"In Praise of Ben\", like his older brother, James, and Father, Josiah Franklin. However, none of the family members that he had in his life at the time of the Revolution appear. Sally and her children are never mentioned, and there is no sign whatsoever of Temple, who was around the main protagonists' age and was glued to his grandfather's side throughout his service to America, save for Benjamin West's unfinished painting of the signing of the peace treaty between America, Britain and France.\n\nFranklin is known as the First American.\n\nHe has many firsts to his name, including the first storm chaser. He primarily chased lightning, but is also known to have chased wind events such as tornadoes. He did this all on horseback.\n\nHe was a Freemason, as were many of the founding fathers.\n\nHe was left handed. Though this is rarely portrayed in media. He is animated using his right hand in the series and is played by a right handed actor in Apple TV+'s series Franklin.\n\nMusic\n\nBenjamin Franklins keys is yellow Episodes 1-50"
