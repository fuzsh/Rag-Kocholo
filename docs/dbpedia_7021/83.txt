Benjamin Franklin FRS FRSA FRSE (January 17, 1706 [O.S. January 6, 1705] â€“ April 17, 1790) was an American polymath who was active as a writer, scientist, inventor, statesman, diplomat, printer, publisher and political philosopher. Among the leading intellectuals of his time, Franklin was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States and the first United States Postmaster General. As a scientist, he was a major figure in the American Enlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity. As an inventor, he is known for the lightning rod, bifocals, and the Franklin stove, among other inventions.

His life and legacy of scientific and political achievement, and his status as one of America's most influential Founding Fathers, have seen Franklin honored more than two centuries after his death on the fifty-cent piece, the $100 bill, warships, and the names of many towns, counties, educational institutions, and corporations, as well as numerous cultural references and with a portrait in the Oval Office.

It is possible that Mary Shelley had Franklin in mind when creating the Frankenstein family for Frankenstein or the Modern Prometheus. The name Frankenstein suggests Franklin. Alphonse Frankenstein is said to have perform an electricity experiment with a kite, which is a famous Franklin-related image.
