        "text": "A couple of emails about the Gillette murder case today and a discussion with my wife got me thinking about Dreiser and his novels.\n\nThe chief influence on Dreiser the novelist — at the outset — was Balzac, not Zola. The influence of novels like The Wild Ass’s Skin and Père Goriot was immense.\n\nIt has been long known that Sister Carrie was Dreiser’s reworking of true story involving his sister Emma and Lorenzo A. Hopkins, the prototype of George Hurstwood.\n\nThe story was not an obscure one. Hopkins’s theft from his employer Chapin & Gore (not Fitzgerald and Moy’s, as most people who get their facts from Dreiser’s novel assume) was headline news at the time.\n\nIt will probably sound as if I am showing off, but it is apparent to me how often it’s the case that literary scholars and biographers never go much deeper than the author’s works and published information — i.e., secondary sources — in their research; never look elsewhere for critical information.\n\nThis was the case with my discoveries about Lorenzo A. Hopkins — the real George Hurstwood. He died in Brooklyn, where he was working as a bartender. He did not go back to his wife in Chicago, as some writers have speculated. (Most biographers, to their credit, dismissed this.)\n\nHe had one daughter about whom I found some facts in census and other records, including her marriage record. Her name was Maria and she was married in 1900 at the age of 30. She would have been age 19 at the time of Hopkins’s theft.\n\nNo one ever bothered to find out what happened to the real Mrs. Hurstwood: Margaret (Menkler) Hopkins. I found two key records: her suit for divorce from Hopkins; and her subsequent marriage to Alfred D. Lutz, president of the Acme Copying Company in Chicago, in 1892.\n\nMargaret Lutz was murdered by Alfred Lutz’s brother Charles in 1900, subsequent to a dispute he had with Maragret and his brother Charles over his employment at the firm. Margaret took an active interest in the business.\n\nNone of this was known before.\n\nNo one bothered to try and find the real identity of “Don Ashley” — the lover, in Warsaw, Indiana, of Theodore Dreiser’s jilted sister Sylvia — or the death of Sylvia’s abandoned son Carl Dresser, a bellhop, in Chicago; and possible connections (in Dreiser’s mind) with the fictional Chicago bellhop Clyde Griffiths, and perhaps, in Carl’s mind (he died of asphyxiation from illuminating gas), with Hurstwood’s suicide in Sister Carrie.\n\nMarie Pergain and the toothpick incident\n\nThere is loads of information about her. She was a lounge singer and (briefly) a concert pianist; a silent movie actress; and the lover of the Hungarian pianist Ervin Nyiregyházi, whom both Deriser and Helen knew well.\n\n“Marie Pergain—possibly a fictitious name” — Swanberg\n\n“Marie Pergain, probably a pseudonym” — Lingeman\n\n“Miss Pergain’s identity has been a mystery, with many commentators on Dreiser’s Harlan experience holding that since she doesn’t seem to exist outside of that occasion, her name is probably a pseudonym. The mystery has been cleared up. …” — Donald Pizer, “John Dos Passos and Harlan: Three Variations on a Theme,” Arizona Quarterly, Spring 2015\n\n(No acknowledgment of my groundbreaking article.)\n\n“A platinum-blonde Hollywood bit player in the late 1920s who was also a serious student of the piano, Marie Pergain (1911–51) was Nyiregyházi’s mistress in Los Angeles for several years. She met Dreiser in New York in 1930 and began a relationship with him that lasted until early 1932.” — Pizer, Op. cit.\n\nPizer jauntily throws out these facts, as if they were discovered by him. He barley acknowledges his sources.\n\n— posted by Roger W Smith\n\nApril 2024\n\n*****************************************************\n\nSee:\n\nLorenzo A.

The article provides hitherto unknown details about Sylvia’s affair with Carl’s father — the pseudonymous “Don Ashley” — when Theodore Dreiser, his sister Sylvia, and other siblings were living in Warsaw, Indiana with their mother, as recounted by Dreiser, with some major modifications of facts, in his autobiographical work Dawn.\n\nI have discovered the identity of Carl’s father and confirmed details of Carl’s death. It was “known” on scant evidence that he was a suicide. It has been said, which is inaccurate, that Carl died in his teens. I have found Carl’s death record, as well as his birth record.\n\nDreiser’s sister Sylvia abandoned Carl and did not raise him; he was raised by Dreiser’s parents and also by his aunt Mame (Theodore Dreiser’s sister) and her husband. As an unwanted child, Carl had a difficult life. Many details have remained sketchy or were never investigated by Dreiser biographers; there is scant mention of Carl in Dreiser biographies.\n\nThe story of Sylvia’s affair and pregnancy, a scandal at the time, is worth investigating, since Dreiser saw it as not insignificant in his family history and as contributing to ideas about sex and morality he had as a teenager — he used it as the subject matter of two chapters in Dawn. And, the story of Carl’s birth and his short, unhappy life throws some light on characters in Dreiser’s An American Tragedy and, to a lesser extent, in his novel Jennie Gerhardt.\n\n*****************************************************\n\nTheodore Dreiser, “The Return of the Genius,” Chicago Sunday Globe.

And Carl was tragically influenced by Dreiser’s portrayal of Hurstwood’s suicide in “Sister Carrie.”\n\nNote that Carl Dresser (as detailed in my essay ) died from “Asphixiation by illuminating gas.”\n\n— posted by Roger W.
