        "text": "Exactly a century ago, four men were born who made things diff erent in America—such things as our fiction and painting and music and poetry. They were Stephen Crane, Theodore Dreiser, John Sloan and James Weldon Johnson. In 1871 Crane was born in New Jersey, Methodist minister's son; Dreiser in Indiana, a German. Catholic immigrant's son; Sloan in Pennsylvania, a failed salesman's son, and Johnson in Florida, a black headwaiter's son. They became, in a sense, the first New Yorkers.\n\nBefore they came to the city at the turn of the century, New York had had, for practical purposes, no art or literature of its own. By the time they were done—with “Sister Carrie” and “Maggie” and “The Autobiography of an Ex‐Colored Man” and the “Sloans,” as the painter's New York City pictures were long called—New York was an art city of unparalleled vitality, as subject matter and as national center. Boston belonged to the past and America was a much bigger place than New England.\n\n“I was born to be a New Yorker,” Johnson said. “If one needs neighbors; if one must be able to talk across from front porches and chat over back fences; if one is possessed by a zeal to regulate the conduct of people who are neither neighbors nor friends—he is not born for New Yorker.”\n\nThey were all from small towns, where they had played their baseball and loved their mothers; they all came on the ferry, excited, terrified, eager for the spaciousness and freedom of the big town. Crane was the first, in 1892: a romantic blaze of a boy, seeking what he called “my artistic education on the Bowery.” Crane would also be the first to leave, to run away to the wars, to the West, to England and to death at 28, a few months before Dreiser\n\nEllen Moms is the author of “Two Dreisers” and teaches English at Barnard. had so much as published his first novel.\n\nThe four years of Crane's New York life were as productive as they were disorderly. He drifted into his friends’ clubs and boardinghouses downtown; he lounged around their studios idly turning over the old illustrated magazines that artists collected. But in the Century series on Civil War battles, Crane was finding all he needed for “The Red Badge of Courage,” a product of these years along with three New York novels, some remarkable poems and, perhaps most influential of all, several dozen New York sketches: of roof gardens, restaurants, millionaires’ parlors, opium dens; bums in a blizzard, children in the slums; the crosstown cars, the dance halls, the bicycles, the prostitutes; the crowds at Coney Island, under the El, in the Tenderloin, after the matinee, on election night, in every kind of light\n\nIf any New York street was Crane's, it was 23d, where, at 143 East, he lived for a while in the old Art Students League building; he settled into a flat soon afterward at 165 West. We are remarkably familiar with the look of 165 West 23d, for John Sloan, who, by coincidence, lived there a few years after Crane, painted its roof life and everything to be seen in and from its windows. And Dreiser sketched in West 23d Street as one of the haunts of his artist hero (partly drawn after Sloan) in “The ‘Genius.”\n\nTheodore Dreiser, the worst educated and most intellectual of the four, came to New York in 1894: a gangling, ugly, nearsighted Mid westerner, unpleasantly cocky and abysmally insecure. Reassuringly, there was his brother Paul, theatrical man and songwriter (soon famous as Paul Dresser), to meet him at the ferry and tater to help him into a job on a popular music magazine. There was also sister Em (soon to be famous as Sister Carrie) to give Dreiser a room in her flat on West 15th Street, where she was living with an ex‐saloon manager and embezzler from Chicago.\n\n“The Color of a Great City” was the title Dreiser later gave to a collection of his own city sketches, many of sights that Crane had recorded and Sloan would paint. Eventually, Dreiser would five in every borough but Queens and all over the West Side of Manhattan Island. (He moved East only ‘once, all the way to East End Avenue, when having a nervous breakdown. Roughly speaking, uptown was for Dreiser's intermittent brushes with domesticity, downtown for the single life—both sections, from a literary point of view, equally productive. In 1889 he took his bride to 6 West 102d Street, a then modern (now downat‐the‐heels) flat much like the one in which Hurstwood installs Carrie on the proceeds of embezzlement; it was there Dreiser wrote “Sister\n\nIn the early 1920's he would write “An American Tragedy” largely in the then quiet, romantic streets of Greenwich Village, but the inspiration of that novel was a very different sort of urban atmosphere: “the tall wails of the commercial heart of an American city... such walls as in time may linger as a mere fable.”\n\nDreiser outlived Crane and most of the writers and artists he knew in the 1890's; he outlived his brother Paul and the Midwestern sentiment of Paul's music. But he never outlived the wonder of the fable he told: that of the small town boy and girl who come to the big city for lights and crowds and money and sex and disaster “From the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\"—the title of one of Paul Dresser's best songs. The song was written on a tinny upright piano in New York in 1897, in a rare moment of affectionate fraternal collaboration, to words by Theodore Dreiser.\n\nIt was specifically to write lyrics to music by his own composer brother (a product of the New England Conservatory) that James Weldon Johnson came to New York in 1899. “We steamed up into New York Harbour late one afternoon in spring... the buildings of the town shone out in a reflected light which gave the city an air of enchantment; and, truly, it is an enchanted spot... the crowds, the lights, the excitement, the gaiety.... My blood ran quicker and I felt that I was just beginning to live.”\n\nJohnson was the best educated, the cool man of the four, and he took New York's intoxication in measured doses. In the early years he would come only for the summer, returning the rest of the year to the sober and dignified responsibilities of his life in Jacksonville. There he was the university graduate, the newspaper publisher, the high‐school principal, the occasionally practicing lawyer (the first Negro admitted to practice by the Florida bar). Johnson had relatives in Brooklyn among the old, genteel Negro families (a world from which he would later take a wife) but the part of New York that put intoxication in his blood was centered on West 53d Street, where a more raffish, more Bohemian black society was spreading out into hotels, clubs and res\n\nThe sporting men were there, the gambling men, the theatrical people, the poets and the composers—Johnson's set—who were injecting their own kind of intoxication into New York's blood with the new music: ragtime first, in the late nineties, soon after the blues, then jazz. This was the music that made obsolete the sob ballads Paul Dresser wrote.\n\nThe last to ride the New York ferry, which he loved to paint, was John Sloan. He came to the big city in 1904 to join Robert Henri, Everett Shinn, William Glackens, George Luks and the rest of “The 8,” the group sometimes labeled the Metropolitan Realists or Ashcan School. A gentle, warm, loyal, diffident man, Sloan came slowly to New York and gave his heart to what he called “this great life full city” with grave but absolute deliberation. In dozens of prints and paintings, Sloan recorded the New York streets just as he described them in his diary: as “drab, shabby, happy, sad and\n\nBecause his subject and approach were so similar to that of young Crane and Dreiser, Sloan in later life would often be asked about his relationship to the literary metropolitan realists. It made him mad. He claimed, probably mistakenly, never to have read Crane's work in the nineties*; and Dreiser came round to Sloan's studio only In 1915 (having known Glackens and Shinn better, years before) when publishing “The ‘Genius.’ “ Sloan, like the others, distrusted labels and traditions and organizations. The closest he came to formulating the doctrine of his generation was “we loved life and people and tried to that love of life.”\n\nThe four men of 1871 did not come to New York to join a movement or court an elite or enter an established society: New York was nothing like London or Paris—or Boston. They came instead to do the piece work of the arts in the marketplace for talent. It was not jobs that the city offered or the young men wanted, but assignments: newspaper and magazine assignments for Crane and Dreiser, illustrating assignments for Sloan, songwriting assignments for John\n\nThe New York marketplace underwent an extraordinary expansion at the turn of the century, for a variety of reasons: the passage of the International Copyright Law, which made it necessary to pay Amer ican rather than rob English authors; the immigrant influx and resulting newspaper circulation war, which put sensation and illustration at a premium; the magazine price war, which broke the hold of the New England publishing establishment and spawned a variety of interesting periodicals at 10 cents rather than 35 cents a copy; and the American flare for commercial organization and marketing, which made music publishing an industry, located on the mythical but mighty New York street called Tin Pan Alley.\n\nNew York was giving birth to modern mass culture in an atmosphere friendly as well to art. The comic strip was born in the nineties, and painters drew them; the serious magazine article was born, and novelists wrote them; the musical comedy was born, and poets had a hand in them.\n\nNew York was then a great crowd scene, and the young men came to merge themselves with the crowd, not to look down upon it—for true culture was, as Crane put it, “a comprehension of the man at one's shoulder.” That was perhaps why they all loved the blurry atmospheric effects of turn‐ofthe‐century New York: the gaslight, the shadows of the El, the thick of blizzard, fog or dust‐storm. They also liked seeing their sketches of the city crowds return to the streets a few days later, in newspapers and cheap magazines; or hearing their songs sung on street corners and played for dancing children on street pianos.\n\nTheir life in New York was cheap and comfortable. There seem to have been plenty of flats at low rents in the downtown streets they loved. They rode the El and the horse cars and ferries for pennies, or walked city miles for nothing. What walkers they all were, in the days before the automobile spoiled the look of the streets for Sloan!\n\nContrasts between rich and poor (or black and white) were part of the intoxicating flavor of city life, for the New York rich were then very rich and new and vulgar, with their diamond stickpins and feather boas — a spectacle of what Veblen in the 1890's called\n\n“conspicuous consumption.” Only later did Dreiser, Johnson and Sloan lose their naive delight in the class spectacle and move bitterly toward radical protest—Sloan to socialism and The Masses, Dreiser as far as the Communist party, Johnson to the N.A.A.C.P. and the anti‐lynching crusade. But at the turn of the century they could enjoy the fact that, while a rich man's dinner at Sherry's cost a small fortune (more than it does at a comparable res taurant today), there were plenty of cheerful New York places, like Sloan's favorite 23d Street restaurant, where ordinary men could dine out regularly for 25 cents.\n\nEveryone seemed to have access to free theater tickets in the days when there were laughter and melody at the theater. Crane could join the Lantern Club, and Dreiser the Salmagundi. Johnson and his musical collaborators could expand into a suite at the Marshall, and Sloan could afford even to buy his friends’ paintings, though he never sold one of his own oils until the Armory Show of 1913.\n\nThe Armory Show, which Sloan helped organize, became the meeting place of modem American and modern European painting—and it gave Sloan a whole new style on which to work in the remaining 40‐odd years of his life. Johnson lived to salute the first jazz concert at Carnegie Hall in 1912, and what he called (in “Black Manhattan”) the “conquest” of Harlem as world capital of Negro wealth and talent. Dreiser saw the literary explosion of the 1920's, and the publication of “In Our Time” and “The Great Gatsby” in the same year as his own “American Tragedy.”\n\nAll these events were celebrations of the coming of age of the generation of 1871. But perhaps the best birthday card of all might be that page of “Sweeney Agonistes” where T. S. Eliot, all unknowing, memorialized the work of the novelist, educator, diplomat and poet, James Weldon Johnson. For its American rhythm, its folk spirit, its wacky and lively sophistication, Eliot reworked for quotation one of the lyrics that Johnson came to New York to write:\n\nUnder the bamboo bamboo bamboo Under. the bamboo tree Two live as one One live as two Two live as three Under the barn Under the boo Under the bamboo tree.\n\n“Four in New York,” a centennial exhibit, will be on view in Butler Library at Columbia University from June to October, featuring Dreiser and Crane manuscripts and first editions from the Library's collections. Also on Morningside Heights, the Center for the Culture of Cities and the Library of Barnard College are planning for the fall a centennial showing of words, tunes and pictures with special emphasis on the New York years of Johnson and Sloan."
