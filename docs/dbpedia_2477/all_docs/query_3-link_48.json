        "text": "This is one of three Dresser’s Legacy pieces I created for Indiana’s Bicentennial which later received an Honorable Mention in the TREES Inc. Bicentennial Trees photography contest.\n\nDescription: Sycamore tree in fall framed by the sculpture “A Song For Indiana” by Terre Haute artist Teresa Clark located near the Paul Dresser Home in Fairbanks Park along the banks of the Wabash River, framed by Dresser’s sheet music that later became the Indiana State Song.\n\nIt is on display through Jan. 2 in Swope Art Museum Education Center as part of River City Art Association’s “Pearls of the Wabash” companion exhibit to a Smithsonian Institute Water/Ways exhibition in West Terre Haute, made possible by Indiana Humanities and hosted by RiverSCAPE in Terre Haute. After Jan. 2, it will be in the personal art collection of a Terre Haute resident.\n\nThe RCAA/Swope exhibit opened Nov. 20 and runs through Jan. 2. Of the 43 pieces by 16 RCAA artists I also have on display my Rivière Haute, a photograph I made in April 2013 of the flood in Fairbanks Park in Terre Haute where the Wabash River crested at 27 feet. Rivière Haute was later juried into the 2013 TREES Inc. “Trees and The River” photography contest exhibit in the Vigo County Public Library.\n\nAlso purchased in RCAA’s Pearls of the Wabash exhibit is the Dresser’s Legacy set titled My Indiana Home and Banks of the Wabash, Far Away that I created for Indiana’s Bicentennial. Also framed by the sculpture “A Song For Indiana” by Terre Haute artist Teresa Clark located near the Paul Dresser Home in Fairbanks Park along the banks of the Wabash River, framed by Dresser’s sheet music that later became the Indiana State Song.\n\nA second RCAA reception for “Pearls of the Wabash” will take place 6 to 8 p.m. Dec. 3 in the same Swope location during the Miracle on 7th Street event in downtown Terre Haute. A meet and greet with some of the artists will be Noon to 6 p.m. Dec. 4.\n\nThere you can also view my photography-based abstract “Wetland: “Flood of Emotions” on textured metal, floated off etched aluminum background."
