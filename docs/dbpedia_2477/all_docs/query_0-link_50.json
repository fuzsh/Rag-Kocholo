        "text": "Theodore Dreiser’s biography of his songwriting brother, Paul Dresser, parades a number of popular tunes of the 1890s #- several with specially-staged production numbers – to round out a fairly entertaining piece of filmusical entertainment.\n\nDresser’s life is far from sugar-coated in its cinematic unreeling. Young Paul (Victor Mature) is picked up as the youth who runs away from home to pursue a musical career rather than study for the ministry. After a short stretch as entertainer with a cheap medicine show, and an intimate association with Carole Landis, he finally tosses over the small time for a whirl at the big town of New York.\n\nThere’s too much footage consumed in unnecessary episodes and incidents that might have been historically correct for the times, but not important to a straight line presentation of a musical drama.\n\nAlthough Mature gives a solid performance as the songwriter, it’s Rita Hayworth who catches major attention from her first entrance.\n\n1942: Best Color Art Direction.\n\nNomination: Best Scoring of a Musical Picture"
