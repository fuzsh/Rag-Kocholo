        "text": "FLINT – Other coaches might have recorded more victories or won more championships.\n\nBut few if any in Flint-area history were more synonymous with their sport than Paul Dresser.\n\nThe former Carman-Ainsworth soccer coach was a true pioneer, forming the first soccer program in the Flint area back in 1972 and spending 35 years coaching both the boys and girls.\n\nHe knew everybody on the local soccer scene – heck, in other sports too, for that matter – and Dresser was one of those people who nobody ever seemed to say a bad word about.\n\nDresser is being remembered fondly after dying Wednesday of an apparent heart attack at age 75.\n\n“The best way I would describe him is he was one of the kindest people you’d ever know,” said Kevin Fiebernitz, who coached against Dresser at Powers Catholic and Linden. “Just an all-around phenomenal guy. It’s sad to hear of his passing. My phone started bowing up early in the morning from his former players.\n\n“He just always had such a positive outlook on everything. He was one of those guys that if you played for him, you loved him. In all those years I coached against him, I don’t remember him yelling at anyone or getting upset.\n\n“Anyone that you ever come across that met Paul, his former players – my brothers-in-law were former players of Paul’s – they just have the utmost respect for him.”\n\nDresser was born in Wheaton, Ill., where one of his high school classmates was John Belushi.\n\nHe played soccer at Greenville University in Illinois and moved to Michigan to obtain his Masters degree at Eastern Michigan before he and wife Ruth – everybody calls her “Doc” because her maiden name was Holliday – settled in Flint in 1969.\n\nIn 1972, Dresser formed a club soccer team at Carman High School and the soccer became a varsity boys sport in 1975. Girls varsity soccer was added in 1985 and Dresser coached both teams until retiring in 2007.\n\nUnder Dresser, the boys team had a record of 407-184-59 (.672) while the girls compiled a record of 241-176-38 (.571). In all, he coached 1,127 games at Carman and Carman-Ainsworth while serving as a physical education instructor at Dye Elementary and Carman-Ainsworth Middle School. He was also a driver’s education instructor in the Carman-Ainsworth district.\n\nThe highlight of Dresser’s coaching career came in 1980, when he led Carman to a state championship.\n\nOf the thousands of players who suited up for Dresser’s teams, many went on to play both collegiately and professionally. When he retired, two of his former players – Jay Witham and Jessyca Mathews – took over coaching the boys and girls teams, respectively.\n\n“He was a great guy,” said Witham, who is still the boys coach at Carman-Ainsworth. “Like all the Facebook posts say, just a wonderful human being. Down to earth. He made it fun for us, coaching wise. We just enjoyed the game.\n\n“He loved the game.”\n\nAfter retiring, Dresser would often show up at Cavaliers’ practices or to watch former players like Witham in 30-and-over games. Just last week, he dropped in on a Carman-Ainsworth summer practice while Witham was out of town.\n\n“He’d sit on the sideline with us,” said Witham, a former center mid-fielder for the Cavaliers who graduated in 2003. “Some of the drills that he had done back when I was playing I still incorporate” into practices.\n\nPaul and Mac have two children, Jennifer and Jeff. Jennifer, 51, is a nuclear medicine technician near Kanas City and Jeff, 47, sells commercial lighting in North Carolina.\n\nJennifer doesn’t like to share her profession with many people because she said they’d give her some strange looks when they hear that technical term but her dad was certainly proud of what she does for a living. “He would tell a lot of people,” she said with a laugh.\n\nJeff followed his dad into the coaching ranks after playing at Flint Southwestern Academy – where he set a city single-season record with 33 goals – before spending nine years playing professional soccer in North Carolina and Indianapolis.\n\nHe coached his high school team to a North Carolina state championship last year – 40 years after his dad won a state title at Carman – and would speak with his dad daily.\n\nJeff said his father knew all of the players on his team and would often compare them to players he coached in Flint. Paul and Doc would travel to North Carolina every year to watch a couple of games and Jeff would often ask his dad to address the team before games.\n\n“He loved the game and he loved to coach,” Jeff said. “He loved the kids and he loved to see their success.”\n\nDresser became so well-connected around the Flint area that he usually couldn’t go out with running into people who knew him. In fact, Jeff said when the family leave the state to go on vacation in places like Florida, Tennessee or northern Michigan, it wasn’t uncommon for his dad to run into people he knew.\n\nSo it’s no surprise Dresser has received such affection from friends, players and acquaintances since his death.\n\n“Absolutely unbelievable,” Doc said. “We never went anywhere that he didn’t know somebody. Never. The illustration I just gave to the funeral director was that our grandkids are not used to being in this area, being from other states.\n\n“We were on the porch ready to go away somewhere and the Fed Ex guy drove by and says ‘Hi Paul!’ and they’re like ‘The Fed Ex guy knows him?’ Everywhere we went.”\n\nIn addition to Doc, Jennifer and Jeff, Dresser is survived by son-in-law Chad Doane, daughter-in-law Stephanie Dresser and four grandchildren – Emma Doane, Connor Doane, Jackson Dresser and Dylan Dresser.\n\nJackson is keeping the family’s soccer tradition alive as a college player.\n\nA memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. Tuesday, July 27 at Central Church of the Nazarene 1261 W Bristol Rd, Flint. It’s open to anyone who wants to pay their respects or share some memories of Dresser.\n\nAmong the speakers will be Scott Kronick, one of the captains on Dresser’s 1980 state championship team. Kronick was among the players who inspired Jeff Dresser back when he was a Carman ball boy as a kid.\n\nKronick is a perfect example of how Dresser’s former players feel about him.\n\n“This is a special story,” Jeff Dresser said. “He invited my dad last February before COVID to go over to Europe and they watched three English Premier League games. He basically flew him out and they watched the games.\n\n“That’s such a special memory for my dad, just to see his excitement.”\n\nThe soccer field at Carman-Ainsworth is named in Dresser’s honor."
