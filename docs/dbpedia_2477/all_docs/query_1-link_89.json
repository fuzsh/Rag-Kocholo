        "text": "addresses of the Dreiser family\n\nI have a note in my Dreiser files: “summer 1884 / TD’s mother moves family to apt found by Theresa in Chicago at West Madison and Throop St.”\n\nI do not recall the exact source of this information.\n\nThis note promoted me to review what is known — as far as I can determine — about the movements of Dreiser’s family.\n\nI spent a lot of time some time ago in the New York Public Library poring through Chicago city directories on microfilm. City directories are a valuable resource for genealogists. And, Tamie Dehler, who has written genealogical articles about Terre Haute and the Dreiser family, shared valuable information from local city directories with me.\n\nSee the attached Word document (above).\n\n— posted by Roger W. Smith\n\nMarch 2022\n\naddendum – ‘Dreiser’s nephew Carl’\n\nI have updated my post “Dreiser’s Nephew Carl” again.\n\nRoger W. Smith, “Dreiser’s Nephew Carl”\n\nThe post is mostly in the format of downloadable Word document.\n\nThe reason for the update is that I have obtained a valuable piece of evidence: a chapter from the second typescript of Dreiser’s Dawn (at the Lilly Library) which was not available to me until now because of the library being closed during the pandemic.\n\nThe only addition to my essay is the Addendum at the end. I have posted the Addendum here as a downloadable World document (above).\n\n— Roger W. Smith\n\nAugust 2020\n\n‘Dreiser’s nephew Carl’\n\nThis post is in the form of a downloadable Word document (above).\n\ntranscript of Carl Dresser birth record\n\n*****************************************************\n\nAbstract\n\nThis article focuses on Theodore Dreiser’s nephew Carl Dresser, who was born out of wedlock in 1886 to Dreiser’s sister Cacilia (Sylvia) Dreiser. The article provides hitherto unknown details about Sylvia’s affair with Carl’s father — the pseudonymous “Don Ashley” — when Theodore Dreiser, his sister Sylvia, and other siblings were living in Warsaw, Indiana with their mother, as recounted by Dreiser, with some major modifications of facts, in his autobiographical work Dawn.\n\nI have discovered the identity of Carl’s father and confirmed details of Carl’s death. It was “known” on scant evidence that he was a suicide. It has been said, which is inaccurate, that Carl died in his teens. I have found Carl’s death record, as well as his birth record.\n\nDreiser’s sister Sylvia abandoned Carl and did not raise him; he was raised by Dreiser’s parents and also by his aunt Mame (Theodore Dreiser’s sister) and her husband. As an unwanted child, Carl had a difficult life. Many details have remained sketchy or were never investigated by Dreiser biographers; there is scant mention of Carl in Dreiser biographies.\n\nThe story of Sylvia’s affair and pregnancy, a scandal at the time, is worth investigating, since Dreiser saw it as not insignificant in his family history and as contributing to ideas about sex and morality he had as a teenager — he used it as the subject matter of two chapters in Dawn. And, the story of Carl’s birth and his short, unhappy life throws some light on characters in Dreiser’s An American Tragedy and, to a lesser extent, in his novel Jennie Gerhardt.\n\n*****************************************************\n\nTheodore Dreiser, “The Return of the Genius,” Chicago Sunday Globe. October 23, 1892 (under byline Carl Dreiser)\n\nTheodore Dreiser, ‘The Return of the Genius.’\n\n*****************************************************\n\n*****************************************************\n\nAddendum, August 16, 2020:\n\nI received an email from Professor Emeritus Thomas Kranidas today which called my attention to something I had overlooked (italics): “Dreiser was surely influenced by memory of Carl’s bellhop days. And Carl was tragically influenced by Dreiser’s portrayal of Hurstwood’s suicide in “Sister Carrie.”\n\nNote that Carl Dresser (as detailed in my essay ) died from “Asphixiation by illuminating gas.”\n\n— posted by Roger W. Smith\n\nMay 2020; updated August 2020\n\nCarl Dresser death certificate\n\nPosted here (above) is the death certificate for Theodore Dreiser’s nephew Carl Dresser.\n\nCarl Dresser was the illegitimate son of Dreiser’s sister Cacilia (Sylvia).\n\nCarl Dresser … certificate of death #14567 … Department of Health, Chicago … date of birth, unknown … age, 26 years … date of death, March 29, 1915 … occupation, Bellboy … buried Elmwood [Cemetery], March 31, 1915 … evidence obtained at inquest … Cause of death – Asphyxiation by illuminating gas (suicide) … address, 53 W Erie St. …. length of time living in city – 4 years … name of father – unknown … name of mother – unknown. [Elmwood Cemetery is located in River Grove, IL; the village of River Grove is located about 15 miles from Chicago]\n\nNote the cause of death, suicide, and Carl’s occupation, bellboy.\n\nCarl Dresser gets scant mention by Dreiser biographers. In an entry for Cacilia (Sylvia) Dreiser in A Theodore Dreiser Encyclopedia, her illegitimate son Carl is said to have been born on October 16, 1886. This is accurate. In a letter to Theodore Dreiser dated October 16, 1908, Carl stated, “I am twenty two years old to day.” This would mean that the age of death shown on the death certificate is not accurate. It should have been 28 years.\n\nCarl was raised by various Dreiser family members and had contact with his uncle Theodore over the years, as is indicated by the correspondence posted as a PDF file below. He lived for a period of time with Dreiser’s’ sister Mame (Carl’s aunt) and his maternal grandfather Johann Paul Dreiser in upstate New York.\n\nHere’s a question which intrigues me. Book One of Dreiser’s An American Tragedy is all about Clyde Griffith’s life prior to his moving to Lycurgus to work in his uncle’s collar factory. This part of the novel is all invented; it does not correspond to the life of the actual murderer Chester Gillette, who was the prototype of Clyde Griffiths. Has anyone noticed that when Clyde meets his uncle Samuel Griffiths he is BELLHOP working in a HOTEL in CHICAGO? Could Dreiser have had his nephew Carl in mind when he was writing parts of this part of the novel?\n\nCarl Dresser – correspondence with Theodore Drieser\n\n— posted by Roger W. Smith\n\nOctober 2017\n\nthe-life-story-of-harold-james-dies-excerpts\n\nPosted here as a downloadable PDF document are excerpts from the autobiography of Harold James Dies (1914-2012). Mr. Dies was related, on his mother’s side, to Theodore Dreiser’s second wife, Helen (Patges) (Richardson) Dreiser. He was Trustee of the Dreiser Trust.\n\nThe full title of the autobiography is “The Kingdom of God and the World’s Final Generation: The Life Story of Harold James Dies” (2010).\n\nIncluded in the autobiography is anecdotal material related to Theodore Dreiser and his second wife Helen, as well as some information about Dreiser’s niece Gertrude Amelia Hopkins (1894-1963) that is not available elsewhere. Topics of interest discussed in the autobiography, and included in the excerpts posted below, include:\n\nMr. Dies’s relationship with Dreiser’s second wife Helen, whom he knew from his early years, and biographical information about her\n\nhis meeting Dreiser and some anecdotal material about Dreiser\n\nmention of his cousin congressman Martin Dies, chairman of the House un-American Activities Committee\n\nhis relationship with Gertrude Amelia Hopkins, Dreiser’s favorite niece and the daughter of Dreiser’s sister Emma (“Sister Carrie”)\n\nnegotiations over the production of Tobias Picker’s opera “An American Tragedy”\n\nI wish to thank Joann Crouch, Mr. Dies’s niece, who told me about this unique book and made it available to me for photocopying.\n\n— Roger W. Smith\n\nFebruary 2017\n\nSee commentary below.\n\nThis photograph of Gertrude Amelia Hopkins (1894-1973), Theodore Dreiser’s favorite niece, is, as far as I know, unique. It is the best photo of Gertrude that I have ever seen.\n\nI am grateful to Mrs. Gloria N. Vevante, Gertrude’s niece, for giving me this photo.\n\nGertrude Amelia Hopkins was the daughter of Theodore Dreiser’s sister, Emma (Dreiser) Nelson (1863-1936). Emma (Dreiser) Nelson was the real life prototype of the lead character, Carrie Meeber, in Theodore Dreiser’s first novel, Sister Carrie.\n\n— Roger W. Smith\n\nDecember 2016\n\n***************************************************\n\nemail to a Dreiserian from Roger W. Smith, January 15, 2017\n\nAttached is a gorgeous photo of Gertrude Amelia Hopkins (1894-1973), who was TD’s favorite niece.\n\nThe photo was given to me by Mrs. Gloria Vevante.\n\nMrs. Vevante was born Gloria Nelson. She was Gertrude’s niece. Her (Mrs. Vevante’s) father was George Nelson.\n\nGeorge Kates Nelson (1892-1955) was the son of Emma and Hopkins. He took the name of his stepfather, John Nelson.\n\nGeorge was a hotel manager in Manhattan for most of his professional life. He married a woman, Gunda Ryerson, who had emigrated when young from Norway. For many years, his family lived in Manhattan.\n\nGeorge had nothing to do with TD and did not seem to have been intimate with his mother, Emma, as an adult. He was apparently somewhat of a wild kid who straightened out as he matured. He knew Paul Dresser and as an adolescent would spend time with him.\n\nHis first name, George, is possibly significant, since Hurstwood’s first name is George and he has a son named George, Jr.\n\nGertrude alternatively used the names Gertrude Hopkins and Gertrude Nelson when she was young. She aspired to be singer when young. She was close to Emma. She ended up working for Con Edison in Westchester County. She married a coworker, Emil Dorn, and became Gertrude Hopkins Dorn. But, she found out — much later (I believe it was after Dorn’s death) — that Mr. Dorn was already married (when he married Gertrude) to a wife who had been found mentally incompetent and was confined to a hospital. Gertrude went back to being Gertrude Hopkins.\n\nGertrude died in Westchester in 1973.\n\nHer letters to TD are touching.\n\nHarold J. Dies (1914-2012), a descendant of Dreiser’s aunt who was Trustee of the Dreiser Estate (he was a cousin of Dreiser’s second wife, Helen Patges Dreiser), knew Gertrude well and played a major role in administering her estate. It is clear that he was fond of her. Tedi Dreiser Goddard and her mother, Dr. Vera Dreiser, knew Gertrude but didn’t seem to give her the time of day or think that much of her. Helen knew Gertrude and liked her. And, at an early age, at least, Gertrude used to correspond with Jug."
