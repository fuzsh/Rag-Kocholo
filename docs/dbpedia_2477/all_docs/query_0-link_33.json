        "text": "\"I don’t think you can form a fictional character and then determine where to put him or her down, like those Instagram photos where people hold up the same stuffed monkey in front of the Eiffel Tower, Big Ben, the Taj Mahal, etc. For me, landscape is character and—more importantly, perhaps—character is landscape. Brooklyn through Charming Billy’s eyes, experiences, and personality is not Brooklyn through Marie’s in Someone’s, or the nuns’ in The Ninth Hour.\"\"\n\nAt first glance, there are no strong parallels between Weldon Kees and the poet Donika Kelly, except perhaps that their last names both start with “Ke” and that I admire their work. Kelly, who writes sixty years after Kees’s death, is necessarily a different kind of poet, but in her first collection, Bestiary, she also negotiates difficulties of the self. The collection includes a series of “self-portraits” in which, rather than adopting a named persona, Kelly tries on certain skins. In one poem she’s a chimera, in another she’s a werewolf.\n\nWhen he first arrived in Sewanee, Tennessee, in 1888, Professor William Peterfield Trent saw an opportunity to shape the intellectual destiny of the South. Just thirty years old, he had recently finished his historical training at Johns Hopkins and accepted a job at the University of the South over a higher-paid position at the University of Georgia. Sewanee, Trent hoped, would provide the foundation to invigorate the region’s literary and intellectual culture. Over the next few years, Trent did just that.\n\nDiscussing the challenges of evaluating one’s own work—of developing what Hemingway called a “bullshit detector”—the writer Steve Almond stresses that writers need to protect “the improvisatory momentum upon which all narrative construction depends” while also acting as a disinterested judge of their own decisions. The issue, as I see it, is control. Dr. Prunty and I had been reading some of Peter Taylor’s stories the previous semester, and he advised me to look back at those to see what he meant.\n\nIn his essay “The Curses,” published in two parts in SR’s Winter and Spring 2017 issues, John Jeremiah Sullivan uncovered the history of what may be, by at least one definition, the first blues song ever written, an 1887 sheet-music hit titled “The Curse.” The song’s composer, Paul Dresser, has long been considered one of the nineteenth century’s greatest songwriters.\n\nPaul Dresser’s “My Gal Sal” was written as a fond reflection on one of the great loves in that songwriter’s life, his multiple-year affair with an Evansville madam called Sal Davis, real name, as research has recently shown: Annie Swanner. We know about her mainly through scattered writings left by Dresser’s now-more-famous younger brother, Theodore Dreiser. She helped keep the Dreiser family alive at one point in the 1870s, when they were at their poorest.\n\nAnyone interested in higher education is aware that it is in trouble. For years public universities (which enroll the large majority of American students) have been systematically deprived of adequate public support, requiring them to rely ever more on students and their parents for the costs of education. The same legislators then criticize them for rising tuition and the burden of student debt.\n\n\"My favorite review ever . . . said: 'This book would have been better if it was longer and more interesting.' I tried to get them to put that on the back of Dept. in the 'Previous praise for Jenny Offill' section, but wiser heads prevailed.\"\n\n\"I was about halfway through the Seven Summits when someone suggested that I write a book—they called it an “inspirational book.” And I said, “Okay, that sounds good. I’m twenty-five years old. I’ll write an inspirational book.” But that word—inspirational—is a difficult one. I realized that inspirational as a concept is a double-edged sword.\"\""
