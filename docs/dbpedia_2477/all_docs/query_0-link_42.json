        "text": "Cinematic Time Capsule\n\n1942 Marathon - Film #31\n\n‚ÄùSomeday I‚Äôll write a song‚Ä¶ and she‚Äôll come begging to sing it‚Äù\n\nRita Hayworth and Victor Mature star in this HIGHLY fictionalized account of songwriter Paul Dresser‚Äôs rise to fame during the gay nineties-era of showbiz.\n\nAnd you know those movies where someone‚Äôs onstage singing and dancing their heart out, and when they finish there‚Äôs just dead silence? That‚Äôs exactly what my house was like right after this dud of a musical ended‚Ä¶ ü¶óü¶óü¶ó\n\nI dunno why exactly, but it simply did nothing for me. I mean to be fair, the singing and dancing were okay, but frankly, the story and main characters just kinda annoyed me. ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø\n\n‚ÄùWell, do we drink to something‚Ä¶ or do we just drink?‚Äù\n\nCinematic Time Capsule - 1942 Ranked\n\nRita Hayworth was great and the whole 'gay nineties' theme has it's weird appeal. Fun movie, for sure, but a little lacking in something magical to lift it above the usual musical affair Hollywood poured out. The biggest surprise was how well Victor Mature took to the role. Not exactly a guy known for his musical roots, he got out of this with his respect in-tact.\n\nRita, mom, I‚Äôm sorry that Harry Cohn did this to you. A Fox Musical! It‚Äôs so rough.\n\nThis was a bad movie. I have a lot of reasons about why it sucked, but if you‚Äôre thinking ‚Äúoh at least Rita dances in it! how bad could it be?‚Äù She barely dances.\n\nThere are a lot of *dance numbers* but they are all on a very very narrow stage, which really cramps the choreography. And Rita‚Äôs whole dancing thing is her chemistry with partners and the plot of this movie really underserves this because the romantic lead doesn‚Äôt dance at all!\n\nJust watch You Were Never Lovlier instead.\n\nOne good thing that came out of this movie: Rita Haywoth had an affair with the lead in it, which led to her leaving her TERRIBLE first husband.\n\nalso: the costumes were good. but show me a movie set in the 1890s where the costumes were bad."
