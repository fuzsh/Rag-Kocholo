        "text": "I started school at THE TEMPLE Annapolis: A Paul Mitchell Partner School on August 12, 2016. Going to beauty school was always something that felt so out of reach for someone like me. So, I was nervous and excited and maybe a little bit scared for what I had gotten myself into. I’ll admit there were so many times over the period of CORE that I doubted I made the right decision to start over and come to cosmetology school. I made the commitment to it though, and I continued showing up.\n\nJust when I finally thought I was ready to throw in the towel, and amazing shift in my perspective happened. I told myself that if I am going to do this, I’m going to do the best I can to be great at it because I DESERVE TO BE GREAT. I took on every opportunity presented to me and payed attention to everything I was learning- in and out of the classroom during my time at THE TEMPLE. The level of determination and hunger for success made me work so much harder. I was quickly moved into the Phase 2 Honors Program. I made it a goal to complete all nine of my clinic worksheets before I reached 1000 hours, and I was able to complete them and reach my goal. That left me with 500 hours of time in the clinic to focus on taking my education to the next level.\n\nIn the beginning of CORE I told myself I wasn’t going to do the Dean’s List or Honors packets. Honestly one look at them and I felt overwhelmed. But with my 500 hours left, I decided to challenge myself and get them done!\n\nI worked everyday on the necessary tasks, helped with fundraising and was involved in all of the Student Run Programs (Design Team, Student Council, Be Nice or Else…)\n\nThere has never been a time that I have turned down an invitation to be involved in an onsite or offsite event. I participated in four events while in school, one being “TLC’s: Say Yes to the Prom”. I have always worked hard to follow the future professional guidelines.\n\nThere has never been a more proud moment than to know I completed ALL of my requirements for both Honors and Dean’s List. I never believed I was cut out to be a hair dresser, I always doubted myself. Not any more! I know that I worked hard to be the stylist and person that I am today. No one handed me anything on this journey, it was every ounce of dedication and passion I have that made it happen. I will never stop learning, I will never stop growing and I can’t wait to find out what this industry has to offer me!"
