        "text": "The Attorney General’s Office maintains a register of all process agents and their addresses for state government departments and agencies.\n\nWhich agencies are on the list?\n\nThese process agents are representatives of individual state agencies upon whom court papers may be served. Every State agency is required to file with the Attorney General the name and address of an agent upon whom process may be served. N.C.G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4(j)(4)(b).The term “agency of the State” includes every agency, institution, board, commission, bureau, department, division, council, member of the Council of State, or officer of the State of North Carolina, but does not include counties, cities, towns, villages, other municipal corporations or political subdivisions of the State, county or city boards of education, other local public districts, units, or bodies of any kind, or private corporations created by act of the General Assembly. N.C.G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4(j)(4)(d).Although some agencies choose to list more than one service of process agent, any one of the names can be used to serve process.\n\nNo Agent Listed\n\nIf any agency of the State fails to submit a process agent, then service may be made by personally delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the Attorney General or to a deputy or assistant attorney general; by mailing a copy of the summons and of the complaint, registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the Attorney General, or to a deputy or assistant attorney general; or by depositing with a designated delivery service authorized pursuant to [26 U.S.C. § 7502(f)(2)] a copy of the summons and complaint, addressed to the Attorney General or to a deputy or assistant attorney general, delivering to the addressee, and obtaining a delivery receipt.\n\nThe Attorney General’s Office only maintains service of process agents for North Carolina state departments, agencies and boards and commissions. Corporations and business service of process agents are provided by the North Carolina Secretary of State’s office."
