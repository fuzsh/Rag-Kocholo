Zenner and Russell A. Stone This volume of critical essays is part of a series that comments on issues within Israeli culture, literature, politics, scholarship, and society. The series is sponsored by the Association for Israel Studies, which was founded in 1985 by scholars from several disciplines to provide a framework for the discussion of all aspects of Israeli society. This association was formed to provide a place where the study of Israel from widely differing perspectives could be presented. In this structure there would be room for scholars with a wide range of differing opinions, but who could agree on the importance of academic discourse. The three volumes published so far in this series reflect at least some of this divergence of opinion. Obviously the views expressed in each chapter are solely those of the author. They do not represent the outlook of the association, of SUNY Press, or of the editors. The authors in this volume were called upon to identify a series of recently published books, or one book of importance to their field of inquiry. Then, they were requested to shape a critical essay which was to be based upon consideration of the book(s), but which would reach beyond the scope of a usual book review, or even a review essay. They were to use the work(s) as an opportunity to comment upon the state 1\n\n2\n\nWalter P. Zenner and Russell A. Stone\n\nof scholarship, or the state of society in the subject area in question. The result is the collection of essays in this volume, which is divided into four sections, Literature and Language, Culture and Society, Social Analysis, and History and Politics. Many of the works are related to the essays in the earlier volumes in the series.1 I. Literature and Language The essays on literature generally follow those in earlier volumes, which related literary works to changes in national ideology and political discourse (Divine in volume 1, Katriel, Shenhar, and Jacobson in volume 2). Those essays were primarily concerned with the decay of secular Zionism, the turn away from a view of Israel as a Utopia, and the increased attraction of life abroad. In the present volume, other themes are considered. Raz shows how Israeli authors have changed their treatment of the Holocaust since the Second World War and how they have increasingly identified with the victims. This has accompanied other changes in Israeli national ideology. Zenner and Marthan deal with a single author, Amnon Shamosh. Zenner, like Raz, analyzes literary works sociologically. Both Zenner and Marthan look at Shamosh in relationship to Shamosh's search for his ethnic roots. One looks primarily at a single work by the author, while the other looks at his corpus of poetry and relates it to a more general consideration of the Sephardic tradition. Bolozky's chapter is the first essay on linguistics for this series. His essay deals with the work of Paul Wexler, who has proposed a provocative thesis that both Yiddish and modern Hebrew are intrinsically based on an extinct Slavic language, rather than classifying them in the usual manner as Germanic and Semitic languages respectively. Bolozky analyzes this thesis in a straightforward fashion on purely linguistic grounds. While the chapter may appear technical, it is not difficult to follow, especially for those who know modern Hebrew. The technical linguistic meaning of classification and affiliation is, of course, based on intra-disciplinary con-\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nsideration. Still, propositions like those of Wexler have potentially social ramifications in terms of how peoples view themselves in relationship to other nations, ethnic groups, etc. II. Culture and Society The chapters in the second section continue some of the themes discussed in the first section, since they also deal with Israeli Jewish self-image and the foundations of communal cohesion. Tress's chapter is the first one in this series dealing with the important topic of gender. In a highly critical manner it shows how the status of women in Israeli society is related to security policy. Tress's theoretical orientation is derived from current \"post-modernist\" paradigms in the social sciences, as are the authors dealt with by Armstrong. Weiker's chapter on ethnicity utilizes a more traditional social scientific orientation. His chapter reviews theories of ethnicity as they have been applied to Israel and thus continues a discussion begun by Zenner (volume 1). This chapter is particularly concerned with relationships between different Jewish origin-groups. Although class has not been at the fore of the analyses of stratification in Israel, several of the social scientists discussed by Weiker have analyzed the relations between European and Middle Eastern Jews in Israel as those between distinct classes. While this topic was foremost on the agenda of anthropologists studying Israel before 1980, it has been replaced by other interests of late. Armstrong's review of works on the \"mainstream\" gives attention to one such trend. These works deal with the manner in which political ideology and nationalism have been internalized by Jewish Israelis, particularly but not solely those of Ashkenazic background. The works in this section can be seen as reviewing how the sociology of Israel reflects general interests in race, class, and gender. III. Social Analysis The chapters by Ram and Ben-Zadok and Goldberg deal with the analyses of the Israeli polity by two political analysts.\n\n4\n\nWalter P. Zenner and Russell A. Stone\n\nOne is the sociologist, Yonathan Shapiro, who broke away from the structural-functional paradigm of Eisenstadt (discussed by Lustick in volume 1). He is considered one of the chief proponents of conflict-sociology in Israel. Yehezkel Dror has been a practitioner of social policy analysis and has served as a government advisor. His criticism comes from within the Israeli political establishment. In fact, his analyses are in the form of memoranda to the prime minister. Shapiro, unlike the historical revisionists, unequivocally accepts the legitimacy of the state and its underlying ideology. IV. History and Politics The final section is dominated by a discussion of Israeli historical revisionism which has questioned the previous dominant interpretation of Israel's conflict with the Palestinians. The former paradigm saw the Yishuv and Israel as reacting defensively against the Arabs and did not question the Zionist claims to the land. The revisionists, discussed by Slater (also see chapters by Peretz and Heydemann in previous volumes), question both premises. Levy and Peled seek to extend revisionist interpretation to the Six Day War. They also extend the discussion of Israeli sociological thought, which we find in the previous sections. Peleg deals with social psychological concomitants of the Arab-Israeli conflict. He finds this in the view of both Arabs and Israelis that their enemies are totally \"Other.\" This demonization is particularly symbolized by the Israeli identification of Palestinians with \"terrorism\" and the Arab image of Jews as \"Zionists.\" This process of stereotyping is not unidimensional and may go through various phases, as Rejwan (in volume 1) showed with regard to Arab analyses of the rise of Israel (also see Peretz in volume 1). Peleg, however, sees this demonization reaching its apex in right wing extremism within contemporary Israel. Inbar, in the final chapter in this volume, discusses the Intifada as an intercommunal struggle. He sees it as one dimension of the conflict between Israel and the Arabs. He\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\ntries to give us a balance sheet on the costs to both Israelis and Palestinians. He also gives us a sense of both divergence and convergence between Palestinian and Israeli commentators on the Intifada. Note 1. See Ian S. Lustick, ed., Books on Israel vol. 1, (Albany, N.Y.: SUNY Press, 1988); and Ian. S. Lustick and Barry Rubin, eds., Critical Essays on Israeli Society, Politics, and Culture: Books on Israel, vol. 2, (Albany, N.Y.: SUNY Press, 1991).\n\nPart I\n\nLiterature and Language\n\nRewriting the Holocaust: An Israeli Case Study in the Sociology of the Novel\n\nAviad E. Raz\n\nOmer Bartov, Border Patrol (in Hebrew) Tel Aviv: Hakibbutz Hame'uchad, 1988. Dorit Peleg, Una, (in Hebrew) Tel Aviv: Hakibbutz Hame'uchad, 1988.\n\nC^) Tn each and every generation, everyone mast see himself as if he were destroying Hitler\" —Efraim Sidon, Fighting and Killing.*\n\nwo recently published novels by young Israeli authors, Dorit Peleg's Una and Omer Bartov's Border Patrol (both published by Hakibbutz Hame'uchad, 1988), are the starting point of the following inquiry. Both contain large sections concerning the life of a Jew during the Holocaust, as seen and portrayed through the eyes of a contemporary Israeli. This portrayal makes no claim for historical accuracy, as opposed to an altogether different, and ever more frequent, literary genre of the Holocaust—the testimony— *Sidon, E. \"Fighting and Killing.\" in Fighting and Killing without End: Political Poetry in the Lebanon War, edited with an afterword by Hannan Hever and Moshe Ron, (Tel Aviv: Hakibbutz Hame'uchad 1984), p. 124.\n\n9\n\n10\n\nAviad E. Raz\n\nto be later contrasted with these novels. As such, it is portraying the contemporary Israeli rather than the Holocaust Jew. This chapter, therefore, will attempt to place these novels in their social context. The argument underpinning this task is that in the act of writing, the novelist (the playwright, the poet) is trying to \"make sense of our lives.\"1. The parallels evident in the two novels can thus be cautiously compared with, and perhaps shed light on, trends common to \"our lives\" in contemporary Israeli society. The social context in question encompasses the whole gamut of Israeli culture's complex relations to the Holocaust, and in particular to the image of the Holocaust Jew. More specifically, the novels in question can serve to illustrate the process of social construction of the image of the \"Holocaust Jew.\" I argue that the construction of such an image can be seen to alternate between two opposites: the stereotype of \"lamb to slaughter,\" on the one hand, and the \"rebel\" on the other. This alternation is much more reflective of Israeli collective identity than of historical data. The depiction of the \"Holocaust Jew\" in Israeli literature can thus represent changes in the evolving collective identity of Israeli society. The two novels in point will serve here to illustrate such a change. I. The Holocaust in Israeli Eyes: A Brief History of Ideological Typification The impact of the Holocaust on the Jewish state, from its very inception (considered internationally, though not necessarily nationally, as an aftermath of the Holocaust) to its gradual formulation of identity, cannot be overlooked. Yet this impact has received only scant and partial attention, relative to its significance, and only recently have empirical studies of psychosocial effects of the Holocaust been systematically earned out.2 Due partly to the sheer enormity of events, partly to the great proportion of Holocaust survivors in Israel (nearly one-half the population in 1948), and partly to the central negative place of the Holocaust in Zionist ide-\n\nRewriting the Holocaust\n\n11\n\nology as the ultimate consequence of Jewish vulnerability in the Diaspora, images of the Sho'ah have become key symbols preceding any attempt to fashion an Israeli identity.3 Indeed, the Sho'ah has begun not only to figure retroactively preSho'ah catastrophes, it has also become a standard by which all post-Holocaust calamities are measured.4 The following concise description of the various phases in the typification of the Holocaust is a sketchy attempt deserving a much lengthier elaboration, yet it should provide us with the broad perspective needed for the ensuing discussion. The Israeli Yishuv (pre-state community) reactions to the Holocaust reflected to a large extent a sense of resentment, and rejection, of the behavior of the Jewish victims. These, according to the widely held belief, passively accepted their fate, subscribing to the \"traditional line of conduct\" of Jews in the Diaspora.5 This negative stance was combined with the socialist-Zionists' ideological rejection of the Jewish Diaspora, and ideas of militarism and state sovereignty turned into a way of life in newly formed Israel.6 In a kibbutz Haggada for Passover written just after the Holocaust, it is argued that \"not only Hitler is responsible for the death of the six millions—but all of us—and first and foremost these six millions. Had they known that a Jew has power too, they would not have all gone as lambs to slaughter.\"7 Without any attempt to assess the historical factuality of the metaphor of \"lamb to slaughter,\" it is argued here that its actual acceptance was a result of its relevance to the predominant ideological trends in Israeli society. A very partial yet representative list of examples concerning the use of \"lamb to slaughter\" in Israeli society should make the case clearer. The metaphor of \"lamb to slaughter\" was not directed to the Holocaust alone; it was the cumulative conception of what was considered the Jews' passive acceptance of their own victimization, from the crusades of the Middle Ages to Kishinev's pogroms. Originally a biblical metaphor (Isaiah 53:7) it was to become first a metonymy and then a slogan. In prayers of Kaddish dedicated to the victims of the Holocaust, the Israeli ministry of education has included the words\n\n12\n\nAviad E. Raz\n\n\"lamb to slaughter.\" As early as June 22, 1944, when everyone already knew what went on in Auschwitz, the Israeli newspaper related to the socialist movement, Davar, asked in its first page: \"Why don't Hungarian Jews defend themselves?\" An Israeli paratrooper returning from Hungary in 1945 reports that in Tel Aviv he was repeatedly asked, \"why didn't the Jews rebel? why did they go as lambs to slaughter?\"9 It was around this period that the popular nickname \"soap\" was invented and used widely in reference to Holocaust survivors.10 Ben-Gurion, in an interview with the New York Times (December 18, 1960) before the Eichmann Trial, justified the trial as \"proving to Israel's younger generation that Israelis are not like lambs to be taken to slaughter, but a nation able to fight back.\"11 Along with the image of \"lamb to slaughter\" there existed another, opposite image: the Jew as rebel. It was articulated, for example, in the naming of the national memorial day for the Holocaust as being also \"in memory of the ghetto uprisings,\" or the naming of the Yad va-Shem Institute as the \"Memorial Agency for the Holocaust and Heroism.\" However, this formal reference only attests to the dominance of the other metaphor. Indeed, the metaphor of the rebellious Holocaust Jew could not have served as an equivalent to the \"lamb to slaughter.\" Even if there was a small number of Jewish rebels, they were all defeated by the Nazis, and their rebellion was a priori futile. It is interesting to note that early Israeli educational texts replaced the word \"Jews\" by \"Hebrews\" (Ivrim) ancl \"sons of Israel\" when referring to the rebels.12 This pair of archetypical opposites, the \"lamb to slaughter\" and \"the rebel,\" will later form the basis for discussing the common narrative of the two novels. The image of the Holocaust Jew as a \"lamb to slaughter,\" with all its problematics, has become legitimized through the militaristic ethos of Israeli society and the ideological negation of historic 'Jewish passivity.' This sense of resentment has its perhaps most extreme expression in the Ben-\n\nRewriting the Holocaust\n\n13\n\nGurion doctrine of state sovereignity, which rejects the exile and the Holocaust as irrelevant to the Israeli reality. To BenGurion, the Holocaust was something which \"happened to the diaspora Jews because they were diaspora Jews,\" and \"antisemitism, the Dreyfus trial, Jewish persecutions in Rumania . . . are for us events from foreign history and sad memories of diaspora Jews, but not a spiritual experience nor life facts of instructive value.\"13 Liebman and Don-Yehiah, in their account of the transformation of civil religion in Israel, describe how its new form after 1967 redefined the Holocaust as the ultimate expression of the evil intents of the Gentiles and their everlasting hatred of Jews.14 The Holocaust was molded as a constant reminder of \"what happened and can happen anew.\" Thus, in a memorial ceremony to the Holocaust held in 1976, Golda Meir said that \"the Holocaust of each and every Jew has become the collective Holocaust for the state of Israel,\"15 and Gideon Hausner, former prosecutor in the Eichmann Trial in 1960 stated that \"the Holocaust and the rebels are still part of our reality\".16 A major popularizer of this viewpoint was Menachem Begin who, in the middle of the Lebanon War, during the siege on Beirut, described Ya'ser Arafat as a \"Hitler hiding [from Israeli soldiers] in a bunker.\"17 Thus, whereas the selective attitude of Ben-Gurion's \"state sovereignty\" dismissed the Holocaust as irrelevant to Israeli reality and encouraged the rejection and silencing directed toward the Holocaust survivors and their experience, Begin's interpretation redefined it as a national integrating factor and a locus of Jewish solidarity. However, it was only in the third stage, and with the third generation, that Israeli society has reconsidered the Holocaust in terms of individual suffering. Instead of the allembracing generalizations of a \"memorial day for the six million,\" the year 1990 saw the memorial project called \"everyone has a name,\" in which people were invited to read, through a loudspeaker, the names of Holocaust victims at various sites erected throughout the country. Nothing is\n\n14\n\nAviad E. Raz\n\nperhaps more illustrative of the change in Israelis' perceptions of the Holocaust than the new custom of \"youth delegations\" sent to concentration camps in Germany and Poland. For a description of one of these journeys, portrayed as a political pilgrimage of \"oneness\"—as well as a journey to confront xenophobia—see Segev.18 II. The Holocaust in Israeli Literature: Writing the Unspeakable The meaning and use of the Holocaust as a literary theme have been widely studied, not surprisingly mostly by Jewish authors, from various political, sociological, and philosophical, as well as literary, perspectives.19 In the case of individual writers such as Sylvia Plath, Edmond Jabes, Primo Levi or Elie Wiesel, no study of their work is complete without reference to the Holocaust. It was the Holocaust that also created a new genre of literary testimony, with its own distinct poetics.20 Yaoz,21 in her study of the Holocaust in Hebrew literature, considers the perspective of the \"other planet\" as a key to the poetic task of attempting to express the inhuman horror of the Holocaust. This literary attempt to grasp the uncomrnunicable, poetically self-defeating as it might be, is nevertheless functional in framing the otherwise incomprehensible into a textual, and hence intelligible, structure.22 The metaphor of \"the other planet\" is taken from Ka-Tzetnik (Yechiel Dinur) novels,23 in which the poetic drive of the writing is \"to prove\" that the Holocaust is an aberration, a rupture of history. Without addressing the intricate task of classifying the whole of Israeli Holocaust literature, a brief glance at the titles chosen for Ka-Tzetnik's novels, along with those of books by other Israeli authors, should serve to demonstrate the common denominators of this \"other planet\" genre, which emphasizes the uniqueness of the Holocaust by repeating several motives that have been turned into metonymys. This list of titles contains, for example, Star Eternal and Sunrise over Hell\n\nRewriting the Holocaust\n\n15\n\n(Ka-Tzetnik); Not of This Time, Not of This Place and Bells and Trains (Yehuda Amichai); The Burning Bush (Aharon Meged); Children of the Shadows (Ben-Zion Tomer); Smoke and Night Train (Aharon Appelfeld); Night Chariot and The World's Vacuum (Itamar Ya'oz-Kest). The \"other planet\" genre, which has until recently dominated the literary scene, is perhaps the other side of rejection and silencing which characterized the first phase of typifying the Holocaust in Israel. By overemphasizing the absence of a proper language for describing the Holocaust, it unconsciously encourages its obscuration, and furthermore its silencing, by those who do not share that language. By claiming the incomparable uniqueness of the Holocaust, it unintentionally prepares the ground for rejecting it as an aberration, a mutation, a kind of transcendental monstrosity. In short, by withdrawing ever more persuasively into a private planet and a private language, it serves to widen the distance between \"their Holocaust\" and \"our life.\" Other novels exploited more indirect, subtle approaches. Avoiding the actual \"horror time\" of the Holocaust itself, they focused on historical periods either preceding or following it. Thus, one of the most prominent novels written in Hebrew under the influence of the Holocaust, Saul and Johanna (Sha'ul ve'Yohanna), by Naomi Frenkel, describes Jewish life in Germany before the destruction. Another famous novel, David Grossman's Look Under: Love, focuses on the Holocaust's impact on both its survivors and their children now in Israel. Rather than emphasizing the trans-historical nature of the Holocaust, Frenkel's trilogy seeks to express its precedents by drawing a historical panorama of the decline of the Weimar Republic. Other novels belonging to this historical genre are, for example, Amidst the Living and the Dead (Yonat and Alexander Sand) which focuses on one class in a Polish gymnasium during the thirties; Lead Soldiers (Uri Orlev); and Ka-Tzetnik's chronicle-type novels, for instance Salamander. Thomas Mann's Buddenbrooks is another, well-known example of this genre.\n\n16\n\nAviad E. Raz\n\nGrossman's novel (Look Under: Love), written thirty years after the Holocaust, was the first to deal directly with the experience of Holocaust survivors vis-a-vis its conception by Israel's second generation. In effect, the \"real\" protagonists of the novel are the Israeli children of Holocaust survivors (the so-called \"second generation\"). The novel revolves around their attempt to embark from silence into speech. In it the narrator, an Israeli child named Momik, the son of Holocaust survivors, imagines the Holocaust to be a monster lurking in the darkness of the family house's locked cellar. Another novel belonging to the same category as Grossman's is, for example, Adam Resurrected (by Yoram Kaniuk), in which the protagonist, a Holocaust survivor now living in Israel, is forced into an asylum by his relatives. The types, or genres, of Israeli Holocaust literature that I have in mind, then, can be generally classified into four categories. They include, first, the \"other planet\" type and the testimonies (personal autobiographies), which can be written only by Holocaust survivors; second, the historical, and third the accommodation and confrontation types, both characterizing the attempt of the \"second generation\" to come to terms with the Holocaust; and, finally, the manipulation type, to which I shall now turn. The linkage between these four literary types and their counterparts in Israeli symbolic and ideological conceptions of the Holocaust will be discussed in the ensuing conclusion. III. The Case of Literary Manipulation: Una and Border Patrol Several reasons exist for discussing these two novels together. They are the latest additions to the fast-growing corpus of Israeli Holocaust literature. Although belonging to different literary genres (Una is a psychological, stream-of-consciousness novel, Border Patrol is a thriller), both share a parallel narrative in which a young contemporary Jew is mysteriously drawn back to the Holocaust, witnessing it anew through the eyes of a Jewish person who lived under Nazi occupation\n\nRewriting the Holocaust\n\n17\n\nduring World War II. The two authors share high socioeconomic backgrounds. Both are Ashkenazi intellectuals working in the academy, neither claim political orientation, and neither are children of Holocaust survivors. Thus, their social identity, briefly illustrated as it is, represents the central concensus of Israeli society. One of them is male, the other female, and their \"Holocaust Jews\" are respectively male and female. The differences in gender present themselves in the writing, yet the parallels I discuss loom even larger in this light. Let me now turn to a brief textual comparison of the novels, starting with a concise description of the plots, which will then lead to a detailed analysis of two specific excerpts. Bartov's narrator and protagonist is a young Israeli scholar who comes to Germany to research some unknown details of the Nazi regime. During his work in the archives he comes across a report written by an S.S. officer, commander of a special unit (Einsatzkommando) whose function is to exterminate Jews in conquered areas. He is thereafter consumed by vivid hallucinations, which culminate in the observation of an imaginary fight between the Nazi officer (Georg Hasse) and a Jewish woodcutter (Jacob Himmel). Peleg's narrator and protagonist, in contrast, is a little girl living in a village under Nazi occupation, watching every night, together with all the villagers, how her Jewish mother fights with a Polish woman. This little girl is in fact dreamt of by the \"real\" protagonist, a grown-up Jewish woman living in contemporary New York. Several clues hint that she is in fact an Israeli expatriate. Both the Jewish woman in New York and the Israeli scholar in Germany are \"dreaming about\" the Holocaust, reconstructing certain episodes in it and living them through the eyes of a Holocaust Jew, to whom they find themselves strangely attracted. This Jew is perhaps the great-grandfather or great-grandmother they were told about long ago, when they were children. However, this reconstruction claims no commitment to historical facts; rather, it manipulates them according to a different scheme.\n\n18\n\nAviad E. Raz\n\nThe transitions between \"real\" time (i.e., the present of the narrator) and \"dream time\" (i.e., the present of the Holocaust Jew) constitute the compositional structure of the plot. A parallel use of moving in time as an organizing principle is found in Amiichai's Holocaust novel which bears the telling title Not of This Time, Not of This Place.24 His novel is built on a deliberate entangling of diachronic and synchronic time systems. In one time system the narrator, Yoel, is living in Jerusalem in the 1950s, and in the other he finds himself in post-Holocaust Germany, where he is said to be \"like that hero, Odysseus, who ventured down into Hell, so that the demons might be revealed to him\" (p. 133). In Bartov's and Peleg's novels, the transition in time, accompanied by a transition in dramatis personae, also functions as a rite of transition, in which the contemporary person recaptures his sense of identity through becoming one with the spirit of his ancestor.25 This sense of identity, however, is too fragile and momentary to last long. It exists only during the rite of transition. This means that in order to sustain it, the narrator must forever remain in the liminal state of his subjective consciousness. Indeed, the two novels conclude with an abstract stream of consciousness in which time, place, and dramatis personae all chaotically diffuse with no sign of possible order. Focusing on the unique characteristics of that ancestor, namely the \"Holocaust Jew\" that the authors have chosen to reconstruct, I would now like to address the fight scenes in each of the two novels. Each scene holds a central function both in the novel's plot and in its narrative structure. In Border Patrol this scene is found at the end of the novel, and provides a culmination and a catharsis for the whole plot; in Una, it stands at the beginning, providing a setting and a motivation for the protagonist's quest for self-identity. A comparison of the actual excerpts might be illuminating:\n\nRewriting the Holocaust He went out of the woods, and easily identified the man lying on the moist leafy couch. Stopping a few steps from him, he tapped his heels and introduced himself: \"S.S. Hauptsturmfuhrer Georg Hasse, Einsatzcommando commandant.\". . . His black uniform fit tightly to his strong body. The badge of death skull glittered on the right lapel of his collar, . . . his clear eyes were reflecting beams of the setting sun. Jacob looked a while at the young officer, then got up heavily. \"Jacob Himmel, woodcutter, at your service,\" he said in Yiddish. \"I have been looking for you for a long time,\" said Hasse. \"I was waiting for you, because I knew you would come,\" said Jacob Himmel. The sun touched the trees, and a cold wind began to blow. Leaves were turning round in the clearing and Yiftach no longer knew where he was, because he was now seeing simultaneously the road junction and the two men in the middle of it, the many towns lying around, the lines of tanks and trucks and soldiers, the smoke and the fires. Despite all this he remained in the clearing, beside the two men. Now he knew they would fight until death. (\"The Fight,\" p. 126, from Border Patrol)\n\n19\n\nFor the sixth time, father Anton's cry terrified us . . . his black priest robe pulling him down to the sawdust floor, anchoring him to the ground . . . six times, when that coil of snakes, tangled in the sawdust, the coil that was two women. They were a heavy Jewish woman who used to read sacred books of heretics by the window in the evenings, and beautiful Zelka whose image was seen in the woods when she was strolling through the forest, of whom the very earth would reflect her unbearably pretty face; when that coil of snakes became petrified in that last moment just before the end, before expiring, before the climax, and you could hear the silence solidifying, turning hard as steel—then it was broken by father Anton's cry . . . six times it postponed the end, but now, we knew, it wouldn't. Because the necessity is stronger than the cry, stronger than the refusal, stronger than the will, and tonight it will be decided. (\"The Battle,\" p. 11, from Una)\n\n20\n\nAviad E. Raz\n\nBoth scenes portray a duel to the death between two opponents: Nazi and Jew. The chapters' titles attest to their ritualistic contents: \"the battle\" and \"the fight.\" The dramatic settings, located in a sort of dream time that is really out of time or place, suggest a myth of an eternal return, where the two opponents represent two extremes, two worlds that cannot reside together. Accordingly, the persons fighting are essentially archetypes, metonymically standing for Nazi and Jew.26 The Holocaust Jew, in whom we are interested, undergoes a dramatic transformation. Whereas usually portrayed in Israeli culture as passive, powerless, a \"lamb to slaughter\" (and in Jewish culture, also as martyr), here we find someone who rebels, fights back, and finally defeats the Nazi in a bare-handed face-to-face confrontation. The common narrative underpinning both texts (that of the contemporary Israeli's quest for identity , which inevitably brings him, and her, to the Holocaust) reaffirms the previously discussed significance of the Holocaust as a key symbol preceding any attempt to fashion a modern Israeli or Jewish identity. As we gradually move away from the historical events of the Holocaust, it becomes inaccessible to us except in textual forms. \"Writing about\" the Holocaust then necessarily passes through its prior textualization, its narrativization in what Jameson calls the political unconscious.27 It is in this context that the startlingly similar formulation of the image of the Holocaust Jew poses itself and asks to be explained. I suggest that the explanation does not lie solely \"inside\" the plot. It also has to be reconstructed as a symptom whose cause is another order of phenomenon. The prominent function that this parallel formulation holds in both novels presumably reflects the preoccupation of three Israeli generations with that symbol. Moreover, the complete transformation of the Jew from a \"lamb to slaughter\" into the opposite archetypical \"warrior\" or \"rebel\" demands further explanation. Among its many reapplications to unrelated events, the Holocaust Jew has become, among other examples, the trope for suffering Russians (in Yevtushenko's poetry), for poets\n\nRewriting the Holocaust\n\n21\n\n(for Paul Celan), for psychic pain (for Sylvia Plath), and for Palestinian refugees (for Israeli poets). The case in point, however, is different, since the novelists did not replicate the archetype of the Holocaust Jew, but transformed it. This transformation can make sense within the narrative structure of the novel, since it is this rebellious quality of the ancestor that gives meaning to the quest and restores his/ her offspring's identity. Artificially manipulated and lacking credibility as it does, it is still functional. But how are we to account for that transformation sociologically? Here the discussion is open for hypotheses. A possible clue is that all the cases of \"replication\" indicated above emanate from a primarily Jewish archetype of the Holocaust Jew, reflecting vietimization, suffering, and martyrdom. In contrast, the unique archetypical characteristics of the Holocaust Jew in the two novels suggest a reversal from a primarily Israeli conception of that archetype—the concept of \"lamb to slaughter.\" Perhaps it is here, in the denial of the conception of \"lamb to slaughter,\" that we should look for the answer. IV. Discussion A case study in the sociology of the novel, this inquiry has proceeded in two directions, literary and sociological, picking up examples and explanations of both kinds as it progressed. I shall first attempt to introduce some order into the puzzle, organizing the two domains into one matrix. For this purpose, let me define three principles, or axes, around which transformations occur. Within the historical-sociological sphere, there are two axes of transformation: 1. Personal distance from the Holocaust: the diminishing contact with Holocaust survivors living in Israel, or any other authentic Holocaust text, for that matter. This contact grows weaker as time decreases the number of living survivors. As survivors pass away, the genre of testimony also dies out; and, literaiy works dealing with the problematic confrontation with the Holocaust experience\n\n22\n\nAviad E. Raz\n\n(whether by survivors themselves, in the form of \"the other planet\" genre, or by second-generation Israelis who confront their upbringing) are also gradually disappearing. 2. Social distance from the Holocaust: the spreading of various ideologies (militarism, state sovereignity, socialistZionism, national-religious) in Israeli society, which interpret the Holocaust in a certain manner and define its key symbols (among these, \"lamb to slaughter\" is the most relevant to this study). The space unfolded by these two axes of transformation grows in direct relation to the passage of time. As the distance from the Holocaust grows, the degrees of freedom expand. In this respect, the Holocaust is like the center of a crack in a mirror. Whereas the sociological axes provide the larger context for the emergence of the genres identified here, the literaryaesthetic parameters denote their syntax. Here we find the third principle of transformation: the transformation of genres. This syntax is made up of two categories: the representative and the expressive. According to Scholes and Kellog,28 the representative tends to replicate reality, whereas the expressive brings up only certain aspects of it, and reorganizes them on a higher level. The representative is metonymical (standing as part to a whole), self-contained, and tending to mimesis, whereas the expressive is metaphorical (links different worlds), open-ended, and tends to metaphysics. This distinction is also echoed in James's29 notions of the historical and the trans-historical, where the former contains a well-constructed set of spatio-temporal events and historical facts, striving for completeness and authenticity of description, and the latter avoids historical facts and relies on an inner logic, in a manner parallel to myths, dreams, and madness. Figure 1 illustrates the isomorphism between literature and society within these axes of transformation. The alternation of literary genres follows the aesthetic transformations, and moves from the representative (historic) to the expres-\n\nRewriting the Holocaust\n\n23\n\nsive (trans-historic). These aesthetic axes themselves are contained w i t h i n a broader, social frame of reference, w h i c h includes the d i m i n i s h i n g contact w i t h Holocaust survivors o n the one h a n d a n d the spreading of ideologies o n the other. The diagram t h u s provides a general framework t h r o u g h w h i c h the relations a m o n g different genres (testimony, documentary, fiction) as well as symbols (\"lamb to slaughter\" vs. \"the rebel\") c a n be defined. It c a n be seen t h a t w i t h i n a s h o r t distance f r o m the Holocaust, the texts t e n d to be representative a n d h i s t o r i c a l (testimonies); where ideology enters the scene a n d increases the social distance, we f i n d a representative text w h i c h is also trans-historical (\"lamb to slaughter\"); trans-historical novels w h i c h are also representative (the \"other planet\" type) as well as novels of the h i s t o r i c a l a n d expressive type (e.g. Frenkel's Saul and Johanna) t h e n follow. W h e n t i m e f u r t h e r increases the personal distance, second- (e.g. Grossman's Look Under: Love) a n d t h i r d - g e n e r a t i o n (e.g. the novels discussed here) l i t e r a t u r e appear. They are b o t h expressive a n d trans-historical. The model of c u m u l a t i v e evolution s h o w n i n figure 1 expects a geometrical increase i n the possible alternatives a n d the a c t u a l v a r i a b i l i t y of the texts. C o n t r a r y to t h i s forecast, therefore, i t is odd to encounter the s t a r t l i n g paralleli s m between the two novels i n point. Possible explanations c a n be traced i n three directions. First, i t c a n be seen as a coincidence: a perfectly logical explanation, b u t n o t m u c h to w r i t e about. Second, neom a r x i s m m i g h t be invoked to explain the p h e n o m e n o n as a n ideology w h i c h has become internalized, a n a n t i - l a m b ‫ ־‬t o s l a u g h t e r s y m p t o m . Let me d i s c u s s t h i s o p t i o n f u r t h e r . N e o m a r x i s m is concerned w i t h l i t e r a t u r e as a social i n s t i t u tion, a n objective d e m o n s t r a t i o n of the a r t i c u l a t i o n of t r a d i t i o n a l values a n d of emergent values w h i c h , i n t u r n , reflect the power s t r u c t u r e of society a n d the challenges to it. Explored as a socially symbolic act, 30 the texts i n point present a logical step f o r w a r d i n the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of d o m i n a n t ideology. For if, as argued, the c r i t i c i s m concerning the negativity\n\nRewriting the Holocaust\n\n25\n\nand passivity of \"lamb to slaughter\" have been long legitimized and reinforced by the dominant socialist-Zionist and militaristic ideology, and reproduced through the education system, then the literary transformation of that metaphor into a positive, active Jewish rebel is the final victory of that ideology. However, such a strictly neomarxist interpretation would seem oversimplistic to many. Moreover, the fact that other novels written by the same authors are completely incongruent with that interpretation, and the fact that both authors hold different political opinions than those attributed to them by that interpretation, render it somewhat equivocal. These novels are not a parallel case to Robinson Crusoe or Tarzan, and their authors do not adhere to a certain doctrine they wish to articulate. A more subtle, structural approach is needed. My argument is, first, that the Holocaust has reached a new stage in its role as a literary subject. Previously documented, represented, and expressed in various (trans-) historical fashions, it now lends itself to extreme manipulation. Evidently, any of these poetic vehicles is manipulative to a certain extent. However, Una and Border Patrol not only contain some sort of manipulation, but fictional manipulation constitutes their very meaning. In their replacement of fact for fiction and history for narrative, they present a novel concerned not with the experience of the Holocaust, its survivors or their children, but with the Israeli third-generation Sabra alone. This Israeli has come to terms with the Holocaust through second- (and third-) hand texts of mass communication such as television, movies, books (most popularly, Anne Frank's diary), and memorial ceremonies at school. A study shows that Ashkenazi pupils indicate they learned something from talking with their parents and from history classes, however these two sources were not very influential.31 What is remembered of the Holocaust, then, depends on the texts now giving it form. It is startling to notice that both Una and Border Patrol contain no survivors (only Holocaust Jews and Sabras); nor does the word \"Sho'ah\" appear in them.32 Their titles also suggest a novel approach, compared with the metonymic categories of titles discussed in section 2.\n\n26\n\nAviad E. Raz\n\nFurthermore, the two novels share a manipulative presentation of the Holocaust Jew, a presentation seen through third-generation Israeli eyes. The reformulation of the Holocaust Jew as a rebel attests to the denial of the opposite metaphor—the lamb to slaughter. Irresistibly attracted to their Jewish Holocaust ancestors as a kind of haunting enigma containing the key to their identity, these authors have reshaped them to befit their quest. Thus, as the search for identity became a pilgrimage, the object of that search had to be archetypically transformed. The logic of the narrative implies that had it been the Sabra who was hypothetically to find himself entrapped in the Holocaust—as indeed happens in these novels—then he would not have chosen to go as lamb to slaughter, but rather have chosen the active, militaristic line of conduct—as indeed is the case in the two novels. Lucien Goldmann once posed two questions which, he wrote, contain the whole substance of the sociology of literature: Why was this book written? and Why is it still read?33 This case study attempted to address the first question. The second—which necessitates a temporal perspective—remains beyond our current reach. It awaits further elaboration and expansion, through the structural framework defined here, in the future. The issue, therefore, remains open-ended. Far from presuming a decisive and strict reply to the questions it raises, this analysis has striven to set those questions in a general context, invoking the unique conditions pertinent to the Israeli scene under which literature can be seen to provide, as it always does, a symbolic structure within which people can make sense of, and come to terms with, their past and present history.

Such a poetic is characterized, for instance, by the following problematic: on the one hand, the survivor-scribe's claim to have produced an authentic text which enriches the already-existing \"library\" of testimonies lies in incorporating himself and his unique experience into the text, thus making it a \"text of identity.\" On the other hand, in order to make his testimony seem true, he has to simultaneously efface himself from the text (Young 1988, op. cit.). 21. Yaoz, H., The Holocaust in Hebrew Literature. (Tel Aviv: Eked, 1980) (in Hebrew). 22. The paradoxical quality inherent in the poetics of \"the other planet\" can be located in the unresolved tension between metaphor and metonymy. \"There are no metaphors for Auschwitz,\" writes Alvin Rosenfeld (1980, op. cit, p. 180), \"just as Auschwitz is not a metaphor for anything else . . . why is this the case? because the flames were real flames, the ashes only ashes, the smoke always and only smoke.\" Thus, the \"other planet\" literature is at once both metaphorical (metaphysical, expressive, trans-historical) and literal (metonymic, representative, historical). 23. For example, Ka-Tzetnik 135633 (Yechiel Dinur), Star Eternal, translated by Nina Dinur. (New York: Arbor House, 1971). 24. Amichai, Yehuda, Not of This Time, Not of This Place, translated by Shlomo Katz. (New York: Harper and Row, 1968). 25. A brief etymological analysis of the opponents' names in Border Patrol might be relevant: Hasse can refer in German either to Hass, \"hatred\"—or, in contrast, to Hase, Hare (figuratively, \"coward\"); whereas Himmel is \"heaven.\" In both cases, the reference is archetypal. In addition, the title of the other novel—which is also the title of the protagonist—Una, is a non-name either standing for \"the one\" (as in the Latin stem) or simply \"woman\" (as in Japanese). 26. This phenomenon is of course well known to anthropologists, and has been reported from places as disparate as the Aborigines' Australia and the Huichols' Mexico. One might argue that in the novels' case, this ancestor is \"fictitious\": however, isn't this always the case? 27. Jameson, Frederic, The Political Unconscious. (London: Methuen, 1981). 28.

The words sho'ah and churban carry a definite sense of divine retribution (alluding to their biblical meaning—see for instance Isa. 6:11, 10:3, 47:11). Interestingly, the word \"holocaust\" is etymologically derived from the Greek holokauston, which literally means \"whole burnt,\" and refers in the Septuagint specifically to sacrifice by fire, standing for the Hebrew term for sacrificial offering, ola. 33. Goldmann, Lucien, Pour Une Sociologie du Roman. (Paris: Idees, 1965) p. 23.\n\nEspionage and Cultural Mediation\n\nWalter P. Zenner Amnon Shamosh, Arazim (Cedars of Lebanon), Tel Aviv: Massada, Ltd., 1990.\n\nOr\n\nhen we speak about the meeting of cultures, we usually think about individuals who represent differences between two distinct social systems and who learn traits and patterns from the \"other\" culture. The spy, however, must stand between two cultures surreptitiously. I recall a World War II film about American spies who had to learn to eat in a European fashion, holding the knife in the left hand and the fork in the right in order to pass as Frenchmen after parachuting into Nazi-occupied France. The central irony of Amnon Shamosh's 1990 novel, Arazim, deals with this kind of ambiguity. In this case, the spies have been subjected to a double acculturation process. They are Middle Eastern Jewish immigrants to Israel who have been taught by Europeans who wanted them to rid themselves of their \"Oriental\" ways. However, as Israeli agents, the spies must now return to an Arab world which they had left behind. The author of this novel has made the movement across cultural boundaries a major theme in his fiction, as it was in his own life. Amnon Shamosh was born in Aleppo in 1929 and immigrated to Eretz Yisrael as a child.1 He became a\n\n31\n\n32\n\nWalter P. Zenner\n\nmember of Kibbutz Ma'ayan Baruch at its founding in the late 1940s; he has continued to live there. He turned to writing in the late 1960s. Shamosh has published novels, poems, short stories, and nonfiction. Much of his writing is centered around the portrayal of Aleppine Jewry in Aleppo, the metropolis of North Syria, and in the various countries to which they have immigrated. The Aleppian Jews constantly mediate between cultures. He points out that even in their everyday language, words from Arabic, Hebrew, French, and Spanish are strung together in single intelligible sentences. In describing their lives in Syria, the Americas, and Israel, he shows how they preserved their identity while at the same time adapting to a variety of settings. While the fate of Aleppine (North Syrian) Jewry is a central theme, Shamosh is more than an ethnic author. In fact, the dilemmas of the kibbutz as it has changed from a revolutionary experiment into an agribusiness represents a strong motif in his work. The loss of collective ideals, the disenchantment with socialism, defection of kibbutz youth, the loss of a clear vision by members of communes, the kibbutz as a Jewish community without a synagogue, and similar topics can be found in his stories. They play a role in Arazim, too. Ethnic themes serve both as a counterpoint to his concern with the kibbutz and as a critique of the way in which Israeli society in general has absorbed immigrants. He is particularly critical of the way in which the Diaspora culture was devalued in Israel, especially with regard to the rich cultures of the Middle East. In his fiction, he uses a historical perspective on the conflict between dominant Euro-Zionist culture and that of Middle Eastern Jews which extends from the 1930s to the present. In this chapter, we will see how Shamosh weaves the motif of the spy as a traveler across cultural boundaries together with threads from the motif of the upbringing of Middle Eastern Jews on the kibbutz in Arazim. This will be shown through reference to two novels by Shamosh: to a chapter in Michel Ezra Sofia and Sons (1978) devoted to the\n\nEspionage and Cultural Mediation\n\n33\n\nespionage career of one of the characters, and to Arazim, which was published in 1990. While the intelligence agents in the earlier novel work after the establishment of the State, and the latter work at the time of its creation, Shamosh takes a critical stand towards espionage in both works. Avrum Safra as Spy In his best-known novel, Michel Ezra Safra and Sons (1978), Amnon Shamosh briefly deals with Israeli espionage.2 This novel traces a single Aleppo Jewish family's history from the late 1930s to the late 1970s and from Syria to France, Israel, and the Americas. In chapter 31 Shamosh depicts the spying career of one of Michel Ezra Safra's sons, Albert/Avrum. Avrum is the most \"Zionist\" character in the book. He is the son who most clearly rebels against his father by joining a youth movement and becoming a kibbutznik. The chapter begins with the patriarch, Michel Ezra, comparing the Jews with the Druzes. Unlike the Jews, the Druzes are agriculturalists and fighters. They appear to blend in with their neighbors, but they manage to live their own inner lives without arousing those of other religions. Michel Ezra, who opposes Albert's Zionism, believes that the Jews will never succeed in living in harmony with their neighbors. Michel Ezra uses the example of the Druzes to throw cold water on Albert's enthusiasm for the Zionists. The introduction of the Druze example in a chapter which will deal with espionage is strange, but perhaps the Druze, who are known to hide their private religious beliefs, serve as an example to spies, who also must not arouse the suspicions of their hosts. Then the scene of the chapter changes to the 1950s, the difficult period of consolidation after the attainment of Israeli independence. Albert, now known as Avrum, lives on a kibbutz. He is recruited by \"them,\" the intelligence services, for a mission abroad. Young Arabic speakers are being mobilized to infiltrate the neighboring countries. Avrum is first given a course in intelligence, but then he is sent home to await further instructions. He experiences relief and disappointment.\n\n34\n\nWalter P. Zenner\n\nHe feels that his efforts in the course were wasted, though Shamosh comments through Avrum, \"what is this waste compared to the waste in the procurement of weapons?\"3 When Avrum is sent abroad, his cover is that of a Syrian millionaire who has made his fortune in South America. He goes first to South America and then to meetings with high governmental officials in Syria and Lebanon. He also comes face to face with the son of a powerful Aleppine notable who knew his father well. At the end of this chapter, he finds out that this man had recognized him, but had not blown his cover. As his father had suggested, Avrum had ultimately failed in his mission because he did not blend in. This story has parallels to one of the most famous episodes in Arab-Israeli espionage, the Eli Kohen case. Eli Kohen was an Israeli spy, born in Egypt, who infiltrated into Damascus. His cover was that of an Arab who had made his fortune in South America. Kohen provided valuable intelligence on Syria before he was exposed and hung as a spy in the 1960s. Incidentally, at that time the Egyptians sent to Israel a spy, Kaburak Yacobian, whose experiences parallel those of Kohen. He was an Armenian, whose background was also \"laundered\" in Latin America and who passed as an Egyptian Jew of Turkish background when he was sent to Israel.4 Thus both Arab and Israeli intelligence agencies used overseas communities to establish covers. The various Levantine diasporas were sources for the cadres of many intelligence agencies. People who have lived in communities like interwar Cairo or Beirut are able to pass through the borders which separate Israel from its neighbors with the greatest of ease. While Israelis have long feared \"Levantinization,\" they have needed those who came from the cosmopolitan centers of the Middle East, where many Jews learned to speak Arabic and French fluently to serve as diplomats and undercover agents. While Michel Ezra Safra and Sons contains many incidents in which both Ashkenazim and Sephardim display their ethnocentrism, this chapter does not focus on ethnic relations among Jews. The chapter does, however, give an equivo-\n\nEspionage and Cultural Mediation\n\n35\n\ncal account of the often-praised espionage exploits of the Mossad. In the context of the novel, the need for this chapter is not clear. Perhaps the author felt that in telling the story of Syrian Jews since the 1940s, he should include the contributions made by Syrian and other Arabic-speaking Jews to Israeli intelligence. Their knowledge of their former homecountries gave invaluable assistance to the Zionist cause, but they were often denied recognition for it. This chapter was one way of putting the spotlight on this contribution. Israelis in Lebanon—1948 Arazim takes up this theme. The 1990 novel is dedicated \"to the good comrades from the Arab Department of the Palmach who were active in Syria and Lebanon and to the memory of those who went out and never returned\" (p. iii). It explicitly serves to underline the important role played by the Middle Eastern Jewish spies who served Israel. Arazim is a historical novel about Israeli agents in Lebanon in a period which coincides with the establishment of the State. It is not, however, a traditional spy novel. Rather it is an account of the initial experiences of a small group of Jews of Middle Eastern background, both immigrants and Sabras, as they learn to be spies. It shows how these callow youths were sent to collect intelligence and carry out sabotage operations during the War for Independence. The protagonist, Abu Salim, and his companion, Mirro, are sent to Beirut on the eve of the war. They pose as Palestinian Muslim refugees. For cover, they purchase a grocery store. Through much of the novel, they are shown as bored and disappointed that they are missing the battles going on in Eretz Yisrael. One of the protagonists laments that spying is basically a very boring activity (Arazim, p. 89). Shamosh here portrays the initial amateurishness of early Israeli espionage and the mundane activities that accompany secret operations. It is something which many spy novels allude to, but few portray. Shamosh does have didactic motives in writing this novel, as he does in much of his fiction. In addition to showing that\n\n36\n\nWalter P. Zenner\n\nSyrian Jews are an integral part of the Israeli mosaic, the novel permits the author to give voice to his doubts about Israel's ability to adapt to its neighbors and the complex web of ties that made the older Levantine mosaic last for a long time. For instance, Hassan, the Syrian who does not expose Avrum, is the son of a powerful patron of Avrum's father. In the relationship between the two fathers one found arrogance and importunity, but also loyalty. In Arazim, Shamosh brings out this theme through the main characters. Spies in Arab countries were often recruited from among Jews of Middle Eastern background because they had the necessary characteristics to pass, even though they had also been subjected to \"Euro-Sabra\" socialization. The theme has importance here. The Middle Easterners are recruited as spies precisely because they know the culture of the enemy, yet this culture is devalued within Israel. The novel brings forth the irony of this paradox. Together the two main characters discuss and evaluate their experiences on the kibbutz, where both received their education. Abu Salim is a native of Syria while Mirro is a son of Syrian immigrants to Egypt. They both reminisce about their kibbutz mother, Fania. Fania was the key figure who cared for the \"Syrian youths\" when they arrived on the kibbutz. She was a strong, dedicated woman. Their other counselor, Yokel, was not really very forceful. He was involved with his music and he felt veiy hurt when the Syrians received his lessons in Western classical music with indifference. To himself, but never aloud, he thought of them as Levantines, inferior half-breeds. It was Fania, however, who sought most energetically to remove the stigma of the Orient from them. They accepted, yet resented her efforts. The process of transforming Syrian and other Middle Easterners into Sabras on the kibbutz was dealt with by Shamosh in another work, \"Ben Mesheq,\" a short story which appeared in 1980.5 The protagonist in this story, like Abu Salim, is part of a group of Syrian children who\n\nEspionage and Cultural Mediation\n\n37\n\nare brought to a kibbutz. The various children are separated on the basis of age, with the older children going to one kibbutz and the younger to another. The protagonist is given a kibbutz mother who is unlike his own mother. From the start, when she assumes that all children like cocoa, she forces European ways on her Syrian charge. Over time, the Syrians become accepted as if they were kibbutz natives. Hence the ironic title, \"Ben Mesheq\" (\"son of the farm\"), which is the term used for those native to the kibbutz whose parents are full members. The early trauma, however, never leaves. At one point, when another contingent of Syrian children is brought to the kibbutz, the protagonist asks a child his family name. When the child insists that it is the clearly Ashkenazic name of Orenstein, he takes this as a sign of premature assimilationism. Later he finds out that there was indeed such a family in Aleppo. Toward the end, when he and his (biological) father start, but never finish, a conversation about the difficulties of childhood, he realizes how alienated he is from his parents and his heritage. Shamosh underwent such acculturation, albeit in a milder fashion, in Tel Aviv and thus realizes that European Jews were also forcibly transformed.6 What was different in their cases was the fact that since radical Zionist-socialists were themselves Europeans, the culture which they tried to create was both consciously and unconsciously modeled on European ideas and tastes. In the Arab Department of the Palmach, however, Abu Salim and Mirro had to relearn how to act like Arabs. They are called by Arab names. They must penetrate Muslim Arab society. For instance, they are sent in disguise to Arab areas in Palestine, like the mosque at Ramleh, to see if they will pass muster. The unit itself is called the jaamVah, the Arabic term for university. There appears to be a perverse pride in reversing the Europeanization which they have undergone and reacquiring the Arab culture which they were forced to abandon.7\n\n38\n\nWalter P. Zenner\n\nThis paradox is one which Shamosh has explored before in his work. In some stories, like \"Nairn's Lessons,\" Middle Eastern Jews devalue their own culture, in part because of the education they have received in European schools like those of the Alliance.8 They only learn to treasure their background because of a European's interest. But in general the negative stance of Israelis towards Diaspora Judaism, especially that of the Middle East, comes through. Shamosh shows this in his recollections of going to school in Tel Aviv in the 1930s.9 Middle Eastern youth raised in Israel, and even in big cities like Cairo and Aleppo, were encouraged to forget their \"Oriental\" ways. In fact, despite the demand that those selected for espionage must learn Islamic customs and model themselves on Arabs in a wide variety of ways, the intelligence services reflect the state which they serve. For instance, Iser Harel, who was the first director of Shin Bet, the internal Israeli security agency under Prime Minister Ben-Gurion, found Middle Eastern Jews useful as agents, but he generally appointed Europeans to executive positions in the agency. He mistrusted \"professional Orientalists\" as well as Ashkenazim who had \"too much\" contact with Arabs.10 The Experience of Spying In the book Arazim, Shamosh portrays the daily experience of these spies. To begin with, they are employed by novices and they themselves are new to the game. The organization for which they work is engaged in a war, but they are outside the main theater of action. The novel takes place when the fighting between Israel and its enemies was at its height. While Lebanon was involved briefly in fighting Israel, it was a minor player at this time. Beirut, however, was the destination of many Palestinian refugees. When Abu Salim and Mirro arrive in Beirut posing as Palestinian Muslim refugees, they must protect their cover. One way in which they do this is by leaving the hotel and avoiding camps for refugees. Instead, they rent an apartment and buy a grocery store. As Palestinian\n\nEspionage and Cultural Mediation\n\n39\n\nrefugees, they face the prejudices of Lebanese who are quite ambivalent toward these \"fellow-Arabs\" who have landed on their doorsteps. This prefigures the later hostility of the Lebanese against the Palestinians. The two spies also must establish contact with their superiors in Israel. It takes them some time to do this. Meanwhile they spend much time waiting and talking to each other in the store. It is in the chapters set during this early period that they reminisce about their kibbutz experiences. Shamosh emphasizes the fact that these spies are inexperienced young men barely past adolescence. They are lonely, and they seek sexual fulfillment. Abu Salim, going against all that he has learned, persuades Mirro to accompany him on a trip to Aleppo, to visit Abu Salim's mother. This is an extremely dangerous journey, since it involves crossing borders in time of war. Their documents might be spotted as forgeries and Abu Salim could easily blow his cover. Yet his homesickness is so intense that he feels he must see his mother again. Both Abu Salim and Mirro break rules because of their sexual needs. Mirro goes to a house of prostitution, of which Beirut has many. Abu Salim becomes involved with a Maronite girl, whom he eventually marries. The two establish radio contact with Israel. Two comrades are sent to augment their team. They are asked to perform some acts of sabotage. The four spies disagree and fight. One quarrel occurs when another of the four tries to seduce Margo, Abu Salim's girlfriend. Eventually Abu Salim marries Margo and the central command orders him to leave Lebanon. They go to Paris where he reveals to her his true identity. Margo is outraged when she discovers Abu Salim's deception, for she understands that she will be completely cut off from her family. The circumstances, however, give her few options. She must adopt a new identity and accompany Abu Salim to Israel under the name Margalit. Shamosh's focus on the living conditions of spying and on the inevitable betrayals of friendship and love makes us\n\n40\n\nWalter P. Zenner\n\nrealize the human costs of espionage. While Shamosh does not take the cynical view towards espionage which we find in the works of John LeCarre or Len Deighton, the episode in which Abu Salim reveals his true identity to Margo certainly is suggestive of some scenes in LeCarre's work. The Lebanese 9 u & g m i r e Within the novel set in 1948 and 1949, Shamosh comments on what followed in the wake of those years in Lebanon. He makes his heroes face the anti-Palestinian prejudice of the Syrian and Lebanese hosts of the new refugees. This suggests the tensions which will lead to the tragic events of the 1970s and 1980s. He has a Maronite priest tell Abu Salim, whom the priest believes to be a Palestinian Muslim, about the situation of the Maronites. The viewpoint here is not that of Zionists. Many Zionists projected their own ideology onto that of Lebanese Christians. They saw Lebanon as a Christian Israel and the Lebanese Christians as a nation facing genocidal Muslim neighbors. The Maronite priest instead sees the coexistence with Muslims as inevitable. While the Maronites are too proud, he says, to accept the second-class status of dhimmis (protected subjects; in a modern state, second-class citizens), they will also not do anything to endanger themselves by entering an alliance against the Arab world. They are bound to the Arab world, just as they are also part of European Christendom. They have always lived in these two worlds. Uncle Frangois, the monk, is fearful of people like Pierre Gemayel, the leader of the Phalangists. This was one of the parties with which the Israelis would become allied during the Lebanese civil war. Uncle Frangois relates that Gemayel has started forming a private army, as have other Lebanese political leaders. As he points out, Gemayel was sympathetic to the Axis Powers during the Second World War (a hint that Israel is seeking alliances with some strange bedfellows). Frangois is also afraid of the many colonels in Lebanon and elsewhere. The balance is a delicate one, which can be easily upset. In many ways, it parallels the views of Michel Ezra\n\nEspionage and Cultural Mediation\n\n41\n\nSafra, who saw the Ashkenazic Zionists as a threat to the existence of Jews in Syria. Both Uncle Francois and Michel Ezra Safra represent the traditional minority elites of Southwest Asia, minorities which had survived by accommodation. Modern nationalists and significant outsiders threatened these arrangements, like bulls in a china shop. This chapter on the Maronites can be seen as a commentary on the failure of Israeli policy toward Lebanon in the 1980s, a policy which Shamosh observed closely from his kibbutz on the border. In various other passages, especially toward the end of the novel, he relates such foreboding. When the Maronite monk points to the pro-fascist inclinations of the Phalangists, he is commenting on future Israeli allies. Shamosh is here writing about the colossal misunderstanding of the Maronites by the Israelis. During the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, the Israeli government expected the Phalangists to attack the Palestine Liberation Organization in West Beirut, which the Phalange did not do. On the other hand, even hardened Israeli veterans were shocked by the Sabra and Shatila massacres, committed before their eyes by Phalangist units. They found to their surprise that even a Phalangist-led Lebanese government was reluctant to sign a peace treaty with Israel, because this entailed the breaking of ties with other Arab countries. Shamosh's Uncle Frangois is seen as warning the Israelis against projecting their selfimage onto the Lebanese. It is part of the book's warning that Israel must show greater sensitivity to the fabric of social relations of its neighbors. Ironically, the reader in the 1990s knows that the advice of those most knowledgeable about Lebanon was ignored by policymakers in Jerusalem when they decided to invade Lebanon in 1982.11 Many of the efforts of Abu Salim's counterparts had been in vain. When Abu Salim arrives in Haifa from Beirut, he notes the similarity between these two ports nestled against the mountains. Haifa in 1948, however, was a city which was partly destroyed by war and in which the coexistence between Jews and Arabs had resulted in bloodshed and flight, a fate which he feared for Beirut.\n\n42\n\nWalter P. Zenner\n\nA message of this novel for Israel is that while the Ashkenazic elites have often disdained the Levantine culture, it has needed those who bear this tradition. Thus a novel which is a tribute to some of Israel's unsung heroes is also a commentary on Israeli domestic and foreign policies.

What was happening meanwhile among the Sephardim at the same time? (By \"Sephardim\" here we mean, specifically, those Jews in the Middle East and the former Turkish provinces, for Western Sephardim were part and parcel of European culture since the Renaissance.) We have to remember that the tradition of secular knowledge, or the knowledge of Man, or Rationalism, never really died among the Sephardim wherever they were. It was well established since the time of Maimonides, and harks all the way back to patterns developed during the Spanish Golden Age. The aims of the early German Haskalah as we know, were rather modest. The manifesto \"Words of Peace and Truth\" written by N. H.Wessely in 1781, and regarded as the starting point for this movement, advocated a curriculum based on study of the Hebrew language and Bible as a prerequisite for Talmudic study, and study of secular and useful branches of human knowledge, such as arithmetic, geography, and such. (This curriculum itself may have been based on the educational curriculum of Etz-Hayim Sephardic School of Amsterdam, where Wessely's family had settled.) Now, it was always the practice among Sephardim to have a thorough grounding in the Hebrew language and Bible before studying Talmud. A modicum of secular, or \"worldly\" knowledge, Derekh Eretz, was always expected of the traditional Talmid Hacham, according to lines set by Maimonides. Therefore Sephardim really did not need a movement or special permission either to study the Bible or secular studies, against which there was no prohibition, either official or unofficial. When modernity came, with the advent of European settlers and commercial enterprise, these influences were quietly absorbed for the most part. There was no equivalent to shocks that rocked European Jewry and split communities and individuals. The Sephardim were touched by modernity at about the same time as the Jews of Central Europe,\n\nAn Authentic Human Voice\n\n45\n\ncertainly no later than the Jews of Eastern Europe. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt (1798) is a turning point. Arabic history marks the onset of the European impact at this time. The higher classes, as is true of European Jews, were exposed much earlier, due to their wider commercial contacts. The first Alliance Israelite Universelle School was founded in Morocco the same year that it was founded in Russia (1860). Unlike in Eastern Europe, however, these schools encountered very little resistance. On the contrary, they were welcomed throughout the Sephardic diaspora. The official rabbinate took up its cause and received its emissaries with respect and encouragement. What is amazing actually is how little resistance there was. The official rabbis of North Africa, for example, sent their own children to the Alliance schools. The impression that Sephardim for the most part were only exposed to modernity upon their arrival in Israel is, of course, totally false. The communities of North Africa, Egypt, Turkey, and the Balkans were exposed to Western culture, languages, and technology at about the same time as Eastern European Jews. Whence then is the difference? The fundamental difference is that Sephardim went directly from tradition to European education without the mediating epoch of Haskalah or Hebraic/Jewish secularism. This is the major difference. For it is not a difference of chronology or degree, but of kind. When we say that Ashkenazim are \"European\" it is true only in this sense: that in the space of several generations, they have succeeded in accomplishing what Europeans have been trying to do since the Renaissance. They forged a new Jewish identity on the basis of nationality, rather than religion. They made it possible, for those who wish it, to identify as Jewish on a basis other than religious. This is something Sephardim have never done collectively. This is the most outstanding achievement of Ashkenazi Jewry in modern times, whether one likes it or not. It goes beyond any individual achievement of an Einstein or Freud, because it was the collective achievement of European Jewry. Interestingly, Jewish secularism, as an ideology, did not originate in Western Europe, among\n\n46\n\nAbraham Marthan\n\nthe more assimilated and emancipated Jewries, but precisely among the Eastern European Jews of traditional background. The theoretical foundation of the secular Jewish ethos were provided by ex-Yeshiva boys, such as Ahad-Haam, Berdichevsky and Bialik, making it possible for one to be both Jewish and secular at once. There was just no Sephardic Ahad-Haam! Not that there was no Sephardi intellectual equal to him in European culture, intellect, or originality. Someone like Elija Benamozegh (1822-1900) is at least his equal in these respects. But the latter remained wholly within the religious tradition. When Sephardim made contact with European culture, they made it directly and without the mediating stage of Hebrew or Jewish secularism. Equally important, they made their contacts as individuals, not collectively. Even when they established communal schools to teach secular subjects, these schools taught secular subjects, but they were not secular schools. There was no Jewish secular ideology, expressed in collective communal terms and institutions. Contacts with and exposure to Western culture on the part of Sephardim has been both broad and deep. Only this fact can explain that the leading literary critic in the world today is a North African Jew, Jacques Derrida, born in Algeria. A leading contemporary French poet is an Egyptian Jew, Edmund Jabes. There have been Sephardi Nobel Prize winners in literature (Canetti) and in the sciences (Baruj Benazzeraf). But this individual achievement does not help the Sephardim vis-a-vis the Ashkenazim, any more than the achievements of a Freud or an Einstein helped European Jews, for the struggle is a communal one, one between groups, not one-to-one, the achievements of one individual against another. Proportionate to their number in the total world Jewish population, individual Sephardim have probably contributed as much to modern Western culture as did their Ashkenazi brethren. The fact is, however, that Sephardim stood collectively outside of Jewish secularism—the hallmark of the \"Founding\n\nAn Authentic Human Voice\n\n47\n\nFathers\" of the State—and did not as such play a role in the process of the formation of this Jewish secularism. (The process is just now taking place in Israel.) Even when Sephardim practice a seemingly secular way of life, it is only de facto. There has not been a collective Sephardi secular Jewish ethos. It may come about, it may not. For Sephardim distinguish between being modernized, mostly relating to technique and externals, and being secularized, which is an inner ideological transformation. In this respect, current Sephardi writing in Israel presents an interesting phenomenon. While individually the writers may not pursue a traditional way of life, their attitude to tradition is that of respect and even empathy. Amnon Shamosh's writing is of such character. Other Sephardi writers would place this positive attitude to tradition as the most distinctive trait of Sephardim and what sets them apart from the majority of Israeli Ashkenazim and from the dominant Israeli ethos. This also may prevent many of them from being regarded as \"mainstream,\" for modern Hebrew letters bear the indelible stamp of secularism, as set by \"canonical\" writers such as Bialik, Berdichevsky, and Brenner. Secularism is indeed the official religion of the contemporary Hebrew literary \"republic.\" II. The Emergence of Sephardi Writing in the Seventies In the 1960s a new kind of writing emerged in Israel, what has become known as the New Wave of Israeli fiction, represented by such authors as A. B. Yehoshua and Amos Oz, among others, who rebelled both against the style and the themes of the preceding literary generation known as the Palmach Generation or the Generation of the War of Independence. In the 1970s, a newer wave washed ashore. This time it was a wave of Sephardi writers, both in prose and poetry. The seventies witnessed an outburst of creative energies among Sephardi writers. New names seemed to emerge out of nowhere: Erez Bitton, Shalom Razabi, Shimon Balas, Sami\n\n48\n\nAbraham Marthan\n\nMichael, and Amnon Shamosh. Shamosh first made his mark in prose, then began publishing his poetry in the 1980s. III. Amnon Shamosh—The Lives of the Author Amnon Shamosh was born in Aleppo in 1929, to Reina Cabasso and Moshe Shamosh. The mother traced her descent to the Ben-Yahya family of Andalusia, Spain, and the father to a family which never left the Middle East. Amnon was the youngest of eight children in a family which included six brothers and two sisters. His father was a silversmithembroiderer who specialized in the making of curtains for the Holy Ark. He died quite young in Aleppo—when Amnon was seven years of age—after some years of illness and having experienced the indignity of seeing his noble profession made obsolete and replaced by machines. Following immigration patterns customary among Syrian Jews, two of the brothers left for Mexico, before our author was born, to scout new territory for the family's livelihood. The rest migrated to Palestine in 1938, when Amnon was a child of nine; his eldest brother Isaac had been promised and obtained a job teaching Arabic literature at the Hebrew University. The mother was educated in the Alliance school, but her education was interrupted at age fifteen due to her marriage. She continued, however, to educate herself and read endlessly in French. At home, Amnon was to write later, they spoke Arabic, wrote French, and prayed in Hebrew. Circumstances were comfortable enough; typically middle class, the family was sufficiently well provided for to afford an Armenian nurse and to move to Jumiliyeh (a European-style quarter of Aleppo), living in a private home, with a balcony and a porch. In his parents' home he experienced, he says, a true encounter of diverse cultures, of East and West, of Hebrew, Arabic, and French culture. Father had two sets of clothing, one European and the other Middle Eastern, depending on the occasion and the company. Mother always dressed in the European fashion, with dresses she sewed herself according to the latest catalogs from Paris. She wore a coat and a hat a la mode, and many gold bracelets on her arms, adding Near\n\nAn Authentic Human Voice\n\n49\n\nEastern accents to her appearance. She also used perfumes and rouge that were imported from France. At home they played records of Edith Piaf and Maurice Chevalier as well as of the popular Egyptian singers Abdul-Wahab and Umm Kulthum. Amnon Shamosh thinks that he inherited his intellectual curiosity from his mother who loved to read. She read with a magnifying glass and loved to tell stories (about that later). His artistic bent he attributes to his father, who did delicate work with threads of gold and silver, and which the poet immortalized in his poem \"Curtain.\" His own openness and tolerance of cultural differences and influences he attributes to the ambience in his parents' home in which East and West dwelt together peacefully. In the Palestine of the time, he lived in Tel Aviv at the house of his second brother Joseph, an editor of an Arabic paper of the Histadrut, and attended Bialik (elementary) School. Afterwards he enrolled in the Herzeliah Gymnasium, became a member of the youth movement, and upon graduation in 1946 joined the underground, serving in the Palmach. He was one of the original founders of Kibbutz Ma'ayan Baruch in the Upper Galilee, on the Syrian-Lebanese border. He remains there to this day, and has served successively as a shepherd, youth counsellor, kibbutz secretary, school teacher, and principal. He undertook various missions abroad, ineluding one to find the missing pages of the Aleppo Codex, the Kether. He acquired his higher education at the Midrasha BeitBerl, and graduated from the Hebrew University. He first tried out his hand in writing several children's books, the first of which came out in 1966. But his mature literary career began in earnest comparatively late, in the 1970s, when the author was past forty, with a collection of short stories called Ahoti Kallah (My Sister the Bride, 1974). It was rejected by the Worker's Publishing House (Sifriat Ha Poalim), and it was published by a private company, Massada, with the encouragement of its editor, Amir Gilboa. His greatest fame rests on his novel Michel Ezra Safra and Sons, published\n\n50\n\nAbraham Marthan\n\nin 1978, and serialized on Israeli television for seven weeks, ultimately winning the Israel Television's Harp of David prize.1 He himself enumerates the sources, or the founts, of his inspiration and creativity: parents' home, Aleppo, Agnon, Sholom Aleichem, Sephardic poetry, and Ma'ayan Baruch. In his autobiographical sketch which he called OptoBiography, from \"optic,\" he defines his world and the way he looks at the world. At age nine in the elementary school he was prescribed glasses: he \"put. . . Israeli glasses on his Eastern eyes.\"2 Then came bifocals, then the kibbutz outlook. Thus he sees the world with \"triple lenses\": the basic Eastern eyes, Israeli, and finally kibbutz, lenses (his Socialist education). All this is in addition to that which he sees in his dreams, i.e., the vision of the creative artist which we suppose to be the fourth dimension of his world.3 IV. Amnon Shamosh—The Poetry Amnon Shamosh has published to date two volumes of poetry: Spanish Diwan, (Massada, 1981), and Upon a Harp with a Solemn Sound (Sifriat Poalim, 1984). His first poetic collection, Spanish Diwan, contains many interesting experiments in which he tried to emulate the poetics and the high elegance of the Hebrew poetry of the medieval Spanish period. Diwan is the name given by Sephardic poets to their collection of secular verse. It means an official register. In many places in his writings and public lectures, Shamosh confesses his love and admiration for the Hebrew poetry of the Spanish Golden Age, which he imbibed at home, sung to the tunes of secular Middle Eastern music. Later on he was to study this poetry at the Herzeliah Gymnasium with the teacher-poet David Shimoni and at the Hebrew University with Dan Pagis. He regards this poetry as the apex, the very height of the Hebrew creative genius, anytime, any place. But he expresses disappointment that his teachers, who did so well in analysis of genres, forms, and patterns, treated this poetry surgically as a museum piece, as something exotic and ornamental, without a relevance to the present. They treated it coldly, analytically, as one would a\n\nAn Authentic Human Voice\n\n51\n\nspecimen in the laboratory, without love or affection. But even if love and affection were present, it was the sort of love one has for grandma, a beloved and favored figure, in a remote and abstract way, not like love for a woman of flesh and blood, with whom one might have a real, vital contact. He was amazed and disappointed that someone like the late Dan Pagis, who really established the code of Medieval Hebrew Poetics with such thoroughness and painstaking research and imagination, shows no affinity at all to this poetry in his own verse—neither in form nor in content. This, he said, he set to correct. In his first book he experimented with writing in the genres, metrics, and rhyme schemes of medieval Spanish poetry, trying to articulate contemporary topics in archaic forms, and using a variety of medieval devices such as alliteration and assonance, homonyms, play on words, allusion to Biblical texts, the mosaic style, double meanings, etc. This attempt too, was rebuffed by Sifriat Poalim as obsolete. And here again it was Massada Publishing House and its enthusiastic editor, Amir Gilboa, who came to the rescue. Actually, the collection contains three diwans—the Spanish diwan, a French diwan (fruit of a visit to Paris, written in the modern idiom and in free verse, in the contemporary fashion comme il faut), and an Israeli diwan—reflecting Israeli experience and environment. This last section closes with the poem \"Vidduy Hagadol,\" \"The Great Confession.\" This seems to me the heart of the book; it also provides a clue to the poet's inner world. The Great Confession My mother, used to come visiting every summer Her eyes tired of reading her past weighing heavily she would tell stories and tell\n\n60 Abraham Marthan\n\nWhat did she recount and what she did not her voice melodious like the lute and palms of her hands explaining her bracelets resounding gold to gold like those winged sayings in her mouth over which time had no dominion and I all of me an ear that was tightly sealed. Occupied in getting the Kibbutz out of the mire to move things forward and who (well, really) has time for Mother A curtain between the voice of her yesterdays and the ear intent on the noise of the collective and its projects she tells— of Ben Zeruyah and the powers of the amulet and I shake my head as if listening One summer she did not come and in the winter she departed the world and the troubles that are bound in the bond of life\n\nAn Authentic Human Voice\n\n53\n\nThe spring passed summer expired and in the autumn my hand began to inscribe stories I read and I found the world of Mother A culture of life that departed to its world perhaps my ear was blocked but my heart awake and perhaps the words permeated in some other way I wanted to tell my stories in the ear of Mother I sought to hear more and more from her but Mother who used to be every summer with me (across that partition) was— and is no more.4 (Kibbutz Ma'ayan Baruch, Yom Kippur Eve 1980) We have already mentioned the fondness of the author's mother for reading and telling stories. In \"The Great Confession\" the poet expresses mea culpa on a great opportunity\n\n54\n\nAbraham Marthan\n\nthat he missed in turning a deaf ear to his mother's stories. The mother represented another world. Though festive, colorful, and musical, it seemed to be static, irrelevant, and remote, while the son was dynamic and moving forward (or so he saw himself), occupied in everyday, practical affairs. After her departure the son begins to reconsider. He realizes what he missed. At the same time it dawns on him how much he owes her. As her words permeated him in some mysterious way he also begins to write stories—a talent perhaps he inherited from her. Now he wants to tell her his stories. But now she is no more to hear what he has to tell. Yet, she lives—in her son's stories. The latter volume, Upon a Harp with a Solemn Sound, is much more conventional in technique, i.e., more modern in its poetic language and forms. The author seems to have abandoned the experiment with medieval patterns, after perhaps having exhausted the possibilities of these forms. The book opens with a poem called \"Anna and I,\" comparing the author's experience with that of Anne Frank, who was born the same year as our author. This discovery dawned on him when he visited her house in Amsterdam, accompanied by his own daughter, who was then Anne's age when she was taken away. She wrote a diary, he wrote a diary; she wrote from left to right, he wrote from right to left; hers was preserved, his is lost. Who is to say then which one of them has truly survived? This is typical of the spirit of the whole book and could be said to be typical of his entire oeuvre, whether in prose or poetry. And that is to find analogies of Jewish experience, whether it be of the East or the West, Ashkenazi or Sephardi, Israel or the Diaspora. He is imbued with a strong sense of Jewish unity of the pre-Emancipation variety. In this he harks back to an earlier tradition of Hebrew letters, before the great scramble for \"civil rights\" and the eagerness of Jews to identify with their countries of citizenship, rather than with their historical brethren, wherever they are. Another trait of this book, and his work in general, is its humanistic temper, which almost gives it an old-fashioned\n\nAn Authentic Human Voice\n\n55\n\nring, more akin to the poetry of the pre-state t h a n to the c u r r e n t scene. One does not find the skepticism, the cynicism, a n d the fashionable, sometimes even pseudo, sophistication t h a t characterize some c u r r e n t Hebrew poetry. Many of his p o e m s vibrate with moral ardor, rare in the poetry of t h e p r e s e n t . For i n s t a n c e h e h a s a p o e m called \"Ani Ma'ashim,\" a play on t h e expression \"Ani-Ma'amin,\" a n d also reminiscent of Emile Zola's f a m o u s \"J'accuse.\" In this poem he p o u r s scathing w r a t h on the Syrian regime which is holding hostage four h u n d r e d young J e w i s h women, who will never be able to b e a r or raise families. But he is evenh a n d e d in his moral indignation, for he h a s even more scathing words for the p e r p e t r a t o r s of the S a b r a a n d Shatila m a s s a c r e s . The poem \"Upon the Slaughter\" is constructed on the p a t t e r n of Bialik's f a m o u s poem on the Kishineff Pogrom. Except now the victims are n o n - J e w s . But however s h a r p is his moral stance, there is always his saving h u m o r t h a t takes the edge off his rage. This is d u e in a large m e a s u r e to his deft exploitation of the wonderful potentialities inherent in the Hebrew language, its associative power a n d multiple layers of meaning, which he mines with great skill. His is a poetry t h a t cares. It is also a poetry t h a t laugh"
