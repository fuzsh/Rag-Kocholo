        "text": "The academic field of Israeli cinema studies has come more fully into its own over the past two decades, emerging as a vibrant and rich area of research. The following article aims to take stock of the field’s past and present, providing a map to its major coordinates and key examples that attest to its depth. Furthermore, it will chart out various possibilities for the field’s future development, which will potentially allow it to outstrip its original argumentative frameworks.\n\nThe problematic representation of Mizrahi Jews in Israeli films has been extensively researched over the past few decades. The subject was first thoroughly analyzed in Ella Shohat's comprehensive 1989 study, Israeli Cinema: East/West and the Politics of Representation. In her book she uses a Marxist approach, claiming that Israeli films express the views of the Ashkenazi hegemony and help preserve its supremacy. Shohat discusses the modes through which an Orientalist dichotomy dominated Eretz-Israeli and Israeli cinema from the outset. In films that portrayed an encounter between Ashkenazi Jews and Mizrahi Jews, the former represented Western values-they were rational, enlightened, and compassionate-while Mizrahi Jews were mainly depicted as primitive, inferior, and violent. Over the years, scholars have pointed to other features in the cinematic representation of Ashkenazi-Mizrahi relations in Israeli Bourekas films, which were dominant from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s, but Shohat's preliminary observations regarding an Orientalist dichotomy in the 1950s have become generally accepted in Israeli film studies. This article revisits the perceived Orientalist dichotomy through an analysis of 1950s films that focus on encounters between Mizrahi Jews and Holocaust survivors (Ashkenazi Jews) and their integration into Israeli society. These films include Tent City [Ir Ha'ohalim] (Leopold Aryeh Lahola, 1951), Faithful City [Kirya Ne'emana] (Józef Lejtes, 1952), and Hill 24 Doesn't Answer [Givaa 24 Eina Ona] (Thorold Dickinson, 1955). The article claims that in these films Mizrahi Jews are shown as integrating more quickly than Holocaust survivors. Conversely, Holocaust survivors are presented in the films-much like they were in many other cultural realms at that time-as a broken people who ultimately assimilated, albeit with much difficulty.\n\nThe problematic representation of Mizrahi Jews in Israeli films has been extensively researched over the past few decades.

The article claims that in these films Mizrahi Jews are shown as integrating more quickly than Holocaust survivors. Conversely, Holocaust survivors are presented in the films—much like they were in many other cultural realms at that time—as a broken people who ultimately assimilated, albeit with much difficulty.\n\nThe article explores several Israeli documentary films of the past fifteen years which dare to touch on the under-researched subject of romantic relationships between Israeli Jews and German non-Jews, in three different documentary sub-genres. The main premise here is that overall, the heightened emphasis in Israel on Holocaust commemoration, the unique insights of second and third generation survivor offspring, the rise of globalization and the attraction felt by contemporary Israelis to Berlin have inspired the production of films that tackle a subject once considered taboo. Unlike current Israeli documentaries however, which treat political and social issues like the plight of the Palestinians, immigrant workers, asylum seekers, etc., and focus on “the other” or “the stranger”, the films discussed here, burdened by Holocaust memory, foreground the JewishIsraeli side of the relationship, thus precluding an in-depth representation of the German side.\n\nIn the Oscar award–winning film Son of Saul (László Nemes, Hungary, 2015), Holocaust atrocities are presented directly, using traditional cinematic devices. No Israeli film has ever dared do this. The Holocaust has appeared in Israeli cinema through indirect depictions, represented by the character portrayals of Holocaust survivors. The Holocaust memories of these characters were frequently silenced and, instead, their cinematic construction was exploited to allegorically reflect the Zionist ideology of the time. Under the Domim Tree (Etz Ha’domim Tafus; Eli Cohen, Israel, 1994) is a film that prominently portrays Holocaust-survivor characters in three leading roles. Its release coincided with a period of radical change in Israel. At the time two watershed agreements were signed between Israel and its former Arab enemies. Analyzing the film’s depiction of Holocaust survivors makes it possible to examine the shifts in hegemonic Zionist ideology that took place during those significant years.\n\nThe Cellar (Hamartef, Natan Gross, 1963) is a groundbreaking film—the only Israeli fictional film created by Holocaust survivors regarding the Holocaust and its aftermath from the perspective of a Holocaust survivor protagonist. Yet it has been largely ignored by studies on the representation of the Holocaust in Israeli cinema and has not been attributed proper significance. This article is the first to give center stage to this pioneering film. It shows that this under researched film was the marker of change, a first cinematic attempt at relating the story of Holocaust survivors with complexity and depth, which threw aside the shallow narrative of national redemption in Israel, that characterized Israeli cinema in the 1940s and 1950s. Instead it focused on 1930s Germany and the return to Germany after World War II, periods which had thus far been neglected in Israeli cinema. Moreover, the article highlights The Cellar as exceptional in comparison to fictional films produced after 1963, which focus mainly on the lives of Holocaust survivors in Israel, and which disregard the themes of life in 1930s Europe, as well as the attempts by survivors to return home after World War II\n\nThis course will engage the various ways through which the filmic medium has portrayed Israel's complex matrix of cultural identities. Oscillating between considerations of social history and film aesthetics, the different sessions will address the major factors shaping Israeli culture: war and the demands of battlefield heroism; the trauma of the Holocaust; the Mizrahi-Ashkenazi ethnic divide; the contemporary immigration experience; engagements with the Palestinian Other; gender politics; queer identity and the threat of \"pinkwashing\"; kibbutz life and the decline of collectivism; and the challenge of Judaism to Israeli secularity. Through our discussions, class participants will gain a more comprehensive perspective on Israeli society than is usually offered in mainstream US media, as well as acquire intimate familiarity with certain milestones of Israeli filmmaking, most of which have rarely been screened outside of Israel's national borders."
