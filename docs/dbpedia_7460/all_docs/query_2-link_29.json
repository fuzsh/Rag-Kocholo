        "text": "In 1989, in a poll conducted by the Israeli press and the Israel Film Institute, she was chosen “Actress of the Decade.” Even better – after starring in or playing leading roles in more than 50 films spanning four decades, Ms. Almagor was awarded the Israeli Oscar in 1997 for Lifetime Contribution to Israeli Cinema.\n\nAlthough film audiences in America might not be familiar with her work – most of it is, after all, in Hebrew – Ms. Almagor still won awards for Best Actress at the 1969 Chicago and Atlanta Film Festivals, and has garnered the Best Film Actress award in her own country five times as well as at international film festivals in San Remo, Italy and Berlin (1989).\n\nBy Frank D. Quattrone – Ticket Editor\n\nThey call her the “First Lady of Israeli Cinema.” In her native land, Gila Almagor is a national treasure. Not hard to understand why.\n\nIn 1989, in a poll conducted by the Israeli press and the Israel Film Institute, she was chosen “Actress of the Decade.” Even better – after starring in or playing leading roles in more than 50 films spanning four decades, Ms. Almagor was awarded the Israeli Oscar in 1997 for Lifetime Contribution to Israeli Cinema.\n\nAlthough film audiences in America might not be familiar with her work – most of it is, after all, in Hebrew – Ms. Almagor still won awards for Best Actress at the 1969 Chicago and Atlanta Film Festivals, and has garnered the Best Film Actress award in her own country five times as well as at international film festivals in San Remo, Italy and Berlin (1989).\n\nOn Sunday, July 30, local audiences will have an opportunity to meet the famous actress in person and enjoy her most acclaimed film when she comes to Beth Sholom Congregation in Elkins Park to accept the second annual Jack Wolgin Award for Outstanding Achievement in Israeli Cinema.\n\nFollowing the presentation of the award, Ms. Almagor’s most acclaimed film, “The Summer of Aviya,” will be screened. An autobiographical work based on one summer in the life of a 10-year-old girl in 1950s Israel, it is widely considered the crowning achievement of her distinguished career.\n\nAviya, the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, lived in orphanages most of her life. Her mother, who had been a partisan fighter during the war with a number tattooed on her arm, trod a thin line between sanity and madness. This was the summer she would return home.\n\nMs. Almagor admitted, in a telephone conversation from Israel, “Aviya is the girl I was at that time with my own mother. She was a survivor – period. She ran away when all her 12 siblings and family were killed by the genocide in Poland. Because she had survived, she took on the guilt.”\n\nIn the film, which Ms. Almagor also wrote and produced, plays the lead role of her mother. She adapted the screenplay from her international best seller (1987) of the same name – a book she never thought she would, or could, write. “It just happened,” she said. “I never thought I could tell that story. I carried it inside of me for so long. It had to be written. It’s as if it were already written.”\n\nSo successful has that story been that it has been translated into more than 10 languages, including Chinese. It has become required reading for students in the Israeli educational system. It inspired not only the award-winning film of the same name but a one-woman stage show starring Gila Almagor herself. And it led to a sequel, “Under the Domim Tree,” published in 1992. Set four years after the time of “The Summer of Aviya,” it too was adapted into a highly successful movie (1995), also written and produced by Ms. Almagor.\n\nAt present, the actress/producer/author/screenwriter is working on her third book. This too is about children and how they come to grips with love and death. But it is a totally original work, not autobiographical, as were the first two.\n\nIs that enough to make you dizzy? But that’s not all. At a time when many lesser lights would be considering their retirement, Gila Almagor is still very active in Israel’s performing arts scene. She can be seen on Israeli television in the dramatic serial, “The Other Woman” and will soon star in a film drama directed by her good friend Don Wolman.\n\nSome compare her with Helen Hayes, for years one of America’s most beloved and celebrated actresses and a long-time champion of artistic and humanitarian causes.\n\n“You’ll never see me sitting on a beach, wasting time,” she says. She couldn’t imagine that ever happening. Recently she was elected to the City Council of Tel Aviv, her first venture into politics, and has assumed responsibility for arts and culture in Israel’s capital. In her spare time, she helped found the Israeli Artists’ Association and has established the Gila Almagor Wish Foundation, which provides needy children with toys, trips, computers and other gifts that would be unavailable to them without her generosity.\n\n“I don’t think I’m a prima donna,” she says. “I’m a slave, a hard-working person. I’m just so grateful for my good luck and my family.”\n\nYes, she is happily married to Jacob Agmon, the former Artistic and General Director of the Habima National Theatre of Israel. Her own career in acting began at the age of 17, when she became the youngest person ever accepted into that acclaimed acting company. A mainstay on the Israeli stage ever since, she has also won seven awards as Israel’s Best Theater Actress.\n\nShe says, with a hearty laugh, “We have two children, two dogs and many friends. I take nothing for granted.”\n\nMs. Almagor also helps nurture the next generation of filmmakers, contributing to the production of at least one student film a year at the highly regarded Sam Spiegel School of Film in Jerusalem. “When I smell talent,” she likes to say, “I support it all the way.”\n\nAlthough her appearance is expected to be the highlight of the Jack Wolgin Film Festival from July 29 to 31, Artistic Director Eric Goldman and his staff have planned a full weekend of films for adults and children at the stunning synagogue designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nThe program includes the East Coast premiere of Roland Suso Richter’s award-winning 1999 film, “After the Truth” (German with English subtitles). This is the story of a young German lawyer and Holocaust scholar who is kidnapped and brought to South America to meet an old man who claims to be the notorious Dr. Josef Mengele. The film will be shown Saturday evening, July 29, at 9 p.m. after a wine and cheese reception with guest speaker, screenwriter Christopher Riley.\n\nThe program on Sunday, July 30, includes the free family screening of the children’s films, “Alef…Bet…Blast-Off: One Big Family” (10 a.m.) and “Alef…Bet…Blast-Off: Fixing the World” (10:30 a.m.), both for ages 3 – 10, followed by a puppet demonstration at 11 a.m. by Len Levitt, co-creator of the films. Other children’s film on Sunday’s bill are “Children of Jerusalem: Asya” (ages 7 and up, 11:30 a.m.), and two short animated films from the National Film Board of Canada – “The Street” and the Pennsylvania premiere of “Village of Idiots” (teen to adult, 12 noon).\n\nAlso shown on July 30 will be Treasures from the Steven Spielberg Jewish Film Archive in Jerusalem (12:30 p.m.) and the premiere of the drama “As If Nothing Happened” (Hebrew with English subtitles, 2 p.m.) – the guest speaker for both films will be Marilyn Koolik, director of the Spielberg Archive; and the Pennsylvania premiere of “Flames of Revolt,” a powerful film about the controversial role played by the Irgun in the establishment of the State of Israel (3 p.m., with guest speaker Dr. Ofira Seliktar, Professor of Political Science at Gratz College).\n\nSunday evening, of course, starting at 7 p.m., will be Gila Almagor’s latest moment to shine. She will also be on hand at 12 noon on Monday, July 31, to sign copies of her books, “The Summer of Aviya” and “Under the Domim Tree.” At 1 p.m., Moshe Mizrahi’s film, “Every Time We Say Goodbye,” with Tom Hanks and Gila Almagor, will be shown.\n\nThe final film on the program, at 7:30 p.m., will be the world premiere of “Make Me a Match,” a documentary about Jews searching for love. Directors Allen Mondell and Cynthia Salzman Mondell will be the guest speakers.\n\nProducers of the Festival are Adele Leonard and Leonard Sobel.
