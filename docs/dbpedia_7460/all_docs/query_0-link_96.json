Each one deals with very different problems. Aviya attempts to find information about her deceased father; Yurek tries to prevent authorities from sending his best friend to a boarding school while Yola copes with the news that her father has just died in Poland. Finally, Mira must fight the two people who claim to be her estranged parents and who have taken her to court to win custody. Mira knows in her heart that these two are no relation.~ Sandra Brennan, All Movie Guide"
