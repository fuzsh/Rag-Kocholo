        "text": "755. [Joseph, Daniel, and the Spirit in Dream Interpretation] Richard S. Briggs, \"Discerning the Ways of God beyond Israel: Joseph, Daniel, and the Spirit in Dream Interpretation,\" The Spirit Says, 113-29 [see #910].\n\nHow shall we let the OT contribute to our understanding of the role of the Spirit in interpretation? If we had an OT account of someone interpreting a written text—especially a sacred one on its way toward later canonical status—then this might serve as a model of a biblical (OT) depiction of \"biblical interpretation\"—admitting that this would be a slightly anachronistic way of putting things. We could then explore the role of the Spirit in such activity. However, allowing for minor exceptions, we do not have such a depiction, at least with regard to the interpretation of a written text. What we do have instead are portrayals of interpretation as this is exercised with regard to dreams in the OT, especially in the cases of Joseph and Daniel. I therefore offer a study here of the OT portraits of Joseph and Daniel as interpreters of dreams, with a view to discerning what such portraits tell us about the role of the Spirit in interpretation.\n\nMy argument proceeds in the following steps. An introductory section clarifies how the OT might address our understanding of the interpretation of Scripture in a range of ways and identifies texts that actually talk of interpretation. Such texts turn out to be dream accounts, along with the corresponding accounts of their interpretation. In practice, our main focus will be on the stories of Joseph and Daniel, with only a brief look at other OT dream accounts. A second section analyzes the Joseph and Daniel accounts, asking how dream interpretation is portrayed in these, in particular in connection with the work of the Spirit. In conclusion, I examine how the role of the Spirit in interpretation more generally is illuminated by such concerns with dream interpretation. In particular, I shall argue that a key element of these portrayals is that of a faithful Israelite interpreting the dreams of non-Israelites by relating them to a wider picture of God's purposes and nature.

Burton, \"Glory in the Heights and in the Deep: Some Implications of Semantic Analysis for a Biblical Theology of Glory,\" From Words to Meaning, 91-107 [see #911].\n\nThis chapter has explored two very different conceptual metaphors, \"glory in the heights\" and \"glory in the deep,\" each highlighting different aspects of the term glory's rich theological meaning in the Bible. The conceptions of glory brought to the fore by some metaphors will be more prototypical than those highlighted by others—depending on how readily available in the Hebrew speaker's mind the given conception may be. … [End Page 257]\n\nHow does all this help my next interlocutor, who wants to know \"what glory is\"? Obviously, what I have discussed here is just the above first two pieces of the puzzle; the continuation of the project will not only add more such pieces but will make it possible to consider the relative centrality, or prototypicality, of the various..."
