Synopsis

In 1953, Israel was a brand new country trying to find its bearings and struggling with the thousands of traumas left by the Holocaust and years of war. Based on the autobiographical book by Gila Almagor, "Under the Domim Tree" is set in a boarding school for teenagers orphaned by the Holocaust. Some of them had survived concentration camps, others had been in hiding for years. Many did not even know whether their families were alive or dead. Together, they had to try to live a "normal" life, in spite of the nightmares that haunted them.
