        "text": "Sunil Dutt was born on June 6, 1930 . Born as Balraj Dutt was an Indian Bollywood actor, producer, director and politician. He was the cabinet minister for Youth Affairs and Sports in the Manmohan Singh government (2004-2005). His son, Sanjay Dutt, is currently also a Bollywood star.\n\nSunil Dutt was born in the village of Khurd (now in Pakistan ). His family moved to India during the Partition of India (1947). In Mumbai, he joined Jai Hind College as an undergraduate and took up a job. A stroke of luck fetched him an additional assignment with an advertisement company and he could supplement his income by a few hundred more rupees.\n\nStarting out in radio, Sunil Dutt was a hugely popular announcer on the Hindi Service of Radio Ceylon, the oldest radio station in South Asia. He moved to acting in Hindi films. Sunil Dutt acted in several successful films from 1956. Sunil Dutt bagged his first film, 'Railway Platform' in 1955, co-starring Nalini Jaywant. Sunil Dutt became a star with Mehboob Khan's 'Mother India' and simultaneously fell in love with Nargis when he saved her from death by fire.\n\nSunil Dutt married Nargis on March 11, 1958. He had 1 son and 2 daughters. Sunil Dutt introduced his son Sanjay in Rocky in 1981. In that same year, his wife died of pancreatic cancer. He set up Nargis Dutt foundation in memory of his wife for the cure of cancer patients. Sunil Dutt was also a sponsor of the India Project, a Nobel Peace Prize-nominated organization akin to Operation Smile for the treatment of Indian children with facial deformities.\n\nSunil Dutt then did several films where the heroine had the better roles, like 'Sujata', 'Bandini', 'Sadhana', 'Amrapali' and 'Mera Saaya'. His first film as a producer, 'Yeh Raaste Hain Pyar Ke' in 1963 dared to show the heroine actually commiting adultery. In his next production, 'Mujhe Jeene Do' in 1963, he played a dacoit who kidnaps the heroine and also kills for profit. He risked playing a cripple in 'Khandaan' and the buffoon in 'Padosan'. After his film 'Reshma Aur Shera' bombed at the box-office, Sunil began playing safe with films like 'Heera' and 'Zakhmee'.\n\nIn 1984 he joined the Congress (I) party and was elected to Parliament for five terms from the constituency of Mumbai North West. His political career was halted for some years in the early 1990s when he worked to free his son from jail after he was arrested following Hindu-Muslim clashes in Mumbai.\n\nSunil Dutt died of a heart attack at his residence in Bandra, Mumbai in his sleep. His seat in Parliament will be contested by his daughter, Priya Dutt.\n\nAWARDS AND HONOURS :\n\n1963 - Filmfare Best Actor Award, Mujhe Jeeno Do\n\n1965 - Filmfare Best Actor Award, Khandaan\n\n1995 - Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award\n\n1998 - Star Screen Lifetime Achievement Award\n\n2001 - Zee Cine Award for Lifetime Achievement\n\nSunil Dutt was a recipient of the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian award from the Government of India.\n\nABOUT HIM :\n\nBirth name: Balraj Dutt\n\nDate of Birth: 6 June 1930\n\nDate of death: 25 May 2005\n\nHeight: 6' or 1.83 m\n\nCity: Jhelum\n\nCountry: Pakistan\n\nSiblings: Sister and Brother\n\nChildren: Son Sanjay Dutt, Daughters Namrata and Priya\n\nMarital status: Married\n\nSpouse: Nargis\n\nEducation: Mumbai's Jai Hind college\n\nOther facts: He was brought up by his uncle\n\nOccupation: Bollywood Actor/Indian Politician\n\nDebut Film: Railway Platform\n\nFILMOGRAPHY :"
