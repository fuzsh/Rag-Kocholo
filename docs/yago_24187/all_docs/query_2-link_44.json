Renowned for his exceptional performances in cult classics like Mother India, Sadhna, and Padosan, he captivated audiences with his charm. Starting his cinematic journey with Railway Platform in 1955, Sunil Dutt’s final film role was in the iconic Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.

His contributions to the industry were recognised with the prestigious Padma Shri award. His legacy continues to inspire.\n\nOn his death anniversary, let’s take a look at 10 interesting trivia from his life and films:\n\nDuring the partition, when Sunil Dutt was 18 years old, he was saved by a man named Jacob and his family.\n\nHe began his career in Radio Ceylon which is the first Asian radio broadcasting station.\n\nSunil Dutt’s real name was Balraj Dutt. His first film role was in director Ramesh Saigal’s film, Railway Platform (1955).

The film was highly successful and made Dutt a bonafide movie star.\n\nDuring the filming of Mother India, Dutt saved Nargis from a fire on the sets of the film and got burn injuries. Nargis helped him recover. The two later got married.\n\nSunil Dutt not only showcased his acting prowess but also ventured into the realm of production and direction. With a total of six films under his directorial belt, he made his directorial debut with the black and white film “Yaadein” (1964). Notably, this film earned a prestigious spot in the Guinness Book of World Records as Sunil Dutt stood as the sole actor in the entire production.\n\nSunil Dutt played a pivotal role in shaping the career of his son, Sanjay Dutt, in the film industry. In a significant milestone, he directed and launched Sanjay’s career with the film Rocky in 1981.\n\nHe established the Nargis Dutt Memorial Cancer Foundation in memory of his wife Nargis Dutt, who passed away due to complications from pancreatic cancer in 1981.\n\nDutt shared the screen with his son Sanjay for the final time in Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.\n\nIn addition to his illustrious career in the film industry, Sunil Dutt made a significant foray into politics by joining the Indian National Congress."
