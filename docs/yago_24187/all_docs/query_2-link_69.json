        "text": "According to Ahmed, Dutt was a man who lived by his mother’s wise words all through his life. “Leave your past behind. If you keep wallowing in the ravages of Partition and how it affected us, you will only intensify the hatred inside you. There is a new day and a new life ahead. Keep looking forward”, is what Dutt’s mother used to tell him, remembers Ahmed.\n\nSoon after, Dutt dropped his old name for what happened to work better with the trends back in the day- Balraj became Sunil Dutt. He started out as a supervisor with Mumbai’s BEST Transport division at a bus depot in Dadar and also enrolled himself in Mumbai’s Jai Hind College. Here he was spotted on stage and signed on by the ad agency DJ Keymer to present a star-oriented show on Radio Ceylon called Lipton Ke Sitare.\n\nRauf Ahmed recalls that it was while covering the Dilip Kumar starrer Shikast (1953), Dutt met director Ramesh Saigal who was instantly impressed by his voice and bearing and offered him a role in his next film. Dutt wanted to play the lead role and was ready to audition and Saigal screen-tested him in Dilip Kumar’s clothes, which happened to be at hand.\n\nAhmed remembers Dutt narrating the whole incident,“The jacket sleeve reached only his wrist and the trousers were ankle length. He felt so awkward in them that he never thought Saigal would call him back, but he did.”\n\nThere was no looking back after his first film Railway Platform (1955), but Dutt shot to stardom only with Mother India (1957) playing the on-screen son to his future wife, Nargis. A series of successful films like Sadhana (1958), Gumraah (1963), Sujatha (1959) and Yeh Raaste Hai Pyaar Ke (1963) made Dutt a sought-after star. His last performance was in Rajkumar Hirani’s Munnabhai MBBS (2003).\n\nWe all know the filmy story of Dutt jumping into a fire on the sets of Mother India to save Nargis Dutt. They fell in love as she nursed him back to health. Ahmed recalls their bond to be one of deep understanding and love. But few know that Dutt was the softer voice of the two."
