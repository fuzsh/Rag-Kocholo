        "text": "By: easterneye.biz Staff\n\nTWENTY FACTS ABOUT THE BOLLYWOOD LEGEND’S GREAT CAREER, TO MARK HIS DEATH ANNIVERSARY\n\nby ASJAD NAZIR\n\nTHIS week marks the death anniversary of legendary Bollywood star Sunil Dutt, who passed away on May 25, 2005, aged 75.\n\nApart from being one of the greatest Hindi film stars of all time, he was also a producer, director and in later life, a respected politician. The father of popular actor Sanjay Dutt and husband of Hindi cinema icon Nargis inspiringly rose from humble beginnings to movie superstardom and left a permanent mark in the Indian cinematic landscape.\n\nEastern Eye decided to mark his death anniversary by presenting 20 interesting facts about multi-talented star Sunil Dutt and his impressive body of film work.\n\nSunil Dutt started off as a host on Radio Ceylon and would cover major Bollywood premieres for his show Lux Ke Sitaray. While covering Dilip Kumar’s film Shikast in 1953, the handsome young presenter with perfect diction was spotted by writer-director Ramesh Saigal and made his acting debut two years later in his film Railway Platform (1955).\n\nThe actor was born Balraj Dutt, but Ramesh Saigal changed his name to Sunil Dutt for his debut, so audiences didn’t confuse him with successful Bollywood star Balraj Sahni.\n\nThe original choice to play the rebellious son in Oscar-nominated Bollywood film Mother India (1957) was Hollywood star Sabu Dastagir, but he couldn’t get a work visa and unknown actor Sunil Dutt was cast.\n\nBlockbuster hit Mother India not only turned Dutt into star, but it also enabled the newcomer to meet Bollywood superstar Nargis. He saved her life during a deadly fire on set, they fell in love and married a year later.\n\nYears later Dutt’s daughter Namrata Dutt would coincidentally marry his Mother India co-star Rajendra Kumar’s actor son Kumar Gaurav.\n\nSuccessful Dutt starrer Sadhna (1958) was the last film Bollywood’s greatest filmmaker Yash Chopra worked on as an assistant and made his directorial debut a year later. Chopra would later cast Dutt in Waqt, which became the biggest blockbuster of 1965 and also popularised the multi-starrer.\n\nThe actor’s acclaimed drama Sujata (1959) was an official selection at the Cannes Film festival, but it missed out on the top prize.\n\nThe actor’s often underrated film Ek Phool Char Kante (1960) was inspired by 18th century English theatre play A Bold Stroke for a Wife, which was first performed in 1718. The film would later be remade in 2000 as Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge, with Salman Khan and Karisma Kapoor in the lead roles.\n\nHe won a Filmfare Best Actor award twice for his role in Bollywood classics Mujhe Jeene Do (1963) and Khandan (1965), respectively.\n\nThe actor made his directorial debut with Yaadein (1964), which was the first ever film with only one protagonist. He also played the lead role in the award-winning film, which was way ahead of its time.\n\nHis films Amrapali (1966) and Reshma Aur Shera (1971) were India’s official entries into the Oscars in the best foreign language film category, but neither of the films were nominated.\n\nHis laugh-riot Padosan (1968), which is regarded as one of the greatest comedies in Bollywood history, was a remake of Bengali language film Pasher Bari (1952), which itself was based on a short story.\n\nLegendary actor Vinod Khanna got his first acting break after he was spotted by Sunil Dutt and cast in Man Ka Meet (1968).
