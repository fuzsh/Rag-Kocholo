        "text": "Set against the backdrop of Rajasthan, Reshma (Waheeda Rehman) and Shera (Sunil Dutt) love each other, bang in the midst of a violent feud between their clans. When their families find out about their relationship, Chotu (Amitabh Bachchan), Shera's mute sharpshooting brother carries out his father Sagat Singh (Jayant)'s orders to kill Reshma's father (K. N. Singh) and her recently married brother Gopal (Ranjeet).\n\nUnable to bear the grief of Gopal's widowed bride (Raakhee), Shera kills his own father believing he actually pulled the trigger. After this tragedy, Reshma and Shera's family's feud will end in more tragedy as misunderstandings lead to more bloodshed between the clans.\n\nShera swears to kill Chotu and protect Reshma's family. Shera searches for Chotu, who hides in Reshma's house and seeks protection from her. The movie's climax is when Shera awaits outside Reshma's house to kill Chotu. At the moment, Chotu and Reshma emerge from the house as a married couple. Shera notices sindoor on Reshma's forehead and realizes that he cannot kill her husband, who is now Chotu, thus ending the bloodshed."
