        "text": "Shipping\n\nWe carefully pack the items with stiffeners and bubble wrap them for additional protection.\n\nWe ship by Shree Maruti Courier. In case your area is unserviceable by them, we will ship by India Post.\n\nWe normally ship within 2 to 3 days of receiving the order. Sometimes, there could be delays so please be patient.\n\nForeign Customers please note the following:\n\nPlease email us with your order list (with SKU details) and we will get back to you with shipping quotes. We ship via Registered Air Mail through India Post with Tracking No. but India Post gives tracking info only up to Indian shores. Once a package leaves India, we have no control over it and if the package gets lost or is held up in customs it is not our responsibility. But not to worry as in our vast experience, we have not had any problems with India Post. Please buy only if you are agreeable to this condition. Shipment time up to three weeks.\n\nWe do not ship to some countries...please inquire before ordering.\n\nReturns:\n\nNo returns in respect of brand new, sealed items please.\n\nWe are particular about our gradings and most of the time, the question of returns will not arise. However, in rare cases if we have made human error, we will entertain return requests.\n\nReturns should be prompt and the item should be in the same condition as was shipped by us. Please use the same packaging material which was sent to you.\n\nWe have a brick and mortar store and sell on other platforms too so sometimes the ordered item may not be available.\n\nMint (M)\n\nVinyl\n\nAbsolutely perfect in every way. Certainly never been played, possibly even still sealed.\n\nCD\n\nPerfect. No scuffs/scratches, unplayed – possibly still sealed. Insert/Inlay/Booklet/Sleeve/Digipak: Perfect. No wear, marks, or any other imperfections – possibly still sealed.\n\nNear Mint (NM or M-)\n\nVinyl\n\nA nearly perfect record. A NM or M- record has more than likely never been played, and the vinyl will play perfectly, with no imperfections during playback. Many dealers won’t give a grade higher than this implying (perhaps correctly) that no record is ever truly perfect. The record should show no obvious signs of wear. A 45 RPM or EP sleeve should have no more than the most minor defects, such as any sign of slight handling. An LP cover should have no creases, folds, seam splits, cut-out holes, or other noticeable similar defects. The same should be true of any other inserts, such as posters, lyric sleeves, etc.\n\nCD\n\nNear perfect. No obvious signs of use, it may have been played – but it has been handled very carefully. Insert/Inlay/Booklet/Sleeve/Digipak: Near Perfect. No obvious wear, it may have only the slightest of marks from handling.\n\nVery Good Plus (VG+)\n\nVinyl\n\nGenerally worth 50% of the Near Mint value. A Very Good Plus record will show some signs that it was played and otherwise handled by a previous owner who took good care of it. Defects should be more of a cosmetic nature, not affecting the actual playback as a whole. Record surfaces may show some signs of wear and may have slight scuffs or very light scratches that don’t affect one’s listening experiences. Some background crackle esp in silent pasages is acceptable. Slight warps that do not affect the sound are “OK”. The label may have some ring wear or discoloration, but it should be barely noticeable. Spindle marks may be present. Picture sleeves and inner sleeves will have some slight wear, slightly turned-up corners, or a slight seam split. An LP cover may have slight signs of wear, and may be marred by a cut-out hole, indentation, or cut corner. In general, if not for a couple of minor things wrong with it, this would be Near Mint.\n\nCD\n\nA few minor scuffs/scratches. This has been played, but handled with good care – and certainly not abused. Insert/Inlay/Booklet/Sleeve/Digipak: Slight wear, marks, indentations, it may possibly have a cut-out hole (or similar).\n\nVery Good (VG)\n\nVinyl\n\nGenerally worth 25% of Near Mint value. Many of the defects found in a VG+ record will be more pronounced in a VG disc. Surface noise will be evident upon playing, especially in soft passages and during a song’s intro and fade, but will not overpower the music otherwise. Groove wear will start to be noticeable, as with light scratches (deep enough to feel with a fingernail) that will affect the sound. Labels may be marred by writing, or have tape or stickers (or their residue) attached. The same will be true of picture sleeves or LP covers. However, it will not have all of these problems at the same time. Goldmine price guides with more than one price will list Very Good as the lowest price.\n\nCD\n\nQuite a few light scuffs/scratches, or several more-pronounced scratches. This has obviously been played, but not handled as carefully as a VG+. Insert/Inlay/Booklet/Sleeve/Digipak: More wear, marks, indentations than a VG+. May have slight fading, a small tear/rip, or some writing.\n\nGood (G), Good Plus (G+)\n\nVinyl\n\nGenerally worth 10-15% of the Near Mint value. A record in Good or Good Plus condition can be played through without skipping. But it will have significant surface noise, scratches, and visible groove wear. A cover or sleeve will have seam splits, especially at the bottom or on the spine. Tape, writing, ring wear, or other defects will be present. While the record will be playable without skipping, noticeable surface noise and “ticks” will almost certainly accompany the playback.\n\nCD\n\nThere are a lot of scuffs/scratches. However it will still play through without problems. This has not been handled with much care at all. Insert/Inlay/Booklet/Sleeve/Digipak: Well worn, marked, more obvious indentations, fading, writing, than a VG – possibly a more significant tear/rip.\n\nIf there are any discrepancies in addition to above, we mention it in Remarks columns of our listings. Humble request…please do not be very strict as these are guidelines and to remember we are here to enjoy the music and not nitpick. Thank you!"
