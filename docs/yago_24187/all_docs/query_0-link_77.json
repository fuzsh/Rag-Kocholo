        "text": "It is very rare for guys to shed tears after watching a movie, this movie does make you shed tears for Anand, the main protagonist played by the superstar of the 70's Rajesh Khanna. The movie has everything going for it. Acting, direction, story, music, dialogues etc... everything is fabulous. It has drama, humor, emotions in dollops. It is a story a dying man who looks at life with a positive attitude and enjoys his time knowing fully well his disease is incurable and that he is going to die soon. Rajesh Khanna as Anand is absolutely brilliant, this is his career-best performance , notwithstanding movies like Kati Patang, Roti, Aradhana, Amar Prem etc. You cannot think of any other actor in this role and to think Rajesh Khanna was not the original choice(Shashi Kapoor was). He makes you laugh and cry. He causes anxiety and goose bumps. Simply superb. Amitabh Bachchan is fantastic as babumoshai( a name with which Raj Kapoor used to address the film's director Hrishikesh Mukherjee). Music is the hallmark of all great hindi movies and this one has music ranking right up there, on the top. Be it \"Kahin door jab din dhal jaye\" or \" Maine tere liye hi saath rang\" or \"Zindagi kaisi hai paheli\". Maverick composer Salil Chowdury comes up with an absolutely fantastic score and singers Mukhesh and Manna Dey do complete justice to his tunes. About the director Hrishikesh Mukherjee, what can one say, he is one of the best directors ever in the Indian film history. A guy with a complete repertoire,a complete entertainer. Anand is without doubt the best (and most popular) of Mukherjee's works. i never saw Anand on big screen, i.e. a theater, didn't get a chance to, which is a big loss for a film Buff like me but seen it countless number of times, each leaving me haunted by that epic last scene, and each letting me discover another gleam in its brilliance.\n\nDecades before David Dhawan and Priyadarshan rediscovered comedy in Indian Cinema and began their barrage of outings, the undisputed emperors in this genre were Hrishikesh Mukhejee and Basu Chatterjee. A prolonged play of secret humor--the broad connotative meaning of the title-- does not lose its relish due to the compact screenplay, the excellent performances of the casts, proper editing, wonderful music by Sachin Deb Barman and a few other supportive constituents of the film. Though the social composition of the characters, the social nature of turns and twists of the sequences focus on the educated urban Indian middle class, the lucid narrative seems to communicate a stable flow of comedian pleasure to all viewers. The final revelation of the true identities among the characters is accelerated because of the maturity of a new love relation. The narrative seems to challenge softly some insensible social norms. It also expresses its deep conviction about love and honesty of individuals and obviously its trust on the creative capacity of intelligent and humorous individual. Any regular Indian film lover would enjoy the nice acting of at least four film stars--Dharmendra, Sharmila Tagore, Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bhaduri-- in simple social images and appreciate director Hrishikesh Mukherjee for another successful experiment. The film makes the spectator reminiscent of the genre, which rarely used the very close and the very long shots and rapid cuts. In spite of a theatrical design of the screenplay it could provide the actors and the actresses with the greater scope of establishing their performing talents. The use of bright light and sustained delight of the romantic characters in the family drama--initiated by an unconventionally sensitive, urban, academic personality--makes the film a bright entertainment. Both relied heavily on creating a natural humour as opposed to what we witness today ie. mindless comedy/ situational comedy/ tongue-in-cheek comedy. And this very natural humour gives USP for \"Chupke Chupke\" repeat viewings. \"Chupke Chupke\" rests heavily on the performance from two actors namely Dharmendra and Om Prakash. If there was any short-coming from either, the entire proceedings would have fallen like a pack of cards. It goes without saying that it was fantastic performance from Mr. Om Prakash. The rest of the star-cast namely Sharmila Tagore, Jaya Bhaduri, Asrani, David and Keshto lend adequate support. S D Burman's composition to Anand Bakshi's lyrics are a music for ears. As with most successful outings of Hrishda, Gulzar's gets involved to contribute his two-cents in the department of screenplay and dialogues and needless to say makes the movie flow seamlessly.\n\nHrishikesh Mukherjee could never disappoint. Nor could Gulzar. Here Mukherjee directs a film scripted by Gulzar and the result is an excellent film in all respects - real, intelligent, moving. The movie starts well and keeps growing on you as it proceeds. This is a story of two brother-like friends, Somu (Khanna) and Vicky (Bachchan). This social drama is brilliantly written - an interesting story, a tight conflicted script, awesome dialogues. Mukherjee's direction is excellent as always, and the film is brilliantly executed. The depiction of poverty and hardship among people from the lower middle class is spot on and at points really manages to tug at your heartstrings. That makes it easier to understand Somu's involvement with the world of simple villagers, a world he actually belongs to but an involvement which could smash his friendship with Vicky. This conflict of interests is well brought out by Mukherjee. The film of course presents a clash of opposing economic worlds, but it works essentially because of the human relationship between the two friends, which is extremely well done. Somu and Vicky are very different, the former being soft-spoken, simple and generous, and the latter being hot-tempered, proud and a bit aggressive. Yet their friendship is convincing and it's clear that each one of them would do anything for the other. Rajesh Khanna plays Somu exceedingly well, and his character is very easy to relate to. But it is clearly Amitabh Bachchan's film. As Vicky, he delivers an impressive performance by creating a tough, dignified and stylish persona. His decisiveness, inner conflict, anger and care for a friend are excellently displayed, and everything--from his facial expressions to his line delivery to his body language--is incredibly forceful. Apart from Bachchan and Khanna, the cast includes many good actors, all of whom perform well. A very young Rekha appears in a tiny role as the sassy Shyama and she is very charming. Simi Garewal plays the intelligent and educated Manisha with grace. A.K. Hangal is outstanding and likable as Bipinlal. Om Shivpuri does a good job as Vicky's dad and he gets some of the better dialogues in this film. Raza Murad is wonderful as Alam, an alcoholic poet who befriends Somu. So are Durga Khote and actress Manisha who play Somu's mother and sister. Namak Haram is one of many great films made by Hrishikesh Mukherjee and written by Gulzar, with a beautiful soundtrack composed by master RD Burman and some memorable performances. I recommend you to watch Namak Haram - it is entertaining, it is moving, it is heartbreaking, it is a classic.\n\nBaawarchi is a showcase for the immense talent of it's director Hrishikesh Mukherjee and his ability to take a simple plot and make a thoroughly enjoyable film. One that you can see again and again and again and never seem to tire of it. It is a clean family film, like all other Hrishikesh Mukherjee films, which will make the entire family, the young and the old, and the very young and the very old, all alike, laugh and cry. Bawarchi can inspire a mixture of emotions: from sadness to joy. Shot almost exclusively inside the Sharma household, this film explores the tensions and rivalries within the Sharma family, and how their domestic problems quite literally bring them to their knees. Into this house of discontent steps a man with answers to their problems and a lot more. How can a cook be so smart? What is his agenda? Who is this man? The acting in a very strong cast is first class, and without weakness. Rajesh Khanna steals the show though with a brilliant, amusing lead role as the loquacious Bawarchi. At that time (1972) he was the darling of the Indian cinema and women wrote letters in their own blood to him, such was his appeal, and this film showcases his immense talent. Rajesh Khanna's performance is one of great depth: his facial expressions, delivery and mannerisms are skilfully never overplayed, none more so than when he utters in English \"It is simple to be happy, but it is difficult to be simple\". This is a truly classic Indian film, and a fitting showcase to the substantial talents of it director, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, who shows how a masterpiece can be produced on a small budget. The film also has some moist-eyed scenes a must in those days, the comed is subtle mostly and more focus on characters, dialogues and all within the plot something missing nowdays. Songs are aptly placed and picturised very simplistically yet superb The story moves well and the film keeps you entertained throughout. The pre-climax does jolt you but the mystery is solved quickly leaving some answers unanswered but it's forgiven and all ends well Direction By HM is awesome, He took a big risk by portraying RK unlike his films those days, He doesn't even have a heroine or does he have his usual Kishore songs. Music is superb, The best song is Tum Bin Jeevan sung superbly by Manna Dey.\n\nWatching 'Waqy' was like making a pleasant visit to yesteryear's cinema. One wonders how Yash Chopra put it all together as it includes a stellar cast, wonderful music and engaging plot. Not only did he direct, he was responsible for other crew-work like choreography. even though the screenplay isn't original today, it was path-breaking at its time and it finely balances, comedy, drama, romance, hardship, music and suspense through coincidences. It is 'Waqt' that becomes a reference source for all of Chopra's future films. Chopra does lightly tackle some issues such as coincidences, living in the present etc but 'Waqt' is an entertaining film, not one that will make you pick your brain. Though it is predictable, it remains enjoyable. Chopra had the three Kapoors (Raj, Shammi and Shashi) in mind to play the 3 brothers but he opted for Raaj Kumar and Sunil Dutt to play the elder brothers. The screenplay credited to BR Films story department marvelously integrates strands of the individual stories of three brothers into a cohesive unit. Sadhana, dressed in gorgeous chiffon and embroidered churidar kurtas, justifies her fashion icon reputation and embellishes the film's lush look especially in her swimsuit change scene. A young Sharmila draws notice in her confrontation scene with Sunil Dutt. Sunil Dutt gives a relaxed performance while Shashi Kapoor is earnest. In this battle of acting honors, the choice narrows down to Balraj Sahni and Raaj Kumar. But aided by some clap-evoking lines, the theatrical Raaj steals the show. 'O Meri Zohra Jabeen' might be the most memorable track but the other songs are just as beautiful thanks to the magical voices of Asha Bhosle and Mahinder Kapoor. All have been wonderfully shot. I particularly liked the way Asha Bhosle's cabaret number 'Aage Bhi Jaane' was shot. This is one evergreen classic that I've already watched numerous times. And, I haven't tired myself of it.\n\n'Bandit Queen' was one of Shekhar Kapur's final films before he ventured into Hollywood. Due to its subject matter and very graphic portrayal of rape and humiliation it was considered to be one of the most controversial Indian films and was even banned in the country. The film tells the story of Phoolan Devi in her earlier years (before she became a politician). Even though the film is said to be based on accounts written by Devi, the Bandit Queen herself was disappointed by the film and stated that it was riddled with inaccuracies. Like most of Kapur's movies, the execution is first rate. The raw dry landscape is captured stunningly. It looks beautiful but at the same time very real. The art direction also brings out an authentic earthy quality of the village and its dwellers. The narrative structure and cinematography are solid and the pace is well. The rape scenes are disturbing, especially the gang-rape and the scene that follows where humiliated Phoolan Devi is stripped off her clothing and exploited in the village by her assailants. The sequence provides shock value but not in a gratuitous way. 'Bandit Queen' has some remarkable performances. Nirmal Pandey, Saurabh Shukla and Manoj Bajpai are excellent. Govind Namdeo is chilling and hateful in one of his sleaziest roles to date. However, this is Seema Biswas's film. The actress performs all guns blazing in this career defining role. She wonderfully moulds feistiness, vulnerability, anguish, despair and strength in her character. It has me wondering why she hasn't received more of such meaty roles.\n\nMother India sits right at the top and shares the seat with just a handful of other movies as one of the best films ever made in Indian Film History. Deservedly, it also garnered an Oscar Nomination for Best Foreign Film - a first for Bollywood. Need I say more? Let me try... Five years after her wedding, Radha, a regular village girl finds she has been abandoned by her husband (who leaves her in despair) and left to cope with his never-ending debt to Shuki Lal, the village \"Munshi\". To feed her children, Radha toils like a farm-animal and is able to save just enough food to eventually bring up her children. The injustice to and torture of their mother is interpreted in opposite ways by her children: while the elder Ramu is humble and just, the younger Birju who seethes with hatred for Sukhi Lal turns outlaw. While Radha tries to bring back Birju with love, Birju plans to finish Sukhi Lal's debt once and for all. Mehboob Khan had made some good movies in his career, including a milestone first all-colour (technicolor) Bollywood feature. But nothing could have hinted at the brilliance to come in his waning years. Defying a very many stereotypes, his was the first major Hindi film with a female protagonist and a cowardly abandoning husband. He tells the 172-minute story in flash-back as a memory of an old Radha inaugurating irrigation canals in her village. Taking his titular heroine through happiness, desolation, compulsion and resignation, he transformed box-office darling Nargis into an actress nothing short of a legend. We see her go from an innocent bride to an anguished mother to a revered \"Mother\" of the village.Sunil Dutt was a very under-rated actor, for the simple reason that all his great performances were never title characters, and were over-shadowed by more famous co-actors. His Birju is played with such realism and conviction that even today many comedians mimicking Sunil Dutt are actually mimicking Birju. Rajendra Kumar had the guts to accept the role says all him. Naushad's music is another highlight of the film with some great songs like \"Duniya Mein Hum Aaye Hain\", \"Nagri-Nagri Dware-Dware\", \"Holi Aayi Re Kanhai\", \"Tan Rang Lo Ji\" etc. The Last but not the least, RAAJ KUMAR was amazing in this film and perfectly suits the role.\n\nNaya Daur is a originally a black and white movie whose coloured version was released a few years back. It deals with the issue of unemployment because of mechanization in the Indian villages which was very much relevant and burning in that time. Tonga (horse-carriage) driver Shankar opposes the introduction of bus in the village because of the prospective unemployment of the tonga-drivers. The owner of the bus - Kundan who is a wealthy businessman of the village enters into a bet with him that if he is able to defeat the bus by his tonga in a race, the bus will be withdrawn. How Shankar prepares for the race and finally defeats the bus by driving his tonga, forms the rest of the story which involves the factor of rivalry in getting the love of Rajni (Vyjayanthimala) leading to betrayal of Shankar's friend, Krishna (Ajit) also. Naya Daur is thoroughly engrossing and very impressive. Legendary director B.R. Chopra has directed the story of Akhtar Mirza quite nicely and maintained the momentum of the narrative through the duration of the movie which is a little less than three hours. The sets, costume designing, editing etc. are all praiseworthy. Production value is high matching the great B.R. Films tradition. The timeless music of Naya Daur composed by O.P. Nayyar (lyrics by Saahir Ludhiyanvi), boasting of immortal songs like Ude Jab Jab Zulfen Teri, Ye Desh Hai Veer Jawanon Ka, Reshmi Salwar Kurta Jaali Ka, Saathi Haath Badhaana, Maang Ke Saath Tumhaara Maine Maang Liya Sansar and Main Bambai Ka Babu Naam Mera Anjaana cannot be compared to the music of any other movie. leave aside Lagaan. Even today listening to the songs in the enchanting voices of Asha and Rafi is a great experience. Naya Daur is a complete movie with all elements of human sentiments and emotions. It has a great message imbibed in it. The message of humanity. The movie is a competition between man vs machine. The idea is itself a jaw dropping one and that too in 1950s. And that very idea of greatness was beautifully and masterfully crafted by BR Chopra.\n\nThis 1980 star-studded box office disaster is a real old favorite of mine. A very slick, very action-oriented movie with a non-standard theme that promised to change Bollywood movie-making standards of the early 80s. The movie is about the launch of a new super fast express train that runs between Delhi and Bombay in a record time of 14 hours. The movie starts in Varanasi rail factory (Diesel Locomotive Works), where a group of capable engineers toil away to design the new engine. After years of effort, their efforts finally pay off and the new express is launched. However, engineers are humans too. During all this, the lead characters go through heartbreaks, family crisis and professional showdowns. Just when workers are rejoicing over the success of the project, things go wrong. As I mentioned, it was one of the slickest action movies of its time – use of miniatures, complex action sequences, chase scenes, explosions, aerial shots – it has a bit of everything. Excellent cinematography and a plausible screenplay add to the effect. The all-star cast is excellent, especially Khanna who delivers a powerful performance as the engineer trying to set things right. The movie has all kinds of regular Bollywood formulae, entertaining the typical Indian movie buffs but its essence is the climax which justifies its title. The climax is pretty long and sensational. The movie has all kinds of regular Bollywood formulae, entertaining the typical Indian movie buffs but its essence is the climax which justifies its title. The climax is pretty long and sensational. The music of the film was mind blowing and all credit to the legendry Late R. D. Burman for such a marvelous music."
