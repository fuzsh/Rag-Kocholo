        "text": "Conflict took place in every year of the 20th Century; the world was free from the violence caused by war for only very short periods of time. It has been estimated that 187 million people died as a result of war from 1900 to the present. The actual number is likely far higher.\n\nThe following list highlights just some of the conflicts that have impacted the lives of people from the United Kingdom, the British Empire and the Commonwealth since 1900. The museum records and preserves stories from many of these conflicts amongst its collections.\n\nDiscover more about each conflict by searching IWM's extensive collections.\n\nYou will find that each conflict is described with a set of dates, which implies a defined ‘beginning and end’. While this is useful to help with classification, it is important to note that the causes and consequences of individual wars or conflicts extend far beyond these narrow ranges. Frequently, there are wider issues which connect many of them together; exploring and documenting these links through our collections is an ongoing process.\n\nBoer War, 1899–1902\n\nFirst World War, 1914–1918\n\nRussian Civil War, 1917–1922\n\nThird Afghan War, 1919\n\nIrish War of Independence, 1919–1921\n\nIrish Civil War, 1922–1923\n\nSpanish Civil War, 1936–1939\n\nArab Revolt in Palestine, 1936-1939\n\nSecond World War, 1939–1945\n\nJewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine, 1944-1948\n\nPartition of India, 1947\n\nIsraeli-Palestinian Conflict, 1948 onwards\n\nMalayan Emergency, 1948–1960\n\nYangtze Incident, 1949\n\nKorean War, 1950–1953\n\nKenya Emergency, 1952–1960\n\nCyprus Emergency, 1955–1959\n\nVietnam War, 1955–1975\n\nSuez Crisis, 1956\n\nBrunei Revolt, 1962–1963\n\nIndonesian Confrontation, 1963–1966\n\nAden Emergency, 1963–1967\n\n'The Troubles', 1969–1998\n\nFalklands Conflict, 1982\n\nGulf War, 1990–1991\n\nSierra Leone Civil War, 1991–2002\n\nBosnian War, 1992–1995\n\nKosovo War, 1998–1999\n\nWar in Afghanistan, 2001–2014\n\nIraq War, 2003–2011\n\nLibya Conflict, 2011–present\n\nSyria Conflict, 2011–present\n\nYemen Conflict, 2014–present"
