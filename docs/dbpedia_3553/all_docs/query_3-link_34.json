        "text": "An unbearable human toll\n\nIn urban centres, civilians and military objectives are often found in the same areas. Heavy explosive weapons, such as large bombs, missiles, rockets, mortars and artillery shells, are more likely to hit the military target, but their wide, inaccurate and all too often indiscriminate blast areas take down everything around them too. They significantly affect civilians, causing deaths, injuries and trauma.\n\nCeaseless worry about loved ones' safety and unremitting anxiety about food and other necessities exacerbate all the personal difficulties associated with the traumatizing situation. Intense grief is common, as is fear. While most people will be able to continue to function and cope with the distress they have endured, others will suffer incapacitating psychological trauma.\n\nRun for your life\n\nAs neighbourhoods become front lines, the basics of life – water, food, health care, jobs, education and decent accommodation – suddenly become hard to find. People are often forced to flee their homes, overturning their lives and exposing themselves to greater risks, such as sexual and gender-based violence, as they lose their livelihoods and support networks. It then usually falls to local communities – which may also be suffering from the effects of conflict – to help those who have been displaced.\n\nEven after the guns have fallen silent, displacement can continue for years, as homes and infrastructure have been destroyed and unexploded and abandoned explosive devices litter residential areas. They may take years, decades even, to be cleared, preventing residents from returning safely.\n\nThe ICRC and the entire International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement continue to bolster their capacity to prevent and respond to the humanitarian consequences of urban warfare. We favour an integrated, multidisciplinary approach to helping civilians, combining prevention, protection and assistance specifically adapted to the urban context. We engage with belligerents at every level, driven by the needs of the people who are most affected.\n\nWe work to prevent critical infrastructure from collapsing and forcing millions into crisis. This involves repairing and rehabilitating infrastructure, supplying spare parts, providing training and capacity-building for local service providers and developing emergency preparedness plans.\n\nHowever, there are limits to what the collective humanitarian response can achieve in the face of extensive damage and destruction to critical infrastructure and its misuse by parties to a conflict. When systems fail, the scale of the consequences far exceeds what can be addressed by humanitarian action alone.\n\nGiven the scope and complexity of urban warfare's humanitarian consequences, partnerships must be developed, especially with local authorities and essential service providers, but also with communities, local organizations and businesses, to ensure responses are grounded in local realities and attract widespread support. Such partnerships can help safeguard public health, reduce displacement and enable a more rapid response to acute emergencies. These partnerships can be supported by the combined efforts of humanitarian and development organizations to capitalize on their respective security, political and technical expertise."
