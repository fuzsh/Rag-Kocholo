        "text": "” We are changing the world with technolgy”, Bill Gates. As every second passes, new kind of innovation begins. The world keeps on upgrading, keeps on getting better. Technology is a major cause why our world is continuing to progress. Media levels up because of technology.\n\nOne of the example of media innovation is Olo 3D Printer. The first digital fabrication tool you can throw in a bag and carry everywhere (it’s way smaller than the already compact M3D Micro). To use, you simply launch the app on your phone, choose the model you’re fabricating, and lay your phone down on a flat surface. There are no details on how long printing takes, but we’re assuming it’s going to be time-consuming similar to traditional 3D printers.\n\nIt is amazing to see a phone and printer in one. In this generation, there are so many possibilities. Media offers us anything. Media makes our life more convenient, easier and more comfortable.\n\nPlaridel is one of the beautiful town in Bulacan. But there’s have issue that will make the plaridel down. Drugs is the primary enemy of our country. Not only in our country but also in town of plaridel. Thats why some of teens now are pregnant in town of plaridel because of drugs.\n\nDrugs are the one who destroying the future of youth. They do not know if they are taking drugs they’re body will be destroyed and there lives also. The mayor of bulacan named Mayor Jocell Vistan plan a event about drugs. The participant of this event are the schools within plaridel. The event called “Youth Night” its called youth night because the primary involved in drugs are the youth. Every school, private and public prepared a performance in dramatical way to let people know what drugs can do with the behavior of a user.\n\nAs the time pass by we cant say now plaridel did’nt have an behavioral issue. We cant say that the plaridel are in good condition ’till now. Because the truth, the town of plaridel is being destroyed now of drugs.\n\nLife become more easier because of the Media and Technology. With use of this, it can make things more faster than before. It makes us more productive, skillful, and creative in discovering new things in our world.\n\nMedia and Technology has huge influence in our daily lives. We can’t denied that this kind of modernization in our generation has a lot of positive effects. In communication, we can communicate our love ones even though they are far from us. In education, it can helps us make our school works more knowledgeable. Especially in teens, it can help us to be aware on what are the happenings in our society. Aside from this positive effects, they are always a negative effects. Using too much of this can cause of low grades, addiction, distorted body image and etc.\n\nMedia is useful but it should use in proper ways. Don’t use it for bad things. Because it was made for use to help, not to harm. Helpful but you should careful.\n\nMedia is continuously evolving and Upgrading and no one can stop it . Media have been created changes constantly which forms an affection within the people in this World. Because Media is a host of every changing , every developing interfaces , impacting the world around us . Media is use to be a credible source of information . We are all aware that Media and Information is really has the power to affect and change once life.\n\nMedia influence is the actual force exerted by a media message, resulting in either a change or reinforcement in audience or individual beliefs. Media effects are measurable effects that result from media influence, or a media message. Whether that media message has an effect on any of its audience members is contingent on many factors, including audience demographics and psychological characteristics. These effects can be positive or negative, abrupt or gradual, short-term or long-lasting. Not all effects result in change: some media messages reinforce an existing belief. Researchers examine an audience after media exposure for changes in cognition, belief systems, and attitudes, as well as emotional, physiological and behavioral effects.\n\nMedia and information has the power to brought changes for the audience but the effect of it will depend on the actions that the audience will do. We must consume and utilize information properly . Students like me should learn how to use information correctly , to avoid misuse of it. Therefore it is very important for us to be a Media and a Information Literate one to be able to survive with the current changes that media and information brought.\n\nMunisipality of Plaridel is a simple place. It doesn’t have any luxurious hotel or restaurant. All it have re different fast food chains that will satisfy your hunger. But most of the people didn’t know that a there is a great story that lies behind this town. A story about courage, bravery and nationalism. A great story to know and to tell, the story of The Battle of Quingua.\n\nPlaridel has a total population of 107,805 based on the 2015 census. I wonder how many percent in this popplation knew this story? The battle of Quingua happened on April 23, 1899 during the Philippine-American War. When the American Army went here in Plaridel for the Northern Campaign. Colonel. Pablo Ocampo Tecson from San Miguel, Bulacan under Gregorio Del Pilar is the one who was assigned to fight against the American. Using his great skills in fighting, he manned his men to fight for our beloved land. In the end, Col. Pablo Tecson and his men won the fight after they killed Col. John Stotsenberg, the leader of the American army. In honor for their courageous deeds, a marker has been build especially for them. The marker is standing in Brgy. Agnaya together with the tomb of Col. Stotsenberg because they didn’t gave his corps back to America after they killed him as a sign of revenge for trying to invade their land.\n\nQuingua is the old name of Plaridel but it changed later on to Plaridel in honor to Marcelo H. Del Pilar for using “Plaridel” as his penname on La Solidaridad. This battle just prove how brave our fellow countrymen is. That they risk their lives to fight for our land. I hope we will always remember this story and just dont forget easily.\n\nIf you are finding a school that will surely teach yo everything that you are willing to know. Then, Jose J.

Information Is called literacy because of “skill” . To be an Information Literate lead us to defines information needed , recognizes information , locates , assesses communication information . There’s a lot of sources of information , firstly is the Media . And Media includes Website and Blogsite.\n\nBlogsite and Website is a source of information , Blogger writes his/her opinion about a certain topic or issue sometimes the information present there is real but it can also be a lie. So everyone Should be an Information Literate . Don’t just copy right whatever you read in a blogsite or website , learn to avoid plagiarism instead of it use a citation. Every time we use Media we have to be Responsible in our Actions , use the information ethically. Information Literacy leads students in developing effective research skills and teach them to think critically especially when they got an information in the Blogsite and Website. And will all start in our Mind set and Self discipline.\n\nOur Habit become our actions , Our actions become our character , and our character become our Destiny . Think Critically and wisely before accepting any information coming from the Media , Blogsite and Website . Seek to be an information literate one have a filtering system accept the good one and throw all the negative one. Demonstrate ethical use of information avoid plagiarism and try to use citation . We students must be aware about all of this.\n\n“Big things is once a small thing.” Media and technology are very helpful in our time. Information, news, communication, etc. are the things that media and technology can give to us.\n\nMedia is started in a block of rock, that is clay tablet by sumerian. Cave painting and drawing in block of rock is the way of communication in that time. As the time pass, people got smarter and smarter. They discover many mystery in world. Many knowledge come and that is their instrument to make many useful things. News papers, and printing press come. It can give many news and information about different happening. Time pass by, until the biggest invention come. It is computer. There are many function of it. Until now we use many inventions that help us do our task easier.\n\nMedia give us a easier life. Better and more beautiful life. Continue to live better. Invention will come because the progress is running.\n\n#Activity2\n\nMedia have big effect to the way we communicate. We can communicate easier that the tradition way. Modern media is very helpful to our lives. It can help us to socialize in other people. It can also give information to us on the happenings in the world. Any information that we need, there’s a big possibility that we can see it or get in through the help of media.\n\nAs a student, media can help to my study. Through media and technology, I can do my assignments, report, project, etc. easier. Because there are many information in media or in internet I can also do self study. I can also communicate to my teacher and classmate if I’m absent to ask the activities that I missed, or to ask them if I don’t understand the lesson. It can also help me to have many friends through social media like facebook, twitter, instagram, etc. Media also give me information about anything in the world. Tlevision, radio, newspaper, etc. can open my eyes in the issues happening in my country, political, showbiz, etc.\n\nThere are many benefits that media can bring to us. But it should use with discipline. Don’t over use it, because not all information in internet is true. We need to become wise in using media. We should filter information and identify what is true and not."
