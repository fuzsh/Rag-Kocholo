        "text": "What you are describing is a political events based on ideological values and norms which you consider important. Politicans, strategists and military planners often work on timescales far in advance of the average voter or world citizen; attempting to shape the world on a micro, macro and international level. This requires frequent deviations from stated values.\n\nThe interventions you speak of are known as Realpolitik.\n\nRealpolitick\n\nRealpolitik (from German: real \"realistic\", \"practical\", or \"actual\"; and Politik \"politics\", German pronun­cia­tion: [ʁeˈaːlpoliˌtɪk]) is politics or diplomacy based primarily on considerations of given circumstances and factors, rather than explicit ideological notions or moral and ethical premises. In this respect, it shares aspects of its philosophical approach with those of realism and pragmatism. It is often simply referred to as pragmatism in politics, e.g. \"pursuing pragmatic policies\". The term Realpolitik is sometimes used pejoratively to imply politics that are perceived as coercive, amoral, or Machiavellian.\n\nThe policy of Realpolitik was formally introduced to the Richard Nixon White House by Henry Kissinger. In this context, the policy meant dealing with other powerful nations in a practical manner rather than on the basis of political doctrine or ethics.\n\nRealpolitik is distinct from ideological politics in that it is not dictated by a fixed set of rules, but instead tends to be goal-oriented, limited only by practical exigencies. Since Realpolitik is ordered toward the most practical means of securing national interests, it can often entail compromising on ideological principles. For example, during the Cold War, the United States often supported authoritarian regimes that were human rights violators, in order to theoretically secure the greater national interest of regional stability. After the end of the Cold War this practice continued and still continues to this day.\n\nContainment\n\nRealpolitik is closely linked to Containment.\n\nContainment is a geopolitical strategy to stop the expansion of an enemy. It is best known as the Cold War policy of the United States and its allies to prevent the spread of communism. A component of the Cold War, this policy was a response to a series of moves by the Soviet Union to increase communist influence in Eastern Europe, China, Korea, Africa, and Vietnam. Containment represented a middle-ground position between detente and rollback\n\nBy engaging an ideological enemy in a neutral territory, superpowers can avoid direct conflict which runs the risk of escalating into a global catastrophe.\n\nContainment can distract and weaken an opponent as they become mired in a conflict far beyond their capabilities or political will (See Russia in Afghanistan, the USA in Vietnam or Iran-Iraq).\n\nContainment has always existed in military strategy, from the tiny scale (Chess) to the regional and beyond. However it came to prominence with the Domino Effect theory. The domino theory was a theory prominent from the 1950s to the 1980s, that speculated that if one country in a region came under the influence of communism, then the surrounding countries would follow in a domino effect. The domino theory was used by successive United States administrations during the Cold War to justify the need for American intervention around the world.\n\nAre all interventions Realpolitik or Containment?\n\nIn short; no. The reasons behind intervention can vary widely and rely largely on your prism or viewpoint. The World Bank often consider the International Monetary Fund interventions in foreign economies to be harmful and aggressive despite the IMF feeling that they are imposing long-term benefits. NATO, led by the USA, intervened in Afghanistan for genuine reasons without any kind of economic gain from natural resources.\n\nHumanitarian crises can and do occur and superpowers will take action if possible. For instance, the United Kingdom has not intervened in Zimbabwe despite the crisis because the United Nations strongly condemns former colonial rulers going back into their former territories (and there is no suitable deep water port to launch an assault) so the humanitarian situation is allowed to progress as the world watches.\n\nMost importantly, humans are extremely poor at estimating third and fourth order effects. Extremely extremely poor. Who could possibly predict that the first Gulf War would lead to the destruction of the Twin Towers 10 years later? (Bin Laden took offence at the buildup of Coalition Troops in Saudi Arabia and thus AQ was born) so many interventions may be well intentioned but the variables are just too complex to predict how it will turn out.\n\nReal World Case Study\n\nThere is only one true corridor within which to attack the Russian state - via the European Plain. Attacks from the South are buffered by troops stationed across the landstrip of Georgia etc. Attacks from the East are impossible since troops would need to travel over 4000 miles just to reach the mountains before Moscow. An attack can only come through the EU/NATO nations in the European Plain. The weak spot in the Russian suit of armour is the Ukraine.\n\nRussia formerly used Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, East Germany and Poland as buffers to US expansion however the fall of the USSR, free market reforms and the EU have enabled NATO membership to expand ever closer to the Russian border leaving only Ukraine (which formerly included the Crimea) as the last nation before NATO could threaten the entirety of the Russian state.\n\nThe Russian Navy is penned in in the North via the GIUK corridor and thusly can only launch from the Black Sea.\n\nUnder containment it is now impossible for Russia to allow the Ukraine to adopt true self-determination. It is geo-politically impossible since to do so would be to effectively expose themselves to a military rout.\n\nNow knowing what you have learned about containment; it is increasingly difficult to see the Ukraine as a sovereign territory; they are simply part of a larger geopolitical game.\n\nOnce you see the world through the eyes of realpolitik it can be difficult to reconcile small interactions with the needs of the global order. For instance, Vietnam is now a modern, vibrant free-market economy but it required war to get there. South Korea also. Was the Korean War the correct price to pay for modern freedom and economic progress for millions of people in the modern era?\n\nSummary\n\nThe stated reasons for a interfering in a sovereign nation affairs can vary widely from the actual reasons which may form part of a larger strategy known only to political parties and military/intelligence services. Such unknown motivations to civilians are typically revealed by academic study many years later, sometimes decades, if at all.\n\nIn addition; domestic enemies lie in wait to pounce on political weakness even if the intervention was well intentioned.\n\nGeorge Bush intervened in Iraq - the monster! [Democrats]\n\nBarack Obama neglected to intervene in Syria - the monster! [Republicans]\n\nRussia annexed Crimea which is primarily Russian citizens - the monsters! [EU]\n\nLet's look at some recent military interventions...\n\n1990 Gulf War. The goal was global economic stabilization (oil supply), and to a degree, the prevention of even greater hostilities and more economic destabilization should Hussein have targeted Saudi Arabia. Not really a war of regime change, more regime ejection from Kuwait.\n\nSomalia. This sort of brewed up due to no native government, and attacks on relief efforts. No one was really interested, so the coalition forces walked away when they were not successful in removing the local warlords.\n\nThe former Yugoslavia. The goal appears to have been stopping genocide, the Serbs killing the native Muslim population.\n\nAfghanistan. The goal was removing a government that had aided terrorists in the 9/11 attack. The result appears to be a stalemate.\n\nIraq. The goal is a bit hard to determine - on the surface it was to enforce resolutions on weapons of mass destruction (which Iraq did have, poison gas), although post 9/11 paranoia was probably a factor. The result was to unleash an internal Sunni/Shia or Arab/Persian internal conflict, which finally died down when enough people were killed.\n\nLibya. The goal was to stabilize the oil supply from that area. The result was to leave the country in wreckage, governed by warlords.\n\nSyria. The goal is hard to determine. A situation very similar to Iraq: another Arab/Persian tinderbox, the warring sides held apart by a brutal dictator. Syria has no oil, so economic intervention doesn't come into play.\n\nTwo conflicts that met the criteria for the wars listed above, but there was no intervention:\n\nRwanda. A Huti/Tutsi conflict, with over one million people killed as a matter of genocide. Thanks to the miracle of communications, the world watched this happen.\n\nCrimea. Somewhat similar to the Gulf War situation: Russia occupied Crimea with troops, and held an 'election' to determine if Crimea wanted to become part of Russia. Surprise - with Russian troops all over the place, they did want to become part of Russia.\n\nIn both cases, the lack of external economic interests in the affected areas may have been a factor in the lack of a response.\n\nTo address the original question - the recent wars of regime change appear to have two motivations: either economic interests on the part of the intervening nations, or to stop genocide. In that respect, only the Yugoslavia situation can be said to have been relatively successful. The rest have either been stalemates, or have left the affected nations in far worse shape than before."
