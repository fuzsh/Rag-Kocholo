        "text": "Its basically the 19th century, and big things are happening elsewhere in the world, such as the Napoleonic Wars. This war had greatly affected every country in Europe, which revolutionary ideals and the concept of a republic and democracy had been implanted through subjugation, the redrawing of European borders (especially for Germany in which from 300+ states that existed before the mediatisation of the Holy Roman Empire to just less than 50 in a now, more consolidated but still separate states of the new German Confederation), the slowing of economies (due to Napoleon's blockade against the Brits), and others.\n\nBut this impact had no greater effect than the Spanish empire, in which due to its heavy involvement in the war caused it to completely weaken of the remains of its once, feared might that it had enjoyed for more than 2 centuries. Juntas were established in every part of the Americas to protect themselves from French aggression, later they rallied the independence of numerous nations across its empire (along with Portuguese Brazil) that saw Spain's biggest loss of territory in its entire history (the next would come nearly 70 years later) and left it in a much weaker state. It tried numerous attempts to reconquer its territory from one of its remaining possession of Cuba but was unsuccessful due to its growing issues at home and the United States' policy regarding colonialism in the New World (Monroe Doctrine).\n\nIn the Philippines, these revolutionary ideals began to spread in the late 18th century, due to the Economic Society of Friends of the Country, being founded in the Philippines by Jose Basco y Vargas (The first of these was founded in Spain in 1765) that revived the tobacco industry in the Philippines and caused basis for the massive growth of Philippine agricultural export, with a policy of tolerance toward (theoretically) illegal activity of foreign retailers, mainly the English and North Americans, who went to Manila to complete their product shipments. It also made the Philippines independent of Mexican and Spanish trade. Along with these, ideals of the American Revolution were first imported to the islands by American sailors, along with the occurring Enlightenment in the mainland. This attracted the insulars and some principalia, forming several groups centered to these ideals. The most prominent one was the Sons of the Country, founded in 1796 by Luis Rodriguez de Varela, more popularly known as El Conde Filipino. Other prominent members of the society included Jose Ortega (co-founder) and Domingo Roxas (joined 1816).\n\nThe Sons of the Country were tasked in spreading Enlightenment and liberal ideals and the supporting of reforms, such as the vaccination of Filipinos by Governor-General Rafael Maria de Aguilar in 1806, and the supporting of economic reforms.\n\nHowever, things took a drastic turn for the society in the years following. Believing that liberalism and revolutionary ideals were the main reason that the Spanish lost its main territories, they began to slowly replace the insulars with those coming from the peninsula.[1] This affected the Crown's relations with the local authorities, which was not going to sit idly and watch their positions which they held loyally and well taken by peninsulars which knew nothing of the islands at all (except the governor-general himself). Many of those criollo authorities (along with some principalia) were members of the Sons.\n\nThe Spanish also exiled what they thought to be conspiring against the government. They deported many of these to Mindanao to fight the Moros, while others were deported to Spanish penal colonies or to Spain itself, This included Varela which was arrested and exiled back to Spain while strolling in Tondo. Others, however, escaped exile, such as Fransisco Bayot, who was scheduled to be exiled on August 4, 1819, but escaped and hid in a new identity of Carlos Palaran. Leadership of the society went to Varela's co-founder, Ortega.\n\nAlthough most members wish to repair ties with the government, persecution against the society were continued in accordance with Spanish policies. So they decided that, like their brothers on the other side as well as the United States, they should join them as a free nation as well. They have secretly been training troops by several captains that were members of the Sons and purchasing guns through private and illegal companies who either had sympathy for the society or wanted to profit off by selling these illegal weapons. They also made their own improvised weapons, such as the lantakas, cannons used in pre-colonial Philippines and in the early Spanish period.\n\nThey also began establishing bases of operation throughout Central Luzon, in which they planned it to be the first part of the Philippines to be liberated before Luzon.\n\n[1] - In our world, the policy has been largely successful and kept the Philippines under Spanish rule for three more generations until Bonifacio's Cry of Balintawak, or Pugad Lawin on August 30, 1896. In this world, the policy had a fatal effect on the colonial government that resulted in the rebellion.\n\nWar had formally entered Philippine soil since the arrival of the British in 1762 of the Seven Years War. Uprisings soon followed after the mutiny in Maragondon. Although it would not be easy for the rebels to take control of the countryside due to the friar's influence over it[1]. Ortega himself immediately declared himself as the commander-in-chief of the rebellion. They first took over Bi√±an following the mutiny in Maragondon but was surprised when all of a sudden most soldiers of the Laguna Provincial Militia stationed in the town sided with the rebels. This is due to the fact that most soldiers are either Indios, or Latin Americans that were stationed in the Philippines sympathized with the rebels since they were rarely paid, and discriminated by their Spanish counterparts regardless of race. Having new reinforcements, the rebels captured the entirety of western Laguna by March 19 save for San Pedro that was defended by the soldiers that had not defected to them.\n\nThe revolution spread from Laguna to different provinces. In Bulacan, rebels took over the towns of Bigaa[2], Angat and Baliuag, as well as northernmost town of San Ildefonso simultaneously[3] at the same time on March 17. Survivors of Uban's mutiny in Cavite launched another revolt in the mountains of Palay[4], and in Batangas two captains of the provincial militia named Pedro Calalang[*] and Juanito Niugan[*], launched a revolt in Tanauan and expanded their rule to the coast, cutting off communications between Manila and Batangas. They also attempted to take Balayan on March 19 but was repulsed back by loyalist soldiers.\n\nOn March 20, Captain Marcos Colatiangco[*] rebelled and captured the town and capital of Tayabas province[5], causing the entirety of its west to fall in rebel hands 3 days later save for the besieged towns of Tiaong, Sariraya and Lucena.\n\nIn Ilocos Norte, Adriano Naglauay[*], a local of Piddig and a member of the Sons and inspired by the first two Ilocan revolts, started a revolt with the Sons' members along with veterans of the Basi revolt on March 24 in response to the revolt down south. He had long desired to see Ilocos free of Spanish domination. become its governor and adapt reforms. By March 28 they had essentially controlled the same territory as the Basi rebels had, along with the town of Bangui in the north.\n\nThe Spanish, shocked at the immediate revolts simultaneously popping up panicked and immediately mobilized its forces in the Philippines to fight the rebels. The first battle between the two was the Battle of Bay, on April 3 when the Spaniards tried to protect the rest of Laguna from falling to the rebels. Due to better weaponry and traning, the rebels defeated the Spaniards and caused the rest of Laguna to fall, except for the region surrounding Pagsanjan, the towns of Baras, Morong, Infanta and Jalajala in the north[6], and the the towns of Calamba in the coast and Pila in the south.\n\nOn April 10, the Palmero brothers by the names of Andres and Antonio along with Jose de Azcarraga rebelled against the Spanish in the town of Libmanan, Ambos Camarines[7], and rapidly captured the entirety of the province, capturing Nueva Caceres[8], its capital on April 19. The towns of Daet, Capalonga, Paracale, Caramoan and Sag√±ay, as well as the most of the countryside continued to held out against the rebels. Azcarraga then fought at the Battle of Libon at April 24, capturing northwestern Albay. The revolt in Ambos Camarines is a fatal blow to the Spanish as that region held some of the most valuable shipyards for the Spanish to use in patrolling against Moro pirates and for trading. Meanwhile, construction of whats known as the Mayon Line began on April 23 and completed on May 19, serving as a fortified border between Albay and Ambos Camarines held by the rebels.\n\nRoxas then began establishing forts and bases across rebel-controlled Laguna. This was followed by the rebels in the rest of Central Luzon a week later.\n\nRoxas then later launched a campaign to conquer Cavite. With the help of Uban's remnants and bandits-turned soldiers, Cavite surrendered without a fight between April 10 and April 21, except some few skirmishes in Silang and Naic. Northern Cavite remained under Spanish domination.\n\nThe revolution is a total nightmare for Martinez. Never had a governor-general of the Captaincy see such a sheer number of revolts and uprisings simultaneously in the 258 years the Spanish has been here. Martinez, for possible safety, moved to Bacolor in Pampanga as his base while the lieutenant-governor and predecessor Mariano Fernandez de Folgueras was put in charge in defense of Manila province. He also dispatched 5 ships from Puerto de Cavite bound for Spain to ask more reinforcements and help from the Spanish government. Not to mention that most Spanish troops in the Philippines were scattered across the archipelago therefore making the rebels act more swiftly. He also ordered the alcalde mayor of Cebu to crush the Bohol Republic, as he feared that this state, who was rebelling for nearly 70 years now might be used by the Sons as a base of operations in Visayas.\n\nThe Spanish continued to suffer defeats in May, in which most of Batangas after the battle of Taal Lake was captured save for the coastal towns. In Bulacan the rebels took Quingua[9], Guiguinto and Calumpit on May 13, on May 17 the first town to fall in Manila province was Las Pi√±as, and on May 23 the town of Mayumo[10] was captured.\n\nThings were looking bad for the Spanish. However, they would not expect that in the following days, the nightmare would only grow worse coming in their own capital, Manila.\n\n[*] - Fictional names\n\n[1] - Most of the times, in despair and ruin, or in a bad situation the friars were the main ones that led the natives.\n\n[2] - The town of San Miguel at the time was still Pampangue√±o before 1849.\n\n[3] - Renamed Balagtas in 1966\n\n[4] - Mounts Palay-Palay-Na-Gulod, in Maragondon, Cavite\n\n[5] - Renamed as Quezon province, 1946\n\n[6] - Infanta, Quezon, and the towns of Rizal mentioned here are still part of Laguna before the creation of Morong District (1853) and Infanta Commandancy (1856)\n\n[7] - Currently divided between Camarines Norte and Sur\n\n[8] - Renamed Naga in 1919\n\n[9] - Renamed Plaridel in 1936\n\n[10] - San Miguel, Bulacan. Also known as San Miguel de Mayumo\n\nAndres Novales y de la Cruz was a creole born in 1800 to Carlos Novales and Conchita de la Cruz[1] in Tondo, Manila province[2]. Initially, along with his brother Mariano, who was 3 years older, they were groomed by their father to become military officers. Both became cadets at the age of 7 and 10, respectively, and became lieutenants at ages 14 and 17. The young Novales had shown his prowess in the military by either patrolling the area of Manila as part of the urban militia or volunteering to fight the Moro pirates raiding the Christian coast.\n\nWhen war broke out in Spain in 1807, Novales wanted to volunteer to fight the French off the mainland. His father disagreed since he was too young and argued that he should only join at the right age. However the child continued to aspire joining the Spanish guerillas in combat with the French. His father finally, but reluctantly allowed Novales to join the war, as only a cadet at aged 12. The young cadet would surprise everyone by leading guerilla attacks on the French at night, which was highly effective. He also learnt how to lead an army, how to command and how to plan an attack at the enemy, that would cause his promotion as a lieutenant in 1814. Despite this, he returned to the Philippines with the rank of captain, he was later assigned to lead the King's Regiment. He was also inspired at the French revolutionary ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity, as well as the concept of a nation and democracy, that would cause him to join the Sons in 1819.\n\nHowever, his relationship with Spain would took on a drastic turn. All of a sudden, Peninsulars began taking over the government, both military and civil. Protests were prohibited, and those who do not comply were either exiled to Spain, Mindanao or penal colonies. Novales was exiled to Mindanao, but later returned to Manila under the identity of Sebastian Ypo. He sympathized with several creoles, including Varela.\n\nWhen rebellion broke out in 1823, Novales initially held a meeting with his former lieutenants and corporals on what should they do. They were exactly divided on how to respond: one faction wanted to support the rebels under Ruiz Calba[3], while another faction supported neutrality under Mariano. Mariano himself had ties with the governor-general Martinez, and so joining the rebellion would not only result in his exile, it would also completely tarnish the Novales' image as a loyalist family to Spain. Nevertheless the faction led by Calba had succeeded, and they planned to attack on the middle of the night.\n\nOn June 1, they went out to start a revolt. They seized the royal palace, the Manila Cathedral, the city hall and other important government buildings in Intramuros. To the surprise of Novales, the townsfolk and even some local clergy rallied at his support shouting battle cries like \"Viva la independencia\" and \"Kalayaan para sa Pilipinas!\". Failing to find Martinez, they instead captured Folgueras, then executed by hanging at the Plaza by his sergeants. He also went to Fort Santiago to persuade his brother to join his revolution. Mariano was reluctant to accept, but later joined due to his brother's promise to make him his the general of the armies. He then prepared to make a speech in front of the hundreds of people watching towards him from the top of the Palacio:\n\nThe day has come for the Philippines to declare its independence from mother Spain. For two centuries, we were nothing but a trading post and penal colony, being almost forgotten by our superiors in Madrid and was overlooked when we are part of the Viceroyalty (New Spain). We, creoles, mestizos and Indios had served them loyally for hundreds of years, but repayed us with oppression and persecution of the ideals of liberty.\n\nI, now therefore, declare that this backwater archipelago of the Far East, shall now be a beacon of democracy, liberty, and freedom just like the former British colonies of the New World that inspired our Hispanic brothers from the other side to revolt for theirs. Not even a single inch of Philippine soil shall remain in Spanish hands and the Almighty shall guide us into this road of independence. Long live the Empire! Long live the Philippines and its people! Long live this freedom!\n\nDown to the oppressive friars and of the Peninsulars!\n\nOn the next day, June 2, Novales crowned himself as Andrew I, Filipino Emperor in Napoleonic fashion rather than Andrew I, Emperor of the Philippine Islands. He initially thought that a monarch should serve as the head of the people and not just a monarch of a certain domain. He also argued that a monarch should serve as a \"servant of the state\" embodied by Frederick II, the Great of Prussia, a monarch in which Novales was deeply inspired by his efficient administration. He sent out envoys to different parts of the revolution to recognize him as emperor.\n\n[1] - Identified only as Andres Novales and parents' names are unknown.\n\n[2] - Metro Manila\n\n[3] - Identified only as Ruiz.\n\nThe day is June 10, in which the representatives of the rebel leaders and of the provinces controlled by them had arrived from dawn to morning. The first Imperial Assembly was held at the Palacio.\n\nThey met Andrew I in the Palacio del Gobernador, now renamed Palacio Imperial on the front of the Plaza. There, they discussed on what the future Philippine state should look like. Juan Catalon[*], one of the representatives of Batangas, suggested that it should be an absolutist state. Another, Antonio Manocan[*]of Cavite, believed it should be a republican state inspired by the United States. Others, such as Beto Amarhangui[*] of Manila and Joven Arao[*] of Laguna contended that it should be a federation, also modeled after the United States, and a government that of the Polish state. It was initially agreed that the new Philippines, as an independent nation shall be a unitary monarchy with elements of a republic, or in other words, a mixed government.\n\nThe emperor then presented a design of a flag of the Philippine state:\n\nAccording to Andrew I's own words, the colors of the flag and CoA symbolize the following:\n\nRed represents valor, bravery and patriotism for the fatherland\n\nBlue represents peace, serenity and prosperity.\n\nThe gold sealion symbolizes a shift from being a possession(silver) to a nation(gold). The sun was inspired by the United Provinces of Rio de la Plata while the 3 stars represents the main groups of islands: Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.\n\nIt was also agreed that the civil flag would be the same, just without the CoA. The former silver sealion was used as a naval flag.\n\nNext is the establishment of a standing army. Andrew put his brother Mariano the general of all Philippine armies, while putting Calba as his brother's camp-de-aide. He established the Emperor's Guard, a merging of the King's Regiment and some of the urban militia of Manila. He abolished the Luzon Dragoons and used the money funded for it to create 5 new dragoons and 5,000 troops. He subdivided the provincial militias into regiments, squadrons, and battalions. Each municipality or city shall have its local police as well as hussars.\n\nAndrew also had to establish a navy from scratch. The state only had 5 vessels that were converted to warships. He needed to connect his territories from the Palmero's territorial control for more warships to be constructed. Academies for the army and navy shall be established, with the former being in Manila and the latter in Nueva Caceres.\n\nHe also established the position of president, which in the current situation was vacant. Varela was posthomously granted this title.\n\nAndrew established the following departments: War and Defense, Interior and Global Affairs, Treasury, Education and Land and Water Resources. He also appointed Pedro Perez de Tagle to lead the first embassy of the Philippines abroad, to seek recognition of Philippine independence.\n\nAlthough the Philippines was self-sufficient since the time of Basco, international trade was still restricted merely to just only Spain (and Mexico before 1815), so he abolished Spanish restrictions on foreigners and allowed them to trade in ports under Philippine control. He also abolished most of forced labor, including slavery, although he initially kept Polo y servicios but as a punishment for criminals. He declared that the new system of labor would be paid servitude.\n\nAndrew then approached Juan Antonio Zulaibar, the archbishop of Manila at the time, to accept land reforms. Obviously, in friar fashion he refused, and threatened to excommunicate him if he didn't pledge loyalty back to Spain. Andrew responded by threatening to cut ties with the Roman Catholic Church and inviting American and British pastors to preach and convert the Philippines into a Protestant nation. The archbishop was then forced to accept reforms, fearing the loss of one of the few Roman Catholic bastions in Asia.\n\nThe next day, it was debated on whether to expel Spanish friars or to kept them. Some representatives wanted to expel them while others refused to do so since it would meant a lack of parish priests across the Philippines. Ultimately, Zulaibar, under pressure decided that friars would remain but would train new priests, Indio or mestizo for clergy in the future.\n\nThey also tackled on what exactly to do with the Moro sultanates of the south. Even before the Spanish arrived, Moros raided Hindu, Buddhist and animist states in the Philippines, with the Visayans being the ones most affected. Thats why when the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, the Visayans, especially the people of the former Madyas confederation joined the Spanish in conquering the islands, as well as being garrisons to defend against such piratical raids. Although they had a patrol fleet called \"Armada de los Pintados\" tasked to defend the Visayan islands as well as Luzon from raids, by the late 18th century they were mostly run by few and thus Moro raids across the Philippines intensified, with some even reaching far-away provinces such as Zambales. They ultimately agreed that this one would be put on the shelf, although a plan has been drafted that an embassy shall be sent to the Moro regions to sign treaties of peace.\n\nAndrew created the first bank and mint in the Philippines that would issue Philippine pesos. Although at the moment he allowed the usage of Spanish currency, due to the fact that it is still the mostly widely used currency at the time. And to ensure that each reform shall be implemented, each rebel commander shall receive a copy of these reforms and were instructed to implement them to the public.\n\nFinally, the Constitution of 1823 was implemented and adopted by the Imperial Assembly. The constitution declares that a Filipino should have to speak Spanish, renounce any loyalties to other states and abide to Filipino laws. Males aged 18 above shall vote. Freedom of religion and the separation of church and state shall be realized and mandatory service, both civil and military. The section regarding citizenship was later changed to just renouncing loyalties to foreign states and abide laws due to the fact that its mostly unpopular by those who sought to preserve indigenous languages (Tagalog, Kapampangan, Ilocano, Sambal, etc...) and those who were not educated in the Spanish language. There was no official anthem yet, although a melody of a liturgical song, Letra en Tagalo was used and later given new lyrics regarding indpendence and is treated as a de facto anthem as such.\n\nHaving all the essentials for an independent state, Andrew I and the representatives signed the Philippine declaration of independence on June 12, in the balcony of the Palacio Imperial, with thousands of people shouting \"Viva la Independencia!\" at the bottom along with the unfurling of the first Philippine flag.\n\n[*] - Fictional names"
