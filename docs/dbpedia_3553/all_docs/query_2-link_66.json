This document summarizes the key events of the Philippine-American War from 1899-1902, including:\n\n1) After the US defeated Spain in 1898, the Filipinos declared independence but the US did not recognize their sovereignty and conflict was inevitable. Fighting broke out in 1899. \n\n2) Guerrilla warfare ensued as Filipino forces retreated north. The insurrection effectively ended with Aguinaldo's capture in 1901, though sporadic fighting continued for several more years. \n\n3) An estimated 20,000 Filipino combatants and 200,000 civilians died from combat, hunger or disease while the US suffered around 4,300 deaths. The war resulted in undisputed US control over the Philippines.",
