This may contain fictional personalities, incorrect grammar, ASB-ish moments and other things you may find annoying. Please bear with me, since this is my first time doing this.\n\nNow, without further ado, let's begin...\n\n***\n\nBackground\n\nSpain entered a period of instability at the start of the 19th century, beginning with the Peninsular War; a conflict that left the country in ruins. During the time that Spain has no king, Spanish liberals assembled at Cádiz to create a constitution, hoping that it could change the nation for the better. However after Napoleon's forces withdrew from Spain in 1814 the new monarch, Fernando VII, rejected the constitution, and have arrested those who dare oppose him.\n\nThe colonies of Spain had also began to demand reforms. During the time of the 1812 Cortes, representatives from across the Spanish Empire clamored for self-governance. But their hopes were dashed after the restoration of the monarchy, which tried to reinstate the old, oppressive order. Left with no alternative, the viceroyalties of New Spain, New Granada, Perú and Rio de la Plata declared independence from the Spanish Crown.\n\nThe Philippine Islands were the furthermost possession of Spain, and its only one in Asia. For centuries, it was controlled by the powerful (and corrupt) religious orders, and their allies from the colonial government, like a personal fiefdom. However, by the end of the 1700s things began to change. With the opening of Manila to international trade, foreign products made their way upon this side of the world; among them were printed materials containing ideas from the Age of Enlightenment. Consequently, the Philippines began to transform itself from a mercantilist economy into an proto-capitalist one. This created a lot of opportunities to many people, who in turn began to amass a fortune in trade, which in turn gave rise to the first middle class.\n\nThese middle class slowly began to embrace the ideology of liberalism, and started to address the injustices by the colonial authorities. This doesn't go unnoticed, however. The religious orders felt threatened by the new intelligentsia. So they started to scheme against them.\n\nOnward to Independence: Part 1\n\nTo prevent a repeat of what happened in Mexico and South America, Madrid began to implement stricter policies to limit the growing clout of the insulars (criollos and mestizos) on their remaining colonies (i.e. the Philippines), such as demoting or removing them from important positions in the government and military, to be replaced with more loyal elements. This earned the outrage of the insulars, who protested against such discriminatory action. However, their pleas fell on deaf ears. By hindsight, the problem could be solved peacefully. But the central government, still bitter over the loss of the Americas, refused to see reason. This stubborness was a major blunder, which later elicited an unexpected result.\n\nAndrés Novales was a criollo army officer. After his stint at the Peninsular War, he returned to the Philippines with the rank of captain. Much to his dismay, nothing changed in his homeland. Insulars like him were still treated as inferior. The last straw for him was when he learned of the new policy by the colonial government. At that point he had enough. On 1 June 1823, Novales and 800 other disgruntled soldiers staged a mutiny, and marched towards Manila. The mutineers caught the Spaniards by surprise, resulting in an easy victory. The capital city was virtually conquered within hours. But there stood one last bastion: Fort Santiago. Novales immediately went there to demand its surrender. The fort's commander, his brother Antonio, initially refuse. It was only after an intense negotiation that Antonio, with some reluctance, opened the gates of the fort [1]. Victory was finally secured.\n\nThe actions by Andrés Novales inspired the local populace to rose up against the oppressive system. A few days after the mutiny, multiple uprisings broke out across the nearby provinces. Meanwhile the Governor General, Juan Antonio Martînez, managed to escape from Manila in the midst of chaos. In Pampanga he immediately reorganized all remaining Spanish troops for a counterattack. In response to the threat, Novales declared the independence of the Philippines on 12 June 1823, and called for nationwide struggle for liberation. This marked the beginning of the Philippine War of Independence.\n\n***\n\n[1] The POD\n\nOnward to Independence: Part 2\n\nShortly after the declaration of independence, Andrés Novales sanctioned the formation of a Provisional Junta to replace the Royalist government. Elections were held to to fill in the new congress, but suffrage was only limited to males. The Junta was opened on 20 June, and its first assignment was the drafting of a constitution.\n\nMeanwhile Novales returned to the field once again, leading a new army against Governor Juan Antonio Martínez. The two sides clashed in Bulacán for several weeks, culminating in a major battle at the town of Quingua on 10 July, where the rebels smashed the Spanish forces, pushing them back to the north. Unfazed, Martínez renewed his offensive, this time through Tayabas. But his deputy Mariano Fernández de Folgueras, who was assigned to spearhead the assault, was stopped by Regino Mijares and Juan Santiago Ruiz [1] near Baler on 15 July. This forced Martínez to fall back to Pampanga to recuperate.\n\nIn Cavite a rebellion was instigated by the conservative elements (headed by the friars), who rejected the Provisional Junta and branded them as heretics. Using their influence, the friars managed to rally a sizeable force of religious fanatics, which started to attack republican troops and civilians. The Junta was initially surprised at this turn of events, but afterwards enacted a swift response. Using the services of the then-renowned insurgent Juan de Silvestre, a volunteer militia was raised to deal with the reactionaries. In just a few days, the insurrection was over. The plotters were arrested and sent to prison.\n\nThe war resumed in August, with Novales taking the initiative. He fought his way through San Fernando where Martínez' army was entrenched, preparing for a siege. In reality, it was a ploy; Martínez actually wanted to lure the rebels into Pampanga as Folgueras will secretly dash through Bulacan in an attempt to encircle Novales. He almost succeeded, if not for the timely arrival of Antonio Novales, who defeated Folgueras at San Rafael, killing the Spanish general in the process. It was a disaster for Martínez, who now have to face a reinforced rebel army with a 3:1 odds. Thus, he decided to retreat again, leaving Pampanga in the hands of the Junta.\n\nPampanga's fall triggered widespread uprisings across northern Luzon. Without reinforcements, the scattered Spanish garrisons fell quickly. By August's end, virtually all of Luzon is now under the Junta's jurisdiction; with the exception of the Cagayán Valley.\n\nRebellions had also began in Visayas by mid-August. In a span of a few weeks the provinces of Ilo-ílo, Cápiz, Antique, Negros, Cebú and Bohol declared independence from Spain, and its intentions to join the Provisional Junta. Leite and Samar followed suit by the end of August.\n\nThe string of defeats at the hands of Filipino rebels exposed the inability of the Spanish troops to defend the colonies. For Martínez, he realized that he needed Madrid's aid now more than ever, or risk the islands slipping away from Spain. On the other hand, Novales knew that the Royalists are now at the brink of collapse, and prepared for one last push, as the war of independece entered its final phase.\n\n***\n\n[1] Fictional full name for Lieutenant Ruiz, who assisted Novales in his mutiny in OTL; his real first name was never recorded\n\nOnward to Independence: Part 3\n\nThe Provisional Junta spend months in drafting a constitution. Using the Cádiz Constitution as a model, the delegates began its deliberations. Some of the issues tackled were the extent of reforms, relations between the central government and the provinces (a great majority favored federalism), and those related to religion. The Junta immediately shown signs of division between different camps: the liberals, who advocated rapid implementation of reforms, the moderates which prefer a more gradual transition, and the conservatives which protected the interests of the church. Fortunately, the three parties managed to compromise, and succeeded in creating a constitution favorable to all of them. The 1823 Constitution was finally finished on 30 August, and initially ratified by 8 provinces on 1 September, which was followed by several more in the following weeks. The next assignment for the Junta is to prepare for the elections of a permanent government, the National Assembly.\n\nMeanwhile, Novales finished his preparations for what he planned as the final offensive. On 21 September he embarked on a long march towards the Cagayán Valley. On the other side, Governor Martínez had also finished preparing his defenses along the Sierra Madre mountains, hoping to make the rebels bleed for every inch of land, and to stall some time for reinforcements to come. Unfortunately, Madrid remained in the dark about the happenings in their Asian colony, as Spain herself is embroiled in a conflict between Fernando VII and the liberals, not to mention the still ongoing wars in South America. The Cagayán Campaign, as it is now called, started on late September, with generals Ruiz and Mijares launching simultaneous skirmishes along southern Cagayan.\n\nGovernor Martínez eagerly expected Novales' frontal attack, but for some reason it never came. As October opened up, the Spanish governor became tired of waiting, and issued an order for a counterattack. It was then that he received a shocking news: the rebel army personally led by Novales was now rapidly advancing towards his rear. Another shocking revelation was that his enemy brought with him a contingent of Igorot mercenaries, meaning Novales outflanked Martínez by crossing the Cordillera Mountains, which has been a graveyard for many Spaniards for centuries, and had even managed to get support from the mountain tribes. Martínez' situation suddenly became more dangerous now that he's fighting on two fronts. But the seasoned general regained his composure and immediately reassessed his strategy.\n\nAs the rebels in southern Cagayán continued to pound the Spanish defenders there, Novales faced Martínez once again near Santiago, in a battle characterized by brutal closed quarters fighting. Martínez gained the upper hand here, and started to pursue the retreating rebels. But Novales had a plan of his own. As Martínez advanced further north, newly-raised insurgent bands began to harass Spanish supply lines. When the Spaniards reached Ilagan on 12 October, Martínez had already exhausted his men and supplies. Thus, they were woefully unprepared for Novales' counterattack. The Battle of Ilagan became a crushing defeat for the Spanish force, in which only a handful (including Martínez himself) managed to retreat back to Palanan. This coincided with Ruiz' breakout in southern Cagayán, who started to steamroll his way up north to link up with Novales. By late October the situation went helpless, as the remaining Spanish troops were stuck in Palanan, which was being besieged by the rebels. Finally, Martínez decided to evacuate most of his staff by ship, sailing towards the Batanes Islands, to continue the fight from there. Three days later, Palanan surrenders.\n\n***\n\nNote: Santiago, Ilagan and Palanan are all part of the province of Isabela in OTL. But during this time, it was part of Cagayán"
