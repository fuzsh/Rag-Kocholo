        "text": "There are two main kinds of war: international and intranational. International wars are fought between countries or groups of countries. The Iran-Iraq War (1980–90) was an international war between two countries, Iran and Iraq. World War I (1914–18) and World War II (1939–45) were international wars fought between groups of countries.\n\nIntranational wars are fought between groups within a country. Intranational wars are also known as civil wars, rebellions, or revolutions. Civil wars are wars between two groups of citizens of the same country. The American Civil War (1861–65) started when the Southern states seceded, or separated, from the United States. The Northern states fought to keep this from happening. A rebellion is when citizens rise up against their government and demand change. It may or may not be successful. Revolutions are like rebellions, but in a revolution a group succeeds in overthrowing the existing government. That group usually establishes a new government.\n\nEarly Wars\n\nIn the earliest wars people fought with simple weapons—for example, wooden clubs, rocks, spears, and bows and arrows. After people learned how to use metals, they fought with swords and other sharp weapons. They also made better bows and arrows.\n\nFor many centuries people fought on foot. About 4,000 years ago armies began to use horses to pull carts called chariots. Armed fighters later began to ride horses into battle.\n\nEuropean fighters first used gunpowder in the 1300s. They used it to blast castle walls and to shoot arrowlike missiles from tubes. Europeans invented the big guns called artillery, including cannons, during this time. In the mid-1400s European inventors made the first rifles and handguns. For the first time soldiers on foot could carry guns.\n\nModern War\n\nA huge change in war happened in the 1800s, during the Industrial Revolution. (The Industrial Revolution was a time when people invented new ways to make goods quickly and cheaply.) Large numbers of guns became available for armies. Guns also became more powerful and accurate. The first machine guns appeared in the late 1800s.\n\nOther inventions allowed people to fight much larger wars. Steam engines allowed warships to move around without depending on wind. Telegraphs allowed fast communication between troops. Railroads moved troops and supplies farther and faster. All these new developments made war much more destructive.\n\nThe next major advance in war came with the use of airplanes during World War I. Pilots could now drop bombs from the air. Armies also used tanks, submarines, and chemical weapons (weapons that released poisonous gas) during this war.\n\nDuring World War II tanks and many other kinds of weapons improved. But the biggest change of all was the development of the atomic bomb, the first nuclear weapon. The United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japanese cities during World War II. These bombs killed more than 100,000 people instantly.\n\nAfter World War II a group of countries formed the United Nations. This organization tries to keep countries from going to war. Many countries also agreed to some new rules of war. These rules are included in a set of agreements called the Geneva Conventions. One of the rules is that warring countries should try not to harm civilians (people not in the military)."
