        "text": "After an assortment of various Devil films in the 1940s (but only one of them truly great), the 1950s saw a steep decline in anything even resembling a serious portrayal. There were a few oddballs here and there, like the film adaptation of the musical Damn Yankees and a truly bizarre film called The Story of Mankind that features… ugh… a court case between the Devil and “The Spirit of Man.” So we’re just doing a court case again? It’s trying to chronicle the entire history of mankind, but it’s only 90 minutes long.\n\nSadly, it features Vincent Price’s only turn as the Prince of Darkness, and he might be the only person who isn’t miscast (Harpo Marx as Isaac Newton? Dennis Hopper as Napoleon?) No, the only film from the ’50s that is really worth talking about here is the 1957 horror film Night of the Demon.\n\nDirector Jacques Tourneur was a student of Val Lewton, and here he perfects the formula and creates a near-flawless psychological horror-thriller… near-flawless. Dr. John Holden (Dana Andrews) is an American psychologist who has come to Britain for a convention, where he discovers a strange Devil-worshipping cult. Cult may even be generous as it’s merely a small circle of a few people, but its leader Dr. Julian Karswell (Niall MacGinnis) definitely holds sway over the members. It’s a fish-out-of-water story as Holden is definitely a stranger in a strange land, being an American agnostic up against something older and spiritual.\n\nOne night, a man leaves the home of Karswell and dies under mysterious circumstances… at least, that’s how Tourneur’s original vision had it going. In the film that was re-cut by the studio, instead of the possibility that the man was killed by a demon from Hell, we just see it in full light only a few minutes into the movie.\n\nI’ve actually flip-flopped back and forth on whether the creature design is actually effective, but that’s not the point. Tourneur’s film is not a creature feature in any way, and the studio tried to make it one. As far as movie monsters go, it’s pretty good, but it’s just not the kind of movie Tourneur wanted it to be, and that’s my real problem with the studio-edited version of Night of the Demon.\n\nThe set-up is quite an interesting one—Karswell gives Holden a rune that says he will die in a few short days, and while Holden scoffs at it, his fear increases as the days go on. The real theme of the film is belief vs. non-belief and what horrible things belief can make someone do, whether or not their belief is in something real. For example, there’s a scene where Karswell claims he will conjure a storm, and sure enough, a storm comes. Did he actually conjure it? Did he just have a good weather report? Was he just lucky? It’s left ambiguous. There’s another brilliant scene, my favorite in the film, where Holden is leaving Karswell’s mansion, and Karswell tells him to go out the front door, but Holden insists on leaving the back way which he came. He hears noises and seems to be chased by a mist, but we never know if anything is real or just a manifestation of the man’s growing fear.\n\nIt’s an absolutely brilliant scene packed with tension, but it does lose a bit if we already know the demons in this film are objectively real.\n\nIn the final scene, Holden finds a clever way to pass the rune off to Karswell instead, and it’s Karswell who suffers death at the hand of a monstrous demon on a railroad track. Even with the demon being shown, it’s a brilliantly effective scene, but the themes really suggest the movie would work better without it. Karswell is genuinely horrified, because he is a true believer in the monsters of Hell, but Holden refuses to look on, saying maybe it’s better that he doesn’t know.\n\nAgain, it seems Tourneur wanted to leave the option open that maybe Karswell just died from a train running him over, or even (more interestingly) from his own fear, but the studio cut makes it abundantly clear it was a flesh-and-blood demon.\n\nDespite its one big fault, Night of the Demon is a really great horror film, and there’s a believable romance between Holden and Joanna Harrington (Peggy Cummins) that adds to the plot instead of distracting from it. It’s brilliantly paced, and features one of my favorite underrated villains in the devilishly charming Karswell. Sadly, it’s the only great Devil film of the ’50s.\n\nThe 1960s however slowly brought them back. There weren’t a ton, and they weren’t all that varied in their portrayal, but they did exist. The films would include most if not all of these characteristics:\n\nSet in Europe.\n\nSet in the past.\n\nA conspiracy of Devil worshippers that must be uncloaked.\n\nHuman sacrifice.\n\nThese are what I call the Distant Devil films. For American audiences, the horror was never next door and immediate, but rather gothic and far away. I love gothic horror and these films have great atmosphere, but they do run together a bit.\n\nThe first of these is a little-known 1960 film called City of the Dead. It was made by a British studio, but set in America, and features almost entirely British actors doing (often poor) American accents. Got that? It’s quite weird, as these actors include the indistinguishably British Christopher Lee!\n\nThe film starts in 1692 in Salem…er, Whitewood, Massachusetts. Accused witch Elizabeth Selwyn (Patricia Jessel) is taken to the stake and burned, where she cries out to Lucifer and promises her soul to him in exchange for eternal life.\n\nLook, I don’t expect historical or religious accuracy in my horror movies, and usually I don’t even want it. In a supernatural horror, I get that you need for the supernatural to exist, but having a copycat Salem Witch Trials and outright saying the murders that took place there were at least somewhat justified is really problematic. Also, no one in Salem was burned, but hey, we need a good story right?\n\nWe cut to the present day where college student Nan Barlow (Venetia Stevenson) is interested in the history of Whitewood, and decides to go there on vacation. While there, she checks into a motel run by Selwyn (posing as Mrs. Newless) and discovers that the town is basically still living as if it is 1692.\n\nHowever, she ignores warnings to leave and is killed as a human sacrifice. Apparently Satan requires two of these sacrifices a year, or they lose the rights to the town. The second half of the film concerns Nan’s brother (Dennis Lotis), her fiancée (Tom Naylor), and a sympathetic town resident (Betta St. John) investigating the truth of the town and what happened to Nan. Wait wait wait. A black-and-white horror film where a woman checks into a motel run by the villain, the woman gets killed before the halfway point, and the rest of the film features her sibling and her lover investigating her death? Was there just something in the water in 1960?\n\nCity of the Dead is a silly film, with so much fake smoke that it’s hard to imagine the actors knew where they were going.\n\nThe acting is pretty stilted, not helped by the fact that the actors are almost entirely Brits trying to sound American, and the various elements of the Devil worship just feel copied-and-pasted from other films.\n\nWhile most of these films were produced by British studios, the American director Roger Corman did give us one Devil film in his cycle of loose Edgar Allan Poe adaptations. Poe’s stories don’t lend themselves well to straight film adaptations, because so many things are intentionally ambiguous on the author’s part. For example, The Tell-Tale Heart is quite a different story depending on how you view the relationship between the narrator and the old man they kill. Maybe it’s a man killing his landlord, maybe it’s a son killing a father, or maybe it’s about a woman killing her much older, possessive husband. The old man’s creepy eye represents the watchful eye he always keeps over his young, attractive wife, and she has mixed feelings towards the man because he is, at least emotionally, abusive. Alright, enough about my takes on 19th century American literature and back to the movies. My point is that you have to make some changes to adapt Poe.\n\n“The Masque of the Red Death” is a story of the prince Prospero, a hedonistic and thoughtless leader who decides to party and have a good time during a deadly plague only to get infected by the plague at the end. (Any ties to the modern world are entirely coincidental and utterly hilarious.) Corman’s film makes the Prospero character far more evil by making him a murderous Devil worshipper who abducts women as his concubines and psychologically tortures people for fun. He’s played to perfection by Vincent Price, who, as usual, brings just the right amount of camp to the performance.\n\nThe Red Death is so named because it causes whoever is afflicted to bleed out of all pores and quickly die, and in both the story and film, a mysterious figure cloaked in red comes to Prospero’s masquerade party. In the story, everyone assumes it’s a joke, but it is revealed to have no face and be simply death itself. The film portrays Prospero as a Devil worshipper, so while he is originally livid someone is wearing red, he quickly changes his tune and assumes it is Satan himself or at least one of his minions. As Prospero learns that it isn’t, he tries to use his pact with Satan as leverage, but Death doesn’t care. While it is not entirely confirmed if the supernatural exists in the universe of Corman’s film (It’s heavily implied), it is made clear that Death doesn’t care about your beliefs. No one can outrun it, as shown by the harrowing scene where Death unmasks itself and reveals Prospero’s own face.\n\nDespite adding a lot to pad out Poe’s story, his themes remain, although seeing as how the heroic characters in the film survive, the Red Death here may be a tad more karmic.\n\nIt’s tough to adapt Poe to the screen, but this one is quite enjoyable. The religious themes tie in pretty well, and it features one of my favorite Vincent Price performances (I mean, I love them all but still). It’s atmospheric and creepy, thanks in part to the cinematography of future director Nicholas Roeg, and an uncredited John Westbrook gives an eerie performance as the voice of the Red Death.\n\nOf all the Distant Devil films, the 1966 film Eye of the Devil is the closest to feeling immediate. It takes place in Europe, and in a town stuck in the Middle Ages spiritually, but it is set in the present day with a modern protagonist.\n\nDeborah Kerr plays Catherine, who begins to worry when her rich husband Phillippe (David Niven) is called back to the village where his family vineyards are located. (Yes, every character is allegedly French, and yes there are no French accents or French actors in the film. Just go with it.) The town tries to scare Catherine away, because it is the fate of every man in Phillippe’s line to be a human sacrifice when the crops begin to fail. The film is smart in the way it switches the perspective of the novel Day of the Arrow from the husband to the wife to make it more of a mystery. We know something malicious is underway, and anyone watching the film today can probably guess where it’s going, but it teases us just enough that perhaps the town is after Catherine instead.\n\nThe performances in this film are fantastic, particularly Deborah Kerr and David Niven. Kerr hated her typecast as a proper British lady, and relished horror roles like this and The Innocents (which she considered her finest). Since Kerr’s character was going crazy in The Innocents, horror fans will wonder if her character is doing the same here. At one point, she’s surrounded by cloaked men, but it keeps cutting back-and-forth from a close-up of her to a wide shot of the men, making us wonder if they are even really there.\n\nUltimately, it turns out they’re just trying to scare her away. Niven is also brilliant as Phillippe, a man stuck between two worlds. He loves his wife, but we see a distance between them. Phillippe knows what his fate will be, but he cannot bring himself to tell her.\n\nIt’s also one of the Devil films where it feels like the writers created an actual set of religious beliefs. Unlike The Black Cat and The Seventh Victim which waved it off as “Blah blah human sacrifice” or “Oh we’re evil for fun,” this one has a definitive history and mythology behind its religion. Like covens in other films, they need to have 13 people present for their ceremonies, but they instead pretend that it’s just an odd offshoot of Christianity.\n\nTheir claim is that their number of 13 represents the 12 apostles standing in a circle and Christ in the middle, but they are actually occultists. The name is never said outright (perhaps a studio-forced censorship) but the 13th man they’re really worshipping is Satan. Like other films, their mass is a bastardization of Catholic mass, but at least this one gives us the excuse that they’re masquerading as Catholics, so it kind of makes sense. It’s also one of the first Devil films that ends on a complete downer, as the sacrifice goes through, unlike other previous films where good prevailed. Daniel Webster gets Jabez out of his contract, Dr. Werdegast saves Joan from the sacrifice, Faust saves his own soul with love. Even in City of the Dead, after Nan is sacrificed, the entire cult is brought down in the end. Here, not only is Phillippe sacrificed, but the final scene suggests the curse will pass to his son.\n\nThis idea of fate is one that would lay heavy over Devil films for years to come, but this is the first to really deal with it. Phillippe seems like a fairly normal person at first, but the town itself seems to have a hold on him, as he weakens more and bends more to their will the longer he stays there. The film’s social commentary is clear: Beliefs that are stuck in the middle ages are deadly, have troubling ideas about gender roles, and will continue to be passed on to future generations unless something deliberate is done. The beliefs may not even be mainstream in civilization, but they will continue to exist, and are dangerous to pass to children. Even though the film is still distant in its storytelling, its messaging is direct and of its time (and sadly still relevant today).\n\n1968 brought us the peak of the Distant Devil films and also gave us a Devil film that would usher in a whole new era. The former was The Devil Rides Out. I consider it the culmination of this subgenre of film, because it hits all the beats and really goes out with a bang. It’s set in England in the 1920s, the plot begins with the unmasking of a Satanic conspiracy and ends with the heroes stopping a human sacrifice. It’s as distant as they come. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Dennis Wheatley who was… problematic, to say the least. He was unashamedly classist and borderline-fascist, and always wrote stories where the rich and upper-class heroes would protect the working and lower class “simple folk.” He also was a firm believer that Devil worship and black magic were real and were serious issues facing the world, and while he was considered an expert in his time, his views are now pretty laughable. All of that aside, I’m not looking for accuracy in a movie, just a good movie. The good news is that the script is given an upgrade with the writing of Twilight Zone-regular Richard Matheson and the classy direction of Hammer Horror mainstay Terence Fisher. The Devil Rides Out is also a favorite of some British horror fans, because it has Christopher Lee playing the hero of the film, a rarity for him.\n\nLee plays Nicholas, the Duc de Richleau (Yes it’s spelled like that), the heroic royal who somehow has all kinds of religious knowledge and has to save the poor peasants from the Satanic cult run by Mocata (Charles Gray). While most of these films build tension and suspense as the characters learn about the true darkness they’re up against, the Duc apparently knows it all already, and he has to explain it to Rex (Leon Greene) in a very Holmes-and-Watson kind of way. They infiltrate the coven to rescue Tanith (Nike Arrighi) and Simon (Patrick Mower), who have fallen under its spell. There are some good scenes, and Lee and Gray are fantastic, but I can’t get past how unlikable Lee’s character can come off.\n\nMocata is the villain, sure, and he does some truly villainous things, but let’s really take a look at this from only what we learn over the course of the movie. Lee’s character Nicholas crashes a private party and tries to make his friend Simon leave. When he doesn’t leave, he punches the man out and forces him to leave anyway! Alright, alright you might say, but they’re Satan worshippers who use mind control to force Simon to stay. What’s the first thing Nicholas does when he takes Simon home? He hypnotizes him!\n\nWe are later shown Mocata hypnotizing someone to show what a monstrous villain he is, but our hero hypnotizes someone first! I guess Wheatley’s message is that hypnosis is OK if you’re hypnotizing for the right cause? Oh but it gets better.\n\nThey try to keep Tanith and Simon away, but the pair escapes and returns to Mocata. Nicholas and Rex follow them to the Salisbury Plain, where they watch what Nicholas calls a satanic baptism. At the ceremony, the cult summons The Devil and… wait wait. We’re 40 minutes into the film and the cult is just summoning The Devil willy-nilly?\n\nWhere do you go from there? Ultimately, this is another problem with The Devil Rides Out. It’s not the special effects (the goat costume is creepy enough if not perfect), but the way it’s just throwing everything against the wall. This scene in fact adds nothing to the overall narrative, and just exists for shock value, so it’s kind of odd. They might be going for the whole “evil isn’t so scary if you shine a light on it,” because the heroes turn on their headlights and break up the mass, but it seems like there was supposed to be more here.\n\nNicholas takes Tanith and Simon to the home of his friends Marie and Richard (Sarah Lawson, Paul Edgington), who agree to take them in. Again, there is a Devil worshipping cult-leader after these two, and Nicholas is just like “Hey you need to take these people in.” Marie and Richard have a young daughter! In fact, Mocata comes and begins to hypnotize Marie (Did Nicholas not factor this into the equation?), but her daughter interrupts it, and Mocata makes a new plan to kidnap the girl and make her a human sacrifice. Great going.\n\nMocata sends all kinds of black magic to attack the house, so Nicholas, Richard, Marie and Simon have to stand in a circle all night as various things attack them.\n\nTo be fair, it’s a very-well-done, suspenseful scene, culminating in the Angel of Death being unleashed, but I once again couldn’t watch without thinking what an insufferable friend Nicholas must be. “Here, just stand in this circle all night and if you step outside, you die. Sorry to get you into this, but you know, my religious interests come first since I was born into money.” Again, Mocata is horrible, and he is willing to kill a child, but he’s doing it as revenge for people meddling in his affairs right? If Nicholas had just left them alone instead of endangering his friends’ lives without their consent, none of this would have happened. They do save the girl in the end, and manage to swap out the Angel of Death taking Tanith with him taking Mocata, and it’s through literal divine intervention. It’s not a bad film, but it’s clearly one that could only come from a very specific time in film history, and therefore it feels very dated and rather silly at points. It was the end of the era, and a new one was beginning.\n\nThe other famous Devil film to be released in 1968 was of course Rosemary’s Baby, and it rang out a death knell for the Distant Devil films. Instead of being set in the Europe of the past, it was set in New York City in the present day, and the Devil worshippers weren’t some faraway cult but rather your next door neighbors. The protagonist wasn’t a rich noble or even a student of mythology, but just an everyday housewife. The story feels so real that when the supernatural horror starts to kick in, first time viewers have to wonder if it’s actually happening at all.\n\nThe old castles and gothic mansions are swapped out for a creepy but still lived-in New York apartment building, the Bramford (modeled on the Dakota, which was used for exterior shots). Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and Guy (John Cassavetes) Woodhouse are a young couple who move into a new apartment and hope to start a family.\n\nThey soon become acquainted with their neighbors Minnie (Ruth Gordon) and Roman (Sidney Blackmer), who seem to be weaseling their way into their lives.\n\nThe film’s ending is so well-known today that it’s easy to forget what a twist it was that the Satanist cult wants Rosemary to give birth to The Devil’s child. As the movie goes on, Rosemary begins to believe that she’s in a different kind of Devil film, and the cult wants to kill her baby. Everyone is out to get her, and the one character who tries to help her (Maurice Evans) is killed, but she still manages to figure out almost the entire plot on her own, and it’s painful just how close she is to the truth.\n\nWhile previous Devil films showed a Devil that reflected the times in which they were made, the commentary in Rosemary’s Baby is particularly pointed. (Or maybe a lot of people miss it, I don’t know. I’m always surprised.) Everyone in the Satanist cult tries to rob Rosemary of her free will, as she is drugged and raped by The Devil so she can give birth to his child. Even worse, they recruit her husband to help them in their scheme! When Rosemary asks why she is cut up after passing out on the bed the night before, Guy brushes it off and says that he raped her while she was sleeping. This is his cover-up for demonic rape! Her doctor (Ralph Bellamy) outright tells her not to listen to anyone else except him about her pregnancy, and he specifically says the words “Don’t read books.” This doctor is of course later revealed to be a member of the Satanic cult as well, but Rosemary’s Baby isn’t letting society as a whole off that easy. In fact, one of the most horrifying scenes comes when Rosemary escapes to a young, sensible doctor (Charles Grodin) who is definitely not a member of the cult.\n\nShe begins to tell him everything that happened, and while he seems helpful, not only does he not help, he turns her right back over to the cult! (Yes, this movie whose message is “believe women” was directed by Roman Polanski, which is obviously extremely problematic.)\n\nAs for The Devil himself, we only see him for a fleeting moment. Apparently, the mask was entirely unconvincing so we only see it in close-up for a second, but this ends up working so much better for the overall mood of the scene.\n\nRosemary does correctly think she sees The Devil, but she also sees all kinds of visions involving The Pope and JFK which are definitely not happening. There’s a longstanding rumor that the head of the Church of Satan Anton LaVey played Satan in this scene, which is entirely untrue, as Mia Farrow has said the actor Clay Tanner who played the part was entirely professional and shook her hand after the scene. (Obviously LaVey’s Church of Satan has nothing to do with the Devil worship portrayed in these horror films, but when has that stopped fearful people who don’t want to apply facts and logic?)\n\nRosemary’s Baby is a brilliant film, with everything seen through different eyes on a rewatch. Every little character quirk is in fact a deliberate chess move from the cult to bring the Antichrist into the world. The way Roman Castevet in particular tries to work his way into Guy’s good graces is particularly interesting, as he pretends to remember little details about acting performances Guy has given, and claims that he grew up around stage actors just to get Guy in his apartment more. It’s also implied that Guy did not have a good relationship with his parents, particularly his father, so he is more accepting of Roman as a father figure.\n\nI could write a whole article about the little subtleties and nuances in Ira Levin’s writing, but I’ll leave it just at the naming of the characters. The head of the cult who wants to birth the Antichrist is named Roman, as in the Roman Empire who had Jesus killed. Rosemary’s last name is Woodhouse, which is another name for a stable. Rosemary’s husband is named Guy because in the ultimate scheme of things, he’s no one of importance, just a guy. Break up the lead character’s name and you have something that sounds like Red Mary, the mother that will birth the Antichrist. She even wears blue in the third act of the film, recalling traditional depictions of the Virgin Mary.\n\nThe final scene is a twisted version of the Nativity, with guests from Greece and Japan recalling the Wise Men at the manger scene.\n\nI feel like a lot of people miss the dark comedy in this scene. Yes, Rosemary seeing the ugly Devil baby (which we don’t see) is horrifying, and Guy’s completely pathetic defense of his actions is despicable, but there’s some brilliant comedic irony too. Roman is going on about how Satan will bring power to the weak and downtrodden, yet they’re having their “nativity” in an expensive New York City apartment! Jesus, who are they mocking as haughty, was born in a lowly stable, and their god is being born in a rich high-rise. The final shot doesn’t reveal what Rosemary will ultimately do, but I always took it to mean that Rosemary still sees the humanity in her baby and decides to raise him as human.\n\nThere would be more Distant Devil films in years to come like 1970’s Taste the Blood of Dracula, which features a very dark first act where 3 hedonists sell their souls to The Devil at the request of a Devil worshipper (Ralph Bates) who wants to resurrect Dracula. Sadly, the rest of the film isn’t all that interesting, but the first act is incredibly atmospheric and dark. It hits all of the checkpoints of the Distant Devil films, but came just a bit late. After Rosemary’s Baby, a new wave of realistic, modern Devil films hit theatres, and it’s those films that I’ll be talking about in the next part."
