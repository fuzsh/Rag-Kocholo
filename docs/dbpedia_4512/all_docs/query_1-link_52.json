        "text": "A “Murder, She Wrote” movie is in the works at Universal Pictures, with “Dumb Money” writers Lauren Schuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo and producer Amy Pascal attached, Variety has confirmed.\n\nBlum and Angelo joined the project prior to the writers strike, and will not resume their work on the screenplay until the Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers have reached a deal. The “Murder, She Wrote” film is among the writers’ next projects, Blum and Angelo’s representatives shared with Variety.\n\nThe original “Murder, She Wrote” series starred Angela Lansbury as mystery writer and amateur detective Jessica Fletcher, who solves murders that occur in the fictional town of Cabot Cove, Maine. The crime drama series ran on CBS for 12 seasons from 1984 to 1996. Lansbury scored an Emmy nomination for every season, but never won the award.\n\n“Murder, She Wrote” was created by Peter S. Fischer, Richard Levinson and William Link. Universal Television produced the long-running series.\n\nBlum and Angelo co-wrote the screenplay for the biographical dramedy “Dumb Money,” starring Paul Dano, Seth Rogen, Pete Davidson, Sebastian Stan, Shailene Woodley, America Ferrera, Nick Offerman, Anthony Ramos, Dane DeHaan and Vincent D’Onofrio.\n\nBased on Ben Mezrich’s 2021 book “The Antisocial Network,” “Dumb Money” follows the true story of a group of investors involved in the GameStop short squeeze. The film, directed by Craig Gillespie, will be released in limited theaters Sept. 15.\n\nPascal is the former co-chief of Sony Pictures who moved her Pascal Pictures banner to Universal in 2019. Her production credits include the “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse” film series, Greta Gerwig’s “Little Women” and “Molly’s Game.”\n\nBlum and Angelo are repped by CAA. Universal did not immediately respond to Variety’s request for comment.\n\nJeff Sneider at Above the Line was the first to report the “Murder, She Wrote” movie news."
