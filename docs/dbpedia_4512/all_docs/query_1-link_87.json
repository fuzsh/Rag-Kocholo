        "text": "Say what you will about actor/musician/ occasional model Vincent Gallo, we love his films and lamented deeply when he announced his, “retirement,” from acting (though that seems to be over now thanks to Francis Ford Coppola’s “Tetro”).\n\n“Buffalo ’66” is one of our favorite films of 1998 and “The Brown Bunny,” while not perfect is still a startlingly original work. We want more and more from him, and preferably original works that he writes and directs with the wicked humor of ’66’. Well, works like that may exist.\n\nPlaylist friend Alex Litel has been going on to us about digging around copyright sites for a few weeks now and excavating screenplays that have been registered. He’s dug up some interesting stuff.\n\n“Filings show that Vincent Gallo has a quartet of hitherto unknown, unproduced screenplays: 2008’s “Hello Sadness Goodbye Love,” (registered as “print materials,” so it possibly could be a book and not a screenplay), registered a week before his ostensible retirement; 2006’s “Star” and “Her,” registered on the same day in August of that year; and 2005’s “Frobia,” registered exactly three years to date before HSGL.”\n\nSo, are these projects that Gallo may one day take up? Is he waiting for funding? Has he just moved on? Who knows, the actor was conspicuously absent from all “Tetro” press, so while he may not have “retired” per se, it appears he’s still intent on keeping a very low profile. But hear us now: we would love Gallo to return to the director’s chair. Hopefully more info comes from all this if someone can actually track him down and get him to speak."
