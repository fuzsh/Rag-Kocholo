        "text": "17. EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES (1994)\n\nWritten and directed by Gus Van Sant, based on the novel by Tom Robbins. Starring Uma Thurman, Lorraine Bracco, Angie Dickinson, Noriyuki ‘Pat’ Morita, Keanu Reeves, John Hurt, Rain Phoenix, Roseanne, Ed Begley, Jr., Crispin Glover, Buck Henry, Carol Kane, Sean Young.\n\nIt’s hard to tell what Van Sant saw in Tom Robbins’s horribly dated novel that spoke to today’s sensibilities, let alone why he chose to turn it into a movie. Uma Thurman stars as Sissy Hankshaw, born with enormous thumbs that help her hitchhike across the country. She lands in New York and becomes a feminine hygiene model, and her agent (John Hurt) sends her to his ranch run entirely by women. The cowgirls drug the endangered whooping cranes and stage a standoff against the federal government in a pseudo-feminist uprising based entirely in attitudes from the 1960s. A talented ensemble is wasted in this hodgepodge of hippie talking points, which was recut after a disastrous screening at the 1993 Toronto Film Festival.\n\n16. THE SEA OF TREES (2016)\n\nDirected by Gus Van Sant. Written by Chris Sparling. Starring Matthew McConaughey, Ken Watanabe, Naomi Watts, Katie Aselton, Jordan Gavaris.\n\nNotoriously booed at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, “The Sea of Trees” quickly disappeared from theaters when it was released a full year later. Matthew McConaughey stars as a depressed American who buys a one-way ticket to Japan, where he plans to kill himself at Aokigahara, a forest at the base of Mount Fuji. He meets another suicidal man (Ken Watanabe), and together they try to find their way out of the woods. While the scenes between these two are dull, the flashbacks to McConaughey’s life with his alcoholic, cancer-ridden wife (Naomi Watts) are overwrought and sentimental, and the third act twist is laughably absurd. Try as he might, Van Sant and the cast can’t save Chris Sparling’s woefully misguided screenplay.\n\n15. RESTLESS (2011)\n\nDirected by Gus Van Sant. Written by Jason Lew. Starring Henry Hopper, Mia Wasikowska, Ryo Kase, Schuyler Fisk, Jane Adams, Chin Han, Lusia Strus.\n\nYou wouldn’t have guessed a saccharine, sentimental love story could be centered around the subject of death, but Van Sant finds a way with “Restless.” Henry Hopper (son of Dennis Hopper) stars as a teenager who likes to attend funerals for people he doesn’t know, scratching an itch started by the sudden death of his parents in a car crash that left him in a coma. He falls in love with a terminally ill girl (Mia Wasikowska) with months to live, and slowly starts to enjoy life again. Jason Lew’s screenplay also throws in the ghost of a WWII Kamikaze pilot (Ryo Kase) who travels around with Hopper. Filled with forced whimsy and moody music choices, the film still manages to tug at our heartstrings in spite of its shortcomings.\n\n14. DON’T WORRY, HE WON’T GET FAR ON FOOT (2018)\n\nDirected by Gus Van Sant. Screenplay by Gus Van Sant, story by John Callahan, Van Sant, Jack Gibson and William Andrew Eatman, based on the book by Callahan. Starring Joaquin Phoenix, Jonah Hill, Rooney Mara, Jack Black, Mark Webber, Udo Kier, Carrie Brownstein.\n\nAs a biographical drama, “Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot” avoids many pitfalls of the genre thanks to Joaquin Phoenix’s commanding performance as cartoonist John Callahan, whose life was forever altered by a car crash that left him a quadriplegic at 21. Most of the film focuses on his struggles to overcome alcoholism through a 12-step program, pushing his artistic blossoming into a macabre animator to the background. That’s a shame, because what could’ve been an “American Splendor”-esque examination of a prickly comic book artist becomes an inspirational addiction drama. Jonah Hill is a standout as Callahan’s AA sponsor, while Rooney Mara makes the most of the woefully underwritten role of his girlfriend.\n\n13. PROMISED LAND (2012)\n\nDirected by Gus Van Sant. Screenplay by John Krasinski and Matt Damon, story by Dave Eggers. Starring Matt Damon, John Krasinski, Frances McDormand, Rosemarie DeWitt, Scoot McNairy, Titus Welliver, Hal Holbrook.\n\n“Promised Land” is filled with good intentions overshadowed by maudlin attempts at Capra-esque Americana. Matt Damon stars as a natural gas company salesman who travels with his partner (Frances McDormand) to a small rural town to convince the locals to give up their land for fracking. An environmental advocate (John Krasinski) tries to get him to change his mind, as does an elderly schoolteacher (Hal Holbrook) and a love interest (Rosemary DeWitt). There’s a third act twist in Damon and Krasinski’s screenplay that’s either brilliant or silly depending on how you look at it. One has to think Van Sant’s love of nature drew him to this story, and he captures the landscape in beautiful, breathtaking frames.\n\n12. FINDING FORRESTER (2000)\n\nDirected by Gus Van Sant. Written by Mike Rich. Starring Sean Connery, Rob Brown, F. Murray Abraham, Anna Paquin, Busta Rhymes.\n\nAlthough he retired after the critically-panned “The League of Extraordinary Gentleman” (2003), Sean Connery gave one last great performance in Van Sant’s heartwarming drama, a sort of “Good Will Hunting” with writers instead of mathematicians. He plays William Forrester, a reclusive author who becomes a mentor to a young prodigy (Rob Brown) in his Bronx neighborhood. As Brown struggles at his Manhattan university to impress a bitter teacher (F. Murray Abraham), the once-promising novelist comes increasingly out of his shell to help his new friend. Though the plot is nothing new, Connery and Brown make an interesting combination, and the interplay between the two rings true.\n\n11. PSYCHO (1998)\n\nDirected by Gus Van Sant. Screenplay by Joseph Stefano, based on the novel by Robert Bloch. Starring Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche, Julianne Moore, Viggo Mortensen, William H. Macy, Robert Forster, Philip Baker Hall.\n\nOne of the more perplexing experiments in cinema history, this 1998 remake of “Psycho” seeks to recreate Alfred Hitchcock’s 1960 original shot-for-shot, with color and surreal images thrown in to slightly differentiate it. The idea, Van Sant later conceded, was to prove that you can’t actually replicate a film beat-for-beat and recapture the same magic, which makes you wonder why a talented director would even waste his time with it (especially immediately after snagging an Oscar bid for “Good Will Hunting”). Yet as an exercise in film criticism through filmmaking, it’s fascinating to watch, especially when comparing and contrasting minor differences that will stand out to devoted cinephiles. For curious viewers only, although this one does have its champions.\n\n10. PARANOID PARK (2007)\n\nWritten and directed by Gus Van Sant, based on the novel by Blake Nelson. Starring Gabe Nevins, Taylor Momsen, Jake Miller, Daniel Liu, Lauren McKinney, Scott Patrick Green, John Burrowes.\n\nPerhaps best described as the unofficial fourth entry in Van Sant’s trilogy of death (“Gerry,” “Elephant,” “Last Days”), “Paranoid Park” delves deep into the psyche of teenage skateboarder Alex (Gabe Nevins), whose life unravels after he’s involved in the accidental death of a security guard. As the police investigation points to him, Alex keeps his secret to himself while trying to navigate the perils of school, his girlfriend and his family. Cast with non-professional actors culled from a MySpace open casting call, the film has a natural feel for the aches and pains of alienated youth. In adapting Blake Nelson’s novel, Van Sant employs an elliptical, non-linear format that’s haunting and mesmerizing.\n\n9. GERRY (2002)\n\nDirected by Gus Van Sant. Written by Casey Affleck, Matt Damon, Gus Van Sant. Starring Matt Damon, Casey Affleck.\n\nHaving achieved financial and Oscar success with “Good Will Hunting,” Van Sant turned as far away from commercial filmmaking as he possibly could with “Gerry,” the first in his trilogy of death (followed by “Elephant” and “Last Days”). Like those titles, this is a deliberately slow, perversely non-narrative film that nevertheless manages to cast a spell over us. Matt Damon and Casey Affleck (who also co-wrote the script with the director) star as two men named Gerry who take a hike in the desert and quickly get lost. As they wander for days without food or water, they quickly realize they will die. And that’s it. Though maddening to some, others will give in to its presentation of man’s hubristic desire to conquer nature and fatally failing.\n\n8. MALA NOCHE (1985)\n\nWritten and directed by Gus Van Sant, based on the novel by Walt Curtis. Starring Tim Streeter, Doug Cooeyate, Ray Monge, Nyla McCarthy, Don Chambers, Walt Curtis.\n\nThough his official directorial debut was the never-released “Alice in Hollywood,” Van Sant kicked off his career with this micro-budget, black-and-white exploration of amour fou (i.e. obsessive love). Based on the semi-autobiographical novel by Walt Curtis, “Mala Noche” centers on a gay store clerk (Tim Streeter) who becomes enamored with a younger Mexican boy (Doug Cooeyete), although he sleeps with the guy’s friend (Ray Monge) when his beloved rejects his advances. Shot on the gritty streets of the director’s home base of Portland, Oregon, the film was a major preamble to the burgeoning New Queer Cinema, and helped establish Van Sant as an indie maverick to watch.\n\n7. LAST DAYS (2005)\n\nWritten and directed by Gus Van Sant. Starring Michael Pitt, Lukas Haas, Asia Argento, Scott Patrick Green, Nicole Vicius, Ricky Jay, Harmony Korine, Thadeus A. Thomas.\n\nThe final chapter in Van Sant’s “Death Trilogy” (preceded by “Gerry” and “Elephant”), “Last Days” takes a cold, hard look at the decline of a Kurt Cobain-esque rock musician named Blake, brilliantly played by Michael Pitt. The film follows the grunge singer as he stumbles around his vast Seattle mansion in a drug-induced stupor, pushing away his friends and hanger-ons. Various strangers pop in and out — including Ricky Jay as a detective, filmmaker Harmony Korine and a real life Yellow Pages salesman (Thadeus A. Thomas) — none of them able to break through to him. Bit by bit, Van Sant strips away the mythos surrounding Cobain’s untimely demise, presenting as sad a portrait of addiction as has ever been seen.\n\n6. TO DIE FOR (1995)\n\nDirected by Gus Van Sant. Screenplay by Buck Henry, based on the novel by Joyce Maynard. Starring Nicole Kidman, Matt Dillon, Joaquin Phoenix, Casey Affleck, Illeana Douglas, Alison Folland, Dan Hedaya, Maria Tucci, Wayne Knight, Kurtwood Smith, Holland Taylor.\n\nAfter stumbling with the woefully misguided “Even Cowgirls Get the Blues,” Van Sant bounced back in a big way with this deliciously dark media satire, his first major studio effort. Nicole Kidman gives one of her best performances as Suzanne Stone, a small-town weather girl whose dreams of becoming a big-time broadcaster are hindered by her marriage to lovable goofball Larry (Matt Dillon). So she enlists three high schoolers (Joaquin Phoenix, Casey Affleck and Alison Folland) to help her kill her husband. Van Sant does an expert job balancing the delicate tone of Buck Henry’s pitch-black screenplay, while Kidman (who won a Golden Globe for the role) is spot-on as the shark-eyed, self-centered newswoman.\n\n5. ELEPHANT (2003)\n\nWritten and directed by Gus Van Sant. Starring Alex Frost, Eric Deulen, John Robinson, Timothy Bottoms, Matt Malloy, Elias McConnell, Nathan Tyson, Kristen Hicks, Brittany Mountain, Jordan Taylor, Nicole George, Bennie Dixon, Alicia Miles.\n\nVan Sant took home the Palme d’Or and Best Director prize at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival for this haunting, highly-divisive Columbine recreation, the middle entry in his “Death Trilogy” (preceded by “Gerry” and succeeded by “Last Days”). “Elephant” follows a group of nameless teenagers in the lead-up to a high school gun massacre, offering no easy explanations or solutions. Filmed in long tracking shots by the late cinematographer Harris Savides and scored with Beethoven sonatas, it casts a haunting spell interrupted by disturbing bursts of violence. In draining the carnage of any sensationalism, Van Sant creates a chilling presentation of senseless bloodshed that’s more frightening than any horror movie.\n\n4. MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO (1991)\n\nWritten and directed by Gus Van Sant. Starring River Phoenix, Keanu Reeves, James Russo, William Richert, Udo Kier, Rodney Harvey, Michael Parker, Jessie Thomas, Grace Zabriskie, Flea, Tom Troupe.\n\nAfter breaking through with the gritty, naturalistic “Drugstore Cowboy,” Van Sant showed off his artsy side with this deeply personal road movie. River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves star as young street hustlers: Phoenix a sensitive, impoverished narcoleptic, Reeves the ephemeral son of Portland’s mayor. Together they travel across the globe, encountering johns, crooks and drug addicts. All the while Phoenix pines away for Reeves, who falls in love with a beautiful girl in Italy. Van Sant throws everything at the wall, including surreal imagery, dreamlike sex scenes and even a giant passage lifted from Shakespeare’s “Henry IV.” But through it all, the heartbreaking performances by the two young leads keeps the whole thing grounded in reality.\n\n3. DRUGSTORE COWBOY (1989)\n\nDirected by Gus Van Sant. Screenplay by Gus Van Sant and Daniel Yost, based on the novel by James Fogle. Starring Matt Dillon, Kelly Lynch, James Remar, James LeGros, Heather Graham, Max Perlich, James Remar, Grace Zabriskie, William S. Burroughs.\n\nWith his second feature, Van Sant firmly established himself as a singular voice in the burgeoning independent cinema movement, launching a successful movie career. Adapted from James Fogle’s autobiographical book (then unpublished), “Drugstore Cowboy” centers on a group of junkies robbing pharmacies across the Pacific Northwest. There’s Bob (Matt Dillon), the leader; Dianne (Kelly Lynch), his wife; Rick (James Le Gros), his best friend; and Nadine (Heather Graham), Rick’s teenage girlfriend. As tragedy slowly spoils their good time, Bob tries his best to go straight. Shot on location in Portland, Oregon, the film has a natural feel for the gritty, lonely lives of drifters and outcasts that often finds its way into the director’s best work.\n\n2. GOOD WILL HUNTING (1997)\n\nDirected by Gus Van Sant. Written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Starring Robin Williams, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Stellan Skarsgard, Minnie Driver, Casey Affleck, Cole Hauser.\n\nVan Sant achieved his greatest financial success by pulling at our heartstrings with this inspirational drama. “Good Will Hunting” centers on a South Boston janitor (Matt Damon) working at MIT, who’s secretly a math genius. Ut’s up to a university psychologist (Robin Williams) to uncover the deep wounds in Will’s past so he can live a better life. There’s a wealth of wonderful supporting characters here, including Minnie Driver as Will’s girlfriend, Ben Affleck as his best friend and Stellan Skarsgard as a professor who recognizes his potential. The film earned nine Oscar nominations including Best Picture and Best Director for Van Sant, winning for Damon and Affleck in Best Original Screenplay and Williams in Best Supporting Actor.\n\n1. MILK (2008)\n\nDirected by Gus Van Sant. Written by Dustin Lance Black. Starring Sean Penn, Emile Hirsch, Josh Brolin, Diego Luna, James Franco, Alison Pill, Victor Garber, Denis O’Hare, Joseph Cross.\n\nVan Sant’s passion for Harvey Milk’s life story is evident in every frame of this biographical drama, perhaps the greatest blending of his mainstream and artistic sensibilities. Sean Penn gives the performance of a lifetime as the pioneering LGBTQ rights activist, who made history as California’s first openly gay elected official before his life was cut tragically short by fellow politician Dan Brown (Josh Brolin). What could’ve been a fairly paint-by-numbers endeavor is elevated by Van Sant’s nuanced, inventive filmmaking, which packs an emotional wallop at the end. “Milk” reaped eight Oscar nominations including Best Picture and Best Director, winning Best Actor for Penn and Best Original Screenplay for Dustin Lance Black."
