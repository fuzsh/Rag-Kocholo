        "text": "I HAVE a friend who appears to be quite sane in every respect but one: towards the end of January he starts compiling his list of the 10 best movies of the year, which isn't really due, technically, for another 11 months. The list is written on a piece of three‐by‐five‐inch notepaper that is then folded so that, when it slips into his wallet, it's about the size of a very thick, conventional stamp.\n\nBy May, the list looks a little frayed. By August, the titles of the 50‐or‐so contenders still in the running, plus the crossed‐out titles of those movies be yond all hope, have used up most of the room on both sides of the paper. It”s at this point that my friend starts to add the names of many films still unseen, just to give them a franchise on space. By December, the paper has been worked into the condition of ancient lace, but even before the lights come up at the end of the first screening of the last film to open in the calendar year, my friend has his list completed, ready, if not for publication, then for private display and comparison.\n\nIt's obviously a labor of love, and of some madness, and it has, I think, very little to do with his real apprecia tion for the movies themselves. Rather it is a kind of ritual that not only re calls but extends the atmosphere of competition in which commercial mov ies are made and sold, and that acknow ledges that, even if movies are not com parable, then, opinions, prejudices and ideas are.\n\nThis has not been an especially bril liant year for movies and my list of 10 best includes only five that I think might stand the competition in a tougher year—all of these from abroad. Oddly enough, while there have been no truly stunning American films, there were many that were provocative, lively, original (at least in concept) or showed concern for movie genres for which I have an affection, but which are, in themselves, limiting. This year, as last, I've flowed myself a follow‐up list of 10, which still meant that I couldn't include “Where's Poppa?” “Trash,” “Ice,” “Goin’ Down the Road,” “On a Clear Day You Can See Forever,” “The Forbin Project,” “A History of the Blue Movie,” “Hi, Mom!” and some others that appealed to me for reasons that often had nothing to do with their esthetic and historical values:\n\nI've drawn my list exclusively from those films that have opened—or will have opened—commercial engagements in New York between Jan. 1 and the end of this year. Thus, several films that I saw and liked at the New York Film Festival are not eligible (most notably, Claude Chabrol's “Le Bouch er”), nor are some classics like Tod Browning's “Freaks” and Robert Bres son's “Diary of a Country Priest,” which I saw for the first time this year.\n\nMy choices, listed in alphabetical order, are:\n\nThe Ballad of Cable Hogue, directed by Sam Peckinpah; written by John Crawford and Edmund Penney; pro duced by Mr. Peckinpah; executive pro\n\n“THE WILD CHILD”—Jean Pierre Cargol, a gypsy boy, acted the title role in Francois Truffaut's film with skill. ducer, Phil Feldman: released by War ner Brothers. If “The Wild Bunch” was a blood‐ballet, “The Ballad of Cable Hogue” is a kind of sweat‐mazurka, an exuberant Western folk tale about a man who made a bargain with God, and kept it with honor and humor. Jason Robards is splendid in the title role; Stella Stevens is lovely as a hooker with‐heart, and Strother Martin and L. Q. Jones are reassuring as two of Mr. Peckinpah's scroungiest villains. For some strange reason, this fine film wasn't as much released by Warner Brothers as it was dismissed by them, in a multiple‐theater opening last May. It should be brought back.\n\nCatch‐22, directed by Mike Nichols; screenplay by Buck Henry, based on the novel by Joseph Heller; produced by John Calley; released by Paramount Pictures. Mr. Nichols and Mr. Henry packed about as much of the Heller novel as they could into 129 minutes, but the movie still is disconcertingly fragmentary, and seems to have baffled those who did not read the book almost as much as it did those who read the book but remembered it as being funnier than it ever was. It comes close to being an epic human comedy about war, in which panic is equated with love. Alan Arkin is superb as Yossarian.\n\nFellini Satyricon, directed by Fede rico Fellini; screenplay by Mr. Fellini and Bernardo Zapponi, based on the 1st Century, A.D., novel by Petronius; pro duced by Alberto Grimaldi; released by United Artists. Mr. Fellini, ironically, is becoming something of an embarrass ment to many critics at just that point in his career when he has become most personal and original and adventurous. In this extravagant hallucination, given shape by the same bourgeous, Italian Roman Catholic sensibility that made “White Sheik,” “Nights of Cabiria” and “8½,” Mr. Fellini creates an unforget table movie mosaic of a world outside of time.\n\nLittle Big Man, directed by Arthur Penn; screenplay by Calder Willingham, based on the novel by Thomas Berger; produced by Stuart Millar; a Cinema Center Films presentation, released by National General Pictures. This is some thing of a sentimental selection since “Little Big Man” is more moving for what it wants to accomplish than for what it actually does. Mr. Penn's film is a tough testament to the contrariness of the American experience as survived by 120‐year‐old Jack Crabb (Dustin Hoffman), who lived through every great moment of the winning of the West. The movie attempts to take its horrors seriously by making them comic, and winds up in some confusion. But this sort of confusion is more im portant than the achievements of lesser movies.\n\nLoving, directed by Irvin Kershner; screenplay by Don Devlin, based on a novel by M. Ryan; produced by Don Devlin; executive producer, Raymond Wagner; released by Columbia Pictures. This is the sort of film that seldom gets made without being turned into a tele vision sitcom, or into a patronizing put down of suburban characters who have dreams of urban glory. Mr. Kershner's movie is a funny, straight, compassion ate, domestic comedy, beautifully acted by Eva Marie Saint and George Segal, who may deserve an award just for having landed so many roles this year (“The Owl and The Pussycat,” “Where's Poppa”).\n\nM*A*S*H, directed by Robert Alt man; screenplay by Ring Lardner, Jr., based on the novel by Richard Hooker; produced by Ingo Preminger; released by 20th Century‐Fox. This is the one unequivocably funny film of the year, a fine, irreverent service comedy whose irreverence is necessarily limited by the fact that it is, after all, a service comedy. The screenplay is excellent and Robert Altman's comic sense served it well, obtaining marvelous performances from Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould and Sally Kellerman, among others, and filling almost every inch of the screen and soundtrack with crazy detail.\n\nMy Night at Maud's (Ma Nuit Chez Maud), directed by Eric Rohmer; screen play by Mr. Rohmer; produced by Bar bet Schroeder and Pierre Cottrell; re leased by Contemporary Films. Eric Rohmer, the former French film critic, makes movies about people (in this case, a 30‐year‐old, provincial bachelor and a lovely, wise, intelligent femme fatale) who talk well and mean what they say about Catholicism, Pascal, marriage, fidelity and all sorts of other non‐cinematic subjects. The movie is elegant and eloquent and cinematic.\n\nThe Passion of Anna, directed by Ingmar Bergman; screenplay by Mr. Bergman; produced by A. B. Svensk Filmindustri; released by United Artists. Another extraordinary visit to the Berg man world (an island off Sweden) ringed by the threat of violence, in habited by two couples who are in various stages of combat with each other and God. It is a beautiful (color photography by Sven Nykvist), per fectly performed (by Max Von Sydow, Liv Ullmann and Bibi Andersson) movie by one of the most haunted (and haunt ing) directors at work today.\n\nTristana, directed by Luis Buñuel; screenplay by Mr. Buñuel and Julio Ale jandro, based on the novel by Benito Perez Galdos; produced by Epoca Films Talia Film (Madrid), Selenia Cinema tographia (Rome) and Les Films Corona (Paris); released by Maren Films. This tale of a pretty ward (Catherine De neuve) who is seduced by her guardian (Fernando Rey), loses a leg, marries the old man, and lives to inherit his wealth (if not his compassion), is a quintessen tial Buñuel comedy, which means it's implacably moral, often grotesque and full of Spanish soul. A great film.\n\nThe Wild Child, directed by Francois Truffaut; screenplay by Mr. Truffaut and Jean Gruault, based on “Rapports et Memoires sur Le Sauvage De L'Avey ron,” by Jean Itard; produced by Marcel Berbet for Les Films Carosse and Les Artistes Associes; released by United Artists. As if to answer those critics who felt he was letting his heart rule his head with films like “Stolen Kisses” and “The Mississippi Mermaid,” Fran cois Truffaut turned this story of the education of “wild boy” into an al most painfully austere drama of trust and love and decency, photographed in lovely, old‐fashioned, black‐and‐white, and acted with immense skill by the director and a young gypsy boy named Jean‐Pierre Cargol.\n\nMy list of movies that, for one reason or another; didn't, qualify above, is as follows, though in no particular order of preference:\n\nFranklin J. Schaffner's “Patton,” an unembarrassed, pro‐Patton (and thus, pro‐war) movie, majestically photo graphed and acted by George C. Scott; “Two or Three Things I Know About Her,” Jean Luc Godard's 1966 es say on Paris, prostitution and lan guage, a kind of sane preview of the mad revolutionary films that were to come three years later; “Five Easy Pieces,” Bob Rafel son's rather conventional but tasteful “road” picture, made remarkable by Jack Nicholson's graceful performance; “Two Mules for Sister Sara,” Don Sie gel's tough and funny Western, with Clint Eastwood and Shirley MacLaine as a couple of perfectly mated outcasts, a gun‐slinger and a whore masquerad ing as a shy nun; Olaude Chabrol's “This Man Must Die” is a little too brilliantly conceptualized to have a movie life of its own, but still very good; “Darling Lili,” Blake Edwards's valentine to his wife and star, Julie Andrews, may al most have capsized Paramount, but its foolish, quite perverse romanticism is almost worth it.\n\nAlso, Billy Wilder's “The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes,” even though Mr. Wilder and Sir Arthur Conan‐Doyle fight the movie to a surprisingly un surprising, genteel draw; “The Rise of Louis XIV,” Roberto Rossellini's tele vision film details more of the confu sion of shabbiness and splendor, of perfume and stink, and of wit and ruth lessness, in the Sun King's court than any other historical film ever made; “The Confession,” Costa‐Gavras's anti Stalinist melodrama, vastly more enter taining and more humane than “Z”; “Love Story,” Arthur Hiller's film ver sion of Erich Segal's dreadful novel is, at its commercial heart, kitsch, but it's kitsch with style."
