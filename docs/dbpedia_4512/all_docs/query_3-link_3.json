        "text": "MICHIGAN—With so many wonderful locales to explore across Michigan, we recently asked ‘Gander readers where they would choose to go if they could spend an all-expense-paid summer weekend in any Michigan city.\n\nWithout a doubt, the top choice among readers was Mackinac Island.\n\nThat shouldn’t come as a surprise, as the island has been voted the best summer travel destination in the US more than once.\n\nThere’s a good chance many of us are planning a trip out to the island sometime soon. So, with that in mind, we’ve put together this article to serve as your ultimate guide to Mackinac Island. Even if a trip isn’t in the cards for you, I hope there’s enough packed in here to make you feel like you visited.\n\nFrom its rich history to the best locations to explore, join us on a virtual trip around Mackinac Island.\n\nThe story of Mackinac Island\n\nFirst, a bit of history.\n\nLong before European settlers arrived in what is now Michigan, Indigenous tribes called the Great Lakes region home. Northern Michigan was home to several Anishinaabe tribes, also known as the Three Fires Council.\n\nThe council comprised three tribes: The Ojibwe, the Odawa, and the Potawatomi.\n\nThere’s a particular island in Michigan that holds incredible importance to the Three Fires: Michilimackinac, a name that means Big Turtle to the Odawa. It was the preferred meeting place for the Three Fires. Along with convening with one another, the Three Fires also met with other Anishinaabe nations there.\n\nIf you haven’t guessed by now, this place is also known as Mackinac Island. To the Odawa, Michilimackinac is considered the birthplace and center of the world. All across the island there are places of great significance to the tribes of the Anishinaabe—like Arch Rock (seen in the photo above), which is considered a bridge from the Earth to the afterlife.\n\nIn the early 1600s, French explorers began settling in the Great Lakes region as part of their territory known as New France. In 1634, explorer Jean Nicolet was crossing the Straits of Mackinac when he spotted Mackinac Island, but it wasn’t until 1670 that the first Jesuit Mission was established on the island. This mission was the central location of what would become a flourishing fur trade in the region.\n\nAt this point, many of the area’s original Indigenous inhabitants began to be pushed out. In the early 1700s, most local Indigenous people moved south.\n\nBy 1720, the fur trade had become a primary economic driver for New France. To protect their trade, the French established an outpost across the straits—Fort Michilimackinac—on the mainland of the Lower Peninsula in what is now Mackinaw City.\n\nThe next decades would mark several shifts in control of the area.\n\nIn the 1760s, the French relinquished control of the area to the British following the French & Indian War. But this control wouldn’t last long. During the War of 1812, the British relocated Fort Michilimackinac to Mackinac Island and renamed it Fort Mackinac. At this location, they repelled an attack by American troops in the Battle of Mackinac.\n\nThis victory was short-lived, as American forces eventually defeated the British and gained control of the area after the war.\n\nIt was at this point that Mackinac Island began its transformation into what we know today.\n\nAs its military significance began to diminish, the locals of the island began to shift their attention to tourism. In 1875, US Congress designated part of Mackinac Island as a national park (the second one in the nation’s history, after Yellowstone National Park). Mackinac National Park existed for twenty years, with the soldiers at Fort Mackinac serving as park rangers. In 1895, When the US military decided that it no longer needed to man Fort Mackinac, Michigan’s state government took over, and created Mackinac Island State Park. It was the first public space in the country designated as a “state park.”\n\nAs the island transitioned into the 20th century, entrepreneurs built hotels and other lodging to facilitate the influx of tourists. It also became known for one thing: Fudge.\n\nThe Murdicks are the most famous fudge family. They opened the first fudge shop on the island in 1875. By the 1920s, the island’s downtown had transformed into a fudge destination, with many businesses putting on shows through big windows so island visitors could witness the entire fudge-creating process.\n\nRead more: The history of Mackinac Island fudge\n\nNow in the modern age, visiting Mackinac Island is like being transported to another era.
