        "text": "The Devil and Daniel Mouse is a 1978 Canadian animated Halloween television special based on the story The Devil and Daniel Webster by Steven Vincent Benét. It is produced by Nelvana.\n\nPlot[]\n\nThe story is about two mouse musicians, Daniel and Jan. When they are fired from their latest gig (their music is deemed too old-fashioned and not with the times), Daniel goes to pawn his guitar in order to buy groceries. Jan wanders off on her own and encounters a shifty reptilian character in a white suit who introduces himself as \"B.L. Zebub\", a record producer.\n\nHe and his weasel assistant, Weez Weezel, offer her fame and fortune in exchange for signing a contract in her own blood. Jan does not read the fine print and trusts B.L., signing herself over to his record production company. Little does she suspect that B.L. is none other than the devil himself, and at midnight at the height of her fame he will return to collect her soul. To assist her, Weez conjures three band members from thin air, Rabbit Delight, Boom Boom Beaver, and Pray Mantis.\n\nAs the lead singer of Funky Jan and the Animal Kingdom, Jan soon became the most popular rock star on the planet, while the oblivious Daniel is left out in the cold. But when B.L. comes for her soul and she realizes what she has done, a distraught Jan goes to Daniel for help. A trial is held in the woods that night over Jan's soul, with Weez as the judge and Daniel acting as Jan's attorney. As an additional stipend, the Devil states that should Daniel lose the trial, his soul, as well as Jan's, will be taken as payment. At first, the trial seems hopeless, considering Daniel has no education as a lawyer and cannot present even the beginnings of a reasonable argument to release Jan.\n\nHaving nothing else to offer, Daniel begins to sing a heartfelt song. Jan joins in, as do her three heretofore unhelpful band members. The other animals watching the trial joining the tune and so do the jury of three lost souls. An enraged devil attempts to summon forth demons to stop the heroes and the song, but the spirits he conjures also fall prey to the sway of Daniel's music.\n\nA frustrated devil finally leaves, returning to Hell and taking Weez and all of his other minions with him. The two mice embrace one another as the film ends.\n\nCast[]\n\nJim Henshaw as Daniel Mouse (speaking voice) and a beaver drummer\n\nAnnabel Kershaw as Jan Mouse (speaking voice)\n\nJohn Sebastian as Daniel Mouse (singing voice) and a rock show emcee\n\nValerie Carter (credited as Laurel Runn) as Jan Mouse (singing voice)\n\nChris Wiggins as B. L. Zebub/Satan/The Devil\n\nMartin Lavut as Weez Weezel, pawnbroker, and radio DJ\n\nDianne Lawrence as Vicky Viper and a journalist\n\nSoundtrack[]\n\nLook Where the Music Can Take You performed by John Sebastian & Valerie Carter (credited as Laurel Runn)\n\nI've Got a Song to Sing performed by Valerie Carter (credited as Laurel Runn)\n\nRoxy Marathon Concert Medley performed by Valerie Carter (credited as Laurel Runn)\n\nCan You Help Me Find My Song? performed by Valerie Carter (credited as Laurel Runn)\n\nLook Where the Music Can Take You performed by John Sebastian & Valerie Carter (credited as Laurel Runn)\n\nLook Where the Music Can Take You (Finale) performed by John Sebastian & Valerie Carter (credited as Laurel Runn)\n\nMerchandising[]\n\nNelvana story album[]\n\nA tie-in story LP record was released by Nelvana Records in 1978. Narrated by John Sebastian, the album features dialog lifted straight from the film's soundtrack as well as songs performed by Sebastian, Valerie Carter (credited as Laurel Runn) and the Reggie Knighton Band. As in the film, the dialogue is interspersed with several of the songs.\n\nFull-color storybook[]\n\nFirst published by Avon/Camelot in 1979, the storybook was written by screenwriter Ken Sobol and features music and lyrics for three John Sebastian penned songs (I've Got a Song, Can You Help Me Find My Song? and Look Where the Music Can Take You). Simplified for younger readers, many of the visual gags and a few scenes were omitted from the book.\n\nHome video[]\n\nThe Devil and Daniel Mouse was simultaneously issued as a stand-alone title on Betamax and VHS as well as featured on several compilations of Nelvana's TV specials.\n\nNelvanamation (Volume 1)[]\n\nThe first and more widely available compilation to feature the film was Nelvanamation (Volume 1). Also featured on this video are Romie-0 and Julie-8, Intergalactic Thanksgiving and A Cosmic Christmas.\n\nThe Devil and Daniel Mouse and Tales of Fantasy and Science Fiction[]\n\nHeadlining a collection similar to Nelvanamation, this CED Videodisc also includes Romie-0 and Julie-8, Easter Fever, Intergalactic Thanksgiving and A Cosmic Christmas.\n\nRock & Rule[]\n\nThe Devil and Daniel Mouse became the inspiration for Nelvana's first feature film, Rock & Rule. The film and How We Made the Devil and Daniel Mouse, a vintage \"making of\" documentary, were both included on the two-DVD versions of that film in a slightly edited form of 22 minutes from its original 25-minute running time."
