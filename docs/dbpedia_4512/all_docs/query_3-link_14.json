The Cuckoo Clock.\"\n\n- Harry Lime (Orson Welles),\"The Third Man\"\n\n\"I know what you're thinking, did he fire six shots or only five ? To tell you the truth in all this confusion I forgot myself. Now being that this is a .44 magnum; the most powerful handgun in the world and can take your head clean off, you have to ask yourself a question, do I feel lucky? Well do ya feel lucky, punk?\"\n\n- Callaghan (Clint Eastwood), \"Dirty Harry\"\n\n\"You wanna get Capone? Here's how you get him. He pulls a knife, you pull a gun. He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue. That's the Chicago way, and that's how you get Capone!\"\n\n- Malone (Sean Connery), \"The Untouchables\"\n\n\"We went seeking greatness in movies, and were most often disappointed. We waited for a movie like the one we wanted to make, and secretly wanted to live.\"\n\n- from Jean-Luc Godard's \"Masculine-Feminine\"\n\n# SECTIONS\n\n~ Bad Guys ~ Trainspotting ~ War Films (moved to new page) ~ As Good As It Gets ~ Historical Films (moved to new page) ~ Barcelona ~ Comedies ~ Canadian Bacon ~ Dramas ~ Wonder Boys ~ Profound Quotes ~ The Commitments ~ Romance ~ Mallrats ~ Misc ~ Beautiful Girls ~ James Bond ~ Teen Films\n\n# WHY DO THE BAD GUYS GET THE BEST LINES?\n\n\"We do not tolerate failure, Number 3.\"\n\n- Ernst Blofeld, \"From Russia with Love\"\n\n\"Twelve seconds. One day we must invent a faster working venom.\"\n\n- Ernst Blofeld, \"From Russia with Love\"\n\n\"It is so obviously a trap and my reading of the British mentality is that they always treat a trap as a challenge.\"\n\n- Number 5, \"From Russia with Love\"\n\n\"Choose your next witticism carefully, Mr. Bond.

And since I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.\"\n\n- Holly McClane & Hans Gruber, \"Die Hard\"\n\n\"Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight? I always ask that of my prey. I just like the way it sounds...\"\n\n- The Joker, \"Batman\"\n\n\"Pop quiz, hotshot. There's a bomb on a bus. Once the bus goes 50 miles an hour, the bomb is armed.

Fuck me. I mean, say what you like about the tenets of National Socialism, Dude, at least it's an ethos.\"\n\n- Walter Sobchak, \"The Big Lebowski\"\n\n\"Are these the Nazis, Walter?\"\n\n\"No, Donny, these men are nihilists.

It was a tie!\"\n\n\"The chip. The British contribution to world cuisine.\"\n\n- Otto, A Fish Called Wanda\n\n\"Aristotle is not Belgian, the central message of Buddism is not 'Every man for himself', and the London Underground is not a political movement. Those are all mistakes, Otto. I looked them up.\"\n\n- A Fish Called Wanda\n\n\"What are the chances that me and you would have a chance together?\"\n\n\"Not good.\"\n\n\"What, like 10 to 1, 100 to 1?\"\n\n\"More like a million to 1.\"\n\n\"So, you're saying there's a chance?

I'm madly in love with you and it's not because of your brains or your personality.\"\n\n- Olive and Grandpa, \"Little Miss Sunshine\"\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you when I regain consciousness.\"\n\n- Sheryl and Richard, after a close call with the law, \"Little Miss Sunshine\"\n\n\"What is true love?\"\n\n\"True love is your soul's recognition of its counterpoint in another.\"\n\n\"Well, it's a little cheesy but I like it.\"\n\n- Claire and John, \"Wedding Crashers\"\n\n# DRAMA\n\n\"The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist...\"\n\n- The Usual Suspects\n\n\"I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class. Especially since I rule.\"\n\n- Randal, \"Clerks\"\n\n\"This ain't no game. Real guns. Real bullets. It's dangerous.\"\n\n\"Dangerous is my middle name.\"\n\n\"Mine is \"Cornelius\", and if you tell anyone, I'll kill you.\"\n\n- Joe Hallenback (Bruce Willis), \"The Last Boy Scout\"\n\n\"Ask me what I want to change about this moment.\"\n\n\"I dunno.

You look in my eyes, Natalie, I'm the only mirror you're ever gonna need.\"\n\n- Nathalie and Bernie, surveying the damage, \"The Cooler\"\n\n\"Beauty in life may come from makeup, or what have you, but in death, you have to fall back on character.\"\n\n- Martha, \"A Woman's Tale\"\n\n\"I have this condition.\"\n\n- Leonard Shelby, \"Memento\"\n\n\"What's the last thing that you do remember?\"\n\n\"My wife...\"\n\n\"That's sweet.\"\n\n\"...dying.\"\n\n- Natalie & Leonard, \"Memento\"\n\n\"We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are.\"\n\n- Leonard Shelby, \"Memento\"\n\n\"You shouldn't knock misdemeanors.\"\n\n\"Oh, but it's small stuff. It gets so boring.\"\n\n\"It's all about small stuff. You know, small lies, small mistakes. People give themselves away, same in misdemeanors as they do on murder cases. It's just human nature. Aren't you gonna write that down?\"\n\n- Detectives Dormer & Burr, \"Insomnia\"\n\n\"Why do you do it?\"\n\n\"I don't do it for the money. For the adrenalin, and because, like you, I'm interested in people.\n\nYeah, you can tell a lot about people from their stuff. How old would you say these people are?\"\n\n\"Don't know.\"\n\n\"You can tell a lot from the futon for a start. Young people have futons... And they've got one laundry bag, which means they're probably very used to each other... Look at the books. They're college educated... You can tell more from their music... when they go back and buy all this stuff from the shelves with the insurance money, they'll have to think for the first time in a long time... why they wanted all this stuff, what it's for. You take it away, and you show them what they had.\"\n\n- Bill and Cobb, on why he breaks into houses, \"Following\"\n\n\"You were a schemer. You had plans. Look where it got you. I just did what I do best-I took your plan and turned it on itself. Look what I have done to this city with a few drums of gas and a couple bullets. Nobody panics when the expected people get killed. Nobody panics when things go according to plan, even if the plans are horrifying. If I tell the press that tomorrow a gangbanger will get shot, or a truckload of soldiers will get blown up, nobody panics. But when I say one little old mayor will die, everyone loses their minds! Introduce a little anarchy, you upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos. I am an agent of chaos. And you know the thing about chaos, Harvey? It's fair.\"\n\n- The Joker, to DA Harvey Dent, \"The Dark Knight\"\n\n\"Let me get this straight: You think that your client, one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world, is secretly a vigilante who beats criminals to a pulp with his bare hands. And your plan is to blackmail this person? Good luck.\"\n\n- Lucius Fox, to an inquisitive accountant, \"The Dark Knight\"\n\n\"It uses sonar to give you a real-time image of the surroundings.\"\n\n\"Using sonar to see? Just like a...\" [begins to say 'Bat' then pauses]\n\n\"Like a submarine Mr. Wayne, like a submarine.\"\n\n- Lucius Fox and Bruce Wayne, \"The Dark Knight\"\n\n\"I read once about a woman whose secret fantasy was to have an affair with an artist. She thought he would really see her. He would see every curve, every line, every indentation and love them because they were part of the beauty that made her unique.\"\n\n- Ben Willis, artist, trading time for \"Cashback\"\n\n\"When I looked at Tanya Greene, I didn't just see her. I felt her.\"\n\n- Ben, recalling a schoolboy crush, \"Cashback\"\n\n\"Matt said he slept with you. So you didn't?\"\n\n\"No, of course not! What do you take me for? ...Did he say if I was any good?\"\n\n\"I think it was the best sex he's never had.\"\n\n- Ben and Sharon, \"Cashback\"\n\n\"The bad news is that time flies. The good news... is that you're the pilot.\"\n\n- Ben, \"Cashback\"\n\n\"I hate my life.\"\n\n\"I hate your life, too.\"\n\n- Lana & Brandon, \"Boys Don't Cry\"\n\n\"If you do this thing, you'll be lost, somewhere so deep you will never find yourself.\"\n\n- Father Horvak, to Frankie Dunn, \"Million Dollar Baby\"\n\n\"Sometimes the best way to deliver a punch is to step back... But step back too far and you ain't fighting at all.\"\n\n- Scrap, \"Million Dollar Baby\"\n\n\"Seems there are Irish people everywhere, or people who want to be.\"\n\n- Scrap, \"Million Dollar Baby\"\n\n\"Feels like the whole world is getting younger.\"\n\n- Walter, after a spell 'inside', \"The Woodsman\"\n\n\"I want you to die slow. I want you to die every day for the rest of your life.\"\n\n- Brad Jnr, \"At Close Range\"\n\n\"You know that feeling you get... that you didn't ask to be brought into the world? Well now that you're here, who's asking you to stay?\"\n\n- Francis, \"Exotica\"\n\n\"You'd make a great poker player, kid.\"\n\n- Mitchell Stephens to Nicole, \"The Sweet Hereafter\"\n\n\"When I say something which deserves consideration and you respond without thinking, how do you feel?\"\n\n\"I feel fine.\"\n\n\"I thought you might feel stupid.\"\n\n- Hera and Noah, \"The Adjuster\"\n\n\"They have everything they want, or they have the means to have everything they want, but they don't know what they need.\"\n\n- Bubba, on the characters in his film, \"The Adjuster\"\n\n\"People are vulnerable when they lose meaning. They do stupid things.\"\n\n- David to Raffi, \"Ararat\"\n\n\"All I ever wanted was for someone to say 'I love you' and not want anything for it.\"\n\n\"Somebody will.\"\n\n- Sandra Anderson and Buddy French, in \"Wilby Wonderful\"\n\n\"What do you see when you look at me?\"\n\n- Buddy, to his wife Carol, \"Wilby Wonderful\"\n\n\"Patrick!\"\n\n\"What? I'm greeting him like a brother.\"\n\n\"You're being obnoxious.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, exactly.\"\n\n- Jenny and Patrick Wheeler, \"Last Night\"\n\n\"As soon as they hear that the world is ending, they rush out and try and hook up with someone, like it was closing time... I mean, I know in my heart that I'm not in a meaningful relationship right now. I'm not with a woman that I love, and I can deal with that. I just feel that now is not the time to compromise.\"\n\n\"There's something to be said for human companionship.\"\n\n- Patrick and Sandra, \"Last Night\"\n\n\"If you gotta go, might as well be coming.\"\n\n- Craig's philosophy, \"Last Night\"\n\n\"I'm not gonna let this world take my life.\"\n\n- Sandra, taking matters into her own hands, \"Last Night\"\n\n\"Tell me something to make me love you. Tell me your big tragedy. About the girl you loved\n\nwho ran away or died.\"\n\n\"...She taught me how I could love.\"\n\n- Sandra to Patrick, \"Last Night\"\n\n\"In a way, I feel kind of privileged. I mean, it's the biggest thing that ever happened, and we're gonna be there. I mean, no one was there to witness the beginning, but we're gonna be there\n\nat the end.\"\n\n- Patrick, \"Last Night\"\n\n\"God, it's times like this when I really miss the night.\"\n\n- Patrick, \"Last Night\"\n\n\"A great numb feeling washes over me as I let go of the past and look forward to the future. Pretend to be a vampire. I don't really need to pretend, because it's who I am, an emotional vampire. I've just come to expect it. Vampires are real. That I was born this way. That I feed off of other people's real emotions. Search for this night's prey. Who will it be?\"\n\n- Sean Bateman, \"The Rules of Attraction\"\n\n\"Are you happy or sad?\"\n\n\"Well I'm not sad.\"\n\n\"You don't look happy.\"\n\n\"But do I look good?\"\n\n\"Always.\"\n\n- Clay and Blair, \"Less Than Zero\"\n\n\"You don't belong here man  these people are assholes!\"\n\n- Rip, welcoming Clay to a party, \"Less Than Zero\"\n\n\"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.\"\n\n- Pulp Fiction or Ezekiel 25:17\n\nYou can't help but compare yourself gainst the oldtimers. Can't help but wonder how they would've operated these times. There was this boy I sent to the gas chamber at Huntsville here a while back. My arrest and my testimony. He killed a fourteen-year-old girl. Papers said it was a crime of passion but he told me there wasn't any passion to it. Told me that he'd been planning to kill somebody for about as long as he could remember. Said that if they turned him out he'd do it again. Said he knew he was going to hell. Be there in about fifteen minutes. I don't know what to make of that. I surely don't. The crime you see now, it's hard to even take its measure. It's not that I'm afraid of it. I always knew you had to be willing to die to even do this job - not to be glorious. But I don't want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I don't understand. You can say it's my job to fight it, but I don't know what it is anymore. More than that, I don't want to know. A man would have to put his soul at hazard. He would have to say, \"O.K., I'll be part of this world.\"\n\n- Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, opening \"No Country For Old Men\"\n\n\"It sounds like these old boys died'a natural causes  natural to the line of work that is.\"\n\n- Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, investigating a drug deal gone wrong, \"No Country For Old Men\"\n\n\"What the f**k is that?\"\n\n\"This is a shotgun, Sol.\"\n\n\"It's a f**king anti-aircraft gun, Vincent.\"\n\n- Vinny and Sol, \"Snatch\"\n\n\"11:15, restate my assumptions : 1. Mathematics is the language of nature; 2. Everything around us can be represented and understood by numbers. 3. If you graph these numbers, patterns emerge. Therefore: There are patterns everywhere in nature.\"\n\n- Maximillian Cohen, \"Pi\"\n\n\"Personal note: When I was little my mother told me not to stare into the sun, so when I was six I did.\"\n\n- Maximillian Cohen, \"Pi\"\n\n\"I want money and I want sex and I want loads of it. I don't understand money and I don't understand women.\"\n\n- Christie, with not much of either, \"Christie Malry's Own Double-Entry\"\n\n\"Why'd you catch that?\"\n\n\"Because it was going to fall.\"\n\n\"You sure?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"But it didn't. Because you caught it. The fact that you stopped it from falling doesn't mean it wasn't going to fall.\"\n\n- John Anderton & Danny Witwer, \"Minority Report\"\n\n\"What are you looking for?\"\n\n\"Flaws.\"\n\n- John Anderton & Danny Witwer, \"Minority Report\"\n\n\"Is this some kind of joke?\"\n\n\"No Mam, we at the FBI do not have a sense of humor we are aware of.\"\n\n- Men In Black\n\n\"If the intelligence community is a family, think of us as the uncle no one talks about.\"\n\n- Conspiracy Theory\n\n\"David Berkowitz, Ted Bundy, Richard Speck...\"\n\n\"What about them?\"\n\n\"Serial killers. Serial killers only have two names. You ever notice that? But lone gunmen assassins, they always have three names. John Wilkes Booth, Lee Harvey Oswald, Mark David Chapman...\"\n\n\"John Hinckley. He shot Reagan. He only has two names.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but he only just shot Reagan. Reagan didn't die. If Reagan had died, I'm pretty sure we probably would all know what John Hinckley's middle name was.\"\n\n- Jerry and Alice, \"Conspiracy Theory\"\n\n\"No, no. Psychopaths kill for no reason. I kill for *money*. It's a *job*. That didn't come out right.\"\n\n- Martin Blank, \"Grosse Point Blank\"\n\n\"Martin, I'm emotionally involved with you.\"\n\n\"How are you emotionally involved with me?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid of you.\"\n\n\"You're afraid of me.\"\n\n\"And that constitutes an emotional involvement, and it would be unethical for me to work with you under those circumstances.\"\n\n- Dr Oatman & Martin Blank, \"Grosse Point Blank\"\n\n\"You don't know my cat. It's very demanding.\"\n\n\"It? You don't know if it's a boy or a girl?\"\n\n\"I respect its privacy.\"\n\n- Martin Blank & Debi, \"Grosse Point Blank\"\n\n\"How was your date?\"\n\n\"Well, there were two moments of extreme violence...\"\n\n- Ken and Ray, \"In Bruges\"\n\n\"Are you sick?\"\n\n\"Yes I am.\"\n\n\"Do you take medicine?\"\n\n\"There is no medicine for my sickness.\"\n\n- Garland befriends a little girl, \"Con Air\"\n\n\"Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death, and I can do all of them.\"\n\n- Hackers\n\n\"Sorry, Luke. I'm just doing my job. You gotta appreciate that.\"\n\n\"Nah. Calling it your job don't make it right, Boss.\"\n\n- Boss & Luke, \"Cool Hand Luke\"\n\n\"The book says, we might be through with the past, but the past ain't through with us.\"\n\n- Jimmy Gator, \"Magnolia\"\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"I'm quietly judging you.\"\n\n- Gwen and Frank TJ Mackey, \"Magnolia\"\n\n\"This is the scene in the movie where you help me.\"\n\n- Phil, \"Magnolia\"\n\n\"I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me. Years ago we had the church. That was only a way of saying  we had each other. The Knights of Columbus were real head-breakers; true guineas. They took over their piece of the city. Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get a fucking job, we had the presidency. May rest in peace. That's what the niggers don't realize. If I got one thing against the black chappies, it's this - no one gives it to you. You have to take it.\"\n\n- Frank Costello, \"The Departed\"\n\n\"Church wants you on your place. Kneel, stand, kneel, stand. If you go for that sort of thing, I don't know what to do for you. A man makes his own way. No one gives it to you. You have to take it.

I'll deal with something being wrong for thr rest of my life.\"\n\n- Colin Sullivan, \"The Departed\"\n\nI always believed it was the things you don't choose that makes you who you are. Your city, your neighborhood, your family. People here take pride in these things, like it was something they'd accomplished. The bodies around their souls, the cities wrapped around those. I lived on this block my whole life; most of these people have. When your job is to find people who are missing, it helps to know where they started. I find the people who started in the cracks and then fell through. This city can be hard. When I was young, I asked my priest how you could get to heaven and still protect yourself from all the evil in the world. He told me what God said to His children. \"You are sheep among wolves. Be wise as serpents, yet innocent as doves.\"\n\n- Patrick Kenzie, opening \"Gone Baby Gone\"\n\n\"He lied to me.

We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.\n\nTo quote from Whitman, \"O me! O life!... of the questions of these recurring; of the endless trains of the faithless - of cities filled with the foolish; what good amid these, O me, O life? Answer. That you are here - that life exists, and identity; that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse.\"\n\nWhat will your verse be?\n\n- John Keating, \"Dead Poet's Society\"\n\nNo, at that time I was not the mental giant that you see before you.

Say it's concentration. Say it's supposed to focus your attention on the person you're sleeping with, like biological highlighter. Otherwise, there's just too many people in the world.\"\n\n- Carl, \"The Opposite of Sex\"\n\nOnly knowledge can turn life's unbearableness into a weapon.\n\n- Mishima\n\nYou can trick them into loving you by making them pity not hate your deformity.\n\n- Mishima\n\n\"You're one of those memorable people.\"\n\n- Lawyer to Finbar (Peter Dinklage), \"The Station Agent\"\n\n\"It's really funny how people see me and treat me, since I'm really just a simple, boring person.\"\n\n- Finbar 'Fin' McBride, \"The Station Agent\"\n\nHave you ever had a dream with a dwarf in it? Do you know anyone who's had a dream with a dwarf in it? No! I don't even have dreams with dwarves in them. The only place I've seen dwarves in dreams is in stupid movies like this! \"Oh make it weird, put a dwarf in it!\". Everyone will go \"Woah, this must be a fuckin' dream, there's a fuckin' dwarf in it!\". Well I'm sick of it!

All of the sudden even though you have some place where you can put your stuff that idea of home is gone... I mean it's like this rite of passage, you know. You won't have this feeling again until you create a new idea of home for yourself, you know, for you kids, for the family you start, it's like a cycle or something. I miss the idea of it. Maybe that's all family really is. A group of people who miss the same imaginary place.\"\n\n- Andrew to Sam, \"Garden State\"\n\n\"What you feel only matters to you.

Harold Crick was a man of infinite numbers, endless calculations, and remarkably few words. And his wristwatch said even less. Every weekday, for twelve years, Harold would brush each of his thirty-two teeth seventy-six times. Thirty-eight times back and forth, thirty-eight times up and down. Every weekday, for twelve years, Harold would tie his tie in a single Windsor knot instead of the double, thereby saving up to forty-three seconds. His wristwatch thought the single Windsor made his neck look fat, but said nothing.\n\n- Kay Eiffel, introducing \"Stranger Than Fiction\"\n\nLittle did he know that this simple seemingly innocuous act would result in his imminent death.\n\n- Kay Eiffel, narrating the story of \"Stranger Than Fiction\"\n\n\"I'm afraid what you're describing is schizophrenia.\"\n\n\"No, no, it's not schizophrenia. It's just a voice in my head. I mean, the voice isn't telling me to do anything. It's telling me what I've already done. Accurately, and with a better vocabulary.\"\n\n\"Mr. Crick, you have a voice speaking to you.\"\n\n\"No, not to me. About me. I'm somehow involved in some sort of story.

On a scale of one to ten, what are the chances that you'll be assassinated  one being highly unlikely, ten being you're expecting it around every corner?\"\n\n- Harold visits a literature professor to discuss his situation, \"Stranger Than Fiction\"\n\n\"I used to have this professor at Oxford, okay? Doctor Wickham... he taught biomolecular kinetics and cellular dynamics. And he used to sort of scare the underclassmen with this story about how the world would eventually be eviscerated by technology. You see, it was inevitable that a compound would be created which he referred to as the 'Anti-God'. It was like an accelerated mutator or sort of, you know, like a, an unstoppable force of destructive power, that would just lay waste to everything - to buildings and parks and streets and children and ice cream parlors, you know? So whenever I see, like, a rogue organization willing to spend this amount of money on a mystery tech, I always assume... it's the Anti-God. End-of-the-world kinda stuff, you know...
