        "text": "Today's health care environment is experiencing unprecedented, intense reformation. Unlike yesterday's leadership requirement for stabilization and growth, today's leaders are required to transform their organization's values, beliefs, and behaviors. It is relatively easy to lead people where they want to go; the transformational leader must lead people to where they need to be in order to meet the demands of the future. This requires vision, influence, clinical knowledge, and a strong expertise relating to professional nursing practice. It also acknowledges that transformation may create turbulence and involve atypical approaches to solutions.\n\nThe organization's senior leadership team creates the vision for the future, and the systems and environment necessary to achieve that vision. They must enlighten the organization as to why change is necessary, and communicate each department's part in achieving that change. They must listen, challenge, influence, and affirm as the organization makes its way into the future. Gradually, this transformational way of thinking should take root in the organization and become even stronger as other leaders adapt to this way of thinking.\n\nThe intent of this Model Component is no longer just to solve problems, fix broken systems, and empower staff, but to actually transform the organizations to meet the future. Magnet-recognized organizations today strive for stabilization; however, healthcare reformation calls for a type of controlled destabilization that births new ideas and innovations.\n\nForces of Magnetism Represented\n\nQuality of Nursing Leadership (Force #1)\n\nManagement Style (Force #3)\n\nSolid structures and processes developed by influential leadership provide an innovative environment where strong professional practice flourishes and where the mission, vision, and values come to life to achieve the outcomes believed to be important for the organization. Further strengthening practice are the strong relationships and partnerships developed among all types of community organizations to improve patient outcomes and the health of the communities they serve. This is accomplished through the organization's strategic plan, structure, systems, policies, and programs. Staff need to be developed, directed, and empowered to find the best way to accomplish the organizational goals and achieve desired outcomes. This may be accomplished through a variety of structures and programs; one size does not fit all. Forces of Magnetism Represented\n\nOrganizational Structure (Force #2)\n\nPersonnel Policies and Programs (Force #4)\n\nCommunity and the Healthcare Organization (Force #10)\n\nImage of Nursing (Force #12)\n\nProfessional Development (Force #14)\n\nToday's Magnet recognition process primarily focuses on structure and processes, with an assumption that good outcomes will follow. Currently, outcomes are not specified, and are minimally weighted. There are no quantitative outcome requirements for ANCC Magnet Recognition Â®. Recently lacking were benchmark data that would allow comparisons with best practices. This area is where the greatest changes need to occur. Data of this caliber will spur needed changes.\n\nIn the future, having a strong structure and processes are the first steps. In other words, the question for the future is not \"What do you do?\" or \"How do you do it?\" but rather, \"What difference have you made?\" Magnet-recognized organizations are in a unique position to become pioneers of the future and to demonstrate solutions to numerous problems inherent in our healthcare systems today. They may do this in a variety of ways through innovative structure and various processes, and they ought to be recognized, not penalized, for their inventiveness.\n\nOutcomes need to be categorized in terms of clinical outcomes related to nursing; workforce outcomes; patient and consumer outcomes; and organizational outcomes. When possible, outcomes data that the organization already collects should be utilized. Quantitative benchmarks should be established. These outcomes will represent the \"report card\" of a Magnet-recognized organization, and a simple way of demonstrating excellence.\n\nForces of Magnetism Represented\n\nQuality of Care (Force #6)\n\nThe new ANCC Magnet Application Manual will incorporate these 5 Model Components as the primary basis for achieving Magnet recognition, with the 14 Forces of Magnetism remaining as the foundation of the program.\n\nThe sources of evidence, consolidated to eliminate redundancy and streamline the documentation process, will be reviewed by selected members of the Magnet community prior to the launch of the new Application Manual in 2008."
