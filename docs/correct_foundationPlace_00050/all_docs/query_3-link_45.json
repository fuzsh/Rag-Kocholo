        "text": "At its core, FinOps is a cultural practice. It’s the way for teams to manage their cloud costs, where everyone takes ownership of their cloud usage supported by a central best-practices group. Cross-functional teams in Engineering, Finance, Product, etc work together to enable faster product delivery, while at the same time gaining more financial control and predictability.\n\nFinOps is a portmanteau of “Finance” and “DevOps”, stressing the communications and collaboration between business and engineering teams.\n\nOther names for the practice include “Cloud Financial Management”, “Cloud Financial Engineering” “Cloud Cost Management”, “Cloud Optimization”, or “Cloud Financial Optimization”.\n\nIt is sometimes incorrectly referred to “Cloud Financial Operations” but that term is falling out of favor due to its ambiguity with the more traditional “Financial Operations” role that exists in Finance.\n\nFinOps Framework: Bringing Accountability to Cloud Spend\n\nBrowse the FinOps Framework.\n\nDownload Intro to FinOps slides in Google Slides or Powerpoint\n\nRead the Adopting FinOps in your Organization project\n\nRegardless of the name, FinOps is the practice of bringing a financial accountability cultural change to the variable spend model of cloud, enabling distributed engineering and business teams to make trade-offs between speed, cost, and quality in their cloud architecture and investment decisions.\n\nIf it seems that FinOps is about saving money, then think again. FinOps is about getting the most value out of cloud to drive efficient growth.\n\nCloud spend can drive more revenue, signal customer base growth, enable more product and feature release velocity, or even help shut down a data center. FinOps is all about removing blockers; empowering engineering teams to deliver better features, apps, and migrations faster; and enabling a cross-functional conversation about where to invest and when. Sometimes a business will decide to tighten the belt; sometimes it’ll decide to invest more. But now teams know why they’re making those decisions.\n\nWhere to start learning FinOps\n\nThe FinOps Foundation offers a variety of ways to learn about the disciple depending on your level of maturity and time commitment:\n\nWatch the Intro to FinOps on YouTube\n\nBrowse the FinOps Framework\n\nRead the Cloud FinOps book\n\nBrowse FinOps Assets for guides and playbooks\n\nRead how to Adopt FinOps in an organization\n\nAttend FinOps Community Events\n\nExplore the State of FinOps\n\nGet FinOps Certified\n\nFinOps Maturity Model\n\nThe practice of FinOps is inherently iterative and maturity of any given process, functional activity, Capability or Domain will improve with repetition. Typically a “Crawl” stage organization is highly reactive and focused on addressing problems after they occur, while a Run stage practice is proactively factoring cost into their architecture design choices and ongoing engineering processes.\n\nA “Crawl, Walk, Run” maturity approach to performing FinOps enables organizations to start small, and grow in scale, scope and complexity as business value warrants maturing a functional activity. Taking quick action at a small scale and limited scope allows FinOps teams to assess the outcomes of their actions, and to gain insights into the value of taking further action in a larger, faster, or more granular way.\n\nLearn more about FinOps Maturity on the FinOps Framework.\n\nCore Stakeholders of Cloud Financial Management\n\nWhile a central FinOps function may work to enable organizational change, FinOps is not done by a single person or team but rather changes the way that disparate engineering, finance, and business teams work together. Individuals at every level and in every area of an organization can have a different role to play in the FinOps practice: Executives, Engineers, FinOps Practitioners, Operations, Finance and Procurement.\n\nRead more about FinOps Personas and Roles.\n\nFinOps Principles"
