To address this, his expertise lies in the functional interpretation of human genetic variants using genomic and bioinformatic methodologies. He graduated from Seoul National University (SNU), Seoul, Korea, majoring in Molecular Biology (BS and MS). During the Ph.D course at Duke University, he studied cardiovascular system development in mice. In his postdoctoral training at Yale University, he studied human genetics, setting up a whole exome sequencing pipeline and applying it to various human diseases to identify causal genes. He received a K99/R00 grant for the postdoctoral works and was a recipient of SNU Invitation Program for Distinguished Scholar grant.\n\nEstablishing his independent lab at SNU, he has been studying the genetic mechanisms of rare disease pathogenesis, focusing on cases with neurodevelopmental defects. His current approach combines developmental biology and genetics, shaped by the fact that most pediatric rare disease patients experience congenital problems. More recently, his group has undertaken common disease research. His group recently established a bioinformatic pipeline that allows screening of eQTL signals only functioning in the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) status and validated its utility. At SNU, he has been instrumental in establishing genetics and genomics methodologies by collaborating with clinicians in SNU Hospital. His lab has recently established protocols in advanced functional genomics approaches, including single-cell sequencing, saturation mutagenesis, modifier screening, and cell tracing technique to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying disease progression.\n\nHe has a strong interest in clinical and translational research, especially in elucidating genotype-phenotype relationships that may lead to human diseases.

After undergraduate studies at the University of Cambridge and post-graduate research at the University of Warwick, he performed postdoctoral research with Bernard Moss at the NIH and with Tony Hunter at the Salk Institute. With Tony, he found that oncogenic retroviruses (Rous sarcoma virus and others) and growth factors (EGF and PDGF) stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of overlapping subsets of cell proteins, which were candidates to regulate cell proliferation and metabolism. He joined Fred Hutch in 1985 to continue the work he started at the Salk, investigating the mechanisms by which protein kinases regulate cell proliferation and transformation. His laboratory played important roles in establishing how Src is regulated, how activated growth factor receptors recruit signaling proteins, and establishing Ras-Raf-MAPK signaling. In 1995, postdoc Brian Howell knocked out the gene for a Src substrate and observed a distinctive brain development phenotype. Efforts by several laboratories rapidly established a signaling pathway that regulates neuron migrations during brain development. Further studies on this pathway revealed the importance of ubiquitination and degradation for terminating signaling, and led in recent years to detailed investigation of the roles of Cullin-RING ligases in regulating signal transduction events in vivo and in cultured cells.\n\nExpertise\n\nCell Biology\n\nResearch focus\n\nsignaling pathways\n\ncell migration\n\npost-translational modifications\n\nneuron migrations\n\nimmune cell migration\n\nphosphorylation\n\ncell transformation\n\nCompeting interests statement\n\nJon Cooper receives research grants from the NIH.\n\nClaude Desplan, DSc, PhD is a Silver Professor of Biology and Neuroscience at NYU and an Affiliate Professor at the CGSB at NYU in Abu Dhabi.

He is a Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Professor of Medical Science, and Mencoff Family University Professor at Brown. He sees patients in his weekly clinic at Rhode Island Hospital focused on care of patients with colorectal cancer and participates in clinical trials based on his laboratory’s research on novel therapeutics. He previously served as Deputy Director for Translational Research, co-Leader of the Molecular Therapeutics Program, Professor of Oncology, and the William Wikoff Smith Endowed Chair in Cancer Research at Fox Chase Cancer Center. From 2010 through 2014 Dr El-Deiry was the Rose Dunlap Professor of Medicine and Chief of Hematology-Oncology at Penn State. In 2009, El-Deiry became an American Cancer Society Research Professor. He was previously a tenured Professor of Medicine (Hematology-Oncology), Genetics, and Pharmacology at University of Pennsylvania, co-Leader of the Radiobiology and Imaging Program at the Abramson Cancer Center and Associate Director for Physician-Scientist Training in Hematology-Oncology when he left Penn in 2010. He earned MD/PhD degrees from University of Miami School of Medicine and completed internal medicine residency and medical oncology fellowship at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center. As a practicing academic Oncologist, his scientific interest and expertise is in cell death, drug resistance in cancer and drug discovery and development. El-Deiry founded two companies, Oncoceutics, Inc. and p53-Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nEl-Deiry discovered p21(WAF1) as a p53 target gene, universal cell cycle inhibitor, and tumor suppressor gene that for the first time explained the mammalian cell stress response. He discovered TRAIL receptor DR5 and its regulation by p53. TRAIL is part of the host immune system that suppresses cancer and its metastases. His lab created a knock-out mouse for TRAIL receptor DR5 and this mouse is tumor prone and develops an inflammatory syndrome in the lungs and gut after sub-lethal irradiation. He identified c-Myc as a major determinant of TRAIL sensitivity and demonstrated synergy between TRAIL therapy and multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib. Building on his prior accomplishments, El-Deiry discovered ONC201/TIC10 as a first-in-class TRAIL pathway inducer that is orally bioavailable and crosses the blood-brain barrier to treat brain tumors. TRAIL and Foxo3a are required for the anti-tumor effect of ONC201 through dual blockade of ERK and Akt kinases that promotes the nuclear translocation of the Foxo3a transcription factor which directly regulates the TRAIL gene. Data from El-Deiry’s lab identified that ONC201 induces TRAIL receptor DR5 through an integrated stress response involving ATF4 and CHOP transcription factors. Patients with among the most aggressive gliomas (H3K27M mutant DIPG) have had exceptional responses to ONC201.\n\nAs a physician-scientist, Dr El-Deiry has worked to bring new discoveries to the clinic. He is committed in the next phase of his career to unraveling the mechanisms involved in p53 pathway restoration by candidate therapeutics his lab has discovered. This is exciting as he is defining a novel class of anti-cancer drugs with p53 pathway restoration and S-phase checkpoint targeting and recognizing ATF4 as a major transcription factor mechanism for p53 pathway restoration in p53-null or p53 mutant tumor cells. He is establishing transcriptomic and proteomic data sets with chemotherapy that acts through p53, and with novel small molecules that restore the p53 pathway in p53-deficient or mutant p53 expressing cells. He is exploiting medicinal chemistry and organoid technologies to perform his translational science that is leading to clinical trials some of which he leads. Dr El-Deiry conducts basic and translational clinical oncology therapeutics research through funded NIH grants, Foundations and industry. He is a member of the ASCI, AAP, Past President of the Interurban Clinical Club, previous Chair of ASCO’s Tumor Biology Track, and past Chair of an NIH Study Section on Cancer Therapeutics.

As examples, she is recognized for her work related to the role of NODAL, a stem-cell associated protein, in cancer progression, as well as significant contributions related to extracellular matrices, the role of hypoxia in cancer progression and more recently the role of mRNA translation in cancer cell plasticity. Her discoveries have also provided the foundations for three patents. While focused on fundamental biology related to cancer cell plasticity, Dr Postovit’s research has often been translated to the clinic, for the benefit of patients.\n\nExemplifying her stature in the field, Dr Postovit has served on the editorial boards of journals and has presented her work at international conferences and institutions around the globe. Dr Postovit’s achievements have also been recognized by invitations to participate on scientific advisory boards, adjudication panels, and planning committees. For instance, she was a member of the Standing Committee on Research Excellence [Terry Fox Research Institute (TFRI)], the Scientific Advisory Board for the Cancer Research Society, the AACR Regional Advisory Subcommittee of Canada, and the Medical Review panel (Gairdner Foundation). These boards decided the outcomes of some of the most prestigious awards and grants related to cancer research. Dr Postovit has also received several awards and accolades: For example, she was the top ranked New Investigator at the CIHR (2009) and in 2016, was nominated to the college of the Royal Society of Canada.\n\nImportantly, Dr Postovit has been a dedicated advocate for the research enterprise at large. She was a founding co-director of the Cancer Research Institute of Northern Alberta, wherein she built educational programming and organizational structures to support translational cancer research. More recently she has been building core research capacities at Queen’s, obtaining funds from sources such as the Transformative Educational Research Fund, to establish team based experiential learning opportunities in the health sciences and to ensure equitable access to research infrastructure.\n\nExpertise\n\nCancer Biology\n\nCell Biology\n\nStem Cells and Regenerative Medicine\n\nResearch focus\n\ncellular plasticity\n\ntumour microenvironment\n\nhypoxia\n\nstem cells\n\nmetastasis\n\novarian cancer\n\nbreast cancer\n\nCompeting interests statement\n\nDr Postovit holds funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Cancer Research Society, the Canadian Cancer Society and the Canadian Foundation for Innovation.\n\nLois EH Smith MD, PhD is an ophthalmologist and clinician/scientist at Boston Children’s Hospital and Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School. Her basic research work is in retinal neovascularization, both basic mechanism and treatment including diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, age-related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa.\n\nShe has a long standing interest in eye diseases particularly retinopathy of prematurity, diabetic retinopathy, and AMD and in the mechanisms behind these diseases, particularly the underlying causes of neovascularization and the interactions between neurons and vessels. Many pathways that they have found have been translated into clinical trials, including replacement of IGF-1 in preterm infants and treatment of AMD with anti-VEGF antibodies in which they were the first to show the benefit of blocking VEGF in a mouse model of retinopathy. More recently Dr Smith's work has been interested in metabolic function in photoreceptors, particularly with respect to lipids. Photoreceptor metabolic dysfunction causes central vision loss in retinal degenerative diseases (including ROP) but is also implicated in age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.\n\nDr Smith is the recipient of the Friedenwald award, the Alcon Research Institute award, the Silverman award, and the Bressler Prize.\n\nExpertise\n\nDevelopmental Biology\n\nMedicine\n\nNeuroscience\n\nResearch focus\n\nage-related macular degeneration\n\ndiabetic eye disease\n\nretinopathy\n\nocular disease\n\ndevelopmental neuroscience\n\nCompeting interests statement\n\nDr Smith has received funding from the National Eye Institute, Massachusetts Lions Eye Research Fund, the European Union, the Lowy Medical Research Institute, Foundation Fighting Blindness, Research to Prevent Blindness Senior Investigator Award, and the Alcon Award.Current editor roles include: Editor for Ophthalmology (Science), Editor for Journal of Clinical Ophthalmology, and Editor IOVS (Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science).\n\nDidier Stainier is the director of the Department of Developmental Genetics at the Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research, Bad Nauheim (Frankfurt), Germany.

After finishing his post-doc training at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, he started his own lab at the University of Nevada School of Medicine, where he rose through the ranks and eventually named University Foundation Professor, the highest honor the University bestows upon its faculty. In 2020, he joined The Lundquist Institute at Harbor-UCLA to direct the newly established National Center for Male Reproductive Epigenomics, one of the seven National Centers for Translational Research in Reproduction and Infertility (NCTRI) supported by the NICDH. The Yan lab works on genetic and epigenetic control of fertility and the epigenetic contribution of gametes to fertilization, early embryonic development, and adulthood health. He has so far published over 160 peer-reviewed research articles and book chapters with over 12,00 citations.\n\nHis lab first put forward a novel idea for the development of non-hormonal male contraceptives: “Do not kill, but disable sperm”, which led to the discovery of TRIPTONIDE, a natural compound, as a reversible non-hormonal contraceptive agent in mice and monkeys, and established it as a drug candidate for “The Pill” for men. His lab also discovered the function of motile cilia in the reproductive tracts. In the male, motile ciliary beating function as an agitator to maintain the constant suspension of immotile testicular sperm during their transit through the efferent ductules in men. In the female, motile cilia in the oviduct/Fallopian tube are essential for oocyte pickup and fertility, but dispensable for embryo and sperm transport, which are mostly achieved through smooth muscle contraction. This discovery solved the long-standing controversy about the role of cilia beating vs. muscle contraction in gamete/embryo transport. His lab elucidated several novel mechanisms underlying the unique regulation of gene expression during the haploid phase of spermatogenesis, including global shortening of transcripts, delayed translation/uncoupling of transcription and translation, and dynamic changes in poly(A) length and non-A contents. His lab first discovered mitochondrial genome-encoded small RNAs (mitosRNAs), endo-siRNAs in the male germline and MSCI-escaping X-linked miRNAs. His lab was also among those that suggested critical functions of sperm-borne RNAs in supporting early embryonic development and epigenetic inheritance.\n\nWei Yan’s contributions to science have been recognized by several academic awards, including the 2009 Society for the Study of Reproduction (SSR) Young Investigator Award, the 2012 American Society of Andrology (ASA) Young Andrologist Award, the 2013 Nevada Healthcare Hero Award for Research and Technology, the 2017 University of Nevada, Reno Outstanding Researcher Award, the 2018 SSR Research Award and the 2020 Nevada System of Higher Education Research Award.

As an early adopter of systems biology techniques, Dr Yuen has extensive experience in gene expression profiling. His group showed that, while both hallucinogenic and non-hallucinogenic chemicals activate the serotonin 2A receptor (5HT2AR), their transcriptome fingerprint is distinct. Their discovery that 5HT2AR forms a functional complex with the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR2 to trigger hallucinogenic responses suggests that the 5HT2AR/mGluR2 complex is a promising new target for the treatment of psychosis. Together with Dr Maria New, Dr Yuen established genotype–genotype correlations in 1507 patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and have used an in silico approach of molecular modeling to define precisely the structural defect in the enzyme from a given mutation. Additionally, in collaboration with Lasker Awardee Professor Dennis Lo, by targeted deep sequencing of fetal DNA in maternal plasma, they have established the feasibility of prenatal diagnosis of CAH as early as 6 weeks of pregnancy with 100% reliability. Furthermore, Dr Yuen demonstrated that bisphosphonates, the most widely used class of drugs for osteoporosis and skeletal metastases, bind directly to the kinase domain of the human EGF family of receptors. He found that these drugs inhibit cell signaling and reduce cell viability in vitro. Xenotransplant studies have documented potent effects of bisphosphonates on the growth of EGFR–positive human tumor cells. These studies lay the basis for repurposing bisphosphonates towards the treatment and prevention of EGFR–driven cancers, in addition to the known benefit of these agents in ameliorating cancer metastases. Dr. Yuen is also deeply involved in skeletal and metabolic phenotyping of mice to understand the effects of FSH inhibition on bone remodeling, bone mass, fat mass and energy homeostasis. More recently, based on the collaborative findings with Dr Keqiang Ye that FSH inhibition prevents neuropathology and cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease models, Dr Yuen have developed a new and evolving interest in neurodegeneration. Thus, his current research focus is on understanding the biology of FSH action on the brain, as well as on dissecting the relationship between serum FSH levels and cognition as a function of aging.\n\nExpertise\n\nMedicine\n\nResearch focus\n\nMendelian genetics\n\nrare diseases\n\ncancer therapeutics\n\npituitary hormones\n\nneurodegeneration\n\nosteoporosis\n\nobesity\n\nCompeting interests statement\n\nCurrent NIH funding: R01AG071870 (2021–2026), U01AG073148 (2021–2026), R01AG074092 (2021–2026), R01DK107670 (2022–2026).
