        "text": "In 2019, the HKMA and the Bank of Thailand (BOT) commenced Project Inthanon-LionRock to study the application of CBDCs for cross-border payments. This project was completed in December 2019 and a DLT-based PoC prototype was developed successfully together with ten participating banks from both places. The HKMA and the BOT jointly published a leaflet and a report in November 2019 and January 2020 respectively to present the key findings.\n\nInthanon-LionRock: Leveraging Distributed Ledger Technology to Increase Efficiency in Cross-Border Payments (Leaflet)\n\nProject Inthanon-LionRock entered the second phase in 2020. With the joining of the Digital Currency Institute of the People’s Bank of China (PBC DCI) and the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (CBUAE) in February 2021, and with the strong support of the Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub (BISIH) Centre in Hong Kong, the project has evolved into the third phase and was renamed as the Multiple CBDC Bridge (mBridge).\n\nProject mBridge further explores the capabilities of DLT, through developing a trial platform, to facilitate real-time cross-border foreign exchange payment-versus-payment transactions in a multi-jurisdictional context and on a 24/7 basis. Project mBridge also explores business use cases in a cross-border context using both domestic and foreign currencies. Participating institutions jointly published a report in September 2021 to deliver the key takeaways of Project Inthanon-LionRock Phase 2 and introduce the scope of mBridge.\n\nInthanon-LionRock to mBridge: Building a multi CBDC platform for international payments\n\nA brochure was published in November 2021 to present the development progress of Project mBridge, including the potential business use cases identified, trial transactions on international trade settlement, and an outline of the future roadmap of the platform.\n\nmBridge: Building a multi CBDC platform for international payments\n\nIn Q3 2022, Project mBridge entered the pilot phase. During the six-week pilot, 20 banks in four jurisdictions used the mBridge platform to conduct over 160 payment and foreign exchange transactions totalling more than HK$171 million. It was among the first multi-CBDC projects to settle real-value, cross-border transactions on behalf of corporates. A report was published in October 2022 to deliver the results and key lessons learnt of the pilot.\n\nProject mBridge: Connecting economies through CBDC\n\nA brochure was published in October 2023 to provide an update on and outline the next steps for Project mBridge.\n\nProject mBridge Update: Experimenting with a multi-CBDC platform for cross-border payments\n\nIn March 2024 the HKMA launched Project Ensemble, a new wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC) project, to support the development of the tokenisation market in Hong Kong. Project Ensemble seeks to explore innovative financial market infrastructure (FMI) that will facilitate seamless interbank settlement of tokenised money through wCBDC. The project will initially focus on tokenised deposits, which is a digital representation of commercial bank deposits. With wCBDC as the foundation, tokenised deposits can be used for tokenised asset transactions.\n\nAt the core of Project Ensemble is the Project Ensemble Sandbox (Sandbox) that will be launched in 2024 to further research and test tokenisation use cases, including, among others, settlement of tokenised real world assets. It could potentially forge a new FMI that bridges the existing gap between tokenised real world assets and money in transactions. If the Sandbox garners sufficient interest from the industry, the HKMA will consider conducting a “live” issuance of wCBDC at an appropriate time.\n\nFor general enquiries about Project Ensemble, please contact us via ensemble@hkma.gov.hk . For enquiries about the Sandbox, please reach out to us via ensemble_sandbox@hkma.gov.hk .\n\nTo help set industry standards and a future-proof strategy, the HKMA formed the Project Ensemble Architecture Community (the Community) in May 2024. Please refer to the relevant section below for more details of the Community.\n\nProject Ensemble Architecture Community\n\nThe Community aims to develop a set of industry standards to support interoperability among wCBDC, tokenised money and tokenised assets. It will make recommendations on specific topics, initially focusing on setting up a mechanism to support seamless interbank settlement of tokenised deposit through wCBDC for tokenised asset transactions.\n\nThe formation of the Community is based on a range of careful considerations, including the members’ expertise in contributing to the development of the tokenisation market in Hong Kong, experience and competency in relevant fields and innovative capability. The HKMA will be working closely with the industry, and review the size and composition of the Community from time to time as and when deemed appropriate.\n\nFor enquiries about the Community, please contact us via ensemble_ac@hkma.gov.hk .\n\nList of Community Members (by alphabetical order for each category)\n\nCategory\n\nMember\n\nRegulator\n\nHong Kong Monetary Authority\n\nSecurities and Futures Commission\n\nInternational Organisation\n\nBank for International Settlements Innovation Hub Hong Kong Centre\n\nCBDC Expert Group\n\nList of CBDC Expert Group members\n\nBank\n\nBank of China (Hong Kong) Limited\n\nHang Seng Bank Limited\n\nThe Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited\n\nStandard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited\n\nDigital Asset Stakeholder\n\nHashKey Group\n\nTechnology Company\n\nAnt Digital Technologies\n\nMicrosoft Hong Kong Limited\n\nProject Ensemble Sandbox\n\nDetails to be announced in mid-2024.\n\nThe HKMA conducted two rounds of market consultations on issuing an e-HKD, with one on high-level technical designs, and the other on key policy and design issues. The HKMA published a paper in September 2022 to provide its initial views on how to best position Hong Kong for future developments in the sphere of digital currencies and payments.\n\nTechnical Perspective\n\nA technical whitepaper titled “e-HKD: A technical perspective” was published in October 2021 to explore potential technical design options for issuing and distributing a retail CBDC. This whitepaper builds on the model for a retail CBDC as jointly investigated by the HKMA and the BISIH Centre in Hong Kong. It is the first among similar papers published by central banks to unveil a technical architecture that includes a ground-breaking privacy preservation arrangement that allow transactions to be traced in a privacy-amicable manner.\n\ne-HKD: A technical perspective\n\nPolicy and Design Perspective\n\nA discussion paper titled “e-HKD: A Policy and Design Perspective” was published in April 2022. It discusses the potential benefits and challenges of an e-HKD, various design considerations (e.g. issuance mechanism and legal considerations), as well as the potential use cases for an e-HKD.\n\ne-HKD: A Policy and Design Perspective\n\nPolicy Stance and Three-Rail Approach\n\nTaking into account the findings of the study and the feedback received from these two rounds of market consultation, the HKMA published a position paper titled “e-HKD: Charting the Next Steps” in September 2022 to set out its policy stance on an e-HKD. The paper outlined a three-rail approach that will be adopted to pave the way for the possible implementation of an e-HKD in Hong Kong.\n\ne-HKD – Charting the Next Steps\n\nThree-rail approach for the potential implementation of an e-HKD:\n\nRail 1 aims to lay the technology and legal foundations for supporting the future implementation of an e-HKD.\n\nRail 2 runs in parallel to Rail 1, and takes deep dives into potential use cases, and implementation and design issues relating to an e-HKD. In particular, the e-HKD Pilot Programme was launched in November 2022 as a joint effort between the HKMA and the industry to explore and evaluate the commercial viability of potential use cases for an e-HKD as well as to gain actual experience, through a series of pilots conducted with the industry.\n\nRail 3 will consolidate the outcomes of Rail 1 and Rail 2 for more thorough implementation planning, and will set the timeline for launching an e-HKD. The progress of Rail 3 will depend on the actual progress made under Rail 1 and Rail 2, as well as the pace of relevant local and international market development. The HKMA has not yet reached a policy decision on whether or when to introduce an e-HKD.\n\nThe HKMA launched the e-HKD Pilot Programme, a key component of Rail 2, in November 2022. The HKMA has also developed an e-HKD Sandbox to enable participants of the e-HKD Pilot Programme to accelerate their prototyping, development and testing of their use cases, as well as to gain actual experience.\n\nPhase 1 of the e-HKD Pilot Programme commenced in May 2023, and took deep dives into potential domestic and retail use cases in six categories: full-fledged payments, programmable payments, offline payments, tokenised deposits, settlement of Web3 transactions, and settlement of tokenised assets. 16 firms from financial, payment and technology sectors were selected to participate.\n\nThe HKMA published the “e-HKD Pilot Programme Phase 1 Report” in October 2023 to discuss the key findings, learnings, and the HKMA’s assessment of the conducted pilots. The pilots showed that there were three areas where an e-HKD could potentially add unique value to the current ecosystem, namely: programmability, tokenisation, and atomic settlement. The HKMA recognises that these pilots were conducted on a small scale within a controlled environment. Therefore, further investigation and evaluation would be required to determine if these benefits can be realised at a larger scale in real-life applications.\n\ne-HKD Pilot Programme Phase 1 Report\n\nThe HKMA launched Phase 2 of the e-HKD Pilot Programme in March 2024, inviting industry participants to submit innovative use cases for an e-HKD. Building on the success and experience of Phase 1, the next phase will delve deeper into select pilots from Phase 1 where an e-HKD could add unique value, namely programmability, tokenisation and atomic settlement, as well as explore new use cases that have not been covered in the previous phase.\n\nPhase 2 of the e-HKD Pilot Programme is expected to last until mid-2025 to provide participants sufficient time to test and evaluate their proposed use cases.\n\nApplication Process\n\nInterested organisations should complete the application form and submit it via email to the HKMA at cbdc@hkma.gov.hk with the subject “e-HKD Pilot Programme Phase 2 - Application ([Your Company Name])” on or before 17 May 2024. The completed form should be accompanied by relevant supplementary materials (e.g. project proposal, business plan, etc.) to substantiate your application. Organisations are welcome to submit multiple use cases.\n\nApplicants, including pilot participants of Phase 1, intending to submit use cases based on those explored in Phase 1 are strongly encouraged to outline in their submissions new insights they expect to attain in Phase 2. This could entail, for example, a deeper analysis into implementation issues that would be encountered in rolling out the use cases at scale.\n\nThe HKMA expects to hold interviews with selected applicants in May/June 2024. Further details will be communicated to the selected applicants in due course.\n\nAssessment Criteria for Use Cases\n\nSubmitted applications will be assessed according to the following criteria:\n\nForefront of innovation: The solution should showcase innovative elements and differ significantly from existing market offerings (such as a new business model, market, or version of an existing product);\n\nCustomer-centric: The solution should enhance the overall customer experience or solve their existing pain points and, preferably, should have received some level of market validation (e.g. through partnership with household names);\n\nReadily testable: The solution should allow for market testing with select group(s) of customers. Relevant risks should be identified with appropriate mitigating measures in place, and sufficient resources including capital and manpower should be committed;\n\nRegulation-compliant: The solution should be compliant with existing licensing requirements; and\n\nHong Kong-centric: The solution should maximise the potential use of an e-HKD."
