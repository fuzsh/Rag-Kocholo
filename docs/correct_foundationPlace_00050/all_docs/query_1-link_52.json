        "text": "The Dining Room by BluHouse provides the perfect backdrop for an exceptional and refined dining experience. Alongside your unforgettable Italian gastronomic journey, enjoy harmonious wine pairings chosen from our dedicated cellar, which houses more than 500 labels, exploring the viticultural diversity of Italy’s varietals and appellation, including exclusive vintages.\n\nSimplicity. Technique. Time. Flavour. Passion. Chef Giovanni learned all about the essence of Italian cuisine from his grandmother, who filled the house with the irresistible aroma of ragù every Sunday while he was growing up in Naples. Over the years, Chef Giovanni’s illustrious career has taken him to award-winning kitchens in Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Macau, and now, Hong Kong. Chef Giovanni is devoted to bringing people together over the authentic dishes and delicious wine that capture the spirit of his home country, creating casual and elevated Italian cuisines with only the best seasonal ingredients.\n\nInspired by the concept of a “business with purpose”, BluHouse is committed to co-creating neighbourhood resilience through donations, employment, and impactful experiences in support of underserved groups in the Tsim Sha Tsui neighbourhood. We are pledging 1% of our revenue towards this mission. Our social impact programme begins with Opportunity Employment which offers employment to members of underserved communities to close the opportunity gap. Our signature reusable BluCup reduces waste and supports donations to refugees and ethnic minorities served by NGO partners RUN Hong Kong and The Zubin Foundation. Our waste management and recycling programmes help develop a sustainable footprint for BluHouse. Together with our associates and our guests, we strive to build a better present and brighter future for the communities closest to home."
