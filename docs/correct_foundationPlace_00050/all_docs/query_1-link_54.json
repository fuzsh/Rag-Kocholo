        "text": "Samsung Solve for Tomorrow aims to encourage the youth to leverage their STREAM (Science, Technology, Research, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) skills and creativity to address pressing social issues and provide them with unique learning opportunities. Students who participate in this program will learn how to develop and implement innovative solutions to solve challenges faced by their communities. Throughout this journey, our STREAM experts will provide students with comprehensive guidance on technical skills and creative thinking, communication, and collaboration skills that are crucial for our future leaders.\n\nSamsung Solve for Tomorrow comprises three levels of problem-solving: restatement, ideation, and actualization. In the problem-solving phase, students will define and solve issues based on their in-depth understanding of target users. First launched in the U.S. in 2010, Solve for Tomorrow now has footprints in 23 countries across the globe. In 2013, Samsung introduced Solve for Tomorrow in Hong Kong and since then has inspired tens of thousands of students to develop solutions that help solve a wide range of social issues.\n\nSamsung believes that STREAM, problem-solving, creative thinking, communication, and collaboration are vital skill sets for students to thrive in an ever-changing world. At the same time, Samsung hopes to gather youngsters around the globe to apply their knowledge, skills, unlimited creativity, and enthusiasm for new technologies to build innovative solutions to social issues that impact their communities. Samsung hopes to cultivate the thought leaders of tomorrow, equipping them with both technical knowledge and the empathy to use that knowledge for those in need.\n\nThe theme for this year is “1maginati0n that Creates our Sustainable Future”. Students are free to choose their areas of expertise and focus on different local social issues. They are encouraged to apply their STREAM knowledge to design an innovative solution for their ideal Hong Kong.\n\nThe concept of sustainable development first emerged in the 1960s and was used by environmentalists to call for concerted efforts from the global community towards striking a balance between these three core areas: economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection. In 2015, United Nations initiated 17 Sustainable Development Goals to create a better world over the next 15 years by fighting climate change through building sustainable cities and communities and popularizing the use of clean and affordable energy.\n\nSamsung aims to enhance public awareness of the Sustainable Development Goals through this competition, emphasizing that sustainability goes beyond environmental protection and encompasses various areas that contribute to societal development. By doing so, Samsung strives to make a positive impact on global issues. Samsung believes this will encourage our future generation to develop a deeper understanding of their home while generating ideas addressing the most pressing social issues. Solve For Tomorrow 2023 is an opportunity for young Hong Kong talents to explore possibilities and contribute to building the sustainable future.\n\nThe Solve for Tomorrow competition welcomes entries from all Hong Kong primary and secondary school students. They must form teams to participate, and each team should ideally comprise three to five students from the same school. There are no restrictions on the number of teams the primary and secondary schools can enter. We encourage students from different classes and disciplines to form teams for the competition.\n\nParticipating teams are free to choose their area of expertise and address diverse social issues in line with the theme “1maginati0n that Creates our Sustainable Future.” They are encouraged to design an innovative and implementable solution by applying their knowledge in technology and other areas of STREAM.\n\nTeams are required to submit a PowerPoint proposal and a presentation video. In addition, secondary school participants must submit an Android app or a prototype to demonstrate their solutions along with the PowerPoint proposal and presentation video. We also encourage teams from the primary schools to present their concepts in formats that bring their ideas to life.\n\nFrom 2020, the Samsung Solve for Tomorrow competition has included STREAM workshops for participating students to learn design thinking, modular design, programming languages, collaboration and communication skills, as well as video filming. This helps students develop their work for the competition and prepares them for future R&D and problem-solving opportunities.\n\nIn 2023, we are dividing the modular design and programming language workshops into two levels, beginner and advanced, to accommodate students of different proficiency levels and enhance their STREAM knowledge.\n\n2022\n\nThe theme for this year is “Innovate for a Better Hong Kong”. Students are free to choose their areas of expertise and focus on different local social issues. They are encouraged to apply their STREAM knowledge to design an innovative solution for their ideal Hong Kong. Samsung believes this will encourage our future generation to develop a deeper understanding of their home while generating ideas addressing the most pressing social issues. Solve For Tomorrow 2022 is an opportunity for young Hong Kong talents to explore possibilities and contribute to building the Hong Kong they envision.\n\nSt. Stephen's Girls' College – Smart Packaging (智盒惜) won the championship in the Secondary Category\n\nYing Wa Primary School - Enkindle won the championship in the Primary Category.\n\n2021\n\nWith the theme “Innovate for a Better World,” this was the first time Samsung Solve for Tomorrow has included four social issues in the topic. These issues included sustainable development, fun learning, age-friendly technology, and public health. This provided opportunities for students to show their care for a broader range of social issues while encouraging them to shine in their areas of expertise.\n\nSt. Teresa Secondary School won the championship in the Secondary category with their AI technology-based Smart Companion Robot for the Elderly (AI腦友Jinn).\n\nKwong Ming School won the championship in the Primary Category with their AI Shoes for the Elderly (AI伴你同行), which works with an all-rounded app.\n\n2020\n\nUnder the theme “Imagination that creates a greener future,” Samsung Solve for Tomorrow 2020 encouraged Hong Kong students to utilize their STREAM knowledge and insights to design solutions for promoting sustainable development. Students could realize the importance of adopting a green lifestyle and take Hong Kong one step further towards the \"smart green city\" aspiration by taking that first step themselves.\n\nSt. Stephen's Girls' College – Smart Recycling (智識回收) won the championship in the Secondary Category\n\nC.C.C Kei Wan Primary School (Aldrich Bay) - Smart energy-saving windows (智能節能玻璃窗) won the championship in the Primary Category.\n\n2019\n\nWith the theme “Imagination that Spurs Happiness,” Hong Kong students were encouraged to develop various human-centered innovative solutions that could help their peers alleviate mental health problems and allow those in need to receive diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible. The 2019 competition saw the largest number of participants from primary, secondary and tertiary students.\n\nThe University of Hong Kong - Pacific App won the championship in the Tertiary Category\n\nDiocesan Girls' School - AiAo won the championship in the Secondary Category\n\n2018\n\nUnder the theme “Imagination that Connects the World,” Solve for Tomorrow 2018 encouraged Hong Kong students to design innovative solutions or tools to address the needs of SEN students and the people surrounding them. The campaign received overwhelming support from primary, secondary and tertiary students and inspired record-breaking participation. Samsung went one step further to support the Champion team of the Secondary Category to advance their winning idea, ChiPuzzle, in AR. It was mass-produced, allowing even more SEN students to benefit.\n\nThe University of Hong Kong - Future Warriors won the championship in the Tertiary Category and the Creative Idea Award\n\nPak Kau College – Chinese Character Card Game AR won the championship in the Secondary Category"
