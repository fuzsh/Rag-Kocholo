        "text": "Our constant attention towards consumersâ needs is at the foundation\n\nof our company policy, inspired by maximum transparency and excellence in quality.\n\nOur loyalty towards consumers and their trust in our products through their everyday purchases are at the core of the long-lasting relationship we enjoy with them.\n\nOur company practices are based on mutual trust between colleagues and complete dedication and transparency towards the Group and all civil society stakeholders with whom we interact daily.\n\nBased on our respect for the principle of equality of treatment, we promote the professional and personal development of our human resources. This also reinforces our strong ties with the local communities in the territories where we operate.\n\nWe are committed to avoiding discrimination in our employment practices in all the companies of our Group, starting from the initial moment of recruitment. The primary goal of our employment strategy\n\nis to establish long-lasting relations inspired by the principles of professional growth and recognition of merit.\n\nWe guarantee our employees the freedom to belong to trade unions,\n\nand we recognise the role of unions in contractual matters.\n\nThe protection of human health and the respect for the environment is at the core of our operational practices. We manage our facilities by using sustainable resources, such as water, energy, and raw and other materials, including renewable resources. In addition, we strive to reduce our environmental impact in all forms, mainly by reducing emissions, eliminating waste and correctly managing waste products.\n\nWe support the protection of human dignity, as well as the absolute and unconditional respect of human rights, wherever the Ferrero Group companies operate.\n\nWe are determined to eliminate and prevent all forms of forced labour and child labour across our supply chains.\n\nOur communications with consumers, including advertising, respect the values of human dignity, family and children, in line with our moral and ethical principles. They are based on advising the proper use of our products and are inspired by promoting a healthy lifestyle.\n\nOur advocacy practices towards International, National and Local Institutions are based on solid scientific knowledge and are constantly inspired by intellectual and behavioural integrity and transparency.\n\nWe aim to create unique products, develop innovative research and production processes, and use our technologies. For us, the aspects that make this journey enjoyable are the passion for research, the desire to break down pre-existing paradigms and the exploration of new places far from the traditional fenced-in disciplines.\n\nWe apply consolidated quality and traceability procedures to preserve our raw materials' organoleptic and nutritional characteristics.\n\nA fundamental element of our success is carefully selecting the highest quality raw materials, sourced with full respect for a strict ethical code concerning their origin, harvesting and manufacturing.\n\nWithin the global context of growing attention to themes such as nutrition and physical activity, we focus our research strategy and our production investments on the creation of high-quality products, carefully developed in terms of their nutritional value and portioning so that they can be integrated into a balanced diet, with particular attention to the needs of children and families.\n\nThis entrepreneurship can be linked to the word âinitiativeâ, a value that in itself embodies the concepts of enterprise and entrepreneurship, that impulse to act on oneâs own initiative in order to maximise results.\n\nThe difference between a brilliant strategy and success lies in the ability to establish a clear vision, in being proactive with your investments, in being timely with your undertakings, in being excellent in your execution.\n\nThe Ferrero Group has seen such success because of its solid and deeply rooted culture of âlearning by doingâ. A crucial element of sustainability in Ferreroâs model is the accumulation of technical skills and knowledge of products, markets, and consumers over time that guide us from âcreating valueâ to strengthening the âvalue of creationâ.\n\nA great collective entity animated by a trust in progress and by the ability to envision a tomorrow that is better than today. This is because the world will always be conquered by those who desire success and affirmation, and those that have the determination to continuously seek excellence."
