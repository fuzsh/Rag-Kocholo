        "meta_description": "As one of the most densely populated places in the world, Hong Kong fared relatively well in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a very low number of cases and fatalities per capita. This was mostly due to the Hong Kong government, healthcare workers, and the general public’s institutional and individual memory after they successfully overcame the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003. However, while Hong Kong was well accustomed to measures such as wearing masks and social distancing, the cooperation of the Hong Kong public to government restrictions was highly affected by its local political context, especially after widespread anti-government protests began mid-2019. This brought the public’s trust in government to an all-time low, creating a political ‘new normal’, which underpinned how COVID-19 policies would be proposed, accepted, and implemented, if at all. To understand how science advice was offered and how public health decisions were made, this research investigates the evolution of Hong Kong’s science advisory mechanisms for public health from before SARS, after SARS, and during COVID-19 in 2020, including the roles of key organisations and departments, the establishment of new centres and committees, and the creation of workgroups and expert advisory panels. This paper compares and analyses the reasons behind these differences in science advisory mechanisms between SARS and COVID-19. The findings from this research reinforce the unquestionable need for robust science advisory structures and knowledgeable scientific experts to solve health-related crises, though more research is required to understand the ways in which science advice influences both policy decisions and public acceptance of these policies.",

        "text": "In the earliest days of 2020, news stories from Wuhan about an emerging virus outbreak sparked discussion and concern among the residents of Hong Kong (Leung and Chan, 2020). This viral outbreak coincided with a political outbreak characterised by large-scale protests and social division since June 2019 (McLaughlin, 2020). Wuhan, the epicentre of the disease known as COVID-19, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, was a short high-speed rail ride away from Hong Kong. By Chinese New Year, which was 3 weeks after the first confirmed cases, Wuhan and other parts of Mainland China were in lockdown, and it was clear that COVID-19 would disrupt daily life for the Hong Kong locals. As the threatening evolution from sporadic outbreaks to a widespread epidemic was appearing serious and imminent, both the government and the public were preparing to respond. By the third week of January, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region’s (HKSAR) government had activated its anti-epidemic response plans. Concurrently, the people of Hong Kong—who still had deep memories of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003—responded promptly and willingly with high rates of voluntary masking, hand-washing, social distancing, and the use of thermometers at the entrance of many public spaces (Chow, 2020). Despite the implementation of such containment strategies, the virus slipped through the borders and spread across continents to become a global pandemic.\n\nHong Kong’s initial strong performance for COVID-19\n\nMany local residents felt that the government had missed opportunities to make swifter and better decisions, such as the delayed decision to close the border with the neighbouring Mainland China (Wu, 2020). However, Hong Kong weathered 2020 as one of the better-performing territories, despite its status as Asia’s hub for international travel and trade (Yuen et al., 2021). As of 31 December 2020, Hong Kong had logged 8846 confirmed cases and 148 deaths, in a city of ~7.5 million people—1.37 million of whom were over 65, the age group with the highest mortality rate (Ritchie et al., 2022; see Supplementary Information Appendix 1 for case figures). Hong Kong had managed to keep the rate of infection low without ever resorting to full, formal lockdowns. Instead, the government had implemented a series of policies, including travel restrictions, testing and contact tracing, quarantines and isolations, school closures, restrictions on public gatherings and public activities (including dining hours), and mask-wearing mandates (Chan et al., 2021). Some of these policies were eagerly accepted, while others resulted in controversy, resistance, and non-compliance. Through it all, the government’s announcements were accompanied by advice and comments from a variety of advisory committees and scientific experts who make up Hong Kong’s science advisory system for COVID-19.\n\nSARS and its impact on Hong Kong\n\nHong Kong’s COVID-19 science advisory system and its pandemic responses should be understood with special consideration of two contextual perspectives: historical and political. The first case of SARS, a highly infectious and life-threatening viral respiratory disease, first appeared in Southern China in November 2002 and subsequently appeared in Hong Kong in February 2003 (World Health Organization, 2022). The virus caused patients to exhibit major clinical features such as persistent fever, malaise, chills, and dry cough (Hui et al., 2003), yet, clinicians had no experience in or effective treatment options to eliminating the virus beyond symptomatic relief and immunological support (Stockman et al., 2006). The virus spread beyond Mainland China and Hong Kong’s borders via international travels to 29 countries and territories, reaching Taiwan, Singapore, Canada and Australia, though most cases remained within Asia (Chan-Yeung and Xu, 2003). Owing to the virus’s short incubation period of 2–10 days and high case fatality rate of up to 12% (Sampathkumar et al., 2003)—characteristics that allowed for early detection and isolation and therefore the severance of community transmission chains—the SARS epidemic had largely subsided by June 2003 after bringing a total of 8096 cases and 774 deaths worldwide (World Health Organization, 2015), short of evolving into an out-of-control, fully fledged global pandemic like COVID-19.\n\nIn the wake of SARS crossing the borders into Hong Kong, local officials instituted a series of public health reforms, including the formation of the Center for Health Protection (CHP; Hospital Authority Ordinance, 1997). The CHP comprises a number of standing expert committees, and has been developing response plans and conducting cross-government drills, all designed to improve the ability of Hong Kong to respond to health emergencies, including novel epidemics and pandemics (Center for Health Protection, 2005). This system led by CHP was in place and activated early in 2020 in response to COVID-19. The population’s collective memory of SARS also positively impacted their understanding of and response to COVID-19; people were well accustomed to wearing masks, and public schools were experienced in closing for short periods in previous years with disruptive influenza outbreaks (Cowling et al., 2020). They had largely respected—and in some cases, enthusiastically embraced—mask-wearing, hand-washing, and other official and unofficial rules and norms to support social distancing and other preventative measures.\n\nThe second perspective to examine is the local political context and circumstances, which went on to determine the overall acceptance by and cooperation among the Hong Kong public, despite the pre-learned behaviours from SARS. In 1984, the Chinese and British governments signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration, an international treaty, which outlined the mutually agreed terms of the ‘handover’ of sovereignty from the United Kingdom to China in 1997. The Joint Declaration also declares the ‘one country, two systems’ principle, along with the Basic Law (Hong Kong’s constitutional document) both stipulating that Hong Kong’s economic system and social way of life would be unchanged for fifty years until 2047 (HKSAR Government, 2021a). The Basic Law designates a system of governance led by the Chief Executive and an Executive Council. Before the Chief Executive makes important policy decisions or introduces bills and budgets to the legislature, he or she shall consult the Executive Council—whose 32 members are appointed by the Chief Executive—except when adopting certain measures in emergencies. Separately, the Legislative Council (LegCo) is the elected law-making body, who, on top of law-making duties, debate, scrutinise, and vote on budgets and laws, including those proposed by the Chief Executive. The rest of HKSAR’s civil service conducts the administrative and executive functions of the government and employs 4.4 per cent of Hong Kong’s workforce (174,900 people), spanning 13 policy bureaux and 56 departments (HKSAR Government, 2021b).\n\nEver since the handover in 1997, Hong Kong people have regularly protested against various proposals to alter their freedoms and rights. A demonstration in 2003 protested the decline in freedom of speech (said to be limited by the enactment of the Article 23 of the Basic Law, which would create Hong Kong’s own national security law) and the ‘Occupy’ movement in 2014 protested the ‘brainwashing’ of values (said to be caused by a proposed”national education” system; Gunia, 2019). In June 2019, the Hong Kong government was due to pass the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019 (more commonly known as the “extradition bill”), which would allow extradition of criminals to Mainland China. This triggered widespread protests in fear that this bill would undermine judicial independence and violate the freedoms that Hong Kong had enjoyed thus far (BBC, 2019). At the height of the movement, almost two million people (~25% of Hong Kong’s population) reportedly marched on the streets (SCMP Reporters, 2019) calling for the withdrawal of the extradition bill, the implementation of universal suffrage, as promised in the Basic Law, and the stepping down of Chief Executive Carrie Lam, among other demands.\n\nAfter months of clashes with pro-Beijing government officials, legislators, and a hardline police force, trust in government hit an all-time low. A survey conducted in February 2020 by Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (2020) revealed that trust in the HKSAR government had fallen to 14%, while distrust in the government rose to an all-time high of 76%. The proposed bill itself, accompanied by the government’s strong responses to the protests, have caused extreme polarisation of political ideologies; one side continued to call for electoral reform and democratic rights, while the other supported the government and police in using authority to ensure economic and social stability (Shen and Yu, 2021). This months-long crisis, just months prior to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, had created a political ‘new normal’ for Hong Kong that involved record low levels of public trust in the government and the politicisation of policies that were relatively apolitical, and underpinned how COVID-19 policies would be proposed, implemented or accepted (Hartley and Jarvis, 2020). This later proved to be a challenge for the Hong Kong government when implementing more stringent and controversial anti-epidemic policies in the year 2020.\n\nMethodology\n\nThis research takes the form of an descriptive, in-depth case study that conducts comparative analysis of the two pandemics within one political context. The aim of such study is to draw parallels and contrasts in the policy responses, scientific advisory mechanisms, communications and management between the two pandemics, as experienced in Hong Kong. Some of the broad research questions include: How did Hong Kong’s experience of the SARS crisis fundamentally affect public health structures in preparation for future pandemics? Were the measures and structures in place during SARS and post-SARS sufficient for handling COVID-19? How, and why, was pandemic response different between SARS and COVID-19? Despite the expected opacity in the governmental decision-making processes that occur behind-the-scenes, the inclusion of a wide range of publicly available archival documents will paint a clear and complete picture of Hong Kong’s public health mechanisms, both in the past and in the present.\n\nThis single, historical case study provides an institutionally focused account of the differences and changes in policy response in Hong Kong between its two most prominent pandemics: SARS and COVID-19. It is based largely on an analysis of policy documents, government statistics, media accounts and academic literature. For SARS, brochures and documents that were self-published by various governmental departments were used to assess the purpose and functions of advisory structures (e.g., Center for Health Protection, 2005). Guidelines and checklists used to instruct operational stakeholders like policy decision makers, hospital managers, frontline health workers, and ‘cleansing’ operators, were used to appraise the resources and processes required to deliver the intended outputs and outcomes (e.g., HKSAR Government, 2003a). A review of the lessons learned from the SARS epidemics based on the academic literature already published that evaluated governmental response to SARS and made recommendations for future policy change (e.g., Lee, 2003; SARS Expert Committee, 2003a).\n\nThe source of the official archival documents for COVID-19, in contrast, was more centralised; due to the long-lasting nature of COVID-19 and a general increase in internet and digital media use, the relevant documents, notices, updates and guidance distributed by the government were accessible through a dedicated, one-stop “COVID-19 Thematic Website” launched and revamped in February 2020 (HKSAR Government, 2020h). This centralised website links to multiple other official departments’ and press conferences directories, such as Center for Health Protection and GovHK. Given the rise in the popular use of digital, mobile and social media for COVID-19 information dissemination (Bao et al., 2020), much of governmental communication to the press and the public were channelled through press conferences over live stream platforms (e.g., on Facebook, online TV channels), as well as updating the public on pandemic developments and case numbers via social media platforms (e.g., Instagram). Using these sources of information, this research was able to track, in real time, the government’s policy responses and any changes or updates to scientific advisory mechanisms, such as the appointment of scientific experts on vaccinations.\n\nScience advice during crises\n\nTheoretically, policy responses to pandemics can be seen as a response to an emerging crisis. From the literature of crisis management, a crisis can be defined as an event during which an urgent threat to the structures, core values and functions of a system—as perceived and experienced by a government, organisations, communities and the wider population—requires making vital decisions under conditions of time pressure and high uncertainty (Rosenthal and Kouzmin, 1997; Rosenthal et al., 2001; Boin and ‘t Hart, 2007). The “context of the disaster” can occasionally be defined and determined, too, by the mass media and its narratives (Rosenthal et al., 2001). While having a narrow, exclusionary definition of a ‘crisis’ is unproductive for theoretical development (Pursiainen, 2022), in reality, most would agree to characterise SARS and COVID-19 as a crisis requiring critical crisis management and crisis communication (Wodak, 2021). Definitionally, these pandemics threatened core values (e.g., safety, security, health, fairness), created a sense of urgency (e.g., due to the need to swiftly isolate the infected and stop transmission chains) and exhibited a high degree of uncertainty (e.g., in transmission, symptoms, treatment and mutated variants; ‘t Hart and Tummers (2019)). Specifically, the pandemics encompassed two types of crises using ‘t Hart’s (2014) typology: a situational crisis, where disruptive and unexpected incidents occur ‘out there’ (e.g., the virus spreading in the community, healthcare systems in burden), and an institutional crisis, where the problem lies in ineffective governments, inefficient organisations or politicised policies. While these types of crisis can exist in silo, each type of crisis can trigger the other type; for instance, an unaddressed situational crisis could ‘metastasise’ into a serious institutional crisis (Petridou et al., 2020).\n\nHow does crisis management materialise as a form of policymaking? Pandemic response can be viewed in the perspective of the crisis management cycle posited by Drennan et al. (2014). Prior to SARS or COVID-19, public health systems would be in the preparation phase, conducting simulations, training and contingency planning, based on past experiences. As a novel coronavirus emerges, the government and public health agencies would begin the response phase, mobilising operational resources to community workers and hospital managers and financial resources to hard-hit industries and low-income or disadvantaged communities. Drawing parallels to policy learning literature, crises open ‘policy windows’ (Kingdon, 1984) that provide opportunities for change and to overcome governmental inertia that often inhibits policy learning under ‘normal’ conditions (Stern, 1997). As the pandemic (or each wave) subsides, the multiple agencies can buy time in the recovery phase to debrief, rebuild, enquire and learn valuable lessons for future policymaking (Moynihan, 2008). With this, prevention efforts can take place, such as threat assessment and mitigation strategising, before embarking on preparatory work again.\n\nSpecific to the Hong Kong context, SARS triggered a strong crisis management cycle to begin at the response phase with little prior preparation, given how deadly, unprecedented and unexpected the epidemic was (Lee, 2003). After SARS, the recovery phase with adequate policy learning occurred for the ensuing months and years, with multiple independent reviews and scholarly evaluations (Lee, 2003). This recovery phase also consolidated the public’s vivid and emotional memories of SARS into lasting public health knowledge and health-seeking behaviours (Lau et al., 2005). The evaluations led to new prevention measures to be taken (detailed in our findings) that subsequently helped to prepare for the epidemics that followed, including avian flu and swine flu. These mild outbreaks occasionally triggered only a minor activation of the crisis management cycle—that is, until COVID-19 hit suddenly, triggering an unprecedented origination of the crisis management cycle once again. The lingering and less deadly nature of COVID-19 also bought scientists and policy-makers time for more hindsight evaluation, research, policy trial-and-error and foresight for supportive measures.\n\nUltimately, the effectiveness of the relevant policy responses depends largely on whether crisis leadership was exerted; that is, did those with crisis management responsibilities fulfil all the expected and required tasks to facilitate an effective response? Some of these key tasks inherent in successful crisis leadership were characterised by Boin et al. (2013) as sensemaking of the nature of the crisis (the pandemic), orchestrating coordination among organisations (governmental departments and public health agencies), communicating with citizens and cooperative organisations (via the media, appointed experts and industry associations) and honing their own capacity to learn from failure (gathering feedback from social distancing measures). Interestingly, counter to conventional wisdom that crisis management problems arise from poor inter-agency communication and coordination (Quarantelli, 1988), scholars also suggest that such inter-agency tensions may yield positive outcomes, such as counteracting ‘groupthink tendencies’ and promoting openness (Rosenthal et al., 1991). Under the lens of crisis management, the case of Hong Kong’s pandemic response for SARS and COVID-19 will shine a light on the role of crisis experience on policy decision making.\n\nThis research focuses on key theoretical contributions pertaining to the role of institutional science advice and scientific experts in crisis management. One core feature of pandemic crises that differs from other crises (like financial crises or conflict), is that policy decisions are led by scientific evidence on the viral threat and up-to-date knowledge in public health. Politicians, policy-makers and economists, alone, do not have sufficient knowledge nor capability to reliably understand or make judgements or decisions on science-based policies, e.g., those related to epidemiology or vaccine risks and efficacy. The findings from this research reinforce the unquestionable need for robust science advisory structures and knowledgeable scientific experts to solve health-related crises, tackling both the situational aspect of the crisis, as well as preventing the institutional aspect. This paper outlines the evolution of Hong Kong’s science advisory structures and use of experts over time in response to two major pandemics, and how pandemic crisis management has resulted in temporary and/or permanent changes to Hong Kong’s public health structures and policymaking.\n\nIn this paper, we will analyse in depth the structures and approaches taken by the Hong Kong government and scientific advisors in response to COVID-19 in the year 2020. Section ‘Hong Kong’s science advisory mechanism for public health during the SARS era’ provides a summary of the science advice mechanisms that were in place during SARS, as a starting point for understanding the emergence of the more recent structures operating in 2020. Section ‘Hong Kong’s science advisory mechanism in the post-SARS and pre-Covid era’ describes the system that was developed in the wake of SARS, and which was operating at the end of 2019 and the start of 2020, when COVID-19 first began to present itself as a problem for Hong Kong. Section ‘Hong Kong’s science advisory mechanism during the COVID-19 pandemic’ focuses on the science advice structure during COVID-19’s onset in 2020, which was largely based on the initial structure in place, but with some changes in response to the unfolding pandemic. Section ‘Comparison between the responses to SARS and COVID-19 and related science advisory mechanisms’ compares the differences between the responses to SARS and responses to COVID-19. Section ‘Analysis of the differences between scientific advisory mechanisms for SARS and COVID-19’ analyses the various differences in the science advisory structures during the two pandemics.\n\nIn swift response to the emergence of COVID-19, on 4 January 2020, the HKSAR government launched the Preparedness and Response Plan for Novel Infectious Disease of Public Health Significance (“the Plan”; HKSAR Government, 2020c). The Plan lists out the strategies and government structures that would be implemented in the case of an outbreak of a novel infectious disease. The Plan also details a three-tier response system with different guidelines, protocols and resource coordination corresponding to the tier; along with launching the Plan, the government activated the’serious’ response level, the middle tier between ‘alert’ and ‘emergency’. The six areas to be addressed during an outbreak include: enhancing mechanism and organisational structure to tackle disease; strengthening immigration control; minimising risks of virus infection and spreading in local community; enhancing personal hygiene of the public; improving anti-epidemic facilities and services; and allocating sufficient resources for the strategies and measures (HKSAR Government, 2020b).\n\nIn accordance to the Plan, a steering committee and command centre were created and led by the Chief Executive to devise relevant strategies and measures in response to the developments of COVID-19 in the shortest amount of time (HKSAR Government, 2020e; see Supplementary Information Appendix 4 for core members). Under the steering committee and command centre, four formal workgroups operate with their roles as follows (see Fig. 5):\n\nThe Workgroup on Disease Prevention and Control, led by the Secretary for Food and Health, is responsible for formulating strategies to manage infection cases and maintaining close liaison with relevant departments in Mainland China and WHO.\n\nThe Workgroup on Responses and Actions, led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, coordinates the responses and efforts of various departments in fighting the outbreak.\n\nThe Workgroup on Public Participation, led by the Secretary for Home Affairs, encourages the community to take part in activities and behaviours to tackle the virus.\n\nThe Workgroup on Communications led by the Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, ensures that the most updated and accurate information is conveyed to all members of the public and stakeholders swiftly and effectively.\n\nIf the response level is raised to the ‘emergency’ level, the steering committee could invite other senior officers or non-government experts to participate in discussions. Moreover, new sub-committee groups could be formed to manage operational matters and make recommendations to the steering committee and representatives from the DH and HA. Members joining these sub-committees could be non-government experts from relevant bureaus and departments, invited by the Secretary for Food and Health as he or she sees fit. (HKSAR Government, 2020e).\n\nAfter the Plan’s response level was raised to ‘emergency’ on 25 January 2020, an informal expert advisory group was also announced to be set up under the steering committee and command centre, and consists of experts in various medical fields, including public health, infectious disease and respiratory medicine (HKSAR Government, 2020b). These experts were experienced in working closely with a wide range of stakeholders, including universities (as researchers and professors), healthcare workers (as physicians), international agencies (e.g., WHO, World Bank), as well as government officials (HKUMed, 2022). They were instrumental in dealing with previous outbreaks including SARS in 2003, Swine Flu in 2010 and MERS in 2012 (HKSAR Government, 2020e). The expert advisory group was appointed directly by the then Chief Executive Carrie Lam, and consists of:\n\nProfessor Keiji FUKUDA, Director and Clinical Professor of the School of Public Health at the University of Hong Kong, and former Assistant Director General of the WHO;\n\nProfessor David HUI, Professor of Respiratory Medicine and Director of Stanley Ho Centre for Emerging Infectious Diseases at the Chinese University of Hong Kong;\n\nProfessor Gabriel LEUNG, Dean of Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong and ex-Director of the Chief Executive’s Office;\n\nProfessor YUEN Kwok-yung, Chair of Infectious Diseases, Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nThe accomplishments of these scientists highlight the importance of past experience and the maintained reputation of these science advisors. For example, Yuen’s pivotal role in the successful discovery of the SARS coronavirus in 2002–2003 made him a go-to expert for understanding the virology of COVID-19 (HKUMed, 2018). Similarly, Hui’s experience as a frontline clinical investigator during SARS makes him a useful expert in understanding COVID-19’s clinical implications and its treatment and clinical management (Stanley Ho Centre for Emerging Infectious Diseases, 2021). As such, these experts’ scientific advice and opinions were highly accepted by the government and the public in the onset of the pandemic.\n\nThe multiple roles played by these experts as part of Hong Kong’s science advisory structures shine a light on the need for non-institutional science advice from individual experts. The credibility of these individual experts—whether they sit on scientific committees or informally appointed by the government—made them useful and effective in lending their knowledge, experience and, in some cases, their reputation, to advise the policy decision makers. Moreover, their scientific impartiality played a significant role as mediators between the government and the public amidst the ‘political new normal’ characterised by historically low public trust and high ideological polarisation (張嘉敏, 2020).\n\nIndeed, many of these individual experts have long-standing relationships with the government and civil service, and can serve to strengthen the viability of any science-led policies while being politically informed (HKUMed, 2022). For example, given Hong Kong’s political backdrop in 2020, the informally appointed expert panel inadvertently adopted ‘extrascientific’, and sometimes political, roles, such as educating the public and moderating their emotions through the media, becoming the spokesperson or scapegoat for the government, and even criticising the government’s policies publicly (Yahoo! News, 2020). The politicisation of these experts raises new questions regarding the solidity and nature of Hong Kong’s science advisory structures and how these may evolve into the future. Chief among these is whether the relationship between experts and government will remain opaque, and even more crucially, the degree to which experts are become more or less involved in public-facing ‘extrascientific’ roles. The composition, characteristics and capabilities of the experts form the backbone of the science advisory structures and, therefore, anchors the foundation for success of pandemic response.\n\nThe scientific advisory mechanism for COVID-19 vaccinations (late December 2020)\n\nOne of the seven scientific committees formed focuses on vaccine preventable diseases, as the CHP believes that vaccination is an important measure to protect the public from infectious diseases (Center for Health Protection, 2017). This committee scrutinises scientific evidence to provide recommendations and strategies on vaccine selection and distribution at the population level. Towards the end of 2020, the importance of vaccines in curbing COVID-19 had become increasingly apparent. Given the successful and expedient research and development of new vaccines targeting the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the Hong Kong government had created a temporary advisory panel on COVID-19 vaccines (HKSAR Government, 2020g). In their first meeting on 30 December 2020, the Chief Executive appointed experts from hospitals, universities and the DH onto the’Advisory Panel on COVID-19 Vaccinations’ (see Supplementary Information Appendix 5 for a list of experts, their fields and university affiliations). Notably, this panel comprises experts from many different medical fields, including epidemiology, paediatrics, geriatrics and pharmacology, among others, highlighting the multidisciplinary considerations of vaccine deployment while taking into account the special needs of various populations. Along with the panel, the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Zoonotic Diseases and the Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases both reviewed the latest global scientific evidence on epidemiology and published relevant data from overseas. This helped the panel prepare for the COVID-19 vaccination rollout that was expected to begin mid-February of 2021 (HKSAR Government, 2020a).\n\nEven though formal scientific advisory mechanisms and informal expert appointments were functionally in place, in reality, many policy proposals and decisions on public health measures were met with widespread criticism and reluctance amid Hong Kong’s ‘political new normal’ characterised by historically low public trust and political legitimacy (Hartley and Jarvis, 2020). For example, despite the rigorous advisory panel in place for evaluating the safety and efficacy of emerging vaccines, widespread vaccine hesitancy was observed in the population, posing as a direct challenge to top-down governmental structures and ambitions (Wang et al., 2021; Luk et al., 2021). Similarly, when the government launched its ‘Universal Community Testing Programme’ in late 2020 to test all of its 7.5 million citizens over a period of 2 weeks, only 1.78 million people (~24% of the population) participated (News.gov.hk, 2020). In such cases of public defiance, their statements indicate a trend towards government shifting the burden of public communications to the informally appointed scientific experts, who seemingly had more public trust than government officials did at the time. These challenges highlight the importance of public acceptance and trust as mediating factors for successful anti-epidemic policy implementation despite the existence of robust advisory mechanisms and credible experts.\n\nOne of the fundamental reasons for the differences between the scientific advisory mechanisms during SARS and COVID-19 was the contrast in virology and epidemiology of the SARS and COVID-19 viruses and epidemics (Petrosillo et al., 2020). Owing to the SARS virus’s rapid onset and high severity of symptoms, immediate hospital admission and close monitoring of patients were required as soon as they were diagnosed (Anderson et al., 2004). This meant that decisions and protocols were largely led by specialists in medicine, especially in respiratory and critical care medicine. HA, together with the public hospitals it managed, formed the main network for SARS response. In addition, the SARS epidemic was characterised by numerous episodes of cluster infections caused by one or a few “super-spreaders”, and therefore the main strategy for controlling the epidemic was largely based on identifying and isolating the “super-spreaders” and their close contacts (Dye and Gay, 2003; Galvani and May, 2005). Thus, during the SARS epidemic, science advice was predominantly offered for public health and medical decisions, rather than for other aspects like the public’s social life or the economy.\n\nIn contrast, the virology and epidemiology of COVID-19 were significantly different from SARS. First, the first variants of the COVID-19 virus had a slower onset than SARS, with an 80% milder disease rate, meaning that most patients exhibited mild, or even no symptoms (Liu et al., 2020). Additionally, although there were few “super-spreaders,” the social activities of large numbers of infected, but asymptomatic, individuals tended to increase the scale of cluster infections geometrically (Lakdawala and Menachery, 2021). Here, the focus of governmental response was not confined only to the medical field: Having assumed that this less deadly, but more infectious, virus would persist for a long period of time, the government focused more resources on testing capacity, vaccine application and everyday epidemic prevention, such as capacity enhancement for the treatment of mild patients, control of individual movement and social activities, and travel and immigration controls (Hale et al., 2022). This demonstrates an important ability to adapt crisis plans to the particulars of the disease driving the pandemic, as opposed to being stuck responding as if to the earlier crisis.\n\nDuring SARS, the lack of established governmental organisations had slowed down the exchange of epidemiological information between health authorities in Mainland China and Hong Kong (Lee, 2003), and subsequently the speed of implementing the strategies designed to protect frontline healthcare workers who were most at risk. The SARS epidemic triggered the creation of the CHP by the DH, and one of the key subsequent developments was the regional coordination between the local Hong Kong and national Mainland healthcare systems: In October 2005, Hong Kong, Macau and Mainland China signed a joint “Agreement on emergency response mechanism for public health emergencies” (the “Cooperation Agreement”), which sought to strengthen the cross-border links between the three health care systems (HKSAR Government, 2005b). This agreement was signed as the trio of governments anticipated that rapid globalisation would lead to public health crises spreading across borders in the future. This agreement intended to speed up the coordination and mobilisation of manpower, techniques and resources between experts from the three places, and expedite the creation of joint crisis response teams to devise response strategies for situations like the Swine Flu in Sichuan or SARS (Center for Health Protection, 2009b). This agreement had also made cross-border initiatives easier, including the transfer of Hong Kong residents from Wuhan to Hong Kong in 2020 and allowing Hong Kong residents in Shenzhen to obtain medicines from Chinese hospitals. The maintenance of an open line of communication vertically between various leadership and operational levels and horizontally between different territories remains an important element to achieve swift pandemic response coordination and avoid an institutional crisis during any future pandemics.\n\nTechnology has advanced considerably between 2003 and 2020, and the Innovation and Technology Bureau took advantage of the widespread use of the internet to disseminate information, announcements and guidance to the public swiftly, as well as tracing close contacts with mobile applications and distributing copper-lined reusable face masks for each Hong Kong citizen for free (Innovation and Technology Bureau, 2020). For example, in 2020, for a temporary hospital built within one of Hong Kong’s convention centres called AsiaWorld-Expo, HA created an e-health system to enable COVID-19 patients to self-monitor and transmit vital signs to health monitors through a mobile app. This reduced unnecessary social interactions and ensured potential transmissions to be identified and isolated swiftly (HKSAR Government, 2020d). The indisputable value of technological innovations in pandemic mitigation and therapeutics (e.g., vaccinations, rapid testing, and clinical drugs) calls for increased governmental and private investments in such technologies, in preparation for future pandemics and public health challenges (Neville and Kuchler, 2022).\n\nWhile pandemic response for COVID-19 had certainly benefited from lessons learned during SARS, these initial benefits eventually faced new emerging challenges. Moving into 2021 and 2022, vaccination hesitancy—due to the persisting low trust in government, and by proxy, low trust in scientific experts—continued to dampen vaccination rates, particularly among the elderly population who eventually fell most victim to Hong Kong’s deadly fifth wave in early 2022 (Cheung et al., 2022). Increasingly opaque decision-making, unpredictable policy directions and frequent policy U-turns continued to frustrate numerous segments of the population with stringent policies such as school closures, tight social distancing measures and travel restrictions (Ho, 2022). During its fifth wave, which was driven by the milder but much more transmissible Omicron variant, Hong Kong’s public health institutions and hospitals were overwhelmed and pushed to its limits when it logged the world’s highest number of deaths per population, as mortuaries became full and deceased bodies were placed in refrigerated freight containers and inside hospital wards next to inpatients. (Taylor, 2022; Cheng, 2022). As the situational and institutional crises unfolded rapidly in real-time, Hong Kong sought scientific advice and operational assistance from Mainland China, who sent down hundreds of volunteer medics, built temporary quarantine facilities, donated millions of traditional Chinese medicine packets as treatment and appointed a new team of mainland experts (McGregor, 2022). Having fortunately ridden this turbulent wave, which lasted 3 months, Hong Kong faces yet another major institutional quandary. Will Hong Kong comply with China’s insistent national ‘zero-COVID policy’, or will it digress from the central government’s strategy, ‘live with COVID’ and prepare for a full revitalisation of its economy (Dyer, 2022)? More specifically, will Hong Kong’s recent ‘failures’ during the fifth wave discredit its own science advisory structures and experts’ credibility, and eventually compel the local government to embrace a public health system that is much more unified with the central government?"
