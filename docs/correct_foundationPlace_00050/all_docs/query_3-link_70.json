In the early 1920s, Virginia formed a Future Farmers club for boys in agriculture classes. This innovation caught fire across the country, and the national organization was established in 1928 at the Baltimore Hotel in Kansas City, Mo. National dues to the Future Farmers of America were set at 10 cents per member.",

        "text": "- 1917 – Smith Hughes Act\n\nThe advancement in agricultural education since the Smith – Hughes Act has bettered the quality of life not just for America’s rural and farm families but for everyone across the globe who is fed and clothed by the American Farmer. As with every great journey, it started with that first step. 2017 was the centennial celebration of the Smith – Hughes Act, America’s first step in transforming education.\n\n- 1925\n\nVirginia Tech agricultural education teacher educators Henry Groseclose, Harry Sanders, Walter S. Newman and Edmund C. Magill organized the Future Farmers of Virginia for boys in agriculture classes. The FFV served as the model for the Future Farmers of America.\n\n- 1927\n\nH.O. Sargent, a federal agent for agricultural education for African Americans at the U.S. Office of Education, and G.W. Owens, a teacher-trainer at Virginia State College, write the first constitution and bylaws for the New Farmers of Virginia, an organization for African-American agriculture students. The organization holds its first state rally that same year.\n\n- 1928\n\nFuture Farmers of America is established in Kansas City, Mo., on Nov. 20. First National FFA Convention is held in Kansas City, Mo.: 33 delegates from 18 states are in attendance. Leslie Applegate from New Jersey is elected first national FFA president. First sectional gathering of New Farmers of America (NFA) members is held.\n\n- 1929\n\nNational blue and corn gold are adopted as official FFA colors. Carlton Patton from Arkansas is named the first Star Farmer of America. This is one of the first awards created by FFA, and it was sponsored until 1949 by the Kansas City Star. First National Chapter Contest is launched and sponsored by Farm Journal magazine. At the Second National FFA Convention in November, 33 states are represented by 64 delegates. Thirty-five state associations with approximately 1,500 chapters and 30,000 members are affiliated with the national organization.\n\n- 1930\n\nOfficial FFA Creed, written by E.M. Tiffany, is adopted. Edward Drace from Missouri wins the first National Public Speaking event. First Official Dress uniform is adopted: dark blue shirt, blue or white pants, blue cap and yellow tie. Delegates restrict FFA membership to boys only.\n\n- 1933\n\nBlue corduroy jacket is adopted as Official Dress. A group of FFA officers and members make a pilgrimage to Washington, D.C., where they are greeted on the White House lawn by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\n- 1939\n\n28.5 acres of land is purchased near Alexandria, Va., for the first FFA-owned national headquarters; the land was once part of George Washington’s estate. Identical twins Albert and Arthur Lacy from Hondo, Texas, become the only members ever to share the title of Star Farmer of America. The H.O. Sargent Trophy Award is created to honor H.O. Sargent’s commitment to helping NFA members achieve success and leadership in agriculture.\n\n- 1942\n\nFFA members join in the war effort. Three former FFA members—Robert Gray from Texas, Travis Hoover from California and Melvin Jordan from Oklahoma—serve with then Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle and participate in the famous air raid on Tokyo. During World War II, delegates revise FFA membership rules so time served in the armed forces will not count in determining a member’s period of eligibility. During the war years, national conventions are streamlined events, attended only by delegates and award winners. In 1942, just 217 people attend the convention."
