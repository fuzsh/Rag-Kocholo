        "text": "Dear Friends,\n\nThank you for your kind interest in child health and welcome to the Webpage of the Hong Kong Paediatric Foundation! Hong Kong Paediatric Foundation is a charitable organization wholly owned by the Hong Kong Paediatric Society. It was established in 1994 by child health professionals from intersectoral domains and community celebrities for promotion of child health and child advocacy through public education.\n\nAt the Hong Kong Paediatric Foundation we believe that children represent 18% of our community but do represent 100% of our future. They are the best asset of our community and we strongly believe in the concept of \"healthy children for a healthy world\". We are all committed to child health.\n\nModern definition of child health evolves over the past six decades from \"a state of freedom from diseases\" to the most up-to-date target of \"enhancement of attainment of one's potential in life\". The child here includes the age ranges from 0-18 years (representing newborn, childhood and adolescent groups) and health covers the medical, social and educational sectors. It thus follows that the professional team taking care of child health should be transdisciplinary and intersectoral comprising of doctors, nurses, midwives, allied health professionals, teachers, social workers, parents and others. An effective healthcare team demands a good coordinator to bring the team into harmonious function and to realize the best health effect on the children we serve.\n\nWe are proud to present to you this newly revamped website commissioned for health education, child protection and child advocacy and aim at providing the most up-to-date information on child health from clinical, research and parent practice to the most recent research data and survey on local child health statistics. We attempt to provide factual, normative, educational, evidence-based, practice-based and government policies on child health as well as guidelines to the public in a responsible, transparent, accountable and professional manner. The design of this web is meant to be user-friendly, bilateral and interactive and we sincerely hope that the web will serve as a platform to provide health education to all social classes in the community pursuing our ultimate goal of creating an optimum environment for our children to grow and develop.\n\nI wish you best of health and let us work together for better child health in Hong Kong!\n\nFor and on behalf of the Hong Kong Paediatric Foundation"
