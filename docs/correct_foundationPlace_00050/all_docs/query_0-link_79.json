        "text": "THE POLICE\n\nThe Hong Kong Police Force has distinguished itself as one of the oldest, yet most modern, police forces in the world.\n\nFormed in 1844, the Force evolved from an extremely broad-based role, embracing such matters as fire-fighting, prisons and immigration, to that of a traditional police service. As at June 30, 2023, the Force has a strength of 27 185, of which 18 per cent are female officers. It also has 4 066 civilian staff.\n\nThe Hong Kong Auxiliary Police Force (HKAPF) was originally formed in 1914 as a reserve to assist in times of natural disaster or civil emergency. As at June 30, 2023, the HKAPF comprises 3 203 volunteer citizens. The role of the Auxiliary Police has changed over time to keep pace with the changing environment. It is now a trained manpower reserve in support of the regular Force and is deployed in accordance with prevailing operational priorities as determined by the Commissioner of Police.\n\nThe Force is dedicated to safeguarding national security, protecting life and property, preventing and detecting crime, and maintaining law and order in the society. The Force always endeavours to enlist community support and maintain public confidence in the Force, with a view to ensuring Hong Kong remains one of the safest and most stable societies in the world.\n\nStructure: The Force is commanded by the Commissioner of Police who is assisted by three Deputy Commissioners.\n\nOne Deputy Commissioner supervises all operational matters and one is responsible for the direction and co- ordination of the management of the Force, including personnel, training and management services. The third one is tasked with safeguarding national security.\n\nThe Force Headquarters is made up of six departments: Operations; Crime and Security; Personnel and Training; Management Services; Finance, Administration and Planning; and National Security. For daily policing, the whole Hong Kong territory is delineated into six Police Regions, namely Hong Kong Island, Kowloon East, Kowloon West, New Territories North, New Territories South and Marine. Respective Regional Headquarters comprise different Formations including criminal investigation, operations, administration and traffic (except Marine Region). Each Region also consists of several Districts where District Commanders are responsible for overseeing local policing issues. For law and order in the railway system, which runs across the territory, is vested with the Railway District under the command of Kowloon East Region.\n\nThe Marine Police, with a fleet of over 100police crafts, patrols some 1 641 km2 of waters within Hong Kong and 261 outlying islands. By adopting technologically advanced coastal security and radar systems and deploying high performance crafts, the Marine Police delivers effective and high quality services to the whole seafaring community in the territory. The Marine Police is also responsible for maintaining law and order within Hong Kong waters, including interdicting illegal immigration and cracking down on smuggling activities, conducting search and rescue operations, and engaging the seafaring community to enhance sea safety. The Marine Police also assists the Director of Marine in conducting security audits for the 37 International Shipping and Port Security facilities to effectively respond to terrorism or major maritime incidents. The Police fleet is currently undergoing an over $4 billion-worth of modernisation programme that includes the adoption of Marine Situational Awareness System to enhance co-ordination.\n\nOperations: The Operations Department, comprising Operations Wing, Support Wing, Public Relations (PR) Wing and six Police Regions, is responsible for different operational matters.\n\nOperations Wing is the Force policy holder of various operational issues including counter-terrorism, internal security, boundary security, bomb disposal, management of major events/ incidents, etc.\n\nFor Police Tactical Unit (PTU), the Force has a total of seven established companies and two training companies, providing essential manpower to perform crowd management duties during major events and respond to any emergency, alongside performing daily anti-crime operations and management of public events in Regions. PTU companies would also join with other units to form the Regional Response Contingents to provide rapid and effective response to major operations, large-scale public disorder situation and other emergencies. The PTU Headquarters is responsible for providing training on internal security, crowd management, major incident handling, etc., within the Force.\n\nSupport Wing oversees the Support Branch and Traffic Branch Headquarters (TBHQ).\n\nThe Support Branch is responsible for the formulation and execution of policies in relation to operational support and occupational safety and health for both the regular and auxiliary Forces. It is also responsible for various licensing functions of the Force and offering assistance to other relevant licensing authorities.\n\nThe TBHQ is responsible for formulating Force priorities, policies and procedures on traffic matters, co-ordinating their implementation and monitoring their effects. It processes all traffic prosecutions and collects and maintains traffic-related data. The TBHQ offers advice on traffic management matters and monitors local traffic schemes. It also formulates, supports and monitors road safety educational and enforcement programmes. Moreover, management of the Force fleet of over 2 800 vehicles and the driver cadre are also under its purview.\n\nThe PR Wing plays an important role in enlisting public support in maintaining law and order by engaging the community, leveraging technologies and social media platforms, as well as working in partnership with the media to foster good relations with all sections of the community. Information about police activities is disseminated to local and overseas media round the clock.\n\nInter-departmental Counter Terrorism Unit (ICTU) was set up in April 2018, comprising members from six law enforcement agencies, namely Customs and Excise Department, Correctional Services Department, Fire Services Department, Government Flying Service, Hong Kong Police Force and Immigration Department. ICTU is responsible for monitoring and analysing global terrorism trends and rendering strategic recommendations to the Secretary for Security on CT-related matters. ICTU also provides an inter-departmental platform to enhance coordination and analysis of CT intelligence amongst member departments. To foster closer liaison and smoother collaboration among relevant departments, ICTU also organises inter-departmental CT exercise and training, and promotes CT awareness through public education. ICTU manages the CT Reporting Hotline 63-666-999, which serves to encourage the public to provide terrorism or violence related information and promote the theme of ‘Spot and Report’ and ‘Whole-of-Community’ approach in CT. Those who have provided crucial information may get reward money under the existing reward mechanism.\n\nWhilst daily patrol and anti-crime duties are covered by Patrol Sub-units and Emergency Units, respective Regional Command and Control Centres (RCCCs) are responsible for the coordination and deployment of Police resources within Regions.

It collaborates closely with the Mainland and international law enforcement agencies on the exchange of intelligence and investigation requests in relation to relevant cross-jurisdictional crimes. It also adopts a strategic approach by engaging different sectors of the community through the enhanced use of social media and multi-agency co-operations on scam prevention initiatives. In May 2017, the Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce was established in collaboration with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Hong Kong Association of Banks and a number of local banks to enhance detection, prevention and disruption of serious financial crimes and money laundering threats in Hong Kong through regular meetings and intelligence exchange. To step up combat actions against deception and raise public awareness of various scams, the Anti-Deception Coordination Centre was set up in July in the same year to provide round-the-clock instant advisory services for the general public.\n\nThe number of technology crimes and cyber security incidents has continued to rise in recent years. The Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau (CSTCB) has been dedicated to further strengthen the Force’s capabilities in key areas including operations, digital forensics, training, intelligence and research to effectively combat technology crimes and safeguard the cyber security of Hong Kong. The Cyber Security Centre under the CSTCB provides round-the-clock cyber security protection for critical infrastructures in the sectors of government, banking and finance, transportation, communications and public utilities. CSTCB has also established the Cyber Range, which provides a safe and controlled virtual environment for training police officers and other cyber security practitioners.

The Crime Support Group also represents the Force in liaising with the Forensic Pathology Service of the Department of Health and the Forensic Science Division of the Government Laboratory.\n\nThe Crime Statistics Office under the Crime Wing Headquarters is responsible for collating and analysing crime statistics, and distributing relevant information to different units for their monitoring of the overall and specific crime trends and formulation of corresponding crime combating and prevention strategies. In addition, the Crime Wing Headquarters also works closely with the Security Bureau in formulating related policies and responding to relevant enquiries.\n\nPersonnel and Training: The Personnel Wing (P Wing) is responsible for all core human resources management functions, including recruitment, promotion, career development, conditions of service, discipline, staff relations and welfare matters.\n\nPeople are the most valuable asset of the Force. To attract candidates of a high caliber to join the Force, the Recruitment Division of P Wing organises recruitment and publicity events of different nature, which include the Education & Careers Expo, Police Recruitment Days and careers talks. Between May 2021 and June 2023, the Recruitment Division held six Recruitment Experience & Assessment Days that combined recruitment and experiential elements, introducing police work and recruitment information to the general public through an interactive way. Participants could also make applications on-site.\n\nThe Recruitment Division launches different youth engagement projects, such as the Police Mentorship Programme, Police Mentorship Programme (Outreach), Project ACHIEVE, Auxiliary Undergraduate Scheme, and Sportsmen’s Programme for Recruitment, Experience and Development, to provide young people with the opportunity to meet serving police officers and understand the diversified nature of police work. The Police Mentorship Programme and the Police Mentorship Programme (Outreach) have been amalgamated into one Police Mentorship Programme in 2022/2023 with three streams, namely Police Mentorship Programme (Hong Kong), Police Mentorship Programme (Mainland), and Police Mentorship Programme (Overseas) for local Hong Kong students and those in the Mainland and overseas respectively, inspiring them to join the Force upon graduation.\n\nTo facilitate applications from university students, the Force organised a ‘Police University Recruitment Express – Hong Kong’ at 11 institutes across Hong Kong between September and October 2022. Students could apply on the spot for the positions of police constable, probationary inspector and auxiliary police constable, and undergo the selection process on campus as well. Serving officers who were alumni of the universities also shared their experiences with the students.\n\nTo recruit Hong Kong students living on the Mainland and facilitate the start of their police foundation training after graduation, the Force sent a delegation of Recruitment Division personnel, Police College instructors and Recruitment Spokespersons in 2022 and 2023 to conduct the ‘Hong Kong Police University Recruitment Express – Mainland’ on the Mainland by visiting Guangdong, Fujian, Beijing and Wuhan. The delegation dispensed recruitment information and selected candidates on-site.\n\nWith a view to encouraging serving officers to inspire those around them to join the Force, the Recruitment Division launches the Police Recruitment Buddies scheme. The scheme aims at encouraging serving officers to identify, inspire and encourage their family members and friends to make applications, attracting new blood for the Force. In addition, the Recruitment Division launches the Non-ethnic Chinese (NEC) Referral System, which refers NEC applicants who have yet to pass the recruitment selection process to join the engagement programmes organised by different Police Districts. It aims at better equipping the applicants for joining the Force by enhancing their confidence and competency.\n\nThe Recruitment Division regularly reviews the recruitment policy to attract high-calibre candidates. Starting from April 1 2022, the Hong Kong residency requirement for police constable, inspector, and auxiliary police constable, i.e. ‘has lived in Hong Kong for at least seven years’, has been removed. Applicants are only required to fulfil the criterion of being ‘a permanent resident of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region’. With effect from May 5 2023, the entry requirements for recruit police constable, probationary inspector and auxiliary police constable have been adjusted: (i) The minimum height and weight requirements were lifted to align with that of the other disciplined services; (ii) The requirement to undergo unaided visual acuity test was removed. An applicant who passes the test with the use of spectacles or contact lenses will be deemed to have met the required eyesight standard. The requirement for colour perception test remains unchanged; and (iii) The Recruit Police Constable Written Examination (Written Examination) was introduced to provide applicants with an alternative way to meet the language proficiency requirements. The Written Examination, comprised of elements of police work, was tailor-made for applicants of recruit police constable.

Five ‘Recruitment Spokespersons’ of different backgrounds were selected, and related recruitment videos and posters under the theme were also produced to enhance publicity.\n\nThe P Wing is at the forefront in the promotion of a healthy and a caring culture both within and beyond the Force. In 2023, the Force was awarded the 15 Years Plus Caring Organisation Logo from the Hong Kong Council of Social Service in recognition of its on-going commitment in caring for its employees, the community and the environment, and thereby demonstrating good corporate social responsibility.\n\nWith regards to community work, the Hong Kong Police Volunteer Services Corps, with its 23 police volunteer teams, provides over 23 000 hours of service to the community during the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022.\n\nThe Hong Kong Police College (HKPC) comprises headquarters and three schools, namely the School of Foundation Training, the School of Professional Development and the School of Specialised Learning. The HKPC is committed to equipping officers with the necessary attitude, knowledge and skills to serve Hong Kong with honor, duty and loyalty.\n\nThe School of Foundation Training provides recruit and professional training for trainees in capacity and mindset building to meet frontline operational needs. In 2020, the HKPC became the first non-tertiary education institution and government department in attaining the Programme Area Accreditation status, which entrusted the HKPC to internally accredit the Force’s courses in Law Enforcement and Security Studies Programme Area up to Qualifications Framework Level 5. Thus far, the HKPC has internally accredited/ re-accredited 18 Force’s programmes through robust Quality Assurance Mechanism and Internal Learning Programme Accreditation System.\n\nThe School of Professional Development fosters in-service learning and provides local, Mainland and overseas vocational, professional and executive training programmes on varied contemporary policing-related subjects by proactively seeking external collaborations with other law enforcement agencies, universities and institutions. Commencing in 2021, the HKPC and Tsinghua University have launched a 2.5-year part-time Executive Master of Public Administration Programme for police officers and other disciplinary services.
