        "text": "Richard M. Schulze\n\nRichard M. “Dick” Schulze is the founder of The Richard M. Schulze Family Foundation. He is also the founder and now chairman emeritus of Best Buy Co., Inc. — the world’s largest consumer-electronics retailer.\n\nDick was born and raised in St. Paul, Minnesota. From a modest background, he and a hand-picked team built the Best Buy retailing empire based in the Twin Cities. Dick continues to exhibit lifelong values of integrity, humility, honesty, and respect. His legacy will include major contributions to business, entrepreneurship education, and philanthropy.\n\nBest Buy\n\nDick’s career began as a manufacturer’s representative for electronics components. In 1966 he founded his own company, The Sound of Music. His new business expanded to six stores in Minnesota by 1983 and he renamed his company Best Buy. Best Buy soon went public with remarkable growth and introduced the superstore concept to the electronics industry!\n\nDick served as Best Buy’s Chief Executive Officer from 1983 to 2002.\n\nHe served as chairman of Best Buy until 2012.\n\nIn 2013, he rejoined Best Buy as Founder and Chairman Emeritus.\n\nToday, Best Buy employs more than 145,000 people.\n\nBest Buy operates more than 1,400 stores in the U.S. and 479 stores in Canada, China, and Mexico.\n\nDick continues to support Best Buy employees through:\n\na disaster relief program that is funded and managed by his Family Foundation, and\n\na partnership with Best Buy to finance The Best Buy Hope Fund, an emergency relief fund for Best Buy employees, which the Minneapolis Foundation manages.\n\nEntrepreneurship Education\n\nDick enrolled at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota but then joined the Air National Guard full-time. His plans to attend college never materialized. Still,\n\nhe became a trustee and major donor to St. Thomas;\n\nin 1998, St. Thomas awarded him an honorary doctoral degree (he also received an honorary doctorate from the University of Minnesota);\n\nDick and his late wife, Sandy, donated $50 million to St. Thomas in 2000 — at the time, the largest donation ever to a Minnesota college or university;\n\nin 2005, their donation founded the Schulze School of Entrepreneurship;\n\nthe Schulze School became a leader in entrepreneurship education and outreach; and\n\nhundreds of businesses have benefited from the school’s expertise, consulting, and start-up support.\n\nDick served on the St. Thomas board of trustees for 20 years. He retired from the board in 2015. He now serves as trustee emeritus.\n\nThe Richard M. Schulze Family Foundation\n\nSchulze has long supported nonprofit organizations in the Twin Cities and Minnesota. He and his late wife Sandy established the Richard M. and Sandra J. Schulze Family Fund in the mid-1990s. The fund became a vehicle for their donations to local social service charities. Sandy died in 2001 from mesothelioma, rare cancer caused by asbestos exposure.\n\nIn 2004, Dick started the Richard M. Schulze Family Foundation. He announced plans in June 2013 to give away $1 billion during his lifetime.
