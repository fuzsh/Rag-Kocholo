        "text": "Now more than ever, the American people need a champion to preserve the great American experiment and everything good and just that it represents.\n\nThat’s why The Heritage Foundation exists. We champion policy solutions that benefit all Americans. But Heritage is also much more than a think tank.\n\nEvery day, Heritage works in our nation’s capital to build an America where freedom, opportunity, prosperity, and civil society flourish.\n\nBut unlike so many other organizations in Washington, D.C., The Heritage Foundation’s focus isn’t on putting more power into the hands of government—it’s on returning power to the people.\n\nThat’s why we don’t work on behalf of any special interest or political party. Instead, our commitment is to the American people, and the more than 10 million members, advocates, and concerned Americans who support us.\n\n>>> Learn More: Why We Speak With One Voice\n\nHeritage’s world-renowned experts—deeply experienced in business, government, the military, nonprofits, academia, and communications—spend each day developing innovative solutions to the issues America faces. From empowering parents in education, reversing growing spending and inflation, and protecting the unborn, to securing America’s borders, countering the threat of Communist China, holding Big Tech accountable, and ensuring free and fair elections—Heritage is on the front lines in the fight to help Americans thrive.\n\nOur team then takes those solutions directly to decisionmakers in government, to turn ideas into action. Heritage has been consistently ranked the No. 1 think tank in the world for it.\n\nBut we don’t stop there. We also:\n\ncommunicate to citizens how government can work more effectively for all Americans, through traditional media and social media platforms;\n\nengage with the international community to promote freedom, peace, and trade that benefits America and the world;\n\ntrain the leaders of tomorrow who will lead America to a brighter future; and\n\nhelp unite the conservatives around principles and ideas that strengthen our cause … and the nation.\n\nRecognizing that elected leaders are more responsive to adopting policy solutions when they know the American people already support them, Heritage created Heritage Action for America. Heritage Action works with lawmakers to implement Heritage Foundation solutions while it also organizes nearly 20,000 Sentinel activists and more than 2 million local grassroots activists around the nation to push for their adoption. Heritage Action ensures that citizens are speaking up and their elected officials hear their voices.\n\nHeritage doesn’t do all of this alone, however. It’s only thanks to our 500,000 members that we have the ability to engage on all of these fronts in the fight to save America. In this fight, our members are truly our partners.\n\nThat’s why we invite you to stand with us—because there’s too much at stake to stand on the sidelines.\n\nIt’s only with your help that we can ensure America remains a land of flourishing opportunity and home of the freest, most prosperous people the world has ever known."
