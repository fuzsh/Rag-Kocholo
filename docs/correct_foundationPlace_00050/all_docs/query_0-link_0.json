        "text": "Upcoming\n\n◘ Talk by Krzysztof Sękowski (Warsaw):\n\nMethod of Cases, Conceptual Engineering, and Modal Skepticism\n\nIn the talk, I will present how adopting a conceptual engineering approach provides a way to rule out modal skepticism, which points out the lack of reliable methods for verifying modal statements through the so-called method of cases in response to the results of the negative program of experimental philosophy. As I will argue, understanding a significant part of philosophy, including metaphysics, as a normative inquiry aimed at revising concepts or conceptual frameworks, legitimizes the use of the method of cases. I will refer to the ‘mischaracterization objection,’ according to which our verdicts on hypothetical scenarios do not justify conclusions within the method of cases, but rather, that role is played by intuition-independent arguments. I will illustrate that the mischaracterization objection can indeed justify the method of cases, but doing so requires an additional argumentative step. This involves reinterpreting the method of cases as a method focused on providing normative, rather than descriptive, arguments regarding scrutinized concepts. By adopting this perspective, the method of cases becomes justifiable, offering reasons for imposing certain normative constraints on concept usage. I will show that many instances of the method of cases could be viewed through these normative lenses. Furthermore, I will explore how this approach can methodologically enrich conceptual engineering and discuss its metaphysical implications\n\nDate/time: 26th April, 9am, zoom\n\nPrevious:\n\n◘ Talk by David Plunkett (Dartmouth) and Tristram McPherson (Ohio) :\n\nConceptual Ethics and Investigation of “The Things Themselves”: The Case of Epistemic Inquiry\n\nDate/Time: Thursday, 9th November, 9pm HK.\n\nAbstract:\n\nMuch of contemporary epistemology aims to study such things as knowledge, justification, and understanding, rather than our thought and talk about those things. This reflects a widespread thought in contemporary philosophy (and, indeed, throughout much of the history of the field) that philosophical inquiry is concerned with object-level issues, rather than representational-level ones. How should epistemological inquiry with this aim connect to representational-level issues about our epistemic thought and talk? Much of the discussion on this topic has focused on descriptive issues about our thought and talk, such as what our words mean, or which concepts we employ. We here instead focus on normative issues in conceptual ethics, such as about which concepts we should employ, and what we should mean by our words. We argue that even if we embrace a fairly strong version of the idea that we should be inquiring into “reality itself”, there is still an important role for conceptual ethics within the methodology of epistemology. More specifically, we argue that if we take seriously what we call the “regulative role” of the epistemic, not only in telling us about what epistemic inquiry currently is, but also what it should be, then we should see inquiry into epistemic “things themselves” as at best a step in epistemic inquiry. Such inquiry is best combined with inquiry about the implications of the information about these things in themselves for the sorts of thought, talk, and practices that will best serve to regulate inquiry. And here, we claim, conceptual ethics inquiry is an indispensable part.\n\nOn zoom:\n\nhttps://us06web.zoom.us/j/84293436341?pwd=xbHiOqsRJhDRzIjtVc0HVIeItskl4X.1\n\n◘ Talk by Guido Löhr: Engineering concepts for the 21st century: Value Sensitive Design, Technology and Conceptual Disruption\n\nDate/Time: Thursday, 2nd March, 4pm HK.\n\nAbstract: Which concepts should we choose? This problem has so far not received the attention it deserves, and it often simply decided in the philosophical armchair without a full value and stakeholder analysis and with mainly epistemic values in mind. To overcome this shortcoming, in this paper, we bring together two literatures that have so far not interacted much. Philosophers of and technology and philosophers interested in conceptual engineering. The former group has developed a general method of responsibly developing technological solution to real-world problems. This approach is called Value Sensitive Design (VSD). The latter group of conceptual engineering scholars has worked out different understandings of what it can mean to engineer concepts but not how we can decide which concepts to engineer and how to best engineer or design them. We argue that VSD can fill this lacuna. In this paper, we propose the, to our knowledge, first comprehensive and general empirical systematic method of how to assess and design concepts, i.e., to engage in conceptual ethics and engineering. To test this method and show how it works in practice, we illustrate this method by means of the concept of colleague in light of recent progress in AI research.\n\n◘ Talk by Rose Novick: Speaking Is Not Puffing\n\nDate/Time: Wednesday, 1st March, 10am HK\n\nAbstract: The Qíwùlùn (齊物論, Leveling Things Discourse) chapter of the Zhuangzi (ca. 3rd century BCE) offers arguments that appear similar to the criterion argument for skepticism and the argument from disagreement for relativism. This is troublesome: skepticism and relativism are incompatible positions. In this talk, I provide a global interpretation of what Zhuangzi is doing in the Qíwùlùn that explains the presence of these arguments without attributing to him either a skeptical or a (standard) relativist position.\n\nI argue that a central aim of the Qíwùlùn is to offer a method of dispute resolution, which Zhuangzi calls shining a light (以明, yǐmíng). Seen in this context, and taking the literary forms in which these arguments appear seriously, I show that the apparently skeptical and relativist arguments are important steps in defending this method. While Zhuangzi’s method of dispute resolution can be understood as relativist in a sense, it is relativism of a strange sort.\n\nThe talk concludes with some speculative reflections on the implications of the Zhuangist view for conceptual engineering, which I hope we will think through together.\n\n◘ Talk by Nilanjan Das: Conceptual Amelioration in Sanskrit Epistemology: Dignāga, Candrakīrti, and Kumārila on Defining Perception\n\nDate/Time: Thursday 23nd February, 9am HK.\n\nAbstract: The aim of this talk is to study an episode from the history of Sanskrit epistemology in first millennium CE: a debate between the Buddhist philosopher Dignāga (5th-6th centuries CE) and two of his critics, Candrakīrti (6th century CE) and Kumārila (7th century CE). In his influential Compendium of the Sources of Knowledge (Pramāṇasamuccaya), Dignāga defines perception (understood here as a source of knowledge) as “free from conceptual construction” (kalpanāpoḍha). Both Candrakīrti (who belongs to another tradition of Buddhism) and Kumārila (who is a non-Buddhist, Brāhmaṇical thinker) resist this move for different reasons. But a charge that they both raise against Dignāga is that his definition doesn’t fit the ordinary use of the term “perception” (or, the closely related term, “perceptible”), since the contents of what we ordinary regard as perceptual experiences can have the kind of predicative structure that states of non-conceptual awareness don’t.\n\nInterestingly, both argue that this is a bad result, because it predicts that we are pervasively misusing our ordinary epistemological vocabulary. In this talk, I will consider (1) whether Dignāga and his later commentators have the resources to respond to this argument, and (2) whether those responses (if there are any) are successful against the very different metasemantic theories that Candrakīrti and Kumārila accept. I will then go on to ask what this episode from the history of Sanskrit epistemology can teach us about projects of conceptual amelioration in philosophy more broadly.\n\n◘ Talk by Ethan Landes (Zurich): Testing the Role of Lexical Effects in Conceptual Engineering\n\nDate/Time: Thursday 16th February, 4pm HK time\n\nAbstract: Engineered concepts and meanings do not float around freely – they need a lexical item to serve as a vehicle for their propagation. This talk examines the way in which the vehicle for conceptual or semantic change in conceptual engineering projects can affect the success of said conceptual engineering projects. Using experimental methods, I capture these so-called “lexical effects” (Cappelen 2018) in action, showing that what term is used as a vehicle for concept or meaning influences both the perceived valence of the concept or meaning as well as the ease in which word-meaning pairs are learned. This has important consequences for the practice of conceptual engineering. The success of conceptual engineering will be affected by the language used as a vehicle for the representational device. Due diligence is needed to empirically test how a word-meaning pair or word-concept pair will be interpreted by, represented by, and further propagated by the target audience of conceptual engineering.\n\n◘ Talk by Sally Haslanger (MIT): How to Change a Social Structure\n\n(with comments by Rachel Sterken (HKU) and moderated by Linus Huang (HKU))\n\nDate/Time: Wednesday May 5th, 9am Hong Kong Time\n\nVia Zoom: Info here.\n\nCosponsored by HKU’s The Society of Fellows in the Humanities and the HKU Philosophy Department\n\n◘ Workshop on Political Philosophy and Political Methodology, co-organized by Herman Cappelen and David Plunkett,\n\nWorkshop 1: Monday April 19 and Tuesday April 20 (April 20 and 21 in HK)\n\nTiming: evening USA (starting at 7:30pm EST those nights), which is morning in Hong Kong (starting at 7:30am of the following day), going for about 2.5 hours total each day. Note: we hope this timing could work for people in Australia to participate.\n\nWorkshop 2: Monday April 26 and Tuesday April 27\n\nTiming: morning in UK (starting at 9am), which is late afternoon in Hong Kong (4pm), going for about 2.5 hours total each day. We are hoping for either 2 or 3 sessions per day (roughly 45-50 min per session, with short breaks between each one). (Note: we are hoping this timing could work for people in Israel to participate).\n\nFull Details are here.\n\n◘ Talk by Sarah Sawyer (Sussex): Concept Pluralism in Conceptual Engineering\n\nDate/Time: Friday April 16th, 5pm Hong Kong Time\n\nVia Zoom: contact Matthew McKeever at mipmckeever@gmail.com if you’d like to attend.\n\nAbstract. In this talk, I will argue that an adequate meta-semantic framework capable of accommodating the range of projects currently identified as projects in conceptual engineering must be sensitive to the fact that concepts (and hence projects relating to them) fall into distinct kinds. Concepts can vary, I will argue, with respect to their direction of determination, their modal range, and their temporal range. Acknowledging such variations yields a preliminary taxonomy of concepts and generates a meta-semantic framework that allows us both to accommodate the full range of cases and to identify a proper subset of concepts for special ameliorative consideration. Ignoring such variations, in contrast, leads to a restricted meta-semantic framework that accommodates only a subset of the particular projects while generating implausible accounts of others.\n\n◘ Talk by Mona Simion (Glasgow): Conceptual Functions in Conceptual Engineering\n\nDate/Time: Monday April 5th, 6pm Hong Kong Time\n\nVia Zoom: contact Matthew McKeever at mipmckeever@gmail.com if you’d like to attend.\n\n◘ Talk by Una Stojnić (Princeton): Nonnegotiable Meanings: Communication, Ignorance, and Metalinguistic Negotiation\n\nDate/Time: Friday, March 26th, 9am Hong Kong Time\n\nVia Zoom: contact Matthew McKeever at mipmckeever@gmail.com if you’d like to attend.\n\nAbstract. A piece of received wisdom among philosophers is that successful communication requires shared content. A speaker can convey to an audience a desire for water by uttering “I want water” just in case both can coordinate on a shared content—that the speaker desires water. Another piece of received wisdom emphasizes that competent speakers can fail to know, and often make errors about, the meanings of expressions without disrupting linguistic usage (Burge, 1979; Kripke, 1980; Putnam 1975). What allows them to do so is that they are situated in a network of causal/social/historical connections, to which they defer in linguistic usage. Deferential Network Models were introduced to sidestep any clash between successful usage and “arguments from ignorance and error” (Devitt and Sterelny, 1999). But, given potential ignorance, how can agents coordinate on substantive shared information successful communication presumes? How is communication possible in a world of deference?\n\nOne reaction is to argue that little antecedent semantic knowledge is needed since we can coordinate on meanings on the fly. Some argue that meanings are dynamic, i.e., constantly changing, and potentially negotiated by members of a linguistic community even during a single conversation (Armstrong, 2016, Cappelen, 2018, Carston 2002, Davidson, 1986, Haslanger 2012; 2018, Ludlow 2008, 2014, Plunkett and Sundell 2013, i.a.). We, however, argue that given the practice of linguistic deference, meanings are non-negotiable, i.e., are not dynamic. Meta-linguistic negotiation can neither change word meaning nor secure a mutually shared content presupposed by communication. Indeed, accounts of meta-linguistic negotiation are unsuccessful in part because they already assume coordination on shared content. In response, one can either, deny that there is widespread ignorance and error, and so, a need for deference, or deny that communication requires a non-trivial mutual grasp of shared content. But either option carries a cost.\n\n◘ Talk by Amie Thomasson (Dartmouth): How should we think about linguistic function?\n\nDate/Time: Monday, March 22nd, 9pm Hong Kong Time\n\nAbstract. Talk of the functions of words or concepts has played a central role in conceptual engineering and in other philosophical projects. But what can we mean by ‘functions’ here, and how can we determine what those functions are? Some have expressed skepticism that we can make any good sense of the idea of function as applied to concepts or words. And this is a fair worry to which we ought to be responsive. In this paper I argue that the idea that parts of language (or concepts) have functions is not hopeless, nor are we limited to saying that the function of a concept (or term) F is just ‘to pick out the Fs’. I will try to show how we can get help in understanding and identifying linguistic functions from work in systemic functional linguistics. This in turn enables us to make progress in determining how we should not, and how we should, come to think about function in language, in ways that matter for conceptual engineering and other projects in philosophy.\n\nVia Zoom: contact Matthew McKeever at mipmckeever@gmail.com if you’d like to attend.\n\n◘ CLHK’s Inaugural Talk: Topic Continuity in Conceptual Ethics and Beyond\n\nTalk by David Plunkett (Dartmouth) and Tristram McPherson (OSU).\n\nDate/Time: Friday March 5th, 9am Hong Kong Time.\n\nVia Zoom: contact Matthew McKeever at mipmckeever@gmail.com if you’d like to attend."
