        "text": "Here at Time Out Boston, we’ve been wondering lately: What will our city look like in the future? Also, what should our city look like in the future?\n\nGiven its sky-high real estate prices and myriad challenges, Boston has become one of the toughest cities in the USA for business owners, particularly those running restaurants, cafes and bars. One local company, Foundation Kitchen, is planning on opening in Charlestown in early 2021, bringing with it a new approach to doing business.\n\nAs a shared culinary workspace, Foundation Kitchen’s main focus is to unite and promote other small food and beverage companies, something that is much needed during these challenging times. Foundation Kitchen’s co-founders, the husband and wife team of Ciaran Nagle and Tara Novak, have signed a 5,723 square-foot lease to open a new culinary production and dining destination at The Graphic Lofts in Charlestown. Located directly across the street from the MBTA’s Sullivan Square Station (Orange Line), the space will be open to the public seven days a week, offering a café, wine bar and food stalls, plus cooking classes, special events and culinary pop-ups.\n\n“Given this shift and increased demand for more healthy, local grab-and-go dining options, takeout and delivery have skyrocketed in popularity, as customers seek creative alternatives to cooking at home night after night,” said Ciaran Nagle in a statement.\n\n“We presently have one boutique shared commercial kitchen located in Union Square, Somerville, and we’re excited about this new location opening in Charlestown,” added Tara Novak. “This shared kitchen concept is licensed for shared-use food production, and multiple other businesses may operate from our new kitchen at The Graphic. All member companies working out of our space have their own licenses, insurance, and certification, and either work from their own designated studio space or from their own pre-scheduled space within the shared kitchen.\n\n“Companies can come in and focus on their core business – making and selling food that customers enjoy and appreciate. We also work very hard to curate a community of like-minded businesses within our facilities, creating a place where owners and employees can network, while supporting, mentoring, and motivating each other.”"
