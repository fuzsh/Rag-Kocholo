Those who have fought together reunite, share experiences, and offer support to one another.\n\nAllied Forces Foundation Founder & Chairman Emeritus, Maj (Rtd) Stephen Cain MBE.\n\nA graduate of the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, he was commissioned into the Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers. His distinguished military career earned him many honors, including being awarded a Member of the British Empire by Her Majesty the Queen for operational duties as Company Commander.\n\nStephen was devoted to enhancing the special relationship between Britain and America, and the steadfast alliance of Commonwealth nations in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. He furthered this commitment to British and American forces by establishing the Allied Forces Foundation, with the goal of providing experiences that unite and heal Allied wounded, ill, and injured. His leadership elevated the awareness of the organization and established the foundation on which the Allied Forces Foundation continues to grow."
