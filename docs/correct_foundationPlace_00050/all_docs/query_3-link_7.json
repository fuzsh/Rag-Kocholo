        "text": "The Greater Milwaukee Foundation was part of a movement that transformed philanthropy in the early 20th century. Local citizens pooled together their assets in a local foundation, allowing them to maximize their ability to address pressing local needs and plan for future challenges and opportunities.\n\nOliver C. Fuller introduced the idea to the Milwaukee community in 1915 after being inspired by the concept of a community trust first created in Cleveland the year before. President of the First Wisconsin National Bank, Fuller also was the Foundation’s first donor, making a personal contribution of $1,000 that he directed be divided between the Foundation’s operating expenses and a group of charities of his choosing.\n\nThe Foundation is Wisconsin’s oldest and largest community foundation – managing more than $1 billion in assets. It has awarded more than $1 billion in grants over the past century to support a wide variety of nonprofits and initiatives that enhance the quality of life in greater Milwaukee and beyond."
