If the project is selected, the Promoter will assist the Secretariat in monitoring its implementation.\n\nEach Alstom employee is allowed to support one project submission only per year.\n\nIf you have a good project to submit but don't know anyone from Alstom, the Secretariat of the Alstom Foundation may be able to help you identify someone willing to Play the promoter role in support of your project. But finding such a Promoter takes time. Accordingly, the deadline for receipt by the Secretariat of requests to find an Alstom Promoter is fixed at March 24, 2024. No such requests will be considered after this date.\n\nFurthermore, the Secretariat does not guarantee to find a Promoter for each submission. Promoters are volunteers who will only step forward if a project concept interests them."
