        "text": "The Mark Foundation for Cancer Research ASPIRE Awards support innovative ideas that have the potential to solve high-impact problems in cancer research, but may not have extensive – or any – preliminary supporting data.\n\nASPIRE Awards enable high-risk, high-reward projects to answer key feasibility and proof-of-concept questions and arrive at critical project inflection points in an accelerated time frame. ASPIRE Awards support work from bench to bedside, and special consideration is given to previously unaddressed questions and challenging concepts. The scope of ASPIRE Awards includes:\n\nBasic Research: Projects that have the potential to substantially accelerate understanding of cancer disease mechanisms and pathophysiology\n\nTherapeutic Discovery and Translational Science: Projects that include initial investigations of novel concepts in cancer therapeutics and/or that seek to answer key translational science questions on the critical path to the clinic\n\nInnovative Technologies: Projects aimed at developing innovative technology solutions that are integrated with leading-edge concepts in cancer biology\n\nClinical Research: Projects involving biomarker-rich, early-stage clinical trials and correlative studies that address fundamental questions related to the interplay of cancer therapy, intervention and/or companion diagnostics and biology"
