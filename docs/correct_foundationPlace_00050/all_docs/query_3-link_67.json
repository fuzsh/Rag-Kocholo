        "text": "Developed for teachers, by teachers, with teachers\n\nUFLI Foundations Toolbox\n\nThe Toolbox contains resources to support your implementation of UFLI Foundations lessons. These include lesson slide decks, decodable passages, and more!\n\nWhat is UFLI Foundations?\n\nAfter more than two years of development and pilot testing, we are excited to introduce you to UFLI Foundations, an explicit and systematic program that teaches students the foundational skills necessary for proficient reading. It follows a carefully developed scope and sequence designed to ensure that students systematically acquire each skill needed and learn to apply each skill with automaticity and confidence. The program is designed to be used for core instruction in the primary grades or for intervention with struggling students in any grade.\n\nJump to section:\n\nHow does it work?\n\nWhat specific skills are targeted in the program?\n\nWhat is special about UFLI Foundations?\n\nIs UFLI Foundations aligned with the science of reading?\n\nIs UFLI Foundations research-based? Is UFLI Foundations evidence-based?\n\nWhat do you mean by “for teachers, by teachers, with teachers”?\n\nWhat are people saying about UFLI Foundations?\n\nDownload UFLI Foundations Overview as a PDF\n\nDownload UFLI’s Alignment to Common Core State Standards\n\nHow does it work?\n\nUFLI Foundations provides teachers with detailed but easy to follow lesson plans that all follow this eight-step routine:\n\nPhonemic Awareness\n\nVisual Drill\n\nAuditory Drill\n\nBlending Drill\n\nNew Concept\n\nWord Work\n\nIrregular Words\n\nConnected Text\n\nSteps 1 through 4 serve as a warm-up and review of previously taught concepts. Step 5 is an explicit introduction to a new concept including guided practice reading and spelling words. Steps 6 through 8 are opportunities to apply concepts through reading and writing activities at the word and text level.\n\nWhat specific skills are targeted in the program?\n\nUFLI Foundations targets the following foundational reading skills:\n\nPhoneme blending and segmentation practice\n\nAccuracy and automaticity of grapheme-phoneme correspondences\n\nDecoding automaticity of words with previously learned concepts\n\nExplicit introduction of new concepts\n\nDecoding and encoding practice\n\nReading and spelling irregular words\n\nReading and spelling connected text\n\nWhat is special about UFLI Foundations?\n\nUFLI Foundations strikes the perfect balance between structure and responsiveness to students’ needs. The program features ample opportunities for students to practice, along with built-in gradual release. It provides teachers with detailed lesson plans, a PowerPoint slide deck to accompany each lesson, and downloadable materials for homework or center activities.\n\nUFLI Foundations is an example of an educative curriculum. This means that simply using the materials and lesson structure will add to your professional knowledge and skills in key areas:\n\nThe process of reading acquisition\n\nKey linguistic elements necessary for reading\n\nEvidence-based instructional methods that promote reading proficiency\n\nAnother key component that sets UFLI Foundations apart is the professional development available to prepare teachers to implement the lessons. You may choose to take advantage of webinars, videos of lesson components being taught, and other online resources that will help you make the most of UFLI Foundations.\n\nIs UFLI Foundations aligned with the science of reading?\n\nIf you are familiar with the science of reading, you may have heard of Gough and Tunmer’s “simple view of reading,” which states that reading comprehension is the product of decoding and linguistic comprehension.\n\nIf either decoding or linguistic comprehension is weak, the effect is multiplied. That is, you can never have better reading comprehension than the level of development of either your decoding or linguistic comprehension skills.\n\nWith this in mind, UFLI Foundations addresses the “D” part of the equation. In many instances, students fail assessments of reading comprehension not because they cannot synthesize complex ideas presented in text, but because they do not have access to such ideas because they cannot decode the text. Ensuring students can fluently decode text affords them the opportunity to apply and refine their linguistic comprehension skills, construct meaning from text, and more accurately demonstrate their understanding on assessments.\n\nGough and Tunmer’s “simple view of reading” can be visualized as a mathematical formula:\n\nIs UFLI Foundations research-based? Is UFLI Foundations evidence-based?\n\nUFLI Foundations is research-based. This means it was developed to align with what decades of reading research has shown to be effective. We incorporated findings from research on word reading development and effective instruction to build an explicit and systematic program for teaching children to read and spell words.\n\nUFLI Foundations is also evidence-based. Before releasing the program, we spent two full years developing and piloting each component. We observed lessons, and we got feedback from teachers who were using the program. Most importantly, we assessed student progress, and we found that students who received instruction using UFLI Foundations made significant gains in phonemic awareness, decoding, and oral reading fluency.\n\nWhat do you mean by “for teachers, by teachers, with teachers”?\n\nFor Teachers...\n\nFor years, the most urgent and persistent request we heard from the teachers we work with was for a more effective and more easily implemented program for foundational skills instruction.\n\nWhile most language arts standards include learning targets for foundational reading skills for kindergarten through second grade, they are not detailed enough to build a day-by-day sequence of instruction. While most schools have an abundance of resources in the form of book rooms, basal readers, and a variety of intervention program kits, there is typically insufficient guidance for how, when, and with whom to use these materials.\n\nIn response to this persistent need, our team developed UFLI Foundations, a program that includes the necessary professional learning, resources, and scaffolding for teachers to deliver high-quality instruction in foundational reading skills.\n\nThis is how UFLI Foundations was born.\n\nBy Teachers...\n\nEvery member of the UFLI team began their journey as a classroom teacher. It was their passion for teaching and expertise in reading instruction that led them to become part of Team UFLI, where they provide professional development for educators not only here in Florida, but throughout the country and across the globe. UFLI faculty and staff also conduct research on effective literacy instruction and intervention and use this research to inform their work with teachers. Because of this collective wealth of experience and knowledge, UFLI is well-positioned to translate research into practice, never forgetting what it was like to be in the classroom searching for the best resources to help their students.\n\nWith Teachers...\n\nIn the two years we have been piloting UFLI Foundations, our team has actively sought feedback from the teachers who were using it in their classrooms. Their response was overwhelmingly positive, but they did give us some valuable insights that helped us hone the program and make it even more effective and efficient to implement.\n\nWe listened.\n\nSome features of UFLI Foundations that we have incorporated based on teacher feedback include:\n\nConcept-based spelling assessments for progress monitoring\n\nWeekly home support resources\n\nPre-planned word chains that provide systematic, interleaved practice during the Blending Drill\n\nObservation forms for instructional coaches\n\nUFLI Foundations would not exist without the involvement and input from the teachers in our pilot schools!\n\nWhat are people saying about UFLI Foundations?\n\n“The rhythm, the pacing – my kids enjoy it. I don’t have any issues keeping them motivated.”\n\n“This curriculum picks out the best of all the other curricula we’ve had.”\n\n“These lessons and word lists have saved me so much planning time.”\n\n“UFLI has been so amazing for my kids!! They have a deep understanding of the material and are able to decode words with taught skills… I am teaching a support facilitation class this year, and the interleaved practice that UFLI provides has been so helpful for my class.”\n\n“UFLI Foundations is the best part of my day.”"
