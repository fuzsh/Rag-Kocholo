        "text": "From the people you work with to the students you help in gaining entry to higher education in the UK, Kaplan International Colleges is truly the international experience. The department I work in is full of lively and interesting characters with a real sense of being one team with one goal. What is more is that the company recognises your hard work and willingness to learn. This certainly was the case for me as I have made steady progress since joining as an Admissions Advisor back in 2012.\n\nKaplan has given me the opportunity to grow and improve. I started as a Customer Care Advisor for direct students in Italy. One year later I was promoted to Client Relationship Executive. I progressed further to the role of Customer Care Team Manager for Italy and Spain, then for Western Europe and now ESL. My current role has involved building a strong relationship with a new partner with several offices all around Europe. This has meant more travelling, which has been such an adventure! I have found it very stimulating, and it has been great meeting lots of new colleagues. Waking up and being happy to go to work is priceless and this is what I feel working for Kaplan.\n\nEveryday at Kaplan is different. Our school is an international hub of activity where everyone can feel free to be themselves and have the chance to learn about different cultures - and have fun sharing it! Everyday presents new challenges and successes. Since starting here two years ago, I have never had two days that are the same. A big part of what makes my job and the school what it is is our students and all the different, colourful and interesting things they bring."
