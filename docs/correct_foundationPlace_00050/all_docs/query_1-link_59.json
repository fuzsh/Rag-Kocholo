        "text": "Champions\n\nOur unique group of HeForShe Champions form the HeForShe alliance. They are an intimate group of the most ambitious leaders from across government, business, non-profit, and academia. From 2021, they are on a fire-year journey to accelerate progress toward gender equality.\n\nSolutions\n\nEach one of us has a role to play to make gender equality a reality and the tools we need are right here. HeForShe Champions have done the hard work and shared their tried and tested for achieving parity at leadership, for ending gender-based violence and for many more of today's most critical equality issues.\n\nResources\n\nEveryday HeForShe supporters like you are taking action to create real change in their communities. Take a look at our Action Kits and other resources to see what you can do.\n\nI joined HeForShe to stand WITH and stand BY women. It is vital that we show solidarity, that we listen and that we learn.”\n\nWithout the contribution of men, without change in the way men behave, we won’t make the strides towards gender equality that are so important to all of us.”\n\nI’m inviting you to step forward, to be seen and to ask yourself… “If not me, who? If not now, when?”\n\nWhy is it always women who have to break through the glass ceiling? Where are the men willing to throw boulders down through it? They are right here.”"
