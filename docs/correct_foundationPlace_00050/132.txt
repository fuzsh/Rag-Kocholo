Since its launch, Amber has challenged the status quo of fine dining in Hong Kong and beyond, attracting a global audience of discerning gourmands for its innovative approach to French cuisine. Its most recent evolution has ushered in a new era of responsible contemporary dining, with a thoroughly reimagined dining experience, recognised for 16 consecutive years two Michelin-stars and The Michelin Green Star since 2022.

In the elegantly composed dining room created by renowned New York firm Tihany Design, Culinary Director Richard Ekkebus and his team continue to redefine cuisine for a modern audience, with consciously sourced ingredients whose innate flavours and nourishment are celebrated through a foundation of French technique.
