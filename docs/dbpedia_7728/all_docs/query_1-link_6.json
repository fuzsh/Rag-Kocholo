        "text": "In 1983 a silver-tongued teenager contacted a prominent Manhattan couple and claimed to be the son of Sidney Poitier.\n\nThe 19-year-old introduced himself as David Poitier, a classmate of Inger McCabe Elliottâ€™s daughter, Kari. He explained that he had been mugged while in New York to meet his father, who was directing a film version of the Broadway musical Dreamgirls. All his money was stolen, as was his university thesis on unfairness in the criminal justice system.\n\nMcCabe Elliott and her husband, Osborn Elliott, generously invited the young man to spend the night at their apartment and gave him $50 and some clothes while they attempted to confirm his identity. At the time it would have been less than straightforward to learn what today"
