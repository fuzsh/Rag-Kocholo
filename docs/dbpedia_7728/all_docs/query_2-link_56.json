        "text": "Osborn Elliott (October 25, 1924 – September 28, 2008) was the editor of Newsweek magazine for sixteen years between 1961 and 1976.[1] Elliott is credited with transforming Newsweek from a staid publication into a modern rival of Time.[1]\n\nNewsweek's circulation doubled to 3 million issues during Elliott's tenure as editor, which narrowed the gap with Time.[1]\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nOsborn Elliott was born in New York City,[1] the son of Audrey Osborn and John Elliott. His father worked as an investment counselor.[1] His mother was a high-profile real estate agent in Manhattan who had been actively involved with the American women's suffrage movement of the early 20th century.[1]\n\nElliott attended St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire.[1] He attended and graduated from Harvard University on an accelerated two-year wartime program.[1] He served in the United States Navy for two years after graduation as a naval officer.[1]\n\nCareer[]\n\nElliott began his career in the news magazine publishing industry by joining The Journal of Commerce and then Time.[1]\n\nHe was first hired by Newsweek in 1955 as a senior editor of business news.[1] He was promoted to managing editor of Newsweek in 1959.[1]\n\nElliott was further elevated to editor of Newsweek in 1961 when the Washington Post Company acquired the magazine.[1] He became editor in chief of Newsweek in 1969.[1] He took on the additional roles of president, chief executive and chairman within the following three years.[1]\n\nNew York City Mayor Abraham Beame offered Elliott a position with the New York City government in 1976 as the newly created deputy mayor of economic development.[1] Elliott left Newsweek to take the deputy mayor position for an annual salary of $1 per year.[1] Elliott's role in New York government was to reverse the loss of jobs which was taking place at the time in New York City.[1] He served as deputy mayor for the remaining 15 months of the Beame administration.[1]\n\nElliott was named dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in January 1978.[1] He stepped down from that position in 1986, but remained at the school as a journalism professor.[1] The Asia Society, which is headquartered in New York City, has since named an annual journalism prize, the Osborn Elliott Prize for Excellence in Asian Journalism, in his honor.[1] In 1975, Elliott founded Citizens Committee for New York City along with Senator Jacob Javits. His 1980 autobiography was titled \"The World of Oz.\"\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nWith his first wife, Deirdre Spencer, Elliot had three children: Diana Elliott Lidofsky, Cynthia Elliott (Rice), and Dorinda Elliott (Ignatius). They divorced in 1972.[1] He married his second wife, Inger McCabe Elliott,[2] in 1973 and became a stepfather to her three children, Alec McCabe, Marit McCabe (Dubois), and Kari McCabe (McBride).[1]\n\nDeath[]\n\nOsborn Elliott died in New York City on September 28, 2008. He was 83 years old.[1] Elliott was survived by three daughters and stepchildren.[1] The current editor of Newsweek, Jon Meacham, called Elliott, \"Wise and witty, Oz Elliott is the architect of the modern Newsweek.\"[1] The Asia Society released a statement which called Elliott \"one of the earliest practitioners of 'civic journalism' -- the deliberate focusing of the journalistic enterprise on urgent issues of public policy.\"[1]\n\nCultural references[]\n\nElliott's victimization at the hands of the con artist David Hampton provided some of the basis for John Guare's drama Six Degrees of Separation.[3]\n\nReferences[]\n\nSources[]\n\nOsborn Elliott: The World of Oz: An Inside Report on Big-Time Journalism by the Former Editor of Newsweek. New York: Viking Adult, 1980.\n\n[]"
