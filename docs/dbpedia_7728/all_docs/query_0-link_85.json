Johnson, on the death of their son, Bird M. Johnson who died May 22, 1885, aged one year and five months. By L.E. Eldridge Dear Bird-precious little one, Thy gently spirit is fled; We could not keep thee with us here, Our darling child is dead. Those little dimpled hands are still. So still and icy cold. Thy restless feet are quiet now, Beneath the grave yard mould. The rose red lips we kissed so 'oft, The shining rings of hair We twined above they snowy brow, And smoothed with tender care, Lie low beneath the coffin's lid, Shut from living sight, But still we know our baby dear Lives in a world of light. We look around, and see the toys That woke they childish glee, The little shoes and cap and all Reminding us of thee, We miss thy soft and clinging clasp, The perfume of they breath, The livelight in those dear blue eyes Now dimmed, alas, by death. But there's a land where pain and grief Are banished ever more, And sailing o'er the water dark Our child has reached that shore. Sometime we hope to meet him there, Our darling little one.

Anderson of Manitowoc, who brought the old flag which belonged to their company and which together they had carried in 26 battles, during a term of service of three years and four months and spread it over the coffin. Judge Anderson recounted the story of the days when they were comrades together in the times of the war and paid a glowing tribute to his dead friends memory. He also took the occasion to remind the young generation of today that the time may come when they will be called to fight for their country and said: You will not go far wrong if you stand by Old Glory. Manitowoc Daily Herald, Thursday, March 15, 1917, Page 4 ******** Willard Harrison (June 18, 1839-March 8, 1917 husband of Mary Asenath Tyler [married Sept. 18, 1865 at Niles, Town of Eaton] son of Robert David Rickaby and Almira White born in Vernel Corners, Wyoming County, New York [Genesse, Vernal Corners, New York] moved with his parents and brothers and sisters to the Town of Eaton in 1856 veteran of the Civil War, enlisting on April 22, 1861 as a corporal member of Company A, 5th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry, which was the first company sent from Manitowoc in response to President Lincolns call in"
