        "text": "In October 2000, The American-Scandinavian Foundation opened Scandinavia House: The Nordic Center in America. This permanent Park Avenue venue for educational and cultural programming is also a showplace of modern Scandinavian design. Scandinavia House has established itself as a destination for New Yorkers, tourists, Scandinavians, and museum enthusiasts. Home of the American-Scandinavian Foundation, it houses staff working on the cultural programming and activities as well as fellowships and grants, trainee placements, publishing, and membership offerings.\n\nPopulation(s) Served\n\nAdults\n\nChildren and youth\n\nIn 2017, American-Scandinavian Foundation (ASF) initiated a new program to support Scandinavian folk arts and cultural traditions in the Upper Midwest (defined as North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan). Broadly defined, folk arts are expression of community identity and values. They are cultivated informally among individuals by word of mouth or examples. Whether practicing a traditional craft, art, technical or occupational skill; performing music or dance; or marking important moments of life or the year with special foods or customs, folk arts are deeply rooted in community life and foster human creativity.\n\nASF is committed to celebrating and preserving Nordic (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, SÃ¡pmi, Sweden) culture throughout the United States. By supporting folk arts and traditional cultures in the Upper Midwest, in particular, ASF recognizes and celebrates the mastery of individual artists or practitioners, facilitates the cultivation of skills and understanding among younger generations, brings greater visibility to Scandinavian arts and traditions, and highlights the centrality of cultural expression to all of our lives.\n\nPopulation(s) Served\n\nAge groups\n\nPeople of European descent"
