        "text": "R. DOUGLASS RICE\n\nR. Douglass Rice was born in La Jolla, California in 1952. He grew up in Sewickley, Pennsylvania. In 1968 his family moved to San Francisco, California. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy where he took his first sculpture class with Richard Lyman. He attended Stanford University where he studied sculpture with Richard Randall and earned a degree in Human Biology in 1974. He also studied painting at the Mendocino Art Center, San Francisco State University and the School for Visual Arts in New York.\n\nIn 1987 Rice moved with his family to New York and raised their two children in New York City’s Soho District. He worked in his high end residential company from 1987 to 2015. During this same time, Rice maintained a studio in Tribeca. He has exhibited in numerous galleries over the last thirty years, including two shows at the National Arts Club. After his second show there in 2008, he was invited to become a member and continues to serve on the club’s Round Table committee.\n\nRice was a board member of the Bronx Museum of the Arts for ten years and served as its chair from 2009 until 2013. He is currently Chair Emeritus of the museum.\n\nIn 2016 Rice moved to Stonington, Connecticut.
