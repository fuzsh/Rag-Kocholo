        "text": "Glenn Collins\n\nSOME kind of flu, that”s what it is, and it”s been making the rounds recently. Here are one victim”s notes.\n\n“(1) Had a terrible virus, awful. Three weeks’ worth; started in nose, moved toward midsection, settled in stomach, then tickled throat. Couldn't talk for two days. Would have felt paranoid about it (some kind of medical freak, here, the guy can't shake this bug?) but the Flu Support Network came to the rescue. Barbara: ‘Oh, I had that. For a month. You have two weeks to go.’ Stanley: ‘I had to whisper for four days. You're lucky you can talk.’ Eugene: ‘Honey and whisky. That's what got me through. Get you through too.’\n\n(2) The Support Network was crucial. Why? Because this virus was not chronicled in the press, probed on Eyewitness News, or recognized by the doctor. ('Oh, yes. A sore throat. Have the pharmacy call my office.') This was NOT a sore throat! It was the virus.! The one that everyone knew about. Everyone in the Support Network, that is — to be denied that word‐of‐mouth comfort would be to suffer dreadful isolation. •\n\n“(3) And so, a suggestion: that the Network be legitimatized. How? A modest proposal: establish a Virus Hotline Number. New York Telephone Company, are you with us? You remember the old dial‐thetime‐of‐day number that we loved so much, before you changed it: 62T‐1212, spelled NERVOUS? Well, the Virus Hotline would be 488‐5463, spells HOTLINE, as in hot. Any time of day or night, just dial (212) 468‐5483. To hear: ‘Good afternoon, this is the latest report on Metropolitan Area viral conditions. The Forest Hills outbreak of Six‐Day Head Cold seems to have spread to isolated areas of Kew Garden Hills; sporadic cases have been reported in Long Island City. All of those on the west side of Manhattan are warned to beware of the School District Three Parent Sore Throat Syndrome, which lasts for two days, take plenty of fluids. And in New Dorp, on Staten Island....’ “\n\nWell, I'm here in my seat on the Amtrak;\n\nI'm at least two hours late on this sham track; And the sad explanation\n\nIS that acceleration\n\nSets those freight trains to jumping the damn track.\n\nISAAC ASIMOV\n\nNo end in sight for the running boom, it seems. our Fifth Avenue publishing sources report that the industry expects to do especially well this season, when the following new titles hit the stores:\n\n“Running and Being and Nothingness,” by Jean‘ Paul Sartre; “The Total Runner,” by Marabel Morgan; “The Running Cat Catalogue,” by B. Kliban; “Broca's Run,” by Carl Sagan; “The I‐Hate‐to‐Run Cookbook,” by Peg Bracken; “Listen to the Run,” by\n\nTHOUGHTS\n\nON ATTEMPTING TO APPROACH NEW YORK FROM WASHINGTON, D.C., WHILE THE TRACKS AHEAD ARE BEING CLEARED,\n\nVERY, VERY SLOWLY\n\nRod McKuen; “Up and Down With the Running Stones,” by Tony Sanchez, and “The Myth of Running,” by Victor K. Lasky.\n\nThere's trouble in store for a utility company that keeps sending newsletters full of statistics to people like Christopher Cerf and Henry Beard, who are of the satiric persuasion. You see, they are tired of getting all those gossips Con Edison bill stuffers: “You know, the newsletters that tell you how you can save a microwatt by lining your closets with ambergris, or that inform you about the slight increase in your electric rates that will be needed to pay for 600,000 extension cords from Niagara to Ravenswood.\n\n“We have just sent Con Edison our own self‐serving diatribe, and we encourage you to concoct yours, too, and send it in with your next bill. (Remember to affix stamp! Postman will not deliver without proper postagel)” Here it is:\n\nWe're doing what we can to brighten your day. We know companies would prefer to receive fewer partial payments of bills, and larger payments when the full amount is not ‘remitted. And they'd like to receive all payments more promptly. Well, there isn't much we can do about these problems, but more and more of us customers are using checks with pictures and bright designs. And many customers regularly use special commemorative stamps and other interesting Postal Service issues rather than the standard 15‐cent stamp. We believe that small touches like this illustrate our commitment to a better business relationship!\n\nONLY‐IN‐NEW‐YORK‐TOWN DEPT.: It happened during a perfect dinner party on Central Park West, amid the mix of journalists, diplomats and folks‐about‐tcnvn. Ott in a corner — talking animatedly in their respective languages — were Inger McCabe Elliott, who was born in Norway, and Marit Gentele Gruson, who hails from Sweden. In truth, the two tongues, when spoken, are not dissimilar; and, in truth, both conversationalists were rejoicing in an opportunity for linguistic recreation. The talk became cozier and cozier; but suddenly, a Korean couple headed straight for them. Oh my, said Mrs. Elliott; it was not just that introductions would have to be made, but that English would have to be spoken again. “Not at all,” said the Korean gentleman, fn fluent Swedish. “It's delightful to be able to converse again in your excellent language.” It was Ambassa.\n\ndor Hogan Yoon, the Korean Consul General, accoMpanied by his wife Heiyoung. It. seems that he had been stationed in Stockholm from 1966 to 1969, and, he said, bad once even tried his Swedish on King Gustaf VI Adolf. The exotic tete‐atete resumed, hardly missing a beat.\n\nDYCKMAN ST. DAYBREAK\n\nThe grace of living\n\nYes the hope in hands\n\nFingerprints in the winds The gong ho in the dial tone ohyes oh yes\n\nMoving my head\n\nIn the random walk\n\nSIMON DUBLIN\n\nPaul Showers, Our Man In Hollywood, reports:\n\n“Disdainful New Yorkers might like to know that, this morning at 8:30, there was practically no smog, and the view was superb. Yesterday at dusk a covey of California partridges, with little black topknots, came rustling up through the canyon underbrush and went to roost in the pepper trees behind the house, clucking and fretting like chickens going to roost in the henhouse back on the farm. Later I walked out along the edge of the canyon in the moonlight to watch a large horned owl prancing about on the topmost branch of a dead tree, hooting his territorial claims in the darkness high above the city's gleaming grid."
