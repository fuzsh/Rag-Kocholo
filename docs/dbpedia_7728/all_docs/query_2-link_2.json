        "text": "Library: At first, Elliott painted this sixth-floor, open-plan apartment all in white to make it feel like a downtown loft. She then quickly returned to the bright colors that were always her signature as a designer, painting the library cobalt blue. ‘‘I believe you should have dark colors with books,’’ she says.\n\nAttire: Elliott is wearing a 19th-century Chinese robe and a jade necklace. In 1972, she was designing clothing from Chinese textiles for Henri Bendel and Bonwit Teller when Oscar de la Renta’s wife, Françoise, suggested she sell to interior designers instead. She started China Seas, a textile business, working with Javanese and Chinese batik artists on new patterns and colors.\n\nCouch: Pillows made from silk ikat fabric found in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, adorn the couch, which is lined with silk designed by Jack Lenor Larsen.\n\nPainting: When Elliott was living in Hong Kong in the 1960s, she photographed the refugees from Mao’s Cultural Revolution, who often arrived in Hong Kong wearing standard Maoist blue jackets and pants. Thirty years later, she bought a painting by Li Shan, “Rouge No. 59: The Young Mao,” at Sotheby’s in New York.\n\nDining Room/ Study: Elliott and her husband, Oz Elliott, a former editor of Newsweek, brought up eight children (two were Chinese refugees); she says she favors semigloss paint because it’s easy to wipe clean. This room she painted orange because it faces north and she wanted to add light. The shelves house her color library: 18 jars filled with small pieces of fabric and wallpaper swatches that she collected from all over the world for more than 20 years. She donated her textile collection, which consisted of more than 700 pieces of batik, to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where it was exhibited in the 1990s.\n\nTable: Covered in an Indian print she bought in Rajasthan 10 years ago, it is piled with reference books on photography and textiles, including a mock-up of her own book of photographs, which she was working on with the designer Massimo Vignelli just before he died.\n\nConnecting Rooms: The bottom half of a Japanese ‘‘chest upon a chest’’ serves as a sideboard. Elliott bought it in Tokyo 40 years ago. Willem de Kooning’s “Still Life,” 1929, hangs on the wall. It is among de Kooning’s earliest paintings. She inherited it from her parents, who befriended de Kooning in the Hamptons, where they had a house. ‘‘There were many impoverished artists living there then; even fishermen traded fish for artwork,’’ she says. The painting was included in the 2011 de Kooning retrospective at MoMA.\n\nLibrary Floor: Elliott inherited the 19th-century Chinese rug from her mother-in-law. Near the door is a Picasso drawing of Marie-Thérèse Walter, from 1928.\n\nDressing Room: ‘‘There’s something about blue and white that reminds me of early-morning Scandinavia,’’ Elliott says. The rag rug is from Norway, where Elliott was born. She left when she was 8, in 1941; her father, a doctor, was blacklisted for being in the resistance, and the family made its way to America. Above the door, a Roy Lichtenstein print, “Study for Red Lamp,’’ 1991. Above the Japanese tansu chest, a poster Elliott commissioned from the designer Paul Davis for her company. The two Mexican chairs are gifts from her mother-in-law, who made the petit-point cushions. Elliott found the striped platform shoes online and wears them with white stockings."
