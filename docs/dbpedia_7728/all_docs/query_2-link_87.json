        "text": "One of the preeminent bandleaders and pianists in America. A living landmark. A true New Yorker for New York. These are just a few of the ways people have described Peter Duchin, whose music has filled the air at state dinners and inaugural balls, charity galas, and notable society events over the last six decades. Both his music and story have become woven into the fabric of New York City, reflecting the beauty, tenacity, and spirit of what the city is made of.\n\nIn 1962, Peter formed his first professional band, which played the St. Regis Hotel in midtown New York City. Since then, he has played over 6,000 events around the world. Peter and his band are known for their wide-ranging repertoire that includes jazz, big band swing, show tunes, and rock ‘n’ roll – music that lights up a room and brings people onto the dance floor.\n\nOver the last decade, Peter has only left the bandstand twice – after he experienced a stroke in 2013 and when he fell ill to COVID-19 in 2020. The stroke left him with limited use of his left hand, while COVID-19 kept him on a ventilator for 47 days.Through it all, he has persevered. Today, he plays the piano with his right hand, while his band’s bass player duplicates the sound his left hand would make, and he has not stopped playing gigs.\n\nWhile in recovery from COVID-19, Peter was inspired to write a second memoir, Face the Music. In his book, he reflects on the history of mid-century music and nightlife and explores his own history as the son of legendary bandleader Eddy Duchin and socialite Marjorie Oelrichs Duchin, who died just six days after his birth. As he faces different challenges throughout his life, he showcases his indomitable spirit and his generosity toward those around him.\n\nA luminary of the arts, Peter has played a leadership role in supporting New York City communities through his involvement in distinguished institutions such as the American Ballet Theatre, Carnegie Hall, and The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. He has also been a Citizens Committee for New York City Board member since 1982.\n\nPeter recently spoke about his deep connection to CitizensNYC in a conversation with playwright and screenwriter John Guare, who wrote the Tony-award winning play “Six Degrees of Separation.” The play reflects John’s own unique connection to the organization as it was inspired by an unforeseen incident that happened at the home of John’s good friends, CitizensNYC founder Osborn Elliott and his wife Inger McCabe Elliott.\n\nBoth Peter and John clearly remember when their friend ‘Oz’ put out the full-page newspaper ad for New Yorkers to roll up their sleeves and volunteer in 1975 – a time when the city was going through a crippling financial crisis.\n\nPeter says of CitizensNYC’s founding, “I was just entranced by what CitizensNYC did, which is why I got involved. I think it made so much sense to complement the people who are really doing something for their neighborhoods.”\n\nAs Peter looks ahead to the future, he is encouraged by the work of grassroots community groups that are rebuilding and revitalizing the city. He is also inspired by DreamYard, his son Jason Duchin’s nonprofit organization based in the Bronx. DreamYard offers yearlong arts and social justice programs that help Bronx youth to develop their artistic voice, nurture their desire to make change, and help them cultivate the skills needed to reach positive goals.\n\nCitizensNYC is overjoyed to honor our longtime Board member Peter Duchin as a 2023 New Yorker for New York. His music and contributions to New York City have kept the city resilient and full of life, and all of us in the CitizensNYC community are deeply grateful for his support."
