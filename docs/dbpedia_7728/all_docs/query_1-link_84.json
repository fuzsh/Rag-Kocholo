Growing up on a Minnesota farm in the 1930âs, winning a state championship in high school wrestling, serving in the Army during the Korean War, working for 50 years in the construction field, married for 45 years, raising 6 sons, and living a life close to his faith.\n\nGrowing up on a farm during the depression taught him how to be resourceful and that if something needed fixing, you do it yourself.Â So friends, family and neighbors could always count on Wallyâs generosity to help with any project.Â Wally was outgoing and with a good sense of humor, he loved to tease his friends. Wally had a love of the outdoors and sports which he introduced to all of his sons to.Â Coaching baseball teams and passing on his love of hunting and fishing.\n\nHis cabin on Ten Mile lake held a special place in his heart which he purchased on Lundstromâs Bay in 1968.Â Although things were cramped in the two bedroom, one-bathroom cabin with six kids and a family dog, there was always enough rods for fishing and enough hotdogs and marshmallows for roasting.Â In the 1970âs, many a good time was had on Wallyâs large pontoon which was ideal for fishing or swimming parties.Â Wally loved fishing for the elusive walleye in every area of the lake, including âWallyâs evening spotâ.\n\nAfter retirement Wally was able to enjoy a lot of time traveling around the world with his companion Gervae.Â Relaxing and enjoying well-earned vacation time.\n\nSons, Randy (Patricia), Barry (Andrea), Scott, Rodney, Brad (Kelly) and Tony.Â Grandchildren, Amy (Jason), Matthew, Tabitha and Zachary.Â Great Grandchildren, Kate and Vincent.Â Loving companion Gervae Anderson.\n\nPaul David Edelbrock died peacefully after a short illness on November 14, 2023, in Walker, Minnesota. He spent his last hours in peace and comfort, surrounded by his loving family. Paul was born in St. Cloud, Minnesota, on April 1, 1930, to Edwina Borgerding and Felix Edelbrock. He was the youngest of five children and enjoyed an adventurous childhood in St. Cloud, where he was lovingly nicknamed \"Ookie\" by family and friends. Paul was fortunate to have lived a full life of over 93 years with many wonderful adventures and family memories.\n\nDuring his childhood in St. Cloud, Paul earned his Eagle Scout Award and competed in numerous Minnesota canoe derbies. After graduation from Tech High School in St. Cloud, he was drafted into the army in 1951 and honorably discharged in 1952. Paul then spent several years traveling across the country pursuing grand adventures. He spent time exploring, camping, and working in Yellowstone Park. An avid skier, Paul eventually made his way to the mountains of Colorado, where he met his beloved wife Katherine Knowles Campbell, whom he married in 1965 in a beautiful ceremony in Nisswa, Minnesota. Paul and Katherine lived in Bemidji, Minnesota, Denver, and Colorado Springs before settling in Scottsbluff, Nebraska, where they raised their family and lived for fifty-two years.\n\nPaul was a serious collector of antiques and spent much time attending auctions in Wyoming and Nebraska and visiting every antique or \"junk\" store between Minnesota and Nebraska during his yearly pilgrimage to his cabin in the woods. With a remarkable attention to detail, he could appreciate the beauty of old homes. Paul was known for his painting, workmanship, and handyman skills. His passion was collecting beautiful antiques, which brought him much happiness.\n\nIn the later years of his life, Paul spent more time in his native Minnesota. He and Katherine meticulously transformed an old general store on Ten Mile Lake into a quaint cabin in the woods. Paul, Katherine, and many family members and friends made happy memories in this beautiful cabin. He was so pleased to have spent the last months of his life in his cabin looking out at the forest he so loved as a child.\n\nPaul is survived by his wife of fifty-eight years, Katherine Edelbrock, as well as his five children: Anna-Karin Edelbrock Fogg of NYC and Scottsbluff, Lisa Sweet (Matthew) of Omaha, Susan Scheele (Evan) of Boston, Paul Edelbrock (Kirsten) of Parker, CO, and Bridget Cisar (Aaron) of Omaha.\n\nHis grandchildren also survive Paul: Charles Fogg of NYC, Nathan Scheele (Harmony) of Northampton, MA, Martin Scheele and Nina Scheele of Boston, Ansley Edelbrock of Boulder, CO, Alex Edelbrock of Lincoln, William and Eden Edelbrock-Peterson and Pearl, Kale, and Everson Cisar of Omaha.

She attended elementary and middle school in Wichita and completed high school in Santa Barbara, California. She attended Oregon State University and University of Colorado obtaining a Bachelorâs and Masterâs Degrees in Education and Speech Pathology. She taught classes in public schools and worked with home school education, as well as practiced speech pathology and testing for the Central School District and Western Oregon University.\n\nLoydee and her first husband built a house between Dallas & Monmouth where they farmed for several years. She fell in love with agriculture and maintained that love throughout her life. Her participation in Oregon Women for Agriculture and American Agri-Women enhanced further her agricultural experiences. Loydee was co-owned Rock-N-Rogers Diners so she could have completed the cycle of âproducer to consumer.â\n\nHer strong ties to agriculture grew even more when she met Glen, a former farmer. This relationship led to a Presidential appointment for her by President Bush to the USDAâs Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Serviceâs state committee.\n\nBecause her parents grew up in Minnesota and her father worked for Jostenâs, which only functioned during the school year, they purchased property on Ten Mile Lake near Hackensack, Minnesota, and enjoyed every Summer at the lake where Loydee grew up with many new lifelong friends. Loydee loved TML so much that after she and Glen went there, she asked him âso what to you think about the lake?â He said he loved it! She then said, âokay then we can continue our relationship â otherwise you would be history!â Loydee & Glen were married August 19, 1995, on a boat in the middle of TML.\n\nAlthough Loydee had no children of her own, she immediately accepted and grew to love Glenâs family as her own â âready-madeâ as she used to say. She watched her family grow to include grandchildren and great grandchildren. Stonebrink family reunions added to her family enjoyment when she met all of the aunts/uncles, cousin etc., especially when playing in their Cribbage Tournaments.\n\nLoydee was (to say the least) âpolitically motivatedâ and supported those causes and candidates that in turn supported the US Constitution. She and Glen were invited to and attended a birthday party for President Ronald Reaganâs 85th birthday and a dinner party with President George and Barbara Bush. She initiated having Historical Performers (Thomas Jefferson and James Madison) to perform in the big red barn at her home to speak about the Founding Fathers 200 years ago.\n\nShe co-originated the Western Institute for Nature, Resources, Education and Policy (WINREP), a non-profit organization to study the intent of laws, then compare them to their implementation. Its motto was a unique Loydee slogan: âIf it is right, defend it â If it is wrong, fix it!â In an effort to make this happen, she bought the Greenwood School, then donated it to WINREP, with hopes of starting a private school that would teach basics and U.S. History.\n\nLoydeeâs favorite TV show was The Shepardâs Chapel with Arnold Murray (former farmer). She and Glen watched often together and discussed what they had heard. That was their church!\n\nLoydee loved good people, dogs, sunshine, farmers, honesty and God! She was one sweet, but tough lady who often said;\n\nâThe Hell I canât â Watch me!\n\nKathleen Sarles, who died on February 8, 2024, was introduced to this world 84 years ago, but we all knew and loved her as Spike. To say she embodied every single letter of her name is an understatement. Spike loved fiercely, was passionately devoted to her family and friends and had a signature spunk all her own. Spike graduated from Hamline University where she received her Bachelor of Science in Nursing. She also met her future husband Don at Hamline. They were married in the fall of their senior year and lived in the infamous \"Quonset Huts\" which were provided for married students. After graduation she worked as a nurse at St. Barnabas Hospital for six months. When the Minnesota National Guard stationed Don at the Fort Sam Houston base inÂ San Antonio, Texas, Spike became a nurse at the Santa Rosa Hospital.\n\nUpon returning to Minnesota, Spike taught Obstetrical nursing at Ancker Hospital's School of Nursing in St. Paul for three years. She left teaching to start her own family. While Spike missed nursing, she loved working full-time as a mom raising her three children (Greg, Lisa and Jodi). Eventually, Spike would welcome four beautiful granddaughters. Meeghan, Molly, Mara and Ella were her pride and joy.\n\nDon and Spike divided their time between their home in Eden Prairie and cabin on Ten Mile Lake. They loved taking family and friends on evening boat cruises, entertaining during all holidays, and taking the grandkids fishing. Not only was Spike devoted to her family, but also to her church family, Rotary and various organizations. She rarely rested and loved to be surrounded by people and activity whether it was the annual lutefisk dinner, talking about the latest book at book club or getting ready to spend time at their timeshare in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.\n\nSpike was proceeded in death by parents Tony and Helen Stallard and husband Donald Sarles. She is survived by son Greg (Andrea Nyhusmoen), daughters Lisa McCay and Jodi (Frank Seigars), granddaughters, Meeghan, Molly, Mara McCay, and Ella Sarles, countless extended family and friends, and her cherished dog, Zelda. Spike's Celebration of Life was held on Friday, February 23rd at Immanuel Lutheran Church in Eden Prairie.\n\nIn remembrance of Spike, the family asks that any charitable donations be made to the Eden Prairie Rotary Foundation (Eden Prairie Noon Rotary PO Box 524 Chanhassen, MN 55317) or to Immanuel Lutheran Church, Eden Prairie, MN.

She loved decorating for the seasons and celebrating holidays, especially Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving and birthdays.\n\nWhile teaching, Joan cherished weekends and summers at the family home on Ten Mile Lake, and ultimately she and Larry lived at the lake after retiring.

He was a simple man. He was self-driven, hard-working and, without a doubt, spent the majority of his free time in the great outdoors, where he enjoyed hunting and fishing. Everyone who knew him heard his favorite stories and watched the joy on his face as he reminisced about them.\n\nMany people remember Buzz as their favorite bus driver, dock/businessman, outdoor enthusiast and a dedicated husband.\n\nBuzz is preceded in death by the love of his life, Veronica Converse, who passed April 6, 2021. Many believe Buzz couldnât live without her and essentially passed of a broken heart.

They had become successful in business and family ventures so after retiring they relocated to Fort Somner, N.M., where they resided for several years together. Every summer, however, the couple trekked back to Walker, making several stops and unforgettable memories along the way.

Crabb, age 74, on November 27, 2021 following a two year struggle with cancer.\n\nBorn to Robert and Catherine Crabb in Minneapolis, MN, John was the youngest of three sons raised in LeSueur, MN, Bellevue, WA, and Edina, MN where he graduated high school. Summers were spent at a family cabin on Ten Mile Lake and at YMCA Camp Warren, both located in northern Minnesota. He earned his B.A. in Math and Physics from Macalester College followed by a M.A. in Education from Saint Thomas University and a second M.A. in Environmental Studies from Bemidji State University.\n\nJohn met Elaine, his wife of 50 years, while she was a student nurse at Northwestern Hospital School of Nursing. Elaine was John's nurse when he was hospitalized for mono. They married the following year and had two sons, Brian and Andy. Brian and his wife Anna live in the Minneapolis area with their two children Ben and Maddy. The tradition of summers at Ten Mile Lake and Camp Warren continue on through Ben and Maddy.\n\nJohn's youngest son Andy died in the fall of 2020 of a cardiac arrest following several years of declining health. This has been an immeasurable and ever-present loss for John and Elaine.\n\nJohn was a teacher and school administrator for 44 years. He began his career in Minneapolis and went on to teach in Washington D.C., Shaker Heights, OH, and spent the last 30 years of his career at Phoenix Country Day School. He loved his work and especially the people in the school community. John enjoyed various activities mostly involving water. He was an avid sailor on lakes and oceans alike. He and Elaine along with their sons organized and ran sailing trips to the Caribbean during spring break and Lake Superior during the summer. He also enjoyed sea kayaking, windsurfing, hiking, cross country and downhill skiing, ice boating and snowshoeing.\n\nMany people and places touched John's heart deeply. Ten Mile Lake, where he has spent nearly every summer of his life, is one of those places.Â From staying in the Woock's cabins as a child to eventually renovating an old log cabin from Camp Hillaway where he has since resided, Ten Mile Lake has always been an important part of his life.Â John served on the Board of the Ten Mile Lake Association and was heavily involved in maintaining the quality of the lake.Â Donations in John's honor can be made to the Ten Mile Lake Association.\n\nJohn is survived by a loving and extended family. He leaves behind his wife Elaine, son Brian (Anna), grandchildren Ben and Maddy, brother Bob (Andrea), and numerous nieces, nephews, grand-nieces and nephews and his sweet dog Cocoa who never left his side.\n\nOur sincere thanks and appreciation go out to family, friends and healthcare workers who have shown tremendous love and support throughout John's illness.\n\nRussell Carr Bremner, devoted husband, keen traveler; sweet, light tenor, master of dry humor and tireless volunteer, died Oct. 12, 2020 one day after his 89th birthday due to a stroke and Parkinsonâs Disease.\n\nPreceded in death by his daughter, Celeste Bremner Garvey; stepson: Jeffrey Archer Peck. Survived by his wife, Carolyn âBooâ Crandall Bremner; daughter, Adrienne Haley (Jeff); stepsons: Steven Peck, Scott Peck (Lisa); grandchildren: William (Katie), Patrick, Jackson (Jason), Austin, Kevin (Ione), Sean and Bianca; siblings: Lucille Howton and William Bremner plus many nieces and nephews; sister and brother-in-law Sally and Ron Wenda; brother-in-law and sister-in-law, Ed and Mary Beth Crandall.\n\nIn high school he ran track and played basketball. He attended Ripon College thinking of becoming a doctor but after flunking Chemistry switched majors to philosophy. While at Ripon he developed a life-long love of choral singing and performance. He served in the army during the Korean war and became an entertainer of the troops playing guitar, bass and pretending to be a cowboy singer. He was stationed in Germany and quickly picked up German as well as French and as he put it âenough Spanish to fool a Norwegianâ.\n\nAfter leaving the service he joined 3M as a salesman and lived in Houston and New Orleans before moving to Minneapolis. He married his first wife Gertrude Culpepper and had two daughters, Celeste and Adrianne. That marriage ended in divorce. In 1973 Russ met Carolyn âBooâ Crandall a divorced mother of three boys. It was love at first sight. Russ visited the Crandall cabin on Boone Point the summer of 1973. He was made to sleep on the old living room sofa by the senior Crandallâs. They played bridge which Boo hated, and she did some extremely poor bidding. She thought the lumpy couch and the bad bidding would be the end of it, but Russ just laughed about it for the next 47 years. Shortly after that visit he was transferred to Germany and while away wrote a letter and poem every day. They were married in Minneapolis in 1974 and returned to Belgium for two years. While in Europe they cultivated a love of travel which took them all over the world. After Russ retired, he started a marketing consulting business and volunteered mentoring small business owners through the organization SCORE. In his later years he worked with the Minnesota Literacy Project teaching English to immigrants. He belonged to the business networking group The Minneapolis Breakfast Club.\n\nRuss was a good friend, a curious observer and listened more than he spoke. He was a lover of books and crossword puzzles. He read the Star Tribune and the New York Times front to back daily. He had a famously dry sense of humor and was always willing to help with any task at hand. He sang in the Minneapolis Chorale and The Apollo Male Chorus.\n\nHe loved sitting on the front porch at Ten Mile reading and listening to the loons. Parkinsonâs disease slowed him down, but he never lost his quiet sense of dignity, good humor and spirit. He will be deeply missed. Memorial donations may be sent to the Ten Mile Lake Association.\n\nJohn grew up in Minneapolis where he excelled in track and cross country in high school. He graduated from Carleton College where he majored in Economics and played tennis on the college team. He served in the U S Army, then worked for IDS in Minneapolis, while playing in local and state tennis competitions. After 30 years he retired and lived happily with his family in the Twin Cities, New Mexico, Colorado and Arizona, where golf became his favorite.\n\nStarting in 1937, John spent as much time as he could with family and friends at our cabin on the south shore of Ten Mile Lake. In the early years he loved helping his dad, Larry, put up the dock each summer. He was an active racer with row boats, canoes and sail boats. We made paths and forts in the woods. Once the Hillaway Camp season ended, he enjoyed riding and jumping lessons with Helen Dalton and her horses, with his friends, the Coxes and Phelps.\n\nAs a young adult, John played morning tennis at the Garbischesâ court - a great daily event for family and friends for many decades. At their new cabin on the northwest shore, he enjoyed planting countless seedlings on the property and added a tennis court for his family and friends. He served on the Deep Portage Board for 9 years and donated the fireplace inside the gathering room of the main building. John was always delighted that his children loved being at Ten Mile. We know he will be with us there forever.\n\nJohn is survived by his wife, Carlyn, his sister, Judy, and his children: Larry (Ashton), Susan (Tom), Dan, Marcy (John), Cindy (Bo) and Steve (Katy). He was preceded in death by his parents June and Larry Bryngelson.\n\nMemorial contributions may be given to the James W Schwartz Environmental Protection Fund of the Ten Mile Lake Association.\n\nKim Moe peacefully passed away in her home at Bonita Springs, Fla., with her husband at her side Saturday, May 29, 2021.\n\nPlease join us to celebrate Kimâs life June 16 at 1 p.m. at Saint Paulâs Lutheran Church Hackensack.
