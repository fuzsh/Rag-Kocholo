Osborn Elliott (October 25, 1924 â€“ September 28, 2008) was the editor of Newsweek magazine for sixteen years between 1961 and 1976.[1] Elliott is credited with transforming Newsweek from a staid publication into a modern rival of Time.[1]

Newsweek's circulation doubled to 3 million issues during Elliott's tenure as editor, which narrowed the gap with Time.[1]

His 1980 autobiography was titled "The World of Oz."

Elliott's victimization at the hands of the con artist David Hampton provided some of the basis for John Guare's drama Six Degrees of Separation.[3]
