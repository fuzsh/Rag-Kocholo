        "text": "Adnan Oktar (Harun Yahya) Dear Children, In this book, we will discover the marvels of creation in the living beings surrounding us. In the following pages, you will set out on a joyful journey in the company of many loveable living beings who will amaze you with their many interesting and astonishing characteristics. While reading this book, you will see that Allah has created all living beings in perfect forms and that all of them are only manifestations of Allah's infinite beauty, power and knowledge. \"Do you know all the animals?\" We can hear you saying, \"Not really. Only some of them.\" Do you know about these creatures' lives? Do you know how they are born? How they live? How they protect themselves and find food? You probably have no idea about most of the details of these animals' lives. But don't worry! As you read this book, you will learn astounding things about them and be amazed at the various perfections and fine qualities Allah has given these living creatures. You are already acquainted with many animals. But in this book, you will also get to know some other animals' secret and marvellous worlds, which you have most probably never heard about or seen. You will like them very much. As you continue reading, you will be amazed at the way these animals can accomplish some of the tasks they do. You will see ostriches – the fastest runners in the world, tigers – some of the best sprinters, sharp-teethed squirrels, eye-catching peacocks and, as you meet them, you will come to know them better. Meanwhile, keep in mind that these are only some of the animals that exist in the world… Our planet abounds with countless other animal species.\n\nClassic books outlive their authors, and revising them is a task that is not for the faint of heart. By the time of its third edition (2003), Robert Stebbins's western North American reptile and amphibian handbook in the Peterson series had long since become an icon. The second edition (1985) featured 12 new plates and accounts for 37 new species (including the herpetofauna of Baja California), while the third edition covered 36 more new species (143 new paintings in 13 new plates, with others revised) and 50 sharp photos. Fifteen years later we have a fourth edition with 43 new species (Table1), no new paintings, only two new maps, and a completely different set of 138 photos. At 559 pages, the new volume is only 26 pages longer than the third (which was 197 pages longer than the second edition), which certainly says something. The plates (formerly grouped at the front of the book) are now dispersed to lead into each major taxo-nomic division, and the range maps (formerly grouped at the end) are now uniformly reduced to half-page width and inserted into or near each species account. The keys to species (unchanged) remain in the front of the book and the section on amphibian eggs and larvae (names updated, otherwise unchanged) remains at the rear with a glossary and an updated and useful index. The introductory material has been reshuffled and slightly revised, with major changes made to the former sections 2 and 3, Making Captures and Field Study and Protection. Readers are now advised that capture information previously provided was misused, and we should just look but not touch and try to take photos to see diagnostic characters. While one does not need to capture every individual, many sightings will go into the unidentified bin simply as a consequence of the escape behavior of the animals. I suggest that this shift represents a disservice that further isolates young people from nature, substituting 'don't do it' for 'learn how to do it responsibly.' Field herpetology cannot be (and should not be) reduced to birdwatching. Also, while Bob Stebbins's classic paper field notes served for almost a century, we are now supposed to go electronic, where your records will last until you drop your device in the creek or lose it. Permanence is unfortunately not a strong suit with electronic devices when used in the field. Go ahead and take digital notes, but print them out frequently and put them in a safe place. All of us with decades of written notes know how often we have been able to simply resolve an uncertainty long after even the best memory has faded away. The section on protection and conservation is updated and suitably bleak, citing laws that protect animals individually but seldom effectively prevent habitat destruction and are powerless against climate change and emerging infectious diseases. This is all the more reason to keep and preserve detailed notes. The bulk of the book consists of the plates and species accounts set in smaller type than in the third edition. The plates have been re-photographed and are sharp, but duller than the renditions in the third edition. As a graduate student I had the opportunity to watch Stebbins create some of these illustrations, and I feel that the brightness of the third edition plates is a more accurate representation. One of the best features of Bob's skill was his gift with lighting, and this is now poorly served. The species accounts are virtually unchanged except where taxa have been partitioned. These new species accounts are clearly a key part of the revision, but they are substantially inadequate. In many cases, the new account gives the common and scientific names, but notes that there is neither a photograph nor plate of the species discussed (account labeled \"Not Shown\"). One is supposed to identify the species by looking at the range map of its nearly identical sister taxon and recognize it solely on the basis of range. If there is information given on diet, reproduction or other life history information (as for Phrynosoma goodei), it is duplicated from the sister taxon's account rather than by having been documented for the new taxon independently. Also, the accounts for Batrachoseps relictus and B. simatus were not edited to extract the habitat and distributional information that applies to B. bramei, and are thus misleading. As in previous editions, only taxa occurring on the mainland of the Baja California peninsula and its Pacific Coast islands are included, although some but not all taxa that also occur on islands in the Gulf of California are shown on the maps. A major shortcoming in my view is that of 138 new photos in this edition, exactly two show species newly included (Ascaphus montanus and Rena dissecta); the rest of the newly included species simply are not illustrated. There are many superb photographers working with western North American herpetofauna who would be very proud to have some of their work in the holy book. Truly, this was an opportunity lost and inexplicably so given the shabby quality of some of the new photos, as addressed below. I have never understood why Stebbins grouped genera by families but then arranged the included genera and species in BOOK REVIEWS BOOK REVIEWS"
