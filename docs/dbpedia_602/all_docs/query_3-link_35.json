The name actually means spiny skin! All the animals in this phylum exhibit spiny skin and hence are grouped together. Let us find out more about them.\n\nSuggested Videos\n\nPhylum Echinodermata\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\nEchinodermata may look morphologically (structure and form) dissimilar at a glance, but they all share the same characteristic features. These animals have some really unique shapes and have beautiful colours. They are important ecologically and geologically, as they provide valuable clues about the geological environment.\n\nDid you know that they can regenerate limbs? When a starfish, with five arms, losses one arm, it has the capacity to regenerate the lost arm. This regeneration can take any time between several months to years, as the wound has to heal and then only are the new cells regenerated.\n\nEchinoderms are marine animals and can be found in the depths of the ocean as well as in the intertidal zone. An interesting feature of this phylum is that all animals belonging to Echinodermata are marine. There are no freshwater or terrestrial organisms in this phylum. Water vascular system present in the echinoderms is a unique circulatory system. This accounts for the gaseous exchange, circulation of nutrients, waste elimination as well as locomotion. This system has a central ring canal and radial canals that extend along each arm. Through these structures, water circulates. The madreporite is a structure present on top of the body. This is responsible for regulation of the water in the water vascular system.\n\nBrowse more Topics under Animal Kingdom\n\nPhylum Annelida\n\nPhylum Arthropoda\n\nPhylum Aschelminthes\n\nPhylum Chordata\n\nPhylum Coelenterata\n\nPhylum Hemichordata\n\nPhylum Mollusca\n\nPhylum Platyhelminthes\n\nPhylum Porifera\n\nCharacteristic Features of Phylum Echinodermata\n\nThese are exclusively marine animals.\n\nThe larval forms show bilateral symmetry and adult forms show radial symmetry.\n\nThey are triploblastic.\n\nIt exhibits organ system grade of organisation.\n\nThey have a true coelom.\n\nThe body is uniquely shaped. It can star like, elongated or spherical.\n\nThe body is unsegmented without a head.\n\nThe body surface is covered with calcareous spicules.\n\nBody cavity has the distinguishing water vascular system.\n\nTube feet help in locomotion.\n\nThe brain is absent but a nervous system is present with a nerve ring and radial nerve cords.\n\nRespiration occurs through tube feet and gills.\n\nSense organs are poorly developed and include tactile organs, chemoreceptors, terminal tentacles etc.\n\nSexes are separate.\n\nFertilisation is external.\n\nLost parts can be regenerated.\n\nClassification of Phylum Echinodermata\n\nPhylum Echinodermata is classified into the following classes:\n\nAsteroidea\n\nOphiuroidea\n\nEchinoidea\n\nHolothuroidea\n\nCrinoidea\n\nExamples\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\nAsterias (Starfish)\n\nEchinus (Sea urchin)\n\nAntedon (Sea lily)\n\nCucumaria (Sea cucumber)\n\nOphiura (Brittle star)\n\nLearn more about Phylum Aschelminthes here in detail.\n\nSolved Questions For You\n\nWater vascular system is a peculiar feature of which phylum?\n\nAns. Phylum Echinodermata.\n\nGive an example of an Echinoderm that is found in freshwater habitat.\n\nAns. Echinoderms are exclusively marine animals. There is no freshwater echinoderm.\n\nThe organs of locomotion in Echinodermata are called?\n\nAns. Tube feet.\n\nAristotle’s Lantern is a characteristic feature of which echinoderm?\n\nAns. Sea Urchin\n\nFAQ’s for You\n\nQ1. With reference to phylum Echinodermata, identify the classes which of the following have Pedicillariae?\n\nAnswer: A pedicellaria is a small claw-shaped appendage with movable jaws, called valves, commonly found on echinoderms (phylum Echinodermata), particularly in sea stars (class Asteroidea) and sea urchins (class Echinoidea). There are two major types of pedicellaria in sea stars: straight and crossed. Straight pedicellaria are typically larger and located on the body surface, whereas crossed pedicellaria are smaller and found more commonly on stalks, raised above the body surface or in clumps circling the spines. Four main forms of pedicellariae are found in sea urchins : tridactylous, ophicephalous, triphyllous and globiferous.\n\nQ2. Star Fish is?\n\nAnswer: A starfish wraps itself around the mollusk, then uses its tiny, suctioned feet to overpower the muscle that holds the bivalve closed, opening the shell and exposing the organism.\n\nThen it pushes its stomach out of its mouth, inside the shell and around the organism to begin digestion. It withdraws its stomach back into its body to finish digestion.\n\nQ3. Give an account of Phylum Echinodermata.\n\nAnswer:\n\n1. These are exclusively marine animals.\n\n2. They are triploblastic and coelomate animals.\n\n3. The larvae are bilaterally symmetrical while the adults are radially symmetrical.\n\n4. They have organ system level of body organization.\n\n5. They have spiny body and the endoskeleton is made of calcareous ossicles.\n\n6. They possess water vascular system and tube-feet that help them to move and attach to the substratum.\n\nExample- startfish, sea-urchin etc.\n\nQ4. Give the characteristics of phylum Echinodermata.\n\na. They are spiny skinned organisms\n\nb. They are diploblastic\n\nc. They are unisexual\n\nd. They do not have cavity\n\nAnswer: The echinoderms belong to the phylum Echinodermata and subphylum Deuterostomia. Phylum Echinodermata belongs to kingdom Animalia, they are triploblastic animals. Examples of echinoderms include sea star, sea urchins etc. Echinoderms are marine animals, they are unisexual and their body have a tough spiny exoskeleton."
