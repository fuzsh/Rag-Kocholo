        "text": "Introduction\n\nEchinoderm is any group of marine invertebrates with a hard, spiny covering or skin belonging to the phylum Echinodermata. Echinoderms have a rich fossil history dating back to the Cambrian Period (542 million to 488 million years ago).\n\nThey are well represented by numerous strange taxa, which are now extinct. Crinoidea (sea lilies and feather stars), Echinoidea (sea urchins), Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers), Asteroidea (starfishes or sea stars), Ophiuroidea (basket stars and snake stars, or brittle stars), and Concentricycloidea are living examples (sea daisies; discovered in the 1980s).\n\nEchinoderms are classified into 21 groups based mostly on skeletal structural distinctions. There are around 6,500 living species, and over 13,000 fossil species have been described.\n\nGeneral features of echinoderms\n\nSource\n\nStructure variety and size range\n\nAlthough most echinoderms are tiny, measuring up to 10 cm (four inches) in length or diameter, some can grow to be quite enormous; for example, certain sea cucumbers can grow to be two meters (6.6 feet) long, and a few starfishes can grow to be one meter in diameter. Some of the largest echinoderms include crinoids (sea lilies) with stems as long as 20 meters (66 feet). However, crinoids are extinct now.\n\nEchinoderms have a wide range of body shapes, especially among extinct taxa.\n\nAlthough all living echinoderms have pentamerous (five-part) radial symmetry, an internal skeleton, and a water-vascular system derived from the coelom (central cavity).\n\nTheir general appearance varies from stemmed, flowerlike sea lilies to wormlike, burrowing sea cucumbers to heavily armored intertidal starfish or sea urchins.\n\nThe echinoderm’s typical form might be that of a star, with arms extending from a central disc, or it can be spherical to cylindrical, with branching and feathery arms extending from a body frequently attached to a stalk.\n\nInternal skeleton plates can articulate (like in sea stars) or be sutured together to produce a rigid test (sea urchins).\n\nThe phylum gets its name from skeletal projections that resemble spikes and are characteristic of echinoderms (from Greek echinos, “spiny,” and derma, “skin”).\n\nThe surface of holothurians, on the other hand, is just warty. Echinoderms have vibrant colors, like red, orange, green, and purple. Many tropical species are dark brown or black, although brighter colors, especially yellows, are widespread among species not generally exposed to direct sunshine.\n\nNature’s important role\n\nEchinoderms are excellent scavengers of decaying debris on the bottom, and they feed on a range of microscopic species, helping to keep their numbers in check. When in huge numbers, sea urchins may ruin tropical seagrass meadows, harming the creatures that live there.\n\nSea urchins that dig into rocks and along shorelines can hasten shoreline erosion.\n\nOn the other hand, other tropical sea urchins limit the growth of seaweeds on coral reefs, allowing the corals to thrive. The removal of sea urchins causes algae overgrowth and damages coral reef habitats.\n\nConclusion:\n\nEchinoderms can change the structure of seabed sediments in several ways.\n\nMany sea cucumbers ingest enormous amounts of sediment, remove organic stuff as it goes through the gut, and eject the rest.\n\nLarge populations of sea cucumbers in a region can flip over huge amounts of surface sediments, changing the physical and chemical content of the sediments significantly.\n\nBurrowing starfish, sand dollars, and heart urchins disrupt surface and underlying strata to depths of up to 30 cm (12 inches).\n\nFurthermore, echinoderms generate many larvae that serve as food for other planktonic species.\n\nFAQs:\n\n1. What are the 5 characteristics of echinoderms?\n\nThey have a star-like appearance and are spherical or elongated.\n\nThey are exclusively marine animals.\n\nThe organisms are spiny-skinned.\n\nThey exhibit organ system level of organization; most members have a circulatory system as well as a digestive system.\n\nThey are triploblastic and have a coelomic cavity.\n\n2. Which aanimals belong to echinoderms?\n\nEchinoderms are marine ‘invertebrates’ belonging to the phylum Echinodermata. These include starfish, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sand dollars, and crinoids.\n\n3. Give two examples of echinoderms.\n\nEchinodermata are exclusively marine organisms. Sea stars, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sand dollars, and brittle stars are all examples of echinoderms.\n\n4. State two facts about echinoderms.\n\nEchinoderms don’t have blood\n\nSome echinoderms eat by ejecting their stomach\n\nAn Echinoderm can regenerate its body parts\n\n5. What is unique about echinoderms?\n\nEchinoderms have a distinct ambulacral or water vascular system that consists of a central ring canal and radial canals that run the length of each arm. Water travels through these systems, facilitating gas exchange, feeding, predation, and mobility.\n\n6. What kind of food do echinoderms eat?\n\nThey eat a variety of invertebrates, including bivalves, snails, crustaceans, marine worms, other echinoderms, and even fish. They are drawn to the carcasses of deceased creatures on the seafloor.\n\n7. Why are echinoderms weird?\n\nEchinoderms are very sophisticated creatures with organ systems unlike anything seen in other animals. They often lack a front end, a rear end, a head, and a brain.\n\n8. How are echinoderms important to humans?\n\nThey are a source of food and medicine for humans. Echinoderms play numerous ecological roles.\n\n9. What do echinoderms have in common?\n\nOne feature that all echinoderms have is radial symmetry. This signifies that the organisms have appendages (or body architecture) that protrude from the body’s center, similar to the spokes on a bicycle wheel.\n\n10. What characteristics do echinoderms have?\n\nThese are marine creatures.\n\nThe larval forms have bilateral symmetry, whereas the adult forms have radial symmetry.\n\nThey have three lobes.\n\nIt demonstrates organ system grade organisms.\n\nThey have a genuine coelom.\n\nThe body is a one-of-a-kind form and, and it can be star-shaped, elongated, or spherical.\n\nThe body is unsegmented and lacks ahead.\n\nWe hope you enjoyed studying this lesson and learned something cool about Echinoderms!
