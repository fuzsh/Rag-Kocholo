        "text": "As each new species evolved, the ossicles changed with it, so each species has uniquely shaped ossicles. Examination of gross morphology and microscopic ossicles showed that this species is Holothoria atra. Color uniformly black or dark brown; when alive body usually covered with sand coating of sand which may also serve to keep it cool by protecting it from the sun&#39;s rays. , except for several pairs bare patches dorsally; tables with reduced but sometimes spinose disc. The importance of detailed reproductive biological studies on Holothuria atra are necessary due to its important role in the conservation of the marine environment. This species found on subtidal sand and grassbed, 3to 4 m depth at Kish Island. Distributed throughout most of the tropical Indo-Pacific area. Holothoria atra, is a holothurian of order Aspidochirotes belonging to the family Holothuriidae genus Holothuria. It is deposit-feeder and is mainly found on sandy bottom of fringing reefs surrounding the Kish ...\n\nDespite their soft body and slow motion, sea cucumbers present a low predation rate, reflecting the presence of efficient defence systems. For instance, members of the family Holothuriidae rely on Cuvierian tubules for their defence. These tubules are normally stored in the posterior coelomic cavity of the animal, but when the sea cucumber is threatened by a potential predator, they are expelled through the cloacal aperture, elongate, become sticky and entangle and immobilise the predator in a matter of seconds. The mechanical properties (extensibility, tensile strength, stiffness and toughness) of quiescent (i.e. in the body cavity) and elongated (i.e. after expulsion) Cuvierian tubules were investigated in the species Holothuria forskali using traction tests. Important mechanical differences were measured between the two types of tubules, reflecting adaptability to their operating mode: to ease elongation, quiescent tubules present a low resistance to extension, while elongated tu..."
