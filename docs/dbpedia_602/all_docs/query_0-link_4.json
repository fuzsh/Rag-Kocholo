        "text": "Euapta godeffroyi (Semper, 1868) ( ) is a common sea cucumber in coral reefs in the tropical Indo-Pacific region and shows geographically large distribution in the tropical shallow waters from the west Indian Ocean to the east Pacific Ocean (e.g., Massin 1999). Apodid holothurians including E. godeffroyi are a stem group within the class Holothuroidea (Kerr and Kim 2001; Miller et al. 2017). Miller et al. (2017) confirmed the monophyly of the order Apodida, and that apodid holothurians are divided into two clades in the order Apodida: (1) family Myriotrochidae and (2) other apodid holothurians. In the later clade, however, the family Synaptidae including E. godeffroyi did not form a monophyletic clade. A part of synaptid species, Leptosynapta clarki Heding, 1928, was placed in Chiridotidae. Their molecular phylogenetic study of Miller et al. (2017) used six mitochondrial/nuclear gene markers, covering all common gene markers for Echinodermata, but their study included limited OTUs from apodid holothurians, and the relationships between L. clarki and chiridotid species lacked strong nodal support. Therefore, the order Apodida requires the phylogenetic and systematic revision using further genetic markers and OTUs, and 13 protein-coding genes of mitogenome are expected to be effective in revising the phylogenetic relationship of apodid holothurians. There has been no mitogenome record for the family Synaptidae in Apodida, and we choose E. godeffroyi as representative of the family. We determined the whole mitogenome sequence by a shotgun sequencing method.\n\nThe specimen was collected in 2019 from North Point, Nyaung Oo Phee Island, Myanmar, facing the Andaman Sea (10.087 N 97.963 E), at the depth of approximately 22 m. Total DNA was extracted using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN) and processed using the Collibri™ PS DNA Library Prep Kits for Illumina Systems (Invitrogen). Paired-end sequencing (300 cycles) was conducted using HiSeqX (Illumina) of Macrogen Japan Corp., with 150 bp read length and additional inserts of ca. 100 bp for a total of approximate 16 million reads. Assembly was performed using CLC Genomics Workbench ver. 12 (QIAGEN) with the default setting. Gene identification was made using the MITOS web server (Bernt et al. 2013). The voucher specimen is deposited in the National Museum of Nature and Science, Tsukuba, Japan (NSMT E-13912).\n\nThe mitogenome of E. godeffroyi (GenBank/DDBJ/EMBL accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"LC704718\",\"term_id\":\"2217812577\",\"term_text\":\"LC704718\"}}LC704718) is 16,410 bp long and encodes 13 proteins, two rRNAs, and 22 tRNAs for a total of 37 gene products. The overall A + T content is 64.0%, which is slightly lower than that of other apodid species (Sun et al. 2021). Unlike other sea cucumber mitogenomes, COX1, ND4L, and ND1 start with GTG codon. All other protein-coding genes (PCGs) start with the ATG start codon. Eight of PCGs stop with the termination codon TAG, other five of PCGs (CYTB, ND2, ND3, ND4, and ATP6) end with TAA codon. Although previously three variations of the gene orders of 13 PCGs and rRNAs were known in the class Holothuroidea (Sun et al. 2021), the gene order of E. godeffroyi did not match those of any recorded holothurian mitogenomes. The gene order of E. godeffroyi shows unique arrangement with COX3 following after COX1, and ND3 located next to ND6 ( )."
