        "text": "Sea cucumbers are invertebrate animals found both in tropical and subtropical oceans. They are habitats of inter-tidal zones and deeper waters. Sea cucumbers are characterized by cylindrical or tubular structure resembling very much to cucumbers and hence, got the name sea cucumber. There are more than 1100 species listed under this group. Sea cucumbers belong to the class Holothuroidea in the phylum Echinodermata (meaning spiny-skinned) and divided into three subclasses namely Dendrochirotacea, Aspidochirotacea, and Apodacea. Under these subclasses there are six orders named as Aspidochirotida, Apodida, Dactylochirotida, Dendrochirotida, Elasipodida and Molpadiida (Connad 2004, Ridzwan 2007). The name holothuroid was given by the Greek philosopher, Aristotle (“holos: whole” and “thurios: rushing). The scientific name of sea cucumber, “Cucumismarimus”, was coined by an invertebrate taxonomist Pliny (Fell 1972). Their Latin name is Stichopus chloronotus. Sea cucumbers are widely used as food delicacy in all South east Asian countries. It is also called trepang or balata. According to publications in Chinese traditional medicines (Tang Weici, 1987.; Zhang Enchin 1988) sea cucumbers can improve human immune status enforcing resistance to many diseases and even have anticancer properties. Chinese name for sea cucumber is haishen meaning “ginseng of the sea” because ginseng, a plant belonging to the family Araliaceae, has similar medicinal properties. The sea cucumber is valued-along with several other delicacies, such as shark’s fin, ginseng, cordyceps, and tremella-as a disease preventive and longevity tonic. It was listed as a medicinal agent in the Bencao Congxin (New Compilation of Materia Medica) by Wu Yiluo in 1757. It is often known in medical literature as fangcishen (fang = four-sided, ci = thorny; referring to the spiky protrusions that emanate from four sides) or, in abbreviated form, fangshen (Subhuti Dharmananda)."
