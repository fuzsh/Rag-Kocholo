        "text": "Tunisia occupies a strategic biogeographic position in the Mediterranean Sea and the Strait of Sicily is considered a biogeographical boundary that separates the eastern and western basins. Despite the importance of marine biodiversity in Tunisia, the few studies of Echinodermata fauna in this region data from long ago. In order to update and produce a validated checklist of the echinoderms that occur in northern Tunisia, a study of this phylum was carried out between 2012 and 2016. Forty-five species were inventoried and distributed into the five living Echinodermata classes (Crinoidea, Asteroidea, Ophiuroidea, Echinoidea and Holothuroidea). New occurrences of four species from Tunisian marine waters [Asterina pancerii (Gasco, 1876), Luidia atlantidea (Madsen, 1950), Ophiactis virens (Sars, 1859) and Leptopentacta tergestina (Sars, 1857)], are cited and discussed here for the first time.\n\nMolecular and morphological data were used to evaluate the taxonomic status of the species Holothuria tubulosaGmelin, 1790, Holothuria stellatiDelle Chiaje, 1823, Holothuria mammataGrube, 1840, and Holothuria dakarensis Panning, 1939, belonging to the nominate subgenus Holothuria (Holothuria) (family Holothuriidae) from the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. A 16S rRNA marker distinguished three well-supported clades with clear genetic differentiation amongst them. The morphometric characters, although they reflected the clades, showed great variability, and some specimens from different clades overlapped. The morphological data and the literature suggest that the clades correspond to H. dakarensis (from Cape Verde Islands), H. mammata (from the Atlanto-Mediterranean area) and H. tubulosa (from the Mediterranean Sea). Holothuria stellati is considered here to be a junior subjective synonym of H. tubulosa. Great morphological intraspecific variation within H. tubulosa and H. mammata explains the confusion in the literature. Holothuria tubulosa includes specimens with distinctive ossicles, but others are similar to H. mammata. In these cases, the presence or absence of Cuvierian tubules proved a reliable indicator to the identity of these species; unfortunately this character is difficult to assess in preserved material. According to the results of discriminant analysis we propose a set of ossicle morphometric variables that permit the optimum assignation of individuals to the clades. Our results present a new perspective on the taxonomic status of species in Holothuria (Holothuria), and show how a molecular approach, combined with a morphological approach, can solve taxonomic problems.\n\nEchinoderms, exclusively marine animals, present a great diversity and are an important and very ancient phylum. Whether they are predators, vegetarian or scavengers, echinoderms frequently dominate the ecosystems in which they are subservient. Benthic macrofauna and particularly echinoderms acting directly on the functioning of marine ecosystems, represents the fundamental link in the food chain and an essential source of food for many consumers. There has been very little work on the echinoderms found in the western Algerian coast. The objective of this work is to conduct an inventory on the echinological fauna in the intertidal zone, including the description of the morphological and ethoecological characteristics of the echinoderms in their ecosystem. To this end ten stations were surveyed. For each station, a random sampling was performed on hard substrates found in the coast of Oran. The identification of species and faunal analysis permitted to identify six species belonging to this phylum with a presence of 55.17% of Echinoids (Echinoids), 34.8% of sea cucumber (holothurian) and 10.34% of starfish (Asteroidean).\n\nThe island of Rodrigues, Mauritius, has recently been established as a producer for the expanding beche-demer industry and there is a critical requirement for information concerning its resident holothurian populations. The current study aimed to provide baseline data regarding the distribution of holothurian species inhabiting its shallow lagoon. During July and August 2006, a total of 1,678 holothurians were recorded at 41 survey sites (7,380 m2 ), representing six aspidochirotid, one apodid and one dendrochirotid species. It was estimated that 48.3 million holothurians inhabited the lagoon. The most dominant and widespread species was Holothuria atra (71.68% of individuals). The next most common species were H. leucospilota, Stichopus chloronotus and Synapta maculata (11.08%, 10.85% and 5.24%). The exploited species Actinopyga mauritiana was rarely observed (0.66%). Differences between lagoon region and habitat type were examined. Species distributions were heterogeneous, and three areas have been distinguished for their abundant holothurian fauna. The northeast region harboured high mean densities of H. leucospilota, Stichopus chloronotus and Synapta maculata (0.233, 0.367 and 0.106 m-2 ) and exhibited significantly higher species diversity (Hâ€™ = 0.638) than other regions. The highest overall mean densities were found close to shore at the western end of the island, comprising predominantly H. atra (maximum 0.728 m-2 ). Species distributions were strongly related to the measured percentage cover of vegetation, as well as that of sediment. Overall density was significantly greater at vegetation sites than coral/rubble and sediment sites (0.354, 0.177 and 0.193 m-2 ) and diversity was significantly lower at sediment sites than coral/rubble and vegetation sites (0.116, 0.482 and 0.470). Diversity correlated positively with percentage cover of macroalgae and rubble, and negatively with percentage cover of sediment. There were few clear patterns in length for different species. H. atra displayed a negative relationship between length and population density, and length was significantly greater at coral/rubble sites than sediment and vegetation sites (18.98, 15.72 and 14.47 cm). Substratum and shelter associations of holothurian species closely reflected site habitat characteristics. H. atra and H. leucospilota were primarily associated with sediment substrata, and Stichopus chloronotus and Synapta maculata were associated with rubble substrata. Individuals of H. leucospilota and Synapta maculata were frequently under cover (55.5%), whereas H. atra, Stichopus chloronotus and other species were mostly uncovered (90.3%). Recommendations for sustainable management of holothurian resources are proposed."
