        "text": "This study aimed to determine phylogenetic relationship between and among selected species of sea cucumbers (Echinodermata: Holothuroidea) using 16S mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. Phylogenetic analyses of 37 partial sequences of 16S mitochondrial rRNA gene using three main methods namely neighbour joining (NJ), maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) showed the presence of five main genera of sea cucumbers: Molpadia from order Molpadiida and four genera of order ...\n\nSome materials in the Natural History Museum, London, originating from various parts of the world, proved on examination, to comprise two new species herein described as Cladodactyla pesdispersa n. sp. and Thyonina rasidae n. sp., and a new subspecies, Havelockia ferali andamanensis n. subsp. In addition, some specimens examined from the museum collections of the Department of Aquatic Biology and Fisheries, University of Kerala in India contained, besides the well-known dendrochirotids, Aslia forbesi (Bell) and Stolus buccalis (Stimpson), two specimens which proved to also represent a new species of Thyonina, herein described as Thyonina bijui n. sp., as it differs significantly from T. rasidae n. sp. from Pakistan and the South African T. articulata Vaney. For the genus Thyonina, currently attributed to the subfamily Thyoninae, a new subfamily Thyonininae is here diagnosed. In addition a new subfamily Hemithyoninae is proposed for Hemithyone semperi (Bell), also placed in the Thyon...\n\nThis molecular phylogenetic analysis of 18S ribosomal RNA (18SrDNA) gene sequences from 16 species of holothuroid, suggests strong support for an alternative taxonomic scheme to replace the existing classification. When trees drawn from the 18S rDNA data were constrained to show expected relationships between the holothourid orders, they were significantly worse than the best tree under SH tests. These analyses indicated strongly that the subclass Aspidochirotacea is paraphyletic. Sequences from the order Dendrochirotida grouped with aspidochiroitid sequences, with high bootstrap support, to the exclusion of the elasipod sequence. In line with recent morphological studies the order Apodida were a basal sister group to the other three holothuroid orders examined and the Dendrochirotida was a derived holothuroid order."
