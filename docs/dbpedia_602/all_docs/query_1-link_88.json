        "text": "Description\n\nSimilar to the brown cucumber, the hairy cucumber is found in subtidal, seagrass beds of the Gulf and Caribbean. Growing only to 2 inches long, it has grayish podia (feet) scattered all over its body with only those on the lower surface having suckers.\n\nWhat Are The Effects On Clams?\n\nThis sea cucumber is a detritivore, meaning that it feeds on organic wastes. In doing so, it can consume clam feces and pseudofeces, removing these wastes from the clam bag.\n\nFRIEND\n\nWhat Can A Clam Farmer Do?\n\nNo action needs to be taken by a clam farmer.\n\nDescription\n\nThe mottled sea hare is found in seagrass beds and protected sand flats of shallow waters where macro algae (sea grasses) are abundant. This swimming species is extremely variable in color, with the background color varying from yellow brown, brown gray, green or black, and is relatively large, growing up to 10” long. Sea hares are so called because of the fancied resemblance of the second pair of antennae to a hare's long ears, and the similarity of the animal's general shape to that of a crouched hare. Like their namesakes, sea hares are herbivorous, eating eelgrass and a variety of red, green, and brown algae from whose pigment they derive their color. An interesting feature is that they emit a cloud of purple mucus when disturbed.\n\nWhat Are The Effects On Clams?\n\nThis large “shell-less”snail has a voracious appetite for sea lettuce and can help keep clam bags free of macro algae.\n\nFRIEND\n\nWhat Can A Clam Farmer Do?\n\nNo action needs to be taken by a clam farmer.\n\nDescription\n\nHumans are bipedal (two-legged) apes belonging to the great ape family. Humans have a highly developed brain capable of abstract reasoning, language, and introspection. This, combined with an erect body carriage that frees their upper limbs for manipulating objects, allows them to make greater use of tools than any other species. Like most primates, humans are by nature social. However, humans are particularly adept at utilizing systems of communication for self-expression and the exchange of ideas. Humans inhabit every continent with a total population of over 6.5 billion people as of 2006.\n\nWhat Are The Effects On Clams?\n\nFirst and foremost, humans are consumers of clams, and purchase clams grown by farmers for consumption. Humans live in coastal areas, often in sight of clam aquaculture leases. Their activities on land, such as waste disposal, placement of dwellings (zoning density), and use of fertilizers and pesticides, can affect the quality of inshore waters, the management plan of the shellfish harvesting area, and the safety of shellfish for human consumption. Humans also use inshore coastal waters for boating, fishing and recreational activities, as well as other commercial activities, such as crabbing. Sometimes these activities can cause problems for clam farmers and their crops. In particular, clam bags can be cut by a motor’s propeller when a boater runs over a lease at low tide. Further, some growers use SCUBA or hookah rigs to work their crops on high tides or on deeper leases. Unaware boaters could potentially snag this equipment causing harm to the diver. Finally, one of the biggest predators of clams is human. Losses of cultured clams from theft can be significant.\n\nFRIEND, FOE, NEIGHBOR\n\nCompetitor\n\nPredator\n\nWhat Can A Clam Farmer Do?\n\nEducation is the key. To increase consumption of clams, a clam farmer, as well as wholesalers and retailers, must provide information to the public about the nutritional value of clams and tips on how to store, handle, and prepare clams. Marketing brochures and recipes are available through the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Bureau of Seafood and Aquaculture Marketing. <HYPERLINK TO http://www.fl-seafood.com/recipes/clam_recipes.htm>. A clam farmer must educate their neighbors as to the economic and environmental importance of clam farming to ensure land use regulations and practices are favorable to maintaining and preserving water quality standards for shellfish harvesting. A clam farmer must also educate boaters, informing them of the location of lease areas as well as the activities conducted on their farms. Educational signs placed at marinas, boat ramps, and on aquaculture lease markers can be used to provide appropriate warnings to the public. Further, growers must display a Diver-Down flag when using SCUBA gear or hookah rigs on their leases. Although control of human predators is problematic, cultured clams are protected by state law (Chapter 812.014, Florida Statues). Stealing of clams is grand theft of the third degree and a felony of the third degree. Some clam farmers must employ security measures, such as continuous surveillance, in order to prevent significant losses due to theft. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services provides a reward of up to $2,500 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of individuals unlawfully possessing or harvesting cultured shellfish. Violations are to be reported to 1-800-DIAL-869.\n\nDescription\n\nDespite its name, the comb jelly, or sea walnut, is not a jellyfish, as it is in a phylum all its own. It is comprised of two oval lobes with two small tentacles, and appears transparent. It is lined with four rows of cilia along the body, which help it move through the water. The cilia appear iridescent during the day and luminescent at night. The comb jelly is indigenous to Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico estuaries and inshore waters, though was recently introduced to the Black and Caspian Seas via ballast tanks of ships. Being a voracious predator of zooplankton, fish eggs and larvae, the comb jelly has had a catastrophic effect on the Black and Caspian Sea ecosystems. They are hermaphroditic, bearing both male and female organs, and have the capability of self fertilizing. The comb jelly can grow up to 4 inches in length.\n\nWhat Are The Effects On Clams?\n\nThe comb jelly is rarely found in clam bags, but during the warmer months these animals can be found in \"bloom\" or large numbers that can greatly reduce the amount of zooplankton (microscopic animals) in the water column. When this happens, there is more phytoplankton (clam food) available for clams.\n\nFRIEND\n\nWhat Can A Clam Farmer Do?\n\nNo action needs to be taken by a clam farmer.\n\nDescription\n\nThe sandy sea quirt is a mud or sand colored solitary tunicate, commonly found along Florida and the Gulf of Mexico coasts. It is usually covered in mud or sand engrained into the animal, making it feel like sandpaper and resembling a ball of sand. The tunic, or thick tissue covering the sea squirt is tough and wrinkled while the mantle tissue is bright orange at the siphons. The incurrent and excurrent siphons are not spaced very far apart, and are used to filter plankton out of the water and bring oxygenated water into the respiratory organs. When picked up and squeezed, they release water from their excurrent siphon in a tight stream, thus the name “sea squirt.” Tunicates are primitive chordates, making them more closely related to humans than any other invertebrates. They can reach 2.5 inches in length.\n\nWhat Are The Effects On Clams?\n\nSea squirts (tunicates) are filter or suspension feeders and can compete for the same type of food (micro algae) as clams. This tunicate does not attach to a surface; rather it settles inside a clam bag, usually before the bag is completely buried.\n\nFOE\n\nCompetitor\n\nWhat Can A Clam Farmer Do?\n\nAlthough these animals can compete with clams for food, they are generally not found in high enough numbers to cause a problem. No practical control method is necessary.\n\nDescription\n\nThe sea onion is a sea anemone that ranges from New England to the Gulf of Mexico. It is a burrowing anemone, found in coastal sandy areas, and can burrow up to 14 inches into the sand using a ventral attachment disk. It is translucent, with white longitudinal stripes running along the body. It contains up to 180 tentacles, brown in color due to the presence of zooxanthellae (one-celled plants that live inside cells and tissues of various invertebrates). Often only the short tentacles can be seen, used to catch drifting plankton. If disturbed, it will puff up into an onion-shaped mass and drift with the current to a new location.\n\nWhat Are The Effects On Clams?\n\nAlthough this anemone is a filter feeder and can potentially compete with clams for food, it most likely catches larger planktonic organisms than clams. It is rarely found in numbers high enough to cause a problem.\n\nFOE\n\nCompetitor\n\nWhat Can A Clam Farmer Do?\n\nNo practical control method is necessary.\n\nDescription\n\nThe green sea cucumber lives in mud flats and sea grasses and is usually found in less than 20 feet of water. Its elongate body can appear brown, mottled brown, greenish-brown, or completely black. Its thick skin is covered with bumpy calcareous spicules (small structures which support tissues of some soft-bodied invertebrates). Tube feet are arranged in double rows along its body with more rows on the bottom side. Tips of the tube feet may be red due to the presence of hemoglobin. The animal lives in a U-shape burrow with tentacles and anus projecting above ground. Their paired round holes can be seen in the bottom sediments spaced from one to three inches apart. Ten dark-brown tentacles are laid on the sediment or swept through the water to pick up detritus, which is sucked from the tentacles when placed in the mouth. This sea cucumber can grow up to 6 inches in length.\n\nWhat Are The Effects On Clams?\n\nThis sea cucumber is a detritivore, meaning that it feeds on organic wastes. In doing so, it can consume clam feces and pseudofeces, removing these wastes from the clam bag.\n\nFRIEND\n\nWhat Can A Clam Farmer Do?\n\nNo action needs to be taken by a clam farmer.\n\nDescription\n\nThe white synapta prefers sandy and muddy sediments in depths less than 3 feet, and sometimes is found in association with seagrasses. The body of this worm-like sea cucumber is fragile, smooth and translucent white, allowing the internal organs to show through. Five white longitudinal muscle bands are visible through the body wall. No tube feet are present; rather a series of calcareous plates are used for attachment. Twelve retractable, feather-like tentacles, each with 5-7 branches on the opposite sides of the stalk, surround the mouth. The body is buried under the mud while its tentacles extend on the surface to pick up detritus. Its burrow is surrounded by small mounds of fine sand with a central opening ¼ inch wide. The white synapta reaches 6 inches in length and 3/8 inches in width.\n\nWhat Are The Effects On Clams?\n\nThe white synapta is a detritivore, meaning that it feeds on organic wastes. In doing so, it can consume clam feces and pseudofeces, removing these wastes from the clam bag.\n\nFRIEND\n\nWhat Can A Clam Farmer Do?\n\nNo action needs to be taken by a clam farmer."
