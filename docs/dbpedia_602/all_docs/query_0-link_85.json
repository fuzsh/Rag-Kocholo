        "text": "2.4 Diversity\n\nThe size of the dataset restricts the methods that can be used to assess diversity, as computationally intensive methods such as the Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent method [25] cannot be used here. Other programs cannot accommodate such large dataset, and failed to complete the analysis (e.g. PTP [26], AGBD [27]). We assessed species boundaries and diversity in three ways.\n\nFirst, we used traditional morphological characters and current species concepts across the class to identify species to currently valid species names. For this assessment we used these names at face value, although we are aware of cryptic morphological variation in many species we have studied in depth, and such variation likely also exists in many less-studied forms. Overall, 89 morphospecies could not be assigned to a name. Some of the material included in this study was provided to us as tissues, and the specimens were not evaluated to be identified with confidence. For some groups, taxonomic understanding is limited, and species names cannot be assigned accurately. Therefore, a proportion of the morphospecies for which we could not assign a name might match already described species, but others are undescribed.\n\nSecond we used the evolutionary significant unit (ESU) concept (sensu [10]) to evaluate diversity within the holothuriids (= family Holothuriidae vs. holothuroids = class Holothuroidea). They were the most densely sampled and comprise almost half (47%) of our dataset; they are also the focus of our taxonomic work and are the best known to us at the morpho-species level to assign all individuals to ESUs. Individuals were assigned to ESUs based on differentiation in at least two independent characters (e.g., reciprocal monophyly in COI, morphology, ecology, restricted geographical range).\n\nThird, we used mtDNA sequence data on its own for lineage delineation (mtLineages) based on thresholds [7, 1]. We grouped individuals that differed from each other by a genetic distance below a given threshold (“pairwise” method). This method is strictly based on genetic distance and does not take into account phylogenetic information. We also identified monophyletic groups from Neighbor-Joining trees, reconstructed from pairwise genetic distances (“clustering” method). Groups were defined based on coalescence depths that were below a threshold set a priori.\n\nFor each of these two threshold-based approaches, we used both uncorrected distances (p) and the Kimura two-parameter (K2P) model [23] to estimate genetic distances. The K2P model is very widely used when analyzing barcoding data, but a recent study indicated that p distances are probably more appropriate when comparing genetic distances between closely related species and may lead to higher rates of identification success [28]. We estimated the number of species recovered from our sample while varying the pairwise threshold value: 0.01,0.015,0.02,0.025,0.03,0.035,0.04,0.045,0.05,0.06, 0.07, 0.08. Additionally, we estimated the proportion of singletons (proportion of the number species represented by a single individual) for each of these threshold values.\n\nTo assess the accuracy of the pairwise and clustering methods, and the most appropriate threshold, we compared the manually delineated ESUs to the mtLineages estimated by these methods in the Holothuriidae. We tested which method (pairwise or clustering) and which threshold recovered most closely the manually delineated ESUs (closest estimated number and lowest error rate). We measured the error rate of the threshold-based approaches by recording the number of ESUs that were oversplit (one ESU included more than one mtLineage) or lumped (one mtLineage included more than one ESU) for each threshold.\n\n4.2 Species limits\n\nThe ESU approach provides guidelines for identitying of biological species. Even if correlation between independent traits does not guarantee that ESUs are biological species, the concept demonstrates lack of gene flow and provides a powerful indirect test for reproductive isolation [7]. More than 94% (N=138) of ESUs identified for the Holothuriidae are reciprocally monophyletic in COI and are morphologically distinct, making them natural targets for taxonomic revision. The ESUs that are not reciprocally monophyletic for COI sequences are either (1) monophyletic but their closest neighbor is separated by distances lower than the maximum intra-ESU distances (10 out of 15 ESUs), or (2) not monophyletic. Interestingly the 5 ESUs that are not monophyletic all belong to the subgenus Halodeima: 3 ESUs of Holothuria edulis, H. mexicana and H. floridana. Additionally, 2 species of Actimpyga, each represented by a single individual are paraphyletic with Actinopyga species (A.flammea and A. caerulea are indistinguishable from A. palauensis). Other species outside the Holothuriidae are also found to not form reciprocally monophyletic lineages (e.g., the Stichopus “variegatus” complex in the Stichopodidae).\n\nFunk and Ormland [9] estimated that 23% of the 2,319 animal species they surveyed were nonmonophyletic in their mitochondrial genealogies. Such species may not be distinguishable with DNA barcoding, and this high proportion has been used as an argument against the method (e.g., [32]). Funk and Omland found that the proportion of polyphyletic species was negatively correlated with the intensity of study, indicating that inadequate taxonomy was an important source of this error, and may have inflated their results. Here, we recovered similar rates of non-monophyly when considering currently defined morphospecies (17%, N=90), but much lower rates when using ESUs defined by integrative taxonomic study ESUs (6.1%, N=9). Careful taxonomic investigation is thus required to ensure accurate estimation of non-monophyly, and to highlight biologically interesting cases.\n\nThree hypotheses can explain the absence of reciprocal monophyly in these well-studied morphologically distinct species. First, these species might have diverged very recently leading to incomplete lineage sorting. During the sorting of gene copies that split before the divergence of the species, the lineages will first appear polyphyletic, then paraphyletic, and will finally form reciprocally monophyletic groups [33]. The time taken to pass through these stages will depend on how rapidly drift will remove the apparently incorrectly sorted lineages. Second, species could have acquired mitochondrial copies from each other through introgressive hybridization, masking earlier differentiation. Third, the putative morphospecies could represent phenotypic variation within a single species.\n\nIntrogression appear uncommon among marine invertebrates (see [14] for examples of introgression in Australium), but has been reported in echinoderms (e.g. [34, 35]). Two instances of hybridization between sea cucumber species have been documented [36,31]. However, in both cases hybrids do not appear to backcross with their parental species limiting the possibility for genomic introgression. Teasing out the processes that are leading to non-monophyletic patterns observed in COI requires multilocus dataset, which analyzed with the multicoalescent [37] might provide support for reproductive isolation among the putative species (see [4]). Recently developed methods that use single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) across the genome [38] appear as powerful tools to explore species limits among closely related taxa. These approaches remain expensive and time-consuming but come in complement of single-locus studies to untangle the lineages that are not monophyletic.\n\n4.4 DNA barcoding for species identification in sea cucumbers\n\nOne of the main applications of DNA barcoding is to facilitate species identification, especially when only non-diagnostic parts are available (e.g., when processed for trade [43], in larvae [44], for gut contents [45]). Accurate identification requires a comprehensive database of DNA sequences to capture the diversity of species, as well as intra-specific variation. If the sequences for the individuals to be identified have exact matches in the reference database, the accuracy of the identification will only depend on the proportion of species that share haplotypes. However, commonly, these unknowns will not be in the database, and the accuracy of a positive identification will also depend on the accuracy with which the sequence can be predicted to belong to a species included in the database, and the probability that species included in the database share unsampled haplotypes. The accuracy with which a sequence can be predicted to belong to a species included in the database is related to the proportion of species that are not monophyletic.\n\nIn our ESU dataset, if the unknown sequences have an exact match in our database, individuals can be identified with high accuracy through DNA barcoding, as only 7 out of 194 ESUs (3.6%) share haplotypes. If the unknown sequences belong to ESUs that are not reciprocally monophyletic, or that are characterized by higher intra-ESU distances than the distance to the closest neighboring ESU, they will likely be misidentified. Together with the non-monophyletic ESUs, they represent 8.2% (N=16 ESUs) of our ESU dataset.\n\nSequences without a match in reference databases are typically assigned to a sampled species if the sequences differ by less than a threshold, or are considered as unsampled species if the genetic distances are above this threshold [7]. This is typically done either in the context of pairwise genetic distances or in the context of the closest match in a Neighbor-Joining tree. Thresholds are estimated based on the extent of overlap between intra-and interspecific genetic variation among the species considered, the barcoding gap. One of the issues associated with this concept is that increased sampling reduce, and often eliminate, the barcoding gap by capturing closely related yet good species, or rare, divergent haplotypes that increase the overlap between intra-and interspecific variation [7, 32]. More recent methodological developments account for the distance to the nearest neighbor to determine whether a sequence represents an unsampled species [46], or use a machine learning approach to detect features in the sequence that allow species identification [47].\n\n4.5 Geography of diversification\n\nUnderstanding the geographic context of speciation can inform the nature and strength of evolutionary forces that are driving reproductive isolation [48]. Additionally, understanding the factors that limit how soon after diverging in allopatry species can co-occur, or how often – if ever species – might be able to diverge in sympatry, may contribute to the heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of species diversity. In oceans where organisms might disperse over large distances and barriers to dispersal are rare, opportunities for geographic isolation seem limited. However, species with shortlived larvae are expected to have smaller geographic ranges, and higher levels of genetic differentiation across their ranges.\n\nWe detected a consistent pattern of isolation-by-distance for the three orders we sampled more thoroughly despite differences in dispersal potential. Our results suggest that on average, ESUs sampled across larger geographical ranges show higher levels of genetic differentiation. Nevertheless some species show remarkable powers of dispersal, sharing haplotypes across the entire Indo-Pacific, from Africa to America. The type of larva does not seem to affect the amount of genetic differentiation expected across the range as evidenced by the common slope and intercept estimated across orders. However, the Dendrochirotida with their lecithotrophic larvae, have smaller range sizes than the orders with planktotrophic larvae. Both Apodida and Aspidochirotida have ESUs that span the entire Indo-Pacific while only a few Dendrochirotida have ESUs that span either the Indian or the Pacific oceans. These results suggest that the type of larvae influence patterns of diversity and modes of diversification.\n\nDendrochirotida species tend to have restricted ranges, with many species known only from single localities, and species within a genus are often strictly allopatric. In the Indo-Pacific, most species of Dendrochirotida are restricted to continental areas, with Afrocucumis africana being the only species that reaches the Central Pacific. This pattern could be explained by the combination of limited dispersal abilities that make the insular Pacific difficult to reach, and the suspension feeding mode of this group that cannot inhabit the oligotrophic environments that characterize oceanic islands [49].\n\nHowever, as some Dendrochirotida species are panmictic across continental areas of the Indian Ocean, dispersal limitation seem unlikely lending support to the importance of ecology to explain the distribution of this group.\n\nAs species of Apodida and Aspidochirotida can maintain connectivity across very large distances, opportunities for allopatric speciation are limited. Nevertheless, most sister ESUs were found in allopatry indicating the importance of geographical isolation in the diversification of sea cucumbers. Allopatric speciation appears to be the most common mode in animals [48] and is also the most prevalent mode in marine organisms (e.g., [14, 17]). Well known biogeographic barriers have served to drive speciation as evidenced by allopatric sister ESUs in the Holothuriidae straddling these. Basinal separation between the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and isolation of Red Sea/Arabia and Hawaiian archipelago were the three most important barriers for cladogenesis (Fig. 8).\n\nThe connection between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean was restricted several times throughout the Pleistocene [50] which could have contributed to the isolation and divergence of the species across the Indo-Pacific Barrier (IBP). The IBP is a recognized marine biogeographic barrier, and in a recent review, 15 out of 18 species of fish and invertebrates surveyed showed genetic differentiation across this barrier [51].\n\nThe Hawaiian archipelago and the Red Sea are well recognized areas of endemism in the IndoPacific [52, 17, 53, 54]. The Hawaiian archipelago is remote and its endemics are thought to have originated through peripatric speciation events [17, 54]. The Red Sea is separated from the Indian Ocean by a narrow strait, which in combination with areas of upwelling along the Arabian coast, likely limit population connectivity with the rest of the Indo-Pacific. This, in combination with its peculiar oceanographic conditions, maintains the distinctiveness of the fauna. However, the Red Sea experienced several salinity crises, the latest as early as ca. 19,000 years ago [53]. Therefore, the Red Sea fauna must have colonized the area from outside refugia following the salinity crises.\n\nUnderstanding how these barriers drive speciation events across these biogeographic barriers is key to uncovering the mechanisms generating diversity within the Indo-Pacific. Three models have been proposed to explain how these barriers might be acting [55]. A model of classic vicariance emphasizes the importance of large-scale events (e.g., geological) that split an ancestral population into populations that diverge in isolation. A modified version of this model (“soft vicariance”) proposes that long-distance gene flow connects diverging populations that eventually become separated by changes in oceanographic conditions. Under a peripatric model, a new population is founded by the colonization of a small number of individuals from a larger source population [55]. Additionally, determining whether sister species separated by the same barrier, diverged concomitantly could inform on the relative importance of extrinsic factors (e.g., geology, climate) vs. intrinsic factors (e.g., selection) in generating diversity. Our analyses limit the inference on the nature of these barriers and whether they affected all species synchronously, however, the spread of genetic distances (Fig. 7) suggests multiple events. Determining the model of speciation that best explains the patterns of divergence would require additional analyses such as [56, 55]. Hodge et al [54] showed that coral reef fish species endemic to the Red Sea diverged steadily through time, while species endemic to the Hawaiian archipelago diverged in two pulses (0-3 million years ago [Mya] and 9-13 Mya). Our data for Hawaii is limited, but consistent with these results as the lowest divergence is for 2 species of the Holothuria impatiens complex with divergences estimated at 2 Mya ([4]).\n\nCompared to studies on other taxonomically well-understood marine organisms, we recovered a higher proportion of sister ESUs occurring in sympatry for the Holothuriidae. For instance, sister ESUs are almost always allopatric in oceanic settings for molluscs (e.g., [14, 57, 58]) and arthropods (one out of 40 ESUs for hermit crabs in [17]). In contrast, we recovered several closely related and sympatric ESUs that exhibit distinct color patterns and/or ecology, show low-levels of differentiation in, or in some cases cannot be separated by, COI sequences alone. If these forms represent distinct species (as their morphology and biology suggest, a pattern we also found in other holothuroids and echinoderms), it would indicate that they have diversified more rapidly than most marine invertebrates. Additionally, in our study many closely related ESUs occur in sympatry, indicating that reproductive isolation can be completed rapidly. For instance, we showed how 3 ESUs in the Holothuria impatiens complex, occur in sympatry even though they diverged less than 2 millions years ago [4]. Four out of the eight complexes with three or more ESUs, have ESUs with overlapping ranges. This contrasts with other marine organisms, for which secondary sympatry in oceanic settings occurs slowly and takes at minimum 2 millions years but often more than 10 millions years [14, 59, 17, 60].\n\nThis difference could be the result of sympatric speciation, more rapid secondary sympatry (speciation occurred in allopatry, but the resulting species extended their ranges, and are now sympatric), or a sampling artifact (the actual sister species have not been sampled). If speciation in complete sympatry remains controversial, recent studies have shown that selection along depth gradients [61], host shifts [62] or other forms of selection (reviewed in [18]) might promote divergence even with some levels of gene flow.\n\nRapid acquisition of reproductive isolation could arise from premating isolation barriers such as differences in the timing of gamete release or gametic incompatibilities caused by the gamete recognition proteins (GRPs). GRPs are known to evolve rapidly and play a critical role in fertilization success of many free spawning marine invertebrates such as sea urchins [63, 64] and gastropods [65]. For instance, strong positive selection has been detected in the GRPs between closely related species of sea urchins in sympatry but not in allopatry [66], suggesting the role of these proteins in maintaining species limits. GRPs have not yet been identified in sea cucumbers but bindin is known from sea urchins [64] and sea stars [67] which indicates that it is plesiomorphic in the clade that sea cucumbers emerged from."
