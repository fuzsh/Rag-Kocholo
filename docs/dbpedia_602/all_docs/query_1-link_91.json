        "text": "Some materials in the Natural History Museum, London, originating from various parts of the world, proved on examination, to comprise two new species herein described as Cladodactyla pesdispersa n. sp. and Thyonina rasidae n. sp., and a new subspecies, Havelockia ferali andamanensis n. subsp. In addition, some specimens examined from the museum collections of the Department of Aquatic Biology and Fisheries, University of Kerala in India contained, besides the well-known dendrochirotids, Aslia forbesi (Bell) and Stolus buccalis (Stimpson), two specimens which proved to also represent a new species of Thyonina, herein described as Thyonina bijui n. sp., as it differs significantly from T. rasidae n. sp. from Pakistan and the South African T. articulata Vaney. For the genus Thyonina, currently attributed to the subfamily Thyoninae, a new subfamily Thyonininae is here diagnosed. In addition a new subfamily Hemithyoninae is proposed for Hemithyone semperi (Bell), also placed in the Thyon...\n\nThis paper includes several nomenclatural changes in dendrochirotid holothuroids, mostly based on materials from the USNM. These include the erection of a new genus Pseudostolus for two Indo-Pacific Stolus species [(S. kilberti Rajpal & Thandar, 1999 and S. rapax Koehler & Vaney (1908)], re-assignment of Havelockia uniannulatus (Sluiter, 1914), Thyone pseudofusus Deichmann 1930, T. parafusus Deichmann, 1941 and T. axiologa H.L. Clark, 1938, to the genus Stolus, and re-assignment of Havelockia nozawai (Mitsukuri, 1912) and Thyone adinopoda Pawson & Miller, 1981 to the genus Sclerothyone Thandar, 1989. In addition, a lectotype is designated for (T. vilis Sluiter, 1901), based on the study of type material at the ZMUA. The Caribbean Stolus cognatus is also described and commented on and a single, perhaps juvenile specimen from the Gulf of California is described as Thyone ? n. sp.\n\nAs each new species evolved, the ossicles changed with it, so each species has uniquely shaped ossicles. Examination of gross morphology and microscopic ossicles showed that this species is Holothoria atra. Color uniformly black or dark brown; when alive body usually covered with sand coating of sand which may also serve to keep it cool by protecting it from the sun&#39;s rays. , except for several pairs bare patches dorsally; tables with reduced but sometimes spinose disc. The importance of detailed reproductive biological studies on Holothuria atra are necessary due to its important role in the conservation of the marine environment. This species found on subtidal sand and grassbed, 3to 4 m depth at Kish Island. Distributed throughout most of the tropical Indo-Pacific area. Holothoria atra, is a holothurian of order Aspidochirotes belonging to the family Holothuriidae genus Holothuria. It is deposit-feeder and is mainly found on sandy bottom of fringing reefs surrounding the Kish ...\n\nThree shallow holothuroid species are recorded for the rocky shoreline of the Kermadec Islands. The new apodid species Chiridota kermadeca sp. nov. is described. Two dendrochirotid species are reported, both previously found in New Zea-land: Plesiocolochirus ignavus (Ludwig, 1875) and Pseudocnus sentus O&#39;Loughlin & Alcock, 2000. Résumé Trois espèces peu profondes d&#39;holothuries ont été observées sur le rivage rocheux des îles de Kermadec. Deux d&#39;entre elles appartiennent à deux espèces de dendrochirotid également connues de Nouvelle Zélande: Plesiocolochirus ignavus (Ludwig, 1875) et Pseudocnus sentus O&#39;Loughlin & Alcock, 2000. La troisième espèce: Chiridota kermadeca sp. nov., nouvelle pour la science, est décrite."
