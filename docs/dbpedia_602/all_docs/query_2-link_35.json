        "text": "We study the structure, indicator species and diversity of treelets and shrubs vegetation in tropical sub-mountain forests of Mount Salak Bogor, West Java. There were 4 vegetation groups at Bray-Curtis distance 0.6 - 0.8, namely groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, each consist of 13 plots, 17 plots, 8 plots, and 22 plots. One way Permanova test shows that the vegetation group is different in terms of structure and composition of vegetation. Dicranopteris dichotoma (Thunb.) Bernh., Athyrium sorzogonense (Presl.) Milde., and Cinchona officinalis L., are the species with the highest Important Value Index in all plots. Indicator species are not found in group 2. There are 8 combined vegetation groups that have indicator species. The one-way Kruskal-Wallis test shows the difference in Shannon-Wienner diversity index (H’) (Kruskal-Wallis χ2 = 20.541, df = 3, p-value = 0.0001311 ), Simpson’s index (D) (Kruskal-Wallis χ2 = 23.855, df = 3, p-value = 2.678e-05), Pielou’s evenness index (J’) (Kruskal-Walli...\n\nYusuf S, Beger M, Tassakka ACMAR, Brauwer MD, Pricella A, Rahmi, Umar W, Limmon GV, Moore AM, Jompa J. 2021. Cross shelf gradients of scleractinian corals in the Spermonde Islands, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 22: 1415-1423. Coral reef ecosystems around the world have suffered extensive degradation, including the reefs of the Wallacea region within the Coral Triangle global biodiversity hotspot. Anthropogenic and natural threats can reduce the level of coral reef biodiversity differentially across environmental or impact gradients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes in hard coral (Scleractinia) diversity and community structure across an inshore-offshore zonation gradient in the Spermonde Islands, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Data on coral colony species and abundance as well as live coral cover were collected from 10 m 2 belt transects at a depth of 6 to 8 m. A total of 72 transects were placed around the 12 island stations in three zones: the inner mid-shelf zone, outer mid-shelf zone and outer shelf zone. Data were analyzed to determine the species richness, and three ecological indices for the hard coral communities were calculated: the Shannon Diversity Index (H'), Similarity Index (E), and Dominance Index (C). A total of 310 hard coral species belonging to 62 genera were recorded. The coral communities were dominated by the genera Fungia, Montipora and Porites, and coral cover was in the 'moderate' category. The number of species was directly proportional to the number of colonies within each zone. Live coral cover was higher in the inner mid-shelf zone and outer shelf zone than the outer mid-shelf zone; conversely, the species richness and coral colony abundance were higher in the outer mid-shelf zone. However, the differences were not statistically significant. The indices H', C, and E did not differ significantly between the zones. However, Tambakulu Island in Zone 4 had the lowest values of E and H' and the highest value of C. Findings suggest that most-hard coral communities in the cross-shelf zones of the Spermonde Islands are stable communities characterized by relatively high diversity and low dominance indices.\n\nWaterbirds are a significant part of mangrove forests due to their ecological role in the ecosystem. However, land conversion, human disturbance, pollution, and other anthropogenic factors are continued to give pressure to the existence of waterbirds, especially in the urban mangrove area. Therefore, this study aims to identify waterbirds habitat types and analyze its abundance and diversity at Lantebung Mangrove Ecotourism Area, Makassar City. Bird survey was done during three days, morning and afternoon, by walking along the peripheral of fish ponds and mudflats behind mangrove forest using binocular to identify waterbirds habitat types, kinds of species, and to count total individuals. The result shows there are four types of waterbirds habitat at Lantebung Mangrove Ecotourism Area, which are mangrove, mudflats, inactive fish ponds, and bushes. There are 18 species identified, with medium diversity (Shanon Weiner Diversity Index of 1.029), medium richness (Margalef Species Richness Index of 2.918), and stable species evenness (Hill Species Evenness Index of 0.356). Species with the highest abundance is Chadrius .sp with Relative Abundance Index 27%."
