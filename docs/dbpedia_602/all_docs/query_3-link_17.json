        "text": "Sea cucumbers like Molpadia intermedia are part of a larger group called Echinodermata that also includes sea stars, brittle stars, and sea urchins.\n\nSuperficially, sea cukes don’t look much like their echinoderm kin, but they all have three characteristics in common:\n\nA water vascular system made up of tubes and valves which allows movement, digestion, and breathing by pumping water throughout the body.\n\nPentaradial symmetry — the body is organized in five symmetrical sections.\n\nAn internal skeleton containing calcium carbonate.\n\nGet under your skin\n\nIn the case of sea cucumbers, the internal skeleton takes the form of tiny particles called ossicles, embedded in the outer skin. Taxonomists can identify sea cucumbers by examining the shape of their skin ossicles under a light microscope.\n\nM. intermedia has two kinds of ossicles:\n\n“Tables” — flat plates with tall, narrow spires\n\nPlates shaped like tennis racquets, filled with tiny holes\n\nIn addition to ossicles, M. intermedia has something else lurking inside its skin: tiny iron- and phosphate-rich blobs called phosphatic bodies. You can see these microscopic orange blobs in the image to the right above. The animals get more of these as they get older. Scientists think these granules serve to strengthen the connective tissue in the skin.\n\nNo foot to stand on\n\nSea cucumbers typically have rows of tube feet running the length of their bodies; however, M. intermedia lacks tube feet, giving it a smooth and shiny appearance. Its soft, cylindrical body has muscles running its length. These muscles can expand to lengthen it (up to 43 cm) or contract to shorten it into a little ball when it is disturbed.\n\nAt one end of its body is a mouth surrounded by 15 feeding tentacles. These short, finger-like tentacles help push food into its mouth as it ingests sediment while burrowing. At the rear end of its body is a short, stubby tail.\n\nCouch Potato\n\nM. intermedia seldom moves, making it an easy target for its main predators, including the sand star, Luidia foliolata, and fish. In some areas, M. intermedia lives in densities of up to 15 per square meter, and individuals tend to aggregate in groups of two to six. Talk about a sea cucumber buffet!\n\nCritter of the month\n\nOur benthic taxonomists, Dany and Angela, share their discoveries by bringing us a benthic Critter of the Month. Dany and Angela are scientists who work for the Marine Sediment Monitoring Program. These posts will give you a peek into the life of Puget Sound’s least-known inhabitants."
