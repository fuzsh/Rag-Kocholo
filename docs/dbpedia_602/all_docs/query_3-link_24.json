        "text": "The beautiful sand of Emily Bay, Norfolk Island, didn’t get there by accident. It is the direct result of the hard pooping work of generations of marine animals, including among other things, parrotfish (see my blog post The Sand Poopers) and sea cucumbers.\n\nI confess to not having paid much attention to sea cucumbers until recently. And only now am I doing so because they seem to be on the wane inside our lagoons. A few people have asked me where they have gone. I have no idea, but one thing I do know is that they are important members of our ecosystem on many different levels. For example, they clean and aerate the sand, plus, there are some quite rare critters in our lagoons, such as the Tonna melanostoma (a type of mollusc), whose only food is the sea cucumber.\n\nBut first some fast facts:\n\nthey are part of a family called echinoderms (great article!), along with sea stars and sea urchins\n\nthey have tube feet, like tentacles, that they use to move\n\nthey breathe through their anus\n\nthey feed on the algae and tiny marine creatures found in the sand that they shovel in using the little tube feet that surround their mouths\n\nas a defence they will propel their own toxic internal organs from their bodies (eviscerate) at their attacker\n\nthey reproduce both sexually – which is more usual – by releasing eggs (females) and sperm (males) into the water column at the same time, and asexually, by splitting in two\n\nthey can live for between five to ten years\n\nthey live on the sea floor\n\nthey can grow as big as 1.8 metres in length\n\nthey are considered a delicacy in some cultures and can therefore be subject to overfishing.\n\nSo, putting aside the part of me that finds these things a little unappealing, I thought I’d do some research and find out exactly what part sea cucumbers play in the ecosystem here on Norfolk Island’s reef.\n\nAnd, to be honest, I couldn’t go past this brilliant description of their role, posted by the Melbourne-based environmental group Remember The Wild on their Facebook page.\n\nSea cucumbers are far more active than you might believe of an animal named after a table vegetable, and play an important role in nutrient cycling in marine ecosystems!\n\nAs they slowly slug their way across the seafloor, looking like various colourful sausages, they eat algae-covered sand and strip out the organic matter for their dinner.\n\nBehind them they leave trails or piles of the cleanest sand imaginable, like tiny streetsweepers.\n\nAs they eat their way around the reef, they reduce the levels of decaying organic matter in the environment, recycling it into useful nutrients (like phosphorus and nitrogen) for other animals and plants.\n\nAs they churn through the sand, they help mix oxygen through the layers, helping the tiny lifeforms that live in the sediment grow and prosper.\n\nYou see, despite their size, slow lifestyle and lack of brain, sea cucumbers have a massive role in their environment and are vital for healthy reefs!\n\nSo next time you’re marvelling at the purity of the fine white sand on that tropical beach, remember that you’re actually sitting on a lovely beach of poo, and thank your local sea cucumbers for their service."
