        "text": "There are 5 related classes in the phylum Echinodermata (the Latin name means \"spiny-skinned\"). For a detailed list with all classifications click here:\n\nSea star or starfish (Asteroidea)\n\nBrittle stars, basket stars, serpent stars (Ophiuroidea)\n\nSea urchins, heart urchins and sanddollars (Echinoidea)\n\nHolothurians or sea cucumbers (Holothuroidea)\n\nFeather stars and sea lilies (Crinoidea).\n\nCharacteristics of Echinoderms\n\nEchinoderms are characterized by radial symmetry, several arms (5 or more, mostly grouped 2 left - 1 middle - 2 right) radiating from a central body (= pentamerous). The body actually consists of five equal segments, each containing a duplicate set of various internal organs. They have no heart, brain, nor eyes, but some brittle stars seem to have light sensitive parts on their arms. Their mouth is situated on the underside and their anus on top (except feather stars, sea cucumbers and some urchins).\n\nEchinoderms have tentacle-like structures called tube feet with suction pads situated at their extremities. These tube feet are hydraulically controlled by a remarkable vascular system. This system supplies water through canals of small muscular tubes to the tube feet (= ambulacral feet). As the tube feet press against a moving object, water is withdrawn from them, resulting in a suction effect. When water returns to the canals, suction is released. The resulting locomotion is generally very slow.\n\nEcology and range of Echinoderms\n\nEchinoderms are exclusively marine. They occur in various habitats from the intertidal zone down to the bottom of the deep sea trenches and from sand to rubble to coral reefs and in cold and tropical seas.\n\nBehavior of Echinoderms\n\nSome echinoderms are carnivorous (for example starfish) others are detritus foragers (for example some sea cucumbers) or planktonic feeders (for example basket stars).\n\nReproduction is carried out by the release of sperm and eggs into the water. Most species produce pelagic (= free floating) planktonic larvae which feed on plankton. These larvae are bilaterally symmetrical, unlike their parents (illustration of a larvae of a sea star below). When they settle to the bottom they change to the typical echinoderm features.\n\nEchinoderms can regenerate missing limbs, arms, spines - even intestines (for example sea cucumbers). Some brittle stars and sea stars can reproduce asexually by breaking a ray or arm or by deliberately splitting the body in half. Each half then becomes a whole new animal.\n\nEchinoderms are protected through their spiny skins and spines. But they are still preyed upon by shells (like the triton shell), some fish (like the trigger fish), crabs and shrimps and by other echinoderms like starfish which are carnivorous. Many echinoderms only show themselves at night (= nocturnal), therefore reducing the threat from the day time predators.\n\nEchinoderms serve as hosts to a large variety of symbiotic organisms including shrimps, crabs, worms, snails and even fishes.\n\nCharacteristics of sea stars (or starfish)\n\nSea stars are characterized by radial symmetry, several arms (5 or multiplied by 5) radiating from a central body. Mouth and anus are close together on the underside, the anus is at the center of the disc together with the water intake (madreporite). The upper surface is often very colorful. Minute pincer-like structures called pedicellaria are present. These structures ensure that the surface of the arms stay free from algae. The underside is often a lighter color.\n\nThere are a few starfish that have 6 or 7 arms, for example Echinaster luzonicus or Protoreaster, some even more like the elven-armed sea star (Coscinasterias calamaria). Others normally have 5 arms but now have more arms, because after an injury an arm divided and grew into two arms.\n\nEcology and range or sea stars\n\nThe starfish lives everywhere in the coral reef and on sand or rocks.\n\nBehavior of sea stars\n\nThe majority of sea stars are carnivorous and feed on sponges, bryozoans, ascidians and molluscs. Other starfishes are detritus feeders (detritus = organically enriched film that covers rocks) or scavengers. Some starfish are specialized feeders, for example the crown-of-thorns that feeds on life coral polyps.\n\nStarfish have no hard mouth parts to help them capture prey. The stomach is extruded over the prey, thus surrounding the soft parts with the digestive organs. Digestive juices are secreted and the tissue of the prey liquefied. The digested food mass, together with the stomach is then sucked back in. This method can be observed, if you turn around a starfish, that sits on prey or sand - you will see the stomach retreating.\n\nStarfish are well known for their powers of regeneration. A complete new animal can grow from a small fragment such as a arm. In some species (Linckia multifora and Echinaster luzonicus) one of the arms will virtually pull itself away, regenerates and forms a new animal. Autotomy (self amputation) usually is a protective function, losing the body part to escape a predator rather than being eaten. But here it serves as a form of asexual reproduction. In other species of sea stars (Allostichaster polyplax and Coscinasterias calamaria) the body is broken into unequal parts (= fission) then the missing limbs regenerate.\n\nPredators of starfishes\n\nTritonshorn - Charonia tritonis\n\nHarlequin Shrimp - Hymenocera elegans\n\ncoral crab - Trapezia sp\n\nHarlequin Shrimp is carrying a sea star - Hymenocera elegans\n\nThe crown-of-thorns (Acanthaster planci) is one of the largest and the most venomous starfishes. It can reach 50 cm diameter and has numerous (10 to 20) spiny arms with formidable thorn like toxic spines. Don't touch them! A species of small cardinalfishes (Siphamia fuscolineata) and a commersal shrimp (Perliclimenes soror) live among those spines. The crown-of-thorns feed on live coral polyps. They \"graze\" the corals which are left behind white and dead. Their predators are the giant triton shell (Charonia tritonis) and some puffer fish. Scientist have also found out, that some crown of thorns are deterred from eating the coral polyps by the small crabs living among the coral branches (Trapezia sp). These crabs defend their coral host by breaking them off at the pedicellaria. Other small crabs (Tetralia sp) only pinch the tube feets of the starfish. Crown of thorns prefer corals, that are not hosts to these crabs.\n\nThe cushion star (Culcita nouvaeguineae) doesn't look like a starfish at all, more like a large sea urchin without spines. Its pentagonal appearance gives only the slightest indication that this organism is related to other starfish.\n\nCharacteristics of feather stars\n\nFeather stars also known as crinoids. They are characterized by radial symmetry. The body of a typical feather star is cup-shaped, their numerous feathery arms project from a central disc. Some have five arms, others as many as 200. The arms, called pinnules are coated with a sticky substance that helps to catch food. There are appendages known as cirri attached to the underside of the body with which they cling to to sponges or corals. Both their mouth and their anus are situated on the upper side.\n\nEcology and range of feather stars\n\nFeather stars are primarily nocturnal but they are seen in the open during the day with their arms rolled up.\n\nBehavior of feather stars\n\nFeather stars can crawl, roll, walk and even swim but usually they cling to sponges or corals. Feather stars are very abundant in areas exposed to periodic strong currents, because they feed on plaktonic food.\n\nCharacteristics of brittle stars\n\nBrittle stars are close relatives of sea stars. Characterized by radial symmetry with a central body from which five snakelike arms protrude. The arms are highly flexible. There is no replication of internal organs, just one set in the central disk. Compared to starfish, brittle stars have a much smaller central disc and no anus. Wastes are eliminated through the mouth which is situated on the underside center.\n\nOn the underside of the body disk there is a splitlike opening at the base of each side of each arm. These ten openings are breathing and reproductive outlets, taking in water for oxygen and shedding eggs or sperm into the sea.\n\nThe basket stars are a specialized type of brittle stars. They have a series of complexly branched arms which are used to catch plankton.\n\nSerpent stars are seen coiled snakelike around branches of gorgonians.\n\nEcology and range of brittle stars\n\nBrittle stars are very cryptic and hide in crevices under corals. Best seen at night time, when they emerge to feed on plankton. Usually at places exposed to strong currents.\n\nSerpent stars feed mostly on small invertebrates like mollusks, worms and crustaceans and are generally found in crevices and beneath rocks or in holes in the sand.\n\nSnake stars (for example Ophiothela danae) are found entwined in the branches of black corals or gorgonians where they feed on the rich mucus of their host, in turn performing cleaning functions.\n\nBehavior of brittle stars\n\nAs the name suggests, the arms of the brittle stars are rather liable to break. This is actually an escape mechanism. Those arms regenerate quickly and an entire new organism can regenerate, if the broken arm is attached to a seizable portion of the disk. Brittle stars can reproduce asexually by self-division. Brittle stars are the most active and fastest moving echinoderms.\n\nBrittle stars feed on plankton but also on detritus, coral-shed mucus, bottom detritus (detritus = organically enriched film that covers rocks), mollusks and worms.\n\nCharacteristics of sea urchins\n\nRadial symmetrical body with a external chitinous skeleton and a centrally located jaw (called Aristotle's lantern) with horny teeth. The mouth consists of a complex arrangement of muscles and plates surrounding the circular opening. The anus is located on the upper surface. Some sea urchins have a spherical, bulb like cloaca (to store fecal material) that protrudes from the anal opening. It can be withdrawn into the shell.\n\nDepending on the species, movable spines of various sizes and forms are attached to the body. These spines often are sharp, pointed and in some cases even venomous. Pincer like pedicellaria for grabbing small prey. Some pedicellaria are also poisonous.\n\nEcology and range of sea urchins\n\nRubble and sand. An abundance of sea urchins can be a sign for bad water conditions.\n\nBehavior of sea urchins\n\nLocomotion by tube feet but also by movement of the spines on the underside of the body. Sea urchins are generally nocturnal, during the day they hide in crevices. However some sea urchins such as Diadema sometimes form large aggregations in open exposed areas. Despite their sharp spines sea urchins are easy game for some fishes, particularly triggerfishes and puffers. A triggerfish grabs the sea urchin with its hard beak like mouth by the spines or it blows some water towards the sea urchin and turns it on its back. The underside of a sea urchin has much shorter spines and those are easily crushed. During the breeding season the body cavity is crammed with eggs or sperms. This is one of the main reasons urchins are so attractive to fish predators (Japanese also like them for the same reason).\n\nMany animals live in symbiotic relation with sea urchins. Even on the poisonous spines of the fire urchin (Asthenosoma varium) small shrimps (Periclimenes colemani) can be found. One shrimp (Stegopontonia commensalis) is striped black and white lengthwise and perfectly camouflaged and lives in spines of the long-spined sea urchin (Diadema setosum). Some cardinalfishes and juvenile shrimpfishes also like to take shelter in-between these spines, but even small cuttlefish hide there. It has been observed, that they change their coloring also to black and white. Some flatworms wrap around the thicker spines of the diadema sea urchin (Echinothrix calamaris).\n\nThe mandarin dragonet (Mandarinfish) lives close to congregations of sea urchins and hides among them if threatened.\n\nThere are two specialized types of sea urchins with an unusual appearance: the sand dollar is very much flattened with very small spines and the heart urchin which are oval and have bristle like spines. The both bury in sand. The heart urchin \"jumps\" out of the sand, when disturbed.\n\nCharacteristics of sea cucumbers\n\nUnlike other echinoderms, holothurians don't have a distinct radial symmetry but are bilateral (distinct dorsal and ventral side). Holothurians are also called sea cucumbers. As their name suggests, they are cucumber shaped with an elongated, muscular, flexible body with a mouth at one end and the anus at the other. Around the mouth there is a number of tentacles (modified tube feet) used in food collecting. Sea cucumbers come in many sizes, from small species only a few centimeter in length to long snakelike animals which may stretch up to 2 meter!\n\nEcology and range of sea cucumbers\n\nRubble, rocks and sand. Also seen on some sponges in large aggregations.\n\nBehavior of sea cucumbers\n\nMost species feed on the rich organic film coating sandy surfaces. The crawl over the bottom ingesting sand. The edible particles (organic matter such as plankton, foraminifera and bacteria) are extracted when passing through their digestive tract and the processed sand is expelled from the anus (as worm-like excrements).\n\nSea cucumbers move by means of tube feet which extend in rows from the underside of the body. The tentacles surrounding the mouth are actually tube feet that have been modified for feeding.\n\nOther holothurians feed on current-borne zooplankton. They bury in sand extruding their featherlike tentacles (Pseudocolochirus violaceus, Neothyondium magnum or Pentacta crassa). The tentacles have the same shape as soft corals or some anenemones. Large congregations of some small species are found on sponges. They apparently feed on substances secreted by the sponges as well as detritus from the surface.\n\nSome species of holothurians have separate sexes others are hermaphrodites. The sea cucumbers hold on to exposed rocks or corals, raise their body to a upright position, rock back and forth and release the sperm and eggs into the sea."
