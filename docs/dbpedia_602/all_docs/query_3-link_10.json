They live in the benthic zones of most tropical and subtropical oceans, especially:\n\nAustralia and New Zealand\n\nThe Indian Ocean\n\nWestern Pacific Ocean\n\nScuba divers and snorkelers often spot them embedded in the sand or on silty sediment on the seafloor, often crawling between coral reef gardens and other solid habitats, such as rock or boulder outcrops.\n\nSea Cucumber Characteristics\n\nUnlike most marine creatures, sea cucumbers are sloth-like scavengers that slowly roam around searching for food scraps on the sea bed.\n\nWhen they feed, they ingest small particles of sand to break down detritus and other organic matter and process it inside their gut.\n\nHere's the thing:\n\nThey use bacteria to decompose their food. As a consequence of that, this digestion process creates sea cucumber poop (faeces) that help to increase the potential of hydrogen (pH levels) around the reef.\n\nWhen different types of sea cucumber defecate, the positive effect for the water may help coral reef polyps combat the negative effects of global climate change. Thus, soft-bodied sea cucumbers are helping to reduce harmful high levels of acidity in the oceans.\n\nThe cylindrical body, often warty in appearance, can be as little as two centimetres long and less than a centimetre thick, or it can be up to two metres long (6 feet) and measure twenty centimetres round (8 inches).\n\nHow Do Sea Cucumbers Help the Ocean?\n\nThere is another benefit from the waste, calcium carbonate. Scientifically known as CaC03, calcium carbonate is an important component for the survival of the reef. This is because corals need to accumulate high levels of CaC03.\n\nSea cucumbers, along with other tropical \"bioeroders\" (e.g. sea urchins, marine worms, and chitons), are foremost contributors to the essential turnover of calcium carbonate.\n\nWhen sea cucumbers digest the food, they also produce ammonia - which helps to fertilise the near vicinity. It also provides important nutrients which, in turn, encourage coral formation.\n\nBenefits of Sea Cucumber Taxonomy\n\nThere are more than one thousand different species of sea cucumber that exist in the oceans, and they all have an important role to fulfil underwater.\n\nFor example, the poop of the amber fish sea cucumber has benefits for aquatic ecosystems. It has a crown of tentacles that it uses to pick up sediment and stuff it into its mouth.\n\nThis sea cucumber phylum is renowned for digesting organic material and discarding everything else.\n\nSo, what comes out is actually cleaner than when it went in!\n\nThe \"cleaner\" sand helps to prevent algal blooms, which can cause fish to suffocate due to a lack of oxygen.\n\nFurthermore, subtropical seagrass beds seem to grow healthier if sea cucumbers are living in the area. Therefore, coral reefs benefit from the alkalinity of the droppings from sea cucumbers by \"buffering\" them from the effects of ocean acidification.\n\nFun Fact: We were wondering what a group of sea cucumbers is called? To our surprise, the collective noun is a prickle of sea cucumbers.\n\nDifferent Types of Sea Cucumber\n\nActinopyga Caerulea\n\nBlue sea cucumber\n\nActinopyga Echinites\n\nDeep water redfish\n\nApostichopus Californicus\n\nThe giant red sea cucumber is one of the heaviest of the species, with some specimens weighing up to one (1) kilogram (2.2 pounds).\n\nApostichopus Japonicus\n\nBohadschia Argus\n\nLeopard sea cucumber\n\nColochirus Robustus\n\nRobust sea cucumber\n\nHolothuria Floridana\n\nFlorida sea cucumber\n\nHolothuria Fuscogilva\n\nWhite teatfish\n\nHolothuria Nobilis\n\nBlack teatfish\n\nHolothuria Scabra\n\nOrange-Footed Sea Cucumber\n\nSnot Sea Cucumber\n\nStrawberry Sea Cucumber\n\nSynapta Maculata\n\nThe snake sea cucumber is the largest sea cucumber with some examples growing to three (3) metres in length (10 feet).\n\nThelenota Anax\n\nAmber fish sea cucumber\n\nDivers also enjoyed reading about..."
