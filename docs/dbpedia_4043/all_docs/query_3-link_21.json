        "text": "True Aggie\n\nIn 1916, several students from Salt Lake City founded the Beno Club. In 1916, the Benos erected their ýheadstoneý on campus, a \"Block A,\" which was placed to the west of the Mechanic Arts Building.\n\nIn the late 1930s, the monument was moved to the front of the Library, at the east end of the Quad. When construction began on the Merrill Library in the early 1960s, the Block A went into storage. In 1967, past students, alumni, and older faculty members campaigned to have the Block A returned to the Quad, where it was erected atop Old Main Hill, just northwest of the Main Building.\n\nThe Block A has stood as a traditional monument to aggie spirit. Campus tradition dictates that only those who kiss while sitting on the Block A, under a full moon, can be \"true aggies.\"\n\nDivergent stories exist as to the founding of the Benos. One story claims that the Salt Lake City students, while still in high school, had approached their principal at West High about starting a club. The principal's response was that there would \"be no\" clubs. The experience stayed with the young men, and when they came north to attend the UAC, Carl \"Stubby\" Peterson, one of the students, suggested they use the name for a club on campus.\n\nAnother story involves student pranksters affiliated with one of the clubs on campus during the time period who greased the trolley tracks coming up 500 North to College Hill. The episode so infuriated President Widtsoe, that he reportedly told the student body that there would \"be no more clubs.\"\n\nWhatever its derivation, the Beno Club performed a conspicuous amount of service on campus. In 1926 the club affi liated nationally with the Intercollegiate Knights, adopting the motto of \"service, sacrifice, and loyalty.\"\n\nToday one can become a \"True Aggie\" by receiving a kiss on the \"A\" under a full moon at midnight by somebody who already is a \"True Aggie,\" or on Homecoming or A-Day by somebody who is not. The True Aggie tradition is run by the Student Alumni Association.\n\n\"Wilster is now making lacto ice cream which has never before been produced in Utah,\" noted Student Life. While instructive, the creamery was also operated on a commercial basis, and students and visitors to campus could purchase cheese, butter, or generous portions of ice cream at the Dairy Products Laboratory in the Animal Science Building. Ice cold buttermilk could generally be had for the asking. The first taste of Aggie Ice Cream became a rite-of-passage on campus, and is fondly remembered by many students and alumni.\n\nPeople loved it so much, more flavors were created. Now, Aggie Ice Cream has 26 different flavors and is known around the world.\n\nWhy is it so good? Well, Aggie Ice Cream has a 12% butterfat content. It's aged slightly longer and contains less air than most commercial brands.\n\nSo how is it known around the world? A Korean USU student named Duk-Man Lee loved the ice-cream so much, he devised a plan to take it home with him. He gathered a group of Korean business men, who proposed the idea to USU, and in June 2000, the first international Aggie Ice Cream was opened in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nNot only that, but Aggie Ice Cream was also the first ice cream to make it to outer space, thanks to USU's aerospace technologies division.\n\nPaul Bunyan\n\nStudents in the School of Forest, Range and Wildlife organized a Forestry Club in 1928, and in honor of their newly appointed Dean, Paul M. Dunn, inaugurated an annual \"Paul's Party\" in 1938.\n\nAs part of the festivities, members presented Dunn with a huge wooden statue of the \"patron saint of all true foresters,\" Paul Bunyan. The event was offi cially recognized in 1939 as Forester's Week. The celebrations included competitions, along with a good share of bravado and hi-jinx involving the forester's \"arch rivals,\" the engineers.\n\nDuring the 1939 festivities, the Forestry Club arranged with Logan's radio station KVNU to broadcast its assembly. It was the first radio broadcast made from the College auditorium. Additionally, club members commandeered the Student Life offices, and began the tradition of publishing a special Forester's Week edition. According to reports, the \"engineers had a lot to say about the activities, and ended up kidnapping Paul Bunyan from the fourth floor of our building and holding him for ransom of 500 tickets\" to the Forester's Ball. When the Foresters refused to pay the tribute, the engineers hung Paul from the entrance of the Engineering Building - \"much to the delight of the engineers and amusement of the student body at large.\"\n\nThe following year, in \"partial payment for the gross insult...\" the foresters burned an effi gy of an engineer on the front steps of the Engineering Building, \"while the engineers stood helplessly by and watched with tears in their eyes.\" The engineers made several attempts to again abscond with Paul, but each \"attempt was neatly curbed (but sometimes not so gently) by the ever alert and well organized Foresters.\"\n\nDuring the war years, the depleted student body declared a hiatus for Forestry Week. In 1946, however, the foresters and engineers resumed their feud, with the engineers seizing the opportunity early during fall quarter to kidnap Paul Bunyan. The foresters searched in vain for their lost \"idol,\" who eventually showed up on April 1st, at the beginning of Forestry Week, hanging from the campus flagpole.\n\nDuring succeeding years the foresters/engineers feud became increasingly more bitter. In 1947 for instance, unable to get their hands on Paul, the engineers kidnapped the Queen of the Forestry Ball, Lenore Hansen, drove her to Pocatello, Idaho, and sequestered her in a motel room. As \"friendly\" competitions became ever more rough, and pranks ever more dangerous, the College Administration declared an end to hostilities and to Forestry Week in 1953.\n\nThe large footprints of Paul Bunyan's boots which appear painted on campus sidewalks each spring, are the only hint of the once vibrant, sometimes raucous, Forestry Week of more than 50 years ago.\n\nThe new venue made the homecoming celebration possible, and on October 11, 1930 the College invited the University of Colorado to Logan to help inaugurate the event. The Football Homecoming Committee was assisted in planning for the event by the College's Athletic Council, the Alumni Association, the Associated Students, and the Logan Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe days events included pep rallies; patriotic flag ceremonies involving ROTC students; a downtown parade featuring floats by Bingham Cafe, J.C. Penney, Ford Motor Company, Needham Jewelers, Logan Hardware and other local merchants; and a procession to the stadium featuring sororities and fraternities, the Benos and Spurs (who had busily manufactured special pop poms in Aggie blue and white). All the past Aggie lettermen who could be located were also involved. One thousand of the best seats in the stadium were reserved for returning alumni.\n\nAlthough extraordinary, the pre game festivities were only prelude to what Student Life reported as \"one of the most thrilling contests ever staged...\" Pundits had picked Colorado as the clear favorite to take the Rocky Mountain Conference championship, having lost only one game the previous season to the University of Utah, who went undefeated. While the Aggies had already notched two conference wins, and were tied for fi rst place, they were underdogs to Colorado, who had yet to play a conference game. The Aggies battled the \"silver and gold\" to a scoreless tie, in which the Aggie defense held the goal line on six separate occasions. The Aggies threatened four times to score, but were similarly rebuffed by Colorado.\n\nA standing room only crowd witnessed the College's first Homecoming Game. The new stadium repeatedly filled to capacity as the Aggies consistently fielded highly competitive teams during the 1930s.\n\nOne of the most memorable teams was the squad from 1936. This Rocky Mountain Conference champion team included Bernard Magnusson, Tracy Maero, Dallas Greener and fi rst team All-American half-back Kent Ryan in the backfield; with Elvin Wayment, Edwin Peterson, Gerald Mathews, Edward Wade, and Clark White on the line. Team Captain Robert Bunker and Carl Mullenaux were at the end positions. The 1936 team went undefeated, tying the University of Denver 0 to 0 before holding both BYU and the University of Utah scoreless.\n\nRobins Awards\n\nThe Robins Awards are the most coveted of all Utah State honors. They reward students and faculty for hard work and dedication to their individual goals, as well as the goals of USU.\n\nThe awards memorialize William E. Robins, a campus hero who had a rare quality to turn his vision into Utah State's vision. Robins was a Sigma Nu at Utah State who served as USU's student body president in 1949. He was the primary and initial visionary of today's Taggart Student Center.\n\nIn 1954, Bill and wife Geraldine died in a plane crash, leaving behind a one-year old orphan boy. This prompted Bill's fraternity to set up a fund so the boy could go to USU when he was ready. Tragically, the boy died at the age of eight from leukemia. Since then, the fund has been used to continue the Robins Award tradition.\n\nEach year, the gallant event is held in the evening, and several awards are presented. The ceremony is followed by the Spring Formal dance. Throughout the years, the name of Bill Robins has stood as a symbol of the best efforts students can offer. As a memorial to him, the night's feature award is called the Bill Robins Memorial Award. Other awards include: Achievement of the Year, Woman of the Year, Man of the Year, Organization of the Year, and the Val R. Christensen Service of the Year."
