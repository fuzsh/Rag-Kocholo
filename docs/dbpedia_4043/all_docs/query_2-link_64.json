The following are acceptable alternatives:\n\nAdoption records;\n\nValid passport or other federal government identification;\n\nMilitary identification or immigration card;\n\nValid Kentucky driver's license or permit;\n\nPrior school records (other than FCPS) identifying the student by name and date of birth; or\n\nStatement: \"At this time, I am unable to provide the school with one of the acceptable forms of proof listed above. I understand that this constitutes a written notice that Kentucky state law requires that I provide the certified birth certificate or one of the above-listed items to the school within 30 days of student enrollment.\"\n\nYou can get a birth-certificate application from the assigned school or from the Fayette County Health Department, 650 Newtown Pike; call (859) 252-2371.\n\n** You may register without these two documents, but your child may not attend school until the immunization certificate is on file with FCPS.\n\nMedical Details:\n\nIf possible, please complete all medical paperwork before the first day of school. (See \"Forms\" below.) For instance, our Child Nutrition Department needs to know about any food allergies, and Health Services needs to know if your child has a medical condition or requires special accommodations.\n\nIf your family moves within Lexington, you must update your address with FCPS. Please contact your school and provide two proofs of residence, such as a property deed or current lease agreement in your name, and a secondary document such as a current utility bill or a current tax bill or receipt.\n\nHowever, if the move puts you in a different attendance zone, you also need to complete an out-of-area request for your children to finish the school year at their current school. Check theSchoolSite Locator tool to see which schools your new neighborhood is assigned to and complete the out-of-area application; select the reason \"My family moved after school started, but I would like my child to attend his/her current school through the end of this school year. We will begin in our new school next year.\" Call (859) 422-0327 for assistance.\n\nIf your family moves during the summer break into a different attendance zone, you should visit the assigned school to register your student under your new address. Be sure to bring two proofs of residence."
