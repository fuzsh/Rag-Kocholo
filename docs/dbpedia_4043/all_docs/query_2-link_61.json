        "text": "School of Education: Vignette #8\n\nAdvancing Justice\n\nBeginning in the early 1970s, the Brazilian educator and philosopher Paulo Freire catalyzed a global movement to use teaching as a tool to confront all forms of oppression, including racism, sexism, and colonialism. Freire’s book, Pedagogy of the Oppressed, first published in 1968, laid the foundation for critical pedagogy at institutions around the world, including at the University of San Francisco’s School of Education. On November 9th and 10th, 2021, the School of Education’s Center for Humanizing Education hosted a two-night celebration honoring the legacy of Paulo Freire on the 100th anniversary of his birth. During the prior four decades, numerous USF School of Education faculty members collaborated with Freire, who had visited USF on several occasions to engage with faculty and students. Susan Katz, professor of international and multicultural education, recalled that “the very first time I stepped onto the USF campus was in 1985 to hear Paulo Freire speak in the chapel on the hill.” His influence on her was enormous. Katz said, “since I was then making the transition from full-time political activist to public school teacher, his words on the revolutionary power of education deeply resonated.” Others who joined the two-night event also noted the influence of Freire on their identities and work as educators. The first evening’s celebration of Paulo Freire’s life and work began with a poem by Janise Powell, a doctoral student in international and multicultural education with a concentration on racial justice. The evening featured a panel discussion with Catherine Murphy, a documentary filmmaker; Alma Flor Ada, School of Education professor emerita; and Patrick Camangian, professor of teacher education. Murphy reviewed her new film, A is for Angicos, which detailed Freire’s early social justice work in Northeast Brazil. Dr. Ada discussed her collaborative relationship with Freire when the two educators co-produced a series of video conversations about participatory research. Dr. Camangian described how Freire established the foundation for his work in humanizing education and how he influenced policy changes in the San Francisco Unified School District and elsewhere. The conversation on the first night was moderated by Shabnam Koirala-Azad, dean of the school and professor of international and multicultural education. During her welcoming address, she said: “Our school has always had a legacy of understanding and addressing the connection between education and justice. This evening, in some ways, allows us to shine a light on this legacy.” The second night, Remembering Paulo: A Space for Our Stories and Encounters, brought together USF faculty, alumni, and community members who had worked with Freire. The evening provided an opportunity for storytelling and remembering as participants reflected on the lasting influence of Paulo Freire.\n\nOn June 15, 2017, Shabnam Koirala-Azad was selected as the new dean of the School of Education, following a nationwide search involving more than 100 prospective candidates. Her deanship represented several firsts in the USF School of Education and in the nation: Koirala-Azad was the first female and first female-of-color dean of the USF School of Education, and the first dean of Nepalese origin in the United States, a feat that was covered widely in the Nepalese media as well. She earned her doctoral degree from the University of California, Berkeley, in social and cultural studies in education, and published extensively in international and comparative education, migration and diaspora studies, alternative research paradigms, and a host of other topics. In her eighteen years at the USF School of Education, Dr. Koirala-Azad served as a faculty member, department chair, associate dean, and interim dean. She secured one of the School of Education’s largest gifts for student scholarships, and she co-founded the school’s master’s program in human rights education, and the Ed.D. concentration in human rights education in the international multicultural education program. This new master’s program and doctoral emphasis in human rights education was the first in the United States, and it reflected Paulo Freire’s profound influence on the school. Dr. Koirala-Azad’s helped develop the curriculum for the program, networked with resources at the university and in the local community, and actively recruited students.\n\nKoirala-Azad launched a strategic prioritizing process in the USF School of education that sought to systematize and enhance the recruitment and retention of diverse students to the education and mental health professions, to build institutional capacity for financial support, communication with key stakeholders, and to elevate the School of Education’s profile regionally, nationally and globally. Today, SOE programs are offered in five different locations, the school continues to be regarded as a leader in social justice education, and the student, faculty and staff reflect the diversity that the school is committed to enhancing in the education and mental health professions. Over 65% of students identify and 50% identify as first-generation college students. 70% of faculty identify as BIPOC and the leadership team is comprised of women of color, education scholars. In 2018, Koirala-Azad was recognized as one of the most influential women in Bay Area Business and also received the USF Diversity and Equity Leadership Award.\n\nIn 2017, the same year that Shabnam Koirala-Azad became dean, Joan and Bob McGrath gave $10 million to USF to expand scholarships for USF’s Catholic education leadership programs in the School of Education, to create a new multidisciplinary student leadership institute, and to expand international student immersion opportunities for undergraduates through endowed scholarships. More than half of the gift was designed to endow fellowships for graduate education students in the renamed McGrath Institute for Jesuit Catholic Education. Joan McGrath earned a master’s degree in theology from USF, has been a loyal supporter of USF for decades, and currently serves on the USF Board of Trustees.\n\nConsistent with Paulo Freire’s education philosophy, and in response to the increasing diversity of California’s public schools, the School of Education created a new degree program in 2009 that focused on teaching in urban schools, the Master of Arts in Teaching: Urban Education and Social Justice. The program, founded by coordinator Noah Borrero and co-coordinator Patrick Camangian, trains future educators to work in urban settings by focusing on the complex learning strengths and needs of urban students from diverse cultural, educational, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Students enter the master’s program as a group of learners, or cohort, and progress through the program in a series of courses, fieldwork experiences, action research, community building, self-reflection, and professional development activities. Students are placed in schools selected for their strength in teaching diverse urban student populations, and graduates become part of a network of justice-oriented teachers and community partners in the Bay Area and California. The urban education and social justice curriculum requires candidates to develop, write, and implement a research project related to justice-oriented urban education. Graduates will thus become teachers and scholars. A preliminary teaching credential is offered in conjunction with the program, and students enroll in special sections of required credential courses, as well as courses required for the master’s degree. In September 2019, Professor Patrick Camangian developed an equity studies framework that he presented to the San Francisco Board of Education, and that served as the basis for SFUSD’s Humanizing Learning Experiences for an All PK-12 policy resolution. The framework ensures that all students are seen and heard in their course work and that each student’s heritage is celebrated.\n\nSince then, all two dozen of the School of Education’s credential, Master’s and Doctoral programs have aligned with the school’s unified aim of advancing justice through education.\n\nThe School of Education’s focus on international justice is reflected in its journal: The USF School of Education's International Journal of Human Rights Education. The journal was launched in 2017, and in 2021, the journal received the Human Rights in High Education Award from the University and College Consortium for Human Rights Education. The award “recognizes an individual, organization, initiative, or publication for its outstanding contribution to human rights education.” The USF School of Education journal provides an international forum for the dissemination of research and experiences by scholars and activists. The online journal was founded by USF students and faculty members in the School of Education, and it is peer-reviewed, open-access, and committed to the dissemination of theory, philosophy, research, and praxis central to the field of human rights education. Since 2017, journal articles have been downloaded more than 25,000 times from individuals living in more than 150 nations. The journal is free and available to download from the USF Scholarship Repository of the Gleeson Library. The original production and editorial team of the journal consisted of eight SOE students (Maria Autrey, Rachel Brand, Brian Davis, Jazzmin Gota, Michiko Kealoha, Lina Lenberg, Lori Selke, and David Tow) and two SOE faculty members (Susan Katz and Monisha Bajaj). Dean Shabnam Koirala-Azad said of the journal and its award: “For almost a decade now, the School of Education, particularly our master’s program in human rights education, has been contributing to the evolving discourse and practice of human rights education,” and the journal “emerged from this commitment and reflects a beautiful collaboration between faculty, students, and alumni towards the generation and diffusion of new knowledge that is so relevant to this moment.”\n\nConsistent with the school’s human rights focus, Professor Daniela Domínguez of the School of Education, was one of several USF professors, staff, and students who made visits to the border between the U.S. and Mexico to support migrants and refugees. In June 2019, Professor Domínguez went to a detention center for undocumented immigrants in McAllen, Texas. She brought art materials for the children placed there, and as a counselor, she worked with the children. Professor Domínguez said, “We talk about drawing the home where they’re going,” and asked the children, “Who’s waiting there for you?” Professor Domínguez believes that “when they see into the future, they go from something traumatic to what makes them hopeful.” In 2022, the School of Education was selected as one of five educator preparation programs in the state to join the inaugural California Educator Preparation Innovation Collaborative (CalEPIC). This network of innovative programs is designed to build the capacity of California educators to support equity, diversity, inclusivity, and the whole child.\n\nIn June of 2023, fourteen students, alumni, and faculty members from the School of Education attended the International Peace Research Association conference in Trinidad and Tobago. The conference has been held since 1964, but it was the first time USF has sent students to it. Members of the SOE delegation presented papers and gave workshops. For example, Michiko Kealoha, who received her Ed.D. in 2022, and Brian Anthony Davis who received his M.A. in 2021, and will receive his Ed.D. in 2024, gave a workshop on “Bias, Equity, and Justice in K-12 and Community Colleges.” Davis said that USF “prepared me well and equipped me with the tools necessary to engage in international conversations around peace, justice, and equity,” Kealoha noted that “to be in community with educators from around the world, United Nations members, and former prisoners of war was surreal.”\n\nThe School of Education at USF has graduated many outstanding leaders since its founding. Vignette #4 highlighted Martha Kanter, appointed by President Barack Obama as Under Secretary of Education in 2009. There are many other SOE alumni who assumed leadership positions and who brought a social justice perspective to those positions. Some of those alumni are noted below.\n\nSuzanne Giraudo, who earned her Ed.D. in Counseling Psychology from USF’s School of Education in 1989, became Clinical Director of the Kalmanovitz Child Development Center Department of Pediatrics at California Pacific Medical Center. She has been active in the Medical Center’s community health programs for over 25 years. Dr. Giraudo also served on the Children and Families Commission for San Francisco for 12 years. In 2019, she was appointed a Health Commissioner to the San Francisco Health Commission, where she chaired the Community and Public Health Committee and represented the Health Commission on the San Francisco General Hospital Foundation. Dr. Giraudo’s professional background includes the development, administration, and supervision of pediatric clinical programs, grant administration, teaching, and clinical work with children and families. She has participated in research and given many presentations in the fields of education, health, child development, and mental and behavioral health. She is the founder and a trustee of the DeMarillac Academy, a Catholic school located in the Tenderloin District of San Francisco that addresses the needs of underserved children and families. Dr. Giraudo is on the advisory board of the University of San Francisco Health Professions. She has served on the boards of many other nonprofit organizations, including the Hamilton Family Center, Home Away from Homelessness Catholic Charities, and Coleman Advocates. She also served as San Francisco Families First Five Commission Chair. Her other civic commitments include with St. Anthony’s Pediatric Clinic, Marin Community Pediatric Program, and the Northeast Medical Services Pediatric Clinics. Dr. Giraudo has been honored for her many contributions with the Bank of America Local Heroes Award, The California Pacific Medical Center’s Presidents Award, and the State Legislature 12th Assembly District Woman of the Year Award. She also received the Fr. Alfred Boeddeker Award from the St. Anthony Foundation for her efforts in championing socially responsible and economically accessible education in San Francisco.\n\nDr. Giraudo co-authored the book, Disastershock: How to Cope with the Emotional Stress of a Major Disaster, which is based on research with children and families after the Loma Prieta Earthquake of 1989, during the Covid-19 pandemic of 2020 and 2021, and during the recent California wildfires. Dr. Giraudo’s co-authors are Brian Gerrard and Emily Giraut, emeriti professors of counseling psychology in the USF School of Education; Vallerie Appleton, who earned an Ed.D. in Educational Psychology from the USF School of Education and serves as dean and professor at Eastern Washington University; and Sue Linville Shaffer, who earned an Ed.D. in Counseling Psychology from the USF School of Education and is a counselor in private practice, working with individuals, families, and groups who need healing following traumatic events. The book provides twenty different cognitive-behavioral, evidence-based, and practical techniques to lower stress and reduce the effects of trauma after disasters. These techniques help adults lower their own stress, and can be employed by parents, teachers, and others working with children. The book also lists relevant publications, videos, and internet resources. All royalties from the sale of the book go to disaster relief.\n\nOnllwyn C. Dixon received his Ed.D. in International and Multicultural Education in 2008 and serves as National Director of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging at Year Up, a San Francisco nonprofit workforce development organization. While at USF, he was selected as an outstanding doctoral student by the faculty of the department of international and multicultural education and served as the vice president for the graduate student association. After graduation, he was an adjunct faculty member in the School of Education for 14 years. He also taught undergraduate courses for the University of San Francisco Muscat Scholars Program from 2007 to 2017. He served as the Education Coordinator for the Booker T. Washington Community Service Center from 2005 to 2008. During that period, he was an academic coach at USF, working directly with academic support services, student disabilities services, international student and scholar services, and the athletics department to strengthen the academic skills of student-athletes, international students, and students with disabilities.\n\nOver the decades, many other School of Education alumni have assumed leadership positions and received honors for their work. Cynthia Rapaido, who earned her M.A. in Organization and Leadership in 1996, and her Ed.D. in International and Multicultural Education in 2011, served in public education for more than 30 years as a high school principal, assistant principal, and science teacher. She was honored with several awards, including the 100 Most Influential Filipina Women in the United States Award from the Filipina Women’s Network; the Secondary Co-Administrator of the Year Award from the Association of California School Administrators; and the Assistant Principal of the Year State Finalist Award for the State of California from the National Association of Secondary School Principals. Susan Cota earned her Ed.D. in Organization and Leadership in 1993, and later became president of Mira Costa College, where she received the 2006 Harry Buttimer Distinguished Administrator Award from the Association of California Community College Administrators. Jan La Torre-Derby earned an M.A. in Educational Administration in 1986, and an Ed.D. in International and Multicultural Education in 1993. She later became the superintendent of the Novato Unified School District. Sandra Stefani Comerford received her Ed.D. in Learning and Instruction in 1999, and she later became dean of the language arts division at the College of San Mateo. Garrett Naiman earned his Ed.D. in International and Multicultural Education in 2016 and is dean of students and associate vice chancellor for student development and engagement at UC Santa Cruz. Mark Hurtubise earned his Ed.D. in Organization and Leadership in 1989, and later became president and CEO of Inland Northwest Community Foundation, now named Innovia. While Hurtubise was president of Inland Northwest Community Foundation, he refused to donate to an organization that was found to promote hate. He stood in opposition to the Northwest Community Foundation board’s initial position on that issue.\n\nMany other School of Education alumni have pursued successful careers in service to their communities. To highlight but a few, Craig Borba earned his Ed.D. in Counseling Psychology in 1984 and became Director of Special Education and Assistant Superintendent of Pupil Personnel Services for the Palm Springs Unified School District. He also consulted on special education design, delivery, and fiscal planning throughout California. For his work, Borba was named state Pupil Personnel Administrator of the Year by the Association of California School Administrators. Judith Miner earned an Ed.D. in Organization and Leadership in 1982, and she became president of Foothill College in Oakland, California. Adrian Peterson earned an Ed.D. in Organization and Leadership in 2016 and became superintendent of the Catholic schools for the Santa Rosa diocese. Doug Evans received an Ed.D. in Catholic School Leadership in 2011 and is principal of Bishop O’Dowd High School in Oakland, California. Prior to Doug Evans, Stephen Phelps, who earned his Ed.D. in Private School Administration in 2003, also served as principal of Bishop O’Dowd High School.\n\nOver the years, many faculty members and administrators at the University of San Francisco have earned their doctorates from the USF School of Education, including the two most recent deans of the University Library. Tyrone Cannon received his Ed.D. in 2007, in learning and instruction. Although Tyrone was already dean when he earned his Ed.D., the program broadened his perspective and, by joining a community of scholars, led to leadership roles in the broader higher education arena. Dr. Cannon served on the Western Association on Schools and Colleges Substantive Change committee for nine years and led teams reviewing curriculum changes at several WASC institutions seeking accreditation or reaccreditation. He served on an international team that reviewed an institution in Kenya, and he led a number of reviews in northern California and one in Hawaii. Dr. Cannon also participated in broader library leadership roles in several national organizations, and he became an adjunct faculty member at the University of North Texas School of Library and Information Sciences. In February 2020, Dr. Cannon was selected to serve as Interim Provost and Vice President of Academic Affairs at USF, the first Black and openly gay individual in the history of the university to hold that position. Cannon believes that his many honors and opportunities were “the result of obtaining my doctoral degree at the School of Education.” He feels that “the curriculum and instruction emphasis was a wonderful and rigorous program. The faculty were first rate and exceptionally supportive.”\n\nShawn Calhoun, USF’s current university library dean, also earned his Ed.D. from the School of Education in learning and instruction. He was associate library dean in 2012, the year he received his doctorate. Following Tyrone Cannon’s retirement, Shawn Calhoun was appointed university library dean in August 2022. At the core of his doctoral work, was the enhancement of his skills as a librarian in the Jesuit tradition, to ensure that USF's library was the best possible place for students, staff, and faculty to learn and grow. Toward that end, Dr. Calhoun believes that his doctoral work helped him “to increase the efficacy and accessibility of the skills librarians teach students—in the Jesuit tradition.” He is also proud of the fact he is part of three generations of a family that was Jesuit educated. His father and two sons went to Jesuit universities. Being dean of the university library, Calhoun says is “more than work, it's a vocation. And one that I feel is shaped by my education at USF and the Ignatian traditions and expectations many of us share on The Hilltop and with my family.”\n\nThe alumni of USF’s School of Education personify the school’s mission “to act collectively and leverage our resources in ways that are driven by our Jesuit mission and responsive to our constituents' needs.” Graduates of the school, the mission states, will “strive to have a measurable impact in schools and communities, particularly for those most affected by injustice.” The School of Education thus shares a mission with the University of San Francisco to enhance students’ understanding of what it means to be involved in Jesuit education, to educate leaders with a global perspective, to work for social justice, and to make the world a better place.\n\nSources\n\nPaulo Freire’s book, Pedagogy of the Oppressed, was first published in Portuguese in 1968. The most recent English translation of the book is: Paulo Freire. Pedagogy of the Oppressed. London: Penguin Classics, 2017. Information about Paulo Freire’s educational philosophy, his visits to USF, and the 100th anniversary celebration of his birth appears in a School of Education online article, written by Lisa Klope, and published on January 31, 2022. Information on The Master of Arts in Teaching: Urban Education and Social Justice was supplied by Professor Patrick Camangian, and is described on the School of Education website. Biographical information about Shabnam Koirala-Azad appears in the Summer 2017 issue of USF Magazine, p. 6, and is available online. Professor Camangian’s equity studies framework for the San Francisco Board of Education, and Professor Dominguez’s visit to a Texas detention center for undocumented immigrants are referenced in the December 2019 issue of USF Magazine, p. 6. Details on the International Journal of Human Rights Education are found in an SOE newsletter sent to the USF community on March 11, 2022. This same newsletter also addressed the School of Education’s involvement with the California Educator Preparation Innovation Collaborative (CalEPIC). Details about the School of Education group that attended the International Peace Research Association conference in Trinidad and Tobago are found in an article by Mary McInerney, “USF Group Delivers Peace Research to a Global Audience,” that appeared on June 29, 2023, in USF News. Suzanne Giraudo’s career is outlined on the San Francisco General Hospital Foundation website, and on the City of San Francisco website. The impact of the doctoral program on Tyrone Cannon and Shawn Calhoun was illuminated by a series of email exchanges between these two deans and the author. Information about other prominent School of Education alumni came from several sources, including from Taryn Moore, USF’s Director of Alumni Engagement, and from announcements that appeared in USF News and in USF Magazine from 2010 to 2023.\n\nAlan Ziajka, Ph.D.\n\nUniversity Historian Emeritus\n\nUniversity of San Francisco\n\nziajka@usfca.edu\n\nAugust 31, 2023"
