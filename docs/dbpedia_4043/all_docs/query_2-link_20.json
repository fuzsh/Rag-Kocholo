        "text": "The official names of Drexel’s colleges and schools and centers are listed below.\n\nCollege and schools named after a donor should use the donor’s full formal name on first reference in body copy (e.g. Bennett S. LeBow College of Business), and in a number of formal situations such as on building signage, stationery, website lockups, email signatures, business cards, and in college/school “About” sections in print or online.\n\nAn abbreviated name (see below) can be used on subsequent reference, in headlines and subdeks, and in situations where there are space, graphic or channel constraints. Communication platforms are always evolving, and naming conventions should adapt to the medium.\n\nOn first reference, these names should be linked to the University’s (e.g. Drexel University’s College of Arts and Sciences has created a new academic department). This rule can be relaxed in publications where the connection to Drexel is obvious.\n\nLowercase “school” or “college” when by itself. (e.g. The school is pleased to announce its new dean).\n\nOfficial names\n\nCharles D. Close School of Entrepreneurship*\n\nCollege of Arts and Sciences\n\nCollege of Computing & Informatics\n\nCollege of Engineering\n\nCollege of Nursing and Health Professions\n\nCollege of Medicine\n\nDana and David Dornsife School of Public Health\n\nGoodwin College of Professional Studies\n\nGraduate School for Biomedical Sciences and Professional Studies\n\nThomas R.

Students who want to indicate a preferred name or their pronouns should initiate this process in DrexelOne.\n\nThe University will be developing and implementing a phased approach to the use of personal pronouns and gender identification. All students are welcome to update both information points, with the understanding that Drexel will not start utilizing this information until a later date.\n\nMore information about the University's full policy and process can be found on Drexel Central.\n\nEmail Signatures\n\nFaculty and staff may elect to include their personal pronouns in their Drexel email signatures. Samples can be viewed on the Drexel Identity site.\n\nGender Pronouns\n\nThis guidance for writers differs from the AP Styleguide. Drexel’s policy was drafted with three principles in mind:\n\nHonor individuals’ pronouns.\n\nRespect the audience’s need for clarity.\n\nRefrain from drawing unnecessary attention to anyone’s pronouns, cisgender or otherwise.\n\nThe stylebook of the Association of LGBT Journalists advises: Journalists should use their judgment on whether a passage can be recast for clarity, whether use of the pronoun creates more confusion than it solves, and whether it makes sense to explain the pronoun in the story. https://www.nlgja.org/stylebook/\n\nWhen making decisions about whether to include or reword sentences with pronouns, defer to the person’s wishes as much as possible, within the above framework.\n\nWriters can avoid misgendering people by asking for pronouns while verifying details such as graduation year and field of study, by asking sources to review manuscripts prior to publication, and/or by correcting instances where a third party has misgendered or “deadnamed” someone.\n\nIf a person shares a transgender or gender-nonconforming identity on record, ask which pronouns they want published.\n\nUse plural verbs with singular they/them/their/themself pronouns, e.g., Nat is at the store, they are expected home at noon. Stories can usually be smoothly worded to avoid sentence constructions that leave it unclear whether an individual or a group is being discussed.\n\nExamples of gender-neutral sentence construction: https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/singular-they\n\nIf a source uses an uncommon pronoun such as xe, ze, or sie, include a brief, appositive explanation (e.g. Nat, who uses xe pronouns…). Instead of referring to anyone’s pronouns as “preferred” or “chosen,\" write the pronouns they use, whose pronouns are, who uses the pronouns, etc.\n\nDrexel content is distributed to many audiences across many platforms; therefore, make no assumptions about how familiar a “typical” reader is with gender-neutral pronouns.\n\nSex v Gender\n\nSex A set of biological traits that include reproductive anatomy, chromosomes and the presence or absence of certain hormones. Male, female and intersex are the most common sexes.\n\nGender Refers to internal and social identity, including behavior and appearance, that may or may not correspond to sex and often exists on a spectrum.\n\nCisgender (adj.) Cisgender men and women present a gender that matches the sex they were assigned at birth. \"Cis-\" is a Latin prefix meaning \"on the same side as.\"\n\nAssigned at birth / biological sex It is rarely necessary to identify someone’s sex assigned at birth, but if it is relevant to the story, use the term assigned male/female at birth, not biological man/woman.\n\nTransgender (adj.) Other people might fall into other categories that include transgender, genderfluid, gender-nonconforming or nonbinary. The term “transgendered” is not generally used. Only use terms that the individual uses to explain their gender.\n\nThe stylebook of the Association of LGBT Journalists advises: In news coverage, identify people as transgender only when relevant to the subject matter and only if they are widely known or describe themselves as such. Otherwise, describe trans men as men and trans women as women.\n\nFor a more complete discussion of terms, visit drexel.edu/hr/resources/overview/gender-transition/ or the AP Stylebook.\n\nMale/Female\n\nMale and female are adjectives, man and woman are nouns.\n\nIncorrect: The male stood before the class of women students. Correct: The women chose male research subjects for the study.\n\n\"His or Her\"\n\nAvoid “his or her” sentence constructions in publications, as well as in manuals and official office documents: e.g. Each employee is responsible for securing his or her laptop can be rewritten as Employees are responsible for securing their laptops.\n\nAmerican Indians, Native Americans\n\nAcceptable terms in general references for those in the U.S. when referring to two or more people of different tribal affiliations. For individuals, use the name of the tribe; if that information is not immediately available, try to obtain it. Tribe: Refers to a sovereign political entity, communities sharing a common ancestry, culture or language, and a social group of linked families who may be part of an ethnic group. Capitalize the word tribe when part of a formal name of sovereign political entities, or communities sharing a common ancestry, culture or language. Identify tribes by the political identity specified by the tribe, nation or community: the Apache Tribe of Oklahoma, the Cherokee Nation. The term ethnic group is preferred when referring to ethnicity or ethnic violence.\n\nAsian\n\nAsian is the acceptable term for an inhabitant of East Asian nations and their peoples.\n\nbiracial, multiracial\n\nAcceptable, when clearly relevant, to describe people with more than one racial heritage. Usually more useful when describing large, diverse groups of people than individuals. Avoid mixed-race, which can carry negative connotations, unless a story subject prefers the term. Be specific if possible, and then use biracial for people of two heritages or multiracial for those of two or more on subsequent references if needed.\n\nBlack, white (n.)\n\nDo not use either term as a singular or plural noun. Instead, use phrasing such as Black people.\n\nBlack (adj.)\n\nUse the capitalized term as an adjective in a racial, ethnic or cultural sense: Black people, Black culture, Black literature, Black studies, Black colleges.\n\ndual heritage identifiers\n\nAs of 2019, AP doesn’t use a hyphen in designating dual heritage, e.g. Black American, Italian American, Mexican American.\n\nChicano\n\nA term that Mexican Americans in the U.S. Southwest sometimes use to describe their heritage. Use only if it is a person's preference.\n\nHispanic\n\nA person from — or whose ancestors were from — a Spanish-speaking land or culture. Latino, Latina or Latinx are sometimes preferred. Follow the person's preference. Use a more specific identification when possible, such as Cuban, Puerto Rican or Mexican American.\n\nIndigenous (adj.)\n\nCapitalize this term when used to refer to original inhabitants of a place. Bolivia's Indigenous peoples represent 62 percent of the population.\n\nLatino, Latina\n\nLatino is often the preferred noun or adjective for a person from, or whose ancestors were from, a Spanish-speaking land or culture or from Latin America. Latina is the feminine form. Some prefer the recently coined gender-neutral term Latinx, which should be confined to quotations, names of organizations or descriptions of individuals who request it and should be accompanied by a short explanation. E.g. Hernandez prefers the gender-neutral term Latinx. For groups of females, use the plural Latinas; for groups of males or of mixed gender, use the plural Latinos. Hispanics is also generally acceptable for those in the U.S. Use a more specific identification when possible, such as Cuban, Puerto Rican, Brazilian or Mexican American.\n\npeople of color, racial minority\n\nThe term is acceptable when necessary in broad references to multiple races other than white: We will hire more people of color. Nine playwrights of color collaborated on the script.\n\nBe aware, however, that many people of various races object to the term for various reasons, including that it lumps together into one monolithic group anyone who isn't white.\n\nDo not use person of color for an individual.\n\nBe specific whenever possible by referring to, for instance, Black Americans, Chinese Americans or members of the Seminole Tribe of Florida.\n\nIn some cases, other wording may be appropriate. Examples: people from various racial and ethnic backgrounds; diverse groups; various heritages; different cultures.\n\nThe term “minority” or “racial minority” is acceptable as an adjective in broad references to multiple races other than white in the United States: We will hire more members of minority groups.\n\nBe sure the term is accurate in each circumstance, since what constitutes a racial minority varies by location.\n\nBe specific whenever possible by referring to, for instance, Black Americans, Chinese Americans or members of the Seminole Tribe of Florida.\n\nDo not use minority as a noun in the singular. The plural minorities is acceptable when needed for reasons of space or sentence construction. But phrasing such as minority students or minority communities is preferable.\n\nDon't use acronyms to indicate Black, Indigenous and people of color. Instead, refer to guidance under the people of color, racial minority heading."
