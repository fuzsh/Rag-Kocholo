Morgan State logos should not be reproduced in any other colors. If these colors are not available, the logos should be printed in all black or reversed in white (whichever offers the best contrast).**\n\nSecondary Colors\n\nIn addition to the official school colors shown above, the Morgan State identity system utilizes brown and gold as important support colors. Brown is used as the color of the bear and gold is used as an additional outline color.\n\nSupport Colors\n\nIn addition to the colors shown above, the Morgan State identity system utilizes black and white as important support colors. Black and white help to add contrast to Morgan Blue and Morgan Orange. When the official colors are not available, most Morgan State logos and art may be printed in all black or reversed in all white (whichever offers the best contrast).**\n\n*PantoneÂ® is a registered trademark of Pantone, Inc.
