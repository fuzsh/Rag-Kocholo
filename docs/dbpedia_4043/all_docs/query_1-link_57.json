        "text": "JACKSON, Tenn. — One father reached out to tell us his story of how his son’s athletic scholarship is now gone.\n\n“When she came back from that phone call, she communicated to myself, Dylan’s mom and Dylan that she had just received word from the athletic director, Derrick Burroughs, that they were cutting tennis for the upcoming school year,” said Deartis Barber, father of Dylan Barber.\n\nFriday, May 31, just one day before Dylan was heading to Lane College for the summer Dragon Academy, was when he and his family received heartbreaking news.\n\nAt that time, Dylan was in Jackson at the public court practicing tennis with his coach, Venecca Green.\n\nDylan is originally from Memphis and was scheduled to arrive to lane on Saturday, June 1.\n\nHe was awarded both academic and an athletic scholarship in men’s tennis to attend Lane.\n\n“The reason Dylan was going to Lane, I’ll be honest, was because of Coach Venecca Green and the opportunity to play Division 2 tennis for Lane College,” Barber said.\n\nDylan graduated high school with a 4.0 GPA and scored a 23 on his ACT.\n\n“Dylan received a NLI, a National Letter of Intent, that guaranteed him $5,000, and by signing that and sending that back to the college, it obligated him to Lane College to where he could not pursue any other options or any other colleges for tennis teams,” Barber explained.\n\nThe NLA was signed and submitted on May 27 to Lane.\n\nDylan’s father says that he spoke with the athletic director, Derrick Burroughs, concerning Dylan’s situation.\n\n“He was very dismissive and basically said ‘it is what it is. Tennis is gone from Lane and there’s nothing you can do about it.’ I had an opportunity to actually speak to the President, President Hampton, and he sounded as though he had remorse about the tennis program ending, but later I found out, and actually he even said in the conversation with me, he was disappointed in the manner in which we found out and the manner we were informed.”\n\nDylan’s father said that Dylan slept all day long because he was so upset about what happened.\n\n“I’m really disappointed with the HBCU, Lane College, for removing a predominately white dominating sport from a black school,” Dylan Barber said. “That just shows the classic black ignorance. Because Derrick Burroughs was a football player ,and he was like Lane College is going to be football, football, football, but Lane College’s football team was not up to par this past year. Him cutting tennis was not going to create much of an athletic change, so I feel like it was a lot of selfishness going on.”\n\nWe spoke to the athletic director, Derrick Burroughs, who stated “There were budget cuts so they had to drop tennis. Whatever was offered to Dylan, we will honor.”"
