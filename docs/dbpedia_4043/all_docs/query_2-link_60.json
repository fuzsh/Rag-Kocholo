        "text": "The Holiday Bowl is on as the Louisville Cardinals take on the USC Trojans. 2022 Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams won't play as he considers the 2024 NFL Draft, but Trojans head coach Lincoln Riley has a roster of talent on whom to rely. Keep reading for all the ways to watch the Louisville Cardinals vs. USC Trojans game today.\n\nHow and when to watch the Louisville Cardinals vs. USC Trojans game\n\nThe Holiday Bowl between the Louisville Cardinals and the USC Trojans will be played on Wednesday, Dec. 27, 2023 at 8:00 p.m. ET (5:00 p.m. PT). You can watch the game on Fox or stream it on Sling TV.\n\nHow to watch the Louisville Cardinals vs. USC Trojans game without cable\n\nWatching the Louisville Cardinals vs. USC Trojans game has never been easier, whether you're watching on a TV or mobile device thanks to Sling TV, an easy and inexpensive way to stream the game on Fox.\n\nStream the game on Sling TV\n\nFox is included in many cable TV packages. Don't have a cable TV package? One of the most cost-effective ways to get the channel is through a subscription to Sling TV. The streamer offers access to NFL Network, local NBC, Fox and ABC affiliates (where available) and ESPN with its Orange + Blue Tier plan. Also worth noting: Sling TV comes with 50 hours of cloud-based DVR recording space included, perfect for recording all the season's top NFL and college football matchups.\n\nThat plan normally costs $60 per month, but the streamer is currently offering a 50% off promotion for your first month, so you'll pay just $30. You can learn more by tapping the button below.\n\nTop features of Sling TV Orange + Blue tier:\n\nThere are 46 channels to watch in total, including local NBC, FOX and ABC affiliates (where available).\n\nYou get access to most local NFL games and nationally broadcast games at the lowest price.\n\nAll subscription tiers include 50 hours of cloud-based DVR storage.\n\nWatch the Louisville Cardinals vs. USC Trojans game free with FuboTV\n\nYou can catch the game on FuboTV. FuboTV is a sports-centric streaming service that offers access to almost every college football game of the season, most NFL games this season. In addition to the SEC Network, packages include CBS, Fox Sunday NFC games via \"NFL on Fox\", NBC (Sunday Night Football), ESPN (Monday Night Football), NFL Network and more, so you'll be able to watch more than just today's games, all without a cable subscription.\n\nTo watch the college football without cable, start a seven-day free trial of Fubo. You can begin watching immediately on your TV, phone, tablet or computer. In addition to college football, you'll have access to NFL football, FuboTV offers MLB, NBA, NHL, MLS and international soccer games.\n\nFuboTV holiday deal: FuboTV is running a holiday deal. For a limited time, new subscribers can save $40 on Fubo's Pro, Elite, and Premier plans -- $20 off the first and second months. That means you can get a Fubo Pro plan for as low as $55 per month.\n\nTop features of FuboTV Pro Tier:\n\nThere are no contracts with FuboTV -- you can cancel at any time.\n\nThe Pro tier includes 169 channels, including NFL Network. (You'll need to upgrade to Ultimate for NFL RedZone.)\n\nFuboTV includes all the channels you'll need to watch college and pro football, including CBS (not available through Sling TV).\n\nAll tiers come with 1,000 hours of cloud-based DVR recording.\n\nStream on your TV, phone, and other devices.\n\nStream college football games on Hulu + Live TV\n\nYou can watch every college football game with Hulu + Live TV. The bundle features access to 90 channels, including both Fox and FS1. Unlimited DVR storage is also included. Watch every game on every network with Hulu + Live TV, plus you can personalize your viewing experience and Hulu will offer curated recommendations based on the teams and playmakers you follow.\n\nHulu + Live TV comes bundled with ESPN+ and Disney+ for $77 per month.\n\nWatch more college football with ESPN+\n\nIf you're a college football fan, you need to know about ESPN+. ESPN+ is one of the best steaming platforms for sports fans. ESPN's subscription service gives fans access to top-quality football, baseball, soccer, tennis and hockey programming. The subscription service gives UFC fans access to exclusive UFC matches, along with original on-demand content, original sports docuserieses and even ESPN+ exclusive sports analysis.

Tap the button below to learn more about ESPN+ and to sign up to watch today's game.\n\nWatch college football live with a digital HDTV antenna\n\nIf you're cutting the cord to your cable company, you're not alone; in fact, you are in luck. You can still watch the NFL on TV with an affordable indoor antenna, which pulls in local over-the-air HDYC channels such as CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox, PBS, Univision and more. Here's the kicker: There's no monthly charge.\n\nAnyone living in partially blocked-off area (those near mountains or first-floor apartments), a digital TV antenna may not pick up a good signal -- or any signal at all. But for many homes, a digital TV antenna provides a seriously inexpensive way to watch college football without paying a cable company. Indoor TV antennas can also provide some much-needed TV backup if a storm knocks out your cable (or your cable company gets in a squabble with a network).\n\nThis amplified digital antenna can receive hundreds of HD TV channels, including ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, FOX, Univision and can filter out cellular and FM signals. It received signals 360 degrees and delivers a high-quality picture in 4K, UHD and 1080 HDTV, top-tier sound and features a 16-foot digital coax cable. This Amazon best selling antenna is currently on sale for $14, reduced from $23.\n\nWaiting for the game to start?
