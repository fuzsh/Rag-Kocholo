        "text": "Good morning, Uni Watchers! I hope everyone had a pleasant Tuesday — and I want to extend my sincere thanks and gratitude to all those who posted encouragement and kind words in my first second article, post-Paul. You guys are great!\n\nAs I mentioned yesterday, some of the best pieces on Uni Watch come from the Uni Watch community, and today I’m pleased to continue featuring reader-submitted and reader-generated stories. I think you’ll really enjoy this one.\n\nI’d also like to pre-emptively say that while I am certainly most guilty of using the term “softball top” derisively to describe MLB alternate jerseys, I’m doing so in the beer league sense, and most certainly not the women’s softball sense. As you’ll soon see, some of the uniforms worn by top NCAA teams are gorgeous, and could look good on some MLB teams!\n\nIn addition, longtime readers know we don’t often feature women’s sports uniforms here on Uni Watch, and that’s something that I’d like to change. That’s more of a function of neither Paul nor I having anywhere near the expertise/passion to truly delve into the women’s athletic aesthetic — but I’d venture a good number of you do. If you’d like to work with me on an article highlighting those uniforms (or leagues), I’d love to feature it (drop me a line at: phil.hecken@gmail.com).\n\nToday’s featured author is Andrew Hermeling, and he’s going to bring you an in depth look (and ranking) of the NCAA Super Regional schools for this wear’s Women’s College World Series. For each featured team, Andrew has included multiple uniform combinations (ranging from as few as three to as many as six) worn in the tournament. In order to keep it manageable, I’ll post a single photo inline, followed by a small gallery showing all teams’ cominations. Here’s Andrew…\n\n• • • • •\n\nGrading the Women’s College World Series Uniforms, Part I\n\nby Andrew Dyrli Hermeling\n\nLongtime Uni Watch readers know that the term “softball top” is often used pejoratively here to describe a look that many traditionalists–myself included! — hate to see in MLB uniform programs. As far I am concerned, MLB uniforms should be white at home and gray on the road (although as a St. Louis fan who fell in love with baseball in the 80s, I’ll always have a soft spot for road powder blues!)\n\nHowever, while I’m not going to change my tune about my preferred approach to baseball aesthetics, I do think the use of “softball tops” as an epithet is rooted in an inherent bias that privileges baseball over softball, a bias that is itself a product of the general sexism of American sports fandom. But seeing as we’re in a moment of broader reassessment of what exactly relegates women’s sports to the margins (because it certainly isn’t a lack of quality competition!) I think it is time to examine softball aesthetics on their own terms, giving them equal voice within the broader venn diagram of diamond aesthetics, rather than as a less-distinguished counterpart.\n\nAs such, what follows is my assessment of the 16 college softball teams that qualified for the Super Regionals (with one bonus team that was already eliminated but who qualify for this breakdown as a “too good to exclude” at-large bid.) While we are running this post after the conclusion of the Super Regionals, the teams who didn’t make it to the Women’s College World Series in Oklahoma City will remain in the breakdown so as to give a better assessment of the breadth of college softball uniform design. We’ll drop the first 8 teams today and the final 8+1 teams tomorrow.\n\nHowever, before I move onto a team-by-team breakdown, I think it is worthwhile to also talk about what makes the softball side of diamond aesthetics so appealing, even as they make certain design choices that would cause me to bristle were they implemented on the baseball side of the equation. As I see it, there are three themes that make college softball one of the better looking competitions in sports uniform design:\n\n• Unlike baseball, all softball players wear uniforms that properly fit. There is no such thing as a softball pajamaist.\n\n• Pants are always high-cuffed with hosiery, often stirrups.\n\n• Use of color is largely high-contrast. Often, tops and pants are contrasting colors, and when they are matching colors, they are broken up with contrasting belts, striping, and/or hose, with a unitard look being rare.\n\nNo baseball player looks good swimming in their uniform, but contrasting colored tops or the colored pants that are often featured within the City Connect program look especially cheap when they are also ill-fitting. Likewise, while softball uniforms are much bolder in their use of color, they rarely fall victim to Cincinnati-style monochrome nonsense.\n\nHowever, I also think we should give credit to softball uniform design on its own terms. Softball teams simply own the look. So in this sense, perhaps it is more of an attitude adjustment that is needed, not just the shedding of light on something often left unseen. In other words, “softball tops” don’t look as good on the baseball diamond because they belong on the softball diamond. It’s not because they are worse designs, it’s simply because softball has always done it better. So stay in your lane, baseball! Leave the softball tops to the masters.\n\nAs for assessment, I am a teacher by trade, so I am opting for grading on an A through F scale with a bit of narrative explaining my assessment. I am rooting my assessment in on-the-field uniforms, choosing to ignore any media-day staged presentations. Likewise, I will be assessing their whole 2024 uniform program, not just what they have chosen to wear in the championship tournament, where teams are understandably primarily running out their best looks. Finally, one general downside to many NCAA softball uniform programs, like so many other NCAA sports, is that they wear far too many different uniforms. As such, see these assessments as thoroughly impressionistic rather than exhaustive.\n\nWithout any further ado, here is my breakdown, organized according to the official NCAA bracket, beginning with the 8 teams on the left side.\n\n__________\n\nTexas: B\n\nTexas as an institution is starting with a strong colorway. Moreover, the Longhorn logo is simple and easy to deploy across their uniform program. The burnt orange pinstripe look is their best, and I am especially fond of the chest script that is unique to that uniform. Unfortunately, while I also like the block letter tops, Texas is a consistent exception to the no unitard look, eschewing contrasting belts, stripes, and hosiery. There is a power in simplicity, but contrast really makes that simplicity pop. With a few contrasting tweaks, Texas’s grade would rise considerably.\n\n__________\n\nTexas A&M: C\n\nTexas A&M has one of the most bloated uniform programs among the final sixteen. Their pink set is particularly egregious, violating one of the core principles of effective uniform design: making sure your team is instantly recognizable at first glance. The same is true of the BFBS uniform, especially considering it does not even feature a team-identifying color in a secondary role. That being said, they do have some strong looks in their collection; the white pinstripe set they’ve been wearing during the tournament is particularly good! Plus, who can argue with those striped stirrups? However, they also tend to lean into football-style design elements, like the Texas outline logo on the side of their helmets. Similarly, the large chest logo feels more appropriate for a hockey jersey. Softball should have its own voice in diamond aesthetics, but I’m not a fan of borrowing heavily from the design approaches of other sports.\n\n__________\n\nLSU: A-\n\nAs a guest here at Uni Watch, I want to make sure to honor our outgoing editor-in-chief. But consider me pro-purple. And I especially love the contrast of purple and gold. LSU does a good job of balancing some uniforms in their program that emphasize school-wide design elements, like the stylized “LSU” on their gold jerseys, with more traditional diamond designs, as exemplified by the gold “Tigers” script on their white tops. Like many teams, they include a hip logo, in this case a tiger’s head, that adds another bit of visual interest. However, the inclusion of the full purple unitard look keeps them from receiving full marks. And while I don’t mind the helmet numbers, I should probably take off at least one point to be consistent with my borrowing from other sports policy.\n\n__________\n\nStanford: B\n\nOn the one hand, there is very little that is bad about Stanford’s uniform set, and I do applaud them for not falling into the trap of so many NCAA programs, as they tend to stick to core looks. The block ‘S” with the tree lends itself well to a softball helmet, and they deploy striped stirrups well. However, their mono-cardinal red look is begging for a white belt, and the GFGS uniform is completely unnecessary. I am also not a fan of the truncated pants stripe included across all their uniforms. I also wish they would include some small Palo Alto green elements, rather than render the tree in the block “S” in white. Doing so would help differentiate them from the many other cardinal/crimson/maroon and white teams. Considering Stanford is home to one of the nation’s premier design schools, it would be nice to see them make a few more bold yet well-considered uniform design choices.\n\n__________\n\nOklahoma State: A\n\nAs I mentioned in my introduction, I do think much of our assessment of uniforms is tangled up in gender-issues and sexism. I especially find the need to throw the term “Lady” in front of otherwise gender-neutral team nicknames to be obnoxious within the NCAA sports landscape. However, in the case of Oklahoma State, whose nickname is gendered, I find the feminization of the name to be a plus. Both the white pinstripe look with lots of effective orange contrast and the all-orange uni with the script “Cowgirls” are very strong. Moreover, while I don’t find it to be their best look, black is a primary color at OSU, so the black with orange pinstripes doesn’t get negative marks from me. And the turquoise blue alternate, which is made in partnership with Nike’s Indigenous outreach “N7 Project” adds a bit of visual surprise while still reading as a Cowgirls uni, all while honoring Indigenous people in a way that feels much more in the spirit of partnership than Indigenous mascots. Good on an institution that, to quote OSU itself, is located on the “territorial lands currently inhabited and preserved by citizens of the 39 sovereign tribal governments within Oklahoma.”\n\n__________\n\nArizona: A-\n\nThis will be my second and final rule-of-thumb disagreement with our outgoing editor-in-chief. As has often been mentioned when assessing the uniform program of teams like the Texas Rangers, there are some who do not care for a team that cannot decide if they are a “blue” team or a “red” team. And that is definitely the case here for Arizona! However, that has never bothered me, especially when the brand identity/logo is so balanced between both colors, as is the case with the Arizona “A.” That logo is particularly good as a helmet/visor element, and their use of contrasting sleeve and pants stripes is very effective. And look at the height of those stirrups! The only negative is a totally unnecessary dark GFGS look that knocks their grade down a notch. Also, congrats to the Wildcats, one of two surprise Super Regional qualifiers, especially as they knocked out Arkansas whose uniforms are largely indistinguishable from the glut of maroon and white teams that dominate college softball.\n\n__________\n\nBaylor: A\n\nBaylor is the other surprise team to qualify, again giving us a stronger look than the favored Louisiana. More importantly, Baylor is our sole green and gold team in the top 16, which is especially good since our other option was the fully Nikefied program at Oregon. The gold tops with green pants are their strongest look, and I’m particularly fond of the matte finish helmets, as they go well with the matte uniform fabrics. (Also proof that with a little effort Nike can match colors across different diamond uniform elements!) The interlocking “BU” hip logo is a great touch, although they are docked a few points by their GFGS set and a lack of stirrups. But the green and gold is so strong that I’d grade them a 92.6%, which this teacher at least is willing to round up to an A.\n\n__________\n\nFlorida: B+\n\nOh Florida, so close to perfection. They have so many advantages. Blue and orange is such a great color combination. I love white front panel visor/helmet designs. The recognizable “Gators” script logo firmly locks them into the broader Florida brand identity while still looking totally at home on the diamond. The faux gator skin texture on the numbers is a bit much but at least it makes sense and is only noticeable if you look closely. And those stirrups! But that faux-football look is…terrible. For me, this is like a student who is acing a class all term only to turn in a final paper without apparently reading the prompt. Sure, the rest of the work prevents Florida from bombing the whole class, but this set could easily have been my favorite. If only…\n\n__________\n\nWe’ll tackle the other side of the bracket tomorrow so stay tuned!\n\nThanks to the readers who pointed out that Oklahoma State’s blue uniforms were not powder blue but in fact turquoise and part of Nike’s “N7” Indigenous partnership program. The post has been updated to reflect this!\n\n• • • • •\n\nThanks Andrew! Really fantastic rundown. Looking forward to Part II tomorrow!"
