Passes in these lots will remain physical passes that are mailed to Season Ticket Members.\n\nTo view maps and get driving directions to these lots, click the links below.\n\nMobile Parking\n\nMobile\n\nAll parking passes in the Planet Fitness Lots (ADA, Purple, Red, White, Green, and Yellow Lots) are digital this year.\n\nMake sure you download your parking pass(es) before you head to the stadium on game day, and have your pass pulled up on your phone on Floyd Street. Your pass will be scanned before you are allowed entry into your lot.\n\nYou can manage your digital parking through the free CardsMobile app. Don't have the app? Click below to download on your mobile device.\n\nFull step-by-step instructions on how to access and transfer your digital parking pass(es) are outlined below.\n\nStep\n\n01\n\nDownload and open CardsMobile on your device. On the home screen, tap the “Skip” option to bypass the customization log in and go directly to the app.\n\nStep\n\n02\n\nOnce in the app, tap the \"Tickets\" icon in the bottom nav.\n\nStep\n\n03\n\nSign in to your 'My Cardinals Account.'

Attendants will guide fans to the next available space upon arrival to the lot, filling the lot from north to south.\n\nA new self-park option will be available this season in the White, Red, Yellow and Green Lots. These lots are smaller and allow fans to park in the parking space of their choosing within the lot.\n\nClick the parking icons below to view the maps, inbound traffic patterns, and additional details for each lot."
