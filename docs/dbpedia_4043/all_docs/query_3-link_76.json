        "text": "Hello Skyhawk family! I am so proud to be the Academic Dean at Stinson Middle School. If you have been on our campus, then you know we have a fantastic campus filled with caring staff and wonderful students.\n\nI started my career in California as a high school teacher. I taught 9th and 12th grade English, theatre, student leadership, and peer mediation. After a few years of teaching, I helped open a new high school as the Dean of Student Activities.\n\nDuring the summer of 2004, my wife and I decided to move to Texas. I was hired in Northside at Luna Middle School and absolutely fell in love with teaching middle school students! At Luna, I taught 6th grade English for two years before I moved into the role of GT Specialist. As the GT Specialist, I taught 6th, 7th and 8th grade GT students creative thinking, leadership skills, as well as the contents of reading and history/social studies. Prior to my appointment to my current role as Academic Dean at Stinson Middle School, I served as the Social Studies Department Coordinator in addition to my role as the GT Specialist. Somewhere along the way, I worked in a non-profit as a director who supported our city youth.\n\nMy wife and I are the proud parents of four children (three boys and one girl). We have three who have already graduated high school (where does the time go?), and our youngest is in fifth grade. We live within this community, so you may see me at the local H-E-B or the Leon Creek Trail on the weekends.\n\nMy goal is to support a learning environment where students feel safe and are engaged in learning every day. Please reach out to me anytime for questions about your childâ€™s academic success.\n\nI am beginning my 14th year in education as the proud Assistant Principal of Stinson Middle School. I am excited to be returning to Stinson after having completed my student teaching here in 2010, under the supervision of our current Student Services Facilitator, Michelle Harding. I graduated with a Bachelors of Science with emphasis in Athletic Training and continued on to receive my masters from St. Mary's University in Educational Leadership. I attended Lamar University for my Principal Certification. I began my career in Northside as an Athletic Trainer and PE coach and went on to helping students gain certifications in Medical Assisting and Pharmacology in Career and Technical Education. I enjoy working with students and helping them become confident in their contributions to our community, I truly believe every student brings value to our Stinson family.\n\nEveryday I strive to model the characteristics and actions of a strong leader for our students and teachers."
