        "text": "FRISCO, Texas – Lamar University senior Brooks Caple has been named Southland Conference Pitcher of the Year and head coach Will Davis has been named SLC Coach of the Year announced league officials Tuesday afternoon. The duo highlights of list of seven players where were honored by the league.\n\nThe recognition comes following LU's 11th Southland Conference regular season title and their first since 2004.\n\nJoining Caple (first team) on the all-conference squad are second team selections Zak Skinner (catcher), Brayden Evans (first base), River Orsak (designated hitter), Jacob Ellis and Hunter Hesseltine (pitcher) while Kanin Dodge was named to the league's all-defense team at short stop.\n\nCaple becomes the 11th Cardinal to be named pitcher of the year and the first since Tim Erickson in 2008.\n\nCaple led a Cardinal pitching staff that finished first nationally in ERA and WHIP, and also ranked among the nation's elite in hits per nine innings, walks per nine innings and shutouts. Caple posted a 7-3 (.700) overall record in 14 appearances with a 2.29 ERA, a 0.86 WHIP while holding opponents to a .186 batting average. He also struck out 96 batters in 90.1 innings of work. Caple led the Southland in ERA, innings pitched, strikeouts looking and tied for the league lead in wins and was second in strikeouts and opponents' batting average.\n\nDavis' coach of the year honor marks the first of his career and the sixth time a Lamar coach has received the award. Davis received the honor after guiding the Cardinals to their first SLC regular-season title since 2004 – the program's 11thoverall. The Cardinals posted a 41-13 overall record, which was the 10th time LU has reached the 40-win plateau. In addition to those accolades, the Cardinals won 10-of-12 series, including a three-game sweep at No. 25 Oklahoma, rattled off a 13-game win streak (which was the nation's longest at the time) and landed in the College Baseball Nation, Baseball America and Perfect Game Top 25 polls.\n\nThe Cardinals five second-team selections led all schools on the second team.\n\nSkinner was placed in the unenviable task of replacing a former All-American and MLB Draft selection behind the plate, but he did so with flying colors. The Melbourne, Australia native, boasted a team-best .330 batting average with 15 doubles, one triple, seven home runs and 45 RBIs. Skinner played a key role in the team's sweep of No. 25 Oklahoma where he had six hits including a double, two home runs, drove in eight runs and scored four on his way to SLC Hitter of the Week honors.\n\nIn similar fashion, Evans transferred to Lamar this season and took over the starting role at first base. The Pearland, Texas native gave Big Red a power bat from the left side of the plate. Evans finished the regular season third on the team with a .306 batting average with 12 doubles, 2 triples, 10 home runs and 37 runs driven in. He also tied for second on the squad with 105 total bases.\n\nOrsak received all-conference honors as a designated hitter although he split his time between the outfield and his DH role. Whether he was playing first or serving as the designated hitter Orsak's production never waivered. He posted a .324 average with 10 doubles, two triples, a team-best 11 home runs and 52 runs batted in. He also drew 27 walks and scored 46 runs on the year. Orsak played a huge role in helping the Cardinals lock up the regular-season title in the final week of the regular season. Orsak recorded four hits at UNO to close the year including a two-homer game in the second game of the series where LU clinched the crown.\n\nFriday night starters on most squads, Ellis and Hesseltine joined with Caple to produce the most potent 1-2-3 punch not just in the Southland Conference but the entire country. Ellis tied Caple for the most wins in the conference (7-1) while posting a 4.17 ERA and a 1.09 WHIP. Ellis struck out 66 batters in his 77.2 innings of work while holding opponents to a .214 batting average. Hesseltine was 6-3 on the year with a 3.31 ERA and 1.25 WHIP. He struck out 44 batters in 70.2 innings of work.\n\nThe top-seeded Cardinals return to action Wednesday when they open the conference tournament at noon against No. 8 seed UIW. The game against the league's other Cardinals will be broadcast live on Newstalk 560 KLVI and streamed live on ESPN+.\n\n#WeAreLU"
