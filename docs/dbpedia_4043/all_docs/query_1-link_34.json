        "text": "Colorado State has two primary colors that represent our university and help it stand out in the collegiate landscape. Colorado State’s Primary Green should be heavily featured on any piece of collateral produced by the university.\n\nAlongside the university’s Primary Green and Gold are Aggie Orange, 80% Black, and White, which not only nods to our heritage, but also adds flexibility.\n\nThe Energy Palette heightens Colorado State’s primary brand colors while creating a color system that is distinct and ownable. It is a refreshed palette of colors that reflects past iterations of the Colorado State palette but evolves it to a place that reflects the refreshed brand.\n\nWe urge all campus communicators and colleges to adopt this “secondary” palette as a way to remain connected with the university’s branding while creating a look and feel that is ownable for their college.\n\nPlease note all colors in previous CSU secondary and tertiary color palettes are considered retired and should not be used.\n\nColor accessibility is key to creating a brand that is welcoming to all regardless of abilities. Pairings of background colors and type colors ensure our messaging is legible. These are our preferred pairings of background color and type color. While other pairings not shown here may be accessible, they are not recommended for brand use."
