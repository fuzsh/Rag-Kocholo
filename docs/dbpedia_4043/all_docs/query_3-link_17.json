        "text": "What’s in a Name?\n\nThe University is named after the 16th-century Italian Jesuit saint Aloysius Gonzaga. A descendant of a noble Renaissance family and a page at the court of Francesco de Medici, Aloysius Gonzaga entered the Society of Jesus (the Jesuit order) in 1585. Later, while a seminarian in plague-stricken Rome, he attended to the sick and dying; as a result of his heroic service, he died of exhaustion on June 21, 1591, only 23 years old. He was declared the patron saint of youth in 1726.\n\nQuality That Earns National Recognition\n\nU.S. News and World Report’s most recent America’s Best Colleges ranked Gonzaga in the top 100 National Universities. Fiske Guide to Colleges, Kiplinger's Best Colleges and The Princeton Review have also consistently praised the academic strength and quality of education provided at Gonzaga University.\n\nSpokane and the Inland Northwest\n\nSpokane, Washington and Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, form a flourishing metropolitan area with a population of approximately 775,000. This area offers many opportunities for work, service and relaxation for Gonzaga students.\n\nGonzaga's campus overlooks the Spokane River, where the Washington Centennial Trail extends 39 miles between northwest Spokane and Coeur d’Alene. Students enjoy biking, rollerblading, running and walking along the trail. Downtown Spokane is just a few blocks from the campus, providing easy access to shopping, dining and entertainment. The nearby 12,000-seat Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena, a multipurpose entertainment venue, hosts concerts, sporting events and special programs such as Gonzaga’s undergraduate commencement ceremonies.\n\nSpokane boasts many parks, including the 100-acre Riverfront Park in the heart of the city. In addition, there are 21 public golf courses within an hour’s drive, ice- and roller-skating rinks, theaters and art galleries. A symphony orchestra, civic theater and professional athletic teams add to the cultural and entertainment opportunities of the urban core.\n\nNearby recreational areas are easily accessible to students. Seventy-six lakes and five ski areas provide swimming, water skiing and winter sports activities. Spokane has consistently been lauded for its quality of life.\n\nStudents: The Center of the University\n\nTotal enrollment each semester at Gonzaga is more than 7,300 students of whom 70 percent are undergraduates and 30 percent are in graduate programs, including the School of Law and five doctoral programs. Our student body represents every state and over 43 countries.\n\nMore than half of the undergraduate student body comes from homes at least 200 hundred miles from Spokane. The result is a diverse, welcoming campus community, where cultures and friendships are shared warmly.\n\nThe academic curriculum is supported by over 800 full-time and adjunct faculty. The ratio of students to faculty is 12-to-1.\n\nFinance: An Important Part of Your Education\n\nAs you begin your academic career, it is important to remember that although tuition at independent or private universities is typically higher than at public universities, the ultimate value of a degree from Gonzaga University is well recognized by members of business and industry.\n\nGonzaga is committed to assisting students in financing their college education.

Joseph M. Cataldo, S.J., an Italian Jesuit missionary, initiated plans to build a mission school in Spokane Falls Territory. Out of the vision and courage of early Jesuits, Gonzaga College became a reality and admitted its first students in 1887, two years before Washington became a state.\n\nThe College became Gonzaga University with the opening of the School of Law in 1912.

It combines symbols representing both the paternal and the maternal houses, Loyola and Onaz.\n\nThe Coat of Arms contains:\n\nHatchment Number 1 (dexter chief): Two gray wolves leaning on a black pot and chain, all on a white field. It represents the House of Loyola, as the founder of the Jesuit Order was Inez Loyola. The pride of the House was that they fed the poor, kept the wolf from the door.\n\nHatchment Number 2 (sinister base): The arms of the House of Gonzaga, a red cross sustaining an in-escutcheon, the lions of Florence and two black for the ecclesiastical dignity of their House. The four falcons in the corners of the escutcheon represented the hunting prowess of the family. Now the faculty of Gonzaga are first, Jesuits founded by Loyola; second, the patron of the University is St. Aloysius Gonzaga; third, the House of Onez was associated with Loyola; and last, the University is situated in Spokane, represented by the river, the sunburst, and the Indian symbols.\n\nHatchment Number 3 (sinister chief): The colors of Spain, seven red bars on a field of gold, given to the House of Onez by the King, because seven brothers of that House distinguished themselves in the service of Spain.\n\nHatchment Number 4 (dexter base): Sun burst over the Spokane Falls, a pine tree to the right and an Indian tepee to the left. The Spokane Indians were so called because they were in their interpretation, children of the sun. The colors are natural, the tepee being a russet, or dun color.\n\nEagle crest: American bald eagle of the Republic, protecting the Institution.\n\nIHS: The name of Jesus, His cross, and the three nails of His crucifixion. The nails and lettering are black, surrounded by a halo for gold.\n\nIn-escutcheon: Blue and White, a royal blue field on which the letter G stands for Gonzaga, the University colors are Royal Blue and Immaculate White.\n\nAMDG scroll: Stands for “Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam”, for God’s greater glory, the motto of the Society of Jesus as given to it by its founder, St. Ignatius Loyola.\n\n1887: Gonzaga University was founded in 1887 and was only a college until 1912.\n\nWreath: Bays on the right, representing classic renown, Oak on the left signifying civic pride, both in natural colors.\n\nThe Coat of Arms is a historical logo to be used solely by the Office of the President.\n\nOur Commitment to Non-Discrimination\n\nGonzaga University subscribes to the principles and laws of the federal government and Washington State pertaining to civil rights and equal opportunity. The university does not discriminate against any person on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, disability, protected veteran status, or any other non-merit factor in employment, educational program, or activities that it operates.
