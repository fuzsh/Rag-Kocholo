        "text": "Parking Permits\n\nU of A\n\nTransit and Parking\n\nParking Service\n\nParking Permits\n\nPermit Type List and Descriptions\n\nStudent- Currently enrolled students. This permit allows parking in student and economy lots.\n\nEconomy- All students, faculty, and staff are eligible.\n\nResident Reserved- Currently enrolled students living in University of Arkansas housing facilities based upon date of housing contract and space availability. Also allows parking in student and economy parking areas throughout the year.\n\nGarage- Issued for specific garages and sold to individuals based upon application. Priority is given in this order: faculty and staff, disabled persons, on-campus resident students, and off-campus students (graduate students, seniors, juniors, sophomores, and then freshmen). Faculty and staff garage permits will be renewed annually based on space availability and their responding by the deadline. On-campus resident garage permits will be renewed annually based on the University Housing priority list and the applicant responding by the deadline. Off-campus resident garage permits will be renewed on a space available basis, in the order listed above if space is available after all faculty, staff, and on-campus resident requests have been fulfilled. New off-campus resident requests will be issued based on space availability and in order of application date.\n\nFaculty/Staff- Full-time University of Arkansas faculty and staff members or part-time University of Arkansas employees who work at least 1,000 hours annually and are not enrolled in more than five class hours each semester.\n\nReserved (Blue) - Issued for a specific lot and sold to individuals by application only, to be renewed annually. Be advised that your application gets your name added to a waiting list and does not ensure you a reserved permit.\n\nADA (Accessible) - Annual ADA parking permits will be issued at the normal fee to any student or employee who has a state ADA parking placard or license plate issued in their name. Temporary ADA parking permits will be issued for the same length of time as the state temporary placard or for a maximum of 7 days based on an appropriate and licensed physicianâs statement recommending a temporary ADA permit.\n\nVisitor/Vendor Temporary - Temporary Visitor parking permits allow parking in the following University of Arkansas parking lots: Faculty/Staff (yellow signs), Student (green signs), Economy (orange signs) and parking meters (gray meters only).\n\nMotorcycle - Parking for motorcycles only (50cc and over engine displacement). Motorcycles may also park in unoccupied parking meter spaces by paying the meter fee. Motorcycles may not park in permitted car spaces, except as provided under item 1 and 2 below, or faculty/staff, student or economy parking spaces. Motorcycles also cannot park in spaces designated for scooters, unless there is signage that clearly indicates the spaces are for both scooters and motorcycles. To eliminate the need to purchase an additional motorcycle permit,\n\n1. Reserved permit holders who register their motorcycle vehicle license as one of their vehicles may park in their assigned reserved lot in place of their primary vehicle. The motorcycleâs vehicle license must face the drive lane.\n\n2. Trikes (motorcycles with three or more wheels) which do not fit into designated motorcycle parking spaces, are treated as cars. They must register as cars and pay the car permit fee.\n\nScooter- Students and Faculty/Staff. Two-wheeled motorized vehicles under 50 cc. Valid in designated scooter parking areas only. To purchase a scooter permit, please fill out the vehicle registration form and bring to the parking office on Razorback Road or in the Harmon Avenue Parking Garage."
