        "text": "The Road to Burnt Orange\n\nWhile all Dorothy had to do was follow the yellow brick road, finding the Longhorn burnt orange road was as elusive as finding a pot of gold somewhere over the rainbow . It has been said that \"what starts here (Texas) changes the world.\" If that is so, struggling to find that one exclusive color that captured the essence and spirt of the University of Texas is responsible for creating the universe’s color palette .\n\nA substantial part of the article below is discussed in detail in this link from Alcalde. http://alcalde.texasexes.org/2011/08/longhorn-logo-turns-50/attachment/1919/\n\nBelow in the blue font are paraphrased comments and quotes from Jim Nicar. His video is also included.\n\nThere is a passionate long and surprisingly rich history of searching for the \"right\" color. A history of football coaches, baseball games, and world wars impacting the color agent \"orange\".\n\nFor a period of time after U.T. became an educational institution there was no collective \"Varsity\" mindset for the team colors. \"Like a light wave bouncing off a eye, the history of UT's color isn't a straight line to today's burnt orange. It's oscillating—and at almost every turn contentious—a wave of varying shades.” The road from colors chosen at dusty general stores to a precise legally protect color was a tedious process.\n\nThe 70-year struggle for the \"right\" color scheme is full of Longhorn infighting, regime changes, and quarrels between UT leaders, students, and alumni convinced their color scheme is the best. It has been shaped by regents, students, alumni, and braggadocious ballplayers. Burnt orange was inspired by the emotions of fandom, personal and group identity ,\n\nIn 1899 a UT fan would have found his compatriots sporting all shades of yellows, oranges, whites, reds, maroons, and blue. Adding to the confusion was the Cactus Yearbook, published by the Athletic Association, which listed the University colors as either gold or orange and white. Unfortunately, the appearance of the 1899 Cactus made matters worse. It suddenly declared the University colors to be \"Gold and Maroon,\" which just happened to be the exact hues used for the yearbook's cover. And all the while, students at the University's medical branch in Galveston wanted to throw out the double colors in favor of a single one: royal blue. There is no question that the University of Texas student body was a neurotic mess in 1899 fighting over a rainbow of colors, including shades of yellows, oranges, whites, reds, maroons, and a few in royal blue. The neurosis was so bad that the following year (1900), the Board of Regents decided to hold an election to settle the official UT colors.\n\n1900 6-0- Coach S.H. Thompson\n\nThe colors are now \"official,\" and the student body and administration vote for orange and white.\n\nCopy of The Daily Texan from 1925 in the U.T. Archives, The article read:\n\n\"When crowds watch the Longhorns fight their way through one of the stiffest schedules of their career, the men will wear uniforms of a color slightly different from the proverbial orange and white, according to S. N. Eckdahl of the University athletic staff, who has been issuing equipment to the Longhorn players.\"\n\nU.T. teams wore orange and white for a quarter-century, but other schools were also claiming the color scheme. Tennessee adopted its orange and white in 1889, though the team didn't wear orange jerseys until 1922. The U.T. athletics department decided to make a change to help the Longhorns stand out among the herd—\"an orange and white, which should be Texas' own.\"\n\n\"As a consequence,\" the paper stated, \"a combination of dyes was used to produce a shade different from the standard Orange.\n\nThe new shade is darker, being more of burnt orange.\" The color change, according to research by UT historian Jim Nicar, is credited to Coach E. J. \"Doc\" Stewart. When Clyde Littlefield took charge in 1927, he worked with O'Shea Knitting Mills of Chicago to perfect the dyes needed to ensure that Horns stayed suitably dark Orange.\n\nLittlefield recalled that O'Shea told him: \"When you get the color of orange you like, we're gonna establish it as your orange.\" Longtime Texas sports information director Bill Little, BJ '65, Life Member, points out that \"the color that Mr. Littlefield helped create back in 1928 is officially named Texas Orange.\"\n\nBurnt Orange is a medium-dark orange that evokes visions of flames. \"When we look at orange, we're looking at how much yellow versus red is in there,\" she says. Ours is a patinated orange—browner, darker, and calmer. Rose, looking at a swatch of Texas orange, reads it like a tarot card. Burnt Orange represents aggression. Enthusiasm. Rejuvenation. It's a competitive color. \"Courage is a big one. \"Over-confident,\" she laughs. \"That's good for a team, right?\"\n\n1928- Coach Clyde Littlefield\n\nBut during World War II, when everything from chocolate to typewriters was rationed, Texas Orange dyes went off the market—they had been produced for O'Shea in Germany. The Horns switched back to a lighter hue, another yellowy-orange that the regents made official on U.T.'s seal in 1950.\n\n1962\n\nIn the early 1960s, Coach Royal changes the color of the Texas uniforms from bright orange to the Clyde Littlefield era Burnt Orange. Many in the fan base were not happy.\n\nIn 1966 72 students and alumni disagreed with Royal and asked the Board of Regents to eliminate the \"dark, muddy, and murky burnt orange\" that DKR supported. A color inspired by Clyde Littlefield before WWII. Supported this decision to revert to the burnt orange (Texas Orange) used before WWII. The lighter orange antagonist signed a petition to reinstate the \"true regental style,\" convening a faculty committee to create a report.\n\nAfter sampling swatches and piecing together a timeline, a serious and somber color committee chose burnt orange as the selected color. \"Texas Orange,\" named during the Clyde Littlefield days, became the official color of U.T.\n\nThe report included this rather somber, Atlas-like note of grave responsibility: \"The committee's approach to the issue was one of serious intent, recognizing the forces of traditional continuities and symbolism which are associated with patriotic emotion and which are invaluable in giving both identity and unifying spirit to a university,\" wrote committee chairman and U.T. Vice Chancellor for Public Affairs Raymond Vowell.\n\n\"It is without question that tradition and common usage have shown a decided general preference for the darker hue or burnt orange,\" Vowell continued. \"The burnt orange is nationally identified as the official color of The University of Texas and is described elsewhere as 'Texas Orange.'\" The regents here made an interesting choice that foreshadows the contemporary legal protection of the color. It's an important distinction, as burnt orange is a general term, but using the shade along with, say, the word \"Texas\" might today be seen by U.T. as an infringement on the school's identity.\n\nThe traditionalists lost the battle, and burnt orange enthusiasts ruled the Longhorn nation. Burnt orange became the \"Texas-y\" color and was legally protected by the U.T. Brand, Trademarks, and Licensing office.\n\nOnce Royal had the Horns in burnt orange, he was asked if he’d ever change the uniforms again—to add ornamentation, to liven up the design. But lively was not his aim.\n\n“Hell, no,” Royal famously responded. “I’m not going to candy this thing up. These are work clothes.”\n\nTexas's use of lighter orange was also mostly confined to the era of black-and-white photography, making it harder for those early shades to stick or even appear in memory. And while many can still remember Royal's reign, few, if any, can recall the days of Doc Stewart. Royal's burnt orange signifies a less flashy, more earthy aesthetic, one that resonates today with Texas fans' generations. Not only has burnt orange been a tradition, off and on, for nearly a century, but the color itself seems rooted in history—a dignified shade of orange.\n\nIt was 1967 when burnt orange became official.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine burnt orange ever giving way. Even Chairman Frank Erwin got involved in the “true” Longhorn color. He said, “I suggest that we adopt the standard orange that’s the color on the arch at the student union. It is not light orange; it’s burnt orange or dark orange. I know because I went by yesterday to see it. At this point, it is enshrined by the regents as the official shade. It is legally protected, so don’t go attempting to use Pantone 159 for your business. It has, in the last 50 years, become a classic. And isn’t there something, for lack of a better word, Texas-y about burnt orange?\n\nIt is the color of red dirt, the color of a steer’s hide. “The burnt-orange color is truly unique and distinctive and is one of the biggest differentiators for our brand when compared to other institutions in this country and across the world,” according to UT’s Brand, Trademarks, and Licensing office. Not only is the shade legally protected, but it’s carefully crafted to ensure that in person and on TV, the Longhorns look like they’re wearing the correct hue.\n\nUsing the latest technology to pinpoint burnt orange shade resembles the original intention for the color and what our fans expect. The legal protections aren’t just in place to ensure that burnt orange is used correctly in official capacities and isn’t used in any unofficial way. In 2009, an Austin-based agency called Mutual Mobile created UT Directory, a mobile-friendly version of UT’s staff and student directory. The university objected to the company’s use of burnt orange; however, maintaining that the use of the color and UT in the name could lead people to believe it was an official UT product. The company did away with the color scheme.\n\nWith all that work and tradition baked into the color, it’s now an integral part of UT’s identity. And it seems unlikely to change as capriciously as it did in the past. “If you stick with the same design for decades, as the Longhorns have done, then you become de facto classic. Simple design, great design. It ain’t broke, and they haven’t fixed it,” says Paul Lukas, a blogger for ESPN and founder of UniWatch, a website dedicated to analyzing sports uniforms. “Hope it stays that way."
