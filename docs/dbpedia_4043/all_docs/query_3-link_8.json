Every year, paint, color, and wood stain brands alike do heavy research—looking at color trends, sending out surveys, and tapping their own tastemakers—to forecast a color that'll embody the upcoming year's essence. These picks will influence everything from home design to fashion. Not to mention, they're an excuse to give your life a little color-themed refresh.\n\nLast year, the colors leaned toward warm hues that promoted creativity. This year, they're all about comfort, versatility, and a continued connection to nature—from a grounding soft black, to an uplifting sky blue, to a muted to a warm peach. Since there are so many options to choose from, making it hard to keep track, we've laid out every Color of the Year for 2024 so far. Whether you've embraced these colors already, or are still determining which ones you want to try out on your walls or in your wardrobe, this handy cheat sheet means you can evaluate the hues for the upcoming year all in one place. Plus, we've even laid out some ideas on how to bring the colors into your home to kickstart your creative flow. Happy New Year, indeed!"
