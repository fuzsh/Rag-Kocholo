        "text": "Traditions of Academic Dress\n\nAt many formal college events, faculty can be seen wearing traditional robes, hoods, caps and sometimes cords known as academic dress or regalia. This tradition dates back to the 12th and 13th centuries, when universities emerged from religious orders. Similar to the robes of the clergy, academic dress was the customary, daily dress of both students and faculty. It was functional in providing warmth and designating someone as a member of the academy.\n\nSteeped in tradition, academic dress code follows detailed guidelines for fabrics, patterns, colors, trimming and length of the gown and its accompanying garments, based on the degree of its wearer. More advanced degrees dictate more elaborate regalia, made of finer fabrics with longer and broader hoods and gold tassels.\n\nThe standard color for bachelor and master degree gowns is black, while doctorate degree robes may be black or another color designated by the college that granted the degree. Officials and dignitaries at institutions may also wear gowns of varying colors and designs. Fabrics vary from light weight to heavier velvets, reserved for doctorate degree robes.\n\nHoods worn with the gown are black, using the same fabric as the gown, and lined in velvet or velveteen with the colors of the institution granting the degree, then trimmed with the colors of the specific discipline. Below is a list of colors associated with various disciplines:\n\nAgriculture Maize Arts, Letters, Humanities White Commerce, Accountancy, Business Drab Dentistry Lilac Economics Copper Education Light blue Engineering Orange Fine Arts, including Architecture Brown Forestry Russet Journalism Crimson Law Purple Library Science Lemon Medicine Green Music Pink Nursing Apricot Oratory (Speech) Silver gray Pharmacy Olive green Philosophy Dark blue Physical Education Sage green Public Administration, including Foreign Service Peacock blue Public Health Salmon pink Science Golden yellow Social Work Citron Theology Scarlet Veterinary Science Gray\n\nHoods were originally worn as a covering for the head until the function was handed to the cap. The cap is most often a mortarboard matched to the gown and includes a tassel in either black or a discipline/school color. Tassels worn with doctorate degree gowns may be gold. There is no hard rule for the position of the tassel, however, many colleges and universities have incorporated the tassel as a symbolic rite of passage into the academic community by having students move the tassel from right to left upon graduation.\n\nFor more information on academic dress and traditions, visit the American Council on Education.\n\nHonors Regalia\n\nSome graduating seniors wear regalia recognizing their memberships in honor societies and/or the GGC Honors Program. In addition to specified GPAs, students must meet other requirements to be considered members of these groups. These students are to be commended for earning the prestigious distinctions represented by their regalia, which may include a cord or stole (sash), with or without a medallion."
