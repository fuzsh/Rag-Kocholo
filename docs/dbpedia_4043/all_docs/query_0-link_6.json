I Entered according; to Act of the Parliament of Canada, in the year one thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight by The T. E A I ON CO., Limited, at the Department of Agriculture. . SEE INDEX ON LAST TWO PAGES Information for Shoppers by flail. Use our Order Form answering all qnestlons, and comply guarantee to fill your 1. Writing Orders. — When sending Orders, always write your name, Post-office and Province. State exact amount of money enclosed, and whether you want goods sent by Express, Freight or Mail. When shipping in- structions are not given, we use our best judgment as to the cheapest way of sending. When having goods shipped to a station where there is no agent, freight charges must be prepaid, and in such cases sufficient money must be sent for that purpose. Keep a copy of your order. 2. No Name Orders. — Frequently our customers forget to sign their name and address to orders and letters. Don’t make this mistake. 3. Terms. — Money must accompany all orders. Do not ask for discount or commission. We employ no agents, and prices are strictly net to all. 4. Postage. — If goods are to be sent by mail, enclose sufficient for postage and enough extra for registration. It is better to send too much than too little, and if any is over after filling an order it will be returned, whereas, if sufficient is not sent, we will omit something from your order or delay it by writing for deficiency. 5. Postage Rates— 5tlb Class Matter — Parcels weigh- ing 5 pounds or less can be sent by mail at a cost of 1 cent an ounce (16c per pound). Should goods weigh over 5 pounds, they can be put up in 2 or more parcels. 6. How to Send Money. — We prefer that money be sent to us by Post-office Order, Express Money Order, or Bank Draft, but when impossible to do this send by registered letter. Avoid sending money unregistered. Amounts less than $1.00 may be enclosed in stamps. Large denominations preferred. 7. Registration. — While we prepay postage on some goods, we never pay registration, as registration is not postage but insurance. The cost of registering is live cents for parcels weighing five pounds and under. We register all parcels to any part of Canada valued at $1.00 and over, unless otherwise instructed. Always make this allowance in your remittance, otherwise we are not responsible if parcels should go astray. 8. Express. — We strongly advise our customers, whenever possible, to order their goods sent by Express. If the Express Companies fail to deliver the goods, they are responsible and will pay for them. Where there is an Express Office, parcels weighing over 2 pounds and under 25 pounds will, in the majority of cases, go cheaper by Express, and over 25 pounds cheaper by Freight. 0. Club Orders. — To our customers living at a distance we recommend sending Club Orders. Two or more persons when ordering together can make up a shipment of 100 pounds or more, which will be car- ried as a single shipment when sent to one address, and will greatly reduce the transportation charges on each order. When ordering together use our order forms always, and always mite each person's order on a separate sheet, and enter amount of cash for each order on each sheet. Special care is given to all Club Orders. We parcel and tag each separately, and then enclose in one or more cases, and ship to one address. lO. Samples. — We send samples and prices of cut goods free of charge. When ordering samples state clearly whint you require, particularly in dress goods, as we have an immense variety. Give quality, color and price and we will make a suitable selection. Enclose the sample selected or a part of it with the order, and separate from other samples returned. State if we may substitute in case goods ordered have been sold out. A second or third choice will facilitate the filling of an order in such cases. When returning samples do not seal package. wltli tlie terms and conditions on tilts page, and we will order satisfactorily. Tie them so that inspection may be made. If sealed you will have to pay letter rate of 3c per ounce, and if not sealed the rate is 1 cent for 4 ounces. 11. Acknowledgment of Orders — Should you not hear from us within a reasonable time after sending an order, write us, giving full particulars. State date sent, how addressed, how much money you enclosed, and whether in stamps, bills or Money Order, and repeat your order as near as possible. Also state whether letter was registered or not, and what Post-office you first wrote from. 12. Complaints. — When you receive your goods, if they are not satisfactory, or if there is any complaint to make, write us (after allowing a day or two for our cor- respondence to reach you), and if yon write from another address mention the Post-office you first sent the order from. ALWAYS GIVE ORDER NUMBER. The greatest care is used in filling orders, but if an error is made we will investigate and rectify if notified at once. 13. Exchanges. — We guarantee to take back or ex- change goods if unsatisfactory, provided they are returned promptly and in good condition. Goods made to order and goods cut off the web and sent according to sample cannot be returned or exchanged. 14. How to Return Goods. — Write your name and address on the parcel you return, with the word From before it, so we may know at once who sent it. Don't forget this. Do not enclose correspondence with parcels returned bv mail. It is against the rules of the Post-office. If you return parcel by Express see that charges are prepaid. Always enclose bills with parcels returned. If the bill has been lost, state if goods were bought in person or ordered by mail. 15. Note. — Correspondence enclosed in an open en- velope will not come for 1 cent. We make no charge for cases or packing. We will not be responsible for hats damaged when sent by mail. We recommend that they be sent by Express. 16. Cost of Post-office Money Orders— If not exceeding $2.50, 3c.

Because the price of our goods is always very low, and to pay express or freight charges would sometimes reduce the price of goods to cost, and it, therefore, can- not be done without raising prices or lowering qualities. 2nd. Because we have no special stock, no old goods kept exclusively for Mail Order purposes, but always the best and newest goods money can buy. 3rd. Every Mail Order customer is in exactly the same position as if he or she stood before our counters and personally selected our most desirable goods at their lowest prices. With us, when a reduction is made in price, you always get the benefit. You can easily under- stand that prices which include the cost of delivery from Halifax to Vancouver must be higher than in a store like this where cash at the counter governs all prices.
