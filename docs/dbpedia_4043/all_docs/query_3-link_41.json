        "text": "Anyone parking a motorized vehicle on UNIVERSITY OWNED PROPERTY must register that vehicle with Parking Services by purchasing a parking permit or paying to park in an hourly space. Except for hourly parking spaces, vehicles parked on Tulane University property must have a valid digital parking permit from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. All vehicles parked in hourly spaces in the Diboll Garage must either pay the T2 Paystation, or the ParkMobile app. On-street hourly parking spaces must use the Park Mobile app, 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. Even if your vehicle has a Tulane permit, hourly parking spaces must be purchased through the ParkMobile app, 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.\n\nThe following parking rules and regulations have been enacted by the university for the security and safety of the Tulane community and apply to all persons who operate a motor vehicle on campus property. The parking plan is designed to provide parking spaces as conveniently as possible within the limits of available space. Operating a motor vehicle on the campus is a privilege and is conditioned on compliance with these rules and regulations.\n\n“Campus,” “Campus area,” or “University Property” includes all properties owned or controlled by Tulane University. “Motor vehicles” includes automobiles, trucks, motorcycles and moped or scooter-type vehicles.\n\nPermits are valid from Sept. 1 through Aug. 31 unless otherwise stated.\n\nParking permits are not valid for game day parking. Vehicles found on university property on football game days that do not have the appropriate game day permits will be towed from the uptown campus and fined.\n\nDuring the summer, annual resident and commuter permit holders storing their vehicles in the Diboll Garage is on the fourth and fifth floors.\n\nAnnual cleaning of the garage begins the Monday following Spring Commencement and lasts through the end of July. The fifth floor will always be available for parking. Signs will be placed on other floors and ramps to advise when floors and ramps are closed to parking. Vehicles parked in the garage (stored) over the summer or for an extended period that would hinder cleaning must be parked on the fifth floor. During this time, vehicles parked on floors designated as “no parking” will be towed from the uptown campus at the owner’s expense plus assessed an administrative fee.\n\nThe Permit Holder is responsible for all citations issued to the vehicle regardless of the vehicle operator. In addition to fines and fees levied for violations, certain offenses may be additionally directed to the Office of Student Affairs for further disciplinary action.\n\nDue to the implementation of digital permits, all vehicles must park in a parking space with vehicle license plate facing the driving lane.\n\nUniversity Emergency Closure\n\nIn the event that there is a university emergency, such as an imminent storm threat, only vehicles bearing current uptown Tulane campus annual permits (faculty, staff or student) will be given access to the Diboll Garage. The garage will be placed in “Restricted Mode” to ensure essential personnel have parking spaces reserved and to accommodate as many uptown annual permit holders as possible. Parking in the garage during “Restricted Mode” for uptown annual permit holders is based on space availability. Once the university closes, no one will be allowed entrance into the Diboll Garage except essential personnel even if you have an annual parking permit. Once the emergency is over and the university resumes normal operations, all parking rules and regulations will be in effect.\n\nImmobilization\n\nAny vehicle having two or more unpaid citations totaling $50 or more will be subject to immobilization if the citations remain unpaid after 10 working days. Vehicles placed on the immobilization list are subject to be immobilized 24 hours a day, seven days a week, even if legally parked at the time of immobilization. Vehicles immobilized will incur a $25 per day citation for every day they remain on campus immobilized. The fact that a citation is not issued at the time a vehicle is illegally parked does not mean, or imply, that the regulation or law is no longer in effect.\n\nPurchasing a faculty, staff, or student annual permit when registering the vehicle, or paying current outstanding citations removes the vehicle from the immobilization list. Outstanding citations are required to be paid in full prior to removal of an immobilization device and removal of a vehicle from the immobilization list. Subsequent multiple violations will again make the vehicle eligible to be immobilized.\n\nUnauthorized removal, tampering with, or damaging an immobilization device will result in fines and a fee appropriate to the amount of damage caused to the device. This act will be reported to the Tulane University Police Department (TUPD) and Student Affairs, if applicable.\n\nThe University is not responsible for theft or vandalism and always encourages owners/operators to lock their vehicles while parked on campus.\n\nTowing\n\nAny motor vehicle that has remained on university property three days or more without a valid parking permit is considered abandoned. Tulane University Parking Services's Unauthorized/Abandoned Vehicle Policy will be followed when removing abandoned vehicles. Vehicles parked on university property but found to hinder the performance/function of the university may be towed immediately at the owner’s expense. Additionally, vehicles which remain immobilized after 48 hours may be relocated at the owner’s expense.\n\nSpeed Limits\n\nThe campus speed limit is 15 miles per hour at all hours unless otherwise stated, such as in the Claiborne Lot where it is 9 mph and the Diboll Garage where it is 5 mph.\n\nStudents\n\nFirst-Year Student Residents Are Not Allowed to Register Their Vehicles and Cannot Utilize Campus Parking Areas.\n\nCommuting Permits (C Permits)\n\nCommuting permits are available to all commuting students. Vehicles with C permits are restricted to parking in red and yellow zones between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. After 3 p.m., vehicles with C permits are permitted to park in all zones (for exceptions, see section III).\n\nResident Permits (R Permits)\n\nResident permits are available to all residential students who have achieved at least second-year status. Vehicles with R permits are restricted to parking in the yellow zones between (includes fourth floor and above in the Diboll Garage only) 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. After 3 p.m., R permits are permitted to park in all areas (for exceptions, see table).\n\nSpecial Permits (SP Permits)\n\nSpecial permits are available to all students and Reily Center members who need access to campus Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. and after 3 p.m. Parking from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. is valid only in the Diboll Garage. Parking after 3 p.m. is valid in all zones (for exceptions, see table). SP permitted vehicles on campus between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. Monday through Friday must park at and pay for an hourly parking space or purchase a daily Guest Permit.\n\nFaculty Permits (F Permits)\n\nFaculty permits are issued for persons who are classified as FACULTY and Tulane Executive Officers. Emeritus Faculty (no charge) will be issued an F permit.\n\nStaff Permits (E Permits)\n\nStaff permits are issued to persons who are staff members and sub-contract employees (food service, travel agency, bookstore, bank employees and temporary employees). Vehicles with “E” permits are restricted from parking in blue zones until after 3 p.m. except Newcomb Circle.\n\nHandicap Parking with a Tulane Permit\n\nFaculty, staff, students, vendors, and visitors with a valid Tulane parking permit and a state-issued ADA license plate or placard may park in an ADA parking space or a legal space close to their campus building. Permits are not valid in reserved spaces or meter/ParkMobile spaces.\n\nMedical Need Permits (MNP Permits)\n\nMedical Need permits may be issued to students, faculty, or staff members who suffer a short-term disability which limits or impairs their ability to walk. Parking Services has partnered with Goldman Center for Student Accessibility and the Office of Campus Accessibility to support faculty, staff, and students with a medical need to park close to campus buildings (rather than just areas their parking permit is valid) when they do not have a state-issued ADA license plate or placard. Medical Need permits are issued for mobility needs that will last less than three months, with one 3-month extension available with follow-up and approval through Goldman Center for Student Accessibility or the Office of Campus Accessibility. These permits do not allow parking in ADA, reserved, or hourly parking spaces.\n\nStudents please contact the Goldman Center for Student Accessibility, if you are requesting a Medical Need Permit.\n\nFaculty/staff contact the Office for Campus Accessibility, if you are requesting a Medical Need Permit.\n\nIf approved for a Medical Need Permit, those who do not already have an annual parking permit must pay for daily parking, $5/day.\n\nMotorcycle Permits (MC Permits)\n\nMotorcycle permits are required for any two- or three-wheel vehicle which has a motor or engine to propel it. These permits may be parked only in posted motorcycle parking spaces, which are located in various zones of the campus. Motor vehicles inclusive of motorcycles, motorbikes, motor scooters, and others with internal combustion engines are not permitted inside buildings and may not be parked on any pedestrian walkway or sidewalk or at bike racks.\n\nVendor/Contractor Permits (V Permits)\n\nVendor/Contractor permits are issued to outside agents who conduct business on the Tulane uptown campus on a periodic basis. Vendors must work with their Tulane contact to purchase annual parking permits. The Tulane contact must submit a request to Parking Services for no more than two Vendor A or two Vendor B permits for each vendor. This request must include name of company, company contact, company phone numbers, number of permits, location work is performed, and reason vendor permits are needed. Any requests for Vendor A or Vendor B permits that exceed two permits must be submitted to the Parking Services at parking@tulane.edu. Vendor A permits are valid in all zones and Vendor B permits are only valid in the Claiborne Lot.\n\nAlumni Permits (ALU Permits)\n\nAlumni of the university who are NOT current faculty, staff or students may obtain a permit from the Campus Services office in the LBC. This permit will authorize parking in all areas of the campus, except where signs prohibit parking, such as RESERVED ALL HOURS spaces, fire lanes, handicapped spaces, and controlled access areas. Alums do not have access to fixed shuttle lines.\n\nReserved All Hours Permits (RAH Permits)\n\nReserved All Hours permit requests should be submitted to parking@tulane.edu.\n\nTulane House Permits (TH Permits)\n\nSome Tulane-owned perimeter buildings have driveways where vehicles must park behind one another. Therefore, only someone working in that building is eligible to purchase a permit for the building’s driveway. Should an employee need to leave who has a vehicle parked behind them, they will know who to ask to move their vehicle. Parking Services will only sell permits for the number of spaces determined to be available in the driveway (pre-determined by Parking Services). Staff eligible to purchase a permit will be determined by the perimeter buildings delegate.\n\nTulane House Permit requests should be submitted to parking@tulane.edu.\n\nEntry onto Law Road weekdays between the hours of 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. shall be by card access.
