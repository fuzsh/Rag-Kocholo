As Dr. O.L. Hailey and leaders of National Baptist envisioned a seminary to train black ministers, a committee was soon set up to look into the possibility of a seminary. Within a couple of years, Nashville, Tennessee was chosen as the site for the seminary. The land was acquired in 1921 and development began. By 1924, the seminary had officially started its operations as American Baptist Theological Seminary. Presently the college is affiliated with National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.\n\nRecently inducted as a historically black institute, American Baptist College has always kept its traditions and values focused on serving the community. To better integrate the modern curriculum, the college stopped using ‘theological seminary’ as part of its name, however its dedication towards preparing for service and leadership remain the same.\n\nABC has the history of preparing social justice leaders throughout its 90+ year journey. Many of its students participated in Civil Rights and justice movements and some of the prominent ones to serve are Dr. Julius Scruggs, Congressman John Lewis and Dr. Bernard Lafayette. The famous Nashville Student Sit-In movement which was conducted for social justice and change is also one of the proud achievements. Many of the college students served as the leaders on the movement. With courage and patience during the most difficult times, the movement and its leaders altered the lives of many Americans. To this day, many of the social and campus activities at the college are embedded in the spirit of leadership. This includes Discovery Week and ABC Day, both of which involve community engagement and spiritual development based in leadership.\n\nThe academic offerings at the college Bachelors and Associate degrees; a total of six degree programs are offered. These range from Biblical Education to arts and music and entrepreneurial leadership. Although the college campus is small, there are some prominent facilities. These include three of its buildings T.L. Holcomb Chapel, Griggs Hall and J.B. Lawrence Administration Building which are listed under the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nABC School Facts\n\nYears Estd.1924\n\nMottoLight a Flame that lasts forever\n\nLocationTennessee\n\nReligious AffiliationBaptist\n\nFamous ABC Alumni\n\nR.
