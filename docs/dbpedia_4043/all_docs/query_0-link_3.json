The Publishers' Weekly. Julia Ward Howe’s new volume of Poems At Sunset P ECULIAR interest attaches to this collection of Mrs. Howe’s later poems, upon which she was engaged at the time of her death, for it includes the vigor¬ ous and noteworthy poems which she wrote, even to her last year, for significant public occasions like the Lincoln Centennial, the Hudson-Fulton celebration, the Peace Con¬ gress, and others. There are also many tributes to personal friends, like Dr. Holmes, Phillips Brooks, and the poet Whittier. The photogravure frontispiece from the fine portrait by her son-in-law, John Elliott, will be especially' prized by Mrs. Howe’s multitudinous friends and admirers.

HUGH FRASERJ Born at Rome irTi85i, ther author^was thej daughter of Thomas Crawford, called “ The sculptor of the Capitol,” a niece of Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, and a sister of Marion Crawford. The first volume deals with the writer’s life in Rome and elsewhere before her marriage in 1874, and incidentally gives vivid glimpses into private life and public events in Rome during that period. How familiar were the scenes and personages of Roman society to the Crawfords may be gathered from the pages of Marion Crawford’s novels. The second volume deals with experiences after her marriage to Hugh Fraser of the British Diplomatic Service, and describes life and society in Europe and the Orient and South America during twenty eventful years. A list of the notable people whom Mrs. Fraser has met, and of whom she here records her personal impressions, would look not unlike a history of the celebrities of the latter part of the nineteenth century. The entire biography is a noteworthy record of a crowded life , and as such will take high rank among the ?iotable books of the season . Illustrated . Two volumes, 8 vo, boxed , $6.00 net. RUGS IN THEIR NATIVE LANDS By ELIZA DUNN A book on the weaving, dyeing and collecting of Oriental rugs, which is excellently adapted not only to entertain those who are casually inter¬ ested in rugs, but to inform and instruct those who desire information.

COLBY Author of “IMAGINARY OBLIGATIONS\" Many booksellers will remember a volume issued a few years ago, containing essays, delightfully pungent and pithy, and permeated with a quiet irony that both amused and convinced “The topics discussed are transitory,” declared the author,” but they are bound to recur.” The book, however, as it proved, was not transitory.

Fiom the Old French. Retold by Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch. Illus¬ trated by Edmund Dulac. “ Not so very long ago the holiday picture book was under a cloud. It had worn out its welcome through sheer fatuity, having degenerated into a gimcrack affair, at which no one dreamed of looking after Christmas had passed. Then it began to lift up its head again, thanks largely to the develop¬ ment of the three color process, but thanks also to the rise of new illustrators of genuine gifts. To-day, having swung around the full circle, the holiday picture book flaunts itself among the leading volumes of the season. It thus holds its own because it is once more taken seriously and made with really thought¬ ful art. No better evidence of this rehabili¬ tation of an old mode could be offered than that which is supplied in the present volume. “We find it a little difficult to speak in measured terms of the book made by ‘Q’ and Mr. Dulac. It is, to begin with, positive¬ ly beautiful in its typography. Here is a noble page to set before the reader, made of admirable paper and adorned with head and tail pieces in perfect harmony with the hand¬ some type. The title-page, too, is charming, and, as though the publishers could not be too lavish, the cloth cover in red and gold The leading Holiday suggests the binder’s art in its higher mood. And all this luxurious setting is but the fit¬ ting framework for a superb set of illustra¬ tions. We have rejoiced in Mr. Dulac before, and he has shown how true a feeling he pos¬ sesses for the enchantment of the Arabian Nights, but he has bettered his record upon this occasion. ‘Q,’ in his preface, remarks that Perrault belongs almost entirely to the seventeenth century, and that Mr. Dulac may therefore surprise the reader by depict¬ ing his figures in costumes of the eighteenth, but, as the essayist adds, the illustrator ‘ has obeyed a just instinct in choosing the period when the literature he illustrates was at the acme of its vogue.’ Besides, one could not talk about archaeological accuracy in pict¬ ures of fairyland which also happen to be aa brilliant as these are. Whatever his style, whether it be French or Oriental, Mr. Dulac plays with it as with a magician’s wand. It yields him grace, sweet sentiment, pictur¬ esqueness, and, above all, the quaintness of faery. His plates have been exquisitely re¬ produced. In short, this book is a little- miracle of holiday delight. The introduc¬ tion gives it the last touch of perfection* Having executed his task of retelling his fairy classics with impeccable skill, ‘Q’ offers us just the right word of welcome to his pavilion of golden romance. Not in a long time has a holiday book given us such unalloyed pleasure.” Books in this class are: RUBAIYAT OF OMAR KHAYYAM. With plates in color and decorative designs by Edmund Dulac. Quarto. Cloth.

Thomas Nelson & Sons have nearly ready “How It Flies; or, the Conquest of the Air,” by Richard Ferris, with a chronology of the notable achievements in aeronautics and avia¬ tion down to the present time. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. call attention to their standard edition of Tolstoi’s works, in twelve octavo volumes, translated by Aylmer Maude, Nathan Haskell Dole and Isabel F. Hapgood. These volumes are also sold sep¬ arately. John Lane Company have ready “The Beaux and the Dandies” (Nash, King of Bath, Brummel and D’Orsay), by Clare Jer- rold; “King’s Favorites,” sketches of cele¬ brated men and women, by Frances Bickley; “Peter the Cruel in Love and War,” by Ed¬ ward Stover; and a volume of poems by Eden Phillpotts, entitled “Wild Fruit.” Dodd, Mead & Co. will issue next week “A Diplomatist’s Wife in Many Lands,” by Mrs. FI ugh Fraser; “Rugs in Their Native Lands,” by Eliza Dunn; “Constrained Atti¬ tudes,” by Frank M. Colby,” a book of es¬ says; and “The City of Beautiful Nonsense,” by E. Temple Thurston, in an illustrated edition. “Sicily in Shadow and in Sun,” by Maud Howe, which has been delayed on account of the death of the author’s mother, Julia Ward FTowe, is now issued by Little, Brown & Company. The book gives the history of the earthquake and relief work, which was par¬ ticipated in by the author and her husband, John Elliott, the artist, who has made twelve pictures for the book, besides taking many photographs for it. Libratrie Larousse, Paris, have a fine line of French dictionaries and encyclopaedias in the French language which they are adver¬ tising in this issue. They also run a monthly encyclopaedia registering in alphabetical order all the events of the day, thus constituting a supplement to all encyclopaedias. They also run a long line of grammars, a new collec¬ tion of masterpieces of French literature, and Les Livres Roses, readings for the young, of which two volumes appear each month. Houghton Mifflin Co. have ready in time for holiday buyers Mrs. Julia Ward Howe’s “At Sunset,” the volume of her later poems cn which she was engaged at the time of her death. It contains many of the vigorous and noteworthy poems she wrote even to her last year for significant public occasions like the Lincoln Centennial, the IIudson-Fulton cele¬ bration, the Peace Congress and others. There are also many tributes to personal friends, such as Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Phillips Brooks, Whittier and others. The photogravure frontispiece from the fine por¬ trait by her son-in-law, John Elliott, will also be highly prized. The same artist has made the. exquisite cover design which ranks it as a gift-book in appearance.

This book is a study of essential principles equally enlightening to the man who thinks ‘‘democracy means I am as good as you are” and the much more ordinary man who does not trouble himself as to the exact meaning of the spirit of democracy, but is very sure that he is ruled by it.

Miss Addams begins her book with reminiscences of her childhood, schooldays and years at college, which unconsciously show the development of her unusual and helpful character. Ill health obliged her to give up her medical course, undertaken with the idea of helping the poor, and to make a lengthy trip to Europe. Plere she not only saw and enjoyed the historical and artistic associations, but gathered much information which has borne fruit in her settlement work. In 1889, Hull House was estab¬ lished by Miss Addams and Miss Starr, and the rest of the book is taken up with a description of the work there and the problems which settlements are confronted with. Any conclusions which Miss Addams arrives at must be of great value to social workers and among the many points here discussed are Subjective necessity for social settlements, Prob¬ lems of poverty, Economic discussion, Immigrants, their children, Tolstoyism, etc. Index.

The late Professor Borden Parker Bowne, dean of Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Boston, was often called upon to write special papers, or to deliver baccalaureate or other addresses, on subjects of the most profound importance. These papers were the last he prepared for publication before his death. The supremacy of Christ is considered and righteousness as the essence of religion, the truer relation of salvation and belief, Prayer, the law of successful living, etc.. The point of view is that of a thinker who wishes to link religion and life, and to show that religion is not theoretical but practical. This new volume is a strong successor to “The immanence of God” and “Studies in Christianity.” Boylan, Grace Duffle. The steps to Nowhere. N. Y., Baker & Taylor, 1910. c. 230 p. col. pis. O. cl., $1.50. A little boy with white stockings and a red jacket went up the steps that were left after the workmen had pulled down a house in Irving Place. It might be supposed that when lie had come to the top he would either go on and fall off or turn around and come down again. It is not well to come to conclusions in the absence of knowledge, for the author tells us what happened to this little boy and others. The steps proved to be of considerable extent. They went winding far away. A Dutch clock came along, suffering from injuries that time and vandal hands had worked upon its insides; a Flying Dutchman performed strange gymnastics upon the trees; Capt. Kidd as lie sailed was moved to tenderness by the sight of the children, and there were plenty more adventure before the children got to Panama and found the little boy's father, who was Capt. Lee of the United States Army. Boyles, Kate and Virgil Dillin. The spirit trail; with 4 il. in full color by Maynard Dixon. Chic., McClurg, 1910. c. 11-416 p. O. cl., $1.50. In this story of the Dakota Indians of the early seventies, a love story is interwoven with the heroic efforts of Hugh Hunt, a frontier missionary, work¬ ing towards the Christianization of the Indian. His efforts did not succeed, however, in averting the last struggle of the Sioux for the lands granted them in the Laramie treaty of 1868, and during that struggle the daughter of the Indian Agent is kidnapped. How her lover, thrown in jail after conviction on a murder charge, breaks out and with the aid of the missionary finds her, is told with much vividness. Bradley, And. Cecil, comp.

The ( present edition has not only been further revised and made to conform to the very latest developments and to include the latest statistics—even the 1910 census figures where ob¬ tainable—tut several new chapters and notes have been added. Among these are included discussions of recent legislation regarding primaries, recent tendencies in state politics, a detailed consideration of the latest phase of immigration, a chapter on the negro problem and recent movements toward dis¬ enfranchising the negro in southern states, another on the new transmarine dominions. and one on the lines of development in the universities of the land. Besides these, there are minor alterations and addi¬ tions on almost every page, reflecting the political changes which have taken place since 1890. In the case of one or two important topics Mr. Bryce has followed a unique and highly successful procedure, allowing his old chapters to stand, and embodying his more recent opinions in new chapters . This permits an interesting comparison between his earlier and his later impressions. Appendixes and index. Burns, Elmer Ellsworth. The story of great inventions; with many illustrations. N.

Archimedes and his lever and screw and discoveries in specific gravity, Galileo and the relations of the earth , and sun, Newton and gravita¬ tion, Watt and his predecessors in the harnessing of steam-power, Morse and the telegraph, Bell and the telephone, Edison and electric lighting, and Mar¬ coni and wireless telegraphy are among the stories of discovery told. There is nothing technical or abstruse in the narrative, but it is rather a series of stories of men confronted by the unknown, and the way they have solved the mysteries before them.

The book shows us first what we owe to Hellenic art and. philosophy, to Roman law and to the Advent of Christ. This is followed by a striking picture of the chaos of peoples in the dying Roman Em¬ pire and the entry of the Jews into western history. An. interesting chapter on religion reveals the his¬ torical. growth and estimates the importance of Christianity. The second part is devoted to the period between 1200 and 1800, and is divided into seven sections, as follows: Discovery, Science, In¬ dustry, Economics, Politics and church, Philosophy and religion, Art. The author has something new to say on such subjects as the Renaissance, the meaning of religion, evolution, the question of race, importance of nations and the part played by the Teutonic peoples in the history of the world.

Introduction to the study of the Divine comedy; tr. by Freeman M. Josselyn; tr. rev. and augm. by the author. Bost., Ginn, [1910.] c. 10+146 p. il. D. $1.25. The author has based his exposition of the various senses in which the poem should be taken upon the very source from which Dante himself derived much of his thought—the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas, both the theological essays and his commentaries upon Aristotle. With these as a foundation, he has evolved a consistent interpretation and one whose details blend into a simple whole. He presents a carefully detailed study of the literal action of the poem (the “veil”), which is the imaginary journey of Dante through the otherworld, and of the alle¬ gorical action (the “concealed truth”), which is the passage of man’s soul from sin to righteousness. Then, after a consideration of the third sense (the “spiritual”), he shows how all these are blended with the artistic elements, thus glorifying a didactic theological treatise into a supreme work of art. A number of tables and drawings are in¬ serted where necessary. Appendix and page refer¬ ences. “Aids to the study of Dante’s ‘Commedia’ ” (5 r' Fletcher, Bannister F. and Herbert Phillips.

Of these memoirs is written in the publisher’s preface: “Some twenty years ago the editor of the present volume collected a large amount of his material and formed it into a consecutive, though still imperfect narrative. . . . More facts have come to light, further correspondence published so that now a really complete life^ of the poet appears in these self-revelations,” which, though not written consecutively form as complete memoirs as if put together by Heine himself. In the introduction the poet says: “Everything that is pregnant and charac¬ teristic * is here faithfully communicated, and the interplay of outward circumstance and inward hap¬ penings of the soul reveals to you the sign manual of my being.” The first version was not translated into English though an early fragmentary edition was brought out in America.

The author takes us to the buried. cities of Messina and Reggio, and to the. ruined villages in the interior and on the coast. This is the shadow that lay on Sicily and darkened the whole world. After the shadow comes the sun, the tragedy of the earthquake is followed by the romance of the rescue. The Red Cross Knights of Civilization hasten to the relief of the stricken people. The story of this latter day Crusade is told with the enthusiasm of one who took part in it, with the authoroity of one who knows whereof she writes. Mrs. Elliott was the Secretary of the Ladies’ Auxiliary of the American Relief Committee and had every opportunity to study every phase of the relief work, from the cruise of the “Bayern,” the first American Relief ship, to the completion of the American village at Messina.

The usual people characteristic of the coun- try are introduced, and a mystery about a half breed, Calamity, adds to the interest of the general plot. The splendid fight he and Eleanor give,, especially Eleanor, who with reputation smirched in a . vain endeavor to force Wayland to give up, with a father assassinated in mistake for Wayland, with a renunciation of fortune and case of life dear to a woman she still urges the fight on, and one is left with contentment that Wayland wins to Con¬ gress.
