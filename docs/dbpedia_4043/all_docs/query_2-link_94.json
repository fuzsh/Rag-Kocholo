        "text": "Your Complete List of Men’s Track and Field Colleges\n\nCollege-bound track and field athletes have a lot of track and field colleges to choose from – there are over 950 four-year colleges with men’s track and field programs across each division level (NCAA D1, D2 and D3 and NAIA). Figuring out which program is best for you depends on several factors, including athletic and academic selectivity, school type, location and more. A good place to start is understanding the difference in division levels.\n\nWhile many athletes are set on finding a Division 1 track and field college, they may not realize that competitive opportunities exist at every division level, and many top track and field colleges include programs at the D2, D3 and NAIA levels. Exploring the different division levels will help athletes find schools that are right for them athletically, academically and socially.\n\nMen’s Division 1 track and field colleges\n\nThere are more than 270 NCAA Division 1 track and field colleges. This includes programs that offer track and field and cross country, only track and field or only cross country. D1 track and field colleges offer both indoor track during the winter season and outdoor track during the spring season. It’s not uncommon for track and field athletes to be either practicing, training and competing year-round.\n\nDivision 1 track and field colleges are known for their competitiveness and athletic rigor. It is not uncommon for D1 athletes to be among the best in the world, with the NCAA best times frequently showing up in the best times in the world for that year. D1 programs require time, energy and the ultimate dedication to the sport; athletes practice and train all year, not just during the track and field season. Between travel, academic studies and track and field events and competitions, D1 track and field athletes are training year-round. Division 1 track and field colleges are a great fit for track and field athletes interested in competing at the highest collegiate level.\n\nView the complete list of colleges with Division 1 men’s track and field.\n\nCheck out the best Division 1 track and field colleges.\n\nMen’s Division 2 track and field colleges\n\nThere are more than 200 NCAA Division 2 track and field colleges. This includes programs that offer only track and field or only cross country, or both cross country and track and field. D2 track and field colleges offer both outdoor track during the spring season and indoor track during the winter season.\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions about the best track and field colleges is that they all operate at the D1 level. Division 2 men’s track and field programs are competitive in their own right – at many top-tier D2 men’s track and field colleges, it’s common to see D1 qualified athletes. However, D2 colleges tend to have a slightly less demanding schedule than D1 programs, allowing athletes to juggle academics and other interests outside of their sport.\n\nExplore the complete list of Division 2 men’s track and field colleges.\n\nFind the best Division 2 track and field colleges.\n\nMen’s Division 3 track and field colleges\n\nThere are more than 300 NCAA Division 3 track and field colleges. This includes programs that offer cross country, track and field, as well as both track and field and cross country. D3 track and field colleges offer indoor and outdoor track and field programs, with indoor track competing during the winter season and outdoor track competing during the spring season.\n\nIn addition to being the NCAA’s largest men’s track and field division, Division 3 track and field colleges offer student-athletes more flexibility than their D1 and D2 counterparts. Division 3 track and field colleges offer student-athletes a chance to excel both on and off the track. Although they are competitive academically and athletically, they also provide the most well-rounded college experience at the NCAA level. While potential recruits will have a rigorous schedule during the season, they’ll have more freedom throughout the year to focus on academics and pursue other interests.\n\nView the full list of Division 3 men’s track and field colleges.\n\nCheck out the best Division 3 track and field colleges.\n\nMen’s NAIA track and field colleges\n\nThere are over 150 NAIA track and field colleges across the country, including programs that offer both cross country and track and field, or either sport individually. NAIA track and field programs offer indoor and outdoor track during the winter and spring seasons, respectively.\n\nStudent-athletes interested in top track and field colleges shouldn’t overlook programs at the NAIA level. These schools offer a more flexible recruiting process, as they often don’t have the same rigid recruiting rules and contact periods that top D1 programs must abide by. In addition to a more lenient recruiting process, they also offer smaller campuses and class sizes and provide a sports-life balance that allows potential recruits to study abroad, have an on-campus job or join other extracurricular activities.\n\nView the complete list of men’s NAIA track and field colleges.\n\nTake a look at the best NAIA track and field colleges.\n\nJunior colleges with men’s track and field programs\n\nThere are more than 60 NJCAA track and field colleges that offer track and field scholarships. However, there are also hundreds of junior colleges that offer track and field programs across the country. These two-year colleges include both track and field and cross country programs, though both may not be offered at every school. NJCAA track and field colleges offer both indoor track and outdoor track throughout the year, with indoor track operating during the winter season and outdoor track during the spring season.\n\nOftentimes, men’s track and field athletes opt to compete on a junior college team after their senior year in high school. In fact, junior colleges are often a great stepping-stone to competing at the NCAA D1 or D2 level. Though they may not be as competitive as the NCAA or NAIA levels, track and field recruits that compete at the NJCAA or junior college level have a chance to develop their athletic and academic skills before completing their degree and collegiate career at a four-year school.\n\nView all junior colleges with track and field programs.\n\nWhat are the best men’s track and field colleges?\n\nWe analyzed NCSA Favorites data obtained from the college search activity of the over 70,000 men’s track and field recruits on the NCSA recruiting network, U.S. News & World Report Best Colleges, IPEDS graduation rate and cost after admissions data to create the NCSA Power Rankings, which recognize the best track and field colleges.\n\nThese college track and field rankings provide a unique look at the country’s top track and field colleges from both an athletic and academic perspective. Men’s track and field athletes shouldn’t limit their college search to just these ten schools, however. The priority for track and field athletes interested in the recruiting process should be finding the best track and field college fit, whether that’s at a top 10 D1 program, an NAIA program, or somewhere in between.\n\nTake a look at the NCSA Power Rankings list of best men’s track and field colleges."
