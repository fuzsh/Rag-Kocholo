Lane Community College Logos

The file links below each contain five versions of the Lane logo. The two-color version uses the college colors, PMS 287 and PMS 130. There are two single color versions that use either PMS 287 or black. Please use care in maintaining correct proportions when scaling the logo.

The EPS and PDF files are vector based and will produce the highest quality, especially in print or when enlarging. The PNG is best suited for web use only, do not use this format for print materials.

If you need the logo as a single image in one file, download the Zip file containing all the logos.
