K9s For Warriors exists because of a fierce dedication to saving the lives of both Veterans and rescue dogs. This program is backed by scientific research and empowers Veterans who fought for our freedom to live a life of dignity and independence. Graduates of the program are able to live a life that they previously did not think was possible. Many have reunited with their families, gone back to school, found renewed enjoyment in life, and significantly reduced their medications.\n\nK9s For Warriors remains committed to ending Veteran suicide, raising awareness for invisible disabilities, and creating policy level reform. We do this through our best-in-class support & service, expert training program, and cutting-edge research.\n\nBefore it was widely accepted, K9s For Warriors believed in the power of Service Dogs to treat Veteran’s service-connected traumas. Independent research, along with our own, validates the effectiveness of a K9 companion in preventing Veteran suicide.\n\nOur proven program allows us to save the lives of rescue dogs in conjunction with saving Veterans’ lives. To date, our team has rescued more than 2,000 dogs. Giving these four-legged heroes a second chance and new purpose.\n\nCheck out our blog to learn more about how K9s For Warriors is impacting the lives of Veterans and rescue dogs, our latest developments affecting the organization, along with relevant industry research and advocacy efforts."
