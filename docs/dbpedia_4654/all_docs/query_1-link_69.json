        "text": "K9 is the Doctor's robotic sidekick from the long running TV show 'Doctor Who.'\n\nFirst introduced into the show in the 1977 episode 'The Invisible Enemy' he is a very dear character in the show that is close to many people's hearts. This petition is to re-introduce K9 to the Doctor (AKA Matt Smith) before he regenerates at Christmas this year. If we can't do that then we will aim to get him re-introduced to the 12th Doctor. I initially had this idea discussing fiftieth anniversary story ideas for this year & I couldn't help but feel the banter between K9 and the eleventh Doctor would be fantastic! and would love him to get one chance to see his loveable robot pup again before he regenerates.\n\nSo I have now started a campaign to bring K9 back before the eleventh's regeneration. Preferably the fiftieth anniversary as it would be fitting to the show to look back on his memories with the robotic pup aswell as with his companions and all the adventures they've been on :)\n\nLet's make this happen! Let's show the BBC and the producers of Doctor Who how much we want this and hopefully we will see K9's return soon."
