        "text": "Whether you are a long-time fan of the sci-fi BBC series Dr Who or if you joined with more recent Doctors, you might remember Ian Chesterton.\n\nScience teacher and companion of the First Doctor (then portrayed by William Hartnell), Chesterton was part of the original cast and appeared for a total of 77 episodes.\n\nItâs with this role that the British actor William Russell not only made sci-fi TV history, but also broke a Guinness World Records title with his reappearance in the latest series.Â\n\nThe time between the first and last appearances of Chesterton marks the longest gap between TV appearances: an incredible 57 years 120 days.Â\n\nThe science fiction television show has been broadcast by the BBC since 1963.\n\nIt was then that Russell first appeared in the drama show: he participated in the very first pilot shot for the franchise, which went unaired.\n\nThe episode was, however, eventually re-shot and broadcast with the title \"An Unearthly Child\", birthing one of the most iconic and beloved titles in TV history.\n\nAfter that first appearance as Ian Chesterton, Russell remained a regular character in the show for the next two years - until the character's departure in 1965.\n\nRussellâs most recent - and record-breaking - appearance on the Doctor Who screen happened with \"The Power of the Doctor\", which aired on 23 October 2022.\n\n\"The Power of the Doctor\" is the third and final special aired for the centenary celebrations for the BBC.\n\nHowever, through the years, Russell has maintained his association with Doctor Who across platforms and media: when he wasnât playing Chesterton in front of a camera, the actor took part in several DVD audio commentaries and also narrated several audiobooks from the series.\n\nHe also made a cameo (as another character, a BBC Commissionaire) in the 2013 Doctor Who documentary.Â\n\nThe programme recounted the making of the iconic sci-fi series and was broadcast as part of the celebrations for its 50th anniversary.Â\n\nItâs been a long-running love, the one between Russell and the Doctor Who series - a love that is now crowned with a record after the actor returned on the set of the show at the age of 97 for his \"The Power of the Doctor\" cameo.\n\nThe episode aired 57 years after the character's last television appearance.\n\nThis incredible accomplishment might not surprise shows aficionados and TV culture connoisseurs, as the science fiction television show has been broadcast by the BBC since 1963.\n\nHowever, talking about \"the beginning of the adventures of the Doctors and their companions\" might (incorrectly) feel close to us since the long-going BBC sci-fi series is still airing and racking up accolades year after year.\n\nLike other iconic franchises, Doctor Who places itself as equally a \"historical\" TV show and a product that is still making headlines and going strong.Â\n\nTo put things into perspective, the pilot aired in the same year Kennedy's assassination - the same week, in fact.Â\n\nThe Cold War was still ongoing, as was the Vietnam War.Â\n\nAll these events that might seem remote at a first glance, but help convey the longevity of Doctor Who as a series and a pillar of pop culture.Â\n\nIconic elements of the series like the angels, the various incarnations of the Doctor and the TARDIS became part of global pop culture, spreading far and wide and well out of the franchiseâs fanbase.\n\nBecause of its long-lasting run the BBC drama also holds the record for theÂ most consecutive sci-fi TV episodesÂ ever, with 871 episodes and counting.\n\nOver the years, also thanks to its longevity and enthusiastic fans, the sci-fi drama has conquered (or has held at some point) several records.Â\n\nSome of them are:Â\n\nDoctor Who holds the record for most spin-off fiction books inspired by a TV show, with over 720 spin-offs as of 2016\n\nThe largest collection of Doctor Who memorabilia consists of 6,641 items and was achieved by Lily Connors (UK), of Pontypridd, UK, as verified on 20 June 2016.\n\nIn case you were wondering, the episode \"The Caves of Androzani\" (1984) officially holds the record as the most popular Doctor Who story. It received an average of 9.3/10 on imdb.com, and was voted by readers of Doctor Who Magazine as the best story.Â\n\nAs of 2017, Doctor Who also placed itself as the most prolific science-fiction TV series (by episode).\n\nCan you name all the doctors and their companions?"
