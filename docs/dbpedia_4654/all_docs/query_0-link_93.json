        "text": "The Creature from the Pit\n\nK-9’S NEW BARK\n\nWith K-9’s original voice artist, John Leeson, having decided to leave the role, actor David Brierley was chosen to replace him, beginning with this story. Rather than attempting to imitate Leeson, Brierley developed his own distinctive voice for the part. In Destiny of the Daleks (the first transmitted story featuring Brierley in the role) the Doctor mentions his robotic friend has laryngitis, thus explaining the change…\n\nLADY IN WAITING\n\nEileen Way plays Karela, Lady Adrasta’s assistant. Way had appeared in the very first Doctor Who story in 1963 in which she had played one of the cave dwellers, Old Mother.\n\nAMAZING\n\nThe Doctor claims to have helped Theseus and Ariadne escape from the Minotaur’s labyrinth by using a huge ball of string which Romana finds during a clear out of one of the TARDIS storage holds. The Doctor gets caught up in another maze of sorts in The God Complex. The protagonist in that story, the Minotaur, was from a race said to be distant cousins of the Nimon whom the Doctor also encounters during this season.\n\nSEEING THE FUTURE\n\nGeoffrey Bayldon was chosen to play the part of Organon, the astrologer banished to the pit. Bayldon had become a well-known face after playing the magician Catweazle in the TV series of the same name. He had also been one of the actors considered to play the First Doctor.\n\nTHE TYTHONIAN BEAST\n\nErato is a Tythonian, a giant green blob of a creature that comes from the planet Tythonus. It can only communicate audibly through a translation device that uses the larynx of the person holding it. Erato has the ability to ‘spin’ metal objects. In Greek mythology, Erato was one of the Muses.\n\nCASTING THE DIRECTOR\n\nMorris Barry, who had directed the Doctor Who stories, The Moonbase, The Tomb of the Cybermen and The Dominators makes an appearance in front of the camera in Part One playing the small role of Tollund, Lady Adrasta’s engineer.\n\nLUCKY FOR SOME\n\nThe Doctor reveals that his lucky number is 74,384,338.\n\nBY ROYAL COMMAND\n\nIn the original script, Lady Adrasta was called Queen Adastra. In Latin, Adastra means ‘to the stars’. However, script editor Douglas Adams changed the name.\n\nSTORY TIME\n\nK-9 reads Beatrix Potter’s Peter Rabbit to the Doctor and Romana.\n\nDVD RELEASE"
