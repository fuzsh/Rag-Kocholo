        "meta_description": "K-9 and Company: A Girl's Best Friend: Directed by John Black. With Elisabeth Sladen, John Leeson, Bill Fraser, Ian Sears. One time companion of the Doctor, Sarah Jane Smith returns to Earth and carries on with her journalist career. Now, in 1981, she has managed to rebuild her career and has come, a matter of days before Christmas, to her aunt Lavinia's (a famous scientist) house in the sleepy English village of Moreton Harwood to write a book and to rest after her world-travelling assignments. However, her journalist's nose sniffs out another mystery when she arrives to find Aunt Lavinia gone, and nobody knows where she is, but the local rumour is that she was the victim of a local witch coven. Worshipers of a pagan goddess Hecate gather to celebrate a festival by ritually murdering a friend of Sarah's. She needs help - and she gets it from a box from her friend \"The Doctor.\" Inside the box is a metal robotic but almost human-like talking dog called K-9 that is built for Sarah Jane personally and together Sarah and K-9 sets out to solve the mystery and stop the killing of Sarah's friend.",

        "text": "Spin-offs rarely get anywhere, and \"K-9 and Company\" is no exception. Now that I have the videotape, I've seen this. I liked it; it's very true to the spirit of \"Doctor Who,\" with a touch of \"The Avengers\" thrown in. I always was a fan of both K-9 and Sarah Jane Smith; the chance to see them together was simply irresistable.\n\nThis takes the tried-and-true \"Doctor Who\" formula of a mysterious cult with supernatural powers terrorizing the local populace -- \"Image of the Fendahl,\" \"Masque of Mandragora,\" and \"Stones of Blood\" all toyed with this.\n\nThis one takes a more detective-like approach, and benefits well from it.\n\nUnfortunately, I think this pilot was doomed by its opening sequence. The theme song will make you want to beat your head against the wall, because anything else is prefereable to listening to the theme. \"K-9. K-9. K-9.\" That's the lyrics. I think this failed pilot works quite well to support my thesis that unpopular or failed spin-offs generally have really stupid theme songs, while the original show has some terribly memorable and catchy thing."
