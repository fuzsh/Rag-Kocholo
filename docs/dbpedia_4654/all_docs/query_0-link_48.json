        "text": "Doctor Who’s robot dog K9 is set for a comeback in a new TV series for children.\n\nThe much-loved metal mutt, who first appeared in 1977 alongside fourth Doctor Tom Baker, will be the “standalone hero” in a major new project.\n\nThe series will see a re-designed K9, who appears to be a bit battle damaged, taking part in a space war.\n\nA source revealed: “He’s going to look more industrial and be covered in rivets.”\n\nK9, a play on the word canine, was originally created by Dave Martin and Bob Baker.\n\nHe has already featured in several spin-offs including K9 and Company in 1981.\n\nHe was revived for the 21st century reboot of Doctor Who with David Tennant in 2006 and appeared in The Sarah Jane Adventures from 2007.\n\nAn independent K9 series voiced by original actor John Leeson was produced in Australia in 2010 and shown on Disney XD and Channel 5.\n\nTwo companies are bidding for the latest spin-off, which will be produced in the UK.\n\nUnless it is picked up for broadcast by the BBC, it is unlikely that any Doctor Who references will be permitted.\n\nMeanwhile, Doctor Who will continue battling plastic in the new series... but this enemy won’t be the shop-dummy Autons - rather, something far deadlier.\n\nJodie Whittaker will wage war on plastic choking the world’s oceans.\n\nWriter Chris Chibnall covered racism, gender politics and British imperialism in the last series, leading some viewers to moan the sci-fi show, aimed at kids, had become “too PC” with its messages.\n\nBut it averaged 8.6million viewers, making it the most popular since David Tennant’s third run as Doctor in 2008."
