        "text": "We’re still only halfway through the current series of Doctor Who, but away from the cameras, news of spin-offs and merchandising opportunities are abundant.\n\nThere’s Class, a show set at Coal Hill School aimed at a teenage audience.\n\nThere’s yesterday’s announcement that David Tennant and Catherine Tate are set to record three new audio adventures for Big Finish.\n\nAnd there’s this morning’s news that a forthcoming movie is going to focus on robotic dog K-9 (or K9; we’re not going to nitpick).\n\nMORE : There’s a Doctor Who movie coming – and it will focus on K-9\n\nK-9 turned up in 1977’s The Invisible Enemy – he’s the pet of Professor Marius, who wasn’t allowed to bring his own dog to the space station on which he works. (The script called for a character to provide narration, but co-writer Dave Martin had also recently lost his own dog, giving the inclusion of K-9 an added poignancy.)\n\nAt the end of the story Marius (who will soon be returning to Earth) allows his dog to travel with Leela and a somewhat reluctant Doctor (wondering, as they vanish, whether he’s TARDIS trained).\n\nThe main problem with K-9 was his general ability to solve more or less any problem, which made the scripts interminably dull (the sonic screwdriver was written out for much the same reason).\n\nProduction staff also had to contend with a less-than-reliable control mechanism, which led to frequent retakes when the dog either wouldn’t go where he was supposed to, or the cast fell over him (leading to Tom Baker to make the sorts of remarks we probably shouldn’t print).\n\nBaker may not have been fond of K-9 but he was certainly pally with voice actor John Leeson, with the two of them frequently seen doing the Times crossword on filming breaks, or ad-libbing unused scenes like this one.\n\nThen there was the difficulty with location shooting.\n\nIt’s all very well in the smooth and silent floors of a TV studio. But Classic Doctor Who had an annoying preoccupation with quarries – not to mention meadows, woodland and the occasional beach.\n\nIt was therefore decided to leave K-9 in the TARDIS whenever his presence in a story caused more problems than it solved, which was frequently.\n\nHe would reappear whenever a wall needed to be demolished, or whenever there was a door that even the Doctor couldn’t open. He was also a dab hand at chess, much to the Doctor’s chagrin.\n\nBut every dog has his day, and K-9 was no exception.\n\nThe first model left the TARDIS with Leela, while the second stayed with Romana in E-Space.\n\nMuch like Terry Nation’s ill-fated attempt to give the Daleks a TV series of their own, K-9 struggled to forge a career of his own outside Doctor Who – a planned TV series, K-9 and Company (the company in this case being Sarah Jane Smith, who’d never met the dog on screen), never made it past the pilot stage.\n\nDespite being utterly hopeless, K-9 and Company’s opening titles (in which Elisabeth Sladen hauls her typewriter to a pub before heading off to a Flashdance audition) are about the funniest thing you’ll see this week.\n\nStill, it wasn’t over. K-9 made a memorable appearance in series 2 of the revived Doctor Who, in which he sacrifices himself to destroy the sinister Krillitane – and in which the hapless Mickey comes to the conclusion that, despite his best efforts he’s actually the tin dog.\n\nAt the end of the episode the Doctor replaces K-9 with a newer model (leading Sladen to wryly observe ‘Yeah…he does that’) and Sarah Jane promptly puts him to work, plugging a black hole.\n\nLater episodes would see him take up residence in the attic, leaving it to attend Sarah Jane’s abandoned wedding and help her son cheat on his tests. He didn’t get along with computer Mr Smith, which is a shame, because from what I’ve heard Alexander Armstrong’s a lovely bloke.\n\nIt’s not clear what direction the new movie will take, given the number of different models and K-9’s lengthy history. Perhaps we’ll see K-9 on Gallifrey, playing Fetch with the Rod of Rassilon and barging in on important Time Lord conferences.\n\nPerhaps K-9 will still be living with Sarah Jane’s son Luke as he completes his education in Oxford. But in all likelihood it’ll be connected to 2010’s K-9 TV series, filmed in Brisbane (but set in London), and in which this happens.\n\nYeah. On second thoughts, let’s never speak of this again."
