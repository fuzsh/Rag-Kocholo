        "text": "DOCTOR Who's faithful pooch K9 has been brought back to life by a Dundee superfan for his uni project.\n\nThe iconic robot featured with multiple Doctors, including Scottish star David Tennant, on the hit BBC sci-fi show and is a firm favourite with viewers.\n\nNow die-hard fan Gary Taylor, 25, has given the metal mutt a new lease of life with up-to-date tech.\n\nThe computing science student rebuilt the original shell into an “autonomous obstacle-avoiding mapping robot” controlled from his smartphone.\n\nK9 made its first appearance in Doctor Who in 1977 - travelling across time and space in the Tardis with Tom Baker and then later Tennant.\n\nGary, a fourth-year student at Abertay University, came across the neglected robot pooch in September last year.\n\nAnd he made it his mission to bring K9 back to life.\n\nHe based his final year project around reviving the Doctor’s beloved companion, which was damaged and left immobile following a leak.\n\nThe K9 model is believed to be an original from the popular sci-fi show, which the university bought during the 2011/2 academic year, but then gathered dust until Gary stumbled upon it.\n\nLee Mack lands cameo in new series of Doctor Who after auditioning with his OWN Tardis\n\nGary will unveil his all-new K9 on Friday at Abertay's Digital Graduate Show.\n\nThe student's huge task in rebuilding the TV character included writing almost 15,000 lines of computing code and fitting it out with a gyroscope, ultrasound sensors, new boards, motors, shields and drives.\n\nThe finished product is described as an \"autonomous obstacle-avoiding mapping robot\".\n\nGary said: \"It all started just as an honours idea that came out.\n\n\"It was pitched to me by a bunch of supervisors.\n\n\"As soon as I heard the idea I was so keen to get on to it.\n\n\"I emailed the supervisor that day saying 'I have got to do this'.\n\n\"I love robotics, I love programming, I love dogs and I love Doctor Who.\n\n\"It’s a good mix of everything – it kept me really invested in the whole thing throughout the whole project.\n\n\"He had a lot of water damage from a roof leak so all the electrics in him had just fried. He was literally just a shell.\"\n\nK9’s movements can be both tracked and controlled using a mobile app that Gary created.\n\nThe student, who lives in Dundee and is originally from Kirriemuir, worked on the project without the help of other students – but credits his lecturers with guiding him through it.\n\nHe said: \"It was a lot of work. If it wasn't for the university lecturers helping me and guiding me along the way and showing me how to do things I'd be nowhere near finished.\""
