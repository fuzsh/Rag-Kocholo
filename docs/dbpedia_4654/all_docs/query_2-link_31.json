        "text": "Gatwa and Gibson have declared Rogue their favourite episode of the season, so fans will no doubt be excited for what the episode, which comes from writers Kate Herron and Briony Redman, has in store.\n\nThe BBC has released a number of teasers for the episode, including clips introducing us to both of the episode's major guest stars and their characters.\n\nFollowing on from Rogue there will just be the two-part season finale left to air, which will feature the return of UNIT and the revelation of Ruby's most precious secret.\n\nMore like this\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Doctor Who season 14!\n\nDoctor Who season 14 got underway on Saturday 11th May 2024.\n\nThe first two episodes were released at once, debuting on BBC iPlayer at midnight before airing on TV back-to-back later that day before the Eurovision Song Contest Grand Final.\n\nEpisode 1, Space Babies, began at 6:20pm on 11th May, and was followed by episode 2, The Devil's Chord, at 7:05pm.\n\nThe midnight release means new episodes of Doctor Who will be released around the world at exactly the same time, with UK fans able to watch on BBC iPlayer and fans around the world able to tune in on Disney Plus.\n\nThe episodes will be arriving in a new release format, with fans around the world getting them available to stream simultaneously, at midnight UK time, ahead of them airing on BBC One later that day.\n\nThis change has provoked a mixed reaction from fans, but Davies has defended the decision, explaining some of the reasons behind it.\n\nWriting in Doctor Who Magazine, Davies acknowledged the backlash, but insisted that this flexible release strategy is the \"future\" of television – which has been evolving rapidly since the rise of streaming services.\n\nThe screenwriter also called attention to Doctor Who's history of staggered release schedules, from Paul McGann's film being released on VHS days before its television broadcast to The Five Doctors novelisation arriving weeks before the episode itself.\n\n\"And now we have 2024,\" wrote Davies. \"With plenty of warning of the new pattern, for you to plan ahead and choose your own viewing. And that’s the point: choice. You’re not having to change your habits to fit the show, the show is changing to fit you.\n\n\"And it’s changing to adopt the patterns of all modern TV shows. Yes, I think all of them, very soon. This is the future, and it’s here, right now.\"\n\nFilming for season 14 began in December 2022, shortly after it was announced that Gatwa had been cast as the Fifteenth Doctor.\n\nProduction wrapped in July 2023, with showrunner Russell T Davies sharing a full cast and crew photo.\n\nWho will star in Doctor Who season 14?\n\nThe following stars have been confirmed for Doctor Who season 14.\n\nNcuti Gatwa as The Fifteenth Doctor\n\nMillie Gibson as Ruby Sunday\n\nMichelle Greenidge as Carla Sunday\n\nAngela Wynter as Cherry Sunday\n\nAnita Dobson as Mrs Flood\n\nJemma Redgrave as Kate Stewart\n\nBonnie Langford as Melanie \"Mel\" Bush\n\nYasmin Finney as Rose Noble\n\nAlexander Devrient as Colonel Christopher Ibrahim\n\nAneurin Barnard as Roger ap Gwilliam\n\nIndira Varma as The Duchess\n\nLenny Rush as Morris\n\nJinkx Monsoon as Maestro\n\nJonathan Groff as Rogue\n\nGeorge Caple as Paul McCartney\n\nJames Hoyles as Ringo Starr\n\nPhillip Davies as George Harrison\n\nChris Mason as John Lennon\n\nPaul Forman as Lord Barton\n\nTom Rhys Harries as Ricky September\n\nOur brand new Doctor was unveiled back in May 2022 ahead of Jodie Whittaker’s last adventure in The Power of the Doctor, with Sex Education star Ncuti Gatwa announced in the role.\n\nGatwa said at the time: \"There aren’t quite the words to describe how I’m feeling. A mix of deeply honoured, beyond excited and, of course, a little bit scared.\n\n\"This role and show means so much to so many around the world, including myself, and each one of my incredibly talented predecessors has handled that unique responsibility and privilege with the utmost care. I will endeavour my upmost to do the same.\"\n\nHe added: \"Russell T Davies is almost as iconic as the Doctor himself and being able to work with him is a dream come true. His writing is dynamic, exciting, incredibly intelligent and fizzing with danger.\n\n\"An actor’s metaphorical playground. The entire team have been so welcoming and truly give their hearts to the show. And so as much as it’s daunting, I’m aware I’m joining a really supportive family. Unlike the Doctor, I may only have one heart but I am giving it all to this show.\"\n\nDavies later gave an update on Gatwa's Doctor, telling RadioTimes.com: \"I can promise you a completely new Doctor, and yet a Doctor utterly faithful to the 60 years that came before. Soon, the secret will be out, and we'll all be dancing!\"\n\nOther Doctor Who legends have also had high praise for the star, from Matt Smith to Sylvester McCoy - so clearly he's well and truly part of the club.\n\nMeanwhile, the other major addition to the gang is former Coronation Street star Millie Gibson in the role of new companion Ruby Sunday.\n\nAfter being unveiled as the new companion during Children in Need 2022, Gibson said in a statement: \"It is a gift of a role, and a dream come true, and I will do everything to try and fill the boots the fellow companions have travelled in before me. And what better way to do that than being by the fabulous Ncuti Gatwa’s side, I just can’t wait to get started.\"\n\nOn Gibson's addition, Gatwa said: \"Millie just is the companion. She is full of talent, strength, she has a cheeky sparkle in her eye and is sharp as a razor.\n\n\"From the moment she walked into the room she captured all of our attention with her effervescence and then solidified that attention with the sheer torque of her talent.\n\n\"This adventure is going to be so wild and so fun, I cannot WAIT to sail the universe with Millie!\"\n\nMore recently, we've learned that while Gibson will be the main companion in Doctor Who for season 14, she will be joined by Varada Sethu as a new companion in season 15.\n\nMeanwhile, a flurry of guest stars has been confirmed for the upcoming episodes.\n\nJemma Redgrave will reprise her role as UNIT boss Kate Stewart after returning for 60th anniversary special The Giggle, while Bonnie Langford will also make a return as the classic companion Melanie \"Mel\" Bush, also last seen in The Giggle.\n\nDiscussing Mel's return, Langford said: \"[Mel] felt she had to stop travelling the universe and actually, literally, get back to down to Earth and face the things she's been running away from.\"\n\nMel was originally a companion of the Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker) and then the Seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) and was a regular on the show from 1986 to 1987 prior to her recent guest appearances.\n\nIn pictures from set, Langford has been seen hopping on the back of a Vespa with Gatwa - so it's clear Mel and the Doctor are in for some adventures!\n\nThe trailer after the Christmas special also confirmed the return of Yasmin Finney as Rose Noble. Davies previously revealed that Rose's appearances would not end with the 60th anniversary specials, saying: \"She’s absolutely terrific, and she has more appearances to come, simply because I adore working with her.\"\n\nElsewhere, Indira Varma - who previously played Suzie Costello in Russell T Davies's Doctor Who spin-off series Torchwood - will return to the Whoniverse but as a new character named The Duchess. Not much has been revealed about her character, other than that she'll \"unleash terror\" on the world.\n\nAdditionally, Aneurin Barnard has been added in the role of a politician named Roger ap Gwilliam, while EastEnders icon Anita Dobson will portray a character named Mrs Flood, the next-door neighbour of Ruby Sunday.\n\nElsewhere, RuPaul's Drag Race icon Jinkx Monsoon has been added in a major role as a mysterious antagonist Davies has named as Maestro.\n\nUpon the announcement of her new role, Monsoon said: \"I'm honoured, thrilled, and utterly excited to join Doctor Who! Russell T Davies is a visionary and a brilliant writer – I can't wait to get into the weeds with him and the crew! I hope there's room in the TARDIS for my luggage.\"\n\nThe showrunner recently gave RadioTimes.com the lowdown on Monsoon's character, confirming that Maestro is nothing to do with the Master despite some recent fan theories.\n\n\"No, it’s nothing to do with the Master... it’s completely different, a pantheon of gods that we’ve introduced,\" he explained.\n\n\"I did think when I named them Maestro that there was a chance that that might overlap. It causes speculation, which is fun, but the Master is kind of parked for the moment. There’s been a lot of the Master recently, so it’s time to start again and have a fresh start to the show.\"\n\nWe also know who will be playing the Fab Four in the Beatles episode, with George Caple starring as Paul McCartney, James Hoyles as Ringo Starr, Phillip Davies as George Harrison and Chris Mason as John Lennon.\n\nMeanwhile, Mindhunter and Frozen star Jonathan Groff will appear in the new episodes in a guest role, and will have scenes with the Doctor and Ruby in a Regency-set instalment.\n\nDoctor Who showrunner Russell T Davies said: \"This is an incredible coup, and a great honour, to get such a huge star striding on to our set. So strap on your space boots, this is going to be a blast!\"\n\nRising star Lenny Rush has also been added to the guest cast, playing the character Morris. Davies teased that Morris will appear as part of a storyline exploring \"the Doctor's greatest nightmare\".\n\nFinally, we also know that Tom Rhys Harries (Unforgotten) and Paul Forman (Emily in Paris) have joined the series, with the latter appearing in the episode Rogue as a Regency-era character – Harries's character has yet to be revealed.\n\nHow many episodes are in Doctor Who season 14?\n\nThere will be eight episodes of Doctor Who season 14.\n\nWhat are the Doctor Who season 14 episode titles?\n\nThe episode titles were confirmed on Easter Sunday 2024, with the eight episodes below.\n\nSpace Babies - Writer: Russell T Davies. Director: Julie Anne Robinson.\n\nThe Devil's Chord - Writer: Russell T Davies. Director: Ben Chessell.\n\nBoom - Writer: Steven Moffat. Director: Julie Anne Robinson.\n\n73 Yards - Writer: Russell T Davies. Director: Dylan Holmes Williams.\n\nDot and Bubble - Writer: Russell T Davies. Director: Dylan Holmes Williams.\n\nRogue - Writer: Kate Herron and Briony Redman. Director: Ben Chessell.\n\nThe Legend of Ruby Sunday - Writer: Russell T Davies. Director: Jamie Donoughue.\n\nEmpire of Death - Writer: Russell T Davies. Director: Jamie Donoughue.\n\nDoctor Who season 14 plot: What could happen?\n\nThe synopsis for Doctor Who season 14 says: \"Within the upcoming series, audiences will see the Doctor and Ruby travel through time and space on adventures to unknown lands, to the Regency era in England, to outer space worlds and the sixties.\n\n\"This season will also see the return of Michelle Greenidge as Carla Sunday, Angela Wynter as Cherry Sunday and Anita Dobson as Mrs Flood as well as featuring an array of special guest stars including Jinkx Monsoon, Aneurin Barnard, Yasmin Finney, Jonathan Groff, Bonnie Langford, Jemma Redgrave, Lenny Rush and Indira Varma with more to be announced soon.\"\n\nDavies has promised that we'll return to the church where Ruby was left as a baby, and that the mystery of who Mrs Flood is will be a \"slow burn\" and that we'll \"eventually\" find out more about her.\n\nSpeaking at the premiere of The Star Beast, Davies gave a hint about what season 14 will look like, suggesting we won't see the return of classic villains like the Daleks and Cybermen for a while.\n\nHe said: \"It's very new. Ncuti's new and Millie [Gibson] is new, and it was new to us with Disney and the whole new era, as it were. So I didn't want to look... there are no Daleks, there are no Cybermen, I didn't want to look back too much.\"\n\nHowever, he reiterated that he \"loves\" the Daleks and would be happy to bring them back later on during his second tenure helming the series.\n\nIn terms of the villains we can expect to see, there have already been plenty set up following the end of the 60th anniversary specials – from The One Who Waits to the Toymaker's legions, the return of the Master to The Meep's mysterious boss.\n\nWe know there will be an episode set in the Regency era, while another is set during the 1960s featuring The Beatles.\n\nDavies has also promised change is ahead - something that began with the Christmas special, which marked a step into fantasy for the show.\n\nSpeaking in February 2022 about his shock return, he teased a \"brand new ways of telling stories\".\n\nHe said: \"The truth of it is, everyone lies when they leave Doctor Who and says 'Oh, I've moved on!' – I've been thinking about it since I was three, so there's no way you stop thinking about it.\"\n\n\"There are things coming up that are brand new ways of telling stories that have never been done before, so it just feels new – I wouldn't have gone back if it wasn't feeling new,\" he added.\n\nHe went on to explain that Doctor Who has a unique appeal to writers, as each week brings its own distinct premise and characters.\n\n\"I'm sitting here now, 10 pages away from a climax thinking, 'God, I've never been in this territory before – this is strange and new and hopefully I'll learn something out of it,\" added Davies.\n\n\"The reason why I've worked on 34 programmes in my life is that I don't normally like continuing series. That's why It's A Sin came to an end and I just moved on.\"\n\nHe concluded: \"I just like looking at a new set of challenges every time and another blank page, but Doctor Who is always a blank page.\"\n\nThe cast have given clues as to what to expect, with Michelle Greenidge telling RadioTimes.com: \"What I will say is, when the series airs… I don't think the audience are going to be ready. It is incredible. The story arc, the writing... you'll be gripped. I'm so ecstatic with how things have played out.\"\n\nTo mark the BBC's deal with Disney that will allow streamer Disney Plus to become the home of Doctor Who outside the UK and Ireland, Gatwa took part in a Doctor Who Q&A shared on Twitter (now X) and revealed what his ideal storyline would look like.\n\n\"I cannot wait to put my stamp on the character,\" he said. He also reveals where he would like his Time Lord to travel, saying: \"I would take my TARDIS to Africa, I would take my TARDIS to Nigeria.\"\n\nAdding that the location would give the Doctor the chance to interact with African mythology, he said: \"I would love for the Doctor to meet the Orisha, which were a set of gods in Nigerian mythology, and I think that he'd have a lovely old time.\"\n\nHe also revealed that \"there are some extraordinary storylines for this season\".\n\nAdditionally, Gatwa quizzed Gibson in a video about her thoughts on Doctor Who and what it means to be a companion.\n\nThis new era, under the creative leadership of showrunner Russell T Davies, will not only include plenty of references to the show's past, including the return of beloved characters such as Bonnie Langford's Mel Bush, but will also be a totally fresh spin on the series, with the TARDIS team facing off against an array of new monsters.\n\nIs Doctor Who being rebooted?\n\nSeason 14 (or season 1 if that's your preference!) is somewhat of a reboot for Doctor Who – but not quite the hard relaunch that we saw in Christopher Eccleston's season in 2005.\n\nThis is the first season after the BBC's deal with Disney Plus, and it's clear that showrunner Davies is conscious new fans will be coming to the show.\n\nSo, while we're expecting lots of references to past Doctor Who, including to the Timeless Child arc, which has been continued post-Chris Chibnall's era, we're also expecting a lot of new villains and characters – and a few tidbits of explanation about the Doctor's past.\n\nIs there a trailer for Doctor Who season 14?\n\nYes! A trailer for the upcoming season was released after the 2023 Christmas special, while further trailers have been released in subsequent months. You can watch a selection below.\n\nFull trailer:\n\nFollow-up trailer:\n\nYou can also watch a next time trailer for the upcoming sixth episode, Rogue right here.\n\nDoctor Who continues on BBC iPlayer and BBC One on 8th June. Previous seasons are available to stream on BBC iPlayer."
