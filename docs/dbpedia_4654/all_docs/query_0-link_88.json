        "text": "Doctor Who’s robot companion K9 is to get his own big-screen outing, according to the character’s creators.\n\nThe cult favourite, who made his first television appearance on the BBC close to 40 years ago in the 1977 episode The Invisible Enemy, will star in K9: Timequake. Planned for a release in cinemas in 2017, the movie will be written by Doctor Who writer and K9 creator Bob Baker.\n\nAccording to Doctor Who News, the film will be an action adventure set in a deep space environment populated by dashing heroes and heroines, androids, monstrous aliens and a high-tech K9 “for today’s cinema”. The Doctor Who villain Omega, a Time Lord who first appeared in the 1973 10th anniversary serial The Three Doctors, will be the main antagonist.\n\nA spokesperson for the producers – Baker and The Essential Book of K9 writer Paul Tam – told Doctor Who News: “Bob and Paul are very excited about the project and having Omega in the Movie will bring a great new dimension to both characters as K9 faces his greatest challenge. The names of the director and principle cast will be released in the new year. Regular updates will be posted over the next few months.”\n\nDoctor Who himself is not expected to appear in the movie, and the film is unlikely to feature any of the Time Lord’s regular companions or enemies bar Omega.\n\nAs creator, Curse of the Were-Rabbit co-writer Baker maintains rights to K9 spin-off appearances in the media. But the BBC has generally opted out of the robot dog’s extra-Who adventures, which include the 2010 part-animated, part-live action TV series K9.\n\nK9: Timequake will reportedly be a multimillion dollar UK co-production shot mostly in unspecified overseas locations, but with studio work due to take place in the UK."
