        "text": "The Silver Spring Police Department K-9 Unit was started in 2009 with the K-9 team of Sgt. David Jenkins and K-9 Bruder Winston with a second team of Ofc. David Frascella and K-9 Tracker Augustus being added in 2016. Sadly in March 2019 K-9 Bruder died of medical issues after 10 years of excellent service.\n\nThe K-9s\n\nBruder, a Belgian Malinois and German Sheppard mix, was born on October 11, 2007 in Slovakia. In March 2009 he received his initial training from Castle K-9 and joined the department.\n\nTracker, a pure Belgian Malinois was born on February 2, 2015 and was selected by Silver Spring Police from Castle K-9 of Mechanicsburg and trained in September 2016.\n\nThis training consisted of over 250 hours in which Bruder and Tracker were cross-trained in patrol and narcotics detection. Both teams have participated in drug seizures both large and small, human tracking, area and building searches as well as numerous criminal apprehensions.\n\nThey train on a continual basis.\n\nFunding\n\nBoth teams were initiated through donations, large and small, by individuals and businesses alike. The continued costs of operating the K-9 program is also funded through similar donations. If you would like to contribute to our program, please see our go fund me page or send a check to \"Silver Spring Township Police\" with \"K9\" in the memo line to 5 Willow Mill Park Road, Suite #1, Mechanicsburg, PA 17050.\n\nAs always we are extremely grateful to all the support we have received, and continue to receive, from our community.
