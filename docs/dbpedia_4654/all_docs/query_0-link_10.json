After helping defeat The Swarm, the Professor offered K-9 to the Doctor and Leela. Although this version remained on Gallifrey with Leela when she left the TARDIS, the Doctor constructed a second K-9 from spares. This new K-9 helped the Doctor and Romana reassemble the Key to Time, was taken hostage by Lady Adrasta and led the attack on the Vampire castle. Damaged by the Time Winds, he remained in E-space with Romana and the Tharils."
