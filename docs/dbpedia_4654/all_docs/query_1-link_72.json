        "text": "K-9 (2009â€“2010) is a British/Australian comedy/adventure series focusing on the adventures of the robot dog K-9 from the show Doctor Who and his experiences in London in 2050.\n\nStarkey: You again. Jorjie, isn't it? What do you want?\n\nJorjie: Same as you. To make a difference.\n\nStarkey: I've told you before. \"Stark Reality\" works alone.\n\nJorjie: Fine. What about plain old Starkey, then? He's not a lone wolf, is he?\n\nStarkey: How'd you get my real name?\n\nJorjie: Hacked your criminal activity file. I admire your work. I want to help.\n\nStarkey: [to the Jixen] Whatever you are, I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable human- [catches himself] -aliens.\n\n[K9 has just self-destructed and destroyed the Jixen.]\n\nJorjie: We was being our friend, Starkey. He destroyed the creatures.\n\nStarkey: And himself. For us. He protected us.\n\n[K9 has just regenerated.]\n\nK9: G'day, mates. Bonjour. [continues in various languages]\n\nGryffen: That's extraordinary.\n\nK9: Hello. Howdy. Hello. [repeats \"hello\" in several different voices]\n\nJorjie: He's going to fire again!\n\nStarkey: No, he's not. Good dog. Heel, boy! Heel!\n\nK9: This unit does not appreciate the term \"dog,\" \"boy,\" or \"heel.\" Regeneration unity log indicates you saved it from damage.\n\nStarkey: What are you?\n\nK9: What am I? My name is...K9. I do not know when or where I am. Commencing orientation protocols. Flying! [starts to fly] Left! Right! Up! And away we go!\n\nK9: [counting down until self-destruct] 7...6...5...4...\n\nStarkey: Stay!\n\nK9: [pauses] Sorry, young master. I've managed to reroute my circuits. I'm in control of them again.\n\nDarius: Wish I could say the same about mine.\n\nK9: I have overridden the program. Imminent explosion averted. This unit is no longer being used by the Korven. [suddenly starts again] 4...3...2...1... [pauses] Bang.\n\nStarkey: K9, tell me that wasn't a joke.\n\nK9: Very well, young master. That wasn't a joke.\n\n[Jixen laughs]\n\nDarius: You can laugh?\n\nJixen: Of course! Jixen are famous for their sense of hunger!\n\nInspector Thorne: We've developed a weapon. A super-soldier created from the DNA of every species we've encountered. Jixen, Anubian, Meron, you name it.\n\nK9: And implanted with my regeneration tech. This unit would like it back, please.\n\nInspector Thorne: But it's a small contribution to the weapon that would save this planet.\n\nK9: A weapon that cannot possibly work.\n\nInspector Thorne: Well his cloaking tech seems to work. He's been in this room all along.\n\nK9: So he is the huge, invisible pile of DNA in the corner, then.\n\nInspector Thorne: How could you detect him?\n\nK9: I'm K9.\n\nInspector Thorne: Meet Project Trojan!\n\n[Project Trojan, a massive monster, appears out of thin air.]\n\nGryffen: Stay safe! [quietly] I'm rather fond of you all.\n\nJorjie: Do you remember what Gryffen said before we left about being fond?\n\nStarkey: Yeah.\n\n[The two go in for a kiss]\n\nCCPC: Oi! You two! Invading each other's personal space!\n\nGryffen: [frantically calling for help] Starkey, come in. Darius, please! Jorjie! Jean, come in! ...I can't let my planet be destroyed.\n\nGryffen: [on video] This is Professor Alistair Gryffen. My friends are in terrible danger. I'm unable to contact a single one. I believe...I'm their only hope of survival...and...perhaps that of the entire human race. Me. Agoraphobic, reclusive shut-in. So if you're watching this, it means that I didn't just sit here in this house doing nothing as I have done for so long. It means that Alistair Gryffen finally stood up and did something. Today, I don't just sit where I am. I hit the bottom, and there's nowhere to go but up. [in real life, looking out the front door] And out.\n\nThorne: Gryffen would never terminate the STM. Without it, he'd never see his precious family again. What were their names again?\n\nGryffen: [angrily] You want to know their names?! Their names were Eleanor, Mina, and Jacob!\n\n[as K9 dies]\n\nDarius: You're the coolest thing that ever happened to me.\n\nJorjie: Remember all the times I tried to teach you how to have fun? I've had a lifetime of fun since I met you. [starting to cry] I'll never forget you.\n\nStarkey: You're right, K9. You're not a dog. You're my best friend. You used to think I was brave. You've shown me what it's like to be fearless. I'm gonna miss you, mate.\n\nK9: Yes...young master. [powers down]\n\nStarkey: You're a good dog.\n\n[after K9 regenerates, final words of the season]\n\nStarkey: So, we're back in business, K9?\n\nK9: Affirmative, young master! Affirmative!!\n\nJohn Leeson - K-9\n\nKeegan Joyce - Starkey\n\nRobert Moloney - Professor Alistair Gryffen\n\nPhilippa Coulthard - Jorjie Turner\n\nDaniel Webber - Darius Pike\n\nWikipedia has an article about:"
