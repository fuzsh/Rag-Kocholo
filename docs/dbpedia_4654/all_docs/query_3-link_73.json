        "text": "K9 Ronin and his partner have worked together as a team since November 2015. K9 Ronin is a Belgian Malinois and is trained in patrol work as well as in narcotics detection. K9 Ronin was purchased and trained entirely through donated funds.\n\nSince the establishment of the K9 Unit in 1981, WCPD had only ever staffed a maximum of three police dogs assigned to patrol duties at one time. The addition of K9 Ronin not only represents WCPD history but also a significant increase in city-wide coverage.\n\nK9 Rye and his partner have worked together as a team since November 2018. K9 Rye is a Belgian Malinois, born in France and trained in the French commands. We were lucky enough to acquire K9 Rye before he was selected by an elite unit within the US Army. K9 Rye is trained in patrol work, as well as narcotics detection. K9 Rye is one of only a handful of nearby police K9s who holds a national certification. K9 Rye won numerous awards at a K9 trial. On his days off, K9 Rye enjoys eating his favorite food, french fries (or does he consider them just fries where he comes from?).\n\nK9 Rev, a Dutch Shepherd, was born September 18, 2018, to the proud parents of Myrca (mother) and Devil (father). K9 Rev began his training to become a police service dog when he was just six weeks old with his partner. K9 Rev graduated from training in January of 2020, at 14 weeks old. Just two months later, K9 Rev learned a new trick and was certified in detecting firearms. When not actively patrolling the City with his partner, you can catch K9 Rev chewing on his favorite toy, a sandblast hose.\n\nK9 Raiden is a two-year-old Dutch Shepherd. K9 Raiden has the same parents as K9 Rev with his mother being Myrca and Devil being his father. They are brothers in a sense, but K9 Raiden was born one litter after K9 Rev’s. Being police canines definitely runs in the family now! K9 Raiden graduated from training in April of 2022. He is also certified in detecting explosives."
