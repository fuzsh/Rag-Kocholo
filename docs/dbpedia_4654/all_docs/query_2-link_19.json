        "text": "Doctor Who is a television series controlled by the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation).\n\nOrigins\n\nSeveral individuals share credit for establishing Doctor Who in 1963, but it is generally accepted that the original impetus for the series, as well as the establishment of certain aspects, such as the concept of the TARDIS, the basic character of the Doctor and the title Doctor Who itself belong to Canadian-born Sydney Newman, who is also credited with creating another iconic series, The Avengers. Others involved in piecing together the puzzle that became the series include Head of Serials Donald Wilson, writer C. E. Webber, script editor David Whitaker and the show's first producer, Verity Lambert, the first woman to hold such a position at the BBC.\n\nPremise\n\nIt centres on a time traveller called \"the Doctor\", who comes from a race of beings known as Time Lords. They travel through space and time in a time machine they call the TARDIS. This ship — which looks like a small, London police box on the outside — has nearly infinite dimensions on the inside. It has become such an iconic shape in British culture that it is currently the intellectual property of the BBC rather than its actual makers, the Metropolitan Police Service.\n\nIn order to accommodate cast changes, the narrative allows the Doctor to regenerate into an essentially new person on occasion. The cast is rounded out by one or more \"companions\", often females. On average, the main cast completely changes once every three or four years — a significant factor in the longevity of the programme.\n\nCast\n\nThe Doctor - William Hartnell\n\nThe Doctor - Patrick
