        "text": "Commanding Officer:\n\nLieutenant A.M. Gazdick\n\nThe Duval County School Police Department (DCSP) established its Canine (K-9) Unit in 2022. The K-9 Unit was spearheaded by Lieutenant Amber Gazdick, who currently supervises the unit. The DCSP K-9 Unit is currently comprised of two (2) K-9 Officers and their highly trained (firearm and narcotics detecting) canine partner.\n\nThe DCSP K-9 Unit provides support to our agency by investigating firearm and narcotics-related incidents and threats. The DCSP K-9 Unit renders assistance to all other law enforcement agencies upon request. The DCSP K-9 Unit undergoes extensive training year-round and provides the highest level of professionalism when called upon to conduct area canvasses, safety searches, missing children searches, as well as narcotics searches throughout the county.\n\nThe DCSP K-9 Unit fully supports the school districtâ€™s mission, not only by way of providing law enforcement services but by also interacting with the students in a positive manner through educational presentations and participating in student events year-round."
