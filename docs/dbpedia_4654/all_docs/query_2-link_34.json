        "text": "Others in the spotlight include the hospital’s maxillofacial prosthetics team, whose incredible skill fashioning body parts like noses, ears and eyes are a masterclass in science and art.\n\nEach week the programme will follow the journeys of patients whose lives have been changed as a result of flesh-eating infections, challenging genetic conditions, and life-changing traumas.\n\nIt is not just about fixing broken bodies, but restoring identities, mending confidence, and helping patients and families rebuild their lives. There are touching moments as patients see their new reflections, and as families share their joy.\n\nFirst in the spotlight is patient Peter, who undergoes complex surgery in a final attempt to rebuild his nose after he lost it to cancer. Next surgeons battle to reattach 23-year-old Jack’s jaw after a horrific e-scooter crash. Lilie-Mai needs a growth removed from the top of her head which has destroyed her confidence. And prosthetist Nigel helps a young girl who was born without an ear and just wants to fit in at school.\n\nHelping the patients are consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon, Mr Ahid Abood, maxillofacial prosthetist, Mr Nigel Webster, consultant oral and maxillofacial head and neck surgeon, Mr Malcolm Cameron, and consultant plastic surgeon with a special interest in head and neck reconstruction and trauma, Mr Nicholas Segaren.\n\nFuture cases range from those who have lost facial features as a consequence of cancer, victims of road accidents whose facial appearances have been radically changed, and those born with conditions that make life tougher than they deserve.\n\nMedical director, Dr Ashley Shaw, said:\n\n'The Face Doctors' has been produced for Warner Bros. Discovery by Dragonfly TV, the same award-winning company that shot six series of BBC Two’s 'Surgeons: At the Edge of Life', which won wide acclaim and was watched by millions of viewers.\n\nTo learn more about surgeons in the series visit our The Face Doctors pages.\n\nFor information about working at CUH visit our careers."
