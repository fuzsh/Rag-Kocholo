        "text": "HANSCOM AIR FORCE BASE, Mass. – Military Working Dog handlers from the 66th Security Forces Squadron hosted civilian law enforcement officials for a K-9 team first aid training session Aug. 11.\n\nDr. Paul McNamara, a tactical veterinarian and special deputy with New York’s Dutchess County Sheriff’s Office, instructed more than 60 officers on how to perform basic emergency first aid on their K-9 partners.\n\n“The Federal Protective Service, with help from the 66th Security Forces Squadron at Hanscom, brought together federal, state and local law enforcement agencies from across New England to learn how to provide first aid to their canine police dogs,” said Suzanne E. Macmullin, deputy regional director for the Department of Homeland Security’s FPS Region One, who organized the event.\n\nMcNamara’s training included basic canine assessment, emergency treatment for dehydration, poisoning and more.\n\nAttending the one-day training at the base theater was Senior Airman Ashley Korthuis, 66 SFS Military Working Dog handler, who recently completed the Air Force’s MWD school at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas.\n\n“The training we are receiving today reinforces the training I received while attending canine school at Lackland,” she said. “Dr. McNamara is preparing us to better respond to medical emergencies with our canine partners that could be the difference in life or death while deployed or at home station.”\n\nThe first aid training session follows the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives National Canine Division’s National Odor Recognition Testing for K-9 teams that the squadron hosted at Hanscom early last year.\n\n“In addition to supporting Department of Defense missions, our military working dog teams are called to support other state and federal government agencies in the Northeast,” said Tech. Sgt. Victor Portes-Garcia, SFS MWD kennel master. “Building these relationships with our law enforcement partners provides invaluable training opportunities that are critical to our success at home and while deployed.”\n\nMaj. Brett Skates, 66 SFS commander, also discussed the value of partnerships with local agencies.\n\n\"Tech. Sgts. Victor Portes-Garcia and Charles Cornacchio have worked hard to network with local K-9 teams to develop relationships that make events like this a reality,” he said. “These relationships are important because any time we are able to engage and work with our local partners, the entire community benefits. The result is a world-class military working dog program that is highly regarded throughout the region.”\n\nIn addition to chief of surgery for a private veterinarian practice in New York, McNamara is a consulting veterinarian for numerous New York state and federal law enforcement agencies.\n\nHe is the founder of Odin’s Fund, a nonprofit that provides first aid training free of charge to K-9 handlers.\n\nThe doctor provided veterinarian services to search and rescue working dogs at the debris field in New York City following the attacks on Sept. 11.\n\n“There is no doubt that attending this training will help our handlers be better prepared in the event our canine partners are faced with a medical emergency,” Portes-Garcia said. “For us to have the opportunity to host this event at Hanscom Air Force Base is an excellent opportunity for our handlers and for all of the teams participating.\""
