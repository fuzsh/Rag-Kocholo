        "text": "K-9 Unit\n\nOur canines are qualified for patrol and search operations and have been used successfully for locating lost and missing persons. The teams have been very helpful with building and residential searches as well as tracking fleeing suspects. The narcotics dogs have been used widely by the department to locate and seize narcotics. These teams, canines and their handlers, are recognized by local and federal agencies and are frequently used for searching suspect vehicles and buildings. Each K-9 lives and works with his handler and becomes a part of their family, working with the deputy like a partner. These units must pass a strenuous selection process and are responsible for regular patrol duties as well. Special thanks to K9s4COPs for all their support!\n\nPatrol Canines\n\nLaw enforcement agencies all over the United States have long recognized the value of properly trained police service dogs. The police K-9, due to its strength, agility, courage, and other amazing capabilities, can be utilized to assist law enforcement in various tasks in a more thorough and efficient manner. Because of these attributes, police service dogs can be utilized to assist in searching for and the apprehension of potentially violent criminals. At times the K-9s are used to locate missing persons/children, track suspects from crime scenes, locate evidence and perform searches for hiding persons.\n\nIn general, the patrol K-9 is used to enhance the capability of patrol deputies responding to calls, to provide physical back-up when necessary and to provide psychological support. In potentially dangerous situations, a police K-9 can offer an incredible advantage by locating a hiding suspect, therefore, possibly preventing exposure of a police officer to a violent confrontation or at least giving the officer an indication a confrontation is immediately forthcoming. Just the mere presence of the K-9, most times, dynamically changes the suspects thinking and causes surrender.\n\nNarcotics Detection Canine\n\nPrecinct 4 narcotics dogs have been trained and are certified yearly to detect the presence of the odor of marijuana, methamphetamine, heroin, MDMA (ecstasy) and cocaine. The ability of the police K-9s to locate concealed narcotics contraband rests with two major qualities. The first is the dog’s amazing olfactory or sense of smell capability. When this remarkable sense is coupled with the dog’s strong play and hunting drives, the dogs are taught to associate the scent of specific narcotics with their “reward” or “toy.”\n\n​\n\nTo earn this reward, the dogs are trained to search boxes, rooms, yards, automobiles, buses, truck trailers, open areas and hundreds of other locations where there is a likelihood that someone may have hidden narcotics and give a particular indication. The K-9s are never allowed to come into contact with the narcotics as they are very dangerous to them.\n\nExplosives Detection Canine\n\nPrecinct 4 has canines certified in many areas including explosives and bomb detection and is trained to detect thousands of different types of explosives through scent recognition. Precinct 4 explosives detection canines are available to assist deputies on the job as well as surrounding agencies and communities including public and private schools, corporate offices, religious buildings, sports and entertainment venues, as well as government buildings. They are also available to assist with special events including football and basketball games, dignitary protection, and they give demonstrations at community events.\n\nAssisting Canines\n\n​The Harris County Constable Precinct 4 K-9 Unit constantly looks for areas to train. If you have an area such as a commercial building that is not occupied, an outdoor large fenced area, vacant apartments, a pipe yard, truck parking areas or other such areas where training can take place, please let us know. We strive to find facilities that are suitable for training or are going to be torn down or remodeled.\n\nWe train every week and make rounds to our different training areas so as to change the environment for the K-9s. Upon approval we also allow other agency’s K-9 units to use the area. In return, the mere presence of police K-9s and their handlers at your property deters crimes because the criminals never know when we are coming.\n\n​\n\nThere are several non-profit K-9 support organizations in the Houston area that provide training, equipment and K-9s to law enforcement agencies both here and across the nation. We are very proud of them. If you have the desire to learn more please contact them. Please click on one of the below links to learn more about their organization.\n\nFAQ"
