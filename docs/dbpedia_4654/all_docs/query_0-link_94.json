        "text": "Bob Baker, the co-writer of several classic Doctor Who serials with his writing partner Dave Martin, as well as a co-writer for the beloved world ofAardmanâs Wallace & Gromit, has died.\n\nAs reported by Bakerâs Twitter account for news about his iconic Doctor Who co-creation, the writer was 82. Alongside Martinâwho Baker began working with in the 1960s on stage plays and TV series like Z CarsâBaker is responsible for co-writing eight stories over nine seasons of the show in the â70s for both Jon Pertwee and Tom Bakerâs incarnations of the Doctor. Martin and Bakerâs oeuvre included beloved tales like âThe Claws of Axosâ or Doctor Whoâs first-ever anniversary special, âThe Three Doctors,â and Fourth Doctor tales such as âThe Sontaran Experiment,â âThe Hand of FearââElisabeth Sladenâs last regular appearance as iconic companion Sarah Jane Smithâand âThe Armageddon Factor.â\n\nBut perhaps most famous of all is âThe Invisible Enemy,â which introduced the robot dog K-9. Originally intended to be a one-off appearance, K-9 was instead entrusted to the Fourth Doctor at the end of the story and became a regular companion alongside Leela and Romana. After exiting the show four years later, Bakerâs legacy in K-9 would continue with K-9 and Company, a planned spinoff with Sladen that didnât make it past the original pilot, and of course, K-9’s brief return to Doctor Whoâs post-2005 era with the episode âSchool Reunion.â The character also had regular appearances in Sladenâs children-focused BBC spinoff The Sarah Jane Adventures, until her passing in 2011. Baker would return to K-9 as a character individually with the robot dogâs own self-titled show in 2009 and was purportedly planning to write a new series and movie featuring his canine creation before his death.\n\nOutside of his contributions to Doctor Who, Baker is also best-known as the co-writer of several of Aardman Animationâs Wallace & Gromit stories. Baker worked on original shorts The Wrong Trousers and A Close Shave, as well as the 2008 special A Matter of Loaf and Death (with series creator and director Nick Park), and wrote the script for the duoâs 2006 movie spinoff, Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. Baker is survived by his wife Marie, as well as his children and grandchildrenâour thoughts go out to his family in this sad time."
