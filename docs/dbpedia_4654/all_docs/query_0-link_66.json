During the interview Steven was asked about a return for for former companion K-9, to which he replied:\n\n“I love K-9! I nearly put him in Last Christmas.\n\nI had a whole scene where the Doctor was pointing out how ludicrous Santa Claus is, having a reindeer with a glowing nose and so on… and then in comes K-9.\n\nCompletely daft, but he’s brilliant. I’m totally up for K-9 when we have the right idea.”\n\nSteven, who also hints at a project outside Doctor Who and Sherlock (but is currently too busy for for a while), also discusses leaving the show:\n\n“I thought I’d be gone by now, to be honest. I thought I would get tired by it, and of it. But I haven’t. If anything, I think I cope with the stress and fatigue better than I used to.\n\nSo I take it a year at a time. But they might decide that they’ve had enough of me and kick me out!”\n\nSteven also goes on to describe Clara’s exit in Doctor Who Series 9 as “traumatic” and does not rule out a return for the Mondasian Cybermen, stating it’s not “impossible”. The full interview can be read in the current issue of TV & Satellite Week, on sale now.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated\n\nCameron K McEwan was the first owner and site editor of Blogtor Who since its creation in May 2008 until Dec 2015.
