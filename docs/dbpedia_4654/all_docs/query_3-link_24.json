        "text": "Emma’s Heat Alarm Campaign\n\nPlease help Emma, daughter of K9s United Founder Debbie Johnson, raise money for the advanced and life-saving Ace K9 Heat Alarm Systems!\n\nThere are key components to this life-saving heat alarm system and all are required to assure the safety of our K9 heroes. K9s United ensures law enforcement agencies can focus on keeping our streets safe, not how they can acquire this much-needed equipment.\n\nK9s United has a close partnership in purchasing these life-saving heat alarms, so we are able to receive a substantial discount, stretching your donor dollar. A heat alarm, including installation, can cost close to $2,000 (with our savings).\n\nLearn More →\n\nPASSING LAWS TO PROTECT K9s\n\nK9s are an extension of their handlers. They are living, breathing animals with a heartbeat, and they have one of the most dangerous jobs in law enforcement.\n\nOn September 30, 2018, K9 Fang made the ultimate sacrifice to save his handler and keep his community safe from an armed kidnapper. He was shot twice (once in the head) and murdered by a fleeing suspect, but K9 Fang bit deep into the man and never let go. Sadly, the man who killed K9 Fang didn’t get the sentence he deserved due to laws in place at the time.\n\nAfter much hard work and lobbying, K9s United celebrated in May of 2019 as Florida Governor Ron Desantis signed Senate Bill 96, which made killing a law enforcement canine in the line-of-duty a second-degree felony.\n\nLearn more about K9 Fang’s ultimate sacrifice and how you can get involved in the fight for national legislation to protect our fearless four-legged heroes.\n\nLearn More →"
