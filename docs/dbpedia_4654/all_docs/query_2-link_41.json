        "text": "So, while we gear up for Gatwa's first season, why not catch up on everything Doctor Who has to offer? After (almost) the entire Whoniverse dropped on BBC iPlayer, there are no excuses!\n\nHere's how to watch the whole Whoniverse in order. Get ready for the trip of a lifetime!\n\nThe following list is by release order, including Doctor Who and its main spin-offs: Torchwood (four seasons), The Sarah Jane Adventures (five seasons) and Class (one season), plus the failed spin-off K-9 and Company (just one pilot episode) and the newest release, Tales of the TARDIS (one season).\n\nMore like this\n\nIt's not essential to watch them in release order - you could watch all of Doctor Who followed by its spin-offs one by one - but there is some crossover between the main series and the spin-offs, so if you want the full experience, release order is the way to go!\n\nSome of the early episodes of Doctor Who have been lost, with some being revived in the form of animation.\n\nAn Unearthly Child, Doctor Who's first story (which consists of four episodes), did not arrive on BBC iPlayer with the rest of the episodes on 1st November 2023.\n\nThe BBC confirmed to RadioTimes.com that this is because of a rights issue - however, it is available to watch elsewhere.\n\nDoctor Who season 1 (1963)\n\nDoctor Who season 2 (1964)\n\nDoctor Who season 3 (1965)\n\nDoctor Who season 4 (1966)\n\nDoctor Who season 5 (1967)\n\nDoctor Who season 6 (1968)\n\nDoctor Who season 7 (1970)\n\nDoctor Who season 8 (1971)\n\nDoctor Who season 9 (1972)\n\nDoctor Who season 10 (1972)\n\nDoctor Who season 11 (1973)\n\nDoctor Who season 12 (1974)\n\nDoctor Who season 13 (1975)\n\nDoctor Who season 14 (1976)\n\nDoctor Who season 15 (1977)\n\nDoctor Who season 16 (1978)\n\nDoctor Who season 17 (1979)\n\nDoctor Who season 18 (1980)\n\nK-9 and Company (1981)\n\nDoctor Who season 19 (1982)\n\nDoctor Who season 20 (1983)\n\nThe Five Doctors (1983)\n\nDoctor Who season 21 (1984)\n\nDoctor Who season 22 (1985)\n\nDoctor Who season 23 (1986)\n\nDoctor Who season 24 (1987)\n\nDoctor Who season 25 (1988)\n\nDoctor Who season 26 (1989)\n\nDoctor Who was taken off air in 1989 and wouldn't return until 1996.\n\nDoctor Who TV movie (1996)\n\nAfter the TV movie, Doctor Who wouldn't return until the 2005 reboot, helmed by Russell T Davies.\n\nMultiple spin-offs were introduced, and the show featured regular Christmas (and then New Year) specials. There are also various anniversary specials included.\n\nDoctor Who season 1 (2005)\n\nDoctor Who: The Christmas Invasion (2005 Christmas special)\n\nDoctor Who season 2 (2006)\n\nDoctor Who: The Runaway Bride (2006 Christmas special)\n\nTorchwood season 1 (2006)\n\nDoctor Who season 3 (2006 to 2007)\n\nDoctor Who: Voyage of the Damned (2007 Christmas special)\n\nThe Sarah Jane Adventures season 1 (2007)\n\nTorchwood season 2 (2008)\n\nDoctor Who season 4 (2008)\n\nThe Sarah Jane Adventures season 2 (2008)\n\nDoctor Who: The Next Doctor (2008 Christmas special)\n\nDoctor Who: Planet of the Dead (2009 Spring special)\n\nTorchwood season 3: Children of Earth (2009)\n\nThe Sarah Jane Adventures season 3 (2009)\n\nDoctor Who: The Waters of Mars (2009 Autumn special)\n\nDoctor Who: The End of Time Part 1 and Part 2 (2009 Christmas special)\n\nDoctor Who season 5 (2010)\n\nDoctor Who: A Christmas Carol (2010 Christmas special)\n\nThe Sarah Jane Adventures season 4 (2010)\n\nDoctor Who season 6 (2011)\n\nDoctor Who: The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe (2011 Christmas special)\n\nTorchwood season 4: Miracle Day (2011)\n\nThe Sarah Jane Adventures season 5 (2011)\n\nDoctor Who season 7 part 1 (2012)\n\nDoctor Who: The Snowmen (2012 Christmas special)\n\nDoctor Who season 7 part 2 (2013)\n\nDoctor Who: The Night of the Doctor (2013 mini-episode)\n\nDoctor Who: The Day of the Doctor (2013 - 50th anniversary special)\n\nDoctor Who: The Time of the Doctor (2013 Christmas special)\n\nDoctor Who season 8 (2014)\n\nDoctor Who: Last Christmas (2014 Christmas special)\n\nDoctor Who season 9 (2015)\n\nDoctor Who: The Husbands of River Song (2015 Christmas special)\n\nClass (2016)\n\nDoctor Who: The Return of Doctor Mysterio (2016 Christmas special)\n\nDoctor Who season 10 (2017)\n\nDoctor Who: Twice Upon a Time (2017 Christmas special)\n\nDoctor Who season 11 (2018)\n\nDoctor Who: Resolution (2019 New Year special)\n\nDoctor Who season 12 (2020)\n\nDoctor Who: Revolution of the Daleks (2021 New Year special)\n\nDoctor Who season 13: Flux (2021)\n\nDoctor Who: Eve of the Daleks (2022 New Year special)\n\nDoctor Who: Legend of the Sea Devils (2022 Spring special)\n\nDoctor Who: The Power of the Doctor (2022 Autumn special)\n\nTales of the TARDIS (2023)\n\nDoctor Who: The Star Beast (2023 - 60th anniversary special)\n\nDoctor Who: Wild Blue Yonder (2023 - 60th anniversary special)\n\nDoctor Who: The Giggle (2023 - 60th anniversary special)\n\nDoctor Who: The Church on Ruby Road (2023 Christmas special)\n\nDoctor Who season 14 (coming in May 2024)\n\nDoctor Who 2024 Christmas special (coming in December 2024)\n\nDoctor Who season 15 (coming in May 2025)\n\nAlso worth a watch is An Adventure in Space and Time - the docudrama about the beginnings of Doctor Who. The special episode was first released in 2013 for the show's 50th anniversary, and re-vamped for the 60th anniversary in 2023.\n\nHow to watch Doctor Who by Doctor\n\nIt goes without saying that watching all of Doctor Who in release order is... a lot.
