        "text": "After a Christmas-set celebration to mark its 60th anniversary, a brand new series of Doctor Who is finally here with Ncuti Gatwa’s new Doctor, Millie Gibson’s new companion Ruby Sunday and a brand new way for viewers to watch the action.\n\nWith its three anniversary specials and a Christmas special, The Church on Ruby Road, airing in late 2023, showrunner Russell T. Davies introduced the world to their new Time Lord and companion.\n\nWhat’s more, following the BBC’s co-production deal with Welsh company Bad Wolf Studios and global distribution deal with Disney+, the future of Doctor Who looks bright, with new ways for fans to get up to speed on the Doctor’s adventures earlier than ever.\n\nRead more: Who is in the cast of Doctor Who season 14?\n\nBut when will the next episode be on TV? Here’s everything you need to know…\n\nWhen is the next episode of Doctor Who on TV?\n\nThe third episode of Doctor Who series 14, titled Boom, will air on BBC One on 6:50pm on Saturday, 18 May. The episode will land on BBC iPlayer at midnight on Saturday, while those outside the UK can watch it on Disney+.\n\nThe previous two episodes, Space Babies and The Devil’s Chord, aired on Saturday, 11 May as a part of a double-bill.\n\nHere is the full release schedule for the rest of the season:\n\nSaturday, 18 May: Boom (episode 3)\n\nSaturday, 25 May: 73 Yards (episode 4)\n\nSaturday, 1 June: Dot and Bubble (episode 5)\n\nSaturday, 8 June: Rogue (episode 6)\n\nSaturday, 15 June: The Legend of Ruby Sunday (episode 7)\n\nSaturday, 22 June: Empire of Death (episode 8)\n\n“At last, it’s my great delight to unleash a whole new season of the Doctor and Ruby’s adventures together,” said Davies announcing the show’s return. “Monsters! Chases! Villains! Mysteries! And a terrifying secret that’s been spanning time and space for decades. Don’t miss a second!”\n\nFilming on the eight-episode series began in December 2022, with directors Mark Tonderai (who made 2018 episodes The Ghost Monument and Rosa), Dylan Holmes Williams, (Apple TV’s Servant) and Julie Anne Robinson (Netflix’s Bridgerton) behind the camera on the new series’ first three production blocks.\n\nThe new season’s episode titles have been confirmed. They are: Space Babies, The Devil’s Chord, Boom, 73 Yards, Dot and Bubble, Rogue, and two-part finale The Legend of Ruby Sunday and Empire of Death. Steven Moffat has returned to the franchise to write Boom.\n\nThe first episode to feature the Fifteenth Doctor and Ruby Sunday was the Christmas special, which saw the pair meet for the first time as they faced some cheeky goblins set on stealing a baby. The Doctor Who Christmas special was a fixture of the Christmas Day schedule from 2005 to 2017 but the specials starring Jodie Whittaker’s Thirteenth Doctor went out on New Year’s Day instead.\n\nIs there a trailer for Doctor Who series 14?\n\nYes, on Easter Monday a new trailer was revealed for season 14 that teased the show’s big return and gave viewers a much closer look at the adventures that The Doctor and Ruby go on together. This included the first look at Jinkx Monsoon’s mysterious character, and the show’s regency era episode and their encounter with The Beatles.\n\nWatch Doctor Who’s Easter trailer:\n\nFollowing the release of the Christmas special, the BBC revealed a first-look trailer for the upcoming series, which is also being referred to as season 1, that showed The Doctor and Ruby’s adventures across time and space.\n\nIt also teased the new series’ many guest stars, and how they will interact with the two characters during their time together.\n\nWatch the trailer for Doctor Who series 14 below:\n\nWhen was Doctor Who series 13 released?\n\nBefore the 2023 specials dropped, it had been a while since we'd last seen the Doctor for an extended outing. While we’ve had the six-part miniseries Flux, aka Series 13, and a series of specials throughout 2022 and 2023 — there hasn’t been a full-length run since Jodie Whittaker’s second series in early 2020.\n\nThen again, given the COVID-19 pandemic and filming restrictions that followed, it’s a marvel that we’ve had any new Doctor Who at all. But with returning head writer and executive producer Davies spearheading the next era, the plan is to return to annual Doctor Who series going forward.\n\nIn his column for Doctor Who Magazine, RTD said: “It takes a while to get the empire in shape, but that’s a serious plan: annual Doctor Who, no gap years, lots of content, on and on and on. Yes please!”\n\nWhat do we know about Doctor Who series 15?\n\nSeason 14 may not yet be on our screens but news has started to be revealed about series 15 ahead of time, including the introduction of a new main cast member: Varada Sethu.\n\nSethu is joining Millie Gibson as a companion in series 15, with the actor already filming new scenes alongside Ncuti Gatwa. Her casting was officially announced by the BBC in April.\n\nIn a statement, the actor shared: “I feel like the luckiest person in the world. It is such an honour to be a part of the Whoniverse, and I’m so grateful to the whole Doctor Who family — because that is what they are — for welcoming me with open arms and making me feel so at home. I couldn’t ask for a better team than Ncuti and Millie to be on this adventure with, this is so much fun!”\n\nElsewhere some of the directors for the upcoming series has also been confirmed. Per Doctor Who Magazine, Amanda Brotchie and Makalla McPherson are set to direct an episode each from series 15.\n\nSpeaking to the publication about joining the franchise, Brotchie said: “Russell has magicked up sensational episodes, with action, humour and emotion, and am ambitious vision I feel privileged to be able to realise on the screen. I love that about Doctor Who, that each episode is like its own feature film.”"
