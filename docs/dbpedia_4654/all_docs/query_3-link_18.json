        "text": "A job as a K9 officer can bridge your love of animals with your love of helping people and keeping your community safe. K9 officers — those who are trained to work closely with police dogs — are typically responsible for specialized tasks, like looking for missing persons and tracking down explosive devices. As a part of police forces in all levels, as well as government agencies and even private services, K9 officers are an incredibly important part of the police.\n\nIf you’re thinking about becoming a police officer and then training as a K9 officer, which is a more specialized unit within the police force, you may want to start by looking at how much K9 officers make on average. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), as of 2020, police and detectives earned a median pay of $67,290 per year, which calculates to about $32.35 per hour. The job outlook in this field is also solid, with a 5% projected job growth through 2029 — which is slightly higher than the national average.\n\nThere are obvious perks to becoming a K9 officer. That said, it’s important to understand what these officers do, what skills you need in this field, what education and training you’ll need, and other important factors before making a move.\n\nFeatured Online Criminal Justice Programs\n\nFind a program that meets your affordability, flexibility, and education needs through an accredited, online school.\n\nWhat Does a K9 Officer Do?\n\nK9 officers are a unique, specially trained group of officers. As with all police officers, K9 officer duties are to enforce local, state, or federal laws, though the specific duties they are responsible for will vary depending on where the agency they work for and other factors. Some K9 officers work on detecting explosives, whereas others are on the hunt for illicit drugs or weapons.\n\nBecause the K9 unit is trained in a unique manner, they are highly valued and may work unconventional schedules because of it. Some agencies have K9 officers on call 24/7. That’s because the dogs are needed at the drop of a hat to sniff out a body, a person, illegal substances, or other items that are best handled by the nose of a trained police dog.\n\nK9 officers can work in a number of different capacities both inside and outside of the police force. You’ll find K9 officers at airports, high-security public places, courthouses, and other locations that require a dog’s special skills.\n\nK9 agents must care for and form a bond with their police dog — which is one of the most important factors in this equation. In order to be effective in this role, K9 officers must be able to work well with animals and have the ability to maintain control of their police dogs at all times. After hours, K9 agents take their police dog partner home and serve as its handler while off-duty.\n\nAside from partnering with police dogs, K9 officers also regularly interact with other law enforcement professionals and citizens. It’s the duty of most K9 officers to gather evidence, analyze data, and take appropriate legal action based on information.\n\nKey Skills for K9 Officers\n\nK9 officers need the same skills as other police officers, in addition to skills in animal handling.

This helps to be competitive with admission to the police academy and K9 officer applications. Earning a degree prior to entering this field also makes it more likely to be offered advanced jobs at higher levels, like at the state or federal level or with government agencies.\n\nK9 officers typically start in this field as police officers, which means you must complete the police academy and learn all of the required skills for becoming an officer. Once on the job, an officer will be trained on how to be a K9 officer, including the proper ways to work with their dogs so they can better understand what the dogs are responsible for. These officers will also be trained in the areas they’re going to specialize in, whether it’s acting as a narcotics agent, responding to bomb threats, searching for missing people, or in another capacity.\n\nK9 Officer Salary and Career Outlook\n\nHow much do K9 officers make?
