        "text": "Back to when UK Gold were repeating classic Doctor Who – in fact, this was for the 30th anniversary, so I make that 1993.\n\nAnd this story is apparently the winner of the best monster – Warriors Of The Deep. Did they exclude Daleks and Cybermen from the poll? Check out those jumpsuits.\n\nThe Tardis runs on BBC Basic\n\nThat’s 60s Scream Queen Ingrid Pitt playing Dr Solow.\n\nAnd that’s 70s horror icon Ian McCulloch too, as Nilson. I presume he’s playing him foreign, otherwise I’ve no explanation for him pronouncing the word ‘Demise’ as ‘Demeez’.\n\nIt pleased me no end that so much of the on-screen graphics for the show at this time were generated by a BBC Micro.\n\n“How do you feel, Maddox?” after a bit of brainwashing. He’s more compliant, plus his eyeshadow is fabulous. He’ll be fronting a New Romantic synth band before the story is out.\n\nThe Doctor’s plan is to set the reactor to overload, then in the confusion, slip back to the Tardis. This seems reckless. Perhaps he was watching Hostile Waters. But they’re not quick enough and are found. The Doctor does some fighting, but at least he apologises when he elbows someone in the stomach. But he’s pushed over the edge – nice stunt – and Turlough is immediately “Oh forget him, Tegan, he’s drowned.” I never liked Turlough.\n\nI haven’t even mentioned the Silurians yet, and they’re the big villains.\n\nAnd the Sea Devils, who I always preferred because I saw them first. I missed most of Jon Pertwee’s first season, or at least I have no memory of seeing it. But the Sea Devils was a very strong memory. Nice use of mirrors to make it look like there’s loads of them.\n\nThe Sea Devil commander appears to be called Cervix.\n\nFirst the fighting, now pointing guns. I thought Davison’s Doctor was supposed to be the wimpy one.\n\nDid the Doctor not bother with locking the Tardis? They just randomly walked in.\n\nThe miniatures in this are probably about as good as the subs in Hostile Waters.\n\nThe infamous monster in this story is the Myrka. Not terrible, but doesn’t really work in such a brightly lit set.\n\nMaddox has picked totally the wrong time for a server upgrade.\n\nThe lead Silurian is Ichtar, whom the Doctor met in their previous encounter. I’m sure this was very exciting for fans who remembered his name.\n\nOther delights in this story are Ingrid Pitt karate kicking the Myrka.\n\nIn the end, it’s a bit of a downer, with everybody but the principal cast dead, and the Doctor lamenting “There should have been another way.”\n\nNext on this tape, K9 And Company, the show’s attempt to produce a spin-off. Not a stupid idea by any means, after all, The Sarah Jane Adventures was a terrific show over 20 years later, but this one wasn’t quite special enough to tempt the BBC into a series.\n\nIt starts off with some good old-fashioned devil worship, with lots of robed figures walking around chanting ‘Hecate, Hecate’, although it sounds a bit like they’re chanting ‘Hegarty, Hegarty’ like they’re the goth fanclub of Darts’ singer Den Hegarty.\n\nThey’re burning a picture which we immediately learn is the picture of Lavinia Smith, local scientist, who recently upset the village by writing about local evidence of devil worship. Oh, and she’s Sarah Jane’s aunt. And she’s just about to travel to the US.\n\nHer friend and neighbour is explaining to her about how some in the village were put out when she wrote the letter about witchcraft. And she absolutely, guaranteed, will turn out to be someone big in the local coven by the time the programme is out, I mean, look at her.\n\nIt’s funny, but I can’t help thinking of these two as Amelia Rumford and Vivien Fay from the Who story The Stones of Blood.\n\nSome time later, Sarah Jane Smith arrives at her aunt’s house, intending to visit her for Christmas. There’s nobody there, and she’s met by creepy gardener George Tracey, played by Colin Jeavons. He was always great at playing creepy characters, which always made his parallel career as a presenter on Play School seem all the more discordant.\n\nHis son seems a little less creepy. Young Peter arrives a little later offering a flask of tea from his dad. He’s wearing a studded leather jacket, so you can be sure he’s got a delinquent past. He’s played by Sean Chapman, and always seemed familiar to me, but it wasn’t until just this moment that it clicked who he was – he plays evil Uncle Frank in Clive Barker’s Hellraiser.\n\nAs well as leaving Sarah Jane in the lurch with her sudden disappearance, Aunt Lavinia has also invited her young ward Brendan to the house for the holiday, back from boarding school.\n\nWhen they get back to the house, Bill Pollock is waiting there, introducing himself as her aunt’s partner. He’s played by Bill Fraser. He complains that their business has had two terrible years.\n\nFinally, she gets around to opening a large crate which Aunt Lavinia has had hanging around for ages, since she lived in Croydon.\n\nIt’s K9 – Mark III. A gift from the Doctor. Sarah had left the show before K9 was introduced so she doesn’t know what he is, but I love her reaction when he tells her he’s from the Doctor. It’s a tiny fraction of the emotion that her return to the show in 2006 caused, but it’s there nevertheless.\n\nSadly, this scene then becomes young Brendan reeling off a bunch of technical phrases, some of which are a bit sci-fi, others are genuine computer terms from the time. “Do you have a UART?” he asks. He’ll be asking where he can insert his floppy next.\n\nShe’s invited to a party at the Baker’s, where she’s introduced to the editor of the local newspaper, Henry Tobias, played by John Quarmby. Judging by the musical sting that accompanies their meeting, he’s a wrong-un too.\n\nBack at the house, Brendan is attacked by two people, but K9 is there to stun them.\n\nIt’s the Traceys. Young Peter wakes up, hands tied up by Brendan, and warns him. “Get away from here. You and the girl. You’ve got to get away.” Rather than a threat, this sound like a warning. Perhaps Peter is an unwilling accomplice in whatever is happening.\n\nTracey escapes but his father tells him that the other Hecate worshippers will have their revenge if he doesn’t get Brendon. Which he does.\n\nWhen she discovers he’s missing, Sarah Jane tries the police, who are a bit rubbish. A lot of this story reminds me of Hot Fuzz without the jokes.\n\nNot completely useless, though, as one of them knows about Brendan’s kidnap, and is unhappy, so he ends up dead on the road.\n\nPeter Tracey reluctantly gets initiated into the witchy group.\n\nSarah talks to the Bakers, but they’re acting very skeptical, and condescending.\n\nThere’s the old horror film trope of the near miss with a tractor.\n\nThe villagers are genuinely going to sacrifice Brendan.\n\nThis went out at 5:45 on a Christmas Bank Holiday evening, just before Terry & June. Is devil worship and human sacrifice suitable for that slot?\n\nDon’t worry, though, kids, K9 zaps all the bad people.\n\nAnd Sarah Jane does some high kicking of her own. “Put that in your leader Mr Tobias.”\n\nShe unmasks the leader of the coven – and I swear, I would have said this was Juno Baker – it’s the old prone unconscious face problem. But it’s not, it’s another villager.\n\nAnd the other leader is Bill Pollock – who’s similarly hard to recognise.\n\nAnd, in the show’s most surprise moment, the slightly creepy Bakers turn out to have had nothing to do with the coven.\n\nAfter this, recording switches and there’s the first ten minutes of episode two of The Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy. I don’t know why there’s only that much of it. Seems odd I would start recording then stop. Still, we get to see Douglas Adams in the opening, worrying about money.\n\nBut after a few minutes of this, the recording stops, and underneath there’s the end of the Doctor Who documentary Resistance is Useless – appropriate because the Hitchhiker’s scene just before this is the one where the vogon guard says that all the time.\n\nAfter this, recording stops again, and underneath, there’s some classic Eastenders. The tape ends during this omnibus edition.\n\nAdverts:"
