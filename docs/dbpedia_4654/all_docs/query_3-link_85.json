        "text": "Todd Jordan\n\nTodd Jordan is the owner, program developer, and chief trainer at Jordan Detection K9. Jordan started his company in 2015 after successfully training and handling an Electronic Detection K9 to assist investigators in child exploitation, counter terrorism, white collar crimes, homicide investigations, insider threats, and drug cases. Jordan Detection K9 became well known after Jordan’s first ESD K9 \"Bear\" detected key evidence in Subway Pitchman Jared Fogle’s home. \"Bear\" later located key evidence in United States Gymnastics Coach Marvin Sharp's residence, as well as his gymnasium. Since that time, Jordan has trained over one hundred ESD K9s. The K9s have been sold to departments associated with ICAC task forces across the nation. Jordan’s background in K9 handling and training began in 1997 as an Accelerant Detection K9 handler. Since 2000, Todd began training accelerant detection K9s for the Maine Specialty Dogs/State Farm Program, obtaining and imprinting the K9s, prior to being placed with a handler. He has trained twenty five accelerant detection K9s, all of which became certified through the State Farm Program or Canine Accelerant Detection Association (CADA). Of the twenty five K9s trained, eleven teams are still certified and are currently working in the United States. The other ten enjoyed successful careers, and have gone on to retire from their departments. Todd has participated in thirty re-certification courses as a handler/trainer. Todd has been a Certifying Official from 2013-2022 for CADA. He has been the Chief Certifying Official in charge of all CADA Certifications world wide. He has personally certified over fifty K9 teams for CADA. Todd has also sat on the Board of Directors for CADA from 2014-2022."
