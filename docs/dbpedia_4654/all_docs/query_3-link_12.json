        "text": "Welcome to the USPCA - 50 years and counting!\n\nThe United States Police Canine Association, Inc. (USPCA) was established in 1971 when two canine associations joined. Much has been learned about Police Canines in over fifty years of service, there is still more to be done to develop their potential. Our members have found that participation in USPCA certifications and training is an invaluable tool for performing their jobs. The strength of both the Regional and National offices lies in the diversity of the membership. This diversity facilitates the sharing of ideas and information within an organized, neutral forum. Some of our member benefits include an extensive repository of training articles along with information designed to keep everyone updated. The USPCA is the nation's largest, continuously operating organization that promotes quality-trained and certified canine teams.\n\nWe have set forth an ambitious plan to understand police canine issues and then set best practices in areas of needed improvement. This resulted in our Best Practices in Contemporary Canine Policing videos located on the USPCA YouTube site.\n\nWe also allied with the American Kennel Club, which resulted in benefits to help USPCA members achieve grants for canine purchases. This benefit is available for law enforcement agencies wishing to purchase a dog for their program.\n\nThe Members Make Us What We Are\n\nPlease, look at our website and social media to understand how we can help you. If you like what you see, please join us.\n\nWe would love to have you as a member! If you have never been a USPCA member, click on the below link. If you have been a member in the past, please contact Secretary Ruopp and she will walk you through the process of renewing. Please do not create a new profile if you have been a member in the past.\n\nCLICK HERE TO JOIN THE USPCA\n\nCLICK HERE TO JOIN THE USPCA"
