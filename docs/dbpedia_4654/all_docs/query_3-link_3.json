The K-9 may be trained for on-line tracking and trailing, but does not physically contact suspects.\n\nDual Purpose\n\nTeams trained and certified to locate people, protect officers and apprehend suspects; as well as being trained and certified in the detection of certain odors and evidence. They are also trained for on-line or off-line tracking or trailing.\n\nProgram Goal\n\nUp to 24 dogs\n\nStudies show that one well-trained dog can save approximately 800 personnel hours per year.\n\nSome estimates place the scenting capabilities of a dog at up to a million times greater than a human, which allows them to quickly find concealed evidence and items.\n\nTrained Dogs\n\nProtect their handler, other law enforcement officers, and the public.\n\nTrack suspects and missing persons, perform area and building searches to locate suspects.\n\nDetect illegally taken wildlife, invasive species, hidden firearms, expended casings, and other evidence or articles.\n\nAssist in the arrest of suspects.\n\nAssist in locating lost or missing persons/officers.\n\nPerform valuable educational demonstrations and programs.\n\nDetection Training"
