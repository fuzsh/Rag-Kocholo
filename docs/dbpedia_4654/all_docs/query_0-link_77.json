        "text": "\"Bob was a prolific Film and Television writer,\" it reads. \"Alongside his late writing partner, Dave Martin, they were stalwarts of children's Television in the 1970s, with a well-earned reputation for bizarre and spine-tingling adventure. They wrote many of what have become to be regarded by fans worldwide as true classic BBC TV Doctor Who stories; creating many well-remembered enemies for the time lord during the Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker years.\"\n\nAs well as being responsible for a wealth of fan favourite Doctor Who stories, Baker and his partner Martin were also the minds behind the Doctor's robot dog companion, K9, who made his first appearance in The Invisible Enemy.\n\nThe official Doctor Who Twitter account also posted a tribute to the writer, saying: \"Weâ€™re sad to hear that Bob Baker has passed away, who wrote many of the Doctor's adventures, and was the co-creator of K9.\"\n\nMore like this\n\nIn addition to their work for Doctor Who, Baker and Martin also wrote cult TV series SKY and King of the Castle. He went on to work on the Wallace & Gromit films alongside creator Nick Park.\n\nFellow Doctor Who writer Eddie Robson paid tribute to Baker on Twitter, writing: \"RIP Bob Baker, who once wrote his own murder into a Wallace & Gromit film.\"\n\nRobson also shared two pictures of said scene, with Baker himself in classic Aardman style.\n\nBefore he became a writer, Baker was a monumental stonemason and an animator. He also wrote an autobiography, K9 Stole My Trousers, which takes a look at his more than five-decades-long career in entertainment.\n\nLater in life, Baker also set up a production company which \"created a new audience for K9 with a TV series shown worldwide via Disney, Cartoon Network and BBC Kids\".\n\nBaker had recently written scripts for a new K9 film and TV series which will \"continue in tribute to Bob and his legacy\"."
