K9 is a science-fiction adventure series focusing on the adventures of the robot dog K9 from the television show Doctor Who, achieved by mixing computer animation and live action.[2] It is aimed at an audience of 11- to 15-year-olds.[3] A single series of the programme was made in Brisbane, Australia, with co-production funding from Australia and the United Kingdom.[4] It aired in 2009 and 2010 on Network Ten in Australia, and on Disney XD in the UK, as well as being broadcast on other Disney XD channels in Europe. Created due to a contracting loophole that allowed production companies to make deals directly with Doctor Who creators, it was cancelled after one series due to bad reviews and low ratings.
