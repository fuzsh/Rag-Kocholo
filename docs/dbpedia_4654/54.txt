'Doctor Who' favourite K9 is to return in a new children's television series.

K9 with the Fourth Doctor

The robotic canine companion - who made his debut in the BBC One sci-fi series back in 1977 alongside Fourth Doctor Tom Baker - is to be the main hero in the upcoming show which will focus on an intergalactic space war.

K9 is to get a major design overhaul for the project to bring the electronic pooch into the 21st century.

A source told the Daily Mirror newspaper: "He's going to look more industrial and be covered in rivets."

K9 was originally created by Dave Martin and Bob Baker and proved to be hugely popular amongst 'Doctor Who' fans going on to appear in several spin-offs, including TV pilot 'K9 and Company' in 1981.

Since 'Doctor Who' was brought back to TV screens in 2005 the metal mutt has featured in the show and was last seen in the 2006 episode 'School Reunion' with the Tenth Doctor - played by David Tennant - and the Fourth Doctor's much loved companion Sarah-Jane Smith, portrayed by the late Elizabeth Sladen.

K9 was then a regular in spin-off CBBC show 'The Sarah Jane Adventures' and even appeared in one-off Australian show 'K-9', in which he was brought to life by original voice actor John Leeson.
