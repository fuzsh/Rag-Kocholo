        "text": "My interest in medicine emerged because I have a family member who has sickle cell anemia. Her condition predisposed her to develop hip arthritis at a young age, which had a negative impact on all aspects of her life. She eventually underwent a total hip replacement, and almost immediately, her pain, perceived appearance, and functionality improved. I was impressed with the significant change in her quality of life, and this sparked my interest in medicine and the specialty of orthopedics.\n\nAs a spinal surgeon, I treat patients of all ages who fall anywhere on the spectrum of spine disease, ranging from cervical spine fractures, degenerative disc disease, and scoliosis to slipped discs. At NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn, our orthopedic team includes specialists who focus on hand, foot and ankle, spine, sports, and trauma-related injuries, as well as reconstructive joint replacement.\n\nWe are a one-stop shop for patients; my colleagues and I collaborate to provide the best treatments. Orthopedic care is a team sport that relies on multiple players—surgeons, physiatrists, physical therapists, and most importantly, our patients.\n\nResearch is an integral part of my role as a physician–surgeon. In my clinical research, I evaluate standing balance of the spine using our full body X-ray technology. I also investigate how small spinal fusions influence overall standing balance and look for factors to help patients avoid surgery.\n\nI am member of the North American Spine Society."
