        "text": "This is a draft report prepared for the debriefing on Operation “Kama” in Moscow in early January 1963. The submarine commanders drafted the report in December 1962 as they were preparing to brief top political and military leadership in Moscow. It is safe to assume that Arkhipov probably drafted the text because he was the main presenter in Moscow. The report mentions preparations for the mission, its reduced size, and weather conditions for crossing the Atlantic Ocean. It emphasizes the overwhelming dominance and aggressive actions of U.S. anti-submarine forces (“a hundred times stronger than ours in their combat capabilities”) against B-36, B-59 and B-130, which had to surface for repairs and to charge their batteries. The report mentions that B-36 was attacked by a torpedo, but that it missed the boat because it was submerging very fast. The report is completely silent about any incidents on B-59, which implies that at the time of the drafting of the report, the commanders intended to keep the information secret."
