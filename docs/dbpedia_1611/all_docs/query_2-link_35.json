        "text": "Understand\n\n[edit]\n\nWith a population of over 300,000, Murmansk is the largest city in the Arctic and an important Russian naval base and commercial port. Unlike Arkhangelsk on the White Sea, its harbor does not freeze in winter. It was the last city founded by the Russian Empire. In World War II, known to Russians as the Great Patriotic War, Murmansk served as a port for the arctic convoys, and after the war became the Soviet Union's most important submarine base. This history provides a major reason to visit the city, museums and port.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the Far North, Murmansk experiences cold winters with temperatures routinely dropping below −20 °C (−4 °F). The brief summer offers mild temperatures between 10–15 °C (50–59 °F). Strong winds are common, especially at the higher parts of the city.\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nThe airport is about 40 km (25 mi) south of Murmansk, near the town of Murmashi. Taxis to the city center cost 600-700 руб and make the trip in about 40 minutes. Catching a taxi waiting outside the airport is more expensive, expect to pay up to 800 руб, depending on your language and negotiation skills. For cheaper (and official) taxi service, you have to order a taxi, expect to wait up to 30–40 minutes for it to arrive, though. Bus 106 goes to the train station, stopping at Detsky Mir near the Poliarnie Zori Hotel on its way, is less expensive but much more sluggish than a taxi.\n\nBy boat\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the summer months, offers occasional trips to and from Barentsburg on Svalbard. They also serve remote villages along the northern coast of the Kola peninsula, most notably the isolated naval base of Ostrovnoy, with 2-3 trips per month.\n\nA few cruise lines also visit the city during the summer season. The pier facilities are nil, basically a bare pier in a freight handling area, but with areas for buses, taxis, etc.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nMurmansk can be reached from most places in north-west Russia by train. Moscow is 35–40 hours away and Saint Petersburg 27–30 hours, depending on the train. The Arktika (Арктика) branded train is the fastest option, with first-class wagons and a restaurant on board. All long-distance trains make stop-overs in cities such as Kandalaksha and Petrozavodsk on their way. Other night trains reach Murmansk from cities as far east as Arkhangelsk or from Minsk and Brest in the west. Trains from Saint Petersburg and Moscow are daily, most others 2-3 times a week. During summer additional routes are added, mostly to Ukraine and the Black Sea.\n\nTickets can be bought either at the station or online at the webpage of national operator RZD.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nPasvik Turist [dead link] provides a bus connection from Kirkenes in Norway daily at 14:00 or 15:00 (confirm on website) for 350 NOK one-way or 600 NOK return (Sept 2017). They also offer Russian taxi (maximum 3 passengers) from 2000 NOK one way. A once-weekly bus service is also available from Ivalo, Finland by Auto Express.\n\nBook in advance, and be there on time, since it is a bad idea to miss the bus and overstay Russian visas.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are roads from Ivalo, Finland (290 km) and Kirkenes, Norway (220 km). When calculating travel time expect hour-long waits at the border and keep the time difference in mind. A trip starting in Kirkenes at 09:00 (Norwegian time) might end at 16:00 (Russian time).\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough Murmansk is long and thin, most sites of interest to visitors are within a fairly compact area in the city center. is the main north-south thoroughfare through the city center and the central Five Corners Square. Avid walkers could cover the entire stretch of the central area from the Poliarnie Zori Hotel on the south end of the city center to the Alyosha Statue, on a plateau on the north side of the city, in less than two hours.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nTrolleybuses are available on most larger streets and generally follows a north-south route, if you are heading east (\"up the hill\") you have to rely on the small marshrutka buses. Both buses and trolleybuses can be much delayed during rush hours due to traffic jams. A route planner showing real time location of trolleybuses on the most used lines is available online[dead link] , the catch is it's in Russian only.\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nAnother option is to use taxis which are plentiful and cheap, few drivers speak anything other than Russian, so memorize the street or name of the place you are going to. A typical journey in the city centre will cost somewhere around 400 руб. Unmarked taxis can be cheaper, but are generally a bit unreliable to use for those not fluent in the native tongue.\n\nSee\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a relatively new city, Murmansk has few real sights apart from the giant statue Alyosha; architecture buffs will, however, be intrigued by the crumbling Stalinist architecture downtown. The architecture is complemented by trees and other vegetation receiving little care.\n\nWalking up into the nearby hills offers remarkable views over the city, Kola bay, beautiful lakes, and the surrounding completely barren mountains - revealing how far north the city really is.\n\nThe city has several museums, all mildly interesting compared to larger cities in Russia, but they do offer a good appreciation for the regions history and art."
