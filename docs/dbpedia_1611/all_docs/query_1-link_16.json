Chandler went on to serve as President Grant's Secretary of the Interior and died shortly after being re-elected to the Senate in 1879.\n\nAbraham Lincoln (1809-1865) - 16th President of the United States, first Republican President, President during the Civil War. Abraham Lincoln was born in Kentucky and grew up in Illinois, becoming an attorney as a young man. Lincoln entered the Illinois Legislature and was nominated by the newly formed Republican Party as their candidate for President in 1860 after having lost the 1858 Illinois Senate election to Stephen Douglas. After seeing the Union preserved through the Civil War, Lincoln was killed by John Wilkes Booth, becoming the first President to be assassinated. A symbol of persistence and fortitude, Lincoln was born into poverty, twice failed in business, and yet became one of the nation's greatest presidents.\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR), was President of the United States from 1933-1945. Roosevelt is the longest serving president in US history, having been elected four terms. He was from a prominent New York family. Roosevelt became President of the US during the great depression. He was stricken with polio in his early thirties. Roosevelt very rarely had his picture taken in a wheelchair, as only two such photographs are known to exist. Also featured in the photograph are Fala, his beloved Scottish Terrier, and Ruthie Bie. The photo was taken at Hill Top Cottage in Hyde Park, N.Y.\n\nMargaret Lynch Suckley took the famous photograph. She was a distant cousin, intimate friend, and confidante of FDR, as well as an archivist for the first American presidential library.\n\nRuthie Bie was the granddaughter of his Hyde Park caretaker.\n\nFew Americans knew that he was \"disabled\" and could not walk. He died in April 1945 shortly before the end of WW II.\n\nRoosevelt is known for the New Deal and being President during WW II.\n\nAmelia Earhart (1897-1937) - Aviator, explorer, teacher, author, advocate for women's rights. Earhart was born in Atchison, Kansas. She grew up during the first generation of aviators and quickly developed an interst in, and later an affinity for, aviation. In 1923 she became just the 16th woman in the United States to be awarded a pilot's license, and in 1928 became the first woman in the world to fly across the Atlantic Ocean. She became a faculty member at Purdue University and continued her pioneering in aviation. Flying on a Lockheed 10E on the last leg of an attempt to fly around the world, she disappeared while trying to fly across the Pacific Ocean in 1937.\n\nLetter from Zachariah Chandler to Abraham Lincoln, 1861 - Zachariah Chandler was a successful business man, experimental farmer, and lawyer from Michigan. He became Michigan's first Republican Senator in 1859. When the Civil War broke out, Chandler was one of the most vocal supporters of the Union and ardent critics of Southern secession.

After Lincoln's assassination, Chandler became one of the Radical Republicans in the Senate and later went on to serve in the Grant Administration as Secretary of the Interior.\n\nGuardian Building, Detroit, Wirt Rowland, Smith, Hinchman & Grylls, 1929- One of the best examples of Art-Deco architecture in Detroit, the Guardian Building is typical of office high rises built in the 1920s. Originally built as the Union Trust building, its orange-brown color and unique Pewabic and Rookwood tile make it a very recognizable landmark in downtown Detroit. This picture was taken around 1980 and shows the building amidst the other architectural styles in the city, including the Renaissance Center, Michigan's tallest building, to the left. The building currently houses the architectural firm that designed it.\n\nGuardian Building Michigan Mural, Detroit, Wirt Rowland, Smith, Hinchman & Grylls, 1929- One of the best examples of Art-Deco architecture in Detroit, the Guardian Building is typical of office high rises built in the 1920s. This Mural, designed by Ezra Winter, contains symbols of Michigan's main economic staples from the era in which the building was built. The building is one of Detroit's most significant structures and currently houses the architectural firm that designed it. It was placed on the National Historic Register in 1989 and is a central part of Detroit's downtown financial district.\n\nHoover Dam, Constructed 1931-1936- The Hoover Dam is the largest hydroelectric dam in the United States, and one of the largest in the world. Construction on the Dam started during the Herbert Hoover Administration, and it is named after him. It was completed under the Franklin Roosevelt Administration as a massive public works project during the Great Depression. The dam contains enough concrete to pave a two lane road from the east to west coast. 112 men were killed during the construction of the Dam.\n\nJackie Robinson - First African-American player in Major League Baseball. Robinson was brought to the Brooklyn Dodgers (now L.A. Dodgers) by then owner Branch Rickey, and played his first Major League game in 1947. Robinson was already an established Negro League player by the time Rickey acquired him for the Dodgers organization. Robinson faced tremendous pressure his first year in the Major Leagues, as many players and fans were adamantly opposed to the nation's past time being integrated. Robinson excelled however, and went on to have a Hall of Fame career with the Dodgers, as he was one of the greatest second basemen of all time. His jersey number, 42, is retired by all teams in Major League baseball to commemorate his significant contributions to the game.\n\nLouis Brandeis (1856-1941) - Brandeis was born of Jewish immigrant parents from Bohemia, and grew up in Kentucky. He was the first Jewish Justice of the United States Supreme Court having been appointed by President Woodrow Wilson in 1916. He served as a justice on the Court until he retired in 1939.

He also authored the well read collection of essays, Other People's Money and how the Bankers Use it in 1914. Brandeis faced strong anti-Semitic bigotry, including from his fellow justices. In the year 2013, the US Supreme Court has two Jewish Justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan.\n\nMount Rushmore- Built between 1927 and 1939 near Keystone, South Dakota by Gutzon and Lincoln Borglum as a monument to American history. The Gutzons carved who they believed to be the greatest Presidents in American history up to that point - George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. The monument was originally to contain full busts of all four Presidents depicted, but Borgulm only finished the heads and part of Washington's lower bust before abandoning the project due to Gutzon's death in 1941 and a lack of funds. The monument has been managed by the National Park Service since 1933.\n\nStatue of Liberty - Designed by Frederic Auguste Bartholdi, and dedicated in 1886, the Statue was a gift to the United States from the people of France. It was given to mark the two nations' shared devotion to liberty and stands 305 feet tall in New York Harbor. The statue was cast, dismantled, shipped in pieces to New York, then reassembled and finally dedicated amidst a ticker-tape parade by President Grover Cleveland in 1886. A replica of the statue stands in Paris, facing New York City. It was erected in 1889 by Americans living in Paris as a one hundred anniversary commemoration of the French Revolution. Often called Lady Liberty, the Statue has welcomed generations of immigrants to the United States.\n\nStatue of Freedom- Designed by Thomas Crawford and placed upon the newly completed US Capitol Dome in 1863 as part of renovations to the building during the Civil War. The Statue evokes the images of liberty and freedom she is meant to symbolize.\n\nTelegram from Orville Wright to Bishop Wright- The Wright brothers were among the first to successfully build and fly a motorized, controllable, fixed-wing airplane. Their first flights were in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. This telegraph was sent by Orville Wright to Bishop Wright explaining the duration of one of these first flights. The Wrights conducted several experimental flights between 1903 and 1905, and their experimentations formed the basis for the development of many fixed-wing airplanes.\n\nWright Flyer, Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, 1903- The Wright brothers were among the first to successfully build and fly a motorized, controllable, fixed-wing airplane. Their first flights on their Wright Flyer aircraft were in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, and were captured on rare photographs such as this. The Wrights conducted several experimental flights between 1903 and 1905, and their experimentations formed the basis for the development of many fixed-wing airplanes.\n\nAmerican Toad (Bufo americanus) - The American Toad is found around much of eastern North America including Michigan. The toad begins life as an egg, and hatches into a tadpole. Tadpoles live in freshwater where they reach maturity in a month and a half to two months. The American Toad is primarily a terrestrial dweller and eats a variety of ground insects, worms, and grubs. Toads live in dark cover and hibernate in the winter.\n\nRed Eye Tree Frog (Agalychnis callidryas) - Native to the tropical rainforests in Central America. The Red Eye Tree Frog is an arboreal dweller, and hunts at night. Its diet consists primarily of insects. They have three eyelids and very sticky feet, enabling them to move with agility through the forest. The Red Eye Tree Frog is not poisonous; its main defense mechanism is excellent camouflage, hiding itself well amongst tree branches and leaves during the day. They use vibrations and sounds to communicate and for mating calls.\n\nGolden Toad (Bufo periglenes) - Was a species that lived in high altitude rain forests in Costa Rica. Because this toad lived in a small area near the city of Monteverde, Costa Rica, it was often times called the Monteverde Golden Toad. It is believed extinct, as it has not been seen since 1989. The Golden Toad was a small species, measuring around 2 inches in length. They spent most of their time underground and as such were rarely seen. The exact cause of this species believed extinction is unknown, although scientists believe it may have been from a fungal infection or habitat destruction.\n\nPoison Dart Frog (Dendrobates azureus) - This species lives in the rain forests of Suriname and Brazil. Its name comes from the secretions of alkaloid poisons that serve as its defense against predators. The frog’s blue color is also a defense mechanism, warning off would be predators. Female dart frogs are larger than males, although males have larger feet. Both sexes possess suction cup toes allowing them to dwell upside down on tree branches. A primarily terrestrial dweller, its diet consists mostly of insects.\n\nHoney Bee (Apis mellifera) - The honey bee gets its name from the honey it makes by digesting nectar. The honey bee is native to Europe, Africa, and Asia. However, beginning in the 16th century, Europeans introduced them to the Americas, and they have become an important part of the fauna of the Americas since. Honey bees live in colonies contained in hives containing up to 80,000 bees. Only female bees are workers bees, have stingers, and can create honey or pollinate crops. Male bees are essentially flying gametes, their only purpose being to fertilize queen bees, and they die immediately after inseminating the queen. Bees are essential in the pollination of many crops and are therefore extremely valuable to the food supply.\n\nAmerican Robin (Turdus migratorius) - A migratory bird, the American Robin is found throughout North America. They breed in Canada and the northern United States and live year round in the central and southern United States. The Robin is one of the most common birds in North America and is the state bird of Michigan. In places where they do not live year round such as Michigan, their return in the early Spring is a sign to many of the end of winter.\n\nAmerican Woodcock (Scolopax minor) - The American Woodcock is an upland bird found in the eastern half of North America and is the only woodcock species native to this area. They thrive in young forests and consist primarily on a diet of earthworms. Woodcocks migrate at night, flying at low altitudes and spend winters as far south as the Gulf Coast states.\n\nBald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) - Found throughout all of North America, the Bald Eagle is an opportunistic carnivore that exists on a variety of prey. Eagles form lifelong mating partners and establish a hunting territory around a source of food that can extend for miles. With a wingspan of 72-92 inches and weighing on average 9-12 pounds, they are considered the largest raptor in North America. Once threatened with extirpation in the Continental United States, protection efforts have succeeded in restoring the eagle to prominence. The eagle is one of the national symbols of the United States and is the nation's national bird.\n\nBluebird (Sialia sialis) - The state bird of New York, the bluebird is found throughout the eastern United States and Mexico. The bluebird is a social bird, often times gathering in large flocks. Its diet consists of invertebrates, insects, and wild berries. Because of the bluebird's voracious appetite for insects, they are a welcome sight for many gardeners.\n\nBrook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) - A species in the salmon family (order Salmoniformes), it is native to eastern North America. The Brook Trout is the state fish of Michigan and lives primarily in cold water streams, and lakes. Brook trout populations are sensitive to changes in water temperature, clarity, and acidity. For this reason conservation efforts are underway to preserve or restore native habitat. Brook trout have a varied diet of crustaceans, insects, frogs, and mollusks.\n\nCommon Loon (Gavia immer) - Loons are found in northern Europe, North America, and in northern Africa. They are a diving species, surviving off fish in both fresh and salt water. During migration, they fly at speeds of 75 mph. The loon is known for its unique sounds, which vary from wails to tremolos to yodels.\n\nGolden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) - Found in Eurasia, North America, and Africa, the Golden Eagle is a large predatory bird. Like all eagles they are an opportunistic predator. They maintain homes in large territory ranges of up to 77 square miles. The Golden Eagle has a wingspan of 71-92 inches and weighs 5.5-7.2 pounds. Like its cousin the Bald Eagle, females are larger than males. They are the national bird of Mexico.\n\nKirtland's Warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii) - The Kirtland's Warbler breeds only in the northeastern Lower Peninsula of Michigan and winters in the Bahamas. Their survival depends on the abundance of young Jack Pine forests in which they build their nests. Conservation efforts are therefore focused on replanting Jack Pine forests where logging has taken place, or preserving the natural re-growth after a wild fire. Portions of Kalkaska, Crawford, and Oscoda County, Michigan are designated Kirtland's Warbler habitat preservation areas. Their biggest threat to survival is in the Brown-headed Cowbird, a species which will lay its eggs in the Warbler's nest.\n\nPeacock (Pavo cristatus) - The peacock is known for the iridescent bright plume of feathers the male displays as a mating attraction. Peacocks are members of the pheasant family and are native to the Indian subcontinent. They are found in many parts of the world now as they are popular in botanical gardens, zoos, and other captive settings. Male Peacock feathers are also popular for decorative purposes.\n\nRuffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus) - Ruffed Grouse are a non-migratory bird that have an omnivorous diet. They are easily identifiable in the woods by the car engine-like sound the male emits as a mating call. The Ruffed Grouse is oftentimes mistaken for and erroneously called a partridge, even though the two are different species. It is the state bird of Pennsylvania and lives throughout eastern and northern North America.\n\nTurkey Vulture (Cathartes aura) - The most widespread of New World vultures, this species lives from southern Canada to the southernmost point of South America. Sometimes called a buzzard, like most vultures, they are scavengers that feed almost entirely on carrion. Turkey Vultures were at one time a somewhat rare species in Michigan and elsewhere in the eastern United States. However, conservation efforts have brought numbers of this species to levels which make them a common site in this area.\n\nWalter Reuther, 1907-1970 - President of the United Autoworkers Union from 1946- 1970. Reuther was one of the founding organizers of the United Auto Workers union (UAW) and was also a prominent leader in the civil rights movement. Reuther was born in Wheeling, West Virginia, and moved with his brother to Michigan in the 1920s to find work in the automobile industry. Reuther became a tool and die maker, and, after living in the Soviet Union with his brother, returned to Michigan and became one of the chief organizers of the then newly formed UAW. After being elected president of the UAW, Reuther moved the union into the political mainstream, purging it of its more radical members. Reuther also fused the agenda of the UAW with that of the Civil Rights movement, becoming a major figure behind the 1963 March on Washington. Reuther remained committed to the rights of minorities and workers till his untimely death in a plane crash near Pellston, Michigan in 1970.\n\nPresident Harry S. Truman and UAW President Walter Reuther - President Harry S. Truman and UAW President Walter Reuther meeting in the Oval Office in 1952. Truman won the 1948 Presidential election despite being down in the polls to his Republican challenger Thomas Dewey most of the race. Part of Truman's electoral success was due to the support of union voters such as members of the UAW.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson, 1803-1882 - Emerson was an author, philosopher, and one of the founders if the transcendentalism movement. Emerson's transcendental ideas of communion with nature and the search for the divine in the natural world are evident in his poetry and fiction. Emerson was a beloved teacher and a popular lecturer and is one of the most influential thinkers and contributors to American intellectualism.\n\nBen Franklin, 1706-1790 - A key figure in the American Enlightenment, Ben Franklin was one of the most influential of America's founding fathers. He was born in Boston and apprenticed as a printer to his brother. Franklin continued with the printing trade as a young man, but also conducted many scientific experiments leading to the invention of the lightning rod, publication of a farmer's almanac, and the creating of a more efficient stove. Franklin is best known for his political ideas which had a major influence on the American Revolution.\n\nCornel West (1953 - ) - An American philosopher, intellectual and academic. West was the first African-American to earn a PhD in philosophy from Princeton University. West's work focuses on ideas of race, gender, and the societal roles affixed to these social constructs. In 2011 he became a Professor of Philosophy and Christian Practice at Union Theological Seminary in New York City. West is one of America's best known intellectuals, appearing frequently as a guest on television programs, and in Internet and magazine interviews.\n\nMichel Foucault, 1926-1984 - Michel Foucault was a French philosopher and historian. He was one of the pioneers of post-modernism. Foucault's ideas on gender, human sexuality, insanity, and incarceration remain widely studied and debated. His work and ideas focused on societal creations of definitions of gender, sanity, crime and punishment, and how these social constructs were used to shape society and render and distribute power. Foucault is considered to be one of the most important thinkers of the 20th century.\n\nJohn Locke (1632-1704), Painting by Herman Verelst - Locke was an important part of the Enlightenment in Europe, and his ideas had a profound influence on the founding fathers of the United States. Locke grew up in Somerset County, England, and earned degrees in philosophy and medicine from Oxford University. Locke developed many of his ideas on political theory and the human condition during the English Civil War. Of these, his most important and influential were of religious toleration, that all humans are born in a state of nature, and that liberty is the natural state of humans, a state granted to them by their creation and not by government. Locke theorized that given the opportunity, people would organize a government that recognized and protected the inherent rights of people, of these life, liberty, and property. His ideas went on to influence the U.S. Declaration of Independence, and French Revolution thinkers such as Rousseau.\n\nSimone de Beauvoir, 1908-1986 - de Beauvoir was an influential author of essays and fiction, existentialist and progenitor of modern feminism. Among De Beauvoir's most influential novels were She Came to Stay (1943) and The Mandarins (1954). Both of these books feature characters that call to question morality, sexuality, and gender. Her 1949 work The Second Sex is perhaps her most well known. The Second Sex explores the history of patriarchal oppression of women, focusing on the role played by socially constructed norms of gender. De Beauvoir and the French author and philosopher Jean Paul Sartre were lifelong friends and likely influenced each other's work. Her work remains foundational in its influence on feminism, existentialism, and post-modernism.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826), Painting by Rembrandt Peale - Architect, inventor, scientist, and one of the founders of the University of Virginia. Jefferson was one of the most important of America's founding generation and is the author of the Declaration of Independence. He was born in Virginia and educated at the College of William and Mary. Jefferson, like many of the founding fathers, was a wealthy slave owner and used his plantation for agricultural experimentation. He was one of the key American Enlightenment intellectuals. He was the first US Ambassador to France, helped create the US Navy and served as the nation's third President. He died on July 4, 1826 within hours of his contemporary, John Adams.\n\nIssac Newton (1642-1727), Painting by Sir Godfrey Kneller - Newton was a professor at Cambridge University in England and is one of the most influential physicists and mathematicians of all time. Newton developed ideas of gravity and matter as well as mathematical theories and formulas that helped lay the framework for the modern study of these fields.

This image shows both the eye and proboscis of a butterfly magnified several hundreds of times with an electron microscope.\n\nBee Pollen Basket on Rear Leg (Apis Mellifera) - Honey bees take their name from the honey they produce in the hives in which they live. Bees make honey through the digestion process of nectar eaten from flowers. Bees gather pollen on their legs and spread it around from plant-to-plant as they fly around looking for nectar. This pollination performed by bees is essential to many crops that are grown for food and fuel.\n\nCrab Spider (Misumena vatia) - Crab spiders are a wide ranging species that live in most of the northern hemisphere. They are typically either yellow or white, depending on the color of the flower they are hunting on. This makes them very effective predators. Female crab spiders are typically twice the size of males and ideally consume a substantial diet to produce the best eggs for reproduction. This is a close up image of the eye and mouth structure of a crab spider. It has been magnified several hundreds of times with an electron microscope.\n\nGerminating Pollen (Sauromatum guttatum) - Pollen is a powder containing the microgametophytes of seed plants. These microgametophytes produce sperm cells, making pollen essential to plant reproduction. When pollen lands on a compatible female cone it germinates, facilitating the transfer of sperm to the ovule or female gametophyte. Pollen is spread from plant-to-plant by insects including bees. This is an electron microscope produced image of pollen germinating after landing on a female cone. The study of pollen is used in a variety of sciences including paleontology, anthropology, and forensics.\n\nE. Coli - rod prokaryote (bacterium) - This is a microscopic image of E. Coli (short for Escherichia coli), a common bacteria found in the gut of most animals including humans. There are a wide variety of strains of E. Coli bacteria.

Coli in the human gut are essential to the production of vitamin K2 and ward off otherwise harmful intestinal bacteria.\n\nHummingbird feather shaft, barbs, and barbules - The hummingbird is one of the smallest bird species, averaging just 2-5 inches in length and weighing about that of a penny. Their name comes from the sound made from their wings, which they can beat at a remarkable rate of 12-80 times per second. The hummingbird diet includes nectar, spiders and insects. This is a close up image of the intricate structure of the feather of a hummingbird showing the interlocking barbs and barbules. Many hummingbirds get their colors from the reflection of light off the cells of their feathers rather than the color of their plumage.\n\nMild fruiting structure (Aspergillus versicolor) - Aspergillus is a genus of dozens of mold species found throughout the world. The name comes from the resemblance of the species to an aspergillum (holy water sprinkler) when viewed from under a microscope. This electron microscope image shows the triangular flowering pattern the mold gets its name from. Molds of the Aspergillus genus are studied extensively and can cause a variety of infections in animals and humans. Aspergillus versicolor is a mold that is commonly found in soils, on food, and in buildings.\n\nHerpes Simplex Virus (HSV-2, DNA virus) - This is an electron microscopic image of the Herpes Simplex 2 (HSV-2) virus. Herpes is a virus that can cause a variety of diseases in humans including cold sores and genital infection. Transmission is through contact with an infected area of the skin. Herpes cycles between active and latent stages and is most commonly spread during an active stage. Like most viruses, once acquired, Herpes cannot be eradicated from the body and is treated with antiviral drugs.\n\nFemale Asian Tiger Mosquito (Aedes albopictus) - The Tiger Mosquito is native to southeast Asia however has spread to many parts of the world, including the eastern United States. They are named for the black and white stripes appearing on their abdomen. Tiger Mosquitoes carry and spread diseases such as the West Nile Virus, dengue fever, and Yellow Fever. They have spread throughout the world on cargo ships and are a very adaptable species, even having the ability to hibernate in the winter and survive snow and sub-freezing conditions. This image shows the antennae and proboscis of a female Asian tiger mosquito.\n\nMosquito Compound Eye (Aedes albopictus) - This is a microscopic close-up image of the compound eye structure of an Asian Tiger Mosquito. A compound eye consists of thousands of individual photoreceptor units located on a convex surface, all pointing in a slightly different direction. Compound eyes give mosquitoes and other insects a very wide viewing angle, and the ability to detect rapid and microscopic movement along with the polarization of light. Compound eyes also make it possible to see minute detail human eyes require magnification instruments for.\n\nTable Salt Crystal (NaCl) - Sodium Chloride is the chemical name for table salt. It is an ionic compound consisting of equal parts sodium and chlorine. Salt is an essential nutrient in humans who must acquire it through their diet. Sodium Chloride is also responsible for the salinity of the ocean, and is widely occurring in nature. Common table salt is used to flavor food and is also used in a variety of chemical applications, as a water softener and road de-icer.

Calcium carbonate is also the main component of shells of marine organisms such as snails and pearls, and of bird eggshells. This is an electron microscopic image of calcium carbonate crystals.\n\nTestosterone Crystals - Electron microscopy image of testosterone crystals. Testosterone is a steroid hormone secreted in the testes of males and ovaries of females. Testosterone is the main sex hormone of men who produce 20 times more of it than women. It is responsible for the secondary sex characteristics of males and is important in the prevention of osteoporosis in both males and females. Most vertebrates produce testosterone, and numerous studies have been conducted to measure its production and effect. Studies indicates that men with elevated levels of testosterone are more selfish and aggressive in decision making and are more prone to violent or criminal behavior.\n\nEpinephrine (adrenalin) and Sucrose Crystals - Electron microscopy image. Epinephrine (adrenalin) is a hormone and neurotransmitter that plays an important role in the regulation of the heart rate, blood vessel and air passage diameters, and metabolic shifts in the human body. Epinephrine is also an important component of the sympathetic nervous system. Epinephrine is used to treat a variety of medical conditions including internal bleeding, anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest, bronchospasm and high blood sugar levels.\n\nPyrogallic Acid Crystals - Electron microscopic image. Pyrogallol (benzene-1,2,3-triol) is a benzenetriol. It was a commonly used chemical in hair dyeing, and photo developing. However, due to its toxicity it is no longer in common use, except with some black and white developers. Exposure to pyrogallic acid can be toxic, thus limiting its current usage in industry.\n\nProgesterone Crystals - Discovered by Willard Myron Allen and George Washington Corner in 1933, Allen gave the hormone its name derived from Progestational Steroidal ketone. It is a steroid hormone involved in menstruation, pregnancy and the development of human embryos. It is the major naturally occurring progestogen in humans. Progesterone is produced in the adrenal glands and ovaries as well as the placenta during pregnancy and is stored in fat tissue. The steroid has been detected in walnut trees and a progesterone like steroid has been detected in the Mexican yam plant. This is an electronic microscopic image of progesterone crystals.\n\nCaffeine Crystals - Caffeine is a naturally occurring stimulant drug. In its natural form it is a white, bitter, alkaloid. It is found in a wide variety of plants in seeds, leaves, and fruit, where it acts as a pesticide and a memory enhancer of some pollinators. Caffeine is derived from coffee, tea, and the kola nut and is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug. 90% of adults in North America consume caffeine daily and it is classified by the Food and Drug Administration as a GRAS (generally recognized as safe) drug.\n\nPenicillin (antibiotic) Crystals - A group of antibiotics derived from Penicillium fungi, Penicillin antibiotics were the first drugs effective against many bacterial infections and diseases such as syphilis. Like many antibiotics, penicillins work by blocking the division of bacteria. Penicillin is produced from mold when the growth of the fungus is inhibited by stress. Alexander Fleming, a Scottish scientist, is credited with discovering penicillin in 1928, even though scientists dating back to 1875 had observed the anti-microbial properties of penicillin mold. Although Fleming's discovery is considered the beginning of the modern era of antibiotic experimentation, Howard Walter Florey, Ernst Chain, and Norman Heatly were the first to apply penicillin for medical treatment.\n\nMethamphetamine (Ice) Crystals - Methamphetamine (also called Meth, Crystal Meth, or Ice) is a psychoactive stimulant drug. Methamphetamine is a schedule II controlled substance in the United States and on the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances treaty. The meth crystals here are in the form of hydrochloride salt. In low doses, methamphetamine increases alertness and reduces fatigue. In high doses it can produce euphoria by releasing a high level of dopamine in the brain. Methamphetamine is highly addictive and can cause considerable psychological and physical harm including overdose.\n\nSaturn's Rings - Saturn is the second largest planet in the Solar System, the sixth from the Sun, and, along with Jupiter, Neptune, and Uranus, one of the gas giants. Saturn is not entirely made up of gas however. It is believed the planet has a core made of iron and nickel surrounded by a layer of metallic hydrogen, liquid hydrogen and liquid helium. Saturn's yellowish color comes from ammonia crystals prominent in its upper atmosphere. Saturn is identifiable by the eleven rings surrounding the planet, nine of which are continuous. The rings are made up of particles, some very large including ice and rocks, trapped in the planet's gravitational pull.\n\nLunar Crater - Earth's only satellite, the moon, is believed to have formed from a massive collision of Earth with an object the size of planet Mars. The debris created from this event eventually coalesced due to gravity and formed into orbit around the Earth. Unlike Earth, the moon has only a very thin atmosphere and very little surface gravity. This makes it prone to bombardment with asteroids. The moon is also the only planetary body other than Earth to be visited by humans as part of the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s. Many of the moon's craters are large enough to be seen from Earth without the aid of a telescope.\n\nCoronal Mass Ejection, September 14, 1999 - The Sun is a medium-sized star and is the center of the solar system, as all planets orbit around it. Like all stars, the sun is a massive body of energy resulting in nuclear fusion reactions. Space telescopes have captured many photographs of the sun, including this one, which shows the ejection of coronal plasma during a sun spot event. Coronal mass ejections can result in elevated levels of solar radiation reaching the earth. While these radiation events are harmless to humans, they can result in temperature changes on Earth and disruption of low-Earth orbit satellite function.\n\nGravity of the Moon's Dust - The moon is the only natural satellite of Earth. It is believed to have formed as a result of a collision between Earth and a Mars-sized planetary body around 4.5 billion years ago. The inner core is made of solid iron with the outer made of liquid iron. The moon's crust is on average 25km thick and is made primarily of anorthosite, an igneous rock which is also found throughout Earth. The moon's gravitational field has been measured by instruments aboard space probes orbiting the satellite. The gravity of the moon impacts Earth by causing the tides in the ocean.\n\nJupiter - Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun in the solar system. It is the largest planet in diameter and has the mass of 2.5 times that of all other planets in the solar system combined. Like Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus, Jupiter is considered a gas giant; its atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, although like the other gas giant planets it likely has a solid core. Jupiter is known to have at least 67 moons, the largest of which, Ganymede, has a diameter greater than Mercury. Space probes have been sent to fly by Jupiter and have taken many photographs of the planet. The Great Red Spot is a large hurricane-like storm in the planet's atmosphere that has been observed for over 200 years.\n\nGalileo Galilei - Galileo (1564-1642) was an Italian astronomer and physicist known for his major contributions to the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries. Galileo contributed to a better understanding of astronomy by confirming many of the ideas of Copernicus, including the rotation of the planets around the Sun. Galileo's astronomical contributions also include the observation of the phases of Venus, sunspots, and the discovery of four of Jupiter's moons, Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, thus named the Galilean moons. He is considered the father of modern astronomy.\n\nFrederick Douglass - Frederick Douglass was born a slave in 1818 in Talbot County, Maryland. Douglass escaped Maryland, and slavery, later settling in New Bedford, Massachusetts with his wife, Anna-Murray Douglass. He would become a leading abolitionist, and traveled through Ireland and Britain gaining support for the cause, and eventually, his legal freedom. After the Civil War, Douglass continued to be active in the movement for black equality and became a leading advocate for women's suffrage. He was well known throughout his life for his profound oratory, captivating audiences with his diction. Douglass is also remembered by his own life story, written down in his Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave. Later in life he was also a major supporter of worker's rights and fought for American labor unions to end their policies of segregation. Douglass died in 1895 at the age of 77.\n\nGeorge Washington Carver - Carver was born into slavery in Mississippi around 1864. He was a scientist, inventor and educator. Carver's experimentations with the peanut, cotton, sweet potatoes, and soybeans made lasting contributions to the improved cultivations of these crops. He attended college in Indianola, Iowa, and later became both the first black student and faculty member at the Iowa State Agricultural College in Ames, Iowa. Carver is well known for a long career as an educator at Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama. He was invited there by Booker T. Washington and went on to head the Agricultural Department. Carver stayed at Tuskegee for 47 years. While there he developed a mobile classroom and conducted many of his major agricultural experiments. He died at the age of 78 in 1943.\n\nErasmus - Erasmus (1466-1526) was a Dutch Catholic Priest and theologian. Erasmus lived during the European Renaissance and the beginning of the Protestant Reformation. A theologian who emphasized free will as opposed to the Protestant doctrine of predestination, Erasmus remained a Catholic priest despite recognizing the legitimacy of some criticisms of the Catholic Church. He believed in reforming the Church from within, and thus distanced himself from early Protestant theologians such as Martin Luther. This painting is from Hans Holbein the Younger, a German painter of the Northern Renaissance tradition recognized as one of the greatest portrait artists of the 16th century.\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson and Martin Luther King, Jr. - Lyndon Baines Johnson was the 36th President of the United States. Johnson became President after John F. Kennedy's assassination in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963. In the remainder of Kennedy's term Johnson served out, he tried to complete some of his predecessor's initiatives, and signed into law the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. Here Johnson is meeting with Martin Luther King Jr. King was the leader of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), an important civil rights organization in the 1960s. King and other civil rights leaders pushed the President to sign the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as well as the Voting Rights Act of 1965, two important parts of Johnson's legacy. Facing growing opposition to the Vietnam War, Johnson did not seek reelection in 1968, retiring from politics and public office. Johnson died in 1973 at the age of 64. King was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee on April 4, 1968 at the age of 39.\n\nPotato Starch Grains - Potatoes are an edible tuber, and are the fourth largest crop in the world. Now an important part of the diet of many cultures, they are one of the oldest domesticated plants, having been first cultivated in Peru and Bolivia 7,000 to 10,000 years ago. The potato was introduced to Europe and North America 400 years ago after the Spanish colonization of South America. There are now over 1,000 varieties of potatoes, but nearly all of these trace their origin to a single type grown in Peru during the early-domestication period. This is a close up image of starch grains from the potato plant.\n\nBroccoli differentiating apical meristem - Broccoli is a plant native to the Italian Peninsula believed to have been first cultivated by the Romans. It is a member of the cabbage family and its Italian name refers to the cabbage like appearance of the crown of the plant. Broccoli was first introduced in the United States by Italian immigrants in the early part of the twentieth century and now forms an important part of many American dishes. The plant is high in Vitamin C and dietary fiber. This is a close up image of broccoli differentiating apical meristem, a process of embryogenesis of the plant.\n\nRemnants of Ancient Streambed on Mars - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. It is smaller than the Earth and it is speculated that the planet may have once contained conditions hospitable to life, although as of yet, no evidence of life, past or present, has been discovered. Multiple unmanned probes have been sent to Mars, including the recent National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) rover, Curiosity. Curiosity is equipped with scientific equipment to study the Martian soil. This is an image taken from Curiosity that shows what scientists believe to be an ancient streambed. Images such as this provide evidence that liquid water existed on Mars in the past. It is believed the planet's polar caps contain vast quantities of frozen water.\n\nMars Mount Sharp Panorama in Raw Colors - The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched the Mars Curiosity Rover on November 26, 2011. The unmanned spacecraft the size of an automobile was sent to the planet to explore in and around the Gale Crater. After a 563,000,000km journey, Curiosity arrived at its destination location on the planet August 6, 2012. Since being on Mars, the rover has taken samples of Martian soil and pictures of the geography. This is a picture taken by Curiosity of Mount Sharp, a feature of the Martian surface nearby Curiosity. NASA scientists leave some of the photos from curiosity in the raw colors they were taken in, while others are adjusted to look like they would appear in natural light on Earth. Like Earth, Mars has an atmosphere. However, unlike Earth, the Martian atmosphere consists of mostly of Carbon Dioxide.\n\nBuckyballs Floating in Interstellar Space - A bucky-ball is the more commonly used name for a spherical Buckminsterfullerene molecule. A fullerene molecule has a structure similar in appearance to a soccer ball and consists of 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons with a carbon atom at each vertex of each polygon and a bond along each polygon edge. Harold Kroto, James R. Heath, Sean O’Brien, Robert Curl, and Richard Smalley were the first scientist to generate a bucky-ball, and Curk, Kroto, and Smalley shared a 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their discovery. Their work has led to the study of fullerenes. This image shows the relation of Buckminsterfullerene molecules with other objects and also exhibits the use of computers to help display scientific principles.\n\nMars Panoramic View from Rocknest - The Mars Curiosity Rover is the latest unmanned space exploration vehicle sent by NASA to explore Mars. Curiosity arrived on the planet in August 2013 and has since sent back to Earth many color images of its surrounding environment. The surface of Mars is very dry and very cold. Mars has a thin atmosphere, making the surface vulnerable to solar radiation. The planet is also very windy, with massive dust storms shaping the surface. It is possible liquid water once existed on the planet; however, due to the low atmospheric pressure, it is unlikely surface water currently exists for any length of time. Rocknest is the name of the location of the Curiosity Rover when it took the images to create this photo. NASA uses images sent to Earth from the rover to study the surface of the planet.\n\nMars - Mount Sharp - Curiosity is unmanned spacecraft the size of an automobile that was sent to Mars to explore in and around the Gale Crater. After a 563,000,000km journey, Curiosity arrived at its destination location on August 6, 2012. Curiosity has sent back to Earth many pictures of the landscape surrounding the vehicle. This is a picture taken by Curiosity of Mount Sharp, a feature of the Martian surface nearby the rover. NASA scientists study the photographs sent from Mars in order to determine features of the planet and to consider where to direct Curiosity. The colors on this photograph have been adjusted to show how the landscape would appear in natural Earth light.\n\nCosmic Gas Cloud - A star is created out of the existence of huge gas and dust clouds in the cosmos, called nebulae. In the denser regions of these clouds gravitational collapse occurs; particles randomly bouncing around collide and begin to stick together, forming a giant ball known as a protostar. This increases the temperature and pressure, causing the ball to rotate faster, and nuclear reactions to occur, balanced out by the inward pull of the gravity, preventing the protostar from simply exploding. This protostar increases its spinning, and as more matter becomes absorbed into it, its centrifugal force creates a central sphere and a surrounding disk of matter. This sphere eventually becomes a star.\n\nPresident Gerald Ford - Gerald R Ford is the only President of the United States to have come from Michigan. Ford grew up in Grand Rapids and went to school at the University of Michigan. He was a decorated veteran of the Second World War and entered Congress representing the west side of the Lower Peninsula for many years. Ford rose to prominent leadership positions within the Republican Party, eventually becoming the House Minority Leader in 1965. When Vice President Spiro Agnew was forced to resign, President Nixon nominated Ford as his new Vice President. Nixon himself resigned amidst the Watergate scandal in 1974, and Ford became President. Known for his honesty and down-to-earth demeanor, Ford restored confidence in the White House. He died in 2006 at the age of 93, having lived the longest of any U.S. President, and is buried at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum in Grand Rapids.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy Addressing the American University in Washington, DC - John Fitzgerald Kennedy is pictured here giving a speech at the American University in Washington. Kennedy was one of Joseph Kennedy's nine children, most of who rose to prominence in their own right. John attended Harvard and enlisted in the Navy during World War Two after receiving a medical disqualification from the Army. After a distinguished record of service in the war, Kennedy entered politics. He was elected to the Senator from Massachusetts in 1952, and in 1960 won a very close Presidential election against the incumbent Vice President, Richard Nixon. In doing so, Kennedy became the first, and to this date, the only Roman Catholic to hold the office of the Presidency. Kennedy served less than one term in office, as he was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald on November 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas. Kennedy is laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nMichigan Governor G. Mennen Williams with Massachusetts Senator John F. Kennedy - G. Mennen \"Soapy\" Williams served 12 two year terms as the 41st Governor of Michigan from 1949-1961. His grandfather founded the Mennen soap and personal care products company, hence G. Mennen's nickname of \"Soapy.\" William's best known legacy to the state of Michigan is the Mackinac Bridge, constructed during his tenure in office. Here Governor Williams and then Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts, both prominent Democrats, are pictured at the ceremonial opening of the Mackinac Bridge in 1958. Williams left office three weeks before Kennedy became President, and would go on to serve as Kennedy's Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs. His career in public office ended as the Chief Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court. Williams died in 1988 at the age of 78 and is buried in the Protestant Cemetery on Mackinac Island.\n\nGovernor George Romney and Pennsylvania Governor William Scranton - George Romney served as Governor of Michigan from 1963 to 1969. William Scranton served as Governor of Pennsylvania from 1963-1967. Romney was already well known in Michigan before becoming Governor, as he was the CEO of American Motors Corporation, and a participant in the state constitutional convention held between 1961 and 1962. Elected in 1962, he became the first Republican to win the office since Kim Sigler in 1946. Romney would go onto win reelection in 1964 and 1966. He ran for President in the 1968 election, but did not make it far in the primary process. Ultimately, Richard Nixon won that election and Romney left the Governor's office to become President Nixon's Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. George Romney's son, Mitt, ran unsuccessfully as the Republican candidate for President in the 2012 election.\n\nAjax Cleanser - Ajax cleanser was developed and introduced in the United States as a commercial cleaning product by the Colgate-Palmolive company in 1947. This is an electron microscopic image of the cleanser, showing its main chemical makeup of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, sodium carbonate, and quartz. The main chemical compound in Ajax, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, is an odorless salt and is one of the most commonly used chemical compounds in commercial cleansing agents including laundry detergent.\n\nLyndon B. Johnson Signing the Civil Rights Act, 1964 - Lyndon Baines Johnson became President of the United States on November 22, 1963 upon the assassination of John F. Kennedy. During his first year in office, Johnson saw through Congress one of Kennedy's key initiatives, a civil rights act. The law was instrumental in ending segregation, as it outlawed discrimination in housing, employment, public accommodations, and education facilities. Here Johnson is pictured with several key sponsors and supporters of the bill, including Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who is standing directly behind the President. Johnson would go onto win the election of the 1964, defeating his Republican challenger Barry Goldwater.\n\nBooker T. Washington- Booker T. Washington was born into slavery in Virginia in 1856. After the Civil War, his family moved to West Virginia where he attended the Hampton Normal Agricultural School and the Wayland Seminary. Washington advocated tirelessly for the civil rights of freed slaves in the increasingly segregationist South of the late-nineteenth century. In 1891 he became the head of the newly established Tuskegee Institute. He remained associated with that school the remainder of his life. While Washington was criticized by many of his contemporaries for working within the segregated South, he secretly funded legal challenges to discriminatory laws and practices. He died in 1915 at the age of 59.\n\nCesar Chavez - Agricultural workers are among the hardest working and least paid laborers in the United States. They are also disproportionately immigrants, especially from Mexico and Central America. Chavez fought for higher wages and better working conditions for immigrant farm workers. He helped form the United Farm Workers Union with Delores Huerta in the 1970s. The UFW was initially an organization of California immigrant workers; it eventually spread to other parts of the United States. Although union membership dwindled, Chavez remained an important advocate for immigrant and Latino/Latina rights.

In the nineteenth century, the river was a major focus of logging activity. It is now a stream popular with anglers as it flows mostly through forested land in the northwest Lower Peninsula of Michigan. Earnest Hemingway frequented the area when he was a child and young man. Hemingway camped along the Boardman River and fished for trout out of the stream. The river's natural flow and habitat are currently being improved by the removal of hydroelectric dams constructed on the river in the early-twentieth century and no longer in use. These photographs were taken near where Hemingway used to camp along the river.\n\nErnest Hemingway - Hemingway is one of the most important American authors of the twentieth century. He was born in Oak Park, Illinois in 1899, and spent the summers as a child in northern Michigan. His family owned a cottage on Walloon Lake, near Petoskey, where Hemmingway stayed as a boy.

Staph., as it is commonly referred to, can cause pathogenic symptoms such as food poisoning, and infection in wounds; however, it is not always harmful. It is estimated 20% of humans have staph. bacteria as part of their skin flora and in areas of their respiratory tract such as nasal passages. This is a microscopic image of staph. bacteria on the human intestine. Many Americans are admitted into the hospital each year for staph. infections.\n\nSan Juan Puerto Rico Graffiti- Graffiti is a common name for street art, both solicited and illicit. The word graffiti comes from the Italian word graffiato, meaning \"scratched.\" Graffiti is as old as urbanization, with examples as far back as Roman and Greek cities surviving.

In The Treachery of Images, we see a tobacco pipe with the text, \"Ceci n'est pas une pipe\" (this is not a pipe). Magritte was very influential to many pop artists of the twentieth century including Storm Thorgerson. A museum devoted to Magritte's work in Brussels opened in 2009 and contains over 200 of his pieces.\n\nThe Niger River - Coursing through parched, landlocked Mali in western Africa, the Niger River flows north through an ancient sand sea before turning sharply east to skirt the edge of the dune-striped Sahara. At the confluence of the Bani and Niger Rivers is an island delta complete with narrows, twisting waterways, lagoons, and tiny islands. This is a United States Geological Survey satellite image of the Niger River meandering through western Africa.\n\nHuman Eye with Fungus- Close up image of the human eye. Humans have binocular, stereoscopic vision, meaning both of the eyes rotate around a vertical axis to project the image in view in the center of the retinas. This gives humans the ability to see details of depth and focus on minute detail. The human eye is also capable of distinguishing 10 million colors. Like other parts of the body, microorganisms including fungus are found on the eyes.\n\nTete d'une Femme Lisant, Picasso- Pablo Picasso was born in 1881 in Malaga, Spain. He was one of the most influential and prolific artists of the twentieth century, having created an estimated 50,000 pieces throughout his life.

Riis spent much of his life crusading against urban poverty, particularly amongst immigrants. He is one of the first journalists to use flash photography, crucial in indoor settings. Riis lived in New York and while a policeman, he took many photos of people living in squalid conditions, including tenement dwellers. Out of this experience Riis became a champion for the model tenement movement, an attempt to create better living environments for people living in these large buildings. Riis's photography of immigrants also emphasized the home as their place of work and often showed very young children employed in the family's home labor.\n\nJacob Riis, Children in Classroom- Jacob Riis (1849-1914) was a Danish born American journalist and photographer. Riis spent much of his life crusading against urban poverty, particularly amongst immigrants. This is a photograph of children in a small schoolroom. Being an immigrant himself, Riis was concerned with the poverty and limited opportunities many immigrants faced in the United States. Riis lived in New York City, home to hundreds of thousands immigrants from around the world in the early-1900s. Much of his photographs, such as the one here, reflect the hard lives immigrant adults and children alike endured in their efforts to realize the \"American Dream.\"\n\nJane Lathrop, Jane Addams, and Mary McDowell Washington, DC, 1913- In the 1910s, women's suffrage, or the right to vote, was a fiercely debated issue around the country. Some states, such as Michigan, amended their own constitutions to allow women the right to vote; however, it was still not legal at the national level. In 1913, a major suffrage meeting was held in Washington, DC to lobby the legislature to adopt a suffrage amendment to the Constitution. In this picture, three prominent suffragists, Jane Lathrop, Jane Addams, and Mary McDowell are in Washington, DC for this convention. The Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution was finally ratified in 1919, ending a decades long struggle to gain women the right to vote.\n\nLewis Hine, Girl Mill Workers- Child labor and child poverty were major issues facing the United States in the late-1800s and early-1900s. As the nation industrialized, millions of children went to work in dangerous environments out of economic necessity. Lewis Hine was a pioneering sociologist and photographer. In 1908, he became part of the National Child Labor Committee, an organization that investigated child labor throughout the United States. His major contribution to the committee was his photography of child workers, including those employed in cotton mills such as the girls in this picture. Through his photography, Hine documented hundreds of children in similar conditions and eventually worked as a chief photographer for the Works Progress Administration during the Great Depression. Eventually child labor laws were passed in the United States; however, child labor is still a major problem in developing countries.\n\nJane Addams- (September 6, 1860 - May 21, 1935) was a sociologist, philosopher, author, suffragist, and was the first American woman awarded a Nobel Prize. She was raised in a middle class family in Cedarville, Illinois. Addams attended the Rockford Women's Institute and moved to Chicago. After settling in Chicago, she became aware of the poverty immigrant families were living in. Frustrated at the lack of social services at the city level, she sought to create an enriching community wherein immigrant women and children could better their lives. In 1889 Addams founded Hull House, the first settlement house in the United States, with her lifelong friend, Elizabeth Gates Starr. Settlement houses were community centers for immigrant families, and Hull House served the south side of Chicago neighborhood it was located in.\n\nKatherine Lecke- In August, 1914, World War One broke out in Europe. Many Americans were horrified at the brutality of the conflict. Henry Ford, by then a wealthy American businessman, was a known pacifist, and sought to prevent the war from escalating further. He chartered a ship called the Oscar II, and gathered together a peace delegation to sail to Europe in order to meet with leaders of the nations involved. Many noted American pacifists were on board, including Katherine Lecke, pictured here. Lecke, like Jane Addams, was also a suffragist, and in the 1910s, the right of women to vote was a major social issue. Ford's peace delegation met with many prominent Europeans, but the war continued, and two and a half years after it broke out, the United States became involved.\n\nW.E.B. Dubois- Dubois was a sociologist, historian, civil rights activist, Pan-Africanist, author and editor, and was the first African American to graduate with a PhD from Harvard in 1895.

He helped found the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) and was a tireless advocate for racial and gender equality his whole life. Dubois died in 1963 in Ghana.\n\nW.E.B. Dubois and the 1900 Paris Exhibition - Photography was invented in the mid-1800s and by the turn of the twentieth century had become a major expressive media. Professional photographers still dominated during period, as the equipment used to take pictures was expensive, cumbersome, and required ideal lighting. Photography also entailed a development process involving a great degree of skill and the handling of dangerous chemicals. Many people sat for portraits as well as group photos to mark important occasions in their lives.\n\nW.E.B. Du Bois wanted the world to know the gains African Americans had made since the Civil War, as well as their plight as second-class citizens. In 1899 Du Bois worked with researchers and assembled photographs and other artifacts denoting the state of African Americans as the 20th century began. His award-winning \"Negro Exhibition\" debuted in Paris, France, in 1900. It featured 500 photos of African American communities and individuals, successful black businesses and schools, as well as books and pamphlets by African American authors.\n\nU.S. Army Soldier- The United States armed forces go back to the formation of the Continental Army in 1775 with the first battles of the American Revolution. Throughout American history, soldiers have been called on to defend the nation from her enemies. Memorial Day in May, and Veterans Day in November call to mind these brave men and women. The Lansing Community College Veterans Memorial is located in the Health and Human Services Building.\n\nAmerican Pokeweed - Pokeweed, also known as poke, is a member of the Phytolaccaceae family. Pokeweek plants are perennials with coarse roots that typically measure 5-10 feet with a stem that is reddish at its base. The leaves of the plant are toothless and ovaloid, flowers are greenish-white, fruits are berry-like and dark purple to black in clusters and appear in August lasting through November. Pokeweed is found in disturbed areas and waste places through most of United States. The plants have many medicinal uses, as the root poultices are used for rheumatism and bruises, root washes used for sprains and swellings, the leaves ingested as an emetic and used to treat acne. All parts of Pokeweed are toxic. Some researchers believe Pokeweed has anticancer and anti-HIV potential as the plant contains an antiviralmitogen. Juice from Pokeweed may cause dermatitis.\n\nSt. John's Wort - St. John's Wort is a species of the Clusiaceae family. It is a perennial flower with yellow pedals with black spots on edges, usually in groups of five. Stamens are also yellow and are found in bushy clusters. The plant flowers from June through October. The St. John's Wort is a very common flower found in waste areas and open fields throughout North America. The leaves contain antidepressant compounds that regulate levels of dopamine, interleukins, melatonin, monoamine-oxides, and serotonin. The flowers are used fresh in olive oil as a treatment for external ulcers, wounds, cuts, and bruises, and as a folk remedy for bladder problems, worms, dysentery, and diarrhea. St John's Wort contains compounds such as hypericin and pseudohypericin which may have anti-retroviral activity and are being researched for AIDS effectiveness.\n\nHemlock - American Hemlock is a species of the Pinaceae family. The hemlock is an evergreen tree measuring 50-90 feet in height with flat, short needles and slender stalks. The needles are green on top, and white beneath, while the tree's cones are small and drooping with rounded scales. Hemlocks are found on hills and in rocky forests; their habitat ranges from Nova Scotia to Maryland and into the Midwest. The bark, needles, and twigs of the plant are used in tea to treat colds, fevers, diarrhea, coughs, and scurvy and also have astringent properties. Tannins in the twigs and leaves are believed to be responsible for all medicinal effects. Hemlock leaves contain some vitamin C\n\nJames Meredith - James Meredith is best known for being the first African American student to enroll in the University of Mississippi. In 1954, the United States Supreme Court ruled segregation in publically funded schools unconstitutional. Meredith had served in the United States Air Force and decided to challenge the segregation at \"Ole Miss\" by enrolling. Prior to Meredith's actions, the university was strictly segregated and only accepted white students. Meredith's enrollment became a key point in the civil rights movement, as the Kennedy Administration forced the university to integrate. In this picture, Meredith is accompanied by U.S. Marshals and National Guardsmen on his way into the college facilities. Meredith attended two semesters at Ole Miss amidst constant harassment by his classmates. He would go onto earn a law degree from Columbia University and is still active in the civil rights movement.\n\nJames Meredith Telegram - As the first African American student to enroll in the University of Mississippi, Meredith faced enormous pressures, including considerable abuse from his fellow students. This is a photograph of the telegram he sent to the admissions department at the university.\n\nSleeping Bear Dunes - Sand Dunes are formed from wind pushing sand upwards into a large hill. The eastern shore of Lake Michigan is dotted with many sand dunes, as westerly winds blowing across the lake pile the sand into massive hills. The Sleeping Bear Dunes, located in the northwest Lower Peninsula of Michigan are the tallest, at 450 feet. Other notable dunes along Lake Michigan are the Arcadia, Silver Lake, Nordhouse, Saugatuck, Warren, Indiana, Whitefish, and Kohler-Andrae.\n\nSilhouette man in a Canoe - The canoe is the oldest form of vessel to troll the waterways of the Great Lakes. Centuries before Europeans set eyes on these waters, Anishinabe paddlers used the lakes and rivers for drinking water, food, and transport. Birch bark was the preferred construction material because of its relative ease to work with, flexibility and reparability. Canoeing is still popular in Michigan, with most canoes now made out of plastic, aluminum, or wood.\n\nSouth Haven Pierhead Light Tower - Lighthouses provide important navigational points for Great Lakes ships. The South Haven Pierhead Light Tower was designed by James G. Warren and was built in 1903, replacing an earlier structure built in 1872. The keeper's house was also built in 1872 and still stands. The tower and keeper's house are connected by a catwalk, one of only four still functioning in Michigan. When the current tower was erected it was located at the shore. Ten years after it was built, it was moved to the end of the 425 foot pier to make it more visible to passing ships. The keeper's house has been renovated by the Michigan Maritime Heritage Museum and houses the Marialyce Canonie Great Lakes Research Library. Both the lighthouse tower and keeper's house are on the National Register of Historic Places and are state historical sites.\n\nHiawatha National Forest - The Hiawatha National Forest is one of four national forests located in the state of Michigan. Encompassing nearly 895,000 acres, the Hiawatha is located in two sections in the eastern and central Upper Peninsula. The eastern part of the forest was designated national forest land by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1909. It is one of the only stretches of land in Michigan never homesteaded or developed. It was known as the Michigan National Forest until its designation as the Hiawatha in 1962. The western part of the forest was acquired in the 1920s and designated national forest land in 1931 and was reforested by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Other national forests in Michigan include the Ottawa in the western Upper Peninsula, the Manistee in the western Lower Peninsula, and the Huron National Forest in the eastern Lower Peninsula. Combined with Federal and State forests, Michigan has over 8 million acres of public land.\n\nPink Abstract - Pink is a pale, reddish color that takes its name from the flowering plants of the Dianthus genus. Descriptions using the color pink are found in ancient Greek and Roman literature. It was not a color seen very much in Europe until the late-Medieval and early-Renaissance periods when it began appearing in art. Pink was a common color for buildings in the United States during the 18th and 19th centuries, especially in interior color schemes. Many people associate the color with femininity and childhood. It has become a well-known brand name in the United States as well as a symbol used for breast cancer awareness.\n\nHartwick Pines - Encompassing more than 9,600 acres, Hartwick Pines is the 5th largest state part in Michigan, and the third largest in the Lower Peninsula. The park is named after Karen Hartwick, daughter of a lumber baron who owned the land. She donated it to the state of Michigan in the 1920s as a monument to the logging industry. 80 acres of the original donation contained old-growth pine, one of the few stretches left in the state at the time. 49 acres of this old growth forest remains. A logging museum exists at the state park; it was originally constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. The state park offers camping, hiking, fishing, and cross country skiing.\n\nTerraced Rice Field, Yen Bai Province, Vietnam - Rice is the staple crop in much of Asia, including Vietnam. Most of Vietnam is hilly/mountainous terrain and tropical rain forest. Under these conditions, farmers must adapt the landscape in order to grow their crops. This picture illustrates how rice is grown in this climate and geography. Rice is the most widely grown cereal grain and consumed by humans in the world. One fifth of all calories eaten by people come from rice. Yen Bai is a mostly rural province located in the north of the country known for its rice growing and forestry products. The Thac Ba Hydroelectric Plant, one of the largest in Vietnam, is located in the Yen Bai province.\n\nElla Fitzgerald - Ella Fitzgerald was one of the best known jazz singers in America. She was born in 1917 in Newport News, Virginia, and moved with her mother to Yonkers, New York when she was young. She had a troubled childhood, facing the death of her mother and abuse at the hand of her stepfather. After living in orphanages and homeless for a time, she was discovered at the Apollo Theater in Harlem during one of their amateur nights. Fitzgerald went on to have one of the most successful and long lasting recording careers in the history of popular music. Over her 59 year career, she recorded 70 albums, and was awarded 13 Grammys.

He lives with his family in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nMyra Kinch WPA Poster - During the Great Depression, millions of Americans were with without work. Under President Roosevelt, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) was created to provide public works employment. Artists who were unemployed at the time received commissions as part of the WPA to create promotional posters such as this one for the Federal Theatre Project. Myra Kinch was a popular choreographer in dancer in the 1930s, performing shows all around the country.\n\nTypewriter Chapter 1 - The modern incarnation of the typewriter came into existence by the mid-1880s. Devices had been patented and invented to strike moveable type on paper dating back to the 16th century. One of the first typewriters was the moveable ball machine invented by Rasmus Malling-Hansen of Denmark in 1865. The first to be commercially successful was invented in the United States by Christopher Latham Sholes, Carlos Glidden, and Samuel W. Soule. It was the first machine to use the name typewriter and contained the QWERTY keyboard. Sholes laid the keys out in this order to prevent them from jamming together while typing. By the 1890s, the QWERTY layout became standard on most typewriters, and keyboards on most computing devices today, including phones, continue to use this layout.\n\nCyrillic Typewriter - By the mid-1880s, the typewriter became a widely used device for written correspondence. The keys were arranged in the QWERTY pattern by its inventors so they would not jam when used. For typewriters used in countries that use the Latin alphabet, the keys remain more or less in the same order. However, the keys are arranged differently on those made for languages that use other alphabets, such as Cyrillic. The keyboard on a Cyrillic typewriter also has the keys arranged so that they will not jam when rapidly typing the most commonly used words in the language. The typewriter has been replaced by word processing software in many parts of the world; however, the arrangement of keys remains in use on most computers and cell phones.\n\nIce Cream Sandwiches - Food coloring makes culinary creations such as these possible. Food cannot be dyed with the same chemicals used to color clothing, as any additive must be edible. Although pink, yellow, and green are naturally occurring pigments in many foods, in order to get these ice cream sandwiches bright and lasting in color, artificial colors are used. In the United States the Food and Drug Administration currently authorizes the use of seven coloring additives. The colors used in these ice cream snacks include erythrosie for the pink, tatryzine for the yellow, and a chemical containing triarymelthane for the green coloring.\n\nPen and Paper - Penmanship is becoming a lost ability. As long as writing has been around, people have used styli and later ink to manipulate symbols in order to offer written communication. Some of the world's greatest documents were written with pen and ink, including the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. With the invention of typewriter, in widespread use by the 1880s, creating official documents in handwriting became exceedingly rare. The Feathers to Fountain display case on the first floor of the Arts and Sciences Building shows the evolution of the pen and some of the important documents created using this timeless form of writing. The display is near the main entrance to the building adjacent the elevators.\n\nCabbage - Cabbage (Brassica oleracea) is a biennial plant, part of the cruciferous, or cole crop of vegetables, and is commonly grown in northern latitudes. Other cruciferous vegetables include brussels sprouts, Kohlrabi, collard greens, and broccoli. Like the other cole crops, cabbage is high in Folate, B Vitamins, Vitamin C, and Vitamin K. Cabbage forms the base of a variety of dishes, including sauerkraut, pierogi and coleslaw. China, India, and Russia are the world's largest producers of cabbage. The folded leaves that make up a cabbage head provide an excellent culinary display effect.\n\nKiwi Fruit - Also known as Chinese gooseberry, the kiwi is the edible berry from a variety of plants of the Actinidia genus. The most common variety consumed in the United States is known as the fuzzy kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa), named so because of its thin, fuzzy skin. Kiwifruits are native to China, with the A. deliciosa variety first grown commercially in New Zealand. In order to get around high tariffs on melons and berries, the American importers of the fruit in the 1950s named it kiwi, after the national bird of New Zealand. Despite its namesake, Italy is actually the world's top producer of Kiwifruit, New Zealand is second. The United States now ranks 9th in worldwide production, growing over 28,000 tons per year.\n\nGirl Eating Noodles - Noodles and widely consumed around the world.
