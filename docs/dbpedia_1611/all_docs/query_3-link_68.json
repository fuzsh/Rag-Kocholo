        "text": "As the largest of all the landmasses in the entire world, Russia has an extensive coastline. It features on the periphery of the Arctic Ocean surrounding its entire North for trading prospects. The Barents Sea, with the South-Eastern side touching the Sea of Japan encompasses the major ports in Russia.\n\n60% of the total cargo movement on the international scale for Russia takes place through the sea. This includes almost 722 million MT (2016) cargo movement through international vessel calls.\n\nA staggering 67 thousand plus ship calls come through this busy network every year. However, the modern handling facilities ensure that the median handling time for these ships remains 1.45 days. This means the port facilities under the Russian Government’s reach are the best in the business!\n\nAs a shipping nation, the Russian seafarers are plenty in number across the globe. The country’s shipping strength boasts over 2820 vessel registrations and 98,000 seafarers under them.\n\nMajor Ports Of Russia\n\nIn this article, we review the major ports in Russia of inland and international importance. We highlight their share in building the 571 496 million current US$ shipping market in the country. The details also contain their accurate location, identity code, and other geographical information.\n\n1. Port of Novorossiysk (Krasnodar Krai, Russia)\n\nUN/Locode: RUNVS\n\nLatitude: 44.720065°\n\nLongitude: 37.81373°\n\nThe port of Novorossiysk has a 3.4 sq. km harbour area with a land area worth 2.7 sq. km. This includes a total of 89 functioning berths for vessels of all sizes. It features as the biggest seagoing port for Russia for over decades with almost 50% higher turnover.\n\nThe establishment of the port of Novorossiysk dates back to 1829, with major exchanges since 1846. The port’s range of services recorded 143 million MT of cargo handling for 2020. It includes one of the first Timber wood handling facilities to feature across the Black Sea ports.\n\nCargo Handling\n\nA total of 11 berths are important in handling timber and other bulk cargo. 4 separate berths over a quay length of 570 meters handle the container operations. The sheer size of the facility allows maximum handling limits of 208 million MT every year.\n\nNetwork and Layout\n\nThe timber operations across the 4 berths (31, 32, 31/A, 31/5) are the most advanced facility across Europe. Their throughput every year crosses figures between 400 thousand to 600 thousand.\n\nThis connects with direct railway and loading facilities, reaching out to 70% of timber industries. Meanwhile, 180 thousand and more TEU capacity of container handling adds to the port’s large-scale profits.\n\n2. Port of Saint Petersburg (St. Petersburg, Russia)\n\nUN/Locode: RULED\n\nLatitude: 59.91933°\n\nLongitude: 30.327035°\n\nThe Port of Saint Petersburg has one of the deepest drafts for any Russian facility. The inner anchorage ranges between 23 to 25 meters while the channel draft is approx. 18.5 to 23 meters.\n\nAs one of the major ports in Russia, its water area spreads over an expanse of 164 sq. km. Meanwhile, the beginning of its establishment dates back to 1869. At present, the facility uses 470 vessels for in-house operations along their coast.\n\nThe passenger terminal at St. Petersburg handles over 450 vessels annually. This happens over a dozen of berths, with 2 major terminals having the alongside the extent of 360 meters.\n\nCargo Handling\n\nThe total mooring size capacity of this facility is over 30 kilometres. This includes the working capacity of more than 200 berths of various sizes in this facility.\n\nSt. Petersburg famously works with 8 major cranes of Panamax capacity. This couples with 3 RMG and 20 gantry nature cranes for handling container goods. This rounds off to the port’s annual handling figures to well over 2 million every year.\n\nNetwork and Layout\n\nThe facility connects with major cargo shipping destinations through 2 dozen operating lines. It acts as the major gateway for providing shipping access to the Russian interiors. The neighbouring ports like Rotterdam, Bremerhaven, etc. act as the feeder terminals for the super container ships.\n\nOver 122 tugs and 3 dozen oil barges are resident for berthing and bunkering operations. The rail line operates through the container segment of the port, handling container transport.\n\n3. Port of Ust-Luga (Kingiseppsky District, Russia)\n\nUN/Locode: RUULU\n\nLatitude: 59.68294°\n\nLongitude: 28.329515°\n\nThe port of Ust-Luga stands only behind Novorossiysk in terms of cargo handling volume for 2020. It has the biggest handling facility for coal bulk operations in the Northern part of Russia. The additional expansion plans provide this facility with a total area of 30 sq. km.\n\nUst-Luga has 5 major berths that operate for round the year operation in severe temperatures. These handle over 30 vessels at once with anchorage facilities over 20 meters and higher depth.\n\nThe state-of-art coal loading facilities handle export abilities up to 20 million MT annually. It also is one of the newest facilities in Russia, dating back to 2011 for its establishment.\n\nCargo Handling\n\nThe loading conveyors for the coal handle up to 500 MT every hour on average. This facility accommodates vessels ranging up to 60,000MT of DWT for coal loading.\n\nIn addition, Ust-Luga also handles livestock, liquid, and general cargo operations.
