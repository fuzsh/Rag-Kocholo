        "text": "10 aircraft carriers, 3 cruisers, 49 destroyers, 150 frigates, 77 submarines, 300 misc.\n\nThe Royal Navy emerged from ww2 with a mountain of new and modern ships, with many more under construction, ranging from submarine and destroyers to ASW frigates, cruisers and aircraft carriers, light and heavy. Second maritime power to the USA, however, the country was no longer in budgetary position to take advantage of it.\n\nSir Winston Churchill coined his famous expression at the “Iron Curtain Speech” on March 14, 1946. He was merely voicing the new potential threat for the soon-to-be-called “free world” to the east. Stalin’s staunch posture however met the will of the West by 1947 in the blocus of Berlin. Rearmament started again. This was also true for the Royal Navy, that despite huge budgetary constrains had to make choices in order to operate a fleet (still the largest European fleet by a wide margin) capable of blocking access to the Soviet Navy out in the Atlantic, and to patrol and defend what was left of the Commonwealth if needed. India was then a hot topic too and a strong fleet was posted in the Far East. In theory, like for the US Navy, the ship’s park was such that no new construction were needed at least until 1960. So the first years were spent in modernizing ships under construction, with delayed launches. Such delays also saw the last British battleship ever to be inaugurated, HMS Vanguard.\n\nTribal class Frigate, HMS Eskimo (1975)\n\nHowever past the 1960s, the fleet inherited from the last war was largely gone, and the Navy new needs revolved around reduced task-forces and Atlantic patrols, notably with a new generation of ASW Frigates capable of dealing with the mass of conventional Soviet submarines that soon invaded the Atlantic, not to mention the considerable budget strain represented by building and maintaining a fleet of nuclear-powered strategic submarines and attack submarines, naval component of national deterrence. Apart the Franco-British expedition in Suez in 1954, and naval support in Korea, no major action was undergone by the Royal Navy until 1982, the Falklands War.\n\nHMS Victorious after refit in the 1960s.\n\nSince 1990 the old lady in service of the Queen and Country saw the end of the Cold War, new budgetary retraints but also a brand new generation of ships emerging (Astute class SNA, Albion class LSH, Type 45/Daring class DDs, River-class patrol sloops), including the remarkable HMS Queen Elisabeth, first true aircraft carrier since the 1950s and largest British ship ever put to sea, soon to be followed by HMS Prince of Wales. A more homogeneous and versatile fleet ready to tackle an uncertain world for the next thirty years and more.\n\nThe Royal Navy after the War\n\nFor the past forty-three years of Cold War, Great Britain has not been at war with its neighbors, but the years 1947-95 were traumatic for the Navy as having more change as any in its previous history. The budgetary situation after the end of the Second World War badly hit by an economy in sorry state and recession, but the colossal subsidies of the Lease-Lend has been suddenly withdrawn, making an urgent need to release personal from the armed forces, and meaning that large numbers of ships would be disarmed in a short notice.\n\nThe huge scale pruning of the Reserve Fleet removed all but be surviving battleships, all cruisers earlier than ww2 and all prewar destroyers. Almost every one of these were scrapped, but a handful found their way into other navies. Merchant ships were to be manned, but there was no priority for these as battleship design continued until as late as the 1950s, largely because of rumors about Russian capital ships being completed. There was a tacit admission however that battleships were in any case of limited value. With less validity reasoning was applied to cruiser designs, for at this time military thinking was dominated by fears of a nuclear war and military writers and theorists believed that warships had no role since a future war would be decided by long-range vectors with nuclear weapons.\n\nLeander class Frigate, HMS Apollo (1976)\n\nIt was recognised by more perceptive planners that the aircraft had still a major role to play, and so permission was given to work on two large and four intermediate hulls from the programme. The very big Malta class had been cancelled1 before any work had been done on them, but the hulls chosen, of the Africa class, were a better-balanced design, probably better balanced and were, therefore, more cost-effective, with a fully enclosed hangar space, a necessity for nuclear war.\n\nThe modernization of the six wartime armoured carriers was looked into, but it was found that the restricted hangar height ruled out the newest jets, and condemned the two Implacables and Indomitable. Of the other three, Illustrious and Formidable had suffered heavy war damage, leaving only HMS Victorious. It is interesting to note that before the survey, made in 1949, which settled her fate, modernization plans had been drawn up for HMS Formidable: she would have had a fully angled flight deck, some two years before the RAE Bedford Conference at which the angled deck is claimed to have been invented. In fact, it was the intention to modernize all six carriers; Victorious was uniquely the prototype.\n\nOne of the last British Cruisers, HMS Tiger\n\nArticles\n\nRN Cold War\n\nBritish Cold War Carriers:\n\nMajestic class | Centaur class | HMS Victorious | HMS Eagle | HMS Ark Royal | HMS Hermes | CVA-01 project | Invincible class | HMS Argus | Queen Elisabeth class (planned)\n\nCentaur class Aircraft Carriers (1947)\n\nCounty class missile destroyers (1960)\n\nExplorer class Submarines (1954)\n\nHMS Ark Royal (1955)\n\nHMS Bristol (1969)\n\nHMS Eagle (1946)\n\nHMS Hermes (1953)\n\nHMS Vanguard (1944)\n\nHMS Victorious (cold war)\n\nMajestic class aircraft carriers\n\nSheffield (Type 42) class missile destroyers (1971)\n\nStickleback-class submarine\n\nBritish Cold War Cruisers\n\nTiger class (1945)\n\nDestroyers\n\nDaring class (1949)\n\n1953 design (project)\n\nCavendish class (1944)\n\nWeapon class (1945)\n\nBattle class (1945)\n\nFADEP program (1946)\n\nCounty class GMD (1959)\n\nBristol class GMD (1969)\n\nSheffield class GMD (1971)\n\nManchester class GMD (1980)\n\nType 43 GMD (1974)\n\nBritish cold-war Frigates\n\nRapid class (1942)\n\nTenacious class (1941)\n\nWhitby class (1954)\n\nBlackwood class (1953)\n\nLeopard class (1954)\n\nSalisbury class (1953)\n\nTribal class (1959)\n\nRothesay class (1957)\n\nLeander class (1961)\n\nBB Leander class (1967)\n\nHMS Mermaid (1966)\n\nAmazon class (1971)\n\nBroadsword class (1976)\n\nBoxer class (1981)\n\nCornwall class (1985)\n\nDuke class (1987)\n\nBritish cold war Submarines\n\nT (conv.) class (1944)\n\nT (Stream) class (1945)\n\nA (Mod.) class (1944)\n\nExplorer class (1954)\n\nStrickleback class (1954)\n\nPorpoise class (1956)\n\nOberon class (1959)\n\nHMS Dreanought SSN (1960)\n\nValiant class SSN (1963)\n\nResolution class SSBN (1966)\n\nSwiftsure class SSN (1971)\n\nTrafalgar class SSN (1981)\n\nUpholder class (1986)\n\nVanguard class SSBN (started)\n\nAssault ships\n\nFearless class (1963)\n\nHMS Ocean (started)\n\nSir Lancelot LLS (1963)\n\nSir Galahad (1986)\n\nArdennes/Avon class (1976)\n\nBrit.

There was also the question of replacing out-of-date weaponry, and to correct the situation a series of major refits was put in hand in the early 1950s. Battleships were considered for conversion to missile ships, but, as in the United States, the cost was seen to be prohibitive and out of all proportion to any improvement in fighting value, so work on the battleships was confined to routine maintenance. Finally, the modernisation programme was cut back to one carrier and as many cruisers and destroyers as possible.\n\nHMS Blake after conversion, Key West 1978\n\nThe Southampton and “Colony” classes and HMS Belfast were all given partial modernizations between 1950 and 1960, but mounting costs and aging of the ships caused the programme to be cut back at Swiftsure. It has been suggested that the HMS Swiftsure turned out to have been inadequately surveyed after sustaining severe damage in collision with the destroyer Diamond during the big NATO exercise “Mainbrace” in 1953, and that by the time the extent of the damage became evident in 1960 the ship’s modernization had been almost completed; nothing could be done to remedy the situation and she was towed away to the scrapyard.\n\nHMS Charity off Korea, 1952\n\nApart from the “Battle” class and later destroyers, virtually all the wartime “Emergency” destroyers were unsuitable for modem warfare because of inadequate air defence and fire control. Current needs for fleet escorts were met by the big destroyers, but there were no fast escorts to cope with the new Soviet “Whiskey” class submarines. The “Emergency” destroyers were ideal for conversion and so the Type 15 frigate design by N G Holt, was drawn up as a stopgap until the new frigate designs were ready. Despite the end of the Korean War, East-West tension remained high throughout the 1950s, and to make up numbers other simpler and cheaper conversions were also put in hand.\n\nIt is not often realized that corrosion was a major problem with war-built ships. Before the war, mill scale was removed by pickling in dilute acid; thin plating, particularly in destroyers, was galvanized. To save time, war-built ships did not receive either treatment and by the end of the war were usually in a worse condition than older vessels.\n\nDetailed Review: Modernized ships of the Royal Navy\n\nBattleships\n\nHMS Roberts 1965\n\nAlthough the breed was no longer in favour, Aircraft Carriers being the new capital ships in favor, these were still many battleships in service in 1947:\n\n-HMS Nelson: The valiant 1925 battleship was no longer in service in 1945 already, but she she was officially broken up in 1948.\n\n-King Georges V class: Much more modern, these four battleships were still an asset but were not kept in service, being mothballed instead for some more years, stripped of their AA artillery, useful elsewhere. These were quad- and eight barrelled 40mm Bofors “pom-Pom” units. King Georges V was paid off in 1946 but served as a private ships and went into reserve. The HMS Anson served as training ship in Portland before being decommissioned in 1949 and paid off. HMS Howe was an harbour training ship at Portsmouth 1950-51, then flagship pf training RA until 1947, then paid off and BU in 1949. Duke of York was the flagship of the Home fleet, then reserved fleet until 1951. Until their demolition there were talks of conversion to missile ships, considered but dropped.\n\n-Monitors: HMS Roberts and Abercrombie (1941-42) were the last British monitors, served as training and reserved ships after 1947, and went into list removal in 1953-55 until broken up in 1954 (Abercrombie) and 1965 (Roberts).\n\nHMS Vanguard\n\nBlueprint of the HMS Vanguard\n\nThe Last british Battleship. The end of a breed that emerged with HMS warrior in 1860. The Vanguard was originally planned in 1939 to complete the battleship serie by using the spare 381 mm (15-in) gun armed turrets of the former battlecruisers HMS Courageous and Glorious. This was to be a 30 knots battleships for the Far East, to deal with Japanese Ships. She was laid down however at John Brown not until November 1941, launched in November 1944, and with prospects of victory on Japan, construction slowed down and more priorities emerged. Ultimately the Vanguard was completed after many modifications on August 1946.\n\nShe would never fire a shot in the war she was built for. The turrets imposed many compromises and the vanguard was not an overall successful design. She nevertheless was kept as prestige ship for the fifties, received some AA armament modifications in service (refit at Devonport 1947-48) and went in the Mediterranean, then training ship at Portland, refitted at Devonport in 1954, then paid off in reserve, flagship of the reserve fleet and NATO HQ ship until sold for scrap in 1960.\n\nAircraft Carriers\n\nIllustrious class\n\nHMS Illustrious after reconstruction to operate jets, circa 1954\n\nHMS Illustrious, Victorious, Formidable and Indomitable (renamed R87, 38, 67 and 92) were pretty much spent after their very active life in WW2. Apart HMS Victorious, which was rebuilt, they served as reserve ships until 1949, and were broken up in 1953-56. HMS Illustrious however was taken in hands for refit, from which she emerged in mid-1946, with a more powerful catapult, 30% more aviation fuel, remodelled ends for the flight deck, and she served eight years as a trial and training carrier. She operated the first British sea jets, and had a new all-40 mm Bofors AA artillery. Similar modernization prospects for the HMS Formidable were soon dropped. For the second refit of HMS Victorious see later. She was broken up in 1969.\n\nIndomitable was back in the UK by November 1945, repatriating personal. She would do two more trooping runs until 1946 and in 1947-50 was refitted as HMS Ilustrious, joining the Home Fleet for a three-eyears commission, armed finally with 24 single Bofors, five octuple Bofors and her aircraft complement included the last and best piston-planes of their generation, the Firefly, Sea Fury, Sea Hornet, Firebrand, and early ASR helicopters. HMS Indomitable was in reserved by 1953 and was scrapped in 1955.\n\nA supermarine Seafire landing on Illustrious in 1947\n\nImplacable class\n\nHMS Implacable (R86) in 1949.\n\nBoth carriers arrived late into WW2 and knew little service in fact postwar. HMS Implacable returned in 1946 from the BPF and served for tes-landings of new planes in the Home fleet. In late 1947 up to 1949 her air graoup as allocated was changed miltiple times and was difficult to setup. She ended with 13 Sea Hornet and 12 Firebrands, a meagre 25 planes, and later 4 sea Vampires, the first jets, were added. 12 Barracudas arrived next summer for ASW operations.\n\nShe operated as such until 1950 but was soon placed into reserved then served as training carrier until 1954, and was discarded, sold and scrapped the next year. From late 1944 to 1955 this represented barely ten years of service, quite a short time for a large, costly fleet carrier.\n\nThe HMS Indefatigable did not fare batter. She also served with the BPF in the far east and made several repatriation runs. From 1950 she served as a training carrier. Her hangars were trasnformed into classrooms and messdecks, and she was eventually placed into reserve in 1954, sold and scrapped in 1956. The dilemna was both ships were not large or sturdy enough for jets and reconstruction cost would have been too steep.\n\nHMS Unicorn\n\nThe ww2 escort carrier was placed in reserve right away upon return from the far east. However when the Korean war broke out, her commission as prolongated until 1953, she served with ther WW2 air complement and without much change in AA nor electronics. She however was probably one of the very few carriers in the RN to bombard land targets in Korea with her main dual purpose 5-in artillery. Her commission expired in 1953, and she became a ferry carrier upon her return. she was mothballed and sold for scrapped in 1959.\n\nColossus class light fleet aircraft carriers\n\nForeign sells:\n\nGeneral appearance of HNLMS Karel Doorman after reconstruction in the early 1960s (Conways).\n\n-HMS Colossus was transferred to France and became Arromanches, soldiering in Indochina and Suez, she was discarded and later scrapped in 1878.\n\n-HMS Venerable was sold to the Dutch, and became Karel Doorman. She replaced the smaller Nairana and served for the best part of the sixties and she was resold to Argentina in 1969. Under the new name of Veinticinco de Mayo she took part in the Falklands war in 1982.\n\n-HMS Warrior became Canadian for just two years in leasing 1946-48, returned in UK, was modernized, and resold in 1959 to Argentina as Independencia.\n\n-HMS Vengeance was lent to the RAN as HMAS Melbourne, returned and in 1956 became the Brazilian first carrier, Minas Gerais.\n\nBritish Carriers in operations\n\nHMS Warrior off Gibraltar in the late 1950s, as modernized.\n\nWithout much modifications, HMS Glory, Ocean, Theseus and Triumph served wth distinction over Korea. At their return however the jet age condemned them and after been used as training ships or for menial tasks, Ocean, Glory and Theseus were scrapped in 1961-62.\n\n–HMS Warrior was converted to test a steel ramp for jets back in the UK in 1949, testing also a flexible landing deck to cushion jets. This odd solution was made of rubber band over air bags, estended to the rear over 150 feets. In 1952-53 she was comprehensively modernized, of course the “magic carpet” flight deck was dismounted and she went out for dockyard with a lattice foremast and enlarge bridge (which served as prototype for the Karel Doorman’s own reconstruction). In 1955 her deck received a partial angled deck and stronger arrester to operate 15000 Ib planes landing at 60 knots. A catapult was fitted forward, powerful enough to launch a 14,000 ib jet. She acted as HQ ship for nuclear tests in the pacific, Christmas Island and upon her return in 1957 was proposed to Argentina and sold in 1958, and she had a reduced AA.\n\nHMS Triumph in January 1972\n\n-HMS Triumph returned home a veteran of WW2 and Korea, and served home as a training ships for officer cadets. The 1956-57 estimates order her to be converted as a repair ship. He hangars were filled with workshops, to assist various ships abroad far from any dockyard. While the idea was sound, the program was under-budgeted and suffered major delays, lasting over seven years. In the end she served only a few years as a repair ship and was place in reserved in 1981, sold and broken up in 1982.\n\nPerseus class light fleet aircraft carriers\n\nThese light fleet carriers of the Colossus class were completed as fleet repair ships for the Pacific. Unlike the Unicorn they could not operate aircraft because of the new heavy lifts, deckhouses on the main flying deck and heavy cranes but had had large and well-equipped facilities and workshops. In 1946 their AA was scrapped and replaced by sixteen 40 mm Bofors and displacement rose to 26,265 tond, 694 feets in lenght. In 1950 HMS persus was taken in hands for modifications: a steel structure was installed at the front, to test flights and a new catapult. The power was steam provided by the boilers of the ship, even if it was immobile. Both Perseus and Pioneers became ferry carriers in 1953, but the latter was sold for scrap in 1954 while Persus remained in service until 1958.\n\nMajestic class light fleet aircraft carriers\n\nWith the end of Hostilities, work stopped on the six carriers laid down and there were considerations to scrap them and free the slipways. However soon both Australia and Canada expressed their interest to acquire two of these, and work restarted on the HMS Magnificent and Terrible. In 1948 they were sent in their original design to their owners. The Australians acquired the Majestic, and heavily modified it previously, so they were about to do the same with HMS Terrible. In 1952, the RCAN acquired the HMS Powerful, which was also completely reconstructed and served for motst of the cold war. India acquired HMS Hercules, which became the Vikrant, also totally modernized. HMS leviathan was kept for spare parts, without commission.\n\nHMS Campania escort carrier\n\nThis was the sold survivor of a class of three identical refigerated ships converted into half-carriers (with reduced aircraft capacity and their storage capacity intact). She was the first CVE fitted with the new AIO combat system and Type 277 radar. She was recommissioned after reserve as a ferry carrier, capable of carrying 90 planes, armed with 2×2 Bofors and 2 single. However she was lent for the 1951 festival of Britain, and refitted later by Camell laird as an exhibition ship, touring Europe. Back in the admiralty she was refitted and carried scientists for the first British nuclear test at the Monte bello Islands in 1952. The next year she was laid up and finally scrapped in 1955.\n\nCruisers\n\nContrary to the USN which converted several conventional cruisers as missile ones, the British Royal Navy preferred to convert only the Tiger class. HMS belfast in London, on the Thames is now the last of these conventional cruisers. However most of the conventional fleet of cruisers, no less than thirty ships, served in the 1950-60s. The Belfast was the only one to escape scrapping, preserved in 1971.\n\n‘County’ class heavy cruisers\n\nThese interwar cruisers were fast ageing in 1946. The first to go, without much modifications, were the HMS London and Norfolk in 1950. They were followed by the Devonshire in 1954 and Cumberland in 1959.\n\n-HMS Cumberland became a trial ship in 1949-51 fitted with lattice masts, new directors and radars, plus accomodations. The armament was removed, escept for two single 4.5 in Mk.5 mounts. STAAG 40 mm Bofors were fitted with the new Battle class mk 37 director. In 1953 she carried a single foward turret aft, 3in/70 Mark 6 turret with MRS3 director, and a 6-in automatic turret forward Mk26. The trials campaigns lasted until 1958, allowing to perfect the pre-welling NR propellers and new stabilizer in addition to artillery.\n\n-HMS London was still in the far east in 1949, carrying troops back home. She was damaged by Chinese shore battery when trying to save the crew of HMS Amethyst, a stranded sloop in Chinese waters. Apart the removal of 20 mm guns, there were no changes and the ship started a career of cadet training ship with only the “A” turret kept, and twin 4-in mounts AA plus a quadruple pompom, single bofors, and three saluting guns. Her powerplant was reduced to four boilers, 21 knots. She was paid off at the end of 1953.\n\nLeander & Arethusa class light cruisers\n\nLeander was purchased by the RIN (Indian navy) and became the Delhi. India rejeted an offer to acquire also the Ajax and Leander. China however expressed interest and acquired the Galatea, renamed Chungking. The cruiser changed hands two times and served until the 1980s as an accomodation hulk.\n\n‘Town’ class cruisers\n\nHMS belfast, as for today. Her bridge has been completely rebuilt along the lines of the Tiger class, so the camouflage is a fancy recreation in this condition. The Belfast today in London is a mere “evocation” of a WW2 British Town class cruiser.\n\nIn 1950-52 HMS Birmingham and Southampton were modernized: New bridgework, new lattice masts, Mk6 directors and radars, and air conditioning to serve in the Far east. Both were discarded 1959 and 1960. Sheffield was also modernized the same way in 1956 and was discarded in 1967. HMS Glasgow was not altered and retired in 1958, as HMS Liverpool. Belfast served in the korean war and received a partial modernization in 1956. She received the new Tiger-type bridge, MRS8 directors and modified AA, with 6×2 40 mm Bofors, and two lattice masts. She was decommissioned at Portsmouth and acquired by a charitable organization for conversion as a museum.\n\nDido class AA cruisers\n\nPakistani PNS babur (ex-HMS Diadem).\n\nAll six ships were decommissioned in 1955-59. They were too cramped and light to take on new equipments and escaped modernization. Phoebe and Cleopatra received new US pattern 40 mm guns. Phebe was the first scrapped, in poor conditions after the collision in the Mediterranean. For the very close Bellona class, HMS Royalist was modernized in 1954 and transferred to new Zealand. HMS Diadem was modernized with lattice masts and new directors in 1956 and was later transferred to Pakistan as Babur.\n\n“Crown Colony” class light cruisers\n\nCeylon and Newfoundand were sold to Peru in 1959, Nigeria to India (INS Mysore) in 1957. They were criticized as cramped and had thin side armour. None was really modernized as there was no room for it. Only addition were ne covered bridges and CRBN directors, new Bofors AA. Main turrets were often removed. However Mysore, Ceylo and Newfoundland were modernized the same way as the southamptons. In peruvian service they were called Almirante Grau and Coronel Bolognesi.\n\nSwifsture class light cruisers\n\nHCMS Ontario in 1958\n\nBoth HMS Swiftsure and Superb were considered for extensive modernization, notably with the fitting of new automated turrets, on the line of the new Blake-class. Hwowever if work started at Chatham in 1956 and 1957, it was never completed, stopped by decision of the admiralty in 1959 as costly for obsolete and cramped ships. Both were scrapped, in 1962 and 1960 respectively. HMS HMS Minotaur was transferred to Canada before being completed, as HCMS Ontario, entering service in May 1945. She was scrapped in 1960.\n\nAbdiel class minelayers\n\nHMS Manxman at Sembawang, Singapore, March 1964, photo by K. Watson. Src shipspotting.com\n\nThe Manxman of the Abdiel class and Apollo and Ariadne of the latter class were used as flagships after the war due to their generous accomodations. HMS Manxman was comprehensively modernized in 1955: Aft twin 4-in removed and deckhouse built instead, and in 1962-63 at Chatham she was converted as a depot ship for coastal minesweepers, with storehouses and offices for repairing and maintaining 16 ships. The forward boiler room was emptied and replaced by additional storage space. She had 6 Bofors for close defence. She served until 1971. Apollo had new structures built, in 1954 her deckhouse was raised by one deck, and she retained her after 4-in twin mount. She was BU in 1962 whereas Ariadne was laid up in 1946 and left out of commission, for spare parts, only to be broken up in 1964.\n\nDestroyers\n\nHMS Cavendish during Exercise Fotex, 1964 (IWM)\n\nSo far, UK was still counting about a recent hundred destroyers in 1946. After mass-decommissions and srappings, the oldest ships kept were the N Napier class destroyers of 1940. They were broken up in 1955-58. Of the next M Milne class, four out of five were sold to Turkey in 1959.\n\nNapier was used for minesweeping testings after 1949. All except nepal had new lattice masts, and modernization ior conversion into Type 15/16 ASW Frigates was rejected due to their relative age but mostly worn-out conditions after wartime intensive service. HMS Musketeer became an accomodation ship for coastal forces in Harwich, and the ships destined to Turkey were modernized. The admiraly at some point envisioned their conversion as Type 62 air direction frigates.\n\nFor the Obdurate (O) class, three were discarded in 1955-64, three sold to Pakistan and three became Type 16 frigates (see later). Of the Q and R classes, three ships were sold to India in 1949, of the next S, T, V, W and U classes of 1942-43, only two were discarded whereas 18 were converted to type 15 and 7 to Type 16 Frigates, the remainder being sold to Yugoslavia (2 in 1956), and South Africa in 1950-53.\n\nThe Myngs an Cavendish class (1943-44) were modernized (see later) and the remainder sold to Israel (2), and Egypt (2). The new ‘C’ classes, Childers, Cossack, Cormwell of 1944-45 were sold to Pakistan (4 ships) and the remainder were discarded and BU in the 1960s.\n\nSouth African SAS Simon Van der Stel, type 15 Frigates in the 1970s.\n\nSaumarez and Volage were badly damaged by mines in the Corfu strait by Albanians in October 1946. There was an odd proposal to weld both (ine lost the stern, the other the bow), like the WW1 “Zubian”, called “sausage”, but it never passed the crew’s joke stage. Savage ad Teazer were used for propellers tests. Cavendish was modernized (see later). The Israeli ships were named Yaffo and Eilat, and the Egyptian El Fateh and El Qaher. HMS Creole and Crispin were given an prominent W/T cabin instead of B gun position, and the others received two Squid mortars and aft handling room. Armament was composed of modern mk5-7 40 mm Bofors mounts.\n\nHMS Creole as modified with the W/T cabin instead of B gun, 1947.\n\nBattle & Weapons class (1944-45)\n\nThe most modern WW2 British destroyers up to this point were still acceptable for service as is until the late 1950s. They were discarded in the 1960s and up to 1970-79 for those modernized. Two were sold to Pakistan, one to Iran, and the remainder converted as radar pickets, 8 ships, most of the completed “Weapons” class. The Battles were completed late into the war, and after it, and the 1st group earned a 4in startshell gun in Q position, and STAAG Mk2 40 mm mounts. HMS Saintes tested a Mk6 twin 4.5 in gun, for the future Daring class.\n\nThe quarterdeck 40 mm was replaced by a squid mortar on all ships. HMS Finisterre was used as a gunnery training ship, with accomodations and deckhouse instead of the TTs. She was renamed later HMS Vigo. Cadiz and Gabbard were sold to Pakistan in 1956 as Khaibar and Badr, in 1966 Sluys was sold to Iran, as Artemiz. She was its admiral ship, until the revolution. HMS Hogue was badly damaged in a collision with an Indian cruiser and laid up in Singampore, disarmed in 1961. The other ships of the 1st groups were discarded and BU in 1961-70. The second group destroyers were also discarded without modernization in the 1960s but the Barrosa, Agincourt, Coruna and Aisne were converted as radar pickets. For the Weapons group, all four were converted.\n\nSeacat missile on HMS Corunna in 1961\n\nAs a side note, a few German Destroyers were evaluated and cannibalized: Two Leberecht Maass class ships, and Z23 and Z30. R38 became the H40 and H97 was evaluated without new denomination. All four were discarded in 1947-49 due to poor conditions.\n\nModernized WW2 submarines\n\nSince the mass of ww2 submersibles were obsolete after the Type XXI and other German advanced propulsion prototypes were uncovered, some 68 of the T, S and U, and Acheron class stayed in service for years, until the 1960s and other were streamlined and stayed active until the 1970s. Netherlands (2), France (4), portugal (2) and Israel (2) actually received these and others were converted. Too small to be kept in the cold war fleet, S-Types that were not sold to France, Israel and Portugal were discarded in the 1960s. HMS Sidon was lost, sinking in 1959 because officially of an oxygen bottle and torpedo explosion. HMS Truculent was lost during a collision with a freighter in the Thames in 1950. Of the U class, the two survivors, HMS Untiring and Upstart were sank as targets.\n\nNot well known, the X-craft of 1944 fame, when they tried to sink the Tirpitz were still in service in 1952. New names: Netherland’s Seehund, Dolphin (1948), reverted in 1953 to the UK. French Sirène, Sybille, Sultane, Saphir, Portuguese Nautilo, Neptune, Israeli Rahav, Tanin. Two U class became the Greek Amfitri and Xifias, returned to the RN in 1952 and sunk as targets later.\n\nStreamlined and converted T class subs\n\nHMS Trump streamlined, P333\n\nThe overall shapes were better blended, hydrodynamics were pushed forward and new poerful batteries gave them an underwater boost. This modifications concerned the HMS Tapir, Token, Tireless, Talent and Teredo. Others were converted like the HMS Tiptoe, Trump, Taciturn, Tabard, Totem, Truncheon, Turpin, and Thermopylae. The range of modifications concerned mostly riveted hull models, with new batteries, streamlined conning tower into a “fin”, and reshaped bow casing. All boats, even the non modernized ones received a snorkel of the port side “snort” type, hinged at deck level. Deck Guns were generally removed, but the Portuguese ones. The welded hull ones were taken in hands for a full modernization from 1951.\n\n“T-Streamline” serie\n\nFive T class boats were taken in hands fo a partial modernization. They were old riveted hull types, therefore not given the same service span and same modenrization level. Nevertheless, they had the typical casing and fin, guns out, but same propulsion as before, two ASR diesels and two electric motors for 2500/1450 hp, same speed of 15,25 knots surfaced, but 1.4 knots more underwater as shown by the prototypes. Still quite low for cold war 1960s boats. They were however quieter enough to be used for ASW training. HMS Tireless was the prototype. Performances were also helped by new batteries delivering 6560 amp/hr instead of the old 5330 figure. No info is available on sensors upgrade, however the torpedoes carried were the new Mk20-23 models.\n\n“T-Conversion” serie\n\nThese 1944-45 welded hull boats (eight total) of the Taciturn and Tabard groups were converted in 1951-56. Modifications were quite extensive and comprised the following operations:\n\n-The pressure hull was cut in two\n\n-A New 20 feets section (in some cases 12-15 feets) was added at the rear for extra machinery room.\n\n-Two new electric motors were added with clutches to link them with diesels\n\n-Fourth battery section added with 6500 cells.\n\n-Guns and external TT removed\n\n-Snorkel radar added, new R/T masts\n\n-New streamlined fin fitted in place of the old kiosk\n\n-Bow and stern reshaped and streamlined\n\n-TT reduced to four bow, two stern with Mk23 ‘Grog’ and Mk8 torpedoes.\n\nOn Tabard and Trump, the fin was totally enclosed, whereas there was a small low-set bridge\n\nAs a result of the engine modifications, underwater speed more than doubled, at 15 knots.\n\nRead more: http://rnsubs.co.uk/articles/development/streamlining.html\n\nAcheron class modernized\n\nHMS Artful – Imperial War Museum\n\nThis also concerned the Acheron class, which were thoroughly modernized and deserved their own part. Their 20 mm guns were removed, low bow casings fitted with buoyancy tanks and external tubes blanked. Conversion started in 1955. Only one escaped it, HMS Aurochs, discarded in 1967, remarkably late for a WW2 submarine, “in her juice”.\n\nModernized Frigates\n\nThis concerned modernization of WW2 Hunt class ASW frigates, Grimsby, Bittern and Black Swan classes, Captain, River, loch, Bay and Flower class ships. They were deactivated and BU from 1955 to 1966. Many were sold too. Details below:\n\nHunt class Frigates\n\nOne of the “Hunt” class in service lng after British units: FGS Gneisenau F212, of the Bundesmarine in the 1970s.\n\nFrom 1947 they were all rerated AA Frigates since their ASW equipment was limited and obsolete. Few saw active service after the war, with partial recommission or training use. HMS brocklesby was converted as a disarmed test ship for a new variable-depht sonar on the quartedeck. HMS Mendip served two years during the civil war as Lin Fu and was returned to UK, then resold to Egypt as Mohamed Ali El Kebir. HMS Cottesmore joined her as Ibrahim El Awal. Denmark purchased the Blacksmore, Calpe and Exmoore in 1952-53 which became Esbern Snare, Rolf Krake and Valdemar Sejr.\n\nIndia was lent three ships, the Godavari, Ganga and Gomati, Norway had the Badsworth, Beaufort and Zetland sold and renamed Arendal, Haugesund and Tromsö, and Equador received the Quantock and Meynell, renamed Prdt. Alfare and Velasco Ibarra. Finally, the Federal West German Navy obtained three ships, the Raule, Brommy, and Gneisenau.\n\nGimsby, Bittern, Egret Black Swan class Frigates\n\nHMS Fleetwood was disarmed and served as a test ship for the admiralty signal and radar unit, with a new lattice masts, extra radars, deckhouses for accomodations forward and aft. HMS Stork and Pelican served for a few years after the war. The Black swan class ships were discarded in the RN in the 1950s except the HMS Erne, RNVR drillship Wessex 1952, HMS Whimbrel sold to Egypt as El Amir Faroukh, and Flamingo to the Bundesmarine as Graf Spee.\n\nThe modified Black Swan class served extensively on foreign stations in the 1950-60s. HMS Amethyst was badly damaged by Chinese artillery during the civil war on the Yangtse. These ships were given Mk5 mountings for their Bofors guns. They were fitted with lattice masts, only two ships retaining their tripods. Redpole and Starling became tenders, disarmed for navigational training. Actaeon, Hart and Mermaid were sold: They became the West German Hipper, Scheer and Scharnhorst from 1958.\n\nHMIS Sutlej in 1946, IWM\n\nCaptain & River class Frigates\n\nThe River class were for the most paid off since there was already a large provision of larger and more modern Loch, Castle and Bay classes already in service. In all surviving ships, 20 mm guns were replaced by 40 mm Bofors on new mounts, and Type 277 height-finder radar. HMS Helmsdale was disarmed and used as a trial ship for th Squid mortar system, with a twin launcher on B position. HMS Meon and Waverney were used to test propellers silencers, and Landing Ship Headquarters for LSH(S) crafts. There was a large aft deckhouse for the Royal Army personal. HMS Exe could have been converted that way (conflicted sources). The last ships of the class were BU in 1966.\n\nThe “Captain” class frigates were lend-lease US-built DE type escort destroyers and should be in theory returned to the USN according to the Lend-Lease agreements. However HMS Hotham (Buckley class) remained in service with the RN but she had been fitted in 1945 to provide power, an emergency station for Singapore, stripped of her armaments. In 1951 she was returned home to be used as a test ship for gas turbines. On paper she was to receive English Electric’ twin-shaft EL60A turbines for 2x 6000 hp total. They were never fitted as more modern model were already avilable. Technically she was returned to the USA but broken up in UK.\n\nLoch & Bay class Frigates\n\nThe relatively large Loch class Frigates proved very adaptable and could be updated postwar with a large array of new radars sensors and even armaments. They were part of the solution of the RN facing hordes of Soviet Submarines in the 1950-60s. The nine most modernized ships which served in the Persian gulf were modernized in 1955-57, with twin 4-in Mk19 guns, four single 40 mm Bofors Mk9 on the bridge wings and forecastle break and a twin Mk5 aft. Type 277 Q height-finder radar. They served until the late 1960s, seven ships were sold to New Zealand, one to Iran (Babr), one to Malaysia (Hang Tuah) while Loch Fada was used to test vertical launchers for the Seawolf missile, BU in 1976. Two more were converted as depot ships for minesweepers and small crafts.\n\nThe Bay class frigates had a weak ASW armament and were never really modernized. One became the Finnish Matti Kukri, and four, the Portuguese Alvarese Cabral, Don F. De Almeida, Pacheco de pereira, and Vaco da Gama in 1959-61. Two Bay class ended as C&C stations for overseas service. These were HMS Alert and Surprise whic had a full displacement of 2440 tonnes, were armed by two twin 4in/45 Mark 16, two ingle 40 mm Mk7, and four 3-pdr saluting. They also served as Yachts. The Surprise was converted as Royal Yacht with a glass cabin in lieu of the twin 4-in mount and both ships had increased accomodations. They were retired in 1965and Alert in 1981. The remainder were BU in 1958-59.*\n\nFlower & Castle class Frigates\n\nThese two ex-corvettes were returned by the Royal New Zealand Navy in 1948, and were retired on the navy list for three years they were thus the only survivant of the large numbers of Corvettes made for the RN from 1940 onwards. The reminder were disposed of in large numbers from 1946 some to be converted to whalecatchers and small coasters, but the majority to be scrapped.\n\nCastle class: Like other escorts these vessels were absorbed into the frigate category in 1947. Menay served with the training squadron at Portaldn, but the hulls for to small for any attempt of modernization and they were scrapped from the mid-1950s. Berkley castle capsized in drydock. At Sheerness during the distrasrous flood in February 1953 and was rever repaired. The weather ships were lent to the Air Ministry with the 40 mm Bofors guns and the Squid DC mortar cocooned, but never retired to naval service.\n\nMiscellaneous Ships\n\nMINESWEEPERS\n\nHalycon class: These were launched in 1936-38, displacing 1330t deep load, Franklin, Scott, Seagull and Sharpshooter reverted to surveying duties postwar. HMS Sharpshooter was renamed Shackleton in 1953. They were scrapped between 1956 and 1965.\n\nAlgerine class: They were launched 1941-45, 1225-1325t deep load. Eighty-three of these successful sweepers were retained; many were transferred to other navies, and served as training ships. They were surplus to requirements after it was realised during the Korean War that steel-hulled sweepers could no longer rely on degaussing for protection against magnetic mines.\n\nHMS Cadmus, Fancy, Liberty, Ready, Rosario and Spanker became the Belgian Georges Lecointe, A F Dufour, Adrien de Gerlache, Jan van Haverbeke, De Moor and De Brouwer (1949-53); HMS Hare became the Nigerian Nigeria (1959); HMS Flying Fish and HMS Pickle became the Ceylonese Vijaya and Parakrama (1949-58); HMS Fly became the Iranian Palang (1949); Pelorus and Rosamund became the South African Pietermaritzburg and Bloemfontein (1949); Arcturus, Aries, Gozo, Lightfoot and Postillion became the Royal Hellenic Navy’s Pyrpolitis, Armatolos, Polemistis, Navamachos and Machitis (1947); Mariner became the Burmese Yan Myo (1958); and HMS Minstrel became the Royal Thai Navy’s Phosampton (1947).\n\nCOASTAL FORCES\n\nVosper 73ft type: 47t deep load, MTB 386, 392, 502, 523-527, 529, 530, 532, 533\n\nThese were renumbered as fast patrol boats in 1950, MTB 386 and 392, and became the FPB 1001 and 1002, 523-527, 529, 530, 532 and 533 became the FPB 1023-1027, 1029, 1030, 1032 and 1033. FPB 1030 sank after a collision, with her sister FPB 1032 off the Netherlands coast on 28 March 1950, while FPB 1023 caught fire and blew up in Aarhus harbour, Denmark, on 17 May 1953. Only FPB 1002 survived (as a hulk) by 1956. The armament was mixed, some having a 6pdr forward, others twin 20mm. FPB 1032 received an experimental 4.5in/25.\n\nBritish Power Boat 71sft type:\n\nThese were 53t deep load. The serie which survived the war were the MTB 470, 480, 496, 498, 505-509, 519, 521, 522, 596, 598. Nine were renamed in 1947: HMS Proud Fusilier (ex-MTB 505), Proud Grenadier (ex-MTB 506), Proud Guardsman (ex-MTB 507), Proud Highlander (ex-MTB 508), Proud Knight (ex-MTB 509), Proud Lancer (ex-MTB 519), Proud Legionary (ex-MTB 522), Proud Patriot (ex-MTB 596) and Proud Patroller (ex-MTB 598), with 1000 added to their numbers. The others were all stricken by 1947, except MTB 470, 480, 496 and 498, which were renumbered as fast patrol boats FPB 1570, 1580, 1596 and 1598.\n\nCamper & Nicholson type:\n\nThese boats displaced 102.5t deep load. Ordered in 1941 and laid down in May 1942, was completed in 1945 for experimental purposes. She displaced 86.5t standard, was 117ft 3in oa x 19ft lin x 4ft 4in max (35.7m x 5.8m x 1.3m) and was fitted with 3-shaft gas turbine/gasoline machinery (one Gatric gas turbine plus two Packard engines, 5200shp = 34kts); she was unarmed and had a complement of thirty-one.\n\nRenumbered P 5559, she ran a series of trials in 1947 before being sold c1948.\n\nFairmile ‘D’ type:\n\nThese displaced 118t deep load, MTB 731, 750, 758, 759, 780, 790, 793, 794, 795.\n\nAll were renumbered, MTB 731, 750, 758, 779, 780, 785, 790 and 793-795, and they became the FPB 3001, 3002, 5001, 5003, 5010, 5013, 5031, 5032, 5033 and 5035-5037; 3001, 3002, 3050 and 3053 served as motor anti-submarine boats, (MA/SBs) the others as convertible MTBS/MGBS with four TT or two guns, 6pdrs in most, but 4.5in/25 in 5036. Only FPB 5001, 5035 and 5036 were still in service by 1958 and they were put on the disposal list shortly afterwards.\n\nModified Fairmile ‘D’ type:\n\nDisplacement 118t deep load – The serie comprised the MTB 5002, 5005, 5007, 5008, 5009, 5015, 5020\n\nThese craft were numbered in the same series as the ordinary D-type, and so were not renumbered, merely reclassified as FPBS. They were armed as convertible MTBS/MGBS, rearmed with 6pdr guns and 21in TT. 5009 mounted two 4.5in/25 by 1958 only FPB 5015 and 5020 survived, but they were soon put on the disposal list.\n\nFairmile ‘F’ type\n\nMGB 2001 Prototype ‘F’ had four Bristol Hercules engines. Other than that, the Fairmile B’ Type Motor Launches displaced 85.6t deep load.\n\nThese were the ML 2154-2156, 2217, 2220, 2221, 2223, 2237, 2248, 2250, 2337, 2338, 2342, 2357, 2360, 2461, 2462, 2489, 2491, 2493, 2564, 2567, 2568, 2571, 2575-2577, 2581-2583, 2585, 2586, 2592, 2593, 2595, 2866, 2869, 2882, 2886, 2901, 2906, 2912, 2919, 2921; RML 495, 496, 498, 512, 515, 529.\n\nMost were scrapped or sold in the 1950s and only five were in service by 1958.\n\nHarbour Defence Motor Launches (HDML):\n\nThese 54t deep load ships were the SDML 1001, 1053, 1081, 1085, 1091, 1301, 1323, 1326, 1329, 1393, 1411, 3328, 3501-3503, 3505-3508, 3510-3516, Meda (ex-SML 352, ex-ML 1301). Most were scrapped in the 1950s, only nine remaining by 1958. Several served in the Far East as gunboats, with a power-operated 6pdr forward and a 20mm aft. Latterly they were re-rated as Seaward Defence MLs.\n\nAmphibious ships\n\nLCM (7)\n\nAbout 50 were left, three had been discarded in the 1950s.\n\nLCT (8)\n\nThese were 126ft Motor Minesweepers: 430t deep load. The serie represented the MMS 1002-1004, 1011, 1017, 1030, 1034, 1038, 1042, 1044, 1048, 1060, 1061, 1075, 1077, 1089, 1090 4086, 409\n\nLCT 400 series\n\n105ft Motor Minesweepers: 295t deep load. These were the MMS 1501, 1505, 1532, 1534-1536, 1546, 1548, 1550, 1553, 1556, 1558, 1569, 1579, 1583, 1584, 1586, 1599, 1600, 1602-1606, 1609, 1610, 1635, 1644, 1667, 1672, 1681, 1685, 1717, 1724, 1728, 1733, 1736, 1761, 1763, 1771, 1772, 1775, 1783, 1785, 1786, 1788-1791, 1794.\n\nBoth the 126ft and 105ft types were replaced by the Ton’, ‘Ham’ and ‘Ley’ classes in the 1950s, although four of the large type served for longer as degaussing vessels DGV 401-404. 408.\n\nEX-GERMAN MOTOR TORPEDO-BOATS\n\nAt the end of the Second World War about 34 ex-Schnellboote or ‘E-Boats’ were handed over. Most were scrapped, but three were retained for experimental purposes, S 130, S 208 and S 212. These were renumberedP 5230, P 5208 and P 5212. Displacing 105t normal load and 114ft 6in oa x 16ft 9in x 6ft mean (34.9m x 5.Im x 1.8m), they were fitted with 3-shaft diesels (P 5230 Mercedes-Benz engines, 7500bhp; P 5212 1 Mercedes-Benz engines + 2 Napier Deltic, 9,000 bhp; P 5208 3 Napier Deltic, 9,000bhp) giving 39kts. Oil carried: 20t, complement about fifteen.\n\nP 5212 operated in British waters until paid off for scrapping in 1956. The other two were employed on what were officially described as fishery protection duties under the British Flag Officer, Germany. What this actually involved was surveillance of the Soviet Navy in the eastern Baltic.\n\nBoth craft, unarmed and fitted with equipment for monitoring signals, observed manoeuvres, trusting to their big margin of speed to get away if detected. In 1957 these marine equivalents of the U-2 spy-plane were handed over to the newly formed Bundesmarine in 1957 and renumbered UW 10 and UW 11. They were rearmed for training duties with the two TT and were finally scrapped in 1964-65.\n\nCold War British STEAM GUNBOATS\n\nGrey Seal class: launched 1941-42, 255t deep load\n\nThe serie comprised the HMS Grey Seal, Grey Fox, Grey Wolf, Grey Goose.\n\nThree of the survivors were sold and scrapped in 1948-49, but HMS Grey Goose was selected to replace the frigate Hotham as the trials ship for the prototype Rolls-Royce PM60 gas turbine. She was taken in hand in 1952 and given two funnels with sharply raked tops. In 1954-55 she ran a series of intensive trials, paving the way for the successful ‘marinising’ of the G2 and Proteus for small craft and the G6 for large ships. When the trials were over in 1955 she was stripped and laid up. She was sold in December 1957.\n\nCold War British AMPHIBIOUS WARFARE SHIPS\n\nLST (3): launched 1944-45, 4980t deep load\n\nHMS Frederick Clover (LST 3001), Ansio (LST 3003), Tromsö (LST 3006), LST 3008, Reginald Kerr (LST 3009), Avenger (LST 3001), Ben Nevis (LST (Q) 1, ex-LST 3012), Ben Lomond (LST (Q) 2, ex-LST 3013), LST 3014, Battler, (LST 3015), Dieppe (LST 3016), LST 3017, Vaagsö (LST 3019), Charles, McLeod (LST 3021), LST 3022, Maxwell Brander (LST 3024), Bruizer (LST ) Bruizer (LST 3025), Charger (LST 3026), Lofoten (LST 3027), Snowden Smith (LST 3028), Chaser (LST 3029), LST 3031, LST 3033, LST 3035, Puncher (LST 3036), Evan Gibb (LST 3037), Fighter (LST 3038), LST 3040, LST 3041, Hunter (LST 3042), Messina (LST 3043), Narvik (LST 3044), LST 3501, Pursuer (LST 3504), Ravager (LST 3505), LST 3507, Scorcher (LST 3508), Humphrey Gale (LST 3509), Slinger (LST 3510), Reggio (LST 3511), LST 3512, Salerno (LST 3513), Smiter (LST 3514), Stalker (LST 3515), Striker (LST 3516), St Nazaire (LST 3517), Suvla (LST 3518), LST 3519, Thruster (LST 3520), Tracker (LST 3522), Trouncer (LST 3523), Trumpeter (LST 3524), Walcheren (LST 3525), Zeebrugge (LST 3532), LST 3524\n\nNumbered craft were all sold by 1950 or transferred. Some became the Australian Tarakan, Labuan and Lae in 1951 – and all vessels with generals’ names (Frederick Clover, etc) had been on charter to the War Department from 1946. Avenger became Indian Magar in 1951 and Smiter was wrecked off Lagos, Portugal, on 25 April 1949. In 1956 Tromsö, Attacker, Battler, Charger, 3033, Fighter, 3041, Hunter, Pursuer, 3507, Slinger, 3512, St Nazaire, 3519, Thruster, Trouncer, Trumpeter, Walcheren and 3524 were chartered commercially and renamed Empire Gannet, Empire Cymric, Empire Puffin, Empire Nordic, Empire Shearwater, Empire Grebe, Empire Doric, Empire Curlew, Empire Tern, Empire Gaelic, Empire Kittivake, Empire Celtic, Empire Skua, Empire Baltic, Empire Petrel, Empire Gull, Empire Fulmar, Empire Guillemot and Empire Cedric. The rest were broken up from 1970 onwards. In 1964 Loforen was converted to a helicopter support ship, with a flight deck to enable her to carry six Wessex ASW helicopters out to sea for deep-water training. Last in service was the RFA Empire Gull, scrapped in 1980. Lofoten, latterly in service as a dockyard hulk, was broken up in 1994.\n\nLCM (7): Launched 1943-44, 63t ships.\n\nLeft, three serving as naval servicing boats (NSB) and stores carriers. Several had been re-engined.\n\nLCT (8): launched 1945-47, 810t loaded\n\nThe serie comprised the LCT 4001, 4002, 4025, 4037-4045, 4049, 4050, 4061-4064, 4073, 4074, 4085, 4086, 4097-4099, 4128, 4148, 4156, 4164, 4165, LCT 4001, 4002, 4037-4041, 4043, 4044, 4049, 4061, 4062, 4064, 4073-4074, 4085, 4086, 4097, 4099, 4128 and 4164 were renamed Redoubt, Agheita, Rampart (later Akyab), Citadel, Parapet, Bastion, Abbeville, Counterguard, Portulis, Audemer, Aachen, Sallyport, Ardennes, Antwerp, Agedabia, Arromanche, dalnes, Buttress, Arezzo and Arakan in 1956. Numbered craft were put on the disposal list in 1958-60, Counterguard became the Malaysian Sri Lanebar 57, 1965, Buttress was sold to France as L 9061 in 1965 and Bastion was tranferred to Zambia in 1966. The remainder were disposed of from 1965 onward.\n\nIn 1980, HMS Abbeville, Agheila and Audemer were still being operated by the Royal Corps of Transport.\n\n-LCT (3): Launched 1941-44, 640t loaded. The serie comprised the LCT (E) 341, LCT (E) 413, 341 was lent to the Royal Malaysian Navy as Malaya (MRC 1401); MRC 1413. (ex-LCT(E) 413) was scrapped. LCT (4): launched 1942-45, 640t loaded.

A total of 286, ranging from LCA 1010 to 1992, were on strength in 1947, most were scrapped in the 1960s.\n\n-LCH: built 1943, 5t. The serie comprised the LCH 243, broken up circa 1955.\n\nLCP(L): built 1942, 104t\n\nThe ten survivors, ranging from LCP(L) 519 to 561 and 501, were scrapped in 1955 up to the the 1960s.\n\nThe following minelayers were in service in 1947: Plover (BU 1968), Blackbird (ex-Sheppey) (sold 1949), Dabchick (ex-7Thorney) (to Malaya 1954), Stone chat (BU 1967), Redshank (ex-Turbot) (BU 1957), Ringdove (sold 1950), Linnet (BU 1964), Miner I (ex-M 1) (Minstrel 1962, sold 1967), Miner II (ex-M2) (Gossamer 1949, sunk as target 1970), Miner III (ex-M 3) (BU 1977), Miner IV (ex-M 4) (BU 1964), Miner V (ex-M 5) (Britannic 1960, RAF target 1979), Miner VI (ex-M 6) (sold 1966), Miner VII (ex-M 7) (PAS Steady 1959), Miner VIII.\n\nDepot Ships\n\nThe Depot ships HMS Resource, Woolwich, Maistone, Forth, Tyne, Adamant, the aircraft transports Blackburn (to RNVR as drille ship, BU 1968), Ripon (BU 1959), Roc (Sold 1959), Seafox (sold 1958) and Walrus (renamed Skua 1953, sold 1962).\n\nNEW CONSTRUCTIONS\n\nHMS London, a County class missile destroyer, leading other ships of the type in 1971, src: IWM.\n\nThe major surface threat in the 1950s was seen as the Soviet Sverdlov class cruisers operating against Western trade. So seriously was this possibility taken that two new designs were drawn up to deal with it, a cruiser and a super-destroyer. The cruiser was intended to provide air-cover with guided missiles and relied on rapid-firing 6-in guns as its main armament, while a new rapid-firing single 5-in gun was designed for the destroyers.\n\nThe cruiser would have displaced 18,000t (standard) and would have carried Seaslug missiles aft and fully automatic 6-in guns forward. The destroyer, on the other hand, relied on three 5in guns for air defence, and when the project was finally dropped as it was because it had no missile defence. The gun derived from the British Army’s land-mobile 5-in, reached an advanced design stage, but was stopped when the Ordnance Board recommended an end to ‘gunnery solutions to AA defence’ in 1958.\n\nAll that remained of this interesting design was the advanced steam machinery which was developed for the fast escort, stopped, and then cut down and married with the gas turbines for the County class missile destroyers, the larger fleet escort for which the Board opted, after much thought. The first two were ordered in 1955, followed by two further units in 1957. The more urgent need of frigates had meant that the first six Type 12 ships, intended as prototypes, had been ordered in 1951, followed by another twelve of slightly modified design in 1954.\n\nThese frigates were intended to be cheap, but this proved to be a vain hope. They were, however, a great success and are still widely regarded as one of the finest escort designs of the period in any navy. In 1952-55 a dozen cheaper, ‘utility’ Type 14 ships were laid down to supplement the Type 12s, and a simpler destroyer conversion, the Type 16, was put in hand.\n\nTwo other new classes of frigates were ordered in 1951, a standard diesel-engined hull in two variants, one for anti-aircraft defence and the other for aircraft-direction. It had been intended to make up numbers in both categories with more conversions of destroyers, but these plans were shelved when a change of heart by the Staff indicated that it would be possible to go back to building general-purpose warships. This change of policy was influenced by new trends in technology, with more compact machinery and electronics on the way.\n\nDespite cutbacks and delays, however, the Korean War building programme had created an impressive escort force. By the end of 1958, twenty-four new frigates had been completed and thirty-four destroyers had been converted; in addition, twenty-one C class destroyers had received varying degrees of modernisation to improve their escort capability, and many of the slower “Loch” class had been rearmed.\n\nThe other area in which the Royal Navy invested heavily was mine warfare. Having suffered considerable casualties from the mining of harbours and estuaries, the British were understandably more sensitive about this than the Americans (who in any case had much deeper coastal waters) and when it was learned during the Korean War that Russian magnetic mines were proving immune to degaussing measures it was realised that a large number of new minesweepers were needed to replace the steel-hulled Algerines.\n\nBetween 1950 and 1960 some one hundred and twenty coastal minesweepers were built, concurrently with one hundred inshore types. The CMS design proved an outstanding success, robust and sufficiently seaworthy to detect and classify mines on the seabed so that they could be destroyed by a demolition charge. When this equipment was fitted, it perfected a number of coastal minesweepers as minehunters and over the years the new techniques replaced traditional sweeping as the major method to hunt mines in coastal waters.\n\nBritish SUBMARINES of the cold war\n\nCutaway of the HMS Resolution (S22). Nuclear deterrence soon imposed domestic SSBNs, active by 1967.\n\nBy 1945 the Royal Navy had built up a formidable submarine fleet and there was no intention of frittering away such asset -Apart from the possibility of offensive use in wartime- the part of submarines was ruled to be essential in training ASW forces, and great attention was paid to German late technology with prolongated tests done with some Type XXI U-boats and Meteor propulsion system. It was decided to build two experimental hydrogen peroxide turbine propulsion systems and to modermize welded boats of the “T” class along the lines of the “M” class submarines with enlarged batteries and streamlined hulls.\n\nThe two peroxide boats proved expensive, but the experience gained was incorporated in a new design of diesel, the Porpoise class. This hull form was very successful and in the improved Oberon class, one of the major conventional designs of the period. What’s more, propulsion was enhanced by the successful adaptation of nuclear power which gave virtually unlimited thermal power without a large energy source. When USS Nautilus proved such a triumph in the US Navy, the RN immediately decided to switch to nuclear power, although the intention to “go nuclear” was there even if peroxide boats were built, and work on a prototype in Scotland, did not started until 1957, and fell so far that the Admiralty decided to buy a US reactor from the T-class and to put the Dounreay type classes.\n\nHMS Oberon – This class one the last conventional Britisn attack submarine to enter service (1961)\n\nSince then a fourth and a fifth class has bee making the RN one of only five navies operating nuclear-powered subs. For some years it was believed that no mere “submersibles” would be built, but the cost of nuclear boats and manning them forced the resurgence of a conventional design, the 2400t SSK announced in 1979. These carried a similar armament but entered service in the early 1990s. In 1963 the momentous decision was make responsibility for the British nuclear deterrent from the RN, in the form of Polaris underwater-launched vectors: Submarines were ordered in 1963-64, but the Government cancelled the fifth boat in February in appeasement to its left wing. The entire project, and training of the crews, building four submarines and providing dedicated facilities, was carried through with great rapidity, one of the few major British defence projects to keep budgetary limits but become operational on time.\n\nIn July 1980 it was announced that four new new SSBNs, armed with Trident II missiles would be built. These would had a 6000 miles range, well outside the range of Soviet SBAs and would have eight independently launched missiles each carrying three warheads. Major components of the missile system came from the United States, but many sub-systems were made by British subcontractors, as the missiles themselves.\n\nA NEW GENERATION OF WARSHIPS\n\nAlthough the “electronic” components aged rapidly since 1940, during the 1950s the tendency was beginning to slow down to some extent in size of individual items of electronic equipments, assuming that the previous policy of building these could be discarded. The unsophisticated Tribal kit was now possible to build a general-purpose ftee destroyer. In 1960 the decision was made to build frigates to a totally recast design. The new hull now made possible to include a new generation of surveillance radars, combining a high-level awareness with a good measure of air warning.\n\nHMS Ark Royal as modernized;\n\n1966 and the end of the fleet air arm\n\nThe cancellation of the new aircraft carriers in 1966 was a traumatic experience for the Royal Navy, involving the resignation of the First sea lord, and loss of a chief striking force. The carrier Victorious hit was fire damage was the first to be reformed, followed later by HMS Eagle, and the naval air strike was from then handed over to the RAF. This crisis only showed inter-services rivalry flaring up, the RAF apparently succeeding in convincing the Secretary of State for Defence that carriers werevulnerable to strikes from land-based inter-continental ballistic missiles.\n\nThe Navy kept helicopters, but was to hand over its Buccaneer and Phantom aircraft to the RAF, with a contingent of RAF mixed aircrew with the surviving carrier’s air group. RAF squadrons took over the mission of protecting the fleet at sea, but this soon as predicted by many, proved unworkable. The RAF indeed was already overstretched in providing for the air defence of the United Kingdom airspace and in the even case planes dedicated to the fleet were serviceable, a few minutes delay in takeoff meant that they would arrive on the scene too late. But even after both services realised this could not continue, the politicians clung to their ruling there could never be any more aircraft carriers and at least not operated the kind of ships operating fixed-wings aircraft comparable to those in the US Navy as costs would have been crippling.\n\nHMS Invincible in 1991\n\n1967 compromises and the sea harrier\n\nThe answer would have to be found elsewhere. In 1967 serious thought was given to a “command cruiser” operating six large helicopters, similar to the French Jeanne d’Arc. Further studies showed greater efficiency would be obtained with nine rotary-wing aircraft stored in an internal hangar, with a starboard island and clear flight deck. A ‘through-deck cruiser’ as coined by the politicians, and soon the existence of the Harrier VSTOL naval version further complicated decision-making. It was decided ultimately to make sure that the design of the ship would accommodate the Sea Harrier if required. However this became a purely political struggle and the Sea Harrier was not considered before May 1975, more than two years after the ship had been laid down. In 1980 the first two squadrons were formed, giving the RN control over its own air power once more, and the debate now revolved around the aircraft type to replace one day the Sea Harrier.\n\nDefault in the cuirass: About the GIUK\n\nIn the mid-1970s the growing strength of the Soviet Navy in nuclear submarines was focusing attention on the so-called GIUK, the Greeland-Iceland-UK Gap. This “choke point”, through which subs of the Northern Fleet must pass through to attack targets in the North Atlantic had already been “bugged” with networks of passive sensors laid on the seabed to track their passage. Known as SOSUS (Sound Surveillance System), system needed massive, weatherly anti-submarine ships to patrol the area and strike targets defined by the SOSUS arrays. The US Navy defined the large Spruance class destroyers, but the RN opted for 4000 tons frigates armed with two helicopters, surface missiles and a new point-defence missile capable of defending against other missiles, and elaborated C5I.\n\nSOSUS and the GIUK gap\n\nLate 1970s modernization costs overruns\n\nThe new missile had originally been conceived as an anti-aircraft weapons, but during development they were tailored to answer underwater-launched missiles and sea-skimmers. For years it was the only anti-missile missile system in service, but time was running out for the RN with the cost of new warships rising beyond control, linked to the need of protecting them against anti-ship missiles. Studies showed that a double-ended Sea Dart destroyer was to be over 8000 tons, with the cost of hundreds of millions of pounds. To make matters worse, the Royal Dockyards half-life refits costs became exorbitant with £70m to upgrade a Leander class frigate and £64m for a “County” class DLG in 1981.\n\n1980s budget cuts\n\nIn 1981 the axe fell when the new Secretary of State John Nott, announced that the surface fleet would be reduced, with one of the three support carriers laid up or sold, no more than fifty ships overall and no more half-life modernizations approved. The Type 22 programme was replaced by a new economical utility escort known as Type 23. However to compensate, the nuclear hunter-killer programme was accelerated, and Type 2400 DE subs confirmed. HMS Bulwark was paid off, followed by Hermes (scheduled so) and HMS Invincible was “on offer” to the Australian Navy. In addition two DLGs and two Leander class frigates had been sold. Older frigates and some Leanders were also to be sold. And at that time the events on the south atlantic erupted.\n\nTHE FALKLAND’S CAMPAIGN (1982)\n\nNote: This will be the object of a comprehensive post, possibly in 2022, for the 40th anniversary.\n\nWhen Argentine forces occupied the Falkland Islands and South Georgia on 2 April 1982, the British Government immediately dispatched a task force to recapture the islands. Although the assembling and equipping of such a force around the carriers Hermes (flagship) and Invincible was a masterpiece of speed and efficiency (the carriers and several warships sailed and 5000 tons of military stores were loaded, all within seventy-two hours of the order to embark), the fighting around the Falklands showed that the Royal Navy was no longer adequately equipped for such operations. The fact that the Falklands are 8000 miles from Britain and that the nearest base was Ascension caused particular strain, but air attacks by Argentine shore-based aircraft showed that a small air group of fewer than thirty Sea Harriers was no substitute for a large carrier with high-performance aircraft.\n\nThe first blow came on 4 May, when the DDG Sheffield was hit by an air-launched Exocet missile from a Super Etendard strike aircraft. The missile failed to detonate, but it set the fuel tanks on fire and the ship had to be abandoned some hours later. She was taken in tow because the navy hoped to have the damage examined by experts at South Georgia, but when the weather deteriorated on 10 May the bumed-out hulk was scuttled. The strike against the Task Force was undoubtedly provoked by the loss of the old cruiser General Belgrano, which was torpedoed by the nuclear submarine Conqueror on 2 May. According to later claims by the British Government, Belgrano and her Exocet-armed destroyers were the southernmost element of a three-pronged attack on the Task Force, and the submarine’s CO was given permission to attack any hostile targets. Surprisingly the elderly Mk 8 torpedo was used, at a range of about 3000yds, rather than the long-range Mk 24.\n\nOnce the amphibious assault had got under way at San Carlos on 21 May, fierce air battles became an almost daily occurrence, and bombing or rocket attacks accounted for the DDG Coventry and the frigates Ardent and Antelope. The Navy found that the lack of airborne early warning aircraft made the Sea Harriers’ task much harder, and the older radars, 965 and 992Q, had great difficulty in tracking fast,1 low-flying air targets. The need for stronger close-range defence led to the use of troops and their GPMGs to provide AA fire, and ships still in the UK were hurriedly rearmed with twin 30mm and single 20mm guns, as well as additional chaff-launchers to give protection against guided missiles. The Vulcan Phalanx 20mm ‘Gading’ was acquired from the United States and two were put on the flight deck of the new carrier Illustrious.\n\nA large number of merchant ships were chartered or requisitioned, including the luxury liners Canberra and Queen Elizabeth 2, with helicopter platforms, naval-standard communications and, in some cases, 20mm guns, added. The most elaborate conversions were the ro-ro container ships Atlantic Conveyor and Atlantic Causeway. The former took RAF Harriers to the South Atlantic and then acted as a ‘spare deck’ for aircraft and helicopters in San Carlos Water, while the latter was given a hangar and four anti-submarine Sea King helicopters. Atlantic Conveyor’s loss to an Exocet attack was a major setback to the timetable of Operation ‘Corporate’ for she carried a portable air-strip and refuelling equipment.\n\nHMS Sheffield\n\nGround-support aircraft were allowed to operate away from the carriers. Although the land forces got safely ashore, the Navy’s presence remained vital throughout, to move supplies and to provide cover against Argentine air strikes. A rash attempt by 5 Brigade to move without Sea Harrier cover led to the crippling of the LSLs Sir Galahad and Sir Tristram at Fitzroy, arguably the worst moment of an otherwise brilliant campaign in which numerically inferior forces had repeatedly out-thought and out-fought the opposition.\n\nTwo days before the surrender on 24 June, the DLG Glamorgan was hit by a land-launched Exocet missile, which wrecked her hangar and killed fifteen men, but by a near-miracle she escaped serious damage. The missile was detected on radar and correctly identified, giving her a vital seventy seconds to turn away and try to get out of range. As the Exocet was nearly out of fuel it did not strike with full force, and it seems that the warhead may have detonated only partially.\n\nRoyal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Invincible during the International Fleet Review which was part of Trafalgar 200.\n\nThe Royal Navy post-1982\n\nAlthough the Falklands campaign halted the rundown temporarily, the 1981 cuts were merely postponed. The collapse of the Warsaw Pact in the late 1980s provided the Treasury with a strong case for reducing defense expenditure even faster. The ‘Options for Change’ policy review in 1990-91 reaffirmed the need for amphibious ships but the commitment made in the mid-1980s to maintain ‘about fifty’ escorts soon shrank to ‘about forty’, and older frigates were retired or sold off rapidly. A major casualty was the planned new nuclear attack submarine design, but the Trident programme remained sacrosanct.\n\nHMS Sheffield\n\nThe End of the Cold War (1980-90)\n\nThe Falkkands campaign had the advantage of stopping at least momentarily the budget cuts, but the rapid collapse of the Warsaw pact in later years provided ammunition to the treasury for further axe blows. In the mid-1980s however a commitment was held on to keep “about fifty” escorts and later “about forty” while older Frigates were retired. The “Option for Changes” of 1990 reaffirmed the need for a strong amphibious class, but the strongest blow fell on the new nuclear attack submarine program. The only component left unscaved was the sacro-sanct Trident program and its host four ballistic submarines.\n\nThe Navy found a solution to maintain ship by cutting through personal and automation. The Type 23 program ships were inded intended to be much more automated. On the other hand, UK retired from the NFR-90 European Frigate program in 1989. By late 1991 however intention to join the join French-Italian program for a common new AA Frigate. In 1991 also, the “Front Line First” review added more cuts, but it also forced the Navy to rethink its commitment as a rapid reaction force, well integrated into NATO but taking in account both the Falkland campaing and Gulf war in a post-cold war environment.\n\nTwo defence reviews in the early 1990s, ‘Options for Change’ and ‘Front Line First’ imposed severe financial cuts on the RN. Although a reduction in numbers was inevitable, the Navy evolved a credible alternative to the cold war/northwest European strategy which had been in place for 20 years. Profiting by experience in the Falklands and in the Gulf in 1990-91, the Navy offered a limited out-of-area capability to deal with sudden crisis, and to support United Nations’ peace-keeping operations. The result was renewed emphasis on amphibious warfare, and a reduction of the anti-submarine role in NATO’s Eastern Atlantic theatre.\n\nBritish mine warfare policy\n\nThe Soviet Navy’s interest and expertise in mine warfare showed no sign of decreasing in the 1970s, and the replacements designed for the RN’s ageing coastal minesweepers proved to be, ton for ton, among the most complex and expensive warships ever built. To reduce their magnetic signature virtually to nil, it was necessary to design nonmagnetic diesels and build the hull of glass-reinforced plastic (GRP). GRP is expensive and difficult to fabricate on such a large scale, and the Brecon class are currently the world’s largest ships built of this material. They are known as Mine Counter Measures Vessels (MCMVs) because they can accommodate both hunting and sweeping functions in one hull.\n\nSince 1982 MCM forces have been in action four times, including the clearance of Port Stanley, hunting for Libyan mines in the Gulf of Suez, dealing with Iranian mines in 1987, and finally, supporting the Coalition forces in the 1991 Gulf conflict. Five ‘Hunt’ class performed outstanding service in dealing with Iraqi mines laid off Kuwait City. As with larger warships, the government commitment to maintain a force of fifty modern MCM craft has not been honored. The thirteen ‘Hunts’ had been supplemented by twelve ‘River’ class MSFs and five Sandown class SRMHs, but by 1995 the force of ‘Tons’ had disappeared and there was no further role for the ‘Rivers’.\n\nCOMMONWEALTH NAVIES\n\nHMAS Melbourne at San Diego in 1977\n\nThe disappearance of the Empire weakened the links which bound the navies of Canada and Australia to that of Great Britain, and there was a steady drift away from a reliance on British equipment. The RCN was the first, purchasing USN weapons and electronics to make it easier to get spares in an emergency, and going as far as to design its own escort destroyers. The RAN, on the other hand, continued to build RN designs in its own shipyards for some years.\n\nIkara anti-submarine missile system and other e jointly developed. While South Africa Commonwealth the SAN relied totally on Brin. 1961 political pressure to prevent them fr equipment forced the South Africans to turn to the ‘New Commonwealth’ navies, principally fitted the traditional mold for a longer period indigenous resources, but Pakistan turned in to help and India to the Soviet Union. India’s policy of building up local resources to a point at could be expanded and even equipped with Sen.\n\nWEAPONRY\n\nThe Royal Navy continued its policy of demanding high standards in its weapons and equipment, but the underlying which had become particularly evident after this 1948 largely frustrated this. Lack of money to buy equipment led to endless delays, some imposed by the navy’s bureaucratic machinery and others by the Treasury. In the end the result was always the same: Equipment placed into service far too late, making these obsolescent when operational. Other problems were caused by the temptation to allow too many committees to make alterations to specifications.\n\nSea Dart missile system onboard HMS Invincible\n\nThus, the Seaslug missile was made extraordinarily bulky on the advice of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (Farnborough), not believing reports that the American Terrier missile had its boosters mounted in tandem. For political reasons its is almost impossible to purchase foreign equipment, but when it is bought the immediate temptation has been to “Anglicise” it; This happened with the American Mk 56 fire control system, winch painful development re-emerged as the MRS3.\n\nThe beam-riding Seaslug gave way eventually to the much more effective semi-active homer Sea Dart, which followed the American ideas closely, and this weapon is currently being upgraded. The experience with lighter missiles has been happier, for the short range Seacat was designed to replace the venerable 40mm Bofors gun, and by being tailored specifically to one role it emerged as a relatively cost-effective close-range defence system for ships down to frigates.\n\nArmstrong-Withworth system Sea Slug AA missile system (1961)\n\nReplacement was to have been Sea Wolf, but the lengthy and costly, lengthy development enabled the designers to give it a capability against sea-skimming missiles. The system was further developed into a vertical launch (VL) system for the Type 23 frigates and AORs. A lighter type 911 tracker was produced, and the missile’s range has been increased from 10,000m to 14,000m. The problem for the RN is that it has shrunk in size without losing its front-line commitments, and as a result its production runs are short. This pushes up cost and explains why so many good ideas have to had to depend on export orders before they can go ahdea. It was hoped to persuade the Netherlands to buy Sea Dart in exhange for a Signaal 3-D radar, and the Type 22 frigate was also begun as a joint venture with the Dutch.\n\nSince 1947 British torpedoes have earner poor reputation, most of it undeserved. Although the Mk8 submarines torpedo was by far the most efficient and cost-effective model used in WW2, it was hoped to replace it with faster and more accurate models using British wartime developments as well as German design ideas in 1945. The most promising was High-Test Peroxide (HTP), and this was used to drive high-speed fancy or 21in Mk 12. This weapon had to be withdrawn after a propellant causes and explosion which sank the submarine Sidon in 1955, but it was further developed by the Swedish Navy into the Tp61, a very safe and effective torpedo.\n\nSeveral torpedoes were designed and then axed for some reasons, notably the Pentane and theMk30 Mod 1. The desperate need of a lightweight homing torpedo for helicopters, aircraft and frigates led to the purchase of American Mk 43, 44 and 46 models, but the Mk 43 became obsolete many years ago and the other two have been replaced by the Stingray.\n\nDespite many problems, the Mk 24 Tigerfish came into service in 1970, being followed in the 1990’S by the new heavy Spearfish. The cancellation of the Undersea Guided Weapon programme force the navy to buy the USNs Sub-Harpoon to give its nuclear submarines a capability in long-range anti-ship means. Trials started in October 1981. This purchase was followed by the selection of the latest surface version, the RGM-84C, as the successor to the Exocet. The Netherlands 30mm CIWS Goalkeeper, a Gatling system was bought in exchange for the sale of Marine Sprey gas turbines to the RNIN. The experience of 1982 also led to increased expenditures on electronic warfare, and in 1991 the RN’s performances in the Gulf conflict proved that the money was well spent.\n\nThe Royal Navy Today (1995-2020)\n\nAfter post-cold war massive (but previsible and necessary) budget cuts, the RN concentrated around its carriers and new destroyers programs, while modernizeing its SSN and SSBN fleet to keep the edge. The Royal Navy maintains as of today a technologically sophisticated, very well trained and maintained fleet, which includes one aircraft carrier (still without planes), two amphibious transport docks, four ballistic missile submarines (nuclear deterrent component), six nuclear fleet submarines, six guided missile destroyers, thirteen frigates and the same number of mine-countermeasure vessels plus 22 patrol vessels.\n\nBy the fall of 2018, two years from now, 75 registered commissioned ships composed. Additionally 13 ships serve with the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) and five Merchant Navy ships available under private finance initiative to replenishes the fleet at sea and amphibious forces when operating far from home. They also doubled that by taking on patrol duties, freeing frigates for other tasks. This came with a total tonnage of about 408,750 tonnes, for the strke fleet alone, and 743,759 tonnes including the Royal Fleet Auxiliary and Royal Marines. It is backed by 174 aircraft and helicopters, notably long range AAW patrol planes. This force is manned by 33,280 Regulars, 3,040 in the Maritime Reserve and and 7,960 in the Royal Fleet Reserve, all mobilizable in case of war.\n\nPlanification for 2020-2030 includes:\n\n-Completion and commission of the Prince of Wales, second of the QE class carriers.\n\n-Tree of seven Astute-class submarines\n\n-First of four Dreadnought-class ballistic missile submarines\n\n-First two of of eight Type 26 frigates/City class of 6900 tonnes.\n\n-Ninth and last ocean-going River class patrol vessel.\n\n-Program in early development and design work: Five planned Type 31 frigates of 5,700 tonnes.\n\nAlso development of small unmanned vessels for spec ops, such as the MAST-13, is ongoing for testng and development of the concept.\n\nCurrent “fleet air arm”:\n\nThe Fleet air arm is composed of the following:\n\n-About 24 (Total 48) Agusta Westland AW159 Wildcat (2009) multipurpose helicopters\n\n-About 40? AW101 Merlin helicopters\n\n-9 BAE Systems Nimrod MRA4 long range patrol planes\n\n-About 15 transport Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin helicopters\n\n-UCAAVs such as the rail-launched ScanEagle.\n\n-Tutor and Hawk training planes (basic/advanced)\n\nAlso:\n\n-In operational reserve since 2006: Sea Harrier GR7/GR9.\n\n-To be retired: Sea King ASaC7.

One was so delayed that she eventually formed a separate type, but the other three, redesigned to incorporate as many wartime lessons as possible, were launched in 1947-48 and completed in somewhat leisurely fashion six years later. Almost as soon as the vessels were completed they were taken in hand for modification. An ‘interim’ or 5 degrees angled deck was added and this necessitated the removal of three twin Bofors guns from the port side. After the Suez operations in 1956 the ships were given steam catapults and stronger arrester wires, and the six-barrelled Mk 6 Bofors mounting abaft the island was removed to provide deck space.\n\nThey proved too small to operate the new generation of aircraft coming into service in the late 1950s, and in 1959-60 Bulwark was converted to a commando carrier. This involved the removal of her arrester gear and catapults, the provision of four assault landing craft (LCAS) in davits aft and the modification of her accommodation to allow 733 Royal Marines to embark. With eight helicopters in place of her former air group, she could land troops and vehicles ashore rapidly, and proved such a success that her sister Albion was similarly converted in 1961-62. Albion’s conversion was slightly more elaborate, and allowed her to embark 900 commandos. Plans to convert Centaur, however, were shelved because of rising costs, and she was paid off into reserve in 1966, to be scrapped six years later. The air groups varied during their careers. At Suez, for example, Albion was flying Sea Venom and Sea Hawk fighters, Skyrider AEW aircraft and Sycamore helicopters. At the end of her career Centaur carried four Gannet AEW aircraft and eight Whirlwind helicopters.\n\nStern of HMS Centaur underway to Ceylon\n\nSpecifications (After conversion)\n\nDisplacement: 22,00/27,00 tonnes FL\n\nDimensions: 224.8 x 37,5 m x 8.2 m\n\nPowerplant: 2 shaft Parsons GST, 4 3-drum adm.

During the process the hull was widened, deepened and lengthened and the machinery and boilers replaced, although it was only decided in 1955 to replace the boilers. Two steam catapults, an angled deck and mirror landing sights were provided, as well as a 3-D radar and faster lifts. The major item of the reconstruction was the provision of a massive sponson on the port side for the 8%4 degrees angled deck. This extended the flight deck 35ft 6in outboard and was the first fully angled deck fitted in a British carrier. The new island was rapid growth in size of the latter meant that she never carried more and the Mk 6 Bofors were removed former armamnent was completely replaced by six twin 3in/50 Mk 33 automatic gun mountings purchased from the US Navy, mounted one on each side forward and two on each to compensate for the weight added.\n\nDuring the 1962-63 refit the flight deck was strengthened and an access gangway was provided outboard of the island. The ‘flyco’ on the inboard side of the island was extended and enlarged and the mirror sights were replaced by projector sights. When she recommissioned on 14 January 1958, Victorious was the most modern British carrier, but although it had originally been hoped that she would operate fifty-four aircraft, the than twenty-eight (plus eight helicopters) and finally carried only twenty-three (eight Buccaneers, eight Sea Vixens, two Wessex). In 1968 she suffered a minor fire while refitting, and as the decision had already been taken to run down the carrier force she was summarily put on the disposal list and sold for scrapping the following surmounted by a huge ‘searchlight’ array for the Type 984 3-D radar, the first to go to sea.\n\nTwo parallel-track 145ft steam catapults were provided and because of the angled deck there were only four arrester wires, cach with an average span of 80ft. A major internal improvement was to nearly double the generating capacity to 4200kW, but even this had to be increased to 5000kW in 1962-63. The side aft. In addition one six-barrelled 40mm Mk 6 automatic mounting was positioned on the starboard side between thc boạt crane and the after 3in guns. Each gun mounting was controlled by its own CRBF (Close Range Blind Fire) director positioned alongside. During a May 1962-August 1963 refit two 3in mountings Gannets and fire enlarged and the mirror sights were replaced by projector sights. When she recommissioned on 14 January 1958, Victorious was the most modern British carrier, but although it had originally been hoped that she would operate fifty-four aircraft, the summarily put on the disposal list and sold for scrapping the following year.\n\nHMS Victorious (R38) after reconstruction and modernization. Author’s profile for the future poster.\n\nSpecifications (After conversion)\n\nDisplacement: 30,530/35,500 tonnes FL\n\nDimensions: 225.5/238m x 31,5/47.8 m x 9.5 m\n\nPowerplant: 3 shaft Parsons GST, 6 Fosters Wheeler Boilers 110,000 shp 31 knots\n\nArmament: 12x 3-in/50 Mk33, 6x 40mm Mk6 AA, 36 aircrafts as modernized\n\nElectronics: Radar 984, 974 193Q\n\nCrew: 2400\n\nAircraft Carrier HMS Eagle (1946)\n\nOriginally intended to form one of a class of four 32,500t improved Implacables, Audacious was quite far advanced at the end of the war and was therefore earmarked for completion more or less as designed. Her name as changed to Eagle in January 1946 because the original Eagle had just been cancelled. Her surviving sister det Royal, however, was held up to allow numerous improvements to be incorporated, and so the two ships differed in many details. A new legend was drawn up in 1946 for both ships, raising 36,970t (standard), 45,720t (deep).\n\nEagle’s design followed closely the pattern of the wartime armoured carriers, with eight twin 4.5in DP gun mountings in quadrantal sponsons, but the close-range armament was the most modern available. Eight six-barrelled 40mm Bofors Mk 6, each with its own CRBF fire control director, were mounted, four on the port side, two on the starboard side and one at each end of the island. In addition there were nine single 40mm Mk 7 on the island and on the port side, and before completion two twin 40mm Mk 5 were added in a sponson under the overhang of the flight deck at the stern. Original first refit provision of radars comprised the models 960, 982, 983, 275, 262, 974. Also in 1951 she was armed with sixteen 4.5 in/45 Mk6, forty-eight 40mm/60 Mk6 AA, four 40mm/60 Mk5 AA, 9x 40mm/60 Mk7 AA, and had a total of 60 aircraft, of course piston-engine at that time still, but the first few jets such as the De Havilland Venom.\n\nSee also: https://youtu.be/epS1HRZpDyY\n\nThis gave the phenomenal total of twelve radar directors controlling 16 4.5in and 48-40mm barrels, with a further 13-40mm barrels control. As the only large modern carrier, Eagle was a major addition to the RN’s strength when she started her builder’s trials in October 1951. On trials she made 30.53kts at 44,250t 156,630shp and 29,6kts at deep load (49,950t). Endurance was calculated at 4500nm at 24kts. She took part in her first major operation, the NATO exercise ‘Mainbrace’, at the end of 1952.\n\nFrom June 1954 to February 1955 she was under refit, emerging with a 5° angled deck and the new mirror landing sight. Apart from realignment of the arrester wires and other flight deck fittings, the change necessitated the removal of one Mk 6 Bofors mounting from the port side; the three single Mk 7s were also removed from the port side of the island. On 1 November 1956 Eagle’s Sea Hawks, Wyverns and Sea Venoms began six days of attacks on Egyptian airfields and positions during the Anglo-French attempt to seize the Suez Canal.\n\nBuccaneer landing on the Eagle in 1971\n\nThe air group flew 621 sorties despite having a defective catapult. On her return to Devonport she had a short refit and then returned to the Mediterranean, where she spent most of the remainder of the commission. From mid-1959 to May 1964 she underwent complete rebuilding at Devonport to bring her up to the standard of Victorious: a fully (8°) angled deck, steam catapults and the long-range 3-D air warning Type 984 rader were fitted. The opportunity was taken to renew her boiler fire-bricks, for these had given constant trouble since completion. In addition, Confrontation by maintaining stand-ing air patrols over the Malacca Strait. No sooner was this crisis over than she sailed for Aden to provide reinforcements and then had to provide air defence for Zambia against possible invasion from Rhodesia. The ‘Beira Patrol’, a blockade to prevent oil from reaching Rhodesia, involved the identification of more than seven hundred ships and the covering of 200,000 square miles of sea each day, and it kept Eagle at sea for seventy-one days.\n\nAs rebuilt in 1959-1964 she was given a short lattice foremast carrying “double bedstead’ surveillance radar, a Type 965 (AKE-2) and the forward 4.5in sponsons were removed to increase internal accommodation. The close-range armament was entirely replaced by six quadruple Seacat GWS22 SAM systems, four sponsoned port and starboard forward and aft, one right aft under the flight deck overhang and one on the starboard side between the island and the after sponson. A less obvious but important improvement was to boost the generating capacity to 8250kW, nearly double the original power, while flight deck armour was reduced from 4-in to l-in.\n\nWith the growing size and complexity of aircraft, and as the after half of the lower hangar was now given over to workshops, the complement dropped to thirty-five fixed-wing aircraft and ten helicopters, half the complement envisaged in 1942. In 1954 she had operated fifty-nine aircraft, Avengers, AEW Skyraiders and a Dragon-fly helicopter; ten years later she had Sea Vixens, Scimitars and Gannets.\n\nFairey Gannet over the Eagle in the 1960s\n\nIn 1964 the ship sailed for the Far East to help contain the Indonesian axe the RN’s carriers, on the flimsy pretext that she would cost too much to convert to operate Phantoms; in fact she had already operated Phantoms and needed only minor modifications her flight deck 01 equipment. She was paid off at Portsmouth in January 1972 and was laid up at Devonport later the same year. Although Eagle was officially in fully including Sea Hawks, maintained reserve, the difficulty of keeping Ark Royal running meant that she was progressively ‘cannibalised’, and she was finally towed away to the breakers in 1978.\n\nHMS Eagle in the Mediterranean January 1970\n\nSpecifications (1964)\n\nDisplacement: 45,000 – 53390 tonnes FL\n\nDimensions: 219,5/247.4 m x 34.3/52.1 m oa, 11 m\n\nPowerplant: 4 shafts Geared Turbines, 8 adm. 3 drum boilers, 152,000 shp 31 knots\n\nArmament: 4×2 4.5-in, 6×4 Seacat GWS22 SAM, 45 aircraft\n\nElectronics: Radar 984, 963, 965 (AKE-2)\n\nComplement: 2750 with air group\n\nAircraft Carrier HMS Ark Royal (1950)\n\nHMS Ark Royal North Atlantic July 1976\n\nAlthough often claimed to have been projected as HMS Imresistible, there is no official record of this name. The ship was in fact laid down 18 months after the previous Ark Royal was sunk, and there was every reason to reserve that name for a new carrier. She was not very far advanced at the end of the war and so the opportunity was taken to change the design considerably, but this made her completion more and more protracted, until she became the butt of comedians’ jokes. She finally started trials in June 1954 and entered service in February 1955.\n\nThe most important alteration was to provide her with a deck-edge lift, as in US carriers. It was never a great success because it served the upper hangar only, and in any case the device was not really suited to the British type of closed hangar. The port forward 4.5in guns were never installed because the ship went to sea with a 5° angled deck, and this also meant a smaller number of 40 mm guns on the port side, as in Eagle. She had a tall lattice foremast, and a different island. Her initial armament in 1955 comprised twelve 4.5 in Mk6 DP guns, thirty-six 40 mm Mk5 AA, six Mk7 AA and 50 aircrafts.\n\nAs with Eagle it proved difficult to accommodate two 210ft steam catapults on the foredeck, and so when these were installed in 1967-70 an unusual deposition was adopted, with one on the port side forward and the other in the waist. Ark Royal underwent many more changes than Eagle. In 1956 the starboard 4.5in turrets were also removed, followed by the forward pairs (port and starboard) of the after group in 1964 and the rest in 1969.\n\nDuring the 1959 refit the side lift was removed to allow the hangar to be enlarged, and in 1961 a deck-landing projector sight was installed, with the “Hilo’ long-range guidance system and stronger steatween March 1967 and February 1970 she underwent a major refit to allow the operation of Phantom F-4K interceptors and Buccaneer S2 strike aircraft. This involved removing the last of the 40mm guns; it was planned to replace them with four Seacat missile systems, but these were never installed. New armament comprised eight 4.5 in, tenwty-eight 40 mm AA and 48 aircraft. Electronics suite comprised the radars 960, 982, 983, 275 and 974.\n\nThe radar outfit always differed from Eagle’s. As built, Ark Royal had two Type 982 ‘hayrake’ scanners and two Type 983 height-finders, with Type 262 fitted to the directors controlling the 40mm guns, and Type 275 controlling the 4.5in. In 1959 a catapults. Be-‘double bedstead’ Type 965M aerial was stepped on a short lattice mast forward of the mainmast; in 1967-70 a second 965M was added on a much taller lattice mainmast, and a large dome abaft the island, housing a Carrier Controlled Approach (CCA) radar of US origin, was fitted. Although completed later than Eagle, the ‘Ark’ was never as mechanically reliable, and had the 1966 Defence Review not cancelled her replacement (CVA-02) she would have been scrapped first.\n\nIn 1966 it was felt that she might last until 1972 without major repairs to her machinery, and the fact that she staggered on for another six years is testimony to the heroic efforts of her engineers. Although hard-worked she missed all the important actions except the Indonesian Confrontation, and had it not been for a thirteen-week TV serial called ‘Sailor’ she might never have endeared herself to the public in the way that she did. Despite efforts to raise money to preserve her the MoD steadfastly refused to sanction any unworthy scheme; in any case the sums talked of were wildly unrealistic, and she was towed away in the autumn of 1980. After she had been paid off at Devonport in December 1978 her name was given to the third of the Invincible class.\n\nConway’s profile of the Ark Royal as of 1977\n\nSpecifications (1969)\n\nDisplacement: 43,340/53,060 tonnes FL\n\nDimensions: As HMS Eagle but 50.1m (164ft 6in) deck overall width\n\nPowerplant: As Eagle\n\nArmour: As Eagle\n\nArmament: 4 GWS22 Seacat SAM*, 36 aircraft\n\nElectronics: Radar 965, SPN-35\n\nComplement: 2637\n\nAircraft Carrier HMS Hermes (1953)\n\nWhen the original order for Hermes, sixth of the Centaur class, was named was given to Elephant of the same class; very little work was done on the hull, however, giving time for the specification to be revised. Thus, while the three Centaur class went ahead with their ‘interim’ standard of equipment, Hermes was radically redesigned to include a 6° angled deck, celled in October 1945, the ou a side lift and a Type 984 3-D long range radar with Comprehensive Display System (CDS). Although the deck-edge lift was unusual in British carriers (the first was still being installed in Ark Royal) it was dictated by the need to find space for the steam catapults at the forward end of the flight deck. Once the forward centreline lift was suppressed the side lift was needed to work aircraft, and it also provided a convenient extension to the angled deck area.\n\nThe appearance of the ship was very different from that of her former sisters, with a massive ‘dustbin’ scanner for the Type 984 radar over the istand, The superstructure was considerably enlarged, but the armament was reduced to five twin 40 mm Bofors (two port, three starboard) controlled by MRS8 directors. In 1964-66 she was refitted and the Hermes Bofors were replaced by two quadruple Seacat close-range SAM defence systems, in the after port and starboard sponsons. Another improvement was the addition of the ‘Alaska highway’ outboard of the island. In 1971-73 the Type 984 scanner was dian Ocean and Far East she had to be withdrawn from front-line service because she could not operate the new F-4K Phantom, which had replaced the Sea Vixen.\n\nIn 1971 she paid off for conversion to a commando carrier, losing her arrester wires, catapults and 3-D radar. In 1977 she was rerated as an ASW cargap until completion of Ark Royal and served until 1984. Her last air group as an ASW carrier consisted of nine Sea Kings and four Wessex Mk5s, but at the end of 1980 she embarked five Sea Harriers and nine Sea King Mk 2s.
