Kimble)\n\nEARLY MEDITERRANEAN VIEWS ON THE NORTHLANDS\n\nCuriosity concerning the unknown is as old as men and as universal. In–\n\ndeed, it seems that three of the commonest words in any language are \"where?\"\n\n\"how,\" and \"why?\" The earliest dwellers in the valleys of Mesopotamia, follow–\n\ning a settled habit of life, could hardly refrain from asking where the floods\n\ncame from and what lay beyond the flanking hills. Thos of Minos would be no\n\nless concerned to discover where the sea began and why it was always in motion.\n\nThose of Troy would want to know where the Boreas acquired its force, and the\n\nsouth wind its moisture. The fact that correct answers to such questions could\n\nnot be given matters little. Many of their answers were indeed highly improb–\n\nable, for who had ever heard in Greece or Rome of four feet tall pigmies? Of\n\nfrozen seas and six month-long nights? Of single-breasted women who fought\n\nbetter than men? And how could there possibly be men with dogs' heads and others\n\nwith heads in their chests? What is more important is that the world, both in\n\nAntiquity and later times, has never lacked men who were prepared to seek out\n\nanswers, even though the search involved grievous hazards. It is to these men,\n\nmost of whom have left no memorial, that the beginnings of geographical thought\n\nbelong. —\n\nAnd not only geographical thought, either. For some of those who carried\n\ntheir quest into distant lands returned with new metals and precious stones, with\n\nanimal furs and cunningly wrought tools and weapons, the like of which no Medi–\n\nterranean-dweller had ever seen. On this wise was the first earth knowledge\n\n002 | Vol_XI-0109\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views on Northlands\n\nacquired.\n\nIt was, of course, a long time before such knowledge and theories were\n\nrationalized and made common to the whole community, and longer still before\n\nthey were communicated to other communities. \"Com\n\npage 2 of MS missing\n\n003 | Vol_XI-0110\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views on Northlands\n\nancient as any, can only be inferred with difficulty. We do know, however,\n\nthat in the third millennium B. C. there were Babylonian trading colonies in\n\nthe Taurus Mountains working copper and silver, and that Sargon (c. 2,500 B.C.)\n\nis supposed to have raided the islands of the \"upper sea\" or \"sunset sea,\" pre–\n\nsumably Cyprus and Crete, since the Persian Gulf is described as the \"lower sea.\"\n\nMetal vessels executed in the early Sumerian manner have been found as far north\n\nas the Caspian Sea, but it is dou tb bt ful whether we should, on that account,\n\nassume that the Caspian was known to the Sumerians of the third millennium.\n\nMuch later (6th century B.C.) a clay tablet map, said to be a copy of a more\n\nancient one, portrays a circumambient river, called the Bitter River, surround–\n\ning the Tigris-Euphrates valley. Some writers have read into this circle a\n\nknowledge of the Persian Gulf, Caspian, Black and Mediterranean seas, but it\n\nwould seem more logical to regard it simply as the expression of the known Baby–\n\nlonian belief in a water-girt earth. After all, what could have been more nat–\n\nural in a valley where the earth was annually inundated and where the dry land\n\nappeared as islands, slowly emerging from the spring floods? As the scholars\n\n004 | Vol_XI-0111\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views on Northlands\n\nof mediaeval Christendom later found, it is not impossible to reconcile the\n\nBiblical story of the Creation (which has striking affinities to the Babylon–\n\nian version) with belief in an ocean-girt earth.\n\nIt is now widely held that one of the most ancient summaries of world know–\n\nledge is, in fact, contained in the early chapters of Genesis . Chapter X is\n\nparticularly illuminating in this respect. From the list of genealogies given\n\nhere, it would appear that the world in, say, Abraham's time, was bounded on\n\nthe northwest by the Aegean (Dodanim being a corruption of Rodanim, i.e. Rhodes),\n\non the north by the Armenian Mountains (so A. H. Sayce interprets Ashkenaz) and\n\nthe Anatolian plateau including possibly the southern shores of the Black Sea\n\n(Gomer being identified with the land that appears in later Assyrian literature\n\nas Gimmira and in Herodotus as the land of the Cimmerians), and on the north–\n\neast by the mountains of Elam and Media.\n\nThe records of the early dynastic period of Egyptian civilization are\n\ncompletely silent even about land bordering the north shore of the Mediterranean,\n\nand although the argument from silence is sometimes risky, it cannot be dismissed\n\nwhen the silence lasts for a millennium or more. By the XVIII dynasty (c. 1,400\n\nB.C.), however, Asia Minor and Crete had been added to the Egyptian area of know–\n\nledge, thanks, in part no doubt, to the Hyksos who are believed to have origin–\n\nated in that part of the world. Before the second millennium B.C., Egyptian\n\nships were regularly doing the round trip to the \"Isles of the Very Green,\" to\n\n\"Keftui and the Isles,\" these presumably being the islands (including Crete) of\n\nthe Aegean which had been influenced by Minoan culture. Notwithstanding the\n\nnotable expansion of inter-regional commerce which took place about this time,\n\nthe geographical ideas of the Egyptians continued to be of the vaguest, as, for\n\ninstance, when they made the Euphrates rise in \"the marshes.\" Nor does it appear\n\n005 | Vol_XI-0112\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views on Northlands\n\nlikely that the ancient tradition associating Sesostris with the discovery of\n\nthe eastern end of the Black Sea has any basis in fact. Equally without founda–\n\ntion are other statements about eastern conquests by him or a Rameses as far as\n\nIndia. As for lands to the west of the Aegean, there is no written evidence\n\nthat the Egyptians sailed there or even that they had an inkling that their great\n\nsea was connected with an outer ocean. In their records the whole mass of main–\n\nland Europe is a blank, unless we suppose that some of the sea-raiders who harried\n\nthe coast of the Delta from time to time, came from there. Admittedly, we hear\n\nof such \"northern\" wares as amber, tin and furs reaching Egypt at an early date,\n\nbut this does not prove that there was direct trade between the source regions\n\nand the markets, or that the geographical horizons of the Egyptians were widen–\n\ning. It has ever been a habit of middlemen to conceal the source of their profits!\n\nThe Homeric Age\n\nWith the gradual northward migration of land-based and sea-based cultures\n\nin the latter half of the second millennium, it is to be supposed that the Hitt–\n\nites, the Minoans and their more ambitious contemporaries in the Aegean proper\n\nbegan to obtain an inkling of what lay to northward of them. But such of their\n\nrecords as have [ ?] so far been deciphered tell us remarkably little about any\n\nideas they may have had on this subject. If the Hittites did know of the exist–\n\nence of the Black Sea lands (and this is generally taken to be a reasonable assump–\n\ntion in view of the extent of their trading operations), they were thoughtless\n\nenough not to record the fact. The Myceneans and Achaeans waged military cam–\n\npaigns around the shores of the Bosphorus with tribes who were almost certainly\n\nof eastern European origin; however,by the time of Homer they were but a ghostly\n\nmemory.\n\n006 | Vol_XI-0113\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views on Northlands\n\nThe Iliad and the Odyssey are scarcely more revealing. The poet has heard\n\nof the mountains of Thrace whence blows the northern blast (= rhipeé ); beyond\n\nthem he locates, without indicating distance or direction, the Mysians and mare–\n\nmilking nomads, who are \"noble\" and \"just.\" Here, it seems, we have the very\n\nfirst hints of the Rhipean Mountains and the happy Hyperboreans whose Utopian\n\nexistence (\"beyond the north wind\") was later to become one of the most popular of\n\nall ancient and mediaeval themes. Where they lived is not clear, but it would\n\nbe gratuitous, on the textual evidence, to suppose that Homer thought of them\n\nas living any further north than the steppelands of the lower Denube or wouth–\n\nwestern Ukraine. As knowledge expanded, both the mountains and the people were\n\ngradually pushed further and further northwards: notwithstanding, belief in their\n\nexistence continued for fully 2,500 years after the Homeric age. The Amazons of\n\nthe Iliad pose rather more of a problem. For one thing, Homer was not completely\n\nconvinced of their existence, though, on one occasion, he does represent them as\n\nattacking the Phrygians and their Trojan allies; and, for another, it is diffi–\n\ncult to tell where they were supposed to dwell. Sometimes they are brought from\n\nThrace to help Troy: at others they are domiciled about half-way along the southern\n\nshores of the Black Sea. (When, five hundred years or more afterwards, Greek col–\n\nonists failed to find them hereabouts, it was thought that they had withdrawn\n\nnorthwards beyond the Don to become a people ruled by women.) The origin of the\n\nwhole notion of warrior women is still obscure. Possibly it represents a fusion\n\nof two cultural traits found in the Black Sea region about this time, namely the\n\nmatriarchal code of the Azov tribes and the predilection of the Hittites for women–\n\nlile garb. Others believe that the story of the Golden Fleece is capable of a\n\nsimilar rationalization. Thus Strabo explains that, at a river near Colchis near\n\nthe southeastern end of the Black Sea, it was the practice of the natives to trap\n\n007 | Vol_XI-0114\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views on Northlands\n\nthe alluvial gold in sheep fleeces.\n\nThe Odyssey tells us even less, for only here and there would it appear\n\nthat Homer was describing actual places, winds and currents. Westward beyond\n\nSicily and northward beyond the Bosphorus the task of identifying landfalls,\n\nnever easy, becomes virtually impossible. Having tried it, we feel strongly\n\ninclined to endorse Eratosthenes' dictum (quoted by Strabo, Geography , I, ii,\n\n15) that, to learn where Ulysses went, \"one must find the cobbler who sewed up\n\nthe bag of the winds!\" For what could be more frustrating than to find the\n\nfollowing description of the Cimmerians applied to a region that, on the evidence\n\nsupplied, could not be more than a day or so's sail from Sicily?\n\n\"Thus she (Circe) brought us to the deep-flowing\n\nRiver of Ocean and the frontiers of the world,\n\nwhere the fog-bound Cimmerians live in the City\n\nof Perpetual Mist. When the bright Sun climbs the\n\nsky and puts the stars to flight, no ray from him\n\ncan penetrate to them, nor can he see them as he\n\ndrops from heaven and sinks once more to earth.\n\nFor dreadful Night has spread her mantle over the\n\nheads of that unhappy folk.\" ( Odyssey , Book XI,\n\nRieu's translation).\n\nWhether those Cimmerians are the Kymry of Britain, as Hennig and others\n\nhave argued rather unconvincingly, or the Cimbri of Jutland, or even the Gimmira\n\nof the Crimea (it was not until c. 700 B.C. that they sought refuge from the\n\nScythians by settling along the southern shores of the Black Sea), matters\n\nvery little for our immediate purpose. What is important is the implication\n\nof the story. Long winter and short summer nights speak of much higher lati–\n\ntudes than those of the Mediterranean, while the mention of fog-bound coasts on\n\nthe \"River of Ocean\" suggests that ships were already sailing out into the waters\n\nof the western Atlantic. With the Phoenicians established in Cadiz by 1,100 B.C.,\n\nand doing business with well-nigh every inhabited part of the Mediterranean, there\n\nwas no good reason why Homer should not have heard of these things. Some have\n\n008 | Vol_XI-0115\n\nEA -History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views on Northlands\n\neven supposed that his references to a floating island and clashing rocks imply\n\nthat ships had penetrated northward into the Atlantic far enough to see icebergs,\n\nbut in view of the general air of fiction which permeates the epic, such an assump–\n\ntion rests on a frail foundation. Also implying awareness of lands well to the\n\nnorth of the Mediterranean is the statement Homer makes in the Odyssey concern–\n\ning Telepylus, the city of the Laestrygones. It is described as a place \"where\n\nshepherds bringing in their flocks at night hail and are answered by their fel–\n\nlows driving out at dawn. For in this land nightfall and morning tread so close–\n\nly on each other's heels that a man who could do without sleep might earn a\n\ndouble set of wages, one as a neatherd and the other for shepherding white flocks\n\nof sheep.\" ( Odyssey , Book X, Rieu's translation.) The meaning of the last\n\nclause becomes clear if, for \"night and day\" we substitute \"darkness and dawn\"\n\nor \"sunset and sunrise:\" indeed, as Tozer pointed out long ago, it then begins\n\nto sound uncommonly like Tacitus' description of the short summer nights in the\n\nnorth of Britain - \"finem atque initium lucis exiguo discrimine inter noscas.\"\n\nNo sooner does night threatan, than day reappears; consequently there is not the\n\nsame need for work to cease, as when darkness falls.\n\nFrom Homer to Herodotus\n\nThough Homer almost certainly did not invent the notion of an all-embracing\n\nriver or ocean, he succeeded in giving it immortality. From the Odyssey onward\n\nit became part of the geographical stock-in-trade of poets and prose writers alike.\n\nIn Homer it was merely represented as a deep-flowing river, with little or nothing\n\nsaid about its further boundary. Hesiod, however, had it studded with islands –\n\nthe Hesperides, Erythea and the Isles of the Blessed. Hecataeus believed it to\n\nencompass a circular-shaped earth. Herodotus was more skeptical about its extent\n\n009 | Vol_XI-0116\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views on Northlands\n\nand continuity: while maintaining that there was an ocean to the west of the\n\nMediterranean (to which he first applied the name Atlantic) and also probably\n\nto the south, he claimed that its existence to north and northeast had not been\n\nproved. In support of this view he asserted (what was stoutly denied by the\n\nMiletus school of geographers) that the Caspian Sea was not an arm of the ocean,\n\nbut an inland sea. How far north the oikoumene extended he had no means of\n\ntelling: \"whether sea girds Europe round on the north none can say.\" While ad–\n\nmitting that tin and amber came from the north, he discounted the stories of\n\nthe Tin Islands and had no use for the amber-bearing, north-flowing river Erid–\n\nanus, spoken of by some of his contemporaries. He was equally skeptical about\n\na good many other northern matters, as for instance, the Hyperboreans and the\n\nSleepers.\n\nThe Hyperboreans are first mentioned in cwrtain poems doubtfully attributed\n\nto Hesiod, but which can scarcely be later than the 7th century B.C. By Herod–\n\notus' time it seems almost everybody supposed that, in the far north of Europe,\n\n\"under the shining way\" (the clear northern sky?) lived a people who passed their\n\ndays in perpetual peace and merriment. War, injustice, sickness and infirmity\n\nwere unknown to them, and only those who tired of life ever died. Because they\n\ndwelt beyond Boreas, the north wind, the climate was perpetually temperate, a\n\ncondition which did away with the need of houses. But Herodotus could not bring\n\nhimself to believe in them, for three reasons. Firstly, if they existed, their\n\nneighbors to the south, the Issedonians and the Scythians, would have heard about\n\nthem, which, he avers, was not the case. Secondly, if there were Hyperboreans,\n\nthere must be Hypernotians - dwellers beyond the south wind, an argument which\n\nreally proved nothing except that he shared his contemporaries' feeling for sym–\n\nmetry. Thirdly, such evidence as there was pointed to a deterioration of the\n\n010 | Vol_XI-0117\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views on Northlands\n\nenvironment with distance northward. The \"northern regions,\" he affirms, \"are\n\nuninhabitable, by reason of the severity of the winter.\" The idea of the Sleep–\n\ners, who were said to sleep for six months at a time, was likewise rejected,\n\nthough as we can readily see, it was much the less fanciful of the two; in all\n\nlikelihood it represents a fusion of the tales about the long northern night –\n\nthe length of which was generally reckoned, in Herodotus' day, to be six months,\n\nand about the inhabitants of these regions who were wont to pass much of the\n\nwinter in a state of semi-hibernation. (Until quite recently this was still a\n\ncommon practice among many of the more primitive Russian tribes.) Equally \"un–\n\nworthy of credit\" so Herodotus claimed, are the stories of the goat-footed men\n\ndwelling in \"lofty and precipitous mountains\" north of the Scythians: of the gold–\n\nguarding griffins, and of their enemies, the one-eyed Arimaspians. On the other\n\nhand, he believed in the Amazons, though he declined to say whether or no they\n\ndwelt in the north. Herodctus' unbelieving turn of mind was also employed to\n\ngood advantage when he argued that the \"feathers\" with which the Scythians were said\n\nto fill the air for the purpose of preventing persons from having any view of\n\ntheir regions, were in reality only snow flakes. For, as he pointed out in the\n\nsame book, the Scythian winter was eight months long and received \"scarcely no\n\nrain worth mentioning.\"\n\nConcerning his views on the northwestern limits of the oikoumene , Herodotus\n\nhas left us in very little doubt. \"I do not allow,\" he declared, \"that there is\n\nany river, to which the barbarians give the name Eridanus, emptying itself into\n\nthe northern sea, whence, as the tale goes, amber is procured: nor do I know of\n\nany islands called the Cassiterides whence the tin comes which we use. For in\n\nthe first place \"the name Eridanus is manifestly not a barbarian word at all, but\n\na Greek name, invented by some poet or other: and, secondly, though I have taken\n\n011 | Vol_XI-0118\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views on Northlands\n\nvast pains, I have never been able to get an assurance from an eye-witness\n\nthat there is any sea on the further side of Europe. Nevertheless, tin and\n\namber do certainly come to us from the ends of the earth.\" If Herodotus was\n\nreluctant to hazard what lay beyond the limits of certain knowledge, the above\n\nquotation makes it clear that there must have been many around him who were\n\ntroubled by no such inhabitions, but were ready to accept the existence both of\n\nthe Cassiterides and the northern ocean. Elsewhere he tells us that these men\n\neven drew maps of their fancies, \"making, as they do, the ocean-stream to run all\n\nround the earth, and the earth itself to be an exact circle, as if described by\n\na pair of compasses, with Europe and Asia just of the same size.\" (Book IV,\n\nChapter 36.)\n\nThe absence of such a map is much to be deplored. However, by piecing to–\n\ngether the fragmentary references to the western Europe of the era, we can gather\n\na rough idea of what such a map would have contained. Unfortunately, our best\n\ninformant, Avienus, lived several hundred years (c. 4th century A.D.) after the\n\nperiod in question; even so, the European section of his Ora Martima is widely\n\nheld to be based on echoes of the Carthaginian voyage of Himilco carried out short–\n\nly before Herodotus' time. Avienus himself claimed to have used Himilco's origin–\n\nal account - a claim which few scholars are willing to endorse. More likely he\n\nobtained his information from an earlier compound of Greek tales now lost. Obscure\n\nas parts of the text are (an obscurity not alleviated by the poetic form in which\n\nit is cast), the passage relating to western Europe is reasonably easy to follow.\n\nAfter describing the coasts for some distance north of the Pillars of Hercules,\n\nhe comes to ahhigh headland, of old called Ostrymnis, \"and all the high mass of\n\nrocky ridge turns mostly towards the warm south wind\" (south coast of Brittany?).\n\nIn the midst of the bay which flanks this south-facing shore \"rise the islands\n\n012 | Vol_XI-0119\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of Northlands\n\nwhich are called Oestrymnides, scattered widely about, and rich in metals, in\n\ntin and in lead.\" (Nansen, In Northern Mists , p. 29, claims that \"everything\n\npoints to the islands being situated on the south coast of Brittany, and there\n\nis much in favour of...(the) assumption that they are islands of Morbihan.....\n\nThis agrees very well with the description of Himilco's voyage to the Oestrym–\n\nnides. The free alluvial deposits along the shore ...still contain a good deal\n\nof tin....\") Here live \"a multitude of men with enterprise and active industry,\n\nall having continually commercial interests - they plough in skilful fashion far\n\nand wide the foaming sea ( fretum , literally 'strait') and the currents of monster–\n\nbearing Ocean in their small boats.....Two days' voyage from thence lay the great\n\nisland which the ancients called 'the Holy Island' and it is inhabited by the\n\npeople of Hierne (Ireland?) far and wide, and near to it again extends the island\n\nof Albion. And it was the custom of the men of Tartessus to trade to the borders\n\nof the Oestrymnides: also colonists from Carthage and the many who voyage between\n\nthe Pillars of Hercules visited these seas. The Carthaginian Himilco assures\n\nus that these seas can scarcely sailed through in four months\" (presumably\n\nthere and back, and including time for trading?). Avienus goes on to describe\n\nthese seas as sluggish, windless, foggy, sometimes very shoaly and clogged with\n\nweed, and infested by monsters.\n\n\"Sic nulla late flabra propellunt ratem,\n\nsic segnis humor aequoris pigri stupet.\n\n.......................................\n\nObire semper huc et hunc ponti feras,\n\nnavigia lenta et languide repentia\n\ninternatare beluas.\") lines 120–129)\n\nAs J. O. Thomson remarks, this vaguely alarming stuff can hardly do justice to\n\nHimilco, if he handed in anything like Hannos' detailed report of the west African\n\ncoast ( History of Ancient Geography , p. 54). Perhaps only garbled varsions were\n\nallowed to become current, with the dangers exaggerated to scare off competitors.\n\n013 | Vol_XI-0120\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of Northlands\n\nAlready Plato had heard of the alleged shoals and accounted for them by the\n\nsinking of his Atlantis.\n\nWhat seems to be beyond reasonable doubt is that, by Herodotus' time, the\n\nhorizons of northwestern Europe were slowly being rolled back, and that the\n\nCarthaginians were aware of the existence of the Breton coast and the adjacent\n\ncoasts of Ireland and England. The identity of the Tin Islands is less certain.\n\nAgainst those who contend that the early tin was obtained from Spain, or perhaps\n\nfrom some off-lying islets, must be placed not only the ancient doubts of Herod–\n\notus, but the modern assertion, based upon the work of prospectors, that no im–\n\nportant deposits of tin have ever been exploited on any Atlantic islands. Pos–\n\nsibly the name should be regarded as a nomen appelatiyum rather than a nomen\n\nproprium , accommodating all the western sources of tin, later variously identified\n\nwith real things heard about Spain, Brittany and Cornwall. But if this is so,\n\nit is unlikely that the rich deposits of Cornwall were the first to be exploited,\n\nsince the early descriptions always speak of the Tin Islands as being separate\n\nfrom Britain and further south.\n\nAs for amber, the other main object of northern barter, by about Herodotus'\n\ntime, as we have seen, there had come (perhaps overland) hearsay of Eridanus,\n\na north-flowing river (the Oder? Vistula?) near the mouth of which this valuable\n\ncommodity was washed up by the tide. It was only at a much lat [ ?] er date, after the\n\nhead of the Adriatic had become one of the great entrepôts for the amber trade,\n\nthat the name Eridanus was transferred to the principal stream of those parts,\n\nnamely the Padus, or Po.\n\nOtherwise, nothing much was known of the north of Europe. Not that it wor–\n\nried the Greeks unduly: on the whole they were quite incurious about lands which\n\nyielded up their wealth so reluctantly, and which taxed their powers of acclimat-\n\n014 | Vol_XI-0121\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of Northlands\n\nization so sorely. Indeed, about such lands they were not only incurious, but\n\nfrequently incredulous. Nowhere is this incredulity more shockingly revealed\n\nthan in the fate which befell the discoveries of Pytheas of Massilia.\n\nThe Implications of the Pytheas Story\n\nThe travels of the Massiliot scientist and explorer, Pytheas, are described\n\nelsewhere in the Encyclopedia . Here we are only concerned with the conception\n\nof the northlands which these travels engendered in Pytheas, and the influence\n\nwhich they exerted upon the geographical thinking of his contemporaries and suc–\n\ncessors. Although it is impossible to be dogmatic on the matter (seeing that we\n\nhave only very fragmentary and much-edited information to go upon), it would seem\n\nthat Pytheas' excursion into northern waters led him to the following conclusions:\n\nFirstly, that the oikoumene extended well to the north of the British Isles.\n\nEven if Pytheas did not visit Thule himself (and nowhere does he claim to have\n\ndone so), he had been in touch with people who had, and who averred that, six\n\ndays' sail north of Britain, there were still inhabited lands possessing a climate\n\nsuitable for the growing of vegetables, grain and wild fruits, and the raising\n\nof honey.\n\nSecondly, that in these northerly latitudes, \"the nights in summer are\n\nlight, because ..... then the sun shows not only its radiance, but also the\n\ngreater part of itself\" (Mela's account). \"For it happened in these places that\n\nthe night was very short, in some places of two hours' duration, in others three\n\nhours, so that the sun, going to rest, rose again after a short interval.\" (Ger–\n\nminus of Rhodes' account.)\n\nThirdly, that \"beyond Thule\" at a distance of \"one day's sail\" (Pliny) the\n\nsea became \"sluggish and congealed\" (\"pigrum et concretum\" in Solinus' account).\n\n015 | Vol_XI-0122\n\nEA-Histroy. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of Northlands\n\nFurthermore, the description given of the state of the sea in this vicinity\n\nis sufficiently circumstantial to warrant the belief that it refers to the\n\nedge of the Arctic ice pack, which in the 4th century B.C. was unlikely to\n\nhave occupied a very different mean position from that of today, when, at its\n\nlate winter maximum, it extends roughly northeastwards from Cape Farewell through\n\nthe Denmark Strait (in some years extending almost to the northwestern coast of\n\nIceland) to east of Jan Mayen and on, in a north-sweeping arc, to Bear Island.\n\nStrabo, who could not bring himself to accept any of the story, reports it as\n\nfollows: \"There was no longer any distinction of land or sea or air, but a mix–\n\nture of the three like sea-lung (jelly-fish?) in which he (Pytheas) says that\n\nland and sea and everything floats, and this (i.e. the mixture) binds all to–\n\ngether, and can neither be traversed on foot nor in boat.\"\n\nFourthly, that there was a sea to the east of the Jutland peninsula, the\n\nshores of which were notable for their amber. Whether Pytheas himself sailed\n\ninto the Baltic, let alone as far east as the Vistula, as some authorities have\n\ncontended, cannot readily be established. The mention of the word 'Balcia\" or\n\n\"Baltia.' with which some of his copyists and reporters credit him, is sugges–\n\ntive, but proves little. The absence of any reference to a northern shore is\n\nprobably significant, as is the statement, quoted by Pliny, that the amber, cast\n\nup by the waves, was washed out of the \"congealed sea,\" for this implies that the\n\nArctic ice pack was thought of as occupying the region to the north of Jutland\n\nand the Baltic Sea. On the evidence it is even open to doubt whether Pytheas\n\nknew more of Jutland than that it was a peninsula jutting out into northern waters.\n\nEven so, few travelers in Antiquity accomplished as much as Pytheas. It\n\nmight almost be said that he accomplished too much, for the picture he drew of\n\nthe new lands was so pronouncedly out of line with existing ideas that, with a\n\n016 | Vol_XI-0123\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of Northlands\n\nfew shining exceptions, notably those of Eratosthenes and Hipparchus, it failed\n\nto win acceptance. His younger contemporary, Dicaearchus, doubted him, and,\n\nlater, Polybius and Strabo dubbed him an imposter. Possibly this 'smear cam–\n\npaign' was due, in part at least, to a species of professional jealousy. Poly–\n\nbius, it will be recalled, was active in many Roman campaigns and claimed to be\n\nmore widely traveled than any other geographer: but as his farthest north was\n\nonly the south of Gaul, he may well have resented the thought that a man, living\n\nsome two hundred years before him, had accomplished much more, and in face of\n\nmuch greater difficulties withal. As Nansen reminds us, \"men are not always\n\nabove such littleness.\"\n\nWith Strabo it is more likely that the opposition was based on purely im–\n\npersonal grounds. Indeed, we might almost say, on \"scientific\" grounds. Strabo,\n\nit appears, was a firm believer in the zonal theory of terrestrial distributions,\n\nfirst propounded by Parmenides and subsequently embraced by almost all men of\n\nlearning. According to the usual form of this theory, the earth was divided in–\n\nto five zones, one uninhabitable because of the nearness of the sun, two habitable\n\nbecause they were at a moderate distance, and two uninhabitable because they were\n\ntoo far away from the sun. It was one thing to fix the number of terrestrial\n\nzones: it was quite another thing to fix their position. Even as late as Aris–\n\ntotle there was still very little data for placing the northern tropic on a map,\n\nmuch less the Arctic Circle. While he rightly understood that the tropic was the\n\nnorthernmost line to which the vertical sun advances at the summer solstice, he\n\nerroneously supposed that the southernmost edge of the uninhabitable cold zone\n\nwas coincident with the circle of the northern heavens which marked the limit,\n\nin that direction, of the stars which never set. On this reckoning, every lati–\n\ntude has a different \"arctic circle\". To an observer in Athens (such as Aristotle)\n\n017 | Vol_XI-0124\n\nEA-Histroy. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of Northlands\n\nthis would put the Arctic Circle no farther north than the estuary of the Elbe:\n\nIt has often been doubted whether Aristotle could have been quite so native: but\n\nthe fact is that he was by no means the only one who nursed this delusion.\n\nIn the circumstances, therefore, it is not very difficult to see why many\n\nshould have come to suppose that Soythia deterirated into a desert only a little\n\nway north of the Black Sea, or why Strabo should have contended that the ocean\n\nceased to be liquid a little to the north of Scotland. Within such a frame of\n\nreference, the voyages of Pytheas could obviously find no place. (Dicaearchus,\n\na pupil of Aristotle, cannot altogether have distrusted Pytheas, since he allows\n\nthat the known world extended almost to the Arctic Circle which he placed at 24°\n\nfrom the Pole.)\n\nThe Roman Era\n\nPytheas, unfortunately, seems to have had no emulators. Why this should\n\nbe so is not clear, for his reports were encouraging enough to arouse the bus–\n\niness instinots of even the most timid trader. Nor is it a sufficient explana–\n\ntion to say that the pundits later denounced Pytheas as a liar and a fraud on\n\nthe grounds that his findings did not tally with their theories. Seamen have\n\nseldom shown over-much regard for the doctrinaire views of land-lubbers. More\n\nlikely the Greek colonists found that they could secure their commercial ends\n\nwith less trouble by way of the overland route to the Cassiterides and the Baltic.\n\nBe this as it may, the tally of northern knowledge was not increased during the\n\ncourse of the next five hundred years: indeed, a good deal was lost, or, more\n\nstrictly, rejected. Eratosthenes (fl. c. 230 B.C.), to give him his due, did\n\nretain Thule (far out in the ocean to the north of \"Brettanice\") as his utter–\n\nmost land and northern limit of the oikoumene , but on the other hand, he falsely\n\nassumed that the Pytheas story warranted belief in the eastward continuance of\n\n018 | Vol_XI-0125\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of Northlands\n\nthe ocean to the 'Gulf' of the Caspian. He was equally in error in supposing that\n\nthe presence of a circumambient ocean could be inferred from the occurrence of\n\ntidal phenomena around all the the -known outer sea coasts. Hipparchus (fl. c.\n\n150 B.C.) likewise continued to accept Thule as the northernmost part of the\n\noikoumene , while differing from Eratosthenes in his view of the tides. How Hip–\n\nparchus located his high latitudes is not very clear. The line of the 19-hour\n\nday (summer solstice) is said to pass through the south of Britain, and not the\n\nnorth as one would expect. These, he declared to be far from uniform in their\n\nmanifestations, but it is not known whether, on this account, he was opposed to\n\nthe concept of the ocean-girt oikoumene . Polybius (fl. c. 150 B.C.), though a\n\ncontemporary of Hipparchus', was far removed from him in outlook and intellectual\n\ncalibre. He was, in fact, an obscurantist, perhaps the first of the many whose\n\nnames clutter up the pages of geographical history. Because, so we judge, of an\n\nover-zealous attachment to the zonal theory, he was willing to discard the entire\n\nPytheas story, declaring that all the country north of Narbo, the Alps and the\n\nAaurus, was unknown. He was, truth to tell, open-minded enough to leave unanswer–\n\ned the question of whether there was a continuous ocean to the north of Europe,\n\nand quite rightly denied the idea of a Caspian \"Gulf.\"\n\nBut it would be a mistake to suppose that there was any such thing as uni–\n\nformity of ideas among the men of this era. If the Pytheas story was rejected,\n\nrather than simply discarded or lost sight of, it was not simply because of its\n\nincompatibility with the zonal theory, for not everybody accepted this: and of\n\nthose who did, there were some who ignored its implications. Thus Grates (fl. c.\n\n165 B.C.) the librarian at Pergamum, divided the earth into four parts by an\n\nequatorial east-west flowing ocean and a meridional ocean stretching from pole\n\nto pole. He had the Ethiopians living right in the Torrid Zone on either side\n\n019 | Vol_XI-0126\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of the Northlands\n\nof the equatorial ocean, a race of nightless giants about the latitude of the\n\nArctic Circle and the dayless Cer b erians at the pole: The fact that the Cratesian\n\nconception was, if anything, even less rational than the zonal view did not pre–\n\nvent it from enjoying a wide and long-lasting popularity. Through Macrobius\n\nit passed down to the Middle Ages.\n\nThe leading historians of the time show equally little appreciation of the\n\nimplications of the Pytheas story. Thus, all that Caesar (c. 50 B.C.) knew or\n\nwas willing to admit was that, to the north of Britain, there were some off-lying\n\nislands where the winter night was a month long. If this is an echo from Pytheas,\n\nwe could scarcely wish for a better measure of the decline of knowledge during\n\nthe intervening 300 years. Even on Britain, Caesar's showing is far from im–\n\npressive, for he has the west coast facing Spain as well as Ireland, and the\n\neastern side facing the empty northern ocean:\n\nStrabo (fl. c. 20 B.C. - c. 20 A.D.) was no better. In his desire to avoid\n\nexaggeration, or perhaps to discredit the giants of the past, he refused to give\n\nserious consideration, either to Pytheas' claims, or to the information which,\n\nas we can see from Pliny, had filtered into Greece from other sources. He does\n\nnot even make use of the geographical knowledge gained in his own time as a re–\n\nsult of Augustus' campaign in northern Germania. To him the Ister (Danube), the\n\nmountains of the Hercynian Forest (Central Germany) and Ierne (Ireland) consti–\n\ntuted, very roughly, the limit of the known world in this direction. Ierne,\n\nlocated in approximately latitude 54° N., is taken to be the most northern land.\n\n\"Living writers,\" he asserts, \"tell us of nothing beyond Ierne which lies near\n\nto Britain on the north ( sic ) and is inhabited by savages who live miserably on\n\naccount of the cold.\" The Tin Islands are described as a group of ten lying well\n\nto the north of Spain in the latitude of Britain. As for the lands lying to the\n\n020 | Vol_XI-0127\n\nEA-Histroy. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of Northlands\n\neast of Britain, he declares that \"those parts of the country beyond the Albis\n\n(i.e. Elbe) that are near the ocean are wholly unknown to us. For of the men\n\nof earlier times I know of no one who made this voyage along the coast to the\n\neastern parts that extend as far as the mouth ( sic ) of the Caspian Sea; and the\n\nRomans have not yet advanced into the parts that are beyond Albis; and likewise\n\nno one has made the journey by land either.\" ( Geography , 7,2,4., H. L. Jones'\n\ntranslation). Even in regard to a country as well known as Scythia, Strabo is\n\npitifully ignorant. True, he has a reasonably accurate notion of the comparative\n\ndimensions of the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea, but everything north of the\n\nnearby Roxolani, \"the most remote of the known Scythians,\" is terra incognita\n\nand uninhabitable at that. As for the stories of the Rhipean Mountains and the\n\nHyperboreans, these he characterized as myths born of popular ignorance of the\n\nregions in question, and of a baseless regard for Pytheas' \"false statements....\n\nregarding the country along the ocean, wherein he uses as a screen his scientific\n\nknowledge of astronomy and mathematics.\" ( Geography, 7, 3, 1., H. L. Jones'\n\ntranslation). In Strabo's view, both Pytheas and Eratosthenes had placed the\n\nboundary of known land 8,000 stadia, or 11° 20′ too far north.\n\nMany later writers knew even less. Some of the poets wrote as if the\n\nScythians were near neighbours of the Eskimos.\n\n\"Not a blade of grass appears on the plain, not a leaf on the trees:\n\nBut as far as eye can reach earth lies, her features lost\n\nBeneath snowdrifts and ice to a depth of seven fathoms.\n\nIt's always winter, always the cold nor-wester blowing.\n\nAnd worse, the sun can never break through the wan gloom there –\n\nNot when his horses draw him up to the height of heaven,\n\nNot when his chariot brings him to bathe in the blood-red sea.\n\n.........\n\n(The men) dig out deep igloos underground\n\n.........\n\nHere they while away the darkness in games, and gladly\n\nMake do with beer and a rough cider for draughts of wine.\"\n\n( Georgics , III, lines 353 et seq.)\n\n021 | Vol_XI-0128\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of Northlands\n\nIn such words does Virgil portray \"the tameless tribes\" of the Sea of Azov:\n\nOther writers talk as if the northern ocean were a mere two hundred miles north\n\nof the Black Sea and full of hideous monsters which were likely to tear to pieces\n\nany seamen who might be so foolhardy as to sail its waters. One woebegone navi–\n\ngator who did so is made, by Albinovanus Pedo (c. 40 A.D.), to express his feel–\n\nings in the following words: \"Whither are we being carried? The day itself flees\n\nfrom us, and uttermost nature closes in the deserted world with continual dark–\n\nness. Or are we sailing towards people on the other side who dwell under an–\n\nother heaven, and towards another unknown world? The Gods call us back and for–\n\nbid the eyes of mortals to see the boundary of things. Why do we violate strange\n\nseas and sacred waters with our oars, disturbing the peaceful habitations of the\n\nGods?\" Seneca, to whom we owe the survival of Pedo's poetic fragment, has no\n\nuse for the idea of land beyond the northern ocean, simply stating that \"beyond\n\nall things is the ocean, (and) beyond the ocean, nothing\" (\"post omnia oceanus,\n\npost oceanum nihil\").\n\nPomponius Mela (fl. c. 40 A.D.) is likewise unable to shed much new light\n\nupon the subject. Apart from a wild story about Indians being blown past the\n\nCaspian \"Gulf\" to Germany (which he cites in support of the \"oceanic\" theory\n\nof the Arctic), his account is based upon the usual stock-in-trade of the time.\n\nHis Hyperboreans live beyond the north wind and the Rhipean Mountains \"under the\n\nvery pivot of the stars\" (i.e. the Pole). In their country the sun rises at the\n\nvernal equinox and sets at the autumnal equinox, so that they have six months'\n\nday and six months' night. How he was able to reconcile the existence of the\n\nsunny and fertile land with belief in the zonal theory of Parmenides is not clear;\n\nthe fact that he calls it a \"narrow land\" may signify that he was not altogether\n\nhappy about the logic of the contention. As we noted earlier, he has heard of\n\n022 | Vol_XI-0129\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediteranean Views of Northlands\n\nThule, \"famous in Greek poems and in our own;\" he knows of the Orkneys and the\n\nShetlands to the extent of indicating the existence of two distinct groups of\n\nislands north of Britain, and he is credibly informed that in Ireland the pas–\n\ntures are so lush that \"if the cattle are allowed to graze for more than a small\n\npart of the day, they burst in pieces!\" East of the British Isles he quickly\n\ngets into difficulties. True, he describes a vast bay (Codanus by name) which\n\nsome have supposed to be the Skagerrak, and a region which \"seems sometimes to\n\nbe islands and sometimes the sea,\" and, on that account, might conceivably re–\n\nfer to the intricate system of islands and straits south of the Kattegat; but\n\nby peopling these localities with Hippopods (horse-footed men) and Sanalians\n\n(whose ears were big enough to be employed as a covering for the body), he makes\n\nit very difficult for us to attribute to him anything but a most shadowy know–\n\nledge of the embayed and insular character of the continental seaboard.\n\nPliny (fl. c. 70 A. D.) who might have been expected to know more about\n\nthe north coast of Europe, since he reports the voyage of Augustus' fleet round\n\nGermania to the Cimbrian Cape (Jutland), is likewise content with such platitudes\n\nas \"the Northern Ocean has also been in great part traversed,\" it is \"immeasur–\n\nable,\" it extends to \"the Scythian region and to places that are stiff from too\n\nmuch moisture,\" and contains \"many nameless islands\" some of which he proceeds\n\nforthwith to name. For the rest, his Natural History account is very largely\n\na rechauffe of earlier writings, mainly Greek. His description of the far north\n\nof Scythia is characteristic: \"This part of the world is accursed by nature and\n\nshrouded in thick darkness: it produces nothing else but frost and is the chilly\n\nhiding place of the north wind.\" ( Natural History , IV, xii, 88). Beyond lay\n\nthe happy Hyperboreans, blessed with a magnificent climate: like Mela, he man–\n\nages to sandwich them in between Scythia and the equally inclement northern ocean.\n\n023 | Vol_XI-0130\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of Northlands\n\nIt is because of blatant anomalies of this sort that we are constrained to\n\ndoubt whether Pliny, or Mela for that matter, ever seriously tried to construct\n\na congruent cosmographical system out of the body of knowledge available to him.\n\nTime and again we have evidence that he did not even bother to harmonize con–\n\nflicting statements culled from his authorities. In Chapter Thirteen of Book\n\nFour he has the Cronium Sea stretching north from the Baltic coast in the vicin–\n\nity of the Cimbri: in Chapter Sixteen of the same book he displaces the same\n\nsea a day's sail beyond thule, which, in his view, lay to the north of Britain\n\nin the vicinity of the Arctic Circle. The acceptance of \"Scandia\" and \"Scatin–\n\navia\" as separate islands situated not far from the coast of Britain may perhaps\n\nbe taken as a further indication of his uncritical handling of source material.\n\nTacitus, writing shortly before the end of the first Christian century,\n\nwas unable to improve on Pliny's knowledge of the extreme north. Beyond the\n\nOrkneys toward an island which he \"saw at a distance\" (and presumably one of the\n\nShetlands), the sea became thick and sluggish, while to the north of the Suiones\n\n(Swedes), who lived on an island \"ipso in oceano,\" it became almost immobile\n\n(\"mare pigrum ac prope immotum\"). Near the Suiones, on the mainland, live the\n\nFenni (Finns?), very poor and primitive. For his romantically-minded readers,\n\nhe adds the Utopian fancy that \"the forms of the Gods are seen\" when the sun\n\nemerges from the ocean.\n\nAnd worse was still to come. In his De Facie in Orbis Lunae , Plutarch\n\nplaces the Homeric island, Ogygia, five days' sail west of Britain, with three\n\nothers spread out northwestwards, each an equal distance from its neighbour.\n\n\"In one of these the barbarians feign that Saturn is detained prisoner by Jupiter,\n\nwho, as his son, having the guard or keeping of these islands and the adjacent\n\nsea, named the Saturnian (or Cronian), has his seat a little below; and that the\n\n024 | Vol_XI-0131\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of Northlands\n\ncontinent, by which the great sea is circularly environed, is distant from Ogygia\n\nabout 5,000 stadia, but from others not so far, men using to row thither in\n\ngalleys, the sea being there low and ebb, and difficult to be passed by great\n\nvessels because of the mud brought thither by a multitude of rivers, which,\n\ncoming from the mainland, discharge themselves into it, and raise there great\n\nbars and shelves that choke up the river and render it hardly navigable: whence\n\nanciently there arose an opinion of its being frozen.\" An equally extravagant\n\nstory by Antonius Diogenes, dating from about the same epoch, brough its char–\n\nacters to see the \"wonders beyond Thule,\" to places of six months' and even\n\nperpetual night. But by then Thule had ceased to be a place with a fixed loca–\n\ntion: some poets even talked loosely of Britain as Thule.\n\nWith such facts before us, it is hard to avoud the conclusion cherished\n\nby many modern historians, that the Romans had little talent or even liking\n\nfor scientific enquiry. They traveled widely within their borders, but seldom\n\ncuriously. Their frontier officers did not spend their vacations climbing\n\nmountains or big game hunting in the wilds, nor did they write books about their\n\nadventures. Few enough wrote about the more civilized parts. Apparently there\n\nwere others besides Cicero who found geography a \"rather obscure science.\"\n\nHorace expresses what was obviously a widely felt distaste when he inveighs\n\nagainst the impious men who first dared to cross the sea, \"with northern gales\n\nfierce war to wage\" and \"on strange weltering beasts\" to gaze. ( Odes , Book I,\n\n3, 9–24. However, elsewhere, Odas Book III, 24, 36–40, and Epistles , Book I, 1,\n\nhe talks of greedy merchants - not Roman? - venturing to the frozen north and\n\nthe tropics and India). Or maybe it was conceit that suffocated their spirit\n\nof enquiry - the conceit that made them sometimes talk as if Rome was mistress\n\nof all lands not inaccessible or uninhabitable, and of all seas, not only within\n\n025 | Vol_XI-0132\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of Northlands\n\nthe Pillars, but beyond to the ends of the ocean. This conceit permeates\n\nthe writings even of some of the Romanophile Greeks, eg. the Periegetes of\n\nDionysius.\n\nHowever, not all the geography of the Roman era is of such an indifferent\n\nquality. Here and there in the Empire were scholars, Greeks rather than Romans,\n\nwho were trying to put the subject onto a scientific footing. Preeminent among\n\nthese were Marinus of Tyre (fl. c. 110 A.D.) and Claudius Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy)\n\nof Alexandria. Unfortunately, Marinus' writings are known only through Ptolemy\n\n(fl. c. 150 A.D.), who called him the most careful geographer of his time. He\n\nappears to have drawn up a list of all the important places in the known world,\n\ngiving to each its approximate latitude and longitude, and then locating them\n\non a gridded map of the world. What Marinus' world looked like can be roughly\n\ninferred from the various maps which accompany the early manuscripts of Ptolemy's\n\neight-volumed Geographia , since Ptolemy made it clear that his primary task was\n\nto bring up to date the work of his predecessor. Whether or not the maps found\n\nin the early manuscripts of Ptolemy's Geographia were the work of the Alexan–\n\ndrine scholar himself is not of great consequence, since anyone with enough\n\npatience can reconstruct the maps for himself. In these maps the northwestern\n\ncoasts of Europe, as far east as the Cimbrian peninsula (Jutland), are recog–\n\nnizably portrayed. The same is true of Britain and Ireland, concerning which\n\nit would seem that Ptolemy was better informed than Pytheas, though admittedly\n\nthe northern part of Scotland (Caledonia) is given an east-west orientation,\n\npresumably in an effort to keep the island well to the south of Thule. To the\n\nnorth of Scotland in latitude 61° 41′ N. lie the Orkneys, thirty in number, and\n\nto the west, the Hebrides. \"And far to the north of them\" lies Thule in approx–\n\nimately latitude 63° N. and longitude 30° 21′ E. (i.e. east of the Fortunate\n\n026 | Vol_XI-0133\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of Northlands\n\nIsles). It is thought that his displacing of Thule from the Arctic Circle\n\nwas due to the men of Agricola's fleet believing that they had sighted the\n\nisland north of the Orkneys: in which case it is possible that the island should\n\nbe identified with one of the Shetlands, which are not specifically named by\n\nPtolemy.\n\nTo the north of the known coasts and islands of Europe, there stretched,\n\nin the view of both Ptolemy and Marinus, a continuation of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIn the extreme northwest this went by the name of the Hyperborean Ocean, \"also\n\ncalled the congealed, or Cronius, or the Dead Sea.\" North of Britain, it be–\n\ncame the Deucaledonian Ocean, and from Britain to the vicinity of the Cimbrian\n\npeninsula, the Germanic Ocean. Here it merged into the Sarmatian Ocean, which\n\nis Ptolemy's name for the Baltic Sea, the northern shores of which were as yet\n\nunsuspected. What happened to the ocean still further eastward is not disclos–\n\ned: east of the 60th meridian the coast of Europe swings northward to the 63rd\n\nparallel, i. e., of Thule, at which latitude the map ends. In his Astronomy ,\n\nPtolemy carries his oikoumene northwards to 64–1/2° N., where he places, in the\n\nlongitude of northern Asia, the Scythians. But the general import is clear\n\nenough: Ptolemy, as Marinus before him, had little use for the \"oceanic\" hypoth–\n\nesis of the planetary distribution of land and sea. In his view the grounds\n\nfor holding that the oikoumene was entirely surrounded by water were inadequate:\n\nthe Caspian Sea was closed and, as no Asiatic traveler had as yet penetrated\n\nbeyond the Hyperborean Mountains, located somewhat north of the sixtieth paral–\n\nlal, Ptolemy is content to let Scythia fade away polewards into terra incognita.\n\n(Similarly, in the opinion of both Ptolemy and Marinus, there was no evidence\n\nthat the southern reaches of Africa were vounded by sea. In the absence of such\n\nevidence, they affirmed that the Indian Ocean was enclosed by an eastward exten–\n\nsion of Africa and southern extension of Asia.)\n\n027 | Vol_XI-0134\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of Northlands\n\nUnfortunately for posterity, Ptolemy's Geographia was destined to gather\n\ndust in the library of Alexandria. Had he lived two hundred years earlier,\n\nhis work might have borne fruit, or at least it might have been put into cir–\n\nculation and provoked thoughtful comment, if nothing else. But coming, as it\n\ndid, at a time when the Roman world was yearly acquiring more and more internal\n\npreoccupations, few men appear to have had any stomach for its stodgy data and\n\npostulates. More than a thousand years were to elapse before the work was to\n\nwin wide acclaim. From the third century to the end of the fourteenth, only\n\nrarely does the Geographia attract notice: from time to time Ptolemy's name is\n\nmentioned, but none of the writers concerned apprehended the profound signifi–\n\ncance of his work.\n\nThe Dark Ages\n\nThe decline of northern knowledge, already reflected in the works of\n\nStrabo and Pliny, was accelerated by the happenings of the succeeding contur–\n\nies. Prominent among these was the loss of Rome's commercial supremacy. By\n\nthe end of the third century, the forces of disruption had so gripped the Empire\n\nthat it was no longer the sole guardian of the great trade routes. Contacts\n\nwith the barbarian world became less frequent and friendly: such business as\n\nthere was fell increasingly into the hands of intermediaries. But the trouble\n\ndid not stop there: because of the parallel collapse of the Roman administrative\n\nsystem, the Germanic invasions also led to the breakdown of political and econ–\n\nomic life within the Empire. Henceforth ideas and information spread only slowly,\n\nand against great resistance, from one district to another: culture became re–\n\ngional and stagnant. The reorganization of the Empire into two parts under\n\nTheodosius served, paradoxically enough, to further these tendencies, for the\n\n028 | Vol_XI-0135\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of Northlands\n\ntwo empires became, in effect, separate entities, the contacts of the Latin\n\nworld with the Greek civilization becoming more and more tenuous as time went\n\nby. No less important was the development of a new intellectual climate in\n\nthe Mediterranean consequent upon the introduction of Christianity. The new\n\nfaith gave men new values, whereby many of the old ones fell into disrepute.\n\nThe great theological doctrines made scientific investigation seem, in the eyes\n\nof some, a reprehensible misapplication of human powers. To men of this per–\n\nsuasion, it was natural that the Scriptures should become the yardstick by\n\nwhich to measure the orthodoxy of any given work. Such a man was the sixth\n\ncentury traveler Cosmas Indicopleustes: for him the Scriptures were \"profitable\n\nnot only for doctrine, reproof and instruction in righteousness,\" but for in–\n\nstruction in earth-knowledge as well. Basing his argument on the assumed symbol–\n\nism of the Mosaic tabernacle (which even by some modern theologians is regard–\n\ned as a pattern of the world), he claimed that the oikoumene was oblong, twice\n\nas long as it is broad, and surrounded by an ocean uniting the Mediterranean,\n\nthe Caspian, the Persian and Red Seas. In the far north stood a mighty conical\n\nmountain behind which the sun set at night, passing round the top in the summer\n\nand the base in the winter; this he held to explain the difference in the length\n\nof summer and winter days.\n\nBut it would be a mistake to suppose that Cosmas was truly representative\n\nof his time. As early as the 4th century, Lactantius was encouraging his breth–\n\nern not to ignore pagan learning, for, said he, \"it is extremely full of erudi–\n\ntion and philosophy.\" He went further and argued that the Bible sanctioned the\n\nspoiling of the Egyptians, provided there was no pollution from the spoils!\n\nGenerally speaking, the attitude of the Church toward profane studies was\n\none of tolerance rather than opposition, and there are many instances when\n\n029 | Vol_XI-0136\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of Northlands\n\n\"interest\" would describe it more accurately than tolerance. Orosius, a\n\nSpanish priest of the 5th century, was, we believe, much more typical of the\n\nage than Cosmas. His description of the northwestern limits of the known earth\n\nis as objective as anything written by Ptolemy: \"Britain, an island in the ocean,\n\nextends a long distance to the north: to its south are the Gauls..... (It) is\n\n800 miles long and 200 miles wide. In the limitless ocean which stretches be–\n\nhind Britain are the Orcades Islands (Orkneys) of which twenty are deserted and\n\nthirteen inhabited..... Ireland is quite close to Britain and smaller in area.\n\nIt is, however, richer, on account of the favourable character of its climate\n\nand soil.\" ( Historiarum Adversus Paganos, Libri VII , I, 2.)\n\nAn even fuller account was given in the same century by Jordanes, appar–\n\nently copying from the writings of the contemporary Roman priest and statesman\n\nCassiodorus. The attempted fusion of pagan and Christian thought is well brought\n\nout in his account of the circumambient ocean. \"Not only has no one undertaken\n\nto describe the impenetrable uttermost bounds of the ocean, but it has not even\n\nbeen vouchsafed to any one to explore them, since it has been experienced that,\n\non account of the re s istence of the seaweed and because the winds cease to blow\n\nthere, the ocean is impenetrable and is known to none but Him who created it.\"\n\nBut it has a number of islands in it, including the Balearic Isles ( sic ) and\n\n\"the Orcades, thirty-three in number..... It has also in its most western part\n\nanother island, called Thyle, of which the Mantuan (i.e. Virgil) says: 'May the\n\nuttermost Thule be subject to thee.' This immense ocean has also in its arctic,\n\nthat is to say, northern part, a great island called Scandza, concerning which\n\nour narrative, with God's help, shall begin, for the nation (the Goths).....\n\nburst forth like a swarm of bees from the lap of this island, and came to the\n\nland of Europe......\" ( De Origine Actibusque Getarum. )\n\n030 | Vol_XI-0137\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of Northlands\n\nOf course, there is nothing very original in all this: most of it had\n\nbeen said before and said better. However, Jordanus goes on to supply infor–\n\nmation about the inhabitants of the northern part of the island, the Screre–\n\nfennae (\"they do not seek a subsistence in corn, but live on the flesh of wild\n\nbeasts and the eggs of birds\") and the Adogit (\"they have continuous light in\n\nthe middle of the summer for forty days\") which cannot be found in any of his\n\nauthorities and which leads us to suppose that even in the 6th century the chan–\n\nnels of communication between north and south Europe were not completely clogged.\n\nOur suspicion that Jordanus may be repeating a second-hand story about the Lapps\n\nor the Finns is strengthened when we come to look into the contemporary work of\n\nthe Byzantine historian, Procopius. The Skrid-finns, as he calls them, live in\n\nthe island of Thule (which the context establishes as Scandinavia). \"The extra–\n\nordinarily great forests and mountains which rise in their country give them\n\nvast quantities of game and other beasts. They always eat the flesh of the\n\nanimals they hunt and wear their skins, fastening them together with the sinews\n\nof beasts. Their children do not take woman's milk, but are nourished solely\n\nwith the marrow of slain beasts.\" None of the Ancients knew so much about the\n\nFinns: Tacitus and Ptolemy were acquainted with the name, and little more.\n\nWith the distinguishing features of the Finnish economy, including the\n\nfact that some of the tribes were ski-runners (this being the force of the\n\ncorrupt Norse prefix \"skrid\"), already know in the 6th century, we may well\n\nask ourselves why there were, subsequently, so few written references to the\n\nFinns and their neighbours. One reason is that Isidore was unaware of the work\n\nof Procopius and Jordanus, or, if aware, that he did not choose to use it. This\n\nmay appear to be a reason of little moment until we recall that Isidore was the\n\nmost influential name in the literature of Christendom from the 7th to the 14th\n\n031 | Vol_XI-0138\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of Northlands\n\ncenturies, and that his twenty-volumed Etymologiae was prescribed reading\n\nfor almost every lettered man throughout that time. Even in the 15th century,\n\nCardinal Pierre d'Ailly (to whom Columbus owed much) regarded it with something\n\nakin to reverential awe, notwithstanding the fact that the entire work is cast\n\nin an antiquarian mould and contains nothing that cannot be traced back, either\n\ndirectly or indirectly, to readily accessible Latin sources. Probably the best\n\nthat can be said for it is that it might have been worse, for Isidore, good\n\nChristian that he was, adopted a surprisingly hospitable attitude toward pagan\n\nlore and, in so doing, helpted to keep alive information which otherwise would\n\nhave almost certainly perished. Its importance for the student of history lies\n\nin the fact that it provides him with a cross-section of the mind of the Dark\n\nAges: that it came to be the norm by which cosmographical orthodoxy was measured.\n\nSeen in this light, Isidor e 's account of the northlands takes on more than usual\n\nsignificance. In the extreme north, he has Scythia stretching from the Seric\n\n(i.e. Eastern) ocean in the east to the Caspian Sea in the west. \"Several of\n\nthe districts are rich, but some are uninhabited, for while they are rich in\n\ngold and precious stones, they are rarely approached by man owing to the feroc–\n\nity of the griffens\" ( Etymologiae , Book XIV, Chapter 3, paragraph xxxii.), a\n\nspecies of winged quadrupeds found in the Hyperborean Mountains and first publi–\n\ncized by Hesiod. The land of Hyrcania, bordering Scythia to the west \"has many\n\ntribes wandering far afield on account of the unfruitfulness of their lands.\"\n\n( op. cit. , XIVm 3, xxxi.) Coming still further west into Europe he places the\n\nlimit of the oikoumene in the land of Barbaria, so called on account of the wild\n\ntribes inhabiting it. Enumerated among these are the Alani, the Dacians, the\n\nGoths and the Suevi, which is the nearest Isidore comes to dealing with the con–\n\ntemporary scene. Thule is described, traditionally, as \"the farthest island in\n\n032 | Vol_XI-0139\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of Northlands\n\nthe ocean on the northern and western waters beyond Britain,\" and is said to\n\ntake its name \"from the sun, because there the sun makes its summer solstice,\n\nand beyond the summer day is of great length:\" the surrounding sea is \"calm and\n\nfrozen.\" ( op. cit . XII, 6, iv.) How a work filled with such unoriginal de–\n\nscriptions came to be the most-read book of the Middle Ages is a little hard to\n\nunderstand, but then so is the popularity of many an indifferent work in our\n\nown day. Perhaps the very banality, its respect for the written word of others,\n\nand its absence of disturbing novelty were the things that most endeared it to\n\nits readers. In face of the many calamities which threatened to engulf the\n\ncountries of southern Europe, what more compelling task was there than the main–\n\ntenance of the intellectual status quo? What better rallying cry than \"strengthen\n\nthe things that remain?\" In such a mental atmosphere it is hardly to be won–\n\ndered at that past opinions should come to assume greater importance than pres–\n\nent realities. \"Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing may be lost\"\n\nseems to epitomize the spirit of the times. Among the gatherers none was more\n\nfaithful or zealous than Isidore.\n\nOther Mediterranean scholars of the same attitude of mind were Moses of\n\nKhorene (5th century) who drew on pagan and Christian authorities with seeming\n\nimpartiality; the anonymous Ravennese geographer of the mid-7th century whose\n\nCosmographia leans slightly more on patristic authority as far as the north is\n\nconcerned, but who elsewhere shows himself to have been a competent Greek scholar–\n\na rare accomplishment in his age; and Aethicus of Istria who, although a much\n\ntraveled man of the 7th century, describes the Babylon, not of his own day, but\n\nas it might have appeared in the time of Darius, and Thebes as Pausanias would\n\nhave known it in the 2nd century A.D.\n\n033 | Vol_XI-0140\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of Northlands\n\nMoslem Theories\n\nAt the moment when a revival of geographical speculation and interest\n\nin the contemporary world seemed impossible, two new forces began to play\n\nupon the inert mass of Mediterranean culture. The Moslems in the south and\n\nthe Vikings in the north, notwithstanding their sinister role as enemies of\n\nChristendom, proved in the long run to be the agents of its intellectual re–\n\nbirth. Of these two forces, the Arabic was the earlier and more influential.\n\nControlling, as they did from the 8th century onwards, most of the centers\n\nof ancient learning in western Asia and Africa - above all Ptolemy's Alexandria,\n\nthe Arabs were in a singularly good position to take advantage of older know–\n\nledge, if they wished to do so. And this they did, once the doctors of the\n\nKoran had weaned themselves from their early opposition to secular literature.\n\nBy the beginning of the 9th century the obscurantism of the first believers was\n\nalready passing away and Mohammed's words \"seek knowledge, even in China\" were\n\nacquiring mandatory force. It must be confessed, however, that not many got as\n\nfar as China. Their travels were, for the most part, conducted within the bor–\n\nders of Islam, with Mecca as the supreme focus of attraction. Thither came\n\nmen from Casablanca and Toledo, from the Sudan and Sofala, from Samarkand and\n\nKashgar. Their geographies reflect the breadth of their travels, and are full\n\nof insights into the life and times of the countries through which the travelers\n\npassed. But the lands of the \"infidel\" Christian receive much scantier consid–\n\neration, while those domains lying as yet beyond the orbit of both Cross and\n\nCrescent, are frequently left unnoticed. Doubtless the reason for this neglect\n\nof the northlands was partly climatic. Islam was cradled in a desert - and a\n\nwarm desert at that. Even today it is quite remarkable how close is the corre–\n\nlation between the territorial distribution of Islamic culture and the distribu-\n\n034 | Vol_XI-0141\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of Northlands\n\ntion of semi-arid lands in low and middle latitudes. The Arabs were quickly\n\ndiscomfited by rain, and even more so by cold. It is not without significance\n\nthat the voyages of Sindbad the (Moslem) Sailor were all set in tropical or\n\nsubtropical waters.\n\nBut this can hardly be the whole story, for there were, at one time or\n\nanother, many thriving Moslem communities around the well-watered coasts of\n\nthe Indian Ocean and on the bleak plateaus of Central Asia. The Arabs were\n\ninhibited by the strictures of their own religion, and of Greek philosophy.\n\nThus, it can be shown that their reluctance to explore the coasts of the At–\n\nlantic stemmed partly from the widespread conviction of Moslem theologians\n\nthat a man foolhardy enough to embark upon the \"Sea of Darkness\", or encircling\n\nocean, should be deprived of civil rights, as being manifestly irresponsible\n\nfor his actions! It was even rumored that the necessity for imposing such a\n\npunishment might be rendered superfluous by the destruction of the audacious\n\nmariner in the lurking whirlpools. That many Moslem scientists were equally\n\ndeferential to Greek opinions is also apparent. There are frequent reitera–\n\ntions of the zonal theory and of the view that the earth's surface was divided\n\ninto three parts water and one part land, the length of the oikoumene being\n\ntwice its width. Yet there was no little merit in even repeating what the\n\nGreeks has said, for in so doing they helped to keep alive knowledge which was\n\nlater, through their transmission, to help furnish the intellectual milieu of\n\nthe Renaissance.\n\nAnd they did a good deal more than this; for by piecing together the new\n\nscraps of knowledge which were periodically being unearthed, men like Al-Mas' u ū d i ī ,\n\nAl-B i ī r u ū n i ī and Al-Idr i ī s i ī succeeded in getting nearer to the truth about the\n\nnorthern limits of the habitable earth than any Christian before the 13th century.\n\n035 | Vol_XI-0142\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of Northlands\n\nThrough their commercial contacts, from the 8th century onwards, with the\n\nMoslemized Bulgars whose capital city lay on the Volga near the present town of\n\nKazan the Arabs heard of a mysterious people, Wisu by name, living far to the\n\nnorth of the Russian steppes. (These were probably the same people as the Wizzi\n\nmentioned in Adam of Bremen's Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum. ) Accord–\n\ning to the writer Ibu Y a ā q u ū t, who quotes a certain Ibn Fadhl a ā n (fl. c. 920 A.D.),\n\nthe Wisu lived so far north - \"a distance of three months' journey\" - from the\n\nBulgars that \"during the summer the nights were not even one hour long.\" Else–\n\nwhere Y a ā q u ū t says that the night is \"so short that one is not aware of any dark–\n\nness,\" while at another time of the year it is so long that one sees no daylight.\n\nThis would place the territory at least as far north as the latitude of the White\n\nSea. Ibn Batt u ū ta (fl. c. 1350) tried to get there himself, but later gave up\n\nthe attempt, because it stood to profit him but little. However, his descrip–\n\ntion of the region contained in his Rihla (or Journey ) has the ring of authen–\n\nticity about it. \"That land lies 40 days' journey from Bulgar, and the journey\n\nis only made in small cars (sledges?) drawn by dogs. For this desert has a\n\nfrozen surface, upon which neither men nor horses can get foothold, but dogs\n\ncan, as they have claws. This journey is only undertaken by \"rich merchants,\n\neach taking with him about a hundred carriages provided with sufficient food,\n\ndrink and wood, for in that country there is found neither trees,nor stones,\n\nnor soil. As a guide through this land they use a dog which has already made\n\nthe hourney several times, and it is so highly prized that they pay as much as\n\na thousand dinars for one. This dog is harnessed with three others by the neck\n\nto a car so that it goes as the leader and the others follow it.\" Al-M a ā zin i ī\n\n(fl. c. 1130) has an equally plausible-sounding story which suggests not only\n\nthat the Arabs knew of the existence of the Arctic Sea, but that the natives\n\n036 | Vol_XI-0143\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views on Northlands\n\nliving on its north European shores may even have obtained the steel for their\n\nharpoons from Persia. For reasons already given, it is unlikely that the Arabs\n\nthemselves reached northern Russia, but the finding of 10th and 11th century\n\nArab coins and trinkets in the Pechora region may mean that Arab-paid inter–\n\nmediaries were in touch with these northern regions at that time.\n\nUnfortunately Arab knowledge of land conditions in the far north was not\n\nmatched by a comparable knowledge of sea conditions. Ab u ū Zaid (c. 920 A.D.),\n\nfor instance, knew no more about the northern ocean than Pliny, for he has a\n\nvessel carried by wind and tide round eastern and northern Asia into the Cas–\n\npian, and on round north Europe into the Mediterranean! The views of Ibn\n\nKhurd a ā dhbih (fl. c. 880 A.D.), equally archaic, are summed up in a couple of\n\nsentences: \"The sea that is behind (i.e. to the north of) the Slavs, and where–\n\non the town ( sic ) of Tulia (i.e.Thule) lies, is not frequented by any ship or\n\nboat, nor does anything come from thence. In like manner none travels upon\n\nthe sea wherein lie the Fortunate Isles, and from thence nothing comes.\" ( Book\n\nof Roads and Provinces ). Ibn Hawqal (fl. c. 950 A.D.) insists on a closed\n\nCaspian Sea, but on little else. Al Mas' u ū d i ī (fl. c. 950 A.D.), for all his\n\nerudition (and few men had traveled more widely), can do no better than argue,\n\non grounds of symmetry, that there is a channel connecting the Sea of Azov with\n\nthe Arctic Sea similar to the one dividing Africa from the unknown, but hypoth–\n\necated, southern continent. Thule, \"which belongs to Britain ( sic ), and where\n\nthe longest day has twenty hours,\" continues to serve as the northern extremity\n\nof the habitable earth, notwithstanding a statement made elsewhere in his Meadows\n\nof Gold to the effect that the western ocean is \"without cultivation or inhabi–\n\ntant, and its end, like its depth, is unknown.\" His confusion of thought on\n\nthis subject is further attested by such conflicting claims as the following:\n\n037 | Vol_XI-0144\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views on Northlands\n\nfirstly, that all the seas (the Indian Ocean, Mediterranean, Black Sea, Sea\n\nof Azov, Caspian and the Atlantic are specified) \"are connected and uninter–\n\nrupted;\" secondly, that the seas \"are in no connection whatever with the Cas–\n\npian Sea;\" and thirdly, that in the extreme north of Europe, there is a vast\n\nlake extending almost to the Pole!\n\nLater Arab writers attempted to tidy up some of Mas' u ū d i ī 's ideas. Al–\n\nB i ī r u ū n i ī (fl. c. 1,000–1,040 A.D.) offered the view that \"the western sea..... runs\n\npast successively the shores.....of Andalusia, Galicia and the Slavs. Then, in\n\nturning north, it goes round the inhabited world and countries behind unknown\n\nmountains north, it goes round the inhabited world and countries behind unsus–\n\npected route as far as the Oriental Sea.....\" With the help of additional scraps\n\nof information, it appears that B i ī r u ū n i ī supposed the margins of the earth to be\n\nindented by five bays, of which the most northerly is described in these words:\n\n\"a great bay to the north of the Slavs (i.e. the Baltic) extends to the vicinity\n\nof the land of the Mohammedan Bulgars (i.e. on the Volga). It is known by the\n\nname of Varangians' Sea, and they (i.e. the Varangians or Scandinavians) are a\n\npeople on its coast. Then it bends to the east in the rear of them, and be–\n\ntween its shores and the uttermost lands of the Turks (i.e. in East Asia) there\n\nare countries and mountains unknown, deserts untrodden.\"\n\nEven the description given by the famous 12th century geographer, Al-Idrisi,\n\nis disappointing, especially when we recall it was written at the court of the\n\nNorman King of Sicily, Roger II, to which come scholars and travelers from al–\n\nmost every part of Christendom and Islam. His geographical treatise, entitled\n\nrather fulsomely Amusement for him who desires to travel round the world , follows\n\nthe Greek \"climatic\" pattern. The northernmost of the seven climata extends to\n\n64° N., beyond which the cold and snow render life impossible. In this northern-\n\n038 | Vol_XI-0145\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views on Northlands\n\nmost zone of the habitable earth he locates \"Islanda,\" \"Denamarkha,\" and\n\n\"Norwaga.\" The description of \"Norwaga\" begins well, but rapidly deteriorates\n\ninto fancy. Its products are few and scarce \"on account of the frequent rain\n\nand continual wet.\" The natives \"sow (corn), but reap it green, whereupon\n\nthey dry it in houses that are warmed, because the sun so seldom shines with\n\nthem. On this island ( sic ) there are trees so great of girth as are not often\n\nfound in other parts. It is said that there are some wild people living in\n\nthe desert regions (of the \"island') who have their heads set immediately upon\n\ntheir shoulders and no neck at all. They resort to trees, and makes their\n\nhouses in their interiors and dwell in them.....\" Further out in the \"Dark\n\nSea\" lies the \"Isle of Illusion,\" inhabited by men of brown colour, small\n\nstature, and with long beards reaching to their knees: they have broad faces\n\nand long ears and live on plants that the earth produces of itself. On the\n\nisland of \"Kalhan\" the people have the body of man, but animal heads. Another\n\nisland was inhabited by female devils.\n\nAll this is in striking contrast to the high intrinsic worth of Idr i ī s i ī 's\n\ndescription of the southern limits of the oikoumene and suggests that he was\n\neither not enough of a scholar to resist the temptation to tickle the fancy\n\nof his readers, or that news of the Viking explorations had hardly begun in\n\nthe 12th century to trickle through to the Mediterranean. Later writers were\n\nnearly all equally confused and ignorant of the real state of affairs. Ibn\n\nSa' i ī d (fl. c. 1260 A.D.) has the polar bear frequenting the seas round Denmark,\n\nand Al-Khazw i ī n i ī (fl. c. 1270 A.D.) believes that in \"Warank\" (i.e. Scandinavia)\n\n\"the cold is excessive, the air thick, and the snow continuous,\" and is con–\n\nsequently \"not suited either for plants or animals.\" Ibn Hab i ī b (better known\n\nas Al-Dimashq i ī (fl. c. 1350 A.D.) has Scandinavia surrounded by \"the frozen sea,\"\n\nso named because \"in winter it freezes entirely, and because it is surrounded\n\n039 | Vol_XI-0146\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views on Northlands\n\nby mountains of ice.\" It is unfortunate that the Arab scholar best fitted\n\nby training and exploration to resolve the problem of terra arctica incognita ,\n\nnamely Ibn Bat u ū ta, should have been so loath to comit to writing his views\n\non the subject.\n\nAs the record stands, the Arabs cannot be said to have made any great\n\ncontribution to the knowledge of the northlands. Their alarmist attitude\n\ntoward the outer ocean, their devotion to the borrowed doctrines of the Greeks,\n\nand their apparent inability to represent geographical concepts in precise\n\ncartographical form were not calculated to encourage exploration for its own\n\nsake, or even to beget an atmosphere of scepticism toward the prevailing postu–\n\nlates.\n\nMeanwhile in Christendom thanks to the renaissance, more healthy-minded\n\nattitudes toward profane learning were slowly developing, but even there the\n\nemergence of a true understanding of the Arctic was distressingly slow.\n\nThe Renaissance Era\n\nInto the origins of the geographical renaissance we cannot now go. Suffice\n\nit to say that the Crusades were more an expression, than a cause of it, for\n\nthere were signs of a stirring among the dry bones already in the 9th and 10th\n\ncenturies. The writings of men like Alfred the Great, Alcuin of York, Scot\n\nE [ ?] rigena, Dicuil and Constantine Porphyrogennetos make this quite apparent. Along\n\nwith other indications of its prior existence, we may note the growing habit,\n\nfrom the 8th century onwards, of pilgrim travel, the kindling of a new mission–\n\nary spirit resulting, inter alia , in the conversion of the Norsemen and a grow–\n\ning inquisitiveness about physical phenomena, whether it be the colours of the\n\nrainbow, the motions of the heavenly bodies, or the cause of earthquakes. Just\n\n040 | Vol_XI-0147\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views on Northlands\n\nhow much of the credit for this intellectual awakening should be given to the\n\nNorsemen is a matter of debate, but that they did succeed in broadening the\n\nhorizons, both mental and geographical, of Christendom, none will deny. Some\n\nwould even endorse the opinion of Beazley given in his Dawn of Modern Geography ,\n\nthat \"the gradual association, incorporation or alliance of the Scandinavians\n\nwith the nations they came to plunder or to destroy, is perhaps the most de–\n\ncisive fact in the story of the Christian Middle Ages, and affords a basis and\n\nstarting-point for every subsequent development. The Crusades, the commercial\n\nand territorial expansion that followed the crusading movement, and the exten–\n\nsion of European spirit and influence toward ultimate predominance in the out–\n\nside world, are related to the formative, provocative and invigorative influ–\n\nence of the northern invasions.\" (Vol. II, p. 3)\n\nIt has to be confessed, however, that before the 13th century, not many\n\nevidences of this awakening are forthcoming from the Mediterranean world. Thus\n\nwe shall look in vain in the cosmographical literature of 11th and 12th century\n\nItaly, France or Spain for radical changes in the standard view of the north–\n\nlands. The Liber Floridus of Lambert St. Omer (c. 1100 A.D.) and the anonymous\n\nDe Imagine Mundi (c. 1100 A.D.) are both in the orthodox patristic tradition.\n\nEven Vincent of Beauvais (c. 1250 A.D.) [ ?] is very reluctant to draw upon\n\ncontemporary sources of information, and frequently he does nothing more than\n\nexcerpt large passages from his authorities, without comment and sometimes even\n\nwithout acknowledgement. Thus, his description of the ocean is purely a recital\n\nof the views of Aristotle, Isidore, De Imagine Mundi and Adelard. The one shin–\n\ning exception, dating from this era, is the Byzantine geographer, Constantine VII,\n\nsurnamed Porphyrogennetos (fl. c. 950 A.D.). His treatise De Administrando Im–\n\nperio abounds in details of contemporary, if not always first hand, information\n\n041 | Vol_XI-0148\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views on Northlands\n\nconcerning the barbarian world lying to the north and northeast of Constan–\n\ntinople. For us, his account of the Russians is particularly interesting.\n\nIndeed, he may be said to have introduced the Russians to the peoples of Chris–\n\ntendom. He knows the names and locations of their chief towns, the distances\n\nbetween them and the route to be taken in going from Novgorod to the Bosphorus.\n\nHe is equally acquainted with the names of the Slavic, Finnish and other tribes\n\nwhich currently paid tribute to the V i king Prince of Kiev. On the other hand,\n\nthere is scarcely a hint of the lands from which this conqueror had come. (It\n\nis conceivable, however, that Constantine had heard from his Russian neighbors\n\na story that was then current among them. According to this, the half-mythical\n\npeople of Gog and Magog were at last on the point of breaking forth from the\n\nmountains of the Pechora region where, so the story ran, they had been living\n\never since the days of Alexander. Although their speech was unintelligible,\n\ntheir intentions sinister, and \"the road to their mountains impassable through\n\nabysses, snow and forests,\" the Russians nevertheless contrived to do trade\n\nwith them in metals and furs.)\n\nThe maritime explorations of the V i kings, meantime, were passing unnoticed\n\nby the main stream of Europeansthought, with the solitary exception of Adam of\n\nBremen whose Gesta Hammaburgensis eoclesiae pontificum (c. 1070 A.D.) did not,\n\nalas, enjoy a circulation in southern Europe.\n\nEven so well-traveled and scholarly a man as the Franciscan Roger Bacon\n\n(fl. c. 1250 A.D.) is more concerned with probing into the past than the pres–\n\nent, although at least he has the wit to realize that knowledge does not always\n\nimprove with keeping. Of Aristotle he says, for instance, that \"he did not\n\nreach the limit of wisdom,\" And elsewhere in his Opus Majus he is willing to\n\nargue that on some matters the inspired writers of the Scriptures were subject\n\n042 | Vol_XI-0149\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of Northlands\n\nto the limitations of their age, for which reason it is unnecessary to \"give\n\nadherence to all that we have heard and read.\" And he is frequently as good as\n\nhis word. Thus he espouses the specious \"continental\" theory of the distribu–\n\ntion of land and water in preference to the much more orthodox \"oceanic\" theory.\n\nAccording to the \"continentalists,\" six parts of the earth were habitable, and\n\nthe seventh covered by water - a view which had been first propounded by the\n\nuncanonical Esdras. More unorthodox still is Bacon's supposition that most of\n\nthis water must be located \"towards the poles of the world\" because those parts\n\nare cold, and cold multiplies moisture, \"from which it follows that the polar\n\nwaters connect with each other by a comperatively narrow sea, called the Ocean,\n\nextending between the end of Spain and the beginning of India.\" (Vol. I, p. 312,\n\nR.B. Burke's translation.) But in taking this line of thought, Bacon clearly\n\nshows himself to have been unaware of the Viking voyages of the 10th and 11th\n\ncenturies: for the two things they demonstrated beyond question were that there\n\nwas plenty of land \"towards the the poles\" and plenty of sea westwards from the end\n\nof Europe. Additional proof of ignorance of their achievements is contained in\n\nthe statement that the northwestern limit of the habitable earth was to be found\n\nin \"the ends of the islands of Scotland and the Kingdom of Norway.\"\n\nIndeed, with the exception of a single reference to the Rubruck expedition,\n\nBacon's regional description of the world could almost have been written by a\n\nman living in the 1st century A.D. Here and there Bacon appears to have known\n\nrather less than some of his classical forebears and to have had no less diffi–\n\nculty in resolving conflicts of testimony. Thus, concerning the Arctic, we are\n\ntold in one place that \" habitation continues up to that locality where the poles\n\nare located : and where the day lasts six months and the night for the same length\n\nof time. Martianus, moreover, in his description of the world, agrees with this\n\nstatement (of Pliny's): whence they maintain that in those regions dwells a very\n\n043 | Vol_XI-0150\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views on Northlands\n\nhappy race which dies only from satiety of life, attaining which it casts\n\nitself from a lofty rock into the sea. These people are called Hyperboreans on the\n\nEuropean side and Arumphei in Asia.\" ( op. cit ., Vol. I, p. 327). Elsewhere\n\nin the same work we are told there is \"( not) any habitation beyond (the Rhipean\n\nmountains) to the north .\" ( op. cit ., Vol. I, p. 377). Even Herodotus was not\n\nguilty of such inconsistencies, and he was considerably better informed.\n\nAs with his great contemporary, Albertus Magnus, Bacon reflected the chang–\n\ning tempo of the age more by his methods than by his material. The thing, above\n\nall others, which distinguishes him from most of his forebears is his discrim–\n\ninating use of sources of information, his critical attitude toward authority\n\nof whatever sanction, and his insistence on the importance of the experimental\n\napproach to science. These may not have yielded immediate fruit, but their in–\n\nfluence on later-day geographers, eg. Richard Eden and John Dee, was very real.\n\nIt will doubtless be asked why so little new northern material found its\n\nway into the standard reference works of these crusading and post-crusading\n\ncenturies, especially when it was available in such works as Adam of Bremen's\n\nGesta and the anonymous Konungskuggsja (or King's Mirror). No simple answer\n\nis possible, but there seem to have been at least two contributory factors, one\n\nlinguistic, and the other ideological. In regard to the first, it must never\n\nbe forgotten that throughout these centuries the language of the Mediterranean\n\nscholar continued to be that of his liturgies. While this may have aided him\n\nin his examination of the lore of the past, it was a distinct handicap in other\n\nrespects, for it meant that he was seldom able to communicate with the laity,\n\nor they with him. In the circumstances, it would be foolish to look for any\n\nrapid dissemination of current geographical talk. True, the mendicant and\n\npreaching orders were not so hampered, but unfortunately for posterity, few of\n\n044 | Vol_XI-0151\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views on Northlands\n\nthem had a notion to commit their ideas to parchment.\n\nThe ideological factor operated less directly, but none the less potently.\n\nParadoxically enough, one of the most striking evidences of the re-birth of\n\nlearning during these centuries was not a love of novelty, whether in liter–\n\nature, science or art, but a return to a love of the real classics. The fresh–\n\nly recovered lore of ancient Greece and Rome was welcomed not only as supply–\n\ning new and superior standards of expression, but as disclosing a new concep–\n\ntion of life, one which gave ampler scope to the play of the emotions, to the\n\nsense of beauty, and to the entire round of intellectual activity. And so, for\n\nthe second time in a millennium, men's thoughts and endeavors were directed\n\nmore to the contemplation of the past than the exploration of the present. In\n\nthe huge 14th century encyclopedia, Fons Memorabilium Universi , of Dominicus\n\nBandinus of Arezzo, men like Archimedes, Aristotle and Agathocles are given\n\nmore than a page apiece, while Marco Polo is dismissed in three lines, and\n\nPeter Abelard and Albertus Magnus are not so much as mentioned.\n\nThe works of Dante, which, to the thinking of many, represent the quintes–\n\nsence of renaissance thought, show a similar preoccupation. His geographical\n\nsystem is essentially a hotch-potch of ideas, few of them being less than a\n\nthousand years old! On the extent of the oikoumene (\"gran secca\") all that he\n\ncan tell us is that its length is such that \"at the equinox the sun is setting\n\nfor those who are at one of these boundaries, when it is rising for those who\n\nare at the other,\" i.e. 180°, and that it extends northward as far as those\n\nwhose zenith is a circle described through the pole of the zodiac round the\n\npole of the earth as a center, that is, the Arctic Circle, and from this he\n\nconcludes, rather gratuitously, as it would seem, that \"the emergent earth or\n\ndry land must have the appearance of a half moon or thereabouts.\" On the de-\n\n045 | Vol_XI-0152\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views of Northlands\n\nscriptive side, he likewise knows no more than the writers of Antiquity. At\n\nthe northern extremity of his habitable earth, in the vicinity of the Rhipean\n\nMountains, he places the venerable Scythians who \"suffer extreme inequality of\n\ndays and night and are oppressed with intolerable cold.\" ( De Monarchia , I,\n\nxiv.) Eastwards, the River Ganges and westwards the \"isles of Gades\" comprise\n\nthe longitudinal limits of the oikoumene , exactly as they had done for Orosius\n\nand his authorities.\n\nFourteenth and early fifteenth century writers of more strictly geograph–\n\nical texts, such as Pierre d'Ailly of Cambrai, make equally short shrift of the\n\nnorthlands and their inhabitants. \"Beyond Thule, the last island of the Ocean,\n\nafter one day's sail, the sea is frozen and stiff. At the poles there live\n\ngreat ghosts and ferocious beasts, the enemies of man. Water abounds there,\n\nbecause those places are cold, and \"cold multiplies humours (i.e. vapours).\"\n\n( Tractatus de Imagine Mundi , Chapter VII.) It was not until the middle of the\n\n15th century that we find any reference in southern European literature (in a\n\nletter written to Pope Nicholas V) to Eskimos, and even then they are badly\n\nmisrepresented - as pygmies, a cubit or so high who \"when they see human beings\n\ncollect and hide themselves in the caves (igloos?) of the country like a swarm\n\nof ants.\"\n\nWhile it is undeniably true that most of the scholars and the artists of\n\nthe Renaissance were too busy exhuming ancient knowledge to develop a distinc–\n\ntive cosmography of their own, the situation was rather different with the merch–\n\nants and mariners of the time. Tales, some likely and others much less so, were\n\ncoming out of the North from time to time, as from every other quarter of the\n\ncompass, and although few of them were written down, the gist of many was trans–\n\nlated into cartographical form. Fortunately, a man does not need to have a\n\n046 | Vol_XI-0153\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views on Northlands\n\nclassical education to be able to draw a map.\n\nThe North in Mediaeval Maps\n\nIt is in the maps of the period, therefore, that we must look for the\n\nfullest expression of Mediterranean opinion concerning the Northlands. Indeed,\n\nit is probable that in any given century we can get a closer approximation to\n\nthe views of the ordinary educated man by glancing at the mappa mundi of that\n\ncentury than by ploughing through the pages of a hundred encyclopedias. True\n\nsome of these mappa mundi were in the nature of illustrations for the encyclo–\n\npedias, but this does not seriously invalidate our contention since the affin–\n\nity between text and map is frequently so slight as to be questionable. In\n\npoint of fact most of the maps dating from the renaissance period originated\n\ndifferently. Some were drawn to order for a merchant prince: others were com–\n\nposed by sea-going men for their own practical use: others to illustrate instruc–\n\ntion in the elements of world geography. But whatever their origin, they had\n\nthis much in common, namely, that once they were in circulation, the ideas ex–\n\npressed in them stood to gain currency at a faster rate than those set forth\n\nin the ponderous tomes of the day, for pictures (and most mediaeval maps are\n\nlittle more) make a readier and more abiding impression on the mind than the\n\nwritten word. Then, again, it required much less courage (and effort) to change\n\na map than a manuscript. To \"doctor\" a coastline of northern Europe based osten–\n\nsibly on Ptolemy or Strabo was one thing: to go on record as saying that Ptolemy\n\nor Strabo were palpably in error when they described the said coastline was quite\n\nanother. That mediaeval maps were frequently touched up, or modified when copied\n\nto conform to the ideas of the artist or his patron, is well known. Thus there\n\nis a notable discrepancy in the treatment of Scandinavia as between the Paris\n\nmanuscript and the other versions of the world map accompanying Marino Suando's\n\n047 | Vol_XI-0154\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediteranean Views on Northlands\n\nLiber Secretorium fidelium crucis : in the former, Scandinavia is portrayed\n\nas an archipelago, while in all the others it is represented correctly as a\n\nmountainous peninsula connected with the mainland of northern Europe by a\n\nnarrow isthmus and divided into the lands of \"Gotilandia,\" \"Dacia,\" \"Suetia,\"\n\nand \"Norvega.\" The equally famous Laurentian world map of c. 1350 shows signs\n\nof having been edited at least twice. Another point that needs to be borne\n\nin mind is the ease with which the lineaments of a map can be recalled and\n\nreproduced by any ordinarily observant person adept in the use of the quill.\n\n(One of the two outlines of southern Africa on the Laurentian map seems to have\n\nbeen drawn from a recollection of the 1413 A.D. world map of Albertin Da Virga.)\n\nFor reasons of this kind, we believe that the geographical ideas of later\n\nmediaeval students were more influenced by maps than books, and that the pop–\n\nular renaissance view of any given region was most likely to find contemporary\n\nexpression in the same medium. To a lesser extent, no doubt, the argument\n\nmight be said to hold good for the earlier centuries, but the further back we\n\ngo, the greater was the thralldom of clerical orthodoxy, and the greater the\n\nimpediments to travel and the ready exchange of ideas.\n\nBroadly, the maps of the Middle Ages fall into two major categories: those\n\nwhich pay special attention to the dicta of the past, and those which seek to\n\nportray things as they are, or were thought to be on currently acceptable grounds.\n\nIn the former category we can include the Beatus maps, the numerous T-in-O\n\ntype maps and those more elaborate ecclesiastic maps such as the Hereford, the\n\nEbstorf and the Psalter. In none of these is any real attempt made to present\n\nthe then-known northern limits of knowledge. In the Osma copy, the last of the\n\nten survivors, of the Beatus map (c. 1203) the only concession to the times is\n\nthe insertion of Scandinavia - as an island albeit. The Ebstorf map of 1284 is\n\n048 | Vol_XI-0155\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views on Northlands\n\nno better. On the Hereford map of about the same date Scandinavia is correct–\n\nly shown as a peninsula, but more, it would appear, by luck than judgment,\n\nsince Scotland, about which an English cleric might be expected to be reason–\n\nably well informed, is portrayed as an island! By and large, the authors of\n\nthese maps were more interested in mythical than in real lands. Neither Green–\n\nland nor Wineland is mentioned, but considerable prominence is given to the\n\nlands of the Cynocephalae, the Hyperboreans and the Arumphei. Ranulf Higden's\n\nmap of the world dating from the first half of the 14th century is fettered by\n\nthe wheel-form in whch it is cast. In the very narrow ocean which girdles the\n\ndisc of the earth we find rather less than the usual complement of real and\n\nmythical islands. \"Norwegia,\" \"Islandia,\" and \"Witland\" with \"gens ydolatra\"\n\nare located off the coast of northern Europe: \"Tile (Thule) and \"Dacia\" (Den–\n\nmark) with \"gens bellicosa\" somewhere near the North Pole. In the various\n\neditions of Higden's map \"Witland\" is also called \"Wintlandia\" and \"Wineland.\"\n\nIt is possibly connected with the Norse Wineland story, but as it is mentioned\n\ntogether with Dacia, Nansen thinks it may be a corruption of \"Windland\" (i.e.\n\nFinland), the inhabitants of which sold winds to the sailors who came to them!\n\nAlready in Adam of Bremen the Finns (Lapps) had been described as particularly\n\nskilled in magic.\n\nIf this is the best that the cartographers of northwest Europe can offer\n\nprior to the 15th century, it is hardly to be expected that those of the Medi–\n\nterranean region should have been any better informed. Yet is is in the Medi–\n\nterranean that the finest cartographic product of the renaissance, the compass\n\nchart, first made its appearance, and with it the nort h lands first began to take\n\nrecognizable shape.\n\nThe need for a practical map which would enable a sailor to find his way\n\nfrom port to port had been long-standing. When coasting was to some extent\n\n049 | Vol_XI-0156\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views on Northlands\n\nreplaced by sailing in open sea after the compass came in use during the 13th\n\ncentury, sea charts became a necessary adjunct to the written sailing direc–\n\ntions or portolani . How early, or exactly where, they began to be employed\n\nis unknown: we only know that such charts were coming into use on Italian ships\n\nby the second half of the 13th century, and that by 1300 A.D. they had reached\n\na remarkable level of technical excellence. At first these portolan charts\n\ndid not normally extend beyond the maritime sphere of the peoples concerned,\n\nor, if they did, the delineation of the unfrequented coastlines was of a very\n\ndifferent caliber from the rest of the map. Thus on the early portolan charts\n\nthe detailed portrayal of the west coast of Europe stops abruptly in the lati–\n\ntude of the Low Countries. Further north than this the Italian shipmasters\n\nwere un- wont to sail, for fear, it seems, of coming into conflict with the commer–\n\ncial fleets of the Hanseatic League. It is not surprising, then, that in north–\n\nern England, Scotland, Ireland, north coast of Denmark, Scandinavia and the\n\nBaltic countries place-names are very few by comparison with those along the\n\nmore southerly stretches of coast, or that coastlines are drawn in schematically\n\nand not from actual compass courses and reckonings. Even at that, they were\n\nmuch better than those of the T-in-O or Beatus types, and represented a de–\n\ncisive forward step in the direction of reality. We know little of the sources\n\nfrom which these Italian and later the Catalan, draughtsmen derived their mater–\n\nial, but it is unlikely that they were numerous, for one portolan chart looks\n\nvery much like another, even to its errors.\n\nThe Carignano chart of c. 1300 A.D., although one of the oldest extant\n\nexamples of the compass chart, is very little different in general appearance,\n\nfrom those of fifty or even a hundred years later. In it, the west coast of\n\nGermany and Jutland runs due north from Flanders, thus reducing the North Sea\n\n050 | Vol_XI-0157\n\nEA-History. Kimble: Early Mediterranean Views on Northlands\n\nto the dimensions of the English Channel. The shape of Jutland is commendable,\n\nas is that of the British Isles. However, the portrayal of the northern re–\n\ngions is palpably inferior to that of most later charts. The Baltic extends\n\nfar to the east, and is devoid of anything that could conceivably be character–\n\nized as the Gulf of Bothnia. Whether his Scandinavia is a peninsula, as usual–\n\nly asserted, or a rather long island is uncertain, since the map is in a poor\n\nstate of preservation, and is indistinct in the inner part of the Baltic.
