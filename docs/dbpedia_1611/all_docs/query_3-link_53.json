        "text": "To the ends of the Earth and in the heart of Russian Scandinavia!\n\nWe meet the recommended flights at Murmansk airport and go to the hotel located on the main square of the city â the square of Five Corners.\n\nAccording to our tradition, a bottle of sparkling wine with fruits will be waiting for you in the room to relax after the flight and tune in to a beautiful and bright vacation!\n\nWe have a little rest and in the evening we meet for a welcome dinner at a very tasty northern restaurant!Â\n\nWe are waiting for the author's cuisine of the Tundra in an unusual design.\n\nFor an appetizer, we will taste dried venison with mustard cream.\n\nFor the hot meal, we will be served the back of Arctic cod with pike caviar, trout, halibut and black risotto.\n\nOf course, with a wine accompaniment that perfectly emphasizes the shades of flavors!\n\nAnd at the end of the dinner, we will try the signature cake from the brand chef \"cloudberry and cedar under the snow\" with a cup of taiga tea.\n\nAll meals are already included in the price of the tour, you just need to relax and enjoy!\n\nA delicious, wine-filled and spiritual journey to the ends of the Earth is declared open! Hurray!\n\nBreakfast is waiting for us at our hotel in the morning.\n\nAnd we are setting ourselves up for a very eventful, beautiful day!\n\nFirst, we are going to get acquainted with Murmansk â the largest city in the world, located beyond the Arctic Circle!\n\nMurmansk is called the \"Arctic Hollywood\", so many films have been shot here! We will visit all the iconic places of the city and take a short walk around the center.Â\n\nWe will see the cabin of the Kursk submarine (the real one), go up to the monument to the defenders of the Arctic â Murmansk Alyosha, go to the seaport.\n\nThe tour will take place by minibus, we will not walk long distances.

You definitely won't cook such dishes for yourself â these are all author's recipes!Â\n\nNorthern cuisine is famous for unexpected, but very tasty combinations. So, what awaits us?\n\nFor an aperitif â freshly caught sea urchin with cloudberry sauce.Â\n\nServed on a plate with crushed ice with a glass of sparkling wine.Â\n\nThen a scallop baked on a shell with grated parmesan and Philadelphia cream cheese.Â\n\nServed with a shot of strong tincture of northern berries.Â\n\nThere is a real highlight for the hot dish!Â\n\nThe brand chef marinates venison in lingonberries and red wine with us and prepares steaks.Â\n\nIt is served with apple cream and mushroom sauce with a glass of red full-bodied wine.Â\n\nFor dessert, a sorbet of northern berries with cloudberry jam, yagel chips and mushroom caramel.Â\n\nDuring the master class, the chef will share with us all the cooking secrets, and we will start tasting our Arctic dishes!Â\n\nIn the afternoon, we will drive over the longest bridge in the Arctic â across the Kola Bay, and find ourselves on its other shore.\n\nWe will visit Abram Cape, a settlement that became part of Murmansk. It offers an incredible panorama of the Kola Bay and Murmansk.\n\nThen we will take a close look at oceanic ships and naval vessels.\n\nYou can also go down to the water here, because there is no embankment in Murmansk.\n\nWe're going to dinner!\n\nThey will be waiting for us at the best author's restaurant in the Arctic, which is also included in the Gastronomic map of Russia.Â\n\nThe brand chef of the establishment creates original concepts of Arctic cuisine according to his own rules, combining an innovative approach and old traditions.\n\nWe will try Arctic fish soup on crab \"milk\" with Kamchatka crab meat, seafood and Murmansk scallops on the \"sand\" of the Barents Sea with oyster grass. The dishes are accompanied by a tasting set of four signature infusions of northern berries. Chin chin!\n\nAnd the end of the dinner will be the author's dessert of the restaurant â Arctic blancmange with northern blueberries and raspberries, which is served with taiga tea.\n\nLet's go back to the hotel and relax!\n\nToday, after breakfast, we will visit the brewery that has set the world record for \"The northernmost commercial brewery in the world\"!\n\nOn the tour, we will get acquainted with all the stages of brewing: we will visit the crushing shop, bottling beer in kegs and bottles and the fermentation shop.Â\n\nAt the end of the tour, we will be invited to a tasting of all currently relevant varieties produced by the brewery! Then we go to the very edge of the Earth â to Teriberka.Â\n\nA unique place on the coast of the Arctic Ocean. Then only the ocean and the North Pole!Â\n\nTeriberka is the only place in Russia that can be reached by road to see the Arctic Ocean.Â\n\nIt's not a quick way, but it's worth it! Do not forget, the warming tincture is always with us!Â\n\nAfter reaching Teriberka, we will have lunch at a restaurant overlooking the ocean. We will be served sea fish soup and grilled Murmansk cod steak.\n\nThen we check into a hotel right on the shore of the Barents Sea. With panoramic views of the picturesque cliffs and hills, and the sea bay. Salty air, silence and a sense of peace will be your constant companions. You will feel the amazing magic of this place!Â\n\nAfter a short rest in the room, we go for a walk and get acquainted with the old Teriberka, swing on the famous swing, listen to the sound of the waves of the Arctic Ocean.Â\n\nWe will walk through the filming locations of the movie \"Leviathan\" and see a stranded ship.Â\n\nAfter a walk through Teriberka, a northern sauna will be organized for us.
