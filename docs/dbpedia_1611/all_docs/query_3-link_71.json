        "text": "Murmansk is a Barents Sea cruise port and city in Murmansk Oblast (northwestern Russia), located on both banks of Kola Bay (fjord). in the north of Kola Peninsula in the Arctic Ocean. The city is approx 108 km (67 mi) from the Russia-Norway border and approx 182 km (113 mi) from the Russia-Finland border. This is world's largest town located north of Arctic Circle, with population around 310,000.\n\nPrior to WW1 (1914-1918), this was a small fishing village. In 1915, it became supply port and then navy base for French, British and US forces. Murmansk served as main seaport for Anglo-American convoys during WW2 91939-1945), carrying supplies to USSR (Soviet Union) through the Arctic Ocean.\n\nPort Murmansk is deep-water and ice-free, making it Russia's only seaport with unrestricted Atlantic Ocean access the whole year-round (unlike St Petersburg). It is also homeport for Russian nuclear icebreakers (the world's only nuclear-powered icebreaker fleet operated by Atomflot). Murmansk is also Arctic Bridge's terminus (sea route linking to Churchill, Manitoba Canada) - a major shipping route connecting Asia and Europe.\n\nThe city features 2 large museums, an aquarium, 3 professional theatres. In 1974, a 35,5 m (116 ft) tall Alyosha statue was installed on a 7 m (23 ft) high foundation. Hotel Arctic aka Azimut Hotel Murmansk) was opened in 1984 and is currently the tallest building above the Arctic Circle.\n\nOn June 21, 2018, Port Murmansk was visited by its ever-largest cruise ship MS Braemar (owned by Fred Olsen). With Braemar, the Russian city visted a total of 757 passengers and 394 crew. The liner operated on 16-day \"Arctic Russia and Northern Norway cruise (itinerary June 12-28) roundtrip from UK (Southampton).\n\nDate / TimePort12 JunDeparting from Southampton, England15 JunAlesund, Norway16 JunTrondheim, Norway18 JunTromso, Norway19 JunHonningsvag, Mageroya Island, Norway20 JunKirkenes, Norway21 JunMurmansk23 JunHarstad, Hinnoya Island, Norway25 JunKristiansund, Norway28 JunArriving in Southampton, England\n\nAfter the port city is named the 2015-built icebreaker Murmansk.\n\nIn 2015, the Port's main docking pier underwent a major refurbishment to allow berthing for larger vessels (with max LOA length up to 195 m / 645 ft)."
