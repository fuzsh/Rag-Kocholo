        "text": "The Idler\n\nAn idle lingerer on the wayside’s road,\n\nHe gathers up his work and yawns away;\n\nA little longer, ere the tiresome load\n\nShall be reduced to ashes or to clay.\n\nNo matter if the world has marched along,\n\nAnd scorned his slowness as it quickly passed;\n\nNo matter, if amid the busy throng,\n\nHe greets some face, infantile at the last.\n\nHis mission? Well, there is but one,\n\nAnd if it is a mission he knows it, nay,\n\nTo be a happy idler, to lounge and sun,\n\nAnd dreaming, pass his long-drawn days away.\n\nSo dreams he on, his happy life to pass\n\nContent, without ambitions painful sighs,\n\nUntil the sands run down into the glass;\n\nHe smiles – content – unmoved and dies.\n\nAnd yet, with all the pity that you feel\n\nFor this poor mothling of that flame, the world;\n\nAre you the better for your desperate deal,\n\nWhen you, like him, into infinitude are hurled?\n\nThis week, we are revisiting the Harlem Renaissance poets with an early work by Alice Dunbar Nelson, a writer who went on to play an important part in the movement in the 1920s and 30s. She is also known as Alice Dunbar-Nelson, Alice Moore Dunbar Nelson, and Alice Ruth Dunbar Nelson.\n\nShe was born Alice Ruth Moore in 1875 in New Orleans: her African-American mother, a former slave, worked as a seamstress and her Creole father was a seaman. American biographers describe the family as “middle class”: British terminology would probably prefer “skilled working class”. Not impoverished, but a long way from privilege, the Moores would no doubt have encouraged belief in a strong work-ethic in their children.\n\nDunbar Nelson attended Straight University and initially became a teacher. Her literary achievements were many and varied and included poetry, short stories, essays and journalism, the latter being the medium most suited to her later political activism. She was married three times, the first time to the poet Paul Laurence Dunbar.\n\nHer debut publication, a miscellany of poems and stories, Violets and Other Tales, appeared when she was only 20. The Idler comes from that collection. The sympathetic portrait reveals the young writer’s independence of class- or faith-bound moral judgments – and a bold though unobtrusive use of metrical variation to express character and action.\n\nA simple, sensuous, dreamy type of working man, the protagonist has no “mission” beyond an easy, happy life. The first quatrain introduces him vividly, evoking his pace, leisurely and a little weary, with the repeated “l” sound of “idle lingerer” and “a little longer” and the stretched vowels and slow consonants of “yawns away”. The latter is an interesting phrase: adding “away” to a verb usually implies repeated action (we “tap away” at our keyboards, for example) but here there’s also the suggestion of a larger movement, so we can picture the man walking off as he repeatedly yawns. The details about the nature of the load he carries are important. It’s stuff that will undergo industrial processing of some kind. But “ash” and “clay” might also suggest death, and a certain calm fatalism in the man’s character. This idea will be developed later.\n\nIn the second stanza, he’s described as “infantile at the last” (the description applicable to him rather than the face he greets). The word infantile may be read as neutrally descriptive or, more compellingly, as a judgment someone other than the speaker would make. The goal-directed “busy throng” reminds the poet, ominously, of a quick-marching army. But the innocent idler singles out from that unseeing, mechanical throng a familiar human face, and greets him or her with unforced pleasure.\n\nSmall changes to the established iambic pentameter first occur in the third stanza. The first line (“His mission? Well, there is but one”) drops from five to four beats, suggesting brisk dismissal of the whole notion of a mission. Or perhaps, after the abrupt question, “His mission?”, the reader is asked to pause for a silent beat, a thought before the reply, heralded by the colloquial “Well …” The reply itself is emphatically phrased, possibly amused in tone: “And if it is a mission he knows it, nay.” An extra beat in “To be a happy idler, to lounge and sun” once more slows us down and lets us stretch ourselves like – well – happy idlers when the working day is done.\n\nIn the fourth stanza, the fatalism of the idler as he calmly meets his death translates as superior spiritual wisdom, perhaps, but it hints also at the harshness of the man’s life. We’re asked to include silence in the pulse of the last line, the dashes marking the points at which to pause, and share the slow smile, the sensation of release.\n\nHe’s an unworldly person: so, in the description of him as “this poor mothling of that flame, the world”, the term “world” is initially surprising. This world can’t be identified entirely with that earlier one that “marched” past him “and scorned his slowness”. Rather, it’s the bodily, instinctive world of the senses. The lovely word “mothling” suggests a soft, blind blundering movement: the flame feels gentle, seductive, its violence incomprehensible. This is a world of warmth and light registered on the skin, not the world of the go-getter, the maker of the “desperate deal”.\n\nThose social sinners, the idle poor, would have been scolded in conventional, didactic poems of the time. Dunbar Nelson’s speaker instead directs her challenge to “you”, the imagined reader, or even herself – the struggler for empowerment and radical social change (“desperate deals” need not be only financial). The moral angle in the poem is finally pragmatic. The gentle mothlings and the driven workers will become “ashes” or “clay”, and there’s no more suggestion of ensuing redemption for the idler than there is of punishment.\n\nNote: I’ve kept the punctuation common to all the texts I’ve read: suspiciously semi-colon-heavy, it’s probably not the poet’s original. I’ve also avoided the temptation to add an apostrophe to “ambitions” in “ambitions painful sighs” in case the original intention was to list two objects, “ambitions, sighs” rather than “ambition’s sighs”."
