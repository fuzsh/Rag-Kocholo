        "text": "In the twilight hour between daylight and darkness, on what had been another sunny Monday in Phnom Penh, soon after the sun sank behind the sloping roofs of the Royal Palace where swarms of sleepy pigeons sat to roost, the funeral pyre of King-Father Norodom Sihanouk was ignited for sacred cremation.\n\nBeside the Royal Palace, Sihanouk’s body lay at rest in the Veal Preah Mein, the king’s crematorium of elegant white walls and elaborate golden roofs wherein robed monks sat in ceaseless prayer. I stood across the street from the tall front gate in a crowd of some 30 bewildered journalists uniformly dressed in white button-up shirts and black slacks as we waited with cameras ready for the flames to rise.\n\nMy white shirt was my ticket to stand among the uniformed journalists. The only noticeable differences between us were the official-looking press passes and expensive-looking cameras hung around their necks, while I stood holding an iPad. My shirt was not as crisp as it had been the day I bought it four days earlier for $11 at a men’s clothing shop near my guesthouse. Now wrinkles overcame the garment’s starch-white freshness and a brown tinge of sweat and dirt had worked up inside the collar and along the creases of my sleeves, rolled up as I walked in the heat of the sun.\n\nStanding among the journalists, a Cambodian reporter asked me what paper I was with.\n\n“I didn’t see your I.D.,” she said.\n\nThe young lady stood no higher than my shoulder with what looked like a Canon Rebel strung around her neck, her curious eyes inspecting me through black-frame glasses.\n\n“What I.D.?” I replied with a coy smile.\n\nThe King Who Lies in the Diamond Urn\n\nOn holiday from my university in China, I had traveled to Cambodia for the warmer weather, and to escape the noise and chaos of 1.3 billion Chinese celebrating their Spring Festival. But as fate would have it, my plane from Kunming would arrive in Phnom Penh only a few days before the king’s weeklong funeral was to begin on Feb.1. And like most westerners who travel Southeast Asia for the first time without a Lonely Planet guidebook, I had arrived in Cambodia ignorant of both the country and its culture — but willing to learn.\n\nOne day outside the Royal Palace I met a young man dressed in the standard funeral attire of white shirt, black slacks. He held a slick Samsung Galaxy 111 phone, and introduced himself as the son-in-law of the Second Governor of Phnom Penh. When I told him how little I knew about Cambodian history, he happily told me a brief history of his country and the deceased king.\n\n“He is a hero. He is King-Father,” said Srorn Vannet. “He brought back freedom from France in 1954.”\n\nSihanouk’s first term as King of Cambodia began in 1941, when Cambodia was still a colony of French Indochina. But in 1954, King Sihanouk famously outwitted the French, winning independence for his country. He soon abdicated the throne to his father, the previous king, and took up the title of Prime Minister of Cambodia.\n\n“And [Sihanouk] developed everything in Cambodia,” Vannet said. “Even the economy, even the culture — Everything.”\n\nSihanouk often changed political titles. However, he effectively ruled the country until 1970, when he was deposed and the new Khmer Republic took control. Indeed, Cambodian history in the 20th century wasn’t all smiles and roses. Vannet mentions the 1979 documentary, Year Zero: The Silent Death of Cambodia, which recounts the U.S. bombing of Cambodia in 1970 and the later genocide led by Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge militia.\n\n“Everybody’s dead everywhere,” Vannet said. “It’s so sad.”\n\nAfter 13 years in exile, Sihanouk regained the throne, ruling once again as King of Cambodia in 1993. A decade later, he again abdicated the throne, this time in favor of his eldest son, Norodom Sihamoni, the current king, who had once been a ballet coach.\n\nI soon learned that the King-Father Norodom Sihanouk had died of a heart attack nearly four months prior on Oct. 15 in a hospital in Beijing — just weeks before his 90th birthday. Sihanouk had lived out his final days in a North Korean palace in Pyongyang and later in Beijing, where he received medical treatment for his ailing body.\n\nMoreover, Sihanouk is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the politician having had the greatest variety of political offices. When he abdicated the throne in favor of his son in 2004, he took up the title of King-Father. Upon his death, Sihanouk’s body was paraded through the streets of Phnom Penh to the Royal Palace in a vehicle the shape of a mythical golden bird. And King Sihamoni anointed his father with one last title, which translated from the Khmer reads, “The King who lies in the Diamond Urn.”\n\nBut before I learned anything about Sihanouk, I could see how his people had loved him.\n\nChasing Pigeons, Releasing the Birds\n\nSince Sihanouk’s funeral began on Friday, the country’s mourning had reached a long-awaited climax. Continual masses of mourners, wearing sandals and white shirts pinned with black ribbons, walked the streets of Phnom Penh, their hands full of white lotus flowers and gold-framed portraits of the beloved King-Father. At nearly every corner in the center of the city uniformed guards manned roadblocks to prevent car, scooter and tuk tuk traffic, while monks and mourners alike squeezed between the metal road barriers, in their pilgrimage to and from the Royal Palace to pay their final respects to the king.\n\nOn Thursday, I strolled across the wide public lawn in front of the Royal Palace and observed the mourners who had traveled to their capitol city from all over the country, many perhaps for the first time. Groups of young Buddhist monks dressed in orange robes snapped pictures with smartphones. City peasants sold sticks of incense, lotus flowers and hand-made pins with the king’s portrait, which everyone was wearing. Energetic and unsupervised, small children chased pigeons on the lawn until they collapsed in the grass, exhausted and empty handed.\n\nMeanwhile the city’s population continued to grow as peasants from the countryside arrived by the truckload, packed into the large beds of their work vehicles where normally vegetables or chickens might be piled.\n\nOutside the Royal Palace, I paid a man $2 to release a few finches from a cage he held on the curb where he was squatting. Putting down his cigarette on the curb, he pulled two small sickly birds from the cage and thrust them at me with a half-toothy smile. I humbly reclined the offer, fearing avionic flu. Finally the vendor released the birds for his own good luck or blessing.\n\nPraising the Past and Fancying the Future\n\nI stood on a fenced-off side street between the Royal Palace and the Veal Preah Mein, peering in over the fence at the cremation grounds, when a young Cambodian man approached me speaking English. As we talked, I asked his opinion of the deceased king.\n\n“He was a very talented man. He spoke 10 languages,” said Bin Yan, 21, from Stung Treng province. “He [was] a writer, composer, politician, king, and musician all in one person.”\n\nLiving with the monks in a nearby wat, Yan is a political science freshman at Pannasastra University of Cambodia in Phnom Penh — and very ambitious. The class president, he plays the violin, guitar and piano, and claims to speak five languages — Cambodian, Laos, Thai, Chinese and English. “And a little French,” he said.\n\nDuring the week, Yan is a deejay at a local radio station. But he has bigger plans for his future.\n\n“I want to be prime minister of Cambodia,” Yan said. “That’s my goal — [to be] leader of this country.”\n\nAnd what would he do?\n\n“I want to change Cambodia to be the richest country in Asia — that’s my plan.”\n\nTo become the prime minister of Cambodia is a lofty goal for Yan, who is not descended from either the Norodoms or the Sisowaths, of which the late Sihanouk was born. The two royal families have maintained a ruling grip on the country for centuries, surviving the government upheavals of the 20th century.\n\nFor all his praise of the past and political ambition, the young Yan is not free from western influence. After all, Cambodia is a country that trades its own currency along with U.S. dollars, which can be withdrawn from the ATMs.\n\n“Abraham Lincoln is my hero,” Yan said.\n\nClimbing a Barrier to Greener Pastures\n\nOn Monday, the day of Sihanouk’s cremation, the mourning masses were blocked from entering center of the city where the streets were swept clean and silent, and where along the riverbank canons were set up to fire into the sky at sundown.\n\nIt had been easy enough to climb over a road barrier following a small group of other westerners whose guesthouse fortunately fell within the grounds of the Royal Palace area. A company of soldiers in charge of the canons was at ease sitting in a row on a concrete ledge alongside the riverbank. They were enjoying the nice weather and peacefulness of the city center without swarms of people and duties to perform.\n\nCautiously, I strolled on across the street to the great green lawn in front of the Royal Palace where days earlier I watched crowds from all over the country publicly mourn their deceased king, praying en masse and burning heaps of incense, as children chased flocks of pigeons, which dashed through the sky like gray confetti. Now the palace lawn was vacant but for the pigeons resting in the grass, cooing gently. As the sun reached the top of the palace roof, a golden light fell over the lawn and the chanting of monks, broadcast on loudspeakers, echoed through the air.\n\nThe Lighting of the Funeral Pyre\n\nA call went through the crowd of journalists — no photography for five minutes out of respect for the King-Father. Cameras were switched off and hung around our necks or pointed at the ground. A few impatient westerners scoffed into the silence as the whole city held its breath. But we were not alone. Over our shoulders a few mourners had crept in among us and began to openly wail. In an instant, cameras clicked back on and journalists turned inward to capture the pitiless emotion.\n\nA barefooted, elderly monk wearing an orange robe and walking with a cane sat down on the sidewalk and began to pray. Suddenly a crowd of people gathered to kneel before the old monk holding small paper bills and asking for his Buddhist blessing. The scene went on this way for nearly 20 minutes as a few distracted journalists snapped photos with their flash cameras.\n\nMeanwhile the Sihanouk’s funeral pyre had been lit and clouds of sacred white smoke billowed from the inner chamber of the crematorium where his body now lay burning. The remaining tint of daylight drained from the sky and strands of golden lights illuminated the buildings against the deepening shadows of dusk.\n\nScattered Ashes and Sandal Culture\n\nWith the ashes of King Father Norodom Sihanouk scattered in the Mekong River, the flow of life in Phnom Penh returned to its normal pace — a pace that, over the course of his lifetime, Sihanouk had helped to create.\n\nThe guards looked sleepy and restless and ready to leave their assigned street corners. Then, at midweek, the barriers opened up throughout the city center. Endless streams of motor scooters and tuk tuks flowed back into the narrow one-lane streets again and shops reopened for business.\n\nWhen the sun was down, shadows fell a little darker over the city — western tourists crowded the bars again to guzzle mugfuls of Angkor beer while sleepy tuk tuk drivers waited patiently outside, and women on motor scooters approached men walking to their guesthouses beneath streetlamps.\n\nMonks returned to their wats, peasants to their farms in the countryside and students to their universities. The locals unbuttoned their white shirts and had them dry-cleaned for rare future use on special occasions. The young men also changed into clean slacks and exchanged their soiled white button-ups for clean, collared shirts, as did the young women, who changed their skirts. Nobody changed his or her sandals.\n\nMy friend Matthew Padgett, who has visited the country several times, best describes the Cambodian mindset:\n\n“It’s an attitude that says, ‘I’m not in hurry to get where I’m going, so I’m wearing sandals. I’m going to take it easy while the sun is still shining.’”\n\nSo Cambodia’s “sandal culture” endures, as perhaps it always has and always will.\n\n###"
