In 1947 he introduced a new constitution with an elective assembly and manhood suffrage, except for Buddhist priests and soldiers who were disenfranchised. In March 1955 the KLing abdicated in favour of his parents, entered politics and founded the Sangkum (Popular Socicdist Community) Party. In the elections of 1955, '58, '62 and '66 the Sangkum won all the seats in the assembly. His father died in April i960 and the royal powers were then vested in a Council of Regency imtil June i960 when Sihanouk became Head of State without becoming king. He was deposed in March 1970 and now lives in exile. Wilfred Burchett was bom in 191 1 in Axistralia and has been recognized over the last thirty years as a specialist in Asian affairs and has spent nineteen years in South-East Asia and in China. During the war he was war correspondent for the Daily Express reporting for the Asian and Pacific theatres. In 1955 the Australian government revoked his passport because of his opinions on the Korean and Vietnam wars.

In the pages that follow, the Cambodian Head of State, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, chronicles the background, from his first fateful meetings in the mid-1950s with the brothers Dulles, heading the US State Department and the CIA respectively, until the coup of 18 March 1970. The account is classic for its description of the total nature of the means employed by the world's mightiest militaryeconomic power to force a small country away from its chosen policy, and to get rid of the architect and chief executant of that policy. At Sihanouk's first meetings with the brothers Dulles, there was ominous insistence that he should abandon his neutralist ideas. When diplomatic, political and economic pressures accompanied by military threats failed, there was a period of plots and assassination attempts. When they in turn failed, it was finally, with well-financed treason at the top, a miltary coup and armed intervention by the United States and its Saigon satellite to maintain the usurpers in power that the deed was done. The USA, by the Lon Nol coup of March 1970, had succeeded in exporting to Indo-China the welltried methods of Latin America. For those of us who have followed this cruelly imequal struggle from the time of the signing of the 1954 Geneva Ceasefire Agreements on Indo-China, there seemed to be an inevitability of sequence and denouement in the unfolding\n\ndrama. The scenario was only too familiar. Friends of Cambodia, supporters of Norodom Sihanouk's neutrality-forpeace policies often held their breath in anguished concern when it seemed he must back down or fall, either to an assassin's bullet or by well-paid treachery. Those who knew him best, however, were convinced he would never back down. A point which zealots for U S policies in South-East Asia should ponder is the standard pattern which renders military dictatorships essential to implement those policies. This proves true for South Vietnam, for Cambodia and for Thailand. No shade of political deviation, nothing less than total devotion to the US line can be tolerated. Only when their implementation is thwarted by force of arms does the United States yield any ground. The 1970 coup in Cambodia, for instance, had its counterpart in the 17 November 1971 coup in neighbouring Thailand. The mere rumour that Thailand was flirting with China and North Vietnam, and that Foreign Minister, Thanat Kohman, was meditating over the advantages of neutralism, was sufficient for a military coup to install Field-Marshal Thonam Kittikachorn as military dictator. His first acts were to dissolve the government, both houses of parliament and the constitution, just as Lon Nol had done soon after seizing power in Cambodia. In Thailand, as in Cambodia, U S air power was soon engaged in propping up the new dictator. Norodom Sihanouk has analysed in depth, and documented in detail, the sordid saga of Washington's underground war against his country until it erupted above ground on 30 April 1 970. It is an account which is bound to be studied with special interest in the third world, where innumerable countries are entangled, at some stage or another, in the web of intrigues and pressures woven by the CIA and other U S agencies, as a prelude to encompassing their downfall. The material in the following pages was dictated by Norodom Sihanouk in French, transcribed by myself into English, divided up according to agreed chapter titles, and corrected by Prince Sihanouk. The fact that he used a language other than his own, translated into a third language, 16\n\nmeans the material lacks some of the pungency and vigour when Norodom Sihanouk is translated direct from his native Cambodian. The main part of the work was done at the Head of State's Peking residence during the second half of December 1971 and January 1972. It was more or less completed at further working sessions in Shanghai and Peking in March 1972, with fresh material added as the situation in Cambodia developed. One aspect of the coup in human terms was evident from the moment I set foot in Prince Sihanouk's headquarters. The first to greet me to arrange working schedules was Sihanouk's Head of Protocol, Prince Sisowath Methavi, brother of Sirik Matak, the co-author with Lon Nol of the coup. Present at the residence in January 1972, to welcome two Cambodia ping-pong champions who had given the slip to Lon Nol's security agents in Hong Kong, while returning home from matches in South Korea, was the younger sister of Cheng Heng, who replaced Sihanouk as Head of State immediately after the coup. A ping-pong champion herself, she now studies medicine in Peking. Two of her brothers are also there as engineering students. Even the chief plotters are thus seen to be in a minority within their own families. As for their status in Cambodian society as a whole, the narrative of Norodom Sihanouk is eloquent. The present work is viewed by the author as a weapon in the struggle to regain his own country's independence, and as a warning to other countries marked down as future victims. W. G. Burchett Paris 30 June igy2\n\nPreface\n\nThere have been numerous accounts of the events leading up to the coup d'etat of i8 March 1970, intended to depose me as Head of State of the Kingdom of Cambodia. Some of the accounts have been sympathetic, some unfriendly, some objective, others tendentious. Accounts were written by persons exploiting confidences shared with them when they were in my employ, to claim ' inside knowledge ' of what were, more often than not, insignificant or irrelevant events, and were published to establish the authors' reputations as experts on the matter. The absurd scenarios which these persons have concocted served also to cover up their own perfidy. Others, who came to Cambodia after the coup, sincerely tried to reconstruct the scene. But, viewing the events through their own optics, using their own weights and measures, they attempted to shed light on matters of which they had neither the knowledge nor the objectivity necessary to make accurate appraisals. Many of the articles and books by Western writers have one thing in common : patronizing overtones of 'West knows best'. Asians have grown understandably sensitive to assumptions of Caucasian intellectual superiority, for we have suffered too long the humiliations of colonialism for it to be otherwise. There have been accounts written from afar with benign intent, but which suffer from lack of factual information and from ignorance of our history. Because of the world-wide interest in the drama in which my Cambodian people have been cast as unwilling actors, such accounts risk acceptance as actual history.\n\nAbsent from almost all of these books and articles is the vital central issue to which all other factors are subordinate: the struggle to maintain peace and independence; the sovereignty and neutrality of our country. It is only through this optic that my leadership of Cambodia for three decades should be judged - not on the basis of the vagaries of internal politics upon which so many writers love to dwell. Too many could not see the Cambodian forest for its trees; others did not want to see the forest. Despite their experiences in many lands, and their academic distinctions, many observers proved less enlightened than the lowliest of our peasants. The peasant's consciousness of the difference between independence and colonialism, between peace and war, was soon heightened by American bombs. It is to set the record straight that I am, in this book, relating the salient facts of the Cambodian drama as I lived it, often as the principal actor. Alas, I am hindered by lack of documents. When I left our oasis of peace, as it was in January 1970, for medical treatment in France, I took the minimum baggage necessary for such a purpose. Historical records were obviously not included. Enough evidence is available, however, to prove the unceasing and determined intervention of the United States in the internal affairs of my country, and particularly the role of the Central Intelligence Agency, in a series of plots which culminated in the military coup of 18 March 1970. I have chosen to relate this story to one of a small group of writers who have consistently shown sympathy, comprehension, and respect for our national dignity, for the aspirations of my people, and for my own part in defending those aspirations. Norodom Sihanouk Peking June igys\n\nChapter i Moscow— Peking\n\n* You mustn't go, Samdech. It's Friday and the 13th.' These words were uttered half in jest by one of my aides on the way to the airport to catch the plane which was to take me from Paris to Moscow. It was the morning of 13 March 1970. I am not superstitious so I laughed and flew off to meet the Russian leaders. Five days later, while still in Moscow, I was deposed - and the Soviet government has still not recognized the Royal Government of National Union set up in Peking less than two months later. So Friday the 1 3th was an unlucky day after all ! President Podgorny greeted me at the Moscow airport. There were no elaborate welcoming ceremonies, because mine was a political, not a state, visit. After welcoming me, President Podgorny said there was a plane waiting to take me straight home to Phnom Penh. 'Take an overnight rest in Moscow if you like,' he said, 'and fly on to Phnom Penh in the morning. We have confidence in you. Prince Sihanouk. You are really the indispensable leader of your people. But it's important that you fly straight back and take charge of Cambodia's aflfairs. See they don't fall into the hands of Lon Nol and Sirik Matak. You must ensure that Cambodia doesn't drift into an American take-over. You must prevent Lon Nol and Sirik Matak from creating difficulties for the South Vietnamese people who are waging a heroic struggle for the liberation of their country.' I replied that I would have to think things over very carefully. There was much to think about. On 8 March there had 21\n\nbeen anti- Vietnamese demonstrations in Svay Rieng province,^ and reports reaching me showed that Lon Nol, at the time Prime Minister, was behind them. On 1 1 March a mob, ostensibly of students and schoolchildren, attacked the Embassy of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam and, a few hours later, that of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (Hanoi). Again, my reports showed it to be the work of the army - specifically Lon Nol. The nucleus of the attackers was, in both cases, some fifty military men in civilian clothes, commanded by Lon Nol's younger brother, Colonel Lon Non. This was a far cry from the 'spontaneous demonstrations' naively reported in the European press and on American television. Signs had been prepared in English, a language rarely used in public display in my country. Photographers and crews had been alerted. Everything pointed to a scenario drawn up well in advance. As soon as I heard of the attack on the embassies, I sent a cablegram to my mother, the Queen,2 condemning the violence as ' acts of personalities attaching greater importance to their individual and clan interests than to the country's future and the fate of the people'. I warned of the possibility of a rightist coup and said that I would return for a confrontation with those responsible, but I added that, if the people chose to follow them 'along a path that will turn Cambodia into a second Laos, they will compel me to resign'. On 10 March I appeared on French television in Paris and said that right-wingers in Phnom Penh had ' taken advantage of my long absence to try and change Cambodia's political orientation. They would like us to enter the American camp.'^ I said that there had been contacts between the rightists and the CIA and again warned of the danger of a coup, saying that: 'Everything depends on the army.' At the time I was thinking exclusively in terms of Sirik 1 . Known in the West as the * Parrot's Beak ' area where Cambodian territory comes close to Saigon. 2.

I still had complete confidence in Lon Nol, and thought that he would use the army to deal with any attempt at an overthrow. knew I that Sirik Matak had been in close touch with the U S embassy firom the time diplomatic relations had been re-established in June 1969, and I predicted in the Paris TV interview that the future would be very dark if I were defeated. The answer to my message to the Qiaeen came in the form of further demonstrations and outrageous attacks against the Vietnamese community, including their churches. This was something quite foreign to our Buddhist culture and to our traditions of tolerance. Further reports reaching me from my own sources repeated that the ringleaders were military personnel in civilian clothes. I began to ask myself if it were possible that Lon Nol had turned against me. I was loath to believe this for we had been together most of our lives and I had always considered him as my 'right arm'. His declarations of loyalty - too profusive, I think, in retrospect - were always more emphatic than those of my other ministers. I remember that he had reiterated his affirmations of loyalty a few weeks earlier in France. The official pretext for the demonstrations and the sacking of embassies was the presence of Vietcong and Vietminh troops in the border areas. No one knew better than Lon Nol that, even if N L F units came from time to time in the border areas, they did us no harm. If they had ' sanctuaries ' these were in the sparsely populated forests in the north-east. There were none in the 'Parrot's Beak' - the flat ricelands which provided no cover. In any case the NLF looked towards Saigon, not Phnom Penh. They were fighting to liberate their own country, not to aggress ours. For years we had officially winked at their presence, just as the Moroccans and Tunisians had ignored the presence of Algerian resistance fighters in their territories during the Algerian resistance struggle. The Vietnamese resistance fighters came and went without disturbing the life of the frontier people. If they needed something and our people had it and wanted to sell, they bought and paid for it. They stayed away from our women. Our people were to have monstrously different experiences with\n\nother types of Vietnamese when Lon Nol brought in Saigon troops ! It was from American bombs and shells that our peasants suffered in the frontier areas - not from the occasional presence of the Vietcong. And in the areas most frequently and most heavily bombed, there had never been any trace of the Vietcong. The corpses found after the bombings in Svay Rieng and other frontier areas were those of Cambodian peasants, including a high proportion of women and children. This is confirmed by scores of reports after investigations by the International Control Commission.! In any case, if the Americans, with well over a million troops at their disposal, including over half a million of their own, could not seal off the frontier from their side, how could we be expected to do it from ours when we had a total of only 30,000 troops to guard all our frontiers, including the continually threatened border with Thailand? Lon Nol had always shared my views on this. If he was now using Vietcong presence as a pretext to reverse our policies, and to defy me, there must be something much more serious going on ! It was with these thoughts in mind that I told President Podgorny that I would go ahead with the original itinerary of my visit to Moscow, and then continue on to Peking as planned. In any case, I needed more time to watch developments in Phnom Penh. Later, people said I had missed my chance. Had I flown back immediately, I could have taken charge of things. We shall see whether this was correct or not. The press reported that I had gone to Moscow to seek Soviet aid in expelling the Vietcong. This was not so. I had gone primarily to enlist their support for strengthening our military position. I wanted to negotiate a military aid agreement. There had been increasing incursions by US-Saigon forces from the east, and by the C I A-sponsored Khmer Serei (Free Khmer) traitor groups coming from their Thailand bases in the west. There were daily air violations. These were I . Set up to supervise the implementation of the 1 954 Geneva Ceasefire Agreements and composed of India as chairman^ Canada and Poland. The ICC, in hundreds of investigations, never found any trace of Vietcong in the frontier areas. 24\n\nthe real threats, recognized as such by the Cambodian people. There had been no replacements of US military equipment since I had repudiated American military aid in 1963, so there was a lack of everything, especially transport. The army officers were restless, and there was a real risk that they would demand the restoration of U S military aid unless something were done quickly. I even suggested that the Soviet Union send a small MAAG-type^ military aid mission to Phnom Penh to evaluate our needs and instruct our armed forces in the use of Soviet weapons. After a few days of talks, the Russians agreed to supply everything we needed. But by then it was too late. Premier Kosygin gave me a splendid lunch at the Kremlin shortly before I left. He placed me opposite himself at the table and, with the coffee, we spoke of the situation in Cambodia : ' You must prevent Lon Nol and Sirik Matak from stabbing the NLF in the back,' he said. ' If they do this we will never forgive them. It is a difficult historical moment for our Vietnamese comrades. They are fighting for the liberation of their country. Get rid of Lon Nol and Sirik Matak ! You have already given proof of your anti-imperialism. You have given precious support to the NLF. You have played a glorious role and we count on you in the future too.' I promised that my support for the NLF and their struggle for independence would never waver. By that time I had received a telegram from_ Premier Chou En Lai expressing concern about events in Phnom Penh. On 17 March, after the discussion with Premier Kosygin, I immediately sent the following message to the Queen Mother: The socialist camp considers recent events to be a direct threat to the balance of forces between the United States and itself. Premier Chou En Lai has asked our ambassador to inform me of the concern of China which, for the moment, is maintaining its calm regarding the provocations threatening its Phnom Penh embassy. I . From the U S Military Aid and Advisory Group which had performed a similar function in Saigon at the start of American involvement there.\n\nThe highest Soviet leaders have not refrained from telling me that they consider the present policy of our right wing to be extremely dangerous for the future of our country. The Russians have offered me aid of many kinds to restore order and neutrality in Cambodia, but, while thanking them, I have told them that I reserve the right to act according to my conscience as a Cambodian and in the behalf of what I believe to be the medium -and long-term interests of my country and my people. One remark from Premier Kosygin seems to me to be particularly pregnant with meaning. I quote: 'Your Vietnamese allies have good memories. Just as they will never forget the support you have given them during a very difficult period of their struggle, so they will remember at an appropriate moment the foul blow which your extreme right has struck at an even more difficult and decisive moment in their struggle against American imperialism. If the right continues to strike such blows at our allies, it will inevitably mean war between Cambodia and Vietnam. ' I hope our leaders who are Soviet playingwords. the sorcerer's apprentice will meditate at length on these The Queen Mother had already convoked Lon Nol and Sirik Matak, demanding that they call off the anti- Vietnamese riots. They countered with a proposal to send a delegation to negotiate w^ith me. The Queen, on my behalf, justly refused. There was nothing to negotiate. It was a question of ceasing to violate policies embodied in our constitution, policies which had kept the war away from our frontiers. The Queen Mother expressed strong indignation at the sacking of the embassies and ordered Lon Nol and Sirik Matak to send written apologies and to pay for the damages. After sending the telegrams, discussions resumed with the Soviet leaders, among whom appeared for the first time Leonid Brezhnev, First Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee. centred have on the situation in Phnom Pehn andThethe talks efTectagain this would on the struggle in Vietnam. I received news of the arrest of some officers, known to be loyal to myself, and heard rumours of an attempt to arrest Lon Nol and Sirik Matak. This confirmed my fears of a grave crisis. I left for Peking on the afternoon of the i8th. In the car, on the way to the airport. Premier Kosygin turned to me and said : 26\n\n* There has been a vote in your National Assembly to strip you of your powers. What does that mean ? ' By this time we were almost at the airport. As I discovered later, members of my suite had heard the news on the radio, but could not bring themselves to tell me at that moment. 'What does it mean ? It means that I have been deposed,' I replied. 'What do you intend to do about it ?' he asked. ' I'll fight back, of course,' I replied. Premier Kosygin then said: 'You can have absolute confidence in the Soviet Union's backing of your struggle. We will always support you - and to the end. You will see how it will be with the Chinese. They helped you while you were in power in Phnom Penh but now that you are no longer in power, you will see what they will do !' I thanked him and said : ' I will continue on to Peking and get the support of my old friend, Chou En Lai. Then I shall return to Moscow.' 'Whatever you do, you can count on us,' replied Kosygin. I told members of the Cambodian community who had come to see me off that I had just been deposed, but that since Moscow and Peking would not recognize the new regime, I would consider setting up a government to organize resistance. President Podgorny had placed his own plane at my disposal - a very comfortable plane with plenty of room to work. I hardly need describe my feelings in those first moments ! My worst suspicions confirmed ! Lon Nol turned traitor. That Sirik Matak acted as he had was no great surprise. He had hated me from childhood days because he thought his uncle, Prince Sisowath Monireth, should have been placed on the throne instead of myself. He even had a notion that he himself should have been chosen. I knew of his contacts with the CIA when he was ambassador in Tokyo, and later in Manila. But that Lon Nol had allied himself with Sirik Matak was a shock. There were still graver shocks to come regarding Lon Nol's treachery. What was to be done ? We held a meeting with Penn Nouthl and other members of I . Elder statesman, several times Prime Minister.\n\nmy suite as soon as the plane was air-borne, and it was unanimously decided that we would appeal to our people to launch a resistance struggle. My wife, Monique, who had consoled some of the other family members while the meeting was being held said : ' You have done so much, you have devoted your whole life to your country and now they have deposed you. It would be better, perhaps, if we retired to France.' 'No,' I said. 'Of all times, this is not the moment to hide ourselves. W e would be condemned by history if we permitted Cambodia to become not only a military dictatorship but once more a colony. All my life I have dreamed and fought for my country's independence. I did not win itfrom France in order to abandon it now. The monarchy must not now stand aside. It is certain that U S imperialism will be beaten in IndoChina and we must participate in that struggle. The Americans will be beaten by the Vietnamese and our own Khmers Rouges,^ together with us. And the Pathet Lao will win in Laos. It is the duty of the monarchy to remain with the people.' Monique understood immediately. We sat down at a work table, Monique at my side, Penn Nouth opposite me. While our plane cruised 10,000 metres above the Siberian wastes I started drafting the Proclamation and Appeal to resistance, a document which has since attained historical significance like the famous 1 8 June Appeal of General de Gaulle which sparked the French resistance against the Nazi invaders. I think none of us slept on that flight ; some of us were in a state of emotional turmoil which forbade rest, while Monique, Samdech Penn Nouth and myself worked without respite to finish the Proclamation. It was not actually broadcast until 23 March, because we had to study developments inside Cambodia before I could put the last touches to it. But, by the time our plane touched down at Peking airport, the major part of it had been completed. I. Khmers Rouges (Cambodian Reds) is a loose description of communists and other leftists, at one time in opposition to the Royal Government, now an important component in the Cambodian National United Front and the resistance. 28\n\nIn Peking, Chou En Lai embraced me warmly as I stepped out of the plane. He knew me well enough to take it for granted that I would put up a fight and he had already acted on that assumption. He had convoked the entire diplomatic corps, which was lined up for my arrival. 'You remain the Head of State,' he said. 'The only one. We will never recognize another.' He said he was going to publish the name of every ambassador and charge d'affaires, who had turned up for my arrival, in the official Hsinhua news service and Chinese newspapers, to emphasize the continuing recognition of myself as the Cambodian Head of State. By this time it was towards midday of the igth and the news that I had been deposed was one day old. Some of the diplomats present still thought I might be able to redress the situation, and later abandoned me when I could not do so. But, with one or two exceptions, they were all there that morning - from fortyone countries altogether. Then another memorable conversation held in a car. Almost the first words of Chou En Lai as we drove out of the airport were : ' Yesterday I discussed the situation with Chairman Mao. I have only one question : Are you going to fight ? ' I replied : ' I am going to fight, and fight till the end.' 'Then we will give you every support,' declared Premier Chou. He then asked me to think it over for twenty-four hours. ' The way would be long and arduous,' he warned me, before the inevitable, final victory. There would be setbacks along the way. ' I know that my thinking is that of all Khmer patriots,' I replied. 'They will be with me and we will fight side by side against the US imperialists and their puppets.' I confirmed my decision the next day. Reports in the Western press were to the eflFect that China hesitated for some days - according to Lon Nol's absurd version, weeks even - before deciding to assist me. But within twenty-four hours of my final decision I had issued my first statements over Radio Peking. How could I have done that had the Chinese not decided to support me ? My first statements were on 20 and 21 March and the Proclamation was read on 23 March.\n\n2\n\nThe day after I arrived in Peking, Premier Pham Van Dong arrived from Hanoi. He greeted me with fervour, and exclaimed: 'From now on we are comrades-in-arms. We are proud to have you in our camp in the struggle against US imperialism.' Western press reports spoke of some 'negotiations' with Pham Van Dong and 'mediation' by Chou En Lai. This was nonsense! Our solidarity had always been there. Now it was moved up to a higher level and buttressed by the force of events. One of my first official acts in Peking was to receive the Soviet Charge d' Affaires. I related my conversation with Premier Kosygin, and said that now I was assured of Chinese support and would welcome a public statement from the Soviet Union along the lines of Kosygin's unofficial assurances. The reply from the Soviet Charge was that, because I was now on Chinese soil, it would be better first for the Chinese to make a public statement. The Soviet Union would follow suit. (I had thought that I was giving the Soviet Union a deserved political advantage in letting them be first to announce their official support, in return for them being ahead of China in giving me their unofficial pledge. But nothing came of this.) The opening conversation with Pham Van Dong went something like this : ' How can we help ? ' ' Military instructors,' I replied. ' We have no lack of manpower and the Chinese have already promised arms. We lack trained cadres. You have the best in the world for the type of war we have to fight.' ' I'll tell Giapi to send you a couple of thousand of the best we have,' replied Premier Pham Van Dong. We discussed at length the best ways of coordinating the struggle of the three peoples of Indo-China and it was during that discussion that the first germs of the idea of a Summit Conference of the Peoples of Indo-China was generated.2 1 . General Vo Nguyen Giap, Minister of Defence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, better known in the West as the 'victor of Dien Bien Phu'. 2. The Summit Conference of the Peoples of Indo-Ghina was held, at 30\n\nLater, I spoke with Chairman Mao for a couple of hours before he mounted the tribune at Tien An Men for the i May (1970) celebrations. He questioned me at length about Lon N0I5 whom he had met during the previous i October festivities to mark the twentieth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, but who had made little impression on him. Mao was interested in everything going on in Cambodia and in my role in Cambodian affairs. ' I would rather shake the hand of a prince like you, who is a patriot,' he said, ^than with the so-called \" sons-of-thepeople\" like certain other heads of state. You have played a splendid role. You deserve to be a communist.' This was the greatest tribute Mao could pay. He went on : ' You must tell us what you need. If we've got it, you'll have it. Anything we give you is nothing compare to what you give us by heading the struggle of the Cambodian people.' During my first days in Peking in March, Premiers Chou En Lai and Pham Van Dong gave me categoric assurances that, after victory, Cambodia would be 'independent, sovereign, neutral and free of any Vietnamese military presence'. 'China is one country; Cambodia is another,' said Chou En Lai. ' China will remain communist, Cambodia should remain neutral.' From the beginning, the Chinese government respected my independence of thought and action, my royalism, my nationalism, my Buddhism, my dignity. They offered generous financial aid and, out of respect for my feelings, they delicately call it a ' loan ', repayable thirty years after victory. The French Ambassador presented me with a message from his government, to the effect that if I retired to France, they would place a villa, a car and a chauffeur at my disposal. I thanked him and said: 'The Chinese government just offered me these things. But they were only the first instalment. The second part consists of support for my cause. So I must accept their two-part offer and refuse yours.' my initiative, on 24-25 April 1970 in a border area between China and Indo-Ghina. The main aim was to coordinate the resistance struggles of the three peoples of Indo-China.\n\nAfter he departed, I suddenly recalled an incident which had occurred at Grasse, on the French Riviera, when I was undergoing medical attention there. I was invited to lunch by General Nhiek Tioulong.i As we walked towards the restaurant past people enjoying an early aperitif, I heard someone say: 'Look, there goes Bao Dai. 2 Look how fat and sleek he is. He lives like a grand seigneur and it's you and I who are paying for it.' (A case of mistaken identity but a warning as to the sort of attitude I could expect in accepting such offers!) In Peking when I took a walk, people recognized me for who I was and said : ' You are rendering a great service to our country, to Asia and the world. You helped the Vietnamese resistance heroes. Now the Cambodian people have joined in the fight and you are their leader.' That felt much better than being dubbed a fat and sleek Bao Dai by rich vacationers on the French Riviera. Among the diplomats who came to see me in Peking was the Cambodian Ambassador, May Valentin. ^ I asked him to send some equipment for my secretariat, a duplicator and typewriters. This he did but a few days later he sent someone to collect them, and at the same time informed me that he had a long and important cabled message from Lon Nol. This was no less than an order to cease all activities and to stop making public announcements ! Or else ... I immediately convoked the Cambodian community in the presence of the ambassador and read out the message. ' What is your reply to Lon Nol ? ' asked Valentin. 'This,' I said and, tearing the cable into pieces, L flung it down and ground it under my heel. ' Send him this for my reply.' He picked up the scraps and withdrew. (He later confiscated two cases of diplomatic gifts which, as Head of State, I normally distribute on such official visits !) Between 5 and 7 April, Chou En Lai was on an official visit to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In his speeches 1. At various times Minister of Defence or Commander-in-Chief of the Cambodian armed forces. 2. The * ex-emperor' of Vietnam under the French and Japanese. Deposed in 1955 by Ngo Dinh Diem, he retired to the French Riviera. 3. Later sent by Lon Nol as ambassador to Australia.\n\n32\n\nand those of Marshal Kim II Sung, as well as in the joint communique, the strongest support was expressed for the Khmer National United Front (set up as the result of my Appeal) and for myself as Head of State. I again met with the Soviet Charge d' Affaires and pointed out to him that China's support was now open and official and that I would appreciate asimilar statement by his government. 'But the statement of support was not made on Chinese soil,' he replied. ' I have no objection if Premier Kosygin would make a similar statement on Polish or Czech soil,' I riposted. A month later, we set up the Royal Cambodian Government of National Union in Peking, with the three key ministeries of Defence, Internal Affairs and Information, on free Cambodian soil. This government was immediately recognized by over twenty states, but not by the Soviet Union, nor - with the notable exceptions of Albania, Rumania and Yugoslavia - by any of the European socialist states. Many people have criticized me for being too dependent on China because part of our government is located on Chine soil. But, in fact, a very substantial half of our government is deeply rooted in Cambodian soil. My original idea was to pay a short visit to Peking to secure concrete terms of support from China. I admired the way the North Vietnamese had achieved a balance in their relations with Peking and Moscow. They had China in one pan, the Soviet Union in the other, so the scales were balanced. We now have China in one pan - but the other is empty! (China is not, incidentally, opposed to the Soviet Union helping my cause. In fact, Chou En Lai has assured me that this could be a factor leading to some slight improvement in Sino-Soviet relations.) But what can we do? We are very satisfied that China respects our sovereignty and our way of thinking. But we would like to have both the major socialist countries with us. We would then have all the others as well. Premier Kosygin was very emphatic that I prevent Lon Nol and Sirik Matak from stabbing the N L F in the back. We in fact had done our best by tackling the Lon Nol-Sirik T-CIA-B\n\n33\n\nMatak coalition, the Saigon forces and the American air force without outside help. What more could he ask? And who is stabbing who in the back now Lon Nol and Sirik Matak never stopped their betrayal of the NLF but, nonetheless, the Soviet Union rewards them. Not only do the Soviets keep an embassy in Phnom Penh and maintain diplomatic relations with the traitor regime, but they send medical and surgical equipment to patch up the troops of Lon Nol whom we have put out of action, so they can attack us again. In October 1971, the Soviet Union renewed a financial agreement with that same Lon Nol regime which Premier Kosygin assured me he would 'never forgive'. I am now, in 1972, with the NLF; our troops fight side by side. I reminded Premier Kosygin of his words to me at our last meeting, in a message I sent him on 15 January 1971 . Recalling the warning of the Soviet government to the Lon Nol regime on 24 May 1970, two months after the coup, to the effect that Cambodia should return to the path of ' peace and neutrality' and reject that of uniting *with the forces of aggression and transforming itself into a base for war against neighbouring peoples'. In my message I pointed out that Lon Nol was doing just the opposite to the course advised by the Soviet government. Among other things, I said it was 'not refraining from stabbing in the back the Vietnamese people who are fighting in very difficult conditions against U S imperialism for the liberation of South Vietnam as your Excellency textually expressed it during our last interview at the Kremlin'. Furthermore, in the same message, I appealed to Premier Kosygin ' to completely break off diplomatic relations with the anti-constitutional, anti-national, anti-popular, anticommunist, fascist and pro-imperialist republic . . . and to accord official recognition to the Royal Government of National Union '. I pleaded further that if it was 'still impossible ' to recognize our government that, in 'awaiting that happy day', the Soviet government put pressure the United States to halt its armed should intervention and that onof the Saigon regime and 'grant, as speedily as possible military 34\n\nand other aid to the Cambodian People's Armed Forces'. Nothing came of this. We were happy with the example set by Raoul Roa, the Foreign Minister of Cuba. Shortly after the coup, the Cambodian Ambassador asked to see him - and was greeted as a friend. 'You're going to fight on the side of Prince Sihanouk?' asked the Foreign Minister. * No. He's been kicked out and everyone is for Lon NoL' 'Get out of my office,' said Roa. 'Don't soil my chair any longer. I give you twenty-four hours to quit Havana. You are not only a traitor to Sihanouk but a disgrace to your people. No - I won't shake your hand. I'm only sorry that I shook it when you came in here.' Soviet officials in Pyongyang told the North Korean Foreign Ministry that it was a mistake to withdraw their diplomats from Phnom Penh. 'Once you withdraw it will be difficult to get back,' they said. This was reported to Premier Kim II Sung and his reaction was : 'Better to leave a Cambodia without Sihanouk than to remain in a Cambodia with Lon NoL' The question which interested everyone - not the least, myself - was how this coup could have been organized, and what were the essential elements involved? A full and accurate reply would be of far-reaching importance, not only to Cambodia but in pointing a warning finger to the fiiture for leaders who would dare defend their country's independence and national dignity against internal and external foes, whatever their origin.\n\nChapter 2 Organizing\n\nTreachery\n\nIn early September 1969, I left by plane for Hanoi to attend funeral ceremonies for the revered founder and leader of the Vietnamese independence struggle, the late President Ho Chi Minh. I had deeply admired ' Uncle ' Ho. He belonged not only to Vietnam, but to Indo-China, to Asia, and even to the world, for he stood for the rights of oppressed people everywhere; in the former colonies, and for the blacks of the United States as well. For me, an Asian, he was above all a fellow Asian. He had sent me affectionate notes. I had wanted very much to see him, especially during recent years, and had requested permission to see him in Hanoi. But when the bombings started, my North Vietnamese friends said it would be too dangerous. ' This is jus-t the time to show my solidarity,' I argued. 'But you are the Head of State, and also our great friend,' they replied. 'We cannot accept the responsibility, before your risking your life because of the air raids.' So we hadpeople, never of met. As the plane took off, I thought how ironic and sad it was that my first visit should be occasioned by the death of my friend. I learned later that hardly had my plane left - right at the airport - than Sirik Matak turned to his friends, of whom Lon Nol was one, and said that now was the perfect time to depose me. At the very moment that Vietminh and Vietcong troops are illegally occupying Cambodian soil, the ' traitor ' Sihanouk is flying to the funeral of their chief and has had the audacity to order official ceremonies of mourning for him in Phnom Penh, What better occasion could arise?\n\n36\n\nSirik Matak predicted that, if it were done immediately, I would never dare to return. However Lon Nol was not prepared to act just then. His wife had died and he was still more occupied with the Buddhist ceremonies. He wanted to wait for a more propitious moment. (Lon Nol is extremely superstitious and he knew that no oracle would recommend interrupting his wife's stage Ia learned coup d'etat.) From sources in the funeral United toStates later that the CIA had drawn up a directive a month earlier recommending support for such a coup which a C I A contact on Lon Nol's staff had promised would take place in the 'near future'. By the time I flew off to Hanoi, the CIA had already assured Lon Nol of their support. It remained only for Lon Nol and Sirik Matak to work out the details and agree on the timing. As part of this scenario, I was to be assassinated if I happened to be in the country at the time. Confirmation of what was going on at that time is contained in an interview given to an Australian professor and Asian expert, Milton Osborne, published in the Age of Melbourne on 12 January 1971. Son Thai Nguyen, who gave the interview, isa Vietnamese of Cambodian ethnic origin, a member of the South Vietnamese Senate. More importantly for this narrative, he is the brother of Son Ngoc Thanh, my life-long enemy, a puppet premier under the Japanese and head of the CIA-subsidized Khmer Serei (Free Khmer) traitor group. Son Thai Ngyuen is quoted as saying that his brother 'was guided throughout his long years of exile by a burning desire to bring down Sihanouk' and Osborne continues: 'According to Son Thai Nguyen, Lon Nol made clandestine contact with Son Ngoc Thanh in September 1969 . . . and began tentative discussions about overthrowing iSihanouk. Despite this step Lon Nol was still unready to act and the matter lapsed temporarily when Lon Nol went to France for medical treatment.' The scene now shifts to the American Hospital at Neuillysur- Seine, on the outskirts of Paris. After the funeral ceremonies for his late wife were completed, Lon Nol suddenly found it necessary to go to France for treatment of a shoulder injury received when a jeep, driven by his fellow-officer and 37\n\nrival, General Nhiek Tioulong, overturned in a ditch, pinning Lon Nol underneath. By a strange coincidence, some American ' patients ' were admitted to the hospital at the same time as Lon Nol. These 'patients' showed no visible signs of injury or evidence of malady. They were, in fact, American CIA 'advisers', experts on coup-making. I was later to receive descriptions of these individuals from Cambodian students, because word had quickly spread around the student community in Paris that the easiest way to raise some ' quick money ' was to call on the ' ailing ' Prime Minister, Lon Nol, and listen sympathetically to whatever he had to say. Five hundred francs (about a hundred dollars) was the usual payment for a first visit. Lon Nol's aide. Colonel Kang Keng, always made it clear to the students that they should show their gratitude in the future for Lon Nol's bounty. From this well-camouflaged headquarters Lon Nol telephoned instructions daily to Sirik Matak and other coplotters. This was the period of advanced planning. The journalist, T. D. Allman, in the Guardian} after having interviewed some of the ringleaders, including Son Ngoc Thanh, wrote that some observers believed that Lon Nol, unlike Sirik Matak, was not wholeheartedly behind the plot. This of course was incorrect and the impression was doubtless created by Lon Nol's reluctance to act (a) at the moment of the funeral ceremonies and (b) until he was absolutely certain that he had the necessary US support to succeed. Allman correctly reports that 'my sources agreed that Lon Nol all along had manipulated events from afar ; we always acted with his approval, on his instructions. He ran the government - and our plans - by telephone from Paris' ; this was how Allman's sources expressed it. The missing element in his account was that the ' instructions ... by telephone ' came directly from a gang of conspirators in pyjamas working out of the Lon Nol-CIA operational headquarters at the American Hospital For months prior to Lon Nol's departure for Paris in October 1 969, there had been large-scale ' desertions ' among I. On 14 and 18 August and 18 September 1971. 38\n\nthe Thailand-based Khmer Serei troops, mentioned earher as being wholly created, owned, armed, financed by and dependent on, the G I A. At first, individuals crossed over, then squads and finally company-sized and even bigger units. As early as January 1969, there had been one group of just over two hundred which crossed into Cambodia firom Thailand andover immediately ' deserted In May the same a unit of three hundred men who had ofcome from year, the Khmer Serei base at Phnom Malai 'ralHed' to our forces. Lon Nol, the Commander-in-Chief, gave himself the credit for all this as a triumph for his propaganda eflforts to win over the traitors. He advised that they should be permitted to settle down in Battambang province - close to Thailand - more or less in units. He even incorporated some of them into the Phnom Penh garrison as well as into the Military Police. There was a curious sequel to one such mass ' desertion'. I had set aside one million riels^ from our National Mutual Aid work fund to give the 'deserters' a new start in life, and to encourage others to follow them. They returned the money, stating that, as they had ' deserted for patriotic reasons ', they could not accept it. Strange words from people who were supposed to have arrived with nothing but their weapons ! It later became clear that a million riels was small stuflF compared to what they were getting from the CIA. I was perplexed by the reports that, although they had refused my money, they were spending freely. These men had remained true to the code of the mercenary and were loyal to the far richer hand that was feeding them. They had been instructed to refuse my money to convince me of their ' patriotism '. Another curious matter : during my visit to Hanoi, Premier Pham Van Dong, a most intelligent and sensitive person, whose burning patriotism and honesty I appreciated the more I got to know him, brought to my notice something of which I had had no knowledge. The Chinese had been in the habit of buying our rice for dollars. The rice was then delivered to the National Front of Liberation of South Vietnam. It was sent in army lorries to agreed pick-up points near the I . The official rate was thirty-five riels to the dollar at that time. 39\n\nfrontier, then carted off by the NLF. Lon Nol had been advanced an important sum of dollars for rice to be deUvered in the latter half of 1969. But, according to Pham Van Dong, none had been delivered. The same thing had occurred with badly needed medicines. I promised to look into the matter. These were perfectly straightforward, commercial transactions that had been going on for years, and I could not understand what the difficulty was. Our Vietnamese friends were justifiably astonished over the missing shipments for, in May 1969, we had elevated the status of the NLF representation in Phnom Penh to that of an embassy and now we seemed to be cheating. We had been one of the first states to recognize the Provisional Revolutionary Government immediately after its formation in June 1969. Shortly thereafter we had been the first country to receive an official visit from Huynh Tan Phat, Prime Minister of the new government, and had signed a trade treaty. Lon Nol had become Prime Minister in August 1969, and had demanded as the condition of heading the government, that he have full powers. I received only evasive replies on the subject of the rice deliveries, and soon after I returned to Phnom Penh from the Ho Chi Minh funeral, Lon Nol left for Peking to represent our country at the National Day ceremonies marking the twentieth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Normally I would have gone, but Princess Margaret of England was visiting Cambodia at the time. Lon Nol was accorded every mark of attention throughout his stay, being given the place of honour alongside Chairman Mao Tse-tung on the Tien An Men tribune for the October First parade. Pham Van Dong was also in Peking and, through the intermediary of Chou En Lai, he was able to raise the question of the non-deliveries of rice and medicines. Lon Nol refused point-blank to give any assurances of delivery, giving as a pretext the presence of North Vietnamese and Vietcong troops in the frontier areas. I had a full report on this by the time he returned and told him either to resimie the shipn ments immediately or return the money. Up to the time he left for Paris, Lon Nol had done neither.\n\n40\n\nBy this time, Sirik Matak, whom Lon Nol had chosen as his deputy - acting Premier once Lon Nol left for abroad - had circularized all ministers and heads of departments, forbidding them to send any dossiers direct to the Head of State, as had been the custom till then. Everything had to be sent to the Prime Minister's office and I was to receive only what Sirik Matak thought fit for me to see. Anyone disobeying this instruction was threatened with 'severe punishment'. In retrospect it is clear that Lon Nol and Sirik Matak, once they had received CIA backing for their intended coup, had begun to act as though it was already a fait accompli. The Lon Nol-Sirik Matak cabinet, set up in August 1 969, represented the local compradores, feudal elements and their foreign backers. After the cabinet was formed, Lon Nol announced there was to be no more nationalization of private industries and that some state enterprises would be restored to the private sector. Thus on 1 5 November 1 969, the ministers for the Economy and Commerce, Op Kim Ang and Prom Thos respectively, introduced measures to denationalize the import-export trade, to end the state monopoly on the production of alcoholic drinks, pharmaceuticals and other goods and to permit the operation of private and foreign banks. At a session of the National Congress ^ from 27 to 29 December, I left it to delegates to decide for or against these retrograde measures, but I warned of the evil consequences ' when the swindlers will infiltrate Cambodia with the foreign banks in order to corrupt the elite, sap our economy and try to change the regime'. I cautioned against the role of 'foreign banks which serve interests other than those of Cambodia, and transfer abroad huge amounts of currency leaving an absurdly small amount to the state '. Sirik Matak, as I learned later, thought that this period of denationalization might be the propitious moment to strike. T. D. Allman, in the articles referred to earlier, writes that, according to his sources, the anti- Sihanouk faction was ready to oust Sihanouk in December I . The National Congress of the Popular Socialist Community was held twice a year, its decisions binding on the National Assembly.\n\n1969, during a national congress held in Phnom Penh. The sources said that 4,000 military police and soldiers under the command of Lon Nol were ordered to pack the meeting which Sihanouk used as a sounding board for his programme. Seeing he was outgunned, Sihanouk let the Congress vote for Sirik Matak's policies rather than dissolve the government and call for new elections. Although much that T. D. AUman relates is correct, this passage not.Khmer Lon NolSerei was infiltrated already in into France. The ' toughs were all isthe the Phnom Penh ' garrison by Lon Nol and directed by his brother, Colonel Lon Non, a fascist with political ambitions of his own. My police had informed me of the strong-arm infiltrators. The Khmers Rouges had also mobilized large numbers of their men, in defence of my previous economic policies which were supported by the vast majority of delegates and the public. When the time neared for a vote, it became clear that the public would vehemently oppose the new measures. The Khmers Serei were afraid to expose themselves, and went with the majority, so the result was a unanimous vote against Sirik Matak's measures. Much has been written about that National Congress, fated to be the last, for this form of democratic public action was quickly suppressed by the Lon Nol -Sirik Matak regime. This was the beginning of an onslaught against all democratic practices which had been built up since independence. A few days after the Congress ended, I entered a hospital in Phnom Penh for medical treatment, and on 7 January, I left with my wife and a small suite, including Samdech Penn Nouth, for further treatment at Dr Pathe's clinic at Grasse. I normally took a cure there every two years. I needed complete rest, and treatment for certain chronic ailments, and I thought it would be a salutary lesson for Sirik Matak and his supporters to have a free hand and let them see how well they could solve our economic ills by scrapping my policies. After the cure I intended to pay political visits to Paris, Moscow and Peking. I would seek economic, financial and military aid during those visits and return home strengthened for a renewed effort to put our economy in order by our own means 42\n\nand the help of our real friends. I was convinced that, within a few months, Sirik Matak would have so compromised himself through shady financial deals that the nation would be glad to go back to the lines laid down during the first years of independence. I had no idea of what had gone on, and was still going on, at the American Military Hospital at Neuilly, nor of Lon Nol's treacherous meeting with Son Ngoc Thanh while I was in Hanoi ! My Minister of Security was Colonel Sosthene Fernandez, who later won notoriety at Saan, a town southeast of Phnom Penh, by utilizing Vietnamese Catholic men, women and children as a shield to protect his troops advancing on our resistance forces. Fernandez, supposedly a devout Catholic himself, knew of the plot to depose me, but never informed me. T. D. Allman writes that his sources ' all of whom still hold high posts in Phnom Penh ' (or did at the time he was writing) , assured him that Lon Nol, Sirik Matak 'and important members of the High Command and Parliament, conspired to overthrow Sihanouk by force of arms and to assassinate him if necessary, as early as six months before the coup actually occurred'. This is further confirmation of the conversation overheard at the airport early in September. On 1 8 February 1970, Lon Nol returned to Phnom Penh with the completed plans for what he was to do exactly a month later. He immediately toured the garrisons in the frontier areas, exhorting officers and men to prepare for the great confrontation with the ' hereditary Vietnamese enemy'. This was not his only activity. Allman reports that the final steps in Sihanouk's removal were planned in a series of high-level clandestine meetings held in Phnom Penh in the early months of 1970. Several of them were held in the homes of Lon Nol and Sirik Matak ; others occurred in moving cars to avoid detection by Sihanouk's secret police . . . The results of the meetings, I was told, were personal orders issued by Lon Nol and Sirik Matak instructing the Minister of Education, Chan Sokhum, to arrange anti-Vietcong demonstrations in the communist-infiltrated province of Svay Rieng, and later in Phnom Penh itself. This is exact. Leaflets and posters were prepared in advance 43\n\nin the printing plant of the Ministry of Information and Education on the orders of Chan Sokhum, to be distributed at the * spontaneous ' demonstrations. Because of Sirik Matak's orders censoring the dossiers before they reached me and because of the treachery of Sosthene Fernandez, I was cleverly and totally cut off from just the sort of information that would have enabled me to sense what was coming. On 9 March by order of Chan Sokhum, there were small anti-Vietcong demonstrations, mainly by school-teachers, students and pupils in the town of Svay Rieng and in five or six other small towns in the ' Parrot's Beak ' area of Svay Rieng province. These were small dress-rehearsals for the 'main attraction' to be staged in Phnom Penh on 1 1 March. Loyal students had been artfully fooled into believing the demonstrations were to 'strengthen Sihanouk's hand' in my forthcoming talks in Moscow and Peking. The demonstrations were fully reported in the Phnom Penh press (Lon Nol had already taken over the Ministry of Information and had the press and radio under his control) as 'spontaneous patriotic outbursts of wrath'. popular The T. D. Allman version of what happened iiext is worth quoting and correcting, firstly because it is the nearest authentic account published to date, second, because it has acquired something of an official aspect. Senator Mike Mansfield, a staunch friend of Cambodia, felt impelled to record the three Allman articles in the US Congressional (Senate) Record, 1 accompanied by a highly indignant commentary of his own. After the small demonstrations on 8 March for students and teachers in Svay Rieng, larger demonstrations were ordered for Phnom Penh. Government sound trucks urged the students to demonstrate, and officers of the Government-created Assembly of Youth arranged for students to assemble at the two communist embassies. However, the actual sackings of the embassies which, together with Sihanouk's fall and a Cambodian ultimatum to the communists, provided a casus belli, was arranged through the Cambodian I. US Congressional (Senate) Record of 13 October 1971, pages Si 6252-4. -44\n\nHigh Command and actually carried out by squads of military police in plain clothes under the command of Lon Non. Here one must note that these squads were not just military police, but there were also CIA-trained commandos recruited from the Cambodian minority in South Vietnam and brought into Phnom Pehn a month before the coup to serve as storm-troopers for the plotters. Allman continues : The demonstrations of 1 1 March were just one part of a planned two-part effort to oust the prince. * We planned two demonstrations,' one of my sources said. ' One for the i rth to create the crisis, the other on i6 March to provide the pretext for ousting Sihanouk.' (This sounds like a technique the CIA have taught Lon Nol at the cost of much effort, for he was not known among us for his quick grasp of political affairs !) However, the anti-Sihanouk demonstrations on 1 6 March failed, when pro-Sihanouk students surrounded the National Assembly. The Phnom Penh police, also pro-Sihanouk, that day arrested 20 hand-picked demonstrators carrying anti-Sihanouk tracts as they moved towards the Assembly. As a result, I was told, ' it appeared for the moment we were foiled'. Inside the National Assembly that day, anti-Sihanouk deputies, including the acting president of the Assembly, In Tam,^ were waiting for the demonstration to materialize in the hope that they would stampede Parliament into ousting Sihanouk. Instead, 'we began to be attacked for our anti-Sihanouk statements. The Assembly adjourned in confusion'. I. At the time Allman was writing, In Tam was still Minister of the Interior. He was sacked later by Lon Nol for his failure to implement the latter's plan for 'pacification' of the provinces. As 'President' of the Assembly, it was In Tam who gave Lon Nol the six stars of a * marshal*. In return, Lon Nol gave him one star as 'brigadier-general'. But he took it away again when, in March 1971, 'General' In Tam proved incapable of following after the Saigon puppet troops in their ill-fated attempt to try to recapture Kratie, on the Mekong River. Named as one of America's 'white hopes' for the future following Lon Nol's disastrous defeats in the 'Chen la 2' operation in November-December 1 97 1, In Tam tried to make a come-back as chairman of the ' constituent' Assembly after Lon Nol dissolved the existing National Assembly. In Tam opposed Lon Nol in the farcical ' presidential elections ' in June 1972 and was predictably beaten. 45\n\nOne detail needs to be added. The main order of business for the 1 6 March meeting of the National Assembly was to remove the Secretary of State for Defence, Oum Manncrine and the Secretary of State for Security, Colonel Sosthene Fernandez, from their posts, ostensibly for corruption. In reality this was to decapitate the forces which the plotters feared might be mobilized in my defence at the first sign of a military coup. 'Corruption' had as little to do with the matter as the ' Vietcong sanctuaries'. Due to the well-known opportunist character of Fernandez, the plotters did not want to take a chance. However, because the demonstration had taken a different turn, Lon Nol and the others hesitated to go any further on the 1 6th. As at the National Congress three months earlier, the real sentiments of the people prevailed. The strength of their support for me scared the plotters, not to mention the National Assembly deputies. (Two deputies were later beaten to death in Kompong Cham Province when they tried to explain why they had voted to depose me on i8 March. One of Lon Nol's brothers was also killed there at that time.) It must be explained why the deputies at that time were less representative of public opinion than at any time since we adopted the parliamentary system. In a later chapter I explain at length why I did not think it necessary for Cambodia to ape Western-style democracy with its multi-party system, ' loyal opposition ', and so on. The results, even in the West where the system has been operating for centuries, were not convincing enough for it to be introduced into Cambodia, where there were no such traditions to support it. Our brief experiment with multi-party * democracy ' had proved disappointing to say the least. The Sangkum,! which I founded, was a fusion of political parties. In order to ensure a fair representation of left, right, and centre tendencies in the National Assembly, candidates for election were pre-selected by the Sangkum leadership. This method provided a measure of balance and stability, something very rare in South-East Asia, and did much to preserve national unity. I . Sangkum Reastr Niyum (Popular Socialist Community) . 46\n\nPrior to the September 1 966 elections which resulted in the 6th National Assembly (the one that deposed me) the CIA had financed an all-out press campaign against my so-called dictatorship. I was accused of having adopted the Marxist\n\n1 j i 1\n\n'single-party system', of having 'massacred Cambodian democracy'. Tirades to this effect also poured out of the Khmer Serei transmitters which the CIA had put at Son Ngoc Thanh's disposal in Thailand and, quite simply, I fell into a CI A trap. In response to the press campaign at home and abroad, I decided to allow a completely free choice of candidates, with no pre-selection from above. The result was chaos. There were as many as twenty or thirty candidates for a single seat. The richest of the bourgeoisie, natural allies of the Americans, spent money like water, financing electoral campaigns for candidates who, for the most part, were merely their stooges. Voters received clothing, medicine, free cinema and theatre tickets and toys and sweets for their children from the sponsors of candidates. There was no way for the voters to distinguish between demagogues and honest candidates between truth and lies. The result was that only three candidates, of any merit were elected for the ninetyone seats. The three were from the 'left' and were chosen by overwhelming majorities. A campaign was soon whipped up against them as ' communists ' and they left for embryo resistance bases - as a means of surviving, and to be ready for the worst. (They are now key ministers in the Royal Government of National Union, directing the struggle from the spot.) .. Regarding that crucial 1966 election, it is .. interesting to note the views of a Frenchman, Daniel Roy, who lived many years in Cambodia, and who gives this version in Le Monde Diplomatique of April 1970:\n\nj j 1\n\n| I j , j ] i | ! j \\ i | I\n\nI ] | 1\n\ni j J j \\\n\nIn 1966, the electors found themselves disorientated because Sihanouk, wishing undoubtedly to escape accusations of personal power, permitted several candidates of the Sangkum to contest each j other in each electoral district. Thus, one saw the curious spectacle of several candidates calling for votes offering the same programme under the same label. These candidates, in order to compete, ; resorted to demagogic methods, and made wide use of arguments\n\nwhich had only far-fetched relationships with ideologies. They outbid one another making promises which were impossible to keep, in an expensive debauchery of publications and leaflets, and in the distribution of advantages of all kinds; positions, honour and money. In this game, it was, with few exceptions, the most wealthy, and the feudalists, who triumphed. This was by far the worst legislature elected since independence. The deputies, elected by bribes and corruption, were only awaiting the day when the dollars would start to pour in - as Lon Nol and Sirik Matak had promised. In anticipation of a massive return of U S personnel - spearheaded by bankers and aid missions - there was a rush to build blocks of apartments to be let at exorbitant rents . Small wonder that, on i6 March 1970, faced with hostile demonstrations outside the National Assembly, the deputies were torn by conflicting emotions : fear of the wrath of the people if they took the irrevocable step demanded by Lon Nol and Sirik Matak; fear of the loss of the long-promised dollar dividends if they did not act now. The day passed, as Allman reports, 'in confusion', without the decisive blow anticipated by the plotters.\n\nChapter Three The Road\n\nto i8 March\n\nLon Nol and Sirik Matak were determined to repair the weakness in their position revealed on i6 March. Allman tells of another ' high-ranking meeting ' at the home of Sirik Matak on the night of i6 March at which the plotter is quoted as saying : ' We have gone too far now to turn back.' So there may still have been some doubts in the minds of the conspirators. Lon Nol seems to have been plagued with doubts throughout - not because of pangs of conscience at his treachery, but misgivings if he could pull it off. Despite the assurances he had from his CIA experts in France, he was not completely convinced and was still afraid of hitches when he returned. In Milton Osborne's interview with Son Ngoc Thanh's brother, referred to earlier. Son Thai Nguyen is quoted as saying that : When Lon Nol returned in February 1970, he again made contact with Son Ngoc Thanh, on some occasions travelling secretly to the Cambodian-South Vietnamese border himself, on other occasions working through intermediaries. Osborne then quotes Son Thai Ngyen regarding his brother's fears that his own armed forces were not strong, or loyal enough, to defeat armed opposition to the coup : He therefore sought a promise of material aid from Son Ngoc Thanh and this, his brother states, Thanh readily gave. Son Ngoc Thanh assured Lon Nol that Khmer Serei and ethnic Cambodian troops fighting with the American and South Vietnamese special forces in Vietnam would aid Lon Nol. It was at this point, only shortly before the actual deposition took place, that Lon Nol, with Prince Sirik Matak very much a secondary figure, took the decision to overthrow Sihanouk. 49\n\nAs both the Khmer Serei and the 'Special Forces' were CIA units. Son Ngoc Thanh obviously could not have givto such assurances unless the CIA was backing the whole enterprise. After the 1 6 March meeting, Lon Nol agreed to go ahead and use the army to arrest key security personnel known to be loyal to me. That night. Major Buor Horl, head of the Phnom Penh police, together with officers loyal to Colonel Oum Mannorine, tried to avert the coup by striking first and arresting Lon Nol and Sirik Matak. But it was too late, and Mannorine was placed under house arrest. Lon Nol had the strong cards in his hands and Khmer Serei storm-troops at his disposal. That night and the next day, he used selected units to arrest not only Colonel Mannorine and Major Horl, but also Colonel Huor Truok, governor of the strategic mountain resort of Kirirom; Colonel Pheng Phang Y of the Royal Army Staff Headquarters; Colonel Krauch Samrach, Commander of the Parachute Units ; the governor of Kandal Province, adjoining Phnom Penh; and about fifteen other high-ranking officers. The head of the Army Signal Corps was killed during this action. I had originally set i8 March as the day for my return to Phnom Penh from Paris, after the initial news of the sacking of the Vietnamese embassies. By that morning the airport was sealed off; there were barbedwire barricades along the road from the airport to Phnom Penh ; machine-gun nests were located at all principal street corners and tanks and armoured cars patrolled the streets. In other words, sufficient force had been deployed to intimidate the citizens of Phnom Penh not to repeat their demonstrations of two days earlier, and to inject a little courage into the timid hearts of the National Assembly politicians. 'Only after Lon Nol's troops had taken over the civilian government of Phnom Pehn,' reports Allman, 'and tanks had surrounded the building [of the National Assembly, N.S.] , did the actual vote ousting Sihanouk take place.' The National Assembly, as its first act in ushering in a 'new era of freedom, democracy and republicanism' voted to suspend constitutional liberties for six months ! After they 50\n\nhad rubber-stamped the installation of this military dictatorship, the deputies proceeded to depose me by a ' secret vote ' in which they had to sign the ballots before dropping them into the urn ! Considering the show of force outside, and the arrests of the previous day, it was hardly a surprise that the vote to depose me was unanimous. In my place they selected Cheng Heng, a rich landowner, President of the General Assembly, and a man whose chief claim to administrative experience till then had been running Phnom Penh's central prison. He was an insignificant puppet, not likely to give his masters at home or abroad any trouble. A straw in the wind to which I had paid little attention at the time but which assumed its full significance later, was the following : a wealthy rubber-plantation owner, le Comte de Beaumont, who had big holdings in the Chup area near the South Vietnamese frontier, had been especially assiduous in courting my friendship. Because my father, on his deathbed, had recommended him to me, I entertained cordial relations with him, and no sojourn in France was complete without his invitation. But when I was in France in 1970, and heard nothing from him, I took the initiative and tried to contact him. Perhaps he was ill? 'Out of France' was the reply I received. As chance would have it, I learned that he was, in fact, in France - a revelation which merited little more than raised eyebrows at the time. Later I understood the reason for this little evasion. In the first half of 1969, when Samdech Penn Nouth was Prime Minister, in order to protect our foreign-exchange holdings, he had limited the amount of foreign-exchange profits that could be transferred back to France. A proportion of plantation profits had to remain in the country and could be reinvested in the economy of the plantations. Le Comte de Beaumont had protested to Sirik Matak, who assured him that within a short time Sihanouk would be eliminated and he, Sirik Matak, would be at the helm. Monsieur le Comte could then be assured that all of his profits would be exported. Why, then, continue to be polite to a Sihanouk doomed to oblivion ? But within two months after\n\nthe coup, le Comte de Beaumont's rubber plantations and installations had been reduced to ashes and rubble - destroyed bythe new allies of Lon Nol and Sirik Matak. For the Saigon regime did not brook the competition of Cambodian rubber and Chup was one of the very first targets of its air force. It was for the interests of men such as le Comte de Beaumont that Lon Nol and Sirik Matak and their coplotters assassinated Cambodian neutrality and independence ! The rationalization for the putsch - the existence of the so-called sanctuaries, bases and supply lines of the NLF was a sham. It was Lon Nol himself who signed many of the agreements with the NLF, agreements which the NLF had scrupulously respected. Lon Nol knew that, at one period, when we were under pressure from Thailand, it was the fact that the NLF occupied virtually the whole of the South Vietnamese side of our frontier that permitted him to transfer troops to the frontier with Thailand. The sudden noise about ' Vietcong implantation ' was a smokescreen which I recognized as such immediately. T. D. AUman also came to this conclusion in a series of articles referred to earlier : Interestingly enough, my informants, in the course of half a dozen interviews, never named Sihanouk's foreign policy of maintaining good relations with the Vietnamese Communists as a reason for ousting him. 'Frankly,' said one of the informants, 'Sihanouk was as antiCommunist as we were.' Another said: 'He had been in power too long. We wanted it. The only way we could get at him was by attacking the Vietcong.' The former statement was only partly correct. I was not as 'anti-communist' as were those plotters. A very concrete illustration of this could be seen within a few days after the coup. Lon Nol began to collaborate with the American and Saigon forces immediately, first by exchanging intelligence information, then by combining operations against the NLF in the frontier areas. For years the Americans and the Saigon regime had been pressuring me to fight the NLF and my refusal to do so was a major bone of contention between Phnom Penh and Washington. To cover up their battlefield\n\n52\n\nj defeats in South Vietnam, American commanders - especiI ally Westmoreland and Creighton Abrams, maintained that the only thing preventing 'complete victory' was the j 'Cambodian I refused tosanctuaries'. submit to Washington for two reasons. First, jj it would have meant surrendering neutrality. Second, I, I together with the vast majority of the Cambodian people, j genuinely sympathized with the Vietnamese resistance I fighters who were clearly waging a bitter struggle against U S ; aggression. The more I met with the leaders of the N L F and the D R V in Hanoi, the niore I appreciated their patriotism, self-sacrificing spirit, and warm, human qualities. I testified to this admiration by decreeing three days of national mourning when President Ho Chi Minh died. Although this was the moment when Lon Nol was shouting loudest about the Khmers Rouges and ' Vietcong implantation', I ordered the same ceremonies for Ho Chi Minh as I would have for the death of a leader of our own people. There were prayers by a hundred religious dignitaries in the throne room of the Royal Palace, in the presence of the highest officials of the Kingdom, and special memorial music diffused by Radio Phnom Penh. Incidentally, I was the only Head of State to attend the funeral ceremonies in Hanoi. (Premier Pham Van Dong recalled all this with gratitude when we met in Peking a few days after I had been deposed. ) It is true that I did not want communism in Cambodia. Under the influence of Lon Nol who - as I clearly understood when it was too late - wanted me to concentrate my gaze on an enemy on the left to conceal his own plotting with the extreme right, I was sometimes too harsh with my Khmers Rouges, especially when I reasoned that their activities could endanger our neutrality and independence. What was perfectly accurate in the testimony of Allman's high-level informants was their trying ' to get at Sihanouk by attacking the Vietcong', just covered as Lon upNolhis had sabotaged national unity and own consciously subversion\n\nj , j \\i j i | j\n\nj j , \\ ; \\ j \\ \\ i\n\n^ ' ] ] ] |\n\n1 ] \\ j \\ |]\n\nby faking evidence of Khmers Rouges plots. Proof that the \\ Khmers Rouges understood my motives and never questioned i my patriotism - even when they suffered from measures taken j 53\n\nby me to limit their activities - is that they immediately rallied to my call for armed resistance. Moreover they insist with the greatest vehemence that, against my own inclinations, I continue to be Head of State after we have crushed the plotters and driven the invaders out of Cambodia. The greatest fear of Lon Nol and Sirik Matak was that I would return immediately after the coup and win over the people and the armed forces to my side. Had there been the slightest chance of returning I would have done so. But the Lon Nol government was thorough and ruthless. For instance, they threatened to confiscate the plane and intern the crew of any foreign airline which dared fly me and my suite back into Cambodia - a threat in violation of international law which is probably without precedent in the annals of civil aviation. But in case any airline or pilot thought to call their bluff, even more drastic measures were ready. Allman reports : Military orders, signed by Lon Nol, directed Government troops to assassinate the Chief of State if he returned to Cambodia. The main fear of the moment was that Sihanouk would return, rally the country around him and hold elections, which he would win , 'because he was so popular with the peasants'. In making extensive use of Allman's reports, I have quoted till now only from the three articles which became part of recorded history when Senator Mansfield read them into the US Congressional Record. With few exceptions, the facts contained in the reports tally with my own information received from the steady stream of defectors from the Lon Nol-Sirik Matak regime, including former Lon Nol staff officers in Phnom Penh at the time of the coup. Some of them succeeded in getting out and joining me in Peking, via Paris or Moscow ; others sent me reports after reaching the Liberated Zone. Allman, having got his teeth deep into the subject, proceeded in professional manner to cling to it like a terrier and dug out vital facts of which I could have had no knowledge, because I had no access to his ' impeccably non-communist source' - none other than Son Ngoc Thanh himself, whom 54\n\n| I 1 j | i I ^ I | ] \\ j J i ^\n\nAllman incorrectly describes as the ' father of the Cambodian independence movement'. Allman, in revealing that one of his main sources was Son Ngoc Thanh, refers to the latter as ' a prime candidate to become the first President of the fledgling Khmer Republic'. From my own sources I know this was true and that, at the time Allman saw him, he was bitter because, after twenty years of treachery, he was not rewarded by being installed at the fountainhead of power in Phnom Penh. For he considered the coup to be his own handiwork. But when the great moment arrived, he was shunned by Lon Nol and Sirik Matak who temporarily managed to bury their own differences in a solid front against this potentially dangerous competitor. To the chagrin of Son Ngoc Thanh, he did not enter Phnom Penh mounted on a white charger (perhaps a 'white elephant' would have been more appropriate) and met no cheering crowds when, five months after the coup, the best his C I A patrons could do was to appoint him 'First Counsellor' to Lon Nol. Son Ngoc Thanh had never fooled the people, who had long known him to be a traitor. Even after Lon Nol was stricken with paralysis (a ' sign from heaven' as he himself commented). Son Ngoc Thanh was not called in to take over. It was certainly from a sense of frustration that he decided to unburden himself to Allman : In early 1969, the US government, working through agents attached to Son Ngoc Thanh's staff of exiled anti-Sihanouk partisans, had assurances of US support for anti-Sihanouk moves in Cambodia, including a two-pronged invasion of the country. This was simply a re-vamped version of the 'Dap Chhuon Plot' of early 1959, described in Chapter 7. A comment is necessary to clarify the phrase 'exiled anti-Sihanouk partisans'. Apart from sullying the honourable word 'partisan', with its overtones of patriotism and resistance to foreign invaders, Son Ngoc Thanh's mercenaries were recruited from the Cambodian minority in South Vietnam, trained at a CIA commando centre at Nha Trang on the South Vietnamese coast and then flown to CIA-run bases in Thailand. Others were conscripted into ' Special Forces ' units and operated under CIA officers in South Vietnam 55\n\nitself. The majority of these 'partisans' never saw Cambodia until the day they crossed our frontiers to raid the countryside. Thanh told Allman that the original plan was for him to direct a two-pronged invasion with eight battalions of US-trained troops (meaning the CIA-instructed and financed Khmer Serei based in Thailand, and the KKK^ commandos from South Vietnam) . Plans for this attack had been drawn up in early 1969, and it appears they were independent ofthe Lon Nol-Sirik Matak conspiracy. Son Ngoc Thanh hoped that once his forces had crossed the frontier, the Cambodian army would rally to him. 'The plan', he explained to Allman, ' received the approval of a U S agent', whom he would only identify as ' Fred '. At that time Lon Nol and the ' Cambodian army ' could not have been in touch with the arch-traitor without my having known about it. It was no coincidence, however, that the massive 'desertions' from the Khmer Serei started early in 1969, as part of the strategy of the Son Ngoc Thanh invasion. The CIA, which was master-minding the affair, at some point decided to pin their main hopes on the Lon Nol-Sirik Matak plot to seize power from within, instead of an overt act of aggression. After the scandals in Laos, not to mention the ' Bay of Pigs ' fiasco and the events in the Dominican Republic the Agency perhaps needed something more ' constitutional ', more ' legal ' - especially for a country which was so much in the world's eye as Cambodia. Probably unbeknown to Son Ngoc Thanh, he was to be relegated to second place, and his soldiers, including the 'deserters', were to be placed at the disposal of Lon Nol and Sirik Matak. Suddenly, Son Ngoc Thanh found himself without a considerable part of 'his' army. His original plan, he lamented to Allman, had been I. Khmers du Kampucheau Krom, sometimes referred to as Khmer Krom, the * president' and immediate military commander of which is a bloodthirsty, cannibalistic bandit, former chauffeur of the U S Embassy in Phnom Penh, who boasts to Western journalists - Jean-Claude Pomonti oi Le Monde for instance - that he and his fellow-bandits enjoy eating Vietnamese flesh, 'especially the liver'. A worthy servant of Son Ngoc Thanh, Lon Nol and Sirik Matak!\n\n56\n\n* overtaken by events ' and he had now to play a support role for his new chiefs. Lon Nol's contact with Thanh, after returning from France in February was, as Allman relates it, to discover if the Vietcong attacked Phnom Penh the way they had attacked Saigon in 1968, could Lon Nol expect the help of Son Ngoc Thanh's forces in defending the capital? Thanh, after checking 'with my American friends ' both at the end of February and in early March answered affirmatively. By the end of February 1970, several weeks before Sihanouk was deposed, a dozen Cambodian army officers, as well as several US agents, were assigned to Son Ngoc Thanh's headquarters, where they apparently exchanged information and promises of mutual support. Lon Nol, at that time still Sihanouk's Prime Minister, in February accepted in principle to meet Son Ngoc Thanh at a rendezvous point on the Vietnamese-Cambodian border. To have accepted such a rendezvous with a convicted traitor was in itself high treason. By that time, Son Ngoc Thanh told Allman, he had set up his ' field headquarters ' at the village of Tinh Bien, near the Cambodian border on the South Vietnamese side of Route 2 A At first, Lon Nol sent some of his agents, and the account states that 'several meetings were held on Route 2 on the Cambodian side of the frontier'. It was after these preliminary meetings, following which Lon Nol installed his own officers inside Son Ngoc Thanh's headquarters, that the two traitors met and worked out the next phase. Allman comments : Cambodian [Lon Nolian, N.S.] official spokesmen have denied American pledges of support preceding their decision to oust Sihanouk. But after Sihanouk's ouster, a total of ten of Son Ngoc Thanh's Kampucheau Khmer Krom battalions, equipped and paid for by the US, were sent to guard Phnom Penh. 'We moved four battalions to Phnom Penh in April 1970,' Thanh recalls, 'and a total often into Cambodia by the end of July.' By this time, Western newspapers were carrying photos of decapitated, disembowelled Vietnamese with KKK youngsters holding human livers in their hands 'to cook with vegetables'. KKK troops were in fact moved into Phnom I . Which leads from Phnom Penh south through Takeo to the coast. 57\n\nPenh before the coup and were among those who attacked tlie embassies and later massacred the Vietnamese. Son Ngoc Thanh's revelations to Allman have all the earmarks ofcoming from a disgruntled office-seeker who felt he had been badly treated in spite of all his contributions. The rewards had proven to be meagre compared with his ' meritorioservices us ' and even when he later became 'Prime Ministerthe office was a sinecure. Son Ngoc Thanh's folly was to believe that a puppet can ever rise above his status, for it is always the puppet-master, in this case the CIA, which pulls the strings. Soon the three ringleaders were to become the puppets when Saigon took over. The above represents the essential facts, as I know them today, of the elaborate conspiracy to bring about my downfall and end the oasis of peace which Cambodia had once been. No doubt there were all sorts of plots within plots, as these creatures of the CIA jostled each other for the lead roles. But the main lines and the identities of the culprits are now revealed for all to see. That they knew the outcome would bring war and devastation to my land is clear from the last paragraph of AUman's 1 2 October article (written for Dispatch News International) based on the Son Ngoc Thanh interview. The interviews with Son Ngoc Thanh suggest that the Lon NolSirik Matak regime not only planned to remove Sihanouk as early as January, but that it fully realized that the consequences might be war with a much stronger adversary. The United States, according to Thanh, pledged support in case the war occurred.^ Senator Mike Gravel (Democrat, Alaska), after reviewing the evidence, remarked that it was incredible, to take the position - as the White House has done that the US conducted clandestine incursions into Cambodia, hired and trained members of a sect avowedly dedicated to Sihanouk's overthrow, and did not know that a coup was being planned. One other element in the plot is worthy of mention. There was the mysterious case of the Columbia Eagle, in which just I. As quoted by Dispatch News Service International, 4 April 1972. 58\n\ntwo U S sailors * mutinied ' and imprisoned the whole crew. Shades of Captain Bligh and the Bounty \\ Ostensibly these men were war protestors who sailed the Columbia Eagle into Sihanoukville harbour because they objected to carrying napalm bombs to Bangkok. It so happened that some French secondary-school teachers at Sihanoukville took photos of the 'hijacked' ship when it arrived, and again when it left. They noted that it had been very low in the water on arrival, and very high on departure. And, after dark on the day when the Columbia Eagle dropped anchor, the Sihanoukville-Phnom Penh road was suddenly closed to civilian traffic - something without precedent - and convoys of G M C military trucks from the Sihanoukville docks passed along the road to Phnom Penh until the next morning. On the day of the coup. Western correspondents noted that the troops massed outside the national Assembly were armed with brand-new, M 1 6 rifles, weapons our army did not possess. It seems the Columbia Eagle was one of the C I A's responses to Lon Nol's request, delivered via Son Ngoc Thanh, to help in case of a ' Vietcong' counter-attack. What they really feared was the response of the Cambodian people. While it is conceivable that Lon Nol and Sirik Matak were too dense to foresee the dire consequences of their actions (their main concern being to get their hands on as many dollars as possible), the United States, consciously and deliberately, exported the war in South Vietnam to Cambodia. They made their usual miscalculations, however, as to the long-term effects.\n\nChapter Four Resistance Starts\n\nThe Proclamation which I drafted on the way from Moscow to Peking, and broadcast over Peking radio on 23 March 197O5 had an immediate impact on my countrymen. I formally demanded the dissolution of the Lon Nol regime as illegal and unconstitutional, and called for the creation of a broad front of national union, and a national liberation army : A Government of National Union will be formed. Pending Cambodia's return to a normal situation, a Consultative Assembly will be established. Its members will be qualified representatives of the Buddhist clergy, the army, the police, the provincial guards, youth, intellectuals, peasants, workers and others who live by their labour, industrialists, business people, civil servants, women, etc. belonging to all patriotic, progressive and anti-imperialist tendencies. A National Liberation Army will be created to free the country from the dictatorship and oppression of the clique of traitorous and pro-imperialist reactionaries headed by Lon Nol, Sirik Matak and Cheng Heng and for the struggle against the U S imperialists - their masters. The Government of National Union, the Consultative Assembly and the National Liberation Army will unite with the rest of the people to form a united front to be known as the National United Front of Cambodia which will have the double task of liberating the country and reconstructing it after victory. I knew from the experience of our Vietnamese friends that the road to victory would be long and hard, but shorter for us because of the experiences and successes of the Vietnamese. On 24 March, I issued an appeal to my supporters inside 60\n\nthe country to go underground and await arms and training, and asked those abroad to try and make their way to Peking. There were ferociously repressed uprisings and seizures of power all over the country in the days that followed; the Western press unfortunately reported only those in the eastern provinces close to the capital, where journalists had easy access. In vast areas, Lon Nol's administration simply evaporated before he could get it organized, and it has not been reconstituted since. He tried to pass off the uprisings as the work of the Vietcong, but Western journalists said otherwise. The Financial Times accurately described them as ' an almost spontaneous outburst of rural dismay at the departure of a ruler who made every effort to win the sympathy of the countryside'. Between 26 and 30 March, hundreds of my compatriots unarmed - were shot down in cold blood for demonstrating in my favour. At least thirty were killed on 27 March at the Neak Luong ferry, some forty miles from Phnom Penh on Highway i, leading from Saigon. Another fifty were killed in the town of Kompong Cham on the same day when Lon Nol's troops fired into a crowd point-blank with anti-aircraft, heavy machine-guns. About fifty more were shot down at Suong and Memot, both near the South Vietnamese border. Journalists reported counting about eighty corpses at Takeo and twenty to thirty each in the towns of Prey Veng and Angtassom. The dead were indisputably Cambodians. I have photos of long lines of our peasants, hands tied behind their backs, awaiting their turn for the firing squad; of students executed by being beaten to death in front of their fellowstudents. We were able to identify some of the executioners, at least, as the CIA-suborned 'deserters' from the Khmer Serei, whom Lon Nol had infiltrated into the Phnom Penh garrison and the military police. In a broadcast on 4 April, I reported that over three hundred patriots had been massacred, and again advised my supporters to go underground, ' to go into the jungle and join arms the wereresistance available.forces already there', and where by now One of the developments which pleased me most was 61\n\nreceiving a message, dated 26 May, three days after the broadcast Proclamation, from three leading Khmers Rouges - the leftist deputies mentioned earlier as the only honest men elected in the 1966 elections - who had chosen to flee to embryo resistance bases in the jungle. These were three of our outstanding intellectuals : Khieu Samphan and Hou Youn, French-trained economists with PhDs, and Hu Nim, a lawyer. In view of our rather strained relations in the past, I thought they might pose questions or demand conditions, or that there might have to be negotiations before they committed themselves. Nothing of the sort happened. They had monitored the Proclamation and replied in effect: 'That's marvellous. If you, the traditional leader of the Cambodian people, decide to fight with us - we demand nothing better.' Lon Nol had secretly and systematically worked to separate me from the left.
