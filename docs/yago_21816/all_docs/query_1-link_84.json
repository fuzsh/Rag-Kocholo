The.,prince,- who had a long interview with us in his residence on Anti-imperialist Street, gave evidence eimultaneoutly of anxiety, irritation, and even a hint of sadness. His remoteness from his country weighs on him, victory is slow in coming, and he is no longer sure of what the future and the resistance hold for him. \"Let us admit frankly, our weakness is patent; it can not be hidden. Despite all our victory bulletins, the Lon Not regime is still there, If it is weak and we can not overthrow it, we are even weaker still. If, on the other hand, it is still powerful, why kill it?\" The truth, as confirmed several times by the head of the RGNUC, is that the resistance cruelly lacks arms and ammunition, \"Of course, we serve in the opposite camp, but there is such a disproportionate balance compared to what Nixon sends to Phnom Penh every day!\" Last January's Paris agreements resulted in the disruption of supplies from North Vietnam. The sending of aid from the DRV was blocked--not completely, but almost. In any case, the resistance did not have the means to occupy Kompong Cham and keep it. The prince tried to explain the Hanoi leaders' movements, \"In my opinion, the United States is seeking to stabilize the situation in Cambodia by awaiting a settlement of the whole Indochina question. It informed North Vietnam that if Hanoi aided the Khmers Rouges to the point of their being able to overthrow '-Lon Nod,, it [the U.S.) would be obliged to intervene again. This is understandable: If we win, all their construction in Southeast Asia is liable to collapse. \"The second reason is that Hanoi cannot endanger the payment of America's war debts--what the United States calls reconstruction aid for Vietnam. \"Finally, it should be known that Hanoi and the NLF have drawn up a plan for the country's reunification, which requires time. They consider that a new confrontation with the Saigon regi It inevitable. The impeit.nt thing for teem is that the United States does not participate directly in the new conflict, in any case, that it does not resume bombing North Vietnam. To obtain a complete American withdrawal, some time must be allowed to pass so the United StiANO will get used to peace, and it will be'eome iIpoassib a Nixon to again i*unah country into war. You may note,. =e'oxiti. z+:a `the .tt i, :a i ger o - 'tie I*p, '*that the transport of arms between the two Vietna*S does not require the taking of Phnom Penh: The No Chi Minh trails pass through regions to which Lon Noll$ troops do not have access.\" The disruption of the Worth Vietnamese channel is thus apparently behind the resistance's main difficulties, \"Kim I1-song, the North Korean chief of state, proposed supplying us with as much as we wanted, but to what good, since this materiel could not be transported once it arrived at the M16 borders? The same problem exists for 0hintse aid, with the addition that Peking does not wish, in its negotiations with America, that it be reproached by the United States for adding fuel to the fire in Indochina; therefore, China does not show any enthusiasm for the idea of sending arms,\" No Objection to Declassification in Full 2010/03/10: LOC-HAK-106-1-26-4 No Objection to Declassification in Full 2010/03/10: LOC-HAK-106-1-26-4 IV. 30 Oct 73 H 2 Peking Must Court Washington \"M reover, China is obliged somewhat to court Washington to prevent the formation of a hostile American-Soviet coalition.\" However, in this delicate situation there appears an elemeht of comfort: the RGNUC? recent diplomatic successes. The prince is completely satisfied with the Soviet lea e s change in attitude. \"Their position is very clear. They recalled their charge d'af a r s and all. their diplomats, leaving in Phnom Penh only three persons who are not of dip o a is quality to guard the buildings,. The GDR left only one, The Bulgarians repatriated 1 their personnel. The Mongolians recently recognized us. Of course, as a matter of dignity, they cannot all follow Moscow, one after the other, They allow a few days 0 pass between their respective initiatives. But, in the end, there is no doubt, the h 1 bloc is coming our way. We now have all the socialist and nonalined countries with s It is a very great victory for the RGNUC which Lon Nol will not be able to minimize. \"We must still ask ourselves,\" said the prince, perplexed, \"what were the reasons wh c led Moscow to revise its attitude. Was it, as some people say, to annoy the Chinese h have not.yet broken off relations with Chile? Or rather, does it know that a large t a k is being prepared and did it decide to repatriate its men? When the Russians arrive is always because they think that a solution is close; they are generally shrewd. The wish to push us toward a political solution.\" Then the prince outlined on the map s v r 1 hypothetical divisions of territory which would permit the Soviets to be present and limit Chinese influence, They are still talking, though only to reject them, about tripartite or bipartite governments which would leave the heads of the Phnom Penh regime some of the power. \"However, the idea cannot be dismissed that Peking, Moscow, and Hanoi may agree with t e Khmers Rouges, without conferring with me, to prepare a massive attack in the dry se s n But certainly, we asked, you would be informed, in such a case? \"That is not certain,\" replied the prince, \"I do not have intimate relations with th 1 ers Rouges, I have no more, I have almost no relations with them, yes, it is true, I ha e already said that I found them Stalinistic, with their daily indoctrination instruct o , the language they employ, their methods,\" lll The prince talked on these ticklish subjects with the same ease. But his extreme sensitivity prevented him from hiding a deep-seated sadness: \"You know, there are u d which cannot be healed. I tell you, I will not return to Cambodia, I will remain in Peking until I die. ftyy mother, the queen, is going to come here and we will both remain in China, But, meanwhile, I will aid the Khmers Rouges. To sweep away imperialism, tiler can count on me.\" The prince remained discreet regarding the reasons for these disagreements. But it 0 1 be felt that in the end it was a problem of authority: Who will make the decisions,9 lbe solidly united Khmers Rouges group, or the prince, or even Prime Minister Penn North I is obvious that in Peking the young members of the Cambodian resistance prefer the efficient pozde.rousness of collective decisions to the prince's charm and sparkle, RGNUC head has no desire to lose his freedom of action and speech in the meanderings o democratic centralism. He has the impression he is being held aloof.

The filthy Watergate affair that broke 6 months ago has unearthed and exposed Nixon's corrupt activities before the eyes of the American people. Many of I,is employees at the White House, who were invelved in this wrongdoing, Wire firr si tl gir duties by Nixon because he was afraid that his foul activities would be exposed.

Contrary to Nixon's expectation, his filthy scandal has become even more stigking,. Both the Senate's investigating committee and the court. refused to compromise with him and requested that he hand over all secret tapes relating,to the. Watergate scandal. Neither Richardson, the attorney general, nor Archibald Cox, the .'special prosecutor, could save him. Nixon was furious over their failures. He\"'fired both Richardson and Archibald Cox as well as the under secretary of justice. He. still refuses to hand over the secret documents on the Watergate affair to the court.

Not a\"single senator or member of the House of Representatives dares to step in to overtly support Nixon, and even the chairman of his own Republican Party has condemned him. We recall that Spiro Agnew, Nixon's vice president, has just been sentenced to a 3-year jail term for corruption and larceny. He is the first U.S. vice president to be sentenced to jail while in office. Such is the fate of the Phnom Penh traitorous clique's masters.

They have moderated previous persistent calls for uncompromising armed struggle and have avoided authoritative criticisms of Phnom Penh leaders. The change was particularly apparent in Sihanouk's 29 September National Day message to PRC leaders which merely promised to \"wage a struggle\" until the objectives of the five points are achieved. Last year's message emphasized the resolve to carry out a \"war of resistance\" \"without retreat or compromise, whatever may be the sacrifices and duration of the war.\" Unlike last year, the message sidestepped criticism of the Phnom Penh government leaders by name and failed to assail \"Saigon and Bangkok lackeys.\" Another exercise in restraint has been the Front's failure so far to comment on the Phnom Penh government's 24 September reiteration of its 6 July settlement proposal. When the plan was first proposed it was greeted by harsh invective. Sihanouk's moderation comes at a time when Peking, his major supporter, has shown sustained reserve in regard to the Cambodian situation. Peking continues to replay Front pronouncements, to press strongly for the entry of Sihanouk's government (RGNU) into the United Nations, and to feature Sihanouk prominently in reports of celebrations in Peking. However not since early July, not even on his .return from the nonalined conference last month, has Peking feted'him.at a banquet, an occasion requiring a major Chinese speech on Cambodia. Sihanouk, in discussions with. Western newsmen,: last month complained that PRC and DRV arms aid had been halted. At the same time, Moscow has seemed to be gradually moving toward recognition of Sihanouk's government, although it still maintains its embassy in Phnom Penh. According to an 11 October TASS report published the following day in PRAVDA, Soviet ambassador to China Tolstikov paid a visit to \"head of state\" Sihanouk on an,unspecified date in Peking and voiced support for the Cambodian struggle under the leadership of FUNK and RGNU. According to Sihanouk's statements to Western newsmen, the meeting took place on 9 October and Moscow had acknowledged his regime as the legal representative of Cambodia. A more forthcoming Soviet attitude to Sihanouk's government had been indicated in August when a TASS report of a RGNU statement included its references to Sihanouk as \"head of state\" and the RGNU and FUNK as the \"sole legitimate representative\" of the Cambodian people.* * See the TRENDS of 22 August 1973, pages 1-3.

SL0GAI!S DETENTE DIPLOMACY. EVENTS IN CHILE. MIDEAST REFLECTED The CPSU Central Committee's October Revolution anniversary slogans this year continue the recently established practice of deemphasizing the broader contentious issues in East-West relations and international communist relations in these semiannual statements but responding to specific trouble spots that have developed around the world. While registering Moscow's concern about events in Chile and the Middle East, the slogans, published in the central press on 14 October, also incorporate new themes that have emerged in Moscow's detente diplomacy in the six months since the May Day slogans were issued in mid-April. + The two Middle East slogans, abbreviated in May to a call for \"elimination of the consequences of Israeli aggression,\" now call upon the world to \"demand an end of Israeli aggression against the Arab states\" while reactivating language used in previous years calling for \"the liberation of Arab lands.\" + The slogans carry on Moscow's recent rhetorical concern about the military coup in Chile in adding greetings to the \"working people and all democrats in Chile, who are waging a courageous struggle against the campaign of terror by reactionary fascist forces.\" 1- A slogan directed specifically at Asia as a whole was added for the first time since the foreign affairs section of the slogans was shortened considerably in 1967. The slogan calls for \"collective security in Asia,\" reflecting Moscow's recently reinvigorated campaign in support of this now well-established plank in its foreign policy platform. + Moscow's general satisfaction with international developments over the last six months and its continuing interest in detente diplomacy were registered in a new slogan reiterating the April 1973 plenum's call for steps to make the relaxation of inter- national tension \"irreversible\" and to place the principle of peaceful coexistence at the basis of relations between states with different social systems.
