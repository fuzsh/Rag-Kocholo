        "text": "BY MARY KOZLOVSKI [1] APRIL 9th, 2013\n\nhttp://www.cambodiatribunal.org/2013/04/09/walking-in-slow-motion-french-priest-testifies-on-civil-war-and-evacuation-of-phnom-penh/\n\nFrançois Ponchaud, a French Catholic priest and author of Cambodia: Year Zero, gave emphatic and detailed testimony as proceedings continued in Case 002 at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) on Tuesday, April 9, 2013. He spoke about Cambodia during the civil war between 1970 and 1975, the evacuation of Phnom Penh after the city fell to the Khmer Rouge, and his movements and observations prior to leaving the country with other foreigners in early May 1975. Mr. Ponchaud, who has lived in Cambodia for over 40 years, testified in Khmer.\n\nOver 200 Cham villagers from Borey Chulsa district in Takeo province attended the hearing. The co-accused Nuon Chea observed proceedings from a remote holding cell, due to his health concerns, while defendant Khieu Samphan was present in courtroom for the full hearing.\n\nNew Witness François Ponchaud Takes the Stand\n\nMr. Ponchaud, a Catholic priest, told the chamber that he was born near the Alps in France in 1939 and appeared to place his hand on a copy of the Holy Bible sitting on a small stack of books, when taking his oath. The witness said he had no relationship with either Nuon Chea or Khieu Samphan, but he met Khieu Samphan eight years before. Four years ago, former International Co-Investigating Judge Marcel Lemonde interviewed Mr. Ponchaud, the witness stated, and he reported to the United Nations Human Rights Committee in Geneva about Democratic Kampuchea on September 15, 1998. Mr. Ponchaud confirmed that he would testify in Khmer.\n\nTrial Chamber Leads Questioning of François Ponchaud\n\nMr. Ponchaud told the chamber that he originally came to Cambodiaon November 4, 1965, during the reign of former King Norodom Sihanouk, lived through the Lon Nol regime, and had been in Cambodia for a total of 47 and a half years. The witness explained that he originally came to Cambodia with a Christian association that traveled to countries in Asia starting from 1959. He was selected to be part of the mission and spent three years studying the Khmer language and Buddhism and living with Cambodians to ascertain how Buddhism could help Christians and vice versa. President Nonn noted that Mr. Ponchaud had lived in Cambodia up until May 7, 1975, and inquired if he left Cambodia at any other point between arriving in 1965 and leaving in 1975. In response, Mr. Ponchaud stated that the French government sent two airplanes to evacuate French people from Cambodia in May 1975, and from July 1975 in France he began writing about what happened in Cambodia, the imposition of Khmer Rouge rule, and the misery of the revolution. He added that he also left Cambodia for one month in 1972.[2]\n\nWhen asked to describe Cambodia between 1970 and 1975, Mr. Ponchaud told the court he was impressed by Cambodia’s development at the time, and though there were some injustices he did not pay much attention to them as he was young. He recalled hearing about then Prince Norodom Sihanouk cursing about Hu Nim and Hou Yunand the rebellion in Samlaut,[3]stating that he wanted to arrest Khieu Samphan,Hu Nim, and Hou Youn. The witness read about their supposed deaths before 1970 but learned later that the three had escaped. Mr. Ponchaud stated that in 1967, farmers in Samlaut revolted against Sihanouk because their land was being grabbed to be used for a sugar factory. The witness said he first heard about Khmer Rouge soldiers in 1968, including that they had killed people, and described how when he was south of Krauch Chhmar in Kratie province, he would hear dogs barking at night because the Khmer Rouge had come to the village to publicize their cause.\n\nMr. Ponchaud commented that he admired Khieu Samphan at the time because he was “Mr. Clean” and promoted by Sihanouk to head the Ministry of Commerce. The witness recounted that Khieu Samphan was offered bribes but did not accept them and was therefore an “admirable” and “good” person. “I learned that Samdech Sihanouk police undressed Khieu Samphan in front of the assembly and Khieu Samphan protested against the Prince, and he wrote about this in theL’Observateur,[4] and indeed we were worried that he would be arrested,” Mr. Ponchaud added.\n\nPresident Nonn pressed Mr. Ponchaud about events in Phnom Penh as Khmer Rouge soldiers approached the city. The witness testified that he was in Kampong Cham province when Sihanouk was deposed in 1970 and heard that people traveled from Kratie province and Snuol[5]and Lon Nol soldiers dropped bombs on Skun to attack the demonstrators. The unarmed demonstrators came toChhroy Changvaron March 30 and Lon Nol soldiers opened fire,[6] killing 60 of them, he added. “The Khmer Rouge were cruel, but I believe that they were cruel because they had reason to do that, as they were not pleased with the way they were treated by the Lon Nol soldiers, and that time the Vietnamese troops were invading the border area of Cambodia,” Mr. Ponchaud said.\n\nWitness Describes Behavior of U.S. and Vietnamese Troops\n\nMr. Ponchaud recounted being arrested by the Vietnamese at Angchey Mountain in Kampong Cham and having to pay 44,000 Vietnamese dong for his release. He stated that American soldiers and South Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia on May 1, 1970, coming 40 kilometers inside the country. At the time, Mr. Ponchaud said, he was living in O’Raing Ov district in Kampong Cham and Vietnamese troops came to Sayang village. Mr. Ponchaud told the court:\n\nThe American and the Vietnamese troops were very brutal. They killed civilians and raped them. The only way the people could be safe was to join or to reach the Khmer Rouge soldiers. I could also refer to witnesses who say that the Khmer Rouge soldiers were very nice and good people. They helped us cultivate rice and also they were engaged in this assistance all along. It happened during the time when Cambodia was bombarded by the Americans. I am talking about this because I have my own version about the Khmer Rouge. At the beginning, Khmer Rouge provided some form of hope for the people of Cambodia. Even I myself in my book Cambodge: Année Zéro, I also wrote that I would pray that the Khmer Rouge soldiers came because people lost all hope during the Lon Nol regime. Cambodian people had to suffer greatly and in despair, and by 1973 we already knew what the Khmer Rouge had been doing. They were helping us in the fields.\n\nMr. Ponchaud continued that they learned people were evacuated in 1973 in Bos Knau [7] and Damnak Chang Eou [8]and information about the Khmer Rouge’s “bad deeds” intensified – perhaps due to battle tactics – but they were still convinced that the Khmer Rouge were not bad people and they treated people better than Lon Nol soldiers did. “When they won the war, we expected that they would lessen their cruelty,” he said, noting that the population was evacuated from cities from April 17, 1975, after the Khmer Rouge achieved victory.\n\nAt this point, Mr. Ponchaud argued that Henry Kissinger should stand trial for his acts during this period. He elaborated on this comment by describing U.S. bombing of Cambodia in the 1970s:\n\nThe Americans dropped bombs all across Cambodia, and I … bore witness to these events. I was in a house near the market of Kandal.[9] … At night I could see that the bombs were dropped in the horizon. It was like the skyline was burning. The American soldiers mistreated Cambodian people without any reason whatsoever. They killed Cambodian people through bombings. Some researchers say that about 100,000 Cambodian people died. To me, about 400,000 people could have been killed by the bombs. People were shivering – they were terrified and traumatized by these carpet bombings. We all know that everyone was having a very difficult time during the time of the bombing, and people in the paddy fields had to run to the city to take refuge. They were afraid of the Americans, who kept bombing them. So by April 1975, people already came to the city, and then we were informed or asked to leave the city because they said that Americans would be bombing us again. As I told you we had been traumatized by the bombings, so by way of hearing that we had to leave the city otherwise we would be bombed again, people were convinced and we had to leave the city. I talked to the Khmer Rouge that I did not want to leave Cambodia, I would like to live in Cambodia until I die, but the Khmer Rouge told me that I could be on my own and if I did not want to leave Cambodia, then I would have to be responsible for my own safety.\n\nWhen pressed on whether he could see the bombing from his residence in Phnom Penh, Mr. Ponchaud said he believed the bombs were dropped close to the city because he could see the bright skyline, which was illuminated by fireballs from the bombs, he could hear the sounds of bombs, and the ground sometimes shook.\n\nMr. Ponchaud testified that he worked with refugees and observed people coming into the city everyday, estimating that two to three million people were in Phnom Penh at that time, some of whom were living in pagodas and on street corners. He said life in Phnom Penh was “miserable” and “chaotic” at the time; people did not have enough to eat and his organization could provide only minimal assistance until January 1975, after which it became clear that the city would soon be captured. Two days after January 1, 1975, Mr. Ponchaud recalled that Khmer Rouge soldiers crossed the Mekong River and food could therefore no longer be shipped from Vietnam. The U.S. was dropping food from airplanes via Bangkok, he added, but the parachutes repeatedly landed in areas conquered by the Khmer Rouge. The witness told the court he did not go to any hospitals, but he transported some sick people to a center to prevent their diseases from spreading.\n\nJust Prior to the Fall of Phnom Penh\n\nUnder questioning from President Nonn, Mr. Ponchaud testified that from April 13, 1975, he believed Phnom Penh would soon be captured and stayed at a commune office where there was a tall church, which the Khmer Rouge eventually destroyed; he saw the Khmer Rouge marching into the city and burning some houses. Mr. Ponchaud explained that he was asked to help translate in French and Khmer and disarm officials at a refugee center set up by the head of the Red Cross at Hotel le Phnom, [ 10] stating that he felt bad for taking away items like knives because people needed them to cut food. The witness told the court that he heard fighting and gunfire around Phnom Penh and saw seven people dead near his residence after a bomb was dropped. “From 1973 onwards, the situation in Phnom Penh was so miserable, was so difficult, there was no food, and Khmer continued fighting and open[ing] fire,” he said, adding that in 1972 the Khmer Rouge also bombed at Tuol Svay Prey, [ 11] killing 200 people.\n\nOn the night of April 16, Mr. Ponchaud continued, he was at Hotel le Phnom disarming government officials taking refuge there, and later he went to the municipality, where he observed hundreds of people entering the city from all directions. He observed a packed white Sedan in front of the French embassy, and believed that French officials would be negotiating with the Khmer Rouge to ensure their safety. Mr. Ponchaud said tanks rolled into the city, firing shells, and he observed some youths wearing black clothes and holding flags, whom he claimed were mistakenly identified by journalists as Khmer Rouge soldiers. [12] By 10 o’clock,[13] the city was captured, the witness recalled. “At the beginning, we saw only young people searching others for weapons, but then we learned that they were the Khmer Rouge soldiers, and we learned also that the Lon Nol soldiers had to surrender, and the representative of the Lon Nol soldiers made it clear that the Lon Nol soldiers now were defeated and they surrendered,” Mr. Ponchaud recalled.\n\nSo by 10 o’clock, Phnom Penh was fully captured, and it was completely silent. There was no more gunfire. I did not believe that the Khmer Rouge stopped killing people but did not hear any more gunshots, and at 11 o’clock I saw the unspeakable event. I saw the sick people, I saw the crippled, who were crawling like worms right in front of my house and people were moving out of the city. And one of the handicapped asked to stay in our house and I said sorry, you have to move on, otherwise you would be killed if you stayed here. So we did not receive any patients and it was shameful for me not to do that, but we had no choice, and a lot of injured people were asked to move to the paddy fields. And I heard people said if the injured people did not want to leave then they would be killed by bombs, by the soldiers.\n\nThe witness continued to describe the evacuation, stating that the Khmer Rouge evacuated Cham Muslims and he was pleased because he thought they could return to their hometowns. At around 2 o’clock, Khmer Rouge soldiers in black clothes ordered people to leave due to fears of bombing, Mr. Ponchaud recounted, which people obeyed because they were frightened of potential U.S. bombardment:\n\nI saw people walking along the street; they were marching out of the city. They walked in slow motion. I saw people march along the street, but the movement was very slow – they could actually travel on foot around three to four kilometers per hour. And then at around 6, I did not see any people in Phnom Penh, at least in my place I did not see any civilians.\n\nMr. Ponchaud described the Khmer Rouge soldiers as “indirectly” threatening people. “I and my friend met with the Khmer Rouge and I look into the Khmer Rouge eyes and they looked at us with a strange look,” the witness said. “Actually the Khmer Rouge could threaten us by only a bare look of eyes. They were very fierce.” On the night of April 17, there were military groups of around 10 members that had leaders, deputy leaders, and members, and one such group came to his house, Mr. Ponchaud recollected, telling them not to move around freely. The witness said he talked to the young soldiers who wished to learn how to drive their cars and described the cadres as ignorant because they blamed the car after crashing it into a tree. Then on April 18, Mr. Ponchaud testified that he drove the Khmer Rouge around, pointing out various landmarks and residences in Phnom Penh to them. He stated the Khmer Rouge cadres were not afraid of the Lon Nol troops but kept asking where American soldiers were staying. “The Khmer Rouge thought that there was the presence of American soldiers everywhere,” he said, adding that he did not see any civilians while he drove but the Khmer Rouge had broken down their doors and taken their property. Mr. Ponchaud told the court he later went to the French embassy.\n\nMr. Ponchaud recalled that the Khmer Rouge announced to city dwellers:\n\nComrades, leave Phnom Penh city as soon as you can, because the American soldiers will bombard the city. You will leave the city for about three or four days. You do not have to bring anything along with you. You only leave for a short period of time. You will come back. The Khmer Rouge soldiers are not [thieves]; your properties will not be stolen, so just leave the city as soon as you can.\n\nThe witness explained that after seeing different groups of Khmer Rouge soldiers in different colored clothes and weaponry, he believed they were “anarchic” and disorganized. Mr. Ponchaud testified that people had to leave in various directions depending on their residential area and he remembered a crying 12-year-old boy who wanted to go to his pregnant mother but was unable to. “People … were very sad and they were very depressed,” he told the court. “They were sadder than sad, and they did not want to leave because they noticed that the way the Khmer Rouge actually exerted pressure on us not only through weapons but also through the eyes as well.” The witness stated that he did not recall or personally witness the Khmer Rouge physically coercing people to leave or killing anyone but that they exerted psychological pressure on people. He added that the city dwellers considered April 17, 1975, a peaceful day and believed the Khmer Rouge were not bad and would not kill their own people, so they obeyed their orders. Mr. Ponchaud explained that he did not see any corpses along the road, but he saw people walking along and people were treated badly:\n\nIt was beyond imagination because it was a brutal act by the Khmer Rouge towards the people, the evacuees. I had to leave the French embassy on two occasions. A few days later, perhaps on April 21 or 22, I had to leave the French embassy so that I could monitor the actual situation and I saw the Khmer Rouge occupied the municipality and I could not see other people other than the Khmer Rouge soldiers. And later on I met a Khmer Rouge female soldier; I was very frightened because women soldiers of the Khmer Rouge were believed to be even crueler than their male counterparts. The Khmer Rouge then evacuated or gathered the French citizens and those who were holding French passports. In the vicinity of Phnom Penh, it was empty, but I saw hundreds of people gather at Prek Phnou [14] but I never saw any dead bodies. I couldn’t say that people did not die during the course of evacuation, but I just didn’t see any.\n\nPresident Nonn recounted that Mr. Ponchaud told the court he took refuge in the French embassy, before traveling along National Road 5 to search for his friends – Christian foreign nationals – in hopes of bringing them back to the embassy. In response to questions about this trip, Mr. Ponchaud responded that he traveled to Prek Phnou five or six days after April 17 with two Khmer Rouge soldiers and another French national – a teacher. He saw “seas of people” in rice paddies upon arrival, but he saw no soldiers, civilians, or dead bodies along the way. Mr. Ponchaud explained that he did not leave his car at Prek Phnou because he was terrified as there were Khmer Rouge soldiers carrying rifles. “I saw people whom I knew before,” he recalled. “I dare not even talk to them. I only actually signalled them through my eyes. We used our eye contact to communicate.”\n\nSituation at the French Embassy after Khmer Rouge Captured Phnom Penh\n\nUnder questioning about the living situation and people at the French embassy, Mr. Ponchaud testified that there were about 500 foreigners – Americans, including people from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and a Laotian[15] – and around 500 Cambodians, the majority of whom were soldiers from the defeated Lon Nol regime. On April 18 and 19, Mr. Ponchaud recalled, they spoke to military personnel who wished to seek refuge in the embassy and on April 20, an elderly soldier called a meeting where he announced that Khieu Samphan wished to meet comrades at the French embassy in order to “rearrange the revolution.” The witness detailed how Cambodian women married to French men could stay at the embassy but Cambodian men married to French women had to leave to work with the Cambodian population. Mr. Ponchaud told the court:\n\nOn April 20 the situation was depressing because around 25 Cambodian men who married to French ladies, they were separated; they had to leave the French embassy. There was one French lady who is very young, and her husband was a former nurse at Calmette Hospital. She refused to stay in the French embassy. She refused to be separated from her husband, so she had to accompany her husband. She decided to leave the French embassy, and then one of them said, next year, or in one year’s time, we would see each other in Champs Elysées. I could not recall the name of that person, but on April 20 it was the hardest day of their life because they were separated from their loved ones.\n\nMr. Ponchaud recalled hearing that Angkar separated soldiers from civilians and he knew that some of the soldiers and army commanders were killed. On April 19, he continued, soldiers outside the French embassy demanded that the embassy hand over the “seven super traitors”[16] and they wished to protest, but AK-47s were pointed at them. Mr. Ponchaud testified that they had to choice but to hand them over and did not know their eventual fate, but he later heard from others that the Khmer Rouge executed them.\n\nThe witness informed the court that on May 7, 1975, he traveled along National Road 4 to Ang Snuol,[17] then to Uddong and Omleang,[18] then to Kampong Chhnang province where the Khmer Rouge were friendly and supplied them with food. Later, they traveled to Pursat province, where they changed trucks and went to Battambang province. They waited for a few hours before traveling overnight and arriving in Poipet on the Thai-Cambodian border at about 6 a.m., he added. “All the way I did not see a single person, when we thought that we were leaving from a ghost country,” Mr. Ponchaud said, repeating that he did not see any corpses.\n\nPresident Nonn inquired how many couples were separated at the French embassy and how they left the compound. Mr. Ponchaud replied that he did not see the so-called “seven super traitors” because FrançoisBizot[19] was standing at the embassy gate and he only heard that they had been asked to leave. However, he told the court that the Cambodian men with French wives had to leave with Cambodian civilians. Mr. Ponchaud recalled that he had previously told Cambodians inside the embassy to leave before the Khmer Rouge came to retrieve them. People were eventually taken from the embassy to somewhere near the old stadium[20] and he heard that some people were killed at the stadium, he added.\n\nMoving back to the “seven traitors,” President Nonn inquired which embassy councillor Sirik Matak had spoken to. Mr. Ponchaud described how he was the councillor’s personal interpreter and France did not have clear diplomatic relations with the Lon Nol regime around that time after withdrawing their ambassador. He stated that the French wished to recognize the Khmer Rouge because the regime was supported by then Prince Sihanouk, but at the time there was a chargé d’affaires and a councillor, who was later demoted to the position of vice-councillor. They were waiting for the Khmer Rouge to raise diplomatic relations back to the ambassador level, Mr. Ponchaud testified. He added that they wanted to negotiate for people to stay, but the Khmer Rouge were not prepared to do this. When asked about the people staying at the French embassy, Mr. Ponchaud said there was a mixture of nationalities, including a Laotian, some South Vietnamese, Americans – particularly journalists and CIA staff – and the Khmer Rouge were surprisingly quite courteous to foreigners, perhaps because they did not want to mistreat them.”They were courteous in the ways the Khmer Rouge considered to be courteous at that time,” he added.\n\nMr. Ponchaud explained that besides the French embassy, there was a Soviet Embassy, with staff who flew in to Phnom Penh on April 16. They put up a plaque that read, “We are Communist brotherhood,”[21] he said. The witness testified that there was a French couple who believed strongly in Communism who were told by the Khmer Rouge that they were not revolutionaries and threatened.\n\nEvacuation of Foreigners from French Embassy\n\nMr. Ponchaud said there were about 500 Cambodians and foreigners left at the embassy after various people were made to leave. He described how on April 30, a first wave of foreigners left the embassy, followed by another – including himself – on May 7, and then another around May 23 or 24.[22] Mr. Ponchaud explained that François Bizot negotiated with the Khmer Rouge and the French government agreed to prepare airplanes to transport foreigners out of the embassy, which angered the Khmer Rouge because the planes were an “imperialist” means of transport. As such, foreigners were taken by trucks starting on April 30 with those who were especially vulnerable, such as CIA leaders, pregnant women, and elderly people, he said. Mr. Ponchaud recalled fears that this first group of people had been killed after they did not hear any information for a couple of days, but they were later informed that the group had reached Poipet. He described his surprise that the Khmer Rouge did not ask questions or check passports when they left on May 7, as he had previous experience with communist authorities in Vietnam and China who had checked everything.\n\nMr. Ponchaud confirmed that he was among the last group of foreigners sent from the French embassy and had to leave the embassy key with Comrade Nhem, head of the division in the eastern part of Phnom Penh. “Comrade Nhem told me to leave Phnom Penh for Paris, and after the country had been cleaned, he said he would warmly welcome me back,” the witness added. Mr. Ponchaud explained that the foreigners had wanted to travel on foot to observe the situation in the countryside but were not permitted to do so and instead had to take trucks accompanied by Khmer Rouge soldiers. “A man on the truck told me although he was a soldier, he said he would like to go to France as well, and I could tell from that moment that even a cadre from the Khmer Rouge clique also was afraid of their own people,” Mr Ponchaud said, clarifying that he did not recall exactly if he left Phnom Penh on May 7 or reached the border on that date, but he was allowed to leave the country quite easily.\n\nIn response to questions from President Nonn about negotiations at the time, Mr. Ponchaud emphasized that there were no negotiations as the Khmer Rouge were the victors and did not allow it.[23]\n\nTrial Chamber Judge Jean-Marc Lavergne Questions François Ponchaud\n\nFirstly, the witness confirmed to Trial Chamber Judge Jean-Marc Lavergne that he was conscripted to join the French army when he was 20 years old and served in a paratrooper unit in Algeria for two and a half years, where he started to “hate war” because of its destructiveness.\n\nJudge Lavergne requested further information about Mr. Ponchaud’s whereabouts in Cambodia prior to the Khmer Rouge period, to which the witness replied that he lived in Chhroy Changvar, then went to the countryside to live with peasants for two months before coming back to Phnom Penh in September 1966. Later, Mr. Ponchaud stated, he went to Kampong Cham province to continue learning Khmer and heard the Americans bombing the Ho Chi Minh Trial – roughly 80 to 100 kilometers away – when he was in Stung Treng.[24]\n\n“About one million tons of bombs were dropped and Mr. [Henry] Kissinger, according to the documents we read that were exposed in public … last year, [] asked Nixon to use an atomic bomb to destroy and block the Ho Chi Minh Trial,” he stated.[25] Mr. Ponchaud testified that from 1965 Sihanouk permitted Chinese and Soviet weaponry to be transported to the port of Sihanoukville, and from Sihanoukville to Neak Loeung[26] and Stung Treng. “I saw truckloads of weapons being transported from Neak Loeung to Svay Rieng [province], from Neak Loeung to Memut,[27] and from Neak Loeung to Stung Treng and I on one occasion saw an overturned truck filled with weapons,” Mr. Ponchaud said, adding that he also saw North Vietnamese soldiers.\n\nWhen Judge Lavergne pressed for more detail on his whereabouts, Mr. Ponchaud told the court that he traveled to Battambang province to communicate with Christian communities and was later asked to go to Kdol Leu,[28] then to Kampong Cham where he remained until war broke out after Sihanouk was deposed in March 1970. Mr. Ponchaud said hundreds of people traveling from Kampong Cham to Phnom Penh on March 19 were executed by Lon Nol soldiers, who also killed innocent, unarmed Vietnamese civilians. At the time, people listened to Prince Sihanouk’s speech from Peking appealing to Cambodian people to enter the maquis jungle, Mr. Ponchaud testified. The witness said that at the time he was fired at and warned not to return to Kampong Cham or he would eventually be killed.[29]\n\nJudge Lavergne sought clarification that Mr. Ponchaud arrived in Battambang in 1967, then went to Kampong Cham and eventually left the province in 1970. He appeared to receive confirmation of these details from the witness. Then Judge Lavergne asked Mr. Ponchaud if he was translating the Bible into Khmer when he returned to Phnom Penh, and if so, for what purpose. The witness replied that he received about 50 students from the countryside who had nowhere to stay in the city and translated the Bible into Khmer because he believed that if they were expelled from the country they could leave behind materials for Christians. After Mr. Ponchaud briefly switched to French to explain that he translated documents for the Christian community to use if the mission was not present, Judge Lavergne requested that he avoid changes in language.\n\nUnder questioning from Judge Lavergne about whether people felt hopeful after the coup d’état, Mr. Ponchaud responded that some people did not support the leaders and some disliked Sihanouk,[30] with one teacher he knew buying a can of beer to toast the end of Sihanouk’s reign. “They celebrated when Norodom Sihanouk was toppled down and the situation was changing,” he added. “Peasants from the beginning supported Prince Norodom Sihanouk, but intellectuals in Phnom Penh, the majority of them didn’t support him.”\n\nWhen asked if this difference set the city and countryside apart, Mr. Ponchaud stated that in 1623 Annam[31] took control of Prey Nokor – or Saigon – when Annamese and Siamese soldiers were fighting in Cambodian territory, at which point there were no cities in Cambodia as there were during the French colonial period. The witness said the Khmer Rouge followed Marxist-Leninist lines, wanting to “eliminate the city” and make the country equal.[32]\n\nWitness Questioned on Pre-1975 Period\n\nJudge Lavergne asked the witness about the Khmer Rouge’s treatment of people prior to 1975, to which Mr. Ponchaud stated that when Khmer Rouge soldiers captured a village in 1973, they set houses on fire, executed commune chiefs, and evacuated people to the forest. He added that in 1973, he knew people in Kampong Thom province – there were Christians there – which was attacked by Lon Nol soldiers. “We should also be aware that in 1973, in order to forgive the Khmer Rouge, the lower level cooperatives were established so that people could work in cooperatives to produce rice for the population,” he said.[33] On corruption during this period, Mr. Ponchaud testified that a Battambang governor sold rice to the Khmer Rouge and Sosthene Fernandez sold weapons. “The Lon Nol government finally would be defeated because of this; however corruption in Lon Nol regime was less than these days’ corruption,” he added.\n\nUnder questioning about why the Khmer Rouge gained popularity among people in Phnom Penh, Mr. Ponchaud testified that city dwellers could not grow rice and do business, and received assistance from NGOs and humanitarians organizations. All people prayed for peace, he said, emphasizing again that the populace had no hope under the Lon Nol regime, explaining how commanders would keep “ghost soldiers” on the payroll and pocket their salaries after they died.\n\nIn response to Judge Lavergne, Mr. Ponchaud said he did not know what people thought of the GRUNK (Royal Government of National Union of Kampuchea) or FUNK (National United Front of Kampuchea) but they knew Sihanouk would be “on their side” and the Khmer Rouge won the war with his support. He continued:\n\n[People] believed that when the Khmer Rouge won the victory then King Sihanouk would eventually return to Cambodia, and the Khmer Rouge knew this even much better. For example in 1973, in February, they invited Sihanouk to the jungle in Kulen … and to Kulen Mountain [34]and Angkar tried their best to make sure that the soldiers could not see Samdech Sihanouk because they were afraid that Sihanouk could incite them to protest against Angkar. … They really looked down on both the King and Queen since 1970 when they were visiting Cambodia.\n\nMr. Ponchaud added that in 1973 people were afraid of the Khmer Rouge because they knew they had mistreated villagers in the countryside, and they knew of the so-called “seven traitors” but did not believe that information. Judge Lavergne asked if people were expecting the worse, to which the witness replied that he believed people were terrified of the looming misery, but they were powerless because there was no hope under the Lon Nol government.\n\nDefense Queries Scope of Questioning for François Ponchaud\n\nAt this juncture, International Co-Lawyer for Nuon Chea Victor Koppe noted that Mr. Ponchaud was a witness and would be asked questions about what he had seen, but certain questions appeared to go to the opinion of the witness – such as what the Phnom Penh population was feeling – and sought clarification on how Mr. Ponchaud should be approached during cross-examination.\n\nIn response, International Senior Assistant Co-Prosecutor Vincent de Wilde stated that Mr. Ponchaud was present because he had witnessed events prior to 1975 and up to early May 1975, but the prosecution also wished to question him on his analysis of refugee accounts that he gathered in France and Thailand. Mr. de Wilde argued that Mr. Ponchaud was both a witness and an analyst, and also sought direction from the chamber. Mr. Koppe countered that “analyst” was not a legal term and Mr. Ponchaud was either a witness or an expert. If Mr. Ponchaud is to be considered an expert witness, Mr. Koppe contended, there must be a separate formal decision to that effect.\n\nAfter judges consulted on the issue for several minutes, Trial Chamber Judge Silvia Cartwright informed the parties that Mr. Ponchaud had been called as a witness and the chamber would determine the relevance and probative value of questions put to him. However, she continued, he was not an expert in the technical sense and the chamber would deal with any concerns arising from the parties’ examination.\n\nJudge Lavergne Questions Witness on Experiences in Phnom Penh\n\nWhen Judge Lavergne resumed his questioning, Mr. Ponchaud confirmed that the church he had previously referred to was the Phnom Penh Cathedral, the municipality was the Bishop’s Palace, and Hotel Le Phnom is today the Le Royale hotel. When asked to describe the Khmer Rouge soldiers he met at the time, Mr. Ponchaud said there were two categories: young soldiers from 14 to 15 years old coming from the direction of Boeung Kak and stationed behind today’s municipal hall, and fierce-looking soldiers who were around 30 or older and were “bad people.” “If you look at their eyes they were very fierce indeed,” he recollected. “We did not want to get involved with them; we were simply terrified of them.” Mr. Ponchaud stated that people were moved out of the city by “psychological” force; they were happy and relieved when Khmer Rouge soldiers arrived in Phnom Penh because they assumed control without killing people.\n\nThe witness recounted that he had heard from others that the Khmer Rouge threw grenades inside hospitals when patients resisted their orders to leave. He said he heard from others that there were many wounded soldiers at Preah Ketomealea hospital, which the Khmer Rouge evacuated, but he did not witness this event.\n\nTestimony Revisits French Embassy in 1975\n\nReturning to the situation at the French embassy in 1975, Mr. Ponchaud confirmed to Judge Lavergne that marriages were arranged at the French embassy to facilitate the passage of some women, while some families also adopted orphans. He testified that people who took refuge inside the embassy were not important to the Khmer Rouge, which was focused on Cambodian people throughout the country. “Foreign nationals were not that important to the Khmer Rouge,” he said, adding that the Khmer Rouge assisted them and distributed rice and water when they ran out of food. “When the first batch of deportees left following April 30, the guard allowed us to kill the pigs around the French embassy to prepare food.” When asked if a representative of the Cambodian authorities was interacting with the French consul, Mr. Ponchaud recalled that someone was in charge of political negotiation – who told the embassy, for example, that Khieu Samphan wanted to meet them but was engaged elsewhere – but he could not recall his name, and Comrade Nhem assisted the embassy with securing food and water.\n\nJudge Lavergne quoted from note cited in Francois Bizot’s book, signed by Nhem, vice president of the northern front of Phnom Penh in charge of foreigners, dated April 25, 1975, which states that the GRUNK decided as of that date that all foreigners still residing in the capital would leave as of April 30, through Poipet. Mr. Ponchaud said he did not see the note, but there was a discussion between the councillor, Bizot, and a Cambodian counterpart. Judge Lavergne then cited a GRUNK Ministry of Foreign Affairs communiqué dated April 29, 1975, which states that diplomatic missions accredited by the former regime cannot request regular diplomatic relations. He then inquired as to why, according to Mr. Ponchaud, there were no negotiations regarding Cambodians seeking refuge at the French embassy. Mr. Ponchaud replied that there was no negotiation and from what he heard, the Khmer Rouge, brandishing AK-47s, called for the embassy to surrender the “seven traitors.” He added that he heard there was correspondence with Paris that permitted expulsion of the “seven traitors” from the embassy.\n\nCiting several telegrams between the French embassy in Phnom Penh and Paris in which people taking refuge inside the embassy were listed, Judge Lavergne noted that the French foreign ministry was requested to deliver those names to the municipality – which was demanding them – within the next 24 hours. He asked if GRUNK had announced that foreigners must leave Phnom Penh, to which the witness replied that by February 1975, Sihanouk had asked all foreigners to leave Cambodia. “[The] French government would like French people in Cambodia to leave Cambodia on March 19,” he added. “However, the French policy was not convincing because people trusted Prince Sihanouk and they had to wait and see.” Mr. Ponchaud told the court that a Chinese plane landed at Pochentong Airport on April 18, and there were others but he did not pay attention. He said that planes transported medicine from Bangkok, but the Khmer Rouge did not welcome such assistance.\n\nWhen asked if he understood why villages and towns were empty during his journey from Phnom Penh, Mr. Ponchaud told the court that he understood later after a cadre told him that Phnom Penh was not a good place, city people did not grow anything and therefore had to go to the countryside to grow crops so that they understood the value of rice. Later in France, the witness added, Ieng Sary explained the evacuation by saying that there was no food in the city, there was a lack of safety and security, and the Khmer Rouge were concerned about riots.\n\nHowever, to me the real reason behind this is more an ideology, a kind of reason that Angkar would like everyone to return to their hometown to become real Khmer because Khmer in Phnom Penh would be fake Cambodians. They had to move to the countryside, the home villages, to become the original Khmers.\n\nMr. Ponchaud commented that the Khmer Rouge were perhaps influenced by Mao Tse Tung’s cultural revolution that started in China in 1966 and that Mao appreciated Pol Pot for being brave enough to expel people from cities to the countryside. “Mao Tse Tung said that what he could not do could be done by Pol Pot and he appreciated the Khmer people for being that brave,” Mr. Ponchaud said.\n\nJudge Presses Witness on Citywide Evacuation\n\nJudge Lavergne inquired about Cambodian authorities’ reactions to information circulating about the evacuation, to which Mr. Ponchaud responded that he started probing for information starting in September 1975. The witness told the court that in France, Ieng Sary talked about good things in Cambodia, invited some students to return there, and said those who said bad things about Angkar were lying. Ieng Sary stayed that everything in Mr. Ponchaud’s book – published in 1977 – was wrong, he added.\n\nThe judge brought the witness’s attention to a press communiqué dated May 10, 1975, from the GRUNK Propaganda and Information Ministry, explaining that it had no choice but to force foreigners to leave. Though Mr. Ponchaud was unaware of the communiqué, he agreed that Angkar had paid attention to foreigners during a difficult period, but they were responsible for themselves and he would prefer to talk about Cambodian people at the time. When asked about his sources of information, the witness stated that he interviewed refugees, which one had to be cautious with because they sometimes exaggerated. He shared refugee accounts with other refugees in order to compare different stories and also listened to Democratic Kampuchea (DK) radio broadcasts:\n\nI supported Angkar, and I believed that leaders of Angkar got educated in France – they were intellectuals. They were well-educated, so they would know much about what happened in Cambodia and to learn more about them I started to listen more to … the radio broadcasts by the DK and I got friends of mine who recorded the radio broadcasts and had them sent to me to listen. I would like to know the ideology of the Khmer Rouge and, as I told you, I had the idea or I understood that Khmer Rouge would not comprise of bad people. I was convinced that these people had a better plan for the good of their country, they would never do damage to their own people, for sure. … I listened to the radio broadcasts and at the same time I tried to explain to the refugees what happened in the country.\n\nJudge Lavergne noted that in a written message to Judge Lemonde in December 2009, Mr. Ponchaud stated that he gave the judge summaries and French translations of 94 refugee accounts – about 300 typed pages – and translations and summaries of the accounts of about 100 refugees interviewed in Paris and Thailand. According to the message, Mr. Ponchaud gathered 94 accounts orally in Paris and Thailand between 1975 and 1976 and another priest took others down in refugee camps, which were translated and checked by Mr. Ponchaud in July 1976, mostly in Khmer with some in French. “The only aim of these accounts was to understand as best as possible the situation in DK in order for the French people to know about it,” Mr. Ponchaud stated, adding that he had used the documents to write his book and was unable to provide Khmer originals. Judge Lavergne inquired about the audio recordings of interviews with Khmer refugees, to which the witness replied that usually the interviews were recorded for verification but he had discarded these recordings.\n\nMr. Ponchaud told the court that he did not use the BBC as a source because he could not speak English but collected information about Cambodia from French bookstores that published and displayed communist books. He said such sources were sparse as Angkar did not write much.[35]Mr. Ponchaud confirmed that he had examined documents from the GRUNK mission in Paris. Judge Lavergne quoted from one such document, a transcript of an interview with Khieu Samphan dated August 12, 1975, which stated in part:\n\nOur compatriots by the millions were locked up in concentration camps in Phnom Penh and in the other cities under enemy temporary control. The victims had no food. Cholera was decimating them. Families were torn apart and scattered throughout the entire country. Immediately after the liberation, the GRUNK and the FUNK, the people, and the People’s Army decided to tackle these problems with determination.\n\nThe witness told the judge that he did not recall the interview, but it was propaganda that was completely different to the situation described by refugees. Mr. Ponchaud said people did not understand why Angkar made them work hard to build dykes and dig reservoirs. He stated:\n\nThe Angkar wanted people to build dykes and dams in order to be self-reliant and self-sufficient for the country. This is the principal agenda of Angkar, and I actually myself find it satisfactory. … I actually did not like the way they treated people, they abused people or they actually made people work too hard, but actually I think that the plan was very well implemented and structured.\n\nMr. Ponchaud explained that the Voice of DK broadcast the last part of Khieu Samphan’s dissertation – though they did not say that it was an excerpt from the dissertation – to motivate people to work. “It was a fairly good plan,” Mr. Ponchaud said.[36]\n\nFrancois Ponchaud Criticizes UN Action during and after Khmer Rouge Period\n\nAfter reading a lengthy list of sources used in Mr. Ponchaud’s various publications, Judge Lavergne zeroed in on his contribution to a report written by the International Commission of Jurists to the UN Human Rights Commission, published on August 16, 1978, in which he became one of the first to draw the international audience’s attention to events in Cambodia. Mr. Ponchaud testified that he did not understand the commissioner in Geneva who asked him to report to the UN committee on the human rights situation in Cambodia and proceeded to criticize the UN:\n\nBack then I was like an object from nowhere, from another alien planet. Nobody listened to me. They did not pay attention to what I said at all. I wondered why they did not listen to me – that’s why, to be frank, I do not really like the way the UN worked. … They had their agents along the border; they must have known it very well. They knew that the Khmer Rouge had killed a lot of civilian people, but they chose to be indifferent of the situation.\n\nMr. Ponchaud testified that because of the Cold War and U.S. defeat in Vietnam, “residual issues” were left to China, which gathered support in the UN against the Soviet Union and, from 1979 onwards, China and the UN used the Khmer Rouge against the Soviet Union. He continued:\n\nI am ashamed of the United Nations – they supported the Khmer Rouge for 19 years, even though they knew that the work that the Khmer Rouge had done was barbaric, and they killed innocent people, but they chose to be indifferent. What is the meaning of human rights? … We accept the value of human rights, but if we ignore the human rights abuses in the country I feel ashamed of the United Nations. I am actually ashamed that the United Nations is coming in and is now taking part in prosecuting the Khmer Rouge leaders. I am really ashamed of the United Nations; I don’t think that they should be involved in bringing the Khmer Rouge to trial now.\n\nMidway through Judge Lavergne’s lengthy reading of findings in a report on Cambodia to the UN Human Rights Commission in 1978 – he asked Mr. Ponchaud to assess whether he still thought the findings relevant today[37] – International Co-Lawyer for Khieu Samphan Arthur Vercken argued that the bench was going beyond the confines of the trial. Mr. Koppe also voiced uncertainty as to whether Mr. Ponchaud should be treated like an expert. In response, Mr. de Wilde said the defense was raising two matters: the first was the relevance of the document, which he felt was clear as a number of passages read out dealt with executions occurring just after April 17, 1975, involving military officers. Secondly, Mr. de Wilde stated, in 1978 the witness was considered to have particular expertise and was speaking as an expert at the time.\n\nAfter a consultation among judges, President Nonn said the objection from the Khieu Samphan defense was overruled, as the questions were put by the bench, which would analyze the probative value of testimony. With this decision, Judge Lavergne stated that information in the report was directly linked to the present trial, as there were findings regarding the evacuations:\n\nThe population of Phnom Penh and of all of the cities and towns in the government zones were evacuated in days that followed April 17, 1975. Hospitals were emptied, the injured and the ill had to leave their beds and those who were not able to move were executed, and this involved more than 4 million people and caused the death of many elderly people, young children, and pregnant women.\n\nUnder questioning about what information the findings were based on,[38] Mr. Ponchaud testified that he interviewed hundreds of refugees, but emphasized that during the Khmer Rouge regime one place was different from another and he gathered information only from Battambang but not from other locations. “I thought that people would receive the same treatment all across the country, but I learned that indeed people were treated differently from one place to another,” Mr. Ponchaud said. He stated that when he wrote the report, he was unaware of the war between Khmer and Vietnamese officials but the Khmer Rouge had attacked the Vietnamese at the border and the hostilities resulted in casualties. Mr. Ponchaud further noted what Ta Mok – in charge of the Southwest – called the “second revolution,” whereby cadres were reshuffled all over Cambodia. “By 1977 and 1978, people in the rank of the Khmer Rouge, a lot of them died,” he added.[39] With this response, proceedings were concluded and are set to resume on Wednesday, April 10, 2013, at 9 a.m. with further testimony of witness François Ponchaud.\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] Cambodia Tribunal Monitor’s daily blog posts on the ECCC are written according to the personal observations of the writer and do not constitute a transcript of the proceedings. Official court transcripts for the ECCC’s hearings may be accessed at http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/case/topic/2.\n\n[2]In his subsequent question, President Nonn stated that Mr. Ponchaud said he left Cambodia for six months in 1972. It was unclear in the English translation which answer is correct.\n\n[3]Samlaut is a district in Battambang province.\n\n[4]This is believed to be a reference to a French language magazine called L’Observateur launched by Khieu Samphan when he taught at the University of Phnom Penh.\n\n[5]Snuol is a district in Kratie province.\n\n[6]Chhroy Changvar is the name of a peninsula/bridge in Phnom Penh. Mr. Ponchaud seemed to state that a “Frenchman” fired at demonstrators, but his response was unclear in the English translation.\n\n[7]The location of Bos Knau is unclear.\n\n[8]Damnak Chang Eou is a commune in Preah Sihanouk province.\n\n[9]This is a reference to Kandal market in Phnom Penh.\n\n[10]This hotel is known today as Hotel Raffles le Royal in Phnom Penh.\n\n[11]Tuol Svay Prey is a commune near Olympic market in Phnom Penh.\n\n[12]Mr. Ponchaud’s recollection of this incident was unclear in the English translation.\n\n[13]It was unclear in the English translation if that Mr. Ponchaud was referring to 10 pm on April 16, 1975, or 10am on April 17, 1975.\n\n[14]Prek Phnou is an area located along National Road 5.\n\n[15]Mr. Ponchaud later referred to around 500 Pakistani nationals, but it was unclear in the English translation if these people had sought refuge in the French embassy.\n\n[16]The “seven super traitors” is a phrase that collectively refers to Lon Nol, Sirik Matak, Son Ngoc Thanh, Cheng Heng, In Tam, Long Boret and Sosthene Fernandez. However, Mr. Ponchaud also referred to a person named Bun Ho [correct spelling unclear from translation], a former senate official.\n\n[17]Ang Snuol is a district in Kampong Speu province.\n\n[18]Omleang is a village in Kampong Speu province.\n\n[19]François Bizot is the author of The Gate and testified in Case 001 at the ECCC in 2009.\n\n[20]This is believed to be a reference to Olympic Stadium in Phnom Penh.\n\n[21]Mr. Ponchaud’s response to President Nonn’s question about other embassies was unclear in the English translation.\n\n[22]It was unclear from the English translation if there was another group of foreigners permitted to leave the embassy after Mr. Ponchaud did.\n\n[23]Mr. Ponchaud’s response to this question was somewhat unclear in the English translation.\n\n[24]It is unclear from the English translation if Mr. Ponchaud is referring to Stung Trang district in Kampong Cham, or Stung Treng province, though the latter is likely based on the mention of the Ho Chi Minh Trail.\n\n[25]It is unclear to which documents Mr. Ponchaud is referring.\n\n[26]Neak Loeung is a town in Prey Veng province along the Mekong River.\n\n[27]Memut is a commune in Kampong Cham province.\n\n[28]The correct spelling of this location was unclear. The witness identified it as being north of Kampong Cham. The dates of Mr. Ponchaud’s travels to various areas were unclear in the translation.\n\n[29] Mr. Ponchaud’s response to this question was somewhat unclear in the English translation.\n\n[30]Thailand was formerly referred to as Siam.\n\n[31]Annam was a name used to refer to Vietnam, during the period when it was a French protectorate.\n\n[32] Mr. Ponchaud’s response to this question was somewhat unclear in the English translation.\n\n[33]Mr. Ponchaud’s response to this question was somewhat unclear in the English translation.\n\n[34]Kulen is a district in Siem Reap province.\n\n[35]At this point, Mr. Ponchaud commented that scholar Stephen Heder was the best researcher on DK and Angkar, but had previously not criticized the regime because he “enjoyed living in Cambodia”, before detailing disagreements over the translation of Khmer words. The English translation of this response was unclear and Judge Lavergne soon steered the examination away from linguistics.\n\n[36]Mr. Ponchaud’s response to this question was somewhat unclear in the English translation.\n\n[37]From this comment and a subsequent statement, it sounded as though Judge Lavergne was quoting from findings written by Mr. Ponchaud; however this was unclear in the English translation.\n\n[38] From this comment and a previous statement, it sounded as though Judge Lavergne is quoting from findings written by Mr. Ponchaud; however this was unclear in the English translation.\n\n[39] Mr. Ponchaud’s response to this question was somewhat unclear in the English translation.\n\n…. as reported in Peking Review,1970-1973\n\nreturn\n\nSpecial Message of Cambodian Head of State Samdech Norodom Sihanouk to the People’s Forces and Royal Forces Of National Liberation\n\nSource: Peking Review, No. 21， May 22, 1970\n\nTranscribed by http://www.wengewang.org\n\n*Extends warm greetings to the two contingents of patriotic forces for fighting courageously together and winning glorious victories during the past month and a half.\n\n*Calls on all patriotic countrymen to unite and drive the U.S. imperialists and their south Vietnamese running dogs out of the country and overthrow the Lon Nol-Sirik Matak traitors’ clique.\n\nDear Compatriots,\n\nAllow me to address this Special Message to you in order to pay tribute, with my most profound gratitude, to the armed forces of our Khmer people and to the loyal and patriotic Khmer royal armed forces which have united with the former in the N.U.K.K.\n\nFirst of all, I most sincerely congratulate and thank the heroic members of the two patriotic armed forces which have in the past one and a half months made tremendous sacrifices and carried out admirable military actions shoulder to shoulder with each other, winning numerous glorious victories over the enemy — the armed forces of the U.S. imperialist neo-colonialists, those of their Saigon lackeys (Thieu-Ky) and those of their Phnom Penh lackeys (the Lon Nol and Sink Matak reactionaries).\n\nHowever, the enemy has enormous effectives at its disposal (more than 50,000 men of the Lon Nol army, more than 60,000 men of the army of Thieu-Ky, more than 10,000 men of the “Khmers Serei” and more than 10,000 men of Uncle Sam). We can thus see that to repress our people and to carry out aggression against, occupy, destroy and colonize our country, the enemy has employed more than 130,000 men. These troops have received from the Washington government ultramodern military equipment, arms and engines of war.\n\nIn order to crush our people and destroy our country, they have dispatched vast ground, air and naval forces against them.\n\nDespite all this, our people’s army, backed by the troops, provincial guards and police of the royal forces, which have gone to the jungles, has successfully inflicted daily defeats upon the enemy.\n\n* * *\n\nBefore the massive invasion of our national territory by the Americans, the armed forces of our N.U.F.K. had already won very brilliant victories over the wretched mercenaries of the traitors Lon Nol-Sirik Matak in Koh Thorn, Saang, Koki, Chipou, Prasaut. Krek, Memot, Snoul, Angtassom, Takeo, Kep, Kamchay Mea, Chhlong, etc. … and our people’s administration had been established In many provinces and districts, particularly In Svay Rleng, Prey Veng, Kandal, Kom-pong Chhnang, Kompong Speu, Takeo, Kampot, Mon-dolkirl, Ratanakirl, Kratle and Stung Treng.\n\nOur people’s army had already surrounded Phnom Penh and was on the point of taking the capital by assault.\n\nIn view of this, U.S. President Nixon, in order to save “the skin” of the regime of his vile lackeys Lon Nol-Sirik Matak, formally ordered his supreme command to dispatch without delay the Yankee troops, the south Vietnamese mercenaries and the “Khmer Serei” mercenaries (so-called Free Khmers) against our people.\n\nAt present, the Americans and their Saigon mercenaries are reducing to ashes our villages, districts and cities, particularly those in the provinces of Svay Rieng, Kompong Cham, Kratie. Prey Veng, Kandal, Ratana-kiri and Mondolkiri. There, they raze everything to the ground: houses, compartments, fields, markets, etc. . . . There, they rob (he inhabitants of their property. There, they mercilessly slaughter the common people, old people, women and children.\n\nThe only “crime” committed by these poor victims was their loyalty to the nation, to the throne and to their “Samdech Papa,” their love for national independence, democracy and neutrality, and their refusal to serve the interests of big capitalist reactionaries and the interests of the U.S. imperialists.\n\nThe people of the world have expressed their reprobation and repulsion of these horrible acts of the American invaders and occupationists. Even the students of all the universities in the United States have vehemently protested against Nixon.\n\nOnly the Lon Nol-Sirik Malak gang has the impudence to express its joy at and great admiration of its U.S. master and its evils and crimes.\n\nThe Americans and their south Vietnamese mercenaries have come to our country to occupy our land, oppress our nation, reduce to ashes our cities, villages, districts and provinces, and establish their dictatorial rule in our country, turning Cambodia into their colony. This fact has been presented to the world by the traitors to the Khmer motherland as an American intervention to “save” Cambodia and “preserve” its independence, freedom, neutrality and territorial integrity (sic)!\n\nThis is an abominable treason that our people and the history of our Kampuchea will never pardon.\n\nOn May 5, an AFP dispatch by Bernard Ulimann told the world that “the Cambodian premier, General Lon Not today expressed gratitude to President Nixon for helping him defend Cambodia’s neutrality.”\n\nThat’s the limit! At a lime when many U.S. Congressmen do not hesitate publicly to hold Nixon responsible for destroying the Independence, neutrality and peace of Cambodia with the sole purpose of saving a handful of traitors from certain defeat in ihe face of the Khmer people’s army, Lon Nol is unashamed to affirm that the intervention of its American masters is an act to “save” the neutrality of Cambodia!\n\nThe subordinates of Lon Nol are fellows without dignity and without shame like him.\n\nAccording to an AP dispatch from Tokyo on May 7, “Cambodian premier Lon Nol’s special envoy, Sim Var, said the Cambodian people support (sic) the U.S. intervention as a step to defend this country’s neutrality (sic). Sim made the statement at a meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Kiichi Aichi Wednesday evening. He asked for Japanese economic aid. . . .”\n\nThat is also the limit!\n\nAccording to a UPI dispatch of May 8, “Cambodian ambassador Khimtit has informed U.N. Secretariat. . the Cambodian government. . . referring to Nixon’s April 30 message announcing the advance of U.S. forces. . . within Cambodia. . . notes with satisfaction that the President of the U.S.A. took into account in his decision the legitimate aspirations of the Cambodian people (sic). . . expressed its gratitude to President Nixon for this assistance in defending (sic) Cambodia’s neutrality.”\n\nThis despicable message to the United Nations is also a “summit” of treason to and slander against the Cambodian people.\n\nAmerican imperialism sends its troops to destroy independent and neutral Cambodia. The Lon Nol gang passes this “strangulation” of Khmer independence and neutrality off as an act “conforming to the legitimate aspirations of the Khmer people”!\n\nThe local press in Lon Nol’s pay has aroused, for its part, the aversion and scorn of the Khmer people and of world opinion by its dithyrambic articles lauding without rhyme or reason the (American) “great patron.”\n\nAccording to an AFP dispatch by Bernard Ulimann on May 7, Le Courrier Phnompenhois showers fulsome flattery on its master Nixon in the following manner: “We are assured of the support of a big nation thanks to the clear-sightedness of its president . . this president’s courageous decision will put him on an equal rank with other great presidents like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, the paper added.”\n\nSuch base and incongruous flattery like this has aroused the repulsion of all Khmer patriots and of world opinion.\n\nWorld opinion scorns the Lon Nol gang all the more because Nixon is entirely contrary to what Washington and Lincoln had been.\n\nNixon has never been a hero of the independence or emancipation of the peoples; on the contrary, he has to his credit the aggression against a number of countries and peoples and the suppression of their independence and democracy, for example: south Viet Nam, Laos and Cambodia which have lost everything, peace, freedom, independence, unity and territorial integrity.\n\nTherefore, today the gang of Lon Nol-Sirik Matak-Sim Var-Cheng Heng-Trinh Hoanh-Khimtit and company has completely unmasked itself before our Buddhist monk- and our people who have recognized their true nature as traitors of the most despicable kind and who have recognized that both their policy and deeds are the very opposite of their propaganda, just as black is the opposite of white.\n\nThat is why today our citizens of both sexes and of all sections, especially our peasants, workers and other working people, those soldiers, provincial guards and policemen who are not traitors, our youth and intellectuals, our living forces are giving our people’s National Liberation Army massive support\n\nAlthough the enemy possesses enormous military means, our Liberation Army has been winning victories, for example: the capture of the cities of Kratie, Sen Monorom, Stung Treng, Chhouk, etc. . . ; the encirclement and isolation of the cities of Prey Veng, Takeo, Kampot, etc. . .; the cutting off of the communication, telegraphic and telephone lines between more than 20 urban centres and Phnom Penh. Meanwhile in 13 provinces (including Batlambang) a large part of the population has been freed from the control of the Lon Nol administration.\n\nIn view of these very important successes and victories, permit me, heroic fighters, to extend to you in my own name and on behalf of our N.U.F.K., the Royal Government of National Union headed by Samdech Penn Nouth, and the Khmer nation our heartfelt gratitude, our warmest congratulations and our deepest admiration.\n\nI extend in particular the same sentiments to my comrades Khieu Samphan, Minister of National Defence, Hou Yuen, Minister of Interior, and Hu Nim, Minister of Information, and their valiant assistants.\n\nAt the same time I have the honour to convey to all our heroic fighters of the National Liberation Armed Forces the most heartfelt congratulations and admiration from their excellencies the ambassadors and charge d’affaires of the socialist, non-aligned, progressive and anti-imperialist countries.\n\nIn conclusion, 1 most respectfully bow in sorrow in memory of our heroes fallen in battle against the enemies of our people, our nation and our Khmer country; I also respectfully bow in memory of our compatriots murdered by the Lon Nol gang, and of those who fell victim to the U.S. and mercenary forces or their savage air raids.\n\nI call upon the soldiers, provincial guards, policemen and functionaries who are still under the command of Lon Nol to follow the lofty patriotic example set by the great majority of our nation which has already risen like one man to fight unyieldingly and uncompromisingly against the most ferocious enemies of our motherland and our race — the American imperialist neo-colonialists and their flunkeys, these unpardonable renegades, Asians who betray Asia, Indo-Chinese who betray Indo-China, Khmers who betray Kampuchea.\n\nThey should ponder over the facts which I revealed to them at the beginning of this message.\n\nIn addition, they should know that the Lon Nol clique holds them in great contempt: in order to “save the skin” of its regime, this clique does not trust them at all; it prefers to turn to the “Khmer Serei” mercenaries of Son Ngoc Thanh, paid by the American C.I.A. and trained by the notorious “Green Berets.” These mercenaries are now stationed around Phnom Penh.\n\nLon Nol-Sirik Matak have openly begged the United States to dispatch “Free” Khmer troops from Saigon to Phnom Penh; “diplomatic” contacts are being made by these renegades with Bangkok, Saigon, Taipeh and Seoul whose “governments” are known to the world as recognized flunkeys of U.S. imperialism; diplomatic relations are or will soon be established with these flunkeys — all these facts are glaring proof that their coup d’etat of March 18 was essentially aimed at “throwing” Cambodia and the Khmer nation into an abyss of disastrous bellicosity and U.S. enslavement.\n\nThey should see that clearly. All the people in the world have seen that clearly.\n\nThus a great number of European, Asian, Arab, African and Latin American countries have decided to sever all relations with the present regime of Phnom Penh and to establish diplomatic relations with the new Royal Government of National Union Under the Leadership of the N.U.F.K. which they recognize officially and solemnly as the sole, only legal Government of Cambodia and its people.\n\nAnti-imperialist countries which had embassies in Phnom Penh have decided to close these embassies and have ordered their personnel as well as all their experts and technicians to leave the city where a despicable clique reigns, a clique which has allowed U.S. imperialism to colonize the Khmer motherland and put her to fire and sword, while congratulating and thanking U.S. imperialism for it.\n\nIn the future only the countries subservient to or friendly with the United States will maintain or establish their embassies in Phnom Penh in an attempt to consolidate the shaky foundations of the traitorous Lon Nol-Sirik Matak regime.\n\nThey (soldiers, guards, policemen and functionaries) should consequently cast away all illusions from their minds and act as good Khmers who are concerned with the supreme interests of the nation and their own dignity. To act as good Khmers means that they should completely quit the service of the traitors who have sold their own country to the Americans and allowed them to destroy it. If they have not enough courage to go and live in the jungles, they should turn over their arms to the National Liberation Army. After that, they can return to their native cities or villages to live as peaceable citizens.\n\nMany of our young peasants to whom the Lon Nol regime had issued rifles hurried off to the jungles with their rifles. Others who were unwilling to abandon their paddy fields and farmland showed their patriotism by turning over their rifles to the people’s troops in the jungles.\n\nI got this stirring news from dispatches of the U.S. press itself.\n\nThey (the soldiers, guards and policemen) should follow the lofty example of our peasants.\n\n* * *\n\nIf I ask all our compatriots of combat age to accept such sacrifices, it is not for the sake of the interests of Sihanouk, but for the sake of the supreme interests of the motherland which must be liberated at all costs, and also for the sake of people’s own interests, for the sake of building for themselves and their children a new life conforming to the just and legitimate aspirations of the working people, of all our people.\n\nAs far as I am concerned, if I am fighting by your side, that is simply because it is my duty as a Khmer citizen to do so and also because I have a debt to discharge, my gratitude to all those who have always affectionately trusted me.\n\nAs to my future, I desire nothing other than the satisfaction of having my duty accomplished.\n\nWith regard to the managing of the country (education of the people, organization and defence of national territory, administration of the liberated townships, districts, provinces and cities, etc. . .), I have entrusted it entirely to the patriotic persons who are now leading the national resistance in the country, particularly Comrades Khicu Samphan, Hou Yuon and HU Nim.\n\nThus, all of you who participate in the struggle are righting for the motherland, for yourselves and for your families.\n\nI am convinced that with the protection and support of our Buddhist monks, all our compatriots who faithfully love the motherland and refuse to sell it out will rise and unite to fight and drive out of our beloved Kampuchea all the American arch criminal invaders and their no less criminal south Vietnamese lackeys, and to mercilessly overthrow the gang of traitors, sellers and destroyers of the country and the nation, a gang headed by Lon Nol and Sirik Matak. Let these hideous devils go to hell and never return to haunt our people and the motherland.\n\nLong live the people’s National Liberation Army!\n\nLong live the patriotic soldiers, provincial guards and policemen who are fighting shoulder to shoulder with the people’s army against the enemies of the motherland!\n\nDown with U.S. imperialism and its Phnom Penh and Saigon lackeys!\n\nCambodian Head of State Samdech Norodom Sihanouk Meets Le Duan, First Secretary of Central Committee Of Viet Nam Workers’ Party\n\nSource: Peking Review, No. 21， May 22, 1970\n\nSamdech Norodom Sihanouk, Head of Slate of Cambodia and Chairman of the National United Front of Kampuchea, met Le Duan, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Viet Nam Workers’ Party, in Peking on May 12, according to an announcement made by the Office of\n\nSamdech Norodom Sihanouk, Head of Slate of Cambodia and Chairman of the National United Front of Kampuchea.\n\nPresent were Chan You ran, Minister of Popular Education and Youth of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia; Thiounn Mumm, Minister of Economy and Finance of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia; and Ngo Thuyen, Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam to China.\n\nThe meeting proceeded in a cordial and friendly atmosphere.\n\nStatement by Command of Cambodian National Liberation Army\n\nSource: Peking Review, No. 21， May 22, 1970\n\nCalling on the patriotic armed forces and people of Cambodia to advance courageously and defeat the U.S. imperialists and their henchmen; declaring that the Joint Declaration adopted by the Summit Conference of the Indo-Chinese Peoples is the programme of action and immediate combat objective of the Cambodian National Liberation Army and pledging to unite closely with the fraternal armed forces and peoples of Viet Nam and Laos in jointly fighting to defeat the U.S. imperialists’ schemes of aggression.\n\nThe Command of the Cambodian National Liberation Army in the liberated area of Cambodia issued on May 3 a statement on the Summit Conference of the Indo-Chinese Peoples, according to a VNA report quoting the Information Bureau of the National United Front of Kampuchea. The statement reads in full:\n\nIn face of the betrayal by the Lon Nol-Sirik Matak clique and the danger of armed aggression by the U.S. imperialists against Cambodia’s territory, the entire Khmer people have risen up at the same lime to wage a courageous struggle against the acts of aggression of the U.S. imperialists and to overthrow the reactionary clique, their henchmen. It is in this high tide of 6truggle of the Khmer people that the Cambodian National Liberation Army came into being.\n\nThe Cambodian National Liberation Army comprises the sons of the patriotic Khmer people of all strata, victims of oppression and repression by the reactionary Lon Nol-Sirik Matak clique. Every cadre and fighter of the Cambodian National Liberation Army, nurturing profound hatred for the traitors and aggressors, is holding firm his gun to fight beside the entire people till final victory for the liberation of the motherland and the people and for the building of an Independent, democratic, genuinely neutral and prosperous Cambodia.\n\nResponding to the call of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, Head of State of Cambodia, the Cambodian National Liberation Army has, together with the entire people, repeatedly attacked the enemy and liberated hundreds of hamlets and villages, dozens of sub-sectors and district towns together with tens of thousands of people from the grip of the reactionary Lon Nol-Sirik Matak clique, and set up committees of the National United Front of Kampuchea (N.U.F.K.) at various levels in the newly liberated areas.\n\nWhile the offensive of the Khmer people against their enemy was going full steam, a historic event of extreme importance took place: the Summit Conference of the Indo-Chinese Peoples was held and yielded brilliant success.\n\nAll officers and men of the Cambodian National Liberation Army consider the great success of the conference as a great stimulus to the fighting spirit of our armed forces. The Joint Declaration unanimously adopted by the conference will be the programme of action and immediate combat objective of our Cambodian National Liberation Army. Together with the people of all strata at home, we pledge ourselves to unite closely with the fraternal armed forces and peoples of Viet Nam and Laos in fighting resolutely to defeat all schemes of aggression of the U.S. imperialists, overthrow the reactionary regime of the Lon Nol-Sirik Matak clique and build a new, really independent and free Cambodia.\n\nThe U.S. imperialists masterminded the coup d’etat that deposed Head of State Samdech Norodom Sihanouk. It was also they who secretly supplied weapons to the reactionary Lon Nol-Sirik Matak clique to repress our people’s movement for justice, peace, independence, neutrality and genuine democracy. But the reactionaries are isolated at home and in the world and the mighty waves of struggle of the people have inflicted heavy losses on them, dooming them to certain and complete defeat.\n\nTo save his henchmen from their dangerous situation, U.S. President Nixon brazenly announced on April 30 the dispatch of U.S. troops to Cambodia and openly supplied weapons to the reactionary Lon Nol troops to repress the struggle of our compatriots.\n\nAt present, tens of thousands of U.S. and south Viet Nam puppet troops have invaded Cambodia’s territory from south Viet Nam. This is a flagrant act of aggression by the U.S. imperialists against our beloved Cambodian motherland. The Cambodian National Liberation Army and the entire Khmer people vehemently condemn this towering crime of the U.S. imperialists. The U.S. imperialists have been defeated in Viet Nam and Laos, they will certainly sustain ignominious defeat in Cambodia, too, in face of the resolute and vigorous fight of our armed forces and people, the strength of militant solidarity of the Cambodian, Vietnamese and Laotian peoples and the worldwide protest of the peace-loving and progressive peoples.\n\nTo greet the success of the Summit Conference of the Indo-Chinese Peoples in a most practical way and defeat the U.S. imperialists’ new schemes of aggression, the command calls on all officers and men of the National Liberation Army throughout the country to carry out resolutely and courageously the following tasks:\n\n1. Quickly develop our forces in all three categories: militia and guerrilla, regional forces and regular army. We must in the course of fighting build up the strength of our armed forces in order to win more victories and grow up quickly in battle.\n\n2. Attack with determination and at the same time enemy troops of all types — the reactionary troops of Lon Nol, the American aggressor troops, the south Viet Nam puppet troops and the “Khmer Serei,” etc. so as to whittle down and annihilate the enemy effectives, in close co-ordination with the uprising of the people to expand the liberated areas end set up the people’s power.\n\n3. Carry out well political work among the enemy troops by explaining to them our just line, disintegrate them, making them refuse to collaborate with the reactionary Lon Nol-Sirik Matak clique and to serve as henchmen of the United States as already made clear in Head of State Samdech Norodom Sihanouk’s appeal, actively help individuals or units of the enemy troops cross over to the people’s side and fight beside us under the banner of the N.U.F.K. to wipe out the common enemy of the nation,\n\n4. Unite closely with the people of all strata at home and foreign residents, especially Vietnamese and Chinese residents. Strictly observe discipline concerning our relations with the masses and refrain from any encroachment upon the life and property of the people.\n\nRealize the “army-people one-mindedness,” the army being the fish and the people the water, defend the life and property of the people against the repression and exploitation by the Lon Nol-Sirik Matak clique and the U.S. aggressors.\n\nThe command is convinced that under the glorious fighting banner of the motherland, inspired by the success of the Summit Conference of the Indo-Chinese Peoples, with the strength of the militant solidarity of the three peoples of Cambodia, Viet Nam and Laos, with the sympathy and support of the peace-loving and progressive people in the world, our Khmer people and armed forces will certainly attain our immediate fighting objectives. Since the U.S. aggressors and their henchmen are still hatching many perfidious and cruel plots, many difficulties and hardships are still ahead of us, but it is certain that in the end the enemy will be defeated by the peoples and armed forces of Cambodia, Viet Nam and Laos and we will win total victory.\n\nWe wilt certainly win!\n\nThe U.S. aggressors and the clique of traitors will certainly be defeated!\n\nLong live really independent, neutral and democratic Cambodia!\n\nLong live the National United Front of Kampuchea!\n\nAll our officers and men, march forward courageously under the glorious fighting banner of the motherland!\n\nStatement of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, Head of State of Cambodia\n\nSource: Peking Review, No. 21， May 22, 1970\n\n* The United Slates has no right to intervene militarily in Cambodia.\n\n* The Cambodian people will not tolerate the so-called Asian conference engineered by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to interfere in the internal affairs of Cambodia.\n\nThe Private Secretarial of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, Head of State of Cambodia, issued to the press in Peking on April 30 a statement of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, Head of Stale of Cambodia and Chairman of the National United Front of Kampuchea, dated April 30. The text of the statement reads in full as follows:\n\n1. Certain imperialist or pro-imperialist circles have tried to minimize the importance of the resolutions of the recent Summit Conference of the Indo-Chinese Peoples, stressing that in these resolutions there is neither the formation of a “united front of the Indo-Chinese peoples/’ nor the establishment of an organ of “co-operation” nor the expression of the determination to intensify the efforts of struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism.\n\nActually, the united front of the Indo-Chinese peoples exists de facto. Proof of this can be found in the following passages of the Joint Declaration signed on April 25, 1970:\n\n“The conference . . . arrived at a unanimous appraisal … of the struggle of the three Indo-Chinese peoples against the common enemy, the American imperialist aggressors and their lackeys.” . . .\n\n“In the face of this common enemy, the peoples of Indo-China have fought side by side in defence of their sacred national rights.”\n\n. . . “The conference calls on the three peoples to redouble their vigilance, strengthen their solidarity and intensify the struggle against the common enemy — American imperialism and its flunkeys in the three countries — until complete victory.*’\n\n. . . “The different parties undertake to do everything possible to render mutual support in accordance with the desire of the interested party and on the basis of mutual respect.”\n\nIn this respect, an organ of liaison or co-operation is unnecessary because our four parties are in constant touch through diplomatic channels or at frequent meetings at the summit or at lower levels among responsible Khmer, Laotian and Vietnamese officials: “The parties agree,” says the declaration, “that meetings will take place whenever it is necessary between their highest-level leaders or between competent representatives for exchanges of views on problems of common interest.”\n\n. . . “The parties affirm their determination to . . . give mutual support in the struggle against the common enemy and to co-operate in the future and on a long-term basis in the building of each country following the road which it finds appropriate.”\n\nAs to the intensification of the efforts of straggle, it finds expression in the concluding part of the Joint Declaration:\n\n“They (the three peoples) have forged an indestructible solidarity . . . they possess greater strength . . -the three Indo-Chinese peoples on their victorious advance will make full use of their position of having the initiative and being on the offensive and persistently carry on and intensify the struggle in all fields, …”\n\n2. Being aware that the regime of their valets Lon Nol-Sirik Matak is beset with mounting difficulties resulting from its unpopularity, its atrocious and unpardonable crimes and the series of military defeats inflicted upon it by the Khmer People’s Liberation Army, the U.S. imperialists have ordered certain governments of their “allies” and satellites to launch several “schemes” designed lo save the loitering Phnom Penh regime from its inevitable doom.\n\nIt is necessary to mention among these “Schemes\n\n(a) A so-called Asian conference on Cambodia;\n\n(b) Formation of a so-called coalition government in Phnom Penh;\n\n(c) Internationalization of the civil war in Cambodia which has become “a foreign invasion’ in the mouths of President Nixon and his lackeys. Adam Malik, Thanat Khoman and company.\n\nIn the name of the Khmer people who are now fighting against the pro-American traitors and their master, U.S. imperialism. I have the honour to set forth our official position with regard to these three “schemes” as follows:\n\n(a) We deny in advance the right of the de-Asianized and Americanized governments of Bangkok, Seoul and Saigon and the non-Asian governments of Canberra and Wellington to interfere in whatever manner in the internal affairs of the Indo-Chinese peoples, of the Khmer people in particular.\n\nIndo-China belongs to the Indo-Chinese alone. The affairs of Cambodia concern only the Cambodians. The throe Indo-Chinese countries know only one foreign invasion, that is, the invasion by the United States, the sole violator of the Geneva Agreements of 1954 on Indo-China and that of 1962 on Laos.\n\nTherefore, if the de-Asianized Asians, Americanized Asians and servile Asian dependents of the United States as well as the sham Asians are to meet at a conference, they should put on the agenda of this conference the sole question of unconditional, total and immediate withdrawal of the ground, naval and air forces of the United States and its satellites from Indo-China.\n\nWe recall that among the future participants in the projected sham Asian conference are those like Thailand, south Korea, Australia and New Zealand which, by sending their soldiers, have invaded and are committing aggression against south Viet Nam on the orders of U.S. imperialism.\n\nThe conference to be convened by Mr. Adam Malik, the well-known servant of the United States, should therefore limit its “ambition” to bringing about a halt to this invasion and aggression,\n\n(b) We condemn in advance all solutions to be concocted by the United States directly or through intermediary “friendly” governments for the governmental problem of Phnom Penh with a view to giving Lon Nol a new chance of maintaining its power.\n\nUnless this regime of the sanguinary traitor resigns totally and the arch traitors go into exile abroad, there will be no question of the Khmer people and their Liberation Army accepting any “modus Vivendi” with the corrupted Rightist and ultra-Rightist criminals and servants of U.S. imperialism.\n\nThe Khmer people and their National United Front of Kampuchea and Liberation Army will continue lo light guns in hand, even if it should lake them several years till the Lon Nol-Sirik Matak regime is crushed, the traitors and their chief accomplices are punished and U.S. imperialism is rendered unable lo engineer another coup against Cambodia like that of March IB. 1970.\n\n(c) We resolutely condemn the attempts made by the Washington government and other governments acting as its accomplices lo describe the Khmer people’s armed resistance to the fascist and traitorous Lon Nol regime as “foreign invasion” so as to justify the intervention ir, Cambodia by the imperialist and satellite forces.\n\nAt present, with the support of the other brother peoples of Indo-China, the Khmer people alone, under the banner of the National United Front of Kampuchea, assume the responsibility of liberating Cambodia.\n\nThis conforms to the April 25 Joint Declaration of the Summit Conference of the Indo-Chinese Peoples in letter and in spirit. The declaration says:\n\n“Inspired by the principle that the liberation and defence of each country is the affair of its own people, the different parties undertake to do everything possible lo render mutual support in accordance with the desire of the interested party and on the basis of mutual respect.”\n\nWe therefore declare that neither the United States nor any other country or government outside Indo-China has the right to intervene militarily in Indo-China in general and in Cambodia in particular.\n\nAs far as our country Cambodia is concerned, we draw the attention of the powers outside Indo-China to the very grave consequences of their present or eventual intervention, for which they alone are to be held responsible.\n\nsigned: N.

Four countries are the lackeys of the United Stales in its war against the Indo-Chinese peoples, and the rest consuls of governments closely subordinated to America politically and economically.\n\nThis so-called Asian conference has no other aim than lo confirm the illegal authority of the Lon Nol-Sirik Matak clique rejected by the Khmer people and condemned by the international community for its methods of tyrannical, racist, sanguinary and barbarous rule.\n\nIt is impermissible that a group of countries assume the right to handle the Cambodian affairs without the knowledge of and against the will of the Cambodian people. It is a grave interference in the internal affairs of another state and a flagrant violation of its sovereignty. This is contrary to the U.N. Charter.\n\nIt is alleged that this so-called conference intends to find some solutions aimed at safeguarding the independence and neutrality of Cambodia, while the members of this conference are the servile lackeys of the United States which is committing monstrous crimes against the independence and sovereignty of this country. This is the peak of nonsense and hypocrisy. This massive invasion of Cambodia by the American troops and the troops of their Saigon lackeys has been condemned by the whole world and. first of all, by the American people.\n\nIf it really wanted to safeguard the independence and neutrality of Cambodia, it should in the first place condemn the United Stales and its lackeys for this Open aggression against the sovereignty of a member .state of the United Nations. The United States is the ferocious destroyer of the peace of the Cambodian people and of world peace.\n\nThe Cambodian problem concerns no one other than the Cambodian people. It can be settled easily by the latter after the complete withdrawal of the troops of the United States and their lackeys, and this withdrawal should be immediate.\n\nThe Royal Government of National Union, on the other hand, thanks the countries which have refused the Invitation to participate in this so-called conference. By their correct attitude they contribute to the effort of not making the Cambodian and Indo-Chinese affairs complicated. These countries are Burma. India, Pakistan, Ceylon. Afghanistan and Nepal.\n\nPeking, May 17, 1970\n\nStatement of Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia\n\nStatement of the Royal Government of National Union Under the Leadership of the N.U.F.K.\n\nSource: Peking Review, No. 21， May 22, 1970\n\nThe Royal Government of National Union Under the Leadership of the N.U.F.K. reiterate:, that it is not a “government in exile.” Moreover, it reiterates that three of its members continue lo lead our armed forces in battle in our own country: this proves that the Government of National Union has deep roots in Cambodia With the extension of the liberated areas, (he other members of the Government will return lo our beloved motherland to carry on the fighting and organize the administration of the country in Conformity with the Political Programme of the N.U.F.K.\n\nFurthermore, the swiftness with which the Cambodian people have responded extensively to the March 23. 1970 historic appeal of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk. Head of State, and the vigour with which the National Liberation Army of the N.U.F.K. has dealt blows at I he American troops and the mercenary troops of Saigon, which dared to trample on the soil of our country, and at the troops of the Lon Nol-Sirik Matak apprentices-dictators, lackeys of the C.I.A. — all this clearly shows that the Royal Government of National Union has the full and enthusiastic support of the Cambodian people.\n\nSince the American imperialists have the impudence lo attack the sovereignty, peace and neutrality of our motherland, the Cambodian people will assuredly counter-attack them triumphantly.\n\nPeking May 10, 1970\n\nRoyal Government of National Union of Cambodia Severs Diplomatic Relations With United States\n\nStatement of the Royal Government of National Union Under the Leadership of the N.U.F.K. on the Rupture of Diplomatic Relations With the Government of the United States of America\n\nSource: Peking Review, No. 21， May 22, 1970\n\nExperience shows that the American imperialists were and remain to be the most ferocious, most implacable, most treacherous and most dangerous enemies of the Cambodian people, of their policy of national independence, peace and neutrality, and of their leader Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, Head of State.\n\nThe American imperialists refused to sign the 1954 Geneva Agreements on Indo-China.\n\nThey created the aggressive SEATO pact. They flagrantly bombed and strafed our frontier villages, rendering thousands of women, children and old people innocent victims in addition to grave material damage.\n\nFinally the C.I.A., on Nixon’s orders, started a course of action culminating in the military coup d’etat of March 18, 1970. and the installation in Phnom Penh of a fascist and racist dictatorial regime at the U.S. imperialists’ disposal headed by Lon Nol-Sirik Matak.\n\nIn the past few days, trampling underfoot their solemn statement of recognizing and respecting the policy of national independence, peace and neutrality of Cambodia, and the territorial integrity of our country within its present borders, the American imperialists have invaded our country on a large scale and savagely bombed our defenceless cities and villages.\n\nThis typical intervention of the American imperialists in our internal affairs runs counter to all international laws. Its sole purpose is to save the tottering Lon Nol-Sirik Matak regime unanimously spurned by the Cambodian people, because the whole world has come to see and is aware that without this criminal, large-scale intervention, the armed forces of the N.U.F.K. would already be in Phnom Penh at this moment.\n\nThis extension of the war on the Indo-Chinese Peninsula is a direct threat to national independence and peace in Southeast Asia and the world.\n\nIn the face of this grave escalation, all the people and countries cherishing peace and freedom and in solidarity with our people heroically fighting to regain their sacred rights, have most severely denounced and condemned the invasion of Cambodia by the American-south Vietnamese troops.\n\nIn view of these crimes and this unjustifiable invasion committed by the American imperialists and in view of their typical violations of the solemn statements which had led to the resumption of diplomatic relations between Cambodia and the United States, the Royal Government of National Union Under the Leadership of the N.U.F.K., the sole legal and legitimate Government of the Cambodian people, decides to sever from this day all diplomatic and consular relations with the Government of the United States. The responsibility for this rupture rests entirely and solely with the American Government.\n\nThe Royal Government of National Union avails itself of this occasion to renew its appeal to the peace-and freedom-loving people and countries in the world to firmly support the just cause of the Cambodian people by refusing to recognize and co-operate with the Lon Nol-Sirik Matak puppet regime.\n\nPeking, May 10, 1970\n\nCambodian Head of State Samdech Sihanouk Writes to Premier Chou En-lai —Expressing deepest gratitude for Chinese Government’s October 10 statement\n\nSource: Peking Review, No. 43, October 23, 1970\n\nHis Excellency Mr. Chou En-lai, Premier of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China\n\nRespected Mr. Premier,\n\nIn the name of the Khmer people, the National United Front of Kampuchea, the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia and in my own name, we beg Your Excellency to kindly convey to His Excellency the venerated and beloved Chairman Mao Tsetung, to His Excellency the respected Vice-Chairman Lin Piao, to the Chinese Government and the great Chinese people our deepest gratitude for the statement of the Government of the People’s Republic China issued on October 10, exposing the fraud of the Phnom Penh traitors, lackeys of the U.S. imperialists, in their so-called “republicanization” of the Khmer state, and reaffirming the very powerful and total support of China and its people for the Kingdom of Cambodia, the symbol of loyally to the Khmer people, their supreme interests and their dignity, and the symbol of attachment to the ideals of democracy, freedom, progress and independence.\n\nWe are eternally grateful to China, the best friend and the greatest and most effective support of the Khmer people, for its equity with regard to the Khmer monarchy at a time when the Phnom Penh traitors are unjustly heaping all “sins” on it, shamelessly and unblushingly distorting the 2,000-ycar history of our race. In this regard, the Government of the People’s Republic of China, of which Your Excellency respected and loved by all the patriotic Khmers is the eminent Premier, has made the following historical testimony to the world: “Whether a state is progressive or reactionary depends not on whether it bears the name of a kingdom or a republic, but on whether or not the policy it follows represents the interests of the people and whether or not its policy is anti-imperialist. There are certain kingdoms which pursue a policy of peace and neutrality, oppose imperialist aggression and defend their national independence, thus winning the approval and support of the people and playing a progressive role in history.”\n\nThis judgment, so equitable, of the People’s Republic of China, the perfect symbol of the people’s ideals of progress, democracy, independence and anti-imperialism, constitutes for us all, for all the Khmers who are not denatured, the greatest encouragement in their struggle for the advent of social justice, economic development and people’s democracy and for the restoration of complete independence to Cambodia.\n\nIt is with these sentiments that I beg Your Excellency to accept my highest and fraternal consideration.\n\nNorodom Sihanouk Head of State of Cambodia\n\nOctober 11, 1970\n\nLon Nol Clique Should Be Expelled From the U.N.\n\nSource: Peking Review, No. 43, October 26, 1973\n\nON October 17. 1973, the plenary meeting of the U.N. General Assembly adopted by a majority vote a resolution to include in the agenda of the current session the item “Restoration of the Lawful Rights of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia in the United Nations.” This is a victory for the Cambodian people in the struggle to restore their legitimate rights in the United Nations.\n\nThe Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia is the sole legal government of Cambodia and is entitled to its legitimate rights in the United Nations. In March 1970, the Lon No] clique launched a reactionary coup d’etat and illegally usurped Cambodia’s seat in the world organization. Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, in his name as Head of State, called upon the Cambodian people to rise up and take punitive action against the Lon Nol traitorous clique. The Cambodian people, rallying around the Royal Government of National Union and giving full play to patriotism and revolutionary heroism, have for more than three years fought valiantly and stubbornly against the enemy and an excellent situation has emerged from the fighting. The People’s Armed Forces of National Liberation of Cambodia have rapidly grown in strength in the course of the fighting. The Royal Government of National Union now controls more than 90 per cent of the territory of the country and enjoys the warm support of the Cambodian people. In the liberated areas embracing over 80 per cent of the country’s population, administrative organs have been set up at all levels through democratic elections and have been effectively exercising the power of government. All this has been achieved under the leadership of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia.\n\nThe Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia under the leadership of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk consistently follows the policy of independence, peace, neutrality and non-alignment, supports the people’s "
