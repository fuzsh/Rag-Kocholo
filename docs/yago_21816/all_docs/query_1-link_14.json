He was 89.\n\nThe monarch, who abdicated in 1955 and again 49 years later, died due to a heart condition early this morning in Beijing where he underwent medical treatment, Cambodian government spokesman Phay Siphan said by phone. Sihanouk, who maintained houses in the Chinese capital and Pyongyang, suffered from diabetes and prostate cancer."
