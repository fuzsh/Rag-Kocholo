        "text": "On February 24, 2023, President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan met with Cambodian King Norodom Sihamoni and Queen Mother Norodom Monineath Sihanouk at Yangyuan Hall of the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in a warm atmosphere.\n\nXi Jinping expressed his welcome to King Norodom Sihamoni and Queen Mother Norodom Monineath Sihanouk to China for a vacation and physical check. Xi Jinping pointed out that for the past 65 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia, no matter how the international landscape may evolve, the China-Cambodia friendship has grown from strength to strength. China-Cambodia relations have set a fine example of international relations. When drinking water, one should not forget where it comes from. All these should be attributed to the deep friendship forged and nurtured by China's elder-generation leaders and King Father Norodom Sihanouk. As the witnesses of China's reform and opening up, King Norodom Sihamoni and Queen Mother Norodom Monineath Sihanouk always care about China's development, and are good friends of the Chinese people. Queen Mother Norodom Monineath Sihanouk was the awardee of the \"Friendship Medal\" in 2020. That is to thank the Queen Mother for her special contributions to the cause of the China-Cambodia friendship. The two sides should remain committed to the China-Cambodia friendship, carry forward the iron-clad friendship between both countries through generation to generation, and write a new chapter of a China-Cambodia community of a shared future.\n\nXi Jinping emphasized that the Communist Party of China is leading the Chinese people of all ethnic groups in a concerted effort to advance the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization. On the new journey in the new era, China pursues peaceful development and win-win cooperation. China is ready to work with Cambodia to build the \"Diamond Hexagon\" cooperation framework, support Cambodia in establishing an \"Industrial and Technological Corridor\" and a \"Fish and Rice Corridor\", and accelerate the building of a China-Cambodia community with a shared future. China will continue the support for the working group of the Cambodian King in delivering more benefits to the Cambodian people.\n\nKing Norodom Sihamoni and Queen Mother Norodom Monineath Sihanouk thanked President Xi Jinping and Professor Peng Liyuan for providing them with the considerate arrangement and hospitable care during their stay in China. Cambodia is deeply grateful forâChinaâs long-time selfless assistance and support. The Cambodian side has always closely followed China's development and has been heartfelt glad for China's achievements. Cambodia appreciates the Belt and Road Initiative and the philosophy of building a human community with a shared future initiated by President Xi Jinping, and is ready to work with China to take the opportunity of the 65th anniversary of the establishment of Cambodia-China diplomatic relations to deepen friendly exchanges and cooperation in various fields and carry forward the Cambodia-China friendship through generation to generation.\n\nWang Yi was present at the event."
