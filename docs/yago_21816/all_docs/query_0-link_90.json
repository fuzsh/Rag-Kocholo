The small American ‘Maoist Internationalist Movement’ associated with Henry Park, asserted that “Pol Pot is not a Maoist * Pol Pot never called himself a Maoist while Mao was alive” [see: Maoist Internationalist Movement\n\nIn a message from Khieu Samphan, President of Democratic Kampuchea (Cambodia), the importance of smashing the “gang of four” was underlined. “We most warmly acclaim the victory of smashing the counter-revolutionary ’gang of four’ anti-party clique,” said Samphan. “To China and the whole world, and the third world in particular, this is a political event which is a great victory of historical significance.”\n\nReported in The Call, Vol. 5, No. 34, December 27, 1976.\n\nSo RCP,USA made its political observation that :\n\n“The bourgeois press often connects Pol Pot with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that Mao led in China–but in practice, Pol Pot associated himself with forces like Deng Xiaoping who overthrew the Maoist forces and reversed the Cultural Revolution.” Mike Ely, Revolutionary Worker #918, Aug. 10, 1997.\n\nFull article follows ~\n\nAn error appeared in the version of this article that was originally published in RW #918. The article posted here has been corrected.\n\nStraight Talk on the Trial of Pol Pot\n\nby Mike Ely\n\nRevolutionary Worker #918, Aug. 10, 1997\n\nhttp://revcom.us/a/v19/910-19/918/polpot.htm\n\nIn the end of July, ABC News broadcast parts of a videotape showing a trial of Pol Pot in territory controlled by Khmer Rouge forces in western Cambodia.\n\nPol Pot has been the long-time leader of the Khmer Rouge (which means “Red Cambodians”). The Khmer Rouge armed forces seized power in Cambodia in 1975 after many years of guerrilla warfare. They led the country for three years. Then they were driven out of power and back into the countryside by a 1979 Vietnamese invasion.\n\nWith news that Pol Pot had been arrested and put on trial, the U.S. media reissued their familiar charges about “killing fields” during the years 1975-79 when Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge controlled Cambodia. They insisted that Pol Pot be handed over to an international tribunal to be tried for genocide.\n\nNowhere is it mentioned that for years the U.S. bombed and invaded Cambodia in an attempt to defeat the anti-imperialist forces, totally wreck the country’s economy and punish the people of Cambodia. Given this bloody history, the U.S. imperialists have no right to speak on what is good for Cambodia–and no right to judge those who fought them.\n\nIn the hands of the western media, the story of Cambodia has become a crude anti-communist morality tale. New York Times reporter Elizabeth Becker appeared on TV again recently as an official “expert” to hammer home the message: Cambodia, she said, shows that attempts to carry out “wonderful-sounding ideals” about equality using “social engineering” produces a disaster for people.\n\nTo make the facts fit this message, official discussion rips the Cambodian events out of any recognizable context. Cambodia is portrayed as a gentle, peasant land destroyed by communist revolution. In fact, any serious approach to the events in Cambodia has to start with the imperialist invasion of Indochina launched by the U.S. in 1965 and the class nature of Cambodian society.\n\nU.S. Destruction and the Challenges of the Year Zero\n\n“Traditional” Cambodia was a brutal feudal society that needed a revolution. About 80 percent of the people were peasants, most of them extremely poor and exploited by a class of government officials based in urban strongholds. Cambodia’s absolute monarchy rested on a military that repeatedly suppressed peasant uprisings. The country was colonized by France in the late 1800s. In one famous incident, 900 workers died constructing a colonial resort at Bokor during nine months of forced corvée labor.\n\nAs the French imperialists were defeated in Indochina, the U.S. moved in to assert influence and control. In Cambodia the U.S. maneuvered for influence through aid and arms to the government of Prince Sihanouk, while backing reactionary armed forces in opposition to Sihanouk.\n\nIn the 1960s the Khmer Rouge, led by Angkar (which means “the Organization” in the Khmer language), launched a just revolutionary armed struggle by establishing rural base areas among the peasants. (Angkar later publicly named itself the Communist Party of Kampuchea–CPK.) Their goals were to overthrow feudalism, develop an independent new economy, and drive any foreign dominating forces out of Cambodia.\n\nAs revolutionary forces made progress in Indochina, U.S. forces invaded in 1965. Within a few years, the U.S. had 500,000 troops in Vietnam.\n\nUnknown to most of the world, the U.S. also launched a “secret war” of massive bombardment of the neighboring countries Cambodia and Laos–targeting the rural base areas of the guerrilla forces. The U.S. expanded its aggression against Cambodia. In 1969 a U.S.-instigated coup overthrew Sihanouk and brought the right-wing general Lon Nol to power. Then, in 1970, President Nixon ordered a land invasion of eastern Cambodia to attack Vietnamese liberation forces based there. It was a defeat for the U.S.–their armies had to withdraw. And the Khmer Rouge made major advances.\n\nThe U.S. responded with one of the most intense and protracted air wars in history. They dropped over 500,000 tons of bombs on Cambodia between 1970 and 1973–three times what the U.S. dropped on Japan during World War 2. In 160 days of “carpet bombings” in 1973, U.S. planes dropped over 240,000 tons, concentrated on the main farming areas along the Mekong River.\n\nThis was the real genocidal episode in Cambodia and it marked everything that followed.\n\nIn April 1975, when the Khmer Rouge troops took the capital Phnom Penh, Angkar and the masses of people faced extremely difficult conditions. Unable to win the war, the U.S. had set out to wreck and punish the country. Agriculture was in ruins. At least 500,000 people had died during the war–many because of the U.S. bombing. About two million people–a third of the country’s population–had fled the countryside into Phnom Penh, where they faced starvation.\n\nAt the beginning of what Angkar called “Year Zero,” the challenges were huge: a new state system, agriculture, and industry had to be rebuilt, virtually from scratch, in one of the poorest countries of the world–under constant threat of new invasion.\n\nIn May 1975, U.S. President Gerald Ford staged the so-called Mayaguez incident, launched new air raids and destroyed Cambodia’s only oil refinery.\n\nUnder these conditions, any government leading Cambodia would have had to take emergency measures to ensure survival for the masses of people. In the process, the Khmer Rouge attempted to replace the old semifeudal, semicolonial society with their vision of a new independent Democratic Kampuchea.\n\nAny serious analysis of the Khmer Rouge has to start with understanding these conditions–which is precisely what the standard tales about “Khmer Rouge genocide” try to hide.\n\nDishonest Distortions\n\nThe western press repeats a standard formula: “at least a million people died under Pol Pot.” When people hear this, they are supposed to believe that one million people were killed by Pol Pot.\n\nIn fact, these numbers include everyone who died from starvation, disease and political execution in the 1975-79 period between wars–and assigns blame for each of those deaths to the new government of the Khmer Rouge-led Democratic Kampuchea.\n\nNoam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman devote a useful chapter in their book After the Cataclysm: Postwar Indochina & the Reconstruction of Imperial Ideology to documenting how the official myth of “Khmer Rouge genocide” was systematically created using false information and distortions.\n\nIn Cambodia, after 10 years of war, revolution, invasion, bombardment, famine and dislocation, the country was dotted with mass graves. Many people, certainly hundreds of thousands, died during the years that the Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia. Their skulls and bones are offered as proof of “Khmer Rouge atrocities.” In fact, the overwhelming majority of those who died during the 1970s died of war, bombardment, starvation and disease.\n\nMichael Vickery, in his book Cambodia 1975-82, shows why no one knows how many Cambodians died during the wars and upheavals of the 1970s. There were no reliable population figures before the fighting. Noam Chomsky and Edward Herman (The Nation, June 25, 1977) point out that John Barron and Anthony Paul, who wrote the first widely publicized book accusing the Khmer Rouge of genocide, estimated that only about 10 percent of those who died in that hard first year of 1976 were from political executions. Vickery’s account covering the larger period from 1975-79 suggests a higher range estimate for the number who died from execution, but he emphasizes the lack of precision inherent in all the data and estimates concerning this period.\n\nA former U.S. Foreign Service officer in Phnom Penh, David Chandler, reported that the U.S. government itself estimated that a million Cambodians were going to die of starvation in the years after the U.S. bombardment. Then–when hundreds of thousands did die of starvation–the U.S. media machine claims all this was “auto-genocide” by those who opposed the U.S. aggression.\n\nAny serious international tribunal on genocide in Cambodia would have to indict the U.S. war-makers Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger, General Westmoreland, Defense Secretary Melvin Laird, Gerald Ford and all the rest.\n\nA Standard for a Serious Analysis\n\nThe defenders of capitalist/imperialist society examine the experience of Cambodia from their perspective–from the perspective of defending and justifying capitalist society. In these accounts, the disruption of the old society is itself considered a crime. The fact that the upper class elite had to do manual labor under the Khmer Rouge, or that young people and women should be encouraged to break from the traditional family control, or that officials of the old society were deposed and often punished–these things are portrayed as atrocities.\n\nClearly, analyses that start from that bourgeois class stand cannot serve our struggle for liberation. For oppressed people, a serious analysis has to approach these experiences from a completely different point of view, using a completely different standard–seeking to make radical ruptures in traditional ideas and traditional property relations.\n\nIn a discussion of Cambodia, Chairman Avakian asked (Revolution/Fall 1990): “How do you break with these very oppressive and exploitative relations and traditions, customs, and cultures in a way that… fundamentally relies on the masses and acts on the understanding that they are the ones that have to carry out these social transformations. Not that this will just happen spontaneously–it requires that the masses have the leadership of a vanguard party, but a vanguard party that precisely relies fundamentally on the masses to carry this out and doesn’t try to impose it from the top down.”\n\nEvaluating the experience of the Khmer Rouge is a very complex and difficult problem. Reliable information and analysis is hard to come by and fragmentary. But some initial investigation points to several important questions that would have to be looked at in the course of any serious evaluation of the experience of Cambodia and the approach of the Communist Party of Kampuchea.\n\nThe Relocation of People\n\nand the Reconstruction of Agriculture\n\nThe bourgeois press often accuses the Khmer Rouge of atrocities because they immediately evacuated Phnom Penh after taking it in April 1975. This evacuation is portrayed as an irrational and cruel “death march.”\n\nIn fact, the Khmer Rouge had real reasons to fear that the U.S. might launch bombing raids to attack Phnom Penh and the people there. The U.S. had done this during the 1968 Tet offensive when Vietnamese fighters seized parts of Hue and Cholon.\n\nIn addition, the huge refugee encampments around Phnom Penh had only days worth of food stocks. Eight thousand people there had already starved to death in the month before liberation. Hospitals were terribly overcrowded, and over half the country’s doctors had left for exile. This objective situation has to be taken into account in evaluating the decision to evacuate Phnom Penh.\n\nAt the same time, the lines and policies that were then carried out need to be evaluated. The new government of Democratic Kampuchea (DK) put the whole country on an emergency footing–and moved the relocated people into peasant villages or uninhabited forest areas to plant rice, create new irrigation systems, restore agriculture, and rebuild roads. Vickery estimates that after overthrowing Lon Nol, the Khmer Rouge quickly relocated over 2.5 million people to the countryside.\n\nThis was undoubtedly a wrenching process. In many areas people had to scratch for roots and edible plants until the first crops could be harvested. There were often few tools, and many of the relocated people knew little about how to farm the new areas. There were many deaths from starvation and disease.\n\nBut it was also wrenching in a political sense–strangers were moved in large numbers into isolated and insulated villages, resources were strained–and there were inevitably sharp conflicts over who would rule, who would control the land, and how food, tools and seed grain would be distributed.\n\nVickery reports a new political arrangement was envisioned where the population was divided into three categories: Full rights, Candidate, and Depositee. “The Full rights people were poor peasants, the lower middle strata of the middle peasants, and workers. Candidates were upper middle peasants, wealthy peasants and petty bourgeoisie; while the Depositees were capitalist and foreign minorities.” People with links to Lon Nol’s officers and police were reportedly made Depositees.\n\nVickery writes that these divisions often were applied, in practice, so that the “really operative division was between `new’ people (evacuees) and `old’ or `base’ people…who had lived in the revolutionary areas since before April 1975. This division is all the more meaningful in that even peasants from non-revolutionary areas were classed as Depositees, and in some cases there was a distinction between base area Depositees (former capitalists or non-Khmer) and `new’ Depositees from the city.” Some sources report that peasant refugees who had fled to the cities were sometimes accused of having “defected” to the Lon Nol side and were therefore treated as politically suspect. These reports require more investigation.\n\nIt would be important to understand better the line and policies of the Khmer Rouge in constructing the new revolutionary power. Were they constructing a revolutionary dictatorship of workers and peasants, and what classes did they see as allies? What were their policies on “land to the tiller” and on land collectivization? Did they envision a united front led by the proletariat?\n\nVickery and other sources point out that the line and policies that guided reconstruction varied tremendously from region to region, and even between neighboring towns. It would also be important to understand better the causes for the differences in line.\n\nIn many cases, these new arrangements had to be set up almost overnight–with little or no participation of trained political cadre. How much of the practical policies flowed from the spontaneous actions and outlooks of the “base” peasants? Cambodian villagers had long-standing hostilities toward towns and townspeople. Some may have resisted uniting with large numbers of strangers entering their villages.\n\nTo what degree did organizational and political weaknesses in the Angkar contribute to incorrect and uneven policies? Vickery and other sources report that the centralized connections between Khmer Rouge of various regions were extremely loose–and that widely different polices were carried out in the country’s seven main Khmer Rouge regions. This suggests that lack of strong party organization may have been a serious problem in this movement.\n\nTo understand what happened in Cambodia it would be important to evaluate the line associated with Pol Pot that eventually emerged out of intense internal struggles within the Angkar/CPK after the seizure of power. As a unified command was consolidated, the Angkar/CPK attempted to quickly abolish all money, wages systems, marketplaces, religion, and private ownership of land and productive forces.\n\nThese policies are often called “ultra-Maoist” in the western press. But in reality, they are quite different from the policies of New Democratic Revolution carried out by Mao in the liberation of China. And Mao developed a whole theory which saw the socialist transition to communism as a protracted and wave-like process of struggling to overcome class society through relying on the masses of people.\n\nVickery suggests that the implementation of these new consolidated policies coincided with a change in the use of political execution. Before 1977, he writes, extreme punishment was mainly used against officers and officials associated with the crimes of the old regime. After 1977, he believes the numbers of executions rose and involved more punishment of both “new” people and “base” people who ran afoul of the new campaigns and the new authorities. Again, more investigation would be needed to evaluate the truth of such reports, and to understand the extent to which incorrect methods were used to enforce the policies of the new power.\n\nThe Problem of Nationalism\n\nIt is clear that Khmer Rouge politics were heavily colored by an intense Khmer nationalism. There were apparently attempts to forcibly suppress the language, religion and culture of minority nationalities–such as the Moslem Cham people. Vietnamese people living in Cambodia were reportedly treated very harshly. Vickery’s report that national minorities as a whole were categorized as “depositees” suggests that such policies were not just local errors.\n\nSuch narrow nationalism may also have played a role in the alliance between the Khmer Rouge and capitalist roaders in China. The Khmer Rouge movement had developed close ties to Maoist China during their years of guerrilla warfare. But in September 1976, a year after the CPK came to power, Mao Tsetung died and his close allies were arrested in a counterrevolutionary coup. Pol Pot traveled to China in September 1977 in his first public appearance and, on behalf of the DK government and the CPK, embraced the new reactionary leaders of China.\n\nThe bourgeois press often connects Pol Pot with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that Mao led in China–but in practice, Pol Pot associated himself with forces like Deng Xiaoping who overthrew the Maoist forces and reversed the Cultural Revolution.\n\n*****\n\nPol Pot and the Khmer Rouge movement only held overall power in Cambodia for three short years. The internal struggles between Pol Pot and the CPK forces of Cambodia’s eastern region erupted into open military fighting–which Vietnam used as a pretext to invade Cambodia and set up a new government allied to them. The Khmer Rouge was driven back into rural base areas in western Cambodia–where they still exist as an armed force. At the time, a section of the population clearly fought to defend the Democratic Kampuchean government–and for years a sizable section of the population supported Pol Pot for his incorruptible reputation, his identification with the peasants and his relentless fight against foreign domination.\n\nAny revolutionary critique of Pol Pot requires much deeper investigation into the events and policies of this complex experience. But meanwhile, Pol Pot’s recent trial in the jungle appears to be an attempt by forces within the Khmer Rouge to make themselves acceptable to factions within the Cambodian government and to the world’s imperialist powers.\n\nPol Pot kicked the U.S. imperialists out of Cambodia. And that’s why they hate him. By vilifying Pol Pot, the U.S. is pressing ahead with their attempts to slam the door on all dreams of social change–to declare that communist revolution and even national independence for oppressed countries must be rejected and denounced. They cannot be allowed to get away with this.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nThis analysis was further elaborated upon in the unofficial journal of the self-declared embryonic centre of world maoism, the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement.\n\nCondescending Saviours: What Went Wrong with the Pol Pot Regime\n\nA World To Win No.25 (1999)\n\nF.G. argues that the original assertion that the CPK was Maoist came from the Soviets (Vladimir Simonov, Kampuchea: Crimes of Maoists and Their Route [Novosti, 1979]). Their motive, of course, was to tar Maoism and Mao’s China by association. The USSR refused to break relations with the US-installed Lon Nol regime. Amongst the criticism of the CPK political line and actions was the observation that, “Because the CPK could not apply the mass line to lead the people, because what it was trying to lead the people to do was, in fact, against their interests, it is not hard to see why they fell into imposing dictatorship over the people.”\n\nhttp://www.bannedthought.net/International/RIM/AWTW/1999-25/PolPot_eng25.htm\n\nAn earlier American critic of China argued that Pol Pot Was Not and Is Not A Communist. Challenge-Desafio, PL Magazine Supplement, February 19th 1986 1986_PLP on\n\nIn contrast, Cathy Cartright of the League of Revolutionary Struggle, commenting on a new Vietnamese offensive on the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea forces in 1986, addressed the reasons for the conflict and continuing concerns about Pol Pot regime:\n\nKampuchea: Viet Nam launches major attack\n\nFirst Published: Unity, Vol. 8, No. 1, January 25-February 7, 1985.\n\nEncyclopedia of Anti-Revisionism On-Line\n\nSix years after Viet Nam invaded Kampuchea (Cambodia), Vietnamese forces have launched a new offensive against the military and civilian bases of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK). The attacks this year were especially ferocious with Vietnamese forces using Soviet-made T-54 tanks, armored personnel carriers and heavy artillery against Kampuchean forces armed only with light weapons.\n\nWhile thousands of Kampucheans have been killed and an estimated 225,000 civilians have been forced to flee to refugee camps near Thailand, the CGDK reports that its forces are engaging the Vietnamese occupying army in fierce battles not only in the border area, but also in the heart of Kampuchea along routes 5 and 6.\n\nAlthough Vietnamese forces have launched offensive after offensive, they are unable to decisively defeat the Kampuchean resistance. It is likely that the conflict in that country will continue for some time.\n\nThe Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea has raised many questions: Why did Viet Nam invade Kampuchea? Were millions killed by Pol Pot? If so, was that the reason Viet Nam invaded Kampuchea? When is an invasion justified? What is China doing in all this? And what are the roles and interests of the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. there? And finally, is there a solution to the conflict consistent with the interests of the Kampuchean people, international justice and world peace?\n\nViet Nam’s stated reasons for its invasion\n\nViet Nam has given different rationales for its invasion at different times. At the time of its invasion in 1978, Viet Nam stated that, “Kampuchea has repeatedly committed systematic violations of the territorial integrity of Viet Nam. . . . In face of this serious situation, our armed forces have been compelled to take self-defense actions with the firm resolve to defend our sovereignty and territory. …”\n\nLater, Viet Nam denied it had invaded at all and asserted instead that they had merely gone to the aid of one side of an internal Kampuchean conflict. Still later Viet Nam cited the hostility of China and the U.S. to Viet Nam as the reason for the invasion of Kampuchea.\n\nAt no time did the Vietnamese ever cite the need to free the Kampuchean people from the rule of Pol Pot as a reason for their invasion. This indicates greater understanding of international law on Viet Nam’s part than various of its more zealous defenders in the U.S.\n\nHowever, the Vietnamese did make use of widespread Western abhorence of Pol Pot’s excesses to lessen public repugnance towards the invasion. We will turn to the question of Pol Pot’s policies after addressing the reasons Viet Nam gave for its invasion.\n\nViet Nam acted in self-defense?\n\nIt is hardly believable that Kampuchea, a country of seven million people, could pose a threat to Viet Nam, with its 53 million people, and an army a million strong. After defeating the U.S., the Vietnamese government claimed to be the “third strongest military power in the world.” The Vietnamese had captured sophisticated U.S. equipment and had received equipment for years from the Soviet Union and China.\n\nFurthermore, despite longstanding border conflicts between the two countries, there was no evidence of a Kampuchean invasion of Viet Nam at any time. Clearly, this argument was just a pretext, the oldest pretext in the world for an invasion.\n\nThat Viet Nam was merely backing an indigenous Kampuchean force, the Kampuchean National United Front for the Salvation of Kampuchea (KNUFSK), also lacks credibility. The KNUFSK was not even in existence until announced in Hanoi three weeks before the invasion.\n\nIf the overthrow of Pol Pot was the work of indigenous Kampuchean forces, it is hard to see why 200,000 Vietnamese soldiers are still needed in Kampuchea, and why they, rather than KNUFSK forces, must bear the brunt of the fighting against the CGDK forces.\n\nPerhaps the invasion was not justified, but is the life of the Kampuchean people under Vietnamese occupation better today? The Guardian, which supports the Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea, reported May 30, 1984, that Kampuchea, once known as a rich agricultural land, today cannot produce enough rice to feed itself. This confirmed a report by the Christian Science Monitor that Kampuchea was witnessing the biggest shortage of rice since the near starvation of 1979.\n\nFurthermore, Viet Nam has pursued a policy of settler colonization in Kampuchea, with an estimated 500,000 Vietnamese moving into Kampuchea. One Kampuchean described the situation: “The liberators are becoming the colonizers. There are thousands of Vietnamese there now, everywhere. They have been settled in every district of Phnom Penh. They have much greater civil rights than us.” (The Quality of Mercy, William Shawcross)\n\nThreats to Viet Nam from China and U.S.\n\nThe Vietnamese have argued that Kampuchea attacked Viet Nam as a result of Chinese and U.S. instigation. According to this line of reasoning both China and the U.S. sought to attack Viet Nam by instigating war between Viet Nam and Kampuchea. This action, according to Viet Nam, is a continuation of efforts by both countries to dominate Asia.\n\nThis argument is also rather difficult to maintain. It does not take a military expert to know that Viet Nam has a formidable army which another force would have to think of carefully before engaging in battle. The Kampuchean army under Pol Pot was hardly a match for the Vietnamese army.\n\nThere is no evidence that the United States supported Pol Pot prior to the Vietnamese invasion. The U.S. did not even have diplomatic relations with Kampuchea at the time. It has been only since the Vietnamese invasion that the U.S. has given $7.5 million per year to Thailand for Kampuchean refugee work, some of which may be channeled to CGDK forces.\n\nThe claim that China was instigating Kampuchea to attack Viet Nam is also ridiculous given the fact that all knowledgeable observers agree that Kampuchea did not attack Viet Nam. The argument of the need, because of China’s hostility, to strengthen Viet Nam by attacking and absorbing Kampuchea is likewise not plausible.\n\nIn any case the idea that China is intent on dominating Asia is without merit and does not conform to historical facts. During the Korean War against aggression, China sent over 500,000 volunteers to fight alongside the Korean people. At the end of that war all 500,000 returned to China and China did not seek to dominate Korea or acquire an inch of Korean soil.\n\nMore recently, during Viet Nam’s war against U.S. aggression, China sent over 320,000 support personnel and $20 billion in aid to help the Vietnamese people. When the war ended, China’s personnel withdrew. They did not seek to seize Vietnamese territory. If China sought to dominate Asia, it would surely not have withdrawn so readily.\n\nIn various border skirmishes with Viet Nam, China has acted with restraint. China does not have any troops stationed on Vietnamese soil. When China made a limited strike ten miles into Viet Nam in 1979 to protest Viet Nam’s armed intrusions on Chinese territory and the Kampuchean invasion, China withdrew within 16 days as promised. Today, Viet Nam has over 500,000 troops on its border with China. China has only an estimated 120,000-250,000 troops, hardly enough to threaten Viet Nam.\n\nReal reason for Viet Nam’s invasion\n\nViet Nam is the largest of the three countries of Indochina. Viet Nam’s population of 53 million compares to seven million in Kampuchea and three million in Laos. If Viet Nam can dominate Laos and Kampuchea, it would control one of the richest areas in the world astride strategic Western sea lanes. By dominating Indochina, Viet Nam would be a major regional power.\n\nThis is the reason for Viet Nam’s invasion of Kampuchea and explains the fact that Viet Nam maintains 50,000 troops in Laos as well.\n\nIn 1967, the Hanoi government, the National Liberation Front of South Viet Nam and Kampuchea (then Cambodia) under Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, signed a written agreement stating that Viet Nam would respect Kampuchea’s borders, including offshore islands.\n\nTwo months after Viet Nam and Kampuchea defeated the U.S. in 1975, Viet Nam seized Kampuchea’s Wai Islands, but was militarily forced to withdraw. Immediately after the 1978 invasion, however, Viet Nam again annexed the Wai Islands, this time with the acquiescence of the Heng Samrin group, the Vietnamese-installed regime in Phnom Penh.\n\nViet Nam, Kampuchea and Laos, because of geography and a common history of struggle against colonialism and imperialism, have a basis for cooperation. Cooperation, however, does not mean that the smaller countries should be forced to give up their independence and sovereignty to the larger country. European countries cooperate in the European Common Market, but this does not affect the independence of each member nation.\n\nViet Nam has been backed by the Soviet Union. It is not difficult to see why. In ; return for political support and $1 billion a year in Soviet aid, Viet Nam has given the U.S.S.R. use of the former U.S. air base at Da Nang and former U.S. naval base at Cam Ranh Bay. This gives the Soviet j Union important bases astride strategic shipping lanes. The occupation of Kampuchea also serves the Soviet Union as an additional threat to China from the south.\n\nHowever difficult it is for us to believe that Viet Nam, a country whose struggles once inspired us all, has become an aggressor, facts are facts, however unpleasant. Just as we opposed aggression against Viet Nam in the past, today we must stand up against its aggression.\n\nWhat about Pol Pot?\n\nAlthough Viet Nam did not invade Kampuchea because of Pol Pot’s policies, the widespread abhorence for Pol Pot has been used by Viet Nam’s apologists to justify Viet Nam’s invasion. Therefore, it is necessary to answer the question of what did happen under Pol Pot, and if even a fraction of the horror stories were true, would an invasion have been justified?\n\nIn the West we have read stories of mass murder and genocide in Kampuchea. The movie The Killing Fields paints a picture of Kampuchea under Pol Pot too terrible to imagine. All observers agree that whoever took power in Kampuchea after the U.S. retreat would have been faced with mass starvation and great suffering, but the Western anti-communist press have charged that two to three million people were killed under Pol Pot. These charges are echoed by Viet Nam as well.\n\nMost of the more rational Western reporters, including the pro-Vietnamese author Michael Vickery, agree that it’s impossible that two to three million people were killed. There were roughly seven million people in Kampuchea in 1975 and roughly the same number today. Taking into account births and natural deaths, two to three million people could not have died between 1975 and 1978.\n\nClearly, grave errors were committed under Pol Pot. These included evacuating the major cities, eliminating money and schools above the primary level, and torturing and killing people suspected of being “class enemies.” Perhaps hundreds of thousands of people died because of these policies. These policies have nothing to do with Marxism-Leninism or the kind of socialism that Marxist-Leninists are striving to build in the U.S.\n\nThere were indications in 1978 that the Kampuchean government was beginning to correct some of its errors. It had decided to reinstate higher education, recirculate money and the cities were again growing. Since 1979 Pol Pot and others made self-criticisms for errors. Whether Po; Pot would ever again be acceptable as a leader to the Kampuchean people is an issue that is up to the Kampuchean people to decide.\n\nCertainly the Pol Pot government made immense errors. But did these errors justify an invasion by foreign troops?\n\nCertainly Viet Nam did not invade Kampuchea out of concern for human rights. Its own record in that regard also leaves thing to be desired.\n\nWhen is an invasion justified?\n\nEven though Viet Nam has never made the argument that it invaded Kampuchea in order to correct abuses under Pol Pot, no justification by third parties, or attempts by Viet Nam to mitigate the invasion on these grounds, are valid. Because if concern for human rights was Viet Nam’s reason for invading Kampuchea, why were no other steps taken to deal with this situation? No efforts at economic boycotts, political and moral sanctions, international condemnation and isolation, etc. were undertaken.\n\nWhat would happen if it were acceptable for nations to invade other nations on the pretext that human rights were being violated? There are dozens of countries which either the Soviet Union or the U.S. could easily invade on those grounds. For the U.S. these would include the Soviet itself, certainly Iran, Libya and quite a few of the Eastern European countries. With such invasions the loss of human life could be staggering.\n\nThere would be no international law and international relations would be reduced to a jungle if invasions of other countries were taken so lightly, unilaterally and with total disregard for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of nations.\n\nSome U.S. leftists claim that in some cases, revolution can only be advanced at the point of a Soviet bayonet. This is both chauvinist toward the liberation struggles and also utterly reckless in terms of world peace. Not even Viet Nam or the Soviet Union have tried to put forward such arguments.\n\nIs there a solution?\n\nIs there a way out for the Kampuchean people who have suffered so much? No side in the Kampuchean conflict is likely to do away with the other in the near future. Viet Nam is a formidable enemy with a battle-hardened army.\n\nThe Kampuchean resistance is growing in strength On June 22, 1982, three groups united to form the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK). They were Democratic Kampuchea, represented by Khieu Samphan; he Khmer People’s National Liberation Front, headed by Son Sann; and the United National Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia headed by Samdech Norodom Sihanouk. Sihanouk became president.\n\nThe three Kampuchean groups command over 50,000 guerrillas holding upwards of 30 bases. An estimated one to two million Kampucheans live in zones I under guerrilla control. Political and ideological differences exist among the three groups. Each is allowed to maintain its own organization and receive foreign aid. But the formation of CGDK strengthened the Kampuchean resistance politically and militarily.\n\nThe only just solution is that of the UN International Conference on Kampuchea, which is supported by the CGDK. The UN plan calls for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Kampuchea and the holding of UN-supervised elections. In 1984, 110 countries supported such a resolution, including non-aligned and socialist countries such as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Romania, Burma, Bangladesh and Yugoslavia.\n\nFor progressives in the U.S., we need to sort out the issues and proceed from the standpoint of peace, justice and concern for the fate of the Kampuchean people. We should fully support the demands for immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops and the holding of elections under UN supervision to allow the Kampuchean people to determine their own future, free from war, aggression and foreign domination.\n\nIn Support of Vietnam\n\nSplendid Victory 1979 LINK\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, Socialist Republic of Vietnam\n\nOfficial Friendship Visit of the Government delegation of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam to the People’s Republic of Kampuchea March 1979 1979_srv FRIENDSHIP VISIT\n\nEvgenii Vasilevich Kobelev (1979) Kampuchea: from Tragedy to Rebirth.

In January 1979, the government was overthrown by the army of Vietnam acting in support of former DK functionaries. In August of that year a special court, the People’s Revolutionary Tribunal, was constituted to try two of the leaders of Democratic Kampuchea, Pol Pot and Ieng Sary. The charge against them was genocide as it was defined in the United Nation’s genocide convention of 1948. At the time, both men were in the Cambodian jungle leading the National Government of Democratic Kampuchea forces against the Vietnamese and their Cambodian allies; they were, therefore, tried in absentia. It took a week for the newly installed Cambodia government to find them guilty.\n\nRead More\n\nKampuchea Dossier III: the Dark years.\n\nHanoi: Vietnam Courier.1979\n\nArticles on, and documents from the People’s Revolutionary Tribunal in Phnom Penh.\n\nBritain Vietnam Association.

We can thus see that to repress our people and to carry out aggression against, occupy, destroy and colonize our country, the enemy has employed more than 130,000 men. These troops have received from the Washington government ultramodern military equipment, arms and engines of war.\n\nIn order to crush our people and destroy our country, they have dispatched vast ground, air and naval forces against them.\n\nDespite all this, our people’s army, backed by the troops, provincial guards and police of the royal forces, which have gone to the jungles, has successfully inflicted daily defeats upon the enemy.\n\n* * *\n\nBefore the massive invasion of our national territory by the Americans, the armed forces of our N.U.F.K. had already won very brilliant victories over the wretched mercenaries of the traitors Lon Nol-Sirik Matak in Koh Thorn, Saang, Koki, Chipou, Prasaut. Krek, Memot, Snoul, Angtassom, Takeo, Kep, Kamchay Mea, Chhlong, etc. … and our people’s administration had been established In many provinces and districts, particularly In Svay Rleng, Prey Veng, Kandal, Kom-pong Chhnang, Kompong Speu, Takeo, Kampot, Mon-dolkirl, Ratanakirl, Kratle and Stung Treng.\n\nOur people’s army had already surrounded Phnom Penh and was on the point of taking the capital by assault.\n\nIn view of this, U.S. President Nixon, in order to save “the skin” of the regime of his vile lackeys Lon Nol-Sirik Matak, formally ordered his supreme command to dispatch without delay the Yankee troops, the south Vietnamese mercenaries and the “Khmer Serei” mercenaries (so-called Free Khmers) against our people.\n\nAt present, the Americans and their Saigon mercenaries are reducing to ashes our villages, districts and cities, particularly those in the provinces of Svay Rieng, Kompong Cham, Kratie. Prey Veng, Kandal, Ratana-kiri and Mondolkiri. There, they raze everything to the ground: houses, compartments, fields, markets, etc. . . . There, they rob (he inhabitants of their property. There, they mercilessly slaughter the common people, old people, women and children.\n\nThe only “crime” committed by these poor victims was their loyalty to the nation, to the throne and to their “Samdech Papa,” their love for national independence, democracy and neutrality, and their refusal to serve the interests of big capitalist reactionaries and the interests of the U.S. imperialists.\n\nThe people of the world have expressed their reprobation and repulsion of these horrible acts of the American invaders and occupationists. Even the students of all the universities in the United States have vehemently protested against Nixon.\n\nOnly the Lon Nol-Sirik Malak gang has the impudence to express its joy at and great admiration of its U.S. master and its evils and crimes.\n\nThe Americans and their south Vietnamese mercenaries have come to our country to occupy our land, oppress our nation, reduce to ashes our cities, villages, districts and provinces, and establish their dictatorial rule in our country, turning Cambodia into their colony. This fact has been presented to the world by the traitors to the Khmer motherland as an American intervention to “save” Cambodia and “preserve” its independence, freedom, neutrality and territorial integrity (sic)!\n\nThis is an abominable treason that our people and the history of our Kampuchea will never pardon.\n\nOn May 5, an AFP dispatch by Bernard Ulimann told the world that “the Cambodian premier, General Lon Not today expressed gratitude to President Nixon for helping him defend Cambodia’s neutrality.”\n\nThat’s the limit! At a lime when many U.S. Congressmen do not hesitate publicly to hold Nixon responsible for destroying the Independence, neutrality and peace of Cambodia with the sole purpose of saving a handful of traitors from certain defeat in ihe face of the Khmer people’s army, Lon Nol is unashamed to affirm that the intervention of its American masters is an act to “save” the neutrality of Cambodia!\n\nThe subordinates of Lon Nol are fellows without dignity and without shame like him.\n\nAccording to an AP dispatch from Tokyo on May 7, “Cambodian premier Lon Nol’s special envoy, Sim Var, said the Cambodian people support (sic) the U.S. intervention as a step to defend this country’s neutrality (sic). Sim made the statement at a meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Kiichi Aichi Wednesday evening. He asked for Japanese economic aid. . . .”\n\nThat is also the limit!\n\nAccording to a UPI dispatch of May 8, “Cambodian ambassador Khimtit has informed U.N. Secretariat. . the Cambodian government. . . referring to Nixon’s April 30 message announcing the advance of U.S. forces. . . within Cambodia. . . notes with satisfaction that the President of the U.S.A. took into account in his decision the legitimate aspirations of the Cambodian people (sic). . . expressed its gratitude to President Nixon for this assistance in defending (sic) Cambodia’s neutrality.”\n\nThis despicable message to the United Nations is also a “summit” of treason to and slander against the Cambodian people.\n\nAmerican imperialism sends its troops to destroy independent and neutral Cambodia. The Lon Nol gang passes this “strangulation” of Khmer independence and neutrality off as an act “conforming to the legitimate aspirations of the Khmer people”!\n\nThe local press in Lon Nol’s pay has aroused, for its part, the aversion and scorn of the Khmer people and of world opinion by its dithyrambic articles lauding without rhyme or reason the (American) “great patron.”\n\nAccording to an AFP dispatch by Bernard Ulimann on May 7, Le Courrier Phnompenhois showers fulsome flattery on its master Nixon in the following manner: “We are assured of the support of a big nation thanks to the clear-sightedness of its president . . this president’s courageous decision will put him on an equal rank with other great presidents like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, the paper added.”\n\nSuch base and incongruous flattery like this has aroused the repulsion of all Khmer patriots and of world opinion.\n\nWorld opinion scorns the Lon Nol gang all the more because Nixon is entirely contrary to what Washington and Lincoln had been.\n\nNixon has never been a hero of the independence or emancipation of the peoples; on the contrary, he has to his credit the aggression against a number of countries and peoples and the suppression of their independence and democracy, for example: south Viet Nam, Laos and Cambodia which have lost everything, peace, freedom, independence, unity and territorial integrity.\n\nTherefore, today the gang of Lon Nol-Sirik Matak-Sim Var-Cheng Heng-Trinh Hoanh-Khimtit and company has completely unmasked itself before our Buddhist monk- and our people who have recognized their true nature as traitors of the most despicable kind and who have recognized that both their policy and deeds are the very opposite of their propaganda, just as black is the opposite of white.\n\nThat is why today our citizens of both sexes and of all sections, especially our peasants, workers and other working people, those soldiers, provincial guards and policemen who are not traitors, our youth and intellectuals, our living forces are giving our people’s National Liberation Army massive support\n\nAlthough the enemy possesses enormous military means, our Liberation Army has been winning victories, for example: the capture of the cities of Kratie, Sen Monorom, Stung Treng, Chhouk, etc. . . ; the encirclement and isolation of the cities of Prey Veng, Takeo, Kampot, etc. . .; the cutting off of the communication, telegraphic and telephone lines between more than 20 urban centres and Phnom Penh. Meanwhile in 13 provinces (including Batlambang) a large part of the population has been freed from the control of the Lon Nol administration.\n\nIn view of these very important successes and victories, permit me, heroic fighters, to extend to you in my own name and on behalf of our N.U.F.K., the Royal Government of National Union headed by Samdech Penn Nouth, and the Khmer nation our heartfelt gratitude, our warmest congratulations and our deepest admiration.\n\nI extend in particular the same sentiments to my comrades Khieu Samphan, Minister of National Defence, Hou Yuen, Minister of Interior, and Hu Nim, Minister of Information, and their valiant assistants.\n\nAt the same time I have the honour to convey to all our heroic fighters of the National Liberation Armed Forces the most heartfelt congratulations and admiration from their excellencies the ambassadors and charge d’affaires of the socialist, non-aligned, progressive and anti-imperialist countries.\n\nIn conclusion, 1 most respectfully bow in sorrow in memory of our heroes fallen in battle against the enemies of our people, our nation and our Khmer country; I also respectfully bow in memory of our compatriots murdered by the Lon Nol gang, and of those who fell victim to the U.S. and mercenary forces or their savage air raids.\n\nI call upon the soldiers, provincial guards, policemen and functionaries who are still under the command of Lon Nol to follow the lofty patriotic example set by the great majority of our nation which has already risen like one man to fight unyieldingly and uncompromisingly against the most ferocious enemies of our motherland and our race — the American imperialist neo-colonialists and their flunkeys, these unpardonable renegades, Asians who betray Asia, Indo-Chinese who betray Indo-China, Khmers who betray Kampuchea.\n\nThey should ponder over the facts which I revealed to them at the beginning of this message.\n\nIn addition, they should know that the Lon Nol clique holds them in great contempt: in order to “save the skin” of its regime, this clique does not trust them at all; it prefers to turn to the “Khmer Serei” mercenaries of Son Ngoc Thanh, paid by the American C.I.A. and trained by the notorious “Green Berets.” These mercenaries are now stationed around Phnom Penh.\n\nLon Nol-Sirik Matak have openly begged the United States to dispatch “Free” Khmer troops from Saigon to Phnom Penh; “diplomatic” contacts are being made by these renegades with Bangkok, Saigon, Taipeh and Seoul whose “governments” are known to the world as recognized flunkeys of U.S. imperialism; diplomatic relations are or will soon be established with these flunkeys — all these facts are glaring proof that their coup d’etat of March 18 was essentially aimed at “throwing” Cambodia and the Khmer nation into an abyss of disastrous bellicosity and U.S. enslavement.\n\nThey should see that clearly. All the people in the world have seen that clearly.\n\nThus a great number of European, Asian, Arab, African and Latin American countries have decided to sever all relations with the present regime of Phnom Penh and to establish diplomatic relations with the new Royal Government of National Union Under the Leadership of the N.U.F.K. which they recognize officially and solemnly as the sole, only legal Government of Cambodia and its people.\n\nAnti-imperialist countries which had embassies in Phnom Penh have decided to close these embassies and have ordered their personnel as well as all their experts and technicians to leave the city where a despicable clique reigns, a clique which has allowed U.S. imperialism to colonize the Khmer motherland and put her to fire and sword, while congratulating and thanking U.S. imperialism for it.\n\nIn the future only the countries subservient to or friendly with the United States will maintain or establish their embassies in Phnom Penh in an attempt to consolidate the shaky foundations of the traitorous Lon Nol-Sirik Matak regime.\n\nThey (soldiers, guards, policemen and functionaries) should consequently cast away all illusions from their minds and act as good Khmers who are concerned with the supreme interests of the nation and their own dignity. To act as good Khmers means that they should completely quit the service of the traitors who have sold their own country to the Americans and allowed them to destroy it. If they have not enough courage to go and live in the jungles, they should turn over their arms to the National Liberation Army. After that, they can return to their native cities or villages to live as peaceable citizens.\n\nMany of our young peasants to whom the Lon Nol regime had issued rifles hurried off to the jungles with their rifles. Others who were unwilling to abandon their paddy fields and farmland showed their patriotism by turning over their rifles to the people’s troops in the jungles.\n\nI got this stirring news from dispatches of the U.S. press itself.\n\nThey (the soldiers, guards and policemen) should follow the lofty example of our peasants.\n\n* * *\n\nIf I ask all our compatriots of combat age to accept such sacrifices, it is not for the sake of the interests of Sihanouk, but for the sake of the supreme interests of the motherland which must be liberated at all costs, and also for the sake of people’s own interests, for the sake of building for themselves and their children a new life conforming to the just and legitimate aspirations of the working people, of all our people.\n\nAs far as I am concerned, if I am fighting by your side, that is simply because it is my duty as a Khmer citizen to do so and also because I have a debt to discharge, my gratitude to all those who have always affectionately trusted me.\n\nAs to my future, I desire nothing other than the satisfaction of having my duty accomplished.\n\nWith regard to the managing of the country (education of the people, organization and defence of national territory, administration of the liberated townships, districts, provinces and cities, etc. . .), I have entrusted it entirely to the patriotic persons who are now leading the national resistance in the country, particularly Comrades Khicu Samphan, Hou Yuon and HU Nim.\n\nThus, all of you who participate in the struggle are righting for the motherland, for yourselves and for your families.\n\nI am convinced that with the protection and support of our Buddhist monks, all our compatriots who faithfully love the motherland and refuse to sell it out will rise and unite to fight and drive out of our beloved Kampuchea all the American arch criminal invaders and their no less criminal south Vietnamese lackeys, and to mercilessly overthrow the gang of traitors, sellers and destroyers of the country and the nation, a gang headed by Lon Nol and Sirik Matak. Let these hideous devils go to hell and never return to haunt our people and the motherland.\n\nLong live the people’s National Liberation Army!\n\nLong live the patriotic soldiers, provincial guards and policemen who are fighting shoulder to shoulder with the people’s army against the enemies of the motherland!\n\nDown with U.S. imperialism and its Phnom Penh and Saigon lackeys!\n\nCambodian Head of State Samdech Norodom Sihanouk Meets Le Duan, First Secretary of Central Committee Of Viet Nam Workers’ Party\n\nSource: Peking Review, No. 21， May 22, 1970\n\nSamdech Norodom Sihanouk, Head of Slate of Cambodia and Chairman of the National United Front of Kampuchea, met Le Duan, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Viet Nam Workers’ Party, in Peking on May 12, according to an announcement made by the Office of\n\nSamdech Norodom Sihanouk, Head of Slate of Cambodia and Chairman of the National United Front of Kampuchea.\n\nPresent were Chan You ran, Minister of Popular Education and Youth of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia; Thiounn Mumm, Minister of Economy and Finance of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia; and Ngo Thuyen, Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam to China.\n\nThe meeting proceeded in a cordial and friendly atmosphere.\n\nStatement by Command of Cambodian National Liberation Army\n\nSource: Peking Review, No. 21， May 22, 1970\n\nCalling on the patriotic armed forces and people of Cambodia to advance courageously and defeat the U.S. imperialists and their henchmen; declaring that the Joint Declaration adopted by the Summit Conference of the Indo-Chinese Peoples is the programme of action and immediate combat objective of the Cambodian National Liberation Army and pledging to unite closely with the fraternal armed forces and peoples of Viet Nam and Laos in jointly fighting to defeat the U.S. imperialists’ schemes of aggression.\n\nThe Command of the Cambodian National Liberation Army in the liberated area of Cambodia issued on May 3 a statement on the Summit Conference of the Indo-Chinese Peoples, according to a VNA report quoting the Information Bureau of the National United Front of Kampuchea. The statement reads in full:\n\nIn face of the betrayal by the Lon Nol-Sirik Matak clique and the danger of armed aggression by the U.S. imperialists against Cambodia’s territory, the entire Khmer people have risen up at the same lime to wage a courageous struggle against the acts of aggression of the U.S. imperialists and to overthrow the reactionary clique, their henchmen. It is in this high tide of 6truggle of the Khmer people that the Cambodian National Liberation Army came into being.\n\nThe Cambodian National Liberation Army comprises the sons of the patriotic Khmer people of all strata, victims of oppression and repression by the reactionary Lon Nol-Sirik Matak clique. Every cadre and fighter of the Cambodian National Liberation Army, nurturing profound hatred for the traitors and aggressors, is holding firm his gun to fight beside the entire people till final victory for the liberation of the motherland and the people and for the building of an Independent, democratic, genuinely neutral and prosperous Cambodia.\n\nResponding to the call of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, Head of State of Cambodia, the Cambodian National Liberation Army has, together with the entire people, repeatedly attacked the enemy and liberated hundreds of hamlets and villages, dozens of sub-sectors and district towns together with tens of thousands of people from the grip of the reactionary Lon Nol-Sirik Matak clique, and set up committees of the National United Front of Kampuchea (N.U.F.K.) at various levels in the newly liberated areas.\n\nWhile the offensive of the Khmer people against their enemy was going full steam, a historic event of extreme importance took place: the Summit Conference of the Indo-Chinese Peoples was held and yielded brilliant success.\n\nAll officers and men of the Cambodian National Liberation Army consider the great success of the conference as a great stimulus to the fighting spirit of our armed forces. The Joint Declaration unanimously adopted by the conference will be the programme of action and immediate combat objective of our Cambodian National Liberation Army. Together with the people of all strata at home, we pledge ourselves to unite closely with the fraternal armed forces and peoples of Viet Nam and Laos in fighting resolutely to defeat all schemes of aggression of the U.S. imperialists, overthrow the reactionary regime of the Lon Nol-Sirik Matak clique and build a new, really independent and free Cambodia.\n\nThe U.S. imperialists masterminded the coup d’etat that deposed Head of State Samdech Norodom Sihanouk. It was also they who secretly supplied weapons to the reactionary Lon Nol-Sirik Matak clique to repress our people’s movement for justice, peace, independence, neutrality and genuine democracy. But the reactionaries are isolated at home and in the world and the mighty waves of struggle of the people have inflicted heavy losses on them, dooming them to certain and complete defeat.\n\nTo save his henchmen from their dangerous situation, U.S. President Nixon brazenly announced on April 30 the dispatch of U.S. troops to Cambodia and openly supplied weapons to the reactionary Lon Nol troops to repress the struggle of our compatriots.\n\nAt present, tens of thousands of U.S. and south Viet Nam puppet troops have invaded Cambodia’s territory from south Viet Nam. This is a flagrant act of aggression by the U.S. imperialists against our beloved Cambodian motherland. The Cambodian National Liberation Army and the entire Khmer people vehemently condemn this towering crime of the U.S. imperialists. The U.S. imperialists have been defeated in Viet Nam and Laos, they will certainly sustain ignominious defeat in Cambodia, too, in face of the resolute and vigorous fight of our armed forces and people, the strength of militant solidarity of the Cambodian, Vietnamese and Laotian peoples and the worldwide protest of the peace-loving and progressive peoples.\n\nTo greet the success of the Summit Conference of the Indo-Chinese Peoples in a most practical way and defeat the U.S. imperialists’ new schemes of aggression, the command calls on all officers and men of the National Liberation Army throughout the country to carry out resolutely and courageously the following tasks:\n\n1. Quickly develop our forces in all three categories: militia and guerrilla, regional forces and regular army. We must in the course of fighting build up the strength of our armed forces in order to win more victories and grow up quickly in battle.\n\n2. Attack with determination and at the same time enemy troops of all types — the reactionary troops of Lon Nol, the American aggressor troops, the south Viet Nam puppet troops and the “Khmer Serei,” etc. so as to whittle down and annihilate the enemy effectives, in close co-ordination with the uprising of the people to expand the liberated areas end set up the people’s power.\n\n3. Carry out well political work among the enemy troops by explaining to them our just line, disintegrate them, making them refuse to collaborate with the reactionary Lon Nol-Sirik Matak clique and to serve as henchmen of the United States as already made clear in Head of State Samdech Norodom Sihanouk’s appeal, actively help individuals or units of the enemy troops cross over to the people’s side and fight beside us under the banner of the N.U.F.K. to wipe out the common enemy of the nation,\n\n4. Unite closely with the people of all strata at home and foreign residents, especially Vietnamese and Chinese residents. Strictly observe discipline concerning our relations with the masses and refrain from any encroachment upon the life and property of the people.\n\nRealize the “army-people one-mindedness,” the army being the fish and the people the water, defend the life and property of the people against the repression and exploitation by the Lon Nol-Sirik Matak clique and the U.S. aggressors.\n\nThe command is convinced that under the glorious fighting banner of the motherland, inspired by the success of the Summit Conference of the Indo-Chinese Peoples, with the strength of the militant solidarity of the three peoples of Cambodia, Viet Nam and Laos, with the sympathy and support of the peace-loving and progressive people in the world, our Khmer people and armed forces will certainly attain our immediate fighting objectives. Since the U.S. aggressors and their henchmen are still hatching many perfidious and cruel plots, many difficulties and hardships are still ahead of us, but it is certain that in the end the enemy will be defeated by the peoples and armed forces of Cambodia, Viet Nam and Laos and we will win total victory.\n\nWe wilt certainly win!\n\nThe U.S. aggressors and the clique of traitors will certainly be defeated!\n\nLong live really independent, neutral and democratic Cambodia!\n\nLong live the National United Front of Kampuchea!\n\nAll our officers and men, march forward courageously under the glorious fighting banner of the motherland!\n\nStatement of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, Head of State of Cambodia\n\nSource: Peking Review, No. 21， May 22, 1970\n\n* The United Slates has no right to intervene militarily in Cambodia.\n\n* The Cambodian people will not tolerate the so-called Asian conference engineered by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to interfere in the internal affairs of Cambodia.\n\nThe Private Secretarial of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, Head of State of Cambodia, issued to the press in Peking on April 30 a statement of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, Head of Stale of Cambodia and Chairman of the National United Front of Kampuchea, dated April 30. The text of the statement reads in full as follows:\n\n1. Certain imperialist or pro-imperialist circles have tried to minimize the importance of the resolutions of the recent Summit Conference of the Indo-Chinese Peoples, stressing that in these resolutions there is neither the formation of a “united front of the Indo-Chinese peoples/’ nor the establishment of an organ of “co-operation” nor the expression of the determination to intensify the efforts of struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism.\n\nActually, the united front of the Indo-Chinese peoples exists de facto. Proof of this can be found in the following passages of the Joint Declaration signed on April 25, 1970:\n\n“The conference . . . arrived at a unanimous appraisal … of the struggle of the three Indo-Chinese peoples against the common enemy, the American imperialist aggressors and their lackeys.” . . .\n\n“In the face of this common enemy, the peoples of Indo-China have fought side by side in defence of their sacred national rights.”\n\n. . . “The conference calls on the three peoples to redouble their vigilance, strengthen their solidarity and intensify the struggle against the common enemy — American imperialism and its flunkeys in the three countries — until complete victory.*’\n\n. . . “The different parties undertake to do everything possible to render mutual support in accordance with the desire of the interested party and on the basis of mutual respect.”\n\nIn this respect, an organ of liaison or co-operation is unnecessary because our four parties are in constant touch through diplomatic channels or at frequent meetings at the summit or at lower levels among responsible Khmer, Laotian and Vietnamese officials: “The parties agree,” says the declaration, “that meetings will take place whenever it is necessary between their highest-level leaders or between competent representatives for exchanges of views on problems of common interest.”\n\n. . . “The parties affirm their determination to . . . give mutual support in the struggle against the common enemy and to co-operate in the future and on a long-term basis in the building of each country following the road which it finds appropriate.”\n\nAs to the intensification of the efforts of straggle, it finds expression in the concluding part of the Joint Declaration:\n\n“They (the three peoples) have forged an indestructible solidarity . . . they possess greater strength . . -the three Indo-Chinese peoples on their victorious advance will make full use of their position of having the initiative and being on the offensive and persistently carry on and intensify the struggle in all fields, …”\n\n2. Being aware that the regime of their valets Lon Nol-Sirik Matak is beset with mounting difficulties resulting from its unpopularity, its atrocious and unpardonable crimes and the series of military defeats inflicted upon it by the Khmer People’s Liberation Army, the U.S. imperialists have ordered certain governments of their “allies” and satellites to launch several “schemes” designed lo save the loitering Phnom Penh regime from its inevitable doom.\n\nIt is necessary to mention among these “Schemes\n\n(a) A so-called Asian conference on Cambodia;\n\n(b) Formation of a so-called coalition government in Phnom Penh;\n\n(c) Internationalization of the civil war in Cambodia which has become “a foreign invasion’ in the mouths of President Nixon and his lackeys. Adam Malik, Thanat Khoman and company.\n\nIn the name of the Khmer people who are now fighting against the pro-American traitors and their master, U.S. imperialism. I have the honour to set forth our official position with regard to these three “schemes” as follows:\n\n(a) We deny in advance the right of the de-Asianized and Americanized governments of Bangkok, Seoul and Saigon and the non-Asian governments of Canberra and Wellington to interfere in whatever manner in the internal affairs of the Indo-Chinese peoples, of the Khmer people in particular.\n\nIndo-China belongs to the Indo-Chinese alone. The affairs of Cambodia concern only the Cambodians. The throe Indo-Chinese countries know only one foreign invasion, that is, the invasion by the United States, the sole violator of the Geneva Agreements of 1954 on Indo-China and that of 1962 on Laos.\n\nTherefore, if the de-Asianized Asians, Americanized Asians and servile Asian dependents of the United States as well as the sham Asians are to meet at a conference, they should put on the agenda of this conference the sole question of unconditional, total and immediate withdrawal of the ground, naval and air forces of the United States and its satellites from Indo-China.\n\nWe recall that among the future participants in the projected sham Asian conference are those like Thailand, south Korea, Australia and New Zealand which, by sending their soldiers, have invaded and are committing aggression against south Viet Nam on the orders of U.S. imperialism.\n\nThe conference to be convened by Mr. Adam Malik, the well-known servant of the United States, should therefore limit its “ambition” to bringing about a halt to this invasion and aggression,\n\n(b) We condemn in advance all solutions to be concocted by the United States directly or through intermediary “friendly” governments for the governmental problem of Phnom Penh with a view to giving Lon Nol a new chance of maintaining its power.\n\nUnless this regime of the sanguinary traitor resigns totally and the arch traitors go into exile abroad, there will be no question of the Khmer people and their Liberation Army accepting any “modus Vivendi” with the corrupted Rightist and ultra-Rightist criminals and servants of U.S. imperialism.\n\nThe Khmer people and their National United Front of Kampuchea and Liberation Army will continue lo light guns in hand, even if it should lake them several years till the Lon Nol-Sirik Matak regime is crushed, the traitors and their chief accomplices are punished and U.S. imperialism is rendered unable lo engineer another coup against Cambodia like that of March IB. 1970.\n\n(c) We resolutely condemn the attempts made by the Washington government and other governments acting as its accomplices lo describe the Khmer people’s armed resistance to the fascist and traitorous Lon Nol regime as “foreign invasion” so as to justify the intervention ir, Cambodia by the imperialist and satellite forces.\n\nAt present, with the support of the other brother peoples of Indo-China, the Khmer people alone, under the banner of the National United Front of Kampuchea, assume the responsibility of liberating Cambodia.\n\nThis conforms to the April 25 Joint Declaration of the Summit Conference of the Indo-Chinese Peoples in letter and in spirit. The declaration says:\n\n“Inspired by the principle that the liberation and defence of each country is the affair of its own people, the different parties undertake to do everything possible lo render mutual support in accordance with the desire of the interested party and on the basis of mutual respect.”\n\nWe therefore declare that neither the United States nor any other country or government outside Indo-China has the right to intervene militarily in Indo-China in general and in Cambodia in particular.\n\nAs far as our country Cambodia is concerned, we draw the attention of the powers outside Indo-China to the very grave consequences of their present or eventual intervention, for which they alone are to be held responsible.\n\nsigned: N.

Four countries are the lackeys of the United Stales in its war against the Indo-Chinese peoples, and the rest consuls of governments closely subordinated to America politically and economically.\n\nThis so-called Asian conference has no other aim than lo confirm the illegal authority of the Lon Nol-Sirik Matak clique rejected by the Khmer people and condemned by the international community for its methods of tyrannical, racist, sanguinary and barbarous rule.\n\nIt is impermissible that a group of countries assume the right to handle the Cambodian affairs without the knowledge of and against the will of the Cambodian people. It is a grave interference in the internal affairs of another state and a flagrant violation of its sovereignty. This is contrary to the U.N. Charter.\n\nIt is alleged that this so-called conference intends to find some solutions aimed at safeguarding the independence and neutrality of Cambodia, while the members of this conference are the servile lackeys of the United States which is committing monstrous crimes against the independence and sovereignty of this country. This is the peak of nonsense and hypocrisy. This massive invasion of Cambodia by the American troops and the troops of their Saigon lackeys has been condemned by the whole world and. first of all, by the American people.\n\nIf it really wanted to safeguard the independence and neutrality of Cambodia, it should in the first place condemn the United Stales and its lackeys for this Open aggression against the sovereignty of a member .state of the United Nations. The United States is the ferocious destroyer of the peace of the Cambodian people and of world peace.\n\nThe Cambodian problem concerns no one other than the Cambodian people. It can be settled easily by the latter after the complete withdrawal of the troops of the United States and their lackeys, and this withdrawal should be immediate.\n\nThe Royal Government of National Union, on the other hand, thanks the countries which have refused the Invitation to participate in this so-called conference. By their correct attitude they contribute to the effort of not making the Cambodian and Indo-Chinese affairs complicated. These countries are Burma. India, Pakistan, Ceylon. Afghanistan and Nepal.\n\nPeking, May 17, 1970\n\nStatement of Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia\n\nStatement of the Royal Government of National Union Under the Leadership of the N.U.F.K.\n\nSource: Peking Review, No. 21， May 22, 1970\n\nThe Royal Government of National Union Under the Leadership of the N.U.F.K. reiterate:, that it is not a “government in exile.” Moreover, it reiterates that three of its members continue lo lead our armed forces in battle in our own country: this proves that the Government of National Union has deep roots in Cambodia With the extension of the liberated areas, (he other members of the Government will return lo our beloved motherland to carry on the fighting and organize the administration of the country in Conformity with the Political Programme of the N.U.F.K.\n\nFurthermore, the swiftness with which the Cambodian people have responded extensively to the March 23. 1970 historic appeal of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk. Head of State, and the vigour with which the National Liberation Army of the N.U.F.K. has dealt blows at I he American troops and the mercenary troops of Saigon, which dared to trample on the soil of our country, and at the troops of the Lon Nol-Sirik Matak apprentices-dictators, lackeys of the C.I.A. — all this clearly shows that the Royal Government of National Union has the full and enthusiastic support of the Cambodian people.\n\nSince the American imperialists have the impudence lo attack the sovereignty, peace and neutrality of our motherland, the Cambodian people will assuredly counter-attack them triumphantly.\n\nPeking May 10, 1970\n\nRoyal Government of National Union of Cambodia Severs Diplomatic Relations With United States\n\nStatement of the Royal Government of National Union Under the Leadership of the N.U.F.K. on the Rupture of Diplomatic Relations With the Government of the United States of America\n\nSource: Peking Review, No. 21， May 22, 1970\n\nExperience shows that the American imperialists were and remain to be the most ferocious, most implacable, most treacherous and most dangerous enemies of the Cambodian people, of their policy of national independence, peace and neutrality, and of their leader Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, Head of State.\n\nThe American imperialists refused to sign the 1954 Geneva Agreements on Indo-China.\n\nThey created the aggressive SEATO pact. They flagrantly bombed and strafed our frontier villages, rendering thousands of women, children and old people innocent victims in addition to grave material damage.\n\nFinally the C.I.A., on Nixon’s orders, started a course of action culminating in the military coup d’etat of March 18, 1970. and the installation in Phnom Penh of a fascist and racist dictatorial regime at the U.S. imperialists’ disposal headed by Lon Nol-Sirik Matak.\n\nIn the past few days, trampling underfoot their solemn statement of recognizing and respecting the policy of national independence, peace and neutrality of Cambodia, and the territorial integrity of our country within its present borders, the American imperialists have invaded our country on a large scale and savagely bombed our defenceless cities and villages.\n\nThis typical intervention of the American imperialists in our internal affairs runs counter to all international laws. Its sole purpose is to save the tottering Lon Nol-Sirik Matak regime unanimously spurned by the Cambodian people, because the whole world has come to see and is aware that without this criminal, large-scale intervention, the armed forces of the N.U.F.K. would already be in Phnom Penh at this moment.\n\nThis extension of the war on the Indo-Chinese Peninsula is a direct threat to national independence and peace in Southeast Asia and the world.\n\nIn the face of this grave escalation, all the people and countries cherishing peace and freedom and in solidarity with our people heroically fighting to regain their sacred rights, have most severely denounced and condemned the invasion of Cambodia by the American-south Vietnamese troops.\n\nIn view of these crimes and this unjustifiable invasion committed by the American imperialists and in view of their typical violations of the solemn statements which had led to the resumption of diplomatic relations between Cambodia and the United States, the Royal Government of National Union Under the Leadership of the N.U.F.K., the sole legal and legitimate Government of the Cambodian people, decides to sever from this day all diplomatic and consular relations with the Government of the United States. The responsibility for this rupture rests entirely and solely with the American Government.\n\nThe Royal Government of National Union avails itself of this occasion to renew its appeal to the peace-and freedom-loving people and countries in the world to firmly support the just cause of the Cambodian people by refusing to recognize and co-operate with the Lon Nol-Sirik Matak puppet regime.\n\nPeking, May 10, 1970\n\nCambodian Head of State Samdech Sihanouk Writes to Premier Chou En-lai —Expressing deepest gratitude for Chinese Government’s October 10 statement\n\nSource: Peking Review, No. 43, October 23, 1970\n\nHis Excellency Mr. Chou En-lai, Premier of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China\n\nRespected Mr. Premier,\n\nIn the name of the Khmer people, the National United Front of Kampuchea, the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia and in my own name, we beg Your Excellency to kindly convey to His Excellency the venerated and beloved Chairman Mao Tsetung, to His Excellency the respected Vice-Chairman Lin Piao, to the Chinese Government and the great Chinese people our deepest gratitude for the statement of the Government of the People’s Republic China issued on October 10, exposing the fraud of the Phnom Penh traitors, lackeys of the U.S. imperialists, in their so-called “republicanization” of the Khmer state, and reaffirming the very powerful and total support of China and its people for the Kingdom of Cambodia, the symbol of loyally to the Khmer people, their supreme interests and their dignity, and the symbol of attachment to the ideals of democracy, freedom, progress and independence.\n\nWe are eternally grateful to China, the best friend and the greatest and most effective support of the Khmer people, for its equity with regard to the Khmer monarchy at a time when the Phnom Penh traitors are unjustly heaping all “sins” on it, shamelessly and unblushingly distorting the 2,000-ycar history of our race. In this regard, the Government of the People’s Republic of China, of which Your Excellency respected and loved by all the patriotic Khmers is the eminent Premier, has made the following historical testimony to the world: “Whether a state is progressive or reactionary depends not on whether it bears the name of a kingdom or a republic, but on whether or not the policy it follows represents the interests of the people and whether or not its policy is anti-imperialist. There are certain kingdoms which pursue a policy of peace and neutrality, oppose imperialist aggression and defend their national independence, thus winning the approval and support of the people and playing a progressive role in history.”\n\nThis judgment, so equitable, of the People’s Republic of China, the perfect symbol of the people’s ideals of progress, democracy, independence and anti-imperialism, constitutes for us all, for all the Khmers who are not denatured, the greatest encouragement in their struggle for the advent of social justice, economic development and people’s democracy and for the restoration of complete independence to Cambodia.\n\nIt is with these sentiments that I beg Your Excellency to accept my highest and fraternal consideration.\n\nNorodom Sihanouk Head of State of Cambodia\n\nOctober 11, 1970\n\nLon Nol Clique Should Be Expelled From the U.N.\n\nSource: Peking Review, No. 43, October 26, 1973\n\nON October 17. 1973, the plenary meeting of the U.N. General Assembly adopted by a majority vote a resolution to include in the agenda of the current session the item “Restoration of the Lawful Rights of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia in the United Nations.” This is a victory for the Cambodian people in the struggle to restore their legitimate rights in the United Nations.\n\nThe Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia is the sole legal government of Cambodia and is entitled to its legitimate rights in the United Nations. In March 1970, the Lon No] clique launched a reactionary coup d’etat and illegally usurped Cambodia’s seat in the world organization. Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, in his name as Head of State, called upon the Cambodian people to rise up and take punitive action against the Lon Nol traitorous clique. The Cambodian people, rallying around the Royal Government of National Union and giving full play to patriotism and revolutionary heroism, have for more than three years fought valiantly and stubbornly against the enemy and an excellent situation has emerged from the fighting. The People’s Armed Forces of National Liberation of Cambodia have rapidly grown in strength in the course of the fighting. The Royal Government of National Union now controls more than 90 per cent of the territory of the country and enjoys the warm support of the Cambodian people. In the liberated areas embracing over 80 per cent of the country’s population, administrative organs have been set up at all levels through democratic elections and have been effectively exercising the power of government. All this has been achieved under the leadership of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia.\n\nThe Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia under the leadership of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk consistently follows the policy of independence, peace, neutrality and non-alignment, supports the people’s revolutionary struggles of all countries, making positive contributions to the cause of the world’s people against imperialism, and thus has won widespread international support and praise. It has been recognized by nearly 50 countries. Not long ago, the delegation of the Royal Government of Cambodia led by Samdech Sihanouk achieved tremendous successes at the Fourth Conference of the Heads of State and Government of Non-Aligned Countries. Immediate recognition of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia as the sole legal government of Cambodia was demanded by this conference which was attended by more than 70 countries. Facts clearly show that the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia enjoys increasingly high international prestige. It is indeed sheer nonsense for the Lon Nol clique to call the government a “government in exile.”\n\nIt is entirely illegal for the traitorous Lon Nol clique to occupy Cambodia’s seat in the United Nations. This handful of traitors who wreck the country and ruin the people are wholly backed by foreign forces. They are not only betrayers of Cambodia’s cause of national independence, but also saboteurs of Cambodia’s policy of Independence, peace, neutrality and non-alignment. They represent no one but themselves. The Lon Nol clique has asserted that it controlled most of the country. This is an out-and-out lie. The world knows that the Lon Nol clique, spurned by the Cambodian people, has retreated to and entrenched itself in a few Isolated cities such as Phnom Penh. It has been driven to the wall and its days are numbered. It is only owing to U.S. support that it can prolong its precarious existence and wage a desperate death-bed struggle. To allow such a traitorous clique to continue to occupy the U.N. seat is nothing but an insult to the Cambodian people and a mockery of the United Nations.\n\nThe restoration of the legitimate rights of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia in the United Nations is entirely justifiable. To uphold international justice and defend the principles of the U.N. Charter, the present absurd situation in which the Lon Nol clique has usurped a seat in the United Nation:; should be brought to an end, the legitimate rights of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia in the United Nations should be restored immediately and the representatives of the Lon Nol clique should be expelled from the United Nations and all its affiliated organs. This is not only the Cambodian people’s will and demand, but also the common desire of all countries and peoples upholding justice.\n\n(“Renmin Ribao” Commentator, October 21)\n\nUnited Nations: Proposal for Restoring Lawful Rights Of Royal Government of Cambodia Included in Agenda\n\nSource: Peking Review, No. 43, October 26, 1973\n\nAT its meetings on October 15 and 16, the General Committee discussed whether it should propose to the U.N. General Assembly the inclusion in the agenda of its current session of the proposal put forward jointly by representatives from Albania, Algeria and China and 28 other countries for the “Restoration of the Lawful Rights of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia in the United Nations Organization.” At the meeting on the 16th, Egypt announced that it had joined the ranks of sponsor nations, thus increasing their number to 32.\n\nAfter a nearly four-hour debate at that meeting, the General Committee decided by a majority vote to propose to the U.N. General Assembly the inclusion of the 32-nalion proposal in its agenda. Eleven countries, including Cameroon and China, voted for the proposal; 10 countries, including Denmark and France, abstained; and only representatives from the United States and Fiji voted against it.\n\nSpeaking at the October 16 meeting Chinese Representative Huang Hua pointed out: The puppet Lon Nol group’s unlawful usurpation of Cambodia’s seat in the United Nations is in complete violation of the U.N. Charter. Back in March 1970, Samdech Sihanouk sent a telegram to U Thant, the then Secretary-General of the United Nations, pointing out that the United Nations must not recognize the Lon Nol group. But over the past three years such a just demand has not been met as a result of the obstruction of some big powers. This is intolerable. In order to uphold international justice and defend the principles of the U.N. Charter, the Chinese delegation maintains that the current session of the General Assembly should discuss and decide upon the restoration of the lawful rights of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia in the United Nations, and completely end the absurd situation in which Cambodia’s seat in the United Nations Is illegally usurped by the representatives of the Lon Nol puppet group.\n\nThe October 17 General Assembly plenary meeting approved the recommendation by the General Committee to include in the agenda of the current General Assembly Session the item “Restoration of the Lawful Rights of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia in the United Nations Organization” by a vote of 69 in favour and 24 against with 29 abstentions. The meeting also decided that the item should be discussed at the plenary meeting of the Assembly.\n\nRepresentatives of some of the countries sponsoring the proposal spoke at the meeting before the vote.\n\nReiz Malile, Deputy Foreign Minister of Albania, took the floor first. He expressed the hope that the decision of the General Committee to recommend the inclusion of the item would be fully supported by the General Assembly to rectify the unjust situation now existing. The Cambodian people had expressed their firm desire that the Lon Nol group be expelled from the United Nations and its related organs, he said.\n\nMalile said that the United States had fomented a coup d’etat in 1970 and installed its puppets in Phnom Penh. All peace-loving people condemned this flagrant aggression and supported the rights of the Cambodian people. The Cambodian people would accept no other authority than the Royal Government of National Union.\n\nMalile pointed out that the Soviet Union had always been on good terms with the Lon Nol puppet group.\n\nAlgerian Representative Abdellatif Rahal said that the Cambodian people had made it clear that they firmly supported the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia and regarded it as their sole legitimate government. The so-called “Khmer republic” represented no one but the Lon Nol group. He pointed out the United Nations must put an end to a fairy tale that had lasted too long and make a decision to expel the Lon Nol group from the United Nations.\n\nSamdech Sihanouk Speaks in Tientsin\n\nAugust 15, 1973: Day of Great Victory for the Cambodian People\n\nSource: Peking Review, No. 34, August 24, 1973\n\nAfter vacationing in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, Head of State and Chairman of the National United Front of Cambodia, and his wife Princess Monique Sihanouk arrived in Peking on August 16. Before coming to Peking, they slopped over in Tientsin where the Municipal Revolutionary Committee gave a banquet in their honour on August 15. Following are excerpts front the important speech the Samdech made at the banquet:\n\nAUGUST 15, 1973 is a historic day for us Khmers, because this is a day of great victory for our national resistance and a day of utter disgrace for U.S. imperialism.\n\nIn fact, since March 1973 till August 15, 1973 U.S. President Richard Nixon has made it the objective of the U.S. strategic and tactical air force to destroy Cambodia completely, and fixed the following aims: to bring the People’s Armed Forces of National Liberation of Cambodia to their knees and make the N.U.F.C. and the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia accept an armistice which calls for a ceasefire on the battlefield, an acceptance of a de facto division of Cambodia into two parts and a political compromise with the traitorous Phnom Penh regime which impudently calls itself the “Khmer republic.”\n\nPresident Richard Nixon, confident in his electronic computers and the astrology of his valet Lon No!, thought that because of 200 raids every day by Fills, F4s and other “sophisticated” tactical aircraft and 50 raids every day by B52s against Cambodia, the N.U.F.C, the E.G.N.U.C., and the P.A.F.N.L.C. would be “pulverized” after five and a half months of these genocidal raids, the intensity, savagery and cruelty of which, not to mention its effectiveness, are unprecedented in the annals of international and world wars.\n\nToday, August 15, 1973 has arrived and the whole world sees that the P.A.F.N.L.C. have not b"
