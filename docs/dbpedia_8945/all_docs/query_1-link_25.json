She really cares for the kids. She spent hours with me for a visit that was only supposed to take 30 minutes due to my son being autistic.\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n5 out of 5 stars5 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 11/22/2023\n\nDr. Falcone shared her phone number, and was accessible so readily. She called me daily, when I was experiencing pain. She even called me at 9pm! Never have I had this level of patient care.\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n5 out of 5 stars5 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 9/16/2023\n\nDr Falcone is one of the best I've encountered ever.

She explained in detail her assessment and plan, and engaged all of our questions. She has a natural way of working with children. She really set our minds at ease, not because everything was perfectly fine, but because she had a plan for any issue and confidently shared that plan with us. We are thankful to have found such a compassionate and skilled provider for our son.\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n5 out of 5 stars5 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 5/8/2023\n\nEveryone I know and don't know I let them know you are the best top notch\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n5 out of 5 stars5 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 1/16/2023\n\nDr. Falcone spent a long time with my issue. I was relieved that she was a thorough as she was to find a solution to the extent of bringing the optician to the consultation room!"
