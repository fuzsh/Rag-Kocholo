This 36-player group will serve as the training team pool for the team that will defend Team USA’s 2009 gold medal at the 2013 Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL) World Cup in Oshawa, Ontario.\n\nAmong those chosen to the squad were 2012 Vanderbilt graduate Ally Carey and Commodore assistant coach Amber Falcone.
