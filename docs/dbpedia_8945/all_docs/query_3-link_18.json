        "text": "*Photo by Jonathan Becker.*New York, N.Y.—“It was permissible, but I wouldn’t advise another fund to do it!” Philip Falcone says of the $113 million loan he took from the fund he manages, Harbinger Capital Partners, to pay his 2008 taxes—a move that has made him the subject of an S.E.C. investigation. “I have always kept the bulk of my money, and I mean the bulk of my money, in the fund,” he tells Vanity Fair. “How can anyone possibly say my interests aren’t aligned with theirs?” Contributing editor Bethany McLean spoke to “Manhattan’s most controversial couple,” Philip and Lisa Maria Falcone, about the gossip and accusations that surround them. The Falcones saw their already substantial fortunes soar when Philip bet that the bottom would drop out of the subprime market. It was a “very, very, very big position,” Philip Falcone tells McLean, of the trade that made Harbinger some $10 billion. At its peak, Harbinger managed $26 billion. “Once I get a conviction, I move big and quickly,” he says. His investors saw growth, but many pulled out of Harbinger once it represented too big a position in their portfolios. “We were victims of our own success,” he tells McLean. “I would be hard-pressed to think of another fund that had that level of redemptions—and the bulk were before the market fell apart.” Harbinger now manages about $7 billion, and Philip has taken another risky position by investing much of the fund in LightSquared, a satellite communications network in competition with AT&T and Verizon Wireless. The Falcones were accused of trying to sway the F.C.C. with a 2009 donation to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign. “We neither asked for nor received special treatment from the F.C.C,” Philip tells McLean. They say they have a history of contributing to both parties. “He’s not gaming the rules,” says one industry investor. “He read where the F.C.C. is trying to go. The F.C.C. is abetting him with open eyes.”\n\nPhilip recalls “the worst day of my life,” the day he lost $1 billion in a daring short position with Wachovia. “I thought, Pumping gas in Chisholm isn’t so bad!” he tells McLean, referring to his hometown in Minnesota. On another loser, his investment in the New York Times, he tells McLean: “If I could do it all over again, I probably wouldn’t do it. I’m not afraid to admit when I make a mistake, and that was not one of my best trades.” According to McLean, Falcone “got a little bit careless with other people’s money once he had his own fortune and that he didn’t do his homework as carefully as in the early years.” “When he sticks to his knitting, he’s fabulous,” says someone who knows him well. “When he asks others for advice, he’s horrible.” “I like to make my own mistakes,” Falcone says.\n\n“He has a reputation for being stubborn, volatile, and aggressive, and now the word on the Street is that, well, maybe you can’t trust him, either,” a hedge-fund investor tells McLean. “These businesses, all they are is client trust. The money can vanish overnight. Once you ding a guy’s reputation, and there’s the perception that he broke that trust, it is virtually impossible to get it back.” “If I’ve made one mistake, and I’ve made more than one, it was not having the right terms for my thought process,” Philip Falcone says. “The negative aspect of what’s going on now is that my integrity is being questioned.”\n\n“When I hear people bashing Philip, I think, But he’s the American Dream!” Lisa Maria says. “I’m the girl from Harlem and he’s the boy from Chisholm, and now we’ve got all this stuff. I never got criticized in Harlem, then I came to this side. It’s, like, Wow. Why aren’t you embracing me? Is it that Philip and I are the Beverly Hillbillies?” Of the many raised eyebrows that have greeted her entrance to New York society, she says: “I am great at one thing, and one thing only. I hate to say it, but that’s being myself, and that’s what people don’t like about me.” One of her alleged errors was announcing a $10 million donation to Friends of the High Line in the middle of one of the charity’s benefits. “If you don’t give, you get bad press,” she says. “If you do give, well, you did it at the wrong time. That’s why they have you there—to give! Is there an etiquette book on how to donate money? If so, I’d love to buy it so I do the right thing!”\n\n“I don’t go where I’m not invited. As much as people criticize me, they want me there. It gives attention to them,” she tells McLean. “If I wanted to be famous, I’d have my own reality show. They hate me enough already.” She insists that her children are what she cares most about. “Our world revolves around them,” she says. “I put them to bed at eight. I go to every activity.” Apparently she wears the wrong clothes while doing so. “She drops her daughters off at school wearing billions of dollars of clothes!” says a parent whose children go to Brearley with the Falcones’ twins. “She never fits in,” says an observer.\n\n“For all her considerable chutzpah, there is a surprising shyness about her,” McLean writes of Lisa Maria. “Variations on the comments that seem so obnoxious in print are far less so in person.” McLean notes that in her presence “the Falcones are remarkably protective of each other.”\n\nThe July issue of Vanity Fair hits newsstands in New York and L.A. on Thursday, June 2, and nationally and on the iPad on Tuesday, June 7."
