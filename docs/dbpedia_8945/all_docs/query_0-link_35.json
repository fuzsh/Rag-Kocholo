        "text": "Paul joined Velocity Clinical Research as President and CEO in 2018 after 26 years of “perfect symmetry” in the site business — he ran sites for 13 years and spent another 13 years managing them on the Sponsor/CRO side. He has served as Corporate VP, Global Site Solutions at Parexel; VP, Global Site Management at IQVIA; and was a Founder and Managing Director of Synexus.\n\nPaul joined Velocity to address one of the fundamental industry challenges. “Patient recruitment is still the biggest problem in clinical trials,” he says. “I want Velocity to set a new industry standard for delivering high-quality study data as quickly and efficiently as possible.”\n\nPaul holds a PhD in Biomedical Engineering from the University of London. He has served on the Association of Clinical Research Professionals (ACRP) Board of Trustees since 2017 and chaired the committee in 2020.\n\nAlthough Paul has traveled the world in his various roles, the UK native now resides in the US. When he’s not poring over budgets and feasibility data, you can find Paul exploring the culinary offerings in his adopted home (Durham, NC) and checking flight times to various Caribbean and Central American beaches. He misses Wales rugby but has warmed up to American football. Paul is hoping his propensity for getting stopped for speeding has not followed him to America. Update: It has. In the words of Jeff Jensen, and otherwise intrepid member of the Velocity management team, “I don’t even feel safe riding in the same Uber with him.”"
