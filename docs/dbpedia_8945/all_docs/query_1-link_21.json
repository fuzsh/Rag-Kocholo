        "text": "I just sat through most of the nine episodes of “Falcone.” And I’m here to report that I would rather be the victim of a mob-related hit than watch/read/endure one more Joe Pistone (aka Donnie Brasco, aka Falcone)-related saga.\n\nPistone, in case you live in Bangladesh, was a Fed who went undercover and infiltrated the Mafia in the early ’80’s, and has since made a cottage industry of his exploits. Now we’ve got “Falcone” the miniseries. (I don’t care what they call it — nine episodes with an ending is a miniseries.)\n\nYou know how you wish “The Sopranos” would never end? I wished “Falcone” would end after the second episode.\n\nIt could have been a good four-hour series.\n\nIt’s not horrible; it’s just that it’s been done before and, after watching “The Sopranos,” “Falcone” rings as true as Jocelyn Wildenstein’s facelift.\n\nI mean, maybe Pistone hasn’t seen a mobster since he left the bureau, but what about the producers? If they’d even watched one espisode of “The Sopranos” they should have gotten the message that stilted mob dialogue no longer flies (“C’mon, now, go upstairs and shake down our guy like the good little Mafiosi you are!” And worse: “I seen 42 dets avoided in dis bizniz wit fine food.”)\n\nAnd the hair! Clearly this crime family must have Frederick Fakkai on the payroll.\n\nBut it takes more than a three-quarter-length leather jacket and a pot of sauce to make a mobster believable.\n\nIn this series, Pistone as Falcone (Jason Gedrick) has infiltrated the Volante crime family. His challenge is to balance his life with his wife, the fabulously-coiffed Maggie (Amy Carlson), and his two daughters with his crime-family obligations.\n\nHis brother in crime is Sonny Napoli (who looks like a yuppie version of Andy Capasso). Sonny runs a crew of made and unmade men, (Titus Welliver, Robert John Burke, Sonny Marinelli and Lillo Brancato Jr.) and is working his way up the crime ladder. He does this by mass killings with no repercussions.\n\nIt begins when the head of the family is assassinated and Ricci “The Mad Man” (Eric Roberts, of all people!) takes over as boss.\n\nSonny and Victor Maura, a suave “zip” (gangster from the other side), must then vie for the title of underboss.\n\nMob boss Roberts, looking and acting like everybody’s embarrassing crack cousin, meantime is running things from prison like a big, crazy whiner.\n\nAt one point he wails, “I’m a tough guy, Sonny, but my tough guy-ness is all soft … You know what these guys don’t understand — these Russians in Brooklyn? That we were here first!”\n\nI haven’t seen this kind of behavior since my daughter was in pre-K. And since Roberts more or less dissappears after this, I can’t tell you whether he stops crying or not.\n\nLook, it’s OK TV in a slow week, and the guy’s are eye candy and very fashion forward, but it misses — just misses.\n\nAs Sammy the Bull might have said to Matty the Horse, “Horse? It’s Bull!”\n\n——\n\n“Falcone”\n\nTonight at 9 on WCBS/Ch. 2"
