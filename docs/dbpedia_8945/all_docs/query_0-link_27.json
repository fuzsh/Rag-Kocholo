        "text": "IN one of my earliest memories I'm standing with my mother at the window of an apartment in Hoboken looking west and up the palisades at Union City.\n\nMy mother points toward the crest of the steep rise and says that soon we will be moving from our Hoboken apartment to a house of our own on the hill.\n\n\"Why?\" I ask.\n\n\"Because if the Hudson River ever overflows,\" she answers, \"we'll be up there and won't get wet.\"\n\nThe real reason we were moving, of course, wasn't fear that river was about to breach its banks; it was because our young family was moving up in the world. Forty years ago, upward mobility for a second-generation immigrant family from Hoboken was a move \"up the viaduct\" to Union City. The next step, if my father worked enough overtime, would be a move from \"the city,\" which included nearly all of Hudson County, to \"the suburbs,\" which meant just about anywhere west of Union City.\n\nThousands of families made similar journeys, eventually settling in houses with yards and driveways and detached garages, often in Bergen County.\n\nSome stayed behind, though, and toughed-out life in the city. And over the intervening 40 years, those who remained have watched their property values -- and their pride in their towns -- rise and fall and rise again as Hoboken, Jersey City, Union City, West New York, Weehawken, Guttenberg and North Bergen continued to serve as they had served for more than a century: as stepping-stones for succeeding waves of immigrants a little too timid to tackle New York City and a little too poor to even think of life in the suburbs.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
