        "text": "Vincent Falcone spent 10 years as Frank Sinatra's musical director in the waning years of the Chairman of the Board's 60-plus year-career. The superlative musician has written a book about himself and his years with his former boss, who died in 1998 at age 82.\n\nThe book, \"Frankly -- Just Between Us: My Life Conducting Frank Sinatra's Music\" (Hal Leonard Publishing; $24.95) is co-authored by Bob Popyk. The publication date will be Dec. 10.\n\nI've noticed that you never call Frank Sinatra \"Frank,\" even though you spent several years with him.\n\nI could never call him Frank. I respected him too much. I called him Mr. Sinatra or Mr. S. or boss or whatever.\n\nHow did you go to work for Sinatra?\n\nI've always believed, and Mr. Sinatra said this to me one time, everybody gets at least one shot in their life to do something and you'd better be ready -- you may not get more than one shot.\n\nI had just been hired at Caesars Palace and he was the first act for which I played. When the opportunity arises, you'd better be ready for it.\n\nWhat was being associated with him like?\n\nHe was always, always very nice to me, very good to me. If I would walk into a room, where he was talking to important people, he always acknowledged me -- and that meant a great deal to me. He was always very gracious.\n\nHe was responsible for my nickname, Vinnie. I was never called Vinnie prior to being with him.\n\nYet you eventually were fired. What happened?\n\nMy employment with Mr. Sinatra actually ended twice, but we remained friends. He always remained a supporter of me.\n\nThere were internal problems (within the orchestra) that he didn't realize at first and so he fired me. When he came to realize them, he rehired me. I say this with no ego -- he told me and others told me -- he missed me and wanted me back and he saw to it that I did come back.\n\nProblems always arose between other people (working for Sinatra) who were jealous of me, and that would cause strife. One thing he did not like was strife -- he had enough of it in his life.\n\nThe second time it was my decision to leave, not his. By then I had established myself with other artists and I didn't want to put my head back in the noose.\n\nWhen did you last work with him?\n\nIt was in '86 when I last worked for him as music director, but I worked with him on tour (as a pianist) into the early '90s.\n\nHow was he in his later years?\n\nI always felt bad about this. His last performances were not up to his standard. I do believe, though I have no medical proof, that he was beginning to suffer from dementia -- as you get older, your memory lapses. He was having trouble remembering lyrics, but audiences loved him anyway, as well they should have.\n\nWhy have you chosen to write a book at this time?\n\nFor many years people said I ought to write a book. I have a friend of 40 years, an editor (Bob Popyk), who lives in Syracuse, N.Y., my hometown. He edits and writes for many well-known publications around the country. He's an established person in publishing and editing. He asked me to write a couple of chapters to see what he could do with them.\n\nWhat has been the reaction to the book so far?\n\nThe book hasn't been released yet, and amazon.com, at last count, already had 14,000 orders. Barnes & Noble bookstores are putting them on their shelves.\n\nBorders Books here in Las Vegas turned the publisher down for a book signing -- in my own town.\n\nTo me, I can't even believe the book is being published. But I find it difficult to understand why, in my own town, a book store wouldn't be interested in the book.\n\nFrank Sinatra helped build this town. You would think there would be some interest. I find one of the greatest disappointments is that more attention isn't paid to those who created this town. It's as if they are forgotten.\n\nIsn't the town changing since the days of Sinatra?\n\nAs management becomes younger and younger they are going to pay attention to the icons of their own day, but I must say in my day we recognized the popular talent of the day, but we never forgot those that came before us.\n\nWhat do you think of the entertainment in Las Vegas today?\n\nI'm sure people find it spectacular and incredible. But for me -- I've been here 35 years, and many have been here a lot longer -- it has lost its intimacy. The entertainment business has changed to the degree that the stars are no longer here. I find that even though the huge production shows like \"O\" and \"Mystere\" are resplendent and incredible, the intimacy between the performer and the audience is gone.\n\nWe have a wonderful reservoir of talent, but for the most part I find that the greater talents are not shown here anymore.\n\nWhat we see in the lounges, certainly not in all but in many cases, the entertainment couldn't have been hired in this town 35 years ago -- that's my opinion.\n\nWe used to have Redd Foxx, Vic Damone and Don Rickles in the lounges.\n\nWho do you like today?\n\nClint Holmes is a fabulous entertainer in the Vegas tradition. Steve (Lawrence) and Eydie (Gorme), for whom I work, have one of best cabaret shows in the world.\n\nBill Acosta. Bob Anderson did a great show when he lived here -- but for the most part what you see today doesn't measure up. I'm sorry for that. I will be forever grateful that I lived through the period of time that I did.\n\nDo you have trouble finding work now?\n\nI get enough work with the established people still here -- the Robert Goulets, the Steve and Eydies. Joe Piscopo, Jack Jones, Dianne Carroll.\n\nBut there are far less opportunities for me than there used to be. I'm fortunate to have many clients and so I'm able to work, but generally the availability of work for someone my age isn't there -- \"Youth must be served,\" a quote from Mr. Sinatra. I didn't know what he meant then, but I do now.\n\nJerry Fink can be reached at 259-4058 or [email protected].\n\narchive"
