        "text": "Carmine Falcone, also known as The Roman, was a Human businessman and crimelord who served as the head of Falcone Crime Family.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nCarmine Falcone was born on March 13, 1929 in Naples, Italy to Antonina and Vincent Falcone. He had several brothers and one sister named Carla. As a youngster, Carmine's father had joined up with the mafia and the Falcone family emigrated to the United States shortly before World War II in order to spread its influence.\n\nGrowing up, Falcone had a fascination with Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire, and enjoyed talking to his less-educated American Mafia counterparts about these subjects. Because of this, he was nicknamed \"The Roman\" by his underworld peers.\n\nThe Roman Empire[]\n\nBy the 1980s, Falcone had inherited his father's legacy and was considered one of the truly great crimelords of not only New York City but the entire eastern seaboard. Nicknamed The Roman for his unflinching ruthlessness and expansionism, his mafia network was often called \"The Roman Empire.\" Falcone virtually controlled the entire city, with the Mayor, the City council, and the police under his influence. Because of this, Falcone was virtually untouchable by the law.\n\nPersonality and traits[]\n\nRelationships[]\n\nRomances[]\n\nFriends[]\n\nThomas Wayne[]\n\nRomances[]\n\nLouisa Falcone[]\n\nPowers and Abilities[]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nTemplate:Imagecat (Falcone) Template:Quotepage (Falcone)"
