        "text": "Mario promised the people of Gotham that his criminal past was far behind him, and Falcone Imports was know a legitimate company. Mario even began doing business with Bruce Wayne and the Gotham Bank. During a meeting with the Gotham Bank, Mario was attacked by The Joker, acting on the orders of Two-Face. The Joker and his henchmen (disguised as window washers) shot at Falcone and his associates several times. Though no one died (aside from the Joker's men who had been poisoned by their boss), the Joker escaped. Earlier that day, The Joker attempted to eliminate two more of Two-Face's underworld rivals, the Maroni brothers. The Joker would even attack Sofia and Alberto, though the hit was all together a failure.\n\nRegardless of her condition, Sofia wished to restore the Falcone crime empire to it's former glory, and accused Mario of being a traitor to his family. In response, Mario told Sofia that the Falcone name could no longer be used for illegitimate activities. Mario even locked Sofia and her bodyguard Mirti out of her penthouse and by court order, Sofia could no longer use the Falcone name and could only refer to herself as Sofia Gigante. To further weaken Sofia's attempts, Mario formed a loose alliance with Janice Porter and began giving her information about Sofia's criminal activities.\n\nIt was later revealed that Sofia was in fact the cop-killer known as \"Hangman\", who would strangle victims (who were often associated with Harvey Dent) to death with nooses. After Porter was killed, possibly by Alberto, Mario realized he had no protection from his those who wanted him eliminated. Mario sought after Jim Gordon, Gotham's police commissioner. Mario then realized that Porter was having an affair with Two-Face, and was giving him the information on the Falcone crime family, that Mario gave her. Sofia eventually died at the hands of Harvey Dent, who she had sworn to destroy. While Sofia was being buried, Alberto's body was apparently found. A broken man, and nearly driven to the brink of insanity, Mario set fire to his grandfather's estate. Afterwards, Mario was institutionalized in Chicago. After an extended period of absence, Mario resurfaced in Gotham as the new head of the Falcone crime family. He fights a gang war against the Riddler and Two-Face.\n\nElsewhere in Gotham , Mario comes across Two Face's old hideout, and finds Diamond Jack, one of his associates, shot and dying. He asks where Two Face is, then finds out what this is all about, Gilda. At a construction site, Mario Falcone and Gilda are waiting supposedly to sell off the Jade Compass Society's secrets, but Mario is on edge, as he should be, because soon they are under siege by Two Face's men. Mario tries to escape with Gilda, threatening to kill her for setting him up, but she denies it all. With a gun to Gilda's head, Mario is shot three times in the back by Two Face."
