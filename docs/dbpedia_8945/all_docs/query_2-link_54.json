        "text": "Limitations\n\nThe special victims unit is on the hot seat when a five-year-old sexual assault case is reopened just days before the statute of limitations ends, so Detectives Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni) scramble to interview the three distinctly different victims, but are crushed when their legal maneuver to file an arrest warrant is denied. They and other SVU detectives are even more exasperated when they learn that one of the women (guest star Jenny Bacon) admits that she knows who the assailant is -- but won't tell because he now is a member of her church. Richard Belzer, Dann Florek and Michelle Hurd also star.\n\nWrath\n\nWhen three unrelated people connected to cases that were handled by Detective Benson (Mariska Hargitay) are found ritualistically murdered, all the evidence points to Benson as the true target of the violence. As she struggles with guilt over the murders, Benson continues to pursue the assailant despite warnings from the FBI that she may be in danger.\n\nScheherezade\n\nStabler visits dying lung cancer patient Judson Tierney who's itching to clear his conscience before he goes. Unable to get estranged daughter Sheila to come visit, Benson serves as her replacement as Tierney fesses up to his career in crime before 1971. It was in that year that he murdered his partner and took baby Sheila in to raise as his own to protect her from the hate in that household and give her a better life. However, with an innocent man now imprisoned on murder charges for 35 years, Novak and company fight to get Tierney's confessional testimony into evidence. Tierney helps clear the man's name and catches a momentary glimpse of his daughter before he passes away.\n\nOfficial Story\n\nThe powerful CEO of a private military contractor is confronted by protesters and later found drugged and sexually assaulted in a park. Detectives Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Amaro (Danny Pino) begin their investigation but find the victim unwilling to cooperate. As the SVU squad and Executive ADA David Haden (guest star Harry Connick Jr.) explore the motives behind the attack, a much larger crime and conspiracy in Iraq is unveiled. Also starring Ice-T (Detective Odafin Tutuola), Dann Florek (Captain Donald Cragen) and Kelli Giddish (Detective Amanda Rollins.) Laura Benanti (Maria Grazie) also guest stars.\n\nPanopticon\n\nIn the fourth season premiere, the team must devise new ways to continue their work without being detected by Samaritan after theyâre forced to take on new identities created by Root. Some, however, find it hard to ignore the Machineâs numbers, putting them all at risk of being seen by the rival Machine."
