This city is my birth right!\"\n\n—Sofia to Batman.[src]\n\nSofia Falcone (born March 10, 1987), also known under the alias Louisa Gigante, is the daughter of Carmine Falcone and the sister of the late Mario Falcone. Sofia was born and raised in Gotham but moved away to Miami when she was eleven because her father believed a life of crime was too dangerous for her. She returned to Gotham to attend her father's funeral but later stayed to become the new leader of the Falcone Crime Family. A year later, Sofia escaped Blackgate Penitentiary and tried to regain control over the city only to be thrown down several floors of Wayne Enterprises and put into a coma.\n\nBy October 2016, Sofia had awakened from her coma and she stayed in Gotham, marrying Rocco Gigante and changing her name to Louisa Gigante, after her mother. However, she later revealed herself to be The Hangman killer and that she was faking her paralysis, biding her time until the holiday killer struck, who she assumed was her brother. However, Sofia was revealed to have had a split personality that was the Holiday killer, created by Fish Mooney. She was then finally stopped by Batman and incarcerated at Arkham Asylum for treatment.\n\nBiography[]\n\nTBA\n\nPersonality[]\n\nInitially, Sofia was seen as being a kind and sentimental individual.

She was able to convince all of her family members that she was saddened by her father's demise when she, in fact, was the one who had murdered him.\n\nIndomitable will/Expert survivor: Sofia was described by her brother as someone who is \"hard to kill\" as she had previously been kidnapped back in Miami by a gang of criminals but managed to gun them all down and escape. It is also mentioned that she had many dangerous run ins when she was younger and growing up in Gotham but managed to survive them all. Sofia also able to miraculously survive being thrown down several floors, merely falling into a coma.\n\nEquipment[]\n\nGuns: Sofia was given a key to her father's armoury and uses a wide array of rifles, shotguns and machine guns in order to maintain her position as the leader of the crime family.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nBatman: Anarky[]\n\nBehind the Scenes[]"
