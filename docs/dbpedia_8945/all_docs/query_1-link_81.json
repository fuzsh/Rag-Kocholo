        "text": "Launch recap: Scroll down for live coverage of the Tuesday, June 25, liftoff of a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket from Kennedy Space Center Pad 39A.\n\nA triple-core SpaceX rocket lifted the GOES-U weather satellite into orbit on a partially cloudy Florida summer afternoon. Giving off five millions pounds of thrust at liftoff, the SpaceX vehicle delivered the latest NOAA weather satellite to orbit, before the two side boosters landed at Landing Sites 1 and 2− giving off double sonic booms heard throughout the Space Coast.\n\nAfter moving the launch time ten minutes to accommodate for weather, liftoff occurred at 5:26 p.m. EDT from Kennedy Space Center's Pad 39A. Skies had been mostly blue and sunny throughout the day, yet some clouds in the area were cause for concern.\n\nThe Space Force 45th Weather Squadron predicted only a 30 percent chance of favorable weather conditions during the two-hour launch window. Clouds are stated to be a main concern, yet proved not to be for long.\n\nWhen is the next Florida rocket launch? Is there a launch today? Upcoming SpaceX, NASA, ULA rocket launch schedule in Florida\n\nGOES-U is the latest weather satellites for NOAA's GOES-R series. Directed by NASA, built by Lockheed Martin and L3Harris, and launched by SpaceX, this satellite will not only enable earlier storm detection, but it will give forecasters more time to warn the public about approaching threats. GOES-U will also provide observation of the sun − which has been very active this year − to alert those who need to know about approaching solar flares.\n\nUpdate 5:42 p.m.: Space Reporter, Rick Neale, has given an update on the crowds at the Visitor Complex.\n\nUpdate 5:35 p.m.: As heard through the Space Coast, the boosters have landed!\n\nUpdate 5:26 p.m.: Falcon Heavy has left the pad!\n\nUpdate 5:20 p.m.: If you cannot see this launch in person, NASA has you covered.\n\nUpdate 5:16 p.m.: Get to your viewing spot as soon as possible so you don't miss this rare rocket launch.\n\nThis launch will be headed west.\n\nUpdate 5:09 p.m.: FLORIDA TODAY Space Reporter, Rick Neale, is live at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, where crowds have gathered to witness this launch.\n\nA large crowd has descended on the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex for today’s launch.\n\nNeale reported:\n\n\"Prime viewing tickets at the Apollo/Saturn V Center on Banana Creek went on sale June 11 – and tickets sold out the next morning, spokesperson Ashlynn Webb said.\n\nBy 2:30 p.m. today, dozens of spectators were already seated in bleachers amid sunshine and hot weather outside the main visitor complex, hours ahead of launch.\n\nBy 4:55 p.m., the heat index hit a sweltering 99 degrees at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, the National Weather Service reported.\"\n\nUpdate 5:05 p.m.: The two Falcon Heavy side boosters will land on the SpaceX landing zones 1 and 2 on the Cape Canaveral coast. This will generate multiple sonic booms - after the boosters land, as light travels faster than sound.\n\nThe core booster will be broken up over the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nUpdate 4:56 p.m.: Many have noticed that the Falcon 9 boosters seem very \"clean\", as they are usually marked from multiple reentries. SpaceX has confirmed the boosters are in fact new.\n\nSpaceX's website states: \"Following booster separation, the two new side boosters supporting this mission will land on SpaceX’s Landing Zones 1 and 2 (LZ-1 and LZ-2) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\"\n\nUpdate 4:40 p.m.: SpaceX has begun loading the three Falcon 9 boosters of the Falcon Heavy! Liftoff is targeted for 5:26 p.m..\n\nUpdate 4:32 p.m.: NASA teams have given the GO for launch at 5:26 p.m. EDT.\n\nIt was stated that weather conditions improve to 70% favorable during that time.\n\nUpdate 4:24 p.m.: The countdown clock at the press site has moved to a liftoff at 5:26 p.m. EDT.\n\nT-one hour.\n\nUpdate 4:20 p.m.: NOAA has shared some fun facts on today's liftoff.\n\nUpdate 4:05 p.m.: Check out this great photo our Space Team photographer, Craig Bailey, caught this morning.\n\nUpdate 3:55 p.m.: SpaceX has confirmed that teams continue to move towards a liftoff at 5:16 p.m. EDT.\n\nMeanwhile, blue skies have returned over the launch pad!\n\nUpdate 3:40 p.m.: Clouds have moved in towards the launch pad area, yet teams are still proceeding towards liftoff at 5:16 p.m. EDT.\n\nUpdate 3:25 p.m.: Titusville Police have issued a reminder ahead of today's big launch. Please watch out for launch spectators and drive safely."
