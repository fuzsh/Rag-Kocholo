        "text": "A literal match made in comedy heaven, Melissa and Ben first crossed paths in a comedy writing class at the Groundlings comedy school in Los Angeles. The first day, she was smitten with his quiet humor as he performed a skit about \"an inmate that really liked his new roommate,\" she recalled on The Ellen Show. \"I immediately was like, 'Oh, he's strange. I like him,'\" Melissa continued. \"And we were friends from, like, day one.\"\n\nThey got to know each other better while writing their first skit, titled All Seger's Eve, about a Bob Seger-themed holiday, according to The Hollywood Reporter. \"From the very first time we spoke, we were on the same page,\" Ben told Us Weekly in 2013. \"We love each other, respect each other and try not to sweat the small stuff. And we really make each other laugh.\" (Especially, as you can see, around the holidays.)\n\nAfter dating for seven years, the funny couple tied the knot in fall 2005. In a 2013 interview with More magazine, Melissa said, \"I got hit with the lucky stick with Ben.\"\n\n\"We got hit with the same lucky stick,\" Ben added. \"From the very first time we spoke, we were on the same page. We love each other, respect each other, and try not to sweat the small stuff. And we really make each other laugh.\"\n\nIn January 2007, Melissa confirmed to People that she and her husband were expecting their first child in May. \"We are so excited about the baby,\" she told the publication. \"I’m hoping the baby has a lot of Ben’s calm traits and less of my spazzy ones.\"\n\nOn May 5, Vivian Falcone was born. Now 11, she might not have inherited Melissa's \"spazzy\" traits, but def shares her passion for interior design. \"Ben walked in and Viv and I were trying out a new bedspread I got, and Viv's like (thoughtfully), 'I just think it might compete with the headboard,\" she told Today in 2018. \"...Ben just turned around and went, 'Oh my God, I can't have two of you.'\"\n\n(Fun fact: Melissa's character Sookie St. James' pregnancy was reportedly written into the last season of Gilmore Girls, according to Biography.com.)\n\nGeorgette Falcone was born on March 22, 2010. By this time, Melissa was set to star in the CBS sitcom Mike & Molly. Four months after giving birth, she began filming the show's first season.\n\nNow 8 years old, Georgette is already a little diva, says Melissa. \"Full face of makeup, shirt in, like, a ponytail holder, and, like, a heeled boot,\" she said on The Ellen Show in 2018. \"...She tries to go right down the stairs and out the door, and I'm like, wait, what?\"\n\nSomehow in between writing movie after movie, Ben found time to author a book, Being A Dad Is Weird, about his experiences with his own \"larger-than-life\" dad and as a father to his two daughters with Melissa. Not only did she promote the book on her Instagram (and with a celebratory perm, of course), but Melissa also wrote the book's foreword. Um, serious question—is there anything this adorable couple can't do?!\n\nApparently, the couple who makes movie magic together, stays together. (Sorry, I don't make the rules.) In 2018, Melissa and Ben worked together on their third movie, Life of the Party.\n\n\"It's ridiculous. It's like you get to go to work with your best friend,\" Melissa told E! News at the movie's premiere. \"It's exactly how we met and we became such good friends because we loved doing this together. To get to do it on this kind of scale and still keep telling stories…it's a dream.\"\n\nA few days after her and Ben's 13th wedding anniversary, Melissa spilled all the \"juicy\" details on The Ellen Show. \"We had a very romantic evening at our house…with Richard E. Grant [Melissa's costar in CYEFM], which I thought was kind of lovely,\" she said with a laugh. \"He found out on the way home.\"\n\nMelissa also revealed she got Ben a Jitterbug phone—the, in her words, \"phone for senior citizens\"—for their anniversary, while he got her \"two beautiful rings,\" including one that said \"love\" (awww). \"I have to work on my romance skills, I think,\" Melissa added. Well, there's always next year...\n\nThe couple's latest film together is their first drama. In Can You Ever Forgive Me?, Melissa plays Lee Israel, an out-of-work biographer who (spoiler alert!!) turns to literary letter forging, and Ben plays Alan Schmidt, a collector recruited by the FBI to expose her.\n\nMelissa was nominated for a 2019 Golden Globe in the \"Best Actress in a Motion Picture — Drama\" category, but lost to Glenn Close. She also snagged a 2019 Oscar nom in the \"Best Actress\" category for her performance. (Fingers crossed!!)"
