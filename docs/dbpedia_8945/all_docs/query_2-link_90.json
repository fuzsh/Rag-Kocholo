Upon entering one of his warehouses, Batman was ambushed by Falcone's men and was nearly killed if his future self and Blue Beetle didn't intervene. Their actions, however, remained unnoticed so they wouldn't create a time paradox.

A noted Gotham mobster, during his younger years he was shot with him being brought to the home of Thomas Wayne who removed the bullet from him. Carmine Falcone was a sadistic, uncompromising criminal who rose to power in Gotham City, New York, through the Falcone Crime Syndicate. He amassed many powerful allies in his quest for power, including the cunning gangster known as the Penguin, and Thomas Wayne, a righteous socialite and surgeon who saved Falcone's life one night. He was a ruthless man, and would do anything to accumulate more control and power in Gotham City, even going so far as to strangle Maria Kyle for getting too close to his operation, despite having slept with her and unknowingly fathered her child, Selina Kyle, in 1997. In 2001, Thomas Wayne began running for mayor and founded the Gotham Renewal Corporation, a massive charitable fund with no proper oversight, to fund protects like the Gotham Orphanage. When reporter Edward Elliot began investigating the Wayne family and discovered that Thomas Wayne's wife had a history of mental illness, Thomas went to Falcone and asked him to intimidate Elliot. Falcone instead had Elliot killed, and a distraught Thomas decided to go to the police about it. That night, Thomas and his wife were murdered in front of their son Bruce, possibly by Falcone's hand. After the Waynes' deaths, the crime families of Gotham took control of the Renewal fund and used it for bribes and money laundering. However, Falcone got greedy and, in 2019, orchestrated a drug bust of mobster Salvatore Maroni with politicians Don Mitchell and Gil Colson, and police officer Pete Savage. They told the public the operation was shut down, but in reality they took control of it and used it to have even more control in the city.
