        "text": "Viewers tuning in to “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives” on Friday will enjoy a slice of Boulder as they watch downtown pizza joint Barchetta receive a visit from industry icon Guy Fieri.\n\nFieri’s show takes him on a cross-country road trip highlighting the best classic American restaurants. For Barchetta owner Jesse Jensen, news that Fieri would be checking out his restaurant was a dream come true.\n\n“When we first opened, we always said, ‘How cool would it be if we got Guy Fieri to come out here?’ We would always make jokes about it,” Jensen said. “We’d say, ‘We’re gonna get Guy.’”\n\nStepping inside Barchetta, it’s clear why the restaurant appealed to the “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives” team. The checkerboard floor, the beer wall and booths lining the window all give off what Jensen called “diner vibes.”\n\nThere also are two TV monitors in the main dining area – one plays cartoons, and one displays photos of the restaurant’s former life as an auto mechanic shop. The monitors also have a screen with the definition of “barchetta” – an Italian word meaning “little boat” that doubles as slang for a sports car.\n\n“(Fieri) is very into cars, so he thought that was really cool,” Jensen said.\n\nAt 1644 Walnut St., Barchetta sits just blocks away from the ever-busy Pearl Street Mall. With the building’s spacious patio and nearby houses, Jensen said the pizza place is meant to feel like a neighborhood restaurant.\n\n“I wanted to do something that was a little more casual, a little more fun, and … welcoming of everybody, not just the high-end or the elite,” Jensen said.\n\nJensen, who grew up in Longmont and has lived in Boulder for a decade, launched Barchetta in 2021 after spending years perfecting his pizza-making skills. As owner, he spends most of his time slinging pies in the kitchen alongside the other chefs.\n\n“A few years ago, I was getting a little burnt out of the industry,” Jensen explained. “I ultimately realized that I do love doing this, and I have a lot of fun doing it.”\n\nFieri stopped by Barchetta – as well as fellow Boulder restaurant Bohemian Biergarten – in October, so Jensen had to keep news of his visit under wraps for several months. This past week, however, Jensen has been able to promote the episode to customers, and he’s planning to host a watch party at the restaurant Friday night.\n\n“I’m excited to share Barchetta with even more of the world,” Jensen said.\n\nDuring filming, Jensen gave Fieri a taste of Barchetta’s cheeseburger pizza as well as the restaurant’s “Verde Verde” pizza, which is topped with green chiles and salsa verde.\n\nJensen said Fieri praised the pizza crust, which Barchetta always pays special attention to.\n\n“He’s really down-to-earth,” Jensen said of Fieri. “I feel like he’s very genuine. It was awesome to meet somebody that I’ve looked up to for so long.”\n\nTed Reinhart, Barchetta’s general manager, is also a longtime Fieri fan. He said it felt good to know that out of all the restaurants in the United States, Barchetta was considered a worthy pick.\n\n“It was really nice to be a restaurant in a really cool city and represent that,” Reinhart said.\n\nBarchetta’s “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives” episode will air at 7 p.m. Friday on the Food Network."
