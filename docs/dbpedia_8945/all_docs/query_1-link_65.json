These upgrades, completed over the last 10 months, included updating outdoor furnishings, a brand-new fitness center and brand-new clubhouse with ample community and study space for residents.\n\nWhen asked about his outlook on the project, Jon Fahning, Director of Development said “The project came with a series of challenges – weather, unforeseen conditions with the buildings discovered during the work, and schedule just to name a few. The construction team rose to the challenge and truly presented the partnership we strive for on all our projects. The on-site team was awesome in working closely with us to deliver the project to Tailwind’s expectations and standards. Great job by all!”\n\nIn addition to the renovation project, Tailwind Group’s marketing team, in partnership with the operational team, began the process of rebranding the property to one of Tailwind Group’s newer core brands, Altitude.\n\n“Altitude is a newer brand for us that we introduced in May of 2023, with the acquisition and rebrand in Wichita, KS. The brand was intended to be used moving forward for future mid-rise and high-rise acquisitions. The tagline ‘Elevate your living,’ can certainly be attributed to the style of property but is definitely meant to signify the elevated living experience a student would have if they chose to live with us. We love this brand and were excited to bring it to Baton Rouge.” – Devan Schaly-Brumbaugh, Director of Leasing and Marketing\n\nAs discussed on the pilot episode of the Tailwind Talks podcast, for Tailwind Group a rebrand is more than just swapping out signage and brochures. Tailwind Group’s marketing team works meticulously for months to craft a campaign that excites the local community about the name change. This campaign culminates in a launch party that takes place onsite and is open to residents, prospective residents, and members of the community. Altitude Baton Rouge’s rebrand party attracted over 130 attendees and featured limited edition t-shirts, a crawfish boil, and giveaways such as a Nintendo Switch.\n\nWhen asked about the launch, Nicky Tyus, Property Manager, said “The team brought the energy and the residents and other attendees responded with tons of excitement regarding the renovations and name change. I was overjoyed to see the residents and staff having such a good time. I’m extremely proud of our team and the efforts made to ensure the event, unveiling of the property renovations and name change were a success!”\n\nTailwind Group is a top-20 owner and manager of off-campus student housing in the country, with 33 different communities comprising nearly 15,000 bedrooms in their portfolio.
