        "text": "Nevio Falcone (born May 15, 2027) is a main character in the Sins of the Fathers and a minor character in the Camorra Chronicles and in the Born in Blood Mafia Chronicles. He is the son of Remo and Serafina Falcone, the twin brother of Greta and the older brother to Giulio. He is the father of Battista Falcone, whom he fathered with an unnamed woman. He is also Aurora Scuderi's fiancé.\n\nPhysical Description[]\n\nPhysically he is a copy of Remo, as they share many facial similarities including dark hair and pitch black eyes. Nevio is tall and muscular due to his training in both fighting and parkour.[1]\n\nWhen he was a baby, his aunt, Kiara Falcone, described him and Greta as the most beautiful babies she had ever seen. His maternal aunt Sofia Mancini described them as tiny and adorable with chubby cheeks.\n\nPersonality[]\n\n“ That guy had the destruction force of an atom bomb. Remo was a fucking madman. Nevio made his father look like a fucking choir boy. ”\n\nHe was a hyperactive and rebellious kid, that often defied the grown-ups' orders and only obeyed Remo's commands. He is used to cage training from an early age with his father, Remo, to control his outbursts and hyperactivity. Sofia calls Nevio a little daredevil in a conversation with Serafina.\n\nNevio can be extremely out of control and has a passion for killing and brutality. However, in his darkness he has a soft spot for the people in love. It is seen in Fate I Conquer he kills his first man at twelve meaning that he is out of control and desires killing.\n\nNevio is good at reading people; even if he doesn't particularly care about their emotions, he files away his observations in case he needs them.\n\nOther people’s lives meant nothing to him. Very few people mattered to Nevio, but these select few were his whole world, and he would do anything to protect them, and to keep them close. He would stop at nothing.\n\n“ For him love was difficult to grasp. For him devotion and love only existed in connection with our family, not outside of it. Everyone outside of our family was inconsequential to him. He was a bit like a livestock guardian dog. The puppies were introduced early to their herd or family they were supposed to protect. Everything they grew up with fell under their protection, everything that they encountered later in life was a potential threat. ”\n\nHe shares a deep connection with his twin sister, Greta, to whom he is very close. According to his mother, Serafina, he is very attentive and protective towards Greta. His uncle, Savio Falcone, once described him and Greta as Yin and Yang. In a Newsletter, it is said by Remo that he and Greta are co-dependent.[2]\n\nHe's also really close with his cousins Alessio and Massimo Falcone, with whom he has a sibling relationship and grew up with.\n\nBorn in Blood[]\n\nBound by the Past[]\n\nGreta and Nevio's birth is presented from the Outfit's POV. After their birth, their grandmother Ines wishes they were never born. The Miones and the Cavallaros look down upon the twins. Samuel and Pietro cannot stand looking at him as he is his father's spitting image.\n\nCamorra Chronicles[]\n\nTwisted Pride[]\n\nSavio Falcone is the first man to lift Nevio in his arms on the night of Fina's escapade. Nevio gets used to the Falcones fastly. His mother Serafina describes him to be a little wrestler as he always snatches the baby bottle, the cutlery, the food, and even Remo's finger when they meet for the first time. Nevio is fascinated with his uncle Nino Falcone's tattoos. At the end of the book, Nevio has already made his first steps. On the twins' first birthday, which is also their first swimming in the pool in the Falcone mansion, Nevio calls Remo dad for the first time.\n\nTwisted Bonds[]\n\nNino concludes in front of Kiara that Nevio is a fatal combination of Remo, Savio and Adamo Falcone because of his boisterous nature. Savio has started calling him PIA and suggests that they soon will have to put Nevio on a leash. Nevio has the habit to paint his body as well as that of his sister with a permanent marker, calling the drawings dattoos. Nevio and Savio have an interesting relationship. They constantly tease each other. Savio even calls him 'little killer doll', stating his nephew has a maniac face.\n\nTwisted Hearts[]\n\nWhen Gemma Falcone visits the Falcone mansion for the first time Nevio has a dispute about God's existence and prays. He states in front of Gemma that his father is the one to pay for the food, not God. He stops the tirade only when Greta put her tiny hand over his.\n\nNevio is shown to be a hyperactive kid; climbing on a bar in the mansion and running around.\n\nHe is a bridesman at Gemma and Savio's wedding.\n\nOn the next day, Nevio plays with his cousins Alessio Falcone and Massimo Falcone and jumps in the pool. It's stated he can already swim.\n\nNevio teases Savio on a regular basis: he jumps on his car roof, jumps in the pool, and splashes water while Gemma and Savio sunbathe.\n\nTwisted Cravings[]\n\nNevio has started to cage fight with Remo in order to control his outbursts.\n\nOn his seventh birthday, he asks his uncle Adamo Falcone to fight with him but the latter declines the offer claiming Serafina won't approve. Nevio has a sword fight with sticks with his cousins and stops playing only when Remo tells him.\n\nOn Christmas Eve Nevio meets Adamo and Dinara Mikhailov in the foyer of the Falcone mansion and asks for presents.\n\nSins of the Fathers[]\n\nBy Fate I Conquer[]\n\nDuring his 12th birthday, his father, Remo Falcone, along with Fabiano and Nino, bring Nevio a man to torture as a gift, while Greta watches the events. Nevio shares a deep bond with his twin sister, Greta. Everyone describes her as the person who holds his last light, and if she leaves, he will lose the only light left in him. He is part of The Unholy Trinity. Every evening, they go out and indulge in their dark urges for blood. Nevio also helps his mother take control of his little brother, Giulio Falcone. He harbors a strong hatred for Amo Vitiello and does not want Greta to be close to him. Eventually, when a relationship develops between Amo and Greta, Greta decides to tell Nevio who feels betrayed and calls her a traitor. When Greta is attacked, Nevio flies all the way to New York and kills Cressida Antonaci.\n\nThree months later, as Greta is married and living in New York with Amo, Nevio hurts Aurora Scuderi for some unknown reason, causing her to seek shelter in New York with Greta.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nBound by the Past\n\nTwisted Pride\n\nRemo and Serafina's Valentine's Day Special (mentioned only)\n\nTwisted Bonds\n\nTwisted Hearts\n\nTwisted Cravings\n\nFragile Longing\n\nBy Fate I Conquer\n\nBy Frenzy I Ruin (protagonist)\n\nGallery[]\n\nFrom Cora's Pinterest board[]\n\nBook Covers[]"
