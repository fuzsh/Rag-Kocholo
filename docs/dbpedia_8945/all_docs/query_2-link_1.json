In order to gain more power, Falcone arranged the arrest of his rival, Salvatore Maroni, while blackmailing high level politicians and businessmen across Gotham. Eventually, Falcone's crimes made him an enemy of Batman and Catwoman, who managed to expose his corruption and involvement in the murder of Annika Kosolov. However, before Falcone could be arrested by Jim Gordon, he was shot by Riddler, resulting in Falcone dying in the streets, and leaving a power struggle to be fought for Gotham's underworld.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Life\n\nSaved by Thomas Wayne\n\n\"I got shot in the chest... I couldn't go to the hospital so we showed up on his doorstep, operated right on the dining room table, kid here saw the whole thing up on the stairs looking down.\"\n\n―Carmine Falcone to Penguin.\n\nCarmine Falcone, an Italian-American criminal, soon rose up to become one of Gotham’s most famous crime lords through founding his own crime family. He later formed a rivalry with fellow Italian crime lord Salvatore Maroni, head of the Maroni crime family, as well as the main culprit of Gotham's drops trade.[3]\n\nAt some point, Falcone married a woman, and together they had two children, a son named Alberto, and a daughter named Sofia. Alberto later became a capo in his crime family, while Sofia was looked down upon by others due to her mental health.\n\nOne night, Falcone got shot in the chest and couldn't go to the hospital, so he showed up at the Wayne Manor doorstep and asked Thomas Wayne to save his life. Thomas decided to operate on Falcone on his dining room table and saved his life. Unknown to Thomas, his son Bruce watched the whole thing from his stairwell, but Falcone noticed him.[4]\n\nAfter the shooting, Falcone began secluding himself from the public eye, to the point that the news could only use photos of him when he was younger. [5]\n\nLater, despite being married, Falcone began a relationship with Maria Kyle, who worked as a waitress at the 44 Below and gave birth to their illegitimate daughter, Selina Kyle. However, when Selina turned seven, Falcone murdered Maria and successfully covered up his crime and didn't intervene when Selina was taken into social services.\n\nAssisting An Ally\n\nThomas came back to him when Edward Elliot had dug up terrible things about the Arkham Family, particularly on his wife Martha's history with mental illness. Thomas asked Falcone to put \"the fear of god\" into the reporter, and Falcone agreed to do so. When Falcone tried to use intimidation to stop the reporter from publishing the story, the reporter refused, and Falcone ended up killing him.[4]\n\nNew Empire\n\nAfter the death of Thomas, the Gotham Renewal Corporation was left to the city for carrying out the Wayne's legacy of rebuilding the city and helping those in need. However, corrupt politicians and the criminal underworld saw the program to be the perfect opportunity to exploit the unlimited money with no oversight by the governmental body. Everyone wanted the renewal program for themselves to fund their illegal activities where everyone would get some of the money, but Carmine wanted more than just the money; he wanted everything, so he orchestrated the arrest of Sal Maroni, using mayor Don Mitchell, Jr. and several other corrupt politicians and police officers as his puppets, taking control of the Renewal and using it to turn Gotham into his own personal empire for twenty years, resulting in Gotham's crime rates and drugs rising. He also took control of Maroni's drops operation, and put his new up-and-coming capo Oz Cobblepot in charge of managing it.\n\nRiddler Investigation\n\nDeath of the Mayor\n\nOn Halloween night, Don Mitchell, Jr. was killed in his home by the Riddler, a mysterious serial killer that knew the truth about Falcone's exploits, and planned on exposing him through killing his political puppets.\n\nMurder of Annika Kosolov\n\nBefore Mitchell died, he told Annika Kosolov, a female employee from the Iceberg Lounge that Falcone was the rat. When falcone learned of this, he assigned William Kenzie to kidnap her, and interrogated her to see what Mitchell told her. Afterwards, she was brutally strangled to death by him.\n\nMayor Mitchell's Funeral\n\nFalcone attended Mitchell's funeral along with Carla Diaz and Penguin. Outside Gotham City Hall, Falcone bumped into Bruce and was surprised he was out in the public and went on to tell him the story of how his father saved his life.\n\nQuestioned by Bruce Wayne\n\nAfter Riddler exposed the dark secrets about the Wayne Family, and how Thomas Wayne asked Falcone to threaten a reporter who was digging up dirt about his wife whom was ultimately killed. Bruce Wayne, learning the new revelation reached the Iceberg Lounge to question Falcone. He revealed to the young, disturbed man that his father told him to instill fear into the reporter, but when fear did not work, he killed him instead. He also told Bruce that it may have been Salvatore Maroni who had his father killed, since he had a grudge against the relationship Falcone had with Thomas.\n\nAttacked by Selina Kyle\n\nSelina Kyle infiltrated the Iceberg Lounge to talk to Falcone, and when she arrived, attempted to kill him. Falcone was able to run away in time, but Selina gave chase, while Falcone told Selina not to do it. Eventually, Falcone was able to get Selina down, and tried to strangle her with a pool cue the same way he killed Annika Kosolov, but was stopped by Batman and arrested.\n\nCapture and Assassination\n\n\"You with Zorro over here? Don't you know, you boys in blue work for me?\"\n\n\"I guess we don't all work for you.\"\n\n―Carmine Falcone and Jim Gordon\n\nFalcone was then taken away by Batman, who handed him over to Jim Gordon, with Falcone chuckling at the idea of Gordon and Batman working together. When Falcone noted that the Gotham City Police Department actually worked for him, Gordon opened the doors and revealed the rest of the GCPD, who were waiting outside, although Falcone still remained confident he was going to be able to get out of it.\n\nWhile Gordon read Falcone his rights, and Martinez put him in handcuffs, Penguin then came out of the club and called Falcone a rat, telling him he probably won’t survive his first night in Blackgate. However, Falcone simply responded by mocking Penguin, calling him a gimp in an empty suit.\n\nIn response, Penguin pulled out a gun, as Batman knocked Falcone to the floor while Penguin was grappled by several police officers. However, in the confusion, Falcone had been shot, with Penguin insisting that he had not fire his weapon. Batman realized that he had brought the rat into the light and that Riddler had sniped Falcone from across the street, as Selina Kyle walked over and looked at her father dying in the street.\n\nPersonality\n\n\"You know why communism failed, right?\"\n\n\"No, boss.\"\n\n\"Austerity.\"\n\n―Carmine Falcone and Briscoe\n\nCarmine Falcone has a personality of the typical classical crime lord. He is highly intelligent, cunning, devious, egomaniacal, manipulative, ruthless, and utterly disturbing to the core. During his reign as Gotham City's biggest crime lord, he was shown as posh, elegant, luxurious and old-fashioned, even stating that communism failed due to the idea of austerism. Falcone was also a very charismatic individual and can easily make people trust him. His closest associates seem to respect him very much.\n\nFalcone is a power-hungry man. He was willing to steal everything that benefits himself, and exploited corrupt officials who can get him what he wants and everything he needs to ensure that he stays in power for a long time. Carmine also seems to have a particularly nasty preference for strangling women who have personally displeased him, as it is how he killed both Selina Kyle's mother and Annika Kosolov in the past, and is also how he attempted to kill Kyle herself when she tried to assassinate him.\n\nDespite his evil, Falcone is capable of putting on an affable, friendly façade. Not hiding that he is a bad man, but being able to give the impression of being an \"honorable\" type of criminal. He was able to gain the respect and even trust of Thomas Wayne, despite Thomas being a noble man attempting to make a better Gotham, but once he found an opportunity to get dirt on Thomas he took it, having the reporter Thomas asked him to scare killed to blackmail him, and possibly had Thomas killed. In the present day, he acts friendly to Bruce Wayne, and tells him over how he had a mutual respect with Bruce's father, despite having blackmailed said father, and later convincing Bruce that Thomas deliberately asked him to kill the reporter. Falcone is also hedonist and womanizer, usually seen accompanied with beautiful young women.\n\nAbilities\n\n\"You think this goddamn election matters? Falcone's the mayor. He's been the mayor for the last 20 years.\"\n\n―William Kenzie\n\nGifted Intelligence: Falcone was the criminal head of Gotham City's underworld and head of the Falcone Crime Syndicate, as well as as the secret boss of politicians, District Attorneys, and even police officers who were all stealing money from the unsupervised Wayne Renewal Fund. He was smart enough to use the opportunity to rat out rival crime boss Salvatore Maroni and steal his drug business in order to set himself up as the undisputed king of Gotham, simultaneously advancing the careers of those who brought him in and installing them as his inside men in the police department. He made Don Mitchell, Jr. take Annika Kosolov's passport so he could find out what the former told her. According to William Kenzie, the outcome of the 2021 mayoral election was irrelevant, as Falcone was practically the mayor for the last two decades.\n\n\"Your father should have known that Falcone would do anything to finally have something on him that he could use. That's who Falcone is.\"\n\n―Alfred Pennyworth to Bruce Wayne\n\nIntimidation: Falcone practically owned Gotham City, controlling everyone through blackmail and fear.\n\nEquipment\n\n\"Why shouldn't I take this cue stick and play a dozen games of Nine Ball on your thick head?\"\n\n―Carmine Falcone to Piggy Porcello\n\nPool Cue:\n\nFacilities\n\nShoreline Lofts: To be added\n\nIceberg Lounge: To be added\n\n44 Below: To be added\n\nRelationships\n\nFamily\n\nWife\n\nSofia Falcone - Daughter\n\nAlberto Falcone - Son\n\nSelina Kyle - Daughter, Attempted Killer, and Attempted Victim\n\nLuca Falcone\n\nIsabella Falcone †\n\nAllies\n\nFalcone Crime Syndicate - Subordinates\n\nPiggy Porcello\n\nVinnie\n\nBriscoe\n\nWilliam Kenzie\n\nGotham Renewal Corporation\n\nDon Mitchell Jr. †\n\nPete Savage †\n\nKeith Bergman\n\nCollin Becker\n\nPatrick Svendsven\n\nGil Colson †\n\nGlen Keller\n\nTravis Cromwell\n\nRitchie Beckett\n\nCarla Diaz\n\nCheri\n\nEnemies\n\nMaroni Crime Family\n\nSalvatore Maroni - Rival and Predecessor\n\nMaria Kyle † - Former Lover and Victim\n\nGotham City Police Department - Former Allies\n\nJanice Dure\n\nJames Gordon\n\nMartinez\n\nThomas Wayne † - Savior\n\nMartha Wayne †\n\nBruce Wayne\n\nEdward Elliot † - Victim\n\nAnnika Kosolov † - Victim\n\nBatman\n\nOswald Cobblepot/Penguin - Former Subordinate and Attempted Killer\n\nThe Twins - Former Subordinates\n\nRiddler - Killer\n\nTrivia\n\nIt's heavily implied that Falcone was involved with the murder of Thomas and Martha Wayne, but the exact circumstances remain unknown. Falcone taunts Batman that whatever dirty secrets he may have, it's all going with him to his grave. And then the Riddler kills Falcone, ensuring Batman will never find out the truth behind his parents' deaths.\n\nAccording to The Batman: The Official Script Book, Falcone was in his sixties before he was killed. This places his date of birth between 1952 and 1961. The Penguin confirms he was born in 1957, and died at age 65.\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nIn DC Comics, Carmine \"The Roman\" Falcone was one of the great crime lords of Gotham City and was one of the earliest enemies of the Batman. His nickname comes from the ruthless way he established his criminal empire, which, coincidentally, is referred as the Roman Empire. In addition to his extended crime family, his successors include his children Alberto Falcone, Mario Falcone, and Sofia Gigante-Falcone. He was later killed by Two-Face in The Long Halloween story.\n\nCarmine Falcone in The Batman Universe will be the third live-action incarnation of the character following incarnations portrayed by Tom Wilkinson and John Doman.\n\nMatt Reeves has named Roman Polanski's Chinatown as an influence on The Batman.[6] Carmine Falcone is very similar to that movie's villain, Noah Cross, as he secretly controls Gotham City through massive corruption (as Cross controls Los Angeles) and is implied to have an incestuous desire for his daughter.\n\nThe slash scars which Selina gives Carmine are a reference to his appearance in the comics. In the comics, Selina gave him these scars during Batman: Year One (1987), and he bore them for the entirety of Batman: The Long Halloween (1996-1997). The scars are inspired by the scars of historic mobster Al \"Scarface\" Capone, who received them from a bottle-opener.\n\nThe scene in-which Carmine describes a young Bruce Wayne watching his father give Carmine surgery in the family-home is an allusion to a back-flash scene of this occurring in Batman: The Long Halloween.\n\nReferences"
