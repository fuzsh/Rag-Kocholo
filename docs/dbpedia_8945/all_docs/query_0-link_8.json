        "text": "David Falcone creates acoustic guitar atmosphere By David W. Wannop Ticket to Music (Montgomery Newspapers) August 19, 1998\n\nFew people in the local music scene get as much pleasure out of playing live as David Falcone. Maybe it's because he started on the circuit later than most. His kind, honest, wise demeanor permits him to enjoy the audience as much as they appreciate him. Upcoming shows include La Tazza d'Art in Manayunk Aug 23, and Paoli's Doghouse Cafe Sept. 5.\n\nDuring our interview at Keswick Coffee in Glenside, Falcone told me of his early training. \"I had lessons at 6 or 7 years old. At the end of five weeks, the teacher thought my brother was more serious about guitar lessons, and I was told not to continue. They didn't think I was ready. I did not pick it up again until the end of high school, and I never took lessons again.\" Flunking childhood guitar instruction did not permanently deter Falcone. He reflected on the journey that took him from his hometown to college, and ultimately back to music.\n\n\"I was born in Steelton, PA., outside of Harrisburg. I was there for 18 years. I wanted to go to college, and went away in 1968 to Dayton College in Dayton, Ohio. I started in computer science but switched to psychology and I played some college baseball. During some summer session there I started to play music at picnics. I got a lot of playing in at state parks. Friends of mine would tell me to keep playing as they hooked up with girls. Because I was busy playing music, I never got the girl. That was the summer of '68'. In college I never had a paid gig.\"\n\nFor several years thereafter, Falcone only played lullabies for his children while putting them to bed. Falcone says that it influenced his smooth guitar style, but the real development did not happen until much later. It was about four years ago when a friend's wife asked Falcone to play at a party for her husband, who is a writer. She figured that a musical interlude would make the readings more enjoyable. She was among the few who even knew Falcone played at the time. \"I got an encore, and I realized I had forgotten what that felt like. Now I play out five or six times a month.\"\n\nHe describes the relationship between his work in the Psychology Department at La Salle and his music. \"Working at La Salle is nice because university people appreciate my music. My first paid performance was at La Tazza d'Arte, where I was kind of a novelty. The place was packed with people from La Salle.\"\n\nEven Falcone has difficulty explaining his sound. \"My style is very Leo Kottke and John Fahey influenced. At first I only played instrumentals. The Celtic tradition is strong. John Renbourn is one person I emulate from Celtic music. I am Italian, but I got interested in a girl from Iceland when I was very young, about sixth grade, and became fascinated with that part of the world. During graduate school I became interested in jigs and reels. County Clare Records is my label and 'The Road to County Clare' is a song of mine.\"\n\nFalcone can sell five or six copies of his independent release, \"Secrets of Sherwood,\" when the audience numbers 30 or so. The album is headed for a second pressing and consists of mostly original material done as instrumentals. \"After shows and on the listserv I use, people were telling me to sing. The final nail in the coffin was when I was to be played on WXPN and I called home to make sure my family heard it. Even my mom said that they were waiting for me to sing. Now I sing Chris Smither, Richard Thompson, and extremely rare songs by Bob Dylan. However, I do play Dylan's 'Don't Think Twice' and 'My Back Pages,' which are commonly heard. The other 70 percent of the show is my own compositions.\"\n\nIt might surprise you that Falcone, who rarely sings, has a philosophy about writing lyrics. \"Everybody should carry a notebook so that they can write down great lines. Then build on the web of ideas. My aunt sent me an article about Dylan playing for the Pope. It fit with a line I wrote - 'bless me father for I have been' - which did not have a home yet. The specialness in creating lyrics is just being open to it. Write down your ideas and it will happen.\"\n\nFalcone has had time for his vocal music to catch up with his instrumentals. The nationally syndicated program \"Echoes,\" and \"Sleepy Hollow\" both carried by WXPN, have played Falcone's music. He plans to stay in that acoustic finger style guitar realm that is not quite folk and not quite new age."
