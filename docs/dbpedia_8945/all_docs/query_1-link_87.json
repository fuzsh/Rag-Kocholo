        "text": "Just because you’re the fastest animal on earth doesn’t mean you can outrun extinction.\n\nIn the 1970s, peregrine falcons had a very real chance of disappearing from our skies. Along with bald eagles and other raptors, peregrines had been pushed to the brink through the widespread use of DDT, an insecticide that made their eggshells so weak that they often shattered in the nest. The peregrine had been one of the most common raptors in the United States, but by the mid-60s, only 39 known breeding pairs were left — and just two of those were in California.\n\nFortunately, a group of UC researchers banded together to protect this fragile bird population and help it recover. Today, peregrine falcons have rebounded even beyond their historic numbers, and now thrive across the state — including at UC.\n\nThe making of a YouTube star\n\nOn the UC Berkeley campus, spring heralds thousands of students preparing to graduate and move on to the next chapter of their lives. Overlooking it all, perched on the 307-foot Campanile, is Annie the peregrine falcon, preparing to welcome her new family (now two three FOUR chicks, a first for her — click to learn more about how she will raise this new brood!).\n\nSeeing Annie soaring above the most iconic spot on campus may be something Berkeley residents take for granted these days, but ornithologist Lynn Schofield remembers exactly when she realized Annie had arrived on the scene: January 11, 2017. That’s the day Schofield first heard the signature peregrine call and left her work for the Institute for Bird Populations to follow it.\n\n“I’m the kind of person who has bird lists from 2017,” she says, laughing. “I’m also the kind of person who sees a peregrine falcon and puts away my work and goes to see what they’re up to. Aren’t you like that?”\n\nThe birds she spotted were a breeding pair who eventually came to be known as Annie and Grinnell. By March, when it seemed likely they were calling the Campanile home, a small group of bird experts keenly interested in the new arrivals went up to investigate the territory and its suitability for nesting. Among the experts were Lynn and her husband Sean Peterson, who was pursuing a Ph.D. at UC Berkeley in environmental science, policy and management at the time.\n\n“It’s a really wild journey to get to the top of the Campanile,” Peterson says. “You have to open this secret door in the wall and then climb up inside this pillar, taking your backpack off and pushing it in front of you. But we got up to the top, and looked through these slats where you could see through to the outside.”\n\n“We could see Annie looking straight back at us. And it was just so cool to have that moment of, ‘oh, yep, there she is. She's gotta be on a nest.’”\n\nAnnie had made history as the first recorded nesting peregrine on campus, but her new home left a little to be desired. Schofield and Peterson found two eggs precariously perched in an open sandbag on a slanted roof. Two other eggs had already rolled away. Without the sandbags — a relic of an old art installation — it’s unlikely the falcons would have ever chosen the Campanile as their nest, but Schofield and Peterson knew they would have limited breeding success without some slight changes. The group helped out the young couple by placing a nest box on an even surface instead.\n\nAnnie and Grinnell had their first two chicks, Fiat and Lux, in May of 2017. Fiat survived and left the nest, but Lux tragically died after hitting a window. (UC Berkeley now has bird-proofed many of its campus windows with a number of almost invisible — to humans — adjustments). Peregrines elsewhere in the country often migrate, but the Bay Area is hospitable to the birds year-round. After Annie and Grinnell had another successful clutch in 2018, with all three chicks flying off to establish their own territories, a small group of researchers including Schofield and Peterson had the idea to install webcams to bring the birds closer to the campus community. After a crowdfunding campaign, the first two webcams were installed.\n\nSchofield and Peterson thought the webcams would be popular among the UC Berkeley community. They did not anticipate Annie and Grinnell would have viewers tuning in from all over the world to watch live feeds of falcon behavior, or that thousands of people would share curated clips over social media. (A clip of Annie feeding her first chick in 2023 earned 127,000 views). Engaging with the falcons’ fans has become an ongoing labor of love for Schofield and Peterson, who answer questions on Twitter and Instagram, and run meme and chick-naming contests (all the names must have a UC Berkeley tie, of course) each spring.\n\nIt’s been an impressive display of science communication that now goes both ways, as viewers often tip the pair, currently based in Minnesota, to interesting behaviors, potential threats, or tragedies, like when Annie’s mate Grinnell went missing, later found to have been hit by a car. It’s a reminder that these animals, which are only a screen away, live a wild life, with hazards from both the natural and man-made worlds.\n\nLife for peregrines is always precarious — but 50 years ago, it was nearly impossible.\n\nAt the brink\n\nToday, Zeka Glucs, a UC Davis alum and director of the UC Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group, is one of a handful of people who knows what it feels like to be dive-bombed by the fastest animal on earth … while dangling from a rope.\n\n“This male at this one site was just hitting me repeatedly in the back the whole time I was banding the young in the nest,” Glucs laughs. “And … it hurt, and that was not fun! Those are probably the worst for me but it’s just an indicator that I have to do this faster.”\n\nGlucs spends a significant amount of time banding baby birds around California, but when the UC Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group first started there were virtually no young to band. In 1975, peregrine falcon numbers were so low that the group’s sole mission was to reintroduce falcons to the wild in the hopes that they would survive.\n\nScientists first noticed the sharp decline of birds, especially raptors, in the late 1950s. A Peregrine Conference in 1965 brought together scientists and falconers to share their surveys of precipitously falling bird populations and theories on the culprit; a bevy of research pointed at DDT. DDT, or dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, becomes more devastating as it goes up the food chain — birds that prey on other birds, like peregrine falcons, were absorbing extremely high concentrations of the widely-used insecticide, with devastating consequences for reproduction.\n\nAt their lowest point, there were only two breeding pairs of peregrines left in California. A second Peregrine Conference in 1969 asked the governments of Canada, Mexico and the United States to protect the birds before they vanished completely. In 1972, the newly formed Environmental Protection Agency banned DDT, and a year later, the peregrines were listed as an endangered species under the newly-minted Endangered Species Act.\n\nWhile the relief was necessary and welcome, the problem was that there weren’t enough peregrines to recover.\n\nConservationists rallied to the peregrine’s cause. Ornithologist and UCLA alum Tom Cade founded the Peregrine Fund in 1970 in an attempt to breed them in captivity and release them into the wild. Its success was no sure thing — only a few falconers in recorded history had been able to breed them in the United States, and some of those records were disputed. Cade started his efforts in the Northeast, but the birds were virtually wiped out everywhere, so no one team could do the job. The UC Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group was formed in 1975 to do that work in the West.\n\nEarly on, falcon scientists noticed that peregrines had evolved a mechanism that could help with the recovery process.\n\n“Peregrine falcons do something really cool called double or even triple-clutching,” Glucs explains. “So if you remove eggs early enough in the breeding season, they're going to go ahead and lay a replacement clutch of eggs. Our group took advantage of that by removing those eggs, artificially incubating them, and then having them lay another clutch of eggs so we could get double the reproductive value from that pair. We only had a few pairs left to work with, so it was really important to create a high quantity of chicks.”\n\nUC Santa Cruz became a peregrine egg factory, incubating and hatching, incubating and hatching on campus. It also became a study in nature versus nurture in animal behavior. Some chicks were fostered by peregrines or prairie falcons. But others, given the lack of parents to go around, were raised in nests where they were fed by peregrine puppets. Eventually, once they grew big enough to hunt on their own, scientists moved them to release sites, and the birds learned to fly and hunt by themselves. “That was very successful,” Glucs adds. “Obviously there’s a huge genetic component to learning how to be a wild peregrine.”\n\nPeregrines were delisted from the federal and state endangered species lists in 2006, after their rebound found them dispersing across the country, often to places they’d never been seen nesting before — urban environments. As it turns out, California’s long, populous coast is perfect for them.\n\n“We started to see them showing up on bridges, on buildings, in abandoned nests, on electrical towers, any structure that was over 60 feet tall that had a good view of some foraging territory in the Bay Area. We've got all the shoreline peregrines love, shorebirds and waterfowl to hunt, so they love these artificial cliff landscapes that are near the sea. They almost immediately took to those sites and have become sort of an urban predator in our region.”\n\nIt also gives them an amazing stage on which to be superstars.\n\nInvested in the future\n\nWatching the bay from Annie’s perch atop the Campanile is a stunning sight — miles of shoreline, impressive sunsets, fog rolling in. It’s hard not to think Annie is a lucky bird — and in many ways, she is.\n\nThe Campanile checks all the boxes for a peregrine, Schofield notes, especially now that Annie has a stabilized nest. On a clear day, you can sometimes see more falcons flying by, checking out the territory. And Annie’s closely watched life yields all sorts of interesting data that would otherwise be impossible to pick up, like the minutiae of incubation and diet. Perhaps more grippingly for the average viewer, her love life has also been on full display.\n\nBefore Grinnell was hit by a car in 2022, Annie and her longtime mate were Berkeley’s favorite couple; when Grinnell was struck, both the campus and the town mourned alongside Annie, as did viewers in places as distant as London and Australia, who had tuned into the feed for comfort during the pandemic. But in another promising sign of falcon recovery, viewers watched as Alden swooped in to help care for Annie’s eggs within a day. Sadly, Annie’s mates since Grinnell have only lasted one chick-raising cycle each. Alden and subsequently Lou — both attentive fathers — eventually disappeared from the Campanile for reasons unknown, although their latest threat, bird flu, is a possibility. This winter, viewers overheard Annie chatting offscreen with a new mate, Archie, who moved in shortly after. Annie’s continued success and 20 chicks, so far, are the mark of a well-lived falcon life. Her followers are lucky, too.\n\n“I think people really crave being able to interact with nature. To see that kind of natural world and have that be right in the backyard of one of the biggest universities in the country, in one of the biggest metropolitan areas in the country, is amazing,” Peterson says. “You know, I can look up and see the world's fastest animal. How cool is that? That's just awesome to have in your backyard.”\n\nJoining Annie and Archie are their chicks, two of which hatched yesterday, April 22. The UC Berkeley campus will be celebrating their arrival (and hopefully, that of their siblings) with Hatch Day, an all-day party at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, featuring a live feed of the nest projected on a giant outdoor screen along with falcon experts, a live raptor visit and free stickers for visitors.\n\nLearn more by visiting the BAMPFA website and find out how you can help birds out with some easy bird-proofing techniques for your windows from Cornell Lab.\n\nWhile the all-day campus celebration Hatch Day is happening at BAMPFA on the UC Berkeley campus on Wednesday, April 24, two chicks have already started the party, emerging from their shells on Earth Day, April 22. Another joined on April 23 and finally, on Hatch Day, the fourth and final chick began emerging from its shell — a first for Annie, who has never hatched all four eggs before. You can check out their progress on the livestream below.\n\nWe asked Cal Falcons’ Sean Peterson what to expect from the first few days of falcon life.\n\nQ: Two chicks hatching is a great Earth Day treat! Are you surprised they came early, and is that any cause for concern?\n\nNot super surprised. Based on Annie’s previous broods, the average expected hatch would have been just after midnight April 23, so within 24 hours of that is pretty much spot on. We scheduled the Hatch Day party a little later because we wanted to be sure there were chicks to see!\n\nQ: What does a chick’s first 48-72 hours look like? What are the most important things that have to happen? What should viewers look for?\n\nSo, each chick can survive 12-24 hours no problem without food (they’re still “full” from absorbing the yolk and other nutrients in the egg). But, we usually see Annie feed them for the first time ~6 hours after hatch. Annie has historically been very hesitant to let any of her mates do much of the feeding, so we expect her to be doing the vast majority (probably all) of the feeding again. [Ed. note: Watch their first meal.]\n\nChicks won’t be able to keep themselves warm until they’re about 10 days old, so they won’t be left alone very long to start out. Expect to see a lot of the parents sitting on the chicks with brief feeding breaks every few hours.\n\nHatching in peregrine falcons is “synchronized,” so all the eggs that hatch typically hatch within a 48 hour window. We’re already seeing signs of Egg 3 pipping, so that one might be later this evening. Annie has never hatched all four eggs before, but we’ve got our fingers crossed! [Ed. note: Egg 3s and 4 have hatched!]\n\nQ: Who will do the hunting?\n\nArchie is doing all the hunting now. He often stashes food around the tower so Annie can grab something from the “larder” whenever the chicks are hungry.\n\nQ: Do you expect the other two to hatch?\n\nThe third egg is pipping very heavily, so will likely hatch (although it’s never a guarantee — we’ve had pipping eggs fail before). The fourth is a total question mark. We haven’t seen a pip yet, but it’s hard to see anything in that squirming pile of fluff. [Ed. note: Eggs 3 and 4 have hatched!]\n\n[Editor’s note: These chicks are keeping us almost as busy as they are Annie and Archie. Now that the whole brood has hatched, a first for her, we came back to Sean with a few more questions.]\n\nQ: A fourth chick! We’ve never known Annie to raise four chicks or have all of her eggs hatch before. Do you have any idea what the contributing factors could be for this success? Is it Archie?\n\nWe honestly have no real idea on why she's never succeeded with four eggs before. It could be random chance or there could be an external factor playing a role. It's possible it has to do with Archie, but I'm not sure we'll ever know for sure!\n\nQ: Are there any downsides to having all the eggs hatch (like increasing the probability of all of them not making it to fledgling/flight, or making it difficult to keep them all warm)?\n\nPeregrine falcons are usually very good about being able to fledge most of the chicks that hatch, especially in places like the Bay Area that have plentiful food. It certainly means that it will be a lot more work for the parents! They'll have to hunt a little more and it will be difficult for them to fit all the chicks under themselves. Especially for Archie, who is substantially smaller than Annie! It might make fledging a bit more chaotic, but I think they should have no problem guiding all four in their first flights.\n\nQ: How are they going to feed all these little guys??\n\nThey'll have to bring a lot of pigeons! As the chicks get to ~3 weeks old and older, they will be ravenous, so feeding four means that Annie and Archie will be out hunting a lot.\n\nQ: Is it unusual for a female of Annie’s age to suddenly be this productive?\n\nShe has had some pretty remarkable longevity. The average peregrine falcon is on territory for ~5 years, so she's surpassed that, and in an area with a lot of competition for territories. As long as they are healthy, female peregrines don't typically see a reduction of productivity over time. Menopause does exist in birds, but it's at such an advanced age that few birds ever reach that point.\n\nBack to top"
