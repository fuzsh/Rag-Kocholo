        "text": "WINTHROP — Winthrop residents Ed and Louise Hinkley will be on tour throughout Italy from June 27 to July 12 as members of the Blue Lake Leonard Falcone Memorial Band. Sponsored by the Michigan-based Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp, the nation’s largest summer school of the arts, the tour will honor the memory of Leonard Falcone.\n\nThe Hinkleys are participating in an adventure with Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp. Ed’s high school band teacher, Fritz Stansell, started the camp in 1966. Ed or Louise have played in several community bands, including the Hallowell Community Band, KPAC, the Auburn Community Concert Band, Freeport Coastal Winds, the Maine Pops Concert Band and the Green Valley (AZ) Concert Band.\n\nThe opportunity to play in these bands has prepared them to play with this extraordinary group of musicians. The band will play nine concerts, visit historic sites and stay with five host families. Rita Comstock, who wrote “Solid Brass – The Leonard Falcone Story,” played first clarinet and is one of Ed’s classmates from his high school in Michigan. Louise will play flute and piccolo and Ed will play baritone saxophone.\n\nLeonard Falcone’s journey to America at the age of 16 from the Puglian village of Roseto Valfortore and his rise to become one of the greatest bandsman in the history of American music is extraordinary. Recognized in his lifetime as the as the world’s greatest euphonium virtuoso, Falcone was director of bands at Michigan State University for more than 40 years and was instrumental in the early formation of Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp.\n\nComprised of former Falcone students, Blue Lake faculty members, and alumni from the Blue Lake International Adult Band, the tour will include stops in Bergamo, Milan, Rome, Arezzo, Ruvo di Puglia, Molfetta and Leonard Falcone’s hometown, Roseto Valfortore.\n\nThe Roseto Valfortore performance will be broadcast live on Blue Lake Public Radio and simulcast bilingually on Radio Centro Roseto.\n\nTo commemorate the tour, Italian composer Silvestro Sabatelli was commissioned by Blue Lake to create a special composition that captures the spirit of Leonard Falcone. The five-movement work, titled “Solid Brass,” will feature Italian tuba soloist Domenico Zizzi and will receive its world premiere at the Big Rapids High School Auditorium performance on Thursday, June 25.\n\nFMI: www.bluelake.org or 1-800-221-3796."
