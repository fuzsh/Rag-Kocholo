        "text": "It’s not uncommon to see someone singing at a wedding. But the bride singing as she walks down the aisle? A bride in England recently decided this was a good idea, surprising her fiancé and all the guests. As she made her way down the aisle, she sang her heart out to Shania Twain’s “Still The One.”\n\nYup, she’s walking down the aisle, but instead of the usual emotional moment, she’s got a head mic on and is belting out her favorite power ballad. It’s like she’s auditioning for The Voice—except no one asked for a concert.\n\nLet’s be real: It’s a little cringeworthy. Weddings are supposed to be about two people coming together, not a one-woman show. It’s one thing to personalize your ceremony, but turning your grand entrance into a solo performance? That’s pretty self-absorbed.\n\nGuests came to celebrate your love story, not to sit through your karaoke night. And that head mic? It feels less like a wedding and more like a Vegas act.\n\nSo maybe save the singing for the reception, and let the aisle be about love, not lungs.\n\nLet’s be honest—this could have gone way wrong. Imagine being trapped in a church while the bride struggles to hit those high notes. Luckily for everyone, this bride had some decent pipes.\n\nBride Singing Solo A Bit Much?\n\nSinging your way to the altar is definitely unique, but it raises a question: When does creativity at weddings cross the line into cringeworthy?\n\nWe’ve all been to those weddings where the couple’s “special touch” leaves guests more uncomfortable than impressed. Here are a few other trends we could do without.\n\n1. Over-the-Top Choreographed Dances\n\nSure, a first dance can be sweet, but do we really need a five-minute performance that looks like an audition for Dancing with the Stars? Keep it simple, and save the intricate moves for the after-party.\n\n2. Endless Toasts\n\nWe get it—you love the couple. But when the speeches drag on and on, guests start eyeing the bar or their watches. A heartfelt toast is lovely. A 20-minute monologue? Not so much.\n\n3. Flash Mobs\n\nOnce upon a time, a flash mob was cool and surprising. Now, it’s more likely to induce eye rolls. Let’s leave the spontaneous group dancing to the professionals.\n\n4. Over-Extended Photo Sessions\n\nYou’ve got a great photographer, but making guests wait hours while you get the perfect shot? That’s just cruel. Your loved ones are there to celebrate, not to sit around in uncomfortable shoes.\n\nWeddings should be memorable, but not for the wrong reasons. So, brides, feel free to sing your way down the aisle if you’ve got the voice for it. Just maybe leave the other cringe-worthy trends b\n\nLauren Beckham Falcone is the co-host of Bob & LBF in the Morning.
