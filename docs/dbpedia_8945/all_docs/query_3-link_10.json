The baby is a boy and is named Salvatore.[1]\n\nSalvatore Falcone is the reputed boss of the Mafia in Utica, New York, from 1930-57. He is born in Sicily and immigrates as a young man.[2] Salvatore's date of birth, from the records of his death, is 17 August 1891.[3][4] According to a profile on Mafia Wiki, Salvatore is born in Sciacca[5], in Agrigento province, Sicily. He is the son of Antonio Falcone and Maria Sclafani Falcone. Antonio's obituary confirms that he was born in Sciacca.[6]\n\nAlthough his death record gives a birthdate of 17 August 1891, a draft registration during WWI for Salvatore gives a date two years earlier, 17 August 1889.[7] The 17 August date is the one Salvatore reports most consistently. Other than the civil record of his birth, I have not found his actual date of birth associated with any other record for him. Cascio-10 23:06, 20 July 2022 (UTC)\n\nAlthough Salvatore and his siblings are registered at birth with the surname \"Falcone,\" their father's birth record names him Antonio Projetto. \"Projetto\" is a surname given to foundlings. Foundlings often took another surname which appeared in later records, including their children's births.\n\nThe family emigrated under the surname \"Projetto\" in 1907.\n\nDeparting Palermo on the SS San Giovanni on 23 November 1907, these passengers are listed in lines 50-54 and connected with a bracket:\n\nAntonio Projetto, 51 (b. 1856), laborer, married\n\nSalvatore Projetto, son, 16 (b. 1891), laborer\n\nAntonina Projetto, 15 (b. 1892), daughter\n\nGiuseppe Projetto, 4 (b. 1903), son\n\nMaria Sclafani, 41 (b. 1866), Antonio’s wife\n\nThey all last resided and were born in Sciacca. They leave there Antonio’s mother in law, Giuseppa Bono. They are going to New York, NY to meet Antonio’s brother-in-law (and the children’s uncle) Vincenzo Sabella at 165 Mott? St.[8]\n\nA certificate of arrival stamped 15 August 1924 appears in the file with Salvatore's declaration of intention and petition for natualization. It certifies \"Salvatore Projelto\" arrives 8 December 1907 on the San Giovanni.[9] Salvatore's brother, Joseph, petitions around the same time and a similar certificate appears in his file.\n\nSalvatore Falcone, age 21 (b. 1890), and Josephine Provenzano, age 18 (b. 1893), are married in Trinidad, Las Animas County, Colorado by a Catholic priest, M. Corsi, on 26 February 1911.[10][11][2]\n\nThey have six known children: Anthony S. (1911), Victor (1914), Mary (c. 1915), Clara (1921), Joseph (1925), and Salvatore Jr. (1928). All but Mary are listed among Josephine's children when she petitions for naturalization in 1937.[12]\n\nAnthony is born 2 December 1911[13][14][15] in in Jensen, CO.[12] He is named after his paternal grandfather. According to a travel manifest, Anthony is born in Sausen, Colorado.[16] The federal censuses of 1920-40 confirm that Anthony was born in Colorado.\n\nSalvatore's father, Antonio, runs a wholesale business in New York City. [6]\n\nVictor is born on 8 January 1914 in New York City.[12]\n\nSalvatore Falcone, 28, living at 1709 Bath Av., Brooklyn, NY, registers for the draft for WWI. He was born in Sciacca, Italy, on 17 August 1889. He is the proprietor of a grocery. He is employed at “Detroit.” He supports a wife and three children. The address on this card, where the registrar would record the address of registration, is 149 Elizabeth St. It also said it was mailed at Cleveland, O on 6 June 1917 at 1:30 PM and is stamped Jun 7 1917. On 5 June, the registrar reports that Salvatore is short and stout with brown eyes and black hair.[7]\n\nAntonio retires to Utica in 1919. In Utica, Salvatore's brother, Joseph, resumes their father's business, which in 1937 is located at 536 Bleecker St.[6]\n\nIn the 1920 federal census of Manhattan, NY, taken 21 January, Salvator Falcone heads a household on Elizabeth St. He is 28 (b. 1891) and immigrated in 1910. His wife, Josephine, is 25 (b. 1894). Their children at home are Anthony, 9 (b. 1910), Victor, 5 (b. 1914), Mary, 4 years and one month (b. Feb 1915), Clara, three months (b. Oct 1919). Also in the household are Salvator’s parents, Marie, 50 (b. 1869), and Antonio, 62 (b. 1857), who both immigrated in 1914. Salvator was born in Italy, Josephine in Louisiana, Anthony in Colorado, their other children in New York, and Salvator’s parents in Italy. Salvator and his neighbor and brother-in-law, Joseph Bono, 23, are salesmen for a grocery line.[17]\n\nClara is born 20 May 1921 in Utica, New York.[12]\n\nSalvatore declares his intention to become a citizen on 3 May 1922 at Utica NY Supreme Court of Oneida County.[18]\n\nIn 1923, brothers Joseph and Salvatore Falcone, and Pietro Lima, are bondsmen for Salvatore Calleri, 25, a suspect in a 7 August abduction.[19]\n\nSalvatore Falcone petitions for naturalization in the Supreme Court of Oneida County at Utica, NY. He lives at 515 Bacon St., Utica, NY. he is a merchant, born 17 August 1891 in Sciacca, Italy. Emigrated from Palermo on 24 November 1907 and arrived in New York on 8 December 1907 on the San Giovanni. He declared his intention to become a citizen on 3 May 1922 at Utica NY Supreme Court of Oneida County. Declaration no. 7057 dated 10 October 1924. He is married to Josephine, who was born 26 February 1894 in Louisiana, USA and lives in Utica, NY. Salvatore has 3 children: Anthony, born 2 December 1911 in Jansen, Col., Victor born 6 February 1914 in New York, and Clara born 20 May 1921 in Utica, NY. They all live in Utica.\n\nWitnesses Antonio Faga, court interpreter, living in Utica, NY, and Alfred Bertolini, real estate agent, living at 413 Second St., Utica, NY, testify to knowing him, sworn and signed 10 October 1924. (The same witnesses appear on brother Joseph's naturalization paperwork.)\n\nSalvatore Falcone’s declaration of intention is on the same image. [18]\n\nIn the 1925 New York state census of Utica, Ward 8, Oneida County, Salvatore Falcone, 31 (b. 1894), born in Italy, in the US for 14 years (since 1911), naturalized in 1922, a wholesale grocer working on his own account, heads a household at 515 Bacon St. with his wife, Josephine, 30 (b. 1895), and children Tony, 13 (b. 1912), Victorio, 11 (b. 1914), and Clera, 4 (b. 1921), all born in the US.\n\nAt the same address, Giuseppe Falcone, 23 (b. 1902), born in Italy, heads a household. In the US for 18 years (since 1907), naturalized in 1925. Wholesale grocer working on his own account. With wife Mary, 22 (b. 1903), daughter Mary, 2 (b. 1923), both US born, and parents Antonio, 64 (b. 1861), and Mary, 59 (b. 1866), both born in Italy, in the US for 14 years (imm. 1911), not employed.[20]\n\nOn 11 June 1925, Salvatore's mother, Maria, dies in the hospital after an illness that confines her there for a year. She is just 56 years old.[21]\n\nAt the time of Maria's death, Salvatore and Joseph Falcone are well known as wholesale grocers, the Falcone Brothers.[21]\n\nSalvatore Falcone is admitted as a US citizen on 21 July 1925.[22]\n\nJoseph is born on 26 November 1925 in Utica.[12]\n\nSalvatore Jr. is born 25 December 1928.[12]\n\nIn the 1930 federal census of Utica, NY, taken 4 April, at 515 Bacon St, Salvatore Falcone owns his home. He is 38 (b. 1892) and married when he was 19 (c. 1911) His wife, Josephine, was 16 at marriage and is now 35 (b. 1895). Their children at home are Anthony, 18 (b. 1912), Victor, 16 (b. 1914), Clara, 8 (b. 1922), Joseph, 3 (b. 1927), and Salvatore Jr., 1 (b. 1929). Also in the household is Salvatore’s father, Anthony, 74 (b. 1856), a widower. Salvatore was born in Italy. Josephine was born in Louisiana of Italian parents. Their oldest son, Anthony, was born in Colorado and the rest of the children were born in New York. Anthony, Sr., was born in Italy and immigrated in 1907, as did Salvatore. They are both salesmen for a wholesale grocery.[23] Mary, who appeared in the 1920 census, does not appear in subsequent census records with Salvatore's family.\n\nIn 1934, illicit alcohol producers and brothers-in-law Pietro Lima and Dominick Aiello are killed together, execution style, in their car.[24][25]\n\nThe murder is officially unsolved, although speculation is that the Falcone family is behind their deaths.[25] One forum participant names Salvatore Falcone and Salvatore Grio as the responsible parties.[26] Dominick and Pietro are given grand funerals and buried in identical, gold plated caskets.[27]\n\nIn 1936, Salvatore buys a dairy products plant in Stittville.[2]\n\nHis obituary tells us that Salvatore received messages of gratitude from Mussolini and King Victor Emanuel for organizing fund raising to finance the Italian army in its campaign against Ethiopia.[2]\n\nIn March 1937, Josephine petitions for naturalization under Section 4 of the Cable Act. Her petition is granted on 2 March 1937.[12][28]\n\nAnthony marries Anna Marie Aiello, who is the daughter of the late Dominick Aiello, on 10 July 1937.[29] By this time, Anthony is an attorney, a profession his youngest brother, Salvatore Jr., joins him in.[2]\n\nOn 3 August 1937, Salvatore's father, Antonio, dies in Miami Beach. When his body is brought to Utica for burial, a week later, Salvatore is not in town.[30]\n\nOn the SS REX sailing from Naples on 16 September 1937 and arriving in the port of New York on 23 September, appearing on the manifest of US citizens:\n\n1. Franco Cucchiara, 42 (b. 1895), married, connected to line 2 with a bracket, naturalized in Boston, MA in May 1930, lives at 145 Belmont St, Boston, MA\n\n2. Santa Cucchiara, 31 (b. 1906), married, born in New York City on 20 November 1905, lives at same US address as above\n\n3. Salvatore Falcone, 46 (b. 1891), married, naturalized in Rome, NY, lives at 515 Bacon St., Utica, NY[31]\n\nJoe Valachi testifies in 1963 that he met Salvatore Falcone in the 1930s. In 1937, the year Anthony marries, his father's net worth is estimated as being somewhere between $1 and 5 million.[2]\n\nAfter their marriage, Anthony and Anne live at 1652 Conkling Avenue in Utica, near the Memorial Parkway.[29][32] Salvatore lives at this address at some point between the 1940 census and his move to Florida in 1947.[2]\n\nOn 21 January 1938, Anna's mother, Paolina's house at 1166 Webster in Utica is raided and a \"super still\" is discovered.[33][32]\n\nAnthony's father and uncle Joseph are indicted for running an illegal alcohol ring. Paolina provides for Salvatore's $20,000 bail.[34] Salvatore and Joseph Falcone's trial begins in May 1939.[32] Charged with conspiracy to avoid taxes on alcohol, they are found guilty on 17 June 1939, and sentenced to 17 months in prison and a fine of $6,000.[2] They appeal, winning their temporary freedom.[34] On 13 February 1940, the Circuit Court of Appeals reverses their convictions.[2]\n\nIn the 1940 federal census of Utica, NY, taken 9 April, Salvatore Falcone owns his home at 515 Bacon St. He is 48 and his wife, Josephine, is 44. Their children at home are Clara, 18, Joseph, 13, and Salvatore Jr., 11. Salvatore was born in Italy, his wife in Louisiana, and their children in New York. Salvatore is a self employed merchant.[35]\n\nIn 1946, Salvatore's son, Joseph, marries Josephine Ciccone and moves to Miami, Florida,[11] followed by Salvatore, who opens Falcone and Sons Italian Grocery in 1950, at 5609 NW 7th St., Miami. Reportedly, he spends most of his time away from Miami, leaving the grocery in the hands of his son.[2]\n\nIn the 1950 federal census of Miami, Dade Co., FL, taken 6 April, Salvatore and Joseph Falcone are both at 5609 NW 6th Pl.\n\nSalvatore Falcone is in upstairs #1. He is 58 (b. 1892), married, born in Italy. His wife, Josephine M., 54 (b. 1896), has “Lo” entered for her birthplace. With them is their son Salvatore Jr., 20 (b. 1930), not married, born in NY. Salvatore Sr. sells food in a retail and wholesale grocery store and works on his own account.\n\nJoseph S. Falcone, 24 (b. 1926), born in NY, heads a household at upstairs #2. with his wife Josephine M., 22 (b. 1928), born in NY, and son Salvatore J., 2 (b. 1948), born in Florida. Joseph sells food in a retail and wholesale grocery store. [36]\n\nSalvatore Falcone & Sons, wholesale grocers, are listed in the Miami city directory in 1953 at 5600 NW 7th Av.[37]\n\nIn 1957, Salvatore and his brother, Joseph, along with their enforcer, Russell Rosario Mancuso[38], are the three delegates from Utica to a Mafia convention in Apalachin, New York.[39] Salvatore disappears and evades arrest.[2] His brother is convicted in 1960 on a \"conspiracy of silence\" regarding the Apalachin meeting. The conviction is overturned. On 17 August 1962, Salvatore turns himself in to authorities in New York City. He says he has been in Florida all this time, on medical advice.[40]\n\nIn 1958, Mancuso is subpoenaed to testify before the Senate Labor Rackets Investigating Committee, where he takes the fifth about 68 times. A chart of Mafia activity in the area names Salvatore and his son, Salvatore Jr., among the members active in Utica.[41] A company operated by Joseph Profaci, the Carmela Mia Packing Co in Brooklyn, makes shipments to Joseph Falcone in Utica and to Salvatore Falcone in Miami. It is suggested by Sherman Willse, head of the Committee’s New York investigating staff, that these are related to narcotics and gambling trades.[38]\n\nIn 1962, Salvatore's brother, Joseph, testifies before a State Investigation Commission. He describes the 1957 Apalachin convention “as something like a picnic.”[39]\n\nIn 1968, an Oneida County grand jury investigates organized gambling. That June, a raid turns up an alleged numbers operation worth $250,000. It's alleged that profits from gambling finance a loansharking operation. Salvatore's brother, Joseph, is called to testify and spends eight minutes with the grand jury. He is accompanied by Salvatore's son, Anthony.[39]\n\nDeath of Salvatore\n\nSalvatore dies at age 81 on 10 October 1972 in Florida.[3] He last resided in zip code 33161[4] (serving North Miami, Miami Shores, Sweetwater, Biscayne Park, and Golden Glades). He is buried on 12 October in Calvary Cemetery in Utica, NY.[2]\n\nJoseph, Salvatore's son, dies when he is just 48 years old (b. 1926), on 23 July 1974. His surviving siblings are named in Joseph's obituary: a sister, Mrs. Joseph (Clara) Dainoski of Elizabeth, New Jersey, and three brothers: Anthony of North Miami Beach, Florida; Victor of New Hartford, New York; and Salvatore Jr. of Lynwood, New Jersey.[11]\n\nAnthony dies at age 89 on 6 September 2000, three months after Anne. They last lived in Florida.[15] They are buried together in Calvary Cemetery in Utica.\n\nSources\n\n↑ Atto di nascita, Salvatore Falcone. (1889, October 12).
