        "text": "FalconCam\n\nCHECK IN ON OUR PEREGRINE FALCONS\n\nFor almost two decades, peregrine falcons have made their homes in a nest high atop the 26-story Indiana Michigan Power Center building in Fort Wayne, Indiana. You can watch nesting families of this raptor species via webcam, thanks our collaboration with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) and Soarin’ Hawk Avian Rescue, who work with our I&M colleagues.\n\nABOUT PEREGRINE FALCONS\n\nPeregrine falcons hunt by soaring from tall cliffs at high speeds and killing prey in mid-air – mostly medium-sized birds. They often nest in tall city buildings like the Indiana Michigan Power Center building, which offers a cliff-like vantage point, few natural predators, and access to water and food such as pigeons and starlings.\n\nIn North America, peregrine falcons were once on the Endangered Species List due to exposure to pesticides such as DDT. In part because of efforts to protect them, peregrine falcons are now on the upgraded Threatened List.\n\nAbout the FalconCam\n\nIn the early 1990s, IDNR biologists built the nest box on top of the Indiana Michigan Power Center building and installed the webcam. Several families have occupied the nest since then. The IDNR and volunteers from Soarin’ Hawk Avian Rescue and the Indiana Audubon Society monitor the birds and provide medical care, nest cleanup, and tracking.\n\nLinks For More Information About Falcons\n\nSecurity Code\n\nYour security code is a short word or phrase you set up with our customer service associates to provide extra protection for your online account.\n\nIf you have forgotten your security code, please call 800.311.4634."
