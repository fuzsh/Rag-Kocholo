I’m proud that the team has been recognized for another award for their outstanding achievements in producing the This Week in Kirkland program.”\n\nThe podcast is based on this very newsletter of the same name, which won third place in the Trust & Transparency category of Granicus’ international Digital Government Awards hosted in October 2023.

Kirkland Firefighters are also Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and are trained and equipped to respond to a variety of requests for service including emergency medical calls, fire and rescue incidents, and hazardous material responses within Kirkland.\n\nEMS Week is a time to recognize and honor paramedics, EMTs, and the entire EMS workforce for their service.

The Busy Lil Bees Kids Booth is sponsored by Kirkland Kid’s Dentistry. Crafts and games will be available as well as face painting one Friday per month.\n\nCome with your friends, or meet new ones; and enjoy shopping for delicious and nutritious foods.

We look forward to seeing you at Juanita Beach on these spring and summer Friday afternoons and evenings.\n\nWe All Can Contribute to Safe Buildings\n\nNatural Yard Care Ambassador Program\n\nThe City of Kirkland is launching a Natural Yard Care Ambassador program.
