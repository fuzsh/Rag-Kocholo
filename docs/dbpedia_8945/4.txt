Vanderbilt graduate Ally Carey and assistant coach Amber Falcone helped the U.S. women’s national team go 3-0 last week at the North American Challenge in Oshawa, Ont.

On Friday, Team USA won their opening match against the Haudenosaunee. Carey led the Americans with seven draw controls in the contest. On Saturday and Sunday, Team USA won two matches against split Canadian squads.

The North American Challenge was a preview event for the 2013 Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL) World Cup, which will be contested in Oshawa next summer. Tryouts for the 2012-14 U.S. women’s national team will take place later this month at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.

Carey and Falcone will be joined in Catonsville, Md., by rising junior Alyssa Dunlap. The Commodore defender was one of 38 players to advance past a first round of tryouts in late May.

Following July’s final round of tryouts, 36-40 players will be selected as the training team pool for the U.S. women’s national team, which will defend its 2009 gold medal at the 2013 FIL World Cup. The final 18-player World Cup roster is expected to be announced in February 2013.
