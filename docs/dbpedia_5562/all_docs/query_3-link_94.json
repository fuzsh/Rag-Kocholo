        "text": "Carl Gottlieb joins us. He wrote JAWS.\n\nJAWS is one of those movies that has spawned entire festivals and annual meetings in which people dress up and reenact parts of the film. In a word, the movie is a classic.\n\nJAWS vaulted Steven Spielberg to filmmaking royalty and writer Carl Gottlieb to the top of Hollywood screenwriters.\n\nHosts Mark Thompson and Heather Ankeny ask about JAWS …among other things, how Carl arrived at writing the line “You’re gonna need a bigger boat”.\n\nIf it wasn’t Carl, then who actually wrote the classic “Indianapolis speech” from Quint (Robert Shaw) and what movie had both Spielberg and Gottlieb seen that inspired them in a pinch to rework JAWS so the audience doesn’t see the shark until well into the story?\n\nCarl is the reason that Steven Spielberg used DEVIL’S TOWER in CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and he tells us the story of alerting Spielberg to that location.\n\nWhat about THE JERK? How did the association with Steve Martin start and how did the two collaborate to make that movie?\n\nAmong the many legends Carl has collaborated with is Richard Pryor. He wrote two movies and television comedy with Pryor. Carl talks about Pryor was like to work with and be around and how he once broke up a fist fight between Pryor and an NBC page.\n\nCarl also talks about meeting the legendary musician David Crosby and becoming his biographer through a life so sorted and wild that it took TWO BOOKS to chronicle it all.\n\nCarl Gottlieb…Hollywood writer of comedy, drama, suspense and biography.\n\nIf you are interested in reading one of Carl’s books, click on the titles below:\n\nThe Jaws Log"
