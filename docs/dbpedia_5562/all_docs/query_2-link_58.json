        "text": "In 2021, I joined comedians Matthew Schott and Chris Okawa on their podcast, The Adaptation Game. I was tasked to conceive my dream movie remake. I chose Jaws, and I reassigned the roles of Scheider, Shaw, and Dreyfus to actresses Kirsten Dunst, Lea DeLaria, and Tessa Thompson, respectively. I also developed a romantic storyline between Quint (DeLaria) and Hooper (Thompson). I believed this casting to be a pipe dream. However, after reading Jen Corrigan’s piece “Three Men on a Boat” in the groundbreaking essay compilation It Came from the Closet, and seeing The Shark is Broken on Broadway, I think we may be approaching a time when a queer remake is entirely possible. While Jaws is subtextually queer to some viewers, overt queerness could enliven the story for the millennium. For too long, horror fans have been dissatisfied with stale remakes of iconic horror films; we’re looking at you Friday the 13th (2009) and A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010). It is time for a fresh approach.\n\nWe Deserve a Queer Remake of Jaws.\n\nOn the surface, Jaws is a straightforward story of three men on a shark-hunting expedition. Subtextually, this story is brimming with male intimacy and vulnerability. The trio face their fears, talk about past trauma, and share constricted quarters. The tension built over days at sea, though thick, is often eased by moments of levity through touch, song, jests, and storytelling. The cast dynamic is fostered by genuine off-screen admiration and frustration for each other as people and actors, pushing themselves and their fellow actors to go further and do better.\n\nJaws does pass the Bechdel test… once. Aside from a brief geographic conversation between wives, Jaws is homosocial and guided by men and their respective traumas and egos. “In the context of Jaws,” advocates author Jen Corrigan, “homoeroticism can flourish because women are taken out of the equation, but it’s not positioned as a reaction to the lack of women present.” Women are mentioned during the film’s second half, but merely as wives and past lovers. In a film centered around men, it is no wonder, then, that myself and other fans sense something queer is afoot, and maybe it’s time for Jaws to be loud and proud.\n\nMale Intimacy in Jaws (1975)\n\nHeather O. Petrocelli surveyed 3,774 queer horror fans for her new book Queer for Fear: Horror Film and the Queer Spectator (2023). Jaws did not appear in the top 25 favorites list among participants. However, Petrocelli reveals the adoration for haunting/paranormal films by queer viewers (91.6%), as well as monster movies (86%). “To be queer is to be haunted,” asserts Petrocelli. Stories of hauntings resonate with queer viewers, for we know what it is like to hide or be hidden away for our queerness. Who aboard the Orca isn’t haunted by something from their past?\n\nWhile in Amity and aboard the Orca, Quint, Hooper, and Brody discuss and face their myriad fears: drowning, shark attacks, being underestimated, losing communication with loved ones, and, of course, the erratic behavior of one of their crewmembers. Corrigan finds tenderness in their interactions and sees them as quite queer, especially when things get physical. “My queer reading stems from two aspects of covert communication,” states Corrigan, “the gaze and innocuous touch… Historically, queer interactions were dangerous, and, really, still are. The looks and touches between the men signal intimacy that is easy to overlook…” She then points to an early scene, when Quint asks to see Hooper’s hands. “Touching with hands has a significance in queer intimacy. It is a touch that is both erotic and personal yet can easily be perceived as casual… [Quint] takes Hooper’s hands in his and pulls Hooper toward him as if they are about to embrace…” The intimate moment abruptly turns sour, as Quint cheekily proclaims Hooper has “city hands,” used to handling money. Quint seems to relish intimidating and teasing Hooper. The two dominating personalities clash, but there is a twinkle there, an ineffable connection between the two men and characters that makes them captivating to watch. A romantic storyline does not seem too implausible in any adaptation (please, no more sequels!).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe class difference between Quint and Hooper is a driving force for conflict. As extrapolated by The Shark is Broken, it is the acting methods of Shaw and Dreyfus that cause them to bicker off-screen. In the play, this resulted in a complicated yet sweet relationship between the actors, but not one without its blowups.\n\nThe Shark is Broken (2022)\n\nWritten by Ian Shaw and Joseph Nixon, and based on Shaw’s father’s drinking journals he kept while on set, The Shark is Broken is about the downtime between Robert Shaw (Ian Shaw), Richard Dreyfus (Alex Brightman), and Roy Scheider (Colin Donnell) as they wait for the shark to be, well, not broken during the approximately five-month shoot. Most Jaws fans know about the real-life tension between Shaw and Dreyfus, and how this tension fueled Quint and Hooper’s on-screen animosity. Shaw was a traditional theater actor, eventually moving into television and film. Dreyfus, who also found himself in theater and television, was on a quest for Hollywood stardom and fame. Though the two men clashed, often due to either Dreyfus’ ego or Shaw’s addiction, Dreyfus pined for Shaw’s approval and blessing as an actor. The Shark is Broken had a playful monotony that lent itself to both casual and intense conversations. There are tears, embraces, emotional and mental breakdowns, and painful revelations about alcoholism. And, in his downtime, Brody stripped down to a tight Speedo to sunbathe! While these moments were left off-screen, they allow audiences a glimpse at the type of intimacy that fostered the amazing chemistry between the three Jaws stars.\n\nSo, where do we go from here? Why make the subtext ‘text?’ I ask, why not? Recent sequels, including those of the Scream franchise, have been infused with new queer characters and/or plot points to much success. Hellraiser, the 2022 remake, was applauded for casting the talented Jamie Clayton as Hellpriest/Pinhead, which is more aligned with Clive Barker’s original vision from “The Hellbound Heart.” Perhaps Jaws is too iconic to tinker with. But, Queer horror is having a big moment, and remakes have the power to boldly go where they were unable to go before.\n\nSources:\n\nCorrigan, Jen. “Three Men on a Boat.” Essay.

New York: The Feminist Press, 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreen, Jesse. “Review: A Bloodless Postscript to ‘Jaws’ in ‘the Shark Is Broken.’” The New York Times, August 11, 2023.\n\nPetrocelli, Heather O. Queer For Fear: Horror Film and the Queer Spectator. Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2023.\n\nThe curious thing about making a film within a subgenre you’ve been watching your entire life is that suddenly, and without warning, you start to look at it in a multitude of vastly different ways.\n\nWhen setting out alongside my intrepid cast & crew to shoot our forthcoming feature film, There’s a Zombie Outside, we knew we were approaching the tropes of the living dead a little bit sideways.\n\nFor one thing, in comparison to the oft-expected shambling hordes, our movie only had one zombie.\n\n…and it also happened to be deeply and unapologetically queer.\n\nUtilizing our titular creature to explore notions of “queer listlessness,” as well as our tenuous relationship with art, I became deeply aware that I was asking audiences to meet us somewhere slightly different than the expected farmhouse with survivors trapped inside.\n\nYet, as I continued to survey the landscape of time-honored zombie tropes, I couldn’t help but notice that for every film adhering to convention, there were exceptional outliers. Movies with titles like 1995’s La Cage Aux Zombies, 2009’s George: A Zombie Intervention, and 2011’s Remington and the Curse of the Zombadings all explored risen-from-the-grave identity politics or presented flamboyant flesh-eating farce with flair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch films, and numerous others, provide evidence of an undeniable interest in zombies on the part of queer filmmakers and viewers alike. Interestingly, among creators, there’s a notable preponderance of gay-identifying men who gravitate to the subject matter. Yet, in most cases, beyond the tacit agreement of the living dead as tool for commentary, these individuals seem all too willing to take their flesh-eaters into a multitude of varying directions that their straight counterparts dare not tread.\n\nIn many ways, the unique divergence of the queer zombie has effectively allowed it to “come out of the coffin” as its own subgenre.\n\nHowever, like the pop culture redefining reanimated corpses that came before them, there’s more to this splintered classification than mere surface-level assignation.\n\nThe Queerification of the Zombie\n\nWith Night of the Living Dead, George Romero and John A. Russo undeniably reconstructed how we culturally think of zombies. The “Romero Zombie,” as it would come to be known, became the propulsion point forward for nearly all living dead media that would follow. Indeed, so much of the “mainstream” zombie subgenre strives to emulate the tropes of what Romero put forth, modern audiences unwaveringly accept this blueprint as how such movies are done.\n\nYet, for Bruce LaBruce, award-winning filmmaker of Otto; or, Up with Dead People and L.A. Zombie, there’s a crucial element to Romero’s work that many modern filmmakers overlook.\n\n“Romero made the political zombie,” says LaBruce, “which is one thing people don’t do so much when they’re emulating him. Night of the Living Dead has a Black lead that is shot by the police because they think he’s a zombie…or maybe they don’t. It’s a total political allegory. Romero’s subsequent films are a critique of consumer capitalism. There’s a lot of class and race representation in his work. I think it’s too bad that more people don’t emulate those aspects of his filmmaking.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n…and while it’s true that many modern mainstream zombie films may eschew that sense of allegory, the truth remains that queer artists are often political simply by virtue of existence.\n\nFor Chris Diani, filmmaker of Creatures from the Pink Lagoon, the plight of zombie movie protagonists reflects this circumstance.\n\n“To a gay man, the basic set-up of every zombie movie is frighteningly familiar: A group of scrappy underdogs has to use empathy, intellect, wit, and resilience to face off against brainless, shambling slobs dressed in last year’s fashions,” Diani says. “What is that, if not a monster movie version of queers clashing with rabid right-wing protesters at Pride?”\n\nIt’s a point that Dr. Heather O. Petrocelli, author of Queer for Fear: Horror Film and the Queer Spectator, seems to reiterate.\n\n“Even in this era of increased acceptance for queer people, we’re living in a liminal state of precarity,” says Petrocelli. “The most recent backlash shows us that it’s not just three steps forward…and then three more steps forward. You can get your ass knocked back. Progress is not a linear track.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll things undead body politic considered, in many ways, it’s Petrocelli’s inference of liminality wherein the notion of a separate queer zombie subgenre really begins to take shape.\n\nWhy Do Queer People Resonate with the Zombie?\n\nFor a queer audience, the liminal state (defined by the dictionary as “the quality of being between two stages or places”) is our ability to see, internalize, and comprehend both sides of what a zombie movie has to offer.\n\n“The particular thing that a zombie has in liminality is that they literally are us.” says Petrocelli, adding that “zombies, as liminal monsters, are as close as you can get to who we are.”\n\nAfter all, what is a zombie other than a human standing just on the other side of death? Whereas many other monsters of fiction have a supernatural transition of sorts, a keystone of zombie lore centers on the idea of how quickly zombies can go to people we know and love…to other.\n\nIn that respect, there’s an aspect of zombie cinema that allows audiences to have a broader point of view in relation to the monster.\n\n“Zombie films flip focus,” says Petrocelli. “You can identify with the zombie or, depending on the movie, you can identify with the person who has the animated masses coming for them. That’s the point of liminality – you don’t have a foothold on either side of the threshold.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Bruce LaBruce, the idea of seeing things from the perspective of the ostracized living dead could certainly lend itself to the appeal.\n\n“The disenfranchisement and outsiderness of queers is all very conducive to the zombie trope,” he says, further adding that while other monsters may have gotten a queer read much sooner, there’s something particularly interesting about the zombie’s gay revolution.\n\n“The vampire mythology really tied into ideas of the sexual predator, so of course it was aligned with a gay subtext or they were presented as bisexual. But to transpose that onto the zombie myth is a bit more of a leap, in a way,” says LaBruce. “It’s not so sexy on the surface. The monster is much more of a deadened creature. There’s a bit of necessary necromantic element when you sexualize a zombie…but it’s still kind of the romantic idea of a disenfranchised character who doesn’t fit in.”\n\nUsing Monsters to Explore the Monstrous\n\nExplorations of otherness via the monstrous aside, for a creature so closely tied in lore to contagion, there’s undeniably another aspect that those examining the queer community’s connection to zombie narratives can’t deny.\n\n“The rise of pandemics in modern culture definitely had an influence on the zombie in film,” says Dr. Heather Petrocelli.\n\n“It’s not difficult to make the connection between AIDS and zombies,” says Bruce LaBruce. “The fact that gays became pathologized because of AIDS and treated sort of like monsters – it’s a body withering disease where the ravages were so extreme that people were turned into almost living corpses.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s well-documented that many queer creatives channeled their rage and grief over the seismic loss of the AIDS epidemic into art, and for those working within the horror genre, it should come as no surprise that such emotions were filtered through a dark lens of the fantastic. The monsters became symbolic of monstrous circumstances and stories of survivors in the face of overwhelming death became all the more poignant.\n\nYet, there is often such focus on this particular chapter of history and how it is channeled through the lens of horror that some critics overlook the crucial element of empowerment and escapism retreating into monster stories can provide.\n\nSpeaking on this distinction, Chris Diani illustrates how, ultimately, versatility is key.\n\n“It’s the way zombie narratives can be stretched to address countless other struggles faced by the queer community that makes them so attractive to gay filmmakers,” Diani says. “A gay zombie film can be an AIDS allegory, an anti-capitalistic screed, a glimpse at the outsider experience, or a campy takedown of cruising culture. With all these takes and more to explore, it’s not surprising to see the enduring appeal of zombie films to queer horror fans.”\n\nPerhaps nothing highlights Diani’s point regarding this burgeoning subgenre’s flexibility more than filmmaker Michael Simon’s aptly titled Gay Zombie, which focuses primarily on a topic often unexpected in flesh-eating stories: Love.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“When I made Gay Zombie, I thought it would be hilarious and meaningful that the lead character only felt comfortable coming out after becoming a zombie – much more than in his waking life,” says Simon.\n\n…and, although there’s plenty of blood and guts, Michael Simon asserts that his vision of the living dead is less about monstrosity, and more about self-acceptance.\n\nCan the Zombie Be Empowering?\n\n“In the simplest of terms – [the message] is that it’s never too late to find love and be yourself. And to be comfortable with yourself,” says Simon.\n\nIn so many ways, this is what sets the queer zombie subgenre apart – the idea that we can rise up from the earth and be so much more. To be queer in this world is to always be in transition, to be both the perceived monster and that which must survive the night.\n\nTo be the other. To be the lover. To be the revolution.\n\nYes, George Romero set the mold. His vision used monsters to buck the system…and remind us that sometimes the system is the monster that needs bucking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut to be queer is to know that we don’t have to shamble forward aimlessly. We can deviate.\n\nWhether Night, Dawn, or Day. We can live. Kinda.\n\n…and for any naysayers who think that the queer zombie’s ability to represent so much more than mere monster lessens its bite, allow me to leave you with this parting thought from Michael Simon, who says,\n\n“Zombies, like gays, will eat your ass before they take shit from anyone!”\n\n***\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBe sure to keep an eye on Michael Varrati’s next movie, THERE’S A ZOMBIE OUTSIDE, which will be hitting the film festival circuit soon, and looks incredible!\n\nPride is a celebration, and chances are you or someone you know has enjoyed a night of revelry in its name. Sex, drugs, and an ambiguous “I’ll be right back” as your friend heads to an undisclosed location are par for the course and, according to Scream horror buff Randy Meeks, are also the exact reasons you’ll meet your gruesome end. The Rules of Horror – penned for the screen by Kevin Williamson – state that committing any of these cardinal sins will effectively ruin your chances of being canonized as the Final Girl – a term coined in 1992 by professor Carol J. Clover and one you’re undoubtedly familiar with if you’ve found your way to Horror Press. Mere minutes after Randy’s ominous lecture, however, heroine Sidney Prescott takes a bold step toward dismantling these virginal tropes against the patriarchal villains of slasher lore and does the unthinkable: She bangs her boyfriend. Her character created a ripple effect in the genre, evolving the archetype of the Final Girl into something much fiercer and well beyond the decades-long puritanical pearl-clutching writers and directors insisted these women should embody. This Darwinistic trial-by-slasher, which changed what it meant to be a badass female protagonist, begs the question:\n\nWhere are the modern incarnations of a Final Boy, or more appropriately, a Final Gay?\n\nWhile something of a rarity in the genre, horror has had a handful of notable Final Boys, from the legendary Ash Williams of Evil Dead to little Tommy Jarvis and an older Tommy Doyle of F13: The Final Chapter and Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers, respectively, and even Chris Washington in the subversive Get Out. Whereas Final Girls level up beyond the scantily clad lambs of the male gaze, these Final Boys tend to stay in their lane and complete their hero’s journey into that of a fully realized, stereotypical man. Whether that means they become a white knight or something toxically XY depends on the film. Even when the male lead presents as hysterical – a trait history has seen fit to deem outspoken women – until it’s too late, which typically occurs within the confines of the psychological or supernatural subgenres, they tend to “man up” as it were and sacrifice themselves for their loved ones. Unless you’re watching Hostel, we rarely see these Final Boys degraded to nothing more than slabs of meat, and heaven forbid any of them are homosexual or something altogether different.\n\nIf Final Boys are less prevalent than their female counterparts and amount to not much more than fulfilling gender roles when they do appear, you’d be hard-pressed to name more than a few instances of an LGBTQ+ version. You have the problematically depicted and conflicted Jesse of A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 and a small number of queer horror films made by queer creators like Knife + Heart and Death Drop Gorgeous, but otherwise, Pride in horror seems to be relocated to streaming in 2024. It’s terrific that we have shows like Chucky and Interview with the Vampire. Netflix’s Fear Street trilogy was a breath of fresh air when it slashed its way onto our screens during the summer of 2021, but it’s easier for the higher-ups to approve an atypical script when it can get lost in the shuffle of streaming. It’s well known that Gen Z doesn’t go to the movie theater, though they’ll eat up their alternative content from the couch. No one in Hollywood is taking any chances blowing up their four-quadrant summer blockbuster with a lead who kicks up his feet with a vodka soda and the “Chromatica Ball” tour film after saving the world.\n\nSo, in the spirit of this whimsical month celebrating all things Other, it’s time to set the seriousness aside and crank up the sass like you’re slinging memes on Gay Twitter™. Let’s reimagine history and rewrite horror as if the Gay Agenda won the culture wars of yesteryear – and poke a little fun at ourselves in the process. Here’s what could have gone down if your favorite Final Girls were a little more sapphic or swapped out with a Final Gay. If we can’t go to our local AMC to watch a gay couple terrorized by Mask 4 Mask Strangers in a shitty reboot trilogy, we’ll write it ourselves!\n\nTexas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation\n\nThis darkly comedic sequel follows in the absurd footsteps of the second film in the franchise and features a Leatherface who exists solely in drag. Keep backwoods McConaughey and Renée Zellweger, but add a couple of drag queens to the cast, and you’d get a horror version of HBO’s We’re Here. Instead of stopping ole Leather n’ Lace, we’d see Renée and her drag crew help him find self-acceptance and a new chosen family, thus leaving the murder and mayhem behind – and perhaps eventually becoming America’s Next Drag Superstar. Aww!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Craft\n\nI idolize Fairuza Balk as much as the next Witch of WeHo, but if you replaced one of the film’s wiccan wonders with a genderfluid brujo, they’d run that school and, eventually, the world. When someone is so sure of themselves at such a young age, they are unstoppable, and there’s no time for petty revenge when the bottom line is at stake. Moving on up from Los Angeles goth to bitchy Bitcoin billionaire, this witch would harness the power of Menon for everything it’s worth.\n\nScream\n\nWho needs Billy & Stu fanfic when you’ve got a gay male Sidney Prescott (no name change necessary) pining over the deadly duo? If horror’s new age It Girl defied expectations, Gay Sid would fall into every trope and trap faster than Cindy Campbell of Scary Movie. Sis would ignore every red flag that Billy’s sinister eyes and dreamboat hair sashay his way and break every one of Randy’s Rules before Miss Barrymore popped a single kernel of corn. There’s no doubt Gay Sid’s poor choices would have resulted in a Ghostface success story, but at least we’d have seen someone match bestie Tatum’s extreme levels of shade.\n\nTwilight\n\nIt barely constitutes as horror, sure, but imagine the fun we’d all have if you took this poorly-written love triangle and remade it in the image of Luca Guadagnino’s Challengers. Bella pitting her two little monsters against each other as they fight – and kiss – for her affection sells itself, and skin that only sparkles in the sunlight is as clear a metaphor for bisexuality as I’ve ever seen. I’d pay good money to hear Kristen Stewart sneer, “I’m taking such good care of my little alt-bois.”\n\nOrphan\n\nIf you don’t know the twist of this dark horse classic, turn back now. Okay, now imagine if, instead of being an adult woman, Esther was an older twink with a magnificent skincare routine, an Ozempic prescription, and enough filler to resurrect the Titanic. The culture would never be the same.\n\nThe Conjuring\n\nI know I’ve been playfully roasting the community during these what-ifs, but what if James Wan’s family-oriented haunted house classic, The Conjuring featured a non-traditional family unit instead? When you break it down, the franchise ultimately promotes a wholesome message about love and the ties that bind, and it would be rainbow-heartening to watch a queer-led family face the paranormal odds together. Plus, those screams would be wild.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt Follows\n\nAs a metaphor for the intricacies of sex and the tangled web it weaves, It Follows is a masterful slow-burn terror. Set it in the gay community, however, and you’ve got a farcical version of Cruising set to a killer synthy soundtrack. Every pun would be intentional as we scream, “Don’t go in there!” at our queer family as they bob and weave through crowded bars and dimly lit dalliances. Who doesn’t like a genre mashup?\n\nMother!\n\nDarren Aronofsky’s biblical allegory is a nail-biting whirlwind seen through the destruction of a deceptively happy married couple and their perfect home. The term “U-Hauling” jokingly refers to the speed at which lesbian couples take the next step and move in together at a moment’s notice. Meld these two ideas together, and you get a social commentary on the systematic dismantling of the white-picket idealism two women seek out without the interference of men. Life’s a cycle, and the U-Haul runs on a loop.\n\nHappy Death Day\n\nUsing an LGBTQ+ ensemble cast, set this time loop slasher during a Pride parade. Boom. Jessica Roth can come too.\n\nMidsommar\n\nWhen a gay man reaches thirty, he is effectively deceased. When a twenty-something gay man gets married and enters into a life of suburban heteronormativity, it’s called early retirement. Enter Danny, a disillusioned and newly married party boy ready to leave his days in the big city behind and consent to a life of apple picking and candle making. Life in this idyllic upstate New York community is not as it seems…\n\nCrawl\n\nGays tend to be overanalytical and prone to flight over fight. So when a Category 5 hurricane hits Florida and traps college swimmer Haley in the crawlspace of her father’s home as she searches for him during the storm, you had better believe the circumstances would be different if she were a gay man. Instead of being swarmed by alligators, he’d be breast-stroking his way across state lines and out of harm’s way. What are you doing in Florida, of all places, during Pride, anyway? At least hit up Miami and Disney on your way out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPearl\n\nThe titular unhinged icon will stop at nothing to be a star, but what if we replaced her with the ubiquitous chronically online Gay Intern? From star to stan, this ferocious iteration of Ti West’s muse will let the world know exactly which pop divas are the fairest of them all. You think this is a joke, but offend the Barbz or Swifities, and you’ll end up doxxed, delirious, or dead (allegedly).\n\nI don’t know if Carol J. Clover ever expected her work to connect with such a ridiculous article, but we all know the Final Girl ran so that the Final Gay could prance. I’ve frequently lamented the lack of LGBTQ+ protagonists in mainstream media, and if there were ever a genre for us to call home, it’s horror. There are plenty of female-driven stories to tell, but people of all gender identities and sexual orientations deserve a seat at the table, too. So what gives, Hollywood?\n\nP.S. I’m available to write that queer Happy Death Day sequel.\n\nAdvertisement"
