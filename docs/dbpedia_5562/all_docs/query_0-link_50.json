        "meta_description": "On Friday, June 23rd, The Mahoning Drive-In Theater kicks off- our Screenwriter Spotlight series, celebrating those from whose typewriters sprung big-screen classics, when we welcome iconic screenwriter Carl Gottlieb to our theater for a 35mm double feature of JAWS (1975) and THE JERK (1979)! VIP package available.  Carl Gottlieb’s career spans decades of American comedy, from being a member of the 60s improv comedy troupe The Committee, writing for classic TV and variety series like THE SMOTHERS BROTHERS COMEDY HOUR (for which he won an Emmy), to crafting features like JAWS 1-3, THE JERK, CAVEMAN (which he also directed), and DOCTOR DETROIT, as well as writing the best-selling making-of book THE JAWS LOG.  VIP: Early entry at 4p. Exclusive Photo Op with Carl in our 35mm projection booth before main gate!  We’ll begin the evening with one of the most popular thrillers of all-time, Stephen Spielberg’s blockbuster JAWS, starring Roy Scheider as the sheriff of a small Massachusetts Island with a bit of a shark problem… Featuring Carl Gottlieb as Harry Meadows, local Amity reporter.  We follow the sheer terror of aquatic death with the sheer hilarity of Steve Martin in THE JERK, following the rags to riches story of one Navin Johnson, a pigmentally-challenged member of a rural African-American family who sets out on his own to find his way in the world, falling upwards in spectacular fashion. Featuring Carl Gottlieb as Iron Balls McGinty, mafia enforcer.   Carl will be joining us before and between films to meet fans, pose for photo ops, and sign and sell autographs and copies of the latest edition of THE JAWS LOG. His appearance made possible by FrightRags & Neshaminy Creek Brewing Co.  Gates at 6pm each night. Showtime at Sundown.  VIP Photo Op: $30 (per person) *must have General Tix.  General Ticket: $10 (per person) - General+Extended Pass: $20 (per person)  *Special Kids Pricing: $8 General Ticket. (for 13yrs & under). Extended Pass available at gate.
