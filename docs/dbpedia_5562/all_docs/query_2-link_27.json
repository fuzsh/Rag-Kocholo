        "text": "When I first saw Jaws, it was clear to me that it would require an action/adventure score. The film was very different from The Sugarland Express. For Jaws, I imagined something big and operatic, something very theatrical. Most of the discussions I had with Steven at that point were about the shark. The challenge was to find a way to characterize something that’s under water with music rather than with sound effects. These low thumping notes were the result. I thought that altering the speed and volume of the theme, from very slow to very fast, from very soft to very loud, would indicate the mindless attacks of the shark. Steven was a bit skeptical, but when the orchestra performed the piece, it worked better than we had anticipated. Today, at concerts, if I just play two notes of the Jaws theme, people immediately recognize it. I think it’s wonderful when these kinds of musical associations are created and when they make an impression on an audience.\n\nThere were many opportunities in the movie to advertise the shark with music, but also others, such as the scene where kids have put on a fake fin to scare people, where we don’t have any music. Here, the audience experiences a sense of absence, because we’ve conditioned them to expect the predator only when they hear its theme. Then we go a step further for the scenes with the Orca — where we know the shark is there — but his attacks come out of silence, to create further surprise.\n\nJaws had several other musical requirements, such as the “montage,” a classically-styled piece for the arrival of the tourists on the island for the Fourth of July; the action pieces taking place at sea with the Orca and the three heroes chasing the shark; a very dark composition for “Quint’s Tale”; the building of the cage; the climax; and finally the “End Titles” music. But my own favorite cue in Jaws has always been the barrel chase sequence, where the shark approaches the boat and the three heroes think they have captured it. The music accelerates and becomes very exciting and heroic. Suddenly, as the shark overpowers them and eventually escapes, the music deflates and ends with a little sea shanty called “Spanish Lady.” The score musically illustrates and punctuates this entire dramatic outline.\n\nJaws certainly was a landmark in my career. I had won the Academy Award for Fiddler on the Roof, for which I did all the arrangements, underscoring and conducting. But Jaws was the first Oscar I received for my own music, and that was a significant moment for me. Jaws also firmly established my relationship with Steven Spielberg. Working with Steven has been a delight. He has the most wonderful personality and his goal is always to entertain people while also trying to improve the world. He sees problems as opportunities for solutions. It has been a great privilege to be associated with him\n\nJohn Williams (2000)\n\nIn doing a score for Jaws, composer John Williams has outdone himself. The soundtrack is a stunning symphonic achievement and a great leap ahead in the revitalization of film music as a foreground component for the total motion picture experience. He has accomplished on Jaws what Korngold did for The Sea Hawk and Bernard Herrmann for Psycho. Simply, he has made our movie more adventurous, gripping and phobic than I ever thought possible. Right up there with Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss and 7,000 pounds of hungry shark, John Williams’ musical vision plays a leading role.\n\nUnlike so many traditional composer/conductors, John is an artist of numerous styles. He is chameleon-like and vulnerable to the impulses of the film he is about to score. His music on Jaws is unlike any of his previous works, including The Reivers, The Cowboys, Jane Eyre, The Towering Inferno, Paper Chase, The Sugarland Express, Cinderella Liberty, Images and many others including two full symphonies, a symphony for winds, a flute concerto and more. These concert works have been performed by many major orchestras in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nBeing an insatiable collector of film music, I haven’t been this happy with a soundtrack since Dimitri Tiomkin’s The Guns of Navarone. What more can I say. The music fulfilled a vision we all shared.\n\nSteven Spielberg (1975)"
