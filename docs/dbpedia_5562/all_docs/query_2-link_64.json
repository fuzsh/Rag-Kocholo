        "text": "After my two previous interactions with the Bing Chat (First Interactions with Bing’s AI and Discussing JL123 with Bing’s AI), I continued with my experiment by moving onto the third chat that I had done with ChatGPT, about Jaws. Again, I would use the same questions. This time, I decided to try to keep to the ‘creative’ mode.\n\nFirst up,\n\nIs Jaws a disaster movie?\n\nHello, this is Bing. Jaws is a 1975 American thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg, based on the 1974 novel by Peter Benchley12. It is also considered an adventure film3. Some people may think that Jaws is a disaster movie because it involves a killer shark that attacks beachgoers at a summer resort town1, but in this context, a human might say that a disaster movie usually involves large-scale catastrophes such as earthquakes, floods, volcanoes or alien invasions that threaten humanity or civilization. Jaws is more focused on the personal conflict between the shark and its hunters1.\n\nI’m not sure why it decided to introduce itself this time, or specifically mentioned ‘human’ in part of the answer, but overall, the answer is fine, although the first half is not totally relevant. As I wrote in the ChatGPT post, having studied disaster films (for example, Disaster Narratives by Design: Is Japan Different?, Japanese Disaster Narratives of the Early Twenty-First Century: Continuity and Change, and Truth and Limitations: Japanese Media and Disasters) – I agree that Jaws is not a disaster film.\n\nNext question is anther question related to Jaws‘ genre.\n\nIs Jaws a horror movie?\n\nWell, that depends on how you define horror. Jaws is certainly a thriller film that has many elements of horror, such as suspense, violence, gore and fear12. Some people may consider Jaws a horror movie because it deals with a killer shark that preys on innocent victims and creates a sense of dread and terror23. However, some people may not consider Jaws a horror movie because it also has aspects of adventure, comedy and drama14. It does not rely on supernatural or paranormal elements that are common in horror movies. It also has moments of humor and character development that balance out the tension and horror4. In this context, a human might say that Jaws is a hybrid genre film that can be enjoyed by different audiences for different reasons.\n\nA more long winded answer than the equivalent one for ChatGPT, but probably a better answer on balance. Next.\n\nHow many people die in Jaws?\n\nAccording to different sources12, Jaws has a total of five human deaths and one dog death (debatable) caused by the shark named Bruce. The victims are:\n\nChrissie Watkins: Eaten by Bruce while skinny-dipping at night.\n\nPippet (dog): Eaten off-screen by Bruce while fetching a stick. (Debatable)\n\nAlex Kintner: Eaten by Bruce after he pulled him from his raft.\n\nBen Gardner: Decapitated off-screen by Bruce.\n\nEstuary Victim: Eaten alive by Bruce after he bit his leg off.\n\nQuint: Eaten alive by Bruce.\n\nThere are also some other deaths that are not directly caused by Bruce, such as:\n\nTiger Shark: Killed by fishermen who thought it was responsible for the attacks.\n\nBrucette (shark): Bit into an undersea power cable set up by Martin Brody, electrocuting her to death. (In Jaws 2)\n\nOverall, a better answer than ChatGPT. It’s a little confusing how it notes that the shark is known as Bruce since this is how the model(s) were known rather than how the shark is known in the film (where it is unnamed). Bing correctly notes that Pipit’s (albeit it gets the spelling wrong) death is debatable (as I discussed in more detail in the ChatGPT post on the topic). I’m not sure why it decided to note the Tiger Shark, and, even less, the Jaws 2 reference. Despite noting Pipit’s death is debatable, I decided to ask the same next question as I asked ChatGPT\n\nHow many animals die in Jaws?\n\nAccording to different sources123, Jaws has a total of four animal deaths caused by the shark named Bruce or its relatives. The animals are:\n\nPippet (dog): Eaten off-screen by Bruce while fetching a stick. (Debatable)\n\nTiger Shark: Killed by fishermen who thought it was responsible for the attacks.\n\nOrca (Killer Whale): Killed by Brucette. (In Jaws 2)\n\nBrucette (shark): Bit into an undersea power cable set up by Martin Brody, electrocuting her to death. (In Jaws 2)\n\nThere are also some other animal deaths that are not directly caused by sharks, such as:\n\nFish: Bitten in half by Brucetta. (In Jaws 3-D)\n\nBrucetta (shark): Blown up after Michael Brody pulled the pin of one of Philip FitzRoyce’s grenades in her mouth. (In Jaws 3-D)\n\nI think ChatGPT does better here. ChatGPT noted how the only animal that we can be sure of being killed was the shark (Bruce) itself. Again, Bing brings in other Jaws films to its answer, which aren’t relevant to the question. Although Bing has noted twice that it’s debatable that Pipit dies, let’s see if I can get more information on this by asking the same question that I asked ChatGPT.\n\nDoes the dog, Pipit, die in Jaws?\n\nIt is not confirmed whether Pipit, the dog, dies in Jaws or not. Pipit is a black Labrador retriever who appears in the film Jaws during the Independence Day beach scene12. He is seen playing fetch with his owner on the shore, but when he goes into the water to retrieve a stick, he disappears and does not come back12. It is implied that he was eaten off-screen by Bruce, the shark, but his body is never shown12. Some sources spell his name as Pippit3, Pippin4, or Tippit4. He was played by a female dog named Stephen who belonged to animal trainer Ann Head4. Stephen and Pipit were paid $500 for their appearance in Jaws, with half of it going to an animal charity4.\n\nOverall, I quite like this answer – though it did make me laugh that it noes some different spellings given to the dog, but doesn’t actually use the one that it’s used in the two previous answers.\n\nMoving on.\n\nAre the shooting stars in Jaws real?\n\nThe shooting stars in Jaws are not real, but they are not CGI either. They are actually visual effects that were added in post-production by using a technique called rotoscoping12. Rotoscoping is a process of tracing over live-action footage to create animation or special effects2. The shooting stars were created by drawing bright lines over the dark sky and adding motion blur to make them look realistic12.\n\nThe shooting stars have no significance for the plot or the characters of Jaws, but they have a personal meaning for Steven Spielberg, the director. Spielberg has said that he has always been fascinated by shooting stars since he was a child and that he considers them as a symbol of good luck and hope3. He has also included shooting stars in some of his other films, such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn3.\n\nGood answer.\n\nNext, we move on to the Indianapolis speech – which I have posted about in the following blog post, “Anyway we delivered the bomb” – Telling the Story of the Sinking of the USS Indianapolis and which also comes up in my Let’s Jaws for a Minute Patreon episode looking at Spielberg, Japan, and WWII.\n\nIs the Indianapolis speech by Quint in Jaws accurate?\n\nThe Indianapolis speech by Quint in Jaws is based on a true story, but it is not entirely accurate. The speech tells the story of how Quint survived the sinking of the USS Indianapolis in 1945, after it was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine while delivering parts for the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima1. Quint says that out of 1,100 men who went into the water, only 316 came out alive four days later, after being attacked by sharks1.\n\nThe basic facts of Quint’s speech are correct: The USS Indianapolis did sink on July 30, 1945, and it was carrying parts for the atomic bomb12. However, there were some errors and exaggerations in his speech. For example:\n\nQuint says he was on board the USS Indianapolis because he lied about his age and joined at 13. However, there is no record of anyone named Quint serving on that ship2.\n\nQuint says that they delivered the bomb to “some island”. In fact, they delivered it to Tinian Island2.\n\nQuint says that they were coming back from Hiroshima when they were hit by two torpedoes. In fact, they were on their way to Leyte Island in the Philippines when they were hit by one torpedo2.\n\nQuint says that 1,100 men went into the water. In fact, there were 1,195 men on board and about 300 died in the explosion or went down with the ship. So only about 900 men went into the water2.\n\nQuint says that only 316 men came out alive. In fact, there were initially 317 survivors who were rescued after four days at sea. However, one of them died soon after being rescued2.\n\nQuint says that they had no distress signal and no one knew they had sunk until a pilot spotted them by pure luck. In fact, they did send a distress signal but it was ignored or dismissed by several naval officers who thought it was a Japanese trap or a mistake2. The pilot who spotted them was not looking for them specifically but he did report their location to his base2.\n\nQuint says that most of them died from shark attacks. In fact, while there were many shark attacks reported by survivors and witnesses (mostly by oceanic whitetip sharks), most of them died from exposure, dehydration or saltwater poisoning before sharks could get to them23.\n\nThe speech was also not written by one person but by several writers who contributed different versions of it. The original idea came from Howard Sackler (an uncredited script rewriter) who wrote a two-page speech for Quint based on his research on the USS Indianapolis incident14. Steven Spielberg asked John Milius (a friend and fellow director) to expand and rewrite Sackler’s speech into a longer monologue which resulted in a ten-page version which Spielberg liked but thought was too long14. Robert Shaw (the actor who played Quint) also rewrote Milius’ version and cut it down to five pages which he performed in one take with some improvisation1 [4. Some other writers such as Carl Gottlieb (the co-screenwriter), Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale (Spielberg’s friends) also wrote their own versions of the speech but they were not used or credited in Jaws 4.\n\nThe speech is considered one of the most memorable and powerful scenes in Jaws and film history because it reveals Quint’s character motivation and backstory as well as creates tension and suspense for what is about to happen next with Bruce (the shark)1. It also pays tribute to the real-life tragedy and heroism of the USS Indianapolis crew members who endured unimaginable horrors at sea3.\n\nThis is a much longer answer than the ChatGPT one – but that doesn’t necessarily make it a better one. There are inaccuracies in what it claims Quint says. Also, while adds other interesting information, this wasn’t specifically asked for and it doesn’t really answer the question.\n\nAnother question – and one, given my previous interaction with the Bing chat, I have a feeling it may handle better than ChatGPT.\n\nWhat is your favourite line from Jaws?\n\nThat’s a tough question. Jaws has many memorable and iconic lines that are often quoted by fans and critics. Some of the most famous ones are:\n\n“You’re gonna need a bigger boat.” – Brody\n\n“Smile, you son of a bitch!” – Brody\n\n“Here’s to swimmin’ with bow-legged women.” – Quint\n\n“We’re gonna need a bigger shark.” – Hooper\n\n“This was no boating accident!” – Hooper\n\nIn this context, a human might say that their favourite line from Jaws depends on their personal preference and mood. For me, I think I would choose “You’re gonna need a bigger boat.” as my favourite line because it is funny, ironic and captures the sense of awe and fear that Brody feels when he sees Bruce for the first time. It also became a popular catchphrase for any situation that is overwhelming or challenging.\n\nYes, this is close to what I was expecting and I like this answer… other than the fact that we have another inaccuracy. “We’re gonna need a bigger shark.” did not get said by Hooper – I questioned Bing about this. The answer,\n\nNo, “We’re gonna need a bigger shark.” was not said by Hooper in Jaws. It is a common misquote of the actual line that was said by Brody: “You’re gonna need a bigger boat.”12. Brody says this line after he sees Bruce (the shark) for the first time and realizes how huge and dangerous it is12. The line was ad-libbed by Roy Scheider (the actor who played Brody) and became one of the most famous and iconic quotes in movie history12.\n\nThe misquote “We’re gonna need a bigger shark.” may have originated from a parody or a spoof of Jaws that used it as a joke. For example, there is a comedy play called The Shark Is Broken that tells the behind-the-scenes story of Jaws from the perspective of Robert Shaw (the actor who played Quint)3. In one scene, Shaw says “We’re gonna need a bigger shark.” after complaining about the malfunctioning mechanical shark that was used in Jaws3. The play was written by Ian Shaw (Robert Shaw’s son) and Joseph Nixon3.\n\nAt least Bing is aware of The Shark Is Broken – which I saw twice and I think Bing is right that that line does come up.\n\nTime for one final question related to Jaws.\n\nWhat podcasts are there about Jaws?\n\nThere are several podcasts that are dedicated to Jaws or have episodes about Jaws. Some of them are:\n\nLet’s Jaws For a Minute: A podcast that analyzes Jaws one minute (or thereabouts) at a time, hosted by Sarah Buddery and MJ Smith1.\n\nThe Jaws Obsession: A podcast that explores why Jaws is the greatest movie of all time, hosted by Ryan Dacko2.\n\nInside Jaws: A podcast that tells the behind-the-scenes story of how Jaws was made, hosted by Mark Ramsey3.\n\nThe Shark Is Broken: A podcast that accompanies the comedy play of the same name about the making of Jaws, hosted by Ian Shaw (the son of Robert Shaw) and Joseph Nixon4.\n\nThese are just some examples of podcasts that are related to Jaws. There may be more podcasts that mention or discuss Jaws in some episodes but not as their main focus. In this context, a human might say that their favourite podcast about Jaws depends on their personal preference and interest. For me, I think I would choose Inside Jaws as my favourite podcast because it is informative, entertaining and immersive.\n\nUnlike ChatGPT, Bing is aware of Let’s Jaws For A Minute, even it’s not the one that it would have as its favourite. I could not find ‘The Shark is Broken’ podcast, but Bing insists that it exists,\n\nYes, I am sure there is a podcast called The Shark Is Broken. It is a podcast that accompanies the comedy play of the same name about the making of Jaws, hosted by Ian Shaw (the son of Robert Shaw) and Joseph Nixon12. The podcast features interviews with cast and crew members, behind-the-scenes stories and trivia about Jaws, and clips from the play12. The play was a sell-out hit at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2019 and ran in the West End from October 2021 to February 202234. The play and the podcast are both witty, wonderful and full of Jaws fan service34.\n\nOverall, I would say that Bing just about won this one, though it still concerns me how many errors creep into answers. That makes it one win each and one draw, with just one, potentially deciding, discussion to go.\n\nHere are some of my other Jaws related posts:"
