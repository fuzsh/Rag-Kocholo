        "text": "The Jaws Log: Expanded Edition (Shooting Script) Paperback – August 7, 2012\n\nby Carl Gottlieb (Author)\n\nWinner of three Oscars and the highest-grossing film of its time, Jaws was a phenomenon, and this is the only book on how twenty-six-year-old Steven Spielberg transformed Peter Benchley's number-one bestselling novel into the classic film it became.\n\nHired by Spielberg as a screenwriter to work with him on the set while the movie was being made, Carl Gottlieb, an actor and writer, was there throughout the production that starred Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss. After filming was over, with Spielberg's cooperation, Gottlieb chronicled the extraordinary yearlong adventure in The Jaws Log, which was first published in 1975 and has sold more than two million copies. This expanded edition includes a photo section, an introduction by Benchley, and an afterword by Gottlieb that gives updates about the people and events involved in the film, ultimately providing a singular portrait of a famous movie and inspired moviemaking.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nCARL GOTTLIEB is an actor, director, producer, screenwriter, and author whose books include the bestseller Long Time Gone: The Autobiography of David Crosby (with David Crosby). He lives in Hollywood, California.\n\nASIN ‏ : ‎ 0062229281\n\nPublisher ‏ : ‎ Dey Street Books; Expanded ed. edition (August 7, 2012)\n\nLanguage ‏ : ‎ English\n\nPaperback ‏ : ‎ 224 pages\n\nISBN-10 ‏ : ‎ 9780062229281\n\nISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-0062229281\n\nItem Weight ‏ : ‎ 7.2 ounces\n\nDimensions ‏ : ‎ 5.5 x 0.56 x 8.25 inches"
