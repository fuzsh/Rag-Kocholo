        "text": "Hi, I’m Carl Gottlieb, a pragmatic Brit with a passion for privacy, tech and business. Professionally I’m the trusted privacy advisor to leading tech companies, helping them gain maximum advantage through the right privacy strategy. My clients include Duolingo (the largest education app on the App Store) and Hudl (the global leader in sports analytics). I describe myself as an “Iceberg Spotter”, helping organisations understand the privacy risks floating their way and advising them on how to keep their ship sailing at full speed. It’s my job to help tech companies succeed at what they do best by making privacy compliance a net positive.\n\nAll this means that I get to work with some fantastic people and experience a wide array of challenges, approaches and solutions to cutting edge privacy problems. I’m now in my 23rd year in the industry and the future looks as exciting as ever.\n\nMy consultancy company Cognition has a great team of people doing amazing things in privacy and security, including providing Data Protection Officers, in-depth assessments and virtual security engineers. Their talent, dedication and attitude inspire me every day.\n\nI have a privacy podcast (The GDPR Guy) and I blog about privacy and provide how-to guides on ePrivacy & cookie banners on this website. I occasionally appear in the written press or on TV and radio interviews and you might bump into me speaking at a conference.\n\nOutside of work my focus is my family and being the best dad and husband I can be."
