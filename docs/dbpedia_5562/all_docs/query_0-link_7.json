        "text": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. – Forty-four years after it invented the summer blockbuster and changed going to the beach forever, “Jaws” is coming to town.\n\nThe 1975 movie remains one of the top-grossing films of all time, and launched the career of director Steven Spielberg.\n\nStars Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss, the men battle the monster great white shark menacing the fictional town of Amity, became household names.\n\nAny time there’s a shark attack anywhere in the world, it’s time to cue up that ominous John Williams theme music.\n\nThe film will be shown at the St. George Theatre on July 25 as part of the theatre’s “Better on the Big Scree” classic movie series. “Jaws” screenwriter Carl Gottlieb will be on hand to talk about what it was like to work on and act in one of the most iconic films in Hollywood history.\n\n“I love to see it in a big theatre,” he told the Advance during a recent phone interview. “On the big screen, that’s where it has most of its power.\"\n\nThe veteran comedy writer and actor, who’d done script work for “The Odd Couple” and other 1970s sitcoms, was a friend of Spielberg’s and had been hired to play local newspaperman Harry Meadows in “Jaws.”\n\nIt was only as shooting approached that Spielberg had Gottlieb take a crack at the script. Earlier drafts by Peter Benchley, who’d written the runaway bestseller that the film was based on, and Howard Sackler didn’t cut it.\n\n“He sent me the script with a note on the cover, which I saved, saying ‘Eviscerate it,’” Gottlieb said.\n\nSo Gottlieb bunked in a house with Spielberg on location on Martha’s Vineyard and did a total overhaul of the script. Those movie lines we’ve been quoting for the last four decades are Gottlieb’s.\n\nSome of Gottlieb’s favorite contributions: The quote from oceanographer Matt Hooper, played by Dreyfuss, “I’m not going to waste my time arguing with a man who’s lining up to be a hot lunch.” And the speech where shark-attack victim Alex Kintner’s mother slaps Sheriff Martin Brody, played by Scheider.\n\n“There’s a lot of it that I like still,” he said.\n\nThe caustic relationship between Hooper and shark hunter Quint, played by Shaw, evolved on-set, Gottlieb said, where the actors were allowed to improvise freely.\n\n“The actors got into the habit of tweaking each other and teasing each other,” Gottlieb said. “They’d be friends off-set, but the closer they got to the set and the scene, the snippier they would get with each other, until you got that tension you see on screen between the two of them.”\n\nGottlieb said that the moment the shark appears on screen for the first time, when Brody is dumping bloody bait into the water, was a slam-dunk from the beginning.\n\n“Everybody, even the guys in the [film] lab, jumped when that happened,” he said.\n\nSpielberg had only directed one feature film when he took on “Jaws,” and while some thought the 27-year-old director had bitten off more than he could chew, Gottlieb said Spielberg was in total command.\n\n“He had a vision in his head that was unwavering,” he said. “I knew Steven was tense. The giveaway was that he would bite his fingernails. They were really bitten. But nobody saw him sweat.”\n\nThere was also grumbling from Martha’s Vineyard landowners and renters, who saw their tony Massachusetts island retreat taken over by the production.\n\n“A lot of the regulars who paid a great deal of money to summer there, the roads were blocked with trucks,” Gottlieb said. “We were on the beaches. Wherever people wanted to go, there was the shooting company, messing things up.”\n\nLocal merchants, however, “loved us,” said Gottlieb, “because we brought millions of dollars into the local economy.”\n\nHe said the fact that many of the extras on the film were non-actor local residents gave the film a realistic feel that made the terror in the water all the more believable.\n\n“We were able to make it relatable,” said Gottlieb, who wrote a book, “The Jaws Log,” about his experiences on the film.\n\nFor Gottlieb, the film’s staying power is about “a villain that everybody loves to hate,” the shark, and “the trio of heroes that represents the world”: Brody’s everyman, Hooper’s intellectual, and Quint, “the primal man on a mission to kill the shark.”\n\n“The balance of those three guys is the balance all humans face,” he said.\n\nHe said he’s looking forward to seeing “Jaws” again.\n\n“It’s like a well-made watch,” he said. “All the pieces fit together, and it just keeps ticking.”"
