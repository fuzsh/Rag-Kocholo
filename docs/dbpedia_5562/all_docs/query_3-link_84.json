        "text": "Carl began writing comedy for TV, contributing to The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour for which he won an Emmy Award in 1969, The Music Scene, The Bob Newhart Show, All in the Family, and The Odd Couple. Minor acting roles have included Robert Altman's M*A*S*H and the film Clueless.\n\nGottlieb also cowrote David Crosby's two autobiographies, 1989's Long Time Gone and 2006's Since Then.\n\nGottlieb was hired as an actor to appear as Harry Meadows, the editor of the local newspaper, in Jaws. He was hired by his friend, Steven Spielberg, to redraft the script, adding more dimensions to the characters, particularly humour. Ironically, his redrafts reduced the role of Meadows (who still appears in the Town Hall corridor and the Tiger Shark scene).\n\nHe wrote a book, The Jaws Log, about the notoriously difficult production of the film. Bryan Singer has referred to it as being \"like a little movie director bible\".[1]"
