With the support of the Conservative and Labour party leaders, David Lloyd George replaced Prime Minister Henry Herbert (H. H.) Asquith. He had risen through Minister of Munitions and Secretary of State before his criticism of Asquith enabled him to become the British Prime Minister for the remainder of the war. He was subsequently elected in a landslide victory in 1918.
