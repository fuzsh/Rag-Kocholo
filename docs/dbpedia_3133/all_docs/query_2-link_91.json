        "text": "Donald Mccormick, a British historian and foreign news manager of The (London) Sunday Times, aptly quotes in his new and highly entertaining book the famous judgment on David Lloyd George made by J. M. Keynes (whom Mr. McCormick insists on calling Maynard Keynes): “This extraordinary figure of our time, this goat‐footed bard, this half‐human visitor to our time from the hag‐ridden magic and enchanted woods of Celtic antiquity.”\n\nIn choosing the title, “The Mask of Merlin,” Mr. McCormick has decided to emphasize the Welshness of Lloyd George. (He grew up in Wales; he was in fact Anglo‐Irish in origin, and the greatest man ever born in Manchester, England.) Lloyd George was not only a Welshman, but a passionate Welshman and one who made a profitable career out of Welshness. In 1890 he was elected as a Liberal to Parliament, and he represented the same Welsh constituency for 54 years. Of those who called him the “Welsh wizard,” half were bitter enemies and half admiring and baffled friends. He was Merlin; he was Morgan le Fay; he was Sir Lancelot from time to time. But he was never Sir Galahad (nor was he what one impassioned orator once called him, “the greatest man since Christ”). His strength did not come because bis heart was pure, and few mottoes could have . been less appropriate than the one he chose upon being made an earl in extreme old age: “Truth against the world.”\n\nTo the younger generation in Britain and in America, Lloyd George seems like a first run of Churchill. A radical and antiimperialist in Parliament (he fiercely opposed toe South African War), he became Chancellor of the Exchequer under Prime Minister Herbert Asquith in 1908, then Minister of Munitions in 1915, then Minister of War in 1916. Less than six months later, he replaced Asquith as Prime Minister in a new coalition cabinet (a “treason” Asquithian Liberals never forgave) and was largely responsible for the unification of Allied military command under Marshall Foch. After Versailles the Conservatives withdrew from the coalition, and his ministry fell; his great days wereover by 1929 at the latest. After that, he indulged in follies and worse than follies; he praised Hitler, wrote dangerous sophistries for William Randolph Hearst, refused to serve under Churchill during World War II, and died in 1945 an old, largely discredited and largely forgotten man.\n\nYET he had been a great figure, and there were and are many who think he was, at any rate from time to time, a great man. About a year ago I attended a private London dinner at which all the others present had played important roles in World War I. None of them had trusted Lloyd George, yet each agreed that he was, for all his faults, a great man and had “done the state some service,” particularly as a war minister. Even the hostile Keynes testifies to his astonishing power of fascination. Some of his bitterest enemies were temporarily won over; and, although it is almost impossible to read with admiration his Welsh oratory. today, he was probably the only complete master of an audience in the Britain of his time.\n\nOn the other hand, few men had more virulent and bitter enemies. Men who were not vindictive, who took the rough‐andtumble of politics philosophically, yet detested Lloyd George. I see no reason to doubt that the late Stanley Baldwin genuinely believed he had performed a great public service in ending the effective political career of Lloyd George during the 1936 abdication crisis. (Lloyd George took the King's side and might have made a comeback in a “King's Party” coalition, had not Baldwin roused himself from his usual lethargy and forced the abdication before Lloyd George, who was on a holiday in Jamaica, could mobilize public opinion.)\n\nHe was accused of personal corruption to a degree unknown in modern British politics. He had around him, in his great days as Prime Minister, close associates and servants who would have been at home in the Washington of President Grant or Harding. No one has yet disentangled the story of bis private, politically begotten fortune. The gossip that has surrounded his sex life probably does not exceed reality. Some of the less agreeable features of bis character have been revealed to the public in books by his brother and his son. And yet...\n\nMr. McCormick is an almost totally hostile narrator of the astonishing career of the poor Welsh boy who became the first real common man to enter 10 Downing Street. On Lloyd George's services in World War he is certainly hostile, and uncritically so. He gives Lloyd George credit for forcing the convoy system on the British Navy—and, indeed, the conduct of the Admiralty on this question was an extraordinary mix- ture of stupidity and vanity. But that is about the only credit the author gives Lloyd George. When it comes to cracking down, in similar fashion, on the Army, Mr. McCormick's criteria for judgment seem to change. Tet I cannot see why, if Lloyd George was right in his actions toward the admirals, he should not also be considered right in his actions toward the generals; surely Admiral Lord Jellicoe was at least as valuable a public servant as Field‐Marshal Lord Haig.\n\nYet this book has very great merits. His very partisanship makes Mr. McCormick a witness of a kind, if only a witness to hatred. And he does not always attack Lloyd George as vehemently as others have done. He does not have much to say for his subject's role in the Hitler years, but he finds more than I would. Unfortunately, he ignores some very important parts of his life story: the account of his role at the Versailles peace conference is most inadequate in extent and depth. He is also extremely credulous, and some undoubtedly apocryphal stories are taken at face value.\n\nIn short, Mr. McCormick in his savage attack has been defeated by his subject, just as . all previous biographers have been. There was nothing of the noble Roman about Lloyd George, as there was about Asquith, and nothing of the versatile Greek, as there was and is about Sir Winston Churchill; I think that Mr. McCormick is right that Lloyd George did very great damage to the political life of Great Britain by his contempt for ordinary moral standards. But to get Baldwin in on a clean‐up job was a high price to pay indeed."
