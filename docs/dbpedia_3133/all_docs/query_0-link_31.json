        "text": "Herbert Henry Asquith, 1st Earl of Oxford and Asquith (12 September 1852 – 15 February 1928) was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 5 April 1908 to 5 December 1916, succeeding Henry Campbell-Bannerman and preceding David Lloyd George. He was one of the last great leaders of the UK Liberal Party.\n\nBiography[]\n\nHerbert Henry Asquith was born in Morley, Yorkshire, England on 12 September 1852. He overcame a difficult childhood, as he was orphaned at the age of eight; however, he attended Oxford University and became a lawyer. In 1886, he was elected to Parliament as the Liberal MP for East Fife, and he caught general attention as a brilliant debater. He served as Foreign Secretary from 1892 to 1895, despite having not held any previous post in government. He lost some ground in his party during the Second Boer War, as he did not oppose the conflict, but he defended free trade and became a prominent politician once more. In 1905, he served as Chancellor of the Exchequer under Prime Minister Henry Campbell-Bannerman, and he introduced a new system of income tax rates in 1907 and introduced old-age pensions in 1908."
