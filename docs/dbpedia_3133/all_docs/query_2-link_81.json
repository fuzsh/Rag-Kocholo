        "text": "Having been brought up in North Wales, Lloyd George qualified as a solicitor before winning a by-election as a Liberal in the tightly contested seat of Caernarfon Borough in 1890 aged 27.\n\nIn 1906 he was made President of the Board of Trade, before being promoted to Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1908, a post he held until 1915.\n\nShortly after the outbreak of the First World War, George was appointed Minister of Munitions. He held that post until he was appointed Prime Minister (PM) in December 1916.\n\nGeorge held office during the final years of the First World War. In 1919, he signed the Treaty of Versailles which led to the establishment of the League of Nations and the war reparations settlement."
