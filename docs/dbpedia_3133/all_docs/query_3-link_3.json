A man of great energy and dynamism, he was widely touted as the man who had won the war and promised… ‘a land fit for heroes’. The Anglo-Irish Treaty led to the establishment of the Irish Free State.

Conservative 1923-24 Stanley Baldwin – Just a few months into office and much to the surprise of all around him, Baldwin called an early general election on the issue of protectionist trade tariffs. The policy was an attempt to resolve Britain’s economic problems, it achieved however, the remarkable feat of reuniting the Liberals and letting Labour into power for the first time. Conservative 1924 James Ramsay MacDonald – The very first Labour Prime Minister, MacDonald came from a Scottish working class background. As head of a minority government, he was reliant on the support of the Liberals. Frustrated by his inability to introduce meaningful legislation he called an early election. Labour 1924-29 Stanley Baldwin – In his second term in office, Baldwin was responsible for several notable social achievements including extending the right to vote to women aged over 21. He amazed the political world by inviting Winston Churchill, who at that time was a Liberal MP, to be his Chancellor of the Exchequer. He successfully steered the country through the rocky waters of the General Strike of 1926. Conservative 1929-31 Ramsey MacDonald – In his second minority government, MacDonald appointed the first ever female minister, Margaret Bondfield. Just a few months into his term however, the world was shaken by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Great Deppression that followed. Labour 1931-35 Ramsey MacDonald – With his Labour government divided on how to resolve an economic crisis that included the doubling of unemployment levels; MacDonald resigned but was reappointed at the head of a national coalition government (with support from the Conservative and Liberal parties). This move cost him the support of his own party and he once again resigned national coalition 1935-37 Stanley Baldwin – Returning to office for the third time, his major achievement in this last phase of his career was to steer the country through the abdication of King Edward VIII in 1936. Recognising the threat of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, Baldwin started a programme of re-arming the country. He was later criticised for not doing more to prepare. Conservative\n\nLloyd George, Stanley Baldwin, Sir Winston Churchill\n\n1937-40 Neville Chamberlain – When Baldwin retired after the coronation of George VI, Chamberlain was the obvious choice for leader of the party. Following a meeting with Adolf Hitler in Munich 1938, he famously returned declaring “I believe it is peace for our time”. Following the invasion of Poland, Chamberlain declared war on Germany on 3 September, 1939. Conservative 1940-45 Sir Winston Churchill – Following Chamberlain’s resignation, Churchill was appointed as Prime Minister of an all-party coalition government. The speeches he made through his first summer in charge established a policy of ‘no surrender’, and the subsequent military alliances that he formed with both the USA and Soviet Union steered the Allies to victory in World War II. Shortly after VE Day, Churchill was surprisingly defeated in a General Election. coalition 1945-51 Clement Attlee – After leading Labour to a landslide victory, Attlee quickly set about implementing his parties manifesto pledges. Despite the country effectively bankrupt after the war, he managed the creation of the National Health Service in 1946. His ‘cradle to grave’ philosophy made healthcare free for all British citizens. In addition to this, many of Britain’s largest industries such as coal mining (1946), electricity (1947) and the railways (1947) were brought under state control. In just a few short years he nationalised one fifth of the entire British economy. In 1949 his National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act would open up vast swathes of the British countryside to the general public for the first time. Labour 1951-55 Sir Winston Churchill – Churchill’s second term in office was greatly influenced by his failing health. One contemporary even described him as “gloriously unfit for office”. 1953 was perhaps a year which Churchill appreciated most, with all the historic pomp and glory that accompanied the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. In matters abroad, the developing Cold War led him to authorise the manufacture of the British hydrogen bomb in 1955, or in Churchill’s words ‘arming to parley’. Later that year his deteriorating health forced him to resign, making way for his Foreign Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister, Anthony Eden. Conservative 1955-57 Sir Anthony Eden – Widely recognized as Winston Churchill’s successor, as Prime Minister he immediately called a general election and increased the Conservative majority. His success was to be short-lived however, as Eden is best know for his controversial handling of the Suez crisis in 1956. Following a badly executed invasion intended to seize control of the Suez Canal in Egypt, there was widespread international condemnation and following a threat of US sanctions, Eden was forced into a humiliating withdrawal. Isolated, Eden resigned having demonstrated to the world that Britain was no longer the superpower it once was. Conservative 1957-63 Harold Macmillan – Following the resignation of Sir Anthony Eden, Macmillan emerged from the wreckage of the Suez crisis to lead a demoralised Conservative party and country. Having told the queen that his new government would only last weeks, Macmillan quickly went on to restore the nation’s confidence and fortunes. As living standards and prosperity increased, ‘Supemac’ was able to claim that the British public had “never had it so good”. In terms of foreign affairs, he helped to negotiate the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and speeded up the decolonisation of the British Empire. By the end of his term the country’s economy was beginning to falter and after a series of scandals he resigned. Conservative 1963-64 Sir Alec Douglas-Home – Following Harold Macmillan’s sudden resignation, Douglas-Home emerged as the new leader of the Conservative party. As Prime Minister for just 363 days, he holds the record as serving the second shortest premiership of the 20th century. Conservative 1964-70 Harold Wilson – Winning the October election with a majority of just 4, Wilson’s plan was to modernise the country, aided by the “white heat of the technological revolution”. His government introduced liberalising laws in the fields of capital punishment, abortion, homosexuality and divorce. On the issue of the economy, the powerful trade-union bosses refused to be controlled, resulting in a rise in unemployment and inflation. Labour\n\nSir Anthony Eden, Harold Wilson, Edward Heath\n\n1970-74 Edward Heath – Heath’s premiership was one of the most traumatic and controversial in recent history. A period of great industrial upheaval and economic decline, his major ‘achievement’ was leading Britain into the European Common Market. Heath’s attempts to weaken the power of the trade unions failed; the resulting strikes led to the lights going out across country for three days each week. His premiership also coincided with the heights of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Conservative 1974-76 Harold Wilson -During his second term in office income tax on top earners increased to 83% and unemployment reached 1 million. By early 1976 Britain’s economic situation was so dire that a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was considered to be the government’s only option. To the surprise of all concerned and just 5 days after his 60th birthday, Wilson resigned suddenly, making way for the older James Callaghan. Labour 1976-79 James Callaghan – With inflation running at 17% and 1.5 million unemployed, Callaghan made the controversial decision to ask the IMF for an emergency loan. In return for $3.9 billion of credits, he attempted to impose tighter monetary control through wage restrictions for public sector workers. The unions’ reaction to this was a wave of strikes that saw the dead not buried and rubbish lining the streets of Britain, uncollected. The winter of 1978-9 become known as the ‘Winter of Discontent’. Callaghan failed to win a vote of ‘no confidence’. Labour 1979-90 Margaret Thatcher – The industrial unrest brought about by the ‘Winter of Discontent’ saw Mrs Thatcher elected the first female British Prime Minister. Branded the ‘Iron Lady’, her early years in power resulted in only a marginal improvement in the economy. The defining moment of her premiership came in April 1982, when she led the country to war against Argentina in the Falkland Islands. The successful outcome of the campaign transformed her standing in the opinion polls. Conservative 1990-97 John Major – After spending billions trying to protect his pet economic policy – membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism – his premiership would go on to see the UK’s longest period of continuous economic growth. His government started talks with the IRA seeking a peaceful end to the Troubles in Northern Ireland.
