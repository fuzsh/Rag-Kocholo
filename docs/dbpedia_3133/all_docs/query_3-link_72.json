        "text": "The story of the trial of Alice Wheeldon and her family – a miscarriage of justice perpetrated in 1917 at London’s Old Bailey\n\n“Alice Wheeldon’s is the history of a woman, of a family, of a neighbourhood, and of a wider network of people who sought to make the world a better place through women’s rights, pacifism and then opposition to conscription. All these strands intersect in the events that led to her conviction and imprisonment in 1917, and in the consequences of the trial, which scattered the Wheeldon family across the globe.”\n\nWomen and War: from the series ‘Beyond Commemoration: Community, Collaboration and Legacies of the First World War’\n\nIn 1916, during the First World War, Alice Wheeldon was living with her family in Derby, England. As the main income earner, she supported the household through buying and selling high-quality second-hand clothes.\n\nAlice and her husband, William Augustus, had four adult children: three daughters (Nellie, Hettie and Winnie) and a son, William Marshall (Will), who was a conscientious objector. Hettie (aged 25) and Nellie (27) lived in Derby with their parents; Winnie (23) had moved to Southampton with her pharmacist husband, Alf Mason.\n\nThe family were all active campaigners for many social issues of the time, notably women's suffrage and emancipation, pacifism and opposition to conscription. The war had split the women’s suffrage movement, with a more conservative wing encouraging enlistment.\n\nThe carnage of war drags on\n\nWith the controversial introduction of general conscription in May 1916, there was desperate concern for the young men who were conscientious objectors and the British Government’s treatment of these ‘conchies’. People were scared and angry. It was a year when Britons were increasingly horrified by the continuing and pointless carnage of the war, some calling for a negotiated peace. But the forces for a fight to the bitter end won out.\n\nOn 7 December 1916, David Lloyd George succeeded H. H. Asquith as Prime Minister. Lloyd George had been at the heart of the War Cabinet as Minister of Munitions and the Secretary of State for War, and a vocal proponent of conscription.\n\nUndercover agent approaches the Wheeldon household\n\nOn 21 December 1916, an undercover agent using the name ‘Alex’ (or ‘Alec’) ‘Gordon’ was sent to Derby from Liverpool by Herbert Booth, an employee of an obscure branch of the Ministry of Munitions known as PMS2. Posing as a conscientious objector seeking accommodation, ‘Gordon’ was referred to Hettie Wheeldon, who had until recently been the local secretary of the No-Conscription Fellowship, and to her mother, Alice Wheeldon.\n\n‘Gordon’ visited the Wheeldons for the first time on 26 December. After sharing a meal with them, he was referred to lodgings elsewhere by Hettie Wheeldon. He returned to the Wheeldon household the next day, 27 December 1916.\n\nOn 27 December 1916, ‘Gordon’ telegraphed Booth asking him to come to Derby – it would later emerge that he wanted to alert his superiors to a supposed ‘plot’ that he claimed to have uncovered through his conversations with the Wheeldons. Booth then travelled by train to Derby where he was met by ‘Gordon’.\n\n‘Gordon’ introduced Booth to Alice Wheeldon on the evening of 29 December 1916 as ‘Comrade Bert’, another conscientious objector.\n\nDiscovery of poison leads to arrest for conspiracy\n\nOn 1 January 1917 a parcel was intercepted at the Derby railway station. It contained poison that had been sent from Southampton by Alice Wheeldon’s daughter, Winnie Mason, and supplied by Winnie’s husband, Alfred Mason, a pharmacist.\n\nThis parcel of poison formed the basis of the Crown case.\n\nAlice Wheeldon and her daughters Harriet (Hettie) Wheeldon and Winnie Mason, along with Alfred Mason, were arrested on 30 January 1917. They were charged on 3 February 1917 with conspiring to murder (and soliciting and proposing the murder of) the Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, and Sir Arthur Henderson, Labour leader and a member of the small War Cabinet.\n\nThe Crown’s case was that Alice Wheeldon had suggested to ‘Gordon’ that she would procure poison for ‘Gordon’ to assassinate Lloyd George and Henderson.\n\nThe defence case was that Alice had believed ‘Gordon’ to be a conscientious objector who would help her with an ‘emigration scheme’ for her son and two others, in return for her assistance in helping his friends who wished to escape from an internment camp. Alice said she had agreed to get the poison for ‘Gordon’ at his request: she said he had told her it was to kill guard dogs at the internment camp.\n\nAlthough members of the Derby community formed a Defence Fund, they had difficulty in finding lawyers prepared to defend Alice and her family. Alice’s husband William accepted the offer from Sayed Riza, barrister, to represent Alice, their daughters Hettie and Winnie, and their son-in-law Alf Mason.\n\nHigh-profile trial leads to convictions for Alice, Winnie and Alf"
