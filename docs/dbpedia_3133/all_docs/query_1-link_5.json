        "text": "Although convinced of the legitimacy of Britain's declaration of war against Germany in 1914, Asquith was reluctant immediately to extend government power to create an economy suited to fight an industrial war on a vast scale.\n\nHis 'business as usual' approach was accompanied by a process of decision-making in which Asquith deliberately and respectfully acknowledged the expertise of his military commanders.\n\nIn May 1915, after reports of munitionsâ€™ shortages on the Western Front, squabbles between Lord Fisher and Winston Churchill at the Admiralty, and failures at Gallipoli, Asquith was forced into a coalition government with the Conservatives.\n\nBut he remained the focal point for blame for all military, naval and policy setbacks. He was increasingly sidelined in strategic decision-making and ultimately outmanoeuvred by Lloyd George.\n\nAsquith resigned as Prime Minister on 5 December 1916."
