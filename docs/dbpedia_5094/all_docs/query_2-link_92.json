        "text": "Career\n\nFrom 1830 onward Gautier was productive in poetry, novels, short stories, criticism, and travel sketches.\n\nHe is the great apostle of \"art for art's sake.\n\n\"In February 1830, Gautier was the most brilliant of the young men supporting Victor Hugo against the classical critics; the scarlet doublet which he wore at the premi&egrave; repremiere of Hugo's Hernani has become legendary.\n\nRejecting the romantic ideal of grandiose nature, he rejected likewise its ideal love.\n\nRarely a creator but always an impeccable craftsman, Gautier gave a much needed corrective to the undisciplined style of the romantics.\n\nUnfortunately, Gautier's verse does not have emotional or intellectual content equal to its perfection of form.\n\n&#201; mauxEmaux et Cam&#233; esCamees (1852) is his best and most characteristic collection.\n\nIt includes the famous Art, in which Gautier sets up technical difficulty as a prime requirement of art.\n\nThus his long novel Le Capitaine Fracasse (1863) is a rehandling of the 17th-century Roman comique of Paul Scarron.\n\nGautier's prose works include also the posthumously published Histoire du romantisme (1874)."
