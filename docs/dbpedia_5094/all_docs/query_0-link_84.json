        "text": "Purchased lots will become available only after full payment has been\n\nmade. The sale will be conducted in Euros. In addition to the hammer\n\nprice, the buyer agrees to pay a buyer’s premium along with any applicable\n\nvalue added tax.\n\nFrom 1 to 150 000 € the buyer’s premium is 25% + VAT amounting to\n\n30% (all taxes included) and 23% of any amount in excess of 150 001€\n\nover + VAT amounting to 27.6% (all taxes included). Books (25% + VAT\n\namounting to 26,375%).\n\nIn addition to the hammer price and buyer’s premium, live auction buyers\n\nwill pay a 1,80% TTC (fees 1,5% HT + 0,30% VAT) commission to the Drouot\n\nDigital platform.\n\nNB :\n\n+ Auction by order of the court further to a prescription of the court,\n\nbuyers fees 14,40% VTA included.\n\n° Lots on which the auction house or its partners have a financial\n\ninterest\n\n* Lots which have been temporarily imported and are subject to a\n\nbuyer’s fee of 5.5% (20% for jewelry, motorcars, wines and spirits\n\nand multiples – F1 helmet) in addition to the hammer price and\n\nsale fees.\n\n~ This lot contains animal materials. Import restrictions are to be\n\nexpected and must be considered.\n\nThe legislator imposes strict rules for the commercial use of inert animal\n\nspecies. The international regulations of March 3, 1973 (CITES) requires\n\nfor different annexes a correlation between the specimen and the\n\ndocumentation proving the origins to be lawful. This regulation transcribed\n\nin European Community law (Annexes A/B/C) in Rule 338/97 of 9/12/1996\n\npermits commercial use of regulated specimens (CITES) upon presentation\n\nof documentation proving lawful origin; these documents for this variation\n\nare as follows :\n\n• For Annex A : C/C provided outlining the specimen’s history (for\n\nspecimens of recent date)\n\n• For Annex B : Bird specimens are either banded or equipped with\n\ntransponders, and are accompanied by documents of licit origin. The\n\nauction’s sale record must be conserved as it contains the complete\n\nhistory of every specimen.\n\nAll cases concerning specimens of recent date that are protected under\n\nthe French Env.ironmental Code and which were born and raised in\n\ncaptivity are permitted by the derogation clause AM of 14/07/2006. As\n\nsuch, they can be used commercially provided traceability between the\n\nspecimen and the documentation proving licit origins. Other specimen\n\ncases dating prior to clause AM of 21/07/2015 can, due to this fact, be\n\nused commercially. Specimens dating before 1947 included in this auction\n\nsale benefit from clause 2M of the derogatory Rule 228/97 of 9/12/1996,\n\npermitting their use for trade. However, exporting them outside of the\n\nEU them requires a pre-CITES Convention agreement.\n\nFor huntable species of the European continent and elsewhere, commercial\n\nuse is allowed under certain conditions. Domesticated species (D)\n\nincluded in this auction sale are free for trade. Old specimens from\n\nbefore the Convention (i.e. before 1975) comply with the conditions of\n\nthe AM of 23/12/2011 and, as such, are free for trade.\n\nThe other specimens in this auction sale are not subject to NR regulations\n\nand are free for commercial use and trade. The auction record will\n\nsubstantiate their licit origin.\n\nTo leave the EU, with regards to the Annexes I/A, II/B et III/C, a CITES\n\nre-export document at the expense of the acquirer will be necessary.\n\nGUARANTEES\n\nIn accordance with the law, the information given in the catalogue is\n\nthe responsibility of SAS Claude AGUTTES and its expert, taking into\n\naccount the corrections announced at the time of the presentation of\n\nthe item in the sale report.\n\nAttributions were made according to scientific and artistic knowledge\n\nat the time of the auction.\n\nThe order of the catalog will be followed.\n\nAn exhibition prior to the sale permits buyers to establish the conditions of\n\nthe works offered for sale. However in this period of pandemie the photos\n\nare worth exhibition, and no claims will be admitted once the award is\n\npronounced. The reproductions in the catalog of works are as faithful\n\nas possible, a difference in color or tones is nevertheless possible. The\n\ndimensions are only given as an indication.\n\nThe text in French is the official text which will be retained in case of\n\ndispute. The descriptions in other languages and the indications of\n\ndimensions in inches are given only as an indication and cannot be at\n\nthe origin of a complaint.\n\nThe state of conservation of the works is not specified in the catalog, the\n\nbuyers are therefore obliged to ask for additional photos, videos and/\n\nor condition reports. No claim will be accepted concerning possible\n\nrestorations or accidents once the auction has been pronounced.\n\nThe condition reports requested from SAS Claude Aguttes and the expert\n\nbefore the sale are given for information only. They do not engage their\n\nresponsibilities and cannot be the cause of a legal claim. Under no\n\ncircumstances do they replace the personal examination of the work by\n\nthe buyer or his representative.\n\nBIDS\n\nThe highest and final bidder will be the purchaser.\n\nShould the auctioneer recognize two simultaneous bids on one lot, the\n\nlot will be put up for sale again and all those present in the saleroom\n\nmay participate in this second opportunity to bid.\n\nImportant : Bidding is typically conducted in the auction house. However,\n\nwe may graciously accept telephone bids from potential buyers who\n\nhave made the request.\n\nWe bear no responsibility whatsoever in the case of uncompleted calls\n\nmade too late and/or technical difficulties with the telephone. We also\n\naccept absentee bids submitted prior to the sale. Aguttes won’t be held\n\nresponsible in case of errors and omissions with the execution of the\n\nwritten bids. We reserve the right to accept or deny any requests for\n\ntelephone or absentee bidding.\n\nIn carrying a bid, bidders assume their personal responsibility to pay\n\nthe hammer price as well as all buyer’s fees and taxes chargeable to the\n\nbuyer. Unless a written agreement established with Claude AGUTTES\n\nSAS, prerequisite to the sale, mentioning that the bidder acts as a\n\nrepresentative of a third party approved by Claude AGUTTES SAS, the\n\nbidder is deemed to act in his or her own name. We remind our sellers\n\nthat bidding on their own items is forbidden.\n\nImportant : During the confinement period, sales are made behind closed\n\ndoors with live transmission.\n\nTELEPHONE BIDDING : We accept to receive telephone bids from a\n\npotential buyer who has come forward prior to the sale. We cannot be\n\nheld liable in particular if the telephone connection is not established,\n\nis established late, or in the event of errors or omissions relating to the\n\nreception of bids by telephone.\n\nORDERS TO BUY : We accept the bidding orders that have been\n\ntransmitted. We are not liable in particular in the event of an error or\n\nomission in the written order.\n\nBIDS THROUGH DROUOT DIGITAL OR OTHER LIVE PLATFORM\n\nLive bidding is allowed during the auction. Bids are made through\n\ndrouotonline.com, which is a platform that allows remote electronic bidding.\n\nIt is necessary to register beforehand and make sure that the registration\n\nis validated. A bidding ceiling may be announced according to the\n\nsales, it is necessary to deposit a deposit beforehand in order to bid\n\nfreely during the sale. The buyer via this platform or any other platform\n\nproposed for live purchases is informed that the fees charged by these\n\nplatforms will be at his expense (a commission of 1.80% including tax\n\n(fees 1.5% excluding tax and VAT 0.30%) cf. Auction via Drouot Digital).\n\nAguttes auction house will not be to blame for any technical difficulties\n\nor malfunctioning of any kind that prevents buyers from bidding online\n\nthrough live platforms. The break in transmission of a live bidding service\n\nduring the auction doesn’t necessarily justify its halt by the auctioneer.\n\nCOLLECTION OF PURCHASES\n\nThe lots not claimed on the day of the auction can be retrieved by\n\nappointment : please contact the person in charge.\n\nFor lots placed in warehouses, costs and expenses will be at the buyer’s\n\ncharge.\n\nFor lots stored at Aguttes – except specific conditions if mentioned\n\n(Mobilier & objets d’art & Design) – buyers are advised that the following\n\nstorage costs will be charged :\n\n- 15 € / day for lots < € 10,000, and 30 € / day for lots > € 10,000\n\n- 3 € / day for any other lot < 1m3 & 5 € / day / m3 for the ones > 1m3.\n\nBuyers are advised to collect successful lots by the carrier of their\n\nchoice as soon as possible to avoid handling and storage costs which\n\nwill be required before collection of purchase.
