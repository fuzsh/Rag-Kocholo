        "text": "Pierre Jules Theophile Gautier was a French poet, dramatist, novelist, journalist, art critic and literary critic.\n\nWhile Gautier was an ardent defender of Romanticism, his work is difficult to classify and remains a point of reference for many subsequent literary traditions such as Parnassianism, Symbolism, Decadence and Modernism. He was widely esteemed by writers as diverse as Balzac, Baudelaire, the Goncourt brothers, Flaubert, Proust and Oscar Wilde."
