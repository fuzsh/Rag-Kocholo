        "text": "By Théophile Gautier\n\nI\n\nImperia\n\nI saw a plaster hand, on view\n\nIn sculptor’s studio, set apart...\n\nAspasia’s? Cleopatra’s?... Who?\n\nThis fragment’s human work of art?\n\nLike lily silvered by the dawn,\n\nFrozen in kiss of snow, its light\n\nLoveliness dazzled me, and shone\n\nIn poetry of purest white.\n\nThough pallid, wan, yet striking, it\n\nSpread over velvet, graceful, slender\n\nFingers—delicate, exquisite—\n\nDecked thick with rings of weighty splendor.\n\nThumb high, in serpentine-like pose,\n\nArched in a svelte and shapely line,\n\nIt lay, fine set, like one of those\n\nHands held with proud air Florentine.\n\nDid it comb out the sultan’s beard\n\nOn jeweled caftan? Or, with twirls\n\nAnd twistings, when Don Juan appeared,\n\nPlay in his lustrous, glistening curls?\n\nA courtesan’s? A queen’s? Did this\n\nWrought hand a scepter wield? Which one?\n\nThe paragon of fleshly bliss?\n\nSovereignty’s beauteous paragon?\n\nDoubtless, by little starts and fits,\n\nIt lit, poised, in its fluttering,\n\nOn the she-lion croup of its\n\nChimera-dream, caught on the wing;\n\nThe Empire’s fantasies; bombastic\n\nLove of fantastic, sumptuous schemes;\n\nVoluptuous frenzies orgiastic;\n\nImpossible and futile dreams;\n\nWild tales; poetic escapades\n\nOf hashish, Rhine-wine sorcery;\n\nDashing Bohemian cavalcades\n\nOn steeds unbridled, coursing free...\n\nSuch are the things the eyes divines\n\nIn that white book, by Venus written:\n\nBlank palm where she has traced the signs\n\nOne reads, a-tremble, terror-smitten.\n\nII\n\nLacenaire\n\nClose by, in contrast, lying there,\n\nEncushioned, was the severed hand—\n\nPungent-embalmed—of Lacenaire,\n\nAssassin and scourge of the land;\n\nCurio most depraved! But, though\n\nRepulsed, I reached and touched it, still\n\nBarely cleansed of its horrors! Oh!\n\nThat flesh, red-downed and deathly chill!\n\nSallow hand, like a mummy’s wrought,\n\nAll yellowed, laid-out pharaoh-wise,\n\nSpreading its faun-like fingers, taut,\n\nAs if to seize its tempting prize;\n\nExuding from their tips, an itching\n\nLusting for living flesh and gold,\n\nAbout to writhe, convulsed, and twitching\n\nBefore their victims, as of old.\n\nVice clawed vile hieroglyph designs\n\nOf heinous wrongs—most foul, most fell—\n\nIn all its wrinkles, all its lines,\n\nSigns that the executioner knew well!\n\nOne see its scabrous deeds large writ\n\nIn the palm’s bestial creases, and\n\nThe boiling cauldron scalding it\n\nWith every crime at sin’s command;\n\nCapri’s debauches libertine,\n\nOf fleshpot brothels orgy-rife\n\nStained through with blot of blood and wine\n\nLike the old Caesar’s blasé life.\n\nAt once both soft and savage, its\n\nShape shows a curious elegance,\n\nA fearsome grace that counterfeits\n\nThe gladiator’s graceful stance!\n\nCrime’s aristocracy! No plane,\n\nNo hammer’s labors ever made\n\nIts flesh tough time and time again!\n\nIts only tool, the dagger-blade...\n\nWork’s honest calluses! For you\n\nWe look in vain, no sign we see:\n\nEvil’s false poet, butcher true—\n\nA Manfred of the gutter, he!\n\nThéophile Gautier, “Study in Hands” from Selected Lyrics, translated by Norman R. Shapiro. Copyright © 2011 by Norman R. Shapiro. Reprinted by permission of Yale University Press.\n\nSource: Selected Lyrics (Yale University Press, 2011)"
