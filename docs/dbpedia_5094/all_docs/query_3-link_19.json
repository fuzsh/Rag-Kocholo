        "text": "The Alhambra is a jewel of Moorish architecture that stands almost defiantly against the jagged peaks of the Sierra Nevada mountains in northeastern Spain. Imposing walls surround the complex, but inside are beautiful palaces, sun-dappled courtyards, and cool green gardens. There are graceful pointed arches, lacy windows, colorful tile mosaics, and soaring domes — just the place to sit in quiet contemplation.\n\nThe Moors crossed the Strait of Gibraltar to Spain in 711. They brought flamenco music and chess; olives, apricots, and dates; and Islam. But in 1492, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella expelled the Moors from Spain.\n\nMuhammad XII, known as Boabdil, was the last Moorish Sultan of Granada. As the story goes, when he left Spain through the Sierra Nevada mountains, he looked back at the Alhambra and sighed with - longing for the beauty he was leaving behind. The Alhambra and that particular spot in the Alpujarras Pass have inspired artists, writers, and poets for centuries.\n\nIt’s now called the Pass of the Moor’s Sigh (Puerto del Suspiro del Moro in Spanish) and is marked with a weather-beaten stone marker — so you, too, can climb into the mountains and look back with a sigh.\n\nThéophile Gautier: Poet, Travel Writer, Romantic\n\nPierre Jules Théophile Gautier (1811-1872) was a French writer, poet, and literary critic. He worked as a journalist to pay the bills, but between those assignments, he traveled the world and wrote about his experiences. His adventures took him all over Europe — England, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Greece — as far east as Russia and south to Turkey, Algiers, and Egypt.\n\nHis many trips to Spain resulted in his 1853 book Wanderings in Spain. Its pages are rich with his personal observations, historical context, and charming 19th-century illustrations. In a passage about visiting the Alhambra, he wrote:\n\nOn coming from these obscure passages into this large space inundated with light, you feel an effect similar to that produced by a diorama. It appears to you that an enchanter’s wand has carried you to the East of four or five centuries back. Time, which changes all things in its progress, has in no way modified the aspect of these places, where the apparition of one of the old Moorish sultans… would not cause the least surprise.\n\nYou can read Wanderings in Spain on Project Gutenberg and Google Books. (Definitely at least treat yourself to a flip through the pages to enjoy the illustrations.)\n\nGuatier’s poem The Last Sigh of the Moor imagines the dramatic moment when Boabdil said his final adiós to Granada.\n\nThe Last Sigh of the Moor — Théophile Gautier (C.F. Bates, translator)\n\nThe Cavalier who hastes the height to gain\n\nPale and with trembling knees,\n\nIs Boabdil, king of the Moors of Spain,\n\nWho could have died, yet flees.\n\nTo Spaniards now Granada is restored,\n\nCrescent doth yield to cross,\n\nBy Boabdil, with tears not blood deplored,\n\nIs his dear city’s loss.\n\nUpon a rock, Sigh of the Moor, they call,\n\nBoabdil sat, and cast\n\nOn far Granada and Alhambra’s wall\n\nA long look and the last.\n\n“There I was caliph yesterday,\n\nLived like a very god below;\n\nThe Generalife wooed my stay,\n\nAnd then the Alhambra’s blazing glow.\n\nClear, floating baths were mine, and there\n\nSultanas, my three hundred fair,\n\nBathed, all secure from impious stare.\n\nMy name on all the world cast fear.\n\nAlas! my power is now brought low,\n\nMy valiant army flies the foe,\n\nWith none to follow me I go\n\nSave my own shadow, ever near.\n\nDissolve, dissolve in tears, my eyes!\n\nUp from my armor heave the steel,\n\nYe deep heart-sighs that now arise!\n\nHe conquers to whom Christians kneel!\n\nI go; adieu, fair sky of Spain,\n\nDarro, Jénil, the verdant plain,\n\nThe snowy peaks with rosy stain;\n\nFarewell, Granada! loves, adieu!\n\nSunny Alhambra, vermeil towers,\n\nFresh gardens filled with wondrous flowers,\n\nIn vigils and in dreaming hours,\n\nAbsent, I still shall look on you!’\n\nEmma Lazarus: Poet, Activist, Translator\n\nEmma Lazarus (1849 – 1887) was an American author and activist. She was born into a Sephardic Jewish family in Brooklyn, and wrote her first poems when she was eleven. In her later life, she became an activist for Jewish causes and economic reforms. All of which contributed to her most famous poem The New Colossus, the sonnet she wrote in 1883 to raise money for the construction of a pedestal for the Statue of Liberty. Lines from that work are engraved on a bronze plaque on Lady Liberty’s pedestal.\n\nLike Théophile Gautier, Emma Lazarus traveled to Europe twice in the late 1800s to raise money for Jewish aid organizations. Although she didn’t visit Spain on those trips, she was moved by the story of the expulsion of Jewish people from Spain. (Ferdinand and Isabella were very busy with dastardly schemes in 1492.) Maybe that’s what inspired this poem about the gardens of the Alhambra.\n\nDating from the 16th century, the Lindaraxa gardens feature fountains and pools, roses and bougainvillea, and the fragrance of orange trees and herbs.\n\nArabesque — Emma Lazarus\n\nOn a background of pale gold\n\nI would trace with quaint design,\n\nPenciled fine,\n\nBrilliant-colored, Moorish scenes,\n\nMosques and crescents, pages, queens,\n\nLine on line,\n\nThat the prose-world of to-day\n\nMight the gorgeous Past’s array\n\nOnce behold.\n\nOn the magic painted shield\n\nRich Granada’s Vega green\n\nShould be seen;\n\nCrystal fountains, coolness flinging,\n\nHanging gardens’ skyward springing\n\nEmerald sheen;\n\nRuddy when the daylight falls,\n\nCrowned Alhambra’s beetling walls\n\nStand revealed;\n\nBalconies that overbrow\n\nField and city, vale and stream.\n\nIn a dream\n\nLulled the drowsy landscape basks;\n\nMark the gleam\n\nSilvery of each white-swathed peak!\n\nMountain-airs caress the cheek,\n\nFresh from the snow.\n\nHere in Lindaraxa’s bower\n\nThe immortal roses bloom;\n\nIn the room\n\nLion-guarded, marble-paven,\n\nStill the fountain leaps to heaven.\n\nBut the doom\n\nOf the banned and stricken race\n\nOvershadows every place,\n\nEvery hour.\n\nWhere fair Lindaraxa dwelt\n\nFlits the bat on velvet wings;\n\nMute the strings\n\nOf the broken mandoline;\n\nThe Pavilion of the Queen\n\nWidely flings\n\nVacant windows to the night;\n\nMoonbeams kiss the floor with light\n\nWhere she knelt.\n\nThrough these halls that people stepped\n\nWho through darkling centuries\n\nHeld the keys\n\nOf all wisdom, truth, and art,\n\nIn a Paradise apart,\n\nLapped in ease,\n\nSagely pondering deathless themes,\n\nWhile, befooled with monkish dreams,\n\nEurope slept.\n\nWhere shall they be found today?\n\nYonder hill that frets the sky\n\n‘The Last Sigh\n\nOf the Moor’ is named still.\n\nThere the ill-starred Boabdil\n\nBade good-by\n\nTo Granada and to Spain,\n\nWhere the Crescent ne’er again\n\nHoldeth sway.\n\nVanished like the wind that blows,\n\nWhither shall we seek their trace\n\nOn earth’s face?\n\nThe gigantic wheel of fate,\n\nCrushing all things soon or late,\n\nNow a race,\n\nNow a single life o’erruns,\n\nNow a universe of suns,\n\nNow a rose."
