The fog, made thicker by its proximity to the Seine, blurred every detail with its ragged veils, punctured at various distances by the reddish glow of lanterns and bars of light escaping from illuminated windows.  The road was soaked with rain and glittered under the street-lamps, like a lake reflecting strings of lights.  A bitter wind, heavy with icy particles, whipped at my face, its howling forming the high notes of a symphony whose bass was played by swollen waves crashing into the piers of the bridges below.  The evening lacked none of winter's rough poetry.'",
