In February 1830, with Gérard de Nerval, he was one of the main actors in the battle of Hernani which, by defending the dramatic play by Victor Hugo, caused a theatrical scandal. But in 1830 during the July Revolution, he was forced to earn a living after his father's bankruptcy. In 1836, Théophile Gautier became a journalist for the review “La Presse”. He writes over 1,200 articles and works tirelessly, like a convict. A great traveler, he has visited Belgium, Spain, England, Algeria, Italy, Constantinople and Russia. He has drawn inspiration from his many travels to write short stories, poems and travelogues.
