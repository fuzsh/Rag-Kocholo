        "text": "Winners of the National Security Innovation Network (NSIN) âReality Bytes: Visualizing Cyber Operationsâ hackathon split a $70,000 prize to continue developing their winning concepts into prototype solutions with the Department of Defense (DoD).\n\nNSIN Hacks connects military problems with problem-solvers for a short, intensive period to work together to solve DoD problems. Teams work with military mentors to develop and refine solutions. Mentors coach the innovators on accelerating the delivery of affordable, integrated, and interoperable capabilities for the military. Finalist teams then pitch concepts in a live pitch event for a chance to win part of a prize pool and continue developing their solutions with the DoD.\n\nWorking with Naval Information Warfare Systems Command (NAVWAR), teams researched ways gaming technology could help visualize, monitor, and track cybersecurity operations. For instance, DoD personnel responsible for analyzing the health and vulnerabilities of networks face a range of challenges in prioritizing and focusing on critical cyber-based threats. They must manage a range of diagnostic tools across multiple software platforms while remaining vigilant for hard-to-detect events that could signal phishing or hacking attempts from adversaries. Further diagnosis is often even more difficult for personnel in expeditionary environments with physical limitations on bandwidth, energy, and processing power.\n\nâWe really wanted it [the hackathon] to be fun and interesting and compelling for people that weâd be hiring in the future to be able to defend the nation,â explained Rachel Bondi, NAVWAR PMW 130âs technical director. âItâs creating a community of people in industry that are interested in the cyber defense applications, specifically to the military and building that community. As far as the winners go, we have paths for them to pursue internally so that we can actually look at doing prototypes and perhaps pilots of their solutions.â\n\nOn May 9, participants kicked off the hackathon in two tracksâ startups and studentsâ to solve mixed reality and cybersecurity military challenges with commercial-off-the-shelf augmented reality and virtuality reality technologies.\n\nOn May 25, Hacks âReality Bytesâ finalists pitched their solutions to improve cyber operations and the ability of DoD personnel to visualize, monitor, and respond to cybersecurity events. Eight finalist teams, including four student teams and four startup teams, presented their solutions to judges during the final round of the competition. The judges evaluated teams based on understanding DoD pain points in the established focus and its feasibility in providing value.\n\nThe top-four teams won contracts from a $70,000 pot to develop solutions further with the DoD. Two teams from the startup track each won $25,000, and two teams from the student track each won $10,000.\n\nâMaking it easier for more innovators to understand how to operate in this space, manipulating cyber data, or conducting cyber operations will ultimately increase the effectiveness of our military deployed in expeditionary environmentsâ said Kedar Pavgi, NSIN Hacks program manager. âIf these ideas and technologies are to succeed, itâs not just going to be a couple of people who planned a hackathon competition, itâs going to require, as Rachel said, a community. And we hope through our jobs that we can build this community and sustain it so that these solutions can actually get into the hands of folks who need it.â\n\nMeet the winners from the startup and the student tracks below and learn more about their winning solutions.\n\nWINNING TEAMS\n\nSTARTUP TRACK\n\nWinning Team #1 Cyberspatial\n\nâNSIN [Hacks] provides an environment to focus your skills to solve a crucial problem in an innovative way. We believe the competition provided exposure and we look forward to the conversations with mission partners.ââ Team Cyberspatial\n\nSolution: Cyberspatial combines network forensics, asset inventory, and mapping in one application. The technology enables users to work together in real-time on diagramming and analysis powered by the same 2D and 3D rendering technologies used in web games, allowing users to manage multiple dimensions of security data.\n\nSolution Video\n\nâOur technology in the hands of world fighters will give them the tools they need to visualize[,] describe and take action in their cyber environments. Most importantly it will lower the bar to entry closing the gap in the cyber operation workforce.ââ Team Cyberspatial\n\nWinning Team #2 SeeSignal\n\nâThe NSIN network helped us pivot our presentation away from technical coding and into value propositions and mission needs. Outside of the NSIN network, speaking with a SOCOM program managerâ¦ was tremendously insightful.ââ Team SeeSignal\n\nSolution: SeeSignalis a woman-owned small business developing an augmented-reality application that allows technical and non-technical stakeholders to âseeâ invisible radio signals and packets. The technology helps users form more accurate visualizatoins and mental models of networks, improving security analysis and user confidence.\n\nSolution Video\n\nâSeeSignal adds a spatial dimension to network data that is traditionally viewed in spreadsheets, which reframes the problem in a way that it is more accessible to a wider range of people. We believe that bringing signal awareness into the warfightersâ field of view will improve their safety, situational awareness, and reaction times.ââ Team SeeSignal\n\nSTUDENT TRACK\n\nWinning Team #1 CyberCOP\n\nâBy joining the NSIN Hacks competition and seeing it through to the end our team had thought seriously about what our skills can contribute to national cyber security.ââ Team CyberCOP\n\nSolution: The University of HawaiÊ»i at MÄnoa students developed a virtual-reality solution to visualize satellite network capacity. The VR technology enables cyber operators to interact with visualizations of networks in expeditionary environments.\n\nSolution Video\n\nâMost common operating pictures (COP) are shared on two-dimensional screens. Our solution places cyber operators inside the COP using stereoscopic 3D and spatial audio to provide the ultimate level situational awarenessâ¦ââ Team CyberCOP\n\nWinning Team #2 CyberVIEWS\n\nâCompleting NSIN Hacks has really improved our lives, especially in how it has brought attention to the sometimes neglected ways that unconventional perspectives that people in majors like ours can bring to the approaches to challenges across various fields of technology. We expect the skills and connections that we have made here to continue to assist us as we move ahead into our future careers.ââ Team CyberVIEWS\n\nSolution: The Georgia Tech students developed an augmented reality system to warn operators about cyber threats. The technology detects cybersecurity threats by tagging devices with identifying marks that allow their condition to be viewed on maps or on compatible graphic displays.\n\nSolution Video\n\nâIf we manage to bring our concept to complete implementation, CyberVIEWS greatest benefit would be to those warfighters operating without immediate access to their cybersecurity professionals, enabling those working away from larger support networks to visualize the targets and effects of an attack more efficiently and how they can prepare an immediate response.ââ Team CyberVIEWS\n\nWatch the Reality Bytes Hackathon Live-pitch recording\n\nWatch\n\nHackathon recording time stamps\n\nOpening Remarks:\n\n00:00:05- Greg Bernard Acting Director, NSIN\n\n00:03:40- Rear Adm.
