        "text": "Rockstar has announced plans to add Bully and LA Noire to GTA+ later in 2024.\n\nThe ‘Games Included With GTA+’ library recently saw the addition of Red Dead Redemption. Bully and LA Noire, both published by Rockstar Games, are next up, although Rockstar’s wording here suggests more games are coming.\n\n“We recently added Red Dead Redemption — with access to Undead Nightmare — to the stellar Games Included With GTA+ library, and Members can look forward to more Rockstar classics becoming available later this year, including L.A. Noire and Bully,” Rockstar said.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nBully is Rockstar Vancouver’s much-loved open-world juvenile delinquent sim that first launched in 2006 on PlayStation 2. A sequel was once in development at Rockstar’s New England studio in the late 2000s, but obviously never came out. In November, the alleged leak of a database file for Grand Theft Auto 5 was found to include reference to the unreleased Bully 2, with some of its ideas making it into other Rockstar games like Red Dead Redemption 2.\n\nLA Noire, meanwhile, is Team Bondi’s 2011 open-world game set in 1947 Los Angeles. As with Bully, fans have called for a sequel, although Team Bondi itself is no more.\n\nIn its announcement, Rockstar teased a new supercar for this summer's \"big\" GTA Online update: “Plus, look out for the opportunity to secure a new bonus super car as part of your GTA+ Membership with this summer’s big GTA Online update,\" the company said.\n\nAll this comes with GTA 6 looming over the horizon. Rockstar has said it will come out at some point in 2025. It has yet to say what will happen to the existing GTA Online when it does.\n\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
