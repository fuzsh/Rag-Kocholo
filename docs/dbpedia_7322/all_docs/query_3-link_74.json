Click here for more information.\n\nA revolutionary TV has thousands of younger Aussies forking out on high-end home entertainment again despite many foregoing a set in favour of on-trend projectors and laptops.\n\nThe 'quiet luxury' trend has seen a renewed interest in 'statement' home decor and electronics - and the brand new LG G4 has been the go-to choice for many thanks to its 'unbelievable' quality, thin design and generous list of modern features.\n\nThe innovative new OLED buy has households gathered around the telly once again, with gamers, couples, families and singles dubbing the TV 'a marvel'.\n\nAnd they're right, with the G4 boasting features like the Personalised Picture Wizard, which helps you adjust the picture settings via a few images, a Brightness Booster, for brightly-lit rooms and Gallery Mode, which transforms the gadget into a live piece of artwork.\n\nThe black is the 'blackest yet', the backlight is in a 'league of its own' and everything you need is at your fingertips - Spotify, streaming services, live sports updates, surround sound, YouTube and a blazingly fast 1ms response time for gamers.\n\n'The G4 is an engineering marvel, meticulously crafted based how the modern TV is used,' Tony Brown, General Manager of Home Entertainment Marketing and Content Business for LG Electronics Australia, told FEMAIL.\n\n'We've designed it to fit with any home decor - we wanted to create a TV that could be used beyond just watching content, we wanted it to blend into any space.'\n\nThe television was inspired by Aussies seeking something 'different', with more people stepping away from the traditional black box than ever before.\n\nInstead, they are seeking something multifunctional that's easy to navigate and blends into their lifestyle.\n\n'We are also finding that consumers want a TV that is easy to navigate and intuitive, somewhere they can easily find their favourite content with a few clicks of a button,' Mr Brown said.\n\n'We have offered webOS on LG TVs for the last 10 years and the latest version includes features that give users freedom and the ability to personalise their viewing experiences.\n\n'It supports up to 10 user profiles so everyone in the household gets tailored recommendations and customised layouts, putting their favourite content front and centre.'\n\nAnd the reviews speak for themselves.\n\n'It has exceeded my expectations in every way. The picture quality is stunning, with vibrant colors, deep blacks, and sharp details that make watching movies and shows a truly immersive experience. The size of the screen is perfect for our living room, providing a cinematic feel without overwhelming the space. Highly recommend,' one wrote.\n\n'This is without a doubt the best TV that I have ever owned,' another added.\n\n'Out of the box this TV is a breeze to setup. After tuning in my free to air channels the quality is immediately evident with the outstandingly clear and bright pictures. I find myself with a renewed enjoyment watching television and due to the 4K upscaling even old favourites are seen in a new light.'\n\nA third wrote: 'I never thought I would have that \"WOW!\" moment like I did when we first moved from standard definition to high definition visuals again but this TV managed it. Everything looks like 4K - shiny and smooth. I can not believe it! If you love movies and video games and you want to take them to the next level this is the TV to do that.'\n\nFor those who love sport and/or gaming, it's also a no-brainer.\n\n'It takes picture quality and responsiveness to the next level. At the heart of it is the Alpha 11 AI processor, its smart engine that makes sure the G4 can handle a range of content – action movies, fast-paced sports and competitive gaming,' Mr Brown said.\n\n'The G4 has content-specific functions that mean it can adapt no matter what you're watching. For gamers, features like AMD FreeSync and Variable Refresh Rate mean the picture can respond quickly so there is no lag or tearing.\n\n'For sport viewing, AI Super Upscaling actively sharpens objects and backgrounds, meaning even the most fast-paced games are shown in life-like clarity.'\n\nEven when watching movies, the AI Director Processing assesses and refines colours in the scene to convey the mood and emotion as intended by filmmakers.\n\nOne of the features in the G4 that movie buffs will love is Filmmaker Mode, which preserves the artistic integrity of the movie.\n\n'When it's activated, you will view the movie the way the director intended - accurate colour representation without distortion or over processing. What you'll see on the screen is what the director saw when he calls 'action' on set,' Mr Brown said.\n\nThe price point is above average, with the 55\" costing $4,195, the 65\", $5,295, and the 77\", $7,995.\n\nRegardless, men and women of all ages are gushing about the 'worthy' investment and are dubbing it the 'best buy they've ever made'."
