        "text": "City2Surf, billed as ‘the world’s largest fun run’, returns to the streets of Sydney on Sunday, August 11, 2024, with 90,000 runners registering for the 2024 sold-out event.\n\nSunday’s City2Surf is set to be the largest in the event’s history, with a record-breaking sea of runners to make their way along the 14km course between the Sydney central business district (CBD) and Bondi Beach.\n\nHistory\n\nInspiration for City2Surf came via a note from Fairfax’s US correspondent in 1970 to the editor of Sydney’s The Sun newspaper, Jack Tier. This was accompanied by a newspaper clipping about the San Francisco Bay to Breakers event.\n\nFrom that internal memorandum the Sun City2Surf was born – albeit humbly, in 1971 – with just over 1,500 entrants.\n\nCourse\n\nThe 14km course begins in the heart of Sydney’s CBD alongside Hyde Park before guiding participants through the streets of the city.\n\nHeartbreak Hill, presented by AIA, marks the halfway point and one of the most scenic parts of the course, where participants can stop for a selfie with the Sydney Harbour Bridge behind them. The home stretch takes in ocean views as Bondi Beach comes into sight, with participants completing their journey on Queen Elizabeth Drive in Bondi.\n\nTanya Carroll, City2Surf Regional Director, said “The support from runners this year has been incredible, and with 90,000 signed up to take part in the 2024 City2Surf this will be our biggest ever event.\n\n“Thanks to our event partners and stakeholders for their ongoing support of the event and we look forward to a record-breaking day on Sunday with 90,000 City2Surf entrants.”\n\nShe continued, “The City2Surf holds a special place in the hearts of so many people in Sydney, it allows people to experience the best that Sydney has to offer and provides a great opportunity to come together and train for a common goal.\n\n“The event also plays an important role for a number of charitable organisations, with City2Surf runners raising over AU$55 million for charities since 2008, and the event aiming to raise over AU$3.5 million this year.\n\n“One of the things we love about the City2Surf is that it’s open to people of all abilities, with people running, walking, pushing prams, using wheelchairs and even dancing their way from the CBD to Bondi Beach. We love the community atmosphere of this event, with it bringing people from all walks of life together and is a great celebration of being active.”\n\nOver its 54-year history, City2Surf has become synonymous with raising funds for charity, with more than 500 groups set to be supported by runners in 2024.\n\nwww.city2surf.com.au"
