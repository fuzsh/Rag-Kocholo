        "text": "08/08/2024 - 04:00 PM\n\nInterchange derived from the Expensify Card grew to $4.0 million, an increase of 48% as compared to the same period last year.\n\nPORTLAND, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Expensify, Inc. (Nasdaq: EXFY), a payments superapp that helps individuals and businesses around the world simplify the way they manage money across expenses, corporate cards and bills, today released a letter to shareholders from Founder and CEO David Barrett alongside results for its quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\nA Message From Our Founder\n\nI'm extremely pleased with how well Q2 has extended Q1's achievements and improved upon them further:\n\nOur core business has been stabilize, with increasing cash flow. Revenue and paid users are within 1% of last quarter – with quarterly interchange, operating cash flow, and free cash flow up 14%, 168% and 10% (48%, 2,247% and 399% y/y), respectively.\n\nThe new Expensify Card program is live. Most active Expensify Card customers have already adopted the new program, and 34% of spend has already migrated to the new cards we've mailed out – which earns us 20% more interchange, and contributes directly to revenue. We are well on the way to our target of 100% adoption by EOY.\n\nNew Expensify is live. We have returned to the conference circuit after a multi-year absence, with all messaging and demos focused exclusively on New Expensify. Development is no longer solely core development and now includes pipeline optimizations, and New Expensify is expected to add new revenue in Q3. We continue to make brisk progress on the combined business/consumer superapp experience in anticipation of our extremely visible product placement within Apple TV's biggest budget movie ever, scheduled to be in theaters June 2025.\n\nHybrid app is live. This is an incredibly difficult and important technical milestone that allows us to upgrade existing apps deployed on millions of devices worldwide in order to switch interchangeably between New Expensify and Expensify Classic. This is a critical tool for seamlessly migrating existing customers on a selective basis to the new experience, while allowing existing customers with classic functionality that has not yet been updated to remain on their existing experience. The hybrid app is being rolled out globally.\n\nExpensify Travel is live. We have launched our travel product to new and existing customers, and is expected to generate an entirely new revenue stream of travel bookings in Q3.\n\nThis quarter did a fantastic job laying a clear foundation for future growth, and the excitement inside our (virtual) halls is palpable. Hit me up at our booth at Xerocon or SuiteWorld to see the New Expensify pitch in person!\n\n-david\n\nFounder and CEO of Expensify\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Highlights\n\nFinancial:\n\nRevenue was $33.3 million, a decrease of 14% compared to the same period last year.\n\nGenerated $9.3 million cash from operating activities.\n\nFree cash flow was $5.7 million.\n\nNet loss was $2.8 million, compared to $11.3 million for the same period last year.\n\nNon-GAAP net income was $5.6 million.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $10.2 million.\n\nInterchange derived from the Expensify Card grew to $4.0 million, an increase of 48% compared to the same period last year.\n\nSee Financial Outlook section for Free Cash Flow guidance for fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.\n\nBusiness:\n\nPaid members - Paid members were 684,000, a decrease of 8% from the same period last year.\n\nNew Expensify Card program - The majority of active Expensify Card customers began transitioning to the new program, with 34% of spend migrated by end of Q2.\n\nNew Expensify - The company began supporting businesses on New Expensify that is expected to generate revenue beginning in Q3 2024.\n\nNew Integrations - Expensify launched integrations with QuickBooks Online and Xero on New Expensify, a major milestone to support customers on the new platform.\n\nSales and marketing - The company announced a partnership with Apple for lead product placement in Apple's largest feature film investment ever, F1, set to release in June 2025.\n\nCorporate travel - The company returned to the travel conference circuit to demo Expensify Travel — its corporate travel management platform built for the midsized and small-cap enterprise market — at GBTA, the world's foremost corporate travel event.\n\nFinancial Outlook\n\nExpensify's outlook statements are based on current estimates, expectations and assumptions and are not a guarantee of future performance. The following statements are forward-looking and actual results could differ materially depending on market conditions and the factors set forth under “Forward-Looking Statements” below. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve the results expressed by this guidance.\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nExpensify estimates Free Cash Flow of $15.0 million to $16.0 million for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.\n\nThe Company does not provide a reconciliation for free cash flow estimates on a forward-looking basis because it is unable, without making unreasonable efforts, to provide a meaningful or reasonably accurate calculation or estimation of net cash provided by operating activities and certain reconciling items on a forward-looking basis, which could be significant to the Company's results.\n\nStock Based Compensation\n\nAn estimate of expected stock-based compensation for the next four fiscal quarters is as follows, which is driven primarily by the pre-IPO grant of RSUs issued to all employees (which vest quarterly over eight years with approximately five years remaining).\n\nEst. stock-based compensation (millions)\n\nQ3 2024\n\nQ4 2024\n\nQ1 2025\n\nQ2 2025\n\nLow\n\nHigh\n\nLow\n\nHigh\n\nLow\n\nHigh\n\nLow\n\nHigh\n\nCost of revenue, net\n\n$\n\n2.4\n\n$\n\n3.1\n\n$\n\n2.3\n\n$\n\n3.0\n\n$\n\n2.2\n\n$\n\n2.9\n\n$\n\n1.9\n\n$\n\n2.6\n\nResearch and development\n\n3.2\n\n4.0\n\n3.1\n\n3.9\n\n2.9\n\n3.7\n\n2.5\n\n3.3\n\nGeneral and administrative\n\n1.2\n\n1.5\n\n1.2\n\n1.5\n\n1.1\n\n1.4\n\n1.0\n\n1.3\n\nSales and marketing\n\n0.5\n\n0.7\n\n0.5\n\n0.7\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n7.3\n\n$\n\n9.3\n\n$\n\n7.1\n\n$\n\n9.1\n\n$\n\n6.6\n\n$\n\n8.6\n\n$\n\n5.8\n\n$\n\n7.8\n\nAvailability of Information on Expensify’s Website\n\nInvestors and others should note that Expensify routinely announces material information to investors and the marketplace using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and the Expensify Investor Relations website at https://ir.expensify.com. While not all of the information that the Company posts to its Investor Relations website is of a material nature, some information could be deemed to be material. Accordingly, the Company encourages investors, the media and others interested in Expensify to review the information that it shares on its Investor Relations website.\n\nConference Call\n\nExpensify will host a video call to discuss the financial results and business highlights at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time today. An investor presentation and the video call information is available on Expensify’s Investor Relations website at https://ir.expensify.com. A replay of the call will be available on the site for three months.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we provide certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net loss, and free cash flow.\n\nWe believe our non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, measuring our performance, identifying trends affecting our business, formulating business plans and making strategic decisions. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled metrics or measures presented by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for financial information presented under GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures versus comparable financial measures determined under GAAP. For example, other companies in our industry may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance. All of these limitations could reduce the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP is at the end of this press release.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define adjusted EBITDA as net loss from operations excluding provision for income taxes, interest and other expenses, net, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation.\n\nNon-GAAP net income. We define non-GAAP net income as net loss from operations excluding stock-based compensation.\n\nFree cash flow. We define Free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities excluding changes in settlement assets and settlement liabilities, which represent funds held for customers and customer funds in transit, respectively, reduced by the purchases of property and equipment and software development costs.\n\nThe tables at the end of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements provide reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to each of these non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nForward-looking statements in this press release, or made during the earnings call, which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1955. These statements include statements regarding our strategy, future financial condition, future operations, future cash flow, projected costs, prospects, plans, objectives of management and expected market growth, product developments and their potential impact and our stock-based compensation estimates and involve known and unknown risks that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual results, performance or achievements may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “shall,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “goal,” “ambition,” “objective,” “seeks,” “outlook,” or “continue” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans, or intentions. Such forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by us and our management, are inherently uncertain. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: the impact on inflation on us and our members; our borrowing costs have and may continue to increase as a result of increases in interest rates; our expectations regarding our financial performance and future operating performance; our ability to attract and retain members, expand usage of our platform, sell subscriptions to our platform and convert individuals and organizations into paying customers; the timing and success of new features, integrations, capabilities and enhancements by us, or by competitors to their products, or any other changes in the competitive landscape of our market; the amount and timing of operating expenses and capital expenditures that we may incur to maintain and expand our business and operations to remain competitive; the sufficiency of our cash, cash equivalents and investments to meet our liquidity needs; our ability to make required payments under and to comply with the various requirements of our current and future indebtedness; our cash flows, the prevailing stock prices, general economic and market conditions and other considerations that could affect the specific timing, price and size of repurchases under our stock repurchase program or our ability to fund any stock repurchases; geopolitical tensions, including the war in Ukraine and the escalating conflict in Israel, Gaza and surrounding areas; our ability to effectively manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the expenses associated with being a public company; the size of our addressable markets, market share and market trends; anticipated trends, developments and challenges in our industry, business and the highly competitive markets in which we operate; our expectations regarding our income tax liabilities and the adequacy of our reserves; our ability to effectively manage our growth and expand our infrastructure and maintain our corporate culture; our ability to identify, recruit and retain skilled personnel, including key members of senior management; the safety, affordability and convenience of our platform and our offerings; our ability to successfully defend litigation brought against us; our ability to successfully identify, manage and integrate any existing and potential acquisitions of businesses, talent, technologies or intellectual property; general economic conditions in either domestic or international markets, and geopolitical uncertainty and instability, including as a result of the 2024 United States presidential election; our protections against security breaches, technical difficulties, or interruptions to our platform; our ability to maintain, protect and enhance our intellectual property; and other risks discussed in our filings with the SEC. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth above. We caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are made only as of the date of this press release. We do not undertake or assume any obligation to update publicly any of these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, new information or future events, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking statements, except to the extent required by applicable law. If we update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.\n\nAbout Expensify\n\nExpensify is a payments superapp that helps individuals and businesses around the world simplify the way they manage money.
