        "text": "The abusive work conditions at Team Bondi, which came to light a few months back have had some undesirable side-effects for the studio. Understandably, no one wants to work there and Team Bondi boss, Brendan McNamara is in merger talks, hoping for his studio to get absorbed by George Miller’s KNM studio.\n\nRockstar has been a bit reluctant to publish Team Bondi’s next game. In a way, it’s a bit funny after all, Red Dead Redemption studio, Rockstar San Diego was hit with similar allegations.\n\nAccording to a Kotaku Source, “The word is going round that Team Bondi is being folded into KMM studios, Team Bondi is pretty much doomed after the scandal and can’t find any new supporters, so by doing this they can hide their name.”"
