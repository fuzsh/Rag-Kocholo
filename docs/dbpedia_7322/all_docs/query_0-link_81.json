        "text": "Video game character animation has been for as long as video games have been. This blog article will cover as much as possible the design, implementation, and animation of video game characters.\n\nWe’ll also share some amazing examples of top-tier video game character animations from the past several years for you to admire and be inspired by. So let’s get this party started!\n\nEvolution Of Video Game Animation\n\nIn the early days of animation, both in movies and video games, animations were created by hand using existing technology such as rotoscoping.\n\nWith the arrival of larger and stronger console generations after 2010, animators were able to do considerably more with their tools.\n\nSince then, we’ve incorporated motion capture and facial recognition technology from firms like Adobe.\n\nFacial recognition is currently at an all-time high, with titles like Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor claiming to have programmed every orc you encounter with their own distinct motions and facial expressions.\n\n>>>Read more:\n\nAsia Pacific 3d animation production studios inspire more creative animated ideas – P1\n\nAsia Pacific 3d animation production studios inspire more creative animated ideas – P2\n\nThe Influence of Video Games\n\nFrom South Park’s spoof of World of Warcraft in the 2006 episode “Make Love, Not Warcraft” to the 2019 League of Legends World Championship attracted just shy of 4 million viewers, video games have wormed their way into the mainstream in a variety of ways over the years.\n\nVideo games, like all digital art media, have progressed from being full-fledged versions of contemporary media to stand-alone forms of content. Video games are now frequently created by people who have the knowledge and practical experience working with movies, films, and other media.\n\nVideo games are increasingly used for more than just enjoyment around the world, with educational institutions adopting them in a variety of ways, including utilizing them to teach.\n\nBut, in the end, video games are considered art. So, let’s look at what you can do to make your video game characters stand out.\n\nThe Basics Of Video Game Character Animation\n\nWe’ll go through the five basics of video game animation, but three crucial characteristics of character animation are fluidity, readability, and context.\n\nFluidity\n\nOne of the most noticeable contrasts between animated films and video games is how the scenes are ordered. The sequences you see in video games and the actions done by the characters are made up of many brief animations that are linked together.\n\nBecause this is the case, the animations will overlap in a succession. As an example, consider the following:\n\nOf course, the in-betweens must be as smooth as the main animations and integrate flawlessly. So when we talk about fluidity in animation, we mean how smoothly and coherently various movements are linked together.\n\nReadability\n\nAnother significant distinction between films and video games is the point of view. More specifically, in a 3D world, video games can and should be viewed from all angles, which means that your animations should make sense from every aspect, similar to the staging principle.\n\nFixed position games that force people into a single perspective such as Diablo III, the camera moves with the character’s movements, and as a result, the character animations must seem the same from all angles.\n\nWhile animating, you should continually be looking at your character’s actions from all perspectives.\n\nContext\n\nWe mean situational context when we mention context. Because the animation might occur at any point during the game, a character’s animations must make sense of the situation in which they find themselves.\n\nBecause video games are player-driven, you almost certainly cannot predict when and where a specific character’s animation will occur, so you must figure out how to use nuance to distinguish your character from the rest of the game.\n\nIf you can only control one character, it should have different animations than the other characters the player will encounter during their playthrough.\n\nCutscenes and unique gameplay moments should also have nuanced and unique animations, but they should not detract from the gameplay.\n\n5 Best Character Animations in Video Games That Will Inspire You\n\nThe best examples of unique character animations in video games, as well as what makes them relevant and fascinating, are provided here.\n\nPrince of Persia\n\nJordan Mechner produced Prince of Persia in 1989. A legendary action-adventure game that was eventually purchased by Ubisoft and made into a profitable gaming franchise.\n\nDespite the limited technology available at the time, developer Jordan Mechner chose to give Prince’s character unprecedented fluidity by rotoscoping his brother’s acrobatic action motions.\n\nWhile moving about, gamers might feel the anticipation in Prince’s personality. The animation depicted Prince pausing before proceeding to the next location by examining a spiky death pit or cavernous chasm.\n\nThe film Prince of Persia was a vivid example of a realistic portrayal of a character with limited technological resources.\n\nMetal Slug\n\nMetal Slug designers pioneered seamless character motion at a time when 2D graphics had restrictions. Every pixel square was injected with flair and personality.\n\nEvery frame precisely captured the explosion, gunfire, flying items, laser beams, and opponent attacks.\n\nMetal Slug was a hugely popular gaming franchise with a significant cult following. So much so that SNK has recently announced a new game in development in order to capitalize on its devoted fanbase.\n\nTobal 2\n\nTobal 2 was created by the well-known Japanese gaming firm Dreamfactory and released by Square in 1997. Tekken, a well-known fighting game, was also created by the company.\n\nThis game is well-known for its extensive usage of generative animation. To allow for more different activities, animations are generated automatically in real time using this technology.\n\nThe procedural animation method is generally utilized for particle system simulation, such as hair, wind, or clothing, which would be difficult to animate manually.\n\nTobal 2 depicts this approach by having every character appear to be going for the limb as they launch a punch or kick.\n\nOn the other hand, every character moves their arms or limbs to block a hit since they know where to move and what movement is required.\n\nResident Evil 4\n\nCapcom produced and released Resident Evil 4 in 2005. It has been in the works for over six years.\n\nIt is set in a third person over-the-shoulder camera perspective and is part of a successful survival horror game franchise.\n\nThe immersive and fluid flow of character movements, hair fluttering when sprinting, accuracy aiming, and facial expressions are the most noticeable aspects of its animation.\n\nResident Evil 4 reinvented the third-person shooter gameplay style and is widely regarded as one of the most influential games of the 2000s.\n\nL.A. Noire\n\nL.A. Noire was created by Team Bondi and released in 2011 by one of the game industry’s most recognizable names: Rockstar.\n\nIt’s a neo-noir, action-adventure game inspired by 1940s Hollywood detective movies that revolutionized facial motion capture with enormous budgets and amazing actors.\n\nThe mocap technology was crucial to the overall gameplay because gamers had to rely on character facial expressions to determine who was a suspect in a crime scene investigation.\n\nL.A. Noire is remarkable for being the first film to use MotionScan technology, which uses 32 cameras to capture facial emotions from every aspect.\n\nThe Ultimate Guide To Making Video Game Character Animation\n\nTo be able to make video game character animation, you need to consider the following factors:\n\nVisual Appeal And Uniqueness\n\nNot every video game character you develop has to be distinct from the others, but the primary ones should be.\n\nYour primary characters, especially your playable characters, require something about them that your audience can feel attached to, something that will keep them playing.\n\nCharacter Personality Should Be Related To Animation Style\n\nTiny Tina from the Borderlands franchise, shown below, is an excellent example of a video game character’s animation reflecting their personality.\n\nShe’s mad and never stops moving, her eyes unblinking. When you see a scurrying character model in the distance, you know who you’re looking at.\n\nYour characters should have distinct personalities and motions. It’s often easier when there’s a story behind the lore behind your character, but coming up with that part on your own can be difficult. Whatever the case may be, it must be completed.\n\nThe best character animation software\n\nWe’d like to go through the specifics of the greatest animation software. 3D and 2D animation software is included. Their feature sets differ, but they are all effective tools in their own way. Some are primarily intended for character creation, while others provide broadcast-quality 4K+ motion video.\n\nToon Boom\n\nEverything needed to create broadcast-quality animated content is included in this comprehensive application.\n\nColor management includes color spaces, palettes, and painting.\n\nDeformers add texture, depth, and realism.\n\nLighting and auto-toning are examples of special effects.\n\nComplete audio management and manipulation abilities\n\nCombine 3D components with 2D characters.\n\nTraditional paperless animation versus cutting-out animation and 3D rigging\n\nOptions for dependable support, such as community forums\n\nExport capabilities for gaming engines\n\nDaz 3D\n\nModel posing, 3D motion images, and animation are all supported.\n\nOptions for detailed modeling and lighting\n\nIndividual character attributes can be changed using morphing technology.\n\nDesigns can be easily exported into 3D animation software such as Maya or Cinema 4D.\n\nAdobe Character Animator\n\nBased on your facial expressions, it generates real-time face animations (eyebrows, lips, and eyes).\n\nBased on your actual movements, it automatically animates bodily movements (heads, arms, and legs).\n\nAutomatic audio lip-syncing\n\nThere are pre-designed “puppet” characters available.\n\nAdobe Photoshop and Illustrator input are supported.\n\nZoom and close-up photos\n\nPreset options for animating walking, breathing, blinking, and other actions\n\nResources For Video Game Character Animation Inspiration\n\nWhile inspiration can come from anywhere, we all need a little help narrowing it down. Here are some ideas for where to look for inspiration for character designs and video game character animation in general.\n\nOnline Resources\n\nDribbble: Dribbble is an excellent resource for learning about what the world has to offer in terms of design. Many designers and agencies showcase their work to provide inspiration.\n\nYoutube: Of course, YouTube is arguably the world’s largest content-sharing platform, so you’re bound to find a plethora of animated work to be inspired by.\n\nBlogs: Of course, animation blogs like Business of Animation can be a goldmine of information and inspiration for game character design and animation.\n\nPhysical Resources\n\nThere are numerous physical resources available, including textbooks, memoirs such as “The Illusion of Life Disney Animation” by Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas, and much more.\n\nWe also recommend Jonathan Cooper’s 2017 book, “Game Anim: A Complete Guide To Video Game Animation,” which is based on nearly two decades of industry experience.\n\n>>>Read more: Epic games real-time animation field guide free Ebook\n\nConclusion\n\nThe field of video game character animation has advanced in nearly unimaginable ways throughout the years. The realm of virtual reality is progressing at a rapid pace, with accurate motion capture blurring the barrier between video games and movies.\n\nWhile figuring it all out can be difficult, the positive is simply the abundance of content to educate and inspire, from textbooks and guidelines to Youtube channels and blogs.
