        "text": "Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi was booed out of a Tampa movie theater by activists protesting her stances on healthcare and immigration.\n\nBondi, a Republican, was there to see \"Won't You Be My Neighbor,\" a biographical film about TV star Mister Rogers.\n\nHecklers criticized Bondi for being part of a group of attorneys general suing to invalidate the Affordable Care Act, and for not taking a stand against the Trump administration's immigration policies.\n\nFlorida's Republican attorney general, Pam Bondi, was escorted out of a movie theater by police on Friday night after being confronted by labor activists over her positions on healthcare and immigration policy.\n\nBondi was attending a showing of \"Won't You Be Neighbor,\" the biographical film of children's TV star Mister Rogers. Rogers' show, \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,\" was beloved by generations of Americans for its focus on community and tolerance.\n\nVideos of the confrontation posted to Twitter show protesters heckling Bondi as she exited the theater. Maria Jos√© Chappa, a labor organizer in Tampa, said she and other activists tried to respectfully engage Bondi in a dialogue about her policies. When Bondi called the police, the interaction became hostile.\n\n\"What would Mister Rogers think about your legacy in Florida? Taking away health insurance from people with existing conditions? Shame on you! Shame on you!\" one protester can be heard shouting at Bondi as uniformed officers walked her to her car.\n\n\"You're a horrible person!\" yelled another.\n\nIn February, Bondi joined 19 other Republican attorneys general in a lawsuit to invalidate the landmark Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. This month, the Trump administration's Justice Department decided they wwould not challenge the suit.\n\nIf the lawsuit against the ACA succeeds, people with pre-existing conditions would no longer be guaranteed healthcare coverage. Florida Sen. Bill Nelson estimated in a recent speech that about 7.8 million Floridians who live with pre-existing conditions would be affected.\n\nApproximately 1.7 million people in Florida get their health insurance through the market created by the ACA, and over 90% receive subsidies from the federal government to lower their premiums, according to the Orlando Sun Sentinel.\n\nBondi has also come under fire for her explicit and implicit support of the Trump administration's immigration policies.\n\nDozens of children separated from their parents and taken into custody as a result of the Trump administration's \"zero-tolerance\" immigration policy are currently being held in south Florida shelters, along with over 1,000 more children who arrived to the US without relatives.\n\nOne activist can be heard asking, \"Would Mr. Rogers take children away from their parents?\" Unlike Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Bondi has not publicly come out against the family separations.\n\nBondi is the latest in a slew of Republican officials to be heckled in public spaces over the zero-tolerance policy. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and White House adviser Stephen Miller were booed out of Mexican restaurants in the DC area.\n\nOn Saturday, the owner of the Red Hen restaurant in Lexington, Virginia kicked out a group of dinner guests, including White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, over moral objections to the Trump administration's policies."
