Then a 31-year-old editor of Inside Film Magazine, he had been to film school with Benz at the University of Melbourne’s Victorian College of the Arts. He had taken a job at the magazine to keep engaged with an industry he loved but had no idea how to crack.\n\nFoulkes was a 23-year-old fledgling actor who was never supposed to be there. When Benz’s first choice for the girlfriend role quit, she stepped up.\n\n“It was a rehearsal kiss within 15 minutes of us meeting, on a mattress on a [living room] floor,” says Michod, who fell for his co-star “straightaway. I still call it the greatest weekend of my life.”\n\nFoulkes took a little more convincing.\n\n“I was very young,” she recalls. “I was like: ‘Ah shit, I really like him but it is too soon … I had plans, I was going to go and live in Spain’ … There were all these other things that I wanted to do. And then, you know, life gives you different options.”\n\nSeventeen years on, Foulkes and Michod have emerged as one of Australia’s most intriguing film-making couples. Both belong to the powerhouse Blue-Tongue Films, a collective of creatives who have played a crucial role in the exchange of talent between the United States and Australia, providing opportunities for the next generation of Australians in Hollywood and for international films to be made here.\n\nWe both feel like we’re … forging our own careers. We’re fairly private as well.\n\nMirrah Foulkes, filmmaker\n\nFoulkes boasts a heavyweight acting resume (think TV classics such as Blue Heelers, All Saints, Top of the Lake, Hawaii Five-0, Harrow and The Crown) but she has also written and directed three award-winning short films and a movie, Judy & Punch, which premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival. Judy & Punch is a searing #MeToo revenge tale set amidst puppeteers in a 17th century English town.\n\nShot around Melbourne, it stars Hollywood favourites Mia Wasikowska and Damon Herriman. It generated a slew of Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts Award nominations (including Best Direction and Best Screenplay for Foulkes) and wins for actor Herriman and the movie’s composer Francois Tetazdebute.\n\nIt put Foulkes on the map.\n\nMarynowsky describes Blue-Tongue as “unique” and “inspiring” because “first and foremost they are good friends, they aren’t in competition with each other … and they tackle everything – stunts, writing, editing, everything – all at once”.\n\nBlue-Tongue began in Sydney in 1996 when four filmmaker wannabes: stuntmen Nash Edgerton and Tony Lynch (who has since left) plus drama graduates Kieran Darcy-Smith and Nash’s younger brother Joel made an action-packed, eight-minute film called Loaded, about some buddies buying a gun. They named themselves after the Edgerton brothers’ pet lizard.\n\nBy the early 2000s, Blue-Tongue had an office in the same Darlinghurst building that housed Michod’s magazine. Nash talked him into joining and he recalls going, “Okay, sure I like hanging out with you guys, it’s fun.”\n\nThe core was friendship fuelled by a shared passion for cinema. Blue-Tongue’s members bounced script ideas off each other, badgered each other into launching projects and helped out where they could to get things finished.\n\nPeople were talking about us like we were a movement when we were just a bunch of friends.\n\nDavid Michod, filmmaker\n\n“We were frightened,” says Michod, who had begun writing Animal Kingdom. “We didn’t know how to have a career. We thought there was safety in numbers and that if we all just mucked in together, we’d work something out. And then it took on a power of its own.”\n\nThat moment arrived at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival.\n\n“I was [there] with a short film that I’d made called Crossbow, Nash was there with a short film called Spider that I had co-written with him, and Spencer Susser [was there] with a short film called I Love Sarah Jane, that I co-wrote with him, too,” recalls Michod.\n\n“People were talking about us like we were a movement when we were just a bunch of friends. We came to recognise … there was a power in milking the brand a little bit. As cynical as that sounds … it was good for all of us.” Not least when The New York Times’ arts section profiled the Australian trio in a front-page story.\n\n“On the back of three short films,” Michod laughs.\n\nMichod kept working on Animal Kingdom (“10 years of writing and writing and rewriting and starting from scratch about four times”) until the screenplay “felt good, which happened to coincide with me hanging out with those guys and having champions in them”.\n\n“Joel was a major part of that, [he] was becoming a famous actor at the time and really wanted to help me get this thing made. He attached his name to it early, helped me make the [2007] short Crossbow, which played at Sundance … all with the aim of getting Animal Kingdom made.\n\n“It’s easy enough to write something at home by yourself but taking the next step to actually making it is gigantic, and you only really do that if your friends are forcing you to.”\n\nFoulkes is nodding in agreement. “Yeah, yeah,” she says. “Shaming you into it.”\n\nFoulkes identifies Nash Edgerton as the glue that keeps Blue-Tongue together. Without the support of the Blue-Tongue gang, Foulkes doubts she would ever have directed.\n\n“It’s like any group of friends that are pushing and encouraging each other,” she says. “It just happened to have a name and … fall under the banner of a collective. We never channelled it into any sort of business model, which I think has been a saving grace.”\n\nMichod says he never wanted to: “My theory has always been that the thing will fall apart if we do that – that its strength is its friendship and its generosity … We are all weird, moody creatures, and it needs flexibility.”\n\nPart of that, these days, means allowing Blue-Tongue to splinter.\n\n“It was much easier [to stay connected] when all of us were semi-unemployed and only working on small things,” says Michod. “As the projects started getting bigger it kind of forced us off down our own tributaries.”\n\nFoulkes disagrees. “It’s still alive and strong. Spencer and I are working on something at the moment … and you and Joel are into your third or fourth writing project.”\n\n“True,” concedes Michod. “Nash has a short that is the third in our trilogy. There was Spider, Bear and now Shark that has just played at Sydney and Toronto [film festivals].”\n\nLoading\n\nAs well as neo-noir thrillers like The Square, directed by Nash Edgerton and written by Joel, Blue-Tongue is also the force behind hit TV crime/comedy drama, Mr Inbetween.\n\nFoulkes has just begun directing the new season of Upright, Tim Minchin’s critically acclaimed black comedy. Michod is happy, for the moment, “just floating around and writing”.\n\n“My advice to aspiring filmmakers is always the same,” he says. “Find your peers, find your friends, grab the ones who feel the same way you do and then just make stuff together.\n\n“Find your Blue-Tongue.”\n\nAustralians & Hollywood: a tale of craft, talent, and ambition runs from January 21 to July 17, at the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia in Canberra.\n\nA cultural guide to going out and loving your city.
