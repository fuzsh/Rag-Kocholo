I can't image how crazy or frustrating it gets when a studio is in crunch.\n\nReally puts things into perspective. The industry needs to figure something out.\n\nThere's too many games around nowadays. Can't we allow more dev time to help get rid of crunch and then we can all buy more games?\n\nI dunno would be interesting if dev cycles just got longer and crunch still had to happen :/\n\nThe industry needs to figure something out.\n\nUnionize.\n\nCan't we allow more dev time to help get rid of crunch and then we can all buy more games?\n\nThat's not how capitalism works though. Main goal of every corporation is to please its board and shareholders. They do that by making bigger and bigger profits each year.\n\nFeel like Rockstar should be in the thread title.\n\nFuckers.\n\nTried to but couldn't figure out how to put it in within the space limit.\n\nThis kind of thing was already known of Team Bondi but still, can't have too many examples. Disgusting behavior.\n\n-edit-\n\nAh, I see Toumari already digged out a few stories.\n\n30 min for a break is pretty long usually you are allowed 10-15 min. 30 min to an hour is a lunch break so if the people who were just hanging out at the kitchen conversing on company time I can see why the higher ups would be mad. If you are working crunch you usually have a lunch and dinner break available. They should have just coordinated their breaks together if they really wanted to have cake.\n\nMan, that really sucks. What a genuinely nice thing she was doing.\n\ni'm not getting red dead 2 because of their labour practices\n\n(maybe i'll get it used one day or on a deep discount)\n\nwhat a commitment\n\nhow fucked up is all this. rockstar should be held accountable for running their business like this. i know people literally can't not play RDR2, but i encourage everyone to get a used copy of the game if you can wait a bit, don't support and encourage their behavior.\n\nThat sounds so depressive...I honestly feel bad about buying RDR2 next week,but I guess not buying it would be worse for the devs.\n\nI know this is team bondi,but she made it clear the order came from R.\n\n30 min for a break is pretty long usually you are allowed 10-15 min. 30 min to an hour is a lunch break so if the people who were just hanging out at the kitchen conversing on company time I can see why the higher ups would be mad.

Noire was also famous for the terrible management of Team Bondi themselves.\n\nThat's not accurate though, because L.A.

Noire Crunch Culture, Bondi issues, RockStar Boss chimes in #NoCakeDay\n\nFeel like cake and rockstar should be in that title lol\n\nFuck that shet. Working that many hours is truly awful, especially if you are limiting employees from having breaks (highly unethical). I am glad that I have zero interest in any of Rockstar's games\n\nWell, I already have more than enough stuff to play for now and was considering waiting for RDR2 anyway. Will get it used off eBay later after all this.\n\nNot like it's gonna make a difference, but hey.\n\n30 min for a break is pretty long usually you are allowed 10-15 min. 30 min to an hour is a lunch break so if the people who were just hanging out at the kitchen conversing on company time I can see why the higher ups would be mad.

Even given Rockstar parted ways with the studio after the controversy regarding working conditions?\n\nDan Houser's comments yesterday refuting 100 hour crunch weeks don't seem too innocent in light of this.\n\nSo are we just taking someone at their word that it was Rockstar pressuring Team Bondi to shut down cake day, or was it Team Bondi's management being shit? Even given Rockstar parted ways with the studio after the controversy regarding working conditions?\n\nIt says right in the OP it was the publisher (Rockstar) putting on pressure on her for cake day.\n\nMaybe\n\nL.A.
