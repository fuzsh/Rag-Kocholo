        "text": "Every review of L.A. Noire has praised its use of MotionScan technology, which was invented by a company called Depth Analysis, a subsidiary of Team Bondi. Every actor featured in L.A. Noire performed while being filmed by 32 MotionScan cameras. While performing, the actors had to sit perfectly still in a space-age chair in an empty white room. Previous video-game facial animation tracked how quadrants of the human face moved, which meant that any facial movement that was not tracked was extrapolated. MotionScan cameras, however, capture everything right down to the pores, after which the footage is algorithmically converted into a three-dimensional head model. The end result is tics, expressions, and actorly flourishes hitherto impossible for video games to capture.\n\nThere are times in L.A. Noire when its characters’ faces look more like cell-shaded film than digital animation. The prideful way Phelps’ chin dimples when he is complimented; the blinky distress of the man who learns that an old friend has been murdered; the glistening defiance within a mob boss’ small, hard eyes; the sigh of roused duty from Phelps’ sad-sack, conscience-stirred partner: MotionScan, for those developers who elect to use it, changes everything about how games can employ actors, and it is heartening that the first game to exploit this technology has done so with such cunning. In L.A. Noire, interpersonal hermeneutics (that is, how we read and interpret the human face) becomes an important gameplay element, as it is how the player decides whether the suspects and witnesses Phelps interrogates are being truthful or evasive.\n\nThe other element of L.A. Noire that just about everyone has praised is its story. Here, I think, more critical sobriety is warranted. This is not to say that L.A. Noire‘s story is not good; its story is frequently good. But it borrows so brazenly from the filmic canon of American Noire (Chinatown, L.A. Confidential, even a plot point from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? finds its way into the proceedings) that its story quite often seems scavenged. That said, L.A. Noire is utterly committed to its storytelling, and I imagine that Brendan McNamara, its principal author, would spurn the go-to phrase of plenary indulgence gamers use to describe even highly successful video-game storytelling: “Good story — for a game.” L.A. Noire wants more than that. It wants to be a good story: full stop.\n\nPlenty of games have “good stories” if by “good” we mean stories that are absorbing, imaginative, and contain interesting characters. Take the Uncharted games, both of which boast storytelling that is equal to, and frequently betters, the classier breed of action film. The Uncharted games’ authored story put forth an immensely likable treasure-hunting rogue named Nathan Drake. The Uncharted games’ player-generated story put forth a conscienceless mass murderer named Nathan Drake, who in my play-through of Uncharted 2 killed nearly 800 people. That is Charlie Starkweather + Richard Ramirez + Ted Bundy x 10. That is 1½ My Lai massacres. The extremity of these and other internal disconnects is what makes “Good story — for a game” such an ineradicable part of gamer discourse. Many game stories, even terrific game stories, are conceived in such a way as to be incapable of expressing the same thing at the same time. There are a few exceptions to this, but they are rare.\n\nThose who are immune to the pleasures of video-game storytelling argue that games have far more in common with music and visual art than film and literature. According to this view, games are primarily rule sets or interactive systems, and it is in these arenas where the true art of video games resides. This is undoubtedly true, but must it be an excluding truth? No one, after all, ever gathered around a campfire to hear a rule set. It may be that our existing storytelling models are, in many ways, ill-suited to video games. Perhaps the video game medium is not a storytelling medium at all but an experiential medium in which storytelling possibilities are allowed to occur. Few games have been better positioned to help resolve this issue than L.A. Noire.\n\nHere is how the storytelling of L.A. Noire works: Something bad happens — a murder, a hit-and-run, arson — a glimpse of which crime the player is usually given. A few hours after the bad thing has transpired, Phelps and his partner are briefed by their commanding officer, after which they make their way to the crime scene. When they get to the crime scene, they look for clues and interview a few people and scare up some leads. They follow up on these leads. Eventually, they make one or more arrests. The arrests are followed by Phelps’ interrogation of one or more suspects, after which he charges someone with a crime, and the case is closed. By mid-game, it becomes clear that many of the cases Phelps is investigating are connected. Twenty-five hours — or 8.3 screenings of the Titanic — later, the game ends. That is how the storytelling is L.A. Noire works, and the story it tells is predetermined. About the only things your in-game decisions are able to affect are the length of the investigations and the order in which you pursue your leads.\n\nYou are asked to drive a lot in L.A. Noire — the game world takes around 20 minutes to traverse — but you do not have to. If you ask your partner to drive, you are skipped to your destination, which allows you to excellently defeat the purpose of an open-world game. Now, driving from one end of Los Angeles to the other is not exactly storytelling. Neither is walking Phelps up a hill, across a warehouse, down the sidewalk, or into a travel agency. You do a lot of bullshit in video games generally, but in open-world games you do an extraordinary amount. This creates a fascinating tension that I believe is unique to video games, and it is a tension that open-world games particularly inflame. Most video games are defined by arbitrary hindrances, such as restricting which buildings you can enter, and magical allowances, such as regenerating health. One might think this would foreclose any expectation of narrative realism on the part of the player. For many players, though, it is the opposite.\n\nIn a game narrative like L.A. Noire, the player effectively becomes a kind of reality reenactor. This leads to the player’s subconscious or half-conscious desire for commensurate narrative realism, even though this is a desire that makes precisely no sense. (Other, and quite possibly wiser, players have a simpler reaction. “Why am I doing all this?” they ask, and stop playing.) L.A. Noire is, or tries to be, a forensically realistic game, and the player’s willingness to engage in modestly plausible silly activity is the game’s central driving force. Happily, L.A. Noire has given its B.S. activity enough ancillary interest that you not only give into it; you eagerly seek out more of it. The problem — my problem — is that you also wind up wanting B.S. activity’s handmaiden, which is to say narrative realism, and that is, for me, where a lot of L.A. Noire‘s smaller problems begin. For instance, whenever Phelps needs something — an address, quick access to just about anyone’s criminal records, and (my favorite) the precise location of “hobo camps” — he calls dispatch. Which always has the answer. Instantly. In 1947. But this is video-game logic along the lines of Phelps’ magically self-repairing car. It is not, in other words, a true violation of realism. A true violation of realism occurs when a suspect runs from Phelps and leads him and his partner on a high-speed chase that ends with the suspect flipping out his truck in the middle of a busy Los Angeles street. After some justifiably hostile questioning, Phelps tells the guy he is under arrest. “What for?” the guys asks. I dunno. All the illegal stuff you just did?\n\nAs far as L.A. Noire‘s B.S. activity goes, the best and most fulfilling is its investigations. Say you find a pair of glasses at a crime scene, which you dutifully pick up and inspect. On the glasses’ inside ear stem you spot the designer’s name. Later, at the victim’s house, you find a glasses case made by the same designer. Aha. The glasses you found at the crime scene were taped together, but during your interview of the victim’s wife, she mentions that the glasses are new. Liar!\n\nActually finding the clues is something else. What this boils down to in practice is walking around while spamming the action button. Here many will be reminded of Heavy Rain, a game whose servitude to cinematic grammar and fearless incorporation of B.S. activity (this is a game in which you set a table, prepare an omelet, and rock a baby to sleep) makes L.A. Noire look like Missile Command. One of the most ridiculed segments of Heavy Rain finds its hero, Ethan, looking for his son, Jason, in a shopping mall. While a growingly frantic Ethan wanders the mall, an X-button prompt appears on screen. When you press X, Ethan calls out Jason’s name. “Press X for Jason” has become gamer shorthand for arbitrary or pointless gameplay, and L.A. Noire has its own version of it, which is “Press X for Beer Bottle.” The game’s crime scenes are littered with beer bottles. Again and again, crime scene after crime scene, you pick up a beer bottle, hear Phelps dismiss it as “junk,” and you move him along, to the next beer bottle, which he picks up, inspects, and which is always also junk.\n\nWandering around while looking for stuff to inspect is a gameplay mechanic drawn from old-school adventure games such as The Secret of Monkey Island. L.A. Noire is wise to have poured this tasty vintage into such a handsome new skin, but unlike earlier adventure games, L.A. Noire never really communicates to the player what exactly makes something inspectable. Why are so many worthless objects inspectable? Why does Phelps even notice things like empty beer bottles? And why are some beer bottles inspectable and some not? This question grows more puzzling when you are hunting for clues in a suspect’s kitchen and discover that a wooden spoon is, for some reason, inspectable, while objects of equal or greater prominence are not. But what is the alternative? A game in which every object is inspectable? A game in which only clues are inspectable? You eventually come to accept that the rule set governing inspection is not supposed to be discernible, that the very arbitrariness of a beer bottle is why so many are inspectable. They are there to make clues seem like clues.\n\nThe other half of investigation is interrogation. You have three choices when confronted with a witness’ or suspect’s statement: accept it as the truth, doubt it, or accuse your interlocutor of lying. This is where L.A. Noire‘s talent for tormenting me first emerged. Early in the game, suspects and witnesses pretty baldly telegraph whether they might be pulling your leg, either by looking away, say, or rolling their eyes. So do you doubt obviously untruthful statements or do you designate them as lies? Recall, if you will, the taped-up, obviously not-new glasses I mentioned earlier. When the victim’s wife mentioned her husband’s glasses were new, I chose to doubt her statement. “Doubt” is a pretty mild word, all things considered. Thus I was not quite prepared when Phelps responded to my decision to doubt the woman by all but accusing her of murder. Phelps’ method of investigation is like a game of Bad Cop, Terrible Cop. His loose-cannon tendencies began to worry me, and soon I was basing my interrogation decisions not on the actors’ occasionally hammy nonverbal performance cues but on whether I could trust Phelps not to lose his shit. Thus I wrongly accused numerous shifty-eyed suspects of lying when I should have merely doubted them, blew countless leads by stupidly believing lies, and alienated dozens of friendly witnesses when I doubted statements I should have believed. If you regard the interrogation aspect of L.A. Noire as a game, you are going to have a terrible experience, because, as a game, it is not at all enjoyable.\n\nHere is how to “win” every interrogation: Accuse someone of lying. They will respond (idiotically) with a demand that you prove they are lying. A quick scan of your notes will tell you whether or not you have that proof. If you do not, you can back out of your accusation, and now you know you can doubt them safely. Even though at the end of every interrogation sequence L.A. Noire informs you how many “correct” answers you have wrung from your witnesses and suspects, conducting yourself during the interrogations as though there are correct answers is not wise. You are, I think, supposed to heed your gut instincts during L.A. Noire‘s interrogations, even if they are wrong, because it is not a game that is interested in punishing wrong answers. You can blunder your way through almost every interrogation and still close the case using other means, and you can even come to enjoy watching Phelps inexplicably lash out at every grieving widow, harmless bartender, and hospitalized teenage girl. Gamers are trained to view every video-game encounter as an input-output clash, but to approach L.A. Noire in this manner turns its most human element into something unpleasantly android. During interrogations, you are not supposed to control Cole Phelps. You can only guide him, as one might guide a slightly crazy boxer.\n\nIt is no surprise, then, that the interrogation sequences tend toward emotional incoherency. Phelps will say something rough and cutting to a witness, for instance, and the witness will respond with something equally hostile, which will higgledy-piggledy lead to a closing conversational exchange of concerned good tidings. The dialogue in a game like L.A. Noire is probably incapable of genuine emotional consistency, and its branching possibilities guarantee that some transitions will be combative. L.A. Noire‘s dialogue is also burdened with having to send actionable signals to the player. Scarcely any exchange in L.A. Noire does not, in some way, contain actionable material. Freer, more naturalistic dialogue has no obvious place in a game in which virtually everything that is said must give players important motivational and directional cues. Playing L.A. Noire, one cannot help but wonder whether an involved, character-driven story even belongs in an open-world video game. If a game like L.A. Noire is unable to pull this kind of thing off, can any video game?\n\nAbout halfway into L.A. Noire, I turned against it, harshly. Its story elements range in quality from clumsily effective to extremely good, and the “adventure gameplay” elements of the investigations are surprisingly absorbing. But L.A. Noire‘s more GTA-ish gameplay elements — the shooting and the driving and the fist fighting and the moving around, in other words — are so pedestrian in conception and execution that it becomes easy to believe the rumor that all of these elements were late additions Rockstar insisted upon out of fear that L.A. Noire would be seen as too boring. In what is probably cosmic justice, the elements intended to prevent the game from being boring are easily the game’s most boring elements. Take the “street crime” side missions, which typically end with a cut scene that shows Phelps shaking his head while the body of the guy he just shot is lifted into the back of the coroner’s hearse. When Cole Phelps has shot down his third perp of the day, this bookend of putative sobriety achieves an inadvertent hilarity.\n\nEqually hilarious are L.A. Noire‘s fist fights, the gameplay element most impressively devoid of interest. After the game’s seventh or eighth fist-fight, I broke my no-more-video-games-but-L.A. Noire pledge and popped into my Xbox 360 a game about which I had been curious for some time, 50 Cent: Blood on the Sand, which some regard as a great twinkling light of video-game preposterousness. If anything, this undersells the game’s feral charm. 50 Cent: Blood on the Sand is a third-person shooter in which the player controls the Vitamin Water mogul himself. The plot is as follows: A Middle Eastern concert promoter, unable to pay 50 Cent an agreed-upon $10 million, convinces 50 Cent to accept a diamond-covered skull as adequate recompense. Unfortunately, 50 Cent’s diamond-covered skull is stolen from him, which inaugurates a nation-wide rampage. The object of the game is to kill everything and earn money (killing people, luckily, earns you money), which makes 50 Cent: Blood on the Sand a rare game whose authored narrative is not at all disconnected from its player-generated narrative. Aside from the astonishing fact that 50 Cent agreed to the particulars of his portrayal within the game, the most interesting thing about 50 Cent: Blood on the Sand is how fun it is to play. Its batshit-crazy story revels, hilariously, in everything the medium does not do well. I played the game through in two days, after which I wondered if the single most damning thing about video games is the fact that one could argue, legitimately, that 50 Cent: Blood on the Sand is a better game than L.A. Noire.\n\nWhen I returned to L.A. Noire, I made the decision to stop thinking of it as a video game. Very quickly, something happened. In my notes I jotted down “L.A. Noire: the gay teenager of video games — i.e., ‘It gets better,'” but this was a flippant way to process a real attitudinal readjustment on my part. When I stopped thinking about him as someone with whom I was supposed to feel any kinship, Cole Phelps became a deeply compelling character. You begin the game strongly assuming that Phelps has a Dark Secret, and he does. But that is not the most interesting thing about him. The most interesting thing about Cole Phelps is that he is an asshole who might also be insane. Early in the game, Phelps stands in the living room of a husband who does not yet know that his wife has been murdered. Phelps decides to tell the man about his murdered wife in front of the man’s children. I originally regarded this as a bit of storytelling sloppiness, but no: Phelps does this because he is an asshole. How big of an asshole is Cole Phelps? In one of the game’s World War II flashbacks, we see Phelps, who is fighting in Japan as a Marine Corps lieutenant, tell his disgusted troops, all of whom have lost friends to the Japanese, that the United States brought Pearl Harbor upon itself. Yes, Phelps is a Pearl Harbor Truther. Once you accept that Phelps is not your avatar but a guided missile whose damage you are constantly trying to mitigate, L.A. Noire gives you an experience unlike any other game I have played.\n\nNear the end of L.A. Noire, its story begins to cross all manner of previously forbidden lines, among them the graphic depiction of a child’s corpse and a scene that turns upon a 13-year-old girl’s apparently consensual sexual relationship with a man in his 50s. L.A. Noire‘s most pertinent and nuanced theme emerges slowly: A cowardly man is not a bad man, and a brave man is not necessarily good. “Courage and cowardice exist in every man,” someone tells Phelps. “Get over it.” It is far more satisfying moment than it sounds. Meanwhile, the investigations, if anything, get even better, weirder, and more involved. In a sequence ripped more or less directly out of Chinatown, you use longitudinal coordinates to identify a parcel of land, figure out who owns the land via its Land Registry number, and finally tabulate the land’s insurance value on a primitive calculator. A lot of this gumshoeing, it should be said, L.A. Noire essentially does for you. But how wonderful, all the same, to know that B.S. activity as conceptually dull as the piecing together of an insurance scam can be a video game’s best part.\n\nInteractivity sabotages storytelling. There is no longer any use arguing to the contrary. Thus, the story of L.A. Noire can never be good — at least, not in the way it is trying to be. As a story, then, L.A. Noire is not successful. As a game, too, L.A. Noire fails. In a lot of ways, it is a terrible game: frustratingly arbitrary, puzzlingly noncommunicative, and not very fun. But I love L.A. Noire. I think it’s fantastic. What this suggests is that we need a new name for whatever it is that L.A. Noire does.\n\nOr do we? We actually have several names for it: “interactive film” or “interactive drama.” Both are blood-curdlingly redolent of everything that was wrong about the 1990s, when “games” like Night Trap were briefly thought to be where things were heading. The first games made by video-game developers who were given cameras and actors to work with made such a mess of things that almost no one since has gone back to what is, theoretically, a promising template. Rockstar and Team Bondi deserve immense credit for resurrecting an abandoned tradition and utilizing tools that the orthodoxies of game design have come to tell us are corrupt and wrong-headed and inappropriate. And maybe they are — if what we are talking about is video games.\n\nL.A. Noire comes closer than any previous digital experience to showing us where the hands are on the clock: half past movie, a quarter past video game, and a quarter to what, exactly? I have no idea, which is a large part of what makes the game wonderful. L.A. Noire‘s failures are not that important when weighed against its successes, and the first video game, or whatever we wind up calling it, to do perfectly what L.A. Noire does surprisingly well right now will be hailed as the real breakthrough. It is, finally, a game that made me certain, after months of morose uncertainty, that any writer who is not interested in what we are now calling “video games” is a bystander to one of the most important conceptual shifts between story and storyteller in a hundred years."
