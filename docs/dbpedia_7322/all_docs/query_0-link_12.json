        "text": "It's a sad thing to report that the studio behind the creative and thoroughly excellent LA Noire is closing down. Team Bondi worked with Rockstar to put out the crime thriller title, and is now out of business, despite the game being a smash hit critically and commercially.\n\nSo what happened? It's sort of a mystery at this point, but there have been a few controversies that could point to larger issues. In June, it came out that over 100 developers were left out of the final credits despite their extensive work on the game, and the slighted even launched a website to voice their complaints.\n\nBondi studio head Brendan McNamara also took some flak from ex-employees accusing him of \"mismanagment,\" which he denied. But something was clearly mismanaged as you don't produce a hit like this then shut down for no reason. Time will tell what really happened at Bondi, but for now we can only speculate.\n\nThe first title apparently took 7 years of development on Bondi's part, which is far above most games, and likely contributed to their ultimate downfall, as some employees were reporting they had to work 100 hour weeks to meet deadlines. The last we heard from Bondi about the matter was lead programmer Dave Heironymus saying \"no-one at Team Bondi is under the illusion that crunching is a good way to work and we're actively working to learn from our mistakes for our next project.\" Apparently they just didn't learn quickly enough.\n\nSo what will happen to LA Noire? Rockstar has a habit of turning its titles into franchises, and there's every reason to think that they will bring the name back with a new team. The game was far from perfect, but was a refreshing piece of original content in a landscape full of sequels. To call for another game may seem ironic, but that's how the industry deals with hits, and it stands to reason that with 4 million sold, we'll see another Noire adventure in a few years time."
