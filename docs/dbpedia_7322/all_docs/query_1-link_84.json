        "text": "Team Bondi Working on Two New Games\n\nBy Mike Sharkey |\n\nL.A. Noire studio finds new home with Kennedy Miller Mitchell Interactive.\n\nA lengthy feature in the The Australian Financial Review brings us the latest developments on George Miller's next Mad Max movie, Fury Road, as well as some tasty tidbits on the gaming front: Mad Max the videogame is being created by L.A. Noire mastermind Brendan McNamara, and Miller has also acquired the right's to McNamara's next game, Whore of the Orient.\n\nFinancial Review sat down with Miller and his partner Doug Mitchell in their studio as they finished up work on Happy Feet Two. In talking with Miller and Mitchell about production on the film, the publication learned that the remnants of L.A. Noire studio Team Bondi found a new home at Kennedy Miller Mitchell Interactive and immediately began working on Happy Feet Two. And now that the film is in theaters, McNamara and his crew are working on Whore of the Orient and a Mad Max game based on Fury Road.\n\n\"What's fascinating, though, is that Team Bondi immediately went to work on Happy Feet Two,\" Mitchell said. \"People can move from a game to a movie and be completely at home, because it's the same skills, process â€“ the same game.\"\n\n\"With the government's support we can immediately go forward with two games,\" Mitchell continued. \"Warner Bros is standing by, willing to do Fury Road; the incentive would bring it back here in a New York minute. It's not immediately obvious but the potential in the video games sector is massive.\"\n\n\"It's four-dimensional storytelling,\" Miller said about videogames. \"A game can literally become the equivalent of a novel. That is the thing that people like me who write screenplays envy about novelists: that you can actually stop time and explore little cul de sacs. Whereas in a movie, you'd love to stop and examine that character, but you can't. You're on a rail . . . and if you talk to Brendan [McNamara], who is the brilliant mind behind this, it's all the same issues as film. Instead of writing a 100-page screenplay, he wrote a 2800-page screenplay. But it's the same dialogue, acting, blocking, wardrobe, costume, lighting, vehicle simulations. It's a movie that's played interactively at home.\"\n\nNo details beyond mention of the two games were provided. Mad Max: Fury Road is set to begin filming in April 2012.\n\nSpy Guy says: Sounds like McNamara will stick to his pulpy roots with Whore of the Orient, a game I'd like to immediately present with GameSpy's \"Most Likely to Have a New Title at Launch\" award. As for a Mad Max game, looks like we won't see it until the film launches around 2013. Hopefully it will be worth the looong wait.\n\nGame Information"
