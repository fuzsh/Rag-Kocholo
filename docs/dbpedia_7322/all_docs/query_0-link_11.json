        "text": "Accusations have been levelled against L.A. Noire developer Rockstar and Team Bondi for leaving 130 developers out of the game's credits and for enforcing unfair work practices. These include making staff work 12 hour days as well as weekends.\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald heard evidence from the co-creators of L.A. Noire Credits, a website set up to properly credit all the people who crafted the acclaimed detective game.\n\nL.A. Noire Credits wrote to Eurogamer at the beginning of June.\n\nThe Sydney Herald heard from a developer who was pressed by his wife to leave Team Bondi after being forced to work up to 12 hour days as well as weekends. He worked at Team Bondi for three years. He left before L.A. Noire was completed and was struck from the credits. \"I felt as though my sanity depended on it,\" he told the Sydney Herald, explaining his reason for going.\n\nHe described Team Bondi as a \"virtually praise-free\" and \"inflexible\" environment.\n\n\"There has been a lot of press saying how incredible this is for the Australian gaming industry, since it is the biggest (and most successful) game made in Australia to date,\" he added.\n\n\"But that has come at the price that most of the people that worked on it will never have proof of having worked there (unless they want to pull out a paycheck).\"\n\nThe upshot is that those 130 staff - more than the entire Eldre Scrolls V: Skyrim team - allegedly left off the credits will have difficulty proving, to the small video games industry in Sydney, their role on one of Australia's top games.\n\nThis isn't the first time a Rockstar studio has been linked with shady working practices. Rockstar San Diego, the developer of Red Dead Redemption, was accused by an insider of \"deception\", \"manipulation\" and \"abuse\". That same studio was lambasted openly by the wives of Rockstar San Diego employees about torrid working conditions that included 12-hour days, Saturdays and no holiday or overtime pay.\n\nRockstar was accused of leaving staff off of credits back in 2006 during development of controversial stealth action game Manhunt 2. There were 55 uncredited staff then, according to a missing credits site.\n\nRockstar \"will not publish Team Bondi's next game\"\n\nRockstar Games will not work with LA Noire developer Team Bondi on any new projects soon, due to protracted development times, a lack of clear vision and mismanagement at a senior level.\n\nThat's the latest claim to hit the Australian developer, which has become embroiled in controversy following revelations about poor working practises, oppressive management by studio boss Brendan McNamara and a continuous crunch process over L.A. Noire's seven year development period.\n\nToday, GamesIndustry.biz reveals internal emails from top brass at Team Bondi, highlighting the company's extreme policies to overtime, pay freezes and crunching - as well as co-founder Brendan McNamara's volatile reputation.\n\n\"I've heard a lot about Rockstar's disdain for Team Bondi, and it has been made quite clear that they will not publish Team Bondi's next game,\" said an ex member of staff at the Australian studio.\n\n\"Team Bondi are trying to find another publisher for their next title, but the relationship with Rockstar has been badly damaged - Brendan treats L.A. Noire like a success due to his vision but I think Rockstar are the ones who saved the project. They continued to sink money into LA Noire, and their marketing was fantastic. Without their continued support, Team Bondi would have gone under several years ago.\"\n\nRockstar stepped in to publish L.A. Noire in 2006, a year after Team Bondi had announced a publishing deal with Sony for a PlayStation 3 exclusive. The game was originally due for release in 2009, but only hit stores in May 2011.\n\nLA Noire has been a hit with critics and sold well at retail, backed by a strong marketing campaign from Rockstar. The game has similarities to the mature-themed Grand Theft Auto titles, and it's claimed that Rockstar stepped in to ensure the title met its notoriously high production standards.\n\n\"Rockstar also made a huge contribution to the development; their producers were increasingly influential over the last two years of the game's development, and overruled many of the insane decisions made by Team Bondi management,\" said the source.\n\n\"At a lower level, Rockstar also pitched in with programmers, animators, artists, QA, etc. Part of the conflict between Team Bondi and Rockstar was due to Rockstar's frustration with Team Bondi's direction, and eventually Team Bondi's management in turn resented Rockstar for taking lots of creative control.\n\n\"It's also worth pointing out that Rockstar used to be very keen on making Team Bondi something like 'Rockstar Sydney' - the more they worked with Team Bondi management, the more they came to understand that this was a terrible idea.\"\n\nThe resentment towards Rockstar from Team Bondi is highlighted by McNamara's angry reaction to a redesigned LA Noire logo, which allegedly left out Team Bondi branding and which McNamara took as a slight on his company.\n\n\"Every dog has its day and there's going to be hell to pay for this one,\" wrote McNamara in an email intended for one designer but accidently sent to the entire team. \"I'll never forget being treated like an absolute **** by these people.\"\n\nThe full, in-depth exposé of Team Bondi's working practices can be read here."
