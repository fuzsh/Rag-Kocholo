        "text": "The final curtain has fallen on L.A. Noire studio Team Bondi.\n\nIt ain't over 'til it's over, as the saying goes, and now it appears to finally be over for Team Bondi, which was pronounced effectively dead back in early August [http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/112162-Asset-Sell-Off-Suggests-the-End-of-Team-Bondi] but has only just now had the official fork stuck in it. The company was put into administration a month ago and yesterday appointed a liquidator to wind up the operation. Whatever Team Bondi assets remain will be sold off, with the proceeds put toward payment of the company's outstanding debts.\n\nTeam Bondi has not yet issued a statement on the situation but it's a sad fall for a studio that at one point employed more than 100 workers and put out the acclaimed L.A. Noire [http://www.amazon.com/L-Noire-Playstation-3/dp/B002I0J5UQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1317831526&sr=8-1] less than six months ago. The game racked up nearly 900,000 sales in its first month of release, not exactly smash-hit territory but still very respectable, and became the \"fastest-selling new videogame IP ever\" in the U.K. Near the end of June, Take-Two announced that L.A. Noire had shipped four million copies worldwide. It's a deceiving metric - \"shipped\" isn't \"sold,\" after all - but the publisher has described the game as a \"powerful new franchise\" and a sequel is expected.\n\nOn the downside, truckloads of money were reportedly wasted on the project and complaints about unpleasant working conditions at Team Bondi and the behavior of studio head Brendan McNamara are well-documented, leaving Rockstar with no interest [http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/111445-Report-Rockstar-Saved-LA-Noire-Wont-Work-With-Team-Bondi-Again] in publishing its next game. That's a troublesome situation for any studio to be in.\n\nAs Happy Feet 2 [http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/112117-Rumor-Team-Bondi-Merging-With-Happy-Feet-2-Studio].\n\nSource: Develop [http://www.develop-online.net/news/38809/Team-Bondi-liquidated]\n\nPermalink\n\nSo I guess slicing off a bunch of game content to be used as pre-order \"bonuses\" and for sale dlc didn't work out as well as they thought.\n\nMaybe this will discourage crap like that in the future but it probably wont.\n\nXanthious said:\n\nGood! Couldn't of happened to a more deserving studio. I can't wait to read their letter blaming it all on used games.\n\nBut used games were their excuse for the sleazy pre-order scheme. They couldn't possibly plan on blaming us AND punishing us (with held back content).... like every other dev studio and publisher has been doing this generation.\n\nSmashLovesTitanQuest said:\n\nCan someone bring me up to date on the whole McNamara thing? I can only remember stories which seemed perfectly normal for a dev studio. Crunch time is called crunch time for a reason, you know.\n\nCan't remember the exact details, but there were also a lot of people left out of the credits, think it was people that worked on the game for extended periods, then left/were let go before it was done.\n\nSmashLovesTitanQuest said:\n\nCan someone bring me up to date on the whole McNamara thing? I can only remember stories which seemed perfectly normal for a dev studio. Crunch time is called crunch time for a reason, you know.\n\nThis is the link to the news article [http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/111340-IGDA-Investigating-L-A-Noire-Dev]\n\nThis part here says what was happening at Team Bondi if you believe them\n\nBrendan McNamara is accused by one of eleven anonymous insiders as \"the angriest person I've ever met\".\n\n\"It's one thing for him to be angry behind closed doors, but it was incredibly common for him to scream at whoever was pissing him off in the middle of the office,\" the person claimed.\n\nOther accounts of life at the Sydney studio say McNamara was \"required to sit isolated from everyone else\" following a visit from a team-building company.\n\n\"But that just made it worse, since he would then pace back and forth all day, bothering people even more,\" said another anonymous studio source.\n\nand sometimes 110 hours a week.\n\nOT: If all of the employees got a new job then I don't really mind the studio going, if it's true what they said about McNamara."
