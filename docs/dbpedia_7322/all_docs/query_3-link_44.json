        "text": "Bouddi Wild Swim\n\nDirected by Toni Houston\n\n​\n\nBondi Pavillion Theatre, Level 1\n\nThursday 21st March 2024, 8 pm - 9.30 pm\n\nBouddi Wild Swim is a meditation on human nature. Pitched against the vagaries of Mother Nature. In an increasingly challenging world.\n\nAt its heart is pure adventure. A group of ocean swimmers have a quest to swim 23 kilometres from Terrigal to Umina, along the rugged and often inaccessible shoreline of NSW’s Central Coast. At the centre of this course is Bouddi National Park. Bouddi means ‘heart’ in the local First Nations’ language. Mother Nature is mysterious and volatile here. The thick, twisted angophora forest is unmappable, and the ocean depths are cold, ripped by currents, and home to jellyfish and sharks.\n\nWith each challenge of Mother Nature, human nature is pushed to its limits of resilience and recovery. Through personal and planetary challenges, the swimmers persevere.\n\nFinally, the big day arrives. Although they’ve demonstrated incredible skill and will, whether they ’succeed’ isn’t up to them. It’s up to Mother Nature. And what she does on the day…\n\nBouddi Wild Swim fuses classic observational documentary filmmaking with lyrical, cinematic devices - including underwater, drone and dramatization - to tell this unique story whose dramatic finale will sear into memory.\n\n​\n\n​Panel with – the film’s Director and Editor -- Toni Houston, Producer -- Sarah Beard, and ocean swimmers Chris Young and Nicole Holyer after the screening.\n\nMacquarie Island\n\nBondi Pavillion Theatre, Level 1\n\nSaturday 23rd March 2024, 3:30pm - 4:30 pm\n\nExplore the stunning natural beauty and abundant marine life of Australia’s remote Macquarie Island in this captivating short film. Join scientist and polar adventurer Tim Jarvis AM on a journey through this wildlife haven, halfway between Tasmania and Antarctica. Delight in the belly-thumping antics of elephant seals and the inquisitive charm of royal penguins – found only on “Macca”.\n\n​\n\nWith the Southern Ocean under growing pressure from climate change and industrial fishing, Jarvis makes the case for fully protected marine sanctuaries to safeguard the feeding and breeding grounds of our unique Sub-Antarctic wildlife.\n\nOn the back of this film and a campaign by Save Our Marine Life alliance, supported by thousands of Australians, the Albanese Government last year tripled the size of Macquarie Island Marine Park, declaring 93 percent of it a marine sanctuary. Macquarie Island – Australia’s Jewel in the Southern Ocean is, ultimately, a story of hope, showing how vision, tenacity and political will can turn a once pest-ravaged island into a world-class conservation success story.\n\n​\n\nYou’ll hear from polar explorer and South Australian of the Year, Tim Jarvis AM, on what makes Macquarie Island so unique. And Fiona Maxwell, National Oceans Manager at the Pew Charitable Trusts, on the campaign to protect this Australian jewel.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nThe Power of Activism\n\nDirected by Steve Pasvolsky\n\nBondi Pavillion Theatre, Level 1\n\nSaturday 23rd March 2024, 5 pm - 6:30 pm\n\nTHE POWER OF ACTIVISM shines a positive new light on a group of young female activists who are risking it all to change the future thinking of governments and major companies. In true ‘David versus Goliath’ style, these inspirational scientists and conservationists challenge the thinking of out-dated practices that are contributing to climate change.\n\nThe screening will be followed by a Q&A with Director, Steve Pasvolsky, who has produced a broad range of documentaries for National Geographic, Discovery and the ABC, Producer Michelle Dado-Millynn, a passionate environmentalist, designer and educator, Actuary, Kirsten Armstrong, Director of Impact Investing at Social Ventures Australia, and activist Alice Forrest, a marine biologist, science communicator and wildlife guide, with a passion for the natural world.\n\nWatch Trailer\n\n​"
