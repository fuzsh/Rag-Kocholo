        "text": "Developers of Team Bondi and Rockstar Games’ 2011 game “L.A. Noire” are reportedly re-teaming on a new game – another title set in 1940s Los Angeles.\n\nThe news comes from a now deleted post on Instagram by Australian composer and performer Freyja Garbett.\n\nAccording to Eurogamer and VGC, said post showed video of musical score being recorded and was described as the “second video games session recording” along with featuring a ‘jazz band’.\n\nThey added that they were grateful for the opportunity of writing for the video game which is titled “Sowden House” and described as a “psychological thriller set in 1940s L.A. that will have you questioning your sanity’.\n\nSowden House is the name of the home owned by Dr. George Hodel who was one of the lead suspects in the infamous Black Dahlia murder. It was even claimed that the murder took place in the house itself.\n\nNo word on how or even if this will directly link in some way to the continuity of “L.A. Noire”.\n\nTeam Bondi was closed following the release of “L.A. Noire,” but team members went to the studio Video Games Deluxe which then worked on “L.A. Noire: The V.R. Case Files”.\n\nAt last report several years ago, the studio indicated on LinkedIn that they were gearing up for an “AAA open world title in VR for Rockstar”. Nothing about said project has been revealed since."
