        "text": "Forget outer space hijinks and homicidal artificial intelligence --the hottest new game in the video game business doesn't take place in an apocalyptic future. L.A. Noire (released this week by Rockstar Games for Sony's PlayStation 3 and Microsoft's Xbox 360) is set in a moody, meticulously detailed version of 1947 Los Angeles.\n\nThe game is a classic noir murder mystery, following a police officer through his investigations. It's earning great reviews for innovative game play that requires players to hunt down clues and question subjects, as well as graphics so detailed that the player can tell if a suspect is lying by watching their body language and facial expressions.\n\nL.A. Noire's designers at Team Bondi Studio achieved such unprecedented realism using a motion capture technology from Sydney, Australia-based Depth Analysis. The sophisticated system uses 32 cameras to record every nuance of an actor's expressions, and then translates that detail into a computer-animated character.\n\nI interviewed two of the key players in the game's development over email: Brendan McNamara, founder and director of Team Bondi, and Oliver Bao, head of R&D at Depth Analysis.\n\nEwalt: Last month, L.A. Noire was the first video game to be screened at the Tribeca Film Festival. It's blurring the lines between game and film... so how should gamers approach it? Is just a game with particularly good cinematics? Or is it some new kind of interactive fiction?\n\nBrendan McNamara: First and foremost, we’re video game makers and we developed L.A. Noire as a game first, this is something that we have never lost sight of regardless of the cinematic and filmic aspects of the audience’s experience. What we’re adding to the mix is the cinematography of a film and the characterization and character development of a TV show.\n\nThanks to the revolutionary new MotionScan technology from the Depth Analysis studio, this platform has really allowed us to bring the characters to life in a way that has yet to be seen in a video game. When we’re able to combine the strengths of TV and films with the interactivity of video games, we’re left with the open possibility of an amazing blank canvas where video games evolve and can build to be the predominant form of entertainment for the 21st century. I think Geoff Gilmore (TriBeCa Enterprises’ COO) and the TriBeCa team saw that we were on the cusp of something innovative with L.A. Noire and how this game in particular is a vanguard showcase for that future.\n\nOliver Bao: To add to Brendan’s note, I think it’s definitely a new kind of interactive entertainment. With MotionScan as a key driver behind how the narrative can be told through believable performance in video games, this tech brings storytelling to a whole new level never seen before in a video game. But it is still a game with classical gameplay features such as car chases and shoot outs. Hopefully, both gamers and film lovers should find something they like.\n\nWhat was it like working with the MotionScan system?\n\nOB: Using MotionScan for L.A. Noire, we shot over 2,200+ pages of script with 400+ actors. We worked intensively across 82 days that included reshoots and pickups as well. It was definitely a great debut for the technology.\n\nBMc: From the ground up, MotionScan was always designed to make the process as unobtrusive as possible for the actor. With any actor we capture, they first go through hair and make up, but with MotionScan they don't have special paint or markers on their faces like traditional motion capture. Once in the studio, they sit in a chair with 32 HD cameras (pairs of 16) surrounding them to capture different angles as they perform, which then get pieced together to form a 3D head. It’s still a very new process and very different compared to motion capture for film or television. Depth Analysis is now working on Full Body Capture technologies that allows for the actor to be in costume and to walk around and perform – this means they are wholly captured and instantly converted into 3D. We’re excited to see how this technology will open up the endless possibilities around games and films when it’s up and running.\n\nAre tools like this making your job easier or harder? Is it not enough to be a talented designer now... you have to be a director too?\n\nBMc: Actually, I look at it the other way. If game creators want to have really believable characters in their game, the question then is… how do you go about getting them to that stage? When we conceived L.A. Noire, conventional technologies weren't driving what we envisioned. So we went down this route, and now we have these tools we can make games that match our vision and create characters that are no longer just cannon fodder. With MotionScan, we can authentically create characters that our audiences genuinely care about.\n\nI think that's really liberating for the games business and the people who make games. Yes, they may have to learn some new skills but there isn't really a shortage of good directors, actors and casting agents out there. In this industry, working with all these people will make games and games performance significantly better. It’s key to learn about what we all do and how we can work together.\n\nOB: Certainly for me working with people like [actors] Aaron Staton and John Noble, and a director like Mike Uppnedahl was easy. They are all very good at their craft so it makes my job that much easier. MotionScan provides more options for game designers empowering them to tell a more engaging story. A good script and cinematics have always been at the centre of a story driven game. We hope these tools help them take it to the next level.\n\nDo you worry about making characters too realistic? How do you keep characters from entering the \"uncanny valley?\"\n\nBMc: I don't worry about that too much. Over time CG representations have gotten better and better. It’s hard to fault the reproduction of cars, buildings and guns in video games but players have always had to grin and bear with the characters. As a gamer, you always have to convince yourself that the character you’re seeing is real, even though your brain is telling you otherwise. I would say that we’re not out of the valley yet but we’re also not even at Version 1.0 with this new technology. We’ve been astounded by the reactions that people are having towards the characters in L.A. Noire and I’m convinced that within one further generation of hardware we can begin to make games look as good as film or TV.\n\nHow does MotionScan change the actual gameplay? Are there particular mechanics or puzzles in L.A. Noire that wouldn't have been possible without it?\n\nOB: The core gameplay mechanism is the notebook system where the player can question and interrogate persons of interest. This relies heavily on being able to read their facial expressions, and without MotionScan, this would not have been possible to create.\n\nBMc: Also, L.A. Noire is a police procedural detective game, where you control the detective. With this as a starting point, the key objectives in any police procedural, once you have found you evidence and spoken to you witnesses, is the interrogation of your key suspects. We knew that to make this aspect of the game work, we needed to be able to tell whether your suspect was lying. So it was key to capture the right performance where you didn’t need any other technology other than human nature to read the characters’ faces. The main feature of the game concentrates more on unraveling the case as Det. Cole Phelps and how you can decipher which characters are trying to misdirect you, what evidence you can challenge them with, the art of who is telling the truth or lying. I don’t think this new experience would be available to gamers without the help of MotionScan.\n\nHow are motion capture technologies going to evolve and change video games? What will you be able to do in 5 or 10 years that you can't do now?\n\nOB: As technologies improve, we should see even more realistic performances and/or at reduced production cost. The ultimate goal is to scan full body and render them back in real time on a console. This is Depth Analysis' next development and future roadmap.\n\nBMc: We are also in the process of doubling the resolution of what you see now so the accuracy of each pixel is much greater. We are doing feature tracking so we can specify lots of different shaders for different parts of a character’s face, including tracking lips for very glossy lipstick or tracking eyes so that we can have much more complex reflections. I think you will also see much better skin and hair, and of course the team is working on Full Body so the clothes and movements of an actor will have as much life as their face.\n\nAs games become more film-like, they become more accessible to non-gamers... but at the same time, L.A. Noire is a big, complicated sandbox game. Do you think inexperienced or new video game players will be able to enjoy it?\n\nBMc: L.A. Noire is a completely new type of video game, and that’s been down to the support and vision of Rockstar who continue to bring new experiences to all types of audiences. It is a new game but it’s also a very familiar format - the TV cop show - so we believe that most people will be familiar with it. From a gameplay standpoint, it’s also a completely different pace. The player isn’t forced to defend themselves every second of playtime, with L.A. Noire we’re asking you to use your intelligence… such as surveying a crime scene, looking for evidence, and talking to witnesses. Any level of player can be involved. The hard part is putting all the evidence together and making sense of the crime - not the physical skills needed to play the game. We invite entertainment fans to try it out.\n\nWhat specific noir films, books and music influenced L.A. Noire's design? Can you provide an example of a specific character or scene and what inspired it?\n\nBMc: Our list is endless… Hammett, Chandler, Ellroy. Out of the Past, The Big Sleep, Nightmare Alley, Sweet Smell of Success, House of Bamboo, Asphalt Jungle, to name a few. The first “Patrol Case” has very big homage to the film Murder My Sweet in finding the main clue. Murder My Sweet was of course based on Chandler's High Window. There are many examples if you care to look into it.\n\nWhat's the next game you're working on? Should we expect more L.A. Noire episodes, or something different?\n\nBMc: We still have some significant cases that we weren't able to cram onto the game's disc. Both Team Bondi and Rockstar hope that L.A. Noire will really resonate with gamers as well as film and TV buffs. If our consumers show enough interest I’m sure the team will want to develop more tales from the sordid underbelly of 1947. Right now, we just wrapped six years in making L.A. Noire so we are also looking at a completely new title but the team will be taking their holidays and having a break as consumers finally get their hands on the game.\n\nExcluding anything you've worked on, what games are you currently playing, or most excited to play?\n\nOB: I haven’t had as much time to play new releases except for the Call of Duty: MW2 and Left for Dead 2. I would love to check out Crysis2, and Batman: Arkham City next.\n\nBMc: I’m like most people in the industry in that I’m loyal to certain development teams who always bring you quality entertainment. The last game I played was Red Dead Redemption and I think Rockstar San Diego and the other Rockstar teams involved did an incredible job with that and we certainly benefited enormously from their help and from what they learned on that game. I’m a big fan of Naughty Dog so I’m looking forward to what they do next with Uncharted. And like the rest of the world I’m intrigued to know what happens next with Half Life - I hope they go third person."
