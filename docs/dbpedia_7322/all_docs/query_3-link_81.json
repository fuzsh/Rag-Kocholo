        "text": "Thanks to the sizzling chemistry between its stars, Anyone But You began making headlines before it even had a name. Our romantic leads, Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell had us hooked as we watched them filming on the Opera House steps, gallivanting around Sydney, and just generally making our hearts flutter with their flirty vibes.\n\nWhile Sweeney, who is engaged, shut down the rumours as simply acting, if this is the case, we can’t wait to see these two spice up the screen.\n\nAnd now, we’ve received a new trailer for the summer’s must-watch rom-com. (Watch below. Story continues after video)\n\nWe also have some first-look photos from the film that have our hearts a-flutter.\n\nOne key image shows a perplexed Sweeney jumping out the back of a white Land Rover, while a suit-wearing Glen Powell surely awaits to take her hand. And in the background sits another icon: the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the film, including some of the filming locations you’ll recognise around Sydney (the city).\n\nWhat Is The Plot Of ‘Anyone But You’?\n\nWritten by Ilana Wolpert and director Will Gluck, the film follows two “arch nemeses”, Bea and Ben (Sweeney and Powell), who reunite after a failed one-night-stand at a destination wedding in Australia. In order to reach their separate romantic goals – i.e. reject an ex-fiance and win the heart of a carefree Australian goddess – they pretend to be a couple for reasons we don’t yet know.\n\nThe film is loosely based on Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing.\n\nWho Is In The Cast Of ‘Anyone But You’?\n\nAs we know by now, the film stars Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell as main characters Bea and Ben. Sweeney you’ll know from her massive success in Euphoria and White Lotus season one.\n\nIf you’re wondering where you’ve seen Powell before, it could have been in 2022’s biggest blockbuster, Top Gun, or on the Netflix rom-com, Set It Up.\n\nThe film introduces a couple of rising Australian stars, including model Charlee Fraser and the ‘Hemsworth-ian’ Joe Davidson.\n\nThe film, directed by Easy A director Will Gluck, also stars Rachel Griffiths (Muriel’s Wedding), Dermot Mulroney (My Best Friend’s Wedding, Wedding Date), Alexandra Shipp (X-Men: Apocalypse, Barbie) and Darren Barnett (Never Have I Ever).\n\nWhat Was The Behind The Scenes Drama On ‘Anyone But You’?\n\nDuring filming, a few choice photos and videos of Sydney and Glen being chummy, led onlookers to believe the two were having an affair.\n\nWhile both were reportedly coupled-up during filming—Sweeney being engaged to her long-term partner, Jonathan Davino, and Glen thought to be in a relationship with model Gigi Paris—the actors’ obvious rapport had fans raising an eyebrow. In fact, we covered the tea pretty extensively.\n\nMeanwhile, the cast certainly didn’t seem to have drama with each other. The team soaked up every possible tourist opportunity as a group, taking bus tours, going to the zoo, even stopping by the Sydney Swans locker room.\n\n‘Anyone But You’ Filming Locations\n\nOne of the key reasons we’ve all been obsessed with this movie, is that it was filmed right on our doorstep, in Sydney, Australia.\n\nHere are some of the places we know it filmed:\n\nSydney Opera House\n\nDuring filming, photos emerged of Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell on the Opera House steps, where they shared a passionate kiss. As it turns out, the Sydney Opera House plays a pretty major role in the film, serving as a key backdrop for a few scenes – including one filmed in the water in Sydney harbour.\n\nPalm Beach, Sydney\n\nThe interior scenes in the iconic house in Anyone But You was reportedly filmed inland at a home in Terrey Hills just north of Sydney. However, the beach scenes surrounding the ‘beach house’ were mostly filmed around the famous Palm Beach.\n\nAccording to director Will Gluck, he and the leading actors were able to enjoy private areas of Palm Beach all to themselves.\n\n“One of the best parts for me was shooting for 10 days in Palm Beach, a suburb in the Northern Beaches,” Gluck told the Hollywood Reporter. “Our caravans were parked right on the water, and Glen and Sydney and I decided to live there the whole time. We’d shoot all day and all the crew would go home, then we’d jump in the water and have a swim, go to our trailers and have dinner sitting outside. It’s one of the most beautiful places in the world, and you normally wouldn’t be allowed to sleep there.”\n\nPittwater, Sydney\n\nOn one side of the famous Palm Beach peninsula is Pittwater, where the actors were also seen filming on a yacht. The boat served as the setting for the scene where Bea and Ben first concoct their hare-brained scheme.\n\nQueen Victoria Building, Sydney\n\nIn a scene where Ben and his friend Pete go out to collect flowers for the wedding, they are seen walking along George St just outside Sydney’s iconic Queen Victoria Building (QVB).\n\nMarks Park in Tamarama, Sydney\n\nThe wedding scene was filmed on location at Marks Park, in Sydney’s eastern suburbs. (We all known Sydney-siders will have a thing or two to say about a certain cliff jump scene!)\n\nAccording to IMDb, other Sydney filming locations include Double Bay, Surry Hills and Barangaroo.\n\nWhere To Stream ‘Anyone But You’ In Australia\n\nAnyone But You is finally available to stream on Binge, so you can watch from the comfort of your home."
