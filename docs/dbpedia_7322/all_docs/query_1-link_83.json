        "text": "The International Game Developers Association has said it'll investigate claims over LA Noire developer Team Bondi's crunch work policy.\n\n\"Certainly reports of 12-hour a day, lengthy crunch time, if true, are absolutely unacceptable and harmful to the individuals involved, the final product, and the industry as a whole,\" chairman of the board of the directors at the IGDA, Brian Robbins, told Develop.\n\nRobbins wouldn't comment further other than to ask those who were at Bondi to email the IGDA with either positive or negative responses.\n\nIt comes after an IGN expose that was published at the weekend said that the crunch period at the Sydney developer during the making of LA Noire was \"ominous,\" with one ex-staffer adding that studio head Brendan McNamara was \"the angriest person\" he'd ever met.\n\nMcNamara has, for his part, said he was being \"passionate.\"\n\nIf you still haven't read that article, you probably should. It's an excellent read."
