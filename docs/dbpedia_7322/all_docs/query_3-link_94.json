        "text": "The Bondi Junction Veterinary Hospital was built in 1934 as the practice and residence of Major Norman Larkin a 1926 graduate of the University of Sydney.\n\nNorman Larkin, graduating into the roaring twenties had a passion for horses that led him to a position of eminence. He was a President of the Thoroughbred Breeders Association, very involved in the AJC, ran the jockey school at Randwick for over 30 years and also bred thoroughbreds. He was an external examiner at the University of Sydney.\n\nThe photos we have of him show a dynamic man with thick black hair and a centre part, always immaculately dressed. He must have been equally at ease with all members of the equine world, owners, breeders, trainers and jockeys. The descriptions of him teaching jockeys “manners and behaviour” seem comical today but the school was set up because the jockeys had no schooling from the age of fourteen when they started their apprenticeship.\n\nIn the mid 1960s Robert Steel, who like many vets of the time had been indentured to the Department of Agriculture as a new graduate having traveled and worked in England, heard that Major Larkin was planning to retire. He purchased the practice in 1968 where it became a primarily small animal veterinary hospital. Robert Steel was also a Sydney graduate.\n\nThe practice thrived under Dr Steels’ compassionate care and became a model small animal practice.\n\nThe association with the University of Sydney continued. For the last 40 years veterinary students have lived in the flat upstairs answered the phones and helped with emergency calls and weekend nursing."
