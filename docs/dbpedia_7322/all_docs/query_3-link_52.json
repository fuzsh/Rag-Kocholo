Symons’ primary focus was investigating the subducting plate at the Peru-Chile Trench, the Tonga-Kermadec Trench, and the Aleutian Trench. Her exploration of trenches supported her effort to unravel the complex tectonic history of the Pacific Basin. Following completion of post-doctoral research, Symons worked on a National Science Digital Library collection, a collaborative effort among Scripps scientists, librarians, educators, and data managers to create a digital library environment for earth science education. As a science spokeswoman, she is eager to share her enthusiasm for exploration of our planet in hopes of inspiring future scientists, educators, and leaders.\n\nDr. Erika Montague, Ocean Technologist\n\nDr. Erika Montague is an ocean technologist with a fascination for the wonders of the deep sea. Entranced by bioluminescence and exploration, she earned a Ph.D. in oceanography from Johns Hopkins University. Joining expeditions to remote locations and diving aboard deep-diving submersibles, Montague realized that to better understand the deep-sea ecosystem would require access to instruments that did not yet exist, so she set about developing skills in marine engineering. While at Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution and Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, she helped develop a low-light, deep-sea observatory and undersea lander vehicles and invented an autonomous tissue sampler for collection of DNA from deep-sea fishes. Montague now serves as the director of science and technology at OceanGate Inc. She is also a submersible pilot and consultant on several ocean exploration projects. During the DEEPSEA CHALLENGE expedition, Montague worked with the lander and submersible teams, helping to maintain and deploy scientific instruments and sampling devices. Montague was honored to be part of this expedition, which she believes will ignite the passion of exploration in generations to come.\n\nLander Team\n\nKevin Hardy\n\nKevin Hardy directed the design, construction, and operation of unmanned landers for the DEEPSEA CHALLENGE expedition. In grade school, Hardy was inspired by the imaginative and bold ocean engineering projects of the time, including the U.S. Navy’s SeaLab and bathyscaphe Trieste projects and the French Conshelf habitats and bathyscaphe Archimede. He landed a job at Scripps Institution in 1972, while working on a B.S. in engineering from San Diego State University. At Scripps, he designed and built sensors and samplers for marine scientists and deployed them around the world. He has participated in more than 150 research expeditions. He retired from Scripps in 2011 but remains active in the deep-sea community. Hardy’s unmanned landers have made the round-trip to the floor of the Kermadec, Tonga, Aleutian, Puerto Rico, New Britain, and Mariana Trenches.\n\nLarry Herbst\n\nAmerican Larry Herbst designed and operated the DEEPSEA CHALLENGER‘s deep-diving lander’s still-imaging system to capture photos of the submersible and life-forms on the ocean floor. He first met James Cameron in 1986 and has worked on a number of Cameron projects, including the 3-D IMAX film Aliens of the Deep, for which he created 3-D time-lapse sequences. Herbst holds a bachelor of electrical engineering from Brown University and an M.F.A. in film from USC. He is a filmmaker with a deep interest in cutting-edge technology and has worked for many years with the XPRIZE Foundation, whose competitions are the subject of his latest documentaries.\n\nRobby Seid\n\nRobby Seid is a self-taught engineer who helped to build and operated DEEPSEA CHALLENGE’s lander vehicles. Seid had just returned from his summer job—commercially fishing for salmon in Bristol Bay, Alaska—when he met engineer Kevin Hardy at a UCSD function. Hardy had recently commenced building the landers and recognized Seid’s potential to assist with the project. Three weeks later Seid was building deep-sea landers for James Cameron, and several months after that he found himself on the DEEPSEA CHALLENGE expedition. He has a B.A. in environmental studies from UCSC. When not at work Seid loves to travel.\n\nROV Quasar Team\n\nDonald Cameron, ROV Pilot, Launch and Recovery Team\n\nBorn in Edinburgh, Scotland, Cameron has worked on the Mermaid Sapphire since it was delivered to Thailand in 2009. His ROV background spans 25 years, and he has worked on many oil and gas projects, including liquid cargo salvage, subsea construction, remote intervention, survey, and inspection. Cameron’s official title is offshore construction manager (OCM), the senior offshore project representative for Mermaid Offshore Services. On the DEEPSEA CHALLENGE expedition, Cameron was responsible for ROV team operations, integration of ancillary equipment to the ROV, assisting in the launch and recovery of the DEEPSEA CHALLENGER, the science landers, the surface support craft, and operations on deck.\n\nGavin Cole, ROV Supervisor, Launch and Recovery Team\n\nGavin Cole is a remotely operated vehicle supervisor from Daviot in the northeast of Scotland. Cole completed an H.N.D. in electronic engineering at Aberdeen College in 2004 to pursue a career in the ROV industry. For the past ten years, he has worked in the offshore oil and gas sector, first as a subsea acoustics engineer before moving into his intended field. Aboard the Mermaid Sapphire, Cole was responsible for the maintenance and operations of the Quasar ROV system. His involvement in the DEEPSEA CHALLENGE project was ROV support to 2,000 meters (a mere 9 kilometers shallower than the big green sub) and as part of the submersible Launch and Recovery Team. Cole is currently involved in subsea construction/survey operations near Matak Island, Indonesia. As an avid traveler who has always been fascinated by the sea, he was more than thrilled to be part of such a historic expedition. Working with National Geographic and James Cameron, meeting Captain Don Walsh, being part of history, acquiring new friends, and having a few wee drams after a shift … Well, it wasn’t a bad few months.\n\nColin Flagg, ROV Technician\n\nColin Flagg served eight years in the British Merchant Navy before becoming a remote operated vehicle technician in the oil and gas industry. His ROV work took him to the Philippines in 2007, where he continued to work and live until being posted on the DEEPSEA CHALLENGE project and the ROV Quasar. ROV Quasar provides dive support down to depths of almost 6,560 feet (2,000 meters). The ROV team also played a leading role in the launch and recovery of DEEPSEA CHALLENGER submersible from the Mermaid Sapphire.\n\nM.V. Mermaid Sapphire Crew\n\nCaptain Stuart Buckle\n\nStuart Buckle has been at sea since he was 17 years old. He completed his officer cadetship with Shell working on oil and gas tankers. In 2000 he moved into the specialist dynamic positioning (DP) sector of the industry, working on pipe lay, well stimulation, subsea construction, and dive support vessels. In 2010 he obtained his masters unlimited certificate of competency. This allows him to captain any vessel, anywhere in the world. At the time of the DSC expedition, Buckle had been captain (or “master” as it’s also known) of the Mermaid Sapphire for just over a year. The captain is in charge of the ship and responsible for all the people on her at all times. With that power (and nice cabin) comes great responsibility. His priorities are always for the safety of his crew, the safety of his ship, and the protection of the environment. Buckle lives in Glasgow, Scotland, with his wife, Juliana. He has left the Mermaid Sapphire and is now captain of a diving support vessel working in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nStuart Bowman, Chief Officer\n\nBowman was the chief officer onboard the Mermaid Sapphire. He has worked at sea for 20 years on a variety of ships, from dive boats to construction and ROV support vessels. Bowman has worked all over the world, and says, “My role onboard the ship is to look after the stability of the vessel (I try and keep the ship upright and afloat), also navigate the ship whilst at sea, and am also in charge of all operations on the working deck.” Bowman was second in command of the vessel. “My role in this project is to ensure that the DEEPSEA CHALLENGER is safely launched and recovered, whilst maneuvering the vessel during this period. I currently live in a small town called Barnsley in the U.K., where my wife, Cass, and three children live.”\n\nStephen Blow, Crane Operator, Launch and Recovery Team\n\nBorn in Cardiff, Wales, in 1959 and married to the lovely Kim, Stephen Blow has four sons, six grandchildren, and a shih tzu. He is a passionate supporter of the Cardiff City Football Club and enjoys bird-watching and moderately long walks. He joined the Merchant Navy in 1978, serving as motorman, AB, and pumpman. He gained his crane operator’s certification and moved to the offshore industry seven years ago. He had the task of launching and recovering the submersible with the crane in partnership with the rest of the team operating various winches and tag lines. He found the job initially daunting due to the high profile of the project, but after many practice drills and much discussion, and with several successful dives under their belts, he now has great faith and confidence in the whole operation and the personnel involved.\n\nBrian Conner, First Officer\n\nBrian Conner graduated from South Tyneside College in June 2000. After serving on oil tankers, he moved into the offshore industry in 2004. The majority of his seatime has been spent in the North Sea on offshore supply and construction vessels. Originally from Newcastle, he now lives in Spain with his wife, Laurina, and daughters Anna and Amy. On the Mermaid Sapphire Conner was responsible for the dynamic positioning of the vessel, and as safety officer, he was responsible for the maintenance of safety equipment and the implementation of safe working practices onboard.\n\nShore Support Team (Guam)\n\nMelanie Chryssochoides, Project Executive\n\nProject executive Melanie Chryssochoides was born in Bondi Beach, Sydney, and comes to the project with a varied background. Prior to her media career, Chryssochoides lived in southern California working with “youth at risk” through the Y and DARE programs—a hard but very rewarding role. With ten years in feature film production and a lifetime with two engineers in the family, Chryssochoides was well equipped to support her complex and demanding role in DEEPSEA CHALLENGE. A producer herself, Chryssochoides has her own film and television production company in Melbourne, which focuses on TV commercials and feature film development.\n\nMichael Horvath, Logistics Specialist\n\nAs an aspiring film producer, Michael Horvath joined the film industry in 2006, after completing a diploma in film production at Sydney Film School. Since then, Horvath has worked in various production roles on over 21 feature and television projects around Australia, including such films as Paradise Lost, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Australia, Happy Feet 2, Tomorrow, When the War Began, and many more. Having joined DEEPSEA CHALLENGE at the end of 2011, Horvath provided the expedition with logistical support in personnel movement, coordinating travel, freight, and parts purchasing.\n\nSub Build Team (Sydney, Australia)\n\nDianna Bisset, Straps and Bridles\n\nDianna Bisset has been designing and making equipment using technical fabrics and webbing for the outdoor industry since the early 1980s. She now works for Wild Stuff/Tufftec in Australia as a specialist designer of harnesses for flying performers in theater and films, as well as for rescue, sport, and industrial applications. Spectacular events such as the opening ceremony of the 2000 Sydney Olympics depended on Bisset’s harnesses for the myriad flying effects. For the DEEPSEA CHALLENGER Bisset designed and made the harness and tensioning straps for lifting, locating, and holding the sphere into the beam; the internal lifting slings; and lift, launch, and towing bridles. Since the end of the expedition, she and her husband Warwick have opened Rocklily Wombats, a wildlife refuge that rehabilitates and releases animals, including wombats, wallabies, and kangaroos. “Having the sub dive on a harness and strapping system I helped create was truly amazing and the highlight of my career,” says Bisset.\n\nWarwick Bisset, Engineer and Floor Manager\n\nWith a degree in manufacturing engineering, Australian Warwick Bisset’s early experience was in machining and tooling design, which led to the technical side of factory management. After 22 years with Clark Equipment, building 40-ton forklifts, the change to submersible manufacture was profound. His partner, Dianna Bisset, who had made the original sphere-lifting slings early in 2009, introduced him to the DSC project. Bisset’s role has been to manage the factory equipment and support the design effort in materials selection, stress analysis, manufacturing methods, and finding suppliers. He also helped to manufacture the syntactic foam that made up most of the sub. The inspection, installation, and maintenance of the very high-pressure test vessels were a major responsibility, as was the specification and sourcing of all lifting equipment. “Being on the sub project was inspiring and a valuable life experience,” says Bisset. “It was fabulous to work with so many talented and enthusiastic people. It demonstrated what is possible with passion, commitment, and financial support.”\n\nDavid Bleads, Mechanical Engineer\n\nDavid Bleads is a mechanical engineer who began his working career as a toolmaker. He worked at UTS and Macquarie University assisting scientists with the mechanical development of several projects, including the early laser devices. Later he started a business in prototype engineering, where he worked on a range of projects, often for R&D and start-up companies, designing and making a diverse range of devices, from medical probes to sonar buoys. On the Acheron project, he was involved in the thruster collaboration with the electronics engineers; the high-pressure-resistant strobes; the sphere-hatch viewport mount for the Red Epic camera; the mounting systems and parts for the cameras inside and outside the sphere; the soft buoyancy system; the fiber-optic penetrator for the data cable from the sphere to the externals; and sample gathering equipment.\n\nStephen Davison, Electronics Engineer\n\nStephen Davison joined the DEEPSEA CHALLENGE build project for three months at a busy time for the electronics design team. He drafted PCBs for the thruster, power distribution system, and camera system. Irish born, Davison has had an eclectic career, studying at Cambridge University, researching optical fibers and mobile phone systems, designing optical/electronic communications products, learning Arabic and teaching engineering in Jordan, and doing a stint as a trainee patent attorney. Davison loves being an engineer at all stages, from research and modeling to fabrication and testing. He has now returned to communications electronics.\n\nPhil Durbin, Sub Design Engineer\n\nManaging director of Finite Elements Australia, Phil Durbin was the principal mechanical and structural engineering advisor to James Cameron, Ron Allum, and the Acheron team for six years. Durbin’s three decades of design development experience is evident in nearly every aspect of the DEEPSEA CHALLENGER’s design and construction. He says, “This project has been as much an expedition to the frontiers of engineering as the journey to the trench itself.” One of Durbin’s major achievements was co-inventing, with Allum, the primary material of construction, the ISOFLOAT™ syntactic foam. Another early project milestone saw Durbin and his team design and test to full depth the sphere, acrylic view port, and hatches.\n\nRobert Fuhrmann, Electromechanical Systems Engineer\n\nRobert Fuhrmann is an experienced electromechanical systems engineer from the Pacific Northwest. Edge Innovations brought him onboard to assist the lower-pod team on the electrical system, science instrument, and mechanical integration. He has supported science at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, South Pole Station, and Institute of Ocean Sciences. Besides having a passion for building and fixing things, especially in the name of science, he enjoys wandering and climbing in the mountains.\n\nAnson Li, Design Engineering\n\nAnson Li is an aeromechanical engineer and the third person to be employed by the Acheron Project. He was a part of the submersible build project from beginning to end. His role included handling the design of the internal structures and exterior shape of the DEEPSEA CHALLENGER vehicle, which included the syntactic beam, battery modules, thruster modules, LED light modules, pilot sphere attachment, and all the exterior composite panels. Li was also a key member of the weight and balance team, working out the DEEPSEA CHALLENGER’s total volume, mass, buoyancy center, and dynamic center. Li is currently working for Design & Industry, the company that completed the sphere internals for the DEEPSEA CHALLENGER. “I increased my knowledge and skills while working on the DSC,” says Li. “I found it quite useful and unique.”\n\nNeil McLennan, Contracts Manager\n\nIn June 2011 Neil McLennan joined the Acheron Project to provide the management framework while it was still in its conceptual stages, assisting Ron Allum with managing the company. Over the next two and a half years McLennan’s role was to find the staff, set up the information systems, develop the budget, lease and purchase materials for the sub, create patents and trademarks, and generate the legal framework for the organization. Additionally, McLennan managed the project while Allum solved the technical challenges. McLennan originally trained with Price Waterhouse in 1980 after leaving school, and he has a B.Com from UNSW. Previously McLennan was CFO/company secretary for Immune System Therapeutics Ltd. What distinguished this project was the complete digitization of the workflow from the design process using CAD to the Google Apps communication, SQL inventory management, and banking. This led to a centralization of information and facilitated sharing of information in the organization.\n\nLynn Micheletti, Operations Manager and Quality Control\n\nHaving learned to dive at age 11, Lynn Micheletti became a diving instructor while studying at university. She graduated from UNSW with a bachelor’s degree in 1994. Diving led her to a career in the marine industry. During the past 18 years, she has skippered, crewed, and worked as a commercial diver on projects and films around Australia and overseas. Micheletti holds a master class 5, MED2, and commercial diving certification. She joined the Quest dive team in 1999 under the expedition leadership of Andrew Wight. She also held the position of divemaster on Paul Allen’s superyacht Octopus.
