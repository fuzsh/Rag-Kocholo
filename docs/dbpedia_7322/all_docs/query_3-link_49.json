        "text": "THE AFTRS STUDENT EXPERIENCE\n\nWith a year-round program jam-packed with co-curricular activities, our students are hard-pressed to leave the campus, but if they do, Sydney, the UNESCO City of Film, will leave them spoiled for choice.\n\nPlace\n\nLocated within the Entertainment Quarter, amidst the lively screen and broadcast production studios, and close to Sydney’s central business district and the Eastern suburbs, the AFTRS campus is well-served by public transport. Reaching the campus is easy – there are plenty of parking options for drivers in and around the Entertainment Quarter precinct, however, if you prefer more environmentally friendly means of travel, the area is friendly to cyclists.\n\nSpace\n\nOur foyer and student area, and dedicated Masters space, were loving designed by Ingrid Weir. The former has been transformed into a magnet for former students, current students and the wider film industry, while the MA space is a hub of creative activity. Among the other facilities at your disposal is the School’s world-class Jerzy Toeplitz Library, which boasts a vast catalogue of Australian films, student works, a combination of obscure and classic international cinema and thousands of books, screenplays and computer games.\n\nLife at AFTRS\n\nThe School’s annual calendar of events includes screenings of student and alumni work, film premieres, industry networking evenings, talks and masterclasses with local and international guests, film festivals, student mixers, panels, symposiums and dozens of student-run social gatherings. Follow the AFTRS Facebook page to stay in the loop with the School’s activities, as well as other relevant industry happenings.\n\nAccommodation\n\nWhile AFTRS doesn’t provide dedicated student accommodation on campus, or residential colleges, our Student Centre is able to provide information and advice on off-campus options in vibrant surrounding suburbs. You can reach them by email at studentinfo@aftrs.edu.au or phone on 1300 223 877.\n\nFind out more here.\n\nLife in Sydney\n\nThe iconic Bondi Beach is just 2kms to the east of AFTRS and the Sydney CBD a mere 2kms in the other direction where you’ll find Chinatown, Darling Harbour, the Rocks and Circular Quay. The inner city suburbs of Darlinghurst, Redfern, Paddington and Surry Hills are in close proximity to the AFTRS campus and the inner west suburbs of Newtown and Marrickville just beyond. The sprawling Centennial Parklands surround the Entertainment Quarter and the EQ itself is home to food markets and cinemas. A world-class city, Sydney is home to a multitude of festivals and events throughout the year."
