        "text": "The Made in NSW fund is an AU$175 million fund over five years (2020-2025). The level of financial assistance offered is determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThis incentive can be combined with the Australian Governmentâ€™s Location Offset, PDV Offset and the Producer Offset.\n\nThe NSW Post, Digital and Visual effects (PDV) rebate offers eligible productions a 10 per cent rebate on qualifying NSW PDV expenditure related to PDV work carried out in NSW.\n\nThe rebate can be combined with Australian Government incentives.\n\nAn applicant must spend at least $AU500,000 on PDV in New South Wales.\n\nEligible formats are:\n\nFeature films (drama, documentary, animation)\n\nTV drama, animation, comedy and documentary (telemovies, mini-series and series).\n\nApplicants must register the project with Screen NSW prior to the commencement of PDV work for which the rebate is sought.\n\nThis program offers eligible productions assistance for location surveys and may include covering some of the costs associated with on-ground travel, including accommodation, domestic flights, vehicle hire and location manager services.\n\nIn addition to working with Ausfilm to facilitate international inbounds, direct enquiries to Screen NSW are also welcome."
