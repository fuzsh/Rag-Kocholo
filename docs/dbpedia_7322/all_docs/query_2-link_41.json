        "text": "An enhanced version of L.A. Noire will make its way to Windows on November 8, Rockstar Games said Wednesday.\n\nOriginally released in May earlier this year for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, L.A. Noire put players in the role of a police detective in 1940s Los Angeles. The game emulated the dark stylistic flair of classic film noir, mixing investigative crime segments in which players collected evidence and interrogated suspects with explosive action sequences like car chases and street shootouts.\n\nThe PC version of the game – in development at Rockstar Leeds since original developer Team Bondi has disbanded – will include all of the previously-released console downloadable content and will also feature improved graphics.\n\nRockstar Games says the game \"will run on a wide range of PCs,\" but the recommended system requirements suggest that you use, among other high-end components, Nvidia's current fastest and most expensive graphics card.\n\nI hope that doesn't mean L.A. Noire's PC version will turn out like Grand Theft Auto IV's, which ran like molasses on even some top-of-the-line systems.\n\nSee Also:- Why L.A.
