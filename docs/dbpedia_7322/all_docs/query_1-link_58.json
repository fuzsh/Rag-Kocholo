        "text": "L.A. Noire was supposed to change everything. Team Bondi’s ambitious video game, published by Rockstar Games—best known for the industry-defining Grand Theft Auto series—took seven years for its developers to complete. The total cost of producing the game was abnormaly high; somewhere between $50 and $100 million, depending on who you believe. A BBC report hypothesized that the game’s innovative motion capture might “change the game for actors.” And in the weeks leading up to L.A. Noire’s release, it played to a sold-out crowd at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2011—the first video game to be showcased at the festival, in a nod to the game’s efforts to erase barriers between video games and film.\n\nAt the Tribeca premiere, L.A. Noire writer and director Brendan McNamara gave a grandiose interview to Wired. \"Ultimately, we’ll have to judge by whether the audiences buys into this—whether it’s a good game that they want to go out and buy, and a watershed-moment type of game,\" he said. \"It might be hugely egotistical, but we’re hoping for both of those things.\"\n\nRead More\n\nStar Wars Battlefront II Is a Great Game That Keeps Dropping The Ball\n\nHow a needless controversy is souring one hell of a Star Wars game.\n\nL.A. Noire certainly wasn’t a flop—it garnered largely enthusiastic reviews, and sold nearly five million copies—but it wasn’t exactly a watershed moment in gaming, either. It didn’t spark a new trend in detective games or period games. It didn’t attract a new audience to gaming. And its much-hyped new \"MotionScan\" technology—which used a system of 32 cameras to capture an actor’s performance in exacting detail—hasn’t been applied to another game since.\n\nSo L.A. Noire is a particularly interesting game to revisit in 2017, six years after it failed to revolutionize the gaming industry. Last week, Rockstar Games re-released L.A. Noire on the Playstation 4 and Xbox One with upgraded visuals, as well as a version for Nintendo Switch, making the game portable for the first time. The news that Rockstar was bothering with an L.A. Noire remaster at all caught me off-guard; in the years since its release, the game's cultural footprint has essentially vanished, with more venerated Rockstar games—say, Red Dead Redemption or Bully—seeming like a more obvious choice for a fresh coat of paint.\n\nL.A. Noire casts the player as Cole Phelps, a World War II veteran and rising star in the L.A.P.D. As Phelps delves deeper and deeper into the criminal underbelly of Los Angeles, the player is tasked with solving an increasingly gruesome series of crimes—many of which were based on actual cases from the era.\n\nPhelps is played by Aaron Staton, who you probably know best as Mad Men’s Ken Cosgrove—a performance that played a large role in landing him the part. \"I can’t remember the exact one-sentence pitch, but I think it was something like ‘L.A. Confidential meets Grand Theft Auto,’\" Staton told me in a phone interview last week. \"They were casting actors who had an understanding of the period. Mad Men took place in the '60s and not the '40s—but 20 years is a lot shorter to travel than 70.\"\n\nStaton’s performance was achieved via then-cutting edge motion capture: long days of sitting in a room alone and reciting dialogue into those 32 cameras, which faithfully translated his performance into the actual game. \"It was so much material,\" says Staton. \"There were 5,000 script pages. I never read the whole script beforehand, because with 5,000 pages, how could I? Eight pages is a big day in television—and here, we were doing 25 or 30 pages a day. We were flying through it—just two or three takes for every line.\"\n\nThis exacting motion-capture technique also led to L.A. Noire’s buzziest feature: the interrogation scenes, in which Cole Phelps grills suspects and witnesses. In theory, the digitized performances were supposed to be detailed enough that players could gauge whether or not a character was lying just by studying their face. In practice, the process is inexact at best. It’s difficult to judge the characters’ expressions, and difficult to know which of Cole’s three very divergent reactions you should apply to these very nuanced moments. (In the original release, your options were \"Truth, Doubt, or Lie\"; in the remaster, they’ve been changed to \"Good Cop, Bad Cop, or Accuse,\" which is only marginally less confusing.)\n\nL.A. Noire’s interrogations were even difficult enough to thwart the game’s star. \"I should play [the remastered version],\" Staton says. \"I played some of [the original] when it came out. I was actually really terrible at the game. I sat down with my wife and played it, and she said, 'I can’t believe you’re not better at this. Don’t you know which one to choose? Didn’t you spend months doing this?' And she’s not wrong. I should be better at it.\"\n\nStaton has remained invested in gaming since starring in L.A. Noire in 2011. He plays TT Games’ Lego video games with his kids, and he’s just about to dive into Call of Duty: WWII. \"It’s 87 percent loaded here on my Xbox,\" he says. (Staton is a longtime Call of Duty fan, and he plays online—so yes, there’s a non-zero chance you’ve ended up on the wrong end of Ken Cosgrove’s crosshairs.) And while he wasn’t asked to shoot or record any new scenes for the rerelease of L.A. Noire, he’d be interested in performing in a video game again. \"I think that the technology we used… it must be so completely different,\" Staton says. \"It would have been different just a year from then. I would be curious how it would work now.\"\n\nIt’s an interesting thought experiment, because while this remastered version is mechanically identical to the 2011 release, an L.A. Noire created in 2017 would be very, very different. So many of the game’s more experimental choices play strangely by modern standards. It’s bizarre that they created a painstakingly accurate version of Los Angeles in the 1940s but made it so barren that there’s practically no reason to explore it in any kind of detail. It’s bizarre that they went to the trouble of modeling 95 period-appropriate cars, but made it so Cole can only accept dispatcher calls while driving one of the dull police sedans. It’s bizarre that they licensed a terrific set of songs from the era—Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Peggy Lee, and more—but made it a tremendous pain in the ass to drive around without putting your police siren on, rendering all that good music totally moot.\n\nAnd then there are the side missions. The central arc is a twisty mystery in the heightened mode of a classic noir. The pace is deliberate; you’re driving around gathering evidence, questioning witnesses, and building your case. But the side missions, which pop up more or less randomly, are cut from the Grand Theft Auto vein. Cole rushes into a bank, shoots five robbers in the head, and goes right back to driving around collecting shell casings and badgering witnesses. It’s a game-breaking loss of verisimilitude, and it reeks of bet-hedging, as the team behind L.A. Noire clearly fretted about releasing an open-world game that emphasized cerebral detective work instead of shooting a bunch of random dudes.\n\nSo yes, L.A. Noire remains a game that is fundamentally at odds with itself—but I kind of love it anyway. In an era plagued by busywork-infused \"map games,\" L.A. Noire is an outlier—strange and misshapen and fundamentally unlike any other triple-A title released before or since. It’s an unusually punishing game. If you botch an interrogation, you don’t get a second chance; the suspect freezes up, and you’re forced to tail them to make any more progress in the case. And when the case ends, you get a detailed report that runs down every embarrassing error you made along the way.\n\nIt’s rare to play a game where consequences actually matter. On one early case, I chased down a man with schizophrenia who had attacked another man in broad daylight. I followed the man up to a rooftop, where he jumped to his death, and the mini-narrative ended with Cole Phelps watching as a coroner drove the man’s body away. Case closed, I guess.\n\nAnd then I looked up the case online, and discovered that it was actually possible to catch and detain the schizophrenic man before he leapt from the roof. I had failed, but L.A. Noire didn’t give me a game over screen, or penalize me, or even hint that there was another possible outcome. I just had to live with being the L.A. detective who failed to save a sick man’s life—and if Cole Phelps didn’t grapple with that in the game, it was certainly rattling around in my own head. It should be hard to be a detective—confusing and frustrating and often unpleasant, and the game's smartest flourishes and dumbest flaws somehow combine to create that effect. In that way, for all its faults, L.A. Noire might just be the best detective game ever made."
