Background

Team Bondi was an Australian game studio based in Sydney, Australia founded by Brendan McNamara. The studio is known for their sole game L.A. Noire, which was developed and published in partnership with Rockstar Games. While L.A. Noire was both a critical and commercial success, due to the studio's troubles in finding a publisher and investor for their planned second game Whore Of The Orient after WB Games had dropped the project, in addition to reports of the mistreatment of employees during the long-winded development of L.A. Noire, Team Bondi would shut down.

Logo (May 17, 2011)

Visuals: On a backdrop of a dark, cloudy sky (appears to be during either sunrise or sunset), there is a large, 1940s-styled neon sign perched on top of a building. The sign flickers on from top to bottom, revealing a circular design resembling a white ocean wave in a blue circle. Below that is "TEAM BONDI" in a more modern font, "SYDNEY â€¢ AUSTRALIA" at the very bottom, separated with a circle in the middle. The sign flickers back off as the screen fades out. Throughout the logo there are also several film scratches and other effects to resemble aged/deteriorated film.

Variant: A website variant exists, where the animation is slower, the clouds are not moving and there's no film deterioration effect.

Technique: CGI.

Audio: A four-note, depressing jazz tune that ends in a piano flourish (which is carried over from the game's Rockstar logo), coupled with the buzzing of a neon sign. None for the website variant.
