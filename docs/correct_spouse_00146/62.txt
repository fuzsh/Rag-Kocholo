Matthew Settle and his wife Naama Nativ have split up, according to reports.

The Gossip Girl star, who plays Rufus Humphrey in the show, is not yet believed to have filed for divorce.

A friend of the star told People magazine: "They have in fact separated. They have been separated for a while now."

The couple, who used to live in New York City together, had daughter Aven Angelica last year.

The source added: "The baby is doing great. And Settle continues to play an active role in his little girl's upbringing. Both parents are devoted to their child. Aven is still a part of Matthew's everyday life."
