Gossip Girl star Matthew Settle has reportedly confirmed rumours that he has split from his wife.

The actor, who plays Rufus Humphrey in the CW drama, was recently reported to have separated from partner of four years Naama Nativ.

Speaking to OK about adjusting to single life, he said: "I'm not. I'm not adjusted yet."

He added: "I'm still working on that, but it's always a tragedy when things happen, and that's all I can say."

Settle, 40, and Nativ, 26, are parents to daughter Aven Angelica, who was born last March.
