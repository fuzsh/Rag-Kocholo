Gossip Girl star Matthew Settle has confirmed he's split from his wife - calling the break-up a "tragedy".

The actor, 40, wed model Naama Nativ in 2006 and the couple welcomed its first child together, daughter Aven, last March (09).

Settle sparked speculation he is no longer with Nativ after he was spotted without his wedding ring during New York Fashion Week last week (ends14Feb10).

The star has now spoken out to confirm he is single, admitting he is finding it difficult adjusting to unmarried life.

He tells OK! magazine, "I'm not adjusted yet. I'm still working on that, but it's always a tragedy when things happen, and that's all I can say."
