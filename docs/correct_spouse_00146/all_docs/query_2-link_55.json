While portraying on-again, off-again couple Serena and Dan, Lively and Badgley dated IRL from 2007 to 2010.\n\n“I remember there was one point where we were just afraid of how our personal lives overlapping our work life could be perceived by our bosses,” Lively told Vanity Fair in 2017. “[But then] we were like, ‘Oh, no, that’s exactly what they want.’ They wanted us all to date. They wanted us all to wear the same clothes that we’re wearing on the show. They wanted that, because then it fed their whole narrative. People could buy into this world.”\n\nExecutive Joshua Safran went on to tell Vanity Fair that Lively and Badgley “kept their breakup hidden from the crew,” as they “did not want their personal drama to relate to the show.”\n\nLively and Badgley weren’t the only ones to mix business with pleasure on Gossip Girl. Ed Westwick (Chuck Bass) dated Jessica Szohr (Vanessa Abrams) on and off through the series’ run before splitting for good in 2010.\n\nScroll through for a breakdown of the Gossip Girl cast’s love lives:"
