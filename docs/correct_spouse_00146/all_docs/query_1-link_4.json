        "text": "It’s a deal for Matthew Settle — he’s single again. The “Gossip Girl” star reached an agreement yesterday to bring an amicable end to his marriage to model Naama Nativ (pictured, with Settle, outside a lower Manhattan courthouse yesterday). The two sides worked out the deal just as their divorce trial was set to begin in Manhattan Supreme Court. “We are settling the Settle case,” said Nativ’s lawyer, William Beslow. The couple had previously worked out a custody agreement for their 2-year-old daughter, Aven Angelica Settle, and managed to work out their financial differences before any witnesses were called. “The divorce was granted,” Settle lawyer David Lansner confirmed afterward. Settle, who plays Penn Badgley‘s hunky dad on the hit CW show, was in good spirits as he and Nativ took a break from settlement talks to pick up some drinks at a deli. “We’re excited to be good co-parents with our daughter,” Settle told us. The couple eloped back in 2006, but hit rough waters in 2009 when Nativ first filed for divorce. They officially separated in February last year, setting off a spate of sightings of the handsome “Band of Brothers” star — who is now believed to have a new steady girlfriend — with different women."
