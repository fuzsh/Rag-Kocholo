        "text": "Secrets eat those who consume it themselves.\n\n'The Lost Boy' was all about secrets being revealed despite the consequences.\n\nSometimes only when you get closer to the boiling pot you realize how hot it is and that's exactly what Scott found out when he got too close to the fire with a failed attempt in revealing his true identity to his biological father. It was actually a huge let down watching Scott get cold feet after all the lies he spun to reach there. It was even worse when he dropped that huge bomb on Vanessa, asking her to keep his secret safe. We all know what happens then, seeing as Georgina...\n\ncontinue reading...\n\n\"So did you like this Valley Girls prequel?\"\n\nI am sure interested in what Lily's life was, it somewhat mirrors Serena's life now. How was Brittany Snow as Lily Rhodes? Did you think she looked like Lily. The transitions between Lily Rhodes and Lily van der Woodsen were well done, as I found myself comparing both individuals and they were somewhat the same. I know they are the same person, but think about it, has Lily van der Woodsen ever really grown up? There is still a hint of Lily Rhodes in there, mixed with a bit of her mother's (Cece) cliche moments.\n\nLike:\n\nTelling Serena 'Mother Knows Best'...\n\ncontinue reading...\n\nSummary: Blair Waldorf is a young, beautiful, 18 year old, dark haired girl who was raised in California by her New Yorker parents. As a little girl she used to visit her grandparents in the Upper East Side, and she remembered having friends there. Now she graduated from high school and went to college, Yale, only to find there people who she no longer remembered existed. What will happen?\n\nChapter 1: Yale Material\n\nIt was a long night for Blair Waldorf; she unpacked, tried to put it all into her smallish new wardrobe and then decided she had to go shopping because the 37 designer dresses she had...\n\ncontinue reading...\n\nA Million Love Songs Later\n\nA/N: Hey guys. So here's chapter seven and the return of Serena. =D So I hope you're all happy about that. This chapter is mainly a Blair and Serena chapter but I'm gonna throw Chuck and Nate in there too so hopefully you'll all be happy with that. I'm so proud of myself for this I wrote it all in only two hours. I decided to take some time off from my revising for a few hours after all it was only science and who needs that right! =D Not really I would like to pass it but it's not one of my main priorities! =D Anyway I hope you all like this chapter. Thank you for...\n\ncontinue reading...\n\nChair Tales S02E03 - Dawn of the Dad\n\nIts been a week since Chuck and Blair's recent fall out and things have been a bit cold between them. Blair is going on a weekend trip with the D.A.Y to New York as this is where the original West Side Story was set. Meanwhile and coincidently, Bart is visiting Chuck in New Haven whilst Blair will be away.\n\nBlair has told Chuck about the trip but he seemed uninterested, his response was minimal and in her opinion he wasn't very bothered.\n\nBlair is just glad that she can have a weekend break and can go back to New York, maybe even visit her mother, which she hasn't...\n\ncontinue reading...\n\nThis is Season 2 of Chair Tales.\n\nCatch up: Blair, Serena and Dan are at Yale University and it is set in their final year at Yale. Nate is not around as he is travelling the world. Blair's mother is still living in their house in Manhattan. Lily still lives in Manhattan. Eric and Jenny both attend other Universities. Rufus has moved out of Brooklyn to Jersey City.\n\nDue to the fact that they have all moved away from the Upper East Side, unfortunately there will be no Gossip Girl Blasts anymore, in fact Gossip Girl isn't around any more so this season is based on their futures after High school...\n\ncontinue reading...\n\nA Million Love Songs Later\n\nA/N: Okay, This is my new fan fiction. I hope you all like it, I know it's a bit crap... Okay a lot crap, but I've had a crappy week. Ugh! God do I hate school!! And I've been ill, so don't let first impressions put you off, please! So to sum up Everything that's happened in the show has happened in this fan fiction, nothing is different. It begins eight years after everyone left for their collages. The main characters are Blair, Chuck, Nate, Serena and Dan. Vanessa and Jenny might pop up for time to time but they wont be that important. And a few new characters will...\n\ncontinue reading...\n\n-So i have read alot of fanfics about what if blair was really pregnant (season one, ep.13), and i loved all of them, but it's always chuck's baby... so here's a different look at it...blair doesn't really know who the father is! Hope you enjoy it!!!\n\n-I own nothing!\n\n* Blair is at home, she's getting really annoyed because she hates morning sickness...\n\nB: Oh God... not again (runs to her bathroom)! I thought babies made you eat more, not throw up!\n\n-she comes down for breakfast and is surprised her mother is back..\n\nB: (OH SHIT!)\n\nE: Is everything alright blair?\n\nB: Mom, your back!! Yes, everything is...\n\ncontinue reading...\n\nPEN-ULTIMATE EPISODE!!! Please Comment\n\nEpisode 22: Made in Manhattan\n\nGG: Yawn. That's what we hear is coming from the mouth of Chuck Bass, up all night...but not in a good way, stuck with N, wallowing in his latest break up from V, Oh well she wasn't the first and unless there's a holocaust of all females she certainly wont be the last.\n\n(At the Palace.)\n\nIn Chuck's suite.\n\nNate is walking around holding a whiskey, he has been drinking all night.\n\nChuck is sitting on the couch looking very bored and isn't really listening.\n\nN: You know It was just one mistake (drinks) And it's not like it matters anyway...\n\ncontinue reading...\n\nPART TWO- The Taming of the Shrewd\n\nGossip Girl: # Gossip Girl has photographic evidence of someone climbing down from Queen B's window last night...! Unfortunately our tip off came from an inexperienced photo taker! All we see is a black blur but im sure it is a male figure! Free blog space on Gossip Girl for anyone who finds out who it was! xoxo Gossip Girl #\n\nSerena and Blair are in school sitting at the steps.\n\nS: Let me guess...Chuck?\n\nB: S! Ssshhh....people can hear you!\n\nS: (whispers) Ok...so it was him?\n\nB: ...Maybe.\n\nS: Come on B...you can tell me.....what did he want?\n\nB: What do you think!\n\nS: Twice...\n\ncontinue reading...\n\nA/N: Yes, I know….shame on me. I should be writing another chapter of ‘so what if I’m jealous’…….*sighs* I apologize. It’s just…….*huffs*…….it will take soooo long and it MUST be perfect and I have another brilliant idea! Now, I know I don’t usually write up all my brilliant ideas, because let’s face it….then I’d have like 20 multi-chaptered CB fics and they’d NEVER get finished! Lol. XD\n\nBut! This is different.\n\nI swear.\n\nThis story is simply the retelling of my Gossip Girl dreams, from my perspective. And I had TWO of them last night, so 2 chapters to start! *giggles*...\n\ncontinue reading..."
