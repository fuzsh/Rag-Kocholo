        "text": "GOSSIP Girl was promoted as \"Every parent's nightmare\" when the original series premiered in September 2007.\n\nBlake Lively, Leighton Meester, and Penn Badgley went on to find even greater success after the show concluded.\n\nWhere are the original Gossip Girl cast members now?\n\nBlake Lively\n\nCharacter: Serena Van Der Woodsen\n\nBlake Lively graduated from Gossip Girl to star in several movies including:\n\nThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\n\nThe Rhythm Section\n\nThe Shallows\n\nAll I See is You\n\nThe Age of Adaline\n\nA Simple Favor\n\nOn September 9, 2012, Blake tied the knot with her Green Lantern co-star Ryan Reynolds.\n\nThe pair have three children together, daughters James, Inez, and Betty.\n\nOn September 15, 2022, Blake and Ryan announced that they are expecting a fourth child.\n\nAlthough Blake's character Serena was best friends with Leighton Meester's Blair, their chemistry on set did not translate to an off-camera friendship.\n\nRegarding Blake and Leighton, Gossip Girl executive producer Joshua Safran revealed to Vanity Fair: \"Blake and Leighton were not friends.\n\n\"They were friendly, but they were not friends like Serena and Blair.\n\n\"Yet the second they’d be on set together, it’s as if they were.\"\n\nLeighton Meester\n\nCharacter: Blair Waldorf\n\nSince Gossip Girl ended, Leighton Meester went on to appear on Broadway as Curley's wife in Of Mice and Men.\n\nOn February 15, 2014, Leighton walked down the aisle with Fleishman Is in Trouble actor Adam Brody.\n\nShe has two children with Adam, a daughter named Arlo and a son whose name has yet to be revealed.\n\nLeighton can be seen in episodes of the Hulu spinoff How I Met Your Father.\n\nPenn Badgley\n\nCharacter: Dan Humphrey\n\nAfter Gossip Girl, Penn Badgley switched gears after many years of playing Dan Humphrey on the show.\n\nFor fun, he joined friends Jimmy Giannopoulos, Simon Oscroft, and Darren Will to form the band MOTHXR.\n\nIn 2014, Badgley began dating singer Domino Kirke and the couple married on February 27, 2017.\n\nOn August 11, 2020, the pair welcomed their first child together, a son named James.\n\nThe Young and The Restless alum is also a stepfather to Domino's older son named Cassius from a former relationship.\n\nBadgley can be seen as the murderous character Joe Goldberg in the Netflix mystery thriller You.\n\nEd Westwick\n\nCharacter: Chuck Bass\n\nOriginally from the United Kingdom, Ed Westwick played bad boy Chuck Bass on the show.\n\nHe won the Teen Choice Award for TV villain in 2008 and 2009.\n\nHe was set to star in the BBC comedy White Gold but the production halted after he was investigated for sexual misconduct.\n\nLA prosecutors declined to charge him, citing insufficient evidence after four women came out and accused Westwick of sexual assault.\n\nHe starred in the 2021 film Me, You, Madness alongside Louise Linton.\n\nChace Crawford\n\nCharacter: Nate Archibald\n\nYears following GG's end, Chace Crawford landed a role in the Amazon Prime show The Boys.\n\nBased on the comic book series of the same name, Chance plays the aquatic superhero The Deep.\n\nIn June 2020, he reunited with GG co-star Penn Badgley and the two reflected on their days on set together.\n\nWhile interviewing each other for Variety, Chace told Penn: \"To go back and open that time capsule, I think there would be some nostalgic value.\"\n\nPenn also admitted the early episodes are hard to watch, which Chace seemed to agree with and responded: \"Buddy, you would have to strap me to a gurney and pop my eyes open like Clockwork Orange.\n\n\"It would be interesting to see the first couple, maybe.\"\n\nTaylor Momsen\n\nCharacter: Jenny Humphrey\n\nLike Badgley, Taylor Momsen took the music route after Gossip Girl ended.\n\nShe fronted the rock group The Pretty Reckless and went on to release three studio albums.\n\nHer new album Death By Rock And Roll was released on February 12, 2021.\n\nShe has not acted since the show ended in 2012.\n\nJessica Szohr\n\nCharacter: Vanessa Adams\n\nJessica Szohr's role as Vanessa Adams served a number of purposes in Gossip Girl.\n\nThe character was introduced as Dan's childhood best friend, and later became Blair's enemy, Jenny's confidant, and Nate's lover.\n\nWestwick and Szohr had a short-lived offscreen romance while the show was airing.\n\nThe actress went on to appear in Shameless, Ted 2, The Internship, and Two Night Stand.\n\nOn January 11, 2021, she and her longtime partner Brad Richardson welcomed their first child, a daughter named Bowie Ella.\n\nFollowing Bowie's birth, Jessica and Brad became engaged on May 16, 2022.\n\nJessica can be seen as Commander Talla Keyali in Seth MacFarlane's Hulu series The Orville.\n\nKelly Rutherford\n\nCharacter: Lily van der Woodsen\n\nRutherford played Lively's mother on the show.\n\nIt was reported that co-star Matthew Settle and Rutherford, who were married onscreen, were dating in real life, but the claims turned out to be false.\n\nShe also appeared as another important family matriarch on the Pretty Little Liars spinoff, Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists.\n\nMatthew Settle\n\nCharacter: Ruphus Humphrey\n\nSettle, who played Dan and Jenny's father, has starred in tv shows and movies since Gossip Girl ended.\n\nHe took on the role of Sam Harris in the horror movie The Faith of Anna Waters in 2016.\n\nThe last film Settle starred in was Valentine, where he played legendary U2 frontman Bono back in 2017.\n\nHe has two kids, one with his ex-wife Naama Nativ, and another with his longtime girlfriend, Maria Alfonsin.\n\nRobert John Burke\n\nCharacter: Bart Bass\n\nBurke, 60, played Chuck Bass' father on Gossip Girl.\n\nBurke has continued acting after the show came to a close and has had recurring roles on Law & Order, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Sex, and the City, and Six Degrees.\n\nIn 2021, the actor joined the cast of The Retaliators as Lieutenant Briggs.\n\nHow can I watch Gossip Girl?\n\nThe original Gossip Girl can be streamed via HBO Max, Hulu, and Amazon Prime.\n\nAll six seasons of the 2007 incarnation of the show are available through the above-mentioned streaming services.\n\nOn July 8, 2021, HBO Max began releasing episodes of the Gossip Girl reboot on its platform.\n\nOn January 19, 2023, it was announced the platform decided to cancel the reboot after two seasons."
