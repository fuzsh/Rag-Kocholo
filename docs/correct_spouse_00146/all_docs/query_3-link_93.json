        "text": "\"DIALOGUE AMONG CIVILIZATIONS\"\n\nThe Pres. of Iran proposed in 1999 a \"dialogue among civilizations.\" The UNO set up an office for it. When the Israeli Consul General arrived at one of its meetings, the Iranian speaker suddenly remembered a \"previous engagement\" and left the room. He would not recognize Jewish civilization, which long preceded his Shiite one. \"The farce should have ended there: Any regime that refuses to recognize the legitimacy of one of its adversaries while claiming to sponsor dialogues should be laughed at.\"\n\nThe UNO now holds meetings for an \"Alliance of Civilizations.\" Instead of being involved in Iranian propaganda initiatives, the UNO should be involved in potentially productive matters as demanding the release of the Iranian hunger-striker. When Pres. Bush challenged the Secretary-General to demand that release, the latter claimed not to be aware of the case. A week later, his officials had not acted.\n\nThe Iranian initiatives have \"nothing to do with the London bombers, their handlers, and the rest of those in the Islamic world who scoff at 'dialogues' and 'alliances' and believe Jews and Christians deserve nothing short of extinction. Battling that enemy is where funds and effort should go, rather than to meaningless Turtle Bay programs.\" (Benny Avni, NY Sun, 7/18, p.8.)\n\nDON'T BLAME MUSLIMS, ASSERTS SAUDI\n\nA UNESCO official and former dean of the King Fahd Academy in London expressed shock at the carnage in London. He remembers fondly the huge march against the Iraq war and violence in general, an opposition that IMRA calls irresponsible. He refers to the post-9/11 terrorism, bringing a reminder from IMRA about pre-9/11 terrorism, already extensive.\n\nThe official declares that only a few individuals are involved in terrorism, and terrorism is not a monopoly of one faith. Therefore he considers it unfair to be suspicious of Islam and worries about terrorism prompting hostility towards Muslims and unfair treatment of Palestinian Arabs. It is the reaction to terrorism that may cause a clash of civilization and certainly impede the integration of Muslims within Europe (IMRA, 7/17 from Arab News).\n\nOne may be outraged, but only the naïve or collaborators are shocked at the carnage in London. There have been many attacks all over the world. Thousands of terrorists are fighting. Surely, many others are engineering, planning, organizing, recruiting, and fundraising for them. S. Arabia, Iran, Pakistan, etc. are devoted to it, so as to keep youth streaming to battle, as fast as regular armies liquidate them. This is not a case of a few individuals, but of worldwide jihad, in accordance with basic principles of Islam, which is to clash with other civilizations. There are a few other non-Muslim terrorist groups, as in Ireland and Ceylon, but most are Muslim, especially on the international scene, and Islamists radicalize Muslim youth.\n\nPalestinian Arab setbacks: since their case is fraudulent, and since they wholeheartedly approve of depriving the Jews of their homeland, it is they who are unfair to others and deserve setbacks.\n\n\"Integration\" of Muslims in Europe is a good one! Besides being a criminal and bigoted element that attacks Christian women and Jews daily, many of the Arabs boast of a coming conquest of a cowed Europe. Helping them in that goal is their general self-segregation, their refusal to integrate in other ways, and their preachers promoting hatred. The Saudi is attempting to undermine European resistance. Be alert to Muslim pretenses at opposing jihad.\n\nInstead of becoming hostile as a result of suffering their hostile presence, Europe should expel them and then pursue its own destiny with some equanimity.\n\nHAMAS CHARITY FOR EDUCATION\n\nA charity in Britain sends the money to Hamas, but denies that this helps terrorism, because, it claims (perhaps falsely) that the money is used for education. What do you think education means to Hamas? Indoctrination. It indoctrinates in hatred and terrorism. Jihad thus is fought not only by violence but also by economic means.\n\nBritain has frozen the assets of more than 100 organizations and 200 individuals, but other groups continue to funnel money to jihadists. European states have failed to fulfill pledges to combat terrorism financially and to coordinate with each other and with the US (IMRA, 7/17).\n\nSECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT ABANDONMENT\n\nLeftist columnist, Danny Rubinstein of \"Haaretz,\" has second thoughts about Sharon's abandonment plan. He does not dispute it ideologically, but finds it counter-productive. Since the Arabs consider it the result of their terrorism, they are encouraged by it to step up that terrorism. Rubinstein believes this makes the plan unsatisfactory (IMRA, 7/18).\n\n\"Disengagement\" is a death trap for Israelis. If the issue were discussed honestly, openly, and fully, it would have been understood and unpopular from the start. There is nothing to commend it and everything to object in it.\n\nJORDAN TO HOST CONFERENCE ON THE TRUE ISLAM\n\nThe YWCA is running an international conference in Jordan on \"the true nature of Islam.\" The purpose is to eliminate prejudices. Why Jordan? The answer given is because of the ancient events that took place in what now is Jordan and because Jordan is known for religious coexistence (and, according to IMRA, because of YWCA myopia\"). The program seeks to counter some of the negative publicity that befell Islam over violent acts in the name of Islam. IMRA suggests instead countering some of the terrorism (IMRA, 7/18).\n\nThis sounds like a Muslim attempt to deceive the Christians and undermine Christians' awareness of jihad's threat to them and Christian self-defense. Jordan, far from being tolerant, has had antisemitic textbooks, until recently had the death penalty for selling land to Jews, and when it controlled Jerusalem, exerted pressure upon Christians, many of whom had to leave.\n\nIn this era of jihad, the main problem is prejudice by Muslims, not against Islam. There should be more public information about the menace of Islamism.\n\nFATWA AGAINST BOMBING\n\nBritain's largest Sunni Muslim group issued a fatwa condemning the bombing of London as from a \"perverted ideology.\" The group declared that no one has the right to kill others and that suicide bombing is contrary to Islam (NY Sun, 7/18, p.8).\n\nIs this the sincere start of the unheard from \"moderate\" Muslims or another exercise in damage control, like that conference in Jordan, where the Islamists form a large proportion of the population, and are no aberrant fringe. Another example is the earlier anti-terrorism march in London. Islamists, ever deceptive, participated in it, to defuse resentment against them.\n\nARAB FAKE CIVIC GROUPS\n\nP.A. environmental NGOs use \"ecological issues as a pretext for political and ideological attacks on Israel\" and promoting disinvestments fromit. Of 21 P.A. environmental NGOs, only two are involved in environmental issues, but those two also campaign against Israel for its security fence and settlements. Israeli groups have had to suspend cooperation with the Arab ones, because the Arab ones have switched entirely from environmental issues to a propaganda war against Israel.\n\n\"Such organizations continue to misappropriate their funds towards political campaigns, and repeatedly present unreliable and even false data, for example in accusing Israel of cutting down trees in order to build the security barrier. Yet international donors continue to support the NGOs' 'environmental' projects. (Donors repeat the defamation as if factual.)\n\nOne group \"claimed that the IDF had 'burned considerable areas of cropped lands and forbid Palestinian (Arab) farmers to reach their lands using dogs\" and then 'randomly dispensed flyers on the farmers' lands informing of the Army's intention to clear all trees (mostly olive) existing along the Israeli bypass roads\". In fact, a visit to the area demonstrates that no trees have been uprooted from the area around Tekoa, despite their use as a cover for terrorists to shoot at the road.\" (IMRA, 7/19.)\n\nWhy didn't Israel clear those trees used by terrorists for cover? It would be justified. Since Israel gets accused anyway of doing so wantonly, it may a well do it when warranted.\n\nP.A. human rights organizations as well as environmental organizations are covers for propaganda against Israel. The P.A. Arabs have a totalitarian society and are waging total war against the Jewish state, because it is a Jewish state. That is a fact that I have not seen bruited in the \"NY Times.\" Is ignorance why the foreign donors continue to allocate funds for the P.A. propaganda war? Or do the foreign donors, some of them governments, know and approve?\n\nISRAELI SURREALISM\n\nThe Jews of Israel are no more realistic than were the Jews of Poland. They believe what they are told by official sources, and don't realize the nature of their fascist rulers. They think officials follow the law, and are meek towards them. The officials, however, have hired foreigners in Israeli uniforms, to expel the Jews with brutality. They don't think the trucks are for them, just as they didn't expect to be carried away by the Nazis. They think the official date will be followed, although Barry Chamish warned that the government probably would move faster, to catch the settlers off guard. Indeed, the government now admits it will move earlier.\n\nOrdinary folk believe their leaders, whom they don't realize work with the officials. The leaders against abandonment tell soldiers to follow orders to expel their followers. The leaders arrange calm protests that do not impress the brutal government. The leaders tell their followers, whom the police tell to stop marching, to return home while the leaders appeal to the Supreme Court. Not much can be expected from the left-wing activist Court.\n\nThe government has prepared extensively for expulsion, but the Jews involved have not planned extensively for resistance. They let police move freely in their communities, to watch them and prepare further. The Jews of Gaza do not have cans of gasoline near their hothouses, ready to burn them down, if expulsions goes through, so Peres and the Arabs cannot profit from them (Chamish, 7/19) or have profit as a motive for expulsion.\n\nI don't understand what dynamic it takes to overthrow an oppressive government. I do admire the bravery and high class, good nature of the people who face down the police.\n\nCOURT FREES PROTESTOR\n\nAn Israeli court found no evidence to support the charge of road-blocking against an older man held in prison for nine weeks, pending court appearance. \"On the way to his Supreme Court hearing earlier this month, a policeman brutally pulled Eliyahu Herbst out of the car by his handcuffs, causing him to fall on the ground, and he was then dragged on the ground by his handcuffs until he was thrown into another car. He was then placed in solitary confinement without his belongings or a change of clothes, suffering humiliation in the process.\" (Arutz-7, 7/20.)\n\nThe court acted decently in releasing the man, but failed to punish the police for this among many false arrests and brutality. The government is using ostensible police action as a cover for repression. The unnecessary roughing up of detainees and their long pre-trial imprisonment under harsh conditions are examples. In the US, police carefully tuck prisoners' heads under car roofs, as they place them inside, whereas Israeli police throw people in and pull them out onto the ground and drag them so as to hurt them.\n\nThe government does not treat Arabs that way. Hence this is political. No one in Israel should be treated that way, not Jews, not Arabs. Punishment should be up to the justice system. The consequences may reverberate beyond the current injustice, itself serving a bad cause.\n\nSUPREME COURT COMES DOWN HARD ON ROAD-BLOCKING\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in favor of keeping two protest leaders in prison awaiting trial for road-blocking. It denied that that kind of civil disobedience is within the democratic tradition. It refused to be tolerant, lest it undermine Israeli democracy.\n\nIMRA reminds us that when unions block roads, the courts are lenient and the prosecutors are inactive (IMRA, 7/22).\n\nThe Court's inconsistency indicates that it did not rule in favor of law and order or democracy but to stifle a political movement with which it disagrees ideologically. That is a perversion of justice and anti-democratic. It's expressed concern about democracy is hypocritical.\n\nSHARON'S ASSURANCE TO ARIEL OF BECOMING PART OF ISRAEL\n\nPM Sharon assured residents of Ariel that it would become a contiguous part of Israel. This contradicts US policy. Some observers attributed his unexpectedly right-wing statement to an attempt to head off his main competitor to head the Likud Party, Finance Min. Netanyahu.\n\nOne of Sharon's Labor Party competitors, former PM Barak, said that the day after Gaza is abandoned, it would become clear that the US did not promise Israel to acquiesce in Israel's retaining Ariel or any other settlement blocs. Worse for the integrity of Sharon, Barak pointed out that Sharon knows this now, even as he gives Ariel assurances. Evidence? He omitted Ariel from the security fence (Arutz-7, 7/22).\n\nIsraelis ought to be inured, by now, to Prime Ministers' assurances about security and about firm measures against the Arab enemy. Perhaps they are -- they defeat them for re-election, but the successor picks up where the predecessor left off. Who is putting the successors up to this?\n\nISRAEL BLOCKS \"HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS\"\n\nOne or two hundred activists for the Palestinian Arabs, calling themselves human rights activists, tried to enter Israel from Jordan. Israeli officials marked their passport rejected, and turned them back (7/22). Glad Israel was not masochist about it.\n\nCONGRESS STILL PRETENDS TO MONITOR AID TO P.A.\n\nZOA is proud to have sponsored a bill that just passed the House. The bill supposedly links aid for the P.A. to what the P.A. does against terrorism and incitement to it, and gives Congress more opportunity to shut off such aid. ZOA thinks that the overwhelming vote for the bill indicates frustration over lack of information from the State Dept. about P.A. non-compliance with previously set conditions about terrorism and indoctrination in behalf of it.\n\nThe bill requires the State Dept. to report more on P.A. compliance and releases the aid only if the President certifies that the law's conditions are met. The conditions are a list of the important ones in Oslo and Road Map. ZOA thinks that Congress would maintain more control inasmuch as the bill divides aid into quarterly disbursements, giving more frequent opportunity to cut off aid (IMRA, 7/22).\n\nZOA is fooling itself about this, as Jewish organizations and idealistic Members of Congress tend to do. They are depending upon a dishonest State Dept. to report honestly and a dishonest President to certify honestly. The State Dept. and President routinely lie and pretend the Arabs comply. Such bills are deceptive, a self-deception by ZOA and a phony attempt by certain Members of Congress to take undeserved credit. The US never has penalized P.A. non-compliance. This bill represents the failure of the previous bills, about which Members of Congress boasted and which Jewish organizations praised. If the previous bills worked, this one would not be necessary. It is necessary because the State Dept. and President practiced deceit.\n\nU.S. COURT OF APPEALS REJECTS POLLARD'S APPEAL\n\nThe Court rendered a negative verdict, after having refused to allow Pollard's attorneys to present most of their best arguments, during the oral presentation in March. A judge who expressed an antisemitic sentiment and revealed personal prejudice against Pollard (who did not speak) as considering himself \"special,\" derided the defense's legal efforts but by consuming its limited time with hostile interruptions, did not get to hear what the panel derided in advance.\n\nThe verdict rejects the several points of the appeal. The verdict upholds an earlier court assertion that Pollard filed the initial appeal too late. Many legal experts disagree. The appeal claims that timeliness is not an issue, because the original defense attorney failed to advise his client of his rights in the matter. The appeal claims the issue is grossly inadequate defense in the first place.\n\nThe Court ruled that since Pollard knew what his previous attorneys did, he should have been aware of the legal consequences. That is not true if they did not advise him of the legal consequences. Again, the Court missed the obvious point.\n\nThe appeal demanded an opportunity for defense counsel to inspect the sentencing docket that doomed the client. The Appeals Court denied that too. The justices thus denied elementary justice. It's the kind of ruling one would expect from the Soviet (or Israeli) system.\n\nThe Pollards believe that the judges are acting politically, rather than judicially (IMRA, 7/22). Seems so, all the way through the case, here and in Israel.\n\n\"JERUSALEM POST\" HAS EDITORIAL LIKE MINE\n\nThe PA \"foreign minister has candidly reneged on the PA's road map commitments to confiscate weapons and explosives\" from the illegal militias. Sec. \"Rice nevertheless complimented the Palestinian leadership for taking 'important steps' against terrorism.\" \"What 'steps' she was referring to was left to the imagination,\" while terrorism is escalating. The US continues being evenhanded, though one side is preparing for peace, and the other, for war (IMRA, 7/24).\n\nThey neither know nor understand,\n\nThey go about in darkness.\n\n-- Psalm 82:5\n\nOne of the ancient Hebrew documents found among the Dead Sea Scrolls tells of an epochal War of the Sons of Light and the Sons of Darkness.\n\nThe Children of Israel from ancient times to the present day have endured and survived many a war against them by other peoples' Sons of Darkness. Now, they are under assault by the darkest of their own sons, a war proclaimed such bland names as Peace Process, Roadmap, and Disengagement.\n\nOh, my people!\n\nYour leaders are misleaders.\n\nThey have confused the course of your paths.\n\n-- Isaiah 3:12\n\n\"No Jew has the right to yield the rights of the Jewish People in Israel. No Jew has the authority to do so. No Jewish body has the authority to do so. Not even the entire Jewish People alive today as the right to yield any part of Israel\"\n\n-- David Ben-Gurion\n\nThe decline in Israel's strength and standing during the last twelve years is not an achievement of the enemies bent on its destruction. It is brought about by its own Sons of Darkness who conceived and managed to impose the doctrine of surrender to those enemies, beginning with the lethal Oslo Accords and the refusal to rescind them after they were proven lethal. Now, encouraged by their own successes against their own people, they push on to the even more lethal Disengagement. [See further Issues Nos. 37, 39, 40, 45, 46, 49, 50, 51]\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nSharon and his inner-circle cronies invented Disengagement without even informing much less consulting those responsible for the nation's security and well-being. The IDF Chief-of-Staff first learned of it from a public news report. Israel's best interests were never a factor or even a consideration in concocting and forcing through this plan. The make-believe advantages turn out to be empty excuses.\n\n1] There is scarcely a pretense that Disengagement will lead to peace, or even to a lower level of PLO hostility and terrorism. Mahmoud Abbas and his fellow Terror Chiefs make it clear that they regard Disengagement as a victory for terrorism, urge PLO journalists to \"celebrate it\", and openly plan to exploit the new scope given them for terrorist campaigns.\n\nThe Sharon regime's Ambassador to the United States was recently quoted as saying that after Disengagement is complete, then Israel will demand that the PLO dismantle its terrorist structure. Such a remark is stupidity beyond the call of duty.\n\n2] Disengagement will not free Israel of a burden of Gaza. Even while it encourages and empowers the PLO/Hamas, Israel will still have to supply them with water, utility, and other services, augmented by ever more extravagent demands on their behalf from Condoleeza Rice. Sharon cannot even go on touting his plan as \"independent\" of the PLO, when Rice demands \"coordination\" with her protege.\n\n3] Sharon in past alleged that Disengagement would bring Israel some relief from outside pressure for concessions, and even Bush-Rice Administration permission to keep some little bits of the Land of Israel. Instead, the show of Israeli weakness contributes to an administration policy that is revealed by its recent proclamations to be egregiously pro-PLO. [See Issue No. 53]\n\n4] It is reported that Sharon and his cronies invented Disengagement to cover up the alleged corruption and criminal frauds of Sharon and his sons Gilad and Omri. If this is so, the scheme has failed. The Attorney General declined to use the mass of evidence of improprieties committed by Ariel and Gilad Sharon, but he has indicted Omri Sharon for crooked fund-raising and campaign misconduct.\n\nNews media and Osloid politicians openly state that they will turn against him once they have gotten the Disengagement for which they yearn. Shimon Peres and his party have promised to bring down the government if Disengagement is not quickly followed by the surrender of the rest of Judea and Samaria and Jerusalem. Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak demands that, in view of the Sharon family's naughty ways, Sharon should retire from public life -- as soon as he has carried through the Disengagement.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nSharon and his henchpersons set in place all the support they expected to need. Members of the cabinet who were firm against Disengagement were fired to prevent them from voting on it. The Osloid-Defeatist Labor Party, that the electorate had massively rejected, was brought into the government. Shimon Peres, Prince of the Sons of Darkness, became Vice Prime Minister. [See Issue No. 49] Both the IDF Chief-of-Staff and the national Chief of Intelligence were ousted for insufficient enthusiasm for the Disengagement and their posts bestowed on more compliant replacements. A supportive Attorney-General, Minister of Defense, Minister of Internal Security, Minister of Justice, and Chief of Police were installed.\n\nMost of the news media were already in place, eager to jettison any journalistic ethics that might get in the way of a plan that so perfectly matches their own anti-national and anti-religious agenda. They became instant temporary champions of a man they hate -- but only for as long as he useful to them.\n\nOne of their number exhorts the media to treat Sharon as tenderly as an etrog\" until the Disengagement has been accomplished. An etrog is a citron used a symbol of the fruitfulness of the Land during the week-long harvest festival of Sukkot. Those who observe this festival happily choose their etrogs and carefully preserve them. The media's modern universalists are not notably respectful of such ancestral traditions, so there may be an implied smirk in this choice of simile, along with the implication that after Sukkot/Disengagement is over then so is the role of the etrog.\n\nOrgans of justice and the judiciary place the Arch-Disengager above the law. The Attorney General closes the file on Sharon's alleged serial corruptions. A senior police official explains why Sharon should be exempt from investigation: \"It's unreasonable to topple a government over criminal cases . . . policy is not to delve into cases that might incriminate the Prime Minister, in order not to destabilize the regime\".\n\nThe Supreme Court of Israel, notorious for assuming the right to impose its own enlightened morality on society, approves this unique immunity because \"the indictment of a Prime Minister would lead, probably immediately, to changes in the government order in the country, which would be liable to have a dramatic influence on the policy.\"\n\nNot one of the excuses for Disengagement is valid. Why, then, are Sharon and his henchpersons careening down a slide toward disaster to Israel, triumph to its enemies, dividing and endangering society and even compromising the IDF that stands guard over it?\n\nThose who contrived the Oslo Accords did not themselves believe they would bring peace -- though they tricked others into believing it. What they did believe is that that throwing away the Promised Land after it was finally redeemed would break the Jewish heart and crush the Jewish spirit. After that, their country would be free of old-fashioned traditions and observances and out-dated standards of personal morality. Perhaps the world would allow them to keep a bit of rump state in which to strut their post-Judaic post-Zionist enlightened universalism. They have not yet achieved this goal, but they are still working at it.\n\nExcerpts from \"Scorched-earth Kulturkampf,\" by Caroline Glick, The Jerusalem Post, 11 July 2005:\n\n\"[. . . . ] In Haaretz's Friday editorial the rationale for the Left's support of Sharon's plan was laid bare: 'The disengagement of Israeli policy from its religious fuel is the real disengagement currently on the agenda. On the day after the disengagement, religious Zionism's status will be different . . . . The real question is not how many mortar shells will fall, or who will guard the Philadelphi route, or whether the Palestinians will dance on the roofs of Ganei Tal. The real question is who sets the national agenda.'\n\n\"Doron Rosenblum, one of the paper's chief columnists, spelled the message out even more bluntly on Sunday, fulminating, 'There is an enemy on the Right . . . . at least let him not complain about being treated like an enemy . . . . '\n\n'Dan Margalit, the senior commentator at [the newspaper] Ma'ariv . . . . argued in favor of placing quotas on the number of religious Jews allowed to serve as officers in the IDF. Referring to religious Jews serving in the IDF as 'the dear brothers,' Margalit invoked the Latin expression for quotas for Jews restricting their right to study in European and American universities in the early 20th century - the infamous numerus clausus. He warned religious Israelis that if they refuse to carry out the expulsion of Jews from Gaza and northern Samaria, 'the reaction to their action is liable to be a numerus clausus, this time in Hebrew, Jews against Jews. Hair-raising, but there is no choice.'\n\n\"What we see here unfolding is a situation where the anti-religious Left, the primary supporters of Ariel Sharon's policy to forcibly expel 10,000 Jews from their homes and communities, has given the policy their support -- through its members' legal authority and public platforms -- not because they see any security benefit arising from the move. In fact, they support the plan despite its security dangers because they see it as a culminating battle in their cultural war against religious Zionism.\n\n\"[. . . .] There are multiple and weighty arguments against the withdrawal and expulsion plan. Some of them relate to the moral issue of expelling Jews from their homes and making areas of the Land of Israel - or any land for that matter - off-limits to all Jews. [. . . .] Aside from the moral questions, all Israelis who don't have a death wish are concerned with the security implications of handing land and strategic positions over to a junta of terrorists who have repeatedly stated their intention to use that land and those positions to advance their terror war against the State of Israel.\n\n\"Yet, to date, due to the negligence of the media and the courts, no government official -- from the prime minister on down -- has been called on to answer how Israel will be militarily better off without Gaza and northern Samaria. Indeed, no government spokesman from Sharon on down has been able to coherently explain how Israel will defend itself when Gaza and northern Samaria are under Hamas and Fatah control.\n\n\"The security consequences of the plan have been systematically ignored while the full brunt of media scrutiny has been placed on its religious opponents. They are reviled as zealots, criminals and extremists. Rabbis are threatened with firings and the closing of their yeshivot if they do not toe the government line. Gaza residents are accused of being money-grubbing and wasteful of government resources for forcing the IDF to expel them rather than leaving their homes quietly and meekly. Religious Jews are being intimidated with threats to keep them out of the army or prevent their promotion in the ranks, simply because it will be necessary to prevent what Margalit refers to as 'difficulties with future operations'.\n\n\"There are ample reasons to be concerned about and, indeed, oppose a plan that involves no security opportunities -- only expanding threats -- for Israel. But at the end of the day what is even more debilitating are the plan's implications for the future of Israel as a democracy.\n\n\"When the loudest voices favoring it are those espousing hatred and exclusion of religious Zionists, . . . it becomes absolutely clear that for the plan's strongest advocates, capitulation to terror is a means of carrying out their culture war against religious Jews.\n\n\"And just as security can be readily sacrificed, democracy and the rule of law become mere Pascal lambs on the altar of cultural supremacy -- ignored, reviled and happily trounced on the path to victory in the culture war these priests of enlightenment instigated against their brethren years and years ago.\"\n\nAn example that reveals the anti-religious factor in the campaign as reported by IsraelNationalNews.com, 20 July 2005:\n\n\"An Israel Broadcasting Authority crew traveling towards Kfar Maimon to cover the events surrounding the March to Gaza was stopped en route by police for a routine inspection.\n\n\"One crew member, an Orthodox male wearing a kippa [yarmulke] was instructed to step out of the vehicle. He was questioned as to the purpose of his presence, responding he is a member of the film crew. He displayed his Government Press Office press credentials, but police continued to suspect his motives for traveling to Kfar Maimon.\n\n\"Only following the intervention of co-workers, who explained he is a member of their regular crew, was he permitted to return to the vehicle and continue towards Kfar Maimon.\"\n\nComment: Sharon recently made a supposedly public address, at which all men wearing kippot (skull-caps of observant Jews) were denied entry.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nAmong the closest of Sharon's cronies is Dov Weisglass, his personal attorney, his one-time government Bureau Chief, and his favored emissary to both the United States and the PLO. Weisglass is believed to be the counsellor who invented Disengagement as a jolly good way \"to change the public agenda away from the media's focus on the investigation\" of Sharon family corruptions.\n\nAmong Weisglass's lucrative legal clients have been Arafat's personal treasurer, who is also a buddy of Omri Sharon, and the gambling casino in ancient Jericho owned by the PLO and its Austrian partners. The profits from the casino ran up to $1,000,000 a day, as hyper-secular Israelis came to donate their losings to the PLO terror-fund and other interested parties.\n\nWeissglass reportedly seeks to expand his casino-clientele via a beach-and- gambling resort to be build at Elei Sinai in Gaza, as soon as the present obstacles of Jewish homes, farms, and communities are cleared away.\n\nOther parties to the Elei Sinai renewal project include:\n\n1] Shmuel Flatto-Sharon in his native France was convicted of embezzlement of $60,000,000 and sentenced to five years in prison. He escaped to Israel, sought immunity from extradition to France by buying himself a seat in the Knesset, and then served a nine-month prison term for the vote-buying.\n\nThe twice-convicted felon comes to Elai Sinai in his silver Mercedes limousine. He is working for permits from the PLO to proceed with the gambling casino, and from the government Israel to let Israelis to lose more money there.\n\n2] Cyril Kern, an old buddy of Sharon's and now a resident of South Africa, was an investor in the PLO's Jericho casino. His gift of $1,500,000 to the Sharon family and/or political campaign, is under investigation.\n\n3] Martin Shlaff is an Austrian banker and financier, was an investor in the PLO's Jericho casino. He part in transferring funds to the Sharon family/campaign is under investigation.\n\n4] Norbert Aleman, a business tycoon in Las Vegas, Nevada, the center for gambling casinos in the United States.\n\n5] A Saudi Arabian multi-billionaire who is also interested in buying the state-of-the-art agricultural greenhouses after the Jews who built them are expelled.\n\nThe head of Sharon's Disengagement Coordinating Team is Eival Giladi. He is simultaneously the Chief Executive Office of the financial Portland Trust that does business with the PLO in Gaza. Giladi raised $500,000,000 to invest in PLO housing in Gaza after the Jewish housing has been razed.\n\nThe largest investor in the Portland Trust is Sir Ronald Cohen, a close associate of Chancellor of the Exchequer and Prime-Minister-in-Waiting Gordon Brown. The charter of the Portland Trust commits it \"to advance the interests of both the British government and the European Union\".\n\nComment: It is reported that Elei Sinai is slated to be the first Jewish community demolished.\n\nSo -- What are the benefits of Disengagement?\n\n1] Jews alienated from their own tradition can vent their spite on the Jews who remain faithful.\n\n2] Entrepreneurs of problematic ethics can pocket their profits.\n\n3] The PLO/Hamas terrorists can rejoice at their victory over an Israel that was once uniquely staunch against terrorism.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n\"When the people fear their government, there is tyranny.\n\nWhen the government fears the people, there is liberty.\"\n\n-- Thomas Jefferson\n\nThe Disengagers did not bother with securing support from an element of society they regard as insignificant: The people.

That perception of ruthless egomania was correct, though so far Sharon has not needed the tanks. He has never taken any meaningful action against the terrorist entity that slaughters Israelis, but he is fierce against Jews who defy his whims.\n\nJerusalem Sharon orders IDF to use force against Jews By Jerusalem Newswire Editorial Staff July 17th, 2005\n\n\"As disengagement gets underway Prime Minister Ariel Sharon Sunday ordered the IDF to use 'all force' necessary to prevent Israeli Jews from entering the Gaza Strip with the intention of thwarting his 'disengagement' plan. Ha'aretz reported that as IDF Chief of Staff Dan Halutz was briefing the cabinet on a weekend clash between security forces and Gaza settlers at the Kissufim Crossing, Sharon interrupted and demanded the army take all measures to put down the protesters.\n\n\"You must act with all severity. I instruct to use all force to prevent the entry of protesters [into Gaza] and to prevent assaults on IDF soldiers,\" Sharon was quoted as saying. [Comment: It is PLO terrorists, not loyal Jews, who plan assault on IDF soldiers.]\n\n\"Hundreds of Jewish settlers marched on Kissufim Crossing Saturday evening to protest the permanent closure of Gaza to all non-resident Israelis. [. . . .] During the melee, nine soldiers openly refused orders to fight their fellow Jews. The government and army vowed to deal with the soldiers harshly, and decided to disband their unit.\n\n\"Sharon blamed the right-wing activity against his policies for the failure to put a stop to ongoing terrorist artillery attacks against Jews in and around Gaza. . . . . Analysts, however, suggested Sharon's diplomatic considerations were preventing massive defensive action by IDF ground forces already massed on Gaza's northern border since last Friday.\"\n\nThere are mounting charges of brutality by agents of the government in the police and the prisons. Among those reported by IsraelNationalNews.com, 12 July 2005:\n\n\"The Knesset Law Committee today viewed an Arutz-7 film of police beating an anti-evacuation protestor, and it demanded an investigation. The film showed police severely beating Akiva Vitkin, who was trying to block traffic on June 29 in Ramat Gan, adjacent to Tel Aviv.\n\n\"One policeman motioned to his colleagues to help beat Vitkin, and they sat on him and stuck fingers in his nose and mouth, causing excessive bleeding and facial injuries. [. . . . ]\"\n\n19 July 2005:\n\n\"After 54 days in jail, the court has released Eliyahu Herbst because there is no incriminating evidence against him. He was released with no limitations at all.\n\n\"Herbst, father of 6 and grandfather of 2, was originally arrested in Arad during the first roadblockings, for 'standing in an illegal assembly and not dispersing'. The judge offered to release him on condition that he not take part in further illegal demonstrations, but he refused, saying, 'The evidence against me shows that I was only standing nearby - so that means that every time I walk in the street I can be accused of violating the conditions'.\n\n\"During his stay in jail, the police consistently abused him, physically and emotionally. Individuals from the Nahshon unit violently pushed and dragged him while bringing him, handcuffed, to jail. In the Maaseyahu prison, he was kept in solitary confinement for 20 days, with no reason given. He was also given other punishments, such as denial of visits and phone calls, with no explanation.\"\n\nOn the other side of the scale, enforcers of Disengagement are not immune from punishment.\n\nNegev District Police Commander Niso Shacham was in charge of action against the civilian \"protestors\" peaceably assembled and forcibly detained within his jurisdiction.\n\nA TV-news crew filmed and recorded his instructions to a subordinate on how to deal with the \"protestors\". His words are as brutal, vicious, and obscene as might be expected from a Cossack leading a pogram.\n\nAfter the public release of his performance, Chief of Police Moshe Karadi investigated Shacham's professional demeanor and ruled that:\n\n1. he will not in the future deal with \"protestors\"\n\n2. a reprimand will be entered in his record\n\n3. six days' pay will be docked from his salary.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nCitizens are denied the right to travel if the government does not like the itinerary. In cities around the Land, agents of the government tried to prevent citizens from assembling at Netivot [inside the \"green line\"] to protest the official sealing off entry to the Jewish towns of Gush Katif. Police stopped lawfully chartered buses, evicted the passengers, and even confiscated the licenses of the drivers.\n\nThe sun shining above wakes me up. I'm delighted to see that I actually got in a full night's sleep (Hey - 9:30 to a bit after 6 is even better than at home!) I get myself organized, see that Elchanan [who has generously invited us strangers into his home!] has left the door open for us to avail ourselves of his facilities and quietly wash up so I can say my prayers and start my day. Lucky me for the early start, 'cause by the time I finish, the lines are forming once again for our host's bathroom. I eat breakfast, and join Elchanan for a coffee. I'm actually not much of a coffee drinker, but Elchanan is so put out by my not taking anything from him, that I figure that may as well have a coffee. I feel that our hosts are being so generous it is hard for me to take advantage of it. N. [my friend] and I limit ourselves to the bathroom and the fridge and leave the showers and extras to others. People are constantly asking for outlets to recharge their cellphones as well. At one point, Elchanan laughed and told one person that if he finds a spare outlet, he's welcome to it, but at the moment they're all being used.\n\nIt seems that some things were relaxed overnight, and the makolet was restocked as well. N.'s daughter comes and tells us that last night a shipment of pizza and other food supplies came in from Atzmona in Gush Katif. N. goes to do some shopping. Afterwards we head down to the morning rally. Not much that's new, more pep talks, more singing, Rav Druckman is leading us all in song. More reminders of nonviolence, patience. Reminders to drink and rest for the next leg of our journey. Reminders of activities for children and shiurim for the youths and adults. Reminders to take good care of Kfar Maimon and keep the place neat and clean. I meet someone I know. He tells me that he'd gone home the day before and snuck back in early that morning. Despite the roadblocks and cordoning, it seems that people are still making it in. (Later at home, I'm told about one family who snuck across the fields to Kfar Maimon, only to be helped by one of the soldiers who wheeled their baby carriage across the field and led them to an opening in the fence.) We're told that there is a lost and found behind the shul, so after the rally I head there to look for my water bottle with insulated bag that had disappeared the day before. On the way I see some people reading the paper. I join the crowds to see what it has to say. A bit surprised at the warm coverage, I look for the correspondent's name - and then notice that the paper is HaTzofeh Oh well, at least someone likes us\n\nAs I continue to the shul, through the throngs of people I notice some soldiers among the crowds. They came in from the group ringing us to visit with some friends. I ask them what unit they're with - not my son's unit I'm glad to hear. But that makes me wonder. I send my son an SMS message - hey! If you're nearby, come visit me! Finally find the lost and found, but sadly my insulated bag is not there. On my way I hear that there's a lawyer who's giving out legal advice, what to do in case you're arrested. Since this is another big fear of mine (I'm really a straight, law-abiding citizen, very non-confrontational. Just the thought of entering a confrontation with soldiers or police ties my stomach up in knots. What can I say? I was born a real chicken), I decide to join the group. We are told that he will speak without any loudspeakers and only to small groups so as to avoid his getting into trouble. I wonder at the world we live in - where a lawyer providing free legal advice has to worry about being arrested for incitement. Now picture me - I'm standing there in my jeans skirt, orange shirt and cap, with a pouch holding all my essentials (cellphone, siddur, pen and pad with emergency numbers in case I'm arrested - G-d forbid - or something). Since I'm really big on taking notes to help me remember things, I pull out my pad and pen and begin writing down what he has to say. All of a sudden, someone begins yelling and pointing in my direction - watch out! A member of the press! I of course, deny the accusation. So I'm asked - so how come you're writing it down? I explain that I want to relay the information to other people and besides, I remember best that way. People calm down and our lawyer continues. Actually, good think I took notes, because afterwards groups of people approach me asking me to repeat what was told. One person tells me he's with a group of students and asks for pen and paper to write down key points to relay to them as well. I hear the end of the lawyer's talk one more time, and then follow him once again to another group and, and get some new pointers. Someone there sees me and laughs, told me that he's been following him around too. I guess someone else there is as nervous as me\n\nPeople are passing around cartons of apples - a donation from settlements in the Golan. The day before we had pears donated by the people of Kfar Maimon. Later I see someone with a giant gourd- it seems that some settlement had sent cartons of those as well (although hardly as practical, I guess those who came with cooking equipment could do something with it ). As I roam around, I bump into my niece's husband, and then someone else that I hadn't seen since I got off our bus at the Plugot intersection. She suggests a walk to the fence to see what's up. While we walk my phone rings. It's my son, the army officer. \"Where are you, Ima? Going home yet?\" he wants to know. I tell him where I am, and that I'll be staying one more day (I'd planned on staying till Wednesday, but with the change in program I figured I'd stay for as long as I could - my food and husband's patience should last till Thursday I figured.). Go home he begs. Not yet, but soon I promise. My heart aches for him.\n\nAnyway, my son tells me he'll be stopping by for a visit. I tell him that I 'll be waiting by the gate. As I approach the gate, I see that some of the chemical lavatories and the water tanks from the encampment have been moved here. I see this guy running up he tells us to go to the gate and stop people from leaving - people are leaving in droves. I am told to be careful - he is provocateur. But then, skeptical me thinks that anyone saying things we don't want to hear would probably be called a provocateur.\n\nI get my first view of the gate and realize I can't stay there. There is an opening near the gate where people leave and enter, but the sight of that gate handcuffed shut I find too unsettling for words. Protesters from Kfar Maimon are milling about over there. The police are grouped there too, eating ices. (Just inside the gate is a man selling ices from a cart. He shouts out: Aritkim! Artikim! 2 shekel an artik! And then adds - I love this protest, come protest every day!) I set out towards the fence where the soldiers are lined up. There are groups of kids, youths, adults around the soldiers, some playing music and singing, some offering them treats and drinks, some lecturing them about what they should or should not be doing, some just talking to them. Stickers and pamphlets are handed out. One young girl walks up and down the fence looking for a soldier to play volleyball with her over the fence. I didn't see any takers while I was there, but back home I spoke to someone who said that she saw a girl playing volleyball with soldiers over the fence, so I guess she eventually did find one. I stand next to the fence, my heart going out to these young soldiers. Although I'm facing a group of officers (and I wonder how the army gets together such a large group of officers only), they all seem pretty young to me. One young boy walks up to these poor officers standing in the hot sun and offers them some ice cubes from a bag. They all nod no thanks. Noticing a pattern, I say: What is it? You've been told not to take anything from us? One young woman soldier half nods. I don't have much patience for nonsense. I take some ice from the boy and drop it into pockets and hands and a hat someone was fanning himself with. There, I tell them. You didn't take anything. I gave, none of you took. The woman soldier is delighted, she runs the ice cube up and down her arms. She takes another cube and drops it down the back of the shirt of the soldier next to her, who stuck his hands behind him so as not to even be given a cube. They loosen up a bit. I will not tell any of these soldiers what decisions to make. I know that there are many who urge soldiers to refuse orders. It feels immoral, unethical for me to tell them what to do. Whatever they do will be hard enough. They each have to make their own decisions. I certainly will not discuss it with a soldier on duty, it feels wrong to me. I think that just the outpouring of love that they're getting speaks louder than any words telling them what their decisions should be. Besides, they are the ones who have to live with the results of whatever decision they make, not me. I begin talking to the soldiers, though. One of the soldiers talks about all the kids here. Lucky it's vacation time, she says. This way this gives the kids something to do. I'm sure that many of the kids are there because their friends are there, but their friends are there along with them because these are the values they've been brought up on- devotion to country and people, the idea that there should be no reward for terror, the idea that we are responsible for people besides ourselves. Some times I wonder what values other people are raised on - these seem such basic values.\n\nA news broadcaster gets ready for broadcast. He's set up on the back of a van near the fence. People watch him, and listen to his report - he seems to be reporting to England. He tells that many people have left, and there are now only about 2000 protesters left in Kfar Maimon. Given the fact that only around the gates and front fence there seems to be several hundred people, that statement seems rather ridiculous, and provokes angry retorts from the people around him. One frustrated young man asks him - why do you lie to people? I too wonder. What I have learned from all this - I no longer trust anything I hear on the news. I hope I'll remember that down the road. I hope even more that the news becomes eventually something that people can hear and believe. On the march and at Kfar Maimon I noticed several members of the press who walked alongside us and held serious discussions with the people around them, trying to understand where we were coming from. Many others couldn't seem to care less, and seemed more interested in presenting what they felt people wanted to hear, or just worked according to their won agenda rather than try to reach any real dialogue.\n\nMy son calls, he's arrived. I go to greet him. He's arrived with a bunch of other officers - all of whom have friends and family within the compound. He looks tired. No wonder, too. Their conditions, it seems, are much worse than ours. (My son is very quiet about things, this I learned from others.) Since my family is really very important to me, I feel better and worse for having seen him. Out of respect for my son's privacy, we will let it rest at that.\n\nI return to Elchanan's lawn. On the way I pass a table with lunch set up there. Heaven help us, on this broiling day they've been giving out cholent (along with rolls and cans of pineapple). I joke and ask them if they're getting ready for Shabbat already. The many paths in Kfar Maimon are packed with people - its odd, these metropolis-like hordes of people moving about on these quiet pastoral paths. And that joker reported that we're down to 2000. Ridiculous!\n\nI sit in front of Elchanan's house watching the people walking by. I laugh with one of the girls - true, people left during the day, but there are new people there as well. They can be recognized by their fresh clothing - those of us there from the beginning look rumpled already. We begin to notice people walking around with new signs hanging from orange ribbons around their necks which read: \"Ani Lo HaOyev\"(I am not the enemy!) I comment that these are the most boring interesting days I have ever spent.\n\nElchanan invites me to join him inside and get out of the sun. He tells me about the history of the area, stories from his army years, talks about the missiles that have been falling in the area lately - not just in Gush Katif, but in their general area as well. We also discuss the pleas with soldiers to refuse orders. Elchanan wants to know how many of the people now urging soldiers to refuse orders were in the army, and if so, how many of them ever refused orders. He talks of his sons, who also served in the army and were officers. He talks of the \"chinuch\" we've given our children to love of country and respect for the army. How do we let it all go down the drain? I agree with him. When we cried out against the left wing \"sarvanim\" we set in motion the problems now facing possible right wing sarvanim. We taught our children that politics aside, and army aside. How do we change our tune now when the politics now speak to us so strongly? I understand and respect the Avi Biebers, but I also understand and respect the soldiers who crying on the inside, do what they are told to do, however much it pains them.\n\nElchanan and I wonder what next. People are getting discouraged by the hours of inactivity. People want to be DOING something, not just sitting around waiting for the next step. People are leaving. I wonder how much longer we can stay - I have a family at home and Shabbat is coming up. Elchanan wonders how the people of Kfar Maimon can host such multitudes over Shabbat. It begins to be clear that at today's afternoon rally will have to declare a move, or lose the people. The PA continues to announce that we should drink and rest to get strength for the next leg. Talk is that yes, we will be moving out tonight. We all regather on the lawn and get ourselves organized for moving out. Last trips to the bathroom. Farewells to our gracious host. Last minute we decide to leave our bags organized near the door so we don't have to \"shlep\" it through the afternoon rally as well. We gather on the lawn, where we are told to stand separately, men on the right, women on the left. It takes a while before all the people are gathered. I look around and can see that there are fewer people than the day before, but we still number in the tens of thousands. Rav Schapiro talks. Then we have some other speakers as well. We say the Mincha prayers and more psalms. There is a new spirit, you can see the exaltation in peoples faces as they pray. There is something very special about this praying together, thousands of people together as one. We are again and again reminded that we are gathered together for a nonviolent protest. Should we be confronted by police or soldiers blocking our way, we are to sit. Makes sense to me - someone sitting can hardly be considered threatening The final speaker gives us our marching orders - Rabbis, Knesset members and other dignitaries first, then the yeshivot with their young men, then other men, then women, and families should bring up the rear. This is it. I can feel my stomach knotting up. We hurry back to Elchanan's to pick up our bags and once more say farewell. Then we head back down to the center. The men are beginning maariv prayers. We're not sure what we should be doing - if the men are praying, do we wait, we're women, they should be before us As we stand around, we see a family in front of us. The mother looks familiar - she has some children with her. Her little boy, about 8 is crying. It seems that they're tourists from the States, who came in to Kfar Maimon for the day. The 8-year-old wants to go home! We try and reassure him - no chance of getting out right now, but soon We begin talking - no wonder the mother looks familiar - we were in college together a hundred years ago or so. Reassuring the little boy calms me down a bit, but then the voice over the PA asks us to continue. Stay in line, follow the rabbis, stay close, don't loiter. We follow the ranks of young men ahead of us. The kids around us seem thrilled, we're finally moving. The adults seem a little more tense. I send SMS messages to my family at home - now is the time to say Tehillim for us I write. I pray to Hashem that we succeed, that we make it through all right, that no one gets hurt. As we proceed towards one of Kfar Maimon's back gates, the tension mounts. We end up near an ambulance, when the procession stops. The army is not letting us through. Following our orders, we sit. I am amazed at the number of people, including women with babies pushing ahead. What is it- they want front row seats with their babies and toddlers at confrontations with the police? N. calls out to remind them that people with families should be at the back, but is generally ignored. A young man ahead of us calls out, frustrated, asking people to stop pushing ahead, there is no room. There are no megaphones to let us know what is happening ahead of us. Darkness has descended, but we are in the dark in more ways than one.\n\nAfter a while rumors begin filtering back. We've been stopped. The rabbis are negotiating with the police. We're not really sure what's happening. Eventually we are told to proceed. To continue the procession. We get up and continue marching past the last houses. We come to an open dust field. Looks like something prepared for a further building stage - maybe for houses for next generation Kfar Maimon dwellers. There are one or two smaller, newer houses on the large lot. Beyond the lot, a road and the back part of the security fence. There are crowds in front of a gate on the left. There are also people along the fence, and scattered through the lot. N.'s younger daughter is nervous. She is constantly checking us both, making sure that both adults are near her. We are not quite sure what it is we're supposed to do, and where we're supposed to be doing it. We decide to sit and munch on something till we figure out what exactly we're supposed to be doing. Then word comes again - follow the rabbis, do not stop at the fence. Only none of us know anymore where the rabbis are. We mill around, and eventually head to the perimeter road ahead of us. There are people all around us. Some people are grouped by the gate to our left, some are talking with the security forces behind the fence, others are walking down the road to our right. We're told to continue walking, so we head towards our right. Eventually we reach another gate. Don't see any rabbis or dignitaries here either. Not sure what to do, and feeling a bit ridiculous, we decide to sit.\n\nI get a call from my soldier son - Where are you Ima? I dunno - I' m by a gate. Which gate? he wants to know. How should I know which gate? Are you by the gate with Rav Aviner he asks. I have no idea where Rav Aviner is, I tell him, the only thing I can see by the gate is a van right outside it with a policeman and a soldier standing on its roof. My son doesn't see that, I hear the relief in my his voice.\n\nI realize we're at different gates. People are sitting around, frustrated. A young girl by the fence asks people if anyone has a working cellphone. I tell her my battery is low - Here it is Wednesday evening and it hasn't been charged since Monday morning. A policeman behind the fence commiserates with us. Asks why we didn't recharge it in Kfar Maimon. Told us that he's been keeping his phone off, only turning it on to call his wife before she goes to bed to let her know that everything is ok. On opposite sides of the fence, but in the same boat.\n\nNear us are a group of girls singing to the soldiers to the left. I find it funny - young soldiers being serenaded in the night. Near us a young man is arguing with a secular man. The secular man says that we were silly to listen to the rabbis - we should have fought with the police and broken out. He tells us that 90% of the secular population is with us- or would be if they saw that we were the winning side. If we would break through in a show of strength, all the secular would be joining us. I find that a bit naive - certainly not true about most of the secular people I work with. The argument progresses into different avenues as well. A young couple settles down next to me. The young woman falls asleep in her husband's arms, too exhausted to spread out a bedroll or anything. Sometimes even doing not much of anything can be very exhausting.\n\nThen the rumors come again. Continue marching. Proceed to the front gate. We're not sure anymore what is the quickest route. Back the way we came? To the right along the fence? Anyone know? Do we flip a coin? Almost - some people head back, some continue along the fence. N. and I walk with the girls along the fence. N. and I joke - like in Jericho, till the walls fall down? Her girls are getting tired. And frustrated. They've had enough. As we walk along, the younger one asks us to talk to the soldiers. So we call out as we pass, good night. Don't worry; you'll be home soon. Some of them nod at our words. At this point, that is all that they want - to be back home. We come across a group huddled around a police van on the perimeter road. Nothing to worry about - a young man is having a discussion with a police officer, and everyone else is gathered around to listen. We have some amazingly eloquent and intelligent young people among us.\n\nWe continue our walk. There are a number of men from the border patrol lined up inside the fence (later we're told that they were there to prevent us talking to the soldiers outside the fence - not sure how true that was, because didn't see them preventing any talking). Further down there are a group of them sitting down and smoking, singing to one of their friends \"Ohavim et Yaki, ohavim et Yaki\" to the tune we'd been singing the \"ohavim et Tzahal\". We get a laugh out of it. I guess they'll be returning home with stories of their own, and the songs they've learned from us.\n\nN.'s kids have definitely had it. Our route takes us back into the village, past some young men with megaphones. N. approaches them to ask about buses back to Yerushalayim. We were told that there would be buses back to Yerushalayim on Wednesday. Where are they? The young men don't know. They ask us to continue to the gate. They sing. Neither N. nor her children are reassured. Me, I don't have many expectations any more, but at least my stomach hasn't been knotted up any more for the last while, not since I realized that there isn't going to be much excitement that night. As we near the front gates, it is well past midnight. We see lines of cars and jeeps all packed up and filled with people leaving. We sit near the front gate waiting to hear what's up. We don't hear anything, but we begin seeing people heading back towards the center of the village. What's up, we want to know. Didn't you hear? No, not a thing. They thanked us, and announced that the police were not letting us progress towards Kissufim. We should realize that what we did has been important, but most people aren't buying it. They are too frustrated. N.'s kids want to go home. It is now 12:45 - it makes no sense to head back towards Yerushalayim. All the cars leaving are full, and even if we made it into Netivot how would we continue from there? I suggest that we return to Elchanan and get a good night's sleep and continue on home the next morning. That's what we do.\n\nWe find our young friends there as well. They're already settled down for the night, although still up. It seems pretty unanimous- we'll all be heading for home the next morning.\n\nWake up Thursday. Same routine. Fewer people lining up for Elchanan's bathroom, but there are still long lines. People are cleaning up around them. I go down with N. to the center to find out about buses to Yerushalayim. They say there will be some leaving at ten. I try and find my nephew, see how he's going back, but my brother tells me that he made it back to Yerushalayim at 4 in the morning. He gives me the name and number of a friend of his who's there with a car. The friend has to get to Netivot to pick up his car, but he says he'll come pick me up from there. The people I talk to are largely frustrated, they want to know what they took off from work for. What was accomplished? I'm not sure yet how I feel. I hear rumors that while we were busy diverting security forces, a large group slipped out of another gate pretending to be going back home, but headed into Gush Katif instead. That makes me feel better. But then, while I agree that sitting around not doing much was frustrating, I'm not so sure that nothing was accomplished. Tens of thousands of people were gathered together closely with people on the outside and authorities expecting violence, injuries, even deaths. Instead, we were able to maintain order, and spread goodwill. We served to show the depths of depravity of the government and how far it had fallen from the democratic society it purports itself to be. But I learned the biggest lesson of the importance of our efforts once I left Kfar Maimon.\n\nWhen I headed out of Kfar Maimon, there were lines of people waiting for the free buses that the police were providing for rides to Netivot. I was waiting for Yair, my brother's friend at the gate. He called to let me know first that he was on his way, and then that he was stopped, police would not let him make the left turn from Netivot onto the road to Kfar Maimon. I told him I would walk, or hitch a ride to where he was, but please, wait for me. I saw the long lines of people waiting for the buses, but knew that no way whatsoever am I going to take advantage of the police rides to Netivot. It seemed too much to me like giving in. I started walking, and then saw a cab heading out of Kfar Maimon. I flagged him down, figuring that let it cost whatever it cost, at least I'm not taking up the police offer. I get into the car, there is someone sitting next to the driver (later I hear him tell the driver to pick up as many people as possible, he'll pay). As I open my mouth to ask how much the ride to the end of the road will cost me, the driver begins singing our praise. We were terrific! We were wonderful! He was so proud of us! The whole nation should be proud of us! As he continued singing paeans of praise, his enthusiasm and exuberance gave me a better idea of what we had accomplished. We had reached out to people all over the country and given them a symbol. In a country riddled with strife and random acts of violence, we had served as a sign of hope, a sign of the good things the people of our country are capable of as well. Each of us, who had given up vacation days, work hours or whatever, each of us plain, ordinary people had shown how together we can rise above the ordinary, and exert an influence together, that none of us has alone.\n\nYes, it was hard to sit and do not much of anything. And yet, although I may feel that we didn't actively DO much, I think that manhigut Yesha was brilliant. Because while we didn't Do much, much was DONE. In a country riddled with violence, we were able to prove that even huge crowds of determined people can sit peacefully and LOVINGLY with the forces opposing them. I think we have to remember that along with everything else, if we keep in mind that \"sinat chinam\" (rampant hatred of our fellow Jew) is what brought about the destruction of the Beit HaMikdash (Temple) and avat chinam (widespread love of our fellow Jew) is what will bring about the building of the next Beit HaMikdash, then Yesha's leadership which had us working 3 days on spreading Ahavat chinam was a brilliant idea! We spent 3 days showering the soldiers and police surrounding us with songs, candies, ice cubes in the heat, showering them with love. These are the same soldiers that will be used in the disengagement, should we ever come to that. Do you think that they'll be acting the same way after this experience? Many people who hadn't started out thinking on our wavelength began changing their minds because of what happened this week? Oy li, all these people who think that things have to happen instantly. Sometimes, if not most times, the most important things take time and patience. That's the way it is sometimes in building a country, and in saving a country! Chazak v'Amatz. And I for one with such levelheaded leadership, am waiting to return next time I get the call as well!\n\nIsrael National News Item > IDF Changing Military Police Vests - Because of the Orange 08:05 Jul 20, '05 / 13 Tammuz 5765\n\n(IsraelNN.com) The Office of the IDF Spokesperson has confirmed reports that new reflective vests have been ordered for IDF military police to replace the orange reflective vests worn today.\n\nThe several hundred military police brought to Kfar Maimon and Gaza areas were instructed not to use their orange reflective vests, the color that identifies with the Gush Katif solidarity movement.

This is an unprecedented number of joint forces against civilians in Israel. In most of the police stations in the southern district, there are few policemen now since they have all been sent to Kfar Maimon.\n\nNew forces are on the way to replace those there now in order to allow them to rest before continuing their struggle with the marchers. Spokesmen from the Yesha Council including the head of the council, Bentzy Lieberman, insist that the march is to be nonviolent with no clashes with the police.\n\nHowever, some Border Policemen have revealed that they were instructed to use their clubs freely.\n\nThe huge number of policemen and soldiers on the scene is unprecedented in Israeli history.

General Yaakov Ganot, said that if there is a need for even more places, then 900 security prisoners will be moved into army prisons.\n\nIn addition, while the Jewish residents of Gush Katif are being expelled from their homes, the Immigration Police will not be dealing with illegal residents in Israel. So the places that are normally occupied by them while waiting for expulsion from Israel will be free to use to home anti-Disengagement prisoners, too.\n\n================================\n\nIsrael National News Item > Imposters Sending Gush Katif Supporters Away 11:35 Jul 20, '05 / 13 Tammuz 5765\n\n(IsraelNN.com) The Judea, Samaria and Gaza Council has been given information indicating that imposters pretending to be representatives of the Council are directing Gush Katif supporters making their way to Kfar Maimon to return home. The imposters are apparently taking up positions at the main intersections on the way to Kfar Maimon, where the anti-Disengagement protest marchers have spent the last day, and are identifying themselves as Judea, Samaria and Gaza Council representatives, telling people on the way to the southern village to stay away.\n\nJudea, Samaria and Gaza Council representatives in Kfar Maimon said, \"It is clear that they are imposters attempting to mislead the public.\" The Council leaders repeated their call for more supporters to arrive in Kfar Maimon for the planned continuation of the march to Gaza.\n\n==============================\n\nIsrael National News Item > Peres: Gush Katif Hothouses to be Sold to US 15:55 Jul 20, '05 / 13 Tammuz 5765\n\n(IsraelNN.com) According to statements by Vice Prime Minister Shimon Peres, the United States has agreed to pay four million dollars for Israeli hothouses in Gush Katif, with the hothouses then turned over to the Palestinian Authority. An agreement to that effect has been signed between representatives of the US and lawyers for certain Gush Katif farmers. The total value of area hothouses is placed at $15 million, but officials believe not all Gush Katif farmers will be interested in taking part in the current deal.\n\nMinister Peres also said that the US has agreed to help the Arab farmers who would take over the hothouses to sell their produce internationally. Yonatan Bassi, head of the Disengagement Authority, said that trade agreements and regulations will protect Israeli produce even after the Arab farmers take over the Israeli hothouses.\n\nLast month, it was reported that Holland was willing to purchase the hothouses in the same manner on behalf of the PA. Proponents of the plan explained at the time that this would provide compensation for the farmers as well as a positive step for the PA, adding everyone emerges a winner.\n\n==========================\n\nIsrael National News Item > Peres: Security Forces Are Defending Democracy 10:59 Jul 20, '05 / 13 Tammuz 5765\n\n(IsraelNN.com) Vice Premier (Labor) Shimon Peres told members of the Ministerial Disengagement Committee Wednesday morning that \"security forces are defending our democratic values\".\n\nMr. Peres added, \"The settlers are attempting to lead us to anarchy and as such, they are endangering the laws and legal structure on which the State of Israel relies.\"\n\nPeres called \"on the entire nation to condemn the path they have chosen, those who benefited from IDF protection, who must now surrender and retreat to their homes.\"\n\n=====================================\n\nIsrael National News Item > Labor Minister Quote of the Day: By Hillel Fendel\n\n\"... To dismantle?! To go backwards?! Who can take responsibility for such a thing?!\" - Interior Minister Ophir Pines of Labor in the Knesset today (Wednesday, July 20, 2005)\n\nPines was not referring to the dismantling of the Jewish communities in Gaza or in the northern Shomron, but rather to the unification of four Arab villages into one municipality. Pines, who assumed the post of Interior Minister almost two years after the unification was implemented, said he would not have united the towns in the first place. But, he said, he would certainly not dismantle the union or \"go backwards\" now that it is an established fact. \"I think we must go forward,\" he said.\n\n=================================\n\nIsrael National News Item > MK Ariel: The Decision to Remove Ambulances is Black Flag Ruling 19:43 Jul 20, '05 / 13 Tammuz 5765\n\n(IsraelNN.com) In reaction to the Major General Dan Harel, Commander of the Southern Region's decision to remove all the ambulances from Kfar Maimon, MK Uri Ariel from the National Union Party called to the Minister of Health, Danny Neve, and to Dan Halutz, Chief of Staff, to immediately stop Maj.Gen. Harel and the way he is conducting himself.\n\n\"The Commander of the Southern Region has no authority to make such rulings. This is an illegal instruction which has a black flag attached to it. He is making human life worthless. It's clear that Sharon is pulling the strings from behind and turning the commander into the bad man.\"\n\nMaj. Gen. Harel notified Magen David Adom that they should remove the ambulances from the area because it isn't clear who is to pay for their services. Any medical aid needed can be supplied by the army and police in the area.\n\n===============\n\nNews Item > Gush Katif: Life Continues in Upbeat Manner By Hillel Fendel\n\nLess than four weeks before the scheduled date of the expulsion from Gush Katif, the atmosphere there is tense but anticipatory. Hundreds of new residents have moved in over the past two weeks.\n\nArmy sources estimated earlier this week that 1,000 people had moved in to Gush Katif over the previous two weeks. The new residents are living in tent sites, people's homes, and in public buildings.\n\nOne woman who has moved in to a home in Netzer Hazani with her three children told Arutz-7, \"The owners simply moved their children into one room, and we are living in another room. A third family, two parents and a child, have moved into a third bedroom - and we all get along fine. We chip in for expenses such as food and the like. Our hostess spends her time looking for equipment that can be used for the new families, and then, when enough equipment has been emptied out of a storeroom, she suggests that a family be moved in the now-empty place...\"\n\nIn the beachfront community of Shirat HaYam (Song of the Sea), construction has stopped - but not for lack of demand. \"We are now 25 families,\" says spokesperson Chana Pekar, \"and all the new [11-square-meter] wood-frame structures that we just built are full. We can't build any more at present, simply because we would need a new kitchen-and-bathrooms facility, which we don't have. But I can tell you that we have a new atmosphere here in the community - because all the new young families have come with children of all ages, and there are day camps, and youths helping out everywhere, and a real community-type feeling. Just a year ago, we had to worry about having ten men for a prayer quorum - and now, the synagogue is exploding at the seams.\"\n\nPekar said that the siege in Kfar Maimon is \"the government's attempt to break us first there, and then here. But we won't break neither here nor there. Buses will be leaving from Gush Katif for Kfar Maimon later this afternoon, and I'll be on one of them - and I won't show my identity card neither going nor coming.\"\n\nQ. \"What, have they started asking for ID cards on the way out as well?\" A. \"Yes, and they're even registering every car and person who leaves. I suppose it's just another way of trying to break us and humiliate us. But they won't succeed.\"\n\nRocket bombardments continue as well. Palestinian terrorists in Gaza fired four shells at Gush Katif residents last night, hurting no one and causing no damage. Arabs also fired at an army outpost in N'vei Dekalim, with no effect.\n\nOnce they leave the \"safety\" of their own homes, the Gush Katif residents continue to be persecuted on their way out as well. Yesterday, a busload of Kfar Darom children returning from a day trip was detained at the Kisufim Crossing for two hours - and their driver was placed under house arrest for five days. The story began when a policewoman boarded the bus and demanded that the children identify themselves in order that they be permitted to enter. The policewoman then began an argument with the driver, after which she reported to her supervisor that he had \"insulted\" her.\n\nThe police ordered the driver off the bus. He later reported that though many of the policemen knew him well, and had drunk many cups of coffee in his home when he served as security officer of Kfar Darom, \"all of a sudden, no one knew me any more.\" While the children waited in the hot sun - a correspondent on the scene helped one of the children with a drink and his air-conditioned vehicle - the questioning dragged on for two hours. The driver was finally released with an order confining him to his home for five days.\n\n=============\n\nNews Item > Veteran Expulsion Prisoner Released, Another is in for 3 Months By Hillel Fendel\n\nA grandfather has been freed after 64 days in prison, while a rabbi has been sentenced to three months in jail.\n\nEliyahu Herbst - father of six and grandfather of two - has been freed from prison, after spending over nine weeks in prison on charges of an anti-disengagement road-blocking. He was ordered released on Tuesday after a judge ruled that no evidence was found that he violated the law.\n\nHerbst could have been released earlier with various restrictions such as a ban on attending demonstrations. He refused to accept such limitations, however, claiming that he must not be punished for exercising his moral right to protest democratically.\n\nThough he served as \"elder statesman\" of the many youths arrested for road-blocking, he suffered greatly during his incarceration. On the way to his Supreme Court hearing earlier this month, a policeman brutally pulled Herbst out of the car by his handcuffs, causing him to fall on the ground, and he was then dragged on the ground by his handcuffs until he was thrown into another car. He was then placed in solitary confinement without his belongings or a change of clothes, suffering humiliation in the process.\n\nYesterday, the Supreme Court ordered him released without bail and without restrictions.\n\nAnother case has not ended as happily, however. Rabbi Rachamim Nissimi of Nof Ayalon was sentenced yesterday to three months in prison for his role in blocking a highway near Modiin in the framework of the anti-expulsion protests. MK Aryeh Eldad called the verdict \"the burial of Israel 's democracy.\"\n\nRabbi Nissimi was arrested three weeks ago and was charged with attacking a policeman, illegal assembly and resisting arrest. In a precedent-setting decision, he was sentenced to three months in prison, as well as six additional months of probation.\n\nHis daughter Yael told Arutz-7 today, \"My father did nothing to justify such a punishment. He arrived at the Shilat Junction merely to give out orange ribbons. Some people there wanted to block the road, but they didn't succeed, because of all the policemen there - and he certainly didn't block the road. Suddenly, some policemen jumped on him without warning and with terrible brutality; we have pictures showing this. The only proof that they have that he attacked a policeman is some policemen who simply framed him; there's no other word.\"\n\nYael said that the family soon realized that there was no choice but to agree to a plea-bargain, in light of the government's strong stand: \"Sharon wants to carry out the disengagement with as few as possible opponents, and we realized that the prosecution would never agree to relax the charges... They were very tough; at first they wanted seven months in prison, but finally they agreed to three months... He was in the Disengagement Wing of Massiyahu Prison, which he said was very positive, but now he will be in the Criminal Wing...\"\n\nHonenu, the civil rights organization providing legal aid to those arrested in connection with anti-expulsion activities, estimates that there are currently several dozen youths still in prison in this connection.\n\nFearing \"disengagement,\" many Israelis correctly recognize Prime Minister Sharon's surrender policies in Gaza and Samaria as the perilous beginnings of a Palestinian state. Not surprisingly, these conscious and conscientious citizens are now joining together in necessary opposition to such policies. Soon this opposition will likely take the very palpable form of increasingly widespread civil disobedience and related military refusals to participate in Jewish expulsions.\n\nAlthough the Prime Minister can be expected to denounce such forms of internal opposition, and although it would be best for all Israelis to \"simply\" cooperate against incremental Jewish surrenders to sworn Arab enemies, there are times when civil disobedience is the only reasonable option. Incontestably, civil disobedience does have a long tradition in law and democratic theory. And the roots of this honored tradition even lie plainly in Higher Law, which is in turn derived from Jewish Law.\n\nFrom its very beginnings, Jewish law has been viewed as an expression of G_d's will. Biblically, the law is referred to as the \"word of G-d,\" never of humankind. Hashem is the sole authentic legislator, and righteousness lies in observance of His law. The absence of righteousness places at risk the lives and well-being of both the individual and the entire community.\n\nFor ancient Israel, law was always the revealed will of G-d. All transgressions of the law were consequently offenses against The Almighty. The idea that human legislators might make law independently of G-d's will would have been incomprehensible. Indeed, as G-d was the only legislator, the sole function of human authorities was to discover the law and to ensure its proper application. According to Talmud: \"Whatever a competent scholar will yet derive from the Law, that was already given to Moses on Mount Sinai.\"[1]\n\nIn the Jewish tradition, the principle of a Higher Law is not only well-established; it is the very foundation of all legal order. Wherever the law of the state stands in marked contrast to this principle, it is null and void. In certain circumstances, such contrast positively mandates opposition to the law of the state. Here, \"civil disobedience\" is not only lawful, but indispensably law-enforcing.\n\nWhat sorts of circumstances are we describing? Above all others, they are conditions that place at existential risk the very survival of the state. In such prospectively dire circumstances, which were in fact already identified almost ten years ago in an Halachic Opinion issued by Prominent Rabbis in Eretz Yisroel Concerning Territorial Compromise,[2] the matter is one of Pikuach Nefesh. Consequently, it demands apt forms of Jewish resistance.\n\nIsrael cannot long endure spiritually or strategically without all the heartlands of Judea and Samaria. Sharon's \"disengagement\" begins with Gaza, but it also points a knife at the heart of other \"disposable\" territories. As the Torah is a \"Toras Chaim,\" a Torah of life, Jewish authorities in the State of Israel are \"forbidden, under any circumstance,\" to transfer Jewish land to Arab authorities. Ironically, this was recognized long ago by David Ben-Gurion in his speech to the 21st Zionist Congress in Basel in 1937:\n\nNo Jew has the right to relinquish the rights of the Jewish Nation in the Land of Israel. No Jew has the authority to do so. No Jewish body has such authority. Even the whole Jewish People - alive today - has no authority to relinquish any part whatsoever of the Land. This is the right of the Jewish Nation in all its generations, a right which may not be forfeited under any condition. Even if there would be, at some time, those who would announce that they give up this right, they have neither the power nor the authority to deprive future generations of this right. The Jewish Nation is neither obligated nor bound by any such relinquishment. Our right to this Land - to this entire Land - is valid and enduring forever, and until the full and complete redemption is carried out, we shall not budge from this historic right.\n\nIsraeli strategy and Jewish spirituality are meaningfully interpenetrating and interdependent. One cannot be separated purposefully from the other. The writer Hillel Halkin, fearing that the state of the Jews might one day be ruled by \"Hebrew-speaking Gentiles\" (a fear that was already widespread among such American Zionist as Maurice Samuel and Ludwig Lewisohn) once wrote: \"I do not believe that a polity of Israelis who are not culturally Jews, whose roots in this land go no deeper than thirty years and no wider than the boundaries of an arid nation-state, has a future in the Middle East for very long. In one way or another...it will be blown away like chaff as though it never were, leaving neither Jews nor Israelis behind it.\"[3] In a more recent essay the same writer observed that the hatred for Judaism of a very large portion of Israeli intellectuals, including those who now create a theoretical legitimacy for Sharon government \"disengagement\" policies, has become a hatred of Zionism.[4]\n\nHalkin's fears remain well-founded. Especially under the Rabin and Peres governments, Israel hastened its transformation not only into a polity that is more and more detached from cultural Judaism, but into one that even undermines both Judaism and Zionism. With the subsequent election of Ehud Barak, this transformation had essentially been completed. Indeed, with the election of Barak, tens of thousands of Israelis were openly delighted that Israel had now seemingly become a \"normal\" (i.e., secular) nation.\n\nEverywhere the right of sovereignty rests upon the assurance of protection. Where a state can no longer offer such assurance - indeed, where it deliberately surrenders such assurance - the critical basis of citizen obligation must disappear. \"The obligation of subjects to the sovereign,\" said the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes in the seventeenth century, \"is understood to last as long, and no longer, than the power lasteth by which he is able to protect them.\"\n\nCan the Sharon government protect Israel's citizens? Clearly, \"disengagement\" will open the door widely to \"Palestine.\" In consequence, once deprived of its remaining strategic depth, Israel will become an irresistibly tempting object for aggression by certain enemy states. In view of what is already known about enemy state nuclearization, and about ballistic missile developments in these states - especially Iran, Syria and Egypt - multi-state aggression could even come to Israel as an unconventional war. Here the predictable end result of \"disengagement\" would come in the form of chemical, biological and/or nuclear attack.\n\nIt is with these grave dangers in mind that Israeli opponents of Sharon's \"disengagement\" will soon accelerate civil and military disobedience. Recognizing that victimization by words[5] can set the stage for subsequent victimization by force, they shall soon seek, perhaps desperately, to \"stop the machine\" while there is still time. They will be acting correctly.\n\nTo \"stop the machine!\" This telling phrase is taken directly from Thoreau's classical explorations of civil disobedience. In his famous essay on the subject, the American transcendentalist spoke persuasively of such opposition as an act of \"counter friction.\" Confronted with dreadful harms of the sort now suffered and anticipated by so many Israelis, harms generated by the Oslo/\"Road Map\" Peace Process and soon-to-be magnified substantially by Sharon's \"disengagement,\" Thoreau would urge, as he once did about policy deformations in this country: \"Let your life be a counter-friction to stop the machine. What I have to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to the wrong which I condemn.\"\n\nThis is precisely what Israel's protestors MUST now seek, not to lend themselves to the insupportable risks of the Rabin/Peres/Netanyahu/Barak/Sharon agreements with the PLO. Among these wrongs are the Israeli government's sustained legitimization of a terrorist organization and its corollary unwillingness or incapacity to adequately punish terrorist crimes. Repeatedly, for example, the Sharon government has freed large numbers of Arab terrorists and has even offered amnesties to other terrorists not yet captured.\n\nThe underlying rationale of such illegal behavior is, ironically, a cessation of Palestinian terror. Naturally, the net effect will be exactly the opposite, not only because of the release and revitalization of many criminals, but also because this action may sustain the asymmetrical \"Peace Process,\" and thereby the creation of \"Palestine.\" Once a Palestinian state is actually born, it will inevitably become a permanent staging area for new waves of anti-Israel and anti-American terror.\n\nIsrael's agreements with the Palestinian Authority/PLO contravene the binding obligation to punish acts that are crimes under international law. Known formally as Nullum crimen sine poena, \"No crime without a punishment,\" this requirement points unambiguously to the multiple acts of killing and torture ordered directly by Palestinian leaders over these many years of barbarous Arab terror. To not only ignore this requirement, but to legitimize the criminality by making Arafat successor Mahmoud Abbas a \"partner\" in the Oslo/\"Road Map\" agreements, is a clear violation of the Nuremberg Principles.[6]\n\nThe meaning is manifest. Israel's citizens who now support and sustain the \"disengagement\" policies are in violation of international law (and therefore of Israel's national law as well, which necessarily incorporates international law), while those who oppose these policies within the proper bounds of civil disobedience and military resistance are acting in support of both forms of law.\n\nThese informed views of law and civil disobedience in Israel, however disturbing they may seem, warrant a much broader public understanding. Now embarked upon policies that threaten Israel's very existence while they simultaneously undermine authoritative expectations of justice, the Sharon government should fully expect to be confronted with mounting protests and with correlative military refusals. Were it not so confronted, citizens of that beleaguered state would have already consented to their own national dismemberment. As even David Ben-Gurion understood, they have no right to give such consent - none at all.\n\nInternational law, which is based upon a variety of higher law foundations, including Jewish Law, forms part of the law of all nations. This is the case whether or not the incorporation of international law into national law is codified, explicitly, as it is in the Supremacy Clause (Article VI) of the United States Constitution. The government of Israel is bound by settled norms of international law concerning punishment of terrorist crimes and physical survival of the state. Where this government fails to abide by these rules, as is very much the case today, civil and military disobedience is not only permissible, it is required.\n\nWe began with a look at the Jewish Law bases of Higher Law[7] and civil disobedience. Jewish law rests always upon two principles: the overriding sovereignty of G-d and the derivative sacredness of the individual person. Both principles, intertwined and interdependent, underlie the reasoned argument for civil disobedience in Israel.[8] From the sacredness of the person, which stems from each individual's resemblance to divinity, flows the freedom to choose. The failure to exercise this freedom, which is evident wherever a response to political authority is merely automatic, represents a betrayal of individual legal responsibility.[9]\n\nFor Jews, our human freedom cannot be properly detached from our human reason. The particular relevance of reason to judgment - including legal judgment - was altogether central in ancient Israel. Indeed, reason is distinctly accommodated within the Jewish concept of revealed law. In essence, the Jewish idea of law offers a transcending order revealed by the Divine word as interpreted by human reason. Consider Ecclesiasticus 32.23; 37.16; 13-14: \"Let reason go before every enterprise and counsel before any action....And let the counsel of thine own heart stand....For a man's mind is sometimes wont to tell him more than seven watchmen that sit above in an high tower....\" From this unassailable Jewish standpoint, it should not be difficult to determine what reason suggests to us about \"disengagement.\"\n\nWe must also be reminded that Jewish law is democratic in the sense that it belongs to all of the people, a principle reflected in the Talmudic position that each individual can approach G-d in prayer without priestly intercessions. Hence, a fundamental goal of law must always be to encourage initiative, to act meaningfully on behalf of improving"
