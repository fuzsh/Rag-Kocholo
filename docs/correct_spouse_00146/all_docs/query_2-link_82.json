        "text": "This woman is not writing about Israel or Israeli \"abuses\" as she knows nothing about what life in Israel is like and has never met an Israeli. But, the \"human rights\" organizations who constantly condemn Israel for every conceivable -- and inconceivable -- crime don't find these barbaric practices among the Israelis! Those \"peaceworkers\" are obviously so busy making their reports of \"Israeli atrocities\" (which never have any evidence to back them up) that they can't be bothered to take care of genuine victims of horrible abuse -- \"Palestinian\" women and girls who live under the Palestinian Authority. This is what life is like for thousands of \"Palestinian\" women and girls.\n\nThere is a lot written lately about the barbaric practice of using children as \"suicide\" bombers and how that is child abuse and I agree with that assessment. But, why haven't I read anything about this form of abuse that is carried out under the sanction of Islamic law? Why do people all over the world support giving these barbarians, AKA \"Palestinians\", their own state? Even more importantly, why do some ISRAELIS -- like Sharon and Peres -- advocate forming \"Palestine\" out of Israel's land for these people who don't value life and don't build the land? Take a good look at the type of people that the \"Palestinians\" are and remember that having their own country will not change them into humane, democratic people. If Sharon's nefarious plans go through, Gaza will change from thriving neighborhoods of Israelis to a massive camp of \"Palestinians\", eager to go and conquer the world!\n\nAs a teenager in the West Bank, Soauad became pregnant by a local boy. Her 'shamed' Palestinian family condemned her to death and she was set on fire by her brother-in-law. Every year, thousands of women in the Middle East die in 'honour killings'. Souad survived. She was rescued by the Swiss charity SURGIR (Arise). You can send donations to Banque cantonale vaudoise, 1001 Lausanne, account number U 5060.57.74 or to the address on the www.surgir.ch website.\n\nThis article was edited from \"Burned Alive\" by Souad (Bantam), published on May 1.

It appeared April 26, 2004 in the Telegraph in Great Britain and is archived at http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml= %2Farts%2F2004%2F04%2F26%2Fftburn26.xml\n\nHe came towards me and said, with a smile: \"Hi. How goes it?\" He was chewing a blade of grass. \"I'm going to take care of you.\"\n\nI hadn't been expecting that. I smiled a little, to thank him, not daring to speak.\n\nSuddenly I felt a cold liquid running over my head; I was on fire. I slapped at my hair. I screamed. My dress billowed out behind me. Was it on fire, too? I smelt the petrol and ran, the hem of my dress getting in the way. Did he run after me? Was he waiting for me to fall so he could watch me go up in flames?\n\nI'm going to die, I thought. That's good. Maybe I'm already dead. It's over, finally.\n\nMy name is Souad. My story began almost 25 years ago in my native village in the West Bank, a tiny place, in a region then occupied by the Israelis. If I named my village, I could be in danger, even though I am now thousands of miles away. In my village I am officially dead; if I were to go back today they would try to kill me a second time for the honour of my family. It's the law of the land. It's because I am a woman.\n\nA woman must walk fast, head down, as if counting the number of steps she's taking. She may never stray from her path or look up, for if a man catches her eye, the whole village labels her a charmuta, prostitute. A girl must be married before she can raise her eyes and look straight ahead, or go into a shop, or pluck her eyebrows and wear jewellery. My mother was married at 14. If a girl is still unmarried by that age, the village begins to make fun of her. But a girl must wait her turn in the family to be married. The eldest daughter first, then the others.\n\nThere were four girls of marrying age in our household. There were also two half-sisters, by our father's second wife, who were still children. The one male child of the family, who was born in glory among all these daughters, was our brother Assad.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, I spoke only Arabic; I'd hardly been further than a few kilometres beyond the last house on the dirt road. I knew there were cities further away but I had never seen them. I did not know if the earth was round or flat. What I did know was that we had to hate the Jews, who had taken our land; my father called them halouf, pigs. We were forbidden to go near them for fear of becoming pigs like them.\n\nMy brother went to school, but the girls did not. Where I come from, being born a girl is a curse: a wife must first produce a son - at least one - and if she gives birth only to girls, she is mocked. At most, only two or three girls are needed to help with the housework, to work on the land and tend the animals.\n\nOur stone house was big, and surrounded by a wall with a large door of grey iron. Once we were inside, it closed on us to prevent us going out. You could enter by this door from the outside, but you could not go out again. My father and mother went out, but not us girls. My brother went out and came back through that door; he went to the cinema - he did as he liked.\n\nA day without a beating was unusual. My father would shout, \"Why have the sheep come back by themselves?\" then pull me by the hair and drag me into the kitchen to hit me. Once he tied up my sister Kainat and me, our hands behind our backs, our legs bound, and a scarf over our mouths to stop us screaming. We stayed like that all night, tied to a gate in the stable.\n\nThis was life in our village. The girls and women in the other houses were beaten regularly, too. You could hear the crying. My sister was beaten by her husband and she brought shame on our family when she came home to complain.\n\nMy mother had 14 children, but only five survived. One day I learned why. I must have been less than 10; Noura, my elder sister, was with me. We came back from the fields, and found my mother lying on the floor on a sheepskin. She was giving birth, and my aunt Salima was with her. There were cries from my mother and then from the baby. Very quickly my mother took the sheepskin and smothered the baby. I saw the baby move once, and then it was over. She was a girl. I saw my mother do it this first time, then a second time. I'm not sure I was present for the third, but I knew about it. And I heard Noura say to her: \"If I have girls, I'll do what you have done.\"\n\nThat was how my mother got rid of the seven daughters she had after Hanan, the last survivor. From then on I hid and cried every time my father killed a sheep or a chicken.\n\nAs long as I lived with my parents, I feared I would die suddenly. I was afraid of going up a ladder when my father was below. I was afraid of the hatchet used for chopping the wood, afraid of the well when I went for water. That well was my greatest terror, and my mother's too. I sensed it. Sometimes, coming back from the fields with the animals, my elder sister Kainat and I talked about what might happen: \"Supposing everybody's dead when we get home . . . And what if Father has killed Mother? A blow with a stone is all it would take!\"\n\nThe possibility of our mother dying preoccupied us more than the death of a sister, because there were always other sisters. Our mother was often beaten, just as we were. Sometimes she tried to intervene when my father hit us especially viciously, and then he'd turn on her, knocking her down and pulling out her hair.\n\nI haven't seen my brother Assad for 25 years, but I would like to ask him one question: \"Where is our sister Hanan, who disappeared?\" Hanan was a beautiful girl, very dark and prettier than me, with thick hair and heavy eyebrows that joined above her eyes. She was not thin like me. She was dreamy and never very attentive to what was said to her. When she came to help us pick olives, she worked and moved slowly. This wasn't usual in my family; you walked fast, you worked fast, you ran out to bring the animals.\n\nI was in the house one day when I heard shouting. My little sisters and I ran to see what was happening. Hanan was sitting on the floor, arms and legs flailing, and Assad was leaning over her, strangling her with the telephone cord. We pressed ourselves against the wall to make ourselves disappear. Assad must have heard us come in because he yelled \"Rouhi! Rouhi! Get out! Get out!\"\n\nWhen my parents came home, my mother spoke to Assad. I saw her crying, but I know now she was just pretending: I've come to understand how things happen to girls in my land. It is decided at a family meeting, and on the fatal day the parents are never present. Only the one who has been chosen to do the killing is with the intended victim.\n\nI don't know why Hanan was condemned to die. Did she go out alone? Was she seen speaking to a man? Was she denounced by a neighbour? It doesn't take much for everyone to see a girl as a charmuta who has brought shame to the family and must die to restore their honour - as well as that of the entire village.\n\nAs I grew up, I waited hopefully for a marriage proposal. I was 18 by then and had grown to hate village weddings because all the girls made fun of me. No one asked for Kainat, my elder sister; she had resigned herself to remaining an old maid. I found this terribly depressing, because I had to wait until Kainat was married before I could take a husband.\n\nThen I discovered that a neighbour, Faiez, had asked for me. \"But we can't discuss marriage for the time being,\" my mother told me, \"we have to wait for your sister.\"\n\nFaiez lived in the house opposite ours. Sometimes I caught sight of him from the terrace where I laid out the laundry to dry. He must have had a good job in the city because he didn't dress like a labourer. He always wore a suit, and he carried a briefcase and he had a car.\n\nI imagined that we were married, that he'd come back from work at sunset and I'd remove his shoes and, on my knees, I'd wash his feet as my mother did for my father. I would be a woman with a husband! Maybe I'd even be able to put on make-up, get into his car with him, and go into town to the shops.\n\nBut what to do? I wanted him to know that I was waiting, too. I decided to do everything I could to speak to him, at the risk of being beaten or stoned to death. One morning I heard his footsteps on the gravel outside his house. I shook my wool rug over the edge of the terrace and he looked up. He saw me and I knew he understood, although he made no sign and not a word was spoken.\n\nThere were regular, secret meetings. One day he placed his hand on my thigh. I pushed it off. He looked annoyed. \"Why don't you want to? Come on!\" I was so afraid that he'd go away, that he'd look for somebody else. So I let him do what he wanted - without quite knowing what was going to happen to me. He wasn't violent, but the pain took me by surprise. He told me he was in love with me.\n\nOne morning, in the stable, I suddenly felt very strange. The smell of the manure made me dizzy. And later, as I prepared the meal, the mutton made me feel ill. I tried to find a reason that wasn't the worst one. Of course, I couldn't talk to anyone. If I was pregnant, my father would smother me in the sheepskin blanket.\n\nWhen I told Faiez, his face went blank. He promised to talk to my father. He said I should wait - \"Until I give you a sign.\" The days passed, and he gave me no sign. I was hopeful all the same, every evening, of seeing him appear out of nowhere, as he had before, to the left or right of the ravine where I hid.\n\nThree or four months later, my stomach began to get larger. It was my father who came towards me, on a washing day, his cane striking the ground of the courtyard. He stopped behind me. \"You're pregnant,\" he said. I dropped the laundry into the basin. I couldn't look up at him. \"No, father,\" I insisted. Later, I pleaded with my mother, assuring her that I had had my period.\n\nThere was a family meeting, which of course I wasn't allowed to attend: my parents, Noura and my brother-in-law Hussein. I listened behind the wall, terrified.\n\nMy mother spoke to Hussein: \"We can't ask our son. He won't be able to do it - he's too young.\"\n\n\"I can take care of her.\"\n\nThen my father: \"If you're going to do it, it must be done right. What do you have in mind?\"\n\n\"Don't worry about it. I'll find a way.\"\n\nI heard my sister crying, saying she didn't want to hear this and that she wanted to go home. Hussein told her to wait, then confirmed arrangements with my parents: \"You'll go out. Leave the house. When you come back, it will be done.\"\n\nI couldn't comprehend what I had heard. I wondered if it could have been a dream, a nightmare. Were they really going to kill me? And if they did, when would it be? How? By cutting off my head? Maybe they would let me have the child then kill me afterwards? Would they keep the baby if it was a boy? Would my mother suffocate it if it was a girl?\n\nThe next day my mother told me that she was going to the city with my father. I knew what it meant. I looked at the courtyard ; it was a big space, part of it was tiled, the rest covered with sand. It was encircled by a wall, and all around on top of the wall were iron spikes. In one corner, the metallic grey door, smooth on the courtyard side, without a lock or key, and only a handle on the outside. If he came, he could only enter by that door.\n\nSuddenly I heard it clang. My brother-in-law was there, he was coming towards me. He was smiling.\n\nTwenty-five years later I see these images again as if time has stopped. I was sitting on a rock, barefoot in a grey dress. I had lowered my head, unable to look at him; my forehead was on my knees. Then suddenly I was running and on fire and screaming. There were women, I remember, two of them, so I must have climbed over the garden wall and into the street. They beat at me, I suppose with their scarves. They dragged me to the village fountain; I felt the cold water running on me and I cried out with pain because it burnt me too. I heard women wailing over me. \"The poor thing . . . The poor thing . . .\" I was lying in a car. I felt the jolts of the road. I heard myself moan.\n\nLater, on a hospital bed, I was curled up in a ball under a sheet. A nurse had come to tear off my dress. She pulled roughly on the fabric and the pain jolted me. I slept, my head still stuck to my chest, as it was when I was on fire. My arms were extended out from my body and both were paralysed. My hands were still there, but I couldn't use them. I wanted to scratch myself, to rip off my skin to stop the pain.\n\nWhen I woke again I saw two bare feet, a long black dress, a small form like mine, thin, almost skinny. It wasn't the nurse. It was my mother. Her two plaits were smoothed with olive oil, her black scarf, that strange forehead, a bulge between her eyebrows over the nose, a profile like a bird of prey. She frightened me. She sat on a stool with her black bag and started to weep, her head rocking back and forth. She wept with shame, for herself and the whole family. And I saw the hatred in her eyes.\n\nNever will I forget that big glass she filled to the top with a transparent liquid, like water. \"Drink this. It's me who gives it to you.\"\n\nI was so thirsty I tried to raise my chin, but I couldn't. Suddenly a young doctor - one of the few members of staff who had treated me kindly - came into the room. My mother jumped. He grabbed the glass from her hand and banged it down on the windowsill. \"No!\" he shouted. He took my mother by the arm and made her leave the room. \"You're lucky I came in when I did,\" he told me when he returned. \"From now on no one from your family will be allowed in here.\"\n\nThree or four days later, I still hadn't eaten or drunk anything since being admitted to hospital. I knew they were letting me die because it was forbidden to intervene in a case like mine. I was guilty in everyone's eyes. I would endure the fate of all women who sully the honour of men. They had only washed me because I stank. They kept me there because it was a hospital where I was supposed to die without creating more problems for my parents and the village. Hussein had botched the job: he had let me run away in flames.\n\nOne night I felt a strange pain, like a knife stuck into my stomach. I could feel something strange between my legs. I didn't realise, at first, that I was giving birth. The doctor heard my cries and came into the room. He leant over and took the baby away, without showing it to me.\n\nLater he told me that I had given birth at six months to a tiny boy, but that he was alive and being cared for. I heard vaguely what he was saying to me, but my ears had been burned and hurt so terribly.\n\nSomeone came into the room once, in the middle of this nightmare. A hand passed over my face without touching it. A woman's voice, with a peculiar accent, said to me in Arabic: \"I'm going to help you, do you understand?\" I said yes, without believing it. I was so uncomfortable in that bed, the object of everyone's scorn; I didn't understand how anyone could help me. But I said yes to that woman. I didn't know who she was.\n\nMy second life began in Europe at the end of the 1970s in an international airport. Concealed behind a curtain, my body smelt so much that the passengers on the plane taking me to Europe protested.\n\nBut next to me, in a cradle, was my son Marouan. I gazed at his face, long and dark, under the hospital bonnet. He had been found in an orphanage, where the hospital had sent him because I was expected to die.\n\nThe woman, Jacqueline, a worker for a humanitarian organisation, had tracked him down. She had also persuaded my parents to sign me over to her, telling them that she was going to take me somewhere else to die. My father, I later learned, had made her promise that they would never see me again: \"NEVER AGAIN!\" They would tell the village that I had died, and their honour would be intact.\n\nJacqueline was taking me to the serious burns unit of a Swiss hospital. The day after we arrived I had an emergency operation, to free my chin from my chest and allow me to raise my head. For long months there were skin grafts, 24 operations in all. My legs, which hadn't been burned, provided replacement skin until there was none left to give.\n\nAt first, my arms hung stiffly at my sides, like a doll's, but eventually the medical staff straightened them so that I could move them. I began to stand, then walk in the corridors and to use my hands.\n\nI now live in Europe, where I am married to a good man, Antonio. We have two daughters. When Marouan was five, I signed a paper for his foster-parents to adopt him. We had lived together with this foster family for four years after our arrival; his parents were also mine. I still feel guilty for making this choice, but I knew he was happy, and he knew I was alive. I was 24 and I didn't feel I could stay any longer. I had to work, gain my independence and finally become an adult. I would not have been able to raise him alone.\n\nI am still Muslim, but I retain few of the customs of my village. I detest violence. If someone reproaches me for being critical of the Muslim religion I try to help them understand what they haven't understood before. My mother frequently quarrelled with our neighbours. She would throw stones at them or pull their hair. In our country, the women always go for the hair.\n\nMore than 6,000 \"honour\" crimes are committed every year - in the West Bank, Jordan, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, India and Pakistan. In Pakistan the custom is an accepted part of national culture. In Jordan, a man who has killed his wife in a state of rage is entitled to the judge's clemency; the same law applies to a man who kills his wife simply because he suspects her of adultery. It is increasingly common for \"disgraced\" families to hire bounty hunters, so women who manage to escape to other countries are forced into hiding.\n\nI have since met many of these women.

Bush distracted US reporters from the wordings' ambiguities crafted to appear to support Israel. People were further thrown off the scent by the Arabs' usual complaining. The Arabs complain to make themselves seem the aggrieved party and the underdogs. Their pose obscures how much they are getting, as if since the Arabs find the plan unsatisfactory, it must be unsatisfactory. Actually, the Arab demands are unsatisfactory. The Arabs deem themselves entitled to rule us lesser beings. They want all of Israel. Since the plan carries them only half way towards that goal, they complain. We get taken in by all this posturing, and fail to notice the lack of democracy in PM Sharon's releasing the plan suspiciously soon before the referendum on it, his refusal to debate on it, and his effort to prevent the Knesset from debating it. He is selling a pig in a poke. Most of us don't see that Sharon's method is a poke and don't figure out that the plan he put into it is a pig.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE PLAN\n\nPM Sharon released a summary of the plan but neither its details nor the side-letter to the US stating further concessions. Did he plan not to release them before the referendum on it by Likud Party members? In any event, they were leaked. (Each point in the summary that I excerpt from IMRA is followed by my parenthetical remarks.)\n\n1. Israel aspires to a \"peace process\" that establishes \"two states for two peoples,\" as part of Pres. Bush's vision.\"\n\n(For more than a decade of Oslo, Israel thought it had a peace process but got a terrorist war. Jihadists want conquest, not peace. Since they don't want peace, the last thing to give them is sovereignty, with its power to raise armies. Nor are the western Palestinian Arabs a separate people. The operating principle here seems to be, \"22 states for two peoples, with the 21 Arab states eventually to extinguish the one Jewish one.)\n\n2. Since Israel has no partner for agreement, \"Israel must act on its own,\" \"to emerge from this stagnation.\" (What does \"emerge\" mean? It is not defined.)\n\n3. The plan would improve Israel's long-term security. (How is not stated. Israel admits that terrorism would increase. How does an increase in terrorism improve security?)\n\n4. \"It is clear\" that part of Judea-Samaria will remain part of the State of Israel.\"\n\n(It isn't part of the State of Israel now. It is not clear that it would become so. Sharon's plan suggests it would be, but Bush's letter does not confirm it. Bush refers every point to final status negotiations. Since the Sharon plan defers unctuously to getting US permission for this and that, none of Judea-Samaria is likely to become part of Israel, at least not without a \"compensating\" concession. Israel is foolhardy in subordinating its national security to a State Dept. that objected to Israel's birth and has tried to whittle it down ever since.)\n\n5. Disengagement would \"reduce friction\" with Arab residents and improve their lives and economy.\n\n(Friction does not arise from contiguity but from jihad. The Arabs are waging jihad to destroy Israel. The proper defense against jihad is to weaken the Arab economic ability to wage jhad, so fewer will remain to wage it. Improving the P.A. economy and living conditions is counter-productive folly. Nor does anybody appreciate it. My fellow Jews delude themselves by supposing that by behaving nicely, they will be tolerated. How could antisemites appreciate Jews, no matter how they behave? The hatred is independent of how Jews behave, because it primarily is a gentile neurosis.)\n\n6. \"Israel hopes\" the P.A. would \"have the sense\" to stop violence and rejoin dialogue.\n\n(The P.A. violence is PM Sharon's excuse for withdrawing, as the P.A. wanted. From the Arab point of view, violence works. They have the sense NOT to stop it. What good is dialogue, when the Arab goal is the conquest of Israel? Why do supposedly intelligent Westerners overvalue shibboleths such as dialogue and evenhandedness?)\n\n7. This disengagement would end claims about Israeli responsibility for the Arabs in Gaza.\n\n(What claims, were not stated. Enemies of Israel, however, do not need a pretext for making claims against Israel, since they willingly lie about it. This supposed advantage of the Plan seems to be another instance of Jews harming their own national interest in order to prove their purity to gentiles. It is shameful behavior.)\n\n8. The existing agreements would continue to \"prevail.\"\n\n(Continue to prevail? The Arabs violate all their agreements' major provisions. If Sharon does not know that, he is a fool; if he does know it, he takes his Party members for fools.)\n\nTHE PLAN IN SEMI-DETAIL\n\n1. Evacuate Gaza, ending basis for claim that it is \"occupied territory.\"\n\n(It isn't occupied territory. Instead of evacuating from it to end the basis for a misconception, Israel should have explained the falsity of the claim. But if it gives this reason, then it implies that the claim is true. Therefore, the cry will go up that Israel should evacuate from all of Judea-Samaria, because that is \"occupied territory,\" too. Of course that cry will go up, since its false baying panics the government of supposedly staunch Ariel Sharon.)\n\n2. Evacuate part of Samaria, to give the Arabs territorial contiguity.\n\n(This is part of Israel's willingness to set up a P.A. state. Israel should have been annexing parts of Judea-Samaria so as to forestall P.A. statehood. Statehood would extinguish Israeli claims to that part of its homeland and establish an Arab right to an army. What do you think the P.A. would do with an army? Hint: the P.A. has no other purposes than jihad and graft.)\n\n3. Israel would improve transportation contiguity in the P.A. and facilitate economic improvement.\n\n(This provision would facilitate the movement and staying power of the P.A. terrorists.)\n\n4. Israel would continue to control land, sea, and air access to Gaza.\n\n(The Arabs are considering declaring independence. Who would deny it them, absent the Israeli army? When they get it, they would control access to Gaza.)\n\n5. Gaza would be demilitarized.\n\n(Says who? Is Sharon hinting at a thorough smashing of all the terrorist organizations? If done, Israel would have won the war there. Then it may as well reclaim that part of its homeland. Is Sharon offering the pipedream or lure of a supposed negotiated disarmament, which a decade of Oslo proved the Arabs would not honor?)\n\n6. Israel reserves the right of self-defense. That statement hints but does not state baldly that this includes sending security forces back into Gaza if necessary.\n\n(The US already has objected to the reservation. If Gaza becomes a sovereign Arab state, Israel could not send its forces back without that being considered an invasion. Given the world's bias, the UN is likely to bring sanctions against Israel, regardless of the justification of the invasion.)\n\n7. Israel may allow Egypt, Britain, the US, and Jordan to gear the P.A. forces up to fight terrorism.\n\n(The CIA already has provided such aid. The result was greater ability to detect Israeli agents in the P.A. and snipers murdering Israelis. The four countries mentioned all are enemies of Israel.)\n\n8. If conditions warrant, Israel would consider allowing a seaport and airport for Gaza, under suitable arrangements.\n\n(Under pressure, Israel makes defective arrangements. The ports would be set up to import heavy arms. If the Arabs gain sovereignty, Israel would have no voice in this matter.)\n\n9. Israel will turn over abandoned facilities intact but \"reserves for itself the right to ask for consideration of the economic assets.\"\n\n(Israel would ask; nobody would pay. Why should they, when Israel plans to turn over whole communities, anyway?)\n\n10. Israel would continue to supply electricity, water, gas, and fuel to the Arabs in the abandoned areas. Israel would continue to allow P.A. workers, trade, and payment of taxes to the P.A..\n\n(A rational plan would declare that since the whole P.A. is engaged in terrorism to drive the Jewish people out of all of its homeland, Israel would not devote any resources to the undeserving P.A., who consider murder \"honor\" and recreational.)\n\n11. \"Israel views very favorably continued activity of the international humanitarian organizations and those that deal with civil development.\"\n\n(The international organizations use the language of humanitarianism to mask propaganda attacks on Israel. Israel should block or counter their efforts.)\n\n12. Israel may give up the joint industrial zone it built, or consider one with Egypt and Gaza.\n\n(Israel has an unofficial joint trade zone with Egypt and Gaza -- the arms smuggling tunnels.)\n\n13. \"Israel expects broad international support for the disengagement move.\" This support is needed to persuade the P.A. to cease terrorism and start negotiating.\"\n\n(I would have predicted broad international hostility, but don't have to predict it. It has set in. There is one way to reduce that hostility. That way is if the US persuades the Arabs, as it is attempting to do, that the US is letting Israel disengage but not impose any conditions upon the Arabs.)\n\nFURTHER IMRA COMMENTS\n\nIsrael retain control over Gaza? Hardly. Pres. Bush answered Israel's letter proposing the Plan by referring to the Road Map. That means that the P.A. could get independence and therefore control over Gaza.\n\nIsrael retain other areas, which is Sharon's supposed purpose of making these concessions now? Questionable. A White House briefing called the retreat \"precedent.\" If Israel gets to keep its centers in Judea-Samaria on the basis of their having been established as Jewish population centers, then Israel would be pressed to cede Arab populations centers in and around Jerusalem or elsewhere. As Israel reduces security measures in order to benefit the Arab population of Judea-Samaria, the US would pressure Israel for more concessions.\n\nSend security forces back in, in self-defense? Not with US approval, without which Israel does not do much, these days (4/15). \"The US has rejected an Israeli request for the right to invade the Gaza Strip following a unilateral withdrawal,\" even if the P.A. uses Gaza as a launching site for terrorism. Bush only went as far as to mention Israel's \"right of self-defense,\" which is open to interpretation (IMRA, 4/16). Most Israeli means of defense have been widely criticized by agencies such as the State Dept. that are \"understanding\" of terrorists.\n\nA US official said that he US hopes that with help from Arab states, the P.A. would take responsibility to fight terrorism, as called for by the Map (IMRA, 4/16).\n\nThe Arab states define terrorism as Israeli defense from Arab attacks against Israeli civilians. Those states would not encourage the P.A. to fight real terrorism except briefly and for show.\n\nSharon's notion of making concessions in advance of negotiations is the most counter-productive means of bargaining with the Arabs. The Arabs would take what they are given without any feeling of obligation, because their jihad is based on their concept of having sole legitimacy.\n\nARUTZ-7 COMMENTS\n\nThe Bush-Sharon understanding amounts to an Israeli expulsion of thousands of Jewish residents from the communities they had established, in exchange for vague commitments and hopes (that are harmful to Israel and to peace or have been continually dashed by the Arabs). Among them are that the Arabs \"must\" stop terrorism and incitement, that borders \"should\" take into account Israel's population centers, that Arab \"refugees\" \"need not\" enter Israel, and that the goal is a \"viable and contiguous\" Arab state.\" Even a \"return\" to the P.A. would put demographic pressure on Israel (as over water supply). Despite the deceptive wording, Finance Min. Netanyahu professes himself more or less satisfied that Bush met his conditions for an acceptable arrangement.\n\nBush called the disengagement a first step. He ignored the main problem, how to deal with terrorism. Terrorism is sure to increase after the Israeli withdrawal, according to the heads of Israel's secret service, military intelligence, and almost all IDF generals.\n\nPres. Bush offered no financial help to Israel for its economic sacrifice to its enemies demanded by the US, nor agree to the route of the separation fence (temporary but financially ruinous for Israel, forced thereby to reduce real defense expenditure such as new research projects).\n\nCustomarily, the US refers to the \"pre-1967 Green Line\" as the boundary under dispute. This time Bush referred to the earlier 1949 armistice line. He may have reopened the boundary not just of Yesha but of Israel for negotiations and to Arab claims! Egypt and Jordan could reopen their treaties with Israel. This foresees the dismantling of Israel according to the Arab phased plan (4/15).\n\nWHAT DOES THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION TELL THE ARABS?\n\nThe Bush Administration has assured Arab states that Sharon's Plan would not impair the \"right of return\" to Israel! That contradicts PM Sharon's claim, accepted by reporters, about his plan. Sec. Powell and deputies told the Arab leaders that the Plan would get them a state and thousands of Israeli houses (IMRA, 4/14). Sordid of Powell, isn't it!\n\nWHAT ISRAEL ASSURES THE U.S.\n\nPM Sharon's aide Dov Weissglass, wrote to Dr. Rice that Israel will work with the US ambassador to define the construction line of settlements, unauthorized outposts, and removal of checkpoints. Israel will try to expedite legal decisions on liens on P.A. revenues. Israel assures the US it wants a P.A. state and is committed to the MAP to get them (IMRA, 4/14). It omits Sharon's reservations to the MAP. The reservations were stated just to defuse objection at the time. Israel lets itself be dictated to by the US in behalf of the Arabs, who wish to take over both.\n\nANOTHER SUPPORTER OF THE PLAN\n\nAlthough Education Min. Livnat disparages the Plan, she supports. \"Give it a chance,\" she says, because the people want hope and the PM wants to strengthen settlement blocs (Arutz-7, 4/18).\n\nWhat poor rationalization and leadership! Give a bad plan a chance to uphold the people's misguided hope in it? False hope is the enemy of survival. Strengthen the settlement blocs?\n\nISRAEL WEAKENING THE SETTLEMENTS\n\nAttorney General, Menachem Mazuz, instructed the government to stop funding all Yesha Jewish communities. He claims this is to keep any of the money from going to illegal outposts. If so, why does he include Gaza, which has no unauthorized outposts? Why does he exempt Arab villages having tens of thousands of illegal buildings? Collective punishment (Arutz-7 4/15). This may be preparatory to full withdrawal, in the usual underhanded, leftist Israeli way.\n\nWHY LIVNAT AND NETANYAHU SUPPORT THE PLAN\n\nMins. Livnat and Netanyahu both dislike and support the plan. Why? To remain positioned to succeed PM Sharon (likely to be indicted). They believe that they are more important to Israel than matters of borders and a sovereign terrorist state (IMRA, 4/18).\n\nMORE TRICKS TO THE REFERENDUM\n\nPm Sharon was supposed to debate Min. Uzi Landau over the Plan. Sharon wanted this to consist of just one speech each, his the last word, not rebuttals, and no questions. Since that is not a debate, Min. Landau refused, and so no debate will be held (IMRA, 4/19). Politicians commonly promise debates as if confident of their case, but then set such conditions as to minimize or obviate genuine clash of ideas and putting the opponent on the spot.\n\nWHAT IS WRONG WITH THE PLAN\n\n(1) It rewards terrorism - why else the concession? (2) The reward encourages more terrorism, especially in the absence of Israeli troops. (3) Ceding territory when under attack sets an evil precedent. (4) No reciprocity, so that the terrorists got something for nothing. (5) Contrary to what PM Sharon touts about the plan, Israel does not retain a right to keep part of Yesha, according to Sec. Powell. (6) The P.A. refuses to give up the \"right of return,\" and the Plan doe not require them to agree to give it up. (7) It not only relinquishes Jewish rights to live in another part of the Land of Israel, but the Jews ethnically cleanse their own people (Prof. Steven Plaut, 4/16, e-mail). (8) The plan has false premises.\n\nMr. Shulman is a veteran defender of Israel on several web-based forums. He provides cool information and right-on-target overviews.

He writes:\n\nThis is the transcript of an interview conducted yesterday by the BBC's Tim Sebastian with Khaled Meshaal, who has taken on full leadership of Hamas, at least outside of Gaza and the West Bank, after the targeted killing of Abdel Aziz Rantis. (After the elimination of Hamas's Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, Meshaal and Rantisi had shared leadership.) Operating from various Arab capitals -- usually Damascus or Beirut -- Meshaal is an avowed extremist with known ties to Iran and Hezbollah. Meshaal's first task, beyond perfunctorily threatening reprisal against Israel for Rantisi's death, will be to establish control over local Hamas leaders in Gaza, some of whom are reportedly reassessing their options in light of the IDF's successful counter-terrorism measures.\n\nBBC, \"HARDTALK,\" April 19, 2004: Tim Sebastian's interview with Hamas's Khaled Meshaal\n\nThis interview was conducted in an undisclosed location in Beirut under intense security.\n\nMr Meshaal spoke in Arabic and his text has been translated to English. This transcript was done from a vhs recording of the interview. We have made every effort but cannot guarantee total accuracy.\n\nTIm Sebastian's Introduction:\n\nI'm in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, at the end of an extraordinary day for HARDtalk. We were invited here to meet the leader of the Palestinian group, Hamas, labelled by Europe and America as one of the most dangerous terrorist organisations in the world. It's leader had come here specially from Syria amid meticulous security. We had to change cars, and locations, we ended up travelling in a van that had sealed windows to an undisclosed location. So when we finally caught up with the man in the wake of the assassination of his spiritual leader, Sheikh Yassin, which way is the movement, Hamas heading?\n\nTIM SEBASTIAN - Khaled Meshaal. A very warm welcome to the programme. In the wake of the Israeli assassination of Sheikh Yassin, is Hamas planning yet another cycle of pointless revenge violence?\n\nKHALED MESHAAL- In the name of God the Compassionate, the Merciful. Bloodshed in Palestine is going on because of the Israeli crimes before and it didn't begin after the assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. The Zionist crime requests a Palestinian response. This is something very ordinary. This reciprocity is acknowledged by all human and spiritual laws and legislations.\n\nTS - Where does it get you? Where does it get you, this retaliation? It doesn't change anything. It doesn't get you anywhere does it? More people die. More of your people die, more Israelis die. No progress is made. Haven't you got anything else to offer to the process?\n\nKM: Our goal is to end the occupation and not kill people. If the world was able to be fair with us and give us back our land and rights, we won't need anymore fighting and resistance\n\nTS - And when you take this revenge and you see the bodies of Israeli women and children on the streets, does that make you feel better?\n\nKM: We feel better when the occupation ends. We hope that no blood will fall in Palestine but the one who began with aggression is the one to be held responsible for it. Sheikh Ahmed Yassin was a religious cleric paralysed and despite that, he was targeted by Zionist missiles which are American weapons. The Palestinian people have the right to respond to this aggression.\n\nTS - Sheikh Yassin is a man who ordered killings of civilians - Israeli civilians. You can hardly complain when in a war he himself is killed can you?\n\nKM: Sheikh Ahmed Yassin didn't order anyone. The resistance has a military specialised wing that fights on the ground. It is a natural right.\n\nTS - He sanctioned the killings didn't he. He sanctioned them.\n\nKM: The resistance operations don't need anybody's decision. Every Palestinian knows his duty. Any Palestinian who sees the Israeli crimes would act normally. The military wing in Hamas like the military wings in other factions knows their duty. They are doing their job in defending their people, responding to the Israeli aggression and resisting the occupation.\n\nTS - Mr Meshaal, you're not defending anybody are you. Your tactics are not defending your people at all. There is not one single Palestinian you can defend against Israeli attacks from F16's and from tanks, can you?\n\nKM: We are defending our people even if the balance of power is unequal, even if the Israeli weapons are much ore superior. The Israeli occupying enemy must understand that each crime from their end would bring a Palestinian response.\n\nTS - You target women and children. That is terrorism of the most brutal kind.\n\nKM: We are not targeting civilians and we are not targeting children. >From the beginning the Palestinian resistance was focusing on military targets and on settlers\n\nTS - So the suicide bombs on buses aren't for civilians? The children and women who die on buses? I don't notice the suicide bombers allowing civilians off the bus before they blow it up.\n\nKM: I didn't complete my answer. I said the Palestinian resistance focused in the beginning on military targets and on settlers. But Israel committed crimes against civilians in the Aqsa mosque in 1990 and in the Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron in 1994 against innocent civilians who were praying in the mosque.\n\nTS - What are the conditions for a ceasefire? A new ceasefire.\n\nKM: Let Israel withdraw first, and after that we will negotiate. This is our land this is our natural right\n\nTS - A withdrawal to the '67 borders.\n\nKM: We consider this positive step but we have the right in all Palestine\n\nTS - You don't say, Sheikh Yassin said that Hamas would agree, he told a German news agency, January 9th, Hamas would agree to a temporary peace with Israel in exchange for the establishment of a Palestinian state on the basis of the 67 borders. Are you saying that doesn't stand anymore? Or it does stand. Would that lead to a permanent ceasefire?\n\nKM: We believe in what Sheikh Ahmed Yassin said in Hamas movement. But the question is does Israel accept to withdraw? Ask the occupying side first. Let it withdraw. Let it says I am ready to withdraw to the 67 borders then ask Hamas to hold a ceasefire...\n\nTS - I'm asking what your conditions are.\n\nKM: I said let Israel withdraw first. It is the one that began the aggression. Let it stop occupation and then everything can be negotiated.\n\nTS - They can withdraw but you promise nothing. You promise nothing. They must withdraw but you promise nothing.\n\nKM: I have said what Sheikh Ahmed Yassin has said. You have quoted Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. What he said concerning the withdrawal to the '67 borders. If this happened we might have a truce with Israel. We believe in this in Hamas.\n\nTS - There could be but you're not saying there definitely would be a truce if Israel withdraws to '67 borders.\n\nKM: Perhaps but Israel has to withdraw first. Israel is refusing it. It didn't abide by Oslo.\n\nTS - It's the other side that has to move first.\n\nKM - Of course\n\nTS - The other side has to move first. You think that's good negotiation? You think that's going to produce some results? You know very well that isn't going to produce any results. You're offering nothing in return. You want the withdrawal but you offer nothing in return.\n\nKM: We offered positive initiatives. We proposed an initiative to put aside civilians. We proposed that Israel withdraws to the borders of 1967 and then there would be a possibility for truce between us and Israel. We offered several initiatives but Israel which is stronger militarily and is backed by America and whose crimes the world refuses to speak about refuses to withdraw. It refuses to recognise the Palestinian rights.\n\nTS - Mr Meshaal the record is different. The record is different. You fought every attempt at peace. You fought Oslo, you were against Madrid, you even condemned the Geneva Accord, you were against the Mitchell document, the Tenet document, your organisation has been against every attempt at peace.\n\nKM: Because those initiatives don't lead to peacemaking and the proof is the factual present. What did Oslo do? Did it achieve peace? You are saying the 67 borders. All those agreements that you have mentioned did not bring peace. On the contrary they legitimise the occupation and give it a chance for expansion. The settlements grew bigger under Oslo\n\nTS - You want a commitment from the international community but you're not giving any commitments at all. You still have a charter dedicated to the destruction of Israel. Your charter says, Palestine in it's entirety alone is an Islamic (INAUDIBLE).An Islamic endowment. Where's the room for Israel?\n\nKM: I want to ask you one question. Arafat gave you clear and repeated commitments and what did you do with him? Did you respect his commitments?\n\nTS - Why are you raising the question of Arafat? You don't care about Arafat at all. In 2002 you said \"If we want reform, lets start with the leadership. Most of the leaders in the PA need to be changed. What's the point of having a Palestinian Authority if it's incapable of defending it's people\". You don't want the Palestinian Authority anymore than Israel. You're on the same side there aren't you?\n\nKM: On the contrary there is no problem between us and the Palestinian authority. We are different politically but we negotiate and hold talks.\n\nTS - There are huge problems between you and the Palestinian Authority. Huge problems.\n\nKM: The biggest problem is between us and Israel.\n\nTS - So why did you say that? Why say that in 2002 that you wanted them out?\n\nKM: No not at all. This is not true. We have disagreed..\n\nTS - You did say that. In the Daily Star newspaper in Beirut. May 2002 \"What's the point of having a Palestinian Authority if it's incapable of defending its people\".\n\nKM: Yes we criticised the corruption of the Authority and its surrender of the Palestinian rights but we don't call for a struggle with the authority. We call for reforms and we ask to have Palestinian correctness on all levels and an attachment to the Palestinian right.\n\nTS - Let's face it, this is just a power struggle between you and the Palestinian Authority. You want to push them aside don't you? They offered you a place in the government, you turned them down. They offered you the hand of cooperation, you turned it down . You don't want the Palestinian Authority anymore than the Israelis do.\n\nKM: No, don't put us on the same side with the Israelis. The Palestinian Authority was mistaken when it bargained on the Palestinian rights and when it made mistakes and was hit by corruption. We stood against this because this was against the interest of the Palestinian people.\n\nTS - So you condemn them? You condemn them and then you're prepared to do business with them at the same time? The two don't go together.\n\nKM: To tell them they are mistaken doesn't mean to be in a struggle with them, I hope you understand this. We might disagree with them in the political point of view or program but that doesn't mean a struggle.\n\nTS - Dalal Salama, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, member of the West Bank Fatah committee, said on January 7th, \"The differences today between PA and Hamas are deeper than they appear. And not just relating to Israeli/ Palestinian questions but also to the character of Palestinian decision making. Deep differences.\n\nKM: Yes we are different politically but we agree on many other matters. We agreed about the intifada. We agreed about resistance. You see Hamas, Aqsa martyrs, Jihad factions and others, we agree on several issues. We agree on the Palestinian right but disagree in interpretations and some political programs. This is very natural.\n\nTS - The proof of your willingness to unite with the Palestinians is the fact that you refuse to serve in Yasser Arafat's cabinet. That's the proof of your intention isn't it? Those are your real intentions.\n\nKM: The way is not to join a cabinet where Yasser Arafat is. We have proposed to the brothers at the authority and in Fatah movement to participate in the decision making, we are one people, common factions in the intifada and resistance and it is our right to participate in decision making. This is the democracy that you want in Europe and that America wants.\n\nTS - If you believed in democracy, if you yourself believed in democracy, why do you get your money from countries, go to countries that have no democracy whatsoever to finance you? Like Saudi Arabia, like Iran, like Syria, not one jot of democracy. What do you care about democracy if you go to these countries?\n\nKM: First we are practicing democracy and consultations inside Hamas by ourselves. Second we are not taking any money from countries. We are taking money from people. And the people are the ones who elect and give decision and legitimacy and give us money as well.\n\nTS - Five million dollars from Saudi Arabia.\n\nKM: Give me the proof. Do you have any proof?\n\nTS - Do you deny it? Do you deny it?\n\nKM: I don't deny anything that does not exist.\n\nTS - You were a guest of King Fahd in Riyadh two years ago. You were personally hosted by King Fahd in Riyadh two years ago.\n\nKM: We are visiting the Arab countries and meeting with Arab leaders because they believe in Hamas line and in the resistance movement and stand by the Palestinian right. But that doesn't mean that we took money.\n\nTS - The EU needs you to denounce violence otherwise they can't help you. They're not going to help you.\n\nKM: The Palestinian resistance is not terrorism neither violence, and therefore we can't surrender our rights.\n\nTS - You're the only one with that view Mr Meshaal. You're the only one who thinks that.\n\nKM: Do you think I am the only one? What about those people who are resisting occupation and condemning Israel and America? Do you know that 43% of the American people consider the US the biggest danger to world peace? There is an international terrorism led by the US and Israel.\n\nTS - A lot of people may be criticising Israel but they're not supporting you. Just because they criticise Israel doesn't mean they support you.\n\nKM: It is enough for me that Arab and Islamic people support us and stand with us and all the free people in the world stand with us and a part of the international official position that supports Israel and shuts up on its crimes is a part of the hypocrisy of this phase. I tell you that Israel will be a burden for you in Europe and a burden even for the US.\n\nTS - You accuse the West of contradictions but look at your contradictions. You say you want democracy in the region, so it's in your interests that America should succeed in Iraq because if Iraq is democratic, then that's presumably what you want so why do you have Abdul Aziz Rantissi, your representative in Gaza, calling for the creation of martyrdom cells in Iraq so that more people can blow themselves up and sabotage the democratic process. Why?\n\nKM: leave Dr Abdul Aziz Rantissi and look to the Iraqi people. Did the Iraqi people accept the US democracy?\n\nTS - I'm asking you why Hamas is not supporting the democratic process in Iraq. That's what I'm asking you. Mr Meshaal, you know perfectly well that this is first chance at democracy the Iraqis have had in decades. They had no chance whatsoever when Saddam Hussein was the leader. This is their first chance. Why don't you do everything you can to help them instead of sabotaging?\n\nKM: What the US is doing in Iraq is not democracy. It is an occupation and there are killings right now.\n\nTS - Do you speak for the Iraqi people?\n\nKM: What is going on in Iraq is not our business. We don't participate in its failure or success. But what is happening in Iraq is not democracy and the proof is that you should go to the Iraqi people and do a survey. Do they accept the US occupation? Do they believe in the US pretended democracy? They do not. The Iraqi people don't trust the US promises and don't trust its democracy. We, as Arabs and Muslims, have a long history in democracy.\n\nTS - Do you speak for the Iraqi people?\n\nKM: I don't speak in their name. I just tell you go to the Iraqi people and ask them. You will hear the true Iraqi position.\n\nTS - What if it succeeds. If democracy succeeds in Iraq, will you apologise?\n\nKM: I hope democracy would succeed. But I tell you no democracy will succeed with the US tanks. The democracy succeeds when...\n\nTS - The voice of doom from Hamas? The voice of doom? Haven't you got anything better to offer than that? No more encouragement than that \"It's not going to succeed\"? You want the failure, don't you? You want it to fail because the Americans are involved in it. That's why you want it to fail.\n\nKM: Do you want to tell me that the problem in Iraq is caused by Hamas movement? The problem in Iraq is much more complex.\n\nTS - The Israeli's are going to withdraw from Gaza. They say they are going to withdraw. Are you going to allow this to happen peacefully? Are you going to work in cooperation with the Palestinian Authority or make trouble at Gaza?\n\nKM: When Sharon declared that he will withdraw from Gaza, who escalated the violence? Did we or did they? Who killed Sheikh Ahmed Yassin? When did the Apache helicopters assassinate Sheikh Yassin? Wasn't it after Sharon had promised to withdraw from Gaza?\n\nTS - Will you work with the Palestinian Authority? Will you cooperate with the Palestinian Authority?\n\nKM: Yes we will cooperate with the Authority and with Fatah and all the factions. We agreed on a very clear title. We are partners in the decision making and partners in managing Gaza after the Israeli withdrawal\n\nTS - And when the PA condemn suicide bombing, you will just turn away? You won't listen to them. You're not going to obey them are you?\n\nKM: Don't interfere in our internal Palestinian matters, we can agree. The problem is not between us as Palestinians. It is not between Hamas and Fatah or Hamas and Arafat. The problem is between us and Israel. Stop the Israeli aggression; oblige Israel to withdraw from our land\n\nTS - Your problem Mr Meshaal is that the Palestinian Authority is telling you to stop the suicide bombings but you won't do it. That's not an internal problem. That belongs to the rest of the world.\n\nKM: I tell you when the authority asks Hamas or any other faction or Aqsa martyrs to stop it, it knows that the problem doesn't lie in this side, the problem is with Sharon. We stopped several times. We presented more than one truce\n\nTS - You're avoiding the question.\n\nKM: I am not avoiding it. I am answering you. I am saying the problem is not with us. We presented more than a truce. Last year in Cairo we have declared a truce that lasted for 50 days, who destroyed it? Sharon.\n\nTS - How are they supposed to trust an organisation that still has a charter that's dedicated to the destruction of Israel? When you renounce that, when you get rid of that charter, maybe you can create some trust. Why should they do business with someone who is dedicated to destroying them on paper?\n\nKM: If he doesn't trust us how do you ask me to trust him? He is occupying my land and killing my children and destroying houses and stealing lands. He is practicing killings and assassination everyday. Then Arafat gave them such declarations and positions and despite this they didn't stop. Didn't Arafat take those positions? And despite this Arafat doesn't have their confidence.\n\nTS - Answer me just one question. Does Israel have the right to exist in peace? Do you acknowledge the right of Israel to exist in peace?\n\nKM: We consider Palestine our land and this is our natural right and the occupation must end. Occupation cannot be divided.\n\nTS - Answer the question, yes or no, does Israel have the right to exist? It's a very simple question.\n\nKM: I am saying we have the right to our land and we have the right to be freed from occupation. Any occupation even if time goes by doesn't become legitimate.\n\nTS - So the answer is no. Israel does not have the right to exist. That's what you're telling me.\n\nKM: The occupation doesn't become legitimate even after a long time. You are talking about a fair and comprehensive peace. The Palestinian who was forced to leave his land in Haifa and Jafa, if he doesn't return to his land, how do you say this is fair? Why do you stick to your rights in Europe and the whole world while you ask us to drop ours?\n\nTS - So Israel does not have the right to exist. Let's just clarify this once and for all. You're saying Israel does not have the right to exist.\n\nTS - So you're not going to answer my question. Let's just clarify that for the sake of the viewers, you're not going to answer my question because it's too difficult.\n\nKM: This is not difficult. I answered in the spirit of the situation. Occupation must end regardless of the duration. Therefore, it is our right to hold on to our land.\n\nTS - How can anyone negotiate with people who will not give a straight answer to a straight question? How?\n\nKM: Didn't you understand my answer?\n\nTS - I don't think the rest of the world will understand.\n\nKM: People will understand it. I am asking you one question. Before 1948 what was happening on the land of Palestine? There were a people living peacefully on its land.\n\nTS - Mr Meshaal, you want to go backwards when the rest of the world wants to go forward. You always go back.\n\nKM: I am telling the truth, if you want to deal with a present situation you must look to its roots.\n\nTS - Mr Meshaal, you came from Syria to do this interview here in Beirut and a lot of people might expect that you would have something new to offer. Something apart from just the same old cycle of violence. Do you really have nothing new to offer to this process?\n\nKM: I will summarize very clearly Hamas position. First to adopt it in Europe and oblige America to do so. It consists of putting aside civilians in the struggle. If you were pitying the circle of killings in occupied Palestine oblige Israel to accept to put aside civilians in the struggle from both sides.\n\nTS - Put aside the civilians as a first step.\n\nKM: I am telling you let us stop the bloodshed from both sides. Let us put aside civilians in the struggle and let it just be between resistance from the Palestinian side and the Israeli forces and settlers. You are refusing this. When you are refusing our initiative to put aside civilians, you are allowing continuing the bloodshed. Why do you want to make pressure just on us and you can't do any pressure on Israel?\n\nTS - And the second step?\n\nKM: After that if Israel is convinced and sees the necessity to withdraw from the occupied territories, then this is a good step and then I would think the violence and killings in the region would stop even for a period of time, then coming generations would continue their own vision. But at least let us do a first step. Let us stop the struggle between civilians, let Israel withdraw first then tell the Palestinian people we gave you a state.\n\nTS - Khaled Meshaal. Thanks for being on the programme.\n\nTo Go To Top I had hoped to devote this letter to last week's adventures getting the car registration straightened out. Or straitened out, more accurately. Instead, sitting here under a tree on the lawn in front of our bungalow at Kibbutz Alumim on this second Intermediate Day of Passover, trying to ignore a bone-chilling wind and the happy shrieks of our grandchildren as they stab each other with crayons specially provided by their grandmother, and if this sentence weren't already absurdly long I would add the whining of our grandchildren's parents and the stuff falling on to this computer from the branches above which falling stuff is, thank God, solid and not liquid or it would splatter on the screen, not to mention the other guests who come by and bang into me with their walkers or canes and ask me what I'm doing, to which it takes all my willpower not to say \"baking matzah\" or \"performing open heart surgery\", instead - I'll start with Pessach.\n\nEarly Monday morning, packing to leave Neve Dekalim for the Seder with Ari and Efrat in Maale Adumim, our phone rang. It was the gentleman who runs Israel Resource News Agency in Jerusalem, and who has been bringing busloads of journalists to us since the present crisis began. \"Will you and Moshe be available to talk to a busload of reporters on Tuesday, the day after Pessach?\"\n\n\"Yes\" said La Passionara in a resigned voice.\n\n\"Will you and Moshe be available to fly to Washington Tuesday night for a series of press conferences?\"\n\nLa P was speechless.\n\n\"You'll be flying Business Class both ways\" he added to break the silence.\n\n\"Let me talk to Moshe.\" She hung up. Of course their conversation had been much more detailed.\n\nWe talked. And we talked. And we talked. We agreed that neither of us has the physical strength for this trip. We agreed that neither of us wants to go, though the prospect of flying Business Class once before getting our very own permanent wings is tempting. We agreed that we have no choice but to go.\n\n[aside: Please don't get the idea that we have an exaggerated sense of our own importance. Or that we think we can actually influence events. It's just that, for our own peace of mind and irrespective of the outcome of the struggle, we have to feel we did whatever we could.]\n\nWhat disturbed me about the proposed trip is that the whole weight of it seemed to be on us. So I called Mr. IRNA and said it was too big a job for just Rachel and I, and suggested two other people to spread the burden: Anita Tucker, the lady farmer from Nezer Hazani, and Dror Vanunu, from the Gush Katif Information Service. Dror is not a native English speaker but is learning fast, and Rachel has been training him in Western manners and mores. More important, he is young and good looking and exudes sincerity. This last more than makes up for any lapses in English.\n\nWithin an hour we were informed that the Gang of Two was now officially the Gang of Four. And that following Washington we would be staying on for the Magical Mystery Fund Raising Tour that was supposed to have taken place before Pessach. Our two-day jaunt is now extended to ten days.\n\nIn a state of alternating shock and hysteria we finished packing, picked up two teenaged girls we were supposed to drop off in Jerusalem, and set off. Comforting ourselves with the hope that the trip might yet be cancelled, and that the Lord would put everything right without the need for our sacrifice.\n\nWe had been on the road for about an hour, the two girls in the back chattering on cellphones while Rachel and I discussed Important Matters of State, when it happened.\n\nJust outside Moshav Otzem, on a two-lane road a few kilometers from Kiryat Gat, traffic flowing at about 110 k.p.h., two rocks flew off the top of a truck and hit our windshield directly at my eye level. One, the size of Mike Tyson's fist, struck without effect. The second, the size of Mike Tyson's head, cracked the windshield. Thank God it didn't shatter the windshield, or we would had have crashed. Certainly it would have drastically rearranged my already disarranged features, and opened a window of opportunity in my head. As it is, there is a silver-dollar-sized black spot and a beautiful lattice of cracks to impede my vision. Fortunately I don't see much anyway, so this hardly makes a serious difference. In fact, sunlight by day and headlights at night travel along the cracks like sparklers. Quite beautiful, really.\n\nOK, back to the accident. We signaled for the driver to stop but he sped off in a direction opposite to the one we needed. We noted his license plates, and a telephone number stenciled at the back with the words \"call this number if this vehicle is involved in an accident or is being driven recklessly\". One of the kids in the back called the number and was told to file a complaint with the police. Which we did, making a detour into Kiryat Gat. Fortunately we had the girls with us to fill out the complaint forms. The whole thing delayed us for an hour, and had the beneficial effect of removing our projected trip from the list of Things to Discuss. At least for a little while.\n\nThe Seder was wonderful. Ari, the perfect host; Efrat, the perfect hostess; Doriah, Alumah, Akiva, Yehuda and Chanale the perfect grandchildren. We couldn't have had a better time.\n\nI found it interesting that the fate of Gush Katif is a constant subject of conversation. Clearly the people of Maale Adumim, which is just outside Jerusalem, are aware that their fate is dependent upon ours. Would that the rest of Israel's Jews, imagining themselves secure within the so-called Green Line, realized it also.\n\nIt is Friday afternoon and we are surrounded by all the children and grandchildren. Kibbutz Alumim is beautiful, the weather is perfect, the food is edible, the natives are friendly. We will all be here until Monday night. Rachel and I are hoping to recharge our batteries for what lies ahead.\n\nTwo drawbacks to being here:\n\nThe first, the many dogs that freely roam the grounds. They are all patient, good-tempered, let the children pet them at will. Unfortunately the younger ones poop where they please. And one has pooped just where our grandchildren are playing barefoot on the lawn. I'm watching the scene as I type this: four grandchildren are getting their feet scrubbed, and two adults are attempting to scrape the bottoms and sides of their shoes. Everyone is maintaining the holiday good humor spirit. I am thankful my nostrils are clogged.\n\nThe second drawback is of far greater import. The salt-free, sugar-free, taste-free, pleasure-free food regimen we have been following is almost impossible to keep here. This is driving Rachel mad and, difficult as it will be for you to believe, I am sympathetic. This is because she has lost considerable weight, which is of no interest to me as I have always felt the more the merrier, and is delighted with her progress, which is. Her mood is so good as she keeps putting on clothes that haven't fit for the longest time, and they fit perfectly. Many are even loose.\n\nThe fly in the diet ointment is that dieters think their diets are of interest to others, and discuss the details endlessly. Sometimes I find myself seated between La P and Tamar, who is into health food, and in minutes I am contemplating committing Harry Carey with a sharpened carrot stick or celery spear.\n\nIt drives me crazy that Rachel is constantly asking me \"Aren't you feeling better?\" When I'm writing and it is going well, I'm happy. When I `m writing and it isn't going well, I'm less happy. When I'm not writing, I'm miserable. Still it pains me to admit I can now button the Fat Shop shirts. I can't sit down in them. I can't even breathe in them. But at least there is hope. [Hope of what? That my pall-bearers won't get herniated? Who knows.]\n\nWe've learned there was some excitement on Neve Dekalim in our absence. On Seder Eve several Thai workers decided to burglarize homes in which they had been working and whose owners would be away for the holiday. Someone saw broken windows and figures moving in homes that were supposed to be empty. The assumption was that this was a terrorist attack and the army and police went into action. The Thais were caught. I'm amazed they weren't killed. They are to be deported, to the special delight of the stray dogs and cats and land crabs who were staples of their diet.\n\nSunday, 4am\n\nI awoke half an hour ago and stepped outside to cremate the remains of a cigar stashed on the front porch. Everything was shrouded in fog, and the orange lamps on the pathway glowed as faintly as fireflies. My agitation [see below] had largely evaporated and I was enjoying the view, or lack of view, when I became aware of the sound of rain. A patter, but steady. I stepped off the porch expecting to have my bald pate shined, but there was nothing except for the sound. A few steps down the path and I felt several drops. A few steps more, and no drops. Alternating patches of wet and dry on the walkway confused me further, until I realized the patter of rain was the patter of dew falling off the leaves and branches. The effect was magical and I enjoyed it until the cigar was reduced to ash.\n\nShabbat was wonderful, though I gorged myself at lunch - the first time I've overeaten since commencing the diet - and am paying the penalty for gluttony.\n\nShortly after Shabbat ended Rachel was on the phone for updates on our travel plans. To learn that they have been canceled. Mr. INRA couldn't get the funding, and the YESHA council wouldn't waste money sending nobodies.\n\nRachel was relieved. I should have been relieved, but I was devastated. Yes, it's all ego. And yes, I suppose I do have delusions of grandeur. But ever since we were asked to go my brain has been in overdrive formulating speeches and statements and arguments and ripostes. All suitable for the Washington press conferences. To appear at the same time and in the same city as Sharon is appearing, to go head-to-head, as it were, the semi-private vs the general, to find out if I am as good as I think am.\n\nNow, we are told, there may be a fund-raising trip later in the month. A trip in which I can play my accustomed role as Heroic Cripple, waving my bloody stumps and making my mock-modest jokes. It is a role I have come to loathe, however effective I am.\n\nUnlike Rachel, who properly keeps her eye on the goal, and adapts to whatever best serves that goal, I appear to have turned into the clown who wants to play drama. No fool like an old fool. Like Edgar Bergen's Charlie McCarthy, I am folded up and put back into the box, to be used as needed. So why aren't I consoled by the fact that, from time to time, I am needed?\n\nlater\n\nShortly after 5:30, stir-crazy and still upset, I grabbed a bag of dirty laundry and drove home to Neve Dekalim only thirty minutes drive away. Laundry generally calms me, and it worked wonders. That, and being surrounded by the familiar. We think of Neve Dekalim as an oasis in the desert, and it is. But comparing its plants, flowers and trees, struggling to survive in the sand, with the almost tropical lushness of Kibbutz Alumim makes my heart overflow with appreciation for what the people of Gush Katif have accomplished.\n\nBy 8 I was back at Alumim, and in the midst of a minor crisis as Dafna's Gur, four years old going on twelve, disappeared. He just went off exploring, and by the time he reappeared half the kibbutz had been enlisted in the search. Where he had been off to is a mystery. He won't say. Our relief is matched by our annoyance.\n\nAnd now, the vehicle registration saga. Springtime in Tel Aviv: A Farce in Four Acts.\n\nAct 1:\n\nI tried to avoid having to go to the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv to get the document that would permit the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue a vehicle registration form to replace the one I had allowed to lapse. Phone calls, faxes, special prayers involving human sacrifice - all to no avail. With Pessach - when government offices become even more inert than at regular times - fast approaching, and the prospect of extended driving in an unlicensed vehicle hanging like a black cloud over us, only active and personal intervention would do.\n\nSo, two weeks ago Monday morning at 6am I boarded the armored bus in Neve Dekalim which took me to the central bus station in Ashkelon where I boarded an \"express bus\", ie, only eight stops along the way, to Tel Aviv where, against every cheap fiber in my penny-pinching soul, I took a taxi to the Defense Ministry offices, arriving at 10am. There, amazed to find only three people ahead of me and a smiling and sympathetic staff to greet me, I explained the problem. I even made certain, in as un-Israeli a gesture as can be imagined, to emphasize my own culpability.\n\nForms were filled out, signatures were X'd, rubber stamps were applied, DNA tests were made, and the document was complete. Or so I thought. As I extended my hand to take it, the pretty, blond soldierette said \"We'll mail it to you.\"\n\n\"Why mail it? Why can't I take it now?\"\n\n\"Because\" she said, \"it isn't official until the doctor has signed and stamped it.\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"The doctor isn't here today. He's ill.\"\n\n\"When will he be in?\"\n\n\"Maybe tomorrow. Maybe the day after. Maybe after Pessach.\"\n\nTrying to suppress the scream forming in my throat, I asked to speak to her supervisor.\n\nA woman with lifeless eyes and lips turned up in what might have been a smile but was more likely a grimace of constipation said \"The doctor is ill.\"\n\n\"But I'm running out of time. I have to have that document.\"\n\n\"The doctor is ill\" she repeated, and this time I saw that my desperation had elicited a genuine smile. Of pleasure.\n\n\"Isn't there another doctor?\"\n\n\"The doctor who is ill is substituting for a doctor who is ill.\" This was delivered with a broad grin.\n\n\"If I come back tomorrow, will it be signed?\"\n\n\"You can come back. But I don't know if it will be signed.\"\n\n\"What do you suggest?\"\n\nA shrug. \"Do what you want. We don't receive the public again until Wednesday.\"\n\nA phenomenon of physics: the four hour trip home took twice as long as the four hour trip to Tel Aviv.\n\nTime was running out.\n\nAct 2:\n\nWednesday, 6am, Neve Dekalim. I see the bus to Ashkelon approaching, but a station wagon pulls up first.\n\n\"Hey, Moshe, want a ride to Tel Aviv?\"\n\nIs this a sign of good fortune, or am I being set up for another fall?\n\nI am at the Defense Ministry by 8:30, only to find that today the Defense Ministry doesn't torture the public until 3pm.\n\nI felt a mixture of consternation and relief at the delay of the inevitable, and decided to spend the time visiting Tower Records. In the tradition of `the condemned man ate a hearty meal'. But Tower didn't open til 10am and it was just 9, so I crossed the street to the Tel Aviv Promenade and stared at the water.\n\nThe beach - a nice touch, I thought - is called Jerusalem Beach, and despite the early hour by Tel Aviv standards Promenade traffic was heavy. Grim-faced power walkers, joggers, bicyclists, the rare baby carriage, oldsters straight out of central casting playing shesh-besh, dominos, cards, checkers. Several benches away four professional ladies - were they coming off the late shift or starting the early shift? - were either relaxing or trolling for sardines. The beach itself was sparsely peopled; an old man with a white beard down to his toes, some exercisers, one character walking backward at high speed and falling over one obstacle after another every few yards. After all this Tower was a letdown, nothing I wanted and the lone salesman - I was the lone customer - glaring at me as if I had come in just to ruin his morning.\n\nWhile at the Promenade a sound truck with a large poster advertising something called The Monte Carlo Circus had passed repeatedly, going so quickly that no more than two consecutive words were intelligible. By the sixth or seventh drive by I had caught most of the message, and now as I left Tower Records the truck sped by once more.\n\nWith four and a half hours to waste before the Defense Ministry office opened I decided to walk there in a circuitous route. Which is crazy, because I generally can't walk more than a block or two without cramps in both legs. Perhaps because I was preoccupied with what I had to face in the afternoon I was able to walk and, because the Tel Aviv Municipality is concerned for its largely geriatric population and has placed benches in all residential areas, to sit whenever I felt tired.\n\nMy route took me the length of Sheinkin Street, the heart of secular, leftist, bohemian Tel Aviv, which I enjoy because the young women who crowd the street are apparently too poor to be able to be fully clothed. And there is a record store, The Third Ear, which has a smaller offering than Tower but with many of the off-beat items I adore. Alas, on this day only Cinderella's ugly stepsisters were on the street, and The Third Ear's classical department had been waxed out of existence.\n\nI was making my fifth or sixth pit stop, sitting on a bench and enjoying the fumes as heavy traffic rolled by, when the accident happened. An adult, mid-forties, was riding a child's bicycle, weaving in and out of traffic, steering with one hand while the other held a huge boom-box balanced on his shoulder to one ear. The bicycle was so small that as he pedaled his knees came up to the level of his head. A parody of Latin music blared from the box - perhaps the tape had stretched - and the cyclist was singing along at the top of his voice. Seconds after he passed me I heard a crash, and a chorus of car horns. I walked toward the noise and saw that he had run into the back of The Monte Carlo Circus sound truck. He lay on the ground, the bicycle barely visible under the truck, the boom-box silenced, but he was still singing. Nobody seemed much concerned, and at least I was able to hear the entire tape, including dates, times, prices and a description of the acts, without interruption.\n\nBy noon, incredulous that all my dilly-dallying shilly-shallying lolly-gagging bench-warming peregrinations had eaten up so little time, I arrived at the Defense Ministry and seated myself in the waiting room where two post-army service civilian guards stared at me for the miscreant that I am. They soon adjudged me harmless, bringing me water which I accepted and offering newspapers which I declined. My legs were trembling with exhaustion and I stayed glued to the chair. I tried to doze but the noise as Defense Ministry personnel passed to and from lunch, particularly the harsh sound as they were buzzed through the electronic door, made it impossible.\n\nAt 2:30 the pretty, blond soldierette - hereinafter PBS - stuck her head through the doorway, noticed me, said \"The doctor isn't here\" with a stricken look, and disappeared back inside. Though I interpreted this as A Very Ill Omen I, always a glutton, even for punishment, decided to wait another half hour for the formal death sentencing.\n\nWhich was first delivered by Lady Dead Eyes. When I complained that such a situation is absurd she gave me the Official Bureaucratic Comfort Speech: \"You're right\" she said, and lifted a stack of authorization forms awaiting Dr. Cronkite's signature, \"and you're not the only one waiting. Do you want to know how many others are suffering just like you?\"\n\nI asked to see her supervisor. Oozing sympathy and sincerity as I was ushered into his cubicle he seemed about to cry as I told my tale of woe, and I couldn't help feeling he was going to offer to drive me around until my own vehicle was available. His pain was clearly so much greater than my own that I had to control an increasing desire to comfort him. I was well aware that I was being conned, but my admiration for this bravura performance was genuine. What a waste that such a great artist is forced to ply his trade in such a dismal setting, and on such an unworthy audience. \"So we'll see you after Pessach?\" he smiled, choking back the tears, as I slunk out of the office.\n\nThus demolished, utterly, wondering whether to return home or simply walk into the sea, I turned to leave when PBS, flushed, ran up to me paper in hand. \"Here it is\" she said. I had a thousand questions but her eyes signaled a warning and I left with a whispered \"Thank you!\" Once outside I walked several blocks til I found a florist and sent PBS a bouquet for the holiday. She had certainly earned it.\n\nA phenomenon of physics: The four-hour bus ride home took only half as long as the four-hour bus trip to Tel Aviv on Monday.\n\nAct 3:\n\nThursday, 7:45am, found me at the Vehicle Registration Bureau in Beersheba, surrounded by a crowd of Arabs and Russian immigrants waiting for the 8am opening. My blood pressure was probably going through the roof from anxiety. Though I now had the proper documentation I just knew something would go wrong.\n\nTo further increase my anxiety, everything seemed to go well. Until the clerk said \"The Defense Ministry hasn't updated the computer list. Your name still doesn't appear\", and she went off to consult a supervisor.\n\nI know this is crazy but my heart leapt with relief. The blow had fallen and I no longer had to cringe in anticipation. This is very much like Rachel's inability to fall asleep until she has heard an explosion or two and can stop anticipating the attack.\n\n\"It's okay\" the clerk said upon her return, and continued processing the forms. My legs shook so badly I had to sit down.\n\nWith two and a half hours before the van back to Neve Dekalim was due to leave I looked for a post office so I could pay the license fee. Unfortunately it was the first of the month and every post office was jammed with Arabs collecting their welfare payments. Hundreds and hundreds of burka'd women looking like masked bank robbers, and a smaller number of males who probably were bank robbers. What can I say about the - ambience? I was glad that I hadn't showered since before going to Tel Aviv and was able to give as good as I got. When I finally got to a window to pay the clerk said \"You didn't have to stand in line all this time\", to which I replied \"And miss out on the smell?\"\n\nAct 4:\n\nPapers in order, the car passed its physical the next morning. All's well that ends well.\n\nBack to Pessah.\n\nOne day my brother and sister-in-law came up from Jerusalem, bringing my mother and a very close friend from New York. We enjoyed their visit, as we did that of the former kibbutz nurse who had changed my bandages daily the Pessach after I was wounded.\n\nOver the years we have become friendly with various kibbutz members, and in fact most of the people are - quite uncharacteristic for kibbutz members - good natured and helpful.\n\nStill - for all their friendliness and sympathy their political views are closer to those of their secular kibbutz neighbors than to ours. And if they are far too decent ever to express open hostility, a barrier remains.\n\nA highlight of these stays on Alumim are Grandma Rachel's parties on the lawn for all the grandchildren. This year there were two, on Shabbat and Monday the last day of Passover. Cake, cookies, candy, potato chips, even ice-pops, Rachel organizes it all and the kids adore it. Attendance not being compulsory for parents, adults appreciate these parties almost as much as the kids.\n\nMonday night, the holiday ended, everybody packed and took off for home. We, with the shortest distance to travel, were the last to leave. May we be permitted to do this again next Pessah.\n\n14.4\n\nSome thirty reporters, photographers and hangers-on were in the house yesterday. We performed well. After the general meeting an AP reporter and photographer interviewed Rachel in the house, parts of which interview were shown on Israel TV's English news this afternoon. She was magnificent. At the same time I was interviewed on the lawn by Sky News' Emma Hurd, who has been here before. A snippet appeared on Sky News this evening. I flatter myself that I'm as clever as Charlie McCarthy. Unfortunately I came across as Mortimer Snerd.\n\nTomorrow we get visitors from the New York Times and Reuters. I am not optimistic. We'd get a fairer shake from Al-Jazeera.\n\nEarly this morning I drove to Beersheba to get the windshield repaired. Beersheba is very spread out, with a dozen clumps of garages and workshops called `industrial areas'. The instructions I had gotten were unclear, and even if they had been accurate and detailed I would have gotten lost because the realization is starting to seep in that I should be in an old age home. But that's another subject. It took forty-five minutes to reach Beersheba, then ninety minutes of blundering before I found the repair shop. Then one minute to learn it is the wrong shop.\n\nThe other shop, the one that accepts my insurance, took only another thirty minutes to find because unlike the Arabs who wouldn't say or the Russians who couldn't say I finally found an elderly Yiddish speaker who gave me directions in language suitable for the directionally disabled. Only to find they didn't have my windshield in stock. Nor was it in stock in Ashkelon or Ashdod. The part was ordered - it is being delivered late this afternoon - and I will be back Friday morning to have it installed. I would prefer doing it tomorrow, but the NYTimes is coming.\n\nAfter watching the Bush-Sharon Show tonight I sunk into a terrible depression. Though Bush gave him nothing concrete, the Sharon spinners and the leftist media are showering orgasmic congratulations on our Prime Munster. Then I remembered an interchange yesterday with Mitch Potter from the Toronto Star. He asked if we weren't disappointed by the lack of support from our fellow Israelis. I replied that we weren't here to win a popularity contest, but to fulfill a Biblical commandment. And that He who determines whether or not we stay doesn't consult Bush or Sharon or the pollsters. The reward for a difficult mitzvah, I have to keep reminding myself, is much greater than for an easy mitzvah.\n\nTo my amazement and delight the people here, usually so laid back they are laid out, have been energized into activity. Everyone is on this committee or that committee and hustling and bustling to the point where just watching them makes my head spin. May their efforts be rewarded.\n\nThe trip to North America is on again. We are supposed to leave Sunday night. I have no details as to itinerary and length of stay. And I won't believe it until we are cruising at an altitude of 40,000 ft. Anita Tucker was supposed to go but she has a child who is ill. Even Rachel is wavering. At this point I don't know who/what/when/why/how. Chaos has its comforts in that the uncertainly keeps you from focusing on your fears.\n\n15.4\n\nHelicopters overhead before 6am, no explosions but lots of machine gun fire. A virtual war, like the virtual American guarantees.\n\nI keep thinking about the Bush-Sharon Show. Sharon doesn't disappoint me because I never expected anything from him. But Bush? how does a believing Christian aid and abet the expulsion of Jews from their Biblical home?\n\nThe NYTimes cancelled its visit. Not surprising, as their editorial the day before yesterday urged Bush not to offer Sharon even the appearance of support, stating that only an Israeli withdrawal to the pre-1967 boundaries will bring `peace'. With that editorial position, do you imagine they would print a sympathetic story about `settlers'?\n\nSo, leaving Rachel to deal with Reuters, I returned to Beersheba to have the windshield replaced.\n\nGarages are noisy both from the machinery in use and the shouts of those working there. Add the office phones, piped in music from a local rock'n'roll station, a toilet that made a thermonuclear noise when flushed, and you have the ambience of the place. But I had brought a book to read, ALEPPO TALES by Rabbi Haim Sabato, and it made me oblivious to my surroundings, transporting me to a world of beauty and holiness. Rabbi Sabato wrote ADJUSTING SIGHTS, about the Yom Kippur War, that I recommended. ALEPPO TALES, totally different in subject and atmosphere, is no less wonderful. It is published by The Toby Press [www.tobypress.com]. Do yourselves a favor and read it. When told the car was ready I was filled with disappointment at having to stop reading.\n\nI got home to find that Rachel has decided not to make the trip. She has a bad back and seventeen hours in coach - Tel Aviv-Milan-Toronto - would have killed her. Her purpose in going was to baby-sit me, and she feared I'd be baby-sitting her. Besides, she is needed to deal with the foreign press in Israel.\n\nHere is our group's itinerary, correct as of this writing:\n\n19th Toronto Cong. Shaarei Tefilah\n\n20th Toronto private gathering\n\n21st New York One Israel Fund offices\n\nBrooklyn Lubavitch gathering\n\n22nd Brooklyn public gathering, site being arranged by Helen Freedman of AFSI\n\n23-24 Five Towns Shabbat appearances\n\n25th Five Towns Rabbi Billet's congregation\n\nflight home\n\nIt is almost midnight and this letter seems to have gone on forever. Not only am I suffering from end-of-letter melancholy, but the prospect of the trip - particularly without Rachel guiding me through the shoals - has me terrified. Some of you will criticize me for mixing the high drama of our present situation with my meandering tales of little consequence. It is these tales that keep me from turning into a basket case. It is smoking cigars, however injurious to my physical well-being, that helps me preserve my mental well-being. It is the beautiful sunset over the sea that keeps me from drowning myself in the sea.\n\nLate this afternoon, thinking of the forces arrayed against us, I deflected despair by weeding the garden. This mundane act, this silly act given the circumstances, was my assurance that the garden would remain mine.\n\nIn light of the above I can tell you I've resumed feeding the cats. Scraps only, not on a regular basis, away from the house. They remain as loathsome as ever. But feeding them fills a need in me that is greater than my dislike of them.\n\nIt is unlikely that I will write again before leaving early Monday. So Shabbat Shalom and take good care of yourselves, my friends. And, if you're into praying, spare one for us.\n\nmoshe\n\nNeve Dekalim, Gush Katif\n\nMoshe Saperstein lost an arm while fighting in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. A resident of Neve Dekalim in the Gush Katif area of the Gaza Strip, Moshe was wounded in a February 2002 incident when he drove his car into a terrorist who had just shot and killed a young mother traveling in the car in front of him.\n\nHe writes frequently of his physical and emotional struggles. His wife, Rachel (La Passionara/La P.) teaches at the Neve Dekalim girl's high school (ulpana) and published a booklet last year for families dealing with terror victims.\n\nTo Go To Top The original article is at http://www.pmw.org.il/new/ASK%20FOR%20DEATH.htm#top It contains links to the video documentaries discussed in the article. Executive Summary\n\n\"Ask for death\" is the message that the Palestinian Authority [PA] has been conveying to its children since the start of violence in October 2000. In June 2002, two articulate 11-year-old girls were interviewed in the studio of official Palestinian Authority TV. Among other topics, they spoke of their personal yearning to achieve death through Shahada - Death for Allah - and of a similar desire they said exists in \"every Palestinian child.\" It is striking that their desire for death was expressed as a personal goal, not related to the conflict with Israel. Having been convinced that dying for Allah is preferable to life, their goal in living is not to experience a good life, but to achieve the proper death - Shahada.\n\nThe following is a selection from their remarks:\n\nHost: \"You described Shahada as something beautiful. Do you think it is beautiful?\"\n\nWalla: \"Shahada is very, very beautiful. Everyone yearns for Shahada. What could be better than going to paradise?\"\n\nHost: \"What is better, peace and full rights for the Palestinian people, or Shahada?\"\n\nWalla: \"Shahada. I will achieve my rights after becoming a Shahida.\"\n\nYussra: \"Of course Shahada is a good thing. We don't want this world, we want the Afterlife. We benefit not from this life, but from the Afterlife... The children of Palestine have accepted the concept that this is Shahada, and that death by Shahada is very good. Every Palestinian child aged, say 12, says \"Oh Lord, I would like to become a Shahid.\" [PATV, June 9, 2002]\n\nWhat has caused this compelling desire for death among these children, a desire that conflicts with the basic survival instinct of every human being?\n\nDuring the more than two and a half years of armed conflict, the Palestinian Authority [PA] has been making a paramount effort to convince their own children that there is no greater achievement than to die for Allah in battle, known as Shahada. This has been done via the many mediums at its disposal, including children's TV broadcasting, the educational system, cultural programs, directives from political and religious leaders and even encouragement from within the family.\n\nIn November 2000, a mere six weeks after the start of violence, Palestinian Media Watch published a report documenting the first indications that this was a PA goal. The official PA daily, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, glorified children who were killed in confrontations and described their deaths as personal achievements. It wrote of a 14-year-old: \"He responded to the call of Allah and achieved the Shahada he yearned... He reached the highest levels with Allah...\" The paper reported with admiration that the dead boy's \"classmates swore they would continue on the path of Shahada...\" [PA official daily, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, November 9, 2000] Other children were said to have been disappointed at having merely been injured and not killed. An injured 13-year-old: \"My goal is not to be injured, rather something loftier: Shahada.\" [PA official daily, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, November 8, 2000] Since then, Palestinian Media Watch has published numerous reports on the progress of this PA indoctrination of its children and on the varying methods the PA employs to portray death for Allah to its children, not only as an ideal, but, as something that is expected of them.\n\nThe Results of the Indoctrination\n\nIn recent months the success of the PA indoctrination efforts are apparent. The 11-year olds quoted above defining death for Allah as their goal in life and public opinion polls confirm the widespread acceptance of this sentiment. These polls show 80% of Palestinian children seek death as Shahids.\n\nStill more grave are the cases in which 14 year-olds have fulfilled this PA directive, writing farewell letters to their parents proudly describing their desire to be Shahids, and embarking on suicide terrorist missions hoping to die. It must be emphasized: the children's farewell letters have included phrases identical to phrases from the propaganda films produced by the PA, such as \"Mother, don't cry for me,\" showing a direct link between the PA propaganda and the children's drive for heroic death.\n\nThe Research\n\nThis paper documents the PA's indoctrination of Palestinian children to seek death, and its effects on the children. With the exception of statements made by parents, all the indoctrination cited in this report is directed by the Palestinian Authority.\n\nPart I: The Indoctrination of Palestinian Children to Seek Death for Allah - Shahada\n\nA. Propaganda Films for Children\n\nShort propaganda film-clips for children, teaching them to see violence and Shahada - Death for Allah - as ideal values that are expected of them, are broadcast daily on PATV, often for several hours a day. The following are three examples from among hundreds.\n\n1. The \"Farewell Letter\"\n\nA propaganda film-clip designed to offset a child's natural fear of death, portrays Shahada as both heroic and tranquil. The film's hero, a nice looking schoolboy, leaves a farewell letter explaining his choice to achieve Shahada, describing the death he is seeking as pleasurable: \"How sweet is Shahada.\" It was broadcast repeatedly in 2001-02, even three times a day.\n\nThe following are selections from the boy's letter, which are sung accompanying scenes of the boy calmly heading toward his death:\n\n\"Do not be sad, my dear,\n\n\"And do not cry over my parting,\n\n\"Oh my dear father,\n\n\"For my country, Shahada?\n\n\"How sweet is Shahada\n\n\"When I embrace you, Oh my land!?\"\n\n\"My beloved, my mother,\n\n\"My most dear,\n\n\"Be joyous over my blood\n\n\"And do not cry for me?\"\n\nThe words \"How sweet is Shahada when I embrace you, oh my land!\" are sung as the child actor is seen in the above picture falling dead and \"embracing\" the land. [PATV, hundreds of times since May 7, 2001. Recently September 27, 2002]\n\n2. The Film-Clip: \"I am the Shahid, My Mother\"\n\n\"I am the Shahid, oh my mother! I have inscribed my name with my blood?\n\n\"I have prayed for the land\n\n\"And I have responded to the promise\n\n\"And if I do not return, don't cry for me my mother! (3x)\n\n\"Sound a cry of joy, sound a cry of joy, my mother!?\n\n\"I am the Shahid, oh my mother! I have inscribed my name with my blood!\" [PATV, many times in 2001-2002, beginning May 16, 2001]\n\n3. The Muhammad Al-Dura Clip: \"Follow me\" to a Child's Paradise\n\nIn a striking film-clip, the most famous child Shahid, Muhammad Al-Dura, whose death in a crossfire was captured by a cameraman and broadcast on television, calls to Palestinian children: \"follow me\" to paradise. Al-Dura, played in the clip by a child actor, is portrayed in paradise, going to an amusement park, flying a kite and frolicking on the beach. The aim of the soothing words and scenes is to eliminate a child's natural fear of death: \"How sweet is the fragrance of the Shahids... I go with no fear, no tears...\"\n\nThe film-clip opens with the following invitation from Al-Dura displayed on the full screen: \"'I am waving to you not to part, but to say follow me' [signed] \"Muhammad Al-Dura\"\n\nThe following calming words are from the film-clip:\n\nNarrator:\n\n\"How sweeis the fragrance of the Shahids,\n\n\"How sweet is the scent of the earth,\n\n\"Its thirst by the gush of blood\n\n\"Flowing from the youthful body.\"\n\nVocalist:\n\n\"Oh father 'til we meet, Oh father, 'til we meet!\n\n\"I shall go with no fear, no tears,\n\n\"How sweet is the fragrance of the Shahids!\n\n\"I shall go to my place in heaven,\n\n\"How sweet is the fragrance of the Shahids!\"\n\nChoir: \"How sweet is the fragrance of the Shahids!\"\n\nVocalist: \"Oh father 'til we meet, Oh father, 'til we meet!\" [PATV December 25, 2000, and many times since]\n\nB. Schools and Textbooks\n\nThe PA Ministry of Education's textbooks portray Shahada as an ideal. For example, \"The Poem of the Shahid\" extols yearning for death, and includes the words: \"I see my death, but I hasten my steps towards it...\" It appears in schoolbooks for grades 5, 6, 7, and 12. The illustration below of a dead child appearing in a textbook published in September 2001, teaches the children to identify a child as the one who is yearning death.\n\n1. \"The Shahid\" in Four Different Grades' Curricula\n\n\"I shall carry my soul in my palm\n\nAnd toss it into the abyss of destruction...\n\nAnd then, either life, gladdening friends,\n\nOr death, enraging the enemies.\n\nBy your life! I see my death,\n\nBut I hasten my steps towards it...\n\nBy your life! This is the death of men\n\nAnd who asks for a noble death - here it is...\" [Our Arabic Language for 5th grade, p. 60, Our Beautiful Language for 6th grade, section 1, p. 47, Our Beautiful Language for 7th grade, section 1, p. 97, Arabic Language Improvement Guide for 12"
