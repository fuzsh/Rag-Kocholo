        "text": "When Matthew Settle separated from his wife, Naama Nativ, fellow Gossip Girl cast member Kelly Rutherford could empathize, being in the middle of a divorce herself.\n\n“He’s going through his own thing, I’m going through my own thing – we kind of just support each other,” she told reporters at this week’s premiere of the new film Life.\n\nAnd the biggest form of support? Bonding over their kids.\n\n“We both have small children that we really love, so we both just talk about them the whole time,” says Rutherford, who is mom to Hermes, 3, and Helena, 8 months.\n\n“Matthew was saying that his baby daughter, [Aven Angelica, 1], just took her first steps the other day, and he was kind of teary-eyed about it, it was just beautiful.”\n\nPLAY DATE: Matthew and Kelly last fall.\n\nRutherford’s three-year-old son is definitely keeping her on her toes: “The other day my son had had way too many M&Ms, and I said. ‘Alright, now that’s enough.”\n\n“And he says, ‘Mommy, just a few more.’ And I go, ‘Okay, how about just three more because you’re three?’ He says, ‘No, Mommy, I want as many as you are old!'”\n\n“I was like, ‘Honey, they don’t make a packet of M&Ms big enough!'”\n\nAs for the question we’re all thinking about … is it possible that against all odds, the pair who portray Rufus and Lily on Gossip Girl could, in real life, just maybe …\n\n“[Dating] is not really my focus at the moment,” Kelly says. “If it happens, great, but I have the two most beautiful little ones, a great job, and it’s all-consuming.”"
