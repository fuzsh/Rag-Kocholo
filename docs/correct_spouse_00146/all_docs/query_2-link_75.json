        "text": "TMZ has posted a \"blow-by-blow\" account of Chris Brown's alleged assault on Rihanna in what the site says are Los Angeles police documents in the case.\n\nAccording to the documents, the incident took place after Rihanna noticed a three-page text message from another woman on Brown's phone.\n\nThe couple, who were driving in Los Angeles, started arguing, then Brown became violent, the detective's notes say.\n\nAmong the allegations in the documents:\n\n• Brown stopped the vehicle and tried to force Rihanna out, but he couldn't because she had on her seat belt.\n\n• Once he started driving again, Brown shoved Rihanna's head against the passenger-side window, then started punching her with his right hand while continuing to steer with his left. The punches left her mouth filled with blood that splattered on her clothes and onto the vehicle's interior. At one point he said, \"I'm going to beat the [expletive] out of you when we get home! You wait and see!\"\n\n• During the assault, Rihanna faked a phone call to her assistant, telling the woman she was on her way home and to \"make sure the cops are there when I get there.\" Brown, believing the call was real, said \"You just did the stupidest thing ever! Now I'm really going to kill you!\"\n\n• Brown put Rihanna in a headlock, and she almost lost consciousness.\n\n• He bit her twice -- once on the ear while choking her and once on her fingers as she tried to free herself. While trying to protect herself from his repeated blows to her face, she was hit on her arms, legs -- even her feet.\n\nThe assault ended after Rihanna started screaming for help and Brown got out of the car and walked away, according to the documents. A person who heard Rihanna's screams called 9-1-1, the posted documents say.\n\nBrown, who was charged Thursday on felony counts of assault likely to cause bodily injury and making criminal threats, could get anything from probation to more than four years in prison if convicted, the Associated Press reported. He appeared briefly in court. His arraignment was postponed until April.\n\nRobin Williams to have heart surgery\n\nA publicist said the actor/comedian is postponing all performances of his one-man show \"Weapons of Self-Destruction\" to have an aortic valve replaced. The tour is expected to resume in the fall.\n\n\"I'm so touched by everyone's support and well wishes,\" Williams, 57, said in a statement. \"This tour has been amazing fun and I can't wait to get back out on the road after a little tune-up.\"\n\nWilliams had announced earlier this week that he was canceling some shows after experiencing shortness of breath.\n\nJewel, Nancy O'Dell quit 'Dancing'\n\nInjuries have forced both women to pull out of \"Dancing with the Stars,\" just days before the show's eighth season begins on ABC. Jewel has stress fractures just below her knees and is expected to heal in six to nine weeks, the singer said. O'Dell, who co-hosts \"Access Hollywood,\" has a torn knee cartilage and will need surgery, the Associated Press reports.\n\n• Speculation has already begun about who might replace the two women, with Us reporting that reality star Holly Madison of \"Girls Next Door\" will move into Jewel's spot.\n\n• Meanwhile, the show's producers may rethink rehearsal policies in light of the two dropouts.\n\nBrad Pitt, star lobbyist\n\nAfter a private meeting with President Barack Obama at the White House earlier Thursday, Brad Pitt left congressional staffers and tourists gasping and screaming at the U.S. Capitol. People crammed the halls of the complex to get a glimpse of Pitt, who met with lawmakers including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nPitt's topic of conversation was Make it Right, his campaign to help rebuild New Orleans' Lower 9th Ward with affordable, environmentally sustainable homes. He wants to nationalize the program, a source told the Associated Press.\n\nWork and play\n\nWhile Pitt was lobbying, partner Angelina Jolie was also in Washington, apparently having fun on the set of her new movie, Salt.\n\nVaughn engaged\n\n\"Wedding Crashers\" star Vince Vaughn will soon marry Canadian Realtor Kyla Weber, 29, the father of the future bride says.\n\nNew baby for Settle\n\n\"Gossip Girl\" star Matthew Settle and wife Naama Nativ, 25, an actress, have a new daughter, Aven Angelica."
