        "text": "It’s a girl!\n\nCongratulations are in order for Gossip Girl star Matthew Settle, 45, as he welcomed another little girl into his life earlier this week.\n\nTaking to Instagram to introduce the cutie he captioned the image “Delfino bambino”, pretty apt considering the little girl is wearing a very cute dolphin printed swimsuit.\n\nMatthew’s girlfriend Maria Alfonsin gave birth to the little girl who the couple have named Nalu.\n\nMatthew also posted plenty of snaps of Maris flaunting her amazing post-baby body in a tiny blue two piece as the family enjoyed their holiday.\n\nMatthew has another daughter, Aven Angelica who was born in 2009.\n\nHe and actress and model Naama Nativ eloped in 2006 and welcomed the little girl three years later. In 2011 the pair divorced but now Aven is a big sister to a very sweet little Nalu.\n\nSince Gossip Girl ended in 2012, Matthew has remained close with his co-stars. In particular he has been very outspoken about Kelly Rutherford’s custody battle.\n\nThe bitter fight between she and her ex-husband is ongoing and just last week a federal hudge in the U.S denied her last-minute attempt to being her children back to America.\n\nAccording to Us Weekly it was actually Kelly herself that broke the news that Matthew and Maria were expecting their first baby, as Matthew had never actually announced the news.\n\nWe have all been positively obsessed since Blake Lively recently gave birth to her daughter, but it seems that another Gossip Girl star has some big baby news to share, too.\n\nMatthew Settle, aka Rufus Humphrey, is about to become a dad for the second time, apparently. The star is reportedly expecting his first child with his girlfriend, Maria Alfonsin.\n\nIn a very Gossip Girl-esque way to break the news, it was his former co-star Kelly Rutherford (who played Lily on the show) who accidentally let it slip to the media.\n\nKelly was listing off the celebrities who are due to appear and speak at her upcoming charity event when she blurted out Matthew’s big news.\n\nKelly said: “Marcia Cross, Ed Westwick, Vivica Fox, Selma Blair, and Lisa Rinna are all hosting. And Marianne Williamson and Lisa Bloom are speaking. I’m hoping Matthew can make it. He’s getting ready to have a baby, so I don’t know.”\n\nWhile Matthew has yet to confirm the news on his social media accounts or through a representative, we’re sure he won’t be too annoyed at Kelly’s slip of the tongue.\n\nThe star is already dad to a six-year-old daughter, Aven, from his previous marriage to model Naama Nativ.\n\nWhat lovely news for the star. Congratulations!\n\nIt looks like this Gossip Girl romance is back on!\n\nYes, Kelly Rutherford and Matthew Settle look like they may be officially an item again!\n\nFollowing the breakdown of their respective marriages, by 2012 the couple were said to be in a relationship and were spotted kissing.\n\nHowever, things went quiet from then on…until now that is.\n\nOver the past two weeks Kelly and Matthew have been sharing cute photos of themselves together on their Instagram accounts – Kelly’s with a little heart as a caption.We really hope these two are together and not just (very) good friends as they are officially the cutest!\n\nKelly could use some good news after a judge sent her children to live with their father in France back in August.\n\nThe mum-of-two is reported to have filed an appeal against the ruling, deeming the decision \"unconstitutional\": \"The children have a fundamental right to reside in their own country and the loss of fundamental rights even for a brief period is irreparable.\""
