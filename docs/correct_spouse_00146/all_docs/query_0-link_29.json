Did you see also other movies/series with him. I can especially recommend \"Band of Brothers\" and \"Into the West\"\n\n__________________\n\nIsrael is HOT\n\nhttp://israelistars.tumblr.com/\n\nElite Fan\n\nJoined: Aug 2005\n\nPosts: 40,009\n\nI haven't seen any...\n\nRufus was looking good in the last two episodes\n\nNow I have to wait 2 weeks like the rest of you\n\n__________________\n\nGot a screamin' feelin'\n\nNeed a little lovin' healin'\n\nLoyal Fan\n\nJoined: Oct 2007\n\nPosts: 1,232\n\nOnly 2 weeks? I thought me must wait 3 weeks?\n\nHave you seen the new pics on set? Loved him!\n\nI can really recommend all movies/series with him. He was also Kitty's first boyfriend in \"Brothers and Sisters\". I loved \"Jonathan\", but it was an ungrateful role\n\n__________________\n\nIsrael is HOT\n\nhttp://israelistars.tumblr.com/\n\nElite Fan\n\nJoined: Aug 2005\n\nPosts: 40,009\n\n2 weeks, 13 days to be exact\n\nNo I haven't seen them, I'll go to the pic thread right now\n\n__________________\n\nGot a screamin' feelin'\n\nNeed a little lovin' healin'\n\nLoyal Fan\n\nJoined: Oct 2007\n\nPosts: 1,232\n\nyou think pink, that's great. Although I don't like the spoilers so much I love to see Matt on screen again.\n\nAnd I hope his new movie \"Ex-Terminators\" will come soon in our theaters\n\n__________________\n\nIsrael is HOT\n\nhttp://israelistars.tumblr.com/\n\nLoyal Fan\n\nJoined: Oct 2007\n\nPosts: 1,232\n\n(thx for thinking on Matt )\n\nYeah, I'm also so excited an hope I can see it. Did you see \"The Express\"? Matt is credited there as President Kennedy ( ). But I'm asking me how big this role was? I mean, is it worth to watch it?\n\n14 days till the new Settle girl...\n\nBTW this is my little Matt Fanpage. Only little and a free page. Don't expect so much, I have NO Html knowledge so... but its with love.\n\nHome - Matthew Settle Fanpage\n\n__________________\n\nIsrael is HOT\n\nhttp://israelistars.tumblr.com/\n\nElite Fan\n\nJoined: Aug 2005\n\nPosts: 40,009\n\nQuote:\n\nbut its with love\n\nThat's what counts right?\n\nI'll have to look at his IMBd page, because I didn't even know about him before I started watching Gossip Girl\n\n__________________\n\nGot a screamin' feelin'\n\nNeed a little lovin' healin'\n\nLoyal Fan\n\nJoined: Oct 2007\n\nPosts: 1,232\n\nYeah that counts. And professional pages have also so much hacker and server problems... So what, I hope Matt would like it if he knows it.\n\nYes, there are many good things with him, especially \"Band of Brothers\" and \"Into the West\". \"Beneath\" is a very good thriller, \"Rancid\" is even better. And \"Attraction\"... no comment -it's pure hotness\n\n__________________\n\nIsrael is HOT\n\nhttp://israelistars.tumblr.com/\n\nElite Fan\n\nJoined: Aug 2005\n\nPosts: 40,009\n\nI'll definitely will take a look at B of B. I have heard that that is a really good one\n\nQuote:\n\nSo what, I hope Matt would like it if he knows it.\n\nHe'll love it, it's a fan dedicating it to him, so he'll be honored\n\nETA: I just found out he was in ER for 5 episodes\n\n__________________\n\nGot a screamin' feelin'\n\nNeed a little lovin' healin'\n\nLoyal Fan\n\nJoined: Oct 2007\n\nPosts: 1,232\n\nyeah, but he played there a guy who hits his wife lol... But he could play really everything. And I'm glad that he can work now also in comedys like \"Ex-Terminators\".\n\nAwww, I loved Speirs in \"Band of Brothers\". He was also a little bit evil, but a real hero\n\nI wish Rufus could have a little bit Speirs inside him\n\n__________________\n\nIsrael is HOT\n\nhttp://israelistars.tumblr.com/"
