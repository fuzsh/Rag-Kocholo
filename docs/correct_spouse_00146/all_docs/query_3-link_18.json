        "text": "One of the members of the Gossip Girl cast is getting ready for a baby in real life – and no, it’s not Blake Lively or Leighton Meester.\n\nAlthough he’s a bit unlucky in love on Gossip Girl, Matthew Settle and his wife, actress-model Naama Nativ, are expecting their first child!\n\nAccording to Life & Style Weekly, the actor shouted it from the rooftops at the EMM Group Estate in New York’s Hamptons on August 16.\n\n“[Matthew Settle] was sitting on a golf cart with Naama waiting to be taken up the driveway to the Estate, and just blurted it out,” says a partygoer.\n\n“He seemed so incredibly pumped about it, and Naama was glowing. Even though Matthew had to mingle with his cast-mates and the show’s producers during the party, he was so attentive to her. It was sweet.”\n\nCongratulations to Matthew Settle and Naama Nativ-Settle!"
