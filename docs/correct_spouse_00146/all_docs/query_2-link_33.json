And Marianne Williamson and Lisa Bloom are speaking. I’m hoping Matthew can make it. He’s getting ready to have a baby, so I don’t know.”\n\nThis will be the first child for the couple, while Matthew is already dad to six-year-old daughter Aven from his first marriage, to model Naama Nativ.\n\nNeither Matthew nor his representative have commented on the news as of yet.\n\nCongratulations to the couple and their family."
