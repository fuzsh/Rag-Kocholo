        "text": "Storm\n\nDetectives Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Chris Meloni) aggressively pursue a child molester who kidnapped three young sisters from New Orleans after their parents were killed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina -- but their efforts to secretly locate the third child are compromised by an ambitious reporter. However, a far greater problem looms as the New York cops butt heads with federal authorities after the suspect is discovered to have deadly anthrax that could result in a full-blown epidemic. Dann Florek, Ice-T, Richard Belzer, Diane Neal, B.D. Wong and Tamara Tunie also star.\n\nYes, Then Zero\n\nSerena loves her new job in Hollywood, but makes a costly misstep when she tries to impress her boss. Chuck and Nate arrive in Los Angeles as the last stop of their Lost Summer trip, joining Serena at a glamorous Hollywood Hills party, where Nate meets a sexy older woman. Blair and Louis return from Monaco and begin planning their royal wedding, but when Louis refuses to stand up to his family and support Blair's choices, his weakness threatens their relationship. A magazine is planning to run an excerpt of Dan's book until an unlikely ally steps in to help him kill the story.\n\nA Simple Twist of Fate\n\nWith their baby daughter still fighting for her life, Greene and Corday argue after she orders Rachel out of their home. Abby regrets championing her battered neighbor, Joyce who refuses to charge her husband, Brian with abuse. Tainted snacks cause food poisoning among several staffers. Carter confronts his mother, Eleanor , over issues of emotional abandonment and gets a surprise visit from his father, Jack. The emergency room team treats an elderly swimmer with heart problems, a fearful 15-year-old girl with vaginal bleeding, a recent lottery winner who was unlucky enough to have been stabbed by a falling icicle and a diminutive stripper, Ginger who accidentally swallowed a customer's wedding ring."
