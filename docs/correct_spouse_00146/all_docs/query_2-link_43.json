        "text": "_\n\nWe miss the original \"Gossip Girl,\" the soapy CW show filled with prep school scandal, juicy relationship drama and, of course, killer fashion! Wonderwall.com is checking up on all the actors who played the posh Upper East Side elite on the original series to find out what they're doing and what they look like these days… starting with this actor who celebrates his 35th birthday on June 27, 2022… Birthday boy Ed Westwick starred on \"Gossip Girl\" as Chuck Bass, the not-to-be-trusted schemer who was often lacking in the morals department though loved Blair Waldorf desperately.\n\nKeep reading to see Ed — plus all the other actors and actresses from the original show then and now…\n\nRELATED: Sebastian Stan and more stars you forgot were on the original \"Gossip Girl\"\n\n_\n\nEd Westwick took the plunge and moved from New York City to Los Angeles after \"Gossip Girl\" ended. The British actor famously dated co-star Jessica Szohr until 2010 and split from model Jessica Serfaty in 2018 after more than a year together. He was linked to model Tamara Francesconi from 2019 to 2021 and actress Amy Jackson, a British Bollywood star and former Miss Teen World, in 2022. He's continued to act since hanging up his Chuck Bass scarves — he starred on the BBC's \"White Gold\" from 2017 to 2019 and more recently appeared in the 2021 film \"Me, You, Madness.\" In 2021, he starred on the crime-comedy podcast series \"The Bystanders\" and in 2022, he started production on the shark-thriller film \"Deep Fear.\"\n\nRELATED: \"Gilmore Girls\" cast: Where are they now?\n\n_\n\nTaylor Momsen starred on \"Gossip Girl\" as Jenny Humphrey, aka Little J — Dan Humphrey's younger sister.\n\nRELATED: Iconic teen show villains\n\n_\n\nIt's been all about the music for Taylor Momsen since she left \"Gossip Girl.\" In 2014, the rocker released her second album, \"Going to Hell,\" with her band The Pretty Reckless. She made history the same year when they became the first female-fronted band to reach No. 1 on the rock radio charts with their first two singles. The Pretty Reckless released third album \"Who You Selling For\" in 2016 and their fourth, \"Death by Rock and Roll\" in 2021. Taylor opened up to People magazine the same month to explain the delay in releasing new music. \"Before [coronavirus] quarantine started, I'd intentionally spent the past few years isolated,\" Taylor said, explaining that she took a big step back from the spotlight after Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell's 2017 death — her band was opening for his at the time — and descended further into grief after learning her longtime producer and friend Kato Khandwala had died after a motorcycle accident less than a year later. \"I went into this hole of just utter depression and substance abuse. I was in a very unhealthy space.\" Working on her band's latest album pulled her out of it. \"I'd given up on life, but then I turned to music,\" she told People. \"It saved me.\" In March 2022, Taylor attended the iHeartRadio Music Awards where E! News asked if she'd consider returning to acting 10 years after \"Gossip Girl.\" \"I never say never anymore in life, especially now with all the curveballs the world is throwing everyone,\" Taylor said during what was her first red carpet appearance in five years, \"But no immediate plans.\"\n\n_\n\nPenn Badgley starred on \"Gossip Girl\" as Dan Humphrey, the down-to-earth Brooklyn writer-type who never quite fit in with all of the Upper East Siders — although dating Serena van der Woodsen certainly upped his status a bit. Spoiler alert: At the end of the series, \"Lonely Boy\" Dan revealed himself to be the elusive Gossip Girl blogger who'd been exposing everyone's secrets for years.\n\n_\n\nMuch to \"Gossip Girl\" fans' joy, Penn Badgley dated co-star Blake Lively off-screen for a few years until 2010. He then had an on-off romance with Zoe Kravitz before linking up with Domino Kirke in 2014. The couple married in 2017 and in 2020 welcomed their first child together, a boy. Aside from continuing to act, Penn has showed off his music skills as the lead singer of the band MOTHXR, who released their debut album in 2016. As for his latest acting work? Penn has been starring as the creepy yet captivating Joe on the thriller series \"You.\" The Netflix show debuted its third season in October 2021 and has been renewed for a fourth.\n\n_\n\nBlake Lively starred on \"Gossip Girl\" as Serena van der Woodsen, a popular and pretty Constance Billard School socialite who tried to hide her mysterious past after returning from a stint away at boarding school.\n\n_\n\nBlake Lively tied the knot with Ryan Reynolds just before \"Gossip Girl\" wrapped its final season in late 2012. The hot Hollywood couple welcomed their first child, daughter James, in 2014. Their second daughter, Inez, arrived in 2016 and their third little girl, Betty, was born in 2019. Though Blake in 2015 shut down Preserve, the lifestyle and e-commerce website she unveiled in 2014, she launched another business venture in 2021: Betty Buzz, a refreshing non-alcoholic mixer beverage with only clean ingredients. She's also, of course, kept busy with acting work. In recent years she's starred in 2015's \"The Age of Adaline,\" 2016's \"Cafe Society\" and \"The Shallows,\" 2017's \"All I See Is You,\" 2018's \"A Simple Favor\" and 2020's \"The Rhythm Section.\" Next up, she'll star in the thriller \"The Husband's Secret.\"\n\n_\n\nLeighton Meester starred on \"Gossip Girl\" as super-snobby Blair Waldorf, the perfectionist teen who held the highest social rank at the all-girls Constance Billard School. She was also Serena van der Woodsen's BFF.\n\n_\n\nLeighton Meester married actor Adam Brody and starred in the film \"Life Partners\" with him in 2014. That same year, she tried her hand at the music biz with the release of her very first album, \"Heartstrings.\" More recently, she starred on ABC's \"Single Parents\" and in 2022, she returned to movies with Netflix's \"The Weekend Away\" and television on \"How I Met Your Father.\" In September 2015, Leighton and Adam welcomed their first child together, daughter Arlo Day, and in 2020, they added a baby boy to their family.\n\n_\n\nChace Crawford starred on \"Gossip Girl\" as hunky lacrosse player Nate Archibald, the object of both Serena van der Woodsen and Blair Waldorf's affections.\n\n_\n\nChace Crawford appeared on the ABC primetime soap opera \"Blood and Oil\" in 2015 but the show ended after only 10 episodes. He then found a hit show on Amazon Prime: He's been starring on \"The Boys\" since 2019. He and \"Blood and Oil\" co-star Rebecca Rittenhouse split in 2019 after several years of dating.\n\n_\n\nJessica Szohr starred on \"Gossip Girl\" as edgy Brooklynite Vanessa Abrams, Dan Humphrey's aspiring-filmmaker ex-girlfriend.\n\n_\n\nAfter \"Gossip Girl,\" Jessica Szohr starred on \"Complications\" for one season before it was canceled. She's since gone on to appear on a few episodes of \"Kingdom\" and did a stint on \"Shameless\" from 2017 until 2018. More recently, Jessica was in the cast of the sci-fi FOX show \"The Orville.\" She has two films on the way: \"The Best Worst Christmas Ever\" and \"All-Star Weekend.\" In 2021, the actress gave birth to her first child with Nashville Predators hockey star Brad Richardson, to whom she got engaged in 2022. In January 2022, she launched the \"Gossip Girl\"-centric podcast \"XOXO.\"\n\n_\n\nMichelle Trachtenberg starred on \"Gossip Girl\" as manipulative Georgina Sparks, who was always stirring up trouble among the group.\n\n_\n\nMichelle Trachtenberg's career has cooled down a bit since \"Gossip Girl,\" though she starred in \"The Scribbler\" in 2014. More recently, she voiced a character on Facebook Watch's \"Human Kind Of\" in 2018. Little is known about her personal life and romantic relationships these days, but in 2021, she made headlines when she stood in solidarity with former \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" co-star Charisma Carpenter after the \"Angel\" actress publicly accused the show's creator, Joss Whedon, of abuse and creating a toxic work environment. Michelle also spoke out, publicly accusing Joss of \"not appropriate behavior….very. Not. Appropriate\" when she was a teen actress on the cult-hit series.\n\n_\n\nKelly Rutherford starred on \"Gossip Girl\" as divorcée Lily van der Woodsen, Serena's socialite mother.\n\n_\n\nKelly Rutherford made headlines for years as she battled her ex-husband, German businessman Daniel Giersch, for custody of their kids Hermes and Helena beginning in 2009. After being allowed to spend the summer of 2015 with the children in New York City, Kelly was ordered by a judge to return them to their father in Monaco after she initially refused to let them fly home. In late 2015, a judge awarded Daniel full custody — though Kelly can visit them in France and Monaco. The headline-making case was so expensive for the actress that she filed for bankruptcy in 2013. On the work front, she's taken on a few guest roles in recent years on shows including \"Reckless,\" \"The Mysteries of Laura\" and \"Quantico.\" In 2018, she landed a role on the reboot of \"Dynasty,\" on which she starred through 2019.\n\n_\n\nConnor Paolo starred on \"Gossip Girl\" as Eric van der Woodsen, Serena's sweet, level-headed younger brother.\n\n_\n\nConnor Paolo went straight from \"Gossip Girl\" to another hit TV series, \"Revenge,\" on which he starred until 2013. He appeared in the 2016 horror film \"Friend Request\" and more recently popped up on a 2020 episode of the FOX series \"The Resident.\"\n\n_\n\nMatthew Settle starred on \"Gossip Girl\" as Rufus Humphrey, Dan Humphrey's former rock star dad who eventually ends up marrying old flame Lily van der Woodsen.\n\n_\n\nMatthew Settle and girlfriend Maria Alfonsin had their first child, daughter Nalu, in 2015. He also has a daughter, Aven, from his first marriage to model Naama Nativ (Aven is seen here with Matthew and Maria). As for his acting? He starred in the 2014 horror movie \"Ouija\" and in 2016 guest starred on \"Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders.\" His last credit was in 2017's \"Valentine.\""
