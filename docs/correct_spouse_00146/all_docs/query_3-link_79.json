        "text": "What is happening to Gossip Girl? I enjoyed the eighth episode of the third season – The Grandfather Part II – because the plot seems to make things more exciting, thanks to the rekindled rivalry between S and B and to William Van der Bilt’s intrigues. The downside is that Lily is shown in one scene only, what a disappointment! On the other hand, I’ve found some juicy stills from the next episode, but I’ll post them next week.\n\nThe scene is set in Lily’s sitting room, where Jenny is recovering from a (swine?) flu and where Dan, Olivia and Rufus are playing scrabble. Lily is seen with her beloved white tea cup and saucer in her hand. Have you noticed she’s often holding a cup and saucer in her hands? She’s Lady GaGa‘s Upper East Side version!\n\nIt’s refreshing to see her wearing a cute patterned skirt and an Alberta Ferretti short-sleeved sweater. She looks very elegant but informal at the same time.\n\nShe’s sporting her trademark updo and a subtle make-up.\n\nHere is a close-up on the grey sweater, which has a jeweled neckline. The sparkles from the neckline emphasize the diamond stud earrings, the only pieces of jewellery she’s wearing.\n\nDue to the lack of candids from the set of Gossip Girl, here are some super-cute pics of Kelly and Matthew Settle (who plays the role of Rufus in the show), who went to the Old Navy’s Urban Pumpkin Patch in the Meatpacking district, in New York, just before Halloween. You know I love pumpkins, so I couldn’t resist in posting these.\n\nOMG. Aren’t the little girls absolutely adorable? Matthew is posing with her 8-month-old Aven Angelica [1] and Kelly with her 4-month-old Helena Grace. It’s funny that both children were born in the same year, just a few months apart. Kelly’s outfit is chic as usual: she was wearing skinny jeans, brown boots, a slate grey jacket, a white shirt and a flowy grey pashmina. She was also wearing one of her favourite watches, Hermès H Hour watch.\n\nI love the first pic above: it could come from the set of a romantic movie set in New York, couldn’t it?\n\nMy heart melts in front of this pic: Aven is such a cutie, with her denim jacket, pink overalls and pink shoes with white pom-pons!\n\nWhat are your impressions about the eighth episode of Gossip Girl? Did you enjoy it or do you think the show is getting boring?\n\n[1] Matthew is married to the model/actress Naama Nativ."
