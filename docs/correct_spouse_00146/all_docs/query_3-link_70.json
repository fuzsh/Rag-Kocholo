I missed you so much! Great to see you (and finally our Matt Power again!) and I hope you had a funny time?\n\nThanks so much for the song, its a great idea!\n\nJust made a New Year Vid for Gossip Girl, its also much Rufly there (and much Chair), so I guess it fits also in this thread. I hope you'll like it\n\nYouTube - Happy New Year, Gossip Girl Fans!\n\n__________________\n\nIsrael is HOT\n\nhttp://israelistars.tumblr.com/\n\nPart-Time Fan\n\nJoined: Nov 2008\n\nPosts: 138\n\nActually, it will be a boring new year here at home, with my father, her girlfriend, my brother and my grandparents, who are not feeling well I might add. I wanted to spend it with my cousin and uncle cause they're hilarious, but it won't happen......so I'm sad about it. And after the dinner, I don't know if I'll be able to meet my friends cause don't know if my dad will let me.\n\nAnyway, I'm too obsessed with Kate Winslet's movies and I want to watch almost all of her movies, cause they're brilliant!!I hope she gets an oscar next year cause otherwise it'd be a robbery.\n\nHey, next week we'll see GG new episode, so cool!\n\nLoyal Fan\n\nJoined: Oct 2007\n\nPosts: 1,232\n\nO, I'm sorry for you! But I hope you have at least a good night. I will not so much celebrate, I love the Christmas days more.\n\nYeah, only a few days! I'm so excited, finally Matt again and I hope he'll get more,much more screentime.\n\n*lol* I'm now a Video junkie, I made a new Musicvid with Naama and Matt, its such a wonderful song of Ofra Haza.\n\nYouTube - Matthew Settle & Naama Nativ Settle: Love Letter\n\nBTW: thanks so much for you lovely comment on my New Year vid\n\n__________________\n\nIsrael is HOT\n\nhttp://israelistars.tumblr.com/"
