        "text": "Cutie! Matthew Settle and his girlfriend, Maria Alfonsin, have welcomed a daughter named Nalu. The proud second-time dad posted an adorable photo of his daughter and ladylove on Instagram on Thursday, Aug. 20.\n\nThe Gossip Girl alum, 45, kept mum that he was expecting another child (Settle is also dad to 6-year-old daughter Aven with ex-wife Naama Nativ). It was his good friend and former costar Kelly Rutherford who spilled the beans.\n\nWhile talking about the guest list for her Children’s Justice Campaign event this past May, Rutherford, who is engaged in an ongoing custody battle with her ex-husband, Daniel Giersch, over their two children, let slip that Settle was expecting a baby with Alfonsin.\n\n\"I'm hoping Matthew can make it. He's getting ready to have a baby, so I don't know,” she let slip to Us."
