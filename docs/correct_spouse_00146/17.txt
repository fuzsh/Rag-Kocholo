Matthew Settle

A representative for Matthew Settle has shot down reports the actor is romancing his Gossip Girl screen wife Kelly Rutherford following the breakdown of his marriage.

Settle split from model wife Naama Nativ last month (Feb10), and branded the break-up a "tragedy".

America's Star magazine claimed he had found comfort in the arms of Rutherford, who is currently embroiled in a number of bitter court battles with her estranged husband.

A source told the publication that Rutherford and Settle "were all over each other" at a recent party in New York and "now that they're single, they're going for it!"

But Settle's representative has refuted the claims, telling GossipCop the report is "not correct at all".
