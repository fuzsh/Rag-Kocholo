Sad news from the world of Gossip Girl today, but we hope it’s ultimately for the best. Matthew Settle and his wife Naama Nativ are splitting up.

After weeks of rumors, the actor confirmed the breakup with his spouse of four years, and with whom he welcomed a baby girl just last year.

“It’s true and we are working on that,” the actor who plays Rufus Humphrey said. “Things happen in life and you just have to roll with it.”

“I wish things could be better, but our focus is our daughter.”

The 40-year-old and his 26-year-old wife welcomed daughter Aven Angelica Settle in March. Despite his single status, Settle isn’t exactly on the scene.

“I’m not. I’m not adjusted yet,” he told OK!.”I’m still working on that, but it’s always a tragedy when things happen, and that’s all I can say.”
