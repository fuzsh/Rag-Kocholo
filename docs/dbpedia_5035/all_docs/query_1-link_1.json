Their resources were invaluable for this research. I am also grateful to the other ­libraries at which the research for this book was conducted, especially the ­Biblioteca nazionale in Rome, La Sapienza University in Rome, Roma Tre ­University, the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan, the Pontificia Università Gregoriana, and the Cineteca di Bologna. The librarians (especially Zbig Gas) at the University of Birmingham deserve special mention. I wish to express my gratitude to the University of Birmingham for awarding me research leave to complete the first draft of this book, and to Trinity ­College, Dublin, for allowing me the time and mental space to bring the book to ­completion. My warmest thanks go to everyone at the Department of Italian Studies in Birmingham and at my new department at Trinity for their encouragement and interest. Finally, I take this opportunity to remember all those who have been close to me throughout this project. My father deserves special mention here: the many, often provocative, discussions we had on religion and politics over the years stirred, and kept alive, my curiosity about the role and place of religion in contemporary society. Cath for everything, my mother, my sister Shirley and brother Neill, Patrick, and my friends in Italy, Ireland, and the UK have all been patient, ­supportive, and wise. A small part of the material in this volume appeared earlier in the ­following publications: “Post-Secular Identity in Contemporary Italian Cinema: ­Nostalgia for Catholic Values and the Suppression of History,” Modern Italy 22.2 (2017); “Dissenso, potere e Chiesa cattolica nell’Italia contemporanea: un impegno anti-cattolico?,” in W.H. Hope, S. Serra, and L. d’Arcangeli, Un nuovo cinema politico italiano?

There is perhaps no more shocking and iconic ending anywhere in the Italian cinema of the third millennium than Nanni Moretti’s closing scene to Habemus Papam (2011). In St Peter’s Square in Rome a sea of people waits expectantly for their new pope to appear. Flags wave, cardinals smile, all raise their eyes to the Vatican balcony. In a scene that was to anticipate Pope Benedict XVI’s standing down a few years later, the newly elected pope (Michel Piccoli) appears and announces that he cannot lead the church. As he turns around and recedes from sight behind the thick red-velvet curtains, there is a palpable sense of collapse: the cheering fades, a dramatic vocal soundtrack slides down descending scales, the flags in the crowd below are lowered, bishops crumple visibly, their shoulders sagging and their heads buried in their hands. An intense disorientation overcomes them: no longer are all eyes on the pope. The grief-stricken crowds and religious leaders no longer know where to look. The final shot of the papal balcony shows all of the bishops and cardinals facing in different ­directions, a perfect visual expression of their rudderless bewilderment, their lack of unity and purpose. Motifs of descent, collapse, and disorientation dominate the mise en scène, the cinematography, and the soundtrack. In this finale, director Nanni Moretti, long the barometer for the concerns of a significant segment of Italians, provides an apocalyptic image of Italy’s main religion in the new millennium. In a single scene, he captures so many of the dominant features of religion in Italy today: the vast spectacle and power of the international Catholic faith, whose global beacon shines from the centre of the Italian peninsula; the anomaly that in Italy, a Western post-secular nation, religion still holds a significant public position; the formation of individual identity in a country dominated by a single faith; the fragility of institutional religion in post-secular society; the religious fervour among crowds of believers, despite secularization; the disorientation of humanity when deprived of\n\n4 Screening Religions in Italy\n\na collective, shared system of belief. Moreover, if one deconstructs the scene, what emerges from the shadows is the silenced face of other faiths in Italy. What is the place of these faiths in a society that is increasingly multi-religious? Moretti’s image of religious apocalypse – of collapse, disorientation, descent – sends strange r­ ipples across the sea of the contemporary Italian film industry. It both ­resonates with what is happening there and does not. What emerges from Moretti’s film is a complex and dissonant vision of ­religion in Italian society: religion is part antagonist, part protagonist; it is out of step with secularizing Italy yet deeply embedded in it; it is part of Italian identity but uneasily so; it is magnificently cinematographic yet has been contested by many in Italy’s predominantly left-wing cinema industry. Habemus Papam, made by a self-confessed atheist, signals both the depth of attachment to religion in Italy and the vulnerability of institutional religion in the contemporary world. The film presents what Catherine Wheatley (2014, 24) describes as a “confused and confusing” approach to Christianity, one that neither attacks nor supports it. She describes this as an identifying feature of contemporary post-secular European approaches to religion in cinema. Moving beyond film content, the second point that Habemus Papam so ­perfectly illustrates is that, in Italy at least, religion sells. There is still a ­market for it, and audiences still want to watch it. A film bearing a Latin title and narrating the perturbations of an imaginary octogenarian pope was the most viewed film in Italy on the day of its release (Pinchiorri 2011). This fact is ­indicative of the key role that filmic constructions of religion continue to play in Italy long after filmmakers famous for their dramatic portrayals of it – Pier Paolo P ­ asolini, Roberto Rossellini, Federico Fellini – have disappeared. An evening stroll in any of Italy’s large, twenty-first-century urban centres, in fact, takes one to arthouse cinemas screening questioning or anticlerical dramas, such as Marco Bellocchio’s L’ora di religione (My Mother’s Smile, 2002), Alice ­Rohrwacher’s Corpo celeste (Heavenly Body, 2011), and Giorgio Diritti’s Un giorno devi ­andare (There Will Come a Day, 2013). In a suburban multiplex, one might catch up with Harvey Keitel in his role in the Americanized thriller Il mercante di pietre (The Stone Merchant, Renzo Martinelli, 2006), in which radical Islam is a mortal threat to Italian masculinity. At an oratorio in a rural parish, one might stumble across screenings of films intended not just to entertain but to encourage the audience to reflect on moral and social issues. Switching on a television, one might catch one of Lux Vide’s many Catholic-oriented fictions, such as the TV film eulogizing Pope Pius XII’s work during the Holocaust, Sotto il cielo di Roma (Pius XII: Under the Roman Sky, 2010). Alternatively, one might choose an episode from the long-running detective series Don Matteo (2000–), featuring a priest in the title role, or from Paolo Sorrentino’s recent TV drama, The Young Pope (2016). In watching these, one joins record audiences of more than ten million Italians who, since the 1990s, have been sitting down\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nafter dinner to watch religious-oriented prime-time fiction. Before bedtime, Telegiornale provides the opportunity to catch up on news that often mentions the Vatican. One might hear, for example, that a prominent comic film director and actor, Roberto Benigni, had enthusiastically presented Pope Francis’s new book and excitedly predicted a return to Christianity (Giovanetti 2016). The broad diffusion of religion on the big screens of urban and rural centres as well as on the country’s small screen signals that Italy is a key religious market. It is, in fact, the second religious market, after America, among large Western countries in terms of “dynamics, intensity, and quantity” (Diotallevi 2002, 138). To cite Jacques Derrida, “to think religion is to think Roman” (1996, 4). However, if religion is deeply embedded in Italian cinema and television – and Italy, in this regard, is widely cited by sociologists, philosophers, and historians as a particularly fascinating and unique case (Diotallevi 2002; Pollard 2008) – this fact has received little attention in Italian film studies. Critical interest in religion and cinema has been rekindled in the United States in recent years, its flames fanning out from what has been described by some theorists as a “religious turn” (De Groot and Morgan 2014) and by others as a “post-secular turn” (Braidotti et al. 2014), but that interest is only rarely explored by scholars of cinema. The focus of recent critical studies of religion in filmmaking has instead been directed towards American thriller-blockbusters such as The Da Vinci Code (2006) and Angels and Demons (2009), which present speculative attacks on the Vatican, or towards controversial hagiopics such as Mel Gibson’s The Passion of the Christ (2004) and Martin Scorsese’s The Last Temptation of Christ (1988). There is also plenty of research being done on the representation of religious motifs and messages more broadly, but these are still typically centred on American filmmaking.1 More recently, interest in Islam and in the national cinemas of predominantly Islamic countries has also been increasing (see, for example, Dönmez-Collin 2004; Pak-Shiraz 2011; Ahmad 2015), 1 Two sets of approaches are easily identifiable in American film and religion criticism. The first, which strongly dominates the field, focuses on representations of religion and religious messages in filmmaking. Discussions of religious figures, themes, motifs, and scriptures indeed represent most material written in the field. This approach is found in the work of, for example, Christopher Deacy (2001), Richard Aloysius Blake (2000), Craig Detweiler (2008), and Amir Hussain (2010). Closely related to this is work that is also largely representational in approach, exploring spirituality in film (Sontag 1964; Schrader 1972; Fraser 1998; Brent Plate 2008; Di Donato 2010; Campani 2010) or presenting theological readings of film (Johnston 2007; Deacy and Williams Ortiz 2008). A second key approach, while decidedly less developed, is nonetheless significant. This second approach is centred on the policy around, and distribution of, religion in cinema. This incorporates debates that range from analyses of ­Vatican teachings, policies, and missives on cinema and media (Siniscalchi 2001; Convents and Van Beeck 2009; Williams Ortiz 2003; Malone 2009) to the mediatization of religious messages (Culture and Religion, vol. 12) and discussions of censorship and institutional power in cinema history (Biltereyst and Treveri Gennari 2015; Treveri Gennari 2011; Quicke 2010).\n\n6 Screening Religions in Italy\n\nhaving been lent impetus by the global threat presented by radical Islamic terrorist groups. By contrast, research on European religion in filmmaking is in its infancy. Some significant recent research has been published about Europe (Girlanda and Tagliabue 1988; Bradatan and Ungureanu 2015; Biltereyst and Treveri Gennari 2015); however, the field thus far is too small to balance the tide of critical works produced in the United States claiming to discuss religion and cinema in general terms, but often inadvertently using Hollywood’s construction of religion as a global prototype. That European critics discuss religion in film much less often than their American counterparts is the result of two key factors. First, the secularization myth is very strongly rooted in Europe (I will return to this later in this introduction). Consequently, European film critics have typically read religion as an unimportant “residue” (Williams 1973), so that discussions of religion in cinema are often sidelined at conferences and in publications. The second factor is that the academic field of religious studies is much better articulated in the United States than it is in Europe, and it is this field that has been ­contributing vocally to ongoing critical discussions of religion in film. The critic James ­Elkins (2004) suggests that outside departments of religious studies and ­theology, ­religion is perceived as the “undo[ing of] the project of modernism ... which is predicated on a series of rejections and refusals” (ix). Consequently, much of the work on religion and film is coming from the United States, and specifically from religious studies departments, whose work typically proposes particular research questions and whose findings are often overlooked by film scholars and cultural theorists. Nonetheless, some research has been done on Italian cinema and religion. Wide-ranging volumes on religion in cinema tend to have an international scope – for example, those by John Lyden (2010), Sergio Botta and Emanuela Prinzivalli (2010), and Pamela Grace (2009) cite some Italian films. However, these citations are often brief or refer only to the most obvious and canonical candidates from postwar Italian cinema, such as certain films by Roberto Rossellini and Pier Paolo Pasolini. Contemporary Italian cinema is rarely mentioned. As the focus of these volumes remains firmly on English-language movies, their analysis of films from outside the Anglo-American context lacks the depth and the sociocultural contextualization these films deserve. Within the field of Anglo-American film studies dedicated specifically to Italy, two volumes stand out: Daniela Treveri Gennari’s Post-War Italian Cinema: American Intervention, Vatican Interests (2009), and William Bruce Johnson’s Miracles and Sacrilege: Roberto Rossellini, the Church, and Film Censorship in Hollywood (2008). These are the only two monographs to be published in English in the last twenty years that deal specifically with religion in Italian filmmaking. Both focus on the institutional relationship between the Church and censorship, and neither one treats contemporary Italian cinema. In English-language Italian\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nfilm studies, socio-political approaches dominate and the debate on religion has been sidelined. This means that to date very little has been written in English on religion in contemporary Italian cinema. There is still no English-language, book-length study that deals with religion in contemporary Italian film, or ­indeed that deals at all with religion and film in Italy beyond the 1960s. In Italy, some books have been published that document Italian religious cinema practices and policies, such as Giuseppe Chinnici’s Cinema, Chiesa e Movimento Cattolico Italiano (2003), which traces the history of Catholic censorship, production, and distribution, although it focuses only on the period before the 1970s. Dario Viganò’s Cinema e chiesa (2002) has a broader scope and details the Church’s policies towards and responses to cinema, not just in Italy but internationally. Then there are several books written in Italian with promising titles, such as Cinema e religione (Cortellazzo and Quaglia 2008) and The Hidden God: Cinema e spiritualità (Bandy and Monda 2004) – these however are illustrated books, often produced in the context of film festivals, rather than academic discussions of the issues their titles convey. Though published in Italy, these books do not necessarily have much to say about Italian filmmaking, as their focus is broad and international. The books written and edited by Dario Viganò are among the few to deal with contemporary Italian film and religion in cinema and on television. Il prete di celluloide: Nove sguardi d’autore (2010) classifies and briefly discusses on-screen portrayals of priests in Western cinema, including some examples from Italy, and includes an appendix transcribing interviews on the subject of religion with Italian directors such as Pupi Avati and Carlo Verdone. Of all the volumes published in Italy thus far, it is Dario Viganò and Eugeni Ruggero’s third edited volume, Attraverso lo schermo: Cinema e cultura cattolica in Italia: Dagli anni Settanta ai nostri giorni (2006), that goes furthest in providing an analysis of Italy’s Catholic cinema culture between the end of the Second Vatican Council (1965) and the start of the new millenium. This is the period that attracts the least attention among critics, who prefer to deal in the pre-Vatican II relations between Church and cinema, a period when Church intervention in filmmaking was dramatic and comparatively well-documented. A couple of chapters in this volume proved interesting for my own study. Gianfranco Bettetini’s chapter, “Chiesa cattolica e cinema: Dal Sessantotto a oggi,” like some of the books mentioned above, explores the Catholic Church’s policies on cinema, but unlike most of those, Bettetini takes his analysis up to 2005. Paola Abbiezzi and Giorgio Simonelli’s chapter “Agiografia e costruzione della memoria nazionale nella fiction televisiva” (2006) assesses hagiopics on television, focusing on their productive context and on genre classification. Alberto Bourlot’s “Filmare la Bibbia: la produzione cinematografica e televisiva (dal 1968 ad oggi)” (2006) provides an overview and classification of religious-themed films. More recently, Andrea Minuz and Guido Vitiello’s edited volume La Shoah nel cinema italiano (2013) is dedicated\n\n8 Screening Religions in Italy\n\nto one of Italy’s most important minority religions and includes a chapter by Claudio Gaetani on the Shoah in contemporary films. However, once again the volume’s focus is primarily on socio-political issues rather than issues of faith and religious practice. From this brief analysis, it will be clear that most of the major work ­already done on religion in Italian cinema focuses almost exclusively on the p ­ eriod before the Second Vatican Council in 1965, and even then it typically e­ xplores either the Catholic Church’s media policy or representations of ­religious messages on film. These analyses have little to say about post-­secular Italy, about the place of the established Church in Italy’s public sphere, or about the engagement of Italian cinema with other faiths. Overall, then, the subject matter of this book – religion, cinema, and the post-secular public sphere – has not yet been the subject of any sustained academic discussion with regard to Italy. Why Religion (Still) Matters: Secularization and the Post-Secular Frame Religion has been a potent and at times even formidable force in society. It has “shaped the cultures, institutions, and maps of European states” (Barker 2009, 2). It has been instrumental in the creation of contemporary socio-political ­Europe. It has been held responsible for some of the darkest moments in recent history, from the Holocaust to jihad. Yet it has also been described as the creator of a powerful heritage of architectural and artistic works, from monasteries and cathedrals to the Vatican treasures, from paintings, sculptures, and frescos to the rich imagery and narratives on which writers and poets have drawn for centuries, and from which filmmakers to the present day still draw. In White: Essays on Race and Culture (1997, 15), Richard Dyer defines its contribution to European society in the following terms: The European feeling for self and the world has been shaped by Christianity ... If Christianity as observance and belief has been in decline over the past half-century, its ways of thinking and feeling are nonetheless still constitutive of both European culture and consciousness ... Many of the fundamentals of all levels of Western culture – the forms of parenting, especially motherhood, and sex, the value of suffering, guilt, the shock of post-enlightenment materialism – come to us from Christianity, whether or not we know the Bible story.\n\nDyer’s analysis of the importance of religion in the construction of the ­ uropean sociocultural heart is, of course, perceptive. Nonetheless, his use of E the word “decline” hints at teleological assumptions and is indicative of a current of thinking about religion known as the “secularization thesis.”\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nThe secularization thesis refers to a group of theories that argue that religion and modernity are fundamentally incompatible; thus when countries modernize, religion inevitably declines. Religion then plays a progressively less important part in society, becoming, in Raymond Williams’s words, “a residual cultural element” (1973). This thesis is not new. Rodney Stark (1999) tells us that the fall of religions had been predicted as early as 1710. However, in late-nineteenth-­ century Europe, its proponents were particularly vocal. They numbered among them some of Europe’s most powerful and seminal thinkers, including Sigmund Freud, for whom religion was a neurosis in search of a cure, and Karl Marx, who construed it as an instrument of political repression. Freud and Marx predicted that religion would decline as improvements in psychic development and in society, respectively, were achieved. They thus unequivocally yoked religion to illness (whether of the individual or society) and secularism to health. By the end of the nineteenth century, all leading social scientists, from Émile Durkheim to Georg Simmel and then Max Weber, were speaking of secularization as inevitable. As described by the proponents of secularization, the demise of religion is linear and irreversible. The roots of that demise are found in the broad social changes that have accompanied the rise of modernity. The renowned sociologist Steve Bruce (1999), one of the theory’s modern defenders, identifies three key factors that advance secularization. The first of these is rationalization. In a word, the Enlightenment, with its emphasis on rationality and science, made it more difficult to conceive of a world inhabited by miracles and spirits. As a consequence, the place of religion in explaining the world declined. Bruce then discusses differentiation. As society became increasingly specialized, large organizations like the Catholic Church lost control over spheres such as education, welfare, and ethics, which were then divided up among dedicated interest groups. His third and final point centres on “societalization.” As large-scale, global society grew, local communities declined. This negatively affected the capacity of religious institutions to work at the local, grassroots level, where they had historically been so successful. Bruce is only one of many theorists to hypothesize the causes for decline. For the early Peter L. Berger (1969), ­Protestantism was a significant causal factor in secularization. Berger contends that Protestant thought created a more individualistic and rational world, one divided into secular and sacred spaces. As the secular sphere grew, the sacred became increasingly marginalized (Berger 1969).2 For the influential C ­ anadian philosopher Charles Taylor (2007), however, humanism is a key factor. Over the years, other theorists have put forwarded diverse and wide-ranging ­hypotheses to explain secularization. These range from scientific advances and urbanization 2 Peter Berger changed his mind after the publication of his seminal book, The Sacred ­Canopy (1969). He no longer holds modernity, or even pluralism, responsible for secularization (Mathewes 2006).\n\n10 Screening Religions in Italy\n\nto individualism, consumer choice, and religious pluralism. What is evident is that, while there has been little agreement on the causes of secularization, there is general agreement among proponents of the secularization theory that modernity, in some form or another, is implicated in religion’s decline. However, towards the end of the twentieth century it became increasingly obvious that secularization had not taken place in the way that early- to mid-twentieth-century thinkers had predicted, and more nuanced analyses emerged. These led to a reconsideration of the phenomenon. Charles Taylor (2007), for instance, has drawn an important distinction between the secularization of public and private space. Regarding the former, he argues that in the contemporary Western world we “can take part fully in political life without ever meeting God,” and he claims that religion no longer has the right, or the power, to impose itself on every part of the political, economic, and social spheres. He notes, though, that secularization is far less pronounced in the private sphere. While he recognizes that we no longer inhabit an “enchanted world of spirits, demons and natural forces, where the natural world was a proof of the actions of some form of God and atheism was inconceivable” (42), he contends that religion has not disappeared. Instead, it has taken a subjective turn. For Taylor, Grace Davie’s oft-cited term “believing without belonging” (1990) now dominates the Western world. What this means is that personal spiritual quests are now taking precedence over institutional affiliation. Whether Davie’s “believing without belonging” holds for Italy is one of the critical questions this book ventures to answer. The assumption that religion is in inexorable decline has been brought into question by recent post-secular thinkers. Theorists like Rosi Braidotti and ­Jürgen Habermas note that, despite the rise of secularization in the West, ­religion has not gone away. On the contrary, at the time of writing, one of the most glaring fault lines in the contemporary world – the perceived divide ­between absolutist, extremist Islamic faith and liberal but Christian-inflected secular values – has religious traditions at its core. The political underpinnings of ­religious tensions flare up too in the American culture wars as well as in ­current conflicts like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the war in Syria, and international terrorism. Contemporary malaise regarding religion’s place in society is evident in the questioning of what constitutes Western moral and ethical ­values and in the debates over whether it is legitimate to wear a burka, sing ­carols in school, or place a crucifix in public buildings. That malaise was evident as well in the hard-fought arguments over whether religion was to be inserted into the ultimately abortive 2004 Constitution of the European Union. Rodney Stark in “Secularisation RIP” (1999) argues that religion is far from losing its grip, at least as far as personal piety is concerned, and points to the non-linear and non-universal nature of the demise of religion. Citing the example of the former Soviet Union, he also notes that secularization is far from irreversible:\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nthe suppression of religions failed to stamp them out, and they resurfaced with the fall of the communist regime. He argues that religion is not set to die out equally and everywhere: modernization and certain religions, such as Islam, appear to be compatible. The recent return of religious discourse from the margins of Western society to a decidedly more central position is a sign of what Jürgen Habermas (2006) has defined as the post-secular condition. Habermas, and other theorists in his wake, have put into question what most people in the West had, up to a few years ago, taken for granted: the unstoppable forward march of secularization and the concomitant marginalization of religion. Since 2001, several key theorists have reframed secularization in discursive terms as an “ideology” or “myth,” thus withdrawing from it truth-claims that until recently had seemed obvious, familiar, and natural. For instance, in Secularisms (2008), J­ anet R. Jacobsen and Ann Pellegrini define secularization as a myth that hitches religion to backwardness and the secular to progress and modernity, a linkage these critics contest. Moreover, in their introduction to Transformations of R ­ eligion in the Public Sphere (2014), Rosi Braidotti and colleagues, citing Tariq Modood, declare secularism an ideology and go on to specify that it is an ideology that “spells danger” for European democracy because it does not “sufficiently recogniz[e] the importance of religious and multicultural identities and their implications for active citizenship” (1). Braidotti and her co-editors present a global triptych of motivations for the post-secular. First, they cite the dominance of neoliberal values and consumerism after the fall of communism. Then they mention globalization, which has led to “strong movements of resistance in the form of resurgent nationalisms” and to a “resurgence of civilisation discourses about Western traditional values which in turn produce, once again, hierarchies of identities, cultures, and even ethnic belongings.” This has led to a “rise of a perpetual state of ‘new’ wars against terror” (6). Finally, they point to the new digital technologies, which enable new connections and allow networks, such as Islamophobic ones, to flourish. The focus of Braidotti and her colleagues tends to fall on Islam as the decisive factor in post-secularism. Tariq Modood (2014) concurs, putting forward a “triple contingency” of reasons for the change in direction of secularism in Europe. First, the arrival of Muslims, which not only brings greater numbers of religious believers to Europe but also stimulates Christian identity. Second, the contemporary multiculturalist sensibility, which respects “difference” and so enables a certain openness to religious others. Third and finally, moderate secularism, which “offers some of the resources for accommodating Muslims” (30). While there is little consensus among critics regarding how to define the post-secular condition – indeed, Modood (2014) even questions whether the post-secular is (already) in crisis – several key points emerge from the ­debates, and these will underpin my own analysis in this book. The first is that the\n\n12 Screening Religions in Italy\n\npost-secular turn presupposes that the secularization myth must be challenged and critiqued: the assumption that the secular is automatically a sign of progress and that religious practice is necessarily backward must be unpicked, and religious identity, or identities, must be acknowledged. This is important, and it informs my own theoretical approach in this book. The second is that religious mobilization must form part of any account of contemporary c­ ulture, for religion has remained, or again become, a player in the public sphere. ­Braidotti and colleagues (2014, 3) note how the “most pertinent critiques of globalization and advanced capitalisms today and of the structural injustices of globalization are voiced by religiously driven social movements.” As a ­feature of modern society, this has only increased in Catholic countries like Italy since the election of Pope Francis. Analysing the effects of religious mobilization and the efforts of religious organizations to remain visible in the public sphere is therefore essential to my own work in this book (see especially chapter 1). Finally, following ­ ­ Braidotti and colleagues, the Eurocentric founding discourses of post-secularization need themselves to be challenged. Habermas and Joseph Ratzinger (2005) first conceived of post-secularization in relation to ­Christianity. Braidotti and colleagues, and most other recent theorists of the post-secular, see it as a multiple, diverse, and multi-religious space in which Islam is an important feature. In a book written about Italy, a country in which Catholicism is the dominant religion, this means exploring and deconstructing “Catholo-centrism” as well as giving space to the peninsula’s other religions and especially its screening of Islam. Secularization and the Post-Secular in Italy: The Italian Anomaly Across Europe, the picture of post-secular society is not as homogeneous as the one posited by Rosi Braidotti, Charles Taylor, and others. While many of the trends, such as a marked secularization of the public sphere, traverse the continent, the significance of religion in both the private sphere and the public one differs substantially from nation to nation. Among all Western nations, the place of religion in Italy is especially curious. Italy’s religious exceptionality in the post-secular Western world is the result of several features that set it apart. First, and most obviously, the Italian peninsula is the headquarters of the largest religion on earth, one that boasts one and a quarter billion members. The seat of the Catholic Church has been in Rome for the greater part of two millennia. This is not without consequence. The Vatican is a place where ­Italians work: it has drawn most of its popes, cardinals and officials, secretaries, and cleaners from the local Italian population. Karol Wojtyla, elected Pope John Paul II in 1978, was the first non-Italian pope in 525 years. All of this means that for Italians, the Vatican is not a distant institution. The Vatican cupola dominates the architecture and skyline of Italy’s capital city; every day, Italians\n\nIntroduction 13\n\nmove in and out of its grounds. Moreover, the Church consolidated a C ­ atholic subculture throughout the Italian peninsula. At the start of the twentieth century, the Church developed networks of banks, publishing houses, workers’ ­unions, the Azione Cattolica, and various cultural organizations. Since then, this subculture has, according to Franco Garelli (2014), “retained its vitality and solidity” while “the country’s traditional subcultures (Communist, ­Socialist, Liberal, Republican, Right-Wing) have dissolved” (1). Thus the Vatican as an institution, together with a well-developed Catholic subculture that spans the peninsula, has long had a living, networked presence in the lives of Italians. A second anomaly is that the Vatican and the state are more evenly matched in Italy than they are in other Western countries. This has resulted in a complex rivalry. A key factor in the creation of the modern Italian state was the head-to-head confrontation between the emerging nation of Italy and the Papal States: for Italy to complete its unification, its newly formed government had to attack the Papal States, which were forced to surrender in 1871. The ensuing ­relationship between the Church and the new state was marked by power struggles over the place of religion in education, welfare, and local communities. The state attempted to reduce the Church’s powers; the Church strove to regain them. In contemporary Italy, this tension continues. The Catholic Church is no longer the established religion of Italy. As a result, in theory at least, the ­Vatican is not directly answerable to the state that encircles it, nor is the state answerable to the Church. Thus the relationship between Church and state is not marked by incorporation of the Church into the state or by submission of the Church to the state, but by independence, tension, and even rivalry ­between equal players. Given that the Church stands as a (global) counter-power to the state, the workings of power and politics are key to understanding how religion works in Italy. The peculiar rivalry between politics and the state is inscribed on the very structure of Italy’s sociocultural ecosystem. Italy’s exceptionality means that even for the most hardened defenders of the secularization thesis, there is no easy, linear tale of secularization to be told.3 The power of the Church in Italy has not steadily declined; rather, it has waxed and waned and has been surprisingly resilient. For example, even after the ­Papal States were defeated, the Church strengthened its grassroots position: local support for the Church grew as Italians mobilized against the new liberal state and set up alternatives to the rising communist subculture (Pollard 2008). U ­ nder the early years of fascism the Church lost a great deal of its temporal power, but then the Lateran Pacts of 1929 consolidated and thereby strengthened its – albeit 3 The clearest English-language history of twentieth-century relationships between church and state is John Pollard’s Catholicism in Modern Italy: Religion, Society, and Politics since 1861 (2008). Franco Garelli’s Religion Italian Style: Continuities and Changes in a Catholic Country (2014) provides an interesting analysis of why religion has the place that it does in Italian life.\n\n14 Screening Religions in Italy\n\nweakened – position.4 For more than forty years (1948–92), the ­success of the Democrazia cristiana (Christian Democrats) ensured that Catholic positions were voiced in government; even so, under its watch a number of laws were passed that countered the Catholic emphasis on the sanctity of marriage and of life.5 In 1984, even though the Christian Democrats were in power, the Church, which had been established as the state church under the Lateran Pacts, was disestablished, and other faiths began to be recognized.6 By the third millennium – the period examined in this book – Catholicism as a state religion had been abolished, the ruling Catholic postwar political party had been disbanded, and certain parts of the grassroots, subcultural network of Catholicism had died away. Moreover, several significant ­Catholic teachings on abortion, contraception, and divorce had been overturned by state legislation. The religious education hour still existed in schools but was no longer compulsory. These signs of secularization in the public sphere were compounded by a notable level of anticlerical protest on parts of the peninsula – protests that had a strong, if minority, following during the first decade of the millennium. While the Catholic Church has never been without its detractors, the annual anti-­Vatican “No-Vat” protests, contesting the continuing place of the ­Catholic Church in Italian politics, and the emergence of bitter debates around the Church’s position on LGBTQ rights and civil partnerships, saw criticism of 4 The 1929 Lateran Pacts reversed some of these trends and finally recognized and formalized the relationship between state and church, restoring some of the Vatican’s temporal power by establishing the Vatican state as sovereign, independent, and neutral and by reinstating ecclesiastical immunities and privileges; restoring some of its economic power by compensating the Vatican for losses and allowing it to purchase property again; and restoring some of its socio-political power by nominating Catholicism the state religion. While the Catholic Church had failed to create a political presence in Italy, these pacts – which are still the basis of the relationship between church and state today – restored some lost privileges and halted further erosions. 5 The laws on divorce and abortion (in 1970 and 1978 respectively) were a significant blow for the Church, as were the ensuing referendums (1974, 1981), which tried unsuccessfully to get these laws repealed. In 1971 the law forbidding propaganda in favour of contraception was declared unconstitutional. 6 In the new agreement, the phrase “the sole religion of the state” was abandoned, marking the first legal recognition of other faiths in Italy. While the Concordat gave the Church some concrete advantages, such the establishment of otto per mille funding (whereby Italians can elect to give 0.8 per cent of their income tax directly to a religious organization rather than the state), other special privileges the Church had been enjoying were ended: church property was now to be taxed; the Vatican Bank, which had been subject to scandals, was to be regulated under Italian law; and the idea of the sacred character of Rome was abolished during the same ­period. Concordats with the minority religions in Italy, while not providing them with the privileges held by the Catholic Church, formally recognized their existence on the peninsula and permitted them some degree of parity. Italy was now giving formal legal recognition to ­religions other than Catholicism – the exception being Islam, which to this day has been unable to establish a concordat for its recognition in Italy.\n\nIntroduction 15\n\nthe Church rise steeply (see chapter 4). At the same time, though, the s­ candal ­surrounding clerical sexual abuse, so widespread in the United States and ­Ireland, gained little traction in Italy, for reasons I will discuss later in this book. The year 2013 saw the election of the charismatic Pope Francis, whose conciliatory pronouncements on sexuality and profound expressions of care for the poor and the marginalized (a position that chimes with the social left in Italy) resulted in, or at least coincided with, a decline in the level of protest and a rise in the number of people attending mass (Hooper 2013). However, in 2014 ­declines in attendance resumed (ISTAT 2017). As Luca Diotellevi (2002), Franco Garelli (2014), and others note, while secularization of the public sphere has undoubtedly been growing, various ­ ­indicators demonstrate that the Catholic Church in Italy is especially tenacious. While the Catholic voice has become more fragmented since the break-up of the ruling Christian Democrats in 1992, it is far from absent in politics. ­Indeed, its ­ongoing presence is so strongly felt that it has been subject to protest (see ­chapter 4). Italy has now no major Catholic political party, but this has not stopped the Church from developing an outspoken political voice, which makes itself heard though Catholic ministers working across parliamentary parties, through the CEI (Conferenza episcopale italiana), through the pope’s interventions, and through the national and local media, which broadcast and discuss religious opinions as a matter of course. Through these and other channels, the Church has spoken out on key arguments in Italian society, from ­inequality to migration, from Italy’s part in the 2003 Iraq War to bioethics and gay rights. The result of this political intervention is that legislation on civil partnerships, on adoption rights for gay couples, on stem cell research, and on in vitro fertilization, all of which have recently been adopted across much of Europe, has met with strong resistance not just from the Vatican and clerical representatives but from Catholic parliamentarians and lobbyists. While Catholicism is overwhelmingly the religion on the peninsula, and most Italian nationals “don’t seem to contest the bond between the prevailing religious denomination and national identity” (Garelli 2004, 3) even if they do not regularly attend mass, Italy is nonetheless becoming religiously plural. ­Islam is now Italy’s second religion; according to the Pew Research C ­ entre (Hackett 2017), the country is home to an estimated 2.87 million Muslims – around 4.8 per cent of the population – as migration to Italy from countries with large Islamic populations continues. This makes Italy’s Muslim population the fourth-largest in Europe (after France, Germany, and the UK). Mosques were built in Catania (1980), Milan (1988), and Rome (1995) before a ruling made the building of further mosques in Italy unlawful. In their place, prayer houses have sprung up across the country (Saint-Blancat and Schmidt di ­Friedberg 2005), a phenomenon captured in Farborz Kamkari’s comedy Pitza e ­datteri (2015). A political voice for Islam in parliament was established in 2005 in the form of a ­consultative body (Consulta per l’Islam italiano); after initially\n\n16 Screening Religions in Italy\n\nfolding, it has recently been relaunched (Polchi 2015). Other minority religions have also been growing. The Waldensians, for example, have benefited from the political and economic recognition provided by the 1988 Concordat. Their tiny community now sees nearly a quarter of a million Italians contribute to its social work through otto per mille personal tax donations. Modood, Braidotti, and others link post-secular society with the return of religion due, in large part, to the rise of Islam; yet Italy’s Islamic community is, at the time of writing, too small and too marginal to overhaul the concept of “Italianicity.” The resistance of religion in post-secular Italy has as much to do with the survival of the dominant religion as the arrival of alternatives. From this preliminary sketch, it should be apparent that religion, in primis Catholicism, has a far greater presence in the public sphere than it does in other European countries. Catholic processions and events are still held in piazzas and streets across the country; the Church plays a role in key state ceremonies; despite heated challenges, crucifixes and religious statues are still displayed in schools and in other public buildings. The Church appoints chaplains to p ­ ublic institutions such as prisons and hospitals. It continues to own banks, publishing houses, radio stations, television stations, newspapers and magazines, and an extraordinary wealth of cultural assets. It runs its own universities and ­institutes, including the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan. It is a significant provider of health and welfare facilities and is at the forefront, claims Pollard (2008), of tackling drug abuse and managing Italy’s rapidly expanding immigrant populations. Charles Taylor’s point (2007) that we could move within the culture without ever meeting God simply does not hold for Italy. That such a powerful religious player made its headquarters on the peninsula has created, according to Carlo Falconi, a “levitical people, a nation whose essential function and raison d’être is to be in the service of the church” (cited in Pollard 2008, 186). While Falconi’s view may be overstated, the expectations and pressures placed on the Italian state and its people by the Vatican have undoubtedly resulted in a complex range of individual and national responses, ­expressed through government legislation, individual and collective protest, and cultural production. These responses have ranged from overwhelming support for official Vatican teachings right through to angry resistance. R ­ eligion in contemporary Italy is contested, multidimensional, and complex. A post-secular picture of Italians’ personal attitudes towards religion could certainly be assembled from polls such as Eurobarometer, Eurispes, and the European Values Survey, all of which point to a high level of personal belief in Italy and significant levels of church attendance, especially when compared to the European average. This picture could be made more accurate by analysing figures for the otto per mille personal contributions to the Church, which ­remain steady. It might be amplified by ethnographic, historical, and sociological comment by the likes of John Pollard and Franco Garelli. All of\n\nIntroduction 17\n\nthese are valid approaches. However, a reading of Italy’s contemporary cultural ­production – and especially Italy’s cinema, which has long been a barometer of societal change – opens a path to a particularly enlightening and nuanced understanding of the role religion plays in the public sphere. Methodology, Key Questions, and Organization of the Book This is the first book-length study to tackle the question of religion in contemporary Italian filmmaking. It addresses two questions: how Italian filmmaking reflects and constructs the continuing position of religion in the public sphere, and why religion persists on Italian screens. This book’s hypothesis is that the post-secular “subjective turn,” which results in religion leaking from public into private space, creating “believing without belonging,” may not have happened in Italy, or may have happened there only partially. This would mean that ­Italy’s post-secular experience, as reflected and constructed on screen, is itself partial. It is this hypothesis that the book will test. I will therefore be making a case for the exceptionality of religion in Italian public space and will show how the approximations of much international criticism regarding the place of religion in cinema do not hold in that country. This will help balance the many critical discussions of religion in the United States that compress the difference ­between the American and European religious experiences. I will also address a more recent problem – that publications on religion in Europe tend to compress the differences across this complex continent. Most of the chapters in Braidotti and colleagues’ important edited volume on post-secularization in the public sphere (2014) presume that a Northern European secularism of the public sphere speaks for religion in Europe as a whole. That is not the case. This book will also balance current European discussions of religion, which typically stress the rise of Islam and overlook the continuing place of indigenous religion on the continent. In so doing, I voice the concern raised by ­Cornel West in his debate with Judith Butler in The Power of Religion in the Public Sphere (Butler et al. 2011) that “some of the conceptual frameworks we have for linking secularization with modernization actually assume certain kinds of religions as the relevant ones” (104). The temporal focus of this book runs from the turn of the new millennium to the time of writing (2017). The year 2000 marks a neat watershed: it was the year of the Catholic Church’s Great Jubilee, a particularly large and significant event, centred in Rome, that marked the beginning of the third millennium of Christianity. The choice to focus on contemporary Italy rather than on mid-twentieth-century filmmakers whose names are traditionally linked to religion in film (Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio De Sica, Pier Paolo Pasolini, ­Federico Fellini) is motivated by a number of factors. First, contemporary ­Italy is facing a particularly complex set of post-secular challenges as it absorbs\n\n18 Screening Religions in Italy\n\nmany of the effects of secularization and turns to confront a multi-religious future. For a country with a historically high level of engagement with religion, the aftershocks of these changes have been particularly deep and challenging, and even traumatic. Second, in the wake of the Church’s increased intervention in political and social affairs, it is a period in which new kinds of tensions have emerged between the Catholic Church, the Italian state, and protest groups, the latter often explicitly anticlerical and/or professedly atheist. Third, it is a time in which faiths other than Catholicism have been struggling to become visible in a cinematography deeply influenced by Catholic symbology. Whether they can gain such visibility is a subject of this book. Fourth and finally, despite the distribution of important films and miniseries in the new millennium whose very titles speak of religion (Habemus Papam; Corpo celeste; L’ora di religione; The Young Pope; Si accettano miracoli; Come Dio comanda; La terra dei santi), research on religion in contemporary cinema has remained sidelined. Italian film studies has given attention to religious aspects of mid-century filmmaking, including censorship and other forms of Church intervention, but there has been little critical work on films made since 2000. It is essential, however, to make two clarifications regarding the timescale. First, by choosing to focus on the films of the new millennium, I am not suggesting there was an unexpected rupture in Italian cinematic trends in 1999. In fact, I see some lines of continuity connecting films distributed at the very end of the last century to those released at the beginning of the new one. The boundary between the films of the new and old millennium will therefore be treated with a degree of porosity. Second, while the focus of this book is firmly on the films of the new millennium, at times I have deliberately contextualized these in relation to earlier filmmaking practices, especially, as a point of contrast, with the cinema of the 1960s and 1970s, which was vocal in its challenges to the institution of the Church. Contextualizing contemporary cinema in ­relation to an earlier period of politically engaged contestation, in which highly critical views of the Church were often expressed, is crucial for gaining a historical perspective on contemporary concerns and filmmaking attitudes. This context also helps make sense of the rapid and significant changes that have taken place in the on-screen construction of religion. In this book I am working with a corpus of more than two hundred ­fiction films. My primary focus is on films distributed across the cinema circuit. ­However, my investigations also encompass television fiction as a critical point of reference, given the key position the small screen holds in the circulation of religion in the public sphere. It is easy to underestimate the number of religious-themed miniseries and films screened on prime-time Italian ­television; it is also impossible to ignore those productions. Bringing television ­fiction film into the picture enables me to explore how the different visual media enable and disable the circulation of religion in the public sphere. There is\n\nIntroduction 19\n\na notable difference between what can be, and is, scheduled on Italian television and what can be, and is, screened in Italy’s cinemas. The often-conflicting picture of religion presented by television on the one hand and by cinema on the other needs to be taken into account in a country in which control of television is highly concentrated: the government-owned RAI possesses three of the seven main terrestrial channels (RAI 1; RAI 2; RAI 3). RAI and Mediaset (owned by ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi) together control 70 per cent of the television airwaves. The films I have selected for discussion encompass not only different media (TV and cinema) but also a variety of genres, from art-house to the film medio, from drama to comedy, from television fiction to experimental cinema. I also open a window on the subterranean film cultures of low-budget horror. This corpus must be inclusive if we are to piece together a broader ­picture of how religion is being constructed in post-secular Italian filmmaking. The wide range of genres demonstrates the tentacular reach of religion, from the most obscure underground films to the buffed and soft-focused television hagiopic. Given the diverse nature of the construction of religion in Italy, only a wide-ranging set of genres can hope to provide a meaningful analysis. I am well aware that my analysis of religion in contemporary Italy could have been brought to bear on a wider cultural context – including, for instance painting, fiction writing, and music – and that doing so might provide a more representative picture than the necessarily fragmentary one this book will offer. My choice to focus more narrowly is motivated by two key factors. First, from a pragmatic point of view, concentrating on one artistic medium allows a depth and rigour of analysis that would be absent from a wider overview. Second, and more importantly, over the course of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries the visual media, including cinema, have attracted the Catholic Church’s attention more than any other, both in terms of the censorship of material seen as inappropriate and in terms of the Church’s support for films that present positive or challenging moral messages. Exploring filmmaking, especially across a range of media, therefore seems apposite. This book’s methodology is firmly post-secular. It sets out neither to laud the place of religion in Italian cultural production nor to mock the “residues” of religion or attack the institution of Catholicism, Islam, or any religion on the peninsula. My aim is to investigate by means of an open-minded, curious, and post-secular frame the peculiar phenomena of religion in twenty-first-century Italian cinema, in line with the research questions outlined at the start of this section – that is, how Italian filmmaking reflects and constructs the continuing position of religion in the public sphere and why religion persists on Italian screens. I propose to achieve this by focusing attention on Catholicism above all. Catholicism unquestionably towers over other religions in Italy in demographic, historic, social, and political terms. It also dominates debates in the Italian public sphere and representations on Italian cinema and television\n\n20 Screening Religions in Italy\n\nscreens. This does not mean that I ignore Italy’s minority religions. On the contrary, throughout this book I draw these into my argument where appropriate, and I dedicate chapter 5 to them. Islam in particular has been growing enormously in importance and is key to any discussion of the post-secular. As the religion that has been expanding most rapidly across Europe and is now the second-largest in Italy, it is a source of unease and anxiety on Italian screens. No discussion of the post-secular in Italy would be complete without it. My use of the concept of the public sphere has its roots in Habermas, whose seminal book The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere (1962) was foundational to subsequent debates. For Habermas, the public sphere, which was created in the eighteenth century by the public monitoring of the state on the part of the bourgeoisie, expanded to include other parts of society. In his 1962 work, Habermas neglected the place of religion in the public sphere; subsequently, however, as outlined above, he rebalanced his argument by drawing questions of religion into the debate. In contemporary social welfare state democracies, the public sphere is now a fragmented field of competition among conflicting interests. It is a societal space in which diverging opinions can be expressed, matters of shared interest discussed, and solutions collectively weighed. It is therefore the space of communication within any given society. This book’s stated aim is to investigate how the film industry reflects and constructs religion and to assess the part played by the industry in the ongoing circulation of religion in the public sphere. Chapter 1 examines the space available for the production and distribution of religious films in Italy. I explore how religious organizations gain, and maintain, control over their media messages. I assess what kinds of religious mobilization exist and the degree of control exercised by religions on the peninsula. I examine Catholic filmmaking policies and infrastructure as well as the policies and infrastructures of minority faiths, taking Islam as the case study. It is not surprising that minority religions have failed to gain any significant foothold in the industry; what is surprising is that Catholicism’s hold over the production and distribution of films has been strengthening rather than weakening since the 1990s. I explore what is behind this as I assess the importance of Catholic mobilization in contemporary filmic production. Chapter 1, then, centres on the mechanics and management of the production and distribution of religious messages. The chapters that follow it examine the form and content of the films. Together these chapters explore the narratives, imagery, rituals, and values that lie behind the continued circulation of religion on screen. Throughout this investigation I ask why religion persists in Italy’s public sphere. What is keeping it there? What can we learn from ­filmmaking about the persistence of religion? In chapter 2, I begin to answer these questions by addressing the attraction of Catholic iconography, rituals, and settings for filmmakers. I select filmmakers who are professedly agnostic or\n\nIntroduction 21\n\natheist and who are working outside the Catholic sphere of production in order to demonstrate just how strong the lure of Catholicism is. Countering thinkers like Stig Hjarvard (2011) and Stewart Hoover (2006), who argue that contemporary uses of religious iconography are little more than superficial spectacle, I argue that in Italy attachment to the imagery and ritual of Catholicism is in fact deeply rooted. While Italian directors often recognize that religion sells both at home and on the global market (the “Da Vinci Code effect”), and this does underpin their use of spectacle, its use is often also motivated by deeper factors, from implicit or explicit religious belief, to a dialogue with Italy’s plastic and performance arts, to the fostering of collective national belonging, sharing, and remembering. Ultimately, in a reversal of Grace Davie’s “believing without belonging” catchphrase (1990), Italian filmmaking demonstrates the importance of icons and ritual in “belonging without (necessarily) believing.” In chapter 3, I focus on Catholic values. Here, I investigate how and why certain contemporary filmmakers bond religious values to countercultural discourse. I argue that through the fusion of religious values and countercultural rhetoric, the on-screen twenty-first-century Catholic Church has been remodelled as a Chiesa della minoranza (minority church). This new paradigm has replaced the former one whereby Catholicism was the powerful hegemonic faith of the peninsula. This has enabled ethical paradigms – the battling priest and Saint Francis – to emerge as relevant to contemporary post-capitalist life in Italy. In an era in which ethical models are few and problematic, these models have gained widespread circulation, thereby enabling an ethics grounded in religion to regain a place in Italy’s public sphere. This investigation of how C ­ atholic values circulate helps explain why Catholicism remains so deeply embedded in Italy’s public sphere and why it has been so difficult for the peninsula’s other ­religions to emerge. The corpus of films in this chapter centres on hagiopics, Lux Vide’s miniseries for television, and film di ­qualità (quality films), all of which position emblematic clerical figures against ­capitalism and fascism. In chapter 4, I investigate another piece of the puzzle: protest. Here, following the seminal work of Michael Lipsky (1969), I hypothesize that protest against the Church is one of the reasons why religion remains an object of interest and discussion in Italy’s media. Without protest, religion risks being seen as an “old” story. A series of conflicts over the position of the Church in secular life have marked the twenty-first-century debate and are reflected on Italian screens. In particular, filmmakers have recently protested the Vatican’s relationship with Italy’s political and economic ecosystem (the banks, the Mafia, and the political sphere) and its control over the lives and bodies of its citizens through legislation on civil partnerships, euthanasia, and in vitro fertilization. The films I discuss in this chapter include Giuseppe Ferrara’s I banchieri di Dio (The God’s Bankers, 2001), Paolo Sorrentino’s Il divo (2008),\n\n22 Screening Religions in Italy\n\nand Roberto Faenza’s La verità sta in cielo (2016), as well as Gustav Hofer and Luca ­Ragazzi’s Improvvisamente l’inverno scorso (Suddenly Last Winter, 2008), Marco ­Bellocchio’s Bella addormentata (Dormant Beauty, 2012) and Carlo Verdone’s Manuale d’amore 2 (Manual of Love 2, 2007). My analysis here will show that the line marking what belongs to religious and what belongs to secular space has shifted radically over the last seventy years. In the conclusion, I look at what the ­diminishing levels of protest mean for the circulation of religion. In chapter 5, I explore the position of Italy’s minority faiths on screen. Given the extent to which the Catholic Church and Catholic iconography, narratives, and values still dominate Italy’s film production, the emergence of Italy’s ­minority faiths on screen is destined to be fraught. In this chapter, I examine how Italian filmmaking for the big and small screen approaches the religious other. I examine the paths of assimilation and expulsion as well as emerging signs of a third way in which acceptance of difference is possible. The c­ hapter draws on a wide range of genres, including comedies like Fariborz Kamkari’s Pitza e datteri (2015), horror movies like Dario Argento’s La terza madre (Mother of Tears, 2007), conspiracy thrillers like Martinelli’s Il mercante di pietre (The Stone ­Merchant, 2006), and the work of Italo-Turkish filmmaker Ferzan Özpetek. Finally, in the book’s conclusion, I explore several films that deliberately foreground post-secularism. These films are investigative and attempt to ­ ­understand the place of religion in Italy, chronicling change and crisis. My aim is to identify the specificity of twenty-first-century post-secularism on screen and understand how this differs from portrayals of religion in the mid-twentieth century and in relation to contemporary post-secular portrayals elsewhere. The films on which I focus include two big-budget auteur works, Nanni ­Moretti’s Habemus Papam (2011) and Paolo Sorrentino’s The Young Pope (2017), as well as Alice Rohrwacher’s low-budget debut, Corpo celeste (Heavenly Body, 2011). In the chapter’s conclusion, I endeavour to outline this volume’s findings, drawing together the main threads of my argument and sketching future directions. This study does not claim to be exhaustive. Religion is too integral to I­ talian filmmaking and too all-pervasive on big and small screens for me to treat every instance in the space available. In this book, what I hope to do instead is provide a roadmap, indicating some key directions in Italy’s curious and anomalous filmic response to its complex, post-secular existence.\n\n1 The Space for Religious Filmmaking: Policy and Infrastructures\n\nIntroduction Contemporary filmmaking is the site of a struggle over the control of public and private images and narratives. Political parties, lobbies, religious leaders, protest groups, and fans are fully aware of just how crucial it is, in a media-dominated world, to consolidate and communicate their perspectives and their versions of events.1 These groups and individuals typically engage in tactics to render visible their vision, or to gain supremacy, in a crowded media environment. When challenged by a film or other media event that threatens their narrative, they emerge into the public sphere to underscore, or impose, a different version that is more coherent with their own. For contemporary religions in Italy, it is crucial to maintain a public voice and a place in the culture industry, given that the Catholic Church’s influence in the world is no longer tied to a leading economic, military, or political presence, and given that the position of minority religions is far from assured. Gaining or retaining this public voice allows for control of the message, and this message is at the heart of the proselytizing religions, especially Christianity and Islam. For minority religions in Italy, breaking into this public space, which is dominated by competing Catholic and secular concerns, is a demanding but essential undertaking. In this chapter I explore whether the filmmaking industries are contributing to the decline of religion in the public sphere, or whether they are successfully mobilizing to resist decline, and if so, how successfully. My focus is on 1 Imposing one’s image of events is not confined to hegemonic power structures, of course. In 2003, Buongiorno notte (Good Morning, Night), directed by veteran filmmaker Marco ­ Bellocchio, put forward a rather two-dimensional image of the male terrorists who kidnapped and later murdered the leader of the Christian Democrats, Aldo Moro. This image was challenged by ex-members of the terrorist organization portrayed, who invited the actors to come and discuss their version of events and experiences with them in the wake of the film’s release.\n\n24 Screening Religions in Italy\n\nthe Catholic Church’s control of the industry, given that it is the main player. Towards the end of the chapter, however, I draw in Islam as an instance of ­minority religious filmmaking, investigating whether growing minority faiths have any meaningful access to the media in Italy – a question that is key to the post-secular debates forwarded by Braidotti and her colleagues (2014). In order to answer these questions, I provide an overview of the tactics used both by religious organizations and by individuals for controlling media messages, and I examine how successful they have been. I work on the critical assumption that control over the media is not simply a matter of a hegemonic Catholic Church exercising its power. While the Vatican’s position on cinema and media is of course crucial (and for this reason, I will be exploring its policies later in this chapter), it is imperative to assess the plurality of Catholic voices that weave across the peninsula, as well as the presence, or absence, of production and distribution circuits for films dealing directly with Islam and other minority religions. In this chapter I challenge the commonly held view that the interventions of religions in Italy’s mediasphere are repressive and punitive – a view that stems from the early interventions of the Catholic Church in the cinema industry, which typically were both. While the legacy of censorship certainly casts a shadow, I will show how many contemporary interventions are instead creative and open. This is not to deny the long history of Catholic censorship in Italy, but rather to emphasize how in contemporary Italy it is no longer censorship that defines the Church’s relationship with cinema and other media. In the first part of the chapter, I provide a brief overview of the Catholic Church’s ­campaign for media presence. I then sketch major Catholic policy positions regarding filmmaking and the infrastructure it has managed to build. Finally, taking Islam as a case study, I investigate whether minority religions have mobilized and been able to enter the public arena, assessing what support both the Italian state and their own religious institutions and infrastructures have provided. Catholic Media Presence in Italy The Catholic Church has for some time invested in a broad international media presence to ensure that its voice continues to be heard. There are the key C ­ atholic news agencies like ACI Prensa, which prepares news for the ­Spanish-speaking world, and ZENIT, which provides stories across Catholic and secular media, as well as international organizations like Catholics in Media (CIMA), EWTN (the global Catholic television network), and the Catholic Media Council (CAMECO), which promotes the work of the Church in developing countries. There are around five hundred official Vatican reporters in the world today (Paoluzi 2009). The Vatican has its own newspaper, the Osservatore ­romano, and a TV production company, Centro Televisivo Vaticano (now Vatican Media), founded in 1983, which makes many documentaries and prepares news\n\nThe Space for Religious Filmmaking 25\n\nfootage. It also has its own website (www.vatican.va), established in 1995 and containing a wealth of material, including a repository of official documents and statements that ­allows people direct access to documents so that they can “judge by themselves if mass media coverage is adequate or somehow biased” (Catoni 2010, 23). It has a radio station, Radio Vatican, which broadcasts in thirty-eight languages. It publishes videos of the pope on YouTube and has myriad Twitter a­ ccounts. Since the early 1960s each national bishops’ conference worldwide has maintained its own media office. The Catholic Church is increasingly ­involved in ­product tie-ins, in licensing arrangements for merchandising, and in contracts with ­advertising and public relations firms – a trend that, given the relatively limited nature of its own media presence, is set to continue (Budde 1998). For instance, the global communications firm Saatchi & Saatchi had a contract with the Italian Catholic Church worth €4 million euro annually, to ­promote campaigns such its otto per mille drive, which ­encourages Italians to nominate the Catholic Church on their tax returns (Budde 1998). The Church’s contemporary attitude towards the media is summarized in the late Pope John Paul II’s apostolic exhortation, Christifideles laici: “The pastoral responsibility among the lay faithful does not stop with this work of defense. It extends to everyone in the world of communications, even to those professional people of the press, cinema, radio, television and theatre. These also are called to proclaim the gospel that brings salvation” (30 December 1988, no. 44). Beyond the official media engine put in place by the Vatican, a great multiplicity of media, some of which have official links to the Vatican and some of which do not, have emerged, representing the plural voices of ­Catholicism internationally and amounting to a large and “formidabile famiglia” (­formidable family) (Boffi 2007, 177). SIGNIS, the World Catholic Association for ­Communication, is recognized by the Vatican, although independent of it. It brings together Catholics working in film, radio, and television and has a history of clashing with the Vatican over its choice of films: when it was still known as OCIC, it a­ ssigned prizes to morally controversial films such as John Schlesinger’s M ­ idnight ­Cowboy (1969) and Pasolini’s Teorema (Theorem, 1968). Various ­media channels have been established by religious communities, ­dioceses, or individuals, and some of these have achieved a significant national or international dimension. C ­ ommunion and Liberation, for instance, first set up a website in Italy; its Web presence has since expanded to eighty countries and draws sixty thousand visitors a month (Arasa, Catoni, and Ruiz 2010). Catholic print titles have recently been estimated at around ten thousand worldwide (Paoluzi 2009). The Church’s media presence is particularly strongly felt in Italy, relative to other European countries. The Catholic Church retains a significant voice and visibility across a range of media, and many major international media publications, broadcasts, websites, and production companies are based on the peninsula. While Italy’s major national TV and radio stations are secular, five\n\n26 Screening Religions in Italy\n\nhundred of the thirty-five-hundred local radio stations and fifty of the four hundred to five hundred TV stations are Catholic run (Boffi, 2007). The print media also have a significant Catholic presence: around three thousand Catholic titles are available in Italy, just under one third of the worldwide Catholic print output (Paoluzi 2009, 149). The Catholic-run Famiglia cristiana sells 1.2 million copies a week and has maintained its position as the most popular weekly magazine in Italy, beating all secular offerings. The Catholic-oriented daily newspaper Avvenire, with a circulation of 106,826 in 2011, is small but growing and according to ­Italy’s Marketing Journal is one of the more solid titles in Italy’s editorial panorama (Editors 2011). This overview of Catholic media in contemporary Italy might suggest that the Church holds a hegemonic position in the public sphere. The reality, though, is more complex. For a start, the link between media circulation and faith is not straightforward: increases in circulation, like that reported for Avvenire, cannot be read as indicating either a (re)turn to faith or an increased ability to broadcast a message. Marketing Journal, for instance, attributes Avvenire’s recent success to marketing techniques, including customer relations management, rather than to growth in religious engagement. Moreover, increased circulation can result from a decrease in the quantity or specificity of religious material, in order to render the magazine, newspaper, blog, or website more palatable to a broader range of secular media consumers. A reduction in the impact of the religious message may therefore accompany an increase in circulation. Data on the circulation of Catholic messages across the media therefore need to be interpreted in relation to the wider context of contemporary secular media. Michael L. Budde (1998, 85), discussing the presence of the Catholic message on the international market, claims that the secular press dominates in such a way as to make the Catholic Church’s efforts seem “inadequate and minuscule.” While “minuscule” is certainly not an appropriate adjective to ­describe the ­Italian position, and the presence of Catholic messages on ­national television is significantly higher than in other European countries, the communication of Catholic stories appears rather less impressive when alternative comparators or indicators are used. Franco Garelli reports that in a 2007 ­analysis of television broadcasting, “a bishop or member of an ecclesiastical ­office i­ntervened in some way (interview or reported declaration) in the evening news broadcasts on 227 out of 365 days” (Garelli 2014, 88). This frequency is very high in European terms, but it must be pointed out here that the official voice of the Vatican is not heard on news bulletins for one third of the year, that only one story in every six or seven on the television news has a Catholic angle, and that the Catholic story or viewpoint does not always make it to the main headlines. In addition, Garelli claims that the presence of other faiths in Italy’s media is “disproportionate” (Garelli 2014, 190). He further claims – without, however, providing evidence – that this is especially true of Oriental religions (Buddhism\n\nThe Space for Religious Filmmaking 27\n\nand Hinduism), New Age practices, and Islam, the latter attaining a high ­media profile due to reportage on terrorist threats. As I will show later, Garelli’s claim regarding the elevated media visibility of minorities does not necessarily generate a stronger voice for these religions. Minorities find it an almost insurmountable challenge to raise their own voice. Catholic media presence also needs to be viewed diachronically, that is, in a way that maps its current presence in Italy against its historical performance. In the early years of the twentieth century, religion played a central role in the media. Peter Elvy (1990) notes that at the beginning of the wireless era there were twenty daily Catholic newspapers; today there are only two. He argues that after the First World War, the Catholic Church never managed to regain its lost ground. The broadcast time given to the Catholic Church in Italy, and indeed across Catholic Europe, has been steadily diminishing since the advent of television. While the Catholic Church has managed to maintain visibility across the mediascape, especially through its own Catholic channels but also through Italy’s secular local and national media networks, Italy’s broadcasting is predominantly secular. Religious broadcasting makes up only a very small proportion of broadcasting time, and Catholic media presence, while clearly dominant when compared to other religions, is therefore far from hegemonic. Policies for Catholic Filmmaking in Italy If Catholic presence in the Italian media has diminished in terms of market share since the start of the twentieth century, its relative resilience is testimony to a solid cultural policy that provides clear guidelines about how the Church should act regarding the media. It is this cultural policy that I wish to outline briefly here, sketching the Vatican’s policies, the support and checks the Church provides, and, as far as possible, how that support maps onto real results within Italy. My focus in the next section will narrow from the broader media context to assess the film industry. Much has changed since Antonio Gramsci analysed the Catholic Church as an “ideological apparatus with its own institutional grassroots structure ... whose purpose was to control its mass social base ... in a somewhat repressive manner” (Allum 1990, 81). The Church’s attitude towards both the media in general and film in particular shifted dramatically over the course of the twentieth century. In the very early days of cinema, the Vatican saw the new ­medium as an instrument of base spectacle and presumed a passive spectator who would be easily influenced and who therefore needed protection from its dangers (Chinnici 2003, 35). By the end of the 1920s the Church authorities had taken an embattled and rigorously conservative position as censorship was imposed. This position changed only slowly over the course of the century, most obviously in the years following the Second Vatican Council (1962–5)\n\n28 Screening Religions in Italy\n\nand after the election of Pope John Paul II in 1978. John Paul II, who had been an actor and a writer for theatre before becoming pope, revised the Church’s positions in relation to media and cinema. The Church has centralized authority in the Vatican, so we can turn to ­Vatican documents to gain an understanding of developments in film p ­ olicy. ­Catholicism is a proselytizing religion, so communication of the Catholic ­message is key, and thus the Vatican has given guidance across a wide set of documents and pronouncements, from official papal documents to documents written under the auspices of the Pontifical Council of Social Communications (the body that oversees the Church’s media relations, authorizes all radio and television work within the Vatican, and oversees the Vatican Film ­Library). It also uses speeches made on various occasions, especially, since 1967, for the a­ nnual World ­Communications Day. However, while noting that the ­official policy comes from the quarters closest to the Vatican, it is important to ­acknowledge that attitudes towards the media across the Catholic world are diverse and do not always reflect the official Vatican voice. Some Catholics, like the ­Vaticanista Giancarlo Zizola (1996), for example, have taken the view that the Catholic Church has compromised itself by its involvement with media spectacle. In broad terms, the positions voiced through the official documents and speeches fall into two camps. On the one hand, they express concern about the dangers of film (and subsequently television and the Internet) and the need for Catholics to adopt a critical view towards them; on the other, they support film and other media in their work of communicating Christian values. In the early years of cinema, the former position dominated. In fact, the first intervention by the Church, in 1909, prohibited the clergy from watching films in Rome’s public cinemas. This was swiftly followed by the 1912 Decree, which forbade the projection of films in churches (Valli 1999). The Church’s concerns about film continued to grow in the 1920s and 1930s, as reflected in the encyclical Vigilanti cura (1936), which encouraged Catholics to fight unhealthy films and praised the repressive US Legion of Decency as well as filmmaking that was “moral, moralising and educating.” During this subsequent period, the Catholic Church became increasingly interested in film. Citing Enrico Baragli’s figures, Daniela Treveri Gennari (2010) notes that the documents prior to Vigilanti cura amounted to just ten, whereas between 1936 and 1955 the Church amassed a total of forty-four documents; by 1957 this had grown to fifty-four. Some critics, like Bernardo Valli (1999), posit that 1955 marked the start of a swing towards a more open attitude on the part of the Church. That year, Pope Pius XII made two speeches on the “ideal film,” speeches that, for the first time, demonstrated sensitivity to the film industry and took as their starting point cinema rather than the imposition of Catholic values. Pius XII’s description of the “ideal film” was firmly aligned with Catholic values in that it upheld the family, traditional gender roles, and the state and encouraged spectators\n\nThe Space for Religious Filmmaking 29\n\nto remain on the “right path”; but he also moved beyond film as solely a moral educative tool, as had been proposed in Vigilanti cura. He instead recognized the entertainment value of film – that it provided an escape from oppressive reality – and he declared that the ideal film might show evil provided that it was portrayed in a negative manner. He warned that filmmakers must not be drawn into doing otherwise by the lure of the market. The focus in these documents was on communicating implicitly religious messages within the secular film industry, rather than producing explicitly religious films, which, as Pope Pius conceded, were rarely successful. Pius XII’s speeches on the ideal film, for all they represented a significant step forward, were still inherently conservative, rigid, and controlling and continued to lend support to censorship. Like the encyclical letter that followed (Miranda Prorsus, 1957), they also resisted an industrial, market-focused model of cinema and reiterated the need for cinema to be driven not by profit but by values. In the context of Europe’s developing film industry, the pope’s support fell not so much behind the American industrial model of cinema, which was being felt across the continent, but ironically behind the independent, art-house model, which was not driven solely by profits. Italy’s art-house sector would, over the course of the 1960s and 1970s, explicitly attack bourgeois and Catholic values and express criticism of, or even downright hostility towards, the Church. The Second Vatican Council represented a revolution in the church’s teaching. It signalled a shift towards a more progressive model of Catholicism, one that placed greater emphasis on pluralism and dialogue. It marked an ­important step in the church’s developing attitude towards modernity and ­ecumenicalism. The admission of media representatives to the council for the first time was significant; so was the discussion of the media’s place in Church thinking. However, the decree dedicated to the media, Inter Mirifica, passed in 1963, ­continued to follow the line that the Church had been taking prior to the council: in broad terms, the media were viewed as instrumental, as subject to the Church’s moral directives, and as exercising a primarily educational function. The primacy of morality over art was reaffirmed. The Church assigned the ­media the term “social communication,” which was understood to better ­reflect the Church’s position (Valli 1999). The invention of a specific term for the media demonstrated the Church’s desire to distinguish between religious and secular use of the means of communication. The Church’s “social communication” was seen as somehow less tainted by the secular and commercial values of media, and was dominated by Catholic values. The rather backward-looking Inter Mirifica was, however, followed by ­Communio et Progressio, a pastoral instruction issued in 1971 that was significantly less prescriptive and dogmatic than the documents that had preceded it. It is, to date, the Church’s most complete document on film, television, and the press, so it can be viewed as the cornerstone for understanding the official\n\n30 Screening Religions in Italy\n\nChurch position on film and the media. It takes a generally positive line and calls for the use of censorship only in extreme cases. There is little specific to cinema in the document; it does, though, exhort Catholics to promote spiritual values and to use the media to communicate not just with the faithful but with the whole public sphere, besides underscoring the importance of understanding the medium (and thus of media education). All of this serves as a clear and more modern message about how to respond to, and use, the media. During the 1960s, then, the Church accepted the need to take a strong position in the public sphere and saw the media as key to achieving this. This view continues to be held by the Catholic Church today. When the Vatican published its second pastoral instruction on the media, Aetatis Novae, in 1992, it reaffirmed many of the principles found in the first instruction. Valli (1999), however, notes a developing concern in the document: that in a media-saturated world, the Church’s voice not become marginalized. There is a clear recognition of the ever-increasing presence of the media in people’s lives and of the Church’s own loss of a hegemonic position as it struggles to make itself heard among a multiplicity of voices in an aggressive market. According to Aetatis Novae, the solution is to ensure that the Church does not rely solely on its own religious media to provide news; it must also infuse the secular media with its voice and values. According to Zizola (1996, 92) what is really new about Aetatis Novae is that it discusses the need to beat secularization with its own means, calling specifically for those working in the media to dedicate themselves to pastoral action. Daniel Arasa (2009, 37) notes the shift in this document towards an understanding that the media form the life of the people and the community, so it is part of the Church’s mission to adapt its language, activities, and culture to the new cultural environment. This was the era of Pope John Paul II (1978–2005), a particularly media-aware and media-friendly pope, a man who had worked as an actor and who not only permitted media spectacle to develop around him but indeed positively encouraged it. Of his numerous interventions on media, the most important as far as the film industry is concerned was his Cinema, veicolo di cultura e proposta di valori, delivered for the annual World Communications Day in 1995: besides warning of the dangers of cinema, this speech discussed its importance in terms of education and the formation of values. In the wake of Cinema, veicolo di cultura, the themes picked for World Communications Days, alongside papal documents and other official speeches, demonstrate that in the 1990s the Vatican’s focus shifted rapidly from cinema to television, the Internet, and social media. Collectively, these have displaced attention from cinema.2 Neither of the two subsequent popes (Benedict XVI and Francis I) has shown a significant interest in cinema. 2 For a complete list of the annual World Communications Day themes, see Meneghetti (2015). These annual events, which were established by the Inter Mirifica decree, provide fascinating\n\nThe Space for Religious Filmmaking 31\n\nIt is clear from the outline presented above that the Vatican’s official policy has evolved over time and adapted to the socio-political environment in which the Church has now found itself. It is clear too that in terms of the Vatican’s attention, cinema has given way to television and the new media, reflecting the steady decline in cinemagoing over the past hundred years and the rise of other media. The Vatican’s declining interest in supporting and controlling cinema reflects its understanding of its diminishing presence as the great purveyor of images and narratives that influence values and taste. The current official Catholic views also reflect cinema’s increasing specialization as a provider of fictional accounts of the world; over the course of the twentieth century, factual newsreels and documentaries have shifted from the big to the small screen. Cinema’s increasing focus on fiction has made it ever less serviceable for the promulgation of Catholic messages. Nonetheless, official Catholic documents that address the media more broadly provide a clear message to contemporary Catholics working in the film industry. Like those working across the range of old and new media, those employed in the film industry are expected to be proactive in making the Church’s voice heard. Italian Infrastructures for Catholic Filmmaking The question that follows on from this is how the Vatican’s evolving policy is being translated into concrete action across the diverse and complex Catholic network in Italy. Policy without action is meaningless. Only by exploring the Church’s actions can one develop an understanding of the kind of control it has been able to exercise, and still exercises, over the peninsula’s filmmaking and, through filmmaking, over the public sphere. In the first decades of the twentieth century, controlling what people watched, rather than how they watched it, was the Catholic Church’s overriding concern. The Vatican encouraged the creation of infrastructures aimed at gaining and retaining control over the cinema industry. It also encouraged Catholics to infiltrate the state censorship boards, whose classifications and cuts had the force of law. The Church was most hostile towards film between the late 1920s and the end of the 1930s, a period during which religiously inspired movements that favoured increased censorship were growing in strength in Europe (­Biltereyst 2006). Daniel Biltereyst describes how Catholic film organizations insights into the developing relationship between the Catholic Church and the media between 1967 and the present. They also allow us to track how the focus has shifted from cinema to mass media to the Internet and social media. The World Communications Days draw attention to questions surrounding the communication of the message; they also habituate people to hearing about the media from the pulpit, in addition to creating a funding stream through the faithful’s offerings (Meneghetti 2015, 174).\n\n32 Screening Religions in Italy\n\nrailed against the “film problem” throughout Belgium, France, Italy, and Spain. In Italy, Catholic censorship was formalized through the creation of the Centro Cattolico Cinematografico (CCC) in 1935. That organization created a national classification system and then classified each film as it was released. While the CCC’s recommendations did not have force of law, the Church used punitive measures, such as forbidding erring parishioners to attend communion, to ­encourage adherence. According to Maurizio Cesari (cited in Treveri Gennari 2011), a bad word from the CCC would affect a film’s success by effectively blocking it from the then-extensive Catholic film circuit. This means that the Church at that time had significant control over what could successfully be distributed and therefore what could be successfully made. The punitive system of Church censorship had ended in Europe by the late 1960s; even so, Church censorship did not disappear entirely from contemporary Italy. Although they are unlikely to be noticed in secular circles and have little influence over ordinary Catholics, the Church continues to ­provide classifications. These take the form of guidance rather than the punitive ­recommendations of the pre-Vatican Council period. In Italy today, two distinct and sometimes contradictory bodies provide Catholics with recommendations and classifications. The Commissione Nazionale Valutazione Film judges and classifies films; however, it is binding only for parish cinemas and a few other Catholic bodies, not for Catholic lay people. The Fondazione Ente dello Spettacolo, founded in 1943 as an offshoot of the CCC, provides guidance to individual Catholics through the columns of its Rivista del cinematografo, although these have no binding status (Viganò 2006). In addition to these bodies, the Vatican itself occasionally publishes official statements on individual films, especially those viewed as directly attacking the Catholic Church and its mission, such as Ron Howard’s The Da Vinci Code (2006) and Pedro Almodóvar’s La mala educación (Bad Education, 2004). But as Dario Viganò notes, even in these cases, boycotting and censorship are rare (2006). In fact, the Catholic Church in Italy today, unlike its evangelical counterpart in the States, deliberately fosters discussion and even “ingestion” of films that might be considered critical of its position. That approach follows Pope John Paul II’s letter to artists in 1999 in which he praised artists’ ability to “seek the beautiful” but also noted, in a reversal of his predecessor’s attitudes, that the portrayal of evil can have a positive value: “even when they explore the darkest depths of the soul or the most unsettling aspects of evil, artists give voice in a way to the universal desire for redemption” (cited in Williams Ortiz 2003, 181). In this way the contemporary Church manages to claim as its own what Peter Malone (2009) has described as the “De ­profundis film,” a film that presents a cry from the depths of moral ­despair. De ­profundis films are now used as a basis for discussing Christian values (­Williams ­Ortiz 2003). Thus, Jessica Hausner, director of the controversial film Lourdes (2009), was invited to the Catholic Tertio Millennio festival\n\nThe Space for Religious Filmmaking 33\n\nin Rome in 2011, and A ­ ntonia Bird’s provocative Priest (1994), which led to firebombings in the United States, had a more open reception in Europe. Priest, a British film about a gay priest, was discussed by the Organisation catholique internationale du cinéma et de l’audiovisuel (OCIC, later SIGNIS) at the Berlin Film Festival and scheduled for screenings in Catholic communities throughout Germany; these were followed by seminars and discussions arranged by the media office of the ­national bishops’ conference (Williams Ortiz 2003). Of course, influencing what a nation or indeed a continent watches, and how they watch it, is only in part down to censorship. As I have shown here, the role played by censorship in Italy has diminished rapidly since the 1960s and is almost imperceptible there today. Censorship plays little real part in what Italians see on screens today, at least outside of parish cinema billings. Where the Church’s influence is still felt is in the infrastructure it has created and maintained to support th"
