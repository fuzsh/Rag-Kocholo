        "text": "ΙCΑΡΝΟΝΑΡΙΟΙ\n\nThe Lords of Iron\n\n-\n\nHistory of the Galatians and the Oikouménē where Hannibal defeated Rome\n\n-\n\nINTRODUCTION​\n\nAncient Gaul was for a long time a terra incognita, something that was barely worth mention except to highlight what Rome, the civilization, was.\n\nStrangely, it’s not because ancients scholars weren’t interested : Celts, and particularly Gauls, were one of the four corners of the known world for Greeks, who negotiated with their princes in exchange for tin and wine.\n\nBut what Greeks as Poseidonios, Romans as Caesar, had to say about Gaulish society and development was ignored.\n\nNevertheless, archaeology and re-evaluation of literary sources increased our knowledge and appreciation of ancient Gaul a tenfold in the last decades.\n\nWe can now have a glimpse of a developed and complex civilization, benefiting from Mediterranean influences, but still its own original creation.\n\nStill, there is much uncertainty, in no small part due to the fact Gauls didn’t wrote down their history, and their defeat meant their institutions, religions and way-of-life disappeared in mere generations. Many of my choices may be based on historical red herrings, but there’s no escaping this.\n\nI propose you, modestly, to look at window to what-could-have-been, in the light of knowledge, hypothesis, and speculation. I hope you’ll enjoy it.\n\nMay Sucellos, the striker, take his mallet for me, and allows me a glimpse of the world below and to listen to the rumors of its dwellers, as there is no longer druids in this world to carry on their knowledge.\n\nMay Lougous, master of all the arts, teaches me how to write the best and not the worst, as there is no longer vates in this world to interpret the signs for me.\n\nMay Belenos, the bright, gives me inspiration and knowledge, as there is no longer bards in this world to teach me how to reach the hearth of men.\n\n-​\n\nThis timeline, while unfolding from a Point of Divergence happening outside Gaul as Romans have to surrender to Carthaginians and their allies, will be focused on the region between Atlantic and Alps, Rhine and Pyrenees; as Gauls themselves might have thought their political horizon.\n\nI’ll try to update regularly this timeline, at least twice per month, with allohistorical updates (mostly focused on Gaul, but from time to time explaining what happens in the wider world), maps, graphics or cultural updates.\n\nStill, I’d want this to become as well as a space for discussion : not only because it’d be thanks to you wondering, questioning or debating that I’ll have ideas or a clearer idea of the development; but as well because it would be rather a nice way to complete the regular updates with new details or explanations.\n\nI'd want to address my special thanks to @Atamolos and @RiseofBubblez for their help, and to everyone that mentioned their interest for this TL and supported it.\n\nLSCatilina\n\n​\n\n​\n\nGauls​\n\n- The ancient paths, Craig Hil\n\n- Armements et auxiliaires gaulois, Lionel Pernet\n\n- Bibracte et les Eduens : à la découverte d'un peuple gaulois, Christian Goudinau\n\n- La Celtique Méditerranénne, Dominique Garcia\n\n- Les Celtes, Histoire et Dictionnare, Venceslas Kruta\n\n- Les Celtes de Gaule méditerranéenne.

Carthaginians were master of all the part of Italy that is called the old and great Greece. Taras were the first to surrender as most of Campania, motivated by fear or desire of freedom, called Annibas *as an ally.\n\nAs for the rest of the aforementioned region, his inhabitants even loyal to Rome expected Carthaginians to occupy them and some of them were inclined to let them doing so.\n\nRomans themselves were at the height of their misfortune, having lost not only their hegemony on Italians but fearing the fall of their city, thinking the enemy would loose no time to come to their walls.\n\nThus thought as well most of Carthaginians' army. Maharbal,the chief of his cavalry, passionless asked the general to rush to Rome; and Annibas answered to their words, but not their prayer. His first action was to stay on the place of his triumph, amazing his men that said of him that his good fortune had stunned him and forced his fate although Baraca only prepared his next move.\n\nIndeed the decision eventually belonged to the Romans and when they heard that their army in Insobria was irremediably defeated and its commander Lucius Manlius Vulso was killed, the Romans from a people became a mob. The Senate managed to calm them only at great expense, making them see that the state was in great danger but that its survival depended on their shoulder and discipline.\n\nAnd then Annibas demonstrated that his skill in war was matched by the general’s keen politic talent. He sent ambassadors to Rome, with the mission to negotiate about what would happen to the many prisoners he took. But they were trusted as well to see if Rome was willing to finally make peace as it was at his reach.\n\nHe sent two men trusted of the Carthaginians, Carthalo and Gisco, officers and diplomats of great skill although Gisco was a better negotiator and a friend of the Annids.\n\nWhen they arrived near Rome, Annibas moved at least his forces towards the southern coast. Not in the hope to confront again their army, neither to besiege the city as he lacked equipment, but to impress its inhabitants and force their decision.\n\nAnd the Senate, that wanted first to refuse to hear the proposal of the Carthaginians, was forced to hear them, as they couldn’t find a man in Rome that didn’t despaired of the elongation of this conflict.\n\nWithout Carthalo’s knowledge, Gisco freed some renowned prisoners before he encountered the Senators, as a show of good faith but telling them that Carthaginians wanted a good peace and that Romans wouldn’t benefit from new years of war.\n\nGisco was accused later that his concerns on Annibas’ power constant growth took the better of him and his mission, but there is little doubt in Africa now that he had the well-being of the state at heart, and that his action regardless of its intent helped winning a fruitful outcome.\n\nIndeed, when the delegation came to Rome, with Annibas’ army not just behind them but too close for the Romans, these already knew of the terms proposed and once again threatened to storm the state if they were to be refused.\n\nMarcus Fabius Bueto, that was chosen as dictator at this time which is the supreme magistrate of the Romans, preferred to ask the Senate to agree or not, as himself refused to presides on the defeat while he saw no issue between Carthaginian triumph and the despair of his own people.\n\nIn addition of the ransom and the famed tribute the Senate agreed to, and the loss of the provinces they took from Carthage in the previous war, Rome lost most of its dominance in Italy.\n\nThe allies of of the new victors were already freed of Romans and the people of Insôbres, because of their role in the war and seniority in the region, kept a high position in the region that took their name from this point onward.\n\nWhile Capuan ambitions to become the first city in Italy were disappointed, Carthaginians forced Romans to leave the southern half of Italy and to acknowledge an independent league of cities there.\n\nBut Marcellus, which became dictator after Bueto, kept as much alliances in this league as he could, and while Carthaginians and Italian alike were aware of this, they weren’t able to root it out due to their own businesses and that because Annibas couldn’t convince Capu or other main cities of this league to agree to garrison his armies.\n\nAnd thus, Rome was deprived of the allies and conquest her glory owed her and was forced to promise a large tribute and to never meddle in the affairs of Africa and Iberia. For this, Roman navy was forbidden to sail beyond the islands of Cyrnos and Iknoussa without Carthaginian’s permission.\n\n* [Author's Note] Hannibal​\n\nAwesome start, I can't wait to see the Gallic confederations and hegemonies forming (probably not a unified Gallic kingdom for some centuries, I assume).\n\nI also like that although Rome has been curbed by Carthage, it has not been destroyed so we can still see Roman society playing a role in this timeline. Well, until the conquest of Rome by Galatians in 44 BC, of course.\n\nThey did IOTL. Contrary to the old conception, Gauls (Galatians ITTL) did wrote a lot, in Gallo-Italic script (Although it's not really clear if Lepontic is a distinct Celtic language or an archaising variant of Gaulish), in Gallo-Greek script (essentially in south-eastern Gaul) and in Gallo-Latin script (especially after the conquest).\n\nCeltiberians themselves used a Gallo-Iberic script.\n\nWe know a bit of Gaulish language, although not enough to entirely reconstitute it. Druidic influence frowned upon writing down complex concepts, but Gauls really wrote about administrative matters, dedications or plays (such as this cup on which is written NEĐĐAMON DELGU LINDA, roughly \"I contain next ones' drink\").\n\nI prepared some updates about Gaulish language and Gallo-XXXX scripts, but not before we end with the prologue. Suffice to say that the title of the TL is in partially reconstructed Gaulish and using a particular script.\n\nCould Gallo-Latin script still arise in the eastern parts of the Gallic world? There was usage of capital Latin script in the Boii kingdom, at least in the inscriptions on the Biatec coins, prior to Roman expansion north of the Alps. Granted, that occurred in a period of nonstop Roman ascendancy,... but I think a more peripheral Roman influence could make itself present, like the spread of Old Italic descended scripts across most of Europe."
