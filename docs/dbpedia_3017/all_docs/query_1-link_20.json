        "text": "The most frightening sound is the wild banging of stones on metal light poles, a ringing crescendo of panic that begins nobody-knows-where and spreads in moments around this violent, broken seaside town.\n\nIt is an early warning system that there is trouble again in Ambon -- or that once again someone has gone mad with fear, terrified by the wind in the palm trees or by the barking of dogs or simply by the silence of the empty streets.\n\n''It's frightening but also it's crazy,'' said Umelto Labetubun, 25, an architecture student. ''Everyone grabs rocks and starts banging, even old men. Everyone is running from their houses looking for a safer place. You call your friend on the other side of town and he's hearing it too.''\n\nIn their separate neighborhoods, segregated by fear, Muslims and Christians hear the sound and run for their swords and spears and guns and homemade bombs. By the end of the day, somebody will surely be dead.\n\nIn the last 12 months as many as 2,000 people have been killed in what has become an unstoppable surge of religious warfare here in the islands of Maluku Province, the lovely archipelago once known as the Spice Islands.\n\nThis is Indonesia's nightmare: freed from the controlling grip of its former dictator, society descends into chaos as religious and social hatreds boil to the surface, beyond the reach of the central government or security forces.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
