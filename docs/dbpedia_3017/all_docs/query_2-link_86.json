        "text": "Summary\n\nThe [business] involvement of army officers is a fundamental trigger for conflict, abuses of power, crime, and human rights violations.\n\n-An Indonesian human rights activist, email message to Human Rights Watch, September 26, 2005\n\nUp to now, benefits from military business are still enjoyed by the upper echelon of the military elite.\n\n-Minister of Defense Juwono Sudarsono, quoted in Tempo Interactive, February 23, 2005\n\nBusiness is autonomy It is not good for the command hierarchy.\n\n-Lt. Gen. Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, secretary-general of the Ministry of Defense and former spokesman for the Indonesian military, in an interview with Human Rights Watch, April 12, 2006.\n\nCivilian governments can't control the military if they don't control the budget. It's as simple as that.\n\n-A foreign military reform expert, speaking to Human Rights Watch, September 7, 2004\n\nIt matters how militaries get their money. Civilian control over a state's armed forces is fundamental for the development of a professional military that respects human rights. The more a military's revenue and spending are outside civilian government control, and the more funds it raises itself, the harder it is for civil authorities to engage in meaningful oversight of the military. The result is a government that lacks the power to demand accountability from its armed forces and to implement needed reforms. Particularly when a military has a record of exercising political power and of committing human rights abuses with impunity, financial autonomy can lead to abuse.\n\nMilitary self-financing is an established practice in Indonesia. From the first days of independence, Indonesia's armed forces have found their own means. Successive governments have endorsed or chosen to ignore the military's economic activities. In recent years, Indonesian officials have contended that the military budget is sufficient only to meet half the military's minimum requirements. A thorough review would be needed to determine appropriate levels of government financing but it is true that Indonesia's official military budget is low compared to many of its neighbors in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe Indonesian military deals with its budget constraints using a combination of approaches. In part it acts by deferring or reducing its spending in some areas, such as equipment purchases. At the same time, it seeks funds for that purpose from other government accounts, often acting outside approved budgeting processes and with little transparency. In addition to juggling government funds in this way, Indonesia's military also independently raises money through a complex web of commercial ventures whose profits bypass the treasury. It is these independent revenue sources that are the focus of this report.\n\nThe Indonesian military draws on off-budget (extra-budgetary and unaccountable) funds derived from military-owned enterprises, informal alliances with private entrepreneurs to whom the military often provides services, mafia-like criminal activity, and corruption.\n\nMuch of the revenue from such ventures goes directly to commanders, specific units, or individual soldiers. Ostensibly the funds are to support troop welfare, but often they are destined for personal enrichment instead. Some of the funds are used for day-to-day operating expenses of the armed forces. Irrespective of the purpose to which they are put, off-budget funds are not monitored or subject to financial controls. Such are the budgetary pressures and weak controls in Indonesia that it is common for government agencies to raise funds independently to help meet expenditures, which in turn helps fuel widespread corruption. Yet the problem of self-financing and its consequences are most serious with respect to the security forces, especially the military. (The question of police self-financing merits close scrutiny but is beyond the scope of this study.)\n\nThis report provides a human rights analysis of military self-financing in Indonesia. The first part of the report reviews how the Indonesian military came to be involved in business activity, and explains how such activity has spread over time. It also examines the failure of government authorities to enforce rules against military commercialism.\n\nThe second part of the report offers a detailed look at how the Indonesian military finances itself, providing the most comprehensive account to date of the nature and scope of the problem as viewed through a human rights lens. It identifies the four broad categories into which the self-financing activities fall and details how each works.\n\nWe find that the military supplements official funds using profits from its own businesses, payments from private-sector allies (often for security services), income from black market activities, and money skimmed from corrupt dealings. Formally-established businesses have performed poorly in recent years, leading the military to increasingly rely on irregular and illegal fundraising. We provide examples to illustrate the military's different economic entanglements and some of the human rights abuses associated with them.\n\nThe third part examines obstacles to change and reform efforts to date. It identifies the absence of transparency and accountability regarding military finance issues as a serious impediment to reform. Official data on military budgets and spending are unreliable and incomplete. When it comes to off-budget matters, including revenue from military businesses, no reliable figures exist and estimates have varied wildly. The difficulty in establishing credible statistics is but one indication of the need to improve financial management of military affairs. Some changes are underway, as part of wider efforts to improve public financial management, but additional, targeted measures are needed to ensure adequate oversight and reporting on military finances. The military's revenue and spending remain one of the least transparent and accountable elements of the government's accounts.\n\nThis part of the report also addresses three myths often trotted out to explain the slow pace of reform: that funds from official government sources are sufficient to meet only a fraction of the needs the military; that military businesses generate substantial revenue that goes most of the way toward filling the gap; and that the proceeds of military businesses largely are spent on troop welfare.\n\nWhile it is true that official Indonesian government spending on the military is relatively low, it is higher than military budget figures suggest. Additional government outlays are hidden in other budget lines, there is a significant level of waste, and government support levels have increased substantially in recent years.\n\nAs for the second myth, the evidence we have shows that many military business ventures have been great failures and that, on net, even the businesses in which the military has a direct ownership stake contribute only modest sums to help cover unbudgeted expenses-as government officials have begun to acknowledge. In the permissive environment engendered by the expectation that the military will generate income to contribute to its costs and by the absence of monitoring of that income, the weak performance of the \"regular\" businesses owned by the military has contributed to the spread of informal and illegal military economic activities that are more hidden and more difficult to control.\n\nThere are also strong indications that, contrary to those who espouse the third myth, much of the funds the military raises independently (particularly but not exclusively funds raised through systemic corruption and other criminal activity) goes into pockets of individuals, instead of to improve conditions for the troops.\n\nThe report's assessment of reform efforts to date focuses on the 2004 law that is the basis of current efforts. That law mandated that the military end its business activity within five years. To make the most of the opportunity, civilian and military officials alike must commit themselves to comprehensive reform. Unfortunately, as announced to date the government's plans would not address the full scope of the problem. They focus exclusively on a subset of one type of military economic interest: formally-established businesses in which the military has a documented ownership share.\n\nMilitary leaders similarly have sought to limit the scope of financing reform in order to retain many business ventures that they argue-contrary to the evidence-are independent of the institution of the military, do not make use of government resources, or only serve to support soldier welfare. All indications are that they have succeeded: at this writing, the government's draft proposal provided all these exceptions. The result would be a superficial reform that would leave untouched many military business enterprises, as well as the military's stake in irregular and illegal business activity.\n\nThe report concludes with detailed recommendations for reform. It argues that for military finance reform to succeed the government must define the problem accurately, recognize the true human rights costs of self-financing-including in terms of weakening the government's ability to bring military personnel to justice for crimes that violate human rights-and commit fully to stamping it out. That will require concrete steps to impose financial accountability on the military, ban all forms of military commercialism, develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to withdraw the military from business activity, and fund the military at appropriate levels (following a close review of actual needs and bearing in mind other national priorities).\n\n***\n\nIt is nearly impossible to determine the total value of the Indonesian military's various economic activities. The military's extensive network of economic interests is scattered across the country and includes businesses large and small, centralized and locally controlled, legal and illegal. No one, including top military leaders, has a full grasp of the sums involved. For years government officials repeated informal estimates suggesting that funds formally allocated to the military in the national budget covered only 25-30 percent of actual military expenditures and that the remainder was paid from off-budget funds, but by 2005 they dismissed these estimates as outdated and inaccurate. Nor is it clear if more recent estimates placing the figure at about 50 percent are any more reliable, since officials have not undertaken an analysis of the extent of off-budget activity and in any case give inconsistent information.\n\nThere is equal confusion over the number of military businesses. An initial military inventory in 2005 first put the figure at 219, but a subsequent one in 2006 gave the number as 1,520. Some government officials have questioned the credibility of the revised data and suggested the actual number of military businesses was far lower than indicated. There is equal reason to think that the official inventory undercounted the number of military businesses, since it excluded informal and illegal economic activity. The inability to quantify the extent of the military's fundraising and the exact number of its business, however, does not detract from the need for change. There is general agreement that military self-financing is a dangerous practice that should not be allowed to continue.\n\n***\n\nOpportunity for Reform\n\nThe Indonesian military (Tentara Nasional Indonesia or TNI) is now required by a 2004 law to withdraw from economic activity. Under that law, the Indonesian government must take over military business holdings by 2009. The law also bars the military from engaging in business activity and receiving funds outside of the state budget. Indonesia's military leadership has pledged to cooperate and expressed willingness to give up some of its business interests before that deadline. Civilian officials have acknowledged that pervasive military economic activity takes a heavy toll on the armed forces and the country, and that it should be brought to an end. These policy commitments represent an important shift after years in which various governments made excuses for inaction and military officials actively resisted reform.\n\nThe stakes are high. If implemented fully and in a timely manner with transparency and accountability, reform of military finance could mark a major step toward structural reform of the TNI. Many in Indonesia's military share the view that they should get out of the business of private moneymaking. They recognize that the focus on fundraising reduces military professionalism and readiness. Senior military officers continue to publicly defend some types of military business activity as a way to support the basic needs of soldiers, but they are increasingly likely to acknowledge that many military businesses have given way to self-serving ventures that offer little to the troops and instead only sully the military's reputation. A growing number of military personnel at all levels would prefer not to engage in self-finance and would rather the state took responsibility to fund the military appropriately.\n\nThere are other important reasons to end military self-financing. Military economic engagements are bad for the economy: they introduce market distortion and irrationalities; provide a platform for corruption and rent-seeking behavior (defined as the extraction of excess profits, such as through privileged access to lucrative natural resources); add to the cost of doing business (through the payment of protection money); and contribute to environmental degradation that impedes sustainable development.\n\nThe compelling human costs of the military's economic activities also must be considered. Civil society groups have long drawn attention to the many ways in which military economic entanglements fuel abuses of power, including corruption and human rights violations. The Indonesian military has a dismal human rights record, and it is widely recognized that military self-financing plays a role in facilitating such abuses. Economic incentives can motivate certain military abuses-including extortion, property seizures, and profiteering-and also can help fuel or sustain violence in conflict areas where the armed forces have access to lucrative natural resources or money-making ventures. More generally, the military's financial autonomy undermines civilian authority and accountability. Effective reform of military finance would serve to enhance accountability and help curb military abuses in Indonesia.\n\nThe drive to end the military's economic activities forms part of a wider agenda to move the military more firmly under civilian control. Indonesian policymakers and military leaders have acknowledged the public demand for military reform and have begun to carry out some structural changes. Notably, the withdrawal of the military from parliament, designed to help reduce the military's political influence, was completed in 2004. Progress to date has been limited and highly selective, but top Indonesian officials, including President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the defense minister, and the chief of the armed forces, have expressed a firm commitment to advance the military reform agenda. Reform-minded officials and military officers have the support of the public. A 2005 opinion poll by the Indonesian Survey Institute found that a majority of Indonesians support a variety of reforms to reduce the military's power in society. Consistent with that view, a majority also believe that the armed forces should be funded solely by the government and that the military should not engage in business activities.\n\nThe recent recognition by Indonesian leaders of the need to address military finance and business dealings is welcome, but the pledges to undertake serious reform have not been matched by concerted action. Government moves to begin addressing the military's economic entanglements have been slow, half-hearted, and incomplete. Proposals to address self-finance have failed to comprehensively deal with the problem and its human rights aspects. To fulfill the promise of the 2004 law, the government should radically rethink its approach.\n\n***\n\nNote on Methodology\n\nThis report and associated advocacy efforts form part of a wider program of work by Human Rights Watch. Our research on business and human rights issues has resulted in reports on many countries and a range of issues. We have prepared reports that examine the activities of private companies in light of international standards on corporate behavior. We have documented widespread violations of the human rights of workers. We also have analyzed how mismanagement, corruption, and the absence of transparency over government finances can undermine human rights. We work internationally to press for public accountability of government funds, for corporate accountability for human rights abuses, and against off-budget financing mechanisms that are rife with corruption and ultimately undermine human rights protections.\n\nThe research for this report was conducted over the course of two years and entailed four research trips to Indonesia. We investigated military financing issues and researched several examples that showcase some of the human rights abuses associated with military economic activity. We also sought to understand the financial pressures experienced by the military and the difficult choices faced.\n\nThe report is based on more than two hundred interviews and extensive additional research carried out in Indonesia and from abroad. We spoke to a wide range of people to gather information. We met with government officials from the Ministry of Defense, TNI headquarters, and numerous other government ministries or agencies. We also exchanged correspondence with some of these officials. Additional sources included scholars, professional analysts and researchers, military experts, community activists, retired military officers, and journalists. We also spoke to businesspeople, diplomats, and international finance experts. We traveled to Aceh, North Sumatra, and South Kalimantan provinces to carry out detailed field research with the assistance of Indonesian colleagues. We also have relied on public disclosures, other published research, and unpublished materials to supplement our original research. We have benefited especially from the work of the many independent experts, human rights campaigners, and other civil society activists whose efforts to raise awareness of the phenomenon of military business in Indonesia and to advocate for its abolition helped generate the political will to begin to tackle this serious problem.\n\nI. Military Finance in Indonesia\n\nMilitary Self-Finance and Human Rights\n\nIt is widely accepted in Indonesia that military self-finance can lead to human rights abuses. The reason is that there are often inherent and direct conflicts of interest between the military's security function and its profit-seeking. Human rights too often become a victim of those conflicts.This harmful dynamic colors military operations in conflict zones and also affects more mundane military activities in other parts of the country. Human rights reports on Indonesia are replete with examples of violence, intimidation, extortion, land and property seizures, and other abuses linked to military economic interests.\n\nIndonesia's military has a record of exercising considerable political power, particularly under the authoritarian government of General Soeharto, and still holds sway in society. The fact that the Indonesian military continues to be deployed on a territorial basis, in parallel to civilian government administrations down to the local level, leads to frequent interactions between the armed forces and the public. It provides military units and individual soldiers with added opportunities to exploit their position at the expense of civilians. The military can use its coercive authority to advance or protect its economic interests, or those of its partners.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by the fact that the Indonesian military is often called on to assist in preserving or restoring public order. The military's involvement in internal security matters can create a conflict of interest that pits its official function against the strong drive for profits and funds. Some military self-financing activities, including protection rackets, directly undermine security and fuel lawlessness.\n\nThe police, which are taking over greater responsibility for internal security, face the same conflicts of interest. Like the military, the police in Indonesia have a reputation for corruption and are deeply involved in a range of economic activities. The two forces were only separated in 1999 and share many of the same poor financial practices. Self-financing by the police merits attention but is beyond the scope of this study.\n\nThere is a second dimension to the link between military self-financing and human rights. Even if self-financing activity is entirely clean, follows good business practices, and the money is properly accounted for, money that comes directly to the military outside of proper government budgetary channels still can be expected to undermine accountability. If civil authorities do not control the flow of money, they lose important leverage over the military. For example, if the civil authorities withhold funds to try to limit certain military activities, the military can always turn to other sources. In that way, self-financing activity tilts the balance of power away from the government and in favor of the military and its business allies. In turn, this impedes the ability of civil authorities to assert control over the armed forces and end impunity for military abuses. These problems are aggravated, and the position of the civil government further weakened, when military self-financing activity does not adhere to proper business practices, generates revenues that are not transparently reported and publicly accountable, and includes economic activity that violates the law.\n\nThe TNI, through its then spokesperson Maj. Gen. Kohirin Suganda, has argued that there is \"no reason or opportunity for the TNI to deny civilian supremacy.\" It also stated that \"the TNI supports the principle of public accountability and transparency\" and insisted that the military is subject to strict internal and external controls on its finances. In reality, however, the TNI largely operates independently with regard to its finances.\n\nA Brief History of Military Economic Activity\n\nThe Indonesian military's involvement in economic activity in Indonesia dates back to the 1945-1949 Indonesian war for independence from the Netherlands. The nascent military was responsible for raising its own funds. In addition to relying on popular backing and material support, in some areas military units turned to smuggling to finance their operations.\n\nThe pattern of self-financing continued after the formation of the Indonesian armed forces (which became known as Angkatan Bersenjata Republik Indonesia or ABRI, a combined military-police structure until 1999). Official budget allocations to the military were low. As a consequence, throughout the 1950s military commands and units continued to raise their own funds to a large degree. Their fundraising methods went beyond illegal activities such as organized smuggling and illegal levies: Increasingly, military commanders also allied themselves with local businesspeople to generate funds to cover military expenditures. In some cases the military command itself would be granted a stake in a business venture managed by a private partner.\n\nEarly Military Businesses\n\nThe military began to take part in large-scale businesses by the latter part of the 1950s. In the late 1950s, under martial law, the military took over control of Dutch companies. Soon afterwards President Sukarno formally placed the newly nationalized companies under the supervision of senior military personnel. The state takeover of British companies and some United States ones followed in the mid-1960s. Control of these enterprises was likewise granted to military officers. In part, these moves responded to severe budget shortfalls that resulted in paltry salaries, poor housing, and insufficient clothing and equipment for soldiers.\n\nThe military also became heavily involved in managing major state-owned enterprises. Oil giant Pertamina and the logistics agency Badan Urusan Logistik (or Bulog) were both dominated by military leadership throughout the 1960s and into the next decade. Profits from military-run companies were commonly directed to the military. This \"unconventional financing,\" moreover, allowed the government and military leadership to give the appearance of sacrificing military spending in favor of other national priorities.\n\nThe rapid expansion of the military's economic engagement in the 1960s extended to the private sector. Much of the growth was from military partnerships with private businesspeople. It was the private entrepreneurs who in fact operated most military-sponsored businesses. The military's actual contribution to its business ventures typically was nominal: military partners provided licenses and approvals, and helped secure concessions and state contracts.\n\nA Military Business Empire Forms\n\nMilitary business activity was further entrenched during the New Order period, the period from 1967 to 1998 in which General Soeharto led a military-dominated government. Soeharto himself was sympathetic to commanders who engaged in self-financing. He had done the same during the time he commanded an army unit in Central Java in the late 1950s, and retained close ties with his private-sector partners.\n\nEarly on in the New Order period, senior military posts were filled with Soeharto loyalists who also benefited from private business ventures. This pattern helped perpetuate military economic ties, since uncorrupted officers were unlikely to be promoted to senior command positions.\n\nThe explosive growth under Soeharto of military business activity, both legal and illegal, reflected the military's strong position as a center of power in Indonesian society. The military's expanding influence was supported by the dwifungsi (dual function) doctrine adopted in 1966.Dwifungsi officially granted the military a strong socio-political role alongside its defense role. Also key was the military's territorial command structure, in which military presence throughout the country paralleled government administrative bodies down to the village level. This strong local-level presence, combined with the military's coercive power and political leverage, made it possible for the military to dominate economic opportunities.\n\nThe military service branches, regional commands, local units, and individual officers took part in commercial enterprises of all kinds and used different business structures, both formal and informal. Formally owned companies were held as investments of military foundations or cooperatives that, going beyond their mandated welfare function, developed into commercial arms of the TNI.\n\nThanks to political backing and favoritism, military-linked businesses became a dominant economic force. For example, the military took over ownership of privatized state companies, gained vast forestry exploitation rights, and enjoyed favored access to government contracts, licenses, and credits.\n\nA range of human rights abuses tied to military economic interests emerged during the New Order period. In the late 1960s and 1970s, the government forcibly took over large swaths of land on which indigenous communities depended, dispossessing them without due process and with little or no compensation. The military was a prime beneficiary of state forestry policies that enabled the wholesale seizure of land claimed by local indigenous communities. (See \"Military Investments in Forestry,\" below.) In many cases, soldiers also acted as enforcers to secure control over land. For example, indigenous communities in Riau province reported that during the Soeharto era thousands of hectares of community land were seized under intimidation from armed police and military, and without any compensation.\n\nFor a time, companies also routinely called on troops to respond to labor and land disputes, and soldiers used excess force or intimidation to silence dissent. For example, military personnel in the role of \"company security\" frequently interfered in labor disputes, using intimidation and outright violence, up to the early 2000s. In some cases, the dirty work of intimidation and violence was subcontracted to private groups of thugs.\n\nIn addition, illegal revenue-generating activity by the military continued. Commanding officers, faced with the expectation of their superiors that they would finance the units they led, devised ways to use their troops, facilities, and clout to raise money. Many of the illegal ventures they established were local schemes but others implicated higher-level officials. In some cases, military commanders openly tolerated illegal economic activity by their subordinates. More generally, military leaders looked the other way, so long as the money continued to flow. Not surprisingly, self-enrichment took place on a grand scale and impunity prevailed.\n\nThroughout the Soeharto era, the military remained active in commercial ventures at all levels, from headquarters to unit commands. By 1998 territorial units throughout Indonesia were considered to be \"financially independent.\" Much of the money generated by military businesses was allocated to senior officers. For example, an audit of one military-linked company, covering the years 1997 and 1998, noted large payments to senior military personnel, mostly listed as \"honoraria.\"\n\nThe military's business investments were closely linked to the economic interests of the Soeharto family and its associates, and they often joined together in powerful conglomerates. In the later years of the Soeharto administration, however, private investors began to partner directly with members of Soeharto's family, so the military lost its place as the favored business partner.\n\nThe Financial Crisis and its Aftermath\n\nThe military's economic standing slipped dramatically as a result of the Asian economic crisis that ultimately helped bring down the Soeharto administration and usher in the reformasi (reform) era. A researcher has estimated that only about one-third of the military's companies survived the crisis. Overall, the military reportedly experienced a 30 percent decline in its purchasing power from 1997 to 1998. Dividends from one major military investment, a timber company, fell from U.S.$30 million in 1996 to an estimated $19 million in 1998.\n\nFinancial reviews of military-owned businesses confirmed their decline. An audit of the main army foundation found that in 2000 its companies returned a net loss of Rp. 8.21 billion ($985,000). Facing major setbacks, the TNI divested itself of some businesses, including in the formerly lucrative timber sector. It also shut down many profit-losing businesses, while others underwent restructuring. Financial concerns also led to the consolidation of some military foundations. The defense minister from 1999 to 2000, Juwono Sudarsono (who would be renamed to that position in October 2004), expressed concern about the state of the military foundations: \"We must act as soon as possible to stop the loss of funds to the nation.\"\n\nSome military businesses were able to limit the financial damage. Yet the overall picture was bleak. The then TNI assistant for general planning estimated that military foundations contributed in 2000 a total sum equivalent to only about 1 percent of the military budget and still less (0.7 percent) in 2001.\n\nNew Trends: Diversification, Decentralization, Competition\n\nIn the years following the financial crisis, military economic activity underwent several changes. In one important trend, the TNI increasingly turned to alternative revenue sources to compensate for troubled businesses. In particular, the military came to rely more heavily on partnerships and other arrangements in which it allied with private businesses, notably by providing paid protection services. Contributions from private individuals and businesses took on special importance. The military supplemented its official budget by tapping other government resources, especially to pay for purchases of weapons. The TNI also developed new strategies to find funds. Taking advantage of a government decentralization drive, the military tapped into growing local and regional budgets to cover military expenditures.\n\nAt the same time, rampant illicit activities and corruption in the military continued unhindered. As military economic ventures became reliant on informal partnerships and criminal activity, they became more hidden. The military's economic activities and their harmful side effects thus became harder to control, even as pressure mounted for greater accountability.\n\nIn another new trend, military businesses have faced increased competition from the police. Welcome moves to give the police greater responsibility for internal security have had the unintended side effect of giving the police opportunities to take over businesses in which the military had been dominant. This has been particularly true for security and protection services, but it also has extended to many other areas. As the police have begun to displace the TNI, struggles over turf repeatedly have broken out into violence. Police business activities, like those of the military, have been associated with human rights abuses, corruption, and weak accountability.\n\nMilitary Business Activity and the Law\n\nIn September 2004 a new law on the TNI was passed. The law mandated that the Indonesian military end its involvement in business. It also ordered the government to take over military businesses within five years.\n\nPreviously when legal controls on military economic activity were imposed they were not enforced. At times pressure has mounted to rein in rampant illegal business activity, but even then the authorities have cracked down only reluctantly and with little effect. Military economic activity in Indonesia had developed with few constraints in the permissive environment created by leaders who defend the military's involvement in business as a legitimate and necessary response to budget shortfalls.\n\nMuch military business activity in Indonesia had been declared improper long before the passage of the 2004 TNI law. For decades, the main instrument governing military business activities was Regulation No. 6/1974, which dates to 1974. Under that regulation, active military (and police) personnel were barred from taking part in private business activities except under certain circumstances. Specifically, military officers (at the rank of second lieutenant or higher) were prohibited from owning shares in a private company; taking part in the management of such a company, including in an advisory capacity; or otherwise engaging in profit-driven \"trade activities,\" whether formally or on a freelance basis.\n\nUnder an important exemption, officers were permitted to work for private companies set up by non-profit institutions, either as employees or company officers (in the latter case, under the condition that they obtain permission from superiors and not receive compensation). The conditions were somewhat more flexible for lower-ranking troops, as well as for the wives of military personnel. The exception for soldiers to join companies via non-profit entities opened the door for military foundations, set up with an ostensibly charitable purpose, to develop into commercial arms of the military. In a further weakness, the regulation did not specify an enforcement mechanism.\n\nLack of Enforcement\n\nFor decades, government laxity and tolerance has enabled the military to openly engage in self-financing. The lack of enforcement of the 1974 regulation has been the hallmark of government inaction to rein in military businesses. At various points, officials have openly encouraged the military to engage in business as a response to budget constraints. When public pressure has been particularly acute, the government and military leaders have pledged that they would crack down on the military's business activities. In reality, however, they have shown little interest in enforcing the rules.\n\nSo many military officers flouted the 1974 regulation that the military chief and minister of defense and security felt the need to reassert the ban on business a few years after it was adopted. Speaking in 1979, Gen. Muhammad Yusuf declared: \"All serving officers are forbidden to enter the world of commerce. Forget about trade if you want to be a good soldier.\" He added: \"Those who violate the rules will be dismissed or will be granted early retirement.\"\n\nAs a result, some 200 to 300 people reportedly were instructed to resign. Yet military business flourished. Military commercial activity continued to take place via \"front organizations\" such as foundations and cooperatives. In addition, TNI headquarters allowed field commanders \"discretion\" to continue fundraising as they saw fit.\n\nThe failure to enforce the ban on military business also signaled a lax attitude toward other illicit economic activity by the military. For a time, some regional military commanders openly tolerated smuggling by their subordinates. When the Soeharto government imposed a short-lived crackdown on blatant military smuggling, it resulted only in a change in tactics: rather than risk being directly involved in the transport and unloading of smuggled goods, military officers provided \"protection\" for smuggling operations carried out by private associates. Even when such operations were exposed, military backers of sufficiently high rank and political clout could practically guarantee impunity for the smugglers.\n\nAt the end of the Soeharto era, the military faced renewed criticism about widespread illicit business activity by soldiers. The defense minister in 1997, Edi Sudrajat, renewed the 1974 ban by declaring that military personnel could not do business, whether directly or by providing protection services. The then armed forces commander, Gen. Feisal Tanjung, reinforced the order a week later: \"All officers and their wives are barred from business. If they want to get involved in business, they must get written permission from me first.\"\n\nThe military clarified that retired officers and those working for military cooperatives or foundations were not subject to the rule. Even so, few expected the order to be enforced. Even government officials expressed skepticism, given the pervasive nature of the military's involvement in the economy at that point. In the end, the \"crackdown\" reportedly resulted in thirty-four solders in Jakarta being picked up for moonlighting as nightclub security guards. For the few caught in the net, General Sudrajat's order outlined the punishments: delayed promotions or dismissal. Prosecution was not contemplated.\n\nIn the face of major public pressure for political reform that began in March 1998 and ultimately led to Soeharto's fall, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, then serving as the armed forces' chief of staff for territorial affairs, defended the government against its critics. He claimed that it had \"punished soldiers involved in 'backing' illegal operations\" and was \"dealing sternly with those involved in manipulation, embezzlement or corruption.\" There was little available information to support this contention, however, so observers remained highly skeptical.\n\nWhen Indonesia's first direct presidential elections in 2004 swept Yudhoyono to power and he selected Juwono Sudarsono as his defense minister, it opened up the possibility that long-stalled military reform, including reform of military financing, might gain new life. Yudyonono, known as a cautious reformer, had campaigned on an anti-corruption platform. Sudarsono was a prominent critic of military engagement in business activities.\n\nMilitary Resistance to Reform\n\nThe military leadership historically has been a major obstacle to reform of military financing. On occasion, usually under outside pressure, it has said it will consider withdrawing from military businesses. But such rhetoric has rarely been matched by action. To the contrary, over the years military leaders have acted repeatedly to block reform.\n\nThe armed forces generally have argued that they cannot afford to give up their economic ventures. Experience has shown, however, that they have strongly resisted reform even when accompanied by increased funds. In the 1950s, parliament debated how the central government might go about funding the military, but the military preferred to retain its financial autonomy. When high oil prices in the 1970s permitted an increase in the military budget, the Soeharto government made no serious effort to dismantle military businesses. Nor was the military leadership inclined to give them up. As summed up by political scientist Harold Crouch: \"Although the need for military units and individuals to depend on \"unconventional\" sources [of funds] had greatly declined, old habits die hard.\"\n\nWhen challenged by one or another scandal that came to public light, the military strongly defended its economic role. In 1995, for example, the chief of general staff of the armed forces, Lt. Gen. Soeyono, argued that the armed forces had as much right to participate in the economy as any other sector of society. Two years later, the spokesperson for the armed forces, Brig. Gen. Slamet Supriadi, made a similar argument, in his case referring specifically to military foundations and cooperatives through which the military was involved in private business:\n\nThese groups are part of the military structure and have a legitimate right to take part in business activities. They are looking after the welfare of armed forces personnel and society. So why bar them?\n\nShort-Lived Scrutiny\n\nThe power of the military-including its economic power-came under greater scrutiny in the wake of Soeharto's fall. Reformers inside the armed forces pushed to professionalize the security forces and had some limited success from 1999 to 2000. This period also was marked by increased attention to the question of military financing, and military business in particular.\n\nNongovernmental organizations (NGOs), think tanks, and scholars issued hard-hitting reports that documented the extent of military self-financing. Their strong critique of military business practices-including extensive illegal activities-drew considerable public attention. It made it more difficult for Indonesia's military leaders to deflect criticism as they always had, by asserting that illicit military businesses were carried out only by rogue elements in the TNI. The issue of military self-finance also caught the attention of the international donor community, which became concerned about the effect of the military's strong role in the economy on the country's development prospects. In particular, bilateral donors and multilateral financial institutions saw that military business undermined civilian governance, fueled criminality, and distorted markets by raising costs and reducing competition.\n\nRampant military corruption and outbreaks of violence tied to military economic interests also heightened calls for reform from within government. At one point, the then defense minister openly questioned the \"unclear legal status\" of many military businesses established under the rubric of military foundations and cooperatives. In 2000 a cabinet official announced that the government would try to halt its favored treatment of military businesses. Within the TNI, some officers recognized that military self-financing was deeply problematic.\n\nAs a result of growing pressure, some official audits were initiated in 2000 and 2001 (see below), but this progress was not sustained. Reform of financing was seen as too daunting a challenge in both financial and political terms. It would entail large expenditures to bring the military on budget. By one estimate offered in 2004, this could amount to additional expenditures equivalent to 1-3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nPolitically, it was difficult to overcome the powerful military lobby. The government of President Abdurrahman Wahid, the first of the reformasi era, attempted to confront the military-including regarding its economic power and dismal levels of transparency-but had to back down in the face of budget shortfalls and strong resistance from the military. Conservative elements in the military soon reasserted their authority over more reform-minded officers. (A main reformer, Lt. Gen. Agus Wirahadikusumah, lost his command partly in retribution for his efforts to expose financial improprieties. )\n\nThe resurgent military argued that it could not give up military businesses until the government provided full funding. President Megawati Sukarnoputri, who was elevated from the vice presidency in 2001 with the support of civilian political parties and the military faction in parliament, did not push that issue or other aspects of military reform. As a result, efforts to address military financing stalled. In 2001 the TNI convinced parliament that \"until such time that the Government is able to entirely fund the welfare requirements of the soldiers in a fitting manner, [its] venture in business will be tolerated.\"\n\nBy 2001 army leaders had for several years promised to address the military's business activities, but their words were not backed by action. TNI leaders had come to recognize that the military's business interests sullied its reputation, but the institution nevertheless clung to them out of a sense of self-preservation: the military had become dependent on the outside funds and did not trust that the government would look after its needs. Analysts observed that it would be years until the Indonesian government would be able to fully fund government operations from tax revenue and that, until that was achieved, \"the TNI will not give up one rupiah of its off-budget sources that it does not have to surrender.\"\n\nFailed \"Crackdowns\" on Illegal Businesses\n\nIllicit military economic activity remained in the spotlight following the brief period in which military businesses were under some official scrutiny. Attention to such activity, however, did not result in effective measures to halt it. Pronouncements related to military involvement in illegal logging usefully illustrate the failure to crack down on military economic activities that have clearly violated prevailing laws.\n\nIn 2001, a presidential decree (Presidential Instruction No. 5/2001) addressed in part the role of the military in illegal forestry operations. As later restated by former TNI chief Gen. Endriartono Sutarto, the order mandated him to \"take serious action,\" including administrative and criminal sanction, against \"any TNI personnel who are proven involved in illegal logging activities, transportation/distribution of illegal forest byproducts or timber smuggling.\" It also ordered \"serious action against foundations, cooperatives under TNI's umbrella, and their personnel that are involved in carrying out illegal logging activities and distribution of illegal forest byproducts.\" It highlighted in particular the need for the navy to \"take stern action\" against timber smuggling.\n\nNearly two years elapsed before he issued a directive to his troops related to any of those specific provisions. In early 2003, according to his own description, he issued a letter to all TNI personnel \"to prohibit and take decisive action against any TNI personnel who are proven to be involved, directly or indirectly, in illegal logging activities as well as in illegal transportation/distribution/smuggling of timber.\"\n\nHe did not indicate what measures, if any, were put in place to ensure compliance with that letter. His letter apparently did not address other elements of the presidential decree. Nor did he clarify whether anyone was in fact ever investigated and punished. Human Rights Watch is unaware of any crackdown on military involvement in illegal logging, prior to 2005, consistent with the language in the 2001 presidential decree. To the contrary, as of early 2005 the TNI had failed to act against a captain in the military police whom NGOs had accused two years earlier of deep involvement in illegal logging activities in Papua.\n\nA further military crackdown was announced in mid-2003, following a scandal over a murder-for-hire in which two people were killed (the case is described in more detail below). Sutarto vowed to make an example of the four active-duty marines accused in the case. Ultimately, two of the marines were court-martialed and convicted of the double murder. Sutarto also responded by issuing an order banning criminal activity by soldiers, including the protection of criminals:\n\nI have instructed all units to ensure that none of their soldiers are involved in (criminal) business. We will not tolerate that The TNI has dismissed many soldiers for this sort of thing and will continue to do so.\n\nPublicly available reporting indicates that some soldiers have been rounded up for their involvement in illegal economic activity, but they have almost invariably been low-ranking troops and have faced dismissal rather than legal action. For example, two soldiers and a staff official were dishonorably discharged for drug trafficking but were not reported to the police; a news report commented that it remained unclear if another seventy soldiers similarly dismissed for drug trafficking had ever been charged with a crime. Prosecutions of military personnel remain uncommon, particularly as compared to the frequency of crimes. Those prosecuted under the military court system are almost always low-ranking soldiers who face dismissal or light sentences if found guilty. (For a further discussion, see the section titled \"Plans Fail to Promote Accountability\" in Part III: Obstacles to Reform.)\n\nThe Situation Today\n\nThe September 2004 law mandating that the Indonesian military end its involvement in business was a watershed initiative, but one that left many questions unanswered. The language of the law is subject to multiple interpretations, and the provisions have not yet been enforced. Some preliminary steps have been taken but these have been slow and insufficient: the promise of the law remains untested. A more detailed critique is given below in the chapter on \"Obstacles to Reform.\" It finds that those in a position to make change happen have not shown a commitment to addressing the full costs of military self-finance, including in human rights terms. To the contrary, they have defined military business narrowly, focusing only on select elements of what is a much deeper structural problem, they have provided a number of exemptions that would leave vast parts of the military's commercial structure in place, and they have not pursued real accountability.\n\nII. An Anatomy of Military Economic Activity\n\nThis chapter outlines the main features of the military's economic activities and some of their negative consequences. It offers a typology of military economic ventures in Indonesia that places them in four broad categories: businesses owned or partly owned by the military, often via foundations and cooperatives; alliances with private businesses, many of which revolve around payments for security or other services; involvement in organized illicit business activity; and corruption. We explain the defining characteristics of each category and identify some sample ventures to show how the different kinds of economic activity play out in practice. Several of the examples illustrate that, in ways both large and small, military economic engagement helps undermine accountability, fuel conflict and criminality, and facilitate human rights abuses. This human rights analysis affords two key lessons: that the problem of military involvement in the economy is a serious one requiring immediate attention; and that any solution must be comprehensive in nature if it is to be effective.\n\nMilitary-Owned Businesses\n\nCompanies owned in whole or in part by the Indonesian military span the full range of the economy, from agribusiness to manufacturing and from golf courses to banks. In September 2005 the TNI complied with a request from the Ministry of Defense for an inventory of its business interests. (Preparation of the inventory was a first step toward implementing the TNI law passed a year earlier that mandated the transfer of these businesses to government control.) The initial inventory identified 219 military entities (foundations, cooperatives, and foundation companies) engaged in business activity. As of March 2006, the TNI had provided information on 1,520 individual TNI business units. (See Table 1, below.) By April 2006, the Ministry of Defense had initiated a separate review process to examine whether its three foundations were engaged in business activity.\n\nTable 1: TNI Inventory of Military Businesses\n\nInitial Inventory (September 2005)\n\nFoundations\n\n25\n\nCompanies under Foundations\n\n89\n\nCooperative Units Engaged in Business\n\n105\n\nRevised Inventory (March 2006)\n\nIndividual Business Units\n\n1520\n\nSource: Ministry of Defense letter to Human Rights Watch, December 22, 2005;\n\nMaj. Gen. Suganda, then TNI spokesman, \"TNI commits to reform[,] upholds supremacy of law,\" opinion-editorial, Jakarta Post, March 15, 2006.\n\nThe TNI and other authorities who have access to the inventory results have not publicly identified the individual business interests held by the military or provided information on their total value. Officials involved in the review of the military's businesses declined to share a copy of the inventory with Human Rights Watch, to provide the names of the businesses listed on it, or to reveal the businesses' total declared value. They said the data supplied by the TNI could not be considered final because it was \"very rough\" and included many entities that, in their view, did not constitute \"real businesses.\" According to these officials, the list incorporated many small-scale ventures, some with assets of negligible value, alongside other, much larger enterprises.\n\nMany of the military's business holdings are little more than empty partnerships. The military's stake in a company is typically a passive interest, also known as \"golden shares\" or \"goodwill shares,\" donated by the true investors with no expectation that the military will play an active role in the operation or management of the company. For example, in 2005, the commander of Kostrad (the army strategic reserve-see below) acknowledged publicly that over the years private investors had given Kostrad ownership stakes in various companies-and had done so for free. According to the Ministry of Defense, almost all TNI businesses have private-sector partners. Many are run as closely held companies, making it all the more difficult to obtain information on profits.\n\nSince the passage of the TNI law of 2004, the military has begun to liquidate some of its business holdings. The description below reflects the limited information that is publicly available about the extent of such restructuring. The military has argued that the TNI should be allowed to continue limited economic activity under its foundations and cooperatives. Thus, while some of the military's business investments have been dropped, the presumption here is that the overall structure of military economic activity has not fundamentally changed.\n\nInevitably, formalized military businesses have led to a variety of independent economic ventures by military officers. These officers also have many opportunities to use their positions of power and influence to establish business ventures on their own or with private partners. High-ranking officers are in the most advantageous position to make business connections and form private-sector alliances. In addition, many mid-level officers are believed to run small businesses to earn extra income. In one example, a military intelligence officer reportedly owned an ebony business in Central Sulawesi. Commonly, an officer's stake is assigned to his wife or another family member.\n\nIt is worth noting that in many cases, though not all, the private business holdings of retired military personnel can be traced to the military as an institution. Many military retirees launch businesses or form relationships with private entrepreneurs while on active duty. For example, the former armed forces commander General (ret.) Wiranto has stated that he intends to build a resort in Sukabumi, on the West Java coast, on land he obtained, along with permission to build, in the 1990s. Local farmers, however, say they have farmed that land since the late 1960s and, under an agrarian reform law, claim to own it Wiranto was a very senior official throughout the 1990s but was suspended from the post of security minister early in 2000 following allegations he presided over atrocities in East Timor.\n\nFoundations\n\nMany important military business holdings have been established under the umbrella of tax-exempt foundations (yayasan). Military foundations were set up beginning in the 1960s to provide social services, such as housing and education, for the troops and their families. They soon expanded into businesses ventures as a way to generate revenue, ostensibly to pay for their welfare activities. The best known foundations have been those established by each of the service branches and special commands, as well as by TNI headquarters itself, but foundations also exist at other levels.\n\nDespite their nominally independent status, the military foundations were set up with funds donated by the government. As acknowledged by a senior Indonesian military official, Lt. Gen. Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, for thirty years under Soeharto the military foundations benefited from monopoly control in many areas, priority for government licenses, and more generally the full backing and authority of an authoritarian government. As a result, the military's foundations were economically prominent during the Soeharto years. They declined sharply in value as a result of the Asian financial crisis and poor management. Increased competition also was a factor. Military businesses still enjoyed certain privileges but after Soeharto's fall they lost their dominance in many sectors. Some military-owned businesses were forced to close, while others underwent major changes.\n\nAdditional changes were required to comply with a 2001 law on foundations. That law specified that foundations could take part in business activities only indirectly through related entities whose activities were consistent with the foundation's designated social (or religious or humanitarian) purpose. This measure prompted military foundations to restructure their business interests and place them under holding companies. A separate provision in the law set a limit on the profit-making of foundations by capping investments at 25 percent of their assets.\n\nFoundations also continued to benefit from government resources. At least through 2001 government funds continued to flow to the foundations to help cover operational expenses, according to a government auditor who reviewed their accounts. Speaking that year, the auditor added that the military foundations \"can and usually do take advantage of the resources and mandate of the founding department or agency\" and were operated and managed by active military personnel: \"In effect, these yayasans operate as quasi-governmental agencies.\" The Indonesian government acknowledged this was true in a 2003 statement that referred to \"military and other foundations receiving state funds or financing state activities.\" In 2006, Lt. Gen. (ret.) Agus Widjojo, the former TNI chief of staff for territorial affairs and former deputy speaker of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) from the armed forces faction, independently affirmed that, despite changes to staff the foundations with retired (rather than active-duty) personnel, they nevertheless retained strong ties to the military institution: \"De facto, practically speaking, the foundations were established by the military command and the military command feels they own the foundation.\"\n\nEach service branch has at least one foundation, and each foundation typically has at least one holding company that invests in individual businesses on the foundation's behalf. The foundations may have sole or majority interest in the businesses but, as noted, often hold a minority stake though shares donated by private partners. (See \"Illustrative Diagram of a Military Business,\" below.)\n\nIllustrative Diagram of a Military Business\n\nNote: This example is provided here to demonstrate the ownership structure of military businesses and does not purport to make a substantive claim about the businesses listed. It is based on information provided by TNI headquarters and supplemented by two people familiar with the navy's businesses because they reviewed them (in one case, as part of an internal review by the navy and in the other independently). (Information as of May 2006.)\n\nNavy: Yayasan Bhumyamca (Yasbhum). Established in 1964, Yasbhum had thirty-two companies in 2000. The number of navy-owned companies had dwindled to six by late 2004, according to the then navy chief of staff, Adm. Bernard Kent Sondakh, who said these would be sold off to the private sector. Information provided by TNI headquarters, however, listed the navy as owning one holding company and fifteen individual businesses as of early 2006. (See \"Illustrative Diagram of a Military Business,\" above.) The TNI also identified two other navy foundations, Yayasan Nala and Yayasan Hangtuah, without indicating if they owned businesses.\n\nTNI headquarters: Yayasan Markas Besar ABRI (Yamabri). Founded in 1995 with a combination of military and civilian ownership and initial capital of only Rp. 25 million ($11,250), it quickly expanded. In 2004, it was believed to have holdings in agribusiness, mining, communications, transport, and a convention hall. That year, the then TNI chief Gen. Endriartono Sutarto indicated that the total value of military businesses under TNI headquarters was no more than Rp. 100 billion ($11 million).\n\nMinistry of Defense: Yayasan Kejuangan Panglima Besar Sudirman (YKBPS). In 2006, YKBPS owned three universities, a high school, and hospital. A second foundation, Yayasan Kesejahteraan Perumahan Prajurit (YKPP), was involved in housing, while the ministry's third foundation, Yayasan Satya Bhakti Pertiwi (YSBP), had numerous profit-oriented companies.\n\nCooperatives\n\nMilitary cooperatives form part of the national cooperative movement in Indonesia and, as such, are supposed to exist for the mutual benefit of their members and to be collectively controlled by these members, as well as by a national law on cooperatives. Like military foundations, however, military cooperatives have strayed far from their stated purpose. Initially established with troop welfare in mind-to provide subsidized commodities, such as rice, to soldiers and families-they soon became a vehicle for business ownership. The business activities of military cooperatives have tended to receive less scrutiny than those of military foundations. This has helped feed the often-false perception that military cooperatives merely serve as discount stores for the troops. Yet many cooperatives actually raise revenue not only from membership dues but also from wide-ranging business activities, including investments in private companies. Military cooperatives, for example, have owned stakes in numerous hotels and a cargo company. As with foundations, many are privately held companies so financial data can be difficult to obtain.\n\nTable 2: Businesses Owned by Military Cooperatives\n\nService Branch\n\nNumber of Businesses\n\nInternal Capital\n\nExternal Capital\n\nDividend\n\nArmy\n\n923\n\nRp. 169 billion\n\n($17 million)\n\nRp. 38 billion\n\n($4 million)\n\nRp. 13 billion\n\n($1.3 million)\n\nAir Force\n\n147\n\nRp. 40 billion\n\n($4 million)\n\nRp. 9 billion\n\n($900,000)\n\nRp. 4 billion\n\n($400,000)\n\nNavy\n\n124\n\nRp. 95 billion\n\n($9.5 million)\n\nRp. 8 billion\n\n($800,000)\n\nRp. 4 billion\n\n($400,000)\n\nSource: Ridep Institute, Practices of Military Business, citing statistics from the planning bureau of the Ministry of Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises, 2001.\n\nThe cooperatives of the military exist for each service branch and follow the territorial command structure. In the case of the army, for example, the Army Parent Cooperative (Induk Koperasi Angkatan Darat or Inkopad) corresponds to army headquarters, the Army Central Cooperative (Pusat Koperasi Angkatan Darat or Puskopad) to the regional military command, and the Army Primary Cooperative (Primer Koperasi Angkatan Darat or Primkopad) to the sub-regional military command level. District level offices and local posts also exist. Military cooperatives for the other services include Inkopau and Primkopau, in the case of the air force, and Inkopal and Primkopal for the navy.\n\nAn example provided below addresses military investments in forestry and agribusiness activity in East Kalimantan. In that case, an army cooperative had a minority share in a privately established company and also had its representatives on the board of the company, so the business ties were formalized. Informal business ventures are addressed separately in this chapter, in the section below on military alliances with the private sector, which includes the informative example of a military cooperative involved in coal mining activities.\n\nExample 1:Military Investments in East Kalimantan\n\nMilitary ownership in private companies is often hidden, but with assistance from NGO colleagues in the area Human Rights Watch was able to trace military interests in forestry operations in an area of East Kalimantan, near the border with Malaysia. The case of a series of military companies that held investments in the regency of Nunukan offers insight into military involvement in business. It also sheds light on some of the negative social and environmental consequences of this activity. Over the years, officials and local residents have accused military-associated businesses in the area of contributing to illegal logging, environmental destruction, and social tensions.\n\nMilitary Stake in Forestry Operations\n\nIn 1967, citing \"national security considerations\" in the wake of a border dispute, the Indonesian government granted a military-owned company, PT Yamaker, concession rights on a huge tract of land covering more than one million hectares along the Indonesia-Malaysia border. With this move, it dispossessed indigenous communities of their customary land. It also set in motion a pattern that would persist for decades: military economic interests in the forestry sector would take precedence over the interests of local communities.\n\nFor decades, Yamaker grossly mismanaged the land. Local indigenous communities charged that overlogging by Yamaker disrupted their livelihoods and traditions and left \"only forests with no trees.\" The communities experienced additional hardship when Yamaker blocked access to the land, which it did routinely on the pretext of security. After the downfall of the Soeharto government in 1998 that ushered in the reformasi era, the new government investigated and exposed massive timber smuggling by Yamaker. The then minister of forestry and plantations, Muslimin Nasution, denounced the company for conducting its business in an illegal manner, failing to promote the welfare of area residents, and having \"plundered [the forests] on a vast scale.\" Acting on those findings, in 1999 the government revoked the entire Yamaker concession.\n\nThe military nonetheless retained strong ties to that land. The new concession holder, the state-owned timber company Perhutani, partnered with the Inkopad army cooperative that had logging operations within the ex-Yamaker site. The military also provided security to Perhutani. Rather than directly engage in logging operations in the area themselves, the military instead partnered with foreign investors from Malaysia for that purpose.\n\nMilitary-Private Partnership\n\nIn 2000, Inkopad's economic stake in the ex-Yamaker land deepened further. That year it partnered with a Malaysian company, Beta Omega Technologies (BOT), that planned to develop an oil palm plantation and processing factory on land in and near Nunukan regency. Inkopad became part-owner of the BOT subsidiary set up in Indonesia, Agrosilva Beta Kartika (ABK), and had several representatives on its board.\n\nThese military connections helped the new company secure permissions and negotiate further deals. ABK gained the local government's approval to cut timber on the land to prepare it for palm oil planting. Local officials said they expected the company to clear some 150 thousand hectares of land in the regency. From an early stage, it was clear ABK planned to log the area and sell the resulting timber. To assist ABK, the Nunukan government agreed to facilitate a minimum production target of fifty thousand cubic meters of lumber per year. (The then Nunukan regent also signed a contract to gain a partial ownership stake in ABK, though it remained unclear if he did so in his individual or official capacity.)\n\nThese plans upset local indigenous communities living in the Simenggaris area, a forested zone in the interior of Nunukan regency along the border with Malaysia. A letter signed by some twenty community leaders outlined their concerns. They objected to the palm oil project on the grounds that it threatened to destroy the forest on which they depended for food, wood, and traditional medicinal plants. In addition, the collection of non-timber forest products such as rattan by local communities was an economic lifeline, second in importance only to agriculture, and they derived additional income from occasional logging activities in the forests. Nunukan residents already had the experience of severe forest depletion from logging operations in the area. The leaders of the area also urged that the project not move forward without proper consultation and the consent of the community. The leaders expressly opposed the involvement of the military in logging activities, stating \"We are no longer willing to endure the same experience as [we had] with PT Yamaker.\"\n\nFears about the potential for overlogging were also informed by suspicion that the oil palm project might be nothing more than a cover to clear-cut forested areas for a quick profit, with no plantation ever being built. The practice has been prevalent enough in Indonesia to have earned a nickname, the \"plantation hoax.\" NGOs have estimated that only 10 percent of the three million hectares of East Kalimantan forest allocated to oil palm concessions has actually been converted into working plantations. Specialists who examined Nunukan's soil as part of an independent environmental study determined that it was generally not suitable for oil palm. In addition, the conversion of forest to other uses, including oil palm plantations, contributed to the degradation of Nunukan's forests. A related study found that about one-quarter of the primary forest in Nunukan's formerly lush river basin had been lost over a seven-year period.\n\nNunukan officials declared in 2001 that ABK's Malaysian parent company BOT would invest at least $4.3 million to build an oil palm plantation and factory in the area, and that the project would employ as many as thirty-five thousand workers locally. Ignoring community concerns and requests for consultation, in mid-2001 the then regent gave the Inkopad army cooperative and ABK permission to proceed with the project. Community members issued protest letters to no avail. Later that year ABK contracted a Malaysian firm to clear land in the vicinity of Nunukan regency and market the timber on its behalf.\n\nA Pattern Repeats\n\nBy mid-2004, a new regent complained publicly that authorities in the region had granted logging permits too readily to unnamed forestry companies that promised to invest in oil palm plantations but instead only cut trees for export to Malaysia. He accused these companies of destroying some twenty-five thousand hectares of forests in Nunukan and contributing to the problem of illegal logging. The regent also pointed to a social cost. According to him, the episode sparked tensions and social unrest as people grew frustrated over promised plantation jobs that never materialized.\n\nThe events that followed indicate the regent was referring to ABK. The contractor working for ABK was unable to renew its timber license after April 2004. The parent company in Malaysia, BOT, did not respond to questions from Human Rights Watch, but according to its joint-venture partner, Inkopad, ABK ceased operations on July 9, 2004, and subsequently lost its permits. In August 2004, regional authorities said they would investigate the regent's allegations before taking action against any company. In December 2004, NGOs have reported, an official Department of Interior investigation concluded that ABK had engaged in extensive illegal logging and cross-border timber sales. That same month, the public record shows, the Indonesian Department of Forestry withdrew ABK's permit.\n\nIn an echo of the Yamaker experience years earlier, a military-linked company once again had been accused of breaking the law, causing environmental destruction, and contributing to social upheaval, and the only penalty was eventual loss of its concession rights. To Human Rights Watch's knowledge, the military entities were not otherwise punished for their involvement in illegal activity, the individuals involved did not face prosecution, and the local community was not compensated for the damage done to the land. Inkopad told Human Rights Watch that it relinquished its shares in ABK and returned them to the parent company, BOT of Malaysia. The army cooperative declined to address its role in logging activities, land disputes, or environmental concerns associated with its business investment in Nunukan. On this point, its written response to Human Rights Watch stated, \"Inkopad is no longer connected to problems related to [the planned] palm oil plantation in Simenggaris [area], Nunukan regency, East Kalimantan.\"\n\nThe issue was unlikely to end there, however. In 2005, the Indonesian government announced a plan to develop the largest oil palm plantation in the world along the Malaysia-Kalimantan border area. Nunukan was one of several regencies anticipated to host the massive plantation. Environmentalists, international officials, and even the palm oil producers association lined up against the project. In response to critics, the Indonesian government announced that it would reduce the size of the planned plantation, and avoid placing it on land designated for an international conservation initiative to preserve the area's biodiversity, but that it still intended to move forward with the project in the Kalimantan border area. There was also controversy over the prospect that the project would provide a new excuse for the military to engage in forestry activities under the pretext of security. Human Rights Watch learned independently that the military had a stake in several forest concession areas elsewhere in Kalimantan that were slated for conversion to oil palm.\n\nMilitary Collaboration with Private Businesses\n\nAlliances with corporations or private entrepreneurs account for a vast part of the TNI's extensive business interests. Often the military partners with foreign investors. Private businesspeople, whether domestic or foreign, have different reasons to enter into an alliance with the military. They may seek, for example, to curry favor with powerful individuals who can advance their business. The military's ability to arrange government licenses or block competition has diminished in recent years, but particularly at the local level, military officers retain the role of gatekeeper. Businesspeople also choose to align themselves with the military to gain access to goods and services. For example, the military provides transport services on military vehicles for a fee, leases out land, and trades in items such as fuel, timber, and coffee.\n\nIn an example described to Human Rights Watch, in 2004 a private business operated on military-owned land in Jakarta, for which the owner paid a monthly fee of Rp. 30 million ($3,300) directly to the unit. When he refused a demand by a military unit to raise the monthly fee, the unit shut down his business until a compromise was reached. The monthly payments went directly to the unit without being reported to public accounts.\n\n\"Acquaintance Funds\": Private Contributions to the Military\n\nThe military's alliances with business also can involve solicitation for contributions. Businesses raise money for the military for operations and provide in-kind support, such as vehicles or office equipment. In one example that was publicly reported, a developer provided land and buildings worth Rp. 18.5 billion ($1.95 million) to locate an army base inside a West Java industrial zone known as Jababeka. The donation made good business sense, an official of the industrial zone argued, since the presence of military personnel \"can deter people from carrying out crimes here.\"\n\nIn other cases, an analyst explained, \"[t]he local military commander just picks up a phone to get money [from business patrons].\" The proceeds from these informal arrangements are sometimes referred to as \"acquaintance funds\" or \"help from friends.\" Lt. Gen. (ret.) Agus Widjojo acknowledged to Human Rights Watch that \"it happens that business people make contributions\" but stated that such arrangements have become less common than since the late 1990s: \"Then it was easy [for a military officer] to approach a business to say what you need. Not now. The police are taking over the roles outside of defense.\"\n\nPayments for Security Services\n\nThe Indonesian military makes itself available to provide security services for private interests. Different military units earn money by forming private security companies, and individual commanders charge a fee to loan out their troops as private guards. Some military officers who arrange such security services are later hired on by the companies they protected, to serve as security managers for company facilities. More famously, the TNI provides security to large multinational companies. In Indonesia, companies that operate facilities that the government has declared to be \"vital national assets\" are required to have protection. In practice, it has usually been the TNI that fills this role, despite a 2004 presidential decree that officially shifted the responsibility to guard such facilities to the police. For example, Indonesian authorities certified in January 2006 that the TNI would guard the facilities of three companies because neither the company nor the police could ensure adequate security. The reliance of major companies, particularly in the extractive sector, on state security forces (military and/or police) to protect their installations in remote and dangerous locations around the world can be rife with problems if the arrangements are not carefully managed. In Indonesia, questions surrounding company payments for military security are acute because of the armed forces' record of corruption and human rights violations.\n\nCompanies can come under strong pressure to underwrite the expenses of military forces assigned to protect their facilities, so they do not always feel they have a choice. A former international executive commented to Human Rights Watch in frustration: \"The way Indonesia sets up funding of the police and military is one grand national extortion racket.\" A former employee of a multinational company offered this view to a researcher:\n\nIt is true that the Indonesian military is underpaid and under-equipped, and the housing they are provided is terrible. But is it the company's place to subsidize the Indonesian military?\n\nThis same person referred more directly to financial demands made by the military:\n\nThe problem was never with Jakarta as such, not with the military hierarchy there. The biggest problem has always been with the local military. Basically once we started to pay we were backed into a corner. The demands always came in for more money.\n\nMoreover, Indonesian troops often are accused of using intimidation and violence in the course of \"protecting\" private companies. (See \"Freeport's Security Arrangements,\" below.) In one example, a pending 2001 lawsuit accuses ExxonMobil of complicity in gross abuses allegedly carried out by Indonesian security forces in and near the site of the company's operations in Aceh, while the company strongly disputes the claim that it bears any responsibility. A coalition of environmental and indigenous rights groups described an incident in North Maluku in late 2003 in which they alleged that armed soldiers paid by a mining company delivered written notice threatening protesters with arrest if they did not leave that company's mine site.\n\nFreeport's Security Arrangements\n\nA well-known case of security arrangements involving the Indonesian military and police is that of U.S.-based mining giant Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc., which has extensive operations in Papua through its subsidiary, PT Freeport Indonesia. The TNI has had a presence alongside Freeport for decades, but the security presence has expanded considerably over time: as of 2005, more than 2,400 government security personnel (military and police) were located in the general area of Freeport's operations.\n\nSecurity-Related Controversies\n\nFreeport's security arrangements have been controversial in a number of respects. First, Freeport's ties to the military have led to accusations of complicity in human rights abuses by these forces. In the mid-1990s, troops at the mine site allegedly used company vehicles, offices, and shipping containers to transport and detain people they then tortured or killed. The company said it bore no responsibility for how its equipment was used by the military. Freeport's human rights policy, adopted years after these events, explicitly recognizes the risk that military or police personnel may misuse company equipment and facilities to commit abuses.\n\nSecond, there has been widespread speculation that the military intimidated Freeport into providing financial support at its Grasberg mine in Papua. The New York Times has repeated claims that the August 2002 killings of three Freeport employees in an ambush near the town of Timika may have been carried out by soldiers to ensure the continuation of paid security arrangements, as initially suspected by police. The TNI has disputed such claims in the strongest terms, Freeport has said it has no independent knowledge of who perpetrated the ambush, and a joint investigation by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Indonesian police did not find evidence of military involvement.The allegation resurfaced after the FBI's prime suspect was arrested, together with several other Papuans, in January 2006. The suspect confessed to firing on the convoy of Freeport vehicles but also sought to implicate the military in the crime. According to his lawyer, a soldier provided the bullets used in the ambush and three men in military uniform also took part in the ambush.\n\nThird, serious questions have been raised regarding the financial ties between the company and the Indonesian security forces. Following the Timika killings, investors concerned about the company's links to the military in Indonesia successfully pressured Freeport to reveal its spending on security. The company first publicly disclosed this information in 2003 and has reported annually since then. By the end of 2005, the company's total spending on the military and police had topped $66 million. Much of the company's support was provided in-kind, in the form of barracks, transport, food, and other such items, but Freeport also provided financial support. In explaining these payments, Freeport has said, \"At the [Indonesian] Government's request, we provide financial support to ensure that [its] security personnel (the military and police) have the necessary and appropriate resources to provide security for our operations.\" The company, however, has not responded to queries seeking to establish to whom it made the payments and whether the payments went to government accounts. When it first disclosed its security payments, in 2003, a spokesperson for Freeport's Indonesia subsidiary stated:\n\nMany were shocked when they found out that we allocated millions of U.S. dollars to security personnel to guard the company, because they thought that we gave it in cash. But it is not like that because we allocated the funds to several posts, of which only a small amount was given to soldiers in cash as allowances.\n\nInvestigative reports published in 2005 by the NGO Global Witness and the New York Times, by contrast, suggested that Freeport directed a large portion of its security payments to individuals. These reports alleged that the company had made large, direct payments to individual Indonesian military and police officers, as well as to units in the field. The New York Times, citing company documents it obtained and verified as authentic, said such payments totaled about $20 million from 1998 to 2004. The Times reported that the company doled out large sums of money that it recorded under accounting categories such as \"food costs\" and \"monthly supplement,\" but the bulk of the funds in fact were at the personal disposal of the commanders. Freeport asserted that the Times \"mischaracterized the support we provide for Indonesian security forces and ignored the practicalities of conducting business in a remote area.\"\n\nIndonesian military officials acknowledged that the company had provided assistance and confirmed that it was circulated to units in the field and did not go to the armed forces \"as an institution.\" The TNI has argued that the deployment of soldiers at the Grasberg mine and other designated vital facilities was in keeping with the duty of the TNI and took place upon the request of the companies involved, the regional governments, and the national police. Officials also have maintained that the government covers the essential costs associated with troop deployments, and Freeport provides additional support \"without obligation.\" Regarding Freeport's financial arrangements with the military, the TNI has stated that \"institutionally the TNI has never received security money from Freeport but our members who were assigned there did receive money from the company as logistics funds.\"\n\nSuch admissions helped propel the call by Global Witness for an investigation into possible bribery-related charges against Freeport under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. After Indonesian officials indicated that direct payments to officers and soldiers could constitute corruption under Indonesian law, in early 2006 U.S. authorities initiated \"informal inquiries.\" Freeport staunchly defended the legality of its security arrangements and said it was cooperating with these inquiries. The Indonesian defense minister also indicated that he would ask the armed forces inspector general to open an inquiry.\n\nFreeport's payments to the police have received less attention but raise similar issues. Global Witness and the New York Times cited examples of cash payments to senior police officials in Papua. Earlier published accounts suggest that the company did not find it unusual to be solicited for funds. According to a 2001 press account, a member of Freeport Indonesia's board of directors, Prihadi Santoso, received a request for a Rp. 100 million ($10,000) loan from a person falsely claiming to be the then Papua police chief. Prihadi reportedly acted to authorize the requested bank transfer but later cancelled the remittance after the police chief's office denied having issued the request. Freeport declined to respond to a question from Human Rights Watch about the incident. Company payments to the police are likely to receive greater scrutiny if the TNI withdraws from the Freeport mine area, as it has said it intends to do, and the police increase their presence.\n\nFreeport's Perspective\n\nFreeport has had little to say publicly, but a spokesperson has denied that it made inappropriate payments:\n\nWe don't bribe. We do give assistance to the military, not in cash, but in the form of field equipment such as hand talky [portable two-way radio], cars, food.All payments are transparent and reported to the New York Stock Exchange. And assisting security personnel on duty is just normal. If you give some food to your starving guard, that is normal, right?\n\nA former Freeport executive familiar with security arrangements in Indonesia told Human Rights Watch that cash disbursements, made by bank transfer or check, accounted for about 15 percent of the total funds Freeport spent on the Indonesian security forces (the rest being used for in-kind goods and services). According to this source, the money was used for three purposes:\n\n\"Small per diem payments\" to supplement troop salaries. For a time, the payments were made to local commanders, but after the company insisted that the units establish bank accounts Freeport subsequently transferred funds to those accounts. Due to an \"administrative mislabeling\" some of these cash payments were listed as food costs in the company's accounts until this practice was corrected.\n\nReimbursements for administrative and logistical costs incurred by the military units in the field, such as for communications or use of helicopters, that the company provided in view of its assessment that \"the [budgeted] money out of Jakarta is not enough for normal operations.\" The company's payments for this purpose amounted to approximately $1000 to $1500 per month for the regional military command (Kodam).\n\nFinancing for individual \"development\" projects requested by the military, such as for hospital renovations. The company performed spot checks on about one-in-five of the projects.\n\nThe former Freeport executive also maintained that the flow of funds to the military was governed by procedures outlined in a \"written support agreement,\" or, as other Freeport executives described it, \"a contract with the military of the [security] relationship.\" That document was submitted to the military commander in Jayapura, capital of Papua province, as well as to his police counterpart, the executives said, but was returned unsigned. The former executive maintained that the provisions of the unsigned agreement were nevertheless in effect and had been adhered to by both sides.\n\nThe former executive defended the decision to bypass military headquarters in Jakarta by stating that corruption in the chain of command would prevent the funds from reaching the troops. Making the payments through commanders in Papua, he argued, \"helped us and it helped them. We could avoid the extortion and extracurricular activities [by the military] and they could close the gap between what they needed and the available funds.\" Asked why the company withheld details about its payments to individuals by only reporting aggregate amounts, this person said he could not be sure but thought that Freeport's top management did not want to draw additional attention to an issue that already was \"a magnet for controversy.\"\n\nThe former executive stated that the company made its security arrangements bilaterally, through a direct relationship with the military on the ground rather than through civilian government structures, because there was no government regulatory authority to fill that coordination role for the mining industry. He also repeated company claims that Freeport's financial support to the military (and police) was a requirement of its Contract of Work (CoW) signed with the Indonesian government. Freeport's spokesman, Greg Probst, explained the company's rationale in 1999:\n\nThe original CoW [from 1967] was less specific in these areas [related to the relationship with the military] than the 1991 CoW. However, in a review of this issue, our Indonesian outside counsel found that the provisions of our [1967] CoW must be read in context with Indonesian law and that the two together provide a clear obligation on the part of [Freeport] to provide logistical and infrastructure support to the Government, including both military and civilian personnel, in all areas in which the government cannot supply such services.\n\nThis issue has been under dispute. The author of a book on Freeport as well as the New York Times reported that the CoW has no language that requires security payments. Human Rights Watch's understanding is that the CoW, as updated in 1991, contains only a general reference that the company \"has been and will continue to be required to develop special facilities and carry out special functions for the fulfillment\" of the CoW.\n\nConclusion\n\nFreeport has said it wishes to avoid controversy but it instead appears to invite it by what it says and declines to say publicly. On key issues related to its security arrangements in Indonesia, the company has offered public explanations that are open to question. The company has maintained that it is required to provide financial support to Indonesian security forces but has not provided sufficient evidence to bolster that claim, even when directly asked. Government officials, meanwhile, insist that the company's support is entirely voluntary. It is also difficult to reconcile the company's position that its support is fully compliant with the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, a set of international guidelines designed to ensure that company security arrangements respect human rights. The Voluntary Principles presume maximum transparency for security arrangements, including any payments, subject only to overriding safety considerations or security situations.\n\nMoreover, if Freeport's decision to make payments at the local level and to seek to avoid scrutiny by withholding details about those payments was intended as a way to avoid corruption and also the glare of publicity, then it failed on both fronts. Payments to commanders and units in the field, which the former executive maintained were designed to avoid centralized corruption, served instead to raise allegations of local-level corruption by Freeport. By the same token, the company's unwillingness to fully disclose its payments at the outset, and when asked subsequently, has encouraged suspicion that it has something to hide. The misidentification of payments, as food costs rather than cash transfers, also lends itself to the implication that employees had sought to cover up the company's financial support. In short, Freeport's actions were insufficient to avoid the potential problems it identified and instead created vexing new ones.\n\nThe wave of negative publicity surrounding the military's ties to Freeport led Indonesian Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono in early 2006 to offer to prepare official guidelines on companies' security arrangements, including associated payments. An alliance of Indonesian civil society groups, however, strongly challenged the assumption that it was appropriate for companies to directly underwrite the military. They pointed out that such arrangements give the military an economic stake in internal security tasks for which the police have primary responsibility. The groups added that company payments compromise the country's security forces, since they could cause these forces to put the interest of companies ahead of their duties to the public. Another criticism that often has been made, including by civil society groups, is that financial arrangements with companies provide a platform for military corruption and serve to undermine civilian control. It also often has been suggested, as in the Freeport case, that paid security arrangements create incentives for the military in the area to cause security disturbances so they can reap the financial benefits when they are called in to assist. In short, the military is in a position to create and sustain demand for its services. Concern over the potential for human rights abuse, as noted above, provides another reason for opposition to the military's role in providing security to companies. A case described in detail below shows how troops from a military cooperative, brought in at the request of a mining company, used abusive tactics to keep unlicensed miners in line.\n\nExample 2: Military Coal Mining and Human Rights in South Kalimantan\n\nWhen PT Arutmin, an Indonesian-owned mining company with operations in South Kalimantan, was faced with illegal mining in its concession areas, it turned to the security forces for help. After the police response proved inadequate, the company engaged the military-through a loose partnership with an army cooperative-to help control illegal mining at its Senakin mine.\n\nArmy Cooperative Regularizes Illegal Mining\n\nThe role of the army cooperative was to act as an intermediary to help reduce the illegal mining activities of local residents who used heavy equipment to mine tons of surface coal. The active-duty soldiers who worked in the cooperative were to organize the unlicensed local miners and ensure they turned the coal over for delivery to the company. In exchange, the army cooperative got to earn a profit from the resale of the coal.\n\nNeither the army cooperative nor Arutmin responded to Human Rights Watch's requests for information. A representative of the contractor for Arutmin's operations at the Senakin mine, however, publicly explained the set-up under which the military (and police, at another mine location) organized illegal miners with the concession-holder's permission:\n\nI actually wouldn't even call it illegal [mining] now. It is semi-organized subcontracting direct to Arutmin, who have now got the whole thing under control.\n\nOnce the army cooperative had a financial stake in coal mining operations, it soon slipped into a realm outside the rule of law. Soldiers not only channeled to the company the coal mined by the illegal miners, as envisioned, but demanded bribes from the miners to allow black market coal sales. The army cooperative also exploited the miners. Soldiers demanded bribes, paid the miners a fraction of the value of the coal, and often did not pay them for months at a time. Moreover, the soldiers used coercion and violence to enforce their cooperative's control. Miners told Human Rights Watch of beatings and other abuse.\n\nThe account here focuses on military abuses committed against coal miners who were controlled by the army cooperative under this arrangement. As explained to Human Rights Watch by several miners, the regional army cooperative for South Kalimantan, Puskopad B, issued permits to miners granting them permission to mine on the Arutmin concession, required them to sell the mined coal back to the cooperative for it to resell to Arutmin at a large profit, and used intimidation and force to keep the miners in line. This was lucrative business for Puskopad, which paid the miners only about half the market value for their coal (approximately Rp. 3"
