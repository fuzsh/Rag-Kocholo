        "text": "Hello, Indonesia. Recently, I had the opportunity to speak at MBA Catalyst Summit 2024, organized by MBA Student Association FEB UGM and MBASA UGM Jakarta in collaboration with MM FEB UI. Sharing the stage with Sime Darby Chief Information & Digital Officer Dr. Deny Rahardjo, we discussed about how AI is transforming business to more than 200 MBA student participants. The transformation opportunities are clear: with its position as a copilot, AI can be used to enrich employee experiences, reinvent customer engagement, reshape business process, and bend the curve on innovation. In Indonesia, organizations across scale and industries have started to unlock these opportunities, and I'm excited to see how the MBA students will also unleash the opportunities in their business or organizations. Together, we continue joining hands to accelerate AI economy in Indonesia. Thank you Ir Lingga for moderating the session. Special thanks also to Elviliana and MBA Catalyst Summit 2024 committee for inviting me to this summit. #BerdayakanIndonesia Andrea Ajar Deni Dwi Edy Elly Krishna Linda Lucky Maya Nina panji Sianto Karen Fiki Ricky\n\nHi, Indonesia. More than 1 billion people worldwide experience some form of disability, but only 1 in 10 have access to the assistive technology they need. This means many individuals cannot truly participate in our economies and societies. It is why Microsoft makes accessibility a culture in our workplace. From having everyone in mind when designing our products hence enabling greater digital inclusion with our accessibility features, ensuring we hire regardless of people disabilities, to providing upskilling for people with disabilities. As such, when PT Pertamina (Persero) invited us to take part in their \"Empowering Employee with Disabilities Training\", we were beyond thrilled. We provided trainings related to Microsoft Office for two days straight by designing the modules according to what the employees' needs: utilizing Microsoft Office optimally in their day to day works, including by using the accessibility features. This training extends Microsoft and Pertamina's collaboration in realizing Diversity and Inclusion at work. Previously, we have worked together to upskill women employees with relevant digital skills through Code; Without Barriers program. Thank you Pak Erry Sugiharto and Pak Muhammad Sodiqin for continuing to partner with Microsoft in your journey to a more diverse and inclusive work in Indonesia! #BerdayakanIndonesia Andrea Krishna Ajar Deni Dwi Edy Elly Linda Lucky Maya Nina panji Sianto Jati Karen Fiki Ricky\n\nHi, Indonesia. The latest Work Trend Index by Microsoft and LinkedIn reveals that AI at work is here in Indonesia. It raises the bar and breaks the career ceiling (read more here: https://lnkd.in/gCBTwzCQ). This trend has prompted educational institutions to also transform: integrating AI into teaching and learning models, while equipping students with the skills needed to thrive in today's AI era. Being very agile with this need, Universitas Terbuka has recently launched a new study program called Data Science. This program is critical as data is the new oil and the nutrition for AI (read more here: https://lnkd.in/gA7_V7Nm). At Microsoft, we are excited to support this program by working closely with Universitas Terbuka to integrate our data science-related learning materials into the program's curriculum. This collaboration with Universitas Terbuka is not a new one for us. We have been working together to integrate Azure OpenAI Service into Universitas Terbuka's AI Assistant; opening the potentials to empower up to 60,000 students across provinces. Read more here: https://lnkd.in/gpBabnyy Prof. Ojat Darojat, Pak Muhammad Yunus, Pak Rahmat Budiman, Bu Subekti Nurmawati, Pak Dimas Prasetyo, and Universitas Terbuka team, thank you for trusting us to take part in your AI transformation journey, and to support your mission in providing the world-class education that can reach all society. Looking forward to our closer collaboration in making the promise of AI real in Indonesia's education sector. #BerdayakanIndonesia Andrea Larry Maya Arief Ajar Deni Dwi Edy Elly Krishna Lucky Linda Maya Nina panji Sianto Fiki Ricky Karen\n\nHello, Indonesia. In the recently published Work Trend Index 2024, Microsoft and LinkedIn revealed that 76% of leaders in Indonesia would rather hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills than a more experienced candidate without them. This index is suggesting a new hiring imperative, where AI aptitude takes center stage. Understanding that situation, Microsoft Philanthropies has been joining hands with different local and international partners to ensure that every individual, regardless of their background, can harness the transformative power of technology. As a result, our skilling programs such as Skills for Jobs Indonesia, Talenta AI, and Ready4Security, have touched the lives of many; providing them with the skills they need to succeed in an AI-powered future. Read more about some of their stories below. A heartfelt thank you to the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, Kementerian Komunikasi dan Informatika Republik Indonesia, Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan (Ministry of Education and Culture Republic of Indonesia), Prakerja, Biji-biji Initiative, Infra Digital Foundation, Skilvul, and all esteemed partners involved in these programs. We look forward to collaborating with you even further to #BerdayakanIndonesia Andrea Supahrat Dania Hirania Ajar Deni Dwi Edy Elly Krishna Linda Lucky Maya Nina panji Sianto Karen Fiki Ricky\n\nHello, Indonesia. Do you know that there are more than 1 billion people with disabilities in the world and 650 million in Asia-Pacific? To enable inclusion of people with disabilities, at Microsoft, we believe accessibility is the vehicle. This is why we have been running Microsoft AI for Accessibility Hackathon since 2020: to highlight how technology can unlock solutions that empower people with disabilities and enable transformative change within communities. This year, in Indonesia, we are joining hands with Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia and BINUS University to run the hackathon. Among all the incredible idea coming from 57 teams who participated, two winners have been selected. Please join me to congratulate: Carbonara team from BINUS University who come up with \"WearMe\" idea. This is a mobile app designed to help people with visual impairment to find the most suitable/matching pair of clothes in the users' wardrobe, based on the needs, context, or simply personal preference. Combining the built-in NFC reader in mobile phone, RFID tag to give every clothes in the wardrobe a unique identifier, and Microsoft Azure AI services; the app will provide the users a brief description of the clothes, including the type, color, and pattern; and produce a beep sound when it's a match pair. Congratulations, Christopher Felix Atika and Natasha Grace Radika! TIMNAS team from Atma Jaya, who propose \"Suara Tangan\" idea. This is a machine learning-powered mobile app that could recognize and translate BISINDO (Indonesian Sign Language) to Indonesian language & vice versa in real time. The result of the translation will appear as a text based on the users' needs, utilizing Gesture to Text or Speech to Text capabilities. This app will also come with hands free features, such as gesture-based controls or voice-commands, to make it easier for users to access the application. Congratulations, Teresa Kaena, Runi Dwi Jiasta, Andrew Rafhael, Julius Kevin Raharjo, and Caroline Evarista! To every individual in the participating teams, all of you are a true winner. Thank you for spending the time and efforts to take part in this journey to a more inclusive world. Special thanks to Mbak Rahma U. from Suarise, who have been working closely with us in running this program and providing inputs to our participants. #BerdayakanIndonesia Krishna See Kie Arief Prasidhi Edhot Lukas Karen Juliana Andrea Ajar Deni Dwi Edy Elly Linda Lucky Maya Nina panji Sianto Fiki Ricky Rahul Pratima Supriya\n\nHi, Indonesia. Today, we launched Microsoft and LinkedIn’s Work Trend Index 2024 report featuring key figures and insights specific to Indonesia. It’s thrilling to see that 92% of Indonesian knowledge workers are already using generative AI at work! This figure is even higher than Asia Pacific (83%) and global (75%). With this high enthusiasm, the task for leaders now is to channel AI experimentation into business transformation. While it will look different for every organization, here’s how to get started: 1. Identify a business problem, then apply AI 2. Take a top-down, bottom-up approach 3. Prioritize training Check below for the key insights, and read more information on Indonesia figures here: https://lnkd.in/ghuS-fT4 Thank you Rohit Kalsy and Ricky Haryadi for joining me in publishing the Indonesia figures today! #BerdayakanIndonesia Andrea Ajar Deni Dwi Edy Elly Krishna Linda Lucky Maya Nina panji Sianto Fiki Karen\n\nHello, Indonesia.

Andrea Ajar Deni Dwi Edy Elly Krishna Linda Lucky Maya Nina panji Sianto Ricky Fiki Karen\n\nHi, Indonesia. I'm humbled to be recently invited to Mandiri Board Forum, where I shared the stage with Pak Alexander Ery Wibowo from PT Bayan Resources Tbk. to talk about culture transformation, and how it could drive innovation. Culture transformation is really a deliberate and comprehensive process that reshapes an organization’s existing culture to align with an organization's mission. It involves a fundamental shift in behaviors, systems, symbols, and storytelling in the entire organization. Of course, it's not a one-person or one-team transformation only. Everyone in the organization needs to take part in the culture transformation journey. And I'm enthusiastic with the response received in this forum! Thank you Pak Ronald S. and PT. Mandiri Capital Indonesia (MCI) for having me. #BerdayakanIndonesia Andrea Ajar Deni Dwi Edy Elly Krishna Linda Lucky Maya Nina panji Sianto Fiki Ricky Karen Sigit\n\nHello, Indonesia. I have been always passionate to talk with youths, the future of our nation. As a father to three preteens, I can feel their high curiosity, often get astonished with their never-ending questions, and energized with their passion to create a better future. To address the youths' needs and widen their perspective, I believe it's critical for them to talk with different people and gather various insights. This is the reason why I'm happy to recently speak at Sampoerna Academy's Grade 12 Graduation Ceremony, to share about the future of innovation and leadership in digital era. It was a lively session, where I could emphasize the era of AI transformation that we are currently in, the role of AI as a copilot, and the growing needs of skills required in this AI era. Happy graduation! Wishing your next journey to be an exciting one. Special thanks to Piero Botha for inviting me. #BerdayakanIndonesia Andrea Ajar Deni Dwi Edy Elly Krishna Linda Lucky Maya Nina panji Sianto Fiki Ricky Karen"
