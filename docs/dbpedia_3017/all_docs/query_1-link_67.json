When I hired Rohit to Singapore 4.5 years ago to lead emerging markets of Southeast Asia, it was a calculated risk. Though Rohit was thriving in his previous role, Southeast Asia was new to him. The nuances in language, culture and development of various markets also created a need for any leader to be highly culturally sensitive and environmentally aware. Upon taking up the role, Rohit immediately immersed himself in an accelerated learning journey - devoting time to meeting team and customers, devouring literature on culture of different markets, and seeking coaching from colleagues. There was never a time when he complained that things were tough (though I knew then they were). His love for his team and business allowed him to overcome the many challenges to build a strong foundation for growth. When he was later asked to assume the role of country manager for our Malaysia office, he was hard at work again - understanding regulatory and office details, rallying supporting functions to enhance employee morale, and reaching out to the broader Malaysian community to elevate LinkedIn's presence. Over the years, Rohit used the same passion and love he puts in his work to take on important assignments - double-hatting in a different function, piloting company initiatives and expanding our presence in public sector. Rohit doesn't just lead his team. He loves them! In return, his team love him back. I have been to several get-together where I personally witnessed the closeness and support his team have for him, as well as for one another. I realize that the commitment and dedication Rohit puts into his work out of love has resulted in a cascading effect of a highly cohesive team. As I go through my journey of researching on how people can find deep meaning in their work (I call it #NextplayRevolution), Rohit's example of bringing his love, passion and dedication to work shows me what good #NextplayLeaders can be. Have you come across people who love their work so much that it becomes a joy in their life?\n\nLet's face it - unleashing your full career and personal potential is going to take great resilience. Plans will change, projects will fail, goal posts will move - and you need to be able to bounce back and stay focused on your chosen direction and desired legacy. So how resilient are you? How do you increase it? What can you learn from your career journey so far? What key strengths and lived experiences can you draw upon to keep going? We cover this in our Aspire program, which is coming to Singapore on 7 & 8 November. Download our brochure and get in touch with Amanda Webb and Lisa Mulligan to learn more and book in. #Singapore #LeadershipDevelopment #CareerDevelopment\n\nAs the sun sets 🌇 on this year, I'm filled with gratitude and awe at the journey we've embarked on together. It's been 13 incredible years since I started my expat life, building businesses across Asia. This year, however, was particularly momentous. ☘️ Celebrating Our Collective Triumphs 🎉:The spirit and resilience of our team at Tech One Philippines have been nothing short of inspiring. We've soared to new heights, clinching accolades like the Microsoft Partner of the Year, and being recognized as the Best Workplace in 2023 in both Asia and the Philippines. These victories aren't just awards – they're a testament to our unbreakable bond and relentless drive. A Heartfelt Thanks to Our Customers and Partners🙏: I extend my deepest gratitude to our customers in the Philippines for entrusting us with your technology needs. Your belief in our capabilities fuels our journey. Additionally, a big thank you to our cloud partner alliance for your collaboration and technology innovation, essential in efficiently solving our customers' challenges. Nurturing Future Leaders 🌱: Mentoring young leaders has been a passion of mine for many years. This year, more than ever, I’ve seen the seeds of our efforts bloom. The opportunity to guide and inspire them has been a highlight of my journey. Witnessing their growth and helping them find their best selves is a rewarding experience that underscores the irreplaceable value of human guidance and connection in a world increasingly driven by technology. Invaluable Mentorship 🌟: A huge shoutout to boss Lars Bøgvad Jeppesen and other leaders in my brain trust for the mentorship that's been a guiding light. This year was a revelation in balancing emotional intelligence with the rigors of leadership. It’s a journey that has enhanced both my personal and professional growth. Forward with Purpose 💡: As we stand on the threshold of a new year, my heart is set on further refining my skills, embracing AI for good, and staying grounded in the values that define us as humans. I'm excited to embark on this journey of continuous improvement, leading with heart and conviction. Here's to a new year brimming with opportunities, growth, and human connection. Let's make it a year where we not only reach new heights but also deepen our roots in the values that make us who we are 🫶🫶🎉🎉🧧🧧 #newyear2024 #success #prosperity #hapiness Tech One Philippines 🇵🇭 Tech One Global Ltd\n\nSometimes, it takes an epiphany for us to start taking action. I was 36 when my epiphany hit. For the Chinese, 12 years is a cycle— and I was already on my third. I started wondering how many more cycles I had left. If I hope to retire by 60, that means two more. And just like that, I felt a grappling urgency to create something of my own. So I left my high-paying role as a Principal Consultant I’ve been doing for more than a decade, to start my own company. I had always wanted to start a business— something that would positively impact my two sons and their generations. For me, the answer lies in personal development and culture building. Fortunately, I had 12 years on my belt as a trainer in the youth division when I started my first venture— Youth Inspired. Three years later, I founded my second company, Brydan Group, to start empowering those who have left the safe nest of the education system. Fast forward 15 years, I have teams to back my mission, I’ve trained over 100,000 in The Leadership Challenge and DISC behavioural profiling and even had the privilege to work with industry leaders in Hilton Group, Bank of Singapore, Bank of China, Lazada, Panasonic, Piaggio, SingHealth as well as government agencies like Ministry of Education, Workforce Singapore! 🙏 Sometimes an epiphany comes when your perspective of time changes. 35-year-old Melvin would not have started his own company, but 36-year-old me, who thought time was running out, made it. Now, what keeps me going is the belief that the impact we make in organisations and schools goes way beyond the present. It is all about moulding today’s leaders and setting the stage for a brighter path forward. If you’re thinking: - How do we nurture the next-gen leaders? - How do we build dream teams? - How can we redefine our organization's culture for progressive growth? I would love to connect, chat and share stories! #BrydanGroup #YouthInspired #leadershipdevelopment #employeeengagement\n\n𝙀𝙢𝙗𝙧𝙖𝙘𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙁𝙪𝙡𝙡 𝙎𝙥𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙧𝙪𝙢 𝙤𝙛 𝙂𝙡𝙤𝙗𝙖𝙡 𝘽𝙪𝙨𝙞𝙣𝙚𝙨𝙨 𝘿𝙮𝙣𝙖𝙢𝙞𝙘𝙨 In my journey across the vibrant and diverse landscapes of international business, particularly through my extensive engagement with the Indonesian market over the past two decades, I've uncovered a pivotal lesson that stands at the core of cross-cultural corporate success. It’s a lesson about perspective, inclusion, and the richness of collective insight. Too often, the narrative of business leadership and management is woven tightly around the upper echelons of corporate hierarchies. This narrative, while rich in strategic deliberations, sometimes misses out on the ground-level insights that are crucial for a holistic understanding of the business environment. In Indonesia, a country renowned for its rich cultural collection and communal values, this oversight can lead to a skewed comprehension of the operational landscape, potentially bypassing the intricate challenges and opportunities that lie within. The key to unlocking the true potential of international business operations, I’ve found, lies not within the confines of boardrooms but in the broader conversations that span across all levels of the organization. It is about taking a step back from the conventional managerial circle to engage in a more inclusive dialogue with the workforce. This approach not only aids in identifying unseen pain points but also fosters a culture of trust, respect, and mutual understanding. By integrating into the broader organizational dialogue, businesses can better align with the communal ethos prevalent in many cultures, including Indonesia. It’s a testament to the power of listening, learning, and leveraging the diverse perspectives that make up the fabric of any organization. As we navigate the complexities of the global business arena, let us remember the importance of embracing every layer of insight within our organizations. It's through this comprehensive engagement that we can forge strategies that are not only inclusive but also resonant with the diverse voices that drive our collective success. Here's to broadening our horizons and deepening our understanding of the multifaceted world of international business. Let every voice be heard, and let every perspective shine. #BusinessCulture #GlobalLeadership #CrossCulturalManagement #InclusiveLeadership #BusinessStrategy #InternationalBusiness #Indonesia #ASEAN #BuildingBridges\n\nMany challenges await the expat leader in the Philippines. So what to prioritize? Understanding the local culture, traditions, and social norms is crucial. Show respect for Filipino values, such as \"pakikisama\" (getting along with others) and \"utang na loob\" (debt of gratitude). Adapt communication styles to fit local preferences. Filipinos often use indirect communication to avoid confrontation. Be patient and attentive to non-verbal cues. Create a work environment that values teamwork and camaraderie. Encourage team-building activities and social gatherings. Filipinos appreciate leaders who show genuine concern for their well-being. Be approachable and supportive. Provide opportunities for skill development and career growth. Offer training programs, workshops, and mentorship. Delegate responsibilities and trust your team. Encourage innovation and reward initiative. Define roles, responsibilities, and performance metrics clearly. Regularly review and provide constructive feedback. Acknowledge accomplishments through formal recognition programs, bonuses, or promotions. Celebrate successes together. Adapt business strategies to fit the local market. Consider local preferences, consumer behavior, and regulatory requirements. Be willing to adapt and make changes based on local insights and feedback. Encourage an environment where employees feel comfortable sharing their ideas and perspectives. Just some thoughts. #leadership #philippines #expatleader #beingaleader\n\n🌟 Exciting News for Future Business Leaders in Asia! 🌟 🎓 Access MBA Events are back in action, bringing the world's top business schools right to your doorstep! 🌏 Join us in the vibrant cities of Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Manila, Tokyo, and Seoul for an unparalleled opportunity to shape your future in the business world. 🔹 What to Expect: One-to-One Meetings: Connect directly with representatives from prestigious business schools.

Last week, we were in Jakarta helping a client who wanted us to conduct primary research with focus groups for their innovation team. This is the initial step where we gather information before discussing and addressing the team's gaps and challenges with the stakeholders. Once we confirm the gaps and challenges, we'll begin designing a customized intervention for the team. Confirming the gaps and challenges is crucial to the success for the people development program for the client. Since it's our first meeting with the innovation team, it's crucial to establish psychological safety and trust to ensure the accuracy of the primary research data reflecting their challenges. We carefully planned the flow and delivery of the focus group by understanding the team's functions, their experiences within the company, and gathering preliminary input from reporting managers and HR. The focus group went smoothly, and the client was pleased with the data collected on leadership development gaps, as it mirrored the internal processes and systemic gaps they had identified earlier. Now, we can progressively work on closing the different gaps. Excited for the integrated growth with these leaders soon! #innovation #indonesia #focus #challenges #cassandracoach\n\n🌟 Calling #FemaleEntrepreneurs in #Singapore, this is your golden opportunity! 🚀 Register now for the ‘Transform with Courage Bootcamp’ organized by Class Living! 🌟 https://lnkd.in/gtgZJGGs Imagine breaking free from the chains of procrastination, self-doubt, and fear. 💪 Class Living, a passionate social enterprise, empowers you to focus on self-development, achieve your dreams, and make a positive impact in your sphere of influence.
