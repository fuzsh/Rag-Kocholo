I am pleased to announce and share the release of the Annual Risk Survey Report Edition 2023, a collaborative effort between the Indonesia Risk Management Professional Association (IRMAPA), Indonesia Financial Group Progress (IFG Group), and the Faculty of Economic & Business at the University of Sam Ratulangi in North Sulawesi. As we are all aware, from the beginning of 2023 up until the present time, the world has been grappling with various uncertainties, stemming from macroeconomic factors to geopolitical issues. In today's borderless world, these global and regional uncertainties have the potential to swiftly trigger a multitude of risk issues for businesses in our country. These risks are not confined solely to the financial services sector; they also impact businesses in the real sector. On the other hand, the availability of domestic references or guidelines for risk management professionals in Indonesia regarding the general risk profiles applicable to corporations on a national level is still quite limited. In response to this scenario, the Indonesia Risk Management Professional Association, or IRMAPA, as a cross-sector and cross-industry association of risk management professionals in Indonesia, has taken the initiative to provide a reference concerning the primary risk profiles for corporations in Indonesia. This reference is established through an annual risk management survey conducted with a focus on the corporate landscape within Indonesia. The survey not only highlights the primary risk profiles, including the top 5 risks stemming from geopolitical, macroeconomic, social, natural, and internal company-related issues, but it also presents information about the risk management readiness of various Indonesian companies in proactively addressing these key risks, along with other pertinent insights. The 2023 survey has garnered participation from over 500 respondents representing diverse job roles and companies across Indonesia. Happy Reading! For the better Indonesia. www.starfin.id House of ACT : Advisory - Coaching - Training Strategy - Risk - Finance - Investment - Marketing - Business Incubation #starfin #annualrisksurvey2023 #Indonesiacontext #author\n\nRisk management is no longer a necessity, but has developed into a demand that must be met by every organization, as proof of excellent and resilient performance in dealing with various conditions, even in critical situations. The National Standardization Body (BSN) has established the Indonesian National Standard (SNI) ISO 31000:2011 Risk Management, which identically adopts the international standard ISO 31000:2009. The ISO 31000 standard is part of a series of risk management standards consisting of 4 (four) standards, namely ISO 31000:2009 Risk Management — Principles and Guidelines; ISO Guide 73:2009 Risk Management — Vocabulary; ISO/TR 31004:2013 Risk Management — Guidance for the implementation of ISO 31000 ; and ISO/IEC 31010:2009 Risk Management — Risk Assessment Techniques. The determination of SNI for risk management marks a major step for BSN to make a real contribution to the development of the Indonesian nation and state, especially in maintaining national competitiveness at the regional and global levels. BSN's big step has been initiated with the establishment of the Risk Management 03-10 Technical Committee, which will focus on the preparation of SNI that adopts the international publication standard ISO/TC 262 Risk management. This has also been followed by the formation of the National Mirror Committee (NMC) ISO/TC 262, as a forum for strengthening Indonesia's participation in the development of international standards, so that Indonesia is not only a \"standard taker\" but can also participate in the development of international standards as a drafter. Thanks to BSN for the opportunity and trust given to me as a GRC professional, in order to contribute to the development of the GRC standard, since my appointment at 2015. Will continue to perform my best for the enhancement of GRC awareness and implementation in Indonesia. www.starfin.id House of ACT: Advisory – Coaching – Training Strategy – Risk – Finance – Investment – Marketing - Business Incubation #STARFIN #strategy #risk #finance #investment #businessincubation #qualitymanagement #compliance #projectmanagement #training #advisory #coaching #businesscontinuitymanagement #consulting #enterprise #strategyandrisk #ISO31010 #ISO31000 #sustainability #riskculture #riskprofessional #GCG #GRC #BSN\n\nJoin us at the #EPC Risk Management India Summit 2023 happening on 19th December 2023 at Bombay Exhibition Centre, NESCO.
