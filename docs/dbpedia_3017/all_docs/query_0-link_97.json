Since I first became interested in Southeast Asia some two decades ago, I have tried to bring these two perspectives together in an attempt to arrive at a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of the region’s political dynamics. This book is the result of recent research on this nexus of global, regional, and national developments that have reshaped the political landscape in Southeast Asia. Such a project would not have been possible without personal and institutional encouragement and support—particularly from Mark Williams and everyone in the Department of East Asian Studies, University of Leeds, with its very conducive research environment. The main funding for my research was made available by two grants on foreign policy making and nontraditional security in Southeast Asia from the British Academy’s Southeast Asia Committee. I would like to express my gratitude to the committee and its chairman, Jonathan Rigg, for this generous support. I also greatly benefited from a British Academy joint activities grant (for research on cooperation in the Greater Mekong Subregion) and three British Council higher education link programs: with Mahasarakham University and Prince of Songkla University in Thailand, and with Parahyangan Catholic University in Indonesia. My sincere thanks go to Duncan McCargo, the link coordinator on the Leeds side, for involving me in these most rewarding activities. Furthermore, I am grateful to Norbert Eschborn and Colin Dürkop of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, in Jakarta and Singapore respectively, and to Norbert von Hofmann of the Friedrich Ebert\n\nix\n\n00_FM.qxd\n\n8/24/06\n\nx\n\n12:54 PM\n\nPage x\n\nPreface\n\nFoundation, in Singapore, who repeatedly invited me to present my research findings at workshops and conferences in the region. Overall, the conclusions of this book are based on eleven trips to Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Singapore, and Malaysia between 2001 and 2005, and also draw on earlier stays in the region. Various drafts of individual chapters were presented at the 2002 International Studies Association convention in New Orleans, the 2003 British International Studies Association conference in Birmingham, the 2004 European Association of Southeast Asian Studies conference in Paris, the 2005 Association of Asian Studies convention in Chicago, and the 2005 Thai Studies conference in DeKalb, Illinois, as well as at numerous universities and think tanks in Asia, Europe, and the United States. I gratefully acknowledge the funding I received from the University of Leeds and the British Academy for conference travel on various occasions. Substantial parts of the manuscript were completed during visiting fellowships at Ohio University and the East-West Center in Honolulu. I am thankful to Mike Malley, Karla Schneider, and Drew McDaniel at Ohio University, and Sheila Smith, Nancy Davis Lewis, and Eugene Alexander at the East-West Center, for having made these stays possible, and for their tremendous help and assistance during my fellowships. In addition to two anonymous reviewers whose detailed feedback greatly helped me to improve my arguments, Manfred Mols (in his usual very constructive way) and David Boyd read and commented on the entire manuscript, and Michael Connors and Bob Hadiwinata took a critical look at earlier drafts of individual chapters. Their input was essential to the completion of this project. I would also like to thank Oliver Hensengerth, who kindly let me draw on our jointly authored journal article “SubRegional Cooperation in Southeast Asia: The Mekong Basin,” European Journal of East Asian Studies 4:2 (2005), pp. 263–285, for Chapter 4. Further thanks go to Michael Nelson, Srisompob Jitpiromsri, Wattana Sugunnasil, Nyoman Sudira, Aleksius Jemadu, Uwe Solinger, Heda Bayron, and Aurel Croissant, among many friends and colleagues who shared with me their insights into various aspects of Southeast Asian politics. Not least, I am obliged to Elisabetta Linton, Lynne Rienner’s UK commissioning editor, for her encouraging assistance, professional guidance, and patience from the start of this project. I take full responsibility for the views put forward and for any errors that may be present in the book. The necessity—or should I say luxury—of having to spend extended periods of time in distant (but arguably very pleasant) places, only to retreat to the self-isolation of one’s study afterward, often requires the involvement of entire family networks to make a book happen.

I am also very thankful to Herta Minne and the late Walter Minne for their support over the years. As always, the people I am most indebted to are my wife, Ana-Lucía, and our children, Nils-Mateo and Amelie, for their love, support, and understanding.\n\n00_FM.qxd\n\n8/24/06\n\n12:54 PM\n\nPage xii\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:35 PM\n\nPage 1\n\n1 Global, Regional, and National Dynamics in Southeast Asian Politics\n\nWHEN THE ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS (ASEAN)\n\ncame into being on 8 August 1967, the actual birth was a quick affair. After some brief deliberation in the private residence of Thai foreign minister Thanat Khoman, he and his four counterparts signed the Bangkok Declaration, which they followed with a round of golf.1 As unspectacular as this kind of high-level meeting among politicians seems to be at first glance, the founding of a regional organization among small and medium-size states in Asia without the involvement of a hegemonic power was as unprecedented as it was pathbreaking. If one discounts the earlier ill-fated attempt by the Philippines, Thailand, and the Federation of Malaya to form the Association of Southeast Asia (ASA), this was the first time that any of the newly independent Asian states came together in a joint effort to weather the challenges of the international environment and to create a peaceful and stable regional framework for development. At least during its first thirty years of existence, ASEAN stood for the most successful regional cooperation scheme outside Europe, second only to the European Union (EU), and became the model for regionalism in many other parts of the world. ASEAN was the brainchild of an elite group of policymakers who responded to a clear and straightforward international structure. The association came into being as a child of the Cold War, which had just reached a new peak as the result of the Vietnam War. Although never officially stated, ASEAN’s founders saw intensified regional cooperation as a means of strengthening Southeast Asia’s position in the Asia Pacific area and thereby reducing its risk of becoming a victim of great power global rivalry. Over the following three decades the association successfully institutionalized a network of regular meetings among 1\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n2\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:35 PM\n\nPage 2\n\nThe Changing Dynamics of Southeast Asian Politics\n\nthe member states that enabled the governments of Southeast Asia to liaise on problems or challenges the region faced. ASEAN gained a reputation for having orchestrated Vietnam’s withdrawal from Cambodia and the subsequent Paris Peace Accords of 1991, which ended the Indochina conflict. One of the most remarkable successes of ASEAN has been the ability of its member states to (seemingly) harmonize their foreign policies and often speak with one voice in international affairs. This in turn allowed ASEAN to establish formal relations with the leading regional and global powers, such as the United States, the European Union, China, and Japan. Most decisively, ASEAN seemed to fit Karl W. Deutsch’s model of a pluralistic security community (Deutsch et al. 1957), in which the use of military force as a means of problem solving in relations among members has become highly unlikely (Acharya 2001; Dosch 1995). ASEAN worked well for many years because of the relatively low complexity involved in the political process. From an analytical point of view, the international structure of the Cold War in general and anticommunism in particular were the independent variables, and regional cooperation was the dependent variable. Intervening variables hardly existed, because the political process of managing regional cooperation comprised tiny groups of politicians and government officials who— due to the autocratic or at best semidemocratic environment of the polities in which they maneuvered—were able to follow and implement narrowly defined national interests unconstrained and unchallenged by competing political actors, civil society groups, or critical media. Simultaneously, the policy agendas tended to remain constant and were hierarchically structured: horizontally, foreign policy was separated from domestic politics; vertically, security enjoyed highest priority within the realm of foreign relations, understood as “hard” security, or the management of threat to the integrity of the nation. The political process in Southeast Asia did not seem to resemble what Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye famously labeled “complex interdependence.” Although military force was not used by ASEAN governments toward other member states (the absence of military force within a region is the third element of complex interdependence), this was due neither to the existence of multiple formal and informal channels and networks connecting governments and elites as well as nongovernmental actors and transnational organizations (the first feature of complex interdependence), nor to an adequate, multilevel coordination of holistic policy agendas characterized by fluid boundaries between domestic and foreign issues (the second element) (Keohane and Nye 1977, pp. 24–25). For example, although separatist movements have existed for many decades in places such as southern Thailand, Mindanao, and Aceh, until very recently few would have acknowledged any foreign policy ramifications of local violence.2\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:35 PM\n\nPage 3\n\nGlobal, Regional, and National Dynamics\n\n3\n\nIn the predominantly nondemocratic setting of Southeast Asian politics, peace and stability prevailed not despite but because of, first, the relative insulation of policymaking and, second, well-defined international structures that required little policy adaptation over many years. These were the two pillars of quick and overall effective intraelite policy coordination and conflict management. It can be concluded that during its first three decades, ASEAN largely remained a network-facilitating framework for government elites. Throughout the Cold War and in some instances well into the 1990s, the political process at both national and regional levels in Southeast Asia could be described as static, highly centralized, and one-dimensional. “Static” refers to the largely constant nature of the policy agenda over time, “highly centralized” describes the fact that policymaking was the domain of a small number of elite actors, and “one-dimensional” implies the absence of major linkages between policy areas. Due to the manifold structural changes in the post–Cold War era and political change at domestic levels, the political process has moved in the direction of a pluralist, less centralistic (though not necessarily decentralized), and multidimensional model that is characterized by a growing number of political actors, increasing tendencies toward dispersed decisionmaking, and an intertwinedness of global, regional, and national dynamics never seen before in Southeast Asian politics. According to Anthony McGrew, this change is threefold and can be described as a stretching, deepening, and broadening of political activity. “Stretching” refers to the fact that decisions and actions in one part of the world can come to have worldwide ramifications, “deepening” means that developments at even the most local level can have global implications and vice versa, and “broadening” refers to the growing array of issues that surface on the political agenda, combined with the enormously diverse range of actors involved in political decisionmaking processes at all levels, from the local to the global. This three-dimensional process “transcends the traditional distinction between the international and the domestic study of politics, as well as the statist and institutionalist biases in traditional conceptions of the political” (McGrew 1992, p. 3). Globalization—in the broadest meaning of the concept—is the most obvious and broadest structure, and is probably the first that comes to mind in explaining why the distinction between domestic and foreign issues in Southeast Asia has increasingly become blurred. Recent travelers to Indochina will know the story. As soon as the thirsty visitor sets foot in a bar or pub in Hanoi or Phnom Penh, he or she is immediately approached by a girl dressed in the brownish colors of Tiger Beer and another one wearing a green and white Carlsberg dress. The obvious mission of the “beer girls” is to promote the respective brands of\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n4\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:35 PM\n\nPage 4\n\nThe Changing Dynamics of Southeast Asian Politics\n\nlager in a very polite but persistent way. Sometimes a third girl representing Bell’s Whiskey enters the scene. Multinational companies are fighting for their share of the booming Southeast Asian markets. Beer gardens appear beside Christmas markets in Bangkok and elsewhere in the region. According to the popular cliché, McDonalds, Starbucks, MTV, and Hollywood are the faces of globalization or indeed Americanization. The Asian crisis of 1997 fostered this image. Donald Emmerson asks, tongue-incheek, “With Asian values out of the way, what was left but the goodness and power of the capitalist and democratic virtues undergirding American success?” (1998, p. 48). Globalization seems to have turned Western ways of life into a global model (Prasert 1996, p. 3; Logan 2002, p. xv). This, of course, is a simplifying metaphor, but a very powerful one that, at first glance, seems not far from reality. Is it appropriate to assume that the processes of globalization have reshaped Southeast Asia and above all left a big footprint on politics in the region? To start, there is no academic consensus on the origins of the process that we today call “globalization.” Roland Robertson (1992), one of the pioneers in the study of this phenomenon, differentiates between five phases of globalization, with the earliest being the so-called germinal stage. This represents the beginnings of modernity, which Robertson places in the period 1400–1750. For David Harvey (1996), the origins of globalization are closely associated with the Renaissance, because of the great discoveries and voyages that took place during this period and radically extended the ideas of space. Most important for Harvey is the arrival of the mechanical clock, which, he argues, “annihilates” space because it constructs time as linear and universal. For the first time, so the argument goes, people all across the globe had the potential to synchronize their watches. In this sense the idea of time is central to the idea of modernity itself. Anthony Giddens (1999b) explains globalization as a continuation of developments that have their roots in early-eighteenth-century Europe, where modernization replaced the older traditional forms of societies based on agriculture. If we accept that globalization is not just a recent phenomenon, Southeast Asia’s first taste of large-scale global developments dates back to the nineteenth century and is related to, first, the region’s exposure to European imperialism and Southeast Asia’s integration within the colonial structure of international trade and, second, the gradual emergence of universal patterns of political power and governance. In the latter sense, “‘monarchy’ became a semi-standardized model. . . . [Thai King] Rama V sent his sons and nephews to the courts of St. Petersburg, London and Berlin to learn the intricacies of the world-model” (Anderson 1991, p. 21).3 Later on, in the first half of the twentieth century, nationalism, whose idea and ideology\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:35 PM\n\nPage 5\n\nGlobal, Regional, and National Dynamics\n\n5\n\nhad originated in Europe, became a powerful global force and formed the basis for resistance and independence movements in most parts of Southeast Asia, with the notable exception of Thailand, which had never been colonized. Although the phenomenon stretches back centuries, globalization as an academic concept began to receive recognition only in the early 1980s (Robertson 1992). Today it is closely associated with the post–Cold War international order. The “global village,” a term coined by Marshall McLuhan as early as 1969 (McLuhan 1969, p. 302), or the “borderless world,” a catchphrase for globalization in Thai public debates (Reynolds 2001, p. 253) and many other places, best describe the essence of the concept. While a commonly agreed definition of globalization does not exist, the lowest common denominator in the debate seems to be the minimalist view, according to which “globalization is an increase in interconnections, an acceleration of global flows, or greater interdependence” (Mittleman 2001, p. 213). Or, according to Giddens’s more detailed definition: Globalisation is the intensification of world-wide social relationships which link distant localities in such a way that local happenings are shaped by distant events and, in turn, distant events are shaped by local happenings. It is a process which has led to the reduction of geographical, spatial, and temporal factors as constraints to the development of society. It has resulted in an increased perception of the world as a whole, and a readjustment of societal thought and action away from national, and towards international and global spheres. (1999a)\n\nA main focus of the discourse has been the nexus of globalization and the sovereignty of the state, centered on the argument that the manifold and simultaneous processes of globalization were undermining the foundations of national sovereignty and reducing the capacity of policymakers to act autonomously or effectively within national jurisdictions (Beeson 2003, p. 357). According to a popular standpoint, which is often echoed by civil society organizations, the erosion of national sovereignty is mainly the result of the influence of global interactions among transnational actors, such as big private corporations and economic and financial players. Their interests and actions are believed to have narrowed the ability of governments and people to choose economic, social, and cultural policies (Khor 2000, pp. 4–5). It is of course equally possible to reverse the argument and see the very same phenomenon of diminishing state sovereignty in a predominantly positive light. In his often-cited book End of the Nation State, Kenichi Ohmae (1995, p. 21) proposes that economic activity in the era of globalization was\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n6\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:35 PM\n\nPage 6\n\nThe Changing Dynamics of Southeast Asian Politics\n\nno longer structured—and, most importantly, no longer restricted—by the political boundaries of the traditional Westphalian state, but instead followed information-driven efforts regardless of national borders and discrete cultural areas. The benefits of this presumably borderless world for Southeast Asian actors seemed obvious. The liberalization of financial markets gave firms unprecedented and easy access to sources of capital and opened the door to a fairytale land of quasi-unlimited trade and investment flows. One could even go a step further by arguing that Asian actors were among the movers and shakers of globalization rather than their objects. A little more than a decade ago the Asian developmental state and, linked to it, governance models and work ethics based on a crude understanding of political Confucianism, conveniently constructed by the region’s authoritarian elites to legitimize autocratic or pseudodemocratic rule, almost emerged as the gold standard for the efficient management of opportunities and challenges in the dawning, globalized twenty-first century. Nowhere else did the three main pillars of globalization in the mainstream understanding of the concept—economic integration, domestic economic deregulation, and rapid advances in technology—manifest themselves more clearly than in the post–World War II economic history of Northeast and Southeast Asia (Coclanis and Doshi 2000, p. 61). When the Asian crisis of 1997–1998 shattered the dream of globalization as a never-ending profit-generating phenomenon and forced the region into an economic downturn that also had far-reaching political, social, and ecological ramifications, the self-perception of Southeast Asia quickly changed, from being the champion of globalization to being the first “victim” of the borderless, information-driven world. To many, the Asian crisis, often dubbed the first crisis of globalization, demonstrated in great clarity the link between national and regional corporate activities, and global economic organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). According to a widespread Indonesian view, for example, globalization implies the loss of state sovereignty and economic domination by foreigners (Murphy 2000, p. 210). This way of thinking was reflected by Indonesian national planning minister Kwik Kian Gie’s outburst that the IMF wanted to “choke and ruin” Indonesia economically (quoted in Antara, 20 September 2003). In a similar extreme way, former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad identified globalization, perceived as an idea “coined by the rich countries” (Mahathir 2002, pp. 13–14) and a great Western conspiracy, as the cause “for undercutting the benefits of the Malay community” (quoted in Welsh 2000, p. 243). Seen from this angle it was only logical to blame the Asian crisis on the predatory integration of the world economy, the resulting large capital flows that overwhelmed the region’s financial system, and particularly the\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:35 PM\n\nPage 7\n\nGlobal, Regional, and National Dynamics\n\n7\n\nmalicious work of currency manipulators and speculators (Dato’ Mustapa 2000, p. 5). Even those who do not subscribe to the idea of the IMF’s sole responsibility for Malaysia’s or indeed Southeast Asia’s economic misery of the late 1990s, would probably agree that the Asian crisis has had a fundamental impact on the perception of globalization. One “psychocultural impact” of the 1997 economic debacle on the region’s middle classes “was the transformation of their collective imaginings of ‘globalization’ from rosy to thorny” (Tejapira 2002, p. 331). However, it would be too narrow a perspective to reduce the Southeast Asian manifestation of globalization simply to the emergence and the destruction of “miracle economies.” Some Southeast Asian countries have witnessed a lively discourse on the various meanings and implications of globalization (Mols 2004c)—perhaps most prominently in Thailand, where the term lokanuwat became a buzzword, a neologism coined at the end of the 1980s meaning “turning with the world” (Kim 2000, p. 19). In Thailand, globalization has been the subject of an intense debate between “globalizers,” “nationalists,” and “localists,” and is associated with the undermining of Thai cultural standards and values, but also with the constructive search for an alternative development path that draws equally on local wisdom and the structural realities of the international system (McCargo 2001, p. 103; Hamilton-Hart 2000; Hewison 2002, p. 152). In other countries, however, the debate is still in its very early stages or has not even begun. In Vietnam, until the mid-1990s, the term “globalization” was largely avoided in public discourses, and official documents, including those of the Vietnamese Communist Party as well as academic journals, were referring to “internationalization” instead. This has changed in recent years, as Vietnamese academics have begun to publish widely and explicitly on globalization. Furthermore, the concept is no longer a political taboo (Binh 2001, pp. 3–4), although the definition of the phenomenon is mostly limited to developmental aspects and the “strong state–weak state” dichotomy. For example, in a keynote address to the sixth ASEAN summit in Hanoi in December 1998, Vietnam’s Prime Minister Phan Van Khai made these statements: Developing countries, including ours, are faced with intertwined opportunities and challenges. Great achievements in science and technology have created boundless opportunities and challenges for mankind, but at the same time challenged developing countries with the danger of lagging further behind industrialized and developed countries. Rapid economic globalization is bringing about greater market access and new partners for development, but also putting the weaker economies in a more vulnerable disadvantageous position, and in an uneven competition. (quoted in Binh 2001, p. 4)\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n8\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:35 PM\n\nPage 8\n\nThe Changing Dynamics of Southeast Asian Politics\n\nThe beginning of Vietnam’s new openness to the debate on globalization coincided with the country’s achievement of quintupling its international relationships in the first half of the 1990s. In 1995, Vietnam scored a triple diplomatic success by joining ASEAN, establishing official relations with the United States, and signing a framework cooperation agreement with the EU. At the same time, for other nations in the region, any discourse on globalization is still unknown territory. Government officials in Burma seem to ignore the phenomenon of globalization, which they consider to be associated with the old regime of Westernization. No Burmese word is used or translated for “globalization” (Suvajee 1998, pp. 328–329). In a similar vein, in Laos, the word “global” has neither been properly translated nor is it widely used by the media or the public. “Globalization” as a term seems to be known only to the elites in Vientiane, to high-ranking government officials, to businesspeople, and to some intellectuals, and in most instances the meanings and translations of the term are adopted directly from Thailand through the Thai media (Suvajee 1998, pp. 74–75). Globalization does not mean only a freer flow of goods, services, and technology. The phenomenon also includes the global diffusion of culture and values, social, political, and economic concepts, consumer patterns, aesthetic tastes, fashion trends, lifestyles, and so forth. Like elsewhere in the world, social structures as well as political and economic institutions are exposed to these processes and are rapidly changing in response to them. Globalization can be seen as the trigger for the universal spread of “technological consumerist mass societies” as the defining criterion of an emerging “planetary civilization” (Mols 2004a) and is, according to some, the main factor behind the democratization of authoritarian polities. The expansion of democracy around the globe began with the demise of dictatorship in Portugal, Spain, and Greece in the mid-1970s. This process has been most prominently described as the “third wave of democratization” (Huntington 1991). It has extensively reshaped the modern world. After reaching Latin America, the “wave” crossed the Pacific, reaching the shores of Asia: the so-called People’s Power Revolution of 1986 in the Philippines was followed shortly after by democratic transitions in South Korea and Taiwan. Thailand and Indonesia have been undergoing (re)democratization processes since 1991 and 1998 respectively. According to Freedom House, a nongovernmental organization (NGO), less than 30 percent of the world’s countries were democratic in 1974. The “Freedom in the World” survey showed that, in 2004, eighty-eight countries were consolidated democracies, representing 44 percent of the world’s population. Fifty-five countries were considered “partly free,” representing 21 percent. Political rights and civil liberties are more limited in these countries, in\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:35 PM\n\nPage 9\n\nGlobal, Regional, and National Dynamics\n\n9\n\nwhich corruption, dominant ruling parties, and in some cases ethnic or religious strife are often the norm (Freedom House 2004). Although it is questionable whether democracies can be clearly and easily identified and enumerated, democratization is nonetheless a significant phenomenon that cannot be ignored as a decisive factor in the post–Cold War era. Most studies on the impact of globalization and democratization explain the latter (dependent variable) as a local response to the challenges of the former (independent variable). Kim Kihwan views democratization as the immediate consequence of globalization: “Globalization will lead to greater democratization. . . . With easier and greater access to information, constituents will want to participate more actively in the decision-making process. The upshot will be not only more democratic decision making in all organizations but also a change in the nature of democracy itself, from a representative to a participatory one” (2001, p. 26). Discussing the case of Thailand, Neil Engelhart argues that economic globalization directly contributed to democratization in the 1990s by impinging on politics “in a way that advantaged those who already advocated greater democratization” (2003, p. 254). He asserts that economic hardship in the wake of the 1997 crisis made core actors afraid of undemocratic intervention in politics, particularly military pressure on the elected government, the appointment of an unelected prime minister, or in extreme cases a coup d’etat, and subsequently motivated them to press even harder for the consolidation of democracy (p. 266). Without establishing a clear causal link between the processes of globalization and democratization, Anders Uhlin, in reviewing the cases of Thailand and Malaysia, nevertheless concludes that “globalization opens a new space for political contestation” (2002, pp. 162–163). In Indonesia, the economic crisis of 1997–1998 may not have caused but triggered the downfall of President Suharto and accelerated the process toward democratic reform. In their discussion of the reform process in Vietnam, Claudia Derichs and Thomas Heberer emphasize that the Asian financial crisis discredited authoritarian political concepts and thereby opened the door for gradual, albeit very cautious first steps toward political liberalization under the 1998 decree on “the exercise of democracy” (2002, pp. 154–156). In a detailed case study on the impact of globalization on the Malaysian state of Sarawak, Sabihan Osman explains that the local economy’s integration into a more open and free market system with its various implications, such as the expansion of urban areas, road building, impact from development of hydroelectric power, and the resulting displacement and relocation of indigenous peoples to new areas, “has triggered greater awareness among the indigenous peoples of self-empowerment and democratization, which are important forces in capturing globalization” (2000, p. 987). In a more general sense, Jean Grugel\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n10\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:35 PM\n\nPage 10\n\nThe Changing Dynamics of Southeast Asian Politics\n\nstresses that “under conditions of globalization, democracy becomes desirable because it is thought to be the pathway to development and social peace and because it appears as an ordering device conducive to global stability and growth” (2003, p. 261). As readers will recall, in the lively debate on Western versus Asian values in the early 1990s, “democracy” was sometimes used by Asian contributors as a synonym for Western culture in general and therefore rejected as not suitable for their own societies. Some East and Southeast Asian governments had accused the West of trying to impose on them alien concepts derived from post-Renaissance liberal Western traditions. However, the idea that cultural differences make the Western concept of democracy inapplicable to East and Southeast Asia has never been commonly shared. For example, Kim Dae Jung, who has always been one of the major opponents of Lee Kuan Yew and Mahathir Mohamad in the debate, has argued that Asia has always been rich in democratic ideals and institutions. At any rate, the problem of dealing with democracy is the normative character of the concept. In his thoroughly stimulating deconstruction of the “Western democracy” concept, Edward Friedman explains, “While the potential for democracy is universal, its practice is idiosyncratic. Every democracy is sui generis. If a democracy is not indigenized to fit particularities of culture, history and society, a democracy would never flourish” (2002, p. 59). Indeed, democracy is deeply rooted in specific cultural and historical experiences. In the mainstream European view, democratic political rule is prominently associated with the welfare state ideal, whereas in the United States, pluralism of decisionmaking processes and power structures is central. In Latin America, the concept of civil society became a core element of the young democratic order. In East and even more in Southeast Asia, the notion of democracy had long been based on the principle of harmony and consensus building, materialized for example in Indonesia’s so-called Pancasila democracy under the rule of Suharto. Another strand of the debate perceives democratization as a global strategy of the West. According to this argument, rather than being a direct result of globalization, democratization turned into a global discourse in the 1990s when the promotion of democracy became a cornerstone of US and European foreign policies (Grugel 2004, p. 31). The very moment democracy had emerged as the only acceptable game in town after the end of the Cold War, the member states of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) intensified their efforts to propagate and promote the transition to liberal democratic systems on a larger scale than ever before (see, e.g., Whitehead 1996a, 1996b; Rotfeld 2000). At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the vast majority of European, US, and Japan-\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:35 PM\n\nPage 11\n\nGlobal, Regional, and National Dynamics\n\n11\n\nese donor organizations and aid agencies follow a global strategy of fostering processes of democratization and good governance (Kurtenbach and Weiland 2003; Dosch and Kurtenbach 2003). Whatever view one prefers concerning the relationship between democracy and globalization, there seems to be at least widespread agreement that “the shape of democracies in Asia, as elsewhere, bears the powerful imprint of global forces” (Cotton 2003, p. 342; see also Loh Kok Wah and Öjendal, 2005). Larry Diamond even identifies the “globalization of democracy [as] one of the most historic and profound global changes of the past several decades” (2000, p. 413). However, the “globalization of democracy” does not necessarily imply a deterministic relationship between the two phenomena. From an analytical point of view it seems impossible to isolate globalization from other variables such as the internal dynamics of the respective political systems that have become democracies or are currently in a process of consolidation. The perceived implications of globalization on Southeast Asian politics will be mentioned and discussed at various points in the following chapters, but the analytical framework needs to be much broader in order to capture the dynamics of change in national and regional politics. Taking globalization as the core analytical unit and indeed as the independent variable would wrongly suggest that the process of political change is monocausal and one-dimensional. While global events can prominently contribute to structural and behavioral alterations and transformations in domestic contexts, global factors are hardly ever the sole triggers of change, nor is the internationalnational nexus a one-way road where global spheres impact on national and local areas but not vice versa. Hence, rather than adopting a narrow approach of trying to discuss the specific impact of globalization on Southeast Asian politics, I will argue in a much broader sense that structural changes at the international and domestic levels in Southeast Asia are bound in a reciprocal and mutually reinforcing relationship that has increasingly taken the shape of complex interdependence. This complex interdependence is characterized by the multiplication of ties among state actors as well as between state and nonstate actors and the intertwined, nonhierarchical nature of policy areas.\n\nStructure of the Book\n\nAs already hinted, the key proposition of this book is that the political process in Southeast Asia has moved from a static, highly centralized, and one-dimensional setting to a pluralist, less centrist, and multidimensional\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n12\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:35 PM\n\nPage 12\n\nThe Changing Dynamics of Southeast Asian Politics\n\nframework due to a stretching, deepening, and broadening of this process. Of course, this change does not constitute an absolute shift from one ideal model to the next. The progression between the static and pluralist endpoints on a hypothetical policy process scale has been gradual and reached different positions in the case of each individual Southeast Asian polity. For example, over the past few years the policy process in democratizing Indonesia has been subject to more dramatic transitions than has the one in communist Laos. However, to some degree the political process has stretched, deepened, and broadened even in the most reform-resistant state, Burma. No political system in the region is completely immune to structural changes, and this has major implications for both national and regional politics. In the following chapters, I will analyze five cases that give evidence of increasing complex interdependence and reflexive linkages among national, regional, and global dynamics in the policy process. In analytical terms, such an endeavor requires crossing the divide between international relations and comparative politics. Most work on Southeast Asian politics either looks at the region from the international relations perspective, particularly in the case of the myriad publications on ASEAN, or focuses on domestic political change, especially the topic of democratization in Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines. Not many analysts have tried to unite both perspectives. This book tries to narrow the research gap by following a cross-disciplinary approach. Chapter 2 discusses foreign policy making as probably the most visible evidence for a move from a statist to a pluralist setting in the policy process. There is one common experience that all young democracies share regardless of the respective cultural background they are embedded in: the wave of democratization that has washed over the globe for three decades has principally opened international relations and foreign policy making to a larger number of actors compared with authoritarian regimes. The greater openness and complexity of foreign policy making is due to electoral competition, a prominent role played by parliaments, greater transparency, and not least, broad access to independent sources of information. In many cases a stronger participation of nonstate actors, such as NGOs and other organizations of civil society, in foreign policy making is not only a quasiinevitable consequence of democratization but also a development actively supported by governments. The making of foreign policy in Southeast Asia and indeed the region’s international relations have mostly been seen and analyzed as isolated policy areas, unrelated to the structures and dynamics of the countries’ political systems. This approach seemed to be acceptable during the periods of autocratic rule, when the foreign policy arena was the playground of small political elites who were defining and implementing\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:35 PM\n\nPage 13\n\nGlobal, Regional, and National Dynamics\n\n13\n\nnarrow national interests without taking into account broader societal interests or being subjected to institutionalized checks and balances. However, the processes of democratization in the Philippines (since 1986), Thailand (since 1992), and Indonesia (since 1998) have not only resulted in new national political orders but also impacted foreign policy making and, more specifically, changed the way the respective governments perceive global challenges and react to them. Based on an analytical framework that mainly draws on the metaphor of the two-level game in foreign policy decisionmaking as introduced by Robert Putnam (1988) and the statist/pluralist model developed by David Skidmore and Valerie Hudson (1993), Chapter 2 discusses whether formal and informal mechanisms and patterns exist to open the decisionmaking process beyond the special foreign policy interests of small political elites and to make those interests subject to intrasystemic checks and balances; to what extent democratization has resulted in a broadening of actor participation in the formulation and implementation of foreign policy interests and strategies; and whether postauthoritarian political change has resulted in new foreign policy priorities and strategies in the regional context, the global context, or both. It is assumed that the new democratic environment in Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines has opened up the foreign policy arena to a large number of actors, mainly to the benefit of ministries, other government officials, and a civilian diplomatic service, while at the same time reducing the impact of the military on foreign policy. Special emphasis is given to the role of the legislature in foreign policy decisionmaking and to public opinion as a factor in pushing the executive toward the prominent consideration of business, human rights, and religious issues. The nexus of global, regional, and national and local developments and structures is of particular relevance to security. As Chapter 3 shows, the structural changes of the post–Cold War era have resulted in new views on the definition and nature of security. In the early 1990s, economic development and military security became intertwined in a way never before seen. Among the most important contributions to this discourse is the concept of human security, which has emerged as the core of a new and broader understanding of security. According to this new approach, security comprises aspects of so-called soft (nontraditional) security, in addition to the established hard (military) security. The chapter begins with an overview and discussion of some hard security challenges, such as the conflicts in the South China Sea, and an elaboration of the concept of nontraditional security, and then returns to the book’s main argument, the mutually reinforcing relationship between international and national events, structures, and processes, as illustrated in the context of nonstate violence.\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n14\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:35 PM\n\nPage 14\n\nThe Changing Dynamics of Southeast Asian Politics\n\nSince the events of 11 September 2001 and the widespread perception that East and Southeast Asia were destined to become “terrorism’s next battleground” (Kurlantzick 2001, p. 36), discussion of the insurgency hotspots in Southeast Asia under the header of the global “war on terror” has emerged as a popular discourse. Today, violence in Southeast Asia is often seen simply as the local manifestation of the same universal phenomenon, the Al-Qaidaization of international relations. While some radical Islamic groups in Southeast Asia may find it useful to ride the global jihad bandwagon, and while it is not impossible that they have received financial and logistic support from Al-Qaida, I hypothesize that the origins and main agendas of separatism and insurgency tend to have a local or national rather than an international nature. Chapter 3 also highlights a significant feature of the debate on globalization: the normative distinction between presumably “positive” impacts of globalization, such as the global extension of liberal market economies, and “negative” counterreactions, ranging from various manifestations of localism and nationalism to religious fundamentalism and terrorism. I analyze the various facets of violence in southern Thailand, in Mindanao, the Philippines, and in Aceh, Indonesia, and argue that all three conflicts share some crucial similar structural framework conditions: they (1) date back to colonial or even precolonial times and have been affected by the legacy of colonialism; (2) involve ethnic and religious minorities; (3) are legitimated and inspired in religious terms; (4) are confined to the poorest regions within the respective nations; and (5) have been fueled by a long history of neglect from their respective national governments, and marginalized in the nation-building process or even worsened due to failed policy approaches. In a further step, I discuss different approaches—partly mutually exclusive and partly complementary—to conflict management and resolution that have been applied in the three instances, including policy strategies directed to the decentralization and devolution of political power; attempts at the economic development of formerly neglected provinces and regions; the temptation to apply military solutions; and international and regional contributions, mainly the feasibility of US involvement and the role of ASEAN. Chapter 4 focuses on a further example of the fading boundaries between policy areas—in this case, economic development, management of natural resources, and security—and a new nexus between national and international dynamics in policy processes in the context of subregional cooperation in the Mekong valley. This case study is interesting not only because the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) is among the most successful subregional approaches to community building, or what Donald Weatherbee calls “developmental regionalism” (2001, p. 155), but more importantly because\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:35 PM\n\nPage 15\n\nGlobal, Regional, and National Dynamics\n\n15\n\neven the remaining nondemocratic states of Southeast Asia—Vietnam, Laos, and Burma—have undergone changes from static and one-dimensional to pluralist and multidimensional foreign policies, though to varying degrees, due to stretched, deepened, and broadened policy processes. The Mekong river is the world’s twelfth largest waterway, and Southeast Asia’s largest. The GMS covers some 2.3 million square kilometers and a population of about 245 million. Explorers, traders, and more recently politicians have traditionally seen the Mekong valley as a natural geographic region, whose peoples shared not only the resources of this mighty river, but also some distinctive cultural features. However, for many decades the implementation of institutionalized subregional integration was halted by war and conflict in the region. The process only gained momentum in 1992 when, with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the six riparian states of the Mekong river—Burma, Cambodia, China (Yunnan and Guangxi provinces), Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam—entered into a program of formalized subregional cooperation. I discuss the various achievements and shortcomings of cooperation within the GMS, and argue that while the GMS has not yet developed into a pluralistic security community (as first defined by Karl W. Deutsch and colleagues in 1957) that would be characterized by the general absence of military conflict as a possible means of problem solving in intermember relations, the achievements of cooperation in the Mekong area have significantly reduced tension and conflict. The case also shows a growing convergence between national and international policy agendas in Southeast Asia. The implementation of enormous infrastructure projects, mainly funded and driven by the ADB, has resulted in an increasing overlap of local, national, and international political spheres. However, while the ADB has not directly interfered in the domestic affairs of GMS member states, in other cases of Southeast Asian politics, active international intervention has increasingly become a reality. Among the most striking examples for growing linkages between global and local political dynamics is the Cambodian polity. As Chapter 5 outlines, the degree of Cambodia’s exposure to external influence over domestic political structures is second to none in Southeast Asia. The country’s political system has become a playground for the international donor community in its attempt to strengthen good governance. Within this context, the decentralization of governance, or the “shift in decision-making and spending power from central to regional and local governments” (Campbell and Fuhr 2004, p. 11), is the core area of external sponsorship. The chapter takes a critical look at the achievements and shortcomings of decentralization in Cambodia, and discusses the contribution of external actors in particular. Interestingly, “external” in this case means mainly the\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n16\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:35 PM\n\nPage 16\n\nThe Changing Dynamics of Southeast Asian Politics\n\nWest and Japan. The role of regional actors in or vis-à-vis Cambodia is neglectable. This holds particularly true for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which has neither mandate nor authority to involve itself in the political affairs of a member state. Chapter 6 explores ASEAN’s strict adherence to the principle of noninterference, the traditional “ASEAN way” of informal, consensus-driven consultation and the categorical rejection of any legalistic approach to regional cooperation, which has increasingly become a burden in the process of community building. I delve into the transition from a static, highly centralized, and one-dimensional policy process that proved to be a fertile ground for the efficient elite management of regional affairs in Southeast Asia, to a pluralist, less centralist, and multidimensional environment for decisionmaking, and how this transition has affected and shaped regionalism. The chapter examines the various approaches to regional cooperation in Southeast Asia and the wider Asia Pacific area under the impact of blurred divides between domestic and international structures, diminishing boundaries between individual policy areas, and the emergence of new groups of political actors. The cases include the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), the proposed ASEANChina free trade area, the ASEAN Plus Three (APT) forum, the East Asian summit, attempts at monetary cooperation, and finally interregionalism, particularly the relations between ASEAN and the European Union. In Chapter 6 my central interest is not so much the “academic ASEAN,” or the way regionalism in Southeast Asia has served—sometimes in a rather overstretched, theoretical fashion—as a major object of scholarly research and playground for the testing of various international relations paradigms. Rather, I focus on the “practical political ASEAN,” or the manner in which political actors have perceived and developed regional cooperation. From a practical political perspective, ASEAN, which was tailor-made as a network facilitator for small and unaccountable government elites operating in an untransparent policy environment, has struggled to adapt to the new realities of more pluralistic and complex policy processes. ASEAN’s problem is not the absence of a working framework for intergovernmental communication, but the organization’s own claim of being able to effectively and efficiently address regional challenges and to embark on economic and political integration with the given institutional mechanisms. In other words, ASEAN likes to bark on the international stage but has lost its ability to bite. In short, this book neither claims to cover the entire empirically observable spectrum of changing political dynamics in Southeast Asia, nor does it try to establish a one-size-fits-all analytical methodological approach to the presented case studies. What I do attempt is to discuss some core examples of the rapidly growing nexus of global, regional, and national dynamics in\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:35 PM\n\nPage 17\n\nGlobal, Regional, and National Dynamics\n\n17\n\nSoutheast Asian politics, focusing on developments—mainly from a comparative perspective—in Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, ASEAN as a collective actor, and to a somewhat lesser extent Singapore, Malaysia, Laos, and Burma. The regional roles and influence of China, Japan, the United States, and the European Union are also prominently taken into account. While each of the following chapters features its own case-specific framework for analysis, research questions, and propositions from the interdisciplinary toolbox of comparative politics, international relations, and area studies, the various analytical perspectives are (loosely) bound together by the argument that the political process in Southeast Asia has moved from a static, highly centralized, and one-dimensional setting to a pluralist, less centrist, and multidimensional framework (in other words, complex interdependence) as the result of a stretching, deepening, and broadening of political activity.\n\nNotes 1. Thanat Khoman shared his personal recollection of events with me in Bangkok, August 1993. 2. This is not to suggest that Southeast Asian politicians had been completely ignorant of any domestic-international linkages. At least in very general terms, the notion that national resilience and regional resilience were tied in a mutually reinforcing relationship became an important raison d’être for cooperation within ASEAN. However, beyond the political rhetoric, this credo has had few practical implications. 3.

On the structure of foreign policy making: Do formal, institutionalized, and informal mechanisms and patterns exist to open the decisionmaking process beyond the special foreign policy interests of small political elites, and to make those interests subject to intrasystemic checks and balances? 2. On the actors involved in foreign policy making: Has democratization led to the broadening of actor participation in the formulation and implementation of foreign policy interests and strategies? Who are those actors? 3. On the issues in foreign policy making: Has postauthoritarian political change resulted in new foreign policy priorities and strategies in the regional and the global context? The understanding of democracy used here is based on Wolfgang Merkel’s concept of “embedded democracy,” which goes beyond Robert Dahl’s definition of polyarchy (Dahl 1971) and “consists of five partial regimes: a democratic electoral regime, political rights of participation, civil rights, horizontal accountability, and the guarantee that the effective power to govern lies in the hands of democratically elected representatives” 19\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n20\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:36 PM\n\nPage 20\n\nThe Changing Dynamics of Southeast Asian Politics\n\n(Merkel 2004, p. 36). However, I will not discuss the degree of democratic consolidation in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand, but rather analyze how and to what extent democratization—that is, the transition from authoritarian or semiauthoritarian rule to a democratic political system (independent variable)—has changed the structures of, and actors involved in, the process of foreign policy making (dependent variable) in these three polities. The chapter begins by developing an analytical framework based on the existing literature on domestic sources of foreign policy.\n\nDemocracy and Foreign Policy: An Overview of the Debate\n\nIn 1967, British political scientist Peter G. Richards complained about the lack of academic research on the various actors involved in the process of foreign policy making. In his view, the neglect of parliaments and societal forces in most analyses, for example, was partly due to the fact that foreign affairs “tend to be overlaid by other issues” and “are generally considered a matter for the executive branch of government” (1967, p. 13). Two years later in 1969, James N. Rosenau’s pathbreaking edited volume Linkage Politics, on the convergence of national and international systems, was published. In great analytical and empirical depth, Rosenau and the volume’s contributors investigated the reciprocal relationship between external and internal variables in policymaking. This attempt at a “systematic conceptual exploration of the flow of influence across the . . . boundaries of national and international systems” (Rosenau 1969, p. 3) can still be considered the benchmark for crossing the international-domestic divide. Rosenau introduced a matrix featuring no less than 144 areas in which national-international linkages can be formed (p. 49). However, with the notable exception of Ole Holsti’s and John Sullivan’s chapter on France and China, the volume was more concerned with the impact of international inputs on domestic policy outputs than the influence of actors and structures on a given state’s foreign relations. Equally if not more important, Rosenau’s earlier “pre-theory” framework (1966) served as the methodological basis of a series of studies (e.g., Rosenau and Hoggard 1974; Rosenau and Ramsey 1975) that tried to assess the relative importance of domestic and external variables in foreign policy making by juxtaposing the internal factors of size, economic development, and political accountability with the relational attributes of distance, homogeneity, and power. Rosenau and his colleagues came to the general conclusion that internal factors are dominant while the external (e.g., relational)\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:36 PM\n\nMaking Foreign Policy\n\nPage 21\n\n21\n\ncluster contributes much less to the explanation of conflictual and cooperative foreign behaviors (Wilkenfeld et al. 1980, p. 126). At the same time, many influential contributions to the analysis of foreign policy of the 1960s and 1970s (e.g., Wallace 1971; Epstein 1964; Frankel 1963; Waltz 1967; see Geller 1985 for a summary) maintained that in both democratic and authoritarian systems, executive decisionmakers were only marginally constrained, if at all, by competing actors. A significant research gap in the study of the domestic dynamics in foreign policy making continued to exist. Although the domestic-international nexus and the president-versusCongress pattern in US foreign policy making are well documented, other case studies and general theoretical contributions are rather small in number. There are a few notable exceptions though. One of the most influential post1970s contributions to foreign policy analysis has been the metaphor of the two-level game as introduced by Robert Putnam (1988) and developed further by many others since (especially Evans et al. 1993).1 The two-levelgame framework is the “central analytical device . . . to span the domesticinternational divide” (Caporaso 1997, p. 567). It follows the idea that “the relationship of states to the domestic and transnational social context in which they are embedded—have a fundamental impact on state behavior in world politics” (Moravcsik 1997, p. 513). The two-level game links the national and international context of decisionmaking. At the national level, domestic constituencies pressure the government to adopt policies they favor. At the same time governmental actors seek power by building coalitions among these constituencies. At the international level, governmental actors seek to satisfy domestic pressures while limiting the harmful impact on foreign relations. Thus, political leaders must simultaneously play both the international game and the domestic game. The requirement that decisionmakers satisfy both domestic constituencies and international actors is what produces constraints on foreign policy behavior. In sum, while the two-level game emphasizes negotiating behavior, it also serves as a metaphor for understanding the impact of domestic influences on the broad spectrum of foreign policy decisions (Trumbore and Boyer 2000, p. 680). Joe Hagan amends Putnam’s approach by introducing a further analytical layer. He correctly stresses that political leaders “must engage in two, not one, domestic political games involving diverse opposition actors with different goals and interests” (Hagan 1993, p. 4). The first imperative of this dual domestic game is coalition policymaking, or the requirement that agreement is to be achieved among actors who share the authority necessary for committing the resources of a nation to a particular course of action in foreign policy. The necessity for coalition building is rooted in what Vincent Pollard calls “stretched organizational pluralism,” which “generically refers to the extent\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n22\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:36 PM\n\nPage 22\n\nThe Changing Dynamics of Southeast Asian Politics\n\nto which the foreign policy power is shared, willingly or unwillingly, with other individuals and institutions” (1998, p. 5). The second feature of the twofold domestic embeddedness of foreign policy making is retaining political power, or the imperative to maintain and, if possible, enhance the political support base necessary for holding on to political power (Hagan 1993, pp. 4–5). In other words, “Foreign policy decision-makers are not simply agents of the national interest but political animals who must worry about their survival in office and the viability of their overall set of political goals, domestic and foreign” (Skidmore and Hudson 1993, p. 3). The two-level-game approach does not explain the impact of domestic factors on foreign policy making in different regime types. It does not differentiate between democracies and autocracies but explains that regardless the respective political system, no senior governmental actor is completely immune from intrastate pressure. In principle, strong government agencies, insulated groups of technocrats, or rival actors (the military for example) can challenge and influence the foreign policy making of authoritarian leaders as effectively as can societal forces, NGOs, or parliaments in liberal democracies. However, while both authoritarian and democratic leaders generally face a similar pattern of constraints when confronted with decisions about their countries’ external relations, the degree of pressure on decisionmakers seems to vary greatly according to the overall structure in which foreign policy making is embedded. The influence of nongovernmental actors in the foreign policy arena is prominently related to the way in which regime accountability constrains the government’s latitude of decisionmaking in foreign affairs. In an authoritarian state regime, accountability tends to be low because the procedures for power transfer are not institutionalized. The continuity of a regime is not linked to the legislative process, elections, judicial decision, or even the regime’s performance. Hence, accountability does not impose a significant limitation on foreign policy making in authoritarian polities. In contrast, democratization increases regime accountability and, as a result, restricts the regime’s leeway in determining and implementing foreign policy goals (Park, Ko, and Kim 1994, p. 173). In this regard David Skidmore and Valerie Hudson (1993) differentiate between two ideal models, the statist and the pluralist approach, which show that while regime accountability is a crucial variable, the differences between authoritarian and democratic polities can be blurred as far as foreign policy making is concerned.2 The statist model is most likely to be found in a nondemocratic environment, but is not necessarily restricted to a certain regime type. In extreme cases, foreign policy is guided by a national interest that is narrowly defined and, over time, very consistent. Given their almost absolute, insu-\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:36 PM\n\nPage 23\n\nMaking Foreign Policy\n\n23\n\nlated position within the state and its political system, foreign policy decisionmakers can safely ignore societal interests and even opposition. As a result, the conduct of foreign policy is almost free of domestic constraints (Skidmore and Hudson 1993, pp. 7–8). The statist model and its subtypes are more widespread than might appear at first glance. In fact, the belief in the primacy of foreign policy and a commitment to strong government in the management of foreign policy are the very essence of the realist school of thought in international relations. The idea that a potentially hostile international environment and the anarchic struggle for power among nations require insulated policymaking that is not shaped by mass sentiment is as old as the study of international relations itself. The concept goes back to Thucydides’ views on the Peloponnesian war, can be found in the writings of Niccolo Machiavelli, John Jack Rousseau, John Locke, Leopold von Ranke, Friedrich Meinecke, and Alexander de Tocqueville, and represents a core argument of Hans Morgenthau’s work:3 Thinking required for the successful conduct of foreign policy can be diametrically opposed to the rhetoric and action by which the masses and their representatives are likely to be moved. The peculiar qualities of the statesman’s mind are not always likely to find a favourable response in the popular mind. The statesman must think in terms of national interest, conceived as power among other powers. The popular mind, unaware of the fine distinctions of the statesman’s thinking, reasons more often than not in the simple moralistic and legalistic terms of absolute good and absolute evil. The statesman must take the long view, proceeding slowly and by detours, paying with small losses for great advantage; he must be able to temporise, to compromise, to bide his time. The popular mind wants quick results; it will sacrifice tomorrow’s real benefit for today’s apparent advantage. (Morgenthau 1948, p. 168)\n\nIn the antipodal pluralist model, the case of a quasi-unlimited, open, and responsive democratic system, foreign policy choices are inevitably linked to their perceived effect on the decisionmaker’s political standing in his or her constituency. In such an environment the vast majority of foreign policy options go along with societal division and political mobilization either because the material interests of various groups are affected differently—producing both winners and losers—or because foreign policy choices provoke ideological conflict over values and purposes. By that, any given policy choice on an important international issue will stimulate a range of support and opposition. A very good example of the pluralist element in foreign relations is the strong impact of Japanese public opinion and local politics toward the US military presence in Okinawa on the state\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n24\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:36 PM\n\nPage 24\n\nThe Changing Dynamics of Southeast Asian Politics\n\nand future of the US-Japanese security alliance (S. Smith 2000). Overall, the pluralist model “assumes that foreign policy interest groups are large in number, that cross-cutting cleavages exist among them, that coalitions shift easily across issues and over time, and that power is dispersed rather than concentrated. On issues where domestic salience is high, political leaders select policies which attract the support of domestic coalitions. Since coalitions change over time and across issues, policy consistency and coherence are rare” (Skidmore and Hudson 1993, pp. 9–10). From a hard-core realist position, the pluralist model would be inferior to the statist approach because, according to this view, it harms the pursuit of foreign affairs in the quasi-anarchic world of states (see Harriott 1993, p. 220, for a critical discussion of this argument). Walter Lippmann and others have challenged the idealist’s view that peace is in the interest of the people more than in that of the ruling elite and the related hypothesis: “The more responsive foreign policy is to popular influence, the more peaceful it is likely to be.” The realist counterassumption is in essence: “Peace is best served by a foreign policy too sophisticated to be comprehensible to the general public. Popular intervention in foreign policy risks inhibiting that rational adjustment to new situations which is a prerequisite for peace” (paraphrased in Goldmann 1986, pp. 9–10). On the one hand, empirical evidence indeed suggests that even the political elites of consolidated Western democracies successfully applied statist approaches at critical junctures of world politics. The Washington-Beijing rapprochement of the early 1970s, which began with secret meetings between Henry Kissinger and Zhou Enlai, is a prominent example. US president Richard Nixon “gave Kissinger unprecedented control of the foreign policy process and to be an independent operator in foreign policy (i.e., to negotiate secretly with Chinese officials). The back channel allowed them to act decisively in the area and to circumvent bureaucratic and congressional opposition” (Garrison 2002, p. 24). On the other hand, a radical realist position ignores that the recipe of strong government, insulation, and a deliberate lack of transparency as a means of keeping the statesmen’s strategies out of the public domain has often resulted in crisis rather than contributed to an efficient management of international relations. The circumstances that led to the outbreak of World War I are a case in point. Overall it seems safe to assume that in the post–Cold War era the pluralist element in foreign policy making is on the increase, for a combination of two reasons. First, the less clear and straightforward international structures require more complex processes of foreign policy making and the evaluation of a larger set of alternative options than was the case in the (relatively simply structured) bipolar world. Second, as already hinted, the democratization of authoritarian-ruled polities has made the area of foreign\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:36 PM\n\nMaking Foreign Policy\n\nPage 25\n\n25\n\npolicy more accessible for a growing, and often diverse, group of actors. At the same time, democracy per se does not guarantee a significant societal input. Due to the complexity of foreign relations and the fact that, in general, citizens are personally less affected by international than domestic affairs and consequently do not rank foreign policy issues very high, the public still looks for “guardianship”4 in this policy area (Dahl 1985), and responsibilities are likely to be placed in the hands of an expert minority (Kahler 1997, p. 5). The best-researched example in this respect is the United States. In 1992, at a time of massive structural changes in the international system, only 9 percent of the American electorate cited foreign affairs as the most important or second most important policy area that had had an impact on their vote in that year’s presidential elections (see Lieber 1997, p. 11). Despite the proliferation of new technologies and information sources, most Americans seem to be poorly informed about most aspects of international affairs (Holsti 1996, p. 215). Then again, foreign policy making in the United States is not at all monopolized by the president or small groups of experts within the administration. The core principle of checks and balances, or intermixture of power, in the US Constitution provides for a prominent involvement of Congress in foreign policy making and thereby, as an indirect result, opens the process to the interests of numerous lobbies, pressure groups, and NGOs that are informally linked to actors within or close to the legislature. In general terms, state autonomy in policymaking consists of two categories: autonomy from social elites and autonomy from the masses.5 While authoritarian regimes are normally characterized by a strong state autonomy from popular influence and a weak autonomy from elite influence, especially that of military and business actors, democratization changes this relationship by increasing state autonomy from social elites and reducing state autonomy from the public. The latter phenomenon is related to the rapid emergence of civil society actors, such as labor unions, political parties, interest and pressure groups, and the mass media. However, as Tong Whan Park, Dae-Won Ko, and Kyu-Ryoon Kim (1994) demonstrate in the cases of South Korea and Taiwan, despite the mainstream proposition that increased state autonomy from social elites and the simultaneous expansion of societal input in the political arena generally boost a nation’s overall policy performance, the impact on foreign policy capacity is not as clear-cut. Hence the interesting questions: • Which groups of actors and how many of them are actively trying to put their mark on foreign affairs in a democratizing political system?\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n26\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:36 PM\n\nPage 26\n\nThe Changing Dynamics of Southeast Asian Politics\n\n• And, once the actors have been identified: How effectively are they shaping the process of foreign policy making and influencing their respective governments, assuming that the executive is the lead actor in the vast majority of, if not nearly all, existing political systems, regardless of the specific regime type? In order to address these points, the fact that relations between the executive and other actors, such as the legislature, political parties, or NGOs, can follow formal and informal patterns must be taken into account. Although the outcomes can be similar, the process is different and depends on whether the two-level game is embedded in formal regime structures (such as constitutional provisions) or driven by informal mechanisms of control and veto. The political system of Canada provides a striking example in this respect. The Canadian parliament possesses no formal, legislative authority over the shaping of foreign policy, which is the exclusive domain of the prime minister and a very small number of governmental agencies, including the Privy Council and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. At the same time, however, the parliament has significantly affected foreign policy making on the basis of nonlegislative, informal means and procedures—for example, committee hearings, interparliamentary groups, study tours abroad, or individual efforts by members of parliament (McCormick 2002). The formal-informal nexus is of particular importance for the analysis of foreign policy making in new democracies or—depending on the terminology and perception one prefers—in transitional regimes where a certain degree of formal institutionalization (a new constitution, for example) or the stability of the newly created democratic institutions might not have been achieved yet. While “even the modest degree of political liberalization may influence foreign policy” (Kahler 1997, p. 12),6 initial changes of foreign policy interests, priorities, and strategies of postauthoritarian regimes are more likely to result from the new open environment for policymaking than from the set of formal institutions-in-the-making. In a newly democratized polity, the domestic institutional framework for foreign policy making seems to become “more concerned with ‘open,’ and often ethical-moral . . . aspects. Actors such as political parties, interests groups and the mass media, are, therefore, increasing in influence compared with the more ‘closed’ specialist and bureaucratic-process features [of a nondemocratic regime]” (Sanford 1999, p. 769). These actors gain additional importance due to their potential ability to influence or, in the case of the mass media, shape public opinion, which can be a powerful tool in the foreign policy process. Even in the 1960s, the impact of the British media on London’s\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:36 PM\n\nMaking Foreign Policy\n\nPage 27\n\n27\n\nforeign policy, for example, was probably more decisive than the foreign policy role played by the parliament (Richards 1967, p. 174). The media’s power has increased ever since, and any decision on whether or not the UK will adopt the euro is likely to be heavily influenced by the battle for public opinion fought out in the newspapers, particularly the tabloids. In the case of Canada, to give a second example, “the growth of media outlets as sounding boards of public opinion has in part drowned out the parliamentary and caucus debate that Question Period or other parliamentary exchanges might have provided the government in the past” (McCormick 2002, p. 25). Thomas Risse-Kappen (1991, p. 510) concludes, on the basis of analyzing foreign policy making in the United States, France, Germany, and Japan, that politicians in democratic polities do not decide against an overwhelming public consensus. Mass public opinion sets broad and unspecific limits to the foreign policy choices. One might even agree with Farrell, who suggested that foreign policies are often primarily designed for domestic ends: “it is not unknown for senior political decision-makers seeking reelection to high office to espouse foreign policy positions with an eye to the ballot box rather than in accordance with their considered judgments” (1966, p. 184). Despite the growing role of the media and NGOs, parliaments often emerge as one of the most influential foreign policy actors, particularly in transitional regimes. Although the formal institutional setting may not provide for extensive decisionmaking power over foreign policy issues other than the ratification of international treaties (which is the case in most countries, though Canada, for example, is an exception), parliaments nevertheless often actively pursue foreign policy interests. In fact, as Lisa Martin assumes, “it appears that legislatures are most insistent on asserting their right to influence foreign policy early in the process of liberalization. Because this process is about establishing property rights to policymaking, legislators are reluctant to concede in the institutional power struggle by allowing the executive much discretion. In contrast, in established democracies we typically see extensive delegation (but rarely abdication) to the executive branch” (1997, pp. 68–69). She gives seventeenthcentury England, and postcommunist Russia, as examples. The prominent involvement of parliaments and, consequently, political parties in foreign policy making can even start well before the institutionalization of a democratic system. Hungary is a case in point. The principal foreign policy aims and strategies of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, which won national elections in 1990, were formulated previously to the national elections. Following their legalization, the opposition groups and parties, including the forum, more and more put their mark on the government’s for-\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n28\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:36 PM\n\nPage 28\n\nThe Changing Dynamics of Southeast Asian Politics\n\neign and domestic policies, even if only indirectly. In the twilight period of the communist government after May 1989, all major foreign policy moves, including decisions involving the Warsaw Pact, were discussed with the opposition. The forum, then the largest of the opposition parties, even sent representatives to the United States and other countries to discuss with policymakers Hungary’s prospects under a democratic regime (Kun 1993, p. 60). Furthermore, as the case of most postauthoritarian political systems in Eastern Europe has demonstrated, unlike members of the legislature in consolidated democracies, parliamentarians in many newly democratized states cling to the ideal of grassroots democracy and therefore maintain close relations with actors from civil society. This increases the potential impact of NGOs on policymaking. NGOs are not in themselves democratic organizations, but they often represent democratic values and have the ability to mobilize public support for their causes. As a report by the East West Institute points out, “NGOs in Eastern Europe have been especially successful in promoting specific issues, such as human rights, which challenge the international system based on the rights of sovereignty and non-intervention” and thereby confront traditional realist concepts of foreign policy as pursued by the old authoritarian political elites (EWI Strategy Group 1998, pp. 6–7). The new postauthoritarian governments can no longer afford to focus solely on security and survival. No longer is foreign policy “a separate and special area of government linked to the security and the fundamental values of the state” (Wallace and Patterson 1978, p. 3). As Vincent Pollard shows in the particular case of the Philippines, but also regarding Asia in general, nonstate actors with political commitment, expert knowledge, media savvy, and organizational agility have been able to put their mark on foreign policy making. Simultaneously, governments have learned to channel the interests and activities of NGOs toward attainment of objectives sought by presidents and foreign ministers (2004, p. 155). The wider framework of the two-level game in a democracy also increases the potential for academic policy consultation and the influence of think tanks. In the United States, more than a thousand private, nonprofit think tanks try to contribute their expertise to the governmental decisionmaking process. The more the influence of think tanks and academics in the foreign policy process grows, the more they are integrated in epistemic communities, or so-called track-two activities, that bring them together with government officials who often attend these kind of meetings in their private capacity. Joseph Nye illustrates the way academic-governmental networks work: A couple of books [such as on Japan, in the aftermath of the Gulf War, etc.] were undertaken when I was directing a group we called the Aspen\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:36 PM\n\nPage 29\n\nMaking Foreign Policy\n\n29\n\nstrategy group, which has about thirty members including academics and former government officials, plus people from the Congress. The Aspen Strategy Group included Brent Scowcoft, Les Aspin, Bill Perry, Jim Woolsey, John Deutch—these were people who wound up in government positions but who spent the time before that talking to each other, thinking through some of these problems. So the ideas that were in the books were also put directly into the minds of people who then wound up in policy positions. So you can think of academic ideas affecting government policies by what you might call a trickle-down effect. . . . The most powerful way is when you develop ideas with people who actually then go in and have their hands on the lever, or you get your own hands on the lever. And then ideas are directly related to power. (quoted in Kreisler 1998)\n\nIn most European democracies, academics are less influential compared with their US colleagues. As well, whether in the United States, Europe, or elsewhere, the link between academia and governmental decisionmaking does not always work properly. “In fact, many efforts to build bridges between research and policy have suffered from unrealistic predictions of traffic volume, poor or misleading traffic signs, ignorance of drivers’ motivations and decision-making processes” (Trostle et al. 1999, p. 103). Despite or maybe because of the lack of systematic research on the role of think tanks in transitional regimes, it seems interesting to address this question in the context of Southeast Asia. While the opening up of the foreign policy arena in new democracies will change the dynamics of decisionmaking and probably the issues involved, the participation of new actors does not necessarily improve the quality, efficiency, or outcomes of this process. The example of South Africa’s attempts to sort out its China policy illustrates this point. The question of recognizing the People’s Republic of China was the first substantive foreign policy decision promulgated by the postapartheid government. The difficulties experienced in institutional transformation, with regard both to personnel and to introducing a more open decisionmaking process, constrained policy formation and implementation by the new government to a significant extent. Lingering distrust between members of the old and the new regime hampered the capacity of the country’s foreign affairs department to function optimally within the international environment. The introduction of an open foreign policy raised the profile of interest groups in a society that had little experience in public debate of international issues. At least during the early transitional phase of South Africa’s democratic era, this tended to cause confusion in the management of the formerly elite-exclusive domain of foreign relations (Alden 2001, p. 134). The following analysis of foreign policy making in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand is based on the proposition that democratization\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n30\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:36 PM\n\nPage 30\n\nThe Changing Dynamics of Southeast Asian Politics\n\nin these polities has altered the two-level game due to (1) gradually changing formal and informal rules and procedures that govern foreign policy making; (2) increasing regime accountability, which imposes a significant limitation on the government’s decisionmaking power; and (3) growing state autonomy from social elites, especially the armed forces and cronies, and decreasing state autonomy from civil society and intermediate actors, such as NGOs, business groups, and above all parliaments, that try to exert influence over foreign relations. As the result, one can observe a shift from a statist to a pluralist model of decisionmaking.\n\nFormal and Informal Institutions in Foreign Policy Making\n\nProvisions concerning the conduct of foreign policy can be found within the formal institutional architecture of both the authoritarian and the democratic regimes of Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines. As one would expect, their respective constitutions are the main sources for norms and rules related to foreign affairs, including the respective roles and duties of the executive and legislature in areas such as the negotiation and implementation of international treaties, declaration of war, and command and control of the armed forces. However, as Table 2.1 shows, a comparison of predemocratic and democratic constitutional provisions reveals significant differences in Indonesia and the Philippines. Different formal concepts of foreign policy are partly due to informal institutions, such as traditional perceptions of the head of state’s role and specific experiences in the respective nation’s history. In Indonesia, the constitution of 1945 institutionalized a very strong role for the president. Nine of the thirteen articles of the pre-1999 constitutional text that dealt with the presidency provided powers to the president. Limitations and checks and balances on the president were not given. As Juwono Sudarsono observed in 1994 toward the end of the Suharto regime, Indonesia’s autocratic leader took maximum advantage of this institutional framework: “Even more than in most presidential systems, in Indonesia it is the President—not the foreign minister—who is the chief diplomat. It is President Soeharto who has set the tone and decided on the timing of various foreign policy initiatives that have been taken over the last 25 years or so” (reprinted in Sudarsono 1996, p. 66). Although two amendments made after the downfall of Suharto in 1998 have strengthened the role of the Indonesian parliament (the House of People’s Representatives [DPR]), core provisions related to foreign policy remain unchanged.\n\n8/21/06 2:36 PM\n\ncontinues\n\nConstitution of 1987 Article 2, Section 7: The state shall pursue an independent foreign policy. Article 6, Section 23: 1. The Congress has the sole power to declare war, with the approval of two-thirds of both houses, jointly assembled but voting separately. 2. In time of war or national emergency, the Congress may authorize the president to exercise powers necessary to carry out national policy, with the same restriction as in Article 7, Section 15, of the 1973 constitution.

Neither international treaties nor a declaration of war require the formal consent or any other formalized participation of the Indonesian parliament. Article 11 only asks for the “agreement” of the legislature without institutionalizing any rules specifying the procedure of how any agreement should or must be reached. The hegemonic position of the Indonesian president can only be understood and explained within the context of informal institutions and structures, particularly cultural factors and the influence of history on the nation’s political system. First, the strong position of the chief executive corresponds with the traditional Javanese concept of absolute power. At least until the end of the Suharto regime, large numbers of Indonesians, especially Javanese, perceived the president essentially as a king: “On numerous occasions presidential behaviour is more easily understandable in cultural terms as that of a traditional monarch [rather than as] a modern head of state” (Surbakti 1999, p. 62). Second, the constitution and the role of the president are rooted in the anticolonial struggle and a strong sense of nationalism, including a wide range of sacrosanct national symbols. In the view of both the drafters of the constitution and subsequent political elites, a successful process of nation building required strong political leadership in all policy areas, including foreign policy (for details, see Leifer 2000a; Weinstein 1972). One of the most important national symbols and a core element of the consensus-driven and nonnegotiable blueprint for Indonesia’s external relations has been the doctrine of a free and active foreign policy (politik bebas dan aktif) introduced by the first vice president, Mohammad Hatta. Rather than prescribing a neutralist stance, “the foreign policy doctrine was designed to keep Indonesia’s independence to a maximum, by allowing the country to pursue whatever course deemed best to serve its national priorities, without being tied up to the external commitments it could not control” (Anwar 1994, p. 18). Third, politics in Indonesia are characterized by a distinct interrelationship between foreign policy and domestic politics. For example, except for a short period during the national revolution, Indonesian governments have been keen to avoid the influence or even dictates of Islamic considerations in foreign policy: “They have sought to avoid incautious engagement in international issues which might be exploited either to advance claims presented by Muslim groups or to enhance the political standing of Islam in the Republic” (Leifer 1983, p. xvi). In sum, foreign policy of both the Sukarno regime and the Suharto government fell into the statist model and can be described as a blocked two-level game, because structural factors, both formal and informal, prevented, as far as possible, the participation of actors other than the president and a very small group of political elites.\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n34\n\n8/21/06\n\n2:36 PM\n\nPage 34\n\nThe Changing Dynamics of Southeast Asian Politics\n\nAlthough the respective constitutional provisions in Indonesia have not been changed since 1998 (with the exception of Article 13, which institutionalizes the DPR’s participation in the process of ambassadorial appointments), foreign policy making in the era of democratization no longer seems to be guided by the once powerful informal institutions of the authoritarian past. It will be shown below that, despite the lack of new constitutional procedures in the area of foreign policy, actors outside the executive are already successfully influencing the management of Indonesia’s external relations. Unlike political change in Indonesia, the redemocratization of the Philippines has brought about important implications for formal procedures of foreign policy making. On 21 September 1972, then-president Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law, closed the Philippine Congress, and assumed its "
