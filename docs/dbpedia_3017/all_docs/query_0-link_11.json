        "text": "----\n\nAt Cendana Street, there was a big frown on Chairwoman of PKPB Tutut Soeharto’s at the standing ovation greeting President Try Sutrisno’s announcements on rice policy and the establishment of sago as staple food in Maluku, Irian Jaya, and East Nusa Tenggara.\n\n“He’s butchering Dad’s policies”, she said.\n\n“He’s playing it smart, Mbakyu”, said Tutut’s brother Bambang Trihatmodjo.\n\n“You’re defending him?” asked Tutut in disbelief.\n\n“Mas Bambang has a point”, said Tutut’s brother-in-law and Chairman of the PKPB National Campaign Prabowo Subianto “People who think that the last 3 decades had been a success for Indonesia but who think that some changes need to be made around the edges are the people for whom the President holds strong appeal. That’s why all we’ve been hearing is “We’ve done well, we just need to do this and that to be even better.”\n\n“How do we counter it?” asked Tutut again.\n\n“We don’t”, replied Prabowo calmly “We’ve got to keep playing our game. We’ve got a well-funded organization around Indonesia, that’s what’s prompting him to use the State Address as a veiled campaign speech. We keep playing our game, we put as many PKPB members as possible in the DPR and MPR, and we increase your chances of winning.”\n\n---\n\n“\n\nUtilizing Our Natural Resources ​\n\nHonorable members of the DPR,\n\nMuch has been made about our nation’s natural resources. People say that we only need to plant a seed into our soil, do nothing, and plants would sprout. If we were to believe that quote and all that has been said about our national resources then all of us in this building has no business being here because everything would be just fine.\n\nAs in life, we live not on how much potential we have but what we do with that potential. For our nation to successfully conduct national development, all of the natural resources that has been endowed to us by Almighty God must be placed at our disposal and utilized.\n\nAnd so today I outline the Government’s aspirations as it relates to natural resources.\n\nNatural Resources That Has Not Been Fully Utilized:\n\nFellow Indonesians,\n\nOur nation comprises of more than 17,000 islands, 81,000 KMs of coastline and 62% of our total area comprise of water. Despite this and despite the song which says that “my ancestor was a sailor”, we forget or don’t acknowledge enough that we are a maritime nation. Calling ourselves an “agrarian nation”, the large natural resource that is our sea is lumped together as part of agriculture.\n\nOur seas and the resources contained within are too important to be merely lumped together. This was why at a time when we were cutting spending, I had no second thoughts about forming a Department of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. We needed to secure and utilize our maritime resources. We also want fisheries to provide employment and a livelihood for those who choose fisheries as their path and for fisheries to provide an alternative source of food.\n\nIt is this Government’s intention that fisheries should have the same role in our seas that agriculture plays on land. To be sure, there is more to be done in this regard”\n\nApplause by DPR members.\n\n“Land is another natural resource we have yet to utilize properly; for the simple fact that the Government has not been good enough in the services it provide.\n\nSince 1988, our nation has had a National Agrarian Agency (BPN). In its 13 years of existence, the BPN has issued 30 million land certificates. If as the numbers suggest we have an estimated 89 million land parcels, it means that we’ve only issued land certificates for 1/3 of our lands. The other 2/3 have gone unrecorded and this could may well lead to disputes.\n\nIn the last few years the Government has focused on issuing land certificates for houses and buildings developed and/or sold in the last two years as well as land to be released for infrastructure projects but we, in this case the BPN, need to do better. Not only in terms of simplifying and cleaning up procedures for the issuance land certificates but also further developing the BPN’s capabilities through computerization.\n\nBy providing for legal certainty on land we will make it possible for Indonesians to feel more secure in utilizing their land whether it be to build a property, open a business on it, rent the land or use it as a collateral for bank loans in order to open a business.\n\nSuch are our natural resources which has only begun to be utilized.\n\nMaximizing Our Utilization of Natural Resources:\n\nMr. Chairman,\n\nWhat natural resources we are already utilizing needs to be maximized so that it will make a large contribution to our development.\n\nIn tourism, this means promoting alternative tourist attractions, building infrastructure leading to these alternative tourist attractions, and supporting the tourism, hospitality, and related industries as it relates to these alternative tourist attractions. We do not want our tourism industry to only be reliant on one location if our goal, as stated in Repelita VII, is for tourism to be our largest foreign currency earner.\n\nMaximalization also applies in mining. In the nearly 4 years since I had assumed office, the Government has gone ahead with projects to construct the second and third EXOR oil refineries. EXOR II will be in Sorong, Irian Jaya in cooperation with partners including Saudi Arabia’s Aramco and ground has been broken last year while EXOR III will be in Bintan, Riau with partners including British Petroleum with ground due to be broken late this year or early next.\n\nToday I announce that we will also proceed with the fourth EXOR refinery. This refinery will be located in Dumai Riau and…. “\n\nApplause by DPR members.\n\n“…and our partners for this project will also include Brazil’s Petrobras. I must credit the Vice President at this point for his ongoing work in convincing the Brazilians to be involved with this project….”\n\nVice President JB Sumarlin smiled at the applause that came his way. Try turned to him and nodded.\n\n“The Government attaches great importance to these projects in the field of energy for two reasons. First, it will allow us to export petroleum rather than merely crude oil. Second, though these refineries will be export-oriented, it will also allow us to meet more of our increased domestic requirements.\n\nFellow Indonesians wherever you may be,\n\nThe Government wishes to utilize and maximize the utilization of all of the nation’s natural resources in the interests of the Indonesian people. When these interests are not well-served, the Government reserves the right to take action on behalf of the Indonesian people.\n\nOur forests, much as our other natural resources, are the third largest tropical forests in the world. It is a utilized natural resources in the pursuit of national development. Yet all of us here in this building and at home know that our forests are wrongly taken advantage of by those acting out of selfish short term interests, often times holders of forest concessions operating beyond the boundaries of what they are legally allowed to do and not following regulations.\n\nIn 1997, news came to light of a company based in Tawau, Sabah, Malaysia was caught ferrying 3,000 undocumented logs from across the border in East Kalimantan. It was further found that the logs belonged to a “major concessionaire” in Indonesia and that these 3,000 undocumented logs only is only 1/7 of all undocumented logs smuggled from Indonesia to Malaysia to be then exported to Japan. The Government has conducted investigation and has determined that to this day, this concessionaire, identified as PT Yamaker has continued its illegal operations.\n\nIn July, as previously announced by the Government, a 12 month period has begun in which all forest concessionaires are given the opportunity to comply with existing laws and regulations before legal action is taken against those contravening the law.\n\nWith reference to PT Yamaker’s continuing non-compliance of the law and to show the seriousness of the Government to protect Indonesia’s natural resources, I announce today that the revocation of PT Yamaker’s Forest Concession Right and that as of 1st January 2002, these concession rights will be taken over by PT. Perhutani.”\n\nThe applause this time was led by ABRI’s DPR members led by the Leader of ABRI in the DPR Fachrul Rozi. The camera cut to Commander of ABRI Wiranto who was giving a strong applause at the cabinet ministers’ seats.\n\n“I do not wish to be seen as handing out punishments or making examples. Only that now all forest concession holders engaging in smuggling, illegal logging, building illegal saw mills and other illegal activities will bring their arrangements to order.”\n\n---\n\nSomewhere in South Jakarta, Chairwoman of PNI Megawati Soekarnoputri and her inner circle also watched the speech.\n\n“That’s a big one”, said Secretary of PNI Sutjipto “He’s sending a message there: “If I’m willing to go after a forest concession holder affiliated to and backed by ABRI, I’m going to be even more willing to go after everybody else.”\n\n“On the other hand”, began Taufiq Kiemas “He needs something big in natural resources to compensate for the fact that he couldn’t do anything about Freeport.”\n\n“I’m curious what he bought ABRI off with”, said Treasurer of PNI Laksamana Sukardi “That’s over 1 million hectares of forest concessions he just revoked.”\n\n“If our source in the Try camp is correct, those 5 new infantry brigades announced not too long ago was the price for this”, said Taufiq “Along with spending more on defense .”\n\nHuman Resources​\n\nHonorable members of the DPR,\n\nWhilst our natural resources are plentiful, they will be of no use if there is no one to utilize and take advantage of it. Our lands will remain empty, our minerals will remain underground, and our industries unbuilt unless there are those among us with the necessary skills and integrity to use these resources well and for a greater good better than themselves. Increasingly, our emphasis on what we need to utilize most must shift from our natural resources to human resources.\n\nEducation:\n\nBefore we can utilize our human resources, we must develop it and key to this is our education.\n\nThe Government is committed to the following in education:\n\n-Achieving Compulsory 9 Year Education by the end of Repelita VII:\n\nDuring the Asian Financial Crisis, as part of the May 1998 Stimulus Package and to encourage economic activity, the Government has engaged in a massive program to build junior high school buildings; significantly expanding the physical infrastructure for this level of education. We have built on that by increasing teacher training. Post-crisis, the Government has been very heartened to find that people, especially of low income and in both rural and urban areas, are secure enough economically and enthusiastic enough to send their children to school.\n\nThough the original aim has been for the end of Repelita VIII in 2009 Financial Year to achieve Compulsory 9 Years Education, the Government feels that the present circumstances should be taken advantage of and have made it the goal to ensure Compulsory 9 Years Education by the end of Replita VII in 2004.\n\n-Vocational Education:\n\nBeyond these 9 years of education, the Government will be emphasizing improvement of access towards vocational education. This is so that our young men and women have more opportunity to become skilled, making them a more attractive prospect for employment in factories, mines, hotels, and construction sites or as the case may be, the certification needed to be a service provider as they open their own car repair garage or hairdressing salon.\n\n-Early Childhood Education:\n\nWhen I assumed office, there are 115 state kindergartens across Indonesia mostly functioning as pilot projects and training centers for kindergarten teachers and operators. In my time as president, this number has not changed much. Compare this to the more than 41,000 private kindergartens across Indonesia and is it any wonder that early childhood education is still considered a luxury.\n\nEarly childhood education should not be a luxury. Instead, it should be an opportunity for all to begin early with their child’s personal development.\n\nThis is why in March this year, I have given approval to the Minister of Education to begin expansion of access to kindergartens across the nation. Teachers are receiving training and state primary schools around the nation have begun adding additional classrooms and expanding their playgrounds to facilitate kindergarten classes which will take place there. Reading, writing, and counting will be taught in kindergartens but the emphasis will be on moral education so that our children, from the earliest age, will be prepared to have morals and values so that they can become good citizens.\n\nWe have begun with 115 state kindergartens, our goal is by 2008, early childhood education, at the very least kindergarten, will available for all Indonesians…”\n\nThe President stops as another applause greeted this announcement.\n\n“\n\nWorking Lifes:\n\nHonorable members of the DPR,\n\nWhatever the choice they make in their working lives, I hope that, as much as possible, all Indonesians will come to have employment that is meaningful for themselves, the opportunity to use the skills which they have acquired, and through these things make a positive contribution to society whatever their line of work is.\n\nThe Government’s goal as it relates to the people’s working life is to ensure the best working conditions possible because employment is the means by which people earn income for themselves and their families.\n\nIn 1997, my predecessor’s Government had passed a Manpower Law. However controversy surrounding the process of passing this law along with the Government’s priority on making sure that Indonesians are able to be employed again as the economy recovers, has meant that this law has not implemented though at the same time it has not come info effect.\n\nAfter conducting careful study, the Government has determined that not only that this law has not come into effect but that this law should not come into effect. Accordingly, with this address I have attached a letter to you, Mr. Chairman, asking for the DPR’s agreement that this law be revoked.\n\nIn its place, the Government intends to submit a new Manpower Bill by the end of the year. This bill will contain provisions regulating such things working conditions, minimum wages, and dismissals, the aim of which will be to establish an industrial system acceptable to workers and employers alike and which will facilitate the creation of employment.\n\nFellow Indonesians,\n\nOne phenomena which we all witnessed during the Asian Financial Crisis is that more of our fellow citizens, usually after losing their employment, have decided to create employment rather than look for it. Often understated is the role that small and medium enterprises have played in our economic recovery. These small and medium enterprises create employment initially the person setting up the business and as it grows, generating further employment for others and encouraging others to try the same.\n\nIt is the Government’s task, across the various departments and agencies, to facilitate the nation’s small and medium enterprises so that it can make its contribution to our nation’s economic life in accordance with Presidential Instruction 4/1995. I would like to emphasize two ways in which the Government can facilitate these enterprises:\n\nFirst, though such services should be provided to all citizens not just small and medium enterprises, the Government can facilitate small and medium enterprises by cutting bureaucratic red tape; less waiting times, less bureaucratic hurdles to go through, and less forms to sign. The worst thing the Government can do at a time when people are interested in opening businesses is to get caught up in being bureaucratic.\n\nSecond, the Government can facilitate, though once again this treatment should be given to all citizens, small and medium enterprises by giving them legal certainty and equal opportunity. Whatever their size, the regional or ethnic origin of the owners, or how close they are to those in positions in power they must not be favored or discriminated against. They must have equal opportunity.\n\nHealth:\n\nMr. Chairman,\n\nNo less important than educating and skilling as well as facilitating our human resources is the task of ensuring their physical well-being. Without good health, Indonesians will not be able to be active and productive in their daily lives.\n\nThe Government’s health policy has been centered around ensuring that our population have access to primary healthcare treatment. Since the 1997/1998 financial year the number of our Community Health Centers has remained at 7,106. However since 1999, the Government has undergone a building program so that all of these Community Health Center buildings will have a second floor. This will increase each Community Health Center’s capacity to provide primary health care as there will be more room for patients though this will be augmented by the recruitment of additional staff.\n\nBy the end of the current financial year, over 3,200 Community Health Centers or nearly half of the all existing Community Health Centers… “\n\nApplause from the DPR members.\n\n“…of all existing Community Health Centers will have a second floor and the Government has every intention of completing this and enacting other measures to provide better health services to Indonesians.”\n\nManaging Our Population:\n\nHonorable members of the DPR,\n\nBased on the results of last year’s census, at 204,9 million inhabitants, we are the fourth most populous nation on the planet. On the one hand this makes Indonesia an attractive place as a place to invest in given our potential as a market and as pool of labor.\n\nFor the Government, it means that our population must be managed.\n\nIn the short term this will be done through our continuing of the transmigration program. We will continue to encourage families to move from Java and settle them in the other major islands around the nation. By giving more priority to those intending to open a business at their new place of settlement and encouraging economic and infrastructure development at transmigration destinations specifically and outside of Java more generally, the Government is seeking to make transmigration an increasing attractive proposition for those wishing to make a new life for themselves and their family.\n\nFor the long term, the Government will continue with Family Planning. Though Family Planning campaigns have made as its slogan “Two Children Is Enough”, the nation’s fertility rate as of last year’s census stands at 2.7 babies so that it might be said that though this program has been successful in decreasing birthrates in its three decades of existence, it had not achieved the goal it had set out in its slogan. The goal of the Government with family planning will be to first to reduce fertility rate to at least 2.5 in the medium term and then to 2.0 in the longer term.”\n\n---\n\nAs DPR members around him gave an applause to another policy announcement by the President, DPR Member/Chairman of PPP Matori Abdul Djalil chuckled to himself. He had thought this would be a routine speech but had perked up when the President first openly criticized the Government’s “complacency” before the Asian Financial Crisis and then when one after another, the President announced goals that he would like to achieve across various areas of policy in the speech.\n\nMatori had done the calculations in his head, there were 19 more months until the President’s current term comes to an end. It would definitely need more than 19 months for the President to implement all the things he was saying and now all this talk about the medium and longer term…\n\n---\n\nThat ran longer than I had planned so the section on society gets shifted to the next post.\n\nThe number of only 1/3 of all land are certified is from page 2 of https://successfulsocieties.princet...es/LS_Land_Indonesia_Formatted_12.12.17_1.pdf The only difference is that the OTL numbers was reached in 2005 whereas the ITTL numbers is reached in 2001 in keeping with the “ITTL doing better than OTL” theme.\n\nStory of Yamaker is from https://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/articles/AObidzinski0701.pdf\n\nYamaker’s affiliation to ABRI was that it was a military cooperative. OTL, its forest concession was revoked by Habibie in 1999.\n\nCompulsory 9 Years Education originally being envisioned to be completed in 15 years comes from Wardiman Djojonegoro’s memoirs (https://books.google.co.id/books?id=RCdIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=wardiman+djojonegoro&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwixkKPh0pDuAhUo6nMBHZHqCmoQ6AEwAXoECAMQAg#v=onepage&q=wardiman djojonegoro&f=false), there’s some parts here where complains about not getting enough funding to achieve Compulsory 9 Years Education though it’s somehow one of the pages that was not scanned. I would point to p. 309 to see some of his concerns.\n\nNumbers of state kindergartens vs private kindergartens circa 1997/1998 comes from https://www.bappenas.go.id/id/data-...rtanggungjawaban-presiden-tahun-1993-sd-1998/ Chapter XVIII.\n\nThe “Puskesmas has second floor” program comes from ITTL. Please go to Threadmark 47 for the beginning of this program.\n\nRetconned Indonesia’s ITTL Population in 2000 from 202,3 million to 204,9 million so that the decrease in birthrate is not so drastic. OTL population is 206 million.\n\nThe 1997 Manpower Law is controversial not only because it faced strong resistance from workers but also because when it was formulated, then-Minister of Manpower Abdul Latief allegedly used Rp. 7,1 billion of Jamsostek money to help “smooth” the passing the law. When news began to break of this issue, Soeharto said that he would handle it though nothing ever came of it. Wahid also tried to prosecute but the prosecution was ceased in 2000.\n\nThe ITTL fertility rate being at 2.7 is based on https://www.bappenas.go.id/files/da...erah/Statistik 70 Tahun Indonesia Merdeka.pdf where the fertility rate in 1997 is 2.8 with the assumption that the fertility rate has decreased since 1997.\n\n“\n\nPancasila Society​\n\nMr. Chairman,\n\nWe seek to aim for high growth and utilize all of the resources available not merely to build an economy but to build a society. Indeed, our goal in the past has been “A Just and Prosperous Society Based On Pancasila”. For the present however, we need to do one better. We should aim not only to be a society based on Pancasila but be a Pancasila Society.\n\nAdherence to Pancasila:\n\nTo be a Pancasila Society we must first adhere to Pancasila.\n\nThis Government believes in Pancasila. It believes in each of the Pancasila’s 5 principles, it believes that Pancasila should continue to be disseminated through continuation of P4 training.\n\nMore importantly, it believes that those propagating ideas and worldview contrary to Pancasila should be resisted.\n\nThere are two main ideologies and worldviews contrary to Pancasila and which seeks to replace it. The first is the Extreme Left which advocates class struggle and the second is the Extreme Right, which seeks to replace Pancasila with religious-based rule.\n\nThe assassination of the Chairman of BP-7 in February 2000 and Operation Sledgehammer which was conducted in January 2001 -of those with links to radical organizations Jemaah Islamiyah and Al Qaeda and of those propagating the Extreme Right in general- has convinced the Government that its vigilance at the present time must be directed towards the Extreme Right.\n\nThis does not lessen our vigilance towards the Extreme Left or any other ideologies and worldviews hostile towards Pancasila, but we must remind ourselves that our vigilance must be directed towards all those seeking to replace Pancasila irrespective of where in the political spectrum they came from.\n\nBhinneka Tunggal Ika:\n\nTo be a Pancasila Society is to live according to our state motto Bhinneka Tunggal Ika. Unity in Diversity.\n\nWe are over 200 million people, over 17,000 islands, over 600 ethnicities, and 6 recognized faiths. This is who we are: Bhinneka Tunggal Ika, Unity in Diversity. There should not be nor should there any need for distinctions between majorities and minorities. There should not be nor should there be fear of being dominated by majorities or minorities. Everyone is an Indonesian.\n\nThe Government will not stand idly by if there are those within our country seeking to divide our nation along religious, ethnicity, class, or other lines.”\n\nLed by its ABRI members, the DPR gave a standing applause at this.\n\n“This diversity is us and when we acknowledge it, we are all the more dynamic and all the more strong for it.\n\nHousing:\n\nTo be a Pancasila Society is not only about ideals and visions. In this society, it is always implied that at a material level the basic needs of the members of this society are guaranteed. Sufficient food, sufficient clothing, though today I would like to focus on sufficient housing.\n\nHousing is important and not only because it is a basic need. If the supply of houses cannot keep up with the demand for housing in these economic times, prices of houses will increase and housing will become less accessible.\n\nTo account for the Asian Financial Crisis and the effect that it has had on the construction and property development sector and the Government’s priorities on stimulus with fiscal responsibility, Repelita VII has set a target of 450,000 new simple and very simple houses between 1999/2000 and 2003/2004. This is lower than the Repelita VI target of 500,000. Our economy now in a better shape and with over 280,000 constructed, it is the Government’s intention that we should exceed this target by the end of this term in March 2003.\n\nBeyond that the Government must make up for lost time and in that respect, today I announce that for Repelita VIII, the Government will be setting a target of 1,000,000 new simple and very simple…\"\n\nA standing applause led by the DPR members from PKPI.\n\n“…and very simple houses.\n\nHonorable members of the DPR,\n\nThough the Asian Financial Crisis is over in Indonesia, there is one unfinished business which the nation has left to settle when it comes to the effects of this crisis. As a result of the loss of value in our currency there are some of our fellow Indonesians who have fallen back into poverty. After reaching a rate of 11% in 1996, the number of those living below the poverty line reached 15% in 1998 before decreasing to 14.4% in 1999 and then again to 13% in 2000. The Government’s goal remains to reach 11%, or back to pre-crisis levels in 1996 before the end of the current term…”\n\nApplause by DPR members.\n\n“The ultimate goal, however, is not to stop at 11%. It is to make sure that all Indonesians are lifted out of poverty. To that end the Government has two programs in store.\n\nThe first, already announced, of which pilot projects have already begun, and where the full program will begin next financial year will be the Empowered Communities National Program (PNPM). This program will allow communities in urban and rural areas to -with oversight over budget, planning, and implementation- decide to themselves what kind of projects will be most relevant and best-suited to the needs of their communities when it comes to poverty eradication…”\n\nThere was applause from the DPR’s PKPI members though the PKPB members noticeably kept quiet; the establishment of the PNPM program coming at the expense of the Left Behind Villages Presidential Instruction program initiated by President Soeharto.\n\n“The second program, will require more preparation as its scope is significantly larger. That is why today, as a first step, I announce the formation of an Interdepartmental Team to be chaired by the Vice President which will look into the possibility and feasibility of a National Social Insurance System. This team will look a whether or not our Nation has the capability to provide an expanded national health insurance and national work insurance scheme…”\n\nThe DPR’s PKPI members, with proud looks on their faces gave the President a standing ovation followed by the PPP and ABRI members. The PKPB members took their time but reluctantly joined in.\n\n“\n\nBeing Confident On The World Stage​\n\nFellow Indonesians,\n\nAs we go about making our aspirations come true; to grow our economy and utilize all of our resources both natural and human as well as establish a Pancasila society for the sake of national development, we also want to do these things to increase our stature in the world, we need to remember that Indonesia does not exist in a vacuum. We must take into account our international environment and use the developments occurring in it to our advantage.\n\nTherefore, our nation’s aspiration as it looks outwards into the world is that we want our nation to be confident when it stands on the world stage.\n\nEngaging Economically With The World:\n\nMr. Chairman,\n\nOur nation is confident on the world stage when it is engaging economically with the world. This has been reflected in our commitment from the mid-1980s of adopting an outward-looking stance so that we can sell what we make not only to our domestic population but also to the world market. Since that time, the majority of our exports have come from the ranks of non-oil and gas exports.\n\nToday I reiterate our two-pronged export strategy.\n\nThe first is that we should export value-added goods. Up until the present, our tendency has been to export our goods, in particular our agricultural commodities, in its raw form. We must change our strategy. We must keep these raw goods in the country, add value to it, and then export it overseas. This is why I have decided to ban raw rattan exports. Why export rattan in its raw form when we can process it in our country, encourage industry and employment in the country while we are at it, and then export it as furniture?\n\nThe second is that we must expand our export markets. The lesson of the current international recession is that we cannot rely on our major markets to remain economically healthy all the time. The consequence of being export-oriented is that when our market suffers a downturn, our exports also suffer a downturn. As a result, the Government has begun to embark on a strategy to tap into markets in the developed world by promoting exports of fast moving consumer goods. It will not only be our instant noodles which will find space on shelves in Papua New Guinea or Nigeria but also our bottled tea, our detergents, and our over-the-counter medicines.\n\nA matter that is closely related to exports and imports is that of tariffs. In the nearly four years I have held this office, the Government had conducted tariff reductions on an as needed basis to suit the needs of the economy in a particular time rather than as a part of a broader policy package.\n\nToday, I re-commit the Government to pre-existing Free Trade Agreements; in this case the ASEAN Free Trade Area and APEC’s Bogor Goals. Given that the implementation of AFTA was suspended in 1998, I can announce that the Government intends to bring a set of proposals to this year’s ASEAN Summit regarding AFTA. As regards, APEC, the Government is committed to free trade in APEC in 2010 for developed countries and 2020 for developing countries.\n\nAsserting Our National Interests:\n\nHonorable members of the DPR,\n\nOur nation is confident on the world stage when it is able to assert its national interests from a position of independence.\n\nDevelopments in international politics are something that we need to be mindful of. At the beginning of the previous decade all of us witnessed the end of the Cold War and the arrival of of what has been referred to as the End of History. Yet a decade on after the end of the Cold War, its spectre seems to continue to haunt us. The United States, the world’s remaining superpower, is now having its authority questioned and challenged by Russia and the People’s Republc of China. Some say that this is the beginning of a new Cold War though still others point to the emergence of “poles” in the international order and argued that this was the beginning of a multipolar world.\n\nAs it concerns Indonesia, whatever the developments and trends that the world is heading for us, it is imperative for us to focus on our national interests. We should be able to define what these national interests are and leveraging the visible results of the national development we have conducted at home,\n\nbe confident enough to assert these national interests. Our foreign policy must be free and active, to that we must add free and active in the assertion of our national interests.\n\nTo assert our national interests we will need not only confidence but also a position of foreign policy independence through which our interests can be asserted. On a national level, Indonesia must not become a satellite in a “New Cold War” or a proxy of one of the “poles” in a multipolar world.\n\nOn a regional level, the Government believes that the nations of Southeast Asia cannot allow themselves to be used as satellite or proxies. With our sizeable populations and rapidly developing economies, Southeast Asian nations should be able approach the issues of the world from a position of independence and this can only happen if Southeast Asian nations find strength in numbers. As I like to say my fellow Southeast Asian heads of states/governments, the source of their nation’s national security can be found in Southeast Asia but outside of it.\n\nBut we cannot achieve strength in numbers if nations in the region are running the risk of becoming satellite and proxies of nations outside the region or of nations seeking to flex their strength. There are 10 of us in ASEAN. Allowing outside influence means giving free votes for those not in the meeting room when an ASEAN Summit is held. It is this outside influence in the region which must be lessened and stood up against in order for Indonesia more specifically and Southeast Asia more generally.\n\nDefending Ourselves:\n\nFinally, our nation has confidence on the world stage if we are able to defend ourselves.\n\nIn the last 3 decades we have made a conscious effort to focus on economic development and that this has meant a sacrifice on the part of our defense budget. However, as a percentage of GDP and despite our continually developing and growing economy, defense budget continued to decline. From 3.5% of GDP in 1975 to 1.23 % in 1995 before rising to 1.5% in 1997. Throughout the crisis, the Government has stabilized this decline at 1.2% before increasing to 1.5% in 2000.\n\nThe Government intends to significantly increase our nation’s defense spending. This is not a matter of percentages of defense spending to GDP or prestige but a matter of necessity. For a nation with a territory and economy of our size, we need to spend more than 1.5% of our GDP to secure our territories, continually develop ABRI’s weaponry, and care or the welfare of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and policemen. Our neighbors, for example, are spending upwards of 4% and even 5% of their GDP on defense.\n\nThe Government is committed to the defense of our people and to the improvement of ABRI.”\n\n---\n\nAs the ABRI members in the DPR building led the applause, Chairman of PKPI/Leader of the PKPI in the DPR Basofi Sudirman joined in. Basofi smiled, the President had taken in the advice he and Chairman of the PKPI National Campaign Hendropriyono had given; that this State Address, the last one to be given before the 2002 Legislative Elections and with two people gunning for the presidency, should function as a political manifesto of what Try and the PKPI stood for as well as an agenda to the future.\n\nBasofi felt a nudge on his elbow. He turned to his left where DPR member and Treasurer of PKPI Rambe Kamarulzaman waved his mobile phone.\n\n“I just got the message, Mr. Chairman”, he said “The first of the campaign funds has been transferred to the 27 provincial branches.”\n\n---\n\n\"\n\nPancasila Democracy:​\n\nHonorable members of the DPR,\n\nUnderpinning all the aspirations which I have mentioned to you above is our political system. It is important that our political system is stable so that the Government can pursue the aspirations already mentioned. Since 1966, that political system has been Pancasila Democracy.\n\nThis political system, based on the 1945 Constitution, has served us well. In the final years of my predecessor’s presidency, there have been calls that changes to our political system has been necessary.\n\nI agree that after three decades, some changes to our political system is necessary. It is why since I have taken office, the following has been enacted:\n\n-Changes in the relationship between the Central and Regional Governments. Allowing the latter more share in the revenue from natural resources and more leeway in decision-making whilst remaining within the framework of a Unitary State.\n\n-Establishing two new Special Regions in Irian Jaya and East Timor and passing laws providing the legal framework for the 5 Special Regions we now have in Aceh, Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Irian Jaya, and East Timor.\n\n-Establishing an electoral commission where the chairman’s position is not held by the Minister of Home Affairs to allow for neutrality in the conduct of the election.\n\n-Banning civil servants and active members of ABRI from joining political parties unless they have chosen to retire to allow for a more neutral environment in an election but accommodating the possibility of political aspiration.\n\n-Beginning a process which would see authority over courts transferred from the Department of Legal Affairs to the Supreme Court in 5 years for a more independent judicial branch.\n\nThis is not counting the political changes that we had not counted on, the emergence of multiple presidential candidates at the 1998 MPR General Session and the changes in our political parties system; the dissolvement of Golkar, the emergence of the PKPI, PKPB, and PNI, and the absorbtion of the PDI into the PKPB.\n\nI do not for a second disagree that changes can be made to our political system. What I disagree with is the notion that we must change without specifying what it is that such change means. This will lead to change for change’s sake and trying to fit in as much changes as possible. Political reform is important but for the moment, the best guarantor of political reform is political stability. And political stability is ensured by having predictability in our political cycle.\n\nThis is why today, I am making my final announcement in this speech.\n\nI announce that there will be a General Election on Tuesday 21st May 2002. As has been the case with all elections since 1971, this election will determine who sits in the MPR, DPR, the Provincial DPRDs and the Regency/Municipal DPRDs.\n\nThis will be an important election, the first to be held in Indonesia the 21st century. My wish is for all Indonesians to contribute by casting their votes for political parties which will best advance this nation’s cause as it makes its way into the future.”\n\nAudible gasps could be heard throughout the DPR building, especially from the PKPB members.\n\n“Mr. Chairman,\n\nSuch are the aspirations that I have set out for the Government and for the nation: high economic growth and low inflation, resilient industry and strong agriculture, utilizing our natural resources, nurturing our human resources, a Pancasila Society, being confident on the world stage, and Pancasila Democracy.\n\nI have outlined these aspirations so that this Independence Day, we do not merely celebrate the past and the present but look to an even better future.\n\nBecause it is all of our hope that this nation in the future will be even more advanced and even more solid in its unity as we go on to fulfill our nation’s goals and realize the goals of the Proclamation of Independence made in 1945.\n\nMay Almighty God always bless this beloved nation of ours.\n\nThank you.\n\nAssalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh.”\n\n---\n\nThank God it’s done hahahaha. My goal with this speech was just to show that we’re transitioning where increasingly what is considered history are things happening ITTL. Assassination of the Chairman of BP-7 Operation Sledgehammer against the members of the extreme right, and the political reforms mentioned towards the end are all events that happen ITTL.\n\nThe stats regarding housing in Repelita VI comes from https://www.bappenas.go.id/id/data-...ertanggungjawaban-presiden-tahun-1993-sd-1998 chapter X\n\nSo we have ITTL’s version of BPJS is also in the process of being worked on here.\n\nDefense spending as a percentage of GDP comes from https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/IDN/indonesia/military-spending-defense-budget\n\nThank you for all who’s been coming back despite the fact that we’ve been stuck on ITTL 16th August 2001 for some time. Let’s get moving through time again.\n\n17th August 2001:\n\nPresident Try Sutrisno, looking decidedly very confident after making his State Address, led the nation as it commemorated the 56th Anniversary of the Nation’s Independence.\n\nAfter the Independence Day ceremonies, the President and Vice President JB Sumarlin accompanied by Minister of Industry Siswono Yudohusodo and State Minister of State-Owned Enterprises Bacelius Ruru attended a teleconference for a groundbreaking ceremony for an iron smelter in South Kalimantan. The iron smelter is owned by PT Meratus Jaya, joint venture between state-owned enterprises PT Antam and PT Krakatau Steel.\n\nThen there were Friday prayers at Istiqlal Mosque with the President sitting in the front row with Chairman of DPR Harmoko.\n\nApproaching evening, the guests at the Presidential Palace began gathering again for the flag-lowering ceremony. Chairwoman of PKPB Tutut Soeharto and her husband Indra Rukmana were early and bumped into another couple who had came early; Chairwoman of PNI Megawati Soekarnoputri and her husband Taufieq Kiemas.\n\n“He ambushed us with that Election announcement did he not, Mbak?” asked Tutut after the pleasantries were over.\n\n“You have your funds and organizations, I have my masses and activists, he has his incumbency”, shrugged Megawati “We all have to play to our strengths.”\n\n19th August 2001:\n\nSecretary of PNI/Chairman of the PNI’s National Campaign Sutjipto accompanied by Kwik Kian Gie and Rizal Ramli held a joint press conference. The three provided a response to the President’s State Address. They notably highlighted the President’s silence on Freeport as an admission that the Government had failed to get Freeport to begin divesting its shares to Indonesia as well as the abolition of the National Commission of Human Rights as evidence that the Government does not care about human rights.\n\nA book entitled “President Try’s Aspirations For The Future” which is a transcript of the 2001 State Address and published by the PKPI National Campaign Team begin to appear in bookshops.\n\n20th August 2001:\n\nSpeaking to reporters on his way to his office, Minister of Home Affairs Harsudiono Hartas clarified that the President’s announcement about the election date only means that Indonesia has an election date but that things such as when the campaign will be held will be determined later. He called on all four political parties to focus instead of preparing their list of DPR candidates.\n\nIn a television interview, Leader of PKPB in the DPR Hartono said that the President’s “staple food” policy was essentially the government giving up on rice self-sufficiency.\n\n21st August 2001:\n\nMinister of Agriculture Sarwono Kusumaatmadja, Head of Bulog Adang Ruchiatna, Head of Setdal Bimas Usman Hasan, and the top officials of the Department of Agriculture came out of a meeting with the President. Speaking to the press, Sarwono said that the President discussed with them about implementation of his vision for agriculture. Sarwono had a wry smile when he was asked if the Government was giving up on rice self-sufficiency.\n\n“That’s the kind of reaction that I would expect from those who want to impose uniformity on what people eat”, said Sarwono.\n\n22nd August 2001:\n\nThe PPP’s National Leadership Council held a meeting today to discuss election preparations. Those inside described a shouting match between Chairman of PPP Matori Abdul Djalil and Chairman of the PPP’s National Campign Hamzah Haz. Hamzah asked why was the PPP not told about the election if it was part of the President’s coalition while Matori said that Hamzah should make it clear he supports the Government rather than “flirting” with the idea of supporting Tutut and PKPB.\n\nAfterwards, Secretary of PPP Bachtiar Chamsyah read out a statement saying that the PPP was ready to mount a strong campaign at the 2002 Elections.\n\nMinister of Education Fakry Gaffar and Minister of Civil Service Kuntoro Mangkusubroto came out of a meeting with with the President. They announced that President Try had approved for the formation of a Directorate General of Early Childhood Education.\n\n23rd August 2001:\n\nThe President and his entourage arrived at Husein Sastaranegara Airbase in Bandung, West Java in the morning. Along with Minister of Transportation Soerjadi Soedirja, State Minister of Research and Technology Indra Bambang Utoyo, State Secretary Edi Sudrajat, and Governor of West Java Muzani Syukur, CEO of IPTN Said Djauharsjah Jenie, and BJ Habibie, the President was there to witness IPTN’s third N-250 prototype take flight for the first time. In his speech after the plane had landed, the President hailed IPTN’s aircrafts as “visible signs” of Indonesia’s progress as a nation.\n\nThe conversation around the lunch table after the ceremony had finished, it was made known to the President that the next challenge for the N-250 was gaining FAA Certification. Said Jenie explained that the FAA had been slow but got worst after the change from the Clinton to McCain Administration. Try said that he would look into it though he said Indonesia’s relationship with the United States was not at its best at the moment.\n\n24th August 2001:\n\nThe President went to Friday prayer and had lunch with Chairman of DPR Harmoko. The two discussed recent political happenings as well as matters of state such as legislation to be passed. The two agreed that the Manpower Bill, when it came, would be a priority given how important it was to the livelihood for many.\n\n“In other news, I hear you’ve changed your domicile to Solo, Central Java, Mr. Chairman”, said Try, moving on to other things.\n\n“You heard correctly, Mr. President”, replied Harmoko cheerfully “Just wanted to change it to my hometown. In 1997, I ran for a DPR seat representing West Java, this time I want to run representing Central Java.”\n\n“I always thought you were from Nganjuk”, countered Try referring to the East Javanese town.\n\n“Just born there, Mr. President”, said Harmoko “Always been a Solo boy.”\n\n“But Central Java”, began Try “If I read my PKPI National Campaign briefing correctly, it’s going to be a battleground.”\n\n“It will be”, confirmed Harmoko “Prabowo did enough when he was Governor of Central Java to create a base of support for the PKPB there, it’s Matori’s home province and he wants to win there, Megawati normally runs as a DPR member representing there, but I’m up for a fight.”\n\n25th August 2001:\n\nInterviewed on RRI about recent political developments, Chairman of ICMI Nurcholish Madjid was asked who ICMI would support in the next election. Nurcholish said that ICMI would not support either one of PKPI, PKPB, PNI, or PPP and gave his explanation.\n\n“I think on an individual level, ICMI members might want to support certain political parties and might even want to be candidates but that’s a matter for them. They will of course bring with them their background as ICMI members and lobby for support from ICMI members but as an organization ICMI would not get involved. We would stay neutral”, said Nurcholish.\n\n“What about beyond that? What about the 2003 MPR General Session”, asked the host.\n\n“Pretty much the same”, Nurcholish began “Whoever the presidential candidates are, ICMI has to stay neutral and I’ll give you two reasons. First, we’ve progressed to a period where I don’t think we will ever again see one presidential candidate ever again. There were four presidential candidates at the 1998 MPR General Session and I’m pretty certain there will be multiple candidates in 2003. From where I sit, I believe that it is in ICMI’s interest that we are able to work together with whoever is the president in 2003 so it’s not wise if we declare we’re for this or that candidate.\n\nSecond, remember that the MPR consists of Group Delegates and Regional Delegates; MPR Delegates who are supposed to represent organizations and all walks of life and from the provinces. For ICMI as an organization to exercise the people’s sovereignty on the people’s behalf and exercise it credibly they need to have some detachment from the candidates, otherwise they’re better off joining one of the political parties. This goes for ICMI as well as these MPR delegates to be.”\n\n27th August 2001:\n\nAt the Presidential Palace, the President swore in a batch of ambassadors which included the following:\n\n*Lt. Gen. Kiki Syahnakri as Ambassador to Myanmar\n\n*Maj. Gen. (Ret.) Tuswandi as Ambassador to Cambodia\n\n*R. Adm. Freddy Numberi as Ambassador to Papua New Guinea\n\nAfter the ceremony, the President and Minister of Foreign Affairs Ginandjar Kartasasmita gathered the ambassadors though these three were singled out. The President told Kiki and Tuswandi not to let Myanmar and Cambodia fall into China’s orbit while Freddy’s instructions were to strengthen relations with Papua New Guinea and use it as a door to Oceania.\n\n28th August 2001:\n\nThe President met with Sumarlin, Minister of Economics and National Development Planning Dorodjatun Kuntjoro-Jakti, Minister of Finance Mar’ie Muhammad, Governor of BI Boediono, Edi Sudrajat, Cabinet Secretary Hayono Isman and OCDS Sugeng Subroto.\n\nSumarlin emerged out of the meeting along with the ministers plus Boediono. The Vice President explained that the meeting was about the nation’s economic prospects over a longer term and more specifically how best to implement the aspirations outlined by the President in the State as far as national development planning and budgeting was concerned.\n\nWhen asked if the Government was preparing an agenda for the next term, Sumarlin laughed. He only said that a) the President’s focused on this term and b)if anyone wants to lead Indonesia their vision should be longer than 18 months.\n\n29th August 2001:\n\nChairman of the PKPB’s National Campaign Prabowo Subianto’s day began with a breakfast meeting with a grim-looking Tutut Soeharto. Prabowo asked her what was the problem.\n\n“The overseas funds aren’t accessible anymore”, she said in a flat tone as she handed an envelope with a notification from an overseas bank “The bank account has been frozen.”\n\n“Frozen?” he asked, surprised.\n\n“It’s all there, it’s just that it can’t be transferred into the country because the bank account’s frozen”, Tutut explained, puttiing too much of an effort at a poker face “It means the money we could use for the campaign won’t be available anymore.”\n\nThere was an awkward silence.\n\n“Should we go public with this?” asked Tutut “Make people feel insecure that the Government can freeze their savings?”\n\n“No, that would be the wrong move”, replied Prabowo “It would feed into the narrative that this family has wealth hidden all over the world. There’s no doubt they signed some kind of an agreement with the Austrian Government, they’re a Western country with respect for the rule of law. It’s just that our Government is keeping this agreement a secret.”\n\n“Hmmm….” said Tutut thoughtfully “What can we do?”\n\nThere was something in his sister-in-law’s face that made Prabowo want to smile though he knew he had to hide it.\n\n“Well, Mbakyu”, began Prabowo “The President wants to fight you and he’s making sure that when he does, he’s doing it on as even a ground as possible. For Wanandi, Panigoro, Salim, Winata, Bakrie, we’re more of an even match if we don’t have access to those funds.”\n\nTutut fell silent. She stared at the space in front of her.\n\n“Then let’s oblige him and give him that fight”, said Tutut.\n\n“Understood, Mbakyu”, replied Prabowo.\n\n30th August 2001:\n\nThe President and First Lady Tuti Setiawati paid their final respects today to ABRI Chief of Socio-Political Affairs Staff Agus Wirahadikusumah who died that morning of a heart attack. He was seen sitting and chatting with former Vice President Umar Wirahadikusumah who was Agus’ uncle. He was also seen talking with Commander of ABRI Wiranto and ABRI Chief of General Staff Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. On the way out, the President, with Edi Sudrajat walking beside him, had to go through questions asking who will be the new ABRI Chief of Socio-Political Affairs Staff. The President only said that he was there to mourn the lost of one of ABRI’s best sons.\n\n31st August 2001:\n\nA special guest arrived at the Presidential Palace this morning. Accompanied by his son, Minister of Trade Anthony Salim, Liem Sioe Liong met with the President who was accompanied by Edi Sudrajat. The old man and the President exchanged pleasantries and then got down to business.\n\n“I ask for your permission to leave the country, Mr. President”, he said “I’ll just be in Singapore of course, but I just want to sit on the sidelines as you, Tutut, and your supporters clash with each other.”\n\n“I understand, you have that permission, Om Liem”, said Try.\n\n“I don’t begrudge the fact that you and Anthony are on one side while Tutut is on another, perhaps different generations have different ways of doing things”, Liem said again “But President Soeharto was my friend and I must respect the long-relationship that I had with him; though I support your Government, I must distance myself when it comes to the conflict that you are in with Tutut.”\n\n“I understand”, said Try.\n\nThe two exchanged pleasantries before a picture was taken and then it was time for Liem to leave.\n\n“You were always in awe of President Soeharto”, Liem said to the President “As his Aide-de-Camp, as Army Chief of Staff, as Commander of ABRI, as Vice President, that awe was always there.”\n\nTry chuckled to himself.\n\n“And now to sit in his chair and have his daughter be your political opponent”, said Liem “I can’t imagine how that must feel.”\n\n“Guilty\", replied Try quickly with a sad expression on his face \"I feel guilty that she's my political opponent and that I have to fight against her. I feel guilty about it on account of who her father is.\"\n\nThen Try’s face hardened.\n\n“Alas, such is the circumstances that she and I has found ourselves in”, said Try “It's all too late stop us from a collision.\"\n\n---\n\nEveryone’s getting into an election mood.\n\nAgus Wirahadikusumah is a much more tame figure than his OTL self. In OTL he was an advocate of what was then (Wahid presidency) considered radical reform such as no more TNI members sitting in the DPR. His handiwork will make an appearance, albeit posthumously. OTL he died of a heart attack and given his radical change reputation, people speculated about the nature of it. Here I had him died on the basis of this account which suggests that there was an oxygen tank around his house on account of ean earlier condition.\n\nOn a sidenote, the other prominent political death from this time, Baharuddin Lopa, has not occurred. OTL he died from a heart attack brought about exhaustion (though once again there’s speculation about the nature of his death because he was so incorruptible). ITTL Lopa is currently an Inspector General of Development, one of five officials in charge of supervising whether or not Government programs are implemented correctly.\n\nAnthony Salim’s support for Try ITTL is based on his OTL self lobbying for Try to be re-elected vice president in 1998 https://books.google.co.id/books?id=GnKZBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA398&dq=anthony+salim+retain+try+sutrisno&hl=id&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjJkOv6nqzuAhVMqksFHW8EAwIQ6AEwAHoECAYQAg#v=onepage&q=anthony salim retain try sutrisno&f=false\n\nFor comparison’s sake, OTL Try and OTL Tutut still maintain good relations with each other. To the point where Try acted as witness when Tutut’s youngest son got married in 2020 https://kumparan.com/kumparanhits/m...rnikahan-danny-rukmana-dan-raiyah-1sqMnSunjMb. Based on that, what I wanted to convey here is that it's very uncomfortable for him to have Tutut as his rival.\n\n1st September 2001:\n\nHolding a luncheon at the Presidential Palace, President Try Sutrisno accompanied by State Minister of Youth and Sports Hajriyanto Thohari and Chairman of KONI IGK Manila hosted Indonesia’s SEA Games 2001 Contingent which will be departing for Kuala Lumpur that day. He wished them luck and called on them to make the nation proud.\n\n2nd September 2001:\n\nAll of the members of the Pancasila Coalition came to Bogor Presidential Palace this Sunday morning. Chairman of DPR Harmoko, former Chairman of Golkar Wahono, Minister of Foreign Affairs Ginandjar Kartasasmita, BJ Habibie, Chairman of NU Abdurrahman Wahid, Chairman of Muhammadiyah Amien Rais, Chairman of PKPI Basofi Sudirman, and Chairman of PPP Matori Abdul Djalil. After a lunch, they sat around a table with President Try Sutrisno who was accompanied by Minister of Home Affairs Harsudiono Hartas and State Secretary Edi Sudrajat. The following were discussed:\n\n*Basofi and Matori reported that the PKPI and PPP’s respective preparations to submit a list of DPR candidates to the KPU have reached its advanced stage. All agreed that there was no need to share the list of candidates to maintain confidentiality.\n\n*On the 2002 Legislative Elections itself, there was an agreement that the PKPI and PPP should compete freely against each other. Wahono chimed that competing freely against each other does not mean campaigning and badmouthing one another. The President agreed and asked Basofi and Matori to sign an agreement to this effect with each other.\n\n*Abdurrahman Wahid and Amien Rais said that as there are NU and Muhammadiyah members in both PKPI and PPP, they will direct followers to vote for one of the two parties as they see fit.\n\n*The situation got tense when Harmoko asked two questions. First he asked whether or not the PKPI and PPP would still be in a coalition after the election. Matori said that it would because the PPP’s committed to supporting the President until the end of his term in March 2003. Harmoko then innocently suggested that the PKPI and PPP jointly nominate a chairman of the DPR/MPR for the next term of the DPR/MPR. Matori tensed at that, the mumbling that since the coaition’s support was for the President, it wouldn’t matter who the Chairman of the DPR/MPR would be next term. The situation only calmed down when Wahid said to let events play themselves out and saying that who the next Chairman of the DPR/MPR would be will be clearer after the 2002 Legislative Elections.\n\nOn that note the meeting ended. When all the coalition members fronted the media, Harmoko was once again the spokesman cheerfully saying that the Pancasila Coalition remained strong and united. In his office, with the television in the background, the President had his private meeting with Harsudiono.\n\n“I think Harmoko just realized he’s not alone in his ambitions for the chairmanship of the DPR/MPR”, said Edi with a chuckle.\n\n“And there’s still the candidates for the chairmanship from the PKPB and PNI”, began Harsudiono “Though somehow I think the chairwomen of the PKPB and PNI are interested in something greater than being Chairman of the DPR/MPR.”\n\n“Yeah, yeah, I know”, said Try holding up a folder “In the mean time, you two should stick around. Basofi’s got some homework for me.”\n\n“What’s that?” asked Edi.\n\n“It’s the list of DPR candidates the PKPI wants to submit to the KPU”, said Try “I’m the party leader so I have to review it.”\n\n3rd September 2001:\n\nThe Presidential Airplane touched down at Manado, North Sulawesi in the morning. After being welcomed by Governor of North Sulawesi EE Mangindaan, the President jumped in a car. Some 90 minutes later they arrived at Lahendong.\n\nHere, accompanied by Minister of Mining and Energy Djiteng Marsudi and Minister of Transportation Soerjadi Soedirja, Minister of Religion Quraish Shihab, Edi Sudrajat, and Mangindaan the President inaugurated the following:\n\n*Units 1 and 2 of the Lahendong Geothermal Electricity Generator\n\n*The North Sulawesi Transmission Line and Sub-Station\n\n*The Sam Ratulangi International Airport in Manado\n\n*The Ekayana Buddhist Pagoda in Tomohon\n\nIn his speech, the President congratulated the people of North Sulawesi on their determination to “make their mark” on national development. After a short ceremony, the President toured the facilities shaking hands with the employees there and learning about how the electricity generator was to work.\n\nFrom there, the President and his entourage headed for Bitung. The State Minister of Development of Eastern Indonesia and Special Economic Zones Jusuf Kalla acted as the tour guide here. Kalla explained that the two major infrastructure projects underway here are the Manado-Bitung Toll Road and the expansion of Bitung Harbour. It was quite late in the day when the President returned to Manado and that was where he spent the night.\n\n4th September 2001:\n\nTry and his entourage flew early in the morning and landed in Bengkulu, Bengkulu where they were welcomed by Governor of Bengkulu Afifuddin Thaib. Together the President toured the parts of Bengkulu which had been damaged by an earthquake which had occurred 15 months prior but which had been rehabilitated by the Government. Accompanied by Minister of Social Affairs Meutia Hatta, State Minister of Urban Development Giri Suseno and Head of BNPB Yusman Yutam, the President toured houses and schools which were previously torn down but which had been reconstructed by the government. Giri Suseno reported that the opportunity for rehabilitation has been used to build new footpaths in Bengkulu.\n\nThere were faint “Mega! Mega!” chants from people that officials successfully prevented from getting close to the President though the President himself was more struck by how familiar Meutia was with the locals, some of whom she was referring to by name. When the President talked to locals they all said that all was thanks to Meutia’s hard work. The President experienced déjà vu because this was exactly the reaction to Meutia last year when he visited Bengkulu.\n\nWalking beside the President, Thaib said that people in Bengkulu were most touched that Meutia spent some months living in Bengkulu in a budget hotel and that even when things were already under control, Meutia would still visit Bengkulu and Enggano Island when her ministerial duties took her to Sumatra. Yutam said that Meutia was a respected leader by Government Departments and Agencies working on the disaster and its aftermath.\n\nMaking some remarks, the President said that the Government had successfully handled the reconstruction effort in Bengkulu and that this “was all due to the leadership provided by the Minister of Social Affairs Meutia Hatta”. A loud cheer greeted the mention of her name both from officials and the public alike.\n\nFilled with overwhelming endorsements for Meutia, the President returned to Jakarta.\n\n5th September 2001:\n\nAt a lunch hosted by Chairman of the Indonesian Wood Panel Association (APKINDO) Bob Hasan, Chairwoman of PKPB Tutut Soeharto spoke out about the plight of forest concession holders. Tutut said that forest concession holders produce exports that add to the nation’s foreign currency but are treated shabbily by the government. She made mention that 13 forest concessions covering 1.36 million hectares expired in March 2000 but the extension process has stalled. Tutut asks whether this was how the government intends to provide good service to domestic investors.\n\nThe President and Chief of BAKIN Ari Sudewo had a meeting. The latter briefed the President that there is little to no intelligence chatter inside the country as far as possible threats to Indonesia were concerned but that whatever chatter there was pointed once again to something about to occur overseas probably involving airplanes. Try said that he’ll get the Department of Transportation to draw something up about airline security but other than he’s not sure what he could do.\n\n“It’s not that I’m not taking it seriously”, said Try “It’s just that I can’t imagine this flying under the White House’s radar.”\n\n6th September 2001:\n\nABRI Headquarters issued a statement saying that Commander of ABRI Wiranto had received approval from the President for a command shuffle brought about by Agus Wirahadikusumah’s death. The shuffle included the following highlights:\n\n*Lt. Gen. Djamari Chaniago is appointed to the ABRI Chief of Socio-Political Affairs’ Staff position left vacant by Agus Wirahadikusumah.\n\n*Lt. Gen. Endriartono Sutarto, currently Inspector General of ABRI, is appointed Deputy Army Chief of Staff.\n\n*Maj. Gen. Ryamizard Ryacudu is promoted from ABRI Assistant of Planning to Inspector General of ABRI position left by Endriartono. He is promoted to lieutenant general. Maj. Gen. Romulo Simbolon, previously Assistant of Socio-Political Affairs succeeds him.\n\n*Brig. Gen. Iwan Sulandjana, currently second-in-command at the East Java Regional Military Command is appointed Commander of the West Java Regional Military Command and promoted to major general. He is a classmate of Commander of Kostrad TB Hasanuddin.\n\n*From a political standpoint, Wiranto strengthens his position by having a close ally (Djamari) appointed to the ABRI Chief of Socio-Political Affairs’ Staff position and another associate (Romulo Simbolon) in the Assistant of Planning’s position.\n\n*ABRI Chief of General Staff Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono remains unaffected but there is agreement within his circle that his 1973 Classmates fared badly. Placed in staff positions in ABRI Headquarters and/or dead-end assignments, there is a sense that “the decks are being cleared for those who will come after us”.\n\n*The Class of 1974 fared the best. The regional military commands of West Java, Central Java, and East Java along with Kostrad and Kopassus now belong to this class. Staff positions in the Army Headquarters are now largely manned by the Class of 1974. This is in part to strengthen the hands of Ryamizard Ryacudu and TB Hasanuddin, who are seen to be the President’s favorites, but also to counter the Prabowo Subianto’s lingering influence, Prabowo being a member of the Class of 1974.\n\n*The pairing of Luhut Panjaitan and Endriartono Sutarto as Army Chief of Staff and Deputy Army Chief of Staff also means the top two positions in the Army are held by those hostile to Prabowo.\n\n*The promotion of Ryamizard Ryacudu to lieutenant general officially places the President’s son-in-law as a contender for the Army Chief of Staff’s position when Luhut hits retirement age. Luhut has been Army Chief of Staff since August 2000 and will hit retirement age in September 2002.\n\n7th September 2001:\n\nThe President had a meeting with Minister of Public Works Rachmat Witoelar, Meutia Hatta and Junior Minister of Housing Bobby Suhardiman. The President approved of an MoU signed by the three ministers mandating that apartment buildings, shopping centers, and office buildings have facilities to make it accessible to less mobile visitors such as the elderly and the handicapped (wheelchair ramps, toilets for the wheelchair). Bobby reported that newer buildings will have these facilities available but that older buildings will be given time to transition with the new policy.\n\nAfter the three ministers made the announcement of their meeting, Meutia was asked by Edi Sudrajat to come back to the President’s office because he would like to meet privately. The President praised Meutia about what great work she was doing at Bengkulu before asking her if she would like to run for a DPR seat in Bengkulu before the election. Meutia smiled when Try made this offer.\n\n“Mr. President, I think you want to deploy me against Mbak Mega”, said Meutia making Try smirk “I think I’ve visited Bengkulu enough to know that Mbak Mega PNI is popular there. Must be the fact that Mrs. Fatmawati is from there.”\n\nTry said that he just wanted the PKPI to have a better chance of winning in Bengkulu. Meutia says that she’s willing to be placed wherever duty calls but asks whether it was better for the Government if she were to remain minister.\n\n“It would be good for the Government for the next 18 months but now we need to start laying the foundations for the next 5 years”, said Try “That starts with how well the PKPI does in the 2002 Elections.”\n\nMeutia nodded her head and thought about it carefully.\n\n“I will accept, Mr. President but only on one condition”, she began “President Soeharto made in a habit to have his ministers registered as DPR candidates so they could campaign and attract votes for Golkar but then when Golkar does well, these ministers remained in their positions instead of taking up their DPR seats. I would like to ask your permission that if all turned out well that I would be allowed to take up my seat in the DPR.”\n\n“Done”, said Try.\n\n10th September 2001:\n\nIn a morning press conference at the PKPI’s National Headquarters, Basofi Sudirman and Secretary of PKPI Joyokusumo said that the President, in his capacity as party leader, has given approval to the PKPI’s list of DPR candidates to be submitted to the KPU. Basofi said that they will hand the list of candidates on the 15th September along with the other parties.\n\nElsewhere, at the Presidential Palace, President Try welcomed the arrival of General Secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP) Nong Duc Manh. As per the President’s instructions, although “merely” a party leader, he was given a welcome equal to that of a head of state. Manh indeed came with a small delegation comprising of only staffers though being party leader in a one-party state made him the most powerful man in Vietnam. Try invited just Minister of Foreign Affairs Ginandjar Kartasasmita to sit in the meetings to keep his delegation small.\n\nWhen they began their talks, Try and Manh immediately agreed on the big issues. Manh said that China’s attempt to intervene with the VCP National Congress is a sign that China has “designs” on the Southeast Asian region. He told Try that even though Vietnam and China had a common ideology, Vietnam always suspected China’s intentions towards it. Try agreed and said that not only Vietnam, but the rest of Southeast Asia should be free of Chinese and other political influence by “non-ASEAN powers”. Try explained his concept of ASEAN member nations acting collectively in foreign affairs so as to maintain an independent position but that this is contingent on ASEAN member nations not being influenced by “non-ASEAN powers”. Manh agreed that if ASEAN members came under the influence of “non-ASEAN powers” that this was the same as giving them a veto on ASEAN’s agenda.\n\nMoving on to another topic, Manh said that the Russians have a 25-year lease on Cam Ranh Naval Base which is scheduled to run out in 2004. It was the desire of Vietnam that the lease not be continued, argued Manh, so that it can maintain an independent position on foreign affairs without Russian presence within its borders. Try supported this and saying that other ASEAN nations should support Vietnam’s position, said that Vietnam should bring up the matter at the next ASEAN Summit.\n\nAt their press conference, the two nations were effusive of one another. Try congratulated Manh on his election as general secretary calling it a victory against “those trying to intervene in the internal affairs of a nation”. Manh was equally effusive saying that Indonesia was a nation that has the strength to be decisive in the region.\n\n11th September 2001:\n\nNong Duc Manh held talks first with Vice President JB Sumarlin and then with Chairman of DPR Harmoko. Manh, who was formerly Chairman of Vietnam’s National Assembly, was enthusiastic to meet Harmoko again.\n\nAt their joint press conference, Harmoko dealt with questions about rumors that he will be running for re-election to the DPR in Central Java. Harmoko said he would not pre-empt the party only that he wanted to bring victory to the PKPI at the next elections.\n\nIn mid-afternoon, Manh paid his respects the tombs of the Seven Revolutionary Heroes who were murdered during the 30th September Movement Coup Attempt at the Kalibata Heroes Cemetery. Accompanied by Wiranto, Manh said delivered a speech saying Vietnam and Indonesia’s relationship transcended ideology.\n\nThat night the President and First Lady Tuti Setiawati hosted a private dinner for Manh and Mrs. Manh at the Presidential Palace.\n\nAfter dinner, the First Lady gave a tour around the Presidential Palace to Mrs. Manh. The President, Manh, and their interpreters walked further behind and continued their discussion while the ladies chatted about the palace. Manh told Try that he thought they have “broad agreement” on the strategic issues. They both agreed that further visits should be exchanged to “hammer out the details” with Manh officially inviting Try to visit Vietnam.\n\nIt was around 8.30 PM when Manh and Mrs. Manh departed back to their hotel, Try saying that he would call on them at the hotel in the morning to have breakfast together before Manh departed back to Hanoi.\n\nBack at his office, the President met with Ginandjar, State Minister of National Security Soerjadi, and Edi to review the visit. Soerjadi said Manh hit all the right notes and that there’s enough common agreement between Indonesia and Vietnam on the big issues to say that this was a success as an initial visit though obviously there was still much to build upon if Indonesia wanted a relationship on the level of Thailand and the Philippines.\n\nTry was telling Edi to identify areas where there could still be closer cooperation between the two nations when Ginandjar excused himself to take a call on his phone. Edi was saying defense and economics would be a good place to start when Ginandjar stepped back in looking like he’s struggling to process what he just heard.\n\n“Everything okay?” asked Try.\n\n“That was Ambassador Nana” Ginandjar said referring to Ambassador to the United States Nana Sutresna “He’s saying that an airplane just crashed into the World Trade Center in New York.”\n\n“What?!When?” asked Edi.\n\n“Nearly 15 minutes ago”, said Ginandjar.\n\nTry also struggled to process it as Ginandjar stepped outside again. He struggled because there is a possibility that this was…it can’t be…\n\nThe television in the room was switched on and changed to CNN and there were gasps in the room. Black smoke rose out of one of the World Trade Center towers which looked like something had crashed into it.\n\nAround Try things were moving. Soerjadi’s phone also rang and he left the room to take it. Then Edi’s phone rang. The State Secretary answered it and handed it to Try.\n\n“The Chief of BAKIN for you, Mr. President”, said Edi.\n\nTry had hoped it was the Minister of Transportation wanting to report of a freak aviation accident in New York. But this was the Chief of BAKIN and that could only mean one thing.\n\n“Don’t tell me those are the guys taking the flying lessons ”, began Try.\n\n“We don’t know who exactly flew that aircraft, how many they’ve hijacked, and what else they’re going to do, Mr. President”, said Ari “But this is it, this is them.”\n\n“I see”, said Try “Come here as quickly as you can.”\n\n“I’m already on my way there, Mr. President”, said Ari.\n\nTry handed the phone to Edi. He massaged his forehead and then began giving instructions.\n\n“I want you to summon the Vice President, the Minister of Home Affairs, the Minister of Defense and Security, the Minister of…” said Try but then he trailed off when he saw what was on the television screen “Wait a minute…that’s…my God, that airplane just hit the other tower!”\n\n---\n\nSo Try is in the midst of doing something that Soeharto used to do with Golkar in the run-up to an election, namely review the list of candidates and give his approval/disapproval when and as necessary.\n\nThe number of 1.36 million hectares of forest concessions with extension process which has stalled is based on https://jawawa.id/newsitem/government-revokes-vast-forest-concessions-1447893297\n\nI forgot where I read it but the reason why communist leaders always double on a party and government position (Ie. Stalin was Premier of the USSR at one stage) is so that they can travel overseas and receive a welcome as a state official instead of merely being a party official. This is what I wanted to convey when I said that Try wanted Manh to be given a welcome equal to that of a Head of State.\n\nAnd yes, we’re finally at that world changing event, folks."
