        "text": "Ethnic and religious clashes have killed more than 20 people in the past two days in eastern Indonesia, local media reported Wednesday, just one month after more than 100 people were killed in rioting in the island chain of Ambon.\n\nIn a bid to quell further unrest, the Indonesian military has issued shoot-on-sight orders and threatened to court-martial soldiers disobeying the command. After massive riots last month in Ambon, the military mobilized thousands of soldiers to riot-prone areas, but failed to contain two consecutive days of ethnic and religious violence in the provinces of West Kalimantan and Ambon.\n\nAt least 3 people in Ambon were shot and killed when soldiers fired upon mobs to disperse them, The Associated Press reported Wednesday. Last week, police officials in Ambon confirmed that soldiers mistakenly fired into a crowd fleeing toward military barracks after an explosion in a residential area. A nun was shot through the neck in the incident.\n\nBy Wednesday morning, relative calm had been restored in Kalimantan between feuding Malays and migrants from the island of Madura, but rival Christian and Muslim groups in the province of Ambon continued to patrol the streets armed with machetes, homemade explosives and bows."
