The Indonesian army has a young turk, a 49-year-old enfant terrible, Major-General Agus Wirahadikusumah, who made life hell for his former boss General Wiranto in the period leading up to his removal last week.

While President Abdurrahman Wahid was sharpening his knives in the presidential palace, Wirahadikusumah, the army's foremost reformer, kept up a scathing public commentary on the failings of the army in general and those of Wiranto and his followers in particular. It drove Wiranto spare and was hugely diverting for Indonesians, who were treated to the hitherto unknown spectacle of a public feud between generals.
