Forum members,

I recently came across the Flier ESC website and it looks close to the Alienpower esc. Not sure if they are the same or have similar production designs. The dual version is sold for $168 plus shipping. Did anybody tried this ESC?

Thanks.

Édit: this one?

regarding the specs below, it's seems impressive : 22s x 400A = 22 x 4.2 x 400 = 37kW

I did not know they also sell "E-bike" esc

They might! be similiar to the 400A Esc offered by Alien Power Systems.

There is a thread somewhere in which LFP tested the Alien ESC up to 100A before explosion.

edit_ found it here -> http://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=44897

(no info in the middle just pissed of people)

Yes, the first one. 12S with 150A dual....

Is it going to work for a mountain board? Or what application did you used it for?

Come on, guys, isn't it a common knowledge already, that Bruno gets his escs and motors from chinese factories? I mean, he claims to be involved in the process, but it was never stated to what extent.

I even recall seeing a "revealing" topic about a year ago on this very forum...

Funny thing, i was trying to contact Flier guys about buying those dual escs, but they refused to send me samples, and then removed the listing completely. Wondering why they put it on show again now...

I haven't used it personnaly (I am happy with hobbywing ezrun 6s 150A ESC)

since there seem to be close similarities between this esc and the alien's one - if I had the cash - I would give it a try despite the risk to be limited to tune it.

All my ESC are created by Flier and customized to perform well on a skateboard. I suspect that's what Alien is doing as well. They are really good and stay cool even under extended braking. The USB tuning is also super easy to use.

I as well use Flier (Twin 8s 120amp) but my ESC does get hot just from riding sometime on pavement with slight inclines and declines. But they are very easy to program. I was actually going to ask Bruno if I can use his software on their ESC?

@Voodoojar - What firmware are you using?

@Bshady - Yes, you can use their software with the ESC. They are the same.

Nice!! I'm guessing Bruno's software will be better as he spent many hours on it.

Nice find, is there other vendors or is this the one people have successfully purchased from?
