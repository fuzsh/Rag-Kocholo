FMS Avanti 90mm EDF Jet PNP Price :438(USD)

This 3D version of the Freewing Grey Camo SU-35 has more thrust (3000g) than the regular version. The ESC has now been upgraded to dual 60A Hobbywing ESC as of July 2013. The size of the Freewing SU-35 is an amazing site to behold. This plane is one of the largest, most sophisticated, foam EDF jets made. Whether you like scale flight or outlandish maneuvers, the Freewing SU-35 can do it all. We think the Freewing SU-35 is one of the most entertaining EDF jets out there. The specs alone are amazing. The SU-35 is built from EPS foam and has nylon hinged control surfaces, shock absorbing landing gear, dual motors, dual ESC, dual 70mm EDF fans, and runs on a 6 cell LiPo battery. We are not sure what else to ask for in an EDF jet.

NOTE: Our SU-35 comes with a single XT-150 connector wired to both ESC. We also have the XT-150 connector on our 6S 5000mAh 50C Lipo which works well in this plane and we have XT-150 charger leads to make things easy. The XT-150 is the best connector for this high powered EDF.
