This is a high performance product, not a stock replacement part intended for a specific vehicle. As such, you will need to find your own system limits for each system. Happy tuning! The TorqueMaster BR Mini Dual is the shrunken version of the BR-XL with two ESCs stacked into one small package. Perfect for weight conscious crawlers, off road trucks, robotics, servomotor and winch use. It has been designed from scratch to meet the rigorous demands of low speed control and high torque density.

Please be sure to order a Castle 10A BEC if you would like one soldered along with your ESC. BEC power leads are soldered with the ESC power leads at the PCB or at the battery plug. If you select waterproofing for the ESC, the BEC will be waterproofed as well. Be aware Castle Creations Warranty is voided when BECs are waterproofed.
