Hey Guys,

I'm new to the crawling thing but not new to RC. All of the available options that go along with the Crawlers has re-sparked the RC bug.

So here it is, I have a XR10 on the way in the mail and am still debating using the punk dig or shelling out for the extra FXR. I'm still not sure what the benefit of the Dual esc set up is over the Punk dig.

Can someone explain the pros and cons of each set up? If it matters, I am going to be running a Futaba 3PKs.

I appreciate any help and apologise if this is in the wrong area.

Thanks

welcome to the crawling side of things. i have a punk and i like it, but i just got a 4pks when i get duel esc's. i dont know a lot about them but you can control the motor speed's seperate. i dont know if your radio will work with duel esc's. im sure somebody will help you a litte better than i can.

Im in this pickle also. The only thing that is making me go with the dig is that i already have a dxr3 and i dont want to buya 4ch radio

You don't need a 4 channel radio to run dual ESC's, the Futaba 3PKS can do it.

Now for the DX3R you can't but if you get Losikid's mix adapter you can and have proportional motor control too. I used one with my DX3R and it worked great but I got a Futaba 4PL later on.

I still have the mixer.

go for dual esc's,

if you have a 4pks or 4pl you can turn your rear esc down so that the rear doesnt drive under your front on steeeeep climbs, and when going down hill you can let the rear roll just a little instead of a dead lock

also you can get rid of the clod stall altogether

i only have a punk dig also but if the wallet would spit out the money for a 4pks i would have one just for the tuneability

this is all just my opinion though and i'm no expert"thumbsup"

+1 on the LosiKid WantAmix adaptor. I used to run a single ESC with a servo dig on my rig using a Futaba 3PM-x. Later I went to the WantAmix and dual ESC's.

While either route will work (on a 3ch radio), the options you have with dual ESC's is worth it."thumbsup""thumbsup"

There will varying opinions on what the best set up is, it really all depends on your budget and what gear you have currently that you want to use. Last year I had a dx3e when I built my first xr. Dual esc's were not really in the budget so I ran a castle sv2 esc and a punk. It worked fine. I got rid of that rig and I just built another xr. This time I went duals, castle micro sidewinders and a futaba 4pl. It was in the budget this year, and I am very happy with the set up. These esc's are super small. The rx and esc's is all thats in the stock xr chassis, no rx box or batt tray. Because of the size of this type of electronics setup the performance of the truck can really benefit from a weight placement point of view, not to mention the real benefit the duals give you, dialing out stall, overdriving front up steep climbs, etc. Good luck man.

Thanks for the welcome and the replys.

So if I'm understanding this correctly, the Punk Dig just turns off the power to the rear where the dual esc set up will allow for more proportioning. This will allow for individual control of front or rear wheel torque/speed which could help to avoid going end over end while climbing or decending.

Am I on the right path?

If my 3pks is good for the dual set up I think its the route I'm going.

Thanks

Yep that about sums it up "thumbsup"

I plan on buying a wantamix. Do i need dual esc's? Or can i just use asingle esc. And if i go the single route with a wantamix what would be the advantage of the dual esc's? "thumbsup"

Unless you were to get either dual ESC's or possibly a Novak M2 dig ESC, I don't see why you'd need a WantAmix. Either do dual ESC's or a dig unit (solid state or servo dig).

Punk dig or servo dig are used for a single ESC & dual motors. Yes, they basically shut off the power to a motor (usually shorting them so you have brake).
