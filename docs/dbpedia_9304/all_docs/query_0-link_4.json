Due to the boat loads of submissions we receive-- and the intention of not 61 E. 8th St. PMB 125 NY, NY 10003 www.lawofinertia.com I A friend and I were driving back to the city from a hippie festival in upstate New York the other day. At the festival, where such jam-band luminaries as Deep Banana Blackout, Max Creek, and Soulive played, I encountered more drugs and strung-out festival- goers than I've ever seen in my life. Even at my lowest point, the thought of ingesting something called a “mackie” or “MDMA” or liquid morphine was unthinkable. But those incorrigible hippies downed the stuff like it was water. It struck me how odd that whole subculture is and how I never ever could have related to it during my formative years when I got into punk rock. Nonetheless, the music— which was often described as “dank” by the hippies in attendance— would never be found on mainstream radio or MTV. Much of it was far too cheesey, far too arcane, and far too loosely held together to have distinguishable pop elements or hooks. And, I really liked this idea. It dawned on me that both punk rockers and hippies were in essence patronizing subcultures that were a bit too scary and unmarketable to ever reside in middle America. In our own ways we break the rules of convention and refuse to give in to what they insist on feeding us. I was happy about this. But I digress. On the aforementioned ride home to Manhattan, my friend and I decided that we hated it when people complained that there is no good music anymore. We hate it when people say that all the interesting sounds have already been made and all the important statements have already been stated. This is a cop-out. It’s like saying there are no good artists anymore— there are good artists out there, plenty of them, but you just can’t expect to find out about them if you’re sitting on your couch all day long playing Playstation. This seems to me to be an essential point to underground literature and how the magazine you hold in your hand fits into that framework. There are tons of great bands out there playing many varied styles of music. Just because it doesn't make it to the jukebox of your favorite local bar or onto the playlist of your chosen college radio station does not mean that there isn’t really good music lying just below the surface. Do you have the energy to dig down and find it? Honestly, I’m not sure if I do anymore. When surveying the floor of my 8 x 20 room, I see Law of Inertia debris littering the expanse. I have a pile of un-cashed checks right under my foot, a newspaper with a publicist’s address scribbled upon it, millions of CDs waiting for review consideration, tape recorders, zip discs, guitars, zines, etc. Sometimes, like right now, I just don’t have the energy to dig below the surface and seek out new music or art or entertainment. At times like this it's easier to simply throw on my old Bad Brains or Nirvana CDs and allow them to lull me into a state of calm, rather than nod off to the prosaic blast beats of the hippest metal band under the sun. It takes a lot of work to seek out alternative culture, even something as minor as listening to the CD sitting right underneath my laundry. And, after countless arguments with Jonah, scores of late-night hours spent ruining my eyesight in front of my computer, and yes, many many bad punk CDs spun on my stereo, I am ready to close the book on another issue of Law of Inertia and move on with my life. I really don’t know where the next few months will take me or this company. I just received my master’s degree, I am unemployed, and the world is my oyster. All I can say is that I feel more passionately about Law of Inertia than I do any other endeavor in my life. I’m not sure what will become of this magazine— world domination and a quick death or two very very viable options at this point— but I can say that it’s been an interesting ride. I hope you’ll continue to ride with us a bit longer. Fondly, Ross Siegel This issue is dedicated to the memory of Rita Holman, a woman who loved me so much she kept every single edition. It’s a pretty strange feeling— knowing that in nine hours you’re not going to have a place to live. Don't worry, I’m not going to be out on the streets or anything. My lease just runs out at noon and in addition to mopping the kitchen and throwing my bags in the car, it's also time to wrap up another action-packed issue of LOI. I know we say this every issue, but for a while I really didn't think that #11 ever going to make it to the printer. When the school year began, I thought that my last semester of college was going to a breeze: endless parties, weekly orgies, and a laughable course load. Boy, was I wrong. I feel like I can speak for Ross as well as myself when I say that this was one of the most trying eight month periods of my life. My classes took me everywhere from filming a School of the Americas protest in Ft. Benning, Georgia, to sitting in front of a Pro Tools station mouseclicking my own original music into the score for a short film. Oh yeah, I also did some writing here and there. Some of you may already know this, but in addition to my work with LOI, I also write for Alternative Press and have (or, I guess had) a weekly music column in Ithaca, NY’s local weekly newspaper. What this boils down to is that this semester, I talked to strangers in bands more than most of my friends— and that’s okay. Right now, all of my friends are out at a party while I’m at home, frantically trying to wrap up the latest issue of this zine— and that’s okay too. It’s okay, because no matter how much sleep deprivation I’ve suffered in the last six months, there is nothing I’d rather do than write down my feelings and have strangers all over the country read and possibly relate to them. It makes everything else seem trivial. This summer, I’ll be traveling on the Warped Tour (cue to start chanting the word “sell out”), working a booth and hopefully doing some writing. After that, who knows? What I do know is that aside from gaining our respective degrees this month, Ross and I poured our fucking hearts and souls into this issue. I drove to Cleveland to conduct a terrible interview that never went to press, spent countless nights eschewing studying to get in a few extra record reviews, and transcribed so many interviews that I thought carpal tunnel was going to end it all. But I’m still here, and instead of merely a diploma, I have over 170 pages of top-notch journalism to show for my efforts. I know what you’re thinking, “Will there be another issue of LOI now that you guys are out of school?” The answer is, I don’t know... but I wouldn’t be surprised. We may start producing them less frequently, but LOI is such a big part of our lives, I don’t know what we’d do without it - aside from have more healthy social lives (speaking of my social life, to read all about it check out my column). Anyway, I gotta go. There are mysterious stains all over our carpet that I’ve been spraying with Resolve every half-hour and it’s time for the next session. Thanks so much for taking the time to read this and keep turning the pages - it just gets better from here on out. | Law of Inertia Magazine: breaking your guitar strings, slashing your van’s tires; random debauchery.

THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS Calvin http://calvin_stemley.tripod.com/houseofsoul/index.html Dear Calvin, Thank you so much for your kind e-mail to make us aware of your band. It gives me nothing but pleasure to have a very wide variety of music covered in Law of Inertia and I am so happy that you directed me to your website. I must admit, I thought you were kidding when you told me your band was called House of Soul as it bares a striking resemblence to the famous nightspot, the House of Blues. But, when I checked out your site I realized that not only were you serious, but you think LOI needs to cover more music a la Otis Redding (or Lionel Richie as the samples of your music would have it) than Shai Hulud, so maybe in future issues we could do an interview or something. I would definitely like to ask you how it would feel to be the only band ever to appear in the pages of our humble magazine that wears white tuxedos to every show. Fur- thermore, I’d love to chat about the fact that a whopping four of you have surnames that are actually real words (e.g. Carl King, Joy Brown, Wayne Barber, and Keith Flowers) instead of something like Jones or Johnson, which don’t mean anything. Lastly, I was convinced that your failure to put the word “the” before “slammin” was a mistake but then I realized that your CD really is caled Slammin CD. What a clever title! So, anyways Calvin, we obviously have lots to talk about. Gimme a ring on my celly and please let me know when you’re going to be in town. GOD BLESS YOU TOO MY FRIEND! Law of Inertia Ross, I just saw the copy of your new issue that Thursday had *on tour with them. It is seriously the most amazing zine ever! All of our favorite bands: Tenacious D, Rocket From the Crypt, Rival Schools, Fucking Champs, Q and not U, are you kidding?! Incredible! Thanks again. It’s a book, so I still haven’t finished it. It’s being passed from van to van! xxoo Bob Nanna Bob, Thanks so much, that’s so nice of you! It almost makes me feel bad that we didn’t like your new record more (it’s not bad at all, just wasn’t as good as Braid’s last stuff). Anyways, yes, we’ve had a fantastic response to the new issue, and pretty much every person I give the zine to at shows mentions something about issue #10 being a book. We always knew we had a good zine-- our egos are pretty formidable-- but the things people have been saying about our zine over the last few issues blows our mind. So thank you so much for reading and being a part of this, ooxx, Law of Inertia Ross, Your magazine is AMAZING. I am more than thrilled to receive such an incredible piece of work. QUINTUPLE KUDOS TO YOU. I am doing a Leif Garrett interview in an hour -- want it for your next issue? _wal _wal, Thanks so much for the kind words! It is good to hear from a guy who obviously thinks big and writes bigger. You should talk to my man Calvin over there in the upper- left corner of this page— you guys both love capitalizing your hyperbole. Anyways, as for a Leif Garrett interview, that’s so sweet of you but I’m gonna have to pass. When it comes to washed up teen icons we much prefer Slash, Sebastian Bach (who we may be interviewing soon), and any of the older punk bands on Hopeless Records. But thanks for the offer. Jawofinertia Law of Inertia, Yes, I’m a big fan of your publication. But, I was wondering how you could possibly employ a co-editor who apparently has such poor faith in Revelation by prematurely rejecting the latest sensefield album, Tonight and Forever. In fact, I heard Jonah refer to this album as “the worst album of the year.” That is some bullshit. I think he should be fired. Sensefield is a quality band, they deserve your support. Jonah: Maybe you should give the album another try. It just may be the case that it’s brilliance was too subtly intense for your cheap fast-food tastes. GNR is small fries, dude. Sensefield is a supersized meal deal. You might have to wait a little longer, but they will fill you up with love darlin. only love, mz.liz. Lizzie, Urn, what do you think? Should I fire him over a comment he made about Sensefield? Well, if so, I’d have to fire myself because that album was very poor indeed. If you think Jonah’s claim about that album is bad, check this out: Ross says that the new Sensefield album is so poorly mixed, he could have a done a better job if he had mixed it on a Speak-and-Spell. And that is coming from somone who kept their EP on Grape OS in his stereo for over a year straight. Thanks Lizzie, Law of the Land To LOI, I’m writing to you guys from Perth, Australia and would like to tell you that I think your zine is fucking excellent. I absolutely love the american punk-rock scene, and must admit that whatever we have of punk here, is very soft-core. The bands that I am into... well they don’t even sell ‘em in CD stores here at all, so I’ve turned into a bit of a geek with the internet shopping, hehe thank god for the internet! I would love to subscribe to ur zine (please tell me that #10 is not the last issue!!!) but unfortunately I live outta the states and across the globe. So that makes it kinda hard. Is there any possible way I could subscribe? I would also like to ask if you could let me know if and when there are any acts coming over to Oz. I cant wait till I have enough money to come and visit the states, now that’s a trip worth waitin’ for. I want to thank you for a great read, it seriously is one of the best zines I have ever read, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I hope there is more to come, please mail me back.. Karina:) Karina, Wow, thanks for the kind words. I think you’re the first person to write us from Australia. It is so nice to know that people in “Oz” read our zine even if some of our best friends here in the US would sooner read their high school math text-books then finish one of our humble issues. Anyway, If you’re reading this response then it is safe to say that there is more to come. We hope this is the best issue yet. We think it is. Jonah and I have worked out asses off to make this issue not only memorable but a milestone in our zine careers as well. So, please enjoy it and tell all your friends in Oz about punk and about how Law of Inertia (dis)affects punk here in the States. Thanks!

I usually write about my sex life or how I hate working at dumb jobs or some other self-centered flight of fancy. But it’s my column and I’m supposed to voice an opinion so I do. However, after September 11 th , my news-mining personality has been reinvigorated. A political side I never knew I had has emerged. Thus I find myself galvanized to tell the world a few things I know that they may not. What I’d like to talk about this issue is “A few reasons why you should be mad at George Bush’s cabinet appointments.” Recently it was released that the Bush Administration has substantial evidence of an imminent attack by Osama bin Laden on American soil in the days leading up to that September day. It suddenly occurred to me that the Bush Administration— for all their current fame and public support in a time of war— has had a rocky road for the past year and a half. I decided to look into the matter and investigate what else there was to criticize in Bush’s cabinet. I found a whole lot of juicy stuff, some of which is below. Read on, you may just find out that not only are the members of the Bush cabinet some of the most affluent people in politics, but their corporate ties are almost unfathomable and scary. Similarly, many of the top positions at the various departments within the executive wing of the US government are filled by people who fight for some very dubious policy decisions. This is scary, but a sign of the times. John Aschroft, Attorney General : John Ascroft is, in many ways, George Bush’s answer to pleas from the far right for the President to place one of their own (a very conservative Christian) in his cabinet. There were many red flags before Mr. Ashcroft’s appointment raised by Ted Kennedy indicating that the future attorney general would be a dubious choice for the highest law-enforcement post in the nation. Not only did he oppose hate-crime legislation as a senator in Missouri, but he vigorously opposed the appointment of Ronnie White, who would have been the first African- American judge on the Missouri Supreme Court; he also fought appointments to judicial and executive positions for many candidates who supported women’s, homosexual, and abortion rights; he consistently and aggressively opposed the appointment of women and other minorities to executive and judicial positions; he fought vigorously for the universal availability of guns; and he fought arduously to make abortions harder to obtain. Nonetheless his nomination was accepted and he is now the man who controls every FBI, police, and DEA investigation in the nation. Before September 11, Mr. Ashcroft seemed to have no heart in his job— often taking four-day weekends in Missouri— and no interest in developing his own agenda during his tenure. After September 11 th we have an entirely new John Ashcroft, one on a mission to transform the justice department’s goals of prosecuting the guilty and protecting the innocent to simply prosecuting everyone. It has been widely reported how Mr. Ashcroft ordered the constitutionally illegal detention of at least 1 ,200 Muslims residing within the United State’s borders with little or no basis as to their relation to terrorist activities; how he told a senate sub- committee that anyone who got in the way of his work was aiding terrorism and thus not a true American; his unprecedented restriction of the freedom of information act, giving journalists little to no access to information sources that are not supposed to be closed; and how he convinced the President to allow secret military tribunals which would allow the executions of presumed terrorists without due process of law. But, he ordered raids on marijuana clinics in California— serving cancer patients— with immense fierceness; he has reversed long standing justice department positions on affirmative action; he has taken great pains to relax restrictions on the FBI spying on religious and political organizations; and signaled a willingness to give big business breaks on anti-trust cases. John Ashcroft has his own ideas of what makes for American justice and what American ideas of equality should be. Certainly, he will go down in history as being the most aggressive, if not fascist, government employee since J. Edgar Hoover. Ashcroft’s butchery of the fourth amendment should be a disgrace to anyone the believes that all men and women are created equal and that sexual orientation or religion does not make a person automatically a suspect Finally, Ashcroft has an exceedingly poor environmental voting record and is openly hostile to most environmental laws. Ashcroft voted against additional funding for environmental programs including the Clean Water Action Plan and toxic waste cleanups at Superfund sites. He also voted for a bill to roll back clean water protections, to prevent the EPA from enforcing arsenic standards for drinking water, and to allow mining companies to dump cyanide and other mining waste on large areas of public lands next to mining sites. Karl Rove, Presidential Counselor. One could make a very convincing argument that the Clinton administration did not always act ethically, but did, however, do what they believed to be right. Such is the case with the United States involvement in Kosovo. Karl Rove, the man who engineered George W.’s political rise, is a self-proclaimed hard-liner. Take that term as you want but I see it to mean he doesn’t budge an inch on anything he feels strongly about (and thinks the President should feel strongly about.) It is common knowledge on Capitol Hill that Mr. Rove is the adminstration’s key to the GOP’s money bags. He is the one they send out on the big fund-raising missions, and similarly he is the most obvious example of a member of Bush’s cabinet who manipulates their decisions to serve its best interests. If the Clintonians tried to do what was right, Karl Rove seeks to do what will be best for the Republican party and the chief executive. George Tenet, CIA Director. As American envoy to the Israeli/Palestinian conflict George Tenet had little to no effectiveness, seeing his cease-fires repeatedly abused and American demands consistently ignored. As an intelligence gatherer he has been abysmal, his greatest failure coming just as the conflict rose to its greatest heights. Some might argue that his embarrassment over his handling of the credit of Yasir Arafat’s aide Jabril Rajoub is the worst scandal at the CIA since 1 985 when then CIA chief William J. Casey saw a fully-briefed KGB informant defect to the Soviet Union on him. In this case, Tenet had been telling his bosses in the Bush administration that Rajoub’s “office of preventative security” in the Palestinian Authority was a fully reliable proponent of the peace process. Tenet and his spooks overlooked the mortar cannons and AK-47s stashed all over Rajoub’s offices and the fact that members of Hamas were being armed by Rajoub. Only recently did Tenet realize Rajoub’s connection to Palestinian bomb-factories and the fact that Rajoub was in no way a friend to the peace process. Tenet finally had to admit that his main enforcer or civility in Gaza and the West Bank had no interest in seeing a peaceful resolve to the situation. Perhaps diligence wasn’t in the version of the job description that Mr. Tenet read. Spencer Abraham, Secretary of Energy: Despite being the only American of Arab descent in the senate, Mr. Abraham has done little to improve the nation’s power plant security. Not only have many of the nation’s key nuclear power plants been found unable to withstand an aerial assault, from a plane for instance, but security at most nuclear plants has been found to be hopelessly disorganized and ineffective. In recent semi-annual security drills at nuclear plants around the nation, 73% of energy plants not only failed in their drills but subsequent reports indicated that terrorists could easily build a small nuclear weapon made with a basic knowledge of nuclear physics and modern engineering tricks. Although the press and the senate have been blowing the whistle on power plant security for some time now, the Bush Administration and the Department of Energy have insisted that power plant security and maintenance is better than ever. This is clearly untrue and the powers that be would benefit more from improved security measures than skirting the issue. [10] [Law of Inertia] In defense of Mr. Abraham, the White House is being extremely difficult and is making his job a task indeed. On March 14, the White House chopped off over 90% of the requested funds the energy department needed to safely protect and store hazardous nuclear waste. Apparently the White House never considered that plutonium is easy to come by for terrorists when there are no funds to buy new fencing to put around dump sites (a main feature of the budget proposal). Oh yeah, Abraham proposed cutting more than $600 million from funding for solar, hydrogen, biomass, geothermal and wind energy research (“green” sources of energy), all of which faced major cuts from current levels. Abraham led the Senate’s efforts to prevent the Clinton Administration from increasing fuel economy in cars and light trucks. He co-sponsored two separate bills that would have allowed drilling for oil in the fragile Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He also voted to kill an amendment that would have added $62 million to the Energy Department’s solar and renewable energy programs from being considered by the full Senate, and he voted to delay reforming the way oil companies pay royalties for drilling public lands. Abraham also supported establishment of an above-ground “interim” nuclear waste dump near Yucca Mountain in Nevada, which the Sierra Club opposed. What is perhaps most bizarre about Mr. Abraham is that in 1999, Abraham sponsored legislation that would have abolished the Department of Energy. Gale Norton, Secretary of the Interior. Ms. Norton should have raised many red flags in congress before her appointment based on the fact that her first job in public service at the Mountain States Legal Foundation, a conservative think tank that opposes the government’s role in environmental protection— a strange job for a woman who would be in charge of much of the United States’ environmental policy. Unpopular with many environmentalists, Norton prefers free market solutions to environmental problems rather than regulation and enforcement. Working under Reagan’s Interior Secretary, James Watt, she advocated opening up the protected Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration, a method of energy development which the Bush Administration continues to explore despite reports that there is only six months worth of oil up there. Plus, the potential environmental devastation is enough to make any other Interior Secretary an embarrassment. As a matter of fact, Norton seems to be wholly pro-business and anti-environment in almost every region in America except for the Florida Everglades where the Bush Administration is fighting ardently to upkeep environmental practices. Can you guess why? The answer is that the Florida proved to be the key to the last election for Mr. Bush, it very well might be in the next so there’s no sense in alienating Floridians who voted for Ralph Nader’s environmental focus a second time around. Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense: When George Bush assigned Rumsfeld to be the director of the Pentagon he signaled that he wanted an experienced veteran of the Department of Defense to sell China, Russia, and Congress on a highly dubious missile shield that could end up costing the American people as much as $240 billion and might not even work under normal conditions. To explain why the missile shield may be impossible to build up to acceptable standards would take a crash course in modern astro-physics, but let’s just say that fooling a missile shield by hurling random objects into the sky alongside a real missile would be a piece of cake for a nation like Iran or North Korea. Plus, every time the Pentagon tests their missile shield it costs taxpayers $100 million. Despite experts at every university in the nation saying the missile shield might never work properly, the Pentagon remains enthusiastic after four successful— yet technically unrealistic— tests in a row recently. Mr. Rumsfeld appears to be leading the charge for the pro-missile shield camp. I find two other problems with his performance: 1) On orders from President Bush to refine the military and make it more versatile Rumsfeld has begun to focus his vision of what the military should be. Specifically, he and others see the days when the floating bulls-eyes known as aircraft carriers are no more, but rather super elite fighting forces like the Army Rangers, 101 st Airborne, and the 10 th Mountain divisions become super-organized, super stealthy, highly computerized, eerily efficient fighting units able to achieve maximum penetration in any climate or location in the world. Some may find the space-age weaponry (some of it sounds like the most fantastic stuff of Star Trek) and organization the future military will possess exciting, I find it scary. Now instead of battles where America fights face to face with enemies as the world watches on, the US’ fighting forces will be so secretive that wars aren’t even noticed anymore. I see this as a detriment to peace and a way of making the world a more violent place— especially if no one even knows about that violence. 2) Donald Rumsfeld should be pushing George Bush to maintain a substantial amount of military personnel in Afghanistan and surrounding regions. After the Balkan war it was US and NATO troops who assured that ethnic cleansing did not return to the region— we Americans must do the same in Afghanistan to ensure the protection and stability of a new, untested Afghani government and to hold off warlords outside of Kabul. Right now Rumsfeld isn’t pushing hard enough and the US is set to all but hand over the entire nation to the British who have no incentive to stay in the region for the longhaul. We all know the Bush administration hates the idea of nation building, but we’ve already seen what people in the middle east can do if they live in places of chaos and tumult. Let’s not see Afghanistan have to weather future storms alone! Misc. Reasons why the Bush Cabinet does not speak for the average American: • Commerce Secretary Donald Evans, a longtime friend of George W. Bush, holds 940,000 options to buy stock in Tom Brown, a Denver-based oil company that he headed before his cabinet appointment. Evans’ financial disclosure statement listed his options to be worth between $5 million and $25 million. • Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill is another extremely wealthy former CEO with a leading role in the Bush administration. The former head of aluminum maker Alcoa initially balked at selling off his $100 million in company stock and stock options, claiming he saw no potential conflict of interest. However, in an action that could directly benefit Alcoa, the Treasury Department recently decided to allow the financially pressed Bonneville Power Administration, which supplies electricity to Alcoa smelters in the Pacific Northwest, to reduce its payments to the government for dams and other infrastructure. • Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who was chief executive at the pharmaceutical company G.D. Searle and later headed General Signal Corp, has financial holdings in stocks and other investments that are worth between $50 million and $210 million, according to his financial disclosure statement. Nearly half his fortune is tied up in private investment partnerships, including venture capital funds that invest in health care, energy, the Internet and biotechnology. • Colin Powell, Bush’s secretary of state, was a former board member of America Online. His stock portfolio is worth between $18 million and $65 million. He has agreed to sell his stock in 31 companies, including holdings in General Dynamics and Brocade Communications Systems worth more than $1 million each. He is also divesting holdings in Cisco, JDS, Uniphase and EMC worth between $500,000 and $1 million. • Mitch Daniels, Bush’s director of the Office of Budget and Management, was a top executive at the pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly. He listed the value of his Lilly stock at between $5 million and $25 million. • Condoleezza Rice, Bush’s national security adviser, served on the board of directors of Chevron Oil from 1991 to 1993. The company named an oil tanker after Rice.

Just human to human, the last four years as I think I should be. Sure, I’ll miss I remember reading an old issue of Cometbus where, sick of small getting seitan subs at four in the morning, or going to talk, that quirky Aaron Cometbus decides to make a rule that no one the gorges for late night swimming sessions. But as in his house is allowed to talk about what happened to them on that far as people go, it’s not going to be as “hard to say day or the day before. Additionally, no one is allowed to ask more than goodbye to yesterday” as Boyz II Men made it sound, one question every half-hour. He thinks that this will force everyone When my ex-roommate asked me if the inevitable post- to choose their words more carefully and discuss things that really collegiate loneliness and depression had set in, I said yes. matter. It works, and he follows this by making another rule that And it has. But not for the right reasons. I can only speak you are only allowed to say twenty words when playing cards, from my own experiences, but for the most part, my college etc etc. Admittedly, this is pretty strange (and his roommates interactions have fostered purely superficial relationships, must have been from another planet to go along with it all), but After four years, I know how to wire a mixing board or why while I was reading it, I couldn’t help thinking how great it was. Jane Austen’s writing was so vital to the Enlightenment, but I I have arguably the most perfect roommate in the universe, but don’t feel like I know my friends— even those I see nearly every still, can you imagine what it would we had to pick our words day— any better. Pondering this for the last few weeks has sparingly instead of spouting off the same empty rants and posed the more haunting question, “Will these strictly surface circular arguments about what the best Modest Mouse album interactions dominate the rest of my life?” Are most of my peers is or how much we drank last night? What if instead of talking kiddie-pool shallow, or am I looking for a scapegoat to justify my about our course load we talked about why we are here, or own social shortcomings? the meaning of life, or just sat around and tried to visualize nothingness. What if we could know each other so well that Woo hoo! Party! we didn’t even need words to communicate, we just knew Remember that Bill Murray movie, Groundhog Day, what the other person was thinking? where he has to live through the same day over and over and over? I’m sure other people think about these I really like that movie. Anyway, that’s the way I felt basically every things, maybe not as neurotically as I do, but it has to be weekend this year. I didn’t join any electrical appliances in the bath or there somewhere. Of course, these issues exist in pre anything like that, but I was tempted at times. Every weekend involved and post collegiate life; I just think that my environment going to or playing a show, followed by drinking cheap beer out of a keg amplifies it. Besides, the media has socialized us to and relaxing with Ithaca’s unique brand of hippie kids who all listen to be content with drinking and being superficial, so how Pavement, but that’s another phenomenon unto itself. The actual location can we realistically expect anything more? Should of the house would change, and the brand of beer would vary slightly, but we? Like most of my peers, I only talk to two friends all in all, it was mostly the same kids, the same conversations, and the same from high school, and if this cycle continues, by the nagging feeling of unfulfillment during my drunken walks home across the end of my life I’ll only have a handful of people I Ithaca Commons. ever could have actually called friends. Consider- So what was it that we talked about? I went to what was probably ing that on a sunny walk through the Commons my last college party last night and I can’t even remember what happened. We nowadays I run into at least ten people I know, talked about The Flaming Lips or how glad we were to be done with school or the it seems like something is very wrong with that, fact that we had no work to do. But I couldn’t really identify with anyone. While I don’t you think? nodded and smiled, in the back of my head I also knew that in an hour they would be sleeping and I would be staring at my computer screen reviewing a record or transcribing an interview or responding to one of the millions of emails Ross sends me every day to keep me in check. Or I would have to write record reviews or a column for one of the other three publications I am currently juggling. It was the same during the school year; instead of going bowling or watching Vanilla Sky, I’d have to stay home and write. While I knew exactly what I was missing, and was fine with it, I couldn’t help but think that I was building some type of invisible wall between my peers and myself. But wait... isn’t the entire point of college to perfect your craft? Actually, no. Not at all Last fall, I was offered a job in Los Angeles, and briefly considered dropping out of school and moving to the west coast (luckily, I didn’t do it because the company Hey, Honey. What do you want to do tonight? This may sound antithetical, but I think that romantic relationships are the most detrimental roadblock in truly con- necting with other people. Whether you’re the one involved in the relation- ship, or you’re on the outside, for some reason we all feel the need to pair off with some person of the opposite (or same) sex, often ignoring every soon went bankrupt). At the time, one of my sage-like co-workers told me that, to him, the other person outside of our tunnel social aspects of college were just as if not more important than the academic aspects. I vision, and, more importantly, our- thought about this a lot upon my return to Ithaca, and while I may have graduated cum laude, as far as social skills go I barely had a C average. Hollywood films like Can’t Hardly Wait selves. Intrinsically, the idea of connecting on higher plane with one other person sounds like a great idea: getting to know all of their little quirks and habits and fears and embracing them or even making them a part of yourself. Spending time with them late at night in bed or early in the morning when your breath smells like old socks, but you don’t care because you don’t have anyone to impress. And, of course the whole two bodies becoming one thing is a pretty effective bonding technique that I wouldn’t mind getting some more of. But while I’m far from being a relationship expert, it seems that these moments are always fleeting. After the initial attraction and excitement, things usually deteriorate into petty arguments, mixed signals, and lying in bed alone trying to figure out where you went wrong. Like the redundant routine of a nine- to-five office job, the relationship turns into something you have to do and often becomes more work than it’s worth. I think the proof is that that 90% of the girls who I’ve dated won’t talk to me anymore, and the other 10% I don’t ever want to see again. Unless you’re soul mates or something, in the long run, a romantic relationship seems like the fastest way to ruin any chance of a long-term meaningful connection. But most of the time we don’t even get that far. There are so many rules pre-supposing the actual dating that by the time you wait the allotted amount of time before getting a girl’s number and making the initial phone call, the whole thing seems pointless. For example, I was at a party the other night and started chatting with a girl in one of my writing classes that I’d never seen outside of class before. She started telling me all these crazy stories about being a solider in Germany and traveling all over the world and even in my drunken stupor, she totally blew my mind. This was not the typical party banter. So I called her the next day while she was at work, got her home number, left a message about a gig I was playing later that week, and she didn’t show or give me a call back. So now the question is, with four days left in town, do I call her back or do I take her no-show status as a hint and never see her again for the rest of my life? Right now, it’s looking like the latter. And while I fantasize about seeing her again in some Bob Dylan “Tangled Up in Blue” type reunion when I bend down to tie the laces of my shoe, most likely I’ll never see her again. Like I said before, the people involved in the relation- ship aren’t the only ones who are harmed by our con- stant need to pair off into neat little packages. There are plenty of girls I’ve met who I felt I’ve connected with on a purely non-sexual level. Girls who I’d like to talk with or go out to eat with and discuss their lives and where they come from, or what their parents are like, or where they’re going to be in ten years when I’m a distant memory and they are living out their lives. But you can’t just call up a girl with a boyfriend at three in the morning and ask if she wants to go for a walk [14] [Law of Inertia] without them thinking that you’re expecting something in return. I’ve thought doing it, but it’s always all “What would her boyfriend think?” or “How exactly can I propose this without looking like I’m presupposing ‘booty-call’ status on these poor girls? By the time I’ve rolled it through my head enough times, I realize that it’s completely useless to even bother, and I go back to bed or go for that walk myself. But that’s not quite the same. I’m looking at the man in the mirror, oh yeah... Instead of searching for clues in collegiate shallowness or the concept of relationships (which has existed just fine for centuries), maybe I should turn the magnifying onto myself and consider that maybe the problem isn’t an external one. What have I done to try to foster more profound relationships, and if it’s not much, do I really have any right to complain about the shortcomings of my peers? As shitty as it sounds, most of the kids I associate with I don’t really want to get to know on a deeper level. I actually had this discussion the other night with a good female friend of mine who, when discussing a mutual friend, said something to the tune of (unfortunately, unlike my interviews, I don’t record my day-to-day conversations), “I’m just not too sure that there’s too much under there,” followed by profuse complements on the girl’s character to cancel out her criticism. But I’m not sure if she was right, even though I’m guilty of the same judgments. I think that there’s a deeper consciousness inside of all of us, some of us just need more coaxing to get it out. And maybe, like my friend, I’ve given up on people too easily. Maybe that’s why in a town with tens of thousands of kids my own age, I can’t think of a single person I want to hang out with. I know that I’m not the model for healthy socialization. Usually, I’m pretty shy, unless I’m drunk, and then I’m obnoxious. I have a chronic problem getting motivated to leave the house, partially because I have so much work to do, but also because there are only so many nights in a row I can go to a bar and wear my voice out trying to scream over the noise. Sometimes, I just walk past the bar and wander up and down the streets; and when people run into me they ask where I’m going and I don’t exactly have an answer, so I just sort of shrug and they give me a look like I said I just butchered a busload of small children. Most of the time, I end up standing on this bridge across town, just standing and watching the water rush underneath and for some reason it makes me feel a little bit better. If it starts raining, I just turn around and go home and watch infomercials on the 50-inch TV my roommate won on the Price is Right when we were in LA last fall. So what’s this rambling getting at? Good question. Maybe I have some type of psychological problems I need to take care off before I can expect to get inside the heads of other people. It seems pretty unrealistic that everyone else is to blame for the fact that I don’t feel like I’ve done the best I could with the last four years. Plus, like I said, the workload really prevents me from getting out of the in my subconscious, but never fully realized house all that often except for quick walks or snack breaks at the pizza shop until someone cared enough to help me explore on the corner. I mean I love doing LOI, but sometimes I feel like I identify them. with its glossy covers and offset paper more than I do with other people. Then there was this girl, we’ll call her This week has been the hardest, by far. And while I wrote off activities Bizness. Anyway, for the short time that we were like “barrel races” (where teams race to see who can finish a keg of beer together, I felt the same way I did on my talk with the fastest) as meathead wastes of time, I sort of regret the fact that I Eli (I know that this is a “diary” style column, but didn’t participate in most of my senior week activities. Even though my while we’re at, I’m not really much of a madman and roommate tried to drag me to fountain day, where all the intoxicated I don’t really feel comfortable putting the issues me seniors jump into this disgusting fountain on campus, I couldn’t help and Biz talked about in print). Along the lines of what but feel pangs of regret while everyone reminisced about how they Dave Grohl said about Courtney Love’s greed for Kurt’s would “never forget it” that night. Hell, this is the last week in my recordings, I don’t want exploit what was once beautiful, life where being an alcoholic is the status quo instead of landing All of the positive aspects of a romantic relationship I me in a twelve-step program. This monumental barrier between referred to earlier were present, at least for a few weeks, my peers and I is one that I’ll never be able to reconcile, so I’ll We didn’t really know each other at when we started never truly know the barriers I’ve around myself, consciously or dating— we’d only had a summer class together— but the two of us were discovering as we went along and again, I was learning about myself as well as another human beings. I’m not sure exactly what went wrong and I don’t really care at this point. I think part of it was my insecurity. Like Rob in High Fidelity, I became paranoid she would leave me for someone else. And eventually she left me for someone else. And I didn’t talk to her again for a very very long time. I know the High Fidelity analogies are getting tired, but once, while we were still together, subconsciously. Glimmers of Hope This isn’t to say that I’m coming out of these last four with only a piece of paper and a few notches in my bedpost. There were a few moments, especially this year, where I felt like I had conversations that were real and important. Not so oddly, these people usually turned out to be friends who had already graduated and had some sense she told me that she was like Catherine Zeta-Jones’ character ii of perspective on the whole college experience, and, more the film. She said people thought she had all of these amazing importantly, time to reflect on their own shortcomings. It opinions and things to say, but she was completely full of shit. At seems like once you get out of the college “homework- a party a few weeks back, I told her I thought she was crazy when party-repeat” cycle, it’s easier to see outside of your she’d initially told me that, but right then I completely agreed with convoluted box and think about things that maybe don’t her statement. What I didn’t tell her was that we were both frauds. I seem as important when you’re trying to figure out think that part of me wanted to sabotage the relationship because I was where the party’s at that night. getting too deep, and that made me nervous. Maybe it’s not healthy for My friend Eli and I went for a walk the us to know ourselves that well. Maybe we’re scared. Maybe she was other night. He had moved back up here recently just bored. Still, after all the bullshit, I’m glad it happened. I’m just a little to be with his girlfriend who was still in school and melancholy that now some other guy gets to experience it. he was at a proverbial crossroads as well. When And these are only two people who I’ve had successes with, there he asked me what I was going to do next fall, I are other people— my sister, my bandmates, my parents, my roommate, actually thought about it, didn’t just blow it off random people at parties or on road trips— who have sparked something like I’ve conditioned myself to do. And I think great inside of me, not necessarily sexual. It doesn’t always need to be it’s because I could tell that he really wanted to someone that you think you know; often strangers can have more insight into know, it wasn’t just rhetoric. I think that matters your character than your closest friend. But in many ways it’s a tease. . .if this a lot; you can tell if someone is actually feeling is possible with so many people, why isn’t it present with the people I interested in learning about you as a person see all time; the people it should be possible with? And more importantly, what or if they are stretching for small talk, and can I do to change this? that perception makes all the difference. Not only did our conversation help me discover a lot about Eli and help me imagine a situation that would be impossible for me to experience otherwise; but it also helped me think about some vital issues in my own life head-on because I was forced into it. I said things like “maybe I don’t want to work in the music Conclusion? The problem is that there’s no clear-cut solution to these types of issues. One thing I do know is that everyone who’s read this column as a work-in-progress seems to strongly identify with my sentiments, and that reassures me. It proves not only am I not crazy, but that we are all in the same position, struggling toward the same goals. I think that ultimately my problem is an amalgamation of issues: my insecurity, the people who I choose to surround myself with, my environment. And I know there’s not much I can do to reconcile it all before I roll out of town for good industry,” or “ I think I need to do this weekend. But that doesn’t mean I shouldn’t try. Instead of trying to make everyone something more transcendent than happy, I think we need to pick the people we think are worth really connecting with and summarizing what the new Green put in some heartfelt effort n and that’s what I’m going to do from here on out. Forget Day record sounds like,” thoughts what everyone else is doing that night. Because ultimately, that’s all this column is about that were undoubtedly hovering anyway: connecting... one person at a time. , [Law of Inertia] [15] Connecticuts' IN PIECES unveil a memorable display of modern, emotional hardcore.

Melodic, intense, and amazingly technical. Music that makes you think and dream at the same time. > Kv/! Do noi rri law of Inertia Re BfLUd . The Buzz on the Bizz Possibly the most important and shocking occurence of a respected indie establishment calling it quits is not a band, but rather a label. The rumors are true: Washington DC’s Desoto Records, home to Jawbox, Burning Airlines, the Dismemberment Plan, Shiner, and Juno have called it quits. This label will be sorely missed and leaves a need for a mid-level indie label with stringent quality standards.... Saves the Day was recently featured as the musical act on the Conan O'brien show. And, for the record, they were half as good as At the Drive-in’s Halloween appearance on the show.... Rumor has it that there are some Dillinger Escape Plan/Mike Patton colaboration recordings floating about. If anyone out there has any, we here at the LOI offices would kill for copies. Oh yeah, the band also has a new singer (sorry, it’s not Mr. patton) and I’ve been told to expect a new record shortly.... San Francisco's newest stoner-rock sensations, High on Fire, have just signed to Relapse Records. What's weird is that I would think a pot high would be the last thing one would desire at an Agoraphobic Nosebleed or Today is the Day show. But, it’s their band, they can smoke their pot wherever they want.... rumor has it that Triple Crown Records’ newest phenoms, Brand New, are being courted by every label under the sun both big and small.... Law of Inertia Records has signed an amazing pop-punk band from Chapel Hill, NC called The Scaries. Look for a new record called “Souvenir” in October... Former X | front-woman, Exene Cervenka, is back with a new band called the Original Sinners and they’re set to release a new record on Nitro (him to every early-’80s’punk-band- back-together-again in Southern California. Let's hope they’re bettter than Auntie Christ.... In Law of Inertia Records news, The Life Recording Company, owned by I Aaron Dalbec of Bane, will be putting out the vinyl version of the amazing new record “Midwest Index” by Billy Music Check it out!... Triple Crown has signed an Alabama pop-punk outfit called Northstar. They’re really good so check out a full length soon!... Saves the Day are touring with Green Day, Dillinger Escape Plan are touring with System of a Down, and The Damned are touring with Rob Zombie.... Revelation has signed a band called 32 Frames featuring Jay formerlly of Elliott.... Isis has signed with Mike Patton’s Ipecac label.... The Glassjaw has left Roadrunner and has signed with Warner Bros.... In the new Thursday video, Geoff is wearing a Grey AM T-shirt. Word has it that Victory and the band are sueing each other over Thursday's improper signing to Island/Def Jam... American Steel have broken up. They will be missed.... word has it that The Faint have signed to Dreamworks.... Triple Crown will release a side project of Andy from Hot Rod Circuit called Safety in Numbers. They are really good in a Quicksand meets Hot Rod way, if you see that one.... Nitro has signed MP3.com darings Rufio and the Lost City Angels.... No Knife's major label days are over and their next record will be with San Diego’s Better Looking Records.... Victory is really scraping the bottom of the barrel with their signings of Voodoo Glow Skulls and Ten Foot Pole.... Word has it that Epitaph has signed the Dillinger Escape Plan and the Locust.... Equal Vision has signed Time in Malta and Harley of the Cro- Mags’ new band, Harley’s War.... Fiddler Records has signed an Arizona metal band called The Bled ... Negative Progression has a new release by Denver punksters, Contender... I’ve also heard that the Blood Brothers have left GSL and signed to Artist Direct! Ross Robinson, the man behind the boards for such notable acts as At the Drive-in and Glassjaw, will produce... The Reunion Show have left Law of Inertia Records and have become the newest member of the Victory Records camp.... Hot Water Music have begun recording the follow-up to their Epitaph debut “A Flight and a Crash.”... Dan Yemin of Kid Dynamite/Lifetime fame has a new band called Paint it Black. He sings for this band that just signed to Jade Tree.... Thrice are now on a major label and have left Hopeless Records. Remember when indie rock was considered cool in the punk world?... Jade Tree will releases a 12-minute CD from Fury, a band whose members went on to form Swiz and the Monorchid.... Idle Hands and Walls of Jericho have left Trustkill and have, urn, broken up. Thus leaving only one female on the entire label’s roster.... word has it that goth-rock pop-punkers, Tsunami Bomb, have signed to Nitro, as has Rufio.... Touch and Go will re-release NYC indie-newcomers, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, debut EP... Jets to Brazil are working on a new record. ...Dashboard Confessional are recording an MTV unplugged. Punk cred is out the window when bands appear on the same shows that Eric Clapton does. Period.... Escape Artist has singed Lick Golden Sky featuring ex-members of Turmoil.... Rosstafarian Hardwired Online Stores Audio Obsessive Web Page: www.audio-obsessive.com The Goods: In this day and age of the post-internet boom it’s hard to see why anyone in their right mind would want to start a dot-com, much less the not-quite tried-and-true web music store. But, Audio Obsessive apparently felt that Lumberjack’s online store was hard to use, Interpunk was too... well... punk, and Insound was too hipster indie rock for their tastes. So, these people, associated with the Omaha label Caulfield Records, opened this store where one can find releases from acts as diverse as Jets to Brazil, the Strokes, and Good Riddance- something one would have a hard time doing on the other stores. In both look and navigability AO reminds me of the ill-fated Saul Goodman, which was run by the Crank! people in the late ‘90s, in that it tries to cater to all spectra of indie (ft rockers, not just elite indie rockers or Fat Wreck w punk kids. Some good features are the “recently Q searched for” lists where you can see what recent users have looked for. To be perfectly honest this site has no frills like Insound and really isn’t as complete as it will need to be to compete with the JQ big boys. In the future I understand there will be more contests, interviews, music news, etc, but right now what you see is what you get. Key Selling Point: The prices are better than Insound or Inerpunk for many releases. And, you won’t be able to find Poison the Well and Radiohead together on any other indie web store. Web Zines Pastepunk Web Page: www.pastepunk.com The Goods: As I tell anyone willing to listen to me rant and rave about my thoughts on media, I think most web zines aren’t worth the electrons on which they exist. Whether or not a cer- tain web publication puts little time into the quality of their writing, much less the look and feel of the site, is important, and too many web zines ignore one or the other. Pastepunk is different. While I still feel that they don’t use the medium to its fullest potential (e.g. video, audio, etc) they do a damn good job of making what is essentially a print style zine exist in an online setting. Jordan Baker, Pastepunk’s creator, clearly loves music-- he’s enthusi- astic about listening to punk and hardcore and going to shows and then writing about what he hears and sees. What is most apparent about Mr. Baker’s attitude towards his zine is that he seems to enjoy the ease of updating his site for the simple reason that he can’t wait to tell you about the time he hung out with Sick of it All or how he feels about the Ramones. Some may accuse print zines of being jaded and bitter, that they are only writing about the music and not playing it, but Jordan could care a less- he’s just so damn excited to be a part of it all. And it shows. So cruise on over to Pastepunk and check out a site that is hardly as acerbic as Buddyhead, and twice as sincere. Key Selling Point Quality writing, diverse musical cover- age, and clear nagivagbility. Music 4 Autobahns Web Page: www.music4autobahns.com The Goods: Some would say that the biggest asset a company like E-bay or Amazon has is its name. Internet analysts claim that the most valuable quality a consumer based website can have is mindshare- - or the ability to be the first place a person thinks of when considering where to buy a certain product (e.g. CD Now for music, Amazon for books, Yahoo for search engines). A name like “amazon.com” or “ebay” is catchy and very easy to remember, which can partly explain those sites’ sucess in business. Law of Inertia might not be the most easy name in the world to remember, but then again I’m told the rules are different for print and the web. With that said, I’m not sure how this site expects anyone to simply roll its name off their tongue when talking about web zines they like. However, Music 4 Autobahns is perhaps the best example of an e-zine using the web to its full potential that I’ve run across yet. Instead of long and boring interviews which people hardly want to read in print much less on a computer screen, this site is composed mostly of video interviews that are informative, cohesive, and interesting. For those lo- tech (boring) people who don’t appreciate seeing the future of web zines, and possibly zines as we know them for that matter, there are still written reviews and interviews for you to puruse. Some of the bands featured on the site are the Reunion Show, Fugazi, Coheed & Cambria, and From Autumn to Ashes. Good stuff. Key Selling Point: The only punk web zine out there that truly uses the web to its fullest potential? Yes. Misc. Manbeef Web Page: www.manbeef.com The Goods: With all this talk of vegetarianism and veganism in the hardcore scene during the past 10 years, this is bound to piss a lot of people off. Or, maybe it’s not. I mean, a cow has no choice when it enters the slaughterhouse to be made into a hamburger, but a person is autonomous and has the power to decide what happens to their body upon death. Manbeef.com has a solution: meat made of human flesh. Okay, I’m not advocating the consump- tion of human flesh, as a matter of fact I can’t even look at Ethan Hawke anymore without remembering him cutting flesh of some dead rugby player’s ass in Alive. However this site is amazing. It has a cool flash intro (play with your sound on), it has loads of tasty manbeef recipes, different type of meat cuts, and a great FAQ section in which all your questions as to the validity and legality of purchasing human meat are answered. Example- “Q: Why is human meat so expensive? A: Human meat is so expensive, because it is extremely difficult to obtain. And it is even more difficult to obtain human meat that is of exceptionally high quality. However, because human meat has a uniquely exquisite flavor, it is known world wide as a gourmet delicacy.” Just in case any of you budding psychos out there want to order a few steaks to throw on the barbie before yelling, “hey, where’s grampa?” Manbeef.com does a thorough background check before completing orders. When I e-mailed to ask what exactly this background check constituted, I received no reply. Go figure. Until then, I’m going to dream of some Manbeef stew for dinner. Y2Khai Web Page: www.y2khai.com The Goods: This is one of the strangest and most interesting sites I’ve ever seen. You really have to wonder who comes up with some of the stuff you see on the internet- like Mr. Winkle or that dancing baby from a few years ago. Y2Khai is like none other. As far as I can tell he’s an Asian immigrant to the San Fernando valley of California where he rolls around in his pimp mobile smoking blunts and doing hoes. And, while he’s at home he imposes himself and his lyrics onto the songs of Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Eminem among others. The end result is a bizarre and hilarious ride. I doubt whoever is behind Y2Khai makes any money off of it and receives little notoriety other than some porn-stars scribbling his name all over their breasts. Nonetheless, this site is very funny. Turn your volume up when you go visit the site! Twinz of Torment Web Page: http://www.twinzoftorment.net The Goods: Okay, you got me: this is a shameless plug for a site my adorable sister Lyndsay (Bugsy) and her friend Susan (Q-zen) do together to celebrate their love... er, friendship. Fortunately, they spare us the mushy details and skip right to the aspects of their lives. Susan is an aspiring San Francisco DJ who likes to spin something called Dirty South techno but will often stoop low enough to bust out an ‘“80s set.” God knows what that means, but I’m sure it’s really... emo. Lyndsay, on the other hand is a member of the upper echelons of the San Francisco drum ‘n bass scene and can often be found with her size 45 Jinkos and lollipops a’plenty on Haight Street in San Francisco or Breakbeat Science in New York City. When she’s not Xing, she likes to promote a new party she has in SF called Slow Burning. It’s cool. There are lots of pictures on the site of their lives, their music, and their favorite parts of the web. So check it out. They need all the hits they can get because they’re cute and they’re ravers, and that’s kind of a rare breed these days. Virtual Crack Rock Web Page: http://www.virtualcrack.com/ The Goods: A few years ago I got into a discussion with a member of a prominant Chicago punk band who told me he had tried crack. I had just joked about doing crack and then told the people sitting with us that crack is funny to make fun of because no one actually does crack. Apparently I was wrong. Even though this guy had gone to a presti- gious Chicago high school— where I’m guessing they don’t pass around a crack pipe at parties on a Saturday night— he claimed to have done crack more than once and had lived to tell the tale. This may not be the most PC thing for me to post to a list of cool websites, but it is damn funny. This site is pretty self-explanatory: it lets you e-mail virtual crack rocks to your friends. I think it’s good for a least a few laughts. The best part is that you don’t need your e-mail address to send virtual crack to people so feel free to get all your enemies virtually high. I think it would be even funnier if the site automatically sent its recipients virtual crack babies a few days later. Okay, I’m going to stop before I get myself into trouble. r Fat Wreck Chords Regrets: PEEPSHOW AND PEEPSHOW II NOW AVAILABLE ON ONE DVD MORE THAN 30 MUSIC VIDEOS!

Why? If you had to have your final meal tomorrow, which would you consume: a Kansas steak or a San Francisco burrito? San Fran has more people, more diversity, more music, more bookstores, more beaches, more beautiful landscape, and more optimism in general. We loved living in Lawrence but after about four or five years we felt we had seen all Lawrence had to offer. Yes, SF is better person- nallly. I’d choose an avacado and black bean burrito from El Faiiito in San Fran... [ed- agreed] How was it to be in the New York Times as one of the best bands that flew below the mainstream radar of 2001? Is it true what the writer said that you two can’t take your eyes off each other when you play? It was nice to get attention like that— I mean it’s the New York Times! Someone there obvi- ously liked the record and when anyone likes something we’ve done it feels great. We do tend to look at each other while we play. We do that at practice and at shows. It’s just how we’ve always played together. As a pop band with two instruments that are relatively hard to move, do you ever have a hard time keeping people’s attention at a show? What was the worst audience you ever had like? Audiences are all different depending on where you are in the country, what day of the week it is, etc. The worst audiences are the empty ones but even then, if the bartender has a pleasant experience listening, and we do too, then it’s a good show. Urn, I can’t remember an audience showing zero interest. I think that is pretty rare at indie/punk shows. People come for the music. What are your thoughts on the killing of Diane Whipple by the dogs of San Francis- cans, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel? Do you support the death penalty? Even if it might rid the world of two blatant psychos like Noel and Knoller? Wow, good question. I have to admit, I’m horrified at the thought of people like Noel and Knoller taking in dogs that are known killers and keeping them trapped up in a city apartment. Very stupid. And, I feel so bad for Diane and her family. It should never have happened...! can’t say I support the death penalty though. What does your band name mean? In other words, were you married when you named the band or just friends? We weren’t married yet we were much more than friends. We sat in a coffee shop one night and tried to come up with a band name that fit the idea of a team, a small team and therefore a dose knit band. Which is more fulfilling, being rockstars or being a teacher and cancer researcher- which the two of you used to call your day jobs? Teaching is very rewarding but also very draining. Both “jobs” are fufilling. We get to have unusual interactions with people. Both lifestyles promote something positive. The difference is that most of what we do now always feels natural, easier. Jason says, in answer to this questions,’ Tm not a rock star.” I wish I would have answered like that too. Do you ever get compared to Rainer Maria since you’re in the same band and you’re married, the boy/girl dual vocals, and the fact that you’re both on Polyvinyl Records? Yes. We do. We also get compared to Quasi and we really don’t care anymore. Compari- sons really bugged us at first cause we felt we were doing something completely unique (and we still do) We never owned a Rainer Maria album before playing a show with them- we just hadn’t seen them before. I thought they were a fantastic band. Very energetic. But the only similarity I found was that there is a female and a male singer both singing from their gut. If there were more bands with that element I think people would dig a little deeper. The Quasi comparison is so obvious when you consider the instrumentation. We’ve learned to just do what feels right to us. We can’t possibly write the same songs as anyone else, we’re different individuals. If we end up sounding like a band people feel they have heard before, oh well. Familiariy can be a good thing. (This interview was done by Ross with Brian Diaz, bassist and singer of The Reunion Show) If The Reunion Show breaks up will you ever get back together? Would you keep the same name or alter it? No, I think bands that change their names are ridic- ulous. Obviously it was good enough at some point, so why change it? Unless some other band has the same name. Where did the idea for your “dance contest winner” T-shirts come from? From the movie There’s Something About Mary. There is a character in the movie wearing that shirt. Do you think the fact that 3/4 of you come from ska bands affects how your music is written? In other words, do you incorporate any aspects of ska into your music? I think insofar as we don’t write any sort of ska related material. We have no intentions to either. I really don’t think it has any relevance to our music now. In your opinion, what makes the Long Island scene great/bad? What is the best band from Long island ever? What makes the Long Island scene great is that alot of the bands are really good friends and a lot of us have played in bands together. We all hang out and it’s a friendly atmosphere with a limited amount of egos. What sucks about the scene though is that there is no place to really play. Venues come and go too quick. The best bands ever from Long Island were Silent Majority and Mind Over Matter. That’s obvious! What are your thoughts on the American Taliban soldier, John Walker? Should he be tried for treason? Most definitely. He should be in prison for the rest of his life. Do you guys consider yourselves a punk band? Why? I don’t consider ourselves anything. I don’t think any band really labels themselves. People who listen to music do that to make it easier to pigeonhole the types of music they listen to, so that they can justify whether they think something is good or bad. What is the song “New Rock Revolution” about? It’s a tongue in cheek take on band who think they are doing something so new and different. We know that we’re not doing anything that hasn’t been done. The Reunion Show as a band, down to our name, is not a new idea. Anyone who thinks they have broken new ground in rock n roll is out of their minds... unless of course your first name is Paul, your last name is McCartney and you were in a band called the Beatles (or if you were in At the Drive-in). Which Bill do you prefer: Billie Joe of Green Day or Billy Joel? Why? I prefer Billy Joe of Green Day because that’s closer to what I enjoy and I probably know more Green Day songs than Billy Joel songs. I never really got into Billy Joel much to the dismay of my Long Island counterparts and my mom. The other guys in my band and their mothers may or may not take issue with this....

How do you describe yourself to relatives who have no idea about what you play? It depends. If it’s the religious side of the family I tell them I sing “light hearted rock songs with catchy melodies”. Nothing too “heavy\". The rest of my family doesn’t buy all that shit. They know what I’m up to. You are the primary song writer, have you ever experienced a lengthy period of writer’s block? What do you do about that? Yeah I get the writer’s block sometimes. I’m always coming up with ideas, but I tell myself that they all suck so they never even make it to the drawing board. I had some pretty serious block recently trying to write Gamits’ songs but I finally got over it. I was writing lots of other stuff, some mellower stuff for a side prodject, but the Gamits songs weren’t really flowing. There was a lot of “imaginary” pressure on me to come up with stuff that I tho"
