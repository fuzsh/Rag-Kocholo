        "text": "THURSDAY 2/8\n\nUNWOUND, HOCHENKEIT, LAST OF THE JUANITAS\n\n(Berbati's Pan) Hochenkeit make the kind of experimental music that sends Terrastock attendees into fits of rapture. This isn't wanking for wanking's sake, however. Their combination of groove, wail and drone actually creates a music that's at both times challenging and rump-shaking. By occasionally locking into something that could be described as \"funky,\" Hochenkeit creates the perfect sugar to help the more radical elements of their sound go down. As for the evening's headliners, well, Unwound really doesn't need an introduction. Accused of being everything from post-no wave noisemakers to math rock geeks, our friends from the Oly, WA and Portland areas just make great music--plain and simple. MURRAY CIZON See Music pg 17\n\nMISSING LINK STARRING DJ DENA, DJ JENNA, MC SYNDEL, MC OMEN, MC CHARITY\n\n(OHM) Maybe you didn't even know that one female DJ existed in Portland, let alone a huge group of girl MCs and DJs. This night is devoted to them all, with MCs Syndel, Omen, and Charity, all backed up by DJs Dena from KBOO and Jenna from the Tiger Bar. And let's face it, girl hip hoppers are better anyway for several reasons: 1) They look sexier when they're spinning, 2) There're less of them, so being a minority instantly gives them status points, and 3) They have better taste in music. So you can see why this event will be appealing to everyone, boys and girls alike. KATIA DUNN\n\nANIMOTION\n\n(Polly Esther's) \"You are an obsession.\" (drr-drr-drr-drr-DRR) \"You're my obsession.\" (drr-drr-drr-drr-DRR) \"What do you want me to do to make you sleep with me?\" We've all heard Portlanders in varying states of drunkenness sing this song at karaoke, with similarly varying levels of success. But this is the REAL, ORIGINAL Animotion, playing their first show in \"lotsa years.\" You'll hear the sexy, seductive voices of Portlander Bill Wadhams and the lady with the coolest multimedia name ever, Astrid Plane, kick out the jams like it was 1985. Hopefully, they'll be sporting their original Flock of Seagulls hairdos (and this being Polly Esther's, they probably won't get in the front door without them). Yeah, Animotion! It ain't the Human League, but it's probably the next best thing. JULIANNE SHEPHERD\n\nFULL MOON FEVER STARRING NOISE FOR PRETEND, THE HOLIDAYS, BLANKET MUSIC\n\n(Medicine Hat) With this show, we can only assume that \"full moon fever\" does not mean the howling-at-the-moon kind of fever, but something a little bit more intimate. It'll start with the bossanova-y Blanket Music, where Chad Crouch's meticulously crafted pop music will tempt you into the sort of fever that inspires Latin-flavored dancing (causing very slight beads of sweat). The Holidays, a decidedly good radio-flavored band, will croon and pop their way into your heart with their sincerity. And Noise for Pretend will tone it down, as they play glistening, sensitively jazz-influenced softness. Oh, howl at the moon if you like, silly, but if you do, it'll be because your wildest quietness has been unleashed. JS\n\nSOUTHERN CULTURE ON THE SKIDS, THE AMAZING CROWNS\n\n(Crystal) Ah, kitsch. It's hard to believe that Southern Culture on the Skids have been serving up heaping spoonfuls of hillbilly shtick for over 15 years now, but almost harder still to believe that people are still lining up to fork over good money to see it. Sure, it was originally amusing to see lowbrow \"culture\" elevated to high \"art,\" but come on, enough's enough. The joke is wearing as thin as the knees in Cousin Jasper's hand-me-down overalls. BARBARA MITCHELL\n\nPANTERA, SOULFLY, MORBID ANGEL, NOTHINGFACE\n\n(Memorial Coliseum) Thank gawd these masters of metal have not cheesed out like the rest. I still remember the day in '96 when my friend Jason and I went to the midnight madness sale to buy the new Metallica album, Load. We rushed home, smoked a big bong and nestled back in our beanbag chairs. Only... the horror of horrors came spewing forth from the speakers. We looked at each other with fear and disgust, but continued listening, sinking deeper and deeper into our pits of depression. But not Pantera, man. We still had them and God willing, we would for years to come... Go, and pay homage to the kings. KATIE SHIMER\n\nFRIDAY 2/9\n\nBERING SEA CD RELEASE STARRING JACKIE-O MOTHERFUCKER, ROLLERBALL, KAITLYN NI DONOVAN\n\n(Fez) Not only was Kaitlyn ni Donovan voted one of Portland's sexiest bartenders in the Mercury Sex Survey (check out pg 8!), but she is talented, too! She sings a light soprano like a tripped-out dove, proving that you don't have to be as ugly and un-glamorous as Neil Young to be a famous and blessed musician. Jackie O-Motherfucker and Rollerball will astonish you with their abilities to play devastatingly original and artful music, blending non-boring improv with completely beautiful and exotic melodies and influences. And it's Bering Sea's CD release party for their debut on Red76 Records! You can't go wrong. JS\n\nTHE DEAD UNKNOWN, AVALAUNCHER, ONESTEPBACK, DUALESC, IKNOWKUNGFU\n\n(x The Fallout Shelter x) For all y'all who've been wondering what's going on in The 'Couve, I'll tell you: Their under-21 hardcore scene is bitchin'. And thanks to 19-year-old Andre Sanabria (a member of Onestepback) and his dad, Vancouver will be seeing plenty more shows. They've opened x The Fallout Shelter x, an all-ages venue, in the basement of the Columbia Arts Center, and they promise to have weekly extravaganzas of hardcore, punk, indie, and hiphop. WOO! This is one of their first nights, and it's a heavy-hitter of mind-busting metal and hardcore. You should definitely check it out, because thanks to Vera Katz (who's been acting stupid and haphazard like she's the mayor of San Francisco), in about 15 minutes we're all going to have to move to The 'Couve. JS\n\nPETE KREBS BAND\n\n(Laurelthirst) Much has been said about Pete Krebs, our hometown Woodie Guthrie, but now it's my turn and I just want it on record that Mr. Krebs is a fox machine. I first saw him play when I was a blushing young teenager, and what with his tousled hair and nerd chic, I was smitten. When I learned that he was not only a tattoo artist but a Wobbly as well, I knew he was the man for me. His melodies induce involuntary physical reactions, and his lyrics leave you wishing he'd write a love song about you. If you're lucky, he'll play \"Patiently\" or \"Thunderstorms and Alcohol,\" which make you want to take to the open roads of America, and stop in every little town. MADELINE ffITCH\n\nUNWOUND, OLD TIME RELIJUN, COSMOS GROUP\n\n(Meow Meow) If you missed the drinking version of the Unwound show last night, you may be better off--for they deserve more attention than a bar could provide. Meow Meow will surely host a clean, smoke-free jamboree of screeching, moody rock this evening. An ever-so-slight morphing over quite a few years has brought Unwound to their present-day sound. Though they have always had the melodically shrill guitar on the frontline (along with Justin Trosper's vocals that sit and pout on one stubborn spot on the scale) a sort of pissed new wave has joined the equation. Bands are rarely able to progress though so many consistently good albums as Unwound, though living in a mind-numbingly boring town like Olympia may have helped. JOE FAUSTIN KELLY\n\nWAXWINGS, THE EX-HUSTLERS, RALLY BOY\n\n(Medicine Hat) The Waxwings--not to be confused with Waxwing, another band named after this weird bird that notoriously flies into the windshields of driving cars--are an unpredictable mix of indie pop and... the Beach Boys? They really do sound so surfy and sunny that there's just no other way to describe. It's kind of annoying usually, but sometimes, when they occasionally stray from the BBs enough, can be fun. KD\n\nTHE ZIGGENS, FRANK JORDAN, BARGAIN MUSIC\n\n(Satyricon) The Ziggens' version of punk is the punk of youthful exuberance, a more or less happy sound that gets people moving and enjoying themselves, rather than pissed off and surly. They have fun bantering with the audience and their music often delves into surf and country sounds for variety. I saw them once at an all-ages show and I may well have been the oldest person in a crowd of adolescents, most of whose mothers were probably waiting outside in mini-vans. But thanks to their music--and the fact that the band members are older than me--I realized that I, too, was still young. KRIS ADAMS\n\nSATURDAY 2/10\n\nTHEBROTHEREGG, JEFF LONDON, SEASIDE\n\n(Medicine Hat) Like Sparklehorse before them, thebrotheregg tap the sound of back woods and wide open pastures to conjure a form of American roots music that's never really existed. Steeped in country, folk, and rock sounds, they blend their guitars, pianos, and strings to create a melodic swirl. And after you've been wowed by their show, check out their self-titled EP, which speaks volumes about longing and nostalgia in just three songs. RYAN TOBIAS See Music pg 17\n\nCOLDPLAY\n\n(Roseland) It seems these days that every third band to release a record is declared the new Radiohead, and if you consider that Radiohead's last album was complete crap, you can actually see why this is necessary. The latest group to both garner the classification and bust it apart is the English quartet Coldplay. Sure, they have guitars and a lead singer with a bad hairdo, but the comparison stops there. Coldplay's music is about joy, and where the 'head pile on heavy, crunchy riffs to fill out their melodic jangle, Coldplay are all jangle. Their reputation as a solid concert may be due to singer Chris Martin's naff stage banter more than their chops, but who cares? As long as I get a solid hour and a half of entertainment, it's all yellow to me. LANCE SCOTT\n\nSUNDAY 2/11\n\nBOTCH, BERZERK, YOB\n\n(Pine Street Theater) After a cancelled show earlier this month, Botch is finally here! Some people think Dillinger Escape Plan is the best hardcore band out there right now, but those people have probably never heard Botch--they're tight, complex, and LOUD. JS See My, What a Busy Week pg 15\n\nCARTOON CABARET STARRING DJ GREGARIOUS, CARTOON GO-GO GIRLIES, MORE PERFORMANCES\n\n(Berbati's Pan) Hey remember when you were little and you'd have to wake up early on Saturday morning to watch the Smurfs? This event will be a revisiting to those days, except updated for adult desires. Now you get to fall in love with Strawberry Shortcake all over again, except she's not only a real person, but she's also a nasty sex god! As a benefit for Northwest Rock Medicine (a cool group of doctors who volunteer free health care at rock shows), the lovely Lucy Fur has put together this little function with Portland's all-star exotic dancers dressing up as your favorite trashy cartoon characters: Rainbow Brite, Olive Oyl, Judy Jetson, Sailor Moon, and lots more. DJ Gregarious will spin as well. KD\n\nWEDNESDAY 2/14\n\nA VALENTINE FOR WANDA GOSSETT STARRING DEAD MOON, FLAPJACKS, CHERRY BOMB, ALL OUT\n\n(Berbati's Pan) The legendary Dead Moon could be selling out arenas in Holland or Australia this week, but they wanted to celebrate Valentine's Day with us and Wanda Gossett, a dedicated fan who needs help with her medical bills. Although they're world-renowned, revered, and covered by Pearl Jam (and lots of other Northwest bands), they can still go to the corner store unmolested by rabid fans. Toody and Fred Cole, who've been married since the mid-'60s, have been musicians for longer than most of their audience members have been alive. In between \"keepin' one gig ahead of a day job,\" running an awesome music store in Clackamas, and playing with their grandkids, Dead Moon found time to record a new album, coming out on eMpTy early this year. If you have hours and hours to rock tonight, come out and bring your squeeze; hell, this show is worth seeing with your psycho ex. SUSAN BEAL\n\nFILMS ABOUT LOVE STARRING SUPER8 UNDERGROUND, EGG CARTON ZOO, NORFOLK & WESTERN\n\n(Medicine Hat) Love is already this sort of abstract thing, interpreted in so many different ways and only embodied by actions and words. Why not expand how you think about it with some films by the Super8 Underground? If freedom of action makes a love stronger, then the anti-rules of experimental cinema should exemplify that in the best way. The films are scored by Norfolk & Western, and if their sleepy-train music can't soften your heart, then you should check yourself into the Cynicism Clinic straight away. JS\n\nFUCK LOVE... LET'S ROCK! STARRING MADE FOR TV MOVIE, THE DISAPPEARER, HANGMAN, HEART BEATS RED\n\n(Robot Steakhouse) Of this show, someone asked, \"What, do they hate love?\" No, of course not. More likely, is that they hate the stupid, corporate-generated, sentimental smooshiness and social expectation of Valentine's Day (a rose and a bottle of wine, blah blah blah) and would rather just spend a normal Wednesday making punk rock music. Can you blame them? So, instead of consuming Russell Stover candy cups and genitalia-themed gummy bears today, experience an honest sentiment from some of Portland's most important and fabulous bands. You will certainly rock, with the scratchy passion, biting distortion and/or tasty harmonies these bands share. And, contradictory to the theme of the evening, their unflinching yet emotional tunes will turn your heart all a-flutter, and your panties in a tizzy. So, Fuck bars... Make ART! (Oh... I mean, fuck love, let's rock!) JS\n\nGoing to Seattle?\n\nSat 2/10: Unwound, Old Time Relijun, Cosmos Group (Crocodile); Made for TV Movie, (Rendezvous)\n\nTues 2/13: Unwound, Serum Greys (Paradox); Scratch, Dice Raw (I-Spy)\n\nWed 2/14: Sarah Dougher, S, Aveo, The Cock-Ups (Crocodile); Sofcon, Poseur (I-Spy)"
