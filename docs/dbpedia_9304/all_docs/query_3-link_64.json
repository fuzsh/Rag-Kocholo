        "text": "10. Title of Record is pure Richard. You will know him if you listen. Here's a little about what he has to say. Sorry I cant take audio down. It's at the official site, but I'll take it down as best as I can. \"This Record is about the kitchen sink. If you hear a cello section it's got a cello. If you hear an entire symphony, it's got a symphony. If you hear just one tiny acoustic guitar. It's got 3.\" (Official Page)Pretty good for someone who only listened three times, eh?\n\n27. Yes \"Take A Picture\" is about a plane experience where Rich stripped his pants off in a alcohol induced state and ran around naked scaring the First Class passengers. Here is a quote about the experience from Rich: \"It's embarassing. I got just got drunk and was going crazy it was one of those scenerios. It was probably the most rock starian things I've ever done. I dunno, I got naked on a plane. I remember waking up kinda like with my pants around my ankles and where the hell am I? And um, you know someone said, \"Geez, Rich, you're on a plane\" so the whole song is could you please take my picture cause I won't remember. And that's what I wished I had said to those sitting next to me in first class\"(120 Minutes,Title Interview, 1999). Funny huh? The funnier part I guess about this song, is that when he was asked about this song and if his dad knew what this song meant, he said no. His dad actually called him up and asked him if he knew that he was proud of him. I thought that was hilarious.\n\n16. Richard is really a sensitive guy. Just don't piss him off. This is one of my fave reasons why you shouldnt piss him off. \"The coolest thing about this record is we are as hard as we want to be, i mean we love our fuckin amps turned up and we love the testosterone shit that goes with that, but it's also really wonderful when we can be ya know, i know this sounds corny, but the soft and sensitive guys we are. Speaking of being sensitive guys, i heard one of you mother fuckers actually posted a message that said filter were wusses or wuss bags or something and that take a picture sounds like a beer commercial? Well let me tell you someting mother fucker, i am so fucking hard that i would suck a fart out of your mothers asshole and then gladly burp it back up in her face. And as far as i'm concerned take a picture is one of the greatest songs i ever wrote and so what if its light, who gives a fuck?\"(Fold, Old Rich Words) Woah. I advise not to piss him off.\n\n41. Rich does write from life and he doesn't care what anyone thinks. Here's a little bit of what he has to say. \"Fans of Filter are fans because I am my own person,\" says Richard. \"They don't give a shit about what I'm wearing, or what I think is cool. My life is about Filter. If the kids dig it, great; if they don't dig it because I'm not wearing a gold chain, I don't care. I've never had a plan. All I believe in is writing music and articulating my own opinion out of millions of opinions and seeing if anyone else agrees.\"(Offical Page) As far as those bubblegum pop bands. . .here's his opinion on that. \"Every word that you hear on this album, I lived through personally,\" he says. \"I think that's what is lacking in music today, the lack of the human emotion. Being a musician gives you the responsibility to create musical journeys. That's what all my favorite bands did for me. If there's a kid in Ames, Iowa, who hears my record and says, 'I can do that,' I'm stoked that I was a catalyst for him. I have a responsibility; and it's not to talk bullshit.\"(Official Page) There you go. It's a good one I think.\n\n47. Okay in the car we see them listen to a CD. It's a CD of the music but anyways, if you ever get the chance to go to the Official site and listen to the Title of Record Video you'll see Rich talk about deciding upon the song Cancer if it's going to make the album or not. He uses a car for that and well. ...I told you it was weak to sneak in, but you wanted to know right?\n\n51. The first song on the album is really Sand. It is a 36 second song leading into the 7 minute song called Welcome to the Fold. It's a majorly complicated song. Here's what Rich says about it. \"Here's the bombastic; here's the total ease-back-in-your-chair; here's your trippy, psychedelic electronica-type middle section; and then back to the bombastic, Black Sabbath-y type riff, to more screams and craziness,\" he said. \"It's fun to lead off a record like that\"(Sonic Net) I thought this was interesting about the song. This is about a rehersal they had for Welcome to the Fold. \"During a recent rehearsal at his Abyssinian Sons studio (named for the cats) in the north part of the city, Patrick, 31, ripped out as big a noise as he could draw from his small frame on the last line of the \"Welcome to the Fold\" chorus: \"A-O-kaaaaayyyyyyyyy!\" As the singer gripped the mic with both hands and squinted, guitarist Geno Lenardo, 29, cranked on his Fender Strat, busting a string.\"(Sonic Net) This is about the two sides of the song. \"While both that midsection and the chorus play with the notion of chemical escape,the refrain is far less heady. The chorus actually counters some of the more blunt affronts of the verses (\"I hate your face. ... You think you're precious/ And I think you're shit\"). Such chorus lines as, \"You get yourself a nice cold beer\" sound more like Van Halen lyrics than Filter's stab at modern rock.(Sonic Net) This is what Rich says the song means. I sort of like how they made it less work for me in the editing department. \"When the chorus hits, it's just like, 'Who cares?' \" Patrick said. \"Get off this bullsh--. Celebrate nothing. Let's not have a celebration for anything, let's just celebrate the fact that there's nothing to celebrate. Let's have beers just to f---in' have beers\"(Sonic Net) OH and we can't forget the Fold, now can we? This is what they have to say about the song. This song was the first release off of Title of Record. Rich has said that this song is simply about the release of anger, about the fact we shouldn't celebrate anything -- we should celebrate about nothing -- just celebrate to celebrate.(Fold, Lyric Section)\n\n68. Captain Bligh is about the really Mutiny on the Bounty...yes, he does like history and so do I... (I'm beginning to wonder what it is about our similarities...you sure we ain't soul mates or something....sorry....) anyways....here is what Rich has to say about the meanings on the song...\"[The song is] kind of based on the relationship between Fletcher Christian and Captain Bligh on the Bounty. [William Bligh was a British naval officer who as captain of the HMS Bounty was set adrift by his mutinous crew during a voyage to Tahiti.] I'm a little bit of a history buff and thought it was so fascinating that this captain of a ship was so talented at navigation and so dedicated to the sea but yet he treated his crew and the people around him so badly that Fletcher Christian led this mutiny on the Bounty and kicked this guy off and then this guy, literally on a small little sailboat, navigates himself all the way back to England from the Caribbean. That just blows my mind. So I looked at my relationship with [Nine Inch Nails leader] Trent [Reznor], you know, and my relationship with Brian [Liesegang], and my relationship with other people I've tried to be in a band with and it's just, like one or the other two guys, something just got fucked up with their ego. Whether it was Trent or Brian or whatever. It's like there's this cool thing and then because of some attitude and some bullshit, it's over, and you'll never be friends again or you'll never hang out as much as you used to or whatever. People can be stupid and don't even realize that they're being stupid. Like, what's Brian doing? He disappeared. He should have went off and had his own solo record by now, and he's not even signed. But he made his choice and I respect that it's just mutiny on the Bounty, you know? It's jumping ship, you know?\"(Title of Page Filter Take Aim). I just think that is cool.\n\n70. This is about the guitars they use. Geno said this in a chat. \"Geno: They're all Fender custom shop guitars made by Alex Perez.\"(Sonic Net Filter Chat). I just threw this one in...it's from a chat \"FILTER BR) Bad-ass geetar player? Thanks, we try very hard. Music is very important to us.\"(Sonic Net Filter Chat). This is the technical information about the guitars they use. \"Filter uses tons of different guitars. But their staple is Fender Guitars with a really fat-crunchy tone. They always play on the bridge pickup, and it's always a humbucker- whether it be a slim single coil spaced humbucker, or a full sized one. They use Marshall distortions with Mesa Boogie speaker cabinets. Richard Patrick played guitar on almost all of the Short Bus album. He used his G&L Strat copy, \"the Racing Car\" that he had from when he played live guitar for Nine Inch Nails. Patrick also used Paul Reed Smith (PRS) guitars on that album as well. Patrick created the guitar tones in the track So Cool by turning the tone all the way down on his Gibson Les Paul. Initially, Brian Liesegang used Patrick's \"Racing Car\" guitar, and Patrick played on a PRS. Later on into the Short Bus tour, Richard Patrick, Brian Liesegang and Geno Lenardo all used Fender guitars. Brian Liesegang almost always played stage-left with a couple different guitars, (see listing of all of Filter's Live Guitars below). Brian was handed a freshly tuned guitar each track from the on stage Guitar Tech. Center stage was Richard Patrick who played guitar on about half of the Short Bus Tour set list. Songs like, White Like That, Stuck In Here, and the end of Hey Man, Nice Shot. Either behind Richard Patrick, or further off to stage-right was Frank Cavanagh on bass. Frank has always played Fender 4-String Jazz Bass style bass guitars. And furthest stage-right is Geno Lenardo. Geno has always played through Fender Strats with Marshall & Mesa stacks.\"(Filter Guitar Archive)\n\n24. Rich does like Scully. He raved about it in an old Rich Words. He was visiting his brother when he got to see Scully. \"Contrary to custom, the music assembled here was made for the occasion by artists who came humbly as devotees of the show\"(Found on Key of X) Rich is a big fan of the show. ..isn't that neat. He liked Mulder a lot. Must be the Porno collection. He really was excited about that. Oh by the way. ..Rich Words can be found at the official site as well as the old Rich Words at the Fold site. ..Trust me, they're a blast and I think you'll really enjoy them\n\n32. At the end of Title of Record they did stick a whole bunch of stupid stuff. I think it's them just being guys myself and they thought it sounded cool so they put it there. It must have been when they were bored one day and Rich just was talking into the mic for some reason about being a rock star and such. Yes they make puking noises. I decided after my mom decided that they should be named the Screaming Vomits aka Filter it'd be funny if the band was named that in the story. The band after all does need a name, now doesn't it? Not everyone can be The The. It's a hilarious thing to listen to and cracks me up every time. It does hurt to hear it though sometimes. They ARE making puking noises after all.\n\n25. Yes they did burn a dummy for fun. Go to the official site and watch in Title of Record file. It's in the Video section of the site. If you're a girl and you don't get, hell even if you're a guy and don't get it, it's called being a GUY and let's leave it at that. I think it's funny.\n\n21. He would be guilty about not signing an autograph. He likes to be open with fans. (See the autograph signing fact.)\n\n59. Yes, Rich does have some type of self esteem problem. I took this fact from the line that Sam said he'd feel like a dumbass. Well, I'll let Rich tell you more. \"Patrick: I'm so concerned about people liking me. I don't want to be a dick. And unfortunately, I think sometimes, most of the time I come off like that. Patrick: [\"Captain Bligh\"] is also about saying I've realized that I've been an ass hole at certain times of my life, and like I say, \"I'm a guilty man,\" and I can't believe the thing I've done to you, but at the same time pushing different buttons on different people. It's just kind of an adolescent scream-fest. It's a song about confusion.\"(Title of Page Filter Take Aim)Personally Rich...don't worry; A lot a lot a lot of people LOVE you. Just don't be a dick and well you get the point. Here's another thing about his self esteem. \"There were nights on the road where Rich thought the band didn't deliver the goods. On those particular occasions, he would hide out in the touring coach away from the fans, refusing to sign autographs because he felt it was dishonest to be given respect and admiration for the wrong reasons.\"(Official Filter Page)\n\n36. Well, this is a concert story, of someone else in part. It's from the Fold (Like where else would you go, which I am a part of. ...hee hee. ..email VioletAbyssinian if you really want to get to be a part of the Fold.) I took the concert opening from her experience. Here is a bit of what she had to say. \"After about 20 minutes, you know who came on. FILTER. It started with Geno and Frank walking onto the dark stage and playing \"Sand.\" You could vaguely see them in the red glow. Then Rich snuck on stage, and even though it was really dark, we all knew he was up there. He was decked out in his cowboy hat and sunglasses, but he lost them both a few minutes later. The crowd exploded just as the pyrotechnics went off, and the guys began \"Welcome to the Fold.\" Everyone was moving then, and the mosh pit was recreated. Ok, well not everyone. Let me pause and make a point here.\"(Fold Experiences) Yep, it's grand to go to a concert. Now I could use my own Stones concert experience but that's not relevant to the story, now is it? But, hey, I hope you liked it. Is it just me, or do rock stars make stupid statements at concerts. Mick Jagger doesn't make sense when he speaks, but I can understand. I just think what rock stars say when they are live is just too funny.\n\n37. Yes, unlike a Stones Concert where nothing is signed and nothing is cheap, trust me, it was $35 for one freaking T-shirt. Mick's expensive and they don't come out to sign stuff. Filter does. They are very friendly with the fans and most say Steve is the most friendly. Here's a Fold Story about meeting Rich and it's one of my faves, just cause it's so funny. \"After about 15 minutes, Richard came out of the building, looked at us, waved and said \"Thanks for coming out.\" as he walked towards the bus. Everyone thought he was going to just leave us high and dry. All of a sudden, Richard stops, turns around and says \"What the Fuck are you guys doing? Get over here and gather around so I can sign your stuff.\" Everyone (which had become 15 people by now) started laughing like crazy, because Richard had just played a really cruel joke on all of us. So we all gathered around him while he signed an amazing amount of Filter stuff. I ended up getting my ticket stub and my t-shirt signed by him too. Then I asked him about what he thought of being back in Cleveland for a show the night before (I live near Cleveland, and I know he was from the area too, so it seemed like a smart question to ask.) He replied with \"Man, Cleveland fucking sucked. You guys are so much cooler than they are. We played our asses off and they acted like they didn't even care. I guess they think I'm a sellout now because I bought a house and have a hit record.\" I will always remember that, because it was an answer from Richard straight to me. He stayed out there for a long time, even after all the autographs were done. He just stayed out and talked to us. He was joking around with people and just being a normal guy. I ended up getting to shake his hand before he left and I went home after having the greatest night of my life.\"(Fold Experiences). Thinks Mick should take lessons from Richard, but then again he comes from the generation of Altamont Speedway so perhaps not. We won't even GO into that whole fiasco. Watch the video Gimme Shelter if you really want to know. Its a bad thing. Not a good thing as Martha Stewart would say.\n\n38. Rich does throw things at the crowd like guitar picks and beer bottles and cups and cigarettes he's smoked and well, you get the idea. Instead of like other rock bands where women throw underwear,(which I'm sure happens), Rich and the boys throw stuff into the crowd. He got sued for this once, won the case and wrote a song about it. It's on Title of Record and the song is Skinny. Here's a Fold Story about things that Rich threw. . . . .(Gee don'tcha just love the Fold??) \"During the 3rd song, Geno grabs one of his beer cups, take a drink, and throws it into the crowd. Who ended up with it?...I DID!! I decided to finish off what was left, just so I could say I drank Geno's beer. So I got his beer cup, that was cool. Then after a while, Geno lost his guitar pick, he grabbed for another one on his mic stand and accidentally got 2. So he threw the extra into the crowd. Who got it?...I DID!!! Then, during a break, Richard lit up a cigarette. He smoked about half of it, and flicked it to the side of the stage. One of the security guards saw it still burning and put it in a bottle of water to put it out. So what was running through my mind? \"That was just in Richard's mouth. You have to get it.\" I begged the security guard for the bottle, and without asking why, she just gave it to me. But that wasn't all. At the end of the concert, Richard threw his remaining guitar picks into the crowd and I ended up with one of those too. So my total for this concert : Geno's beer cup, Richard's half-smoked cigarette, Geno's guitar pick, and Richard's guitar pick. Plus, I bought the shirt that says \"Welcome to the Fold Motherfucker\" on the back and it has Geno's beer all over it. Now, considering I went to this concert to celebrate my birthday, I think I got alot of nice birthday presents from the members of Filter. This was the greatest Birthday of my life and I only have Filter to thank for it. The concert was the best one I have ever been to, and I got all sorts of great Filter memorabilia. I love this band. They give and give and never expect anything in return.\"(Fold Experiences) Man I hope I get this lucky. I collect weird stuff like this so there. Of course I'm that weird band person who knows too much about them. . . cough anyone know how to get a hold of Rich's height and weight???\n\n50. Yes, at a concert Rich made fun of Britney Spears. He said to the crowd this : \"Britney Spears has a crush on yours Truly.\" I don't remember the site and I lost it's link. In fact I did look and I couldn't find it. Anyways, I had to sneak that in some how. Here's what he has to say about Britney Spears from Rich Words though. ..\"i can't believe we went to the vma's (me and geno), i mean i love mtv and all, but goddamn after britney spears, sisqo and christina aguillera, i've realized one thing entertainment is alive and well in america but music is dead. rage against the machine helped me get through it and eminem, but i've realized the whole fuckin world is circulating around how much britney spears can shake her ass.\"(Fold Old Rich Words) Yeah he doesn't like her much, eh? I didn't think so. ..I thought you'd enjoy it though.\n\n72. This is about his touring. There was a four year gap between Short Bus and Title of Record. Between Title of Record and The Amalgamut(Not released yet but we've got our fingers crossed) there has been a two year gap and I'm excited for the new album....(Rich FINISH it already...) Here's what he says about touring and the albums.. \"MTV: Back to the tour. How long are you out on the road this time? RP: I'm out for eleven months and then I go back and write the next record, because the records keep the band alive, and making them keeps us all centered and happy. We went on the road for more than two years back in the day, and it really started to bog down. MTV: So the next record won't take three, four years? RP: There will not be a two-year or four-year gap. One year touring, exactly, to the day of the record's release, and then I'm out.\"(MTV Online) Coughs. BUT there was a two year gap. We're okay. Some of us are just perfectionists. Just don't take FOUR years. If I wanted that I'd wait on the Rolling Stones instead. Mick if you're reading this, go make an album NOW!\n\n78. This fact is about the way Filter will do a concert under almost any condition. This is more about Geno than Rich. It has to do with sickness and equipment failure....we know nothing about that right???? Anyways here is a snipnet of the article...\"After the first song, lights were turned on over the crowd, the stage went dark and there was an awkward break. After this happened a second time, guitarist Lenardo explained he had been fighting an intestinal virus for the last few days. Breaks between songs were prolonged more then once when Lenardo had to leave the stage\"(Filter Trip) Here is the other snipnet....\"It wasn't to last. Leonard began having trouble with his guitar equipment....\"(Filter Trip)\n\n44. OOO, a Fact about the studio. ..always fun. If you watch the Title of Record video at the official site, you'd get a good look at it. I read in a Sonic Net article that Rich has a picture of himself hanging in the bathroom right across from the toilet. They have red carpet I guess and Rich has in the kitchen of the studio a picture of his Prom. He doesn't even remember it, but anyways, he, I guess, looked geeky back then. Skinny and scrawny, and that's also the meaning of the song \"Skinny\" Hey, not all of us can be beautiful all of our lives. Some of us grow up to be these beautiful swans that well make the world better.. ..blah blah blah. (Ever get the sense that I like to talk to myself??)\n\n48. OK, more on the studio. Rich says that it is a well oiled music machine. He has a few rules about the studio. As he put it, it sorta goes like this \"Check your attitude at the fucking door.\"(Official Page Title of EP) Sounds reasonable to me. He hs a big American Flag hanging in his studio right in front of a large window. No one can ever say he's not patriotic, now can they? The carpet is red and he has Red Chilli Lights in his studio. The cats, as I said before are the reason it's called what it is and they live there with them. Poor things. They have such huge ears. Anyways, it's a neat looking place.\n\n61. He has this thing about character. I just thought I'd bring it up before I talk about his cats eating the speakers. Which they did do. I just thought I'd share character and the cat's at the same time. \"That's why I just realized that I've got a pretty decent voice and the things that are strange within my voice is what gives me character the character are the wrinkles. I look at growing a little older, my eyes are kind of puffy or whatever, and it's character. It's like when you dent your car, you can look at it like 'Aw, I got a dent in my car.' Or you can look at it like it's got a character. What's better, a brand new, shiny guitar or something that's been beat on since you were 10 years old?\"(Title of Page) Hey, when his manager came to see him play a piece the cat had chewed and clawed a speaker. Trust me as a cat owner, cats think they are just big scratching posts.\n\n62. The Studio..ahhhh that place he makes all his beautiful music...the place that we all wish we could really see in person...okay, maybe not all of us. Here's a description. \"Two years ago, Patrick bought the studio space, which he said used to be a small dance hall called the Puerto Rican Congress Club. In addition to a recording booth, the band's got a rehearsal space in the large main room, which is separated from a TV area by a freestanding wall of shelves topped by a dozen guitar cases. Patrick sleeps in the room next to the vocals booth. He's painted the ceiling in the main room red, and brick-red carpet covers the floor. Anything else that's painted is done in black, matching the L-shaped leather sofa in front of the TV. Red lava lamps dot table surfaces throughout. In the bathroom there is a framed picture of Patrick, hung opposite the toilet.\"(Title of Page Filter Take Aim). Not too shabby if you ask me. I like the sound of that. I'd go for purple and green though...hey, we all like different colors.\n\n57. Yes, Rich talked about working with Trent Reznor. He wanted to do a colaboration and he'll tell you more. \"Reports of strained relations between Patrick and Nine Inch Nails mastermind Trent Reznor were misleading, the Filter leader said. \"Trent and I are friends. And we will work together on a [side] project called Tapeworm,\" Patrick said.\"(Sonic Net) That might be cool. On a side note, I thought it was cute that I saw Robert wearing a NIN shirt once in a photo on some Robert Patrick site. Just thought I'd share.\n\n74. Well, this is a double fact actually. I thought you might want to know. Yes they get along with other bands. I think that's neat. It's like the Beatles and the Stones getting along (Yes they were best friends). Anyways...here is what Rich has to say. Enjoy. \"Richard Patrick: Unbelievably cool. The audiences are amazing. All the bands are amazing. We especially like hanging out with Limp, 'cause they're such sweet dudes. We had a little bit of a problem with some bottles being thrown around in the audience, but I told Fred [Durst], and he was like, \"Yeah, let's hunker down with some of the security at the new venues and make sure that no glass containers make it in.\" That was about the only scary thing. But really, hanging out with all the bands has been great. There's no rock star bull crap to deal with. Everybody's cool, and everybody just wants to hang out and enjoy each other's music.\"(MTV Online) Awwww. He called some guys sweet dudes. That's so cute. Yeah yeah yeah....move on already.\n\n39. Yes, the last two songs are about Rich's love life. They appear on Title of Record and are titled \"I'm Not The Only One\" and \"Miss Blue\". \"It's Gonna Kill Me\" is also about his girl friend that he broke up with, or should I say broke up with him cause he wasn't enough for her. Poor Rich. I wouldn't do that to you,(Hint, give me a call. .my number is 5... ) uh sorry about that. Anyways, I've got some sources on the two songs. You guessed it, The Fold and The Official Site. \"IT'S GONNA KILL ME This song is about Rich's former girlfriend. He uses the \"favorite piece of plastic\" line as a metaphor for the telephone talking/screaming fits he went through. I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE Rich recorded this song about five minutes after slamming his fist into a wall after the girl he loved told him she had been cheating. That's harsh, but it did result in an amazing song. MISS BLUE This song is about the girl who broke Rich's heart in \"I'm Not the Only One.\"(Fold Lyric Section) \"The song 'I'm Not The Only One' I wrote ten minutes after I put my fist through a wall,\" remembers Patrick. \"I had to go to the hospital to get stitches. I recorded the track, and when I played it for my manager, he asked me, 'What are you singing in that verse?' And I'm like, 'I don't know what I'm sayin'...' I was living the moment, confused and bewildered over a girl who was cruel to me. And my manger says, 'Well, why don't you fix this?' I was standing in front of a microphone with a bleeding hand, and I'm like, 'You don't get it, do you?'\" 'Miss Blue' had to come out. I listen to that track now and I think, 'Jesus Christ, I was way in love at that time...' I remember that after each take I had to tell the engineer to stop the tape and hold on for five minutes because it was so emotionally draining. \"Some people may listen [to that song] and think, 'Why isn't he banging his head?' Those people want me to be 25, pissed off at Trent Reznor and the world. But that's just one song out of ten. But when it comes to the hard stuff, you're damn right I'm going to sing about getting sued, and all the failed relationships and deceit and shit like that. This whole record is where you are going to find out who Richard Patrick is.\"(Official Page) Here's a bit about before the microphone and recording the song. \"There [were] awkward moments of bawling and crying in front of the microphone, saying, 'Give me five minutes, guys,' \" Patrick said. \"Every time I did that, I went, 'God, this is beautiful and you can totally hear it. This is the part of the song where I start to break down,' you know? The proudest moments on this record are some of the quiet moments.\"(Sonic Net) This part of the fact comes from I'm Not The Only One \"Patrick's relationship problems during that period inspired more than one track on the album. \"It got so bad that one night I found out that [my girlfriend] slept with someone else,\" he said. \"I punched through a wall instead of hitting her and broke my fifth metacarpal. Shattered it, had 17 stitches on my hand, but before I went to the hospital I sang 'I'm Not the Only One'. I had an amazing time with that chick, that crazy, freaky girl.\"(Sonic Net)\n\n40. Steve is an unknown dude it seems. No one knows if he's dating. I threw in the Steve liking Scully for fun. Gee, bet you couldn't figure that out, besides, I'm being bugged to hit 50 Facts. . ..Besides, we all know Rich likes Scully. ..LOL.. I hope you enjoyed that one.\n\n43. His last girl was a pill popper and slipped a few to Rich. He wrote \"It's Gonna Kill Me\" about that as well, hence the title. ...Thought you'd like that tid bit. \" 'It's Gonna Kill Me' was about when I thought that [a woman] was gonna kill me because she was feeding me so many pills,\" Patrick recalled Monday in a Yahoo!/SonicNet online chat. \"She was into the [prescription anti-anxiety drug] Xanax, but I'm not a pill popper, so I saw my way through it.\" (Sonic Net)\n\n54. Rich does like to read. Which is a good thing. Shows he has intelligence (like we didn't know already) Anyways he'll tell you who he likes to read and why. \"Listen, I've never felt more love lost [than] in making this record ever in my life,\" he continued. \"I bared my soul on that record. ... The only thing that I can do as a singer is to pour my heart into my music, which makes me real, which is what kids identify with. It's real. Hunter S. Thompson ... Charles Bukowski, Hemingway those are my favorite authors; they lived their lives. My job is to live my life and record it in music.\"(Sonic Net). So, you can see that he does like to read and who and for what reason. I just think it's cool. I personally like Hemingway myself. Thanks to a vistor to the site, I have these quotes. I'd like to thank Terri Jones for these.\n\nBukowski Quotes\n\nAn intellectual says a simple thing in a hard way.

It was other people who fell short, who didn't have true humanity.\" -- from Hank: the life of Charles Bukowski\n\nThe pest, in a sense, is a very superior being to us: he knows where to find us and how-usually in the bath or in sexual intercourse or asleep.

Thompson Quotes\n\n\"We had two bags of Grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half-full of cocaine and a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers ... also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls ... but the only thing that worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible than a man in the depths of an ether binge.\" -- Hunter S. Thompson (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas)<\n\n\"I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence, or insanity to anyone, but they've always worked for me.\" -- Hunter S. Thompson\n\n\"The Edge ... There is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over. The others - the living - are those who pushed their control as far as they felt they could handle it, and then pulled back, or slowed down, or did whatever they had to when it came time to choose between Now and Later. But the edge is still Out there. Or maybe it's In. The association of motorcyles with LSD is no accident of publicity. They are both a means to an end, to the place of definitions.\" -- Hunter S. Thompson\n\n65. Yes, Rich collects toys. It's the little boy in him shining through. Cute isn't it? I thought you might say that. Well here is the thing from it. \"Patrick and Lenardo (the band also now includes bassist Frank Cavanaugh and drummer Steven Gillis) spoke about the new album at Abyssinian Sons in July, and also at a Burbank studio where they mixed the disc in late April. In California, they were surrounded by so many newly purchased, unopened \"Phantom Menace\" toys it looked as though they were planning to open their own store. That fascination with kids' toys contrasts sharply with Patrick's speaking tone. If you were to read a transcript of his out of context, you might think he'd lived two or three times his 31 years. He speaks authoritatively about almost everything.\"(Title of Page Filter Take Aim) I feel for him. Some say I sound WAYYYY older than I really am. I can understand that feeling older than you really are....some of us just have harder lives earlier than some other ones....\n\n71. This is about the amusement park experience. I think it's rather cute that they like to go to such places. I know I do and really, they are fun. Here's what they had to say. \"The band took a little r&r recently before they head to LA to mix their forthcoming record. Richard took the crew to one of his favorite stomping grounds, Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio (www.cedarpoint.com). The park is known for it's brutal selection of coasters. The guys, all veteran amusement park junkies, threw themselves at the mercy of as many rides as possible. After the \"Magnum\" (huge coaster) Richard was overheard saying, \"that ride kicked my ass.\" One of the last rides of the day was given by the \"PowerTower\" - an ominous 200 foot straight shot skyward. Drummer Steve Gillis had this to say about it, \"I give this ride the finger.\"(Title of Page Online Exclusive) I actually am using this park as the model for the amusement park they are at. I WANT to go there NOW....\n\n73. Yes, Rich does have this naked thing...or well...you'll see...\"RP: Actually, my favorite song is \"Take A Picture.\" It brings up the happiest time in my life, I think. One time when I was just running around a plane naked. Ha! I had a lot of fun on that plane trip. No, I don't run around naked on planes anymore. I run around in my own studio naked quite a bit. Occasionally I'll get naked on the bus. The guys hate it, but what am I supposed to do? No, no, I'm just kidding. I'm pretty much toning it down, you know. I'm all about business now.\"(MTV Online) Now is it just me, or do you wonder if he really is kidding or not..One must think these things through...anyways, I hope you got the picture. Hence, Take A Picture...wonder if I can get a picture of that without being brought up on charges...."
