        "text": "Rise Records is an American record label currently based in Beaverton, Oregon, mainly focusing on heavy metal and punk rock music artists.\n\nHistory[]\n\nRise was founded in 1991 by Craig Ericson in Nevada City, California. He released a small number of 7\" records before putting the label on hiatus to attend college.[3] Ericson didn't release anything further until 1999, after moving to Portland, Oregon.[3] He began issuing small-print 7\" records, and his first CD release came in 2000, from the group One Last Thing. The label gave a strong foundation to bands Anatomy of a Ghost, Ever We Fall (who later signed with Hopeless) and Fear Before the March of Flames (who signed to Equal Vision). Later signees (e.g. Drop Dead, Gorgeous, Breathe Carolina and The Devil Wears Prada), gained considerable popularity while with Rise, and moved on to what were larger labels at the time (Interscope, Fearless and Ferret, respectively). Rise has also signed some veteran bands, including Hot Water Music, Bouncing Souls, The Bled, Bleeding Through and From First To Last.\n\nRise Records' releases are distributed in the U.S. by ADA and BMG. In July 2013, the company moved from Portland to neighboring Beaverton, Oregon.[4] The label has a distribution deal with Alternative Distribution Alliance,[5] the indie distributor owned by Warner Music Group and directly in Europe and Australia with Warner Music and BMG.[6]\n\nOn September 9, Australian label UNFD announced a distribution partnership with Rise.[7] On May 18, 2015, BMG announced the acquisition of the label. Rise will maintain its headquarters and Ericson will remain in charge. BMG will help with back office operations and provide Rise a more international reach.[8] On December 8th, 2017, Craig Ericson announced his departure from the label.[9]\n\nArtists[]\n\nCurrent artists[]\n\nPage Template:Div col/styles.css must have content model \"Sanitized CSS\" for TemplateStyles (current model is \"wikitext\").\n\nFormer artists[]\n\nPage Template:Div col/styles.css must have content model \"Sanitized CSS\" for TemplateStyles (current model is \"wikitext\").\n\nUNFD artists[]\n\nThe Brave\n\nColumbus\n\nHacktivist\n\nHand of Mercy\n\nHellions\n\nIn Hearts Wake\n\nNorthlane\n\nOcean Grove\n\nStorm the Sky (disbanded)\n\nDiscography[]\n\nUp to Here - Machine\n\nSlydog - Demo\n\nTenpin - 40 Hour Bus Ride\n\nDivit / Lonely Kings - Split 12\"\n\nThe Secludes - Blue\n\nOne Last Thing - The Foster Portfolio (August 14, 2001)\n\nDivit / Everyday Victory - Split CD (August 14, 2001)\n\nLongshot - One Small Voice (August 14, 2001)\n\nOne Last Thing / Crosstide - Split CD (October 16, 2001)\n\nRise Records 10 - Compilation\n\nWatch It Burn - Radio Pollution (October 16, 2001)\n\nDay of Less / The Great Anti-Listen - Split CD (December 11, 2001)\n\nK Through Six - What Once Was and How It Could Be (November 6, 2001)\n\nDay of Less - Ad Hoc (June 4, 2002)\n\nThe 6-Minute Heartstop - The 6-Minute Heartstop (December 11, 2001)\n\nCrosstide - Seventeen Nautical Miles (June 4, 2002)\n\nDualesc - Through the Floods, Not With Them (June 4, 2002)\n\nThe 6-Minute Heartstop - 321 Odds (June 4, 2002)\n\nHighwire Days - Hell from the Eyes Up (September 10, 2002)\n\nThe Solo Project - Bend/Break (November 26, 2002)\n\nAnatomy of a Ghost - Evanescence (October 21, 2003)\n\nThirty Two Frames - Thirty Two Frames\n\nClarity Process - Fluid (June 16, 1999)\n\nFear Before the March of Flames - Odd How People Shake (April 6. 2004)\n\nRise Records 25 - Compilation\n\nLonely Kings - Ides of March (May 19, 1999)\n\nEveryday Victory - Oceans and Airplanes (November 3, 1999)\n\nEver We Fall - Endura\n\nFarewell My Enemy - Casting for Funerals\n\nSmall Towns Burn a Little Slower - Small Towns Burn a Little Slower\n\nOrange Island - The Morning After\n\nClarity Process - Killing the Precedent\n\nStill Life Projector - The Dance Riot\n\nFive Minute Ride - The World Needs No Convincing of All That Is Missing\n\nLife Before This - Life Before This\n\nCoretta Scott - Scream and Shout\n\nPaint by Numbers - Plastic\n\nTides of Man - Empire Theory (August 4, 2009)\n\nTides of Man - Dreamhouse\n\nPmtoday - In Medias Res\n\nSee Rise's full release catalog here.\n\nSee also[]\n\nList of record labels\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
