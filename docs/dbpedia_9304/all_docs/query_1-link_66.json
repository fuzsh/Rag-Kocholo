The evolve stoke for awhile was my prime candidate with it being to small, light, dual belt drive and made in australia i thought it would be a great choice. I had just read a thread about carbon decks and enclosures and for a complete DIY noob i was wondering what components i should use should i decide to do the diy route and how would it all work together on the deck?\n\nIn short i just would like to know what sorta cost it would be to diy vs buy a stoke for similar specs. Would prefer dual belts rather than hubs seeing as i already have a hub board\n\nI am in Melbourne and I believe @glyphiks we spoke about batteries on facebook? (please dont go saying “oh you are redacted”) But uh yeah im in melbourne so you know when group rides are ever possible again we can have a chat about perhaps what components to use for this build."
