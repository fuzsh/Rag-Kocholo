The ESC has now been upgraded to dual 60A Hobbywing ESC as of July 2013. The size of the Freewing SU-35 is an amazing site to behold. This plane is one of the largest, most sophisticated, foam EDF jets made. Whether you like scale flight or outlandish maneuvers, the Freewing SU-35 can do it all. We think the Freewing SU-35 is one of the most entertaining EDF jets out there. The specs alone are amazing. The SU-35 is built from EPS foam and has nylon hinged control surfaces, shock absorbing landing gear, dual motors, dual ESC, dual 70mm EDF fans, and runs on a 6 cell LiPo battery. We are not sure what else to ask for in an EDF jet.\n\nNOTE: Our SU-35 comes with a single XT-150 connector wired to both ESC. We also have the XT-150 connector on our 6S 5000mAh 50C Lipo which works well in this plane and we have XT-150 charger leads to make things easy. The XT-150 is the best connector for this high powered EDF.\n\nFeatures:\n\nNEW Dual 60A ESC\n\nNEW XT-150 ESC Connector\n\nDual 70mm electronic ducted fans (EDF)\n\n360 degree vectored thrust for incredible maneuvers (hover, flip turns, etc.)\n\nDurable shock absorbing landing gear\n\nNylon hinges on all control surfaces (superior to foam hinges\n\nBrushless motor, ESC and servos installed\n\nRequires:\n\nMinimum 7 Channel Radio\n\n7-8 Channel Receiver\n\nOne 6 cell 22.2V 5000mAh 50C LiPo battery or One 6 Cell 22.2V 4000mAh Lipo Battery\n\nLipo Battery Charger\n\nSkill Level: Advanced"
