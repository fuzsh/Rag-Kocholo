        "text": "Further to the news item we posted here yesterday about SOULFLY drummer Joe Nunez's possible defection from the group's ranks over contractual issues, it now appears that the skinsman is keeping busy by playing in a local Chicago-area band called STRIPPING THE PISTOL, who are reportedly showcasing for a few major labels on Sunday, October 21st at the Metro in Chicago. It is not yet clear if Nunez's involvement with the group is a temporary or a permanent one.\n\nRapper JA RULE appeared on MTV's TRL yesterday and was asked by host Carson Daly about his collaboration with METALLICA on an as-yet-undisclosed track. RULE responded by saying ''Sup James! 'Sup Lars! 'Sup Kirk!' and offered that he had been a big fan of METALLICA when drummer Lars Ulrich and guitarist Kirk Hammett called him up about working together. According to RULE, the end result is 'very rocked out'. As previously reported, the “mostly instrumental number” may end up on a Dreamworks Records compilation, which is tentatively due to be released in early 2002.\n\nIRON MAIDEN vocalist Bruce Dickinson recently explained to Metal Hammer magazine the reasons behind the indefinite shelving of the proposed TRINITY project, which was set to feature Dickinson, ex-JUDAS PRIEST frontman Rob Halford and QUEENSRYCHE singer Geoff Tate. According to Bruce, 'I put the TRINITY project on hold. It was me who pulled the plug. It was a project too far and nobody had the time to do it properly. And it had to be right. I said to everyone, 'How would you like to be responsible for killing three careers in one move and also be the first stiffer on Sanctuary Records?' Its not good position to be in and not worth rushing. I do think TRINITY is a fine idea and would work if it was executed extraordinarily well. Roy and I wrote three songs for it with the intention of using all 3 voices in each song. It wasn't here's Rob's song with Bruce and Geoff backing him and so on. We actually wrote songs whereby each voice had its own area and the lyrics were written for each voice too. There were bits written where Geoff and I would sing harmonies and stuff where Rob and Geoff would do stuff - all the phrasing was written for each singer too but it was f.cking hard work. After three weeks, Roy and I were sure that we couldn't get it done by the summer. It was bloody interesting writing in that way. I was there doing demos in three different vocal styles singing Rob-isms and Tate-isms to indicate whose voice should be doing what.'\n\nFinland's CHILDREN OF BODOM will join the Tattoo the Planet package for one show, in Milan, Italy, on Wednesday, October 17th.

First, the KISS guitarist showed up minus makeup at the Friars Roast of Hugh Hefner with a black eye (given to him by his soon-to-be ex-girlfriend). Frehley then suffered the indignity of having his coveted seat on the dais stolen by Jackie 'The Joke Man' Martling, forcing him to sit in the audience. Later, Frehley and his daughter Monique, 21, joined Hef, his harem of hotties, and Rob Schneider at Spa, where a drunken clubgoer groped and tried to kiss Monique. Frehley, his patience shot, responded by punching the guy in the face.”\n\nDESTRUCTION will be headlining the Rock Hard magazine party, due to be held at the Big Island in Dortmund, Germany on Sunday, October 7th.

Meanwhile, SNAKEPIT rhythm guitarist Kerri Kelli has issued a statement of his own, claiming that none of the group have been officially fired, and that as far as he knows, the band is still together. 'I have not been told by the manager or the business accountant/manager or Slash anything of the sort,” stated Kelli. “I spoke with the other guys and they have not heard either. We know that Slash wanted to take some time off—a few months off—there was no exact time period. Obviously he had the Les Paul thing in New York, and the Michael Jackson pay-per-view, which I believe is going to be shown on CBS in the next couple of weeks. We've been told that he's been considering doing a solo album with guest musicians. I don't know anything about that myself. Last time I actually heard from Slash was about three weeks ago. He left me a message and said that everything was fine. He said he'd been back and forth from New York. I think it was when he was rehearsing with Michael. But we have not heard anything on that front. I think the band is one of the best rock bands around and I hope to keep it that way along with the other guys. Although everyone has their own opinions, that is my opinion. So no, it has nothing to do with us being fired whatsoever. The rumors are completely false.'\n\nFILTER mainman Richard Patrick and engineer Rae Dileo took a break from recording FILTER's next CD this past February to produce an unsigned Portland, OR band named DUALESC at their Abyssinian Sons Studios.
