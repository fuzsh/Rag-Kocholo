It's great!!\n\nI'd like to thank a few people. First off, and foremost, I'd like to thank Rich, Geno, Frank, and Steve. You guys rock and without you this site would not even exist. I'd also like to thank Violet Abyssian for making the FOLD a wonderful site of information. I'd like to thank Title of Page for their wonderful articles. It's an honor to have used the information you so meticulously gathered and formed into information packed sites. I still am in awe of what you have done. Keep it up. -Allison, Rich Fact Webmistress.\n\nDisclaimer: I do not own the information, except my commentary, that appears on this site. I am using other sites info and I am in awe of the work that they do. This is to just inform and hopefully entertain. Enjoy. It's a blast to read and I hope you enjoy the humor that I have put into the facts. Anyone can write a dry as dust collection. When Rich was born, he was....see ANYONE can do that. Sheesh, what do I look like? Charles Dickens?\n\nUH, I'm gonna warn you. The language on this site is, well, ADULT. If you're too young to come and see the big bad f-word, then don't. I don't want any parents coming down on me for teaching children big bad swear words. As far as I know, the first amendment still exists and I'll put this here if I want to. It IS your choice to read. Will get off of soap box NOW...\n\nHere are the sources I used, classifed by page and in alphabetical order for the most part, except the pages I'm using that are NIN related will appear at the bottom of the list. Use the links and locate them by site. Several articles found on Consider This appear in other pages aswell.
