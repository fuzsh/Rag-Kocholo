I've ordered a 45054 Tamiya TEU-106BK ESC for Twin Motor, and ballrace bearings. Can somebody please give me some advice on hopping up the standard motors. I want to make it's top end speed as fast as possible (I'm willing to upgrade the TEU-106bk ESC with a better one if it will really make a difference).\n\nI appreciate the Bullhead isn't fast compared to small cars etc, but i'm looking to get it hiding a fair speed on flat beaches as this is where it will be predominently used. I will be running it with 7.2V 3800mAh NiMH Batteries. Everything other than what has been described will be standard.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nBISH.\n\nEdou\n\nOffline\n\nHopping Mad\n\nPosts: 6136\n\nLikes received: 484\n\nTamiya states that the max you could put on this ESC is two Sport Tuned motors. Or anything over 25T...\n\nWhich I find a bit confusing tbh 'cause I always thought they were 23T to start with.\n\nBut it means that the top speed for this unit will be limited. Probably a good idea on the Bullhead though.\n\nA couple of (25T) Tamiya GT Tuned could be a nice alternative. They should be slightly faster than the Sport Tuned.\n\nBISH1979\n\nOffline\n\nBeing nuts is NEAT!\n\nPosts: 28\n\nLikes received: 0\n\nThanks for the feedback guys - all good info\n\nHow would I go about configuring dual ESC's? Would I need a special receiver to plug in two?\n\nIf I am to go down the new dual ESC's, motors, and receiver's - any recommendations for a parts list?\n\nAny links to wirings diagrams / pictures of such a setup would be very much appreciated.\n\nBISH.\n\nEdou\n\nOffline\n\nHopping Mad\n\nPosts: 6136\n\nLikes received: 484\n\nI think it might be worth having a look at this topic .\n\nNot my expertise but a single (heavy) ESC and battery seems to be another option.\n\nSee attached diagram of how it is wired up.\n\nJonny Retro\n\nOffline\n\nStaff Writer\n\nPosts: 7897\n\nLikes received: 4918\n\nI think it might be worth having a look at this topic . ...\n\nTo sum it up, we were discussing the essential pointlessness of trying to make a Bullhead/Clod chassis go faster, and I'd still stick by that - what makes these special is their sheer physical presence, their ability to drive oven lesser trucks (like Lunchboxes), the fact that out of the box, they're the only Tamiya vehicle that will drive on proper snow, and that they float ... I've tried making one go fast, and all it does is make a lot more noise, create horrendous body roll, make them fall over a lot, break parts, and not really go any faster.\n\nBISH1979\n\nOffline\n\nBeing nuts is NEAT!\n\nPosts: 28\n\nLikes received: 0\n\nWell guys, this is certainly the right place to ask these sort of questions.\n\nMy stock vintage bullhead should be arriving tomorrow; following your feedback I'll see how things workout with the standard setup, and unless I need it to go faster may leave the motors alone. Afterall my King Blackfoot chassis arrived today, and I already have a very quick TL01 and Nitro Force - so maybe the Bullhead will remain un-hopped so it can be the best on snow and water!\n\nOnce again many thanks for your feedback guys. i'll post some pics of my toys once they've been made presentable.\n\neddrick\n\nOffline\n\nGO FOR IT!\n\nPosts: 2169\n\nLikes received: 113\n\nI'll second Jonny on the Clod verses speed front - unless you do something pretty serious with all the sloppy bendy suspension & steering linkages, you really won't want to be driving it any quicker than what the silvercans will give you, & you'll find the most fun will be had at or near your feet, not tearing off into the horizon.\n\nSteering is similar to a canal boat - happens 3 seconds after you tell it to, then oversteers, but still with a similar turning circle to aforementioned boat.\n\nHandling, well I don't suppose you've ever seen a greased-up hippo trying to skate?\n\nClods are for squishing, wheelies, climbing & swimming, not land speed records"
