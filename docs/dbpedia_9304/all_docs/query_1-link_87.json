I steal your thunder.\n\nI got your mother's maiden name tattooed on my arm.\n\nI drive out daemons. Can I hear an Amen?\n\nNow say my name.\n\nLay hands on screaming heathens. And do it all again.\n\nMy subtle hustle, smooth as mother's butter.\n\nI let it ride on, I let it ride on.\n\nBack again with a quickness, pick it up, pick it up. Master arithmeticness, light it up, light it up. I got the heat in both feets, snake handler's hands. Come back with slickness and do it all again. My subtle hustle, smooth as mother's butter. I let it ride on, I let it ride on. Now I'm the media's darling, pick it up, pick it up. An international phenomenon, light it up, light it up. I cause eclipses with a wave of the hand. Let them hang in ellipses and do it all again. My subtle hustle, smooth as mother's butter. I let it ride on, I let it ride on. I got your number. I steal your thunder. I got your mother's maiden name tattooed on my arm. I drive out daemons. Can I hear an Amen? Now say my name. Lay hands on screaming heathens. And do it all again. My subtle hustle, smooth as mother's butter. I let it ride on, I let it ride on."
