When wiring battery cells together does the c rating add up or stay the same. For example if i wire up 4 100mah 5 c cells would i end up with a 400 mah 20 c 4s battery? or 400 mah 5c 4s?\n\nChris_The_Battery_Man\n\nI wanna be Dave\n\nJoined\n\nOct 5, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n2,078\n\nLocation\n\nMilwaukie OR\n\nMay 28, 2011\n\n#2\n\nNope.

CheapBatteryPacks.com has a 3S 65C 350mah (?) that is small, fairly cheap and works well (we have 3 for my son's 1.9, getting 3 more ASAP for my 1.9)\n\nPowerCrazy\n\nQuarry Creeper\n\nJoined\n\nApr 11, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n226\n\nLocation\n\nUnited States\n\nMay 29, 2011\n\n#5\n\nI know 5 c would suck lol it was just an example. I have some pretty small 3s batteries. I'll prob get the 850 4 s from cheapbatterypacks.com as its the smallest one i have found so far\n\nCharlie-III\n\nI wanna be Dave\n\nJoined\n\nNov 29, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n8,314\n\nLocation\n\n07456 N.

I run (as does my son) the CBP 3S 45C ~800mah and they are fine in 2.2 Bully MOA's with dual ESC's. A single pack can do 2 comp courses, but we usually only run a single course before swapping batteries.\n\nstatic80\n\nNewbie\n\nJoined\n\nApr 10, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n30\n\nLocation\n\nVictoria\n\nMay 29, 2011\n\n#7\n\nSo in my example \"For example if i wire up 4 100mah 5 c cells would i end up with a 400 mah 20 c 4s battery? or 400 mah 5c 4s? \"\n\nIt would be a 400 mah 5c 4s right?\n\ndepending on how you wire it you would get a\n\n400 mah 5c, 1s 4p 3.7v pack that can deliver 2amp\n\nor a\n\n100 mah 5c 4s 1p 14.8v pack that can deliver .5 amp\n\nif you wire in parallel y ou add mah, and not volts, if you wire in series you add volts and not mah\n\nCharlie-III\n\nI wanna be Dave\n\nJoined\n\nNov 29, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n8,314\n\nLocation\n\n07456 N.

I bought one a while back for the hell of it and I like the extra wheel speed. Today I geared it down to 12t/87 t. Less wheel speed than it had with 16t/93t but feels good. I also tried 10t/93t haha could pull a house down but barlely spin a tire. I'm just playing with different setups and havn't decided on what I'll settle with...The idea right now is keep 4s and play with the cheat mode a little for the last 10% or so of the throttle.... Chris, what kind of c rating battery is needed to feed my tekin 21.5 with 4s and 30-50 degrees of advanced timing without it starving for juice?"
