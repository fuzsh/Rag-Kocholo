        "text": "American record label\n\nRecord label\n\nRise Records is an American record label currently based in Beaverton, Oregon, mainly focusing on alternative rock, heavy metal, and punk rock music artists.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nRise was founded in 1991 by Craig Ericson in Nevada City, California. He released a small number of 7\" records before putting the label on hiatus to attend college.[3] Ericson didn't release anything further until 1999, after moving to Portland, Oregon.[3] He began issuing small-print 7\" records, and his first CD release came in 2000, from the group One Last Thing.\n\nRise Records' releases are distributed in the U.S. by ADA and BMG. In July 2013, the company moved from Portland to neighboring Beaverton, Oregon.[4] The label has a distribution deal with Alternative Distribution Alliance,[5] the indie distributor owned by Warner Music Group and directly in Europe and Australia with Warner Music and BMG.[6]\n\nOn 9 September, Australian label UNFD announced a distribution partnership with Rise.[7] On 18 May 2015, BMG announced the acquisition of the label. Rise will maintain its headquarters and Ericson will remain in charge. BMG will help with back office operations and provide Rise a more international reach.[8]\n\nOn 8 December 2017, Craig Ericson announced his departure from the label.[9] Sean Heydorn stepped up and took over Rise Records.\n\nIn 2020, Rise Records moved their operation into the BMG Los Angeles office, located at 5670 Wilshire Blvd, where Sean Heydorn continues to oversee the label today.[10]\n\nOn February 18, 2021, Rise Records announced a partnership with Blue Swan Records which is founded by Dance Gavin Dance guitarist Will Swan.[11]\n\nArtists\n\n[edit]\n\nCurrent artists\n\n[edit]\n\nFormer artists\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of record labels\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
