        "text": "Template:Music of the United States\n\nThe music of Oregon reflects the diverse array of styles present in the music of the United States, from Native American music to the contemporary genres of rock and roll, country, rhythm and blues, jazz, pop, electronic music, and hip hop. However, throughout most of its history, the state has been relatively isolated from the cultural forces shaping American music. Much of modern popular music traces its roots to the emergence in the late 19th century of African American blues and the growth of gospel music in the 1920s. African American musicians borrowed elements of European and Indigenous musics to create new American forms. As Oregon's population was more homogeneous and more white than the United States as a whole, the state did not play a significant role in this history.\n\nThe state's main contributions to American popular music began in the 1960s, when The Kingsmen and Paul Revere & the Raiders established Oregon as a minor center of frat rock and garage rock. This led in one direction to the blues rock tradition of the Robert Cray Band and Curtis Salgado, and in another direction to the hardcore punk scene of the early 1980s Pacific Northwest, led by the Wipers in Portland and like-minded bands in Seattle and Vancouver, BC. Over the next twenty years, punk rock evolved into grunge, riot grrrl, alternative rock, and, eventually, indie rock. In the last decade, Oregon has made a unique contribution to American independent music, with a strong indie music scene developing in Portland. The city's reputation as a hipster mecca has paralleled the rise of local indie musicians such as The Decemberists (singer Colin Meloy attended the University of Oregon), Gossip, The Dandy Warhols, M. Ward, Logan Lynn, Storm Large, Pink Martini and the late Elliott Smith. Floater is Portland's leading example of an indie band. They have remained unsigned to a major label for over 20 years and have managed to be voted the best band of Portland for 2009 in addition to frequently selling out major venues like the Crystal Ballroom and the Aladdin Theater.[1][2][3] Other prominent musicians have relocated to Portland, including Modest Mouse (of Seattle), Sleater-Kinney (of Olympia, Washington), The Shins (of Albuquerque, New Mexico), Spoon (of Austin, Texas), former Pavement leader Stephen Malkmus (of Stockton, California), singer songwriter Patterson Hood (of Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and Athens, Georgia),[4] and former R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck (of Berkeley, California and Athens, Georgia).[5]\n\nThe state also has a unique rural-urban dynamic, which has influenced the development of local bluegrass, folk, and alternative country music. Jam bands have a strong presence in the state, dating back to Grateful Dead performances at the Oregon Country Fair, and outdoor music festivals continue to be popular. Portland's Waterfront Blues Festival is the second largest blues festival in the country. Prominent cultural institutions include the Oregon Bach Festival, Oregon Festival of American Music, Oregon Symphony, and Mt. Hood Jazz Festival.\n\nPortland[]\n\nPop Music[]\n\nFrom the 1960s to the 1980s, some musical groups from Portland had occasional success on the pop charts. The Kingsmen (singer Jack Ely died in Oregon) were the first to hit the top 10 with their 1960s garage rock classic \"Louie Louie\" peaking at #2, and Paul Revere & the Raiders gained popularity in Portland after relocating there from Idaho. The Hudson Brothers had several hits, such as \"Mr. Kirby\" (though originally this came when the group was named 'The New Yorkers'), \"So You Are a Star\" and even had their own eponymous TV show during the 1970s. Quarterflash (which started out in the 1970s as a jazz band called 'Seafood Mama'), were led by the husband/wife duo Marv & Rindy Ross. The band had several hits, including a platinum-selling #3 song \"Harden My Heart\" in 1981. Nu Shooz, also led by a husband/wife duo (John Smith & Valerie Day), also had several hits, their biggest also going to #3 \"I Can't Wait\" in 1986.[6]\n\nPunk rock[]\n\nPortland had one of the most vibrant hardcore punk scenes in the early 1980s Pacific Northwest, rivaled only by Seattle and Vancouver. The Wipers and Poison Idea are the best known representatives of the scene, especially The Wipers, a major grunge influence. These bands played at The Met (now Dante's) and the Satyricon. Other hardcore bands in the 1980s included Lockjaw, Final Warning, The Jackals, and The Rats. Hole frontwoman Courtney Love spent time in Portland, and was active in the city's punk scene at the time.[7] She initially met Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain at the Satyricon club in 1989.\n\nIn the 1990s bands such as Defiance, Resist, Bugskull, Detestation, and Tragedy rose in popularity. An important cult band from Portland was the Exploding Hearts of the early 2000s. Dead Moon developed a cult worldwide following with their garage-country punk, starting from the early 1990s.\n\nBluegrass and old-time[]\n\nPortland is home to a thriving bluegrass and old-time music scene. Popular Portland bands include Foghorn Stringband, and The Water Tower Bucket Boys. Banjo player Tony Furtado, who has branched out from traditional bluegrass music into progressive bluegrass, jazz, and other genres, currently lives in Portland. The Portland Old-Time Music Gathering takes place in mid-January each year, with a variety of Northwest musicians, jamming, and square dancing. This event attracts a more diverse audience than is found at Old-Time events in the rest of the state.\n\nWorld and world fusion[]\n\nPortland is home to a thriving world music and international folk dancing scene[8] including the Al-Andalus Ensemble. West Africa is represented by such groups and artists as Obo Addy (Ghana), Jujuba (Nigerian Afrobeat), and Boka Marimba (Zimbabwe). Eastern Europe and the Middle East has music and dance representation through groups such as Brothers of the Baladi, Vagabond Opera, Krebsic Orkestar & Balkan Fusion Project, The Underscore Orkestra, Balkan And Beyond, Kef, The Mora, Vequinox, 3 Leg Torso and Chervona.Portland also has been the home of Caribbean Latin Music since late 1970's but most influence by Aquiles Montas since January 1984 to present time, promoting merengue, salsa, cumbia, chachacha, bachata as a leader musician of Ritmo Tropical (1984-1987) and with Conjunto Alegre from 1987 to today. As a promoter bringing international lating artist, dancing, food and more.\n\nThere are three Argentine Tango ensembles that play frequently at Portland milongas, the Alex Krebs Tango Quartet, Perola, and the Rita Sabler Quartet.\n\nIndie music[]\n\nIn recent years, a number of indie music bands from Portland which have played local venues have won recording contracts with promoters such as Partisan Records and Knitting Factory Records and have been touring nationally. These include Emil Amos of Holy Sons,[9] Sallie Ford and the Sound Outside,[10] AgesandAges,[11] Ash Black Bufflo,[12] Dolorean,[13] and others.\n\nDance Music[]\n\nPortland is also home of the world's first and only all-Asian American dance rock band, The Slants, another independent act who has been made international headlines, both for their public battle with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, as well as their active involvement in the anime industry.[14]\n\nElectronic Dance Music has recently become extremely popular in the past several years. Many amazing producers are coming out of Portland and making an impact on music today. Some of the artists include Hatiras, Forrest Avery, Roman Zawodny, DJ Deformaty, and Abrasion Equation. EDM is playing in many clubs and venues downtown, some catering to this genre in specific, such as The Refuge and The Watershed. Some of the current Electronic Dance Music event production crews include Red Cube, anonymous-i, Proper Movement, StarCatchers Events, Speak E-Z Productions, Flair Productions, Gitdown, Greenman Events, and BIZ Entertainment.\n\nOther Portland musicians[]\n\nEugene[]\n\nFormed in 1984, the Surf Trio was a punk/surf band based in Eugene.[16] Founding members included Ron Kleim on guitar and vocals, Pete Weinburger on guitar and vocals, Dave Myers on bass and Aaron Temple on drums.\n\nThe ska-swing-funk band the Cherry Poppin' Daddies were formed from the ashes of Eugene psychedelia band Saint Huck in 1989. The Daddies gained a large Northwest cult following during the early 1990s, conversely attracting harsh criticism from protesters who perceived the band as sexist and obscene. The Daddies rose to mainstream notoriety with the ska and swing revivals of the late 1990s. The group continues to be based in Eugene, along with their side projects, the glam punk outfit White Hot Odyssey and the piano rock trio The Visible Men. The lead singer of the Cherry Poppin' Daddies attended the University of Oregon in Eugene.\n\nFloater was formed in 1993 and made their start playing garage parties and at the University of Oregon. Now residing in Portland,[17] Floater has released eight studio albums, plus three live albums on indie label Elemental Records. They have also received nominations to the preliminary level of the Grammys from NARAS in 1995 under Best Rock Performance for their first album Sink and in 1996 under Best Alternative Performance for their second album Glyph.[18]\n\nAs for songs about Eugene, two country stars have weighed in. Dolly Parton wrote a song about Eugene in 1972, which was released in the 4-CD box set Dolly in 2009,[19] with the refrain, \"Eugene, Oregon I'll remember you for the rest of my life, I won't forget how good you were to me, No and I won't be forgettin' all the kindness that you show To a homesick country girl a long, long way from Tennessee.\"[20][21] In addition, Johnny Cash recorded the song \"Lumberjack,\" written by Leon Payne, referring to Eugene Saturday nights: \"Well you work in the woods from morning to night, You laugh and sing and you cuss and fight, On Saturday night you go to Eugene, And on a Sunday morning your pockets are clean.\"[22][23]\n\nIn 2015 Sufjan Stevens released Carrie & Lowell, which includes a song entitled \"Eugene\", as well as \"All Of Me Wants All of You\", with references to Spencer Butte, a landmark at Eugene's southern edge.[24]\n\nList of Eugene musicians[]\n\nAdickdid, indie rock\n\nTracy Bonham, singer-songwriter\n\nCletis Carr, singer-songwriter\n\nRobert Cray, guitarist, singer\n\nTim Hardin, singer-songwriter\n\nBill Harkleroad (Zoot Horn Rollo when he played guitar for Captain Beefheart)\n\nTom Intondi, folksinger, spent his last years in Eugene\n\nKelly Keagy, drummer for Night Ranger\n\nMat Kearney, singer-songwriter, whose album Just Kids has an anthem to the Oregon Ducks, \"Coming Home\"[25]\n\nThomas Mapfumo (originally from Zimbabwe)\n\nShawn McDonald, singer-songwriter\n\nDan Siegel, keyboardist and composer\n\nThis Patch of Sky, instrumental/post-rock band\n\nMason Williams, singer-songwriter\n\nPaul Wright, singer-songwriter\n\nYob, doom metal band\n\nAndrew Katz, drummer for Car Seat Headrest\n\nSalem[]\n\nThis section does not cite any sources.

The majority of the members of nationally recognized alternative rock bands Blitzen Trapper, Dharma Bums and Typhoon were originally from the Salem area and got their start in the Salem music scene, playing at venues like The Grand Theatre, Jimi's Guitar Planet, The Ike Box, The Governor's Cup, The Knights of Columbus Hall and The Space.
