        "text": "So far they can't reproduce the problem.... I actually knew this was going to happen, reproducing interference problems relates to the exact environment where the issues occur and difficult to replicate even in the exact controlled environments as is. They said the board works fine and is smooth. The Evolve USA site is in a warehouse so I believe they don't get as much RF interference around an industrial site as compared to a city environment or neighborhood with people running all types of RF gadgets. I'm going to push them to swap out the controller if they are unable to reproduce it which I suspect they won't reproduce it. And if I get the board back and I still have issues I just will not be able to ride this thing nor come around to ever trusting it again. I'll let them go through their troubleshooting process and keep positive vibes up.\n\nI also passed on to them that possibly the Carbon Fiber battery cover may be filtering and reducing the signal.\n\nHere's a video showing how CF acts a a filter to the signal. You can see the guy measures the strength of the signal then puts the CF tube over the antenna and you see a significant drop in RF strength. I don't know what the heck he's saying but I can understand the screen and what he's doing. I just talked with my battery engineer and he said they did what? Put the antenna inside the carbon fiber box? I said yes. He said someone didn't understand that carbon fiber filters the radio signals. So if I do get my board back and its still acting up you know what I'll be doing! Off with that battery box carbon fiber cover, I'll be making my own out of plastic, and trying that out.\n\nI really do hope EvolveHQ are able to diagnose and solve the root cause of these issues.\n\nI appreciate it's apparently only a tiny fraction of users affected. But it only takes one person in the wrong situation for a split second for things to turn south quick.\n\nThey probably don't want to share too much information publicly about the complete ins and outs of the board, but there's some very smart technically minded professionals on here who only want the best for Evolve and the problem to be rectified to restore complete confidence in the product (that same confidence the other 99% of your customers have).\n\nIf it is environmental factors I'm sure it would help in diagnosing the problem if we knew more about the signal, chipset, and software used to communicate between the remote and the board.\n\nI guess this really highlights one benefit of the open source approach to the hardware and software with relatively new product that's Evolving quickly.\n\nI'm sure they're doing everything they can to diagnose the issue. The customer support I've received has been stellar with regards to my board, incredibly personal and responsive. I hadn't experienced a buying experience and post purchase support like I have with Evolve in so long it inspired me to launch this site. And I didn't take that decision lightly, I did so because I feel they've got really fabulous product and everyone I've met as a result of electric skateboarding has been so sound.\n\nBut if they need help and the community can help in any way, then they know where we are!\n\nI tried to take of the lid on my board after reading this post. And I actually managed to pair my remote for several minutes this time, but it was behaving super strange. When I pulled down the trigger nothing happened before I had it down over 50%, Then the wheels started to spin in really fast speed. Even in Slow mode the wheels would spin super fast. Started at 13km/h And straight to 36-40hkm/h.(bench test).\n\nSo seems like the lid can block signals.\n\nStill Im really puzzled why this happened at all. The remote was great for 4-5 rides, and then suddenly won't pair anymore?\n\nReally hope a new remote solves the problem. Have to say Im a bit worried this would happen in the field.\n\nSo my nightmare came true.......\n\nMy remote was shipped out from Evolve, Tarifa wearhouse Today. So going to ride all weekend. And hope that this will just be a bad memory. Cant tell you guys how much fun this board is. Ahh well, I guess you know if your on this site\n\nActually thinking of getting a spare board. So I won't have any downtime if something happens again, Don´t know what to do whit myself whit no board to ride, and the weather is so awesome, 23 Degrees and not cloud on the sky.\n\nBig thanks to Andy and Mark at Evolve UK. Fast and awesome customer service. Really a pleasure to deal whit those guys. So my next board is going to be a Bamboo GT. I know Im in good hands bying from them\n\nCheers Guys.\n\nCurious if they swapped mine out for that one.... we'll see soon. I emailed Evolve USA to see if they did these changes to my remote, and if not, to please do them for my safety. I hope the comply with this request. I actually stated to Evolve that they need to soften the throttle / brake curves, but Brandon indicated that the way the board is having so much torque, is why its like that and why it isn't silky smooth like the Gen2. I call BS on that one, any DIY guy understands you have full access to soften these curves. So I'm pushing them to still address mine for that I DID get HURT bad do to the remote madness which has been a known issue for some time.\n\nBy the way, riding in flip-flops in the video above in my opinion isn't the brightest idea.... I don't recommend\n\nReally good to hear in that vid they told him they'd be willing to swap our existing remotes out for the new one. I hope that really is the case.\n\nHe made an interesting observation about switching the board around to ride purely in FWD mode in softer, sandy terrain. Is that the case that it would be really be an advantage? Not that familiar with the difference between RWD and FWD in this instance.\n\nAndy, do you know what speed mode essentially Reverse is? Is it the equivalent of say Fast, but in the other direction?\n\nIt seems this season is drawing to a close what with the Boosted delay, the Acton KickStarter ending, InBoard getting funding on SharkTank (the US version of Dragon's Den), the Enertion 2 Kickstarter being launched, and Christmas approaching.\n\nThere's so much competition out there, Evolve need to seriously focus on refining their current product and rectifying the few (although concerning) recurring issues we keep seeing between here, Facebook and reddit.\n\nGet that bloody remote sorted.\n\nGet a kill switch and/or trigger guard on the new version, something like Nickelberry has designed.\n\nGet smoother acceleration profiles installed as default so newbies and those of us that only want to cruise don't end up on our asses if we accidentally knock the trigger or send the board flying into traffic.\n\nEmphasise the necessity of riding safely with a helmet (and pads) in their manual and all their marketing material.\n\nPromote safety big time, make it the cool thing to do.\n\nIt should be like snow sports where you're seen as an idiot if you don't wear a helmet these days, because you are.\n\nWhat other sport do you see professionals riding at 10-20mph+ with no helmet or other protection?\n\nSet the example. It's so important as electric skateboarding starts to become mainstream, and more and more people use them as commuter vehicles that they're aware an e-board is potentially a very dangerous vehicle, which you must respect and ride courteously and safely.\n\nEnsure a rock solid connection between the board and remote. I mean put everything they've got into eliminating any kind of interference as number one priority, minimising the need for re-pairing or remote replacement, especially in busy city environments where interference is most prone. If they continue as is with so many newly delivered boards needing adjustments, then it's only a matter of time before someone get seriously hurt, and I dread that. It starts to make it difficult for me to recommend the board to friends.\n\nEven if it is the rider's fault in an accident, it's hard to clarify and be certain of that when there's doubt over the reliability of the original product. Eliminate that doubt, and when there are accidents, it's easier to analyse and educate the rider without having to blame the manufacturer.\n\nI'm rooting for them big time, but they need to get on it and deliver a promise of safety and reliability. Their after market support is stellar and I love the community. But if they're able to get on top of things from the factory it would make all the difference, and hopefully avoid any major catastrophes that may or may not otherwise arise with their existing product lineup."
