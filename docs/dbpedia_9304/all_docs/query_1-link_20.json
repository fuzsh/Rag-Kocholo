        "text": "Hey everyone thanks in advance for checking out and chiming in.\n\nAlrighty so I purchased a Ownboard bamboo AT (150 mm honeycomb and 120 cloud). Didnâ€™t do my proper research and now stuck with a paperweight. Iâ€™m already past trying to warranty or purchase parts from them. It seems the ESC has some crazy voltage regulator problems and I canâ€™t get the board to stay on, volts drop to 8v as soon as motor spins. So armed with my limited knowledge and endless thirst of impulse buying , I set off on a journeyâ€¦\n\nFlipsky 4.2 mini (two ESCâ€™s)\n\nMico jst 2.0 ph 4 pin connector\n\nXt60 connectors\n\nM.2 heatsinks (x4 already have these)\n\n180a anti spark (with on/off switch)\n\nFlipsky VX2 remote (for V4)\n\nSo the plan was to replace the speed controller but Iâ€™m quickly realizing this is all over my head. Also flipsky might be as crappy as ownboardâ€™s hobbywing Frankenstein. The battery is 10s4p sanyo Ga cells. Ownboardâ€™s two stock Motors 6368 170Kv 1500 Watt.\n\nIâ€™m just a bit lostâ€¦ Is that the right cable for the canbus? Itâ€™s it suggested to actually plug in ESC to ESC or do you splice the remote wires to each ESC? The Esk8 Calc suggests 40a cont.- 80a max, does that sound right for battery and mini ESC? To get specs of motor, I run a detection in program tool with belts off? Just programming this thing in general is hurting my brain.\n\nThanks for any input and sorry for my ignorance LoL\n\nyou run the ESC together with this pin connecting the two.\n\nyou then set one to be the master and one to be slave.\n\nit does sound like you have quite the project lol. iâ€™m not familiar with ownboard but if theyâ€™re like a few other brands youâ€™re not going to be able to use the battery unless youâ€™re using the matching ESC from themâ€¦ iâ€™m sure some more experienced guys can chime in\n\nYes I contacted them. I believe Iâ€™ll be receiving a complete New setup or refund. It came completely DOA. Their CS is actually pretty good but Iâ€™m seeing tons of broken batteries and/or ESC on the bamboo deck.\n\nYes I have multimeter but limited electronic knowledge.\n\nIâ€™ve Opened enclosure, connected multimeter to Â± in-between battery and ESC, @ 38v, turned on board, connected remote, accelerate, volts drop to 9 then start to build back up to ~38, try again with same result\n\nThen Iâ€™ve disconnected xt60 connecting the ESC, disconnected mt60â€™s connecting motors. Mulitmeter in between each 4packs, try to wiggle/bend battery enclosure (everything is coated in some resinðŸ’€), voltage seemed stableâ€¦\n\nPlugged in ESC, voltage drop.\n\nCut Â± wires from switch, tie together, ~37v, plugged in ESC xt60, voltage drop to 8v\n\nI feel like Iâ€™m the receptionist at the doctorâ€™s office trying to diagnose you lol"
