        "text": "Got a nice credit discount from the closing of the msuk loyalty scheme, so i thought i'd treat myself to the new Spektrum DX4S.\n\nmainly bought this as i prefer pistol grip radios and i need the 4th channel to run lights on my tamiya hilux which has a manual gearbox on it.\n\nwith the normal switches you get on the dx3c/r/s and the lcd display you find on the dx3r/s there isn't much difference in terms of looks or feel, the clear change is the silver plastic has been replaced with black.\n\nthe other change is the intergrated transmiter ariel, no more thin and flimsy stick poking out that you can catch and break off, its all moulded into the case, this also features an additional led in it when powered on so you can tell if you have lef tit on by mistake without having to look at the power button, usful if you put your tx on the floor or a low bench.\n\nthe rx unit (fitted to my tamiya high lift hilux model on the left, dx3c rx on the right)\n\napart from the expected extra port for the 4th channel, labeled aux2, the nex 4ch rx unit is smaller than the sr300 the dx3c came with, it also sports a longer ariel which exits the side of the casing, looks like this is a plan to improve the range issues i'm told alot about all the time, i think a little test of this will be in order.\n\nas i had my hilux apart i thought it a good time to fit and set it up. the bind process is like all spekkys these days, plug in rx, turn on, press bind in tx menu, very straight forward, this is suposed to be able to bind with older 3ch rx units aswell, somthing i will be doing later as this rx will eventualy run my entire rc fleet.\n\nthe lcd display is (thankfully) back lit to make it easy to read when your diddling with it, it is also adjustable in the settings of the tx, it will turn on at the push of a button, either to turn it on so you can read voltage or model name, or if you are making an adjustment.\n\nyou can also have it on all the time, always off, or set it to turn off after a chose amount of time (5 to 60 seconds) to save on battery power.\n\nthere are 2 menu options, standard and expert.\n\nstandard shows only the common settings:\n\nexpert gives you all the bells and whistles the systems has to offer. somthing i had to make full use of to get everything to work on my hilux model.\n\nthere is a option on the menu of \"telemetry\", you have no such ports on the 4ch rx so this is presumably for the 3ch rx, a 4ch telemetry rx in the future probably isn't to unlikly either.\n\nediting the setting of the tx is like any other spektrum radio, use the toggle roller to select and change the settings, bind the rx to tx, etc, etc.\n\ni have run the hilux on my bedroom floor, and all is working as it should, aswell as it all being set up and ready for a field test to see how it goes.\n\nso far, Likes:\n\nintergrated tx ariel\n\nsmaller rx with long ariel\n\nbacklit lcd display\n\nled on top when on\n\nDislikes:\n\nplastic feels very cheap\n\nmenu navigation is alittle annoying with toggle switch\n\nsteering wheel tension is not adjustable\n\ni shall leave it here for now, will come back again with a more final tohught after i've got some more use out of it.\n\nthink i covered all i can, but if anyone thinks of something please say so\n\nEdited January 7, 2013 by Thunderwolf\n\ni went out with this and the hilux yesterday.\n\nit performs just aswell as the dx3c for the hilux, control was easy and it did what i wanted without question.\n\nalso gave the range a test, went 1.5 to 2 lenths of a football pitch, small truck and i think i could have gone further but i struggled to see it on what i tohught was a fairly flat field. the rx arial is a good inch or two longer than the sr300 and it no doubt helps with the range.\n\nfor scale, trail and crawling i got no problem saying if you need a 4ch radio then the dx4s is a winner.\n\nnow i'll be seeing if this with bind to my hpi baja, see how it does with a 15.5kg 45mph 1/5th buggy, where resonce time at distance is more important and where settings need to be correct. i think so anyway.\n\nso far so good, but the cheap fell to this transmiter is still bothering me, love the small rx though, would be good i radio boxes with limited space, hpi baja and traxxas slash 4x4 come to mind here.\n\ni shall update this thread after a thorough test.\n\ncan you mix 2 throttle channels on the dx4 so i could use one for my xr10 crawler\n\nI assume you mean runnig a dual ESC setup with front and rear dig and proportional speed controll over each axle????\n\nI have had a little look into this and yes it would seem you can but you will need to do it using 4 buttons on the remote not like the two that could be used on say a 4pl. On one of the american crawler sites someone has done it and put a thing up showing the programming steps, If i can i will find the link.\n\nIts the big question that has stopped me getting one of these already. now i know you can do it. its the question of can i live with 4 buttons. I was going to ask the guy in the states if he can post a video of the functionallity. just to check its what i want before i go away and sepnd my hard earned.\n\nAlso another thought is that with the SD slot Spektrum might realise their mistake and work on a program specifically for doing it which can be updated through the firmware. Thats what i would do it i were them as it sounds like they missed a trick.\n\nEdited February 19, 2013 by darkangelv24"
