        "text": "Rock band\n\nDualesc was an American four-piece rock band from Portland, Oregon, United States. The band was active from 1998 to 2006.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nDualesc formed in 1998, composed of singer Matt McMillan, guitarist Bryon Deisher and bassist Adam Hubka. Their original drummer, Tim Steiner, left in 1999 and was replaced by Marshall Tipton shortly thereafter. The band went through a couple early band names before eventually settling on Dualesc, a word the band created that was inspired by the idea of Cartesian Dualism. Dualesc recorded their first CD Oscillations in 2000. The disc eventually got into the hands of Richard Patrick from the band Filter. Patrick invited them to Chicago to record at his Abyssinian Sons Studios. Produced by Richard Patrick and Rae Dileo, Dualesc recorded an EP in early 2001 at the studio. Patrick liked the band so much that he played guitar on the song \"Belief\".[1]\n\nIn early 2002, Dualesc was signed to Rise Records.[2] They re-mastered the Richard Patrick EP and included six new songs for what would be their album titled Through the Floods, Not With Them.[3]\n\nDualesc independently recorded and released their third release, titled Palisade Layer, in 2003. It included six new songs and a re-recording of an older song from Oscillations featuring a guest appearance from Chris Ruff of Kaddisfly on the song \"I Don't Even Know You.\"[4]\n\nIn 2004, Dualesc's bassist Adam Hubka left the band and was replaced by Rob Hillis. The new lineup spent the summer of 2004 in the studio working on their final album titled Lhasa the Birdcatcher - but the record never saw an official release and is not known to have been available for purchase. All of the songs from this album are now available for streaming through the band's website.[5]\n\nDualesc played a handful of shows in Portland during 2004 and 2005 before eventually fading into hiatus sometime around 2006.\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nOscillations (2000)\n\nSaltbase Solutions (2001)\n\nThrough the Floods, Not With Them (2002)\n\nPalisade Layer (2003)\n\nLhasa the Birdcatcher (2005)\n\nCompilation album\n\n[edit]\n\nRise Records 2004 Sampler (2004)\n\nVideos and audio recordings\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are a handful of live concert videos from the band's 2004 US Tour that can be found online.[6][7][8]\n\nBand members\n\n[edit]\n\nMatt McMillan - vocals (1998–2006)\n\nBryon Deisher - guitar (1998–2006)\n\nMarshall Tipton - drums (1999–2006)\n\nRob Hillis - bass (2004–2006)\n\nAdam Hubka - bass (1998–2004)\n\nTim Steiner - drums (1998)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
