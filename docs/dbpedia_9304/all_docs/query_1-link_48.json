Leave them switched on all the time and have a seperate power switch. Work with the programming card.\n\nPerfect speed controller for my purposes\n\nAlthough this ESC is designed for car/buggy use, it works perfectly for me in a scale model warship (1/96 scale model of USS Long Beach, CGN-9). I use brushed motors (two geared to each of two propeller shafts) and Lipo batteries so this dual motor ESC is perfect for me. And it functions exactly as I had hoped. I'm so pleased with it that I purchased two more for use in future model ship projects.\n\nPerfect boat controller\n\nI will use the controller for a three motor rc boat (robbe buchhorn). The two main motors are connected to the controller.\n\nEasy set up via programm card. I will use a 4s 3000mAh battery for long run time, but need lower voltage at motors. Easy maximun voltage setting for foreward and backward scale speed.\n\nUnfortunately to much ice on pont due to the winter time.\n\nWill start maiden cruise in spring."
