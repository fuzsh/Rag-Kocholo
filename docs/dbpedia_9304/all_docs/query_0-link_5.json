Just listen to their classic \"Last bridge\" and you will understand! 4 AINA bipartite CD Nowadays we hope that most of you know the most veteran post-hardcore Spanish band. But in case you don t, we honestly recommend that you pick up any of AINA's records. This third album confirms that they are probably the best at combining thick rock guitar riffs and Washington DC style beats and melodies. Do you like Burning Airlines, Bluetip or Wool?. Released on Vinyl through Green Hell. 5 HALF FOOT OUTSIDE new ad. ideas CD Third record, first on BCore, from this band born in Pamplona. They keep on evolving into new sounds of melodic post- hardcore between Jawbreaker melodies and DC rocking style, from Aina to Bluetip. Eleven songs combining high energy and a dynamic and personal composition. Their best work ever. This is the time to discover them if you still haven't. 6 MAPLE I ZEIDUN oceane CD A split CD. Zeidun have left behind their clear Get Up Kids influences to get into an excellent new bunch of songs that will stick on you immediately. More mature and complex but still so catchy. Maple make their debut with 6 songs of energetic pop with emo sensibility. Their singer, Laura, gets deep into their poppiest side while the rhythm section, guitars and production keeps rooted on post-punk energy. 7 THE UNFINISHED SYMPATHY CD From Barcelona, this guys will gently surprise you with these eleven songs brilliantly combining elements from emo and indie rock, not so far from Jets To Brazil, Errortype: 11, Chamberlain or Joshua, but with an amazing personal point of view. Brilliant production with a energetic sound, this band will rock you and touch your heart at the same time. Check it out. 8 STANDSTILL the ionic spell CD Stand Still are one of the most powerful Spanish bands. \"The ionic spell\" picks up all the energy from their first recordings and puts it together in songs that go from abrasive emocore to quiet atmospheres. With a brilliant production, they sound stronger than ever. Their shows with bands like At the drive in, Abhinanda, Submission Hold, Sheregano, E-150, Seein red or Monochrome just demonstrate that quality. Released on Vinyl through Defiance. 3 STANDSTILL the tide CD Sometimes an unknown band knocks on your door, gives you a humble CDr with a bunch of songs and at the very first listen you get totally charmed. Because good taste flows from every downtempo beat, every late night atmosphere, every beautiful melody of this album. Sunny Day Real Estate meets The Cure while Mineral links with Radiohead, Echo & The Bunnymen, Cobolt or early U2. The perfect record for that perfect night we always wish to have... 2 NO MORE LIES ][ CD Allright... they're not the most productive and working band on earth Three years to write their new songs! But who cares if they come back with such an astonishing record like this More complex, melodic and demolishing than ever, the Sant Feliu de Guixols based trio has given its best, not only in the production but in the making of a bunch of great songs inspired by Fugazi, Regulator Watts, Kepone or even Hot Water Music.

He was undergoing chemotherapy which we hoped would give him time to travel and fulfil some of his dreams. Unfortunately he contracted a series of viral infections which, in his weakened state, have proved fatal. Jon died peacefully in his sleep on Thursday 7th February 2002 at 1 0: 1 5am at University College Hospital London (UCL). His Mother and I were with him and we are very proud of his achievements in his all-to- brief life. Peter & Brenda Kay His funeral was held on Thursday 14th February at Grantham Crematorium. It was both uplifting and unbearably sad at the same time. It was a short humanist service, beginning with the Star Wars theme, Jon's Dad then talked about his sons life, then his old English teacher read out a poem she’d written about him. Some messages were read out then Andy read a short extract from one of Jon's Fracture columns and finally - Firehose’s Things Could Turn Around’. Everybody was trying to observe Jon's wishes about it not being a sombre occasion but in one way that just made it even sadder. What I felt all day was just how much we are gonna miss him. Jon’s wishes were that you were inspired by his life to help others. rm *»cmo«r houm w»t Please consider donating blood and / or bone marrow to aid other Leukaemia sufferers: National Blood Service - www.blood.co.uk The Anthony Nolan Trust - www.anthonynolan.com ‘A gathering was hastily arranged, as it was the weekend and I would be returning to hospital on the Monday. We decided to have a bonfire party, and many of my closest friends made it over. It was a truly special time forme, to be with my family and friends, the people I love most in the world. I even managed to ignore the fact that I twice had to check myself into the local hospital for diamorphme delivered pain relief during the day. / chose to remember the fireworks we fit, the smiling faces and good company’’. Jon, you always made me look at things in a new light, take things that one step further, challenge my own beliefs and my own perpsective. You made me feel stronger, wiser, more alive. You were so brave, Jon, and so intuitive. So passionate and so driven. As soon as you spoke, people stopped to listen. You would have been an amazing journalist. You would have changed the world. I just know it. I feel so lucky that you changed mine. I'll never forget you, Jon. None of us will. Your raised eyebrows and that cynical half-smile of yours when someone said something you didn’t quite agree with. . . your contagious laughter. . . that pause you would allow after everything you heard, taking it all in, thinking of your next rebuttal. Jon, you amazed us all. And you inspired us. The friendships you forged in your short life are so much stronger than death. So much more lasting. Thank you for everything you showed me, Jon. I’ll keep you with me always. If you have a message or any thoughts to share with the people that knew Jon, please sign the guestbook at Jon’s website: www.jkay.net I’m gonna miss him like a lot of folks are. He had those fine qualities that I cherish in human nature; honesty, intelligence, love and passion (not to mention a wicked sense of humour and cynicism which fell into line with my own sick sense). There was no flannel with Jon, he told you what he thought regardless. Heaven forbid if you misquoted someone or mis-told a fact. Jon knew the answer... sometimes he was too bloody smart! With his passion and quest for knowledge he deserved to live a long life, he had the talent to educate others and words cannot convey how sad it is that those opportunities will never come. I’m upset about losing him as a friend and as a pillar of information. From the economy, to politics, even down to the pros & cons of Playstation 2 ... he knew it all, the perfect phone a friend choice. Gonna miss you my friend and I’m not the only one. One of the good guys and an inspiration to us all. I was always impressed with everything you put your hand to. You were inspiring, not only in your strength and resolve during your ordeal, but in the avenues of literature and music that you opened up for me (and I’m sure many others). You would always give as much time as you could spare to people and that’s a rare thing. You know what? There’s all these people going round with little bits, little memories and experi- ences, their own little pieces of Shoes, many of whom you would never even meet. And that’s an encouraging thought... because to all the people who were lucky enough to have known you or known of you, you’ll never really be gone.

Monk Dave, Cardiff, March 2002. This has been, without a doubt, THE MOST DIFFICULT INTRODUCTION I HAVE EVER HAD TO WRITE, BUT IT’S SOMETHING THAT I VERY MUCH WANTED TO DO NEVERTHELESS. As MANY OF YOU WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE AWARE OF BY NOW, OUR FRIEND AND FRACTURE COLUMNIST Jon Kay (aka “Shoes”) lost his long FOUGHT BATTLE AGAINST LEUKAEMIA ON THE 7TH of February this year. As YOU WOULD PROBABLY EXPECT, THE THOUGHT OF WORKING TO THIS ISSUE S DEADLINE PRETTY MUCH WENT OUT OF THE WINDOW FOR ALL OF US FOR A WHILE, ESPECIALLY AS THIS WAS TO BE OUR “CELEBRATORY” 4 YEAR, 20th issue special. But as deadline got NEARER AND NEARER, EVERYONE (AND I MEAN everyone) really came together for us to MAKE THIS THE BEST ISSUE OF FRACTURE THAT WE HAVE EVER PRODUCED. T HE UNIFIED EFFORTS OF EVERYONE INVOLVED WITH FRACTURE, AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM SOME NEW FACES, HAVE, TO BE HONEST, REALLY BLOWN OUR MINDS. It made us realise just how much CAN ACHIEVE WHEN THEY GIVE IT EVERYTHING they’ve got and just “get on with it . And so yes, this issue is a CELEBRATION IN A WAY - IT’S A CELEBRATION OF Jon’s life, of the immense amount of joy HE BROUGHT TO OTHERS - To HIS FRIENDS, FAMILY AND THE MANY PEOPLE THAT DIDN’T HIM PERSONALLY BUT WHO READ HIS COLUMNS AND GOT AS MUCH OUT OF THEM AS WE DID. I REMEMBER JON ONCE TOLD ME THE THING HE ACTUALLY LIKED MOST ABOUT Fracture was the layouts, which made me LAUGH AT THE TIME, BUT STILL MEANT SO MUCH AS WELL. And so that’s why (just in case YOU WERE WONDERING) WE’VE REALLY GONE TO TOWN ON THE DESIGN THIS ISSUE. SURE WASTED SOME SPACE HERE AND THERE, BUT WE DID IT BECAUSE WE WANTED TO. We DID IT FOR Jon, and this entire issue is for him. So THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO PICK UP AND READ THIS 20TH EDITION OF OUR HUMBLE PUNK ROCK FANZINE - IT MEANS MORE TO US THAN YOU COULD EVER IMAGINE SO SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE REST OF THIS ISSUE AND WE’LL BE SEEING YOU ALL NEXT TIME. ■■ .

Artistic wizardry by Var Thelin. PRINT RUN: 5,000 (and then some) though it shames me to say it), have boy- cotted products here and there and have ar- gued long into the night in defence of these ideals. Aside from birthdays, the other thing that brought all this to mind was an encounter recently with a guy who (at the risk of sound- ing patronizing) is a lot like I used to be. He talks about Cuba incessantly, and it’s unreal- istic and dull; he constantly clutched a peti- tion to ban something or other... the cliches go on. He’s a nice guy, but I was repelled by his politics, and then confused by the realiza- tions that I did the same not so long ago. So, the result of all this pondering is the follow- ing tract about leftist ideas and my problems with them. Of course that’s a massively broad thing to talk about, a generalization that isn’t too flat tering to those to whom it refers. But I think I can agree with Ted Kaczynski in saying leftism is not so much a movement or an ideology as a psychological type”. And sure, Kaczynski (the Unabomber) was a crazy fucker, but his manifesto has some moments of insight, and I think his discourse on left- ism is instructive. Essentially his point is that leftism, with its accompanying incessant ac tivism and belief in the potential for good of ‘human nature’ is a mindset that requires a fair old dash of self-loathing and escapism. It’s worth reading, and you can find it easily enough online (do a search on Unabomber, duh). Another comment that got me thinking was made by Milan Kundera. He writes often of ‘The Great March’ of leftism - the combi- nation of a lifestyle of continual activism and demonstration with a Whiggish (oh the irony) view of history as a great progression of ideas towards some utopian ideal that can be for- warded by the aforementioned action. Kundera is dismissive of leftism through his own ex- periences with the occupation and subjuga- tion of his home country (Czechoslovakia) - the incessant demonstrations ring too familiar a bell for someone who has experienced the forced public celebrations of an authoritarian regime. Any of his stuff is worth picking up and reading, if only for the fantastic prose and imagery. political activity (I’m not), then you have to take account of everyone, because, like it or not, politics is about conflict resolution among the entire population. If a ‘leftist’, working class or whatever group should seize political power, you’re immediately in a situation of factionalism. The question arises: what to do with people who don’t follow leftist ideas in a leftist state? Because like it or not they will exist and they do have to be accounted for Of course this criticism can apply across the political spectrum, and ‘conservatives’ suffer the same problem. And of course political labels can be helpful in defining one’s stance in a readily interpretable way. But the criti- cism stands for active groups that this fac- tionalist labeling can only be divisive and counter-productive. One might also point out the idiocy of some of the labeling - if you’re starting a new group, please don ’t call it People for Libertarian Struggle or other such crap (and actually, please don’t bother at all). All his is then accompanied by a whole host of related problems - ever seen an animal rights activist scuppered by the reply ‘I don’t care’? It’s interesting, because such a reply to in- cessant questions about animal suffering is consistent and perfectly tenable. From there one can go on to condemn this person out of hand for (let’s be honest) having a different viewpoint, but if one is serious about achiev- ing political goals such ideas have to be taken into account, and if one claims to be toler- ant... well, that’s a whole other argument. The ‘class war’ is immediately divisive (ob- viously) - what about those of us born onto the other side of the divide (myself included) - 1 didn’t ask for rich parents. I hope this is going to end up as something more than a recommended reading list though, so let’s get onto some of what I thought about all this (hey, you’re the one reading the col- umn...). Politically speaking, a serious finger can be pointed at an issue with begins with names. ‘Communism’, ‘anarchism’, ‘leftism’; I’m not going to go into a piss-take of politi- cal infighting on the left (it’s been done better before). I merely think it’s worth pointing out that not only do people divide themselves with names this way, they divide themselves from the rest of the world in a hopelessly escapist way. If you are interested in serious We can go on; I am constantly enraged by leftist calls for banning or abolishing this or that. These ideas are totally authoritarian, and as someone concerned over the idea of liberty they trouble me. The constant appeal to the potential benevolence of human nature amuses me - surely a change based on such a premise either has to be so distant as not to be worth thinking about, or is just plain unrealistic (work a till job for a while, you’ll see what I mean). The glorification of mass popular protest is a joke - the other day I was standing in a crowd with someone holding a banner reading “There’s never been a good war or a bad peace”. I was tempted to venture that this moron had never read a book, but I didn’t think it was worth the effort. I was annoyed because by being part of that crowd my opin- ions and beliefs were, to the observer, sub- sumed with those of this fuckwit. There is a general lack of concern for individual free- dom, both physical and mental, in a lot of leftist ideology. Whether admitted or not, a lot of future visions of society rest on the idea that someday everyone will magically come to agree on the ideas this society is based on (see above for skillful demolition of that idea). Accompanying this disregard for personal political ‘quirks’, we come across the disregard for reality in a lot of leftist dis- course. Isn’t it fun to pretend that the major- ity of the dirt on Stalin was propaganda from the anti-Communist West? Well, maybe, but the fact remains that (even though the West was just as biased and political in their media and histories) Stalin was a fucker. That’s a more extreme example, but it extends to a more general malaise of historical tippexing that has brushed up the resumes of many, including Mao, Lenin, Castro and others. I’m not saying all these people were monsters, simply that they were a long, long way from perfect. And the established school of Marx- ist history can hopefully be dismissed with little ado (I once read a book called “The Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World” - I mean, just fuck offi). While we’re on the subject of leftist intellectual authoritarianism, we can also mention the fact that the actual scope for political variation is limited. I ended up making myself feel guilty for reading Edmund Burke and agreeing with a fair amount of what he said. Does this make me the anti-Christ? Am I kicked out of the leftist club? I love T S Elliot, and I love Tolkien, both of whom spent a lot of time castigating the threats of the modern era embodied (for them) by the USSR. Better hand in my grade 3 left-wing badge... I could, naturally, go on for a lot longer. But no fear. I’m going to shut up pretty soon. I hope, though, that my point has become clear in all this - the broad mass of ideologies, strategies and approaches that come under the title of ‘leftism’ aren’t 100% bullshit, but they certainly aren’t totally great either - a revela- tion that those wedded to such philosophies try hard to suppress. I refer to the Crimethinc book (a group who, though sound in some of their criticisms, suffer from the same prob- lems themselves a lot of the time): “The su- permarket of ideas is good for only one thing: shoplifting. ” What you (hypocrite lecteur, mon sembable, mon frere) might take away from all this, I would hope, would be a greater cynicism. But I’m not here to hold anyone’s hand - figure it out for yourselves. Ok, a couple of things before I go - some more music-related comments. Everyone check out WE CLOSE OUR EYES, from Nor- wich, they are the best hardcore band in the UK right now. Electronica continues to take over my life - keep an eye out for DNTEL’s new record ‘Life is Full of Possibilities’. PIG DESTROYER will kill you, if they haven’t already. Reading Henry David Thoreau right now, it’s killer. Those of you so inclined can send abuse to me via my website (shameless plug!): www.shantih.org.uk. Bye for now. COLUMNS >» Fracture #20 | Page 09 some homophobic, bigoted, sexist Neanderthal doing the same. Off course my daughter may reject everything I believe in, like I did with my own parents and I’m sure a lot of you reading this will have done the same. But you never know I’m a pretty positive and optimistic | person most of the time -so I live in hope. If something is going to happen, then I usually worry about it when it does, unless I can do something to avoid it. Hi Folks, hope you all had a really neat Christmas and got everything that you wanted off Santa. This year was special for me, my first being a father - more on that later. I guess you’ll have noticed that this is the fourth anniversary of Fracture and with it being issue 20 I think it’s pretty fucking amazing - especially all the flack that it got in the early days. Those who appreciated it kept their mouth shut and just enjoyed it for what it was. I happen to like anniversaries and the like. Birthdays etc, in mind, they are a time when friends get together and celebrate the occasion. They usually, if they are enjoyed, awaken fond memories of what you were doing or what happened to you at this point some years ago or whatever. With Fracture in mind, I regard this magazine as being Dave and Russ’, with all their little helpers. You know when you think of Christmas, apart from the bills, well you think of Santa and not all those little folks who help him. What are you laughing at, does no one believe in Santa any more? Ha, ha. Well where would he be without his little helpers. Their former ‘zines, Mad Monks and Charred Remains were two of the better ones floating about at the time. I even started writing a wee column for Mad Monks and then it evolved in Fracture, time flies, Bob’s your uncle and I’m still here, still enjoying the ride. Although I’ve never met either of them. I’m in the belief that they are two crazy dudes. Judging from what they’ve written in ‘zines and correspondence via email they are two rich personalities. Having said that. Fracture has a multitude of personalities, at times we’ve fuck all in common apart from the love of hardcore punk - thank fuck. Anyway, congratulations Dave and Russ, despite putting up with all the shit that gets thrown at them they still continue - let the years roll by. Time to celebrate. PARENTHOOD : Since I wrote in a column of Fracture about becoming a father I’ve had mixed responses some positive, some negative - the latter being hard to believe. So is parenthood punk rock or not? I can see people thinking about the earth being over populated and I guess that’s where most of the negative feelings would come from. Along with, why on earth would you want to bring a child into a world like this? Well I would rather bring up a child, with a bit of influence from me, rather than THE RISE OF EUROCORE : No, I’m not talking about the single European currency, but European hardcore punk. As I’m usually standing from the outside looking in as regards various scenes, seeing as I don’t live there. I tend you judge what I see by the records / CD’s that are released or from each country’s respective ‘zines. I noticed a steady rise in enthusiasm and respect for European hardcorepunk. Especially in the Americas, where people once wouldn’t touch European bands with a barge pole - sad but true. The tables have turned and there are lots of great bands about these days unleashing uncompromising brutal hardcore, taking no shit and with a real positive approach - under all that negative posturing. I just got the new HIGHSCORE LP, who are from Germany and play fast and frantic 80’ s hardcore, with a real burst of enthusiasm and energy. They have really great lyrics and I have a real itching to interview them. Their LP is on the Canadian label Deranged Records, whose first release was an LP by the mighty DS13, which I’m sure some of you should be familiar as there was an interyiew with them a few issues ago. They also released a 7” by said band. You should be familiar with the OUTCOLD/ VOORHEES split CD that came out on Blackfish, well it has been re-released on vinyl, complete with different artwork - surely a must for vinyl addicts out there. It seems Deranged has a fetish for Swedish hardcore they’ve also issued the vinyl version of the mighty INTENSITY’S last CD. Staying with Sweden, you should be aware of the frantic hardcore that E.T.A. produces after their mighty live shows during their UK tour last year, yep they are also on Deranged It’s not entirely a secret, but Havoc Records have been putting out stuff by non- US bands for years. Then again Felix has always being a world wide hardcore freak anyway. Last year the put out DS13’s second LP / CD “Killed By The Kids”, the follow up to the LP / CD mentioned above. Great frantic hardcore, nothing new from them, but you wouldn’t want anything new as they just do what they know best - that’s why they continue to give me goose bumps. They also repressed DS13’s debut 7 ’ and released the split 7” with Felix’s own CODE 13. After a couple of 7” ’s on Commitment Records, Holland’s VITAMIN X released their third 7”. Loosing some of their youth crew charm, but replacing it with real old school influences. I heard, from a good source, that they’d be doing a huge US tour soon. They should be used to it after their shows there last year. Only recently Sweden’s SKITS YSTEM - Enkel Resa Till Rannstenen” LP has been released, but as yet I haven’t got it. But judging from their past releases it’ll be manic crust - in the best possible taste. Well you see what I thought of this in the reviews section. Still with Havoc, but a US band. Ever wonder what happened to the mighty BROTHER INFERIOR, well Chad’s in a new band called ASSEMBLY OF GOD, and their debut 7” continues where the former left off, albeit not as fast - but definitely still as powerful and earth moving. Chad has informed me that they could be changing their name, due to some shit from the powers that be. I’ll be interested to see how that sorts itself out. We all know know what a Euro hardcore freak Max 625 (aka whatever it is this week). Well out of the ashes of RIPCORD is DUMBSTRUCK, who’s debut 7” was reviewed by yours truly, have their debut 12” out on 625. It’s a split release by new label Crime Scene, the label by SAWN OFF vocalist Graham and who used to co-run Blind Destruction Records. This is hardcore. Their debut 7” is going to be repressed by Deranged Records and I believe they are going to release their second 7” with them. Wey hey!

Even though this is happening, the European hardcore scene has been going from day one and it’s been those dedicated folks behind the labels, zines, gig spaces, collectives and the bands that actually produce the classic tunes that make us dance like silly fools in the first place.

Mel Hughes / Direct Hit, PO Box 36, Armagh, BT60 3PQ, Northern Ireland E-mail : barcod@freenetname.co.uk “We all live underground , underground where it stays warm, community with common sounds we work together to break ground” - Hot Water Music. Community? Is it present or possible in today’s world and society. It has long been an anarchist view that society is best organised through small scale communities representa tive of their members. The classic form of these is geographical with people taking con trol of the resources available to them in their local area. This would enable people to use their land and labour to benefit themselves rather than others, right? But how do we construct such com munities in a world which is increasingly geo- graphically fragmented? Where you know people miles away better than you know your neighbors? It can clearly be seen that com- munities have been eroded in our country sig- nificantly (I admit I cannot speak for the rest of the world, I’ve never been there). Com- munity does exist but it struggles against a rising tide of mobility. Why has this shift occurred? I believe one of the major causes of this shift is work. How many people have moved for a job? This is seen in bright technicolour in London where (myself included) people flock to live in order to spend their days travelling in discomfort to a 5 mile area where they can make others money for little personal gain This is repeated in most large urban areas, pulling communities apart. I however can only speak of this from the my point of view of course, I am a university graduate and there fore this is what graduates do right? And so that’s why you get a degree to get a better job in a large urban area, before moving back to the suburbs or beyond to have kids and so on, isn’t it? Don’t get me wrong I’m not saying we shouldn’t move or migrate, but the world at the moment encourages us to do so in terms of work which erodes communities by con- tinually changing who is able and willing to participate within them. Perhaps we should stop and address why we move around so much and if its really necessary or good to on a long term basis. I am aware that this is not the case of all, I am different in that I have lived in 5 different towns, in 8 different houses and been to 3 schools, 1 University and worked 6 jobs, that’s in 22 years. In that time I have probably met over 1000 distinct individual people of which at least 100 1 would say were friends. How many communities that had a bearing on the world I lived in was I involved in? At a push I would say 1 , and that was during my time at university. That community only really encompassed my col- lege within the university and so was pretty isolated from the ‘real world’, the actions and decisions of that community didn’t really trouble the rest of the university, town much let alone the mainstream of society (oh and it was Durham Uni if you’re interested, judge of that what you may). But on a local scale I believe that community did do a lot of good in terms of improving the college and repre senting student views and ideas on how their surroundings and ‘uni life’ should be. Many people I have spoken to have achieved my age and beyond without once being involved in any form of community. Why is this if in my eyes we can identify communities as fulfilling important positive functions in lives (although I freely admit they do have negative aspects, gossip being a par- ticularly nasty one)? So how do we form communities of our own? Is our scene a community? The punk and hardcore scene does have some basis in com munity that is clear. It is based on common interest among it’s members, music in place of the local environment that bonds geo- graphically localised communities. From this common bond has sprung the ‘community spirit’ to take things into our own hands in terms of organisation, and we often bypass age differences a key ingredient in sustaining communities. But for a group of people who preach inclusion we isolate often in our ac- tions and behaviors. We are quick to judge people who are not members of our ‘scene’ or who do not wish to become heavily in- volved, whilst seeking reward (be it money, kudos or dare I say it celebrity) for the ‘hard- work’ we have done. Communities though differ from our scene more clearly though in the fact that they span a large gamut of varying social inter- ests. Local communities often cover music, theatre, art, print media and politics. They also are catalysts for the exchange of ideas, skills and services. Our scene is born from music but why can we not expand that to create a real community? We have our own print media and some groups are involved in art, theatre and politics but these are often still clearly music based. Why just put on a gig, could we not expand our horizons? We have seen successful spoken word tours by both Jello Biafra and Henry Rollins, does no one in the UK have a voice and wish to in- form others on a subject, or are we all vic- tims of the cult of [punk rock] celebrity? In terms of the exchange of ideas and skills we have a firm base with many fruitful partner- ships and group projects, however I feel there is still scope for more. This is not meant to be an attack on the scene, in a world that is increasingly geo- graphically fragmented and where communi- ties ace stretched and attacked by the overall society we live in, the scene provides prob- ably our best hope to improve our lives and bring about significant change in arenas and realms that we feel strongly about. Many of you may not agree with me on the points raised here, so e-mail me any thoughts and abuse to me at benny _boy35@hotmail.com I admit that my naked idealism of- ten needs temperance but I purely wish to see some more thought amongst us (myself in- cluded) in how we can improve our lives through the only community that is apparent and available to us. You may say it's just a sound, but I know there’s more than just a soundtrack that keeps people coming round” - Dillinger Four. Mr. Bush reportedly said he did not want the allies making conditions. “At some point we may be the only ones left, ” Mr. Bush says. “That’s OK with me. We are America. ” COLUMNS >>> Just when you think things can’t get worse, they always do. I think I figured out the guiding political strategy of the Bush administration: push as hard as you can, in every direction. Very simple, and so far, frighteningly effective. In every arena the Bush adminis- tration steps in, they stun the world oppo- nents and allies alike with their brazen tenac- ity for far-reaching go-it-alone plans. Plans so bold, so audacious, so absolutely crass, everyone is caught by surprise. From pulling out of a host of inter- national treaties to dodging ties to Enron to circumventing abortion rights, it just never Fracture #20 | Page 11 ends. Everyday is a new horror show. And that’s exactly the administration’s plan. If they keep pushing on all fronts their opponents cannot mount an effective defense. Does you want to fight against the withdraw of the ABM treaty, the Kyoto treaty or how about Bush’s ham-fisted “axis of evil\" proclamation? If none of those suit you, how about the war crimes committed by the U.S. military in Afghanistan? Or the treatment of the prisoners of war being held in Cuba, Af- ghanistan and Pakistan, as well as those be ing held on naval vessels in the Middle East? Or how about those rounded up in the U.S. , post-Sept. 11th that are still being held in se cret? Still not taking the bait? How about the U.S. (non) policy towards resolving the Israeli/Palestine conflict? If you get down to it, that’s really what’s fueling so many of the fires burning around the world. Solving this could quell much of the volatility around the world. If Bush really wanted to fight terrorism, he would crack down on Israel. But then, then I guess there’s a fine distinction between solving a problem and fighting. Rather than trying to resolve why so many terrorists target the U.S. and other Western countries, we are just going to fight, fight, fight. Go team! Go! Sorry about that little tangent Anyway, did you hear the one about how the Bush administration has passed a number of administrative policies that pro vide health care for “unborn children?” Never mind that a stark number of born children don’t have adequate health care, this measure is yet another attempt by the administration to get around that pesky supreme court ruling making abortions legal. If they can establish fetuses as “unborn children,” that are given rights of children, they have a chance at shoot- ing a big hole in abortion rights protections Or how about of Dick “I’m In Hiding” Cheney. He loves secrecy so much, he won’t even let the public know where he’s living. Here’s another interesting aside, related to Sir Darkcloak Cheney: maybe you’ve heard about who Cheney won’t turn over the records of who met for his energy task force. Yes, this is problematic, fucked up and even makes Dick Nixon look like a forth-coming hero of public accountability. But what really stinks about Cheney’s stonewalling is that by protecting the energy task force documents he is trying to set a precedent whereby the Bush administration will gain never-before seen secrecy in their internal dealings. Mr Cheney maybe needs to re-read the Constitu tion, the document which helped build this “business” we call the U.S. A. By setting this precedent of secrecy, the administration will in effect not have to turn over documents relating to the Bush administration’s dealings with the Osama bin Laden and the Taliban before September 11th The French book Bin Laden, La Verite Interdite, details how the Bush admin- istration had been working with the Taliban to get an oil pipeline from the Caspian Sea through Afghanistan At one moment during negotiations, U.S. representatives told the Taliban “either you accept our offer of a carpet of gold, or we bury you under a carpet of bombs.” This threat was made prior to September 11th. Other sites say the Bush administration had been preparing for a war in Afghanistan in August 2001 Equally interesting is the fact that the John O’Reilly, deputy director of the FBI resigned in July of 2001 in protest over the Bush administration’s obstruction into bring ing Osama bin Laden to justice from the Yemen attacks on the U.S.S. Cole. Guess where O’Reilly went to work after resigning? He became head of security for the World Trade Center and was killed in the at- tacks. I’m getting dangerously close to conspiracy theory territory here, so I’ll back up a bit. Both Bush and Cheney made per sonal calls to Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschel asking him specifically to not inves- tigate the September 11th attacks beyond Sep- tember 11th. Odd that the administration would want to limit the scope of the investigation, rather than doing whatever necessary to find out what actually happened. The plot thickens... Okay, stop me if you’ve heard this one. Otto Reich was implicated in the Iran- Contra dealings in the 1980s. He also has been named as being involved in one of the worst airline disasters in the past twenty years, the bombing of a Cuban jet full of Castro supporters. Mr. Reich is an evil, bad motherfucker. He was also appointed by Bush to head of Western Hemisphere policies This is a post that usually requires Senate confirmation. Bush got around that process by appointing Reich during a recess Stay with me, this is where it gets good. Now that Reich is in charge of poli cies that effect the Western Hemisphere, money and resources that had been devoted to fight ing the “drug war” in Columbia have been re-directed to protecting a major oil pipeline in the region. Oil. It’s always about oil, isn’t it? Oil and Israel, at least now that communists aren’t a threat any more. There’s so, so much more. This shit keeps me awake at night. Seriously. Do you see my point about how the Bush administration just pushes in every di- rection, as hard as they can? Opposition can’t focus on one area. It’s like a dyke cracking. You plug one hole and two more spring up. Plug those and four appear in their place. It makes me sick to my stomach. So does the lack of dissent. It’s stunning how readily people buy the bullshit handed to them by the Bush ad- ministration. From his election to choking on a pretzel” to Enron to the “Axis of Evil. All the details of what’s really go- ing on are there, if you look closely, if you know where to look. This column was supposed to be about how war coverage has helped media outlets reap profits not seen in years, thanks to an increase in reader/viewership. Thus, the media (at least in the U.S. , those of you in the U.K. are very lucky to have a paper like the Guardian) has been doing all they can to play up the war coverage. From the looks of things, both from what the media says and from the administrations current policies, America is going to perpetually at war, even if we have to stir shit up to get people to start shooting. Sorry this turned into another ram- bling mess of “Shit Is Fucked!” There’s just so much. It’s overwhelming and really, not enough is being said. Even less is being done. FOR THE KIDS ItJJI.L'J.lsk'ISWt I have now been writing a column for Frac- ture for just over a year, this will be my sev- enth. After recently just moving house and unpacking the contents of my old house which have been in storage since March last year, among some of the things I had a look through was fanzines, including Fracture. Writing in my second column I stated how I lucky I felt to be in the position that I had two jobs which I really enjoyed, oh how things change in such a short time. Measured boring part. I’ve worked at various jobs since I left school, 11 years ago, painter and decorator, apprentice panel beater, in a fish factory ‘laying out’, as a delivery driver, a ‘storeman’, a foster carer, youth worker, and finally for almost three year? I have worked for Social Services for two Local Authorities. In the past 11 years I have spent 18 months claiming state benefit in the form of Job Seekers Allowance or In- come Support. Which means that in twenty nine years I have spent more time at school and work than at my own leisure, but that is columns >>> Fracture #20 I Page 12 ‘normal’, my dad has worked continuously since leaving school, as has my granddad, as have most of my male relatives and a large proportion of my friends. What differs is that my granddad spent almost all of his working life in the same job or at least the same occu- pation, as has my dad, as you can see from earlier in this that I have not followed suit. The nature of employment has changed so much in the last century and whilst people will state that there is no longer any such thing as job security (which is true), we, the collective ‘we’, workers, in my opinion, do have a little more choice in what we do. We are not party to the older generations’ some- what prescribed status. Choosing a job as a school leaver will almost certainly not mean that this is what we do for the rest of our lives. My own experience of working is tes- tament to that. However, I did receive a rea- sonably good education (although left school with no qualifications as such) and have had opportunities, which not everyone will have. I believe this added choice means that we are less willing to accept jobs, which we feel would demean us and less willing to stay in jobs which we dislike. What ever we do, we are all there for the money, I don’t presume that will ever change, but if we can get some level of satisfaction, some reward, then it does ease this constant battle for survival. This brings me back to the origin of this stuff, being in a job you like as opposed to one you dislike, has everything to do with your whole life. From my own experience of working in jobs I have liked, some of which include working within adverse situations, I have left work at the end of my day/week and for the most part been able to relax, spend time with friends, family etc and not dwell on work till it’s time to go back. However, being in a job you dislike for me, means that on a Friday evening, I am already worrying about Mon- day morning, that on Sunday evening I get knots in my stomach, thinking about Monday morning. At times finding it almost impos- sible to not think about work. This is not an issue of work itself, I have almost accepted that I will no doubt continue to work for the majority of my life, this is this job. Rant. I am an agency worker, I am earning more money than I have ever earned in my life, I have no contract, I am not en- titled to sick pay, my holiday pay is accrued through continuous working, it is certainly not the worst job I have ever had. I work for (through the agency) yet another under funded Local Authority. Despite the fact that it would cost less to employ me as a permanent mem- ber of staff, the money for agency workers comes from a different pot, and due to bud- get crises, etc, the vacant posts cannot be ad- vertised. Severe understaffing, unqualified workers often undertaking the tasks of quali- fied workers with no recognition (especially the income benefits). Almost entire teams made up by temporary posts and agency staff. Bed blocking, ambulances queuing at A & E de- partments, services not being provided to ser- vice users. Unhappy people, demoralised staff, procedure that doesn’t work, bureau- cratic policy, too many meetings, budget over spend, not enough money, overpaid manag- ers who should have been politicians, Coun- cillors who talk a lot but do very little, on the ball with PR though, image consultants on top wack, bids to be European City of Cul- ture (apparently this will ‘raise our profile’). In the meantime through all of this public services are on their fucking knees. Where do I fit in with all of this? I’m one of the many disgruntled employees who tries to do their best despite all of this, not for the team, not for managers, but for the people whom ‘we’ are supposed to be providing a service to. This is a national problem, this has all and nothing to do with government and everything to do with our society. This af- fects every public service, everyone every- where must be feeling this, the issue is whether you can affect some kind of change within the culture of the organisation, no matter how small, and if so this either makes or breaks your working life. People can only put up with so much shit, my limit is quite visible on the horizon. Half-baked theory. I did hear an interesting theory recently, the government knows that social services everywhere are under resourced, they have recognised the national shortage. So when their inspectors identify local authority’s social services that are not performing to standards, they at times will dismiss the entire management structure, and place managers from central government to hopefully turn things around. However would they do this knowing that the local authority is under resourced and this could be a factor of it’s failing service, would they announce the failed service, come in and man- age it, knowing they may quite possibly fail too? Politics is great. This is me signing out. I’m like that cunt MANDELSON. Just when you thought you were rid of me. I’m back! And the venom has been building up. I thought about doing my TOP TEN SHAGS but the missus is more fearsome than a Pales- tinian suicide bomber. And besides, it’s more fun to dish out ABUSE. So move over sad has-been tadger BEN ELTON, tonight’s compere is TREV HAGL and the Award Ceremony iiiissss THE PROPER DODGY CUNT(S) AWARDS 2001-2002! 10. JONATHAN KING. Just as we were glad to hear MICHAEL JACKSON was a kiddy fiddler (Shhh! - a few million quid sez he’s not), then surely JK being exposed as a paedophile prince was divine retribution of the highest order. Long before he had the chance to be let loose on a 12 year old, KING should’ve been sectioned in 1978 for the saddest attempt at bandwagon jumping I have ever seen. With wacky “punk” acts like JILTED JOHN enjoying success, KING donned a brightly coloured CURLY wig in a shameless cash in attempt. Here’s to any screws who have the sense of humour to lock him in a cell with CHARLES BRONSON for the night! 9. PC WORLD. I’ll try and be brief. Spent a fortune on a computer. Printer wouldn’t install. Rang helpline, no answer. Asked shop for refund or repair.... “not till you speak to helpline” she said. I explained that no one would an- swer the helpline. She put the phone down on me for “shouting”. Tried again later,she fucked off “to get someone” and never came back. Rang Trading Standards, and PC World again. Bit more friendly, said a bloke would ring. He rang. Completely baffled, he said ring Canon helpline. So I did. Said they’d put me through to Printer section - where there was no answer! Rang the shop bloke again, he said the only thing to do was bring it in and they’ll set it up and give me com- pensation. So I did. Fuck all compensation, but at last the printer worked. Time to try out the SCANNER. To cut a long story short, “file under printer saga”. Even the Scanner’s own software said “incompatible-contact your vendor for updated driver CD”. So I did. And guess what? The biggest computer shop in the UK told me to get a mate to download it from the internet! Which, of course didn’t work. In the end it was back again (and still no compensation). I waited at the repair desk where a customer told me it was the third time she’d came back within 2 days, and her set-up STILL wouldn’t work. Cam told me about his mate who was so enraged by the shop he took his whole set-up back and had to threaten to drag the manager outside be- fore he got his money back. And the missus’ brother? Well he did what most of us (sadly) just talk about. He rang the EVENING CHRONICLE, and thousands of people got to read his story, which was... Spent a for- tune on a set-up for the kids. Set it up Xmas day... completely fucked. Boxing Day took it columns >>> Fracture #20 Page 13 back. They refused to give him a replace- ment. Sent it for repair. He called back to collect it as instructed by the shop. After his 10 mile journey, oh dear. It wasn’t ready. The manager refused to see him or even speak to him on the phone. Still no joy as I type this. So if YOU’RE thinking of getting a com- puter from PC WORLD (and DIXONS / CURRYS are the same company), go to a backstreet auctioneer instead. It’ll probably be less hassle. 8. (GOOSE) STEPS . Yes I probably would. Well 3 of them any- way. But the above comment is actually a clever satirical remark regarding the “band’”s ex- pose in Anti-Fascist mag FIGHTING TALK, who picked up on an interview with the “band” in a Tory newspaper, where they were whinging big style about Asylum Seek- ers and how they should be “sent back”! I have two questions... 1. How rich does a band have to be before they stop being jeal- ous of people so desperate to get into the country that they risk their lives jumping on moving trucks? And, 2. Have I now got a better chance of getting the 2 blondes back to my gaff dressed as nazi sluts? 7. YOUR LOCAL ARSELICKER. Whether grovelling to the boss or grassing people up to the dole, BROWN NOSERS are never far away. So quit worrying and have a bit fun with em. In this computer age it should be easy to get knocked up “certificates” along the lines of “(Insert tosser‘s name here) - CRAWLER OF THE MONTH” and stick it up somewhere prominent in the workplace Or here’s an idea from my own workmates. The company decided to promote brown nos- ing by offering £50 to “Colleague of the Month”. When all the nominations were in, the box was opened, the votes counted, and the winner was... ME! All thelads on the shop floor had filled in the forms as sarcasti cally as possible (“He’ll do anything for the company”, etc.) and the whole place was in stitches, although the boss wasn’t quite so amused! He commented “it’s no laughing matter when there’s £50 at stake”, I was dis- qualified, and an arselicker with 3 votes “won” ! 6. VINNY JONES. He’s in every “hard man” film going, and let’s be fair, he can act. But what they don’t tell you is... he’s a TORY. A fucking Tory! A hunting fishing cunt like Jack Charlton. One of the lads, MY ARSE. 5. THE POST OFFICE. Postman Pat whistling cheerfully with his cat? Bollocks. A nice van to carry the letters round in? Forget it. Welcome to CON-SIGNIA. The directors have a cunning plan. Employ a load of highly paid consultants (who no one needs or wants), spend millions on a mere name change (who not even the most reactionary of right wingers I work with could see the point in), and come the End of Year Trading Profits, and straight onto the media to report a year’s trading LOSS and announce that 30,000 workers will have to go! That’s l/7 lh of the workforce, can you imagine that? Stanley Post Office queue (currently out the door) will go right down to Wool worths! And the postman’s sack (currently weighing any- thing up to 15KG - that’s about 55 LPs!)... well it doesn’t bear thinking about. They’ve already started talk of getting people to pick up their letters from a local garage. . . can you imagine if ya took a parcel into your local post office, weighed it and said “well if you want the money just come to my house”? I have a few mates who are posties, and the hysteria last year in the media about “illegal wildcat strikes” by some kind of greedy mili- tant demons was (surprise surprise) a smokescreen to hide the shocking antics of the bosses who simply ordered their staff to work all day Saturdays or else - whether or not they had families or season tickets for the rich man’s game! If you’re wondering why the destruction of the post office is so impor tant, not only am I fucked without it... the whole (real) punk scene is too, so start writ- ing those letters to your local overpaid tosser (sorry, MP) to tell him / her you’re voting Liberal at the next election. 4. GEORGE W. BUSH. “W for Wanker”? More like “Who? What? Why? Where?” - He looks as if some cunt has just struck him with an metal bar. But don’t laugh. The plan is simple. Get a dazed looking buffoon who every cunt feels sym pathy for and you can get away with murder. Simply mention “terrorism” and “our great country” and you can strip away civil rights like lead from a burnt out tower. On second thoughts, it’s America. You don’t NEED a plan. I’ve seen brighter people on the door at nightclubs. But seriously. A puppet of the big oil companies and every religious fruit- cake organisation in the country? Don’t mat- ter. Just get him to act like a silly old grandad who the kids hit with sticks, and fuck me he’s in (fair enough he cheated, but still...) Expect the same coming to Britain soon. When every cunt - even the dimmest Tory - has gotten sick of Blair, up pops the next nazi dictator, a poor old blind man with a guide dog. Just you wait and see. 3. MICK HUCKNALL. Mick WHO?That cunt from SIMPLY RED remember? Yes his band were absolutely SHIT, but what sets him apart from most talentless kak-merchants is 1 . He has a punk past, he should know better, and 2. Every six months he pops up in a newspaper an- nouncing his support for NEW LABOUR. Not just an ARSELICKER, but one with puffy ginger hair too. Serves him right. Cunt. 2. THE MUSIC INDUSTRY. As I waited for the missus to fuck off to the pub, I took my first look in years at TOP OF THE POPS, and I was simply gob-smacked. In the middle of the usual crowd of scream- ing bimbos was some daft cunt, older than me, in a kilt or something, singing an old 60’s hit to a Ravey Davey Gravy beat. It was DJ OTZI, and that’s when I realised the Music Industry had completely reached the point of no return. I could fill half of Frac- ture* with my own personal experiences con- cerning the BARSE ‘77 CD I put out - the record shops who charged £4 more than promised (& sold fuck all), the rip off stu- dio, the total wanker from the pressing plant (who was that dodgy he answered the phone in a Pakistani voice until he found it was some- one he hadn‘t yet ripped off, at which point he became Mike again), the media (everyone from Metal Hammer to our local paper) who refused to review it, even down to the Streetpunk” labels where trade is a sin. I could go on about CRASS being disqualified from the charts for having “pay no more than. . . ” on records, then years later big com- panies offering shops free CD’s as bribes to chart success. Or the blatant manufactureand hype that you already know about. But the only 2 words I need are DJ OTZI. The youth of today are doomed. No wonder half of ‘em are on drugs. 1. THE BILDERBERG GROUP. Woodland ceremonies where effigies are burnt, tree camps are built, and top men of compa- nies prance around in drag. Hotels booked in false names in remote locations. The worlds bankers, media and politicians meeting in se- cret to determine world events. Nol haven’t been drinking. Welcome to the BILDER BERGERS! Named after the hotel in Hol- land where the first meeting took place, the Bilderberg Group has played host to ex-USA heads of state, top ranking United Nations officials, leading bankers, media barons (in- cluding CONRAD BLACK, owner of the DAILY TORYGRAPH and numerous other titles worldwide), and well known politicians like Denis Healy, Peter Mandelson (what a sur- prise) and John Major. You thought George Bush was a “coward” when he went “miss- ing” on Sept 11 th ? Well it might just be that he was attending an urgent meeting somewhere. Pick up “THEM” by Jon Ronson (Picador Books) at your library, and abandon what little faith in democracy you still had. So there you have it. For once a column where I can’t have possibly upset anyone! If any labels are reading I still need to TRADE. I COLUMNS >>> Fracture #20 Page 14 have loads of stuff like BARSE ‘77, POI- SON IDEA, TOY DOLLS, McRACKINS, RICHARD HELL, JUST SAY NO (ex MEATMEN), QUADRAJETS and more. For further details, mail : trevhagl@hotmail.com Music is my job. When you say to me \"Garrison\" - I say \"REV:83, REV:93, and REV 103. The new one has shipped X amount, it was released on November 13th and they are on a US tour right now with Burning Airlines. When you say to me \"Con- verge\" - I say \"EVR040, EVR041 and EVR061. We're out of EVR040-1 but should have it back in a couple of months. EVR061 vinyl is also out of stock right now but we're due to get another 75 in on Thursday, after that they are all gone - it was a limited press of 2000. \" When you say \"Gorilla Biscuits\" - I say \"We're out of vinyl on both REV: 04 and REV: 12 but we're working on getting them back right at the beginning of next year. Both are in stock on CD.\" Get the picture? Records become catalog numbers. Informa- tion in my head. Probably only about 10 people on the planet who know what REV: 28 is or what EVR026 is or IND12. And I'm one of those people. It's sad. Bands become names, releases be- come units and the music becomes irrelevant. Making sure people have it in stock, that we have it in stock and that it's available to the kids becomes all that matters. I could be sell- ing tins of beans. Different flavors and dif- ferent brands. Something for everyone. Make sure it's in stock. Make sure it gets shipped on time and to the right place and that the invoice is correct and that payment arrives. But it's not tins of beans. It's mu- sic. Sometimes it takes something to make that sink in. To remind me that I'm incredibly lucky working with bands that I love and be- lieve in. That I am making sure that music that moves me reaches as wide an audience as possible. It takes the new Garrison to make me remember that I’m working with some- thing amazing. That I make a difference. That what I am doing has worth beyond the fulfill- ment of a job well done or simply a pay- check.- There are people who would kill for my job. I work at Revelation Records, doing whatever Jordan wants me to do any given month. This month I'm the US sales manager as well as my normal roles as for- eign sales manager, foreign publicist, along with some band management, A&R, distri- bution buying and any random project of the day that needs handling. I love my job. I may complain now and then, but I can put my hand on my heart and say that I love my job. There aren't many people who can claim that. I know I’m lucky. I had a rough week last week and I went out and treated myself to a CD player and two new speakers in my car. I had a crappy tape deck and was down to one speaker. I've never had a cd-player in the car before. It’s made a huge difference in my life. To be driving around singing along at the top of my voice to \"Last night, on the Mass Pike, I fell in love with you\" - it's a pretty big treat. Music. It's an easy thing to get burnt out on. To spend forty hours a week involved with it means that it's quite a relief to not have the stereo on. But it just takes that one new record, that one cd, to bring refresh- ment. To make it all new again. It's just Gar- rison “Be A Criminal”, or Kristofer Astrom ’’Northern Blues”, or The Frames “For The Birds” and feelings of being burnt out on music dissipate. The reasons why I spend the majority of my time living and breathing music become all clear again. It's been years of this shit and I’m still totally passionate. Any time my enthusiasm wanes there's some talented fuck that rejuvinates my soul with their creativity and talent. They re- mind me that it's not tins of beans. It's all of themselves that they can manage to pour into music. That it's full of life and passion and totally fucking amazing. So I learn their cata- log number and I try to make the whole world aware of its existence. I'm fighting an uphill battle all the way. But I'm Vique Simba and I've never been afraid of hard work or a chal- lenge. Hells yeah. I fucking hate winter. It's too fucking cold and it rains all the time, it makes me stay in, I don’t like staying indoors. On the plus side Spring is coming, woo-hoo! Fuck ID Cards. It's an old chestnut - ID cards. Every so often successive government in the UK have attempted to introduce ID cards upon the gen- eral population. The last one was Michael Howard’s ill-fated Voluntary Identity Card Bill back in 1995. Well Blunkett in his very suc- cessful attempt to become the most repres- sive Home Secretary since the last one annocced on February 5th that he wishes to introduce 'entitlement cards' scheme that would relate to the whole UK population. These 'entitlement cards' would carry finger- prints, digital photo, name, address and an ID number though they will not be compul- sory to carry at first (you can bet your back teeth that once they're in place carrying them will become mandatory as soon as they can get away with it) they will be required for employment and any dealings with the gov- ernment including the NHS and libraries. Designed to combat 'illegal immigration, the black economy and benefit fraud' it would of course do no such thing. Any government who had a difficulty over foot and mouth where they couldn't correctly compel details of a few thousand sheep begs to be asked how it’s going to deal with 57 million people! However if it were successful it would be a painful affront to. On the plus side, I imag- ine that once the system is in place it's gonna make forging a new identity a lot easier. People have been forging ID cards for years so who’s to say these are going to be more difficult to reproduce? Aside from bar-coding us from birth (and I wouldn't put that past them) any ID scheme can be made unworkable by simple refusal to accept the rules. Pilot schemes on asylum seekers and the unemployed look like the road the government seems keen to go down, resistance here may be enough to kill the idea in the early stages. With a bit of luck it might become New Labour's Poll Tax. It’s amazing how the government are using the September 11th attacks as a reason for any piece of repressive legislation. Apparently these cards will save us from having such an event happening in the UK - can’t see it my- self. The scheme would cost £1 billion to set up (though would save £55 million from abol- ishing driving licenses) and an undisclosed amount to run (significant new civil service infustructre would undoubtedly be required) still no extra cash for the poor, old or sick - oh well. Upcoming Stuff. On the 30th March ’Close Down Yarls Wood’ demo at the detention camp. 12 noon - 1.30pm and Bedford town centre, 2 - 4pm against the government's attacks on asylum seekers.

I'm currently living in what is pretty much a condemned building, nearly died in a electri- cal fire the other day - was asleep at the time, which is quite worrying. But I am looking to move into one of them big communal houses with lots of space and garden - alt tech and self-sufficiency here I come! The eagle eyed among you may have noticed there was one of the regular blockades of Faslane Nuclear Submarine base on the 11th - 13th February where there were just over 200 arrests, but on the whole the three days of action can be viewed as successful. Just as I was about to send this off I heard that the Scottish Parlia- ment have voted to make hunting with hounds a criminal offence - fucking great! stay punk stay free. . . buckfast4breakfast@hotmail. com What was it that Joey Keithley once said, “You’ve got to know who your enemy is...”? Well kids, I guess most of us didn’t pay any attention to old Joey and because of that, boy oh boy, are we suffering now. We’ve pissed our lives and our scene away with dreams of a bullshit revolution that is never going to happen, with talk of a Punk Rock Utopia where everyone gets along just fine and dandy having listened to and taken note of that age old “Punk” battle cry, “Unity”. You want to know what I think of “Unity”? It can kiss my fat, hairy arse. Did any of you ever really think it was going to happen? Did you really think that we were all suddenly going to be- come best friends, get together, hold hands and sing along to the latest Get Up Kids record whilst tip toeing through the tulips? What? Did you really think that I’d invite any of you round to my place for a “party”, a group hug and a chance to fuck my sister? You did huh? Sorry to burst your bubble kids, but it’s not going to happen. Not in this lifetime, no way. We’ve (the collective “we”, because I’m just as guilty of this mindless apathy and medio- cre crap as everybody else) sat on our arses for so long, pointing our fingers at the “man”, blaming “him” for all our woes and “rebel- ling” against the “system”, that we’ve for- gotten who the real enemy is, and in doing so our true “foes” have been replaced by a greater enemy. Ourselves. Remember the old saying “You’re your own worst enemy”? Add that to another ancient adage, “If the shoe fits, wear it” and that’s just about where we are. Every single one of us. But fear not, because there is a cure. A magical way out, a bottle filled with hollow promises, a tonic that guarantees nothing more than a vague sense of hope, and a malad- justed sense of self belief. One small drink and you’re part way there, you can change the focus and instead of relying on the bullshit that you’re supposed to in order to get through the daily drudgery, you can make your own mind up about who and what lies at the heart of the problem. Interested? Even if you’re not, you’re read this far., so what have you got to lose? Is it the PM A? Uh uh. Rule num ber one is never trust someone who is upbeat and happy all the time. The permanent smile is the gift of the sales person, used to deliver meaningless products to the masses. Misery is fine as long as you balance it with some thing else. So, are we talking new age phi losophy? No chance. That’s a doctrine ere ated by ex-hippies trying to purchase a chunk of the capitalist dream. Selling out on a major scale, throwing everything that they once be- lieved in for a bit of chump change and a quick buck. New age philosophy lies like a cheap rug and is about as useful as a choco- late fireguard. Forget it. All you need is what I like to call the “Punk Rock Guide To Self- Realization” Here’s how it works. Sit down and get ready for the six easy steps that’ll lead you to a point where instead of pointing your finger, you’ll raise your middle digit with a sneer and be ready to tell the world to go fuck itself. Comfortable? Good. Let’s begin. Step One. Pain. Think carefully about the time when pain was so intense that it set ev ery cell of your body and atom of your being on fire. Can you picture it? Can you focus on it? That physical drain that made you scream out loud? Forget the “emo” definition of pain when your cardigan got soaked in the rain, or when you couldn’t connect with some other shoe gazing student type or when you read about the rain forests burning down. That’s not pain, that’s life. Get used to it. No, I’m talking about physical pain, you know, like when you’ve been thrown out of a third storey window by someone suffering from amphet- amine psychosis, fracturing your skull and dislocating both shoulders and your left knee. Is it there? Good. Now store it in that mental file labeled “Me”. Store it and amplify that feeling. Step two. Anger. What burns you up? Doesn’t matter what it is, as long as something grabs you and makes you want to lash out, that’s exactly what you need to think about right now. Could be old people cutting you up on the road in their expensive, high performance cars which they insist on driv- ing at twenty miles an hour EVERYWHERE they go. I mean, come on, what’s the point? If you’re going to spend that kind of money on a car you want to open it up and lose your license in matter of hours, I just don’t under- stand it... oh, wait. Sorry. I was getting a little carried away there. Anyway, you get the idea. Take that raw hatred and file it next to “Pain” Step three. Love. We’ve all been suckered by it, conned by the greatest game of Three Card Monty you’ll ever play. Promises so much and delivers nothing. How many times you have been a relationship where you thought everything was cool only to have it all come tumbling down around you when you find that person you trusted more than other has betrayed everything that you thought you had? Yeah, don’t we all know it. Love is a cursed ship sailing on the seas of doom, and it’s only a matter of time until it goes straight to Davey Jones’ Locker. Feels bad huh? Good. Turn that dial up and stick it in the file. Step four. Humiliation. Remember when you felt lower than a squashed dog turd? Was it in front of anyone else? Chances are it was, and that it was down to somebody else. Somebody made you feel like that. Is your blood boiling just thinking about that mo- ment? Excellent. Take a mental snap shot of the twisted fuck that did that to you and pin it on the file. Draw a fake moustache, colour the teeth in and scribble stupid glasses on the picture if the mood takes you. Me, I like to write 666 on the forehead, but it’s all down to personal choice. Whatever floats your boat. Step five. Humour. What makes you laugh? Could be crap jokes, political manifesto’s, pre-packaged major label ideas of what con- stitutes a “Punk Rock” band, Fred Durst and Limp Fuckstick. Doesn’t matter. Carboncopy the thing that makes you roar with laughter and throw it in there. That’s your counter balance. The final step. Music. Does it make your heart pound and your brain feel like it’s about to explode? That’s just the ticket then. If I need to fire myself up I crank Kill Your Idols, What Happens Next?, Assert, RKL, Bad Religion, The Spermbirds, Last In Line and anything else that makes the neighbours scream “Turn that shit down!! columns >>> Fracture #20 | Page 16 If it makes you strut around the house in some weird, spastic convulsion whilst cream- ing along at the top of your lungs, then you’ve hit the nail on the head. You’re right on the money. Now, memorize the tunes and the words and store them in another cerebral file labeled “Ammunition”. Hey presto, you’re ready with all the tools you need for the job. All you need now is the chance to use them, and this is how the finished product is utilized. The next time something or someone annoys you (this is important - slightly agitated will not do. In order for this to work, all of the buttons that push you to the edge have to already have been pushed. You have to be close to the point of no return, or the process will simply not work), open the file marked “Ammuni- tion” and start singing, humming or what- ever you do, wait ten seconds and then open the file marked “Me” and let fly. The things you say and feel, guess what kids? That’s you. Who or whatever you directed it at, that’s who your real enemy is, and you’re on the path to “Punk Rock Self Realization”. No more bullshit, no more lies. Just the real you. Man, someone should give me a doctorate for this, and yes, the patent is for sale. Ap- ply to the usual address because it ain’t going to appear on E-Bay. You leader knows you love to hate him and thanks you for your time. Shoes. As most of you know by now, Jon has passed away, and even though I didn’t know him personally, in some way we were linked through the pages of Fracture. My thoughts are with his family and friends.

Email : massmovement@currantbun . com So my 1 st column for Fracture. I am going to try and cover the more extreme end of punk, bands that don‘t seem to get to much cover- COLUMINIS >>> age in Fracture presently. This first effort I‘m trying to find my feet, so if you have any comments / ideas please get in touch. Ok 1 st up. THE DEVILS from the waste- lands of Bradford comprise of those old nudgers from STALINGRAD / DOOM / HARD TO SWALLOW. They lay down some of the most intense live performances you’re likely to witness. Two singers attack- ing the audience to a soundtrack of brutal metallic riffs. The STALINGRAD compari- sons are valid, but they have their own thing going on here as well. Get hold of the happy bunch via stick@stick.go-legend.net or through the linl2 club. Ask about their CD- R, which fucking rips. BOXED IN are the remnants of SAWN OFF with new singer Nick of EBOLA. Slightly slower than SAWN OFF but still like getting you head repeatedly smashed against the curb. I caught their first gig and looks like they‘re going to be a force to be reckoned with. They’ve got a tour of cold places (Finland, Sweden, etc.) lined up for March. Demo CD- R I got sent is pretty crushing. Check out Sned’s website for more details - http:// www.flatearth.free-online.co.uk, which by the way is one of the best UK labels out there, and the site has good flyers, photo gallery, and shit hot label / distro. JOHN HOLMES have got to be one of the most under-rated bands about. They‘ve been going a few years now but just keep getting better. If you don‘t mind a bit of metal / rock riffage and a whole heap of pissed off atti- tude mixed with hardcore you can‘t go wrong. The split CD^with KABINBOY is a stormer. Live they ‘re definitely worth a look and al- most stole the show at the Leicester Xmas all- dayer. Their LP is on Flat Earth and the CD is on Devil Rock - szandor66@hotmail.com SCALPLOCK - colbran666@hotmail.com - hail from London and are ex-HARMONY as one amongst others (I‘ll spare Pete some embarrassment here!) their LP on Sound Pol- lution last year flat out fucking destroyed. Hyper speed thrash and then some. They don‘t play that many gigs but when they do, it’s worth a look. SHANK - simian23@ntlworld.com - from Scotland have been around for a while now, still delivering one of the harshest sounds in the UK. Clever arsed grind / thrash. New LP meant to be surfacing on Slap-a-Ham, which should get them some new converts. Still think they‘re more a live band than re- corded in my opinion. Also you’ve got the likes of KEVORKIAN SOLUTION, DEAD INSIDE, THE HOR- ROR (with ex-IMBALANCE / VOORHEES) SHOT TO FUCK, BURN ALL FLAGS, DUMBSTRUCK, BOMB BLAST MEN, DAGDA, NAILBITER, PARADE OF EN- EMIES, NARCOSIS, etc, who‘re worth a look / listen given the chance. Given the fact that I keep going on about seeing these bands live, here‘s some dates that definitely show there ‘s some quality live bands that are willing to come over to the UK to play just to cover their costs, have fun and play like there ‘s no tomorrow for YOU. Proof that DIY is alive and very well. More than likely at the following gigs there‘s going to be a heap of record stalls, selling cheaper stuff than anywhere else. DEAD AND GONE (Alternative Tentacles / GSL freaks) come over for the 2 nd time. More info enslaved records@yahoo.co.uk April 13th - Southampton. 14th - Bradford linl2 (w / Devils, John Holmes, D-Rail). 15th - Nottingham. 16th - London. No more details as of yet... FORCA MACABRA are coming over from Finland! The only date I know is the one we ‘re doing, May 11 th with John Holmes, The Devils - Porterbutt, Bath (tbc). Go. FROM ASHES RISE are coming hot on the heels of TRAGEDY for more pissed hardcore brutality. For more information mail scooter punk@ukonline .co.uk Sun 21st April - London, The Swan. Mon 22nd - Leeds the Packhorse (TBC) Tues 23rd - Glasgow, 13th Note (TBC) Weds 24th - Belfast, Warzone Centre. Thurs 25th - Dublin (venue TBA) Fri 26th - Nottingham, Old General Pub. Sat 27 th - Bristol (w/ Seein’ Red / Shikari), Duke of York. SEEIN 4 RED and SHIKARI are coming over to prove Europe ‘s got as much if not more going for it than the ever trendy US. Politically charged thrash-core. April 27th - Bristol (w/ From Ashes Rise) April 28th - Boston (at the Indian Queen) April 29th - Nottingham. April 30th - Liverpool. May 01st - Newcastle. May 02nd - Glasgow (at the 13 th Note) May 3rd - Bradford (as far as I know this date is confirmed at the l-in-12 club) May 4th - London. This is only a small selection of what‘s go- ing on. I‘ll try and mention more thrash / grind gigs as and when I get chance. How- ever if you ‘re not able to get to those gigs for whatever reason you could do worse than check Fracture #20 Page 17 out the following labels/distro‘s for a good place to pick up some harder to find vinyl/ Cd‘s. Most of whom specialize in the bands I rant on about. * Flat Earth - See Above for address, Sned’s Empire is still going strong. * Enslaved - www.enslavedrecords.co.uk Nick, Cathy and Josie deliver the goods! * La Vida Es Un Mus - contactable via email , paco@lavidaesunmus. free-online. co.uk - Ask Paco to add you to his list. Always has some crazy shit you ‘re after. Responsible for pretty much the only decent gigs in London these days also. * Scorched Earth Policy - great website at the www.scorchedearthpolicy.de - is run by Bernd who‘s an all round good guy. Europe has a lot of great bands. Start finding them! Aside from the above I want to mention a few other things. First off the linl2 club in Bradford. Now I might live 200 plus miles from the place but I still like to get up there regular. This is the best punk venue going in the UK. It does not get used half as much as it should. If you live in the Leeds / Bradford area get your arse over there and check out a gig or the Library, Bar, Cafe, workshops, etc. This place is an essential part of the punk / political community. It is owned and run by people like you and me who want to create spaces for people to be able to gather in and feel safe and exchange ideas. I don‘t want shit excuses just get over to one of the next festivals and see DIY punk at it‘s best www.linl2.com - If we can get at least a carload of freaks and drunks up there so can you. Put your money where your mouth is and support your community and its ventures. Next up, why does the punk / HC commu nity now revolve around web forums? No offense to Fracture at all but it seems like there 4 s hundreds of kids logging on and gos siping. Worst of all is the fact that most of the postings even on the “sensible” forum tend to be utter shite. Also why do you get the impression that there ‘s thousands of us out there via the amount of net activity but when for instance there ‘s a gig there ‘s the usual hardcore bunch that seem to travel the length and breadth of the UK? I can go to a gig in most cities and know a good few people there. So all you net nerds turn the fucking thing off and go see a band, or do something more constructive other than make lists of “My fave Sunday records”. If no-one turns up to see bands they ‘11 stop coming over (some already avoid the UK!) or all that you‘11 get are the Fat / Epitaph bands which I‘m not really dismissing, but a lot of that scene tends to mirror the major indie label scene with its guarantees, riders and rock star bullshit. Also if the only thing that‘11 get you out to a gig is if they ‘re from the States, please escort your- self out to the nearest field and shoot your- self. Just ‘cos they‘re from the States hon- estly doesn’t make them more valid than a band from your town. Right that‘s me lot pretty much, writing this was tough. IT1 be finding my feet given the chance from Fracture HQ and I hope to cover some more serious issues I think are not dis- cussed within the punk world, for instance the continiung lack of politics and also the death of the ‘zine scene due to people refus- ing to pay for them. I might try and get some interviews into these hallowed pages also, I guess we’ll see... Finally, I run a small label and we‘re cur- rently looking for decent bands to release. Drop me a line if you fit in with the above. No wimpy emo or 50 th generation grind. Any comments - body Jbagl 3@hotmail.com - or drop me a letter (remember them?) at - Graham / Crime Scene, Box 13, 82 Colston Street, Bristol, BS1 5BB, Earth. ^ **=“ 0 So punk is all about the music and the “scene”? 10 years ago it would cost about £3-5 to get in to a punk gig and it still costs about the same now. Has anyone thought that could contribute to the fact there are fewer bands and labels in the UK now than there has been since then? If a band travels any more than a few miles to play a gig either the promoter covers their costs and pays out of their own pocket, or the band pay for van hire and fuel themselves. Anyone that plays in a band will know how much money they put into it themselves without even considering playing a gig. Rehearsals are fucking expensive for a start - strings, drumsticks - it all adds up. If you haven’t had a university grant you could split between a years worth of beer and a shiny new marshall amp then you’ll have equipment hire on top of that. Anyone who has put on more than a couple of gigs themselves will have wished just a few more people could have dragged themselves away from their Playstations and paid the few quid entry fee so the bands could have been given enough money to cover their costs after the venue hire and the PA has been covered. Pub landlords don’t give a shit whether you’re putting on Underclass or Erasure, they just want paying without their bogs getting ripped off the walls. “Can I pay you next week mate when my giro turns up?” isn’t an option. 10 years ago it would cost about £5-6 for a punk album. You don’t even want to get me started on how much an album costs to make. Ok, you’ve twisted my arm. Before I start, you could technically make an album without spending your parents’ life savings. You could record in your bedroom on an old fucked tape recorder. Aside from Sebadoh, Bob Tilton, and a few minor miracles, this will almost certainly be bollocks. Studios in my experience always seem to have cost around £150 per day to record. Maybe it used to be more like £100 (my memory isn’t what it used to be) but it’s still a lot of money. If a band records and mixes 12 songs in a week they’re doing well. Bear in mind that most of this time is spent setting up microphones all over the place, getting the fancy flashing bleeping cost-more-than-your-life-is-worth recording machines working properly, getting your band mates out of the pub, and arguing over whether the guitars are too loud. So that’s £1 ,000 you and a couple of your mates have just spent. Tape hire, DAT cassettes, strings, sticks, beer and fags brings it closer to £1 , 100. Right, everyone’s happy - let’s take the DAT down to the pressing plant. Most bands do not have a hope in hell of selling 500 copies of an album. More likely they will sell between 200 and 300 copies and give the rest away, but just for arguments sake let’s say this super duper punk band who everyone loves are going to sell 900 copies of their album and give away 100 and they are on a cool little punk label run by their mate in their bedroom. To cut a MASSIVE AND VERY COMPLICATED story short you’re likely to spend at least £2.50 per LP/CD before you get them in your hands including mastering and all that technical stuff that gives you a headache. So you give away the 100 CD’s or LP’s for review and to your mum and dad and extended family you never hear from, and all your mates leaving you with 900 of the things. If you are going to sell that many records then unless you have loads of time on your hands some of them - say 200 - are going to go through a distributor of some kind. You will make about 50p per copy on these, giving you £100. Half of the rest will go out through cool little punk mailorders run by your mates from their bedrooms, and you will get about £3 back on these, giving you £1,350. The 450 you have left of this first pressing will be sold by the band at gigs for £5 giving you £2,250. So in total (and in theory because it never ever ever goes this smoothly) you have £3,700. Recording cost £1,100 + pressing cost £2,500 giving a grand COLUMNS >>> Fracture #20 | Page 18 total of £3,600. Hmm. .£100 to split between the label and 4 or 5 band members. But hey, it s a success! Wait a minute, we have no records left! You would have had to charge a hell of a lot more for the records to even think about repressing this oh so successful album, unless you want to keep coughing up the money yourselves to keep the thing in print. I know nothing’s going to change - 1 feel like a capitalist whore even suggesting that our little baby punk records and gigs should be more expensive, but there you go. I’m not loaded by any stretch of the imagination but I would be quite happy to see the prices of these things go up by a pound. I feel terrible that the band I’m in have to ask for a certain amount to play a gig we have to travel to, but the fact is we don’t have our own van, or even most of the equipment we need to play a gig on our own, and I can’t see a point where we will have that luxury. People joke about (or maybe even believe?) the hype surrounding Dead Inside, but we struggle to sell a few hundred records just like everyone else - we’re all in this together - isn’t that how it goes? The most amazing review in Kerrang! or Fracture won’t sell any records, believe me. One last note - Dave asked if I could write about 1,000 words for this, and I’ve done exactly that! Scott, PO Box 357, London, SE19 1AD. Humanleaguel 981 @aol. com The best bass line in the history of the world has to be the bass line of Fugazi’s “Waiting Room”. No other one has ever had quite the same impact on me, so that every time I hear it I have to stop whatever it is that I’m doing and am forced to listen. It just won’t allow itself to be ignored. Great music is music like that. It has the ability to touch you, to stop you in your tracks, to express through sound what can only be expressed clumsily in words. Every time I hear that song I think of the time that my friend Brad and I bussed it down to Brighton to catch the Fugazi show at the University of East Sussex, seeing them in the university hall playing with the lights on. Ian Mackaye jumping off stage at the end of their set walked out through the audience, kids lining up to shake his hand. To me it wasn’t quite a “rock star” moment, but in- stead a moment that reinforced the idea that there are no rock stars - that those people who you look up to are just as human as you are. Music has an uncanny way of bring ing memories back to life. That old Guns N Roses song “My Michelle” always re minds me of my best friend at school, spe- cifically of the one time I saw her od’ing on coke in the days before I really had any idea of what drugs were. I still see her as we pushed her under the shower shaking and wet with tears running down her face. And another cheesy song, “Don’t you forget about me”, brings back the weekends spent with another friend in the blue mountains, sneak ing out for a nip of mum’s whiskey and to swim in the local reservoir at midnight. Nirvana’s “Teen Spirit” reminds me of being stage manager for my uni’s production of Little Shop of Horrors. We were in rehears als painting the floors when the director came in and told us that Kurt Cobain had topped himself. The local independent ration station played that song on rotation for the rest of the day - we’d all thought that it was a wind up until we heard it. There had been this strange thing on some recent documentary where people were talking about how they remembered what it was they were doing when they heard that JFK had been shot. I wondered if this was how they felt. Memories are among our most pre- cious possessions. They define who we are as individuals and bond us with others. About 30 years ago, psychologists developed a method for studying memory distortions More recently studies have revealed that with the right suggestions you can invent another persons memories - make people believe they had childhood experiences that they hadn’t. One favourite method for doing this is to en list family members to help persuade their relatives that these false key events occurred. Across the many studies, about a quarter of people have been induced to report that “in- vented” childhood experiences were real. Many gave clear details and expressed high levels of confidence about their fake memo- ries. Other powerful ways of planting false memories exist. For example, experts can analyse people’s dreams, and use the bogus analyses to produce false memories. How about doctoring people’s childhood photos and having the bogus photos produce false memories of experiences? False memories begin with a seed of suggestion and grow into a full-blown memory-like experience. They sprout when a person believes that a made-up event is plausible and germinate when a person believes that the event happened. And finally, they take root when a person embellishes the belief with the kind of sen- sory details that make it feel like a real memory. Research has also shown that false details planted in ads can make you believe you had experiences that you never had. For example people who reviewed phony ads showing Bugs Bunny at Disneyland later be- lieved that they had personally seen him there, even though he doesn’t exist there. Are there reliable ways to distinguish a true memory from a false one? At the moment it is simply a question of personal judgement and per- ception. Many behavioural and neuro"
