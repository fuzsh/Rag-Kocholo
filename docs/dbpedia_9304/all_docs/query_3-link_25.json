We recently reported our epiblast stem cell (EPISC) reprogramming SES that generates numerous blastocyst (BC)-like hemispheres (BCLH) with pluripotent and extraembryonic cell features detected by microscopy. Here, we further explored the system over key time points with single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis. We found broad induction of the 2C-like reporter MERVL and RNA velocities diverging to three major cell populations with gene expression profiles resembling those of pluripotent epiblast, primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm. Enrichment of those three induced BC-like cell fates involved key gene-regulatory networks, zygotic genome activation-related genes, and specific RNA splicing, and many cells closely resembled in silico models. This analysis confirms the induction of extraembryonic cell populations during EPISC reprogramming. We anticipate that our unique BCLH SES and rich dataset may uncover new facets of cell potency, improve developmental biology, and advance biomedicine.\n\nKeywords: synthetic embryology, stem cells, reprogramming, early embryo, synthetic biology\n\nHighlights\n\n•\n\nReprogramming primed pluripotent EPISCs activates 2C reporter and ZGA-like factors\n\n•\n\nReprogramming forms 3 regions resembling the 3 pre-implantation blastocyst lineages\n\n•\n\nRNA velocity and splicing shows that 3 blastocyst-like lineage cells enrich over time\n\n•\n\nReprogrammed cells have most critical gene regulation of putative embryonic cells\n\nIn this article, Kime and colleagues show single-cell RNA-seq analysis across key time points within their induced blastocyst-like hemisphere synthetic embryo system. The study reveals how epiblast stem cells cultured in defined media had reprogrammed with zygotic genome activation-related expression and became cells with the critical gene regulation of the three cell lineages of the pre-implantation blastocyst.\n\nIntroduction\n\nEarly embryonic development research was the basis for developmental biology and subsequent stem cell biology. In recent decades, much has been learned from mammalian embryology animal models that are not subject to the ethical considerations for human embryos (Hyun et al., 2020; Rossant and Tam, 2009, 2017). Early embryos were used to derive various pluripotent and multipotent stem cell lines with characteristics and chimera-integrating potential analogous to the assumed embryonic origin (Evans and Kaufman, 1981; Martin, 1981). However, the ability to form synthetic embryos from cultured cells had been elusive until recent advances enabled in vitro synthetic embryo systems (SESs) (Tomoda and Kime, 2021).\n\nSESs are part of a newly emerging generation of models akin to organoids, but reflecting early embryology through “embryoids” that are far more convincing (Harrison et al., 2017; Kime et al, 2018, 2019; Rivron et al., 2018; Shahbazi and Zernicka-Goetz, 2018; Tomoda and Kime, 2021; Zheng et al., 2019). Several SESs exist, and some focus on modeling the blastocyst (BC) and its three layers: trophectoderm (TE), primitive endoderm (PE), and pluripotent pre-implantation epiblast (EPI). Some SESs utilize embryonic stem cell (ESC) and trophoblast stem cell (TSC) aggregations to model the pre-/post-implantation embryo in vitro. Other SESs, including those produced by our group, involve cell reprogramming or unique cell plasticity states that give rise to BC-like cysts from single cultures. Various approaches building on BC-like cyst formation in vitro continue to be developed and explored as each SES uniquely broadens embryology (Tomoda and Kime, 2021).\n\nIn a related field, reprogramming cells with exogenous factors (e.g., transcription factors, small molecules, cytokines, nutrients) pioneered new dimensions in cell biology by inducing donor cells to adopt desirable or unforeseen synthetic states (Davis et al., 1987; Kime et al, 2016, 2019; Takahashi et al., 2007; Woogeng et al., 2020). Indeed, analogs of early embryonic BC-lineage cells have been induced by many scientists (Benchetrit et al., 2019; Kubaczka et al., 2015; Parenti et al., 2016; Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006). Our past epiblast stem cell (EPISC) reprogramming induced high-quality chimera-forming naive-like cells with X chromosome reactivation (Kime et al., 2016). We recently showed that the same reprogramming generated plates of BC-like hemispheres (BCLHs) with KRT8+ (TROMA-I) TE-like cells surrounding the Xa/Xa EPI-like naive ESC region, which also had a PE-like GATA4+/GATA6+/PDGFRA+ population at its inner face toward the putative blastocoel (Kime et al., 2018, 2019). However, detailed single-cell gene expression and regulation of the converting BCLH cells to resemble the three BC-lineage cells was previously unknown.\n\nThe BCLH SES can be easily set up and generates BCLHs efficiently from EPISC cultures. We established EPISCs with the 2C-reporter MERVL and saw broad expression prior to BCLH cyst-like formation. We applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and saw that on day 5, three distinct regions of cells branched out with gene expression resembling the BC's TE, PE, and EPI lineages. The three regions each had RNA velocity toward day-7 cells that extended the regions and further enriched convincing cells of the postulated BC-cell identities. Furthermore, RNA splicing regulation and gene-regulatory networks implied that significant cell reprogramming had occurred with germ and zygotic genome activation (ZGA) signature genes. Here, we detail these observations and anticipate a welcome interest in the relatively poorly explored aspect of EPISC SES reprogramming into early embryonic cells.\n\nResults\n\nNaive ESCs in 2iLIF may stabilize 2C/MERVL+ reporter expression\n\nFor this study we required control naive ESCs to model early pluripotency. We therefore integrated MERVL::RFP reporters into B6N ESCs, which we cultured as previously reported (Kime et al., 2019). These cells are passaged with Accutase to single cells every few days on iMatrix511 in 6-well plates (see experimental procedures). Two distinct populations of ESCs stabilized within the same culture: one with the traditional dome-like morphology of naive ESCs with transient MERVL::RFP expression (Macfarlan et al., 2012) and the other with a unique larger cell morphology with sustained MERVL::RFP expression ( A). Our scRNA-seq analysis of the culture confirmed our suspicion of a “duality” because cells clustered into two distinct groups ( B) that we bisected at the origin of UMAP_1: the left cluster termed “ESC” and the right cluster with much more MERVL::RFP “2C-like” reporter expression we termed “ESC2CL” ( B and 1C). Although the cells were technically cultured and processed for scRNA-seq as one sample, the ESC2CL cells had much higher mean scRNA-seq features (ESC: 7,277; ESC2CL: 7,998; p value: 1.88711 × 10−119) and counts (ESC: 53,285; ESC2CL: 69,568; p value: 2.576207 × 10−108) shown by two-sample t test and violin plot (Figure S1A). These differences may come from ESC2CL cells being visibly larger or from harboring more mature transcripts accessible to the 3′ poly(A) priming of the scRNA-seq kit. When compared, both populations generally retained similar core pluripotency features ( D), and although differential gene markers could also be identified (Tables S1 and S2), there were few outstanding genes in each group's top 20 (Figure S1B). Because of their technical similarity in scRNA-seq data and our interest in 2C/MERVL regulation, we used both ESC and ESC2CL clusters throughout this study.\n\nThe BCLH SES induces 2C/MERVL reporter, XGFP, and three regions of blastocyst-like lineage cells\n\nWe previously generated (Kime et al., 2018, 2019) EPISCs with XGFP and MERVL::RFP reporters that are completely off when viewed by fluorescence microscopy ( A). We induced BCLH reprogramming with these cells and sampled them for scRNA-seq at day 5 and day 7, along with the starting EPISCs and the dual ESC/ESC2CL population, using a standard workflow including SkewC (Abugessaisa et al., 2020) to select high-quality cells for analysis (Figure S2A). On day 4 we rarely spotted XGFP expression while many cells showed MERVL::RFP activation that continued through day 5 and day 7 as XGFP became activated ( B). Activation of MERVL across full colonies was also visible with a rapidly degrading MERVL::D2nRFP reporter (Kime et al., 2018; Li et al., 1998) (Figure S2B).\n\nWe prepared our scRNA-seq samples with Seurat's SCTransform (Butler et al., 2018) and found a clear trend of three regions of cells on day 5 that clustered closely to similar expanded surrounding regions on day 7 ( C) across comparable ranges of features and counts with control cells (Figure S2C). In general, cells in the three regions often clustered together and the day-7 cells had more distinguished separation ( C). The EPISCs, the ESCs, and the ESC2CL cells clustered separately ( C). Surprisingly, many reprogramming cells in all regions had significant MERVL::RFP expression ( D and 2E), and mostly one specific region of day-7 cells expressed the XGFP reporter ( F) that may indicate naive pluripotent cells (Bao et al., 2009; Kime et al., 2016).\n\nChecking gene expression revealed that common late BC-lineage cell markers were enriched and relatively focused in three separate regions characterized by Pluripotent/Epiblast-like, TE-like, and PE-like genes ( H–2J). The Epiblast-like region colocalized with the XGFP expression ( F) and was enriched for pluripotent genes (Pou5f1, Zfp42, Tdgf1, Nr0b1, Klf2) ( H). Importantly, XGFP was detected in the cells where Klf2, Klf4, and Prdm14 were expressed ( F and 2H), consistent with the previously reported role of these genes in reactivating the inactive X chromosome (Gillich et al., 2012; Kime et al., 2016). In the TE-like region, we observed numerous important TE-establishing genes (Ets2, Tfap2c, Gata2, Gata3, Elf4) ( I) and remarkable expression of Krt8 and Krt18, which were recently reported to organize extraembryonic fate determination in the compacting and polarizing embryo (Lim et al., 2020). We also found markers of more specialized TE-lineage cells (Hughes et al., 2013; Latos and Hemberger, 2016) enriched within the TE-like region (Figure S2D), suggesting some TE-lineage differentiation therein. Also, the smaller PE-like region had milder yet focused enrichment for important PE genes (Pdgfra, Gata4, Gata6, Fgfr1, Lifr, Lama1) ( J).\n\nThe 2C-like MERVL reporter in ESCs has been used in several studies, yet its use in naive ESCs has been limited due to an unclear relationship to ZGA early embryonic-like plasticity. In our SESs we found utility with this reporter related to heightened cell plasticity (Kime et al., 2018, 2019). We therefore checked the expression of numerous recently reported ZGA-like regulators and ZGA signature genes derived from powerful screens (Alda-Catalinas et al., 2020). Many ZGA-like regulators were induced in reprogramming cells ( K), and ZGA signature genes were often highly expressed broadly or regionally in day-5 and day-7 reprogramming cells (Figure S2E), while many were not expressed in the stem cell controls including the ESC2CL cells (Figure S2E). As such, we hypothesize that ESCs may have a low threshold for MERVL reporter activation that reflects lesser 2C-like/ZGA gene differences while de novo MERVL reporter activation in reprogramming cells might indicate a greater composition of ZGA-like genomic remodeling.\n\nThree regions of blastocyst likeness enrich over time\n\nTo investigate the state of cells on day 5 and day 7, we employed RNA velocity with Velocyto (La Manno et al., 2018) to determine the “direction” of cell-state change and view RNA splice variation. The EPISC and the ESC/ESC2CL had RNA velocities pointing inward, demonstrating stable states ( A). As we anticipated, all three regions of the reprogramming cells displayed an obvious RNA velocity trend from day 5 toward day 7 and appeared to move away from each other ( A). Perhaps reflecting the PE formation of a BC, the ratio of cells driving into the PE-like region was fewer and distributed between the Epiblast-like and extraembryonic-like regions ( H–2J and A).\n\nDiscriminating unspliced (u) pre-mRNA versus spliced (s) mRNA ratios with scRNA-seq and Velocyto allows for a comprehensive understanding of important state-specific splice mechanisms beyond simple RNA detection. Tdgf1 is an early BC inner cell mass (ICM) gene (Pfister et al., 2007) often detected in ESCs; however, Tdgf1 was mostly unspliced in the ESC/ESC2CL clusters while strongly spliced and enriched in the Epiblast-like region of reprogramming cells ( A and 3B), where other gene expression seems to implicate a more ICM-like state. The germ programming genes Prdm1 (Blimp1) and Smc1b were also splice-enriched in reprogramming cells (Figure S3A), supporting previous consideration of the importance of germ genes toward higher plasticity in our SES reprogramming (Kime et al., 2018, 2019). As seen in base expression ( K), the ZGA-like regulators Dppa2, Dppa4, Tsc22d4, Smarca5, and Smad1 were induced across the reprogramming cells with splicing preference (Figure S3B), and the ESC2CL cells had spliced Dppa2 more efficiently than the ESCs. Similar region-specific splice mechanism preference was found with TE and PE genes Fgfr2 and Lama1 ( B) for protein translation in putative cells. Pard6b and Lifr followed a similar trend while enriched in reprogramming cells' regions (Figure S3C). Taken together, the regulation of splice mechanisms and time-based BC-like cell region specification is apparent and related to pre-BC-stage regulators.\n\nTo investigate downstream gene regulation in reprogramming cells, we randomly downsampled the three regions to similar cell numbers after Seurat clusters 2:TE-like, 5:PE-like, and 4:Epiblast-like with day-specific labeling ( C). A heatmap of the top 100 global variable genes confirmed that each cluster had a unique pattern of expression ( D). We then performed SCENIC (Aibar et al., 2017) analysis of gene expression that infers upstream transcription factor DNA-binding activity to determine gene-regulatory network (regulons) enrichment that can robustly characterize cell identity. As expected, each region had distinct patterning that generally enriched from day 5 to day 7 (Figure S3D). The regulons were then binarized to simplify the interpretation of regulon activity. The pluripotent Epiblast-like population had largely lost primed pluripotency EPISC-specific regulons (e.g., Pou3f1) (Buecker et al., 2014) and reprogrammed with regulation remarkably similar to that of the ESC/ESC2CL with well-known naive pluripotency regulons (e.g. Mybl2, Esrrb, Klf2, Klf4), and shared broader pluripotency continuum regulons (e.g., Sox2, Nanog, Pou5f1) with EPISCs ( E) (Nichols and Smith, 2009; Weinberger et al., 2016). Not surprisingly, the ESC and ESC2CL populations had few differences at the regulatory level.\n\nAs anticipated, the PE-like and TE-like cells shared important extraembryonic regulons (e.g., Klf6, Kdm5a, Creb3, Elf1, Elf4) ( E) (Burton et al., 2013; Krendl et al., 2017; Rivron et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2013). Furthermore, the TE-like region had enriched significant TE-specific regulon activity (e.g., Gata2, Gata3, Ascl2, Pparg) ( E) including Cdx2 regulon (Figure S3D) (Home et al., 2017; Krendl et al., 2017; Ralston et al., 2010). Also, the PE-like region had some enriched PE-specific regulon activity including Gata6 and Hnf1b (Figure S3D) (Lo Nigro et al., 2017). Average gene expression for the same transcription factors of regulon analysis reflected a similar pattern ( F), although far less specific, highlighting the value of gene-regulatory network analyses when comparing cells (Aibar et al., 2017; Woogeng et al., 2020).\n\nThe gene regulation and RNA splice differences raised uncanny distinction of the regions. We investigated numerous mouse RNA spliceosome genes (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) and found some with discrete differences among the day-specific regions (Figure S4A). The Mbnl splice factors that repress naive pluripotency-specific splicing (Han et al., 2013) were only active in the TE-like and PE-like region cells (Figure S4A). Also, Mbnl3, a core trophoblast gene induced by Gata3 and Cdx2 (Ralston et al., 2010), was neatly expressed in the TE-like region. Interestingly, Mbnl2 was one of the top 20 markers for the TE-like region among other TE genes (Figure S4B).\n\nTaken together, the BCLH SES reprogramming cells formed three diverging regions over time with specific epigenetic splicing, expression, and downstream regulation that grossly reflected the three BC-cell lineages; such divergence over time may explain the controlled order and development of BCLHs observed in culture (Kime et al., 2019).\n\nSome BCLH cells adopt the regulatory networks of established models\n\nBCLH SES reprogramming induces many cells organized spatially like BCs (Kime et al., 2019). To better isolate and characterize the most BC-like cells in silico, we selected the induced cells that were most ICM/Epiblast-like (iEPI), TE-like (iTE), and PE-like (iPE) based on critical gene expression criteria (see experimental procedures). We also included comparable numbers of the ESCs/ESC2CL cells and starting EPISCs. For established TE and PE model cell data, we sourced a loom file (Posfai et al., 2021) that was built from established reports' scRNA-seq data. Using the 17,242 intersecting features of all samples, we then integrated with 5,000 anchors to correct for batch differences (see experimental procedures).\n\nSeurat UMAP clustering from the integrated gene expression generally showed distinct populations based on type, although there was a general clustering of extraembryonic (iTE/TE/iPE/PE) samples ( A), similar to the TE/PE analysis in the model cell study (Posfai et al., 2021). Many TE and PE cells clustered together with iTE and iPE cells, likely from common extraembryonic expression. Excitingly, analysis with SCENIC showed distinct trends among 152 regulons that distinguished the putative similar cells ( B), demonstrated by the single-cell level total regulon activity plot (Figure S4C). SCENIC binarized regulon analysis revealed, again, the distinction between the pluripotency and extraembryonic cells with high similarity to established models (Figure S4D). Both SCENIC regulon plots ( B and S4D) had more clarity than average gene expression alone (Figure S4E), which highlighted the importance and power of gene-regulatory networks to determine a cell identity (Aibar et al., 2017). As expected, the iEPI cells were regulated alike to the ESCs/ESC2CL cells, having lost nearly all EPISC-specific regulons and acquiring regulons of naive pluripotency ( B) more clearly than the whole Epiblast-like cluster (Figure S3D). iPE/iTE samples had lost most EPISC-specific regulons that were also not found in the PE/TE cell models. In fact, the iPE/iTE and PE/TE model cells mostly had similar regulon enrichment profiles ( B) despite minor differences that appeared to come from a batch effect. Importantly, the iPE enriched key PE regulons (e.g., Gata4, Gata6, Sox17) and the iTE enriched many TE regulons (e.g., Cdx2, Gata2, Klf6).\n\nWe imported the regulon activity tables to the Seurat object and used FindMarkers to identify the top 10 regulon markers of the naive pluripotent, PE, and TE samples and plot their regulon activity (Figure S4F). Indeed, many top markers discovered were highly reported genes that define the correlating EPI/TE/PE cell states (e.g., Klf2, Kfl4, Nanog::Cdx2, Ets2, Klf6::Sox7, Gata4, Gata6) and were regulated relatively neatly among induced and model embryonic/extraembryonic populations (Figure S4F). In general, each of the three induced BC-like cell populations in BCLHs appeared to be regulated by the critical transcription factors of their putative equivalents.\n\nReclustering cells based on SCENIC regulon activity can provide clearer identity-based clustering (Aibar et al., 2017; Posfai et al., 2021). Upon doing so in t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) map space, the distinction of iTE/TE and iPE/PE marginally improved among better distinction between the pluripotent and extraembryonic states ( C). As seen with the regulon heatmaps ( B), the ESC and ESC2CL cell regulon activity caused those cells to nearly share the same tSNE space, strengthening the notion that these cells were more similar at the gene-regulatory level despite the stable MERVL reporter expression only in ESC2CL ( B and 4C). As expected, the iEPI cells now clustered closer to the ESCs/ESC2CL cells ( C). To view critical regulon activity in individual cells, we prepared three tSNE plots with BC-lineage-specific regulons on each plot that explained the regulatory activity responsible for the diverse cell types ( C, top right and bottom).\n\nTo learn more about the iTE and iPE identity reprogramming, we compared the sample gene expression with the model cells (TE and PE), with in vitro stem cell counterparts derived from natural BCs (TSC and XEN), and with in vitro reprogrammed cells (GETSM_TSC, cXEN, iXEN) from previously reported bulk RNA-seq data (Benchetrit et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2020; Parenti et al., 2016) (see experimental procedures). We based the gene list on the 152 regulon gene names that the SCENIC analysis learned while neatly separating our cells. Indeed, a core TE/TSC signature could be identified from the TE and TSCs, which was generally reflected in both reprogrammed iTE and GETSM_TSC. However, the iTE was closer to TE than to TSCs, possibly reflecting the differences between TE and TSCs, or batch effects ( D, left). Similarly, a core PE/XEN signature could be identified from the PE and XENs, which was well reflected in the iPE and iXEN samples and less clear for cXEN samples ( D, right).\n\nOverall, the BCLH SES demonstrated remarkable cell reprogramming from primed pluripotent EPISCs that engaged sophisticated gene regulation and RNA splicing to produce regions and cell output (iEPI, iTE, and iPE) with the critical gene expression of pre-implantation embryo cells (TE/PE) and established cell lines (ESC/TSC/XEN).\n\nDiscussion\n\nUntil now we had seen self-assembly and order that resembled BCs in the BCLH SES (Kime et al., 2018, 2019) that emerged in previous reprogramming works (Kime et al., 2016). In addition to confirming those observations, this study provides numerous insights into gene expression, RNA splicing regulation, and gene-regulatory networks that greatly strengthened our hypothesis that EPISCs can reprogram to represent BCs. The numerous ZGA signature and germ program related genes lead us to wonder how the cell reprogramming is engaged, although anticipated Dux and Zscan4 expression was not detected at these time points (Hendrickson et al., 2017).\n\nThe BCLH SES is unique for its cell origin, defined culture conditions, and output. Given that the MERVL reporter activated early on, and day-5 cells neatly branched toward day 7, we anticipate that an earlier-time-point reprogramming precursor cell may exist. It will be important to dissect the reprogramming process with earlier time points and shorter intervals to fully understand how the initial reprogramming and lineage divergence occurs. Clues in unpublished aspects of this study continue to suggest germ program features as previously hypothesized (Kime et al., 2019). Discovery and optimization of a unique precursor, reprogrammed from EPISCs, may further advance our understanding of the distinctive properties of this SES. We anticipate that lineage tracing or cell selectivity based on the iEPI/iPE/iTE data may help discern key precursors and emerging populations. We would also like to include in scRNA-seq analysis early BC ICM cells and BC Epiblast-specific cells that we could not presently access.\n\nThe MERVL reporter has had significant utility in our SESs, and in the BCLH system it is more broadly induced than in the induced BC-like cysts (iBLCs) (Kime et al., 2019), where the defined conditions are altered in different phases. Conversely, BCLH SES cells proceeded more rapidly to form less organized BC-like hemispheres instead of puckering from the plate as floating self-organizing cysts. Since the MERVL reporter was highly active in all three regions of this study across day 5 and day 7, it provided some clues about unique 2C-like early embryonic programs that may be engaging the genome. Surprisingly, the ESC2CL cells in our base condition had sustained MERVL::RFP expression and had interesting differences from ESCs in gene expression despite overwhelming similarity at the gene-regulatory network level. We speculate that the MERVL reporter may have significant utility in our cell reprogramming that had numerous ZGA-related genes, yet wonder if our data here challenge the MERVL reporter's value in 2iLIF conditions.\n\nCell reprogramming\n\nIn general, the reprogramming cells lost their donor cell state and took on the programs of early BC-like cell lineages, which reflected prior observations in great detail. The XGFP+ iEPI population was previously shown as readily potentiated for high contribution in chimeric embryos (Kime et al., 2016). Although TE-like and PE-like regions could be identified and harbored cells with convincing TE or PE properties, we wonder whether such cells could seed TSC or XEN cell cultures if transferred in selective conditions. In the BCLH SES, the TE-like region generally had infrequent Cdx2 detection despite the specific enrichment of the Cdx2 regulon, perhaps related to abundant keratin expression and TE-related transcription factor involvement. Interestingly, the TE can be specified independent of Cdx2 (Wu et al., 2010). Although Cdx2 is not required for BC formation (Meissner and Jaenisch, 2006), its role in implantation is important, and distinct CDX2+ TE is roundly regarded (Strumpf et al., 2005). The PE-like region was less distinct and had significant overlap with the Epiblast-like and TE-like regions; perhaps the molecular distinction of the emerging iPE is as complicated as its natural ICM-to-extraembryonic transition at the late BC stage. Throughout this study we observed traces of gene expression suggesting that iPE and PE-like region cells shared a pluripotent-like origin with the iEPI population, reminiscent of the GATA4+, GATA6+, and PDGFRA+ cells arising at the inner face of BCLH pluripotent cells (Kime et al., 2019). Consideration for PE cells has weighed heavily on various SESs (Tomoda and Kime, 2021), and we suspect that correct hypoblast formation will remain a hinge point for healthy embryoid development.\n\nExperimental procedures\n\nEPISC culture and BCLH reprogramming\n\nEPISC culture and reprogramming was performed as described previously (Kime et al., 2016, 2019), and reprogramming included sodium pyruvate.\n\nESC culture and MERVL reporter integration\n\nC57BL/6N (B6N) ESCs were converted from 3iLIF conditions and cultured in 2iLIF conditions with CTSFES basal medium as described previously (Kime et al., 2019) on iMatrix511-coated 6-well plates. Cells were integrated with and selected for MERVL::RFP reporters (mCherry and D2nmCherry) in piggyback vectors, the same as with EPISCs in our previous study (Kime et al., 2019). After several passages, the two different populations of ESC/ESC2CL cells became obvious and stabilized.\n\nMicroscopy\n\nBrightfield and live-cell RFP and GFP fluorescence was imaged with an Olympus IX71 microscope.\n\nscRNA-seq sampling and processing\n\nCells were dissociated and passed through cell screen cuvettes to isolate mostly healthy single cells that were prepared with 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library & Gel Bead Kit V3.0. Sample libraries were finalized and sequenced on one Hiseq X lane (150 bp PE; Macrogen) for each. The Standard Cell Ranger protocol detected sample chemistry and produced “possorted” BAM files from which the subsequent Primary Analysis workflow in Figure S2A was performed to filter high-quality cells. For analyses shown in and S4, to match loom data counts for TE and PE control cells (Posfai et al., 2021) we prepared our data tables similarly with DESeq2 size factor normalization and log transformation. We integrated samples with intersecting features and Seurat CCA integration across 5,000 anchors. The iEPI, iTE, and iPE cell barcodes were selected from reprogramming cells with the following criteria:\n\niEPI: Zfp42 > 0.1 & Klf2 > 0.1 & EGFP > 0 & Prdm14 > 0.001\n\niTE: Cdx2 > 0 & Gata2 > 0\n\niPE: Gata6 > 0 & (Sox7 > 0 | Gata4 > 0 | Sox17 > 0)\n\nBulk external RNA-seq data processing\n\nFPKM (fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads) tables from Gene Expression Omnibus accession numbers (GEO: GSE98124, GSM2805965, GSM2805966, GSE154398, GSM2054370, GSM2054371, GSM2054375, GSM2054376) were imported and log1p transformed. The first author's name of each selected external sample's related study was appended to the sample name for clarity (see D). Genes of interest were reduced to the 152 gene names of the SCENIC regulons ( B). Our sample (iTE/TE/iPE/PE) relative count tables were added with log1p transformation. Each combined table was scaled together and generated in pheatmap with row-clustering and model cells at the center to clarify the signature patterns.\n\nData and code availability\n\nAll analysis code used in this study is available upon request.
