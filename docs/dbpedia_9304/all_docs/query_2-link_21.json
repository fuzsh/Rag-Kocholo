        "text": "Budget Ant DESC\n\nRated 5.00 out of 5 based on 8 customer ratings\n\n(8 customer reviews)\n\n$15.00\n\nThe Budget Ant DESC has been developed to provide an affordable and robust drive ESC option for Repeat Drive Brushed or any other antweight size drive motor. To address the lack of high-quality budget ESC options available for antweight robots, I searched for and evaluated multiple potential ESC sources. The result? Repeat Robotics Budget Ant DESC. This is a customized Payne dual brushed ESC configured for an optimal driving experience, including onboard mixing, center braking, and pre-soldered connectors for signal and power. It’s the perfect option for your next brushed drive antweight robot!\n\nIn stock\n\nBudget Ant DESC quantity\n\nDescription\n\nAdditional information\n\nReviews (8)\n\nDescription\n\nWARNING: Repeat Drive Brushed motors operated at 4S CANNOT be stalled for an extended period! The motor will overheat and let out smoke, sustaining permanent damage. These ESCs do not have active current limiting, so if the motor is stalled until failure, the FET driving that motor will also fail, permanently damaging the ESC. If this occurs, you will have to replace both the brushed motor and the ESC.\n\nTesting showed that the ESC and motor can be damaged when stalling for as little as 7 seconds on 4S and 25 seconds on 3S. In every test case, the motor smoked first and stopped working before the ESC failed.\n\nFeatures:\n\nNEW! Reduced size: 24x18x5mm\n\nWeight: 7g with wires\n\nVoltage\n\nRecommended: 2-4S\n\nMax: 6S (not recommended)\n\nCurrent: 2A continuous\n\nCenter braking for better motor control\n\nBuilt in mixing (disabled by default)\n\nEnable mixing by cutting the jumper near the i on the back of the board (shown in the last photo)\n\nAuto adjusts to PWM values between 800-1100μs for reverse and 1900-2200μs for forward\n\nFailsafe behavior will stop motors when signal is lost\n\nIntegrated 5V 1.5A BEC output\n\nBEC can power servos on 2-3S\n\nBEC can power receivers on 2-4S\n\nBEC should not be used for servos on 4S\n\nBEC should not be used above 4S (cut red wires from CH1 servo connector)\n\nPre-soldered connectors\n\nPower: XT30U connecter to connect to a battery or power distribution board\n\nSignal: 1 servo connector for Ch2 + 5v(BEC) + GND and a 1 pin CH1 signal connector\n\nPackage includes 1x Budget Ant Dual Brushed ESC\n\nAdditional information\n\nWeight 0.02 kg\n\nOnly logged in customers who have purchased this product may leave a review.\n\nRelated products\n\nAntweight, Drive Motors\n\nRepeat Mini – Mk3 (1pcs)\n\n$20.00 – $40.00\n\nRated 5.00 out of 5\n\nSelect options This product has multiple variants.
