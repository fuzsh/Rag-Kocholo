I mean, he claims to be involved in the process, but it was never stated to what extent.\n\nI even recall seeing a \"revealing\" topic about a year ago on this very forum...\n\nFunny thing, i was trying to contact Flier guys about buying those dual escs, but they refused to send me samples, and then removed the listing completely. Wondering why they put it on show again now...\n\nOct 2, 2014\n\n#7\n\nSilenthunter said:\n\nYes, the first one. 12S with 150A dual.... Is it going to work for a mountain board?

I suspect that's what Alien is doing as well. They are really good and stay cool even under extended braking. The USB tuning is also super easy to use.\n\nBShady\n\n1 kW\n\nJoined\n\nDec 1, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n320\n\nLocation\n\nnew york\n\nOct 2, 2014\n\n#9\n\nvoodoojar said:\n\nAll my ESC are created by Flier and customized to perform well on a skateboard.

But they are very easy to program. I was actually going to ask Bruno if I can use his software on their ESC?\n\ntorqueboards\n\n1 MW\n\nJoined\n\nMay 27, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n2,940\n\nLocation\n\nSan Francisco, CA\n\nOct 2, 2014\n\n#10\n\n@Voodoojar - What firmware are you using?\n\n@Bshady - Yes, you can use their software with the ESC.
