        "text": "I used it for a while.... I think it is a good way to learn your way around a dig set up, but I don't feel like the drag brake is sufficient, and the internal bec is not near enough .... not a bad starting point thou. I have dual mamba micros and love them! Good luck!\n\nI'm assuming those little mambas of yours are the Micro \"Pro\" version?\n\nThis is a question for the electronics forum. But perhaps you should just do a search on \"Novak M2\" and find out for yourself. From what I've read, msg people think it's not as good as it sounds.\n\nSorry about posting this here. I just felt that since this was such a MOA question, I'd get more response from the experienced MOA guys here. It just felt like more of an XR-10 question to me.\n\nU know what guys i have used the search many time and most time it doen't give u what your looking for and have read many hours to not find what i want.\n\nIs it really that big of a deal that some one asked a question just answer it if u can if not don't say anything were all here for the same reason.\n\njust my 2 cents\n\nMike\n\nIt's not ok for newbies to think that searching is a waste of time and reading through posts isn't a good way to look for answers to their questions.\n\nRandomly bringing back a thread from many months ago to ask a question that has already been covered many times is a complete waste of bandwidth.\n\nDon't encourage this behavior, it is extremely poor forum etiquette.\n\nI did not attack the new member of this forum, I believe I guided him in the direction to help him find some answers on his own.\n\nIt's not ok for newbies to think that searching is a waste of time and reading through posts isn't a good way to look for answers to their questions.\n\nRandomly bringing back a thread from many months ago to ask a question that has already been covered many times is a complete waste of bandwidth.\n\nDon't encourage this behavior, it is extremely poor forum etiquette.\n\nI did not attack the new member of this forum, I believe I guided him in the direction to help him find some answers on his own.\n\nYes u didn't bash him and were helpfull in pionting him in the right direction. i just know being pretty new to the rc scene as well that the search does not always work acually it doesn't work that well at all in my opinion,have tried to use it many time with no luck.\n\nSo in my case the saerch buttom has been a complete waste of my time not once have i found what i was looking for using the search,maybe i just don't use the right words being new so i'm just speaking for the new guys that don't know there way around.\n\nAnd some of us don't have hours to read throught everything.\n\nI agree with you 100%. The search feature can be difficult to use, especially for someone just starting out. That's why I never told the guy to go search. I've been involved with online bbs for close to 10 years, and none of the sites I've been a part of have had a very helpful search feature. That being said, I still use the search feature here when I am looking for something specific, and only rarely does it fail me. The trick is to use the advanced search functions and be as specific as possible with your search.\n\nhttp://www.rccrawler.com/forum/search.php?searchid=4860196\n\nThis is an example of a search that took no thought at all to do. I didn't go through every post, but there must be some info on esc choices here.\n\nReally, searching isn't too hard.\n\nI'm just kind of blabbering on now... To make a long story short, there are many more benifits to doing a bit of research before posting a question that has already been asked and answered.\n\nMaybe the mods can move this to chit chat... delete it... whatever... it's all been covered a million times.\n\nU know what guys i have used the search many time and most time it doen't give u what your looking for and have read many hours to not find what i want.\n\nIs it really that big of a deal that some one asked a question just answer it if u can if not don't say anything were all here for the same reason.\n\njust my 2 cents\n\nMike\n\nI'm going to have to agree with Mike here on this one. One of, if not the single most important reason for any forum system is to help each other out if possible. I actually started this thread last year with essentially the same type question although it was a little more specific. I'm sure we all remember how it felt when we were total newbs at some point in time. We wanted specific questions answered just like this guy.\n\nWhat is funny about this is that I'm 100% sure this guy found this older thread by using the search feature. There's no way he \"scrolled down\" to it. He may have already spent time searching and, like many others, did not find the info he wanted.\n\nWith that said, there is not a \"best\" ESC for any RC vehicle - only personal opinions and experiences.....So......My official personal choice for an ESC for the XR10 is indeed the Novak m2 dig esc discussed here in May of last year.\n\nWorks great - no issues in over 11 months. I do not compete so there may be a better ESC out there for that. Then again there may not be. Its up to you and your experiences.\n\nOthers can certainly disagree due to problems with the M2 so they might have another favorite ESC to mention, but the M2 works just fine for me. That does not mean you will automatically have the same exact luck as me. But it also does not mean that you won't.\n\nThis is just my honest opinion. Nothing more."
