        "text": "I decided I would like to build another RC vehicle, ideally one that had not been made before. I am a big fan of old cold war technology and during my Internet searchers I came across a range of vehicles that use parallel screw threads as their primary method of propulsion.\n\nThe vehicle I chose to model was a ZIL 4904. I searched the internet and found a number of good images. There seem to be two variants, the first has a crew compartment on the rear. This ties on with other info I have read that states the vehicle was to be used to rescue soviet cosmonaughts from remote inaccesible locations. The later pictures show the crew compartment removed and replaced with a canvas covered rear end.\n\nPosted using Tinydesk blog app\n\nConcept Design\n\n3D Concept design. I began by modelling the entire model in 3D. I used all the pictures I could find on the net to get the scale correct. I took artistic license on the rear covering and decided it would basically be like the canvas covering on a flat bed lorry.\n\nTrack Design\n\nA major part of the design is going to be screw propulsion design. These are going to be complicated as they need to be both waterproof and buoyant. In my searches I came across an RC toy called the Tyco Twister ( Hot Wheels also sell them under the same name). This had exactly the tracks I was looking for! I bought one off e bay for £10 and proceeded to pull it to bits! I also modelled the screw tracks and added to the 3D model.\n\nMain Frame Design\n\nNext I moved onto the design of the main frame. I thought of balsa wood to start with, but then I discovered the benifits of laser cut ply! I designed the whole frame so it could be cut from a sheet of ply and then simply slotted together. I sent off the file to a manufacturer and they sent me all the parts for around £40. This is a fantastic way of making a model as all the parts are cut out perfectly and are ready to be glued. It does rely on the model being 100% accurate, and the ply was slighty thinner than I had modelled, but it shouldn’t be too much of a problem.\n\nMain Frame Build\n\nThe frame went together very quickly. I used super glue and masking tape to hold the parts in place whilst the glue dried. The glue sets very fast so complete build was only a couple of hours. The structure is very rigid and lightweight. The tricky part was putting the 45 deg angle on some of the pieces, I did it by hand but it would have been much easier and more accurate with a belt sander and a jig.\n\nScrew Propulsion\n\nNext job was to tear down the screw propulsion from the Tyco Twister. This was fairly straightforward, there was a very obstinate press fit post in the centre that i had to resort to melting free with a blow lamp! I won in the end! I also took the entire assembly apart and took the motor out. I will take a trip to the model shop soon to see if I can get uprated motors and a dual speed controller, and some batteries.\n\nAfter some careful sanding the screw propulsion assemblies were ready for instalation to the main frame. These are held in place by a single M5 bolt.\n\nFirst Dry Fit\n\nThis is the first dry fit of main frame, screw propulsion and also a waterproof container for the electronics. For this i ordered a “waterproof” fishing bait box from ebay. It has a clear lid and clips to close it. Upon closing the lid and sunking in a bucket of water it tuens out it is not 100% waterproof, but some grease on the o ring should fix it!\n\nNext i need to paint the main frame and source the electronics. I have alao completed the 3D model of the cab and rear frame for the canvas covering, i have sent these for 3D printing at a cost of about £70. I am looking forward to these coming in!\n\nControl Electronics\n\nPopped in to town to pick up the electronics for the model. I went to P & S hobbies in York. The helpfull man there recommended two Viper Marine 20 ESC. They are a really compact unit and it is potted to make it waterproof. Ideally I would have liked a combimed ESC to allow control with one stick, but this way i will use two sticks, so it will drive like a real tank! These units are a good price at £28 each and I think this is cheaper than a dual ESC. I also bought a 7.2v NiMH battery to power it. Next job is to mount it all in the waterproof case. Another laser cut plywood construction might be in order!\n\nElectronics Housing\n\nStarted work on the electronics enclosure today. I like all the electronics to be neat ao it is easy to diagnose any problems. I mounted it all on a piece of ply offcut from the main frame and some spare balsa offcuts. All the components are now mounted but the wiring needs to be soldered on the underside of the board. Also I need to work on getting the wires to the motor out of the box in a water proof manor.\n\n3D Printed Parts\n\nThe 3D printed parts arrived today. The detail on the cab is really good, I made the walls 0.7mm thin to keep the cost down, it may have been a little too thin as it is very flexible. I think I will add some braceing behind to stiffen it up. I bought some acrylic paint today and started testing on some old 3D printed parts, just to make sure it takes okay.\n\nAfter some tests with acrylic paint it seems the best way is to dilute the paint with water, the material takes in the paint very well and only needs a couple of coats. To get the black lines I used a permenant marker.\n\nPaint, paint, paint.\n\nPainted the main frame red. Striped the tracks and primed with plastic primer. Tomorrow a coat of black paint. I also wired up the electronics and added connectors for the motors.\n\nMore Paint\n\nNot too much to report. Put three coats of black paint on the screw drive assemblies, these are now ready for re-build.\n\nI did some work on the rear cover, I beefed up the 3d printed frame with some scrap ply and covered it with tissue paper, this is now ready for a few coats of dope. Hopefully the next posts will be closer to finished state. I also picked up some figures for the cab.\n\nFirst trial assembly\n\nIts all coming together now! Screw drive are painted, re wired, and assembled. I’ve added silicoln sealant to keep the water out. These are now assembled to the main frame.\n\nThe cab has acrylic windows fitted. The rear cover has warped when i doped the tissue paper, i may be able to straighten it out, i am hoping when i paint it canvas colour it will look ‘authentic’ rather than ‘rubbish’. In hindsight 3d printing was the wrong choice for the canvas cover frame, i should have made it from wire (old coat hangers) or made it from laser cut ply. Oh well you live and lean! I will persivere with the one I have now it is started.\n\nThe star wars figures are about the correct scale (1:20) does beg the question how would tou get into the cab!\n\nAlmost There\n\nIts all coming together now! I added LED to the cab, these came from a torch from the pound shop. I disassembled them and pushed them into the holes in the cab, these are wired up to a servo connector so the power can be supplied by the reciever. For some reason one lights brighter than others despite them being wired in parallel.\n\nThe motors now have connectors on and are plugged into the electronics box.\n\nThe cab is screwed on with four selftappers drom underneath. I also fastened the driver in place. He is a star wars figure, not sure what he is but he looks a little bit soviet, so fits the theme.\n\nAlmost complete, some work on the rear cover, and then some work to make sure it floats.\n\nI took a trial run in water last week and it turns out the model is too heavy to float! So i made a keel from balsa wood to fit under the main frame. I have assembled this and glued it on. I filled it full of expanding foam to keep the water out, then sprayed it all red again. Turns out the paint eats the foam!\n\nTime for another trial run when the paint dries.\n\nTwo steps forward….\n\nSo i didn’t have to keep filling the bath up I filled one of my toolboxes with water (after removing all the tools!). This allowed me to trial run the balence. Turns out the model is super top heavy. To counter this i dug a lot of foam out of the keel and reconfigured the battery pack to drop down into it. This helped but the model is very unstable and could roll over very easily. I added some lead in the keel, but it is still unstable. Drastic measures were called for so I attached the screw drives to the side of the keal. This configuration looks similar to the origional Tyco Twister I took the parts from! It seems to work well though , the pictures are in the kitchen sink, as it is now too large for the toolbox! I also drilled the screw drive housing to let the water in quicker. Water gets in anyway and the holes just make sure both screw drives flood at the same rate and ensure balence.\n\nSomewhere along the way I decided that the box housing the electronics also neede to go so the electronics could be mounted in the hull.\n\nTrial in the snow.\n\nSo the snow came and that was the perfect oppertunity for a snow trial! During the week I have drilled some holes in the screw pontoos to let the water drain in and out. This revealled the orange motor pods underneath so I stripped them down and painted black. I also added some expanding foam in the open cavities to keep the water out. I did have all the electronics crammed in above the batteries, but it was messy so I have reverted back to the waterproof box i used in the first place!\n\nThe trial in the snow worked well, only issue is that the keel is a little low so it can get grounded.\n\nNext step is to tidy up the electronics and build the rear cover.\n\nSnow trial Movie\n\nWater test\n\nFirst trial in water. I again use some zip ties to attach my camera to the transmitter so i could film and control. Unfotunatly the camera packed up in the cold so a short vid! It works better in the water than on snow.\n\nScarborough outing\n\nToday I took a trip to the seaside. I ran the Zil on Northstead Manor Lake in Scarborough. Nice smooth water and a good test. Really inspired me to finish the rear cover and plan a new project!\n\nRear covering\n\nFinally got around to designing the rear cover. The 3d printed version was too weedy; I tried fabricating a frame with coat hangers, but it looked rubbish and I couldn’t solder it. So I designed it in 3d and sent it to the good people at http://www.falcon-aviation.co.uk/. These guys made main the frame for me from 3mm ply, so it was a natural choice for the rear cover. I finalised the design and sent it off as a dwg file so fingers crossed I will have some lovely laser cut ply parts soon!\n\nTrial from water to land\n\nAnother trial at the lake. This time to asses how wellthe ZIL handles the transition from water to land. A lot depands on the surface. The screw drives work best on soft surfaces like sand. The surface in the video is a little muddy and quite rocky. I am happy with the result, one mod i may make in the future is the keel, it is necessary for buoyancy, but at present sits too low and can often cause the ZIL to ground and stop moving.\n\nComplete!\n\nI recived the laser cut parts for the rear cover, one was missin so i fabricated it from scrap balsa. The cover went together very easily. I then covered it in tissue paper and shrinking dope, then a quick spray of paint. I built small hooks into the cover to hold it in place, removal simply requires a pin to be removed and the whole cover can be withdrawn backwards and lifted off to access the electronics. The electronics are somewhat messy, i may get around to tidying them up one day!"
