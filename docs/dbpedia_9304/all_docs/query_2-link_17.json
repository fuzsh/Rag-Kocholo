        "text": "Each esc has a range from 0-100. DIG works by flicking the switch you've dedicated for DIG on the radio, resulting in one esc being set to 0, while the other is still at 100% drive.\n\nYou can mix the motors to give more or less drive bias front to rear. 5% increments is about right.\n\nThere are many advantages with overdriving both front and rear. Practicing with both on the same lines will give you the best idea on the different effects. Overdriving the front on climbs will stop the rear getting more grip than it needs and unloading the front end, making the front pull away from the rock.\n\nOverdriving the rear can help with 'clod stall', which happens when the weight of the truck is on the rear axle, making the rear motor stall slightly. overdring the rear on a diagonal climb can stop the front from losing grip and 'washing out'. That's just a few examples.\n\nOn most MOA axles, the rear motor needs the polarity reversing. I think it's only the XR10 axles that need the front motor reversing. If you just swap the motor wires over, the motors may be set with slight advanced timing, which will result in the rear motor to run retarded, and you don't want that. It's fine if both motors are set to zero timing though.\n\nBest way is to loosen the two screws in the endbell and turn the endbell 180 degrees."
