​Today we look at a Mobo award winning RnB group that did well in the UK in the early part of the decade. Today we look at a group that had some really catchy hits – Big Brovaz.

The group was formed in 2001 and was originally made up of Cherise, Dion, Nadia, J-Rock, Flawless and Randy. The group was formed by a producer called Fingaz who already worked under the name Big Brovaz. The group were asked to come along and showcase their talent on a compliation album that was being created of underground R&B and hip hop artists that were from London.The producers made the members work together to produce some of the songs on the album and because of this process their chemistry shone through and formed the group as we know.

Their undergound record caught the attention of such things as the MOBOs as it sold over 2000 copies and lead to the signing of the group and leading them into their breakthrough debut album, Nu Flow. Their first chart single was called Nu Flow and was released in 2002, it became a huge hit all around Europe and even went into the top 3 in the United Kingdom. Other singles off the album included OK, My Favourite Things and Baby Boy which all did very well in the charts. The group did so well their debut album became platnum certified.

After the success the group had between the years of 2002-2004 with their debut album, a film appearance (Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed) and successful hits things started to go down hill. Flawless got stopped at LAX airport for smuggling drugs and was fired from the group. Even though the group decided to peddle on, their next single off their second albume was called “Yours Fatally” – it received good reviews however it did not catch on or become a hit and it lead to the grup being dropped by their label.

So today, lets have a look at just some of the songs that made Big Brovaz as great as they were.
