Big Brovaz who are supporting the Babes, are best known for their hits, Nu Flow, Favourite Things, and We Wanna Thank You.

Comprising of three girls, Cherise, Dion and Nadia and two boys, J-Rock and Randy, plus two producers, Skillz and Fingaz, they released their debut single in October, 2002 and were dubbed the next big thing.

I caught up with Dion, aged 23, to find out what it's like being in a top R&B bands.

Dion, whose father is a deacon, tells me that singing is something that is second nature to her, as she grew up flexing her vocal chords in a church choir.

Her brothers and sisters also sang, as well as her mother.

"When I was four, I wanted to be the fastest woman in the world, or a singer," says Dion.

"I ran for London but I had a leg injury, and I was in a lot of pain, so I started singing.

"I decided to give 100 per cent to singing when I was 17. I entered competitions and stuff and sang whatever songs I liked with instrumental backing tracks."

Big Brovaz was brought together by band member Skillz, one half of a budding South London production team, who already used the name Big Brovaz.

The various members' singing and rapping saw them asked by the Big Brovaz production team to feature alongside other underground London R&B/hip hop artists on a compilation album they were putting together called Big Brovaz - Watching You.

On the compilation album, rather than giving individual artists a track of their own, the producers decided to feature several artists on the same track.

This soon created a different sound, and the chemistry between the different performers worked so well that slowly Big Brovaz turned from a compilation album into a group.

"I didn't expect it to take off so quickly," says Dion.

"It was real quick - we were running around like mad chickens but now everything's settled down."

Big Brovaz debut single Nu Flow, charted at number three, then OK hit the charts at number 7, and Favourite Things at number 2.

The band's debut album, Nu Flow is now gold, and fans should expect the next album to be released in September.

"It's untitled, but the first single will be out in July or August," says Dion.

Films

Aside from hitting the top 10 in Europe, New Zealand and Australia, Big Brovaz have broken into the world of films, and perform and play cameo roles in the Scooby Doo 2 movie released in April this year.

The single they play in the movie is We Wanna Thank You.

"We got the job through our first single," says Dion.

"It's very different from making a video which you know is going to take a long time.

"With a film, they need you for 10 minutes then they don't need you for about four hours."

Gates for the concert, at Ragley Hall, near Stratford-upon-Avon, open at 5pm with the concert beginning at around 7.30pm. It will finish at 10.30pm with a fire work display.
