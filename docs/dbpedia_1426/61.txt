It's reported that Big Brovaz have been dropped by their record label after their single didn't make the top ten.

Their new release - Yours Fatally - only entered this week's charts at Number 15.

Big Brovaz - J-Rock, Randy, Nadia, Cherise and Dion - have had loads of problems since band member Flawless was kicked out in March.

Flawless was stopped at Los Angeles Airport and was found to have a small amount of cannabis with him.

He was arrested, sent home to the UK and so the stars decided they couldn't have him in the band any more.

The group haven't had a Top Ten single since Baby Boy last September.

The band's management have said that Sony has refused to renew the band's contract.

But the management company will be sticking by the band.

A spokesperson told CBBC Newsround: "They've got talent and after discussions with them, we wish to pursue their career as a band.

"We think they've got loads of creative potential and are still as strong today as they were as the beginning."
