[Intro (Skillz)]

Ladies and Gentlemen

Boys and girls

It is my pleasure to introduce to you all

The Finest

The Brightest

The Meanest

The strongest the very best of them all

The South London collective group

Known as... for goodness sake Rodger, who is it?

[Chorus]

This is big bro (bro)

Takin over this show (show)

With this nu flow (flow)

You need to listen up and feel this shit (shit)

Coz we won't quit (quit)

We make them hits and stack them chips

Who's this?

[Flawless]

It's Flawless I came for the doe

As soon I step in the door

I see that you're hating my glow

The crew, the flow we're soon to blow

We're tired of being this poor

We're havin to sleep on the floor

And workin a 9 to 5

Just like a 5 dollar whore

Knowin we're worth more

We simply had to settle the score

Thats why you see these albums and these singles in the store

It's Big Brova baby

Tryin to cash some major figures

You mess with my cheese

and I'll switch just like schwarzenegger

[Chorus]

This is big bro (bro)

Takin over this show (show)

With this nu flow (flow)

You need to listen up and feel this shit (shit)

Coz we won't quit (quit)

We make them hits and stack them chips

Who's this?

[Dion]

It's Dion

I bet you won't forget my name

I probably maybe

Gonna get inside ya brain

My family does the same

It's BB's time to reign

We're doin them platinum things

I know you're not ready for me

[Cherise]

You move you lose

Can't wear my shoes

Cherise brand new

Me and my crew

Don't try our flow

If ya tongue dont roll

Ya lose control

We're just way too cold

[Chorus]

This is big bro (bro)

Takin over this show (show)

With this nu flow (flow)

You need to listen up and feel this shit (shit)

Coz we won't quit (quit)

We make them hits and stack them chips

Who's this?

[J Rock and Skillz]

Hey yo this is J Rock

And I got more Skillz than average

Put us together man

We're more than all of y'all can manage

Cause we be the baddest at it

This here took years of practice

and now its only more money and its more madness

Stack up on a daily basis

We travelled so many places

Switching so many chicks

We're mixing up the names with faces

They see the ice and they trip

They like to ride in the whip

But all I wanna know is if these girls is riding the aggggh!

Who's, who's, who's this?

[Nadia]

This is the N-A-D-I,

You didn't think I was coming at ya

Givin you people a different kind of Big Brova flava

I bet y'all didn't think I be ridin these beats and makin no paper

Well I guess I'm a paper chaser player and it's in my nature

[Chorus (x2)]

This is big bro (bro)

Takin over this show (show)

With this nu flow (flow)

You need to listen up and feel this shit (shit)

Coz we won't quit (quit)

We make them hits and stack them chips

Who's this?

[Woman]

Uh Huh

[Man]

Uh Huh

[Woman]

Uh Huh

[Man]

Uh Huh

[Woman]

Who's, who's this?
