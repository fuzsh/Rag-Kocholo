        "text": "Big Brovaz were a MOBO award-winning R&B and hip hop music group from London, England. In their seven-year career they released two studio albums and eight singles. There were three line-up changes with two of the original members leaving halfway through.\n\nIn 2006 the popularity of the group was at a low point due to bad press and the only two female members launching their own band Booty Luv which was taking off following the success of their debut single “Boogie 2nite”. After their second album failed to chart and with low sales of their last two singles, the band decided to split. In May 2012 the 4 members from the third line-up toured Australia with 3 of the members of S Club, the reunion was short lived with no full tour or new material surfacing.\n\nThe Big Brovaz – Watching You compilation was a highly successful underground release and sold over two thousand copies. The live shows to promote the release built up the reputation of the producers and artists on the record.\n\nA track from the album which featured west London R&B singer Cherise was picked up by the organizer of the annual MOBO award and she was asked to compete in the annual Mobo Unsigned talent competition, walking away with first prize. Cherise was signed and later release her own solo album. Following this, the group was picked up by Sony records."
