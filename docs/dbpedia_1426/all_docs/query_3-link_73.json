        "text": "The group came to prominence last year with their debut single \"Nu Flow\", taken from the album of the same name and this song proved popular with the V crowds.\n\nRecent hit \"Favourite Things\" also went down well.\n\nSeveral women could be seen almost fainting at the front of the stage as band members J-Rock and Randy removed their shirts in the sweltering temperatures.\n\nAnd, for anyone who didn't know, they reminded us that their new single is coming out on September 1.\n\nPublished Sunday August 17, 2003"
