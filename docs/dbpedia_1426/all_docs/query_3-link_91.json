Because I got a funny feeling This was meant to be Without you I'd be lost, I need you next to me Preferably in a house full Of luxuries and little kids From day one I was sprung, Knew you was gonna be the one 'Cause my heart spoke for the Very first time in a long while And every time you smile, I can see Us walking up the aisle with you Carrying my child C'mon My love for you won't ever end You'll always be apart of me As long as time keeps on passing by You'll be my baby boy If you were to go, I don't know You're the only one who Sweeps me off my feet Makes my soul go week The only one who makes My heart want to beat and I, I could never live without you You know that what I feel Has to be true 'Cause you're my, my sweet love Ever since the first time, That I looked into your eyes I knew that you were Gonna be mine Feeling you from the inside When you're not by my side You're the only girl That's on my mind I never knew a love like this, A long so strong A vision so picture perfect It could never be wrong Along the way, you're gonna See you belong wit Jay I might have to marry you one day baby eh My love for you won't ever end You'll always be apart of me As long as time keeps on passing by You'll be my baby boy My love for you won't ever end You'll always be apart of me As long as time keeps on passing by You'll be my baby boy\n\nStruggling with Baby Boy?
