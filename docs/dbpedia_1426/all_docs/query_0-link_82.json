        "text": "Notes:\n\nIt should be noted that 2004 was a 53-week chart year, so any direct comparison for the full year may be slightly biased.\n\nThe above table refers to actual sales (based on my weekly estimates) which should not be confused with BPI trade deliveries or official OCC/CIN panel sales figures (as shown below).\n\nNotes:\n\nThis table refers to the first half of 2005, ie. weeks 1–26 only.\n\nThe official number of downloads in the second Quarter as published by the BPI (5,562,638) is apparently incorrect: for all weeks in QII (ie. weeks 14–26)—except one—I have an official number for downloads from Alan Jones' column in Music Week. For the one missing week I made an estimate: my 13-week total is therefore 5,211,657. The resulting gap to the \"official\" number is 350,981. I suspect that OCC seem to measure a different quarter (my own total for weeks 13–26 would be 5,587,465)."
