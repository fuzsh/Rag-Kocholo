        "text": "I like this song its prettty cool, dont like the fact it sounds just like a bodyroxx track (yeh yeh)\n\nTheir like a male more hard core booty luv now.\n\nHere some info on Party Dark\n\nBranded as a rare mixture of Electro House, cheeky lyrics and fire-like performances, Party Dark will soon be taking the music and clubbing industry by storm.\n\nThis highly likeable “House Rap Duo” by the name of Randy & J-Rock have been keeping their heads and hearts busy in the studio and rubbing shoulders with some of the biggest underground Fidget, Electro and Dubstep names this side of 2009.\n\nParty Dark’s debut single, ‘Is That You?’ (already tipped for number one chart success and underground takeover) is a bouncy and highly infectious electro house track that will have you wondering what the world was like pre-Party Dark and why it took us so long to bring you such an act…\n\nWell, rumors have it that Randy & J Rock have been very busy & received international fame not too long ago as part of a highly successful UK act that spawned over 8 singles, 3 albums, TV network deals and movie roles as recently as 2007! In fact their first 5 singles reached the Top 3 positions in the UK Chart (consecutively) and held the number 2 entry position for over 4 months – internationally!\n\nLink to the song : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTO7V9uyjAs"
