It had to have been early-mid 1994 or early 1995, my then-stepdad Wade had took me the local spot, “Crockett’s Records, Tapes & CDs.” My plan that day was to buy DJ Doo Wop’s “Bad Boys Vol. 2” mixtape. When I got home, I wasn’t even 10 minutes into the tape before Wade overheard something he apparently didn’t approve of and made me take the tape back to the store, unfortunately, and exchange it for something else, and I, of course, was NOT happy. It didn’t take me long before a certain tape caught my eye. Remember the days when the mixtape game was a competitive environment and the local spots had all sorts of exclusive tapes from multiple DJs?

I remember liking the tape a lot at the time, even though I could barely hear the crowd and I could CLEARLY hear Capri’s voice as he commanded the crowd’s attention. I can’t recall what actually happened to the tape, but I did hold on to it for a long time. In addition, I knew of Capri from his stint as the DJ on “Def Comedy Jam” and during a period when I wanted to become a DJ, he really was one of my first influences.\n\nIn reference to this album, which is more of a compilation, I’ve always been aware of it, but never got a chance to check it out, and honestly I don’t ever recall seeing it in any of the spots I bought CDs from in 1998. All these years later, I was finally able to get my hands…"
