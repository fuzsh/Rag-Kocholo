        "text": "First things first — this list should have been WAY bigger than just 50 albums.\n\nI know many times we tend to romanticize the 90s (much to the chagrin of younger fans…) but, nostalgia aside, it was a truly transformative time for music.\n\nThe 80s gave us Hip-Hop’s Golden Age, those halcyon years that would become the foundation for the genre. But the 90s is when it all came together. Flows became more intricate. Production became more layered. Themes and storytelling became more vivid (and brazen, in some cases). Legends were made and classics were delivered, weekly in some cases. By the end of the decade, hip-hop would begin its rise to becoming a commercial juggernaut.\n\nBut without the 90s — and it’s endless array of classic albums that evolved the game on an almost yearly basis — hip-hop wouldn’t be the cultural touchstone it is today.\n\nAnd that’s why just shouting out 50 albums almost feels like a disservice. I could have done 100 albums easy.\n\nWhy didn’t I? Well, to be real, I didn’t want my R&B fans screaming SEE HE’S BIASED for only giving them 50 albums on my previous 90s countdown. I’m a fair man.\n\nPlus, as we celebrate 50 years of hip-hop this year, it only feels right.\n\nSo get ready to stan your faves and threaten to key my car as I revisit and rank the 50 best albums of the best decade of hip-hop.\n\nAs always, A REMINDER:\n\nObviously I couldn’t listen to EVERY SINGLE ALBUM released during the decade, so I’m sure I missed something. I’m only human. SUPER-human, some would say, but human nonetheless. If MC Fax Machine dropped a six-star classic in France in 1993, yeah, maybe I missed it. So shout it out in the comments.\n\nThis is not a list of my FAVORITE albums, if you couldn’t tell by the disappointing lack of Missy Elliott on the main list. There are quite a few honorable mentions that I really, REALLY wanted to squeeze in, but I couldn’t justify their placement above greater works. I’m the last unbiased reviewer on this platform, trust me.\n\nAnd on a related note, this list was mostly determined by the QUALITY of the album, not its legacy. There are several albums in the Honorable Mentions that are much more influential than those on the main list. But influence is another convo entirely — Most Influential Albums will be a separate list in the future.\n\nShout out to these Honorable Mentions. They all deserved to have made the full list:\n\nMobb Deep, Hell on Earth\n\nBlack Moon, Enta da Stage\n\nThe Pharcyde, Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde\n\nBahamadia, Kollage\n\nThe Roots, Things Fall Apart\n\nEminem, The Slim Shady LP\n\nBig L, Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous\n\nEric B & Rakim, Don’t Sweat the Technique\n\nBlack Sheep, A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing\n\nLil Kim, Hard Core\n\nMissy Elliott, Supa Dupa Fly\n\nGang Starr, Hard to Earn\n\nMakaveli, The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory\n\nCamp Lo, Uptown Saturday Night\n\n2pac, All Eyez on Me\n\nMain Source, Breaking Atoms\n\nGeto Boys, We Can’t Be Stopped\n\nDe La Soul, Buhloone Mindstate\n\nCommon, Resurrection\n\nCypress Hill, Black Sunday\n\n50. Queen Latifah, Black Reign (1993)\n\nGIVE IT TO ’EM, QUEEN! My love of female rap pioneer Missy Elliott is common knowledge around these parts, but I don’t spend nearly enough time spreading the gospel of the original queen of rap. Queen Lah’s Black Reign is arguably her most defining work, loaded with anthems of pride and empowerment. Latifah’s also an extremely underrated storyteller and her prowess is on full display here. Women’s empowerment and black pride never sounded so good.\n\n49. Capone-N-Noreaga, The War Report (1997)\n\nIt’s amazing that this album even saw the light of day. After Capone violated his parole and was locked down for awhile, partner NORE enlisted the help of his New York brethren and completed one of the most influential East Coast rap albums in the game. While it infamously became another skirmish in the East Coast/West Coast nonsense of the late 90s, there’s more to this album than beef — it became one of the last bastions of East Coast grittiness before things got … shinier later in the decade.\n\n48. Mos Def, Black on Both Sides (1999)\n\nWidely regarded as one of the crown jewels of “conscious” hip-hop, Yasiin Bey — in his Mighty Mos days — delivered a potent mix of social commentary and Black liberation. “Ms. Fat Booty” showcases some of the best storytelling of the latter 90s while heavy themes like those in “New World Water” still resonate today. Plus, if you want bars, there’s plenty of those too. This album remains the reason why fans still yearn for the next Mos solo project.\n\n47. Smif-N-Wessun, Dah Shinin’ (1995)\n\nWe don’t hear much about them today, but man, Boot Camp Clik was one of hip-hop’s most elite squads in the early 90s. Smif-N-Wessun, AKA Cocoa Brovaz (a name that always reminded me of cereal for some reason…) paved the way for the supergroup’s early success, thanks to this East Coast standout release. Fueled by production from Da Beatminerz, Smif-N-Wessun create an air-tight, jazzy effort filled with fury and humor. It’s another album that feels overlooked today in favor of major label releases of the time. It’s worth revisiting.\n\n46. MF Doom, Operation: Doomsday (1999)\n\nThis is how you do a debut. In an era defined by Cash Money Records’ avarice and the Ruff Ryders’ ruggedness, MF DOOM threw on his cape for one of the most defining underground rap releases of all time. Between the esoteric rhymes and intriguing mix of production — from soul samples to street bangers — it was groundbreaking. I contend that “Red and Gold” is still one of the best beats in rap history. He’d go on to outdo himself with other releases but, personally speaking, this is by far my favorite DOOM album. Remember, all caps when you spell the man’s name.\n\n45. UGK, Ridin Dirty (1996)\n\nPimp C and Bun B have always been hip-hop royalty in Houston, but by the late 90s, their legend grew beyond Southern borders. Their influence can be heard in nearly every high-profile Southern spitter today. Ridin Dirty is that blueprint, a showcase of Southern soul and swagger. Pimp C brings boundless charisma while Bun B delivered seemingly endless lyrical body blows. Even without videos or a major label push, Ridin Dirty still stands as the group’s most defining work.\n\n44. Redman, Muddy Waters (1996)\n\nSome consider Red’s groundbreaking debut to be his best. Others might lean on the sophomore release. But in my eyes, it’s the third installment in the Red trilogy that’s truly the king. Listen to all three albums in succession, as I did for this post, and you can really hear Redman’s evolution over each release. Yet when I think of the definitive Redman sound, I think of this album — the energy, the personality, the humor, the effortless flows and the infinite bars. Muddy Waters is the maturation of Redman, his best work to date.\n\n43. Nas, I Am (1999)\n\nY’all have been yelling at me for my undying love (see what I did, there) of this album for years now. And I still believe that so much of the criticism of I Am lies in what it wasn’t, not what it is. Remember, after the original concept of this album was bootlegged into oblivion, Nas had to regroup, which included reaching for mainstream listeners. But trust, that’s not always a bad thing: Nas injected artistry into MTV-ready songs and gave street bangers a commercial appeal. When the great DJ Premier can give a gritty track like “Nas Is Like” mainstream appeal, you know a master is at work. It’s one of the best examples of an album remaining true to its roots while also pricking the ears of new listeners. It wasn’t the original plan, but I think things worked out very well in the end.\n\n42. Pharoahe Monch, Internal Affairs (1999)\n\nUnless you take a deep dive into underground rap Twitter, Monch is a name that isn’t often mentioned among rap’s elite. I dare you to continue to make that mistake after listening to Internal Affairs. The solo debut from the Organized Konfusion standout isn’t for the faint of heart — it’s aggressive, brazen and filled with bars that will cause the Think Piece Patrol to break their fingers in response. Monch’s menacing bars and forceful wordplay certainly isn’t for everyone but Internal Affairs remains a hidden gem in a decade filled with groundbreaking music.\n\n41. LL Cool J, Mama Said Knock You Out (1990)\n\nDON’T CALL IT A COMEBACK! Yes, this was the album that made the phrase iconic. After LL’s previous effort was panned for pandering way too much to the mainstream, Cool J hit back at critics insanely hard. Mama Said Knock You Out was a potent reminder of LL’s lyrical prowess — and yes, the radio fare was still here but much better balanced. The haters were silenced, hit records were born, LL’s reputation was restored and one of the most defining records of the era was immortalized.\n\n40. Heltah Skeltah, Nocturnal (1996)\n\nIf you couldn’t tell, 1996 was a STACKED year for rap, so much so that several gems fly under the radar when y’all engage in your Twitter squabbles about the year’s best. One album that needs entirely more love is Heltah Skeltah’s debut. I was determined to show it love here. The twin towers of Boot Camp Clik hit hard with this one, a masterclass in lyrical warfare that defined 90s East Coast rap. Foreboding, gritty production and an unrelenting delivery makes this the forefather of all those Griselda-esque releases that get so much acclaim today. It’s renowned as an underground hip-hop classic, and while it ain’t for everyone, it’s easy to see why. Rock and Ruck were kings of a bygone era.\n\n39. Busta Rhymes, Extinction Level Event: The Final World Front (1998)\n\nI feel like we never give Busta his flowers until he pops up on a tribute concert, unleashes his manic fury and retreats into the abyss for another few years. But I’m not afraid to give the Dungeon Dragon long-overdue love. ELE doesn’t often get the glowing press that Busta’s debut and sophomore albums receive, but make no mistake — this is the quintessential Busta Rhymes album. Sure, it’s crammed with memorable tracks (“Gimmie Some More” and “What’s It Gonna Be” among them), but the album’s diversity is what sets it apart from others on the list. East Coast and West Coast sounds abound, along with a touch of horrorcore to accentuate the album’s apocalyptic theme. And, of course, it wouldn’t be a Busta album without his light-speed raps and inexhaustible energy. ELE is bizarre, intelligent, downright exhausting but impossibly addictive. This album IS Busta Rhymes.\n\n38. Dr. Dre, 2001 (1999)\n\nAm I the only one bothered that this album is named 2001 but dropped in 99? Yeah, yeah, I know about the legal wrangling that caused a last-minute name change but that just adds to the mystique of this album. Indeed, Dr. Dre had a huge mountain to climb in his attempt to replicate the success of his classic debut, as well as distance himself from the ghosts of Death Row’s past. 2001 doesn’t reach the heights of the original but it’s more than a worthy successor to The Chronic. Dre clearly had something to prove and called in nearly every heavy-hitter in hip-hop to help him out. The result is a celebration of hip-hop’s past, present and future, all fueled by stellar production. I wasn’t a big fan of this album back in 99 but it’s grown on my greatly over the years. It’s worthy of praise.\n\n37. Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, E. 1999 Eternal (1995)\n\nBONE BONE BONE BONEEEEEEEEE! Believe me, we hadn’t heard ANYTHING like Bone Thugs when they debuted in 90s. Their rapid-fire flows married with harmonies instantly set them apart, producing insanely catchy songs. And while Bone is still remembered for those radio hits, their albums often are forgotten. E. 1999 Eternal is too good to be lost to time, however. Bone’s ability to weave melodies into such hard-hitting tales is still astounding. Bone seemed to exist in another plane of rap existence, and to this day no one has replicated their magic. And we still miss Uncle Charles, y’all.\n\n36. A Tribe Called Quest, People’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm (1990)\n\nObviously, when you think of the words “Tribe” and “classic albums” your mind immediately goes to Low End and/or Marauders. But I’m making the case for Instinctive Travels to be held in just as high regard, considering how it both pioneered a new sound and has some of the most memorable singles in rap history. The mellow instrumentals that became the hallmark of early 90s hip-hop began to take shape here, along with elevating Q-Tip as the hottest new MC in the game. Instinctive Travels changed the course of rap history and we’re still feeling the reverberations today.\n\n35. 2pac, Me Against The World (1995)\n\nThe debate over Pac’s greatest works typically comes down to All Eyez on Me and this album — and in my eyez, there’s no question which one is strongest. Me Against the World is Pac at his most introspective — he’s questioning his place in the world while busting back at all his Hennessey Enemies. Sonically it’s a lot more mellow than his previous releases, which allows listeners to connect with Pac’s themes. But it’s also the most consistent in terms of production, an issue that has plagued almost all his other releases from hitting the next level. The only thing that keeps it from reaching that coveted 5-star status is a minor dip in consistency on the album’s second half. But that’s a minor quibble. Me Against the World is truly Pac at his best. His legacy may be extremely complicated, but this album solidifies his greatest.\n\n34. Outkast, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik (1994)\n\nI still remember my friends singing “Player’s Ball” at the bus stop, which was my first introduction to Outkast. Yeah, ninth-graders singing about pimps got my attention real quick. And nearly 30 years later, this album is still the measuring stick for Southern hip hop. Consider it Dre and Big Boi’s coming of age tale — two young men enamored with the lifestyles of pimps and high-rollers but grounded by the realities they face daily in the hood. Fans could relate. And of course, the duo’s mind-bending wordplay and Southern slang made every bar instantly quotable. And it was JUST the beginning.\n\n33. Wu-Tang Clan, Wu-Tang Forever (1997)\n\nHow do you follow up on one of the greatest rap albums of all time? If you’re the Wu, you release a classic single — the groundbreaking “Triumph” — drop a double-disc album, and win. Again. Double-disc albums are a risky gamble; there’s often an overload of content and way too much filler. Hovering around 30 tracks, Wu-Tang Forever was definitely robust and is even a bit overwhelming on first listen. But the set is just so cohesive and engrossing that you keep coming back for more. This album could have been a disaster, instead it just added to the Clan’s mythical legacy.\n\n32. Scarface, The Diary (1994)\n\nAfter branching away from the Geto Boys, it took a sec for Scarface to find his footing as a solo artist. By 1994, that wasn’t a problem. The Diary is still heralded as his best work and a Southern rap classic. Face possesses one of the most distinct voices in hip-hop and his flow is intoxicating on every track. And for fans of storytelling like myself, you won’t find a better orator than Scarface, whose insights into life and especially death are as intriguing as they are chilling. If you’re questioning just why Face is still considered an all-time great today, let this album be your starting point.\n\n31. Goodie Mob, Soul Food (1995)\n\nSpeaking of Southern classics, maybe it’s time we give Goodie Mob that moniker too. The Mob often feels overshadowed by the incomparable success of their brothers from Outkast but Goodie’s debut goes toe-to-toe with even Kast’s best work. For those who feel Outkast got a little too extraterrestrial over time, Goodie stays firmly down to Earth, gratefully embracing their Southern roots and shining a light on both the struggles and stereotypes that define their home. In my opinion, Soul Food features some of the best depictions of southern life, both it’s beauty and its thorns. Another underappreciated gem.\n\n30. Mobb Deep, The Infamous (1995)\n\nIt’s hard to quantify the importance of The Infamous if you weren’t around to witness the highly competitive 90s rap scene. The West Coast’s G-Funk-fueled sounds dominated the early years of the decade until the gritty street tales of Nas, the Wu-Tang Clan and, yes, Mobb Deep, began to swing the pendulum back in favor of the East. The Infamous is one of the most defining albums of the boom-bap era, with Havoc and Prodigy maturing from promising juveniles to full-fledged leaders. Filled with timeless anthems, instantly recognizable production, vivid storytelling and beloved album cuts, The Infamous was a star-making release. The Infamous is unquestionably one of the most important albums in rap history.\n\n29. GZA, Liquid Swords (1995)\n\nLiquid Swords might as well have been named 36 Chambers Part 2 — at times, it almost feels like a bonus disc to that historic original album. GZA’s otherworldly wordplay is at its peak here, as is RZA’s production. Both worked in tandem to craft a true spiritual successor to the Wu’s debut. And they pulled it off.\n\n28. Souls of Mischief, 93 ’til Infinity (1993)\n\nAlthough putting together massive rankings like this can be brutal (especially when I have to leave off albums that I KNOW will cause y’all to throw tantrums), the most fun part is rediscovering albums you once loved. I haven’t revisited Souls of Mischief’s debut in probably 15–20 years until researching this post and IT’S STILL SO GOOD. Their distinctive flow was decades ahead of its time and while the title track still gets praise today, the overall album is even better, thanks to its laser-focus and rock-solid consistency. There isn’t a weak track in the bunch. 93 ’til Infinity was a true standout during the rise of the gangsta movement, proving there was still space for positive, uplifting tracks.\n\n27. Outkast, ATLiens (1996)\n\nThis wasn’t just a sharp left turn for Outkast, they flew completely off-world. True to its name, ATLiens was an otherwordly creative departure from anything we had ever heard in hip hop. Andre and Sir Lucious traded in the Caddys for spaceships, steering clear of the era’s bling and excess to tackle more meaningful issues. The dark tone and heavy themes can be pretty intimidating on first listen but for a pair of MCs who always felt like outsiders, it was the perfect step in the evolution of their narrative. It was a huge risk that paid off with yet another classic album.\n\n26. Ghostface Killah, Ironman (1996)\n\nThe Wu has more than it’s fair share of great solo projects but it’s mighty hard to top Ghostdini’s debut. It introduced us to the Ghost we’d know and love — a master of soulful introspection, teeth-rattling punchlines and mind-bending storytelling. What really stands out here is that Ghost had no problem sharing his sensitive side, whether fawning over a woman on “Camay” or reminiscing about childhood on “All That I Got Is You.” Sure, he was sentimental but still gritty. It’s an authenticity that’s hard to find in today’s rap.\n\n25. Pete Rock & CL Smooth, Mecca and the Soul Brother (1992)\n\n“TROY (They Reminisce Over You)” is arguably the greatest rap song of the 90s and many argue that Mecca and the Soul Brother is also the best album of the decade. Obviously I don’t QUITE agree with that but will enthusiastically agree that this album is the pinnacle of the Pete Rock/CL Smooth partnership. Pete Rock’s production hits another level here, and CL Smooth is the perfect MC to ride these beats. Mecca and the Soul Brother is a deep, emotional record that sidesteps the usual machismo associated with hip-hop to embrace brotherhood and love in a deeply meaningful way. As hip-hop evolved over the decade, records like this became more and more few and far between. And that just makes this one all the more special.\n\n24. Nas, It Was Written (1996)\n\nNas’ sophomore album is a curious case of revisionist history. When it was released in 1996, many saw it as a disappointment, especially since it proceeded such a monumental piece of work. But with the advent of Hip-Hop Twitter, it has soared to legendary status, with some proclaiming it Nas’ greatest album. Um, no. But don’t misunderstand me, It Was Written is a near-classic in its own right. It became the template for many of Nas’ future releases, using his own life experiences as cautionary tales. They lyrics are so vivid they could be on the big screen. Nas’ best? No way, but it’s amazing.\n\n23. The Notorious B.I.G., Ready to Die (1995)\n\nThis ranking MIGHT feel a little low to some, especially since I loudly proclaim that Christopher Wallace remains the greatest rapper of all time, even 26 years after his death. That’s no slight to this album because while it’s not QUITE as perfect as its rep often claims, it can be summed up with two words: Game changer. Biggie’s semi-biographical debut is kin to a cinematic masterpiece. Biggie’s razor-sharp wit will make you smile, but the bleak realities of his street life will break your heart. When he embraces suicide on the album’s final track, you feel his pain — and you hold your breath hoping for resolution. Ready to Die is an emotional journey the likes hip-hop had never seen. A true classic.\n\n22. Big Pun, Capital Punishment (1998)\n\nA few days ago in the Soul In Stereo Cypher on Facebook, we were debating if Big Pun was actually better than Biggie Smalls. I disagree … but it’s a much closer race than you’d expect. Exhibit A: This album. Big Pun’s rise to prominence wasn’t just big for his native Bronx, it was legitimately history-making — Pun’s debut, Capital Punishment would be the first solo Latin hip hop record to achieve platinum certification. And there were skills to back up those sales — Pun’s tongue-twisting delivery, infectious humor and overwhelming charisma made him an instant star. We lost him far too soon.\n\n21. Jay Z, Vol 2: Hard Knock Life (1998)\n\nLike Nas’ I Am, I’m sure the comments will be loaded with death threats for the placement of this one. Yes, I know it’s a “commercial” Jay Z album, but it’s also the best example of going from street darling to worldwide megastar. If you listen to some Jigga fans, they’d swear he arrived on the scene and immediately became the greatest of all time after one song. They’re wrong because they were probably born in 2008. It wasn’t until this album, Jay’s third solo release, that he became the broccoli-haired mogul we love today. Tinkering with the formula from Vol. 1, Jay expertly reached out to the radio and the streets, captivating both audiences. Some fans deride this album’s mainstream hits but that’s ridiculous. This set contains many of the best songs of the late 90s. It has style AND substance and, for better or worse, influenced a generation of rappers to claw for mainstream success.\n\n20. De La Soul, De La Soul is Dead (1991)\n\nDe La’s beloved second offering is all about evolution. Their heralded debut was known for its lightheartedness but in an attempt to shed the label of “hip-hop hippies,” the follow-up was an edgier showcase of their lyrical prowess. De La Soul was far from dead; this is the album that ensured their name lives on. And now that we’re FINALLY getting their catalog on streaming services (…any day now, I’m told) their legacy will be even stronger.\n\n19. Black Star, Mos Def & Talib Kweli Are Black Star (1998)\n\nMuch like 93 til Infinity, I hadn’t listened to Black Star’s debut in full in probably a good decade until this post and, YEP, it’s still great. And just like Souls of Mischief, who bucked the trend of gangsta rap during their time, five years later Mos Def and Talib Kweli worked to inject a bit more substance in an era inundated with shiny suits and excess. Feeling like A Tribe Called Quest for a new generation, the duo leaned on jazzy production and conscious rhymes to craft the best album of both their careers. Black Star’s individuality made them stand out, but the incredible music makes this one timeless.\n\n18. Gang Starr, Moment of Truth (1998)\n\nHonestly, any of Gang Starr’s 90s albums deserve this spot, but 25 years later and Moment of Truth still seems to rise above the pack. After a bit of a layoff, the duo roared back as mighty as ever, thanks to an influx of jazzy production and Guru’s conversational yet poignant flow. Guru is still greatly missed today but Moment of Truth may stand as he and DJ Premier’s greatest gift to hip-hop.\n\n17. AZ, Doe or Die (1995)\n\nIs this the most underrated album of the 90s? I think so. My friends and I used to jokingly call this album Illmatic 2 back in the 90s — believe me, that’s very lofty praise. Breaking ground as one of the era’s first mafioso-themed releases, Doe or Die takes the gritty coming-of-age tales of Illmatic and drops them into a gangster flick, giving this one a vividly cinematic feel. Its storytelling is compelling and, though it’s not often mentioned today, its influence is unquestionable. Decades later Doe or Die still reigns as one of rap’s greatest debut albums and easily one of the most unsung hip-hop LPs of all time.\n\n16. Ice Cube, AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted (1990)\n\nBefore he was the the friendliest guy in Hollywood, Ice Cube was the most fearsome rapper in the game. After splitting from NWA post Straight Outta Compton, Cube immediately proved he could stand on his own, delivering his own classic right out of the gate. Like in his NWA days, Cube served as hip-hop’s hood reporter, delivering a raw and unfiltered look at Black America on the West Side. But AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted pushed things much further than its predecessor — Cube’s rhymes were more venomous, his concepts more visceral and none of his targets were safe. Cube’s honest brutality would make even the most hardened OGs cringe, but that’s what makes it such a landmark album.\n\n15. The Fugees, The Score (1996)\n\nSee, there is always room for improvement. After a promising but tepid debut, the Refugee Camp kicked in the door with their second album, an almost cinematic effort that is still widely regarded as of one of hip-hop’s most treasured releases. The Score turned potential into promise, resulting in varied, deep production, underrated posse cuts and some of the most recognizable singles in hip-hop history. Wyclef, Pras and Lauryn Hill all rode the momentum of this album to varying degrees of solo success but when these three were united, it was special.\n\n14. DMX, It’s Dark And Hell Is Hot (1998)\n\nIf you weren’t around in 1998, it might be hard to understand the magnitude of this album. While Puffy n’ friends had the rap world shimmying in shiny suits over rehashed soul hits, X kicked in the door with a raw intensity. It’s Dark and Hell Is Hot lived up to its name — a chilling, gritty opus that that depicted X as a troubled sinner seeking salvation by any means necessary. It’s the album responsible for kicking off the Ruff Ryders’ reign of dominance, reshaping the sound of rap in the early 00s and making DMX a megastar. Now that I think about it, we desperately need a DMX in today’s music scene. They’ll never be another one like The Dog.\n\n13. Jay Z, Reasonable Doubt (1996)\n\nI’ll never forget one of my best friends saying back in 96, “I think I need to go get that Jay-Z album. I think it might be pretty good.” Yeah playa, it was pretty good all right. From top to bottom, I can’t find a single fault with this debut album. Every verse is a gem, every ounce of its production is iconic. I rocked this album on the bus during field trips, while playing video games and even while doing chores — Jay’s vivid storytelling was absolutely captivating. Years later, I even wrote a college essay based on “22 Two’s.” And best of all, amongst my friends, this album seemed to be our own little secret. While MTV and BET were obsessed with Jay’s track with Foxy Brown, who seemed set to be the star of the duo, we knew that Jay-Z had so much more to offer — we knew he was destined to rule rap. We were right. And it all started with this album.\n\n12. Ice Cube, Death Certificate (1991)\n\nUnquestionably, Cube’s debut was a commercial juggernaut and a critical masterpiece. But Death Certificate pushed the envelope even further — it’s much more brazen than its predecessor; the harsh truths of urban life cut even deeper. The anger is palatable and its impact is undeniable. America’s fear of the Angry Black Man was on full display here but don’t blame Cube. These are his truths — he’s the monster America made.\n\n11. Lauryn Hill, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)\n\n“NaH bRuH dIs A rNb AlBuM!” I hear you, playa, and I’m ignoring you. In my eyes, Miseducation is just as much hip-hop as it is soul. Our music was never meant to be put in a box. And listening to today’s hip-hop, you can tell just how groundbreaking Lauryn’s solo debut would be. It was far from the first album to incorporate heavy R&B influences (Latifah was singing on records nearly a decade prior, for example) but none to date have done it as well. Credit Lauryn’s incredible lyrical acumen and her willingness to experiment with sounds to create a testament to Black womanhood that is still heralded today. This album IS hip-hop. Too many fans on the outside looking in tend to handcuff Ms. Lauryn’s greatness by claiming she only had ONE album. Um, she had many more than one — including another one on this list. Regardless, when you album is THIS GOOD, one may be enough. It’s the best female-led rap album of the decade, and one of the best of all time.\n\n10. Snopp Dogg, Doggystyle (1993)\n\nFor those of you who were still taking swimming lessons in daddy’s scrotum when this dropped, allow me to set the stage. In 1992, Snoop (Doggy) Dogg established himself as the hottest young rapper in the game, thanks to his appearances on Dr. Dre’s Tha Chronic and the dominance of the G-Funk sound. Expectations were so absurdly high for his debut album that anything less than a classic would be a letdown. What did Snoop do? Deliver a classic. While the content certainly would raise eyebrows today, Snoop’s distinctive flow, knack for storytelling and classic singles elevated Doggystyle to be a centerpiece of 90s hip-hop and still reigns as one of the greatest albums of all time.\n\n9. Outkast, Aquemini (1998)\n\nThere is no album in Outkast’s catalog, and few in rap history, that can stand next to Aquemini. Once again evolving like the dopest Pokemon in the game, Kast’s third album was yet another departure from its predecessors, marryiing Southern hip hop with 60s soul straight out of Stax Records. The result is some of the best tracks to bear the Mighty O’s name. Some may prefer their more commercially successful outings, but Aquemini is the album that made Outkast legendary.\n\n8. The Notorious B.I.G., Life After Death (1997)\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, double albums are always a gamble — in nearly all cases, it’s just too much of a good thing. Thankfully, Biggie defies conventions and single-handledly rewrote the rules of rap with his final album. While gangsta rap had seen commercial success in the past, Life After Death thrust the subgenre into the mainstream for good, paving the way for a decade’s worth of artists. Even its production style marked a change for the genre — instead of sticking with one or two producers for the entire album, this set flaunted a wide array of superproducers, a practice that soon became commonplace. And, of course, BIG’s impeccable delivery was at its zenith here, creating 24 tracks that have been endlessly quoted and sampled since. It’s Bad Boy’s crown jewel — and hip-hop’s greatest double album of all time.\n\n7. Dr. Dre, The Chronic (1992)\n\nI mean, what possibly can be said about one of the most famous rap albums of all time? Dr. Dre’s magnum opus reshaped rap as we knew it, introducing the G-Funk sound that dominated the game, positioned the West Coast as a major player in hip-hop, gave the world Snoop Dogg, among other stars, and cemented Dr. Dre as one of the greatest producers of our generation. Dre may not be the world’s best MC, but he more than holds his own on the mic and knows when to call in backup when it’s really time to go in. The Chronic was a transcendent moment for hip-hop and if we’re just talking notoriety alone, it easily makes the case for №1 on this list.\n\n6. A Tribe Called Quest, The Low End Theory (1991)\n\nMany heads consider Low End not only Tribe’s best album, but one of the greatest in rap history. They’re not wrong about the latter and it’s very difficult to argue the former. Consistency is the name of the game here — I dare you to find an album that flows as seamlessly as Tribe’s sophomore effort. While Tip clearly was the star MC on their debut, Phife really comes into his own here, adding to the poignant reflections on life, relationships and the industry that would make this LP legendary. This album was a moment in rap history and is only surpassed by the slimmest of margins by one other…\n\n5. A Tribe Called Quest, Midnight Marauders (1993)\n\nI’ve always consider Midnight Marauders and The Low End Theory two sides of the same coin. They’re nearly inseparable in my brain. So what makes Midnight Marauders better than The Low End Theory? When it comes down to it, Marauders has a SLIIIIIIIIIGHTLY better selection of singles. That’s it. And even that statement is really picking nits — we’re talking about a nearly equal playing field here. If anything, Marauders should be celebrated for keeping the incredible momentum of the previous album rolling. It’s the culmination of everything that made the previous two album so special — unforgettable bars, legendary tracks, head-turning features and production that is still sampled today. Few artists can claim three back-to-back classics, let alone one album as good as this release.\n\n4. Public Enemy, Fear of a Black Planet (1990)\n\nI know it comes off as hyperbole, but the best way to describe this album is … art. Public Enemy is known for pushing boundaries, but they don’t get enough props for their own evolution — each album improving upon the last. Dialing back the aggression of its predecessor, Fear of a Black Planet is often more laid back with its messages of empowerment. You’re still motivated to conquer the world, you’re just more likely to groove while doing so. Some of the messages don’t always age well when viewed with a 2023 lens but pretty much every theme presented is still relevant today. The revolution may sound a bit different but it hits as hard as ever. A true hip-hop masterpiece.\n\n3. Raekwon, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx (1995)\n\nIf I could adapt one album into a screenplay, this one would be my pick. Seven years before HBO gave us The Wire, Raekwon gave us Cuban Linx, an album that depicted street life with the clarity of a 27-inch Zenith. It also became a showcase for “co-star” Ghostface Killah, who used to platform to launch his own solo career. No other solo Wu album has ever reached these heights. Only Built 4 Cuban Linx is the best rap mafioso album of its era, the greatest solo Wu-Tang effort to date and easily Rae’s greatest work. This is what a classic looks like.\n\n2. Wu-Tang Clan, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) (1993)\n\nThis year we mark 30 years since the Wu’s landmark debut, and it still stands as the measuring stick that all rap ensembles are measured by. 36 Chambers isn’t just the Wu’s calling card, it’s become a hallmark of hip-hop, creating a paradigm shift that ushered in a new era of gritty production and larger-than-life rap personas. From the dusty soul samples to the martial arts motif, the year 1993, rap changed forever — led by the Clan in da front.\n\n1. Nas, Illmatic (1994)\n\nI bet you knew this was №1, and there’s a simple reason for that: it’s the greatest rap album of all time. Before Illmatic, many rap albums were just a random collection of tracks. Sure, those individual songs told powerful stories but Nas took that concept to the next level, using every single song to paint one large picture of inner-city life. It wasn’t just his story, it was our story. That’s why it meant so much. Illmatic changed the way rappers approached their craft. It revolutionized the game.\n\nIllmatic isn’t just the best rap album of the 90s. It’s the best rap album, period."
