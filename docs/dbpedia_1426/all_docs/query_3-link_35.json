        "text": "Massive Attack returned to the U.K. charts in style yesterday (Feb. 16) as its fourth album, “100th Window” (Virgin), became the group’s second to debut at No. 1, repeating the feat of its 1998 predecessor “Mezzanine.” The band reached No. 13 with its influential 1991 debut “Blue Lines” and No. 4 with 1994’s “Protection.”\n\nOn the U.K. singles chart, t.A.T.u.’s “All the Things She Said” (Interscope/Polydor) started a third week at No. 1, and a second on Music & Media’s composite Eurochart Hot 100 Singles tally. The Russian duo withstood the challenge of the latest TV talent show qualifier, Sinead Quinn, whose Mercury debut “I Can’t Break Down” entered at No. 2. On BBC’s “Fame Academy'” series, Quinn lost to David Sneddon, now her Mercury labelmate, who recently hit No. 1 with “Stop Living the Lie.”\n\nAlso new on the singles chart was Appleton — made up of sisters Nicole and Natalie Appleton, former members of All Saints — with its second hit “Don’t Worry” (Polydor) at No. 5. Blazin’ Squad, who topped the U.K. chart last August with “Crossroads,” entered at No. 8 with “Reminisce.”\n\nAnother home-grown urban posse, Epic’s Big Brovaz, saw its “Nu-Flow” album debut at No. 24, while labelmate Kelly Osbourne opened at No. 31 with “Shut Up,” and Zwan at No. 33 with “Mary Star of the Sea” (Reprise).\n\nAcross the whole of Europe, Robbie Williams’ “Escapology” (EMI) tops Music & Media’s European Top 100 Albums chart for a 12th consecutive week."
