What did I do to deserve this?  / Hurt from pain over and over and over again  /  / You know you've got me weaker  / Intoxicated now  / So I'll just keeping playing the games you laid out  / Ooh what about us? I just can't gige you up  / Even though it's hurting baby  / I'll do anything to feel your touch  /  / [Chorus]  /   / Damn How did I let it get this?  / I shouldda never kissed or got intamate wit this chick  / I wish she would see that our affair is over with  / She's telling me her hearts broken she'll never get over it  / My girlfriends like who's that texting is?  / Why you go outside and check your messages?  / I couldn't tell her I was messing this chick  / But she called back and made it obvious  / Screaming this  /  / You know you've got me weaker  / Intoxicated now  / So I'll just keeping playing the games you laid out  / Ooh what about us? I just can't gige you up  / Even though it's hurting baby  / I'll do anything to feel your touch  /  / [Chorus]  /  / Man I felt I put a chick down why did I stray?  / Why did I play? Now what do I say?  / Her names every day on my caller display  / Telling me she all in love and I can't get away  / So I called her begging her to leave me alone  / I said I got a wife and we in the zone  / Right then I could sense a change in her tone  / that's when she started crying all crazy on the phone  / Saying /  / [Chorus]",
