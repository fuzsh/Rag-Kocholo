Meeeeew!\n\nMeeeeew but true. The Mumba really was a bit shite, and Jamelia is ace.\n\nPost by Bootie on\n\nShe is ace yes - but there's no excuse for that level of snottiness.\n\nOne day she will be less ace and be without a contract - and then lets hope she gets it all back in droves\n\nPost by Steveweiser on\n\nI've not liked Jamelia ever since a fan on another board told me that she refused to sign his CDs because she thought he'd sell them on eBay and try to make money off her. This has just confirmed her attitude. She really thinks she's all that, someone should knock her down a peg or two. How I laughed when Peter Andre beat her to #1.\n\nPost by Storm on\n\nI'm not a huge fan of either, but Samantha has far more star quality than Jamelia.\n\nJamelia is completely all hype - she's had a few semi-successful hits, and a modest selling album, and she's being sold to us like she's the saviour of british rnb, when she's actually a bit cack.\n\nWatch her second album go all Big Brovaz - ie, not do too well.......\n\nPost by Molly on\n\nStorm said:\n\nWatch her second album go all Big Brovaz - ie, not do too well.......\n\n*Puts on pedant hat*\n\nThankyou is her second album, Drama was the first.\n\n*Takes off pedant hat*\n\nMumba would have done a much better version of DJ, I think. It would really suit her voice.\n\nPost by AcerBen on\n\nSteveweiser said:\n\nShall we call it Liberty X Syndrome - getting lucky off one big hit, only to see your career piss away afterwards. The same will happen to Jamelia, hopefully.\n\nAbsolutely. And Superstar was a stolen song as well. She isn't particularly impressive live and she needs to ditch the attitude.\n\nHow the bloody hell has she managed to gain such credibility? Is it coz she iz black?\n\nPost by vasilios on\n\nWell, single mother, abusive relationship, cool songs, made it back after some setbacks, record company faith, great legs, award shows showings in Ungaro dresses etc.\n\nAnyone think See it in a boys eyes may have been initially written by C. Martin for Brandy? And maybe she refused/ there was record company stuff and they thought oh well we'll give it to a similar UK act - Jamelia! I think so....\n\nPost by Storm on\n\nMolly said:\n\n*Puts on pedant hat*\n\nThankyou is her second album, Drama was the first.\n\n*Takes off pedant hat*\n\nMumba would have done a much better version of DJ, I think.

The Mumba really was a bit shite, and Jamelia is ace.\n\nSamantha Mumba was great. Never a dud single, a gorgeous voice. Her only flaw was funnily enough the same as Jamelia's - she was an arrogant cow. Jamelia's DJ doesn't sound very good at all, her voice doesn't suit it. But she did do a very good live performance of Stop on The Frank Skinner Show.\n\nAs for Jamelia, she really has to stop being so nasty about other artists. Yes it's always fun and refreshing for smeone in pop to speak their minds (hello Daphne & Celeste), but she's just a plain bitch. That Radio 1 interviewer should have followed up the DJ question with ''and also Superstar was somebody else's song first wasn't it Jamelia?, You nicked that one too''?\n\nPost by Jon on\n\nscandipop said:\n\nJamelia's DJ doesn't sound very good at all, her voice doesn't suit it.\n\nTruth be told, I agree with you here - I think DJ is the weakest single she's ever released. But that wasn't the point I was making, which was that she is better than Samantha Mumba.\n\nAnd she was fabulous on Skinner, wasn't she?\n\nPost by LiveMusicFan on\n\nWhat is it about \"Superstar\" that made it such a hit? I have never liked it, it's a distinctly average song. I much prefer Thank You or See It In A Boy's Eyes.\n\nAnd yes, she needs to get off that very high horse and learn a bit of humility.\n\nPost by Mushroom on\n\nI never know what to believe. I read all these things about Jamelia saying these nasty things, but then when I do see her on an interview she seems really nice.\n\nI didn't like her album though, it was all filler. Samantha Mumba though, she was fantastic. I still say Don't Want You Back was a Girls Aloud tribute to Mumba.\n\nPost by vasilios on\n\n\"Samantha Mumba though, she was fantastic. I still say Don't Want You Back was a Girls Aloud tribute to Mumba.[/quote]\n\nMushroom are you secretly ME?\n\nMy thought exactly - when I heard Don't want you back I was like \" Mumbatastic!\" I love that track!!!\n\nPost by vasilios on\n\nBooers said:\n\nI noticed her name went from Jamelia to Jamelis in the subject title of this - is that a sly reference to her & Kelis being the same person?\n\nNo I wrote it Jamelis in a hurry (& prob because I was angry he he) and then edited it. I thought the Kelis thing, too.\n\nPost by Jen on\n\nI've been saying this for bloody ages! (As a clairvoyant I knew some time ago that her bitchiness would continue and that more people would notice) She's arrogant and not a quater as good as she thinks she is. She is mostly hype -there are far better uk hip hop and r&b acts, who may not have as much commercial success, but are doing far more musically. Regardless- she's not very bloody r&b anyway! Her first single of the album \"bout\" -despite being rather good- did bugger all and its only when she got Superstar that she hit big, and I'm sorry but superstar is a pop song. I also think that Thank You was rubbish. I really dislike her- and her version of \"Stop\" has nothing on Sam Brown. And she doesn't have the breasts to be wearing those dresses.\n\n*rant over*\n\nPost by Pandarama on\n\nWow, the bandwagon on this board gets rolling really quickly, doesn't it?\n\nI have to say I'm surprised at a lot of you. How exactly does wishing a brick would fall on Jamelia's head make you any less of a spiteful sod than she [allegedly] is?\n\nFor what it's worth, I don't think Jamelia is overrated, or a bitch. Several people I work with have met her on various occasions, and not one of them has a bad word to say about her. And when I saw her live a few months ago, she oozed stage presence from every pore and had the crowd in the palm of her hand. Obviously I just have very low standards.\n\nPost by flufff on\n\nI'm not jumping on the band-wagon. I spotted her bitchiness months ago and said so. She can be a bit hit and miss, and sometimes can come across as lovely and affable, but that makes it worse for me. She has the social skills to be friendly and jolly when it suits her, but does the diva thing when the people involved are not important enough.\n\nI do think she's good as a popstar, and even though I hate her version of Stop I know she's a pretty decent singer. But she's only pretty decent and not outstanding and even if she was outstanding I wouldn't think her attitude was acceptable. Being over-rated isn't her fault and only a sign of her publicity machine working hard and the public being stupid.\n\nAs well as the evidence from interview after interview I've heard stories about her with fans, or from PAs where she's turned up late and made it obvious she didn't want to be there. One of my pet hates are popstars/singers who disrespect their audience like that. If you agree to a gig, do it with grace.\n\nPost by jester1436 on\n\nWhat is the reason Mumba doesn't have a contract and Jamelia does, considering the fact every single Mumba dropped went top 10 and one actually made the top 10 here in the States. Jamelia's chart career is erratic and riddled with abysmal records. Didn't she do a song with Blazin' Squad? That's just wrong.\n\nI want a new Samantha Mumba album now. I also want Jamelia placed in a gigantic rocket aimed towards the sun.\n\nPost by scandipop on\n\nPandarama said:\n\nAnd when I saw her live a few months ago, she oozed stage presence from every pore and had the crowd in the palm of her hand. Obviously I just have very low standards.\n\nBut Panda, aside from Jen, nobody was really disputing her talent. Just her arrogance. Ok you may know people who have met her and seen otherwise, but it's been fairly well documented that she can talk down other singers with ease. And although she is talented, she really has no place to say who should and shouldn't have a recording contract. Samantha Mumba may be almost forgotten these days, but in her day she proved very popular and had a flawless chart run. Who is Jamelia to say that there is a reason why she does and Sam doesn't have a career in music. If she's going to make comments like that then she should be prepared for Joe Public to think that she's an arrogant cow."
