        "text": "Welcome to PJ00s 25: Black Clouds & Silver Lines edition\n\nHello everyone, and welcome to PJ00s 25!\n\nFor this round, you will be looked after by myself and @Untouchable Ace\n\nThese are the​\n\nmust have been first released between 01.01.2000-12.31.2009​\n\nno UK top 20 hits​\n\nno US top 20 hits​\n\nno tracks from a US or UK top 10 album​\n\nno covers or prominent samples of famous songs​\n\nno relatively famous/chart-successful cover versions of your desired entry (if it's the original version) recorded by a different act​\n\nno songs (or covers of songs) that have competed in the Eurovision Song Contest (semi-finals or finals)​\n\nrelatively unknown/underrated on Popjustice - so as a general benchmark, nothing from an artist with more than 10 pages of discussion on PJ (across all their artist threads)​\n\nno entry that has been previously entered in a previous round of PJ00s (list of past entries here), PJSC (list of past entries here), or PJOPS (list of entries here; the '00s crossover round list can be found here). Additionally, no entry that has been previously vetoed in PJ00s (in general, these acts will most likely be vetoed again, unless the reason for the veto was that the song was previously entered in a different song contest).​\n\nA list of previously vetoed entries is here.\n\nRepeat artists guideline:\n\n- the same act (in any form - solo, group, featured, etc.) cannot be entered for FOUR rounds since their last appearance (i.e., a non-winning round 8 act can be reentered no sooner than round 13, and in round 9, non-winning acts from rounds 1-4 are generally eligible again)\n\n- for the winner of each round, that artist cannot be entered again (in any form - solo, group, featured) for the subsequent TEN rounds.\n\n​\n\nBut wait that's not all!\n\nFor this milestone round, we will be relaxing one of the rules juuuust a little bit in celebration; simply put - we're going to allow songs that hit the Top 20!\n\nSo that means any song that charted on the UK or US main charts from #11 onwards is eligible.\n\nBut wait, there's more!\n\n25 traditionally represents a silver anniversary, so we're going to play with that a little bit.\n\nFor this round, you will need to pick two songs, for two rounds;\n\nBlack Clouds & Silver Lines\n\nFor the \"Black Clouds\" round, you will need to choose a song that walks a darker line (Lyrics, production etc.), and for the \"Silver Lines\" round; think positivity!\n\n(If you so wish, both songs can come from the same artist.)\n\nThis means that by the end of this round, we will have one main winner; and the side winner can take on the role of co-host next round.\n\nSo, in summary: you must submit a sad song and a happy song; They must have hit no higher on the UK and US main charts than number 11 and were released within the usual parameters of PJ00s.\n\nSubmit your songs of choice to both myself & @Untouchable Ace - just be sure to let us know which song will be representing which section and which you would like to represent you in the main contest.\n\nYou have until the April 26 to submit.\n\nVoting will conclude May 15\n\nWill a dark cloud cast a shadow on the final result, or will silver linings prevail?\n\nGood luck!\n\nMain Entries\n\nBeingNormal - ALB - Daveg\n\nHurricane Drunk - Belinda - End Of The Day\n\niheartpoptarts - Boom! - Falling\n\nCorgiCorgiCorgi - Chungking - Love Is Here To Stay\n\nrawkey - CSS - Music Is My Hot Hot Sex\n\nJeffo - The Faders - No Sleep Tonight\n\nDoodvid - Girls@Play - Airhead\n\nWoW73 - Kurtis Mantronik ft.
