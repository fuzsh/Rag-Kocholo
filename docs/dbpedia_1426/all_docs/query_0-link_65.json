        "text": "Mark Watson and Jo Caulfield return for this one. A lot of the games in here have lengthened versions in the Too Hot reels, but we’re gonna judge this as is.\n\nHeadliners: C.S.I.P.\n\nFrankie: “is it his favorite TV show, CSI: Portsmouth?”\n\nAnd we’re off\n\nFrankie: “every week, it’s the same story, a guy getting kicked to death by sailors…”\n\nThe edit is trying desperately to hide that Frankie really said ‘gay guy’\n\nHugh: “is it Cameron’s Strangely Invisible Policies?”\n\n[modest laughs]\n\nHugh: “…he said, satirically!”\n\nAndy: “is it Conceited, Shallow, Inbred Prat”\n\nLOUDER RESPONSE\n\nDara: “…see in a sense, he ALSO did something about the news, but he called him a prat at the end…”\n\nI like the competition to get the right answer, with Andy and Hugh saying ‘Cameron Slips in Polls’, and Mark thinking the C is conservatives…only for Dara to reveal that the S was ‘SLIDE’\n\nHugh: “I’m off, then…”\n\nDara, referring to the ‘Brown bounce’ leaning towards labour: “who hear finds the phrase ‘Brown bounce’ slightly distasteful?”\n\nHugh raises his hand\n\nDara: “as if it’s something you’d achieve by stretching clingfilm over the toilet…as a sort of army prank…”\n\nFrankie: “[Brown] said he wanted all buildings to fly the Union Jack as a message to terrorists…a message that says ‘these buildings are worth bombing!”\n\nI think Jo saw that punchline coming, and started laughing partway through\n\nMark clearly recognizes Putin for a question: “the facts I can do, it’s just some of the humor that doesn’t go as well..”\n\nDara and Mark do the Ian Hislop ‘ALLEGEDLY’ game when talking about Alexander Litvinenko’s radiation poisoning, saying that there’s no proof that Putin did it.\n\nHugh: “why would [Britain] want him? He’s radioactive!”\n\nFrankie: “Say what you will about Litvinenko, he was a master of disguise. One minute he was a sort of 48-year old man, the next a VERY OLD, WITHERED MAN.”\n\nJesus. A great joke, but Jesus.\n\nAndy has the obvious joke about the tea poisoning: “oh, that got the british people FURIOUS. THAT IS NO WAY TO TREAT A CUP OF TEA.” But he tells it very well.\n\nDara: “which other tory was in the news this week?”\n\nHugh, smirking: “are you suggesting Vladimir Putin is a Tory?”\n\nDara: “I’m afraid…well, he’s QUITE CONSERVATIVE, you have to admit…”\n\nWelp. 5 Series and 2 shows into Mock the Week and we finally arrive at our first mention of Boris Johnson. The first of many.\n\nThe humor here, a lot like early response to Trump running, is very much ‘it’d be great if he won mayorship, cause it’d be hysterical’. Frankie and Russell contribute to this. And yes, a joke candidate is all well and good until he actually wins.\n\nFrankie: “he’s about the sort of guy who 200 years earlier would have died at age 30 leading a calvary charge into a volcano.”\n\nTHERE’S AN EVERGREEN BORIS JOKE\n\nDara, with an even better one: “SURELY syphillis woulda got him first…”\n\nAndy talks about Boris’ tour of places he’d slagged off, and saying he should go to New Guinea to apologize for calling them cannibals only for them to eat him\n\nRussell enhances the joke though: “How funny would it have been if he was on the flight and somebody just put steak seasoning on him while he was sleeping? Like, there you go, Papua New Guinea, let’s test the theory, shall we?”\n\nHugh: “D’you hear that the reply from the people of New Guinea wasn’t ‘how dare you’, it was ‘how dare you, that hasn’t happened for OVER 40 YEARS…”\n\nPFFFF. The truth just sounds funny when stated by Hugh\n\nDara: “which other blue-blooded political figure made the news this week?”\n\nRussell: “there’s a smurf, who’s on the loose…”\n\n…nearly an elf\n\nI do like Jo talking about the Queen, and how she’s capable of sarcasm, and how you can’t unhear it. “Every time she says something like ‘oh, you’re going to entertain me with native dance…how THRILLING…”\n\nDara: “why was last Sunday special?”\n\nRussell, who’s having a lot of nice goofs this way: “well, I had a nice barbecue…”\n\nMark, similarly: “well, every Sunday’s special cause of, eh, the Lord.”\n\nThere was some nice stuff in this round, but a lot of the later topics petered out. The stuff about Cameron, Putin and Boris really worked, though.\n\nBetween the Lines: Hugh translates for Frankie, as David Beckham\n\nFrankie: “I’m glad to have this opportunity to let you know what I’m thinking.”\n\nHugh:\n\nFrankie: “It’s great to have left Real Madrid.”\n\nHugh:\n\nHugh, eventually: “…I hate Poland.”\n\nFrankie: “I bought a house in LA, right by the Hollywood sign”\n\nHugh: “…I’d love to know what it says”\n\nThese are easy jokes, but done well by Hugh due to just how he’s playing it.\n\nFrankie: “Brooklyn has settled in well at an American school.”\n\nHugh: “….he shot someone.”\n\nNOW we’re off the dumb jokes\n\nFrankie: “my wife knows how much I love her.”\n\nHugh: “…I sent her a text by mistake.”\n\nI feel like he’d use that for a future David Cameron round\n\nFrankie: “I was surprised to learn that I was wanted by Scientology”\n\nHugh, of course: “I didn’t know they had a team…”\n\nAnd the triumph for Hugh:\n\nFrankie: “Tom Cruise’s wife Katie keeps convincing us to hire more staff”\n\nHugh, chuckling: “she keeps sending us notes saying ‘GET HELP.”\n\nPERFECT\n\nHonestly, one of the best Between the Lines playings they ever did. Strong all the way through, not just dumb jokes, and with some of Hugh’s cleverest jabs.\n\nStand Up Round: Mark, Jo, Andy and Frankie\n\nThe shot on the stand-up performer is very tight this episode, as opposed to giving them a bit more room to breathe in past incarnations. Maybe a sign of a new camera director?\n\nMark, on identity theft, talks about being turned away by the passport agency because ‘your face is too big’. “MY FACE IS NORMAL. I have a beaky nose, but I can’t stab someone with that…”\n\nA very fun, energetic set from Mark overall. Maybe not as line-for-line impressive as his earlier ones, but still great\n\nJo, on terror threat, attacks the ’72 virgins’ fever dream. “You know who else is a virgin? My auntie Joyce. She’s 67 and lives with 17 cats.”\n\nAnd she draws this out, as THAT’s who they get. “When you’re done with me, you’ll have to have 71 of me friends. You’ll have to do Bridget from behind, she walks with a zimmer frame…”\n\nA really nice set from Jo\n\nAndy’s is very simple, honestly too simple, and it seems truncated as well.\n\nFrankie, on celebrity culture: “Apparently Catherine Zeta Jones, she lives in LA but she has air imported from Wales. When I want my house to smell like Wales, I just kick my dog and wait til he farts…”\n\nOpposite of last show- Frankie and Andy’s sets were the least reliable, and Jo and Mark had the most to say. Still kinda blah.\n\nIf This is the Answer: Sport; 250,000\n\nJo: “is that the number of Iceland dinners the robbers took from Kerry Katona’s house?”\n\nDING DING DING DING. WE’VE REACHED THE FIRST KERRY KATONA JOKE IN MTW HISTORY. AND SOMEHOW IT’S NOT FROM FRANKIE.\n\nDara: “d’you think there was a point where they came in, ‘DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING OTHER THAN DRUMSTICKS???”\n\nFrankie: “is it how many calories in a scottish salad?”\n\nAndy: “is it, if you phone up British Telecom, which position in the queue are you likely to be?”\n\nHugh: “he’s wearing that the wrong way round…”\n\nDara: “he is, that’s…that’s the first thing…”\n\nFrankie, on Victoria: “I mean, she looks like she has a dump every four years…that’s how Beckham can tell there’s a world cup coming up…”\n\nWe get an update of Hugh’s tour de France trek, which occurred the day before taping.\n\n…just…a great shot\n\nHugh talks, pridefully about when he “overtook a French cyclist that had one leg”\n\nDara: “were you there just going ‘I’LL TAKE HIM! SOON MY MOMENT WILL BE HERE.”\n\nHugh also tells the story about a piss break he had with 2 other riders, and “apparently my mate turned to me and said ‘the guy next to us had the most enormous cock I had ever seen.’…and that kept us going for another 15…”\n\nRussell even reveals that his own dad did a leg of the tour de France as well. “He actually had a piss next to your mate.”\n\nHA\n\nDara brings up the meeting between the world’s tallest man and the world’s shortest man:\n\nDara clarifies that this man is ‘APPLYING to be the world’s shortest man, THERE ARE A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS…it’s like the Apprentice.”\n\nHugh: “it does look like he’s thinking ‘has anybody got 2 slices of bread?”\n\nPFFFFF\n\nRussell: “before this, he had been living in a cave…”\n\nJo: “a HUGE CAVE…”\n\nRussell, slyly: “yeah, a massive cave, his legs were sticking out…”\n\nHe’s been so good this show, just by sliding in those excellent jokes when you don’t expect them\n\nFrankie, on his 5’6 girlfriend: “I like the thought that, when he went down on one knee, it’ll have been the first time she’ll have seen his face…and it’s a real fairytale romance, isn’t it? A beautiful woman being stolen away by an evil giant…”\n\nThis is the stuff I love. Just goofy stuff off the news.\n\nA good round that got better towards the end, when we went away from paltry current events and onto stuff like Hugh’s tour de France adventure and the really tall guy. That was where I got the best laughs.\n\nScenes We’d Like to See\n\nThis round was an early Youtube round for me\n\nAlso, the closely cropped camera angle from the stand-up round also applies here.\n\n“The worst thing to hear over a tannoy”\n\nHugh, iconically: “….ONLY YOU CAN HEAR ME.”\n\nI love that we’re STARTING with bizarre…\n\nHugh: ‘second floor…but YOU can’t get out…”\n\nI love this runner. Just…Hugh being joyfully sinister.\n\nMark does one that directly calls back to a sad childhood memory he brought up in If This is the Answer [“Mark’ll probably get stuck in a sack, har-bloody-har”]. He really is a proto-James Acaster\n\nRussell, high pitched voice: “CAN SOMEBODY COME TO THE SALAMI SLICER PLEASE???”\n\nI love that one. In the Too Hot reel it comes after several more elaborate, longer ones, so that disparity always cracks me up\n\nMark: “ladies and gentlemen, we all know there’ll be a bomb on the tube, BUT WILL IT BE TODAY?”\n\nMark’s having a nice show too\n\nJo: “would the parents of the child that fell into the tiger enclosure, please come to lost property to collect her shoes.”\n\noh LORD.\n\n“Unlikely Lines from the Final Harry Potter book”\n\nFrankie: “Harry had always thought that he would meet his end at the hands of Voldemort, so imagine his surprise when the doctors told him that he was HIV positive.”\n\nAnd we’re off\n\nYou can hear Russell, remembering a similar joke in last week’s newsreader round, mutter “EVERY WEEK…”\n\nHugh, with a classic MTW setup-delivery: “Get the snitch, said Harry…I’ll tie him down, you break his kneecaps”\n\nFrankie, with my favorite of the round: “as the old man stood in front of him in his robes clutching his wand, Harry regretted transferring to Catholic school”\n\nHugh: “I’m sorry, Harry, I’m having a baby, and it’s yours’….said Professor McGonagall..”\n\nPFFFFF\n\nMark, again aided by his delivery: “then Harry said something, Hermione said something, ah who cares, I’M MINTED!”\n\nA much stronger SWLTS, with a lot of iconic lines, and even a few I know are there in the Too Hot reel.\n\nOverall: Much better show. Still not perfect, with lulls in the conversation rounds and some trouble in stand-up, but we had some really funny stuff here, and some great panel dynamic. This was a great Russell episode, as his cheeky moods outdid Frankie’s usual steamrolling. This was also a better episode for guests, as Mark and Jo both did really well here, with more emphasis on Mark, who’s been on more to this point. It felt more in line with the best of last series, and there was a great deal to like, even if we’re not quite at pristine levels yet. Definitely a step in the right direction.\n\nBest Regular: Russell Howard had a phenomenal show, and made a case that he deserved his promotion to regular.\n\nBest Guest: Mark Watson’s goofs really got to me this show.\n\nWorst Performer: Honestly, Andy was both quieter, and less successful, this show.\n\nBest Round: Scenes we’d Like to See, edging out Between the Lines for more iconic moments [Hugh’s sinister tannoy, a lot of the Harry Potter round]\n\nBest Topic: Tallest Man\n\nBest Runner: Mark’s sack incident\n\nCOMING UP NEXT: A crafty booking, a few classic rounds, and a lot of Harry Potter stuff.\n\nStarting with the mid-2007 series, Series 5, Mock the Week would begin the trend of having extended series’, with 12 episodes instead of 5 or 6, to capitalize on the increase in popularity. From here, the rep company would strengthen and grow, the regulars would improve, and the episodes themselves would broaden in quality.\n\nWith the first episode of Series 5, though…Dan & Mark made some decisions that I would not have made. One was comparatively fixable, the other…less so.\n\nSo with Russell officially ironed down as the fourth regular, and with only 2 revolving seats for the foreseeable future, the producers began thinking about performers that not only would mesh well with the regulars, but would contrast with them. Measuring dynamics accordingly. While also keeping an eye on acts that the BBC had applicable. This bit sort of explains the presence of Jan Ravens, who I’ve covered on Whose Line and QI and have enjoyed neither time, who is here for her first and only MTW appearance.\n\nBut…the other guy…oh god, I’ve gotta be careful, cause people like him.\n\nMichael McIntyre is…a popular comedian. To me, there are two types of comedians: popular comedians and funny comedians. If you can be both, it’s rare. For any US readers, I’ll use acceptable examples- Kevin Hart is a popular comedian. Gabriel Iglesias is a popular comedian. These are people the majority of the country has heard of, and who sells out gigs everywhere they go, as a name, regardless of set specificity. I’d put Seinfeld into that category now, or even Dave Chappelle [even though right now I really wish he’d switch up his set content], or…honestly Bill Burr as well. John Mulaney is a popular comedian who is also very funny, and was in danger of becoming solely a popular comedian when the crisis happened. I think this will bring him back to earth.\n\nNow, in terms of UK comics, it’s a bit more difficult to classify, as most popular comedians over there are pretty funny. Jimmy Carr, Frank Skinner, Eddie Izzard, Russell Howard, yeah, I like all of ’em. They’re all really funny. And then you get ones that are made to crowdplease. James Corden is the biggest one of these, he is entirely unfunny, but he’s insanely popular. Peter Kay falls into this category. Katherine Ryan NOW falls into this category. And…as he always has, Michael McIntyre. He sells out arenas. He’s smiley and charismatic and tells jokes, and people laugh. Whether or not the jokes are funny is besides the point. He is, after all, a popular comedian. He doesn’t NEED to be funny.\n\nSo even if these MTW appearances happen before he becomes completely popular, he’s honing that personality, and he’s clearly not as funny as the rest. And I’ve always had an issue with him on the show. How do you have Michael McIntyre, who’s entirely safe and palatable, on a panel with Frankie Boyle? In these shows, you can see Frankie biting his lip whenever Michael gets an easy laugh line.\n\nFor any Americans not familiar with McIntyre otherwise, he’s hosted comedy shows in the UK for the last decade and a half, was a judge on Britain’s Got Talent in 2011 [the Hasselhoff season], and is now the host of the ever-popular new game show The Wheel…which, I just learned, is coming stateside to NBC next year…along with McIntyre himself.\n\nSo, if you haven’t experienced Michael McIntyre, get ready. You’re about to, whether you like it or not.\n\nEnough chatter. Let’s dive right into the much larger S5, featuring Jan Ravens and Michael McIntyre. I sincerely hope this ends up being somewhat good.\n\nDara begins the show from his desk for the first time. The opening standup section is dead, we get right to the action.\n\nHeadliners: G.B.T.C.\n\nThis one has a much better Too Hot compilation edit\n\nJan: “or is it Grumpy Bunny Takes Control?”\n\nRussell, cutting off Michael: “that’s a SEX TOY-sorry…”\n\n…you’re quite right.\n\nRussell does a demonstration of this, too\n\nDara: “doesn’t vibrate as much as a SHRUG…”\n\nFor someone who’d notoriously have much trouble with this round, Michael actually has a very funny one here: “is it Gordon’s Butler…THE CLAW?”\n\n…wait, did I just give Michael McIntyre a compliment on this show? OH NOOOO\n\nFrankie: “Gordon Brown: Termite Cathedral? His body has been used as a place of worship by britain’s termite community…”\n\nWhich is a great bizarre gag\n\nFrankie: “…is it that?”\n\nPFFFFF. I love how they try and play along\n\nDara: “HANG ON, NO, LEMME CHECK…”\n\nHugh gets the answer pretty quickly. I am truly missing some banter about tickling fucking chickens, but hey, that’s what the reels are for.\n\nFrankie: “d’you imagine what the party was like when Brown took over? Dry crackers all around…a video of outtakes from Songs of Praise..’THIS ISN’T PSALM 53, HOHOHO…”\n\nFrankie: “I think they should do what they did with boring cartoon characters and give him a little sidekick, like a disco dancing raccoon maybe…’WHAT’S THAT, CHIPPY? YOU WANT ME TO PUT VAT ON CHILDREN’S CLOTHING?”\n\n…Frankie’s already on a roll, and the season’s just begun\n\nAndy talks about Brown being blind in one eye. “He should wear a little patch. Nobody would muck with Britain then, would they?”\n\n…there’s a Blunkett joke in here somewhere..\n\nAndy: “if we were run by a PIRATE…”\n\nMichael: “does that mean there were meetings with Blair, Brown and Blunkett, and only 3 good eyes in that room?”\n\n…ANOTHER GOOD JOKE FROM MICHAEL? What’s going on???\n\nMichael: “Blair could have run out and run in in the blind spot while they were chatting…”\n\nHugh: “the other thing about that cabinet is that Jack Straw has tinnitus, so he can’t HEAR anything…”\n\nFrankie: “IT’S LIKE THE WIZARD OF OZ OR SOMETHING…”\n\nMichael talks about the inept terror attacks by phone, trying to figure out how that worked: “Are they panicky wrong numbers? Like, if you’re trying to phone someone, and go ‘is Derek there?’ and like “…NO, THIS IS DETONATOR. NEVER PHONE HERE.”\n\nPFFFFF. Why the hell is he working so far for me? I mean, he does belabor the point sometimes, but…the laughs are coming!\n\nDara describes the guy “in flames shouting ‘Allah is good'”\n\nFrankie: “you say that’s what it was, but he was in flames! He could have just been shouting “AAAAAAIIIGHHH!”\n\nThat got me. Jesus\n\nFrankie: “I read that he now has his mobile phone melted into his body…though, on the bright side, he is much easier to get a hold of. They should change his ringtone to Disco Inferno”\n\nFrankie is dominating this section. Jan has had some that haven’t worked, Hugh and Michael have come in for good lines, and Russell’s been very quiet, but Frankie is, as usual, killing it\n\nI love how Dara sets up this ‘NHS REVOLVING DOOR OF TERROR’ headline. “Which, at first glance, you’re going ‘well they should just wedge that shut. As opposed to having people go around with saline drips going ‘WHERE DOES THE DOOR STOP?”\n\nI also love Frankie calling out Dara’s use of the phrase ‘get to the opening’ in describing revolving door follies.\n\nRussell, on Alistair Campbell’s diaries: “It’d be great if he’d done it in the style of Alan Bennett. “Tony came in and told me we were going ta war…oh no, thought I, and went out ta buy vegetabulls…”\n\nThen, as they discuss the revelation that “Brown got stuck in the toilet”, Dara has to specify: “in the BATHROOM, not in the toilet!”\n\n…Dara being a goof is a major plus to this show. Always will be.\n\nRussell: “he really likes that bit from Trainspotting…”\n\nA alright opening round. Some good energy, especially from Frankie, but a lot of topics that didn’t always produce the funniest and most relevant stuff.\n\nStand Up Round: Andy, Michael, Russell and Frankie\n\nAndy, on travel: “In America they fingerprint you, but only two of your fingers. So, provided that you used the other eight fingers to commit a crime, you should be absolutely fine.”\n\nAndy makes an easy joke about the succession of Bushes and Clintons: “Say what you will about Britain, but I think we’re unlikely to elect Mark Thatcher…”\n\nThere’s a loud cry from an audience member. We include this shot:\n\nAndy: “…or Norma Major”\n\nKind of a basic set for Andy\n\nMichael’s is…kind of new for MTW, sort of a pull from his repertoire, just about relationships. We’re moving away from topics that may be newsworthy and going towards topics that help out comedians. And so Michael tells a very easy joke about wanting to bang his wife’s sister. This gets laughs.\n\nDara, making fun of the behind screen photo of a doctor’s exam and a nurse checking a man’s knee: “men’s health…REPRESENTED BY A KNEE. A window into a man’s soul, the knee…”\n\nRussell: “3 times in my life I’ve been convinced i’d had testicular cancer, all 3 times it’s been an ingrown hair”\n\n[audience laughter]\n\nRussell: “…yeah, funny.”\n\nThis is why I love Russell. He works off a crowd so well!\n\nRussell even plays off a testicle mime that’s too wide: “no, they’re not THAT big. ‘yes, you appear to have a problem, Mr. Howard, you appear to have camel’s gonads.”\n\nRussell, on the testicle exam: “I wish I’d been courageous enough to go like:\n\nTHAT is a great set. Quick, funny, relevant, purely in Russell’s wheelhouse without feeling pandered to.\n\nFrankie, on sport: “They say that the British olympics is gonna rekindle british nationalism. I mean, for 9.6 billion, you could have written FUCK OFF GERMANY onto the moon…”\n\nFrankie: “Scotland’s getting in on it too, Glasgow’s auditioned for the Commonwealth Games. It’d be great to see a sporting event where the CROWD fail a drugs test…”\n\nHe’s just…this good this show.\n\nSecond two sets better than the first two, levels to a so-so round altogether.\n\nNewsreel: Jan is Queen Elisabeth, Hugh is all else\n\nHugh, as a Frenchman: “maybe if I hide behind this door she will never see me”\n\nJan, as the Queen emerges from behind the door: “OH!”\n\nHugh: “bollocks.”\n\nAnd it’s the dead way he says this that makes it work.\n\nJan, on a player the Queen is meeting: “why has he got his hand on his hate-me like that?” [or some other euphemism for a crotch]\n\nHugh: “He’s expecting a free kick of some sort..”\n\nJan, meeting teammates from Brazil: “I like a Brazilian…Philip prefers a welcome mat, but…”\n\n……..disgusting, but very good.\n\nHugh: “This is Yann, he is German, like you”\n\nJan: “yes, yes, we don’t talk about that.”\n\nPFFF\n\nThe second half is the Queen trying to price something that ends up being worth only a few quid. The highlight here is Hugh, as the mediator, going, in a cockney accent, “DON’T TALK TO THA QUEEN LOIKE THAT.”\n\nHugh: “people like you, where I come from…”\n\n[makes a circular motion with his finger]\n\nHugh: “…WE ROUNDED ZEM UP.”\n\nHE’S THAT GOOD.\n\nBetter Newsreel than I would have thought. The first half was better than the second, but Jan had some good lines, though Hugh took the heavy lifting.\n\nIf This is the Answer: Environment; Over 31,000 Tons\n\nAndy: “is it, if you sell fertilizer, what size order should make you suspicious?”\n\nFrankie: “if that bomb had gone off, how much cellulite would have been scattered throughout central Scotland?”\n\nThat got me. In fact, I’m just gonna do the Best Regular bit now.\n\nI love the little cut to Jan turning and wincing. Now we know why she only did one of these.\n\nHugh: “How much weight has Charlotte Church put on in pregnancy.”\n\nHORRIFIED REACTION.\n\nFrankie: “when Tony Blair was asked how many Iraquis he killed-”\n\n[SHARP ANDY CACKLING]\n\nFrankie: “…what was his callous reply?”\n\nBIG AUDIENCE RESPONSE.\n\nIt’s about the carbon footprint of Live 8, and how the artists flying in was bad for the environment.\n\nFrankie: “STING FLEW IN…AND TOLD ME TO STOP REFILLING MY KETTLE…”\n\nRussell, similarly: ‘the worst is Madonna telling you to lower your carbon footprint. You’re like ‘well stop flying over to buy your children…”\n\nFrankie: “I’m quite optimistic about the environment honestly. I think that just at the moment Britain bursts into flames, it’s gonna be hit by a tidal wave..”\n\nMichael’s ‘when records began’ bit seems like a copy of an Eddie Izzard routine\n\nAndy talks about someone who tried to rob a bank wearing a tree-branch. “He’d dressed up as a ent, effectively…”\n\nJan: “It was all those drama classes. ‘BE A TREE, BE A TREE!”\n\nDara: “be a tree…who wants to rob a bank!”\n\nFrankie: “was the idea that he’d get out of there, stand still by the roadside, and nobody’s find him til autumn?”\n\nDara: “WHERE’S HE GONE??”\n\n[maniacal laughter] “THEY’LL NEVER FIND ME HERE.’ And then a bird comes along and pecks him. “NOOOOO”\n\nAndy: “you know how they dress up as American presidents, you know, the mask. Maybe someone suggested that he dress up as Bush and he completely misunderstood”\n\nTHAT IS A GREAT JOKE\n\nHere we introduce that Hugh will be cycling A STAGE of the tour de France.\n\nDara: “the day before you’re supposed to come in [to record]”\n\nHugh: “an AMATEUR stage of the tour de France, but I’m not cycling with the 120,000 good cyclists, I’m cycling with 6,000 Frenchmen…”\n\nAndy: “when you say ‘amateur stage’, have you got stabilizers on either side?”\n\nMichael: “where is it?”\n\n-_-\n\nHugh, responding like a pro: “well, it’s in FRANCE, STRANGELY ENOUGH…”\n\nMichael: “Why aren’t they in France now? How do they get to France?”\n\nRussell: “CYCLING, MICHAEL!”\n\nALREADY they’re turning on him. This is fantastic\n\nBetter than the opening round. Shorter, but more consistent, and with more sharp jokes. Funnier topics too, like the tree robbery.\n\nScenes We’d Like to See\n\n“Unlikely Things to Hear at Wimbledon”\n\nFrankie: “a dog has run onto the court…and it’s beaten Tim Henman!”\n\nPFF\n\nHugh: “well, in a way, this rain could be God’s judgment on how shit we are at tennis.”\n\nAlmost classic-seeming line here\n\nFrankie, predicting the future: “AS THE SCOTTISH MAN HOLDS THE WIMBLEDON TROPHY ALOFT…THE EARTH OPENS AND SWALLOWS HIM WHOLE”\n\n“What a Newsreader Would Never Say”\n\nFrankie, iconically: “the football scores now, so you might want to look away….if you’re a woman or a gay.”\n\nFrankie: “press the red button now to activate the vibrating donut I’ve hidden inside my trousers.”\n\nBUZZ\n\nFrankie: “PLEEEEEEASE.”\n\nPFFFFF\n\nFrankie: “If you’ve taped that earthquake to enjoy later, and don’t want to know how many died, look away now!”\n\nIt may seem like I’m just doing Frankie’s, but Jan and Michael aren’t doing any funny ones, Andy’s barely going up, and Russell’s aren’t working for me either. Michael even reprises his Wimbledon round joke in the newsreader one for a callback. It…doesn’t work.\n\nHugh: “well, time for your own regional news now, I’m off for a dump, see you in 10.”\n\nKinda thin, honestly. A lot died, and Frankie and Hugh were responsible for a lot of the ones that did work.\n\nOverall: Kind of a blah way of starting the extended runs. It’s mostly due to topic selection, as well as two panelists that didn’t fit. Jan didn’t say much but wasn’t funny at all, just like in WL. Michael had some good lines, but when he had too much time to do his thing, he faltered, with a lot of too-cheeky, too un-MTW bits that even began to grate on the panelists. Plus, he also didn’t seem as connected to the conversations as others [hence the Tour de France bit]. Frankie and Russell did have very nice nights, and Hugh had a quieter but nice go as well. There were good bits, and a TON of great Frankie material, but other than that, very okay.\n\nBest Regular: Frankie. Come on now.\n\nBest Guest: By default, Michael had funnier moments.\n\nWorst Performer: Jan was useless.\n\nBest Round: If This is the Answer had the most bang for its buck.\n\nBest Topic: Tree Robber\n\nBest Runner: revolving doors\n\nCOMING UP NEXT: Two favorites that debuted fairly recently return. Some fairly classic rounds as well.\n\nSeasonal Code: S14E17\n\nProduction Number: 507\n\nCW Seasonal Code: S13E12\n\nSeason 14 of Whose Line lasted 17 episodes. An odd number. Curious.\n\nThis was a relatively strong year. We did have a lot of very nice leftovers, and a lot of much needed strong stuff from Jeff and Greg, but we also had a lot of just okay shows that felt like the episodes were true leftovers shows.\n\nThis last show of the season was the last S13 guest star show left to air, which thankfully meant another trip back to the Greg Proops taping that season. Here we get the other relevant but affordable NSync member, Lance Bass, best known for his TV personality work [I think he hosts The Circle], failed space mission attempt and open homosexuality.\n\nColin and Ryan both have maracas in their intros.\n\nLet’s Make a Date: Greg must choose from:\n\nWayne – Over-caffeinated rabbit going through a busy day\n\nColin – Cowardly lion who only gains confidence when he kisses people\n\nRyan – The world’s trashiest grandmother looking for love\n\nWayne has some high-energy stuff to start, then, inevitably:\n\nWayne…always does this before he even knows what Colin’s quirk is. And Colin is 9 times out of 10 going to screw with Wayne in this game.\n\nThen Wayne goes and humps several guys in the audience, because sure.\n\nColin’s Cowardly Lion occasionally verges on Snagglepuss territory, a lot like Chip’s back in the day.\n\nThen, Colin…of course…:\n\nThough I do love the new, energized Colin afterwards: “I COULD TEACH YA ANYTHING YA’D WANT. If you were creamed spinach, IIIIII’D EAT YA.”\n\nRyan, in his trashy grandmother voice…does sound a BIT like Carol Channing. But hey, old habits…\n\nRyan, looking over at Colin, takes out his teeth:\n\nColin can sell unmitigated horror, especially in scenes with Ryan\n\nThen Ryan goes over and ties his sagging tits in a knot around a very horrified Colin. Who…has a trump card that he’s likely waiting to use, but…somehow doesn’t, as Ryan controls the disgust all the way to the end.\n\nAisha: “you wanna try and offer a-”\n\nRyan: “OHHH I’M NOT DONE YET. I was about to offer him a little prune-tang.”\n\nJESUS\n\nGreg: “…is there an opposite of being turned on?”\n\nRyan: “GUILTY”\n\nGreg, turning into Dennis Miller: “not since Borax was discovered in Death Valley has a greater drying agent been found than these three…”\n\nGreg, after figuring out Wayne: “I haven’t seen coffee ever get someone that horny…”\n\nWayne: “You haven’t seen my creamer commercial.”\n\n[LOUD PROOPS LAUGH]\n\nAisha: “precision is key here at Whose Line…”\n\nRyan, alluding to Colin’s: “PRECISION, EVEN…”\n\nA pretty good LMAD. It was a bit simple at one round, but it packed a lot of good stuff in there. Greg was also a really good straight person here.\n\nDuet: Wayne and Lance sing an NSync song to Jackie, who dreams of a cotton-candy-filled planet called Sweetness where there are also unicorns [I swear to god I’m sober rn]\n\nLance is in a very good mood coming in, giving Wayne a hug, waving to the guys in the back. Seems very confident.\n\nI credit the producers for letting this be a duet, a lot like Joey Fatone’s appearance. You have Lance, he can do musical improv, it’s a done deal. Now, will it be as good as Wanya Morris’s? Probably not.\n\nWayne introduces Jackie to Lance\n\nLance: ‘we’ve met”\n\nJackie: “yes, I’ve seen…many of your photos.”\n\nLance’s musical improv has the right idea, there’s some minor clumsiness fitting a lot of his thoughts into the structure, but he’s achieving the tone of the piece, maybe without the lyrical cleverness that Wayne, and even Joey, is capable of. Like, Wayne sneaks in a very clever Uranus joke without messing up his time. Lance isn’t to that level yet.\n\nI also love Wayne adding, on this planet of cotton candy, “oh, crap, I’m diabetic”\n\nWayne: “oh, baby, don’t you see…”\n\nI love this. Lance completely into it. Wayne, knowing what he knows about Lance, going ‘hmm’. This is a face Colin usually pulls when Wayne does an innuendo in this game. Kinda funny to see the torch passed.\n\nWayne: “…I think Lance is going for a re-entry…”\n\nWayne places some scene details about what’s going on with the spaceship, then goes “oh crap, I really know way too much about this, I should just shut up”\n\nA pretty fun number overall. Lance’s clumsiness was made up for with his excitement and zeal for doing this. He got the tone of the song, his dancing was very fun, and he got along well with Wayne, who did well taking the heavy lifting of the song.\n\nWayne, afterwards, tries that pickup line [“care to go to planet sweetness?”] on a girl from the audience that looks EXACTLY like someone I went to high school with. I can’t confirm it’s her, cause idk if she was in LA during these tapings, but…looks kinda similar. Probably not her though, I think the girl I went to high school with is slightly lighter skinned. Same hair, smile, and height though. Anyway, I’m rambling on.\n\nAisha: “well played, beautiful lady in the front row”\n\nWayne: “her BOYFRIEND didn’t like it…”\n\nMixed Messages: Space captain Colin and his crewmen Greg and Wayne are hiding on their spaceship which has been boarded by hostile aliens\n\nRyan gives a very loud “OHHHH!” to…a game he is not in.\n\nAlso, another space-themed scene! This is what bringing Lance Bass on can do!\n\nGreg, in hearing there’s aliens outside…gives some directions of getting around LA.\n\nColin: “that’s not gonna help!”\n\n[That’s honestly the most Greg thing possible. Even him reading someone else’s texts is a regional joke from the LA area. Remember, it’s not hot, my friends…]\n\nWayne copies a move from Jonathan earlier this taping season and rolls off a very long text. Colin punctuates by telling him to shut up.\n\nGreg: “So can you take whoever wants to go and meet me there at 3:30?”\n\nColin: ‘we can’t split up, we have to protect the ship!”\n\nWayne: “FO SHO.”\n\nPFFF\n\nGreg: “Oh, you’re sleeping. Well, I haven’t even burned the incense yet, I just set it up in my room, SMELLS AMAZING…SO THAT’S COOL.”\n\nGreg is a natural at this game because he, on the norm, can pull off sounding exactly like a teenage girl from the valley.\n\nGreg, suddenly, to Colin: “How tall are you?”\n\nColin: “uhhh, 6’1, why?”\n\nWayne, extending for a high-five: “DUDE, FUCK YEAH!”\n\nThe timing of this made me laugh.\n\nGreg: “JK, at the happy hour they were asking how tall you were and they both answered at the same time.”\n\nColin, pivoting to understanding: “really, JK’s interested.”\n\nAND THEN HE GOES RIGHT BACK INTO HIS CHARACTER. Ryan DIES at this in the back.\n\nGreg: “and it’s not like, okay, average to be like “oh, I’m comfortable telling you my height” after saying you like tall girls, like NO…”\n\nPFFFF. And we end on that line.\n\nA pretty fun, well-fleshed-out MM, with a lot of great moments from Greg, and some good little moves from everybody.\n\nI also love Greg, before he gives the phone back, taking a selfie with the audience, so she has something to take home with her. All class, that Greg Proops, genuinely.\n\nScenes from a Hat:\n\n“Things you can say about America that you can’t say about your partner”\n\nRyan: “hehhh, we’re FUCKED.”\n\nI think that puts us at 24.\n\nAisha: “I’m afraid I can’t let you in, I built a wall down south.”\n\n25\n\nGreg: “wow, we’ve been out here for weeks and I haven’t even seen the Great Divide”\n\nAUDIENCE GROANS\n\nGreg: ‘…REALLY?”\n\n…nobody works off a tough crowd like Greg Proops, man\n\n“If the Jerry Springer show featured nursery rhyme characters”, which we already saw in this season’s Keegan show, and please just bring back Daytime Talk Show\n\nColin: “my wife ran away with the spoon!”\n\nSimple, but nailed in the delivery\n\nColin, putting it over the edge: “FUCKING CUTLERY.”\n\n…He was so close to saying an even worse word…\n\nThe game ends with Aisha and Wayne getting in a Miss Muffet-esque brawl, and Ryan has to go “WE’RE DONE. WE’RE DONE. GREG, END THE GAME.”\n\n“We’ll see you after the break, y’all…”\n\nKind of a flimsy SFAH. Only a few scenes, and a lot of stuff we’ve seen before. With some good energy, of course, especially from Aisha, but…kinda ‘what was left over’.\n\nAisha: “I will be giving you points, however they’re in Russian rubles..”\n\nRyan, of course: “oh, we’ll be able to spend those soon…”\n\n26.\n\nHelping Hands: Ryan is a big-shot Broadway producer trying to persuade Lance to star in his new musical over a meal at his favorite Chinese restaurant\n\nAlready we’re banking on the blind dissonance, of Colin not getting any rice onto the plate, and eventually Ryan’s mouth.\n\nRyan: “Guess what time of year it is!”\n\nPOOR LANCE\n\nRyan: “IT’S CHRISTMAS TIME!”\n\nThis explains why this one ended up airing late, in the very festive time of…early October.\n\nAlso, I love Ryan bouncing up and down and Colin shaking the rice. The rice goes airborne and barely stays in the bowl\n\nLance’s improv is reacting to things in the scene and not quite reacting to Ryan. So he’s not an entirely great support. He’s trying, he’s being free-moving and cool, but he’s not quite keeping the scene going, a lot of that is on Ryan.\n\nRyan holds this position with a throaty scream for a good 7 seconds:\n\nRyan: “take a bite- NONO, TAKE A BIG BITE.”\n\nAgain, the Lea Thompson strategy of making the guests go for it, always works.\n\nColin opens Lance’s beer using Ryan’s suit jacket, which cracks up Ryan. Of course, he shakes up Ryan’s bottle a lot, because…we’ve got to. Surprisingly, there’s not a TON of fizz upon opening.\n\nI do love the struggle of Ryan trying to get his mouth around the beer bottle and Colin continuously moving it, and making it very difficult for him.\n\nLance has a great move in bopping the top of Ryan’s beer with the bottom of his, and causing EVEN MORE FIZZ TO COME OUT OF RYAN’s. An old trick Lou Pearlman taught him, I suppose.\n\nRyan sees if there’s any tea leaves in the kettle by pouring the water on Colin’s hand. Thankfully it’s not boiling. It turns into Colin having a violent struggle with the top of the kettle. This is a very good HH for physical humor.\n\nRyan, being himself: “let me sing you a little song before you go…on the WELL KNOWN CHINESE UKULELE…”\n\nRyan: [DOES HAWAIIAN GIBBERISH] “You know what that means in Hawaiian? We accept master charge.”\n\nLance picks up the ukulele and does some similar hawaiian gibberish\n\nRyan: ‘WAIT A SECOND, DID YOU SAY ‘I MIGHT-A LIKE-A YOUR DICKY DICK?”\n\nLance:\n\nThat’s genuinely the best way he could have responded.\n\nRyan: “That’s what it sounded like!”\n\nLance:\n\nTHAT’S THE WAY YOU DO IT. Beautiful. And a great game-ending move. You don’t see the Backstreet Boys doing a gag like that.\n\nI liked this HH, actually. Lots of physical bits and good Ryan lines, and some different types of hijinks for this game. Lance’s improv wasn’t great but he was very present in the scene, and did help things along at times, especially with the beer trick. Not as good as Joey Fatone, but not bad.\n\nOverall: We end with a pretty good guest show. I found myself saying ‘pretty good’ a lot this show, as nothing particularly WOWED me, but nothing was very bad, either. There were just games were good things happened, but not enough of them [LMAD, SFAH], and games that were funny but weren’t HUGE [Duet, Mixed Messages]. And Helping Hands was a pretty good one, but it’s still not a high tier HH for this run of the show. Lance did a nice job, was game, and really came off well in HH [more than Duet], but he had some slight improv issues that held me back from lauding him like I did his former bandmate. There was great stuff from Greg tonight, capping off a great season for him, and there was a lot of nice stuff from Aisha. But a lot of tonight’s show felt a little ‘been there, done that’. And while this isn’t a BAD show, it just sort of wound up feeling meh a lot, which is as close to bad as this run can get.\n\nShow Winners: All four\n\nBest Performer: Greg Proops. A standout in all 3 games he was in.\n\nWorst Performer: Once again, going with Colin for doing the least amount of standing out.\n\nBest Game: Helping Hands had the most consistent strong vibes, and one hell of an ending.\n\nWorst Game: Scenes from a Hat had the least amount going on.\n\nGuest Star Rating: 8/10. Lance was in a good mood, and had some good moves to distract from his inexperience.\n\nSEASON 14 SUPERLATIVES\n\nBest Episode: E11. Was not expecting this one to come off the best out of everything, but every game here was hysterical. LMAD and GH felt classic, and Doo-Wop had that fatal faux-pas by Colin. Floored me.\n\n2nd Best Episode: E9, thanks to some great support from Heather, one of my favorite Secret rounds ever, Wayne’s really funny stuff in GH, and lots of little things I’d somehow forgotten about.\n\n3rd Best Episode: E4, AKA the Jonathan Gets Injured show, featuring a Forward Reverse that ends in peril, Infomercial nearly nailing him with a ball, and Colin getting lopped in the head in Sideways Scene for good measure. Entertainingly, fun, especially for a S10 taping.\n\nWorst Episode: E1, the Ross Matthews show. The guest games sunk this one tremendously, mostly because I don’t like Ross and he came off like improv poison. Even some decent guestless games couldn’t save this.\n\nMost Necessary Leftover: E6, A Greg Proops guestless show that’s excellent all-around. Kinda sad we didn’t have one of those to this point.\n\nEpisode Most Worthy of Another Look: E5. I rated this one lower than I’d thought I would, and I wanna see if I was too harsh. Hoedown I’ll probably stay the same on.\n\nSeason That Came Off The Best: Season 12, responsible for 3 of my 4 favorite shows of the season.\n\nBest Regular: Wayne Brady, continuing his dominance, and winning close to a third of the season’s shows for me.\n\nBest Fourth Seater: I’m giving it to Greg, because while Jeff did more shows, he also was shut out of more shows. This season, the editors finally figured out how to showcase more of Greg, and he had more moments to shine this season, which was well-deserved.\n\nBest Guest Star: Cornelius Smith Jr., E15, for fitting right in, being game for whatever, and having a lot of fun.\n\nWorst Guest Star: Ross Matthews, E1. Is it possible for a gay person to be so gay that he’s actually kinda homophobic?\n\nShows Ranked: See my Twitter, @WLIIAWatchdown\n\nCOMING UP NEXT: 2019 brings a new taping season, a new Greg taping, and a guest booking that maybe in hindsight may not have been the best idea to bring out first.\n\nSeasonal Code: S14E16\n\nProduction Number: 604\n\nCW Seasonal Code: S14E10\n\nWe return to a Gary S13 taping that gave us three shows already, but still has room for one more. How nice.\n\nQuestions: Passions erupt in a sci-fi movie\n\nThere’s a simple Wayne-Gary scene, then Ryan comes in with…\n\n#22, this whole bit, I reckon\n\nWayne, of course: “Are you here to make the galaxy ‘great again’?”\n\nRyan: “…HOW AM I GONNA FUCK *THIS* UP?”\n\nUnderrated. Just a more realistic approach\n\nWayne: “Would you like to read the 4,000 ways I have written down?”\n\nRyan: “You think I can READ??”\n\nRyan gets Wayne out with an easy ‘would I?’ ‘peg leg’ gag\n\nColin comes in with a fly hat\n\nRyan: “boy, what I’d give to be you on a wall…”\n\nColin: “…what the hell is that?”\n\nRyan: “it’s not a question, I’ll tell you that…”\n\nAisha, finally: BUZZ\n\nRyan: “…did I get buzzed?”\n\nAisha: “I think you did”\n\nRyan: “…JUST LIKE THE REAL GUY, I CAN’T HEAR WHAT EVERYBODY’S FUCKIN DOING!”\n\nSo good\n\nI love Gary coming in as a jellyfish hooker, and Colin and Gary hanging on for a while talking about the transaction\n\nColin: “what will you do for me?”\n\nGary, barely holding it together: “wouldn’t you like to know?”\n\nRyan enters in a cabbie hat: “where you headed?”\n\nColin, like Ryan before, goes for the joke rather than the question: “…turd planet from the…left…”\n\nWayne comes in looking like this:\n\nRyan: “Y’ever see Tommy Chong anymore?”\n\nHAAAAAA. Put de puppy on de floor and LET’ER GOOOOO.\n\nAlso, you can hear Colin laugh at this one as well.\n\nRyan comes in as a cop and does a beating motion\n\nWayne: “IS THIS JUST LIKE IN REAL LIFE?”\n\nOf course. Ryan has a wry smile.\n\nWayne takes off his wig and says “That’s right, I SAID that shit…”\n\nA great Questions to start us off. More put-together and fleshed out than the last few, and with great stuff from everybody. Easy stuff, like the Trump mask and Worf, got actual well thought out explanations.\n\nSound Effects: Ryan and Colin are two of the Three Musketeers, who hear that they must fight their way into a heavily-armed castle to rescue the hysterical French royal family\n\nThere’s a very classic Ryan-Colin exchange when Colin suggests they use their muskets\n\nRyan: “…muskets?”\n\nColin: “…well, we are MusketEERS…”\n\nThe editors show how frustrated Anne is that she keeps missing Ryan’s cues. Ryan even goes “I MIGHT MAKE NO NOISE TODAY!”\n\nSure enough, Anne does some ‘boom boom boom’ noises eventually, and now it’s NAOMI who isn’t doing sounds. Colin and Ryan are hiding a lot of frustration early on\n\nThen, as Colin has made two attempts to do beckon his horse, and none have worked:\n\nRyan: “I have an idea…let’s take the Prius!”\n\nRyan swings his sword around, thinks he hears something under a Colin line, and shushes him, as Anne’s FINALLY figuring out how this game works. And it’s pretty alright sword noises.\n\nColin sets up a sound: “Now…the sound of my musket may alert some people”\n\nRyan: “your musket makes no sound!”\n\nAnd we hear a very alarmed noise from Naomi. Now SHE’S figured out how this game. I do love that Colin looks curiously at his gun as this noise happens.\n\nBut, Colin fires…\n\nNaomi: “….PEW.”\n\nRyan:\n\nI love this.\n\nColin: “I had it on low…”\n\nColin prompts a rope noise. Naomi does this…weird sort of yell, sort of ‘UHHHP-UP-UP’ thing. Ryan, afterwards, smokes a cigarette.\n\nColin: “LISTEN. I HEAR THE PANICKED CRY OF THE QUEEN.”\n\nNaomi: “….ohhhh.”\n\nPFFFFF\n\nThis is probably the closest we’re going to get to the ‘voice of God’ ending.\n\nAs the ladies head back to the audience, you can hear Ryan doing Naomi’s ‘OHHHH’ a few more times.\n\nI looked at my tweets from this episode’s airing, and I said here that this SFX stopped right as it was about to get going, right as Naomi and Anne got the hang of the gang, and I still agree. That last moment was Naomi finally understanding how this game works, and it’s a shame it took so long for them both to get there. I wish they’d take a moment to do what they do onstage and have the audience members test out SFX, so they know how it works. So for a while we just had another ‘the audience members can’t do sound effects’ playing of this, and those are fine, but we just had one of those not too long ago, and you need more where…they can actually do some.\n\nThis was funny, and had some good moments, but I wish they would have kept it going a bit longer, cause otherwise A.) the scene goes nowhere and B.) the SFX ladies can’t do anything.\n\nAisha, though: “that has to be one of my favorite Sound Effects we’ve ever done…”\n\nColin: “people are just gonna be turning up the volume…”\n\nAisha: “only DOGS and improvvers can hear these sounds…”\n\nFilm Dub: One day at the ranch\n\nThe construct of this one is pretty funny- Ryan and Colin have a scene with a guitar, meanwhile at the same time they keep cutting to Gary and Wayne, trying to do a romantic scene. Gary has this very funny Kermit-esque southern accent. And the hook is that Ryan keeps trying to sing and Gary and Wayne want him to stop\n\nRyan’s song, “My Sheep Named Billy” [perhaps a relative of ‘My Lovely Horse’], is peak Ryan silliness. I love Colin trying to harmonize and just doing gibberish alongside him\n\nWayne, not fitting at all: “howdy fellas”\n\nGary: ‘mrreaaghh….I don’t smell good…”\n\nIt’s that simple. Gary is really underrated in this game\n\nWayne, coming in to join Ryan and Colin: “hi, is this the Adele cover band?”\n\nRyan, after his and Colin’s characters do this little hoppy dance to come over: “we’re pretending like we’re small horses!”\n\nWayne: “You guys know ‘shut the hell up’ in E flat?”\n\nThen Gary’s character comes in and\n\nGary: “WAITAMINUTE, WHAT THE HECK…”\n\nColin: “COME ON!”\n\nPFFFFFF\n\nA very fun and silly Film Dub that…went to that really ridiculous final gag and impressed me.\n\nScenes from a Hat:\n\n“Really bad teachers”\n\nWayne: “Everyone open your ALT HISTORY book to page 47…”\n\n23!\n\nAisha: “oooh, edgy!”\n\nColin, writing on the blackboard: “what’s…the…point?”\n\n“Things you can say at the gym that you can’t say about your partner”\n\nWayne: “hey, if you’re gonna use the thing, at least wipe off your sweat!”\n\nANOTHER strong audience reaction\n\nWayne: “…I accomplished the challenge!”\n\nWayne: “I think this is too much weight for me to handle”\n\nOUTRAGED AUDIENCE REACTION\n\nWayne: “I think I’m gonna need a spot. HEY JIM, D’YOU WANNA GET ON THIS?”\n\nColin, not the only time he’ll land a joke with this line this era: “NOT AGAIN.”\n\nRyan: “I guess I lost interest, I used to come three times a week.”\n\nJEEZ that scraped into the broadcast. You can even hear Gary’s surprised reaction\n\nColin: “shall we start on the big balls?” and then he shrugs\n\nRyan, back at the step: “BIG BALLS? What gym is that? From 1942?”\n\n“World’s Worst medical ads”\n\nColin: “according to our studies, LIFE is sexually transmitted..we want to nip that in the bud”\n\nThis good joke is followed by an odd edit\n\nJust a really odd keyframe mix\n\n“Pick-up lines of Aisha Tyler”\n\nAisha, to the audience: “I didn’t write it!”\n\nWayne does one where he takes out his teeth, then his eyes\n\nAisha, eventually buzzing with every syllable: “GET OUT OF THERE. PUT. THEM. BACK IN. AND GET. OUT. OF. THERE.”\n\nRyan: “oh, don’t worry, I’ll buzz you when I think you’re through.”\n\nAn alright SFAH. Not a ton of new, innovative stuff. Just kinda…there.\n\nGreatest Hits: Songs of the Bartender\n\nRyan takes an interesting approach to this one\n\nRight as Colin does his opening joke, Ryan figures out what he’s gonna do:\n\nColin: “we’ll be back to our documentary on when clowns divorce in Custard-y Battle in just a second…”\n\nHAAA\n\nRyan, very drunk, off of Colin: “SWEEDAAA DEAL FRYOOU…”\n\nColin:\n\nColin: “Do not tell me you’ve been drinking before we came to work”\n\nRyan: “IHAAAAAAAAlil drinking fore we came tawork…”\n\nRyan is such a good drunk, too\n\nRyan: “and there’s a guythere…at this bar….that pourrrs drinks fryou…”\n\nColin: [lets a long pause go by] “He’s called a bartender.”\n\nI love that Colin knows exactly how to play off of Ryan here\n\nColin, as Ryan nods off slightly: “…well, we’re in the third hour of Ryan’s introductions…”\n\nKind of Colin’s answer to APPARENTLY OUR MOVIE IS OVER NOW.\n\nColin intros a Barry White-Nicki Minaj number\n\nRyan: “WHITE MINAJ…A MINAJ A TWAAAAAAAA…”\n\nI…love this one.\n\nAnd as Colin keeps introing it:\n\nI love this. Ryan’s still being a good support, but he’s also annoying Colin at the same time.\n\nColin finally gets out the song title: “Too Much Salt on the Rim”:\n\nRyan:\n\nSOMEHOW THIS GETS HIM TO BREAK. Like the GHs of old\n\nGary’s Barry White is great, and this may be one of the better times he does it. Wayne’s Nicki is still great, and he gets right into it seamlessly.\n\nAnd somehow, both singing on top of each other works in a chaotic, funny way.\n\nWe cut back to Ryan and Colin:\n\nRyan: “GREAT SONG.”\n\nThe glass of red bull in the background is a nice touch.\n\nColin: “My sperm count just doubled.”\n\nRyan: “I KNOW…I SAW.”\n\nThis has enhanced the dynamic, for sure.\n\nColin starts the next shot with his hand covering Ryan’s mouth…then he looks at it and wipes it off. Little things this game.\n\nAt the top of their modern funk number, Gary and Wayne get some good unison dance moves, which is pretty fun\n\nThis song is more about a mood and likeness than lyrics, but I love Wayne’s “oh what the hell’s on the floor/unidentified fluid” line\n\nI like that this song turns into Gary licking the floor, as Wayne provides realistic lyrics like ‘there’s something wrong/that’s not where your tongue belongs!”\n\nBefore we wrap up, we have one last shot of Colin and Ryan:\n\nPerfect.\n\nA pretty strong GH, ruled by the banter and the drunk twist Ryan pulled out, which even at the time I thought was a nice change of pace from the last few monotonous GH playings. The songs were pretty good too, with some great Gary-Wayne in-sync-ness, and some fun lyrics and styles. But yeah, this one’s best known for drunk Ryan, which is a great gag.\n\nRyan, referring to another style: “i was just gonna pop my head up and go ‘LES MIS! SHOTS ALL AROUND'”\n\nAisha: “Wonderfully, that’s not very far from how you are on a Saturday night after this show…”\n\nOverall: A good show that sort of bobbed between okay and great for a lot of its runtime. The one chance for some great scene improv, Sound Effects, was ruined by editing it too short and the audience members not getting the hang of things til the end. SFAH was very basic, Questions was a good opener but still kinda messy, and Film Dub was funny but very silly. GH was at least a good anchor with a good hook to set it apart from other playings, but it also feels like we’re missing the other half, with even more drunk shenanigans, and the hinted-at Les Mis style. It’s stranger when you realize that there were two different GH games this taping, for more options, this one and Fast Food, and even knowing that it still feels incomplete. So as is, this is kind of a mishandled and muffled show, which is a shame, because it felt very fun in points.\n\nIt occurs to me now that pretty much every show from this taping didn’t entirely work for me. Both guest star shows were either meh or just stupid alright, then you have 14×10 which was good but nondescript, and now this one, which is good but mishandled. Maybe this just wasn’t a great taping for them, a lot like the 2×03 Greg taping from ABC.\n\nShow Winners: All four\n\nBest Performer: Ryan, with GH, took a shock lead over Wayne, who was on his way to another win.\n\nWorst Performer: Gary did a lot of backup tonight, and had a few SFAH jokes that didn’t get great response.\n\nBest Game: Greatest Hits was the meatiest, and had that excellent Drunk Ryan runner.\n\nWorst Game: SFAH had the least amount going on.\n\nCOMING UP NEXT: The last show of Season 14, and one last S13 guest star show for the road. AND it’s a GREG SHOW!\n\nSeasonal Code: S14E15\n\nProduction Number: 501\n\nCW Seasonal Code: S13E11\n\nWe’re back to the Jeff taping where Chip showed up, cause they actually did have a normal guest star that time. Cornelius Smith Jr. was on All My Children for a bit, and was on Scandal, a Shondaland drama that…I guess was a WB product? It’s out of ABC Studios, but how else do you explain two Shondaland people coming on here?\n\nWeird Newscasters: Colin anchors, Jeff, Enthusiastic squeegee guy who thinks Colin is a car, co-anchors, Ryan, the Wizard of Oz in 30 seconds, does sports while Wayne, manic ad man selling the entire audience, does weather\n\nThank god, a movie Ryan’s seen\n\nColin: “Welcome to the 6:00…What Now?”\n\nI think that technically counts as Trump Reference Number 19.\n\nColin: “I am your anchor…Sven Doves Cry”\n\nJeff, after a beat:\n\nColin: “According to a recent study, women who carry extra weight live longer than men who comment on it.”\n\nFeels like a S2-era one\n\nJeff, eventually:\n\nI love Colin here. Dumbfounded, looking over at Aisha for help\n\nJeff sees a spot on Colin’s head that’s “not coming out”:\n\nJeff would say in a 2020 Quarantine Zoom video that “I can literally describe what Colin’s scalp tastes like, cause I’ve licked it so many times. It’s a mixture of flop sweat and makeup.” This must be one of the times where he felt a sense of familiarity.\n\nJeff, stopping for a moment: “your car’s really salty!”\n\nColin, defeated: “….now sports…”\n\nI love that. No comment, no build. Just…a very weak ‘now sports’.\n\nRyan’s is great because this is a movie he’s DEFINITELY seen numerous times, and he does very well running through the movie. I love the moment where Ryan’s REALLY into it, moving 100 miles per hour, and we get the wide:\n\nColin’s just amused by the whole thing\n\nColin, after Ryan finishes up: “wow, he saw that movie!”\n\nI LOVE THAT\n\nWayne’s makes him work on the fly off of people, which he can do. First he offers up “our super…caucasian model…”\n\nnice of Jack Whitehall’s dumber brother to come on the show\n\nWayne, to some filipinos: “here, stand up, all five of you”\n\nSIX FILIPINOS IN A ROW STAND UP\n\nWayne: ‘well…we can’t count here at the emporium!”\n\nPFFFF. I feel like this would be something that’d lead to some cackling Drew in the back if this were on the ABC version.\n\nI’ll give these audience members credit- Wayne pimps them out to turn into a ‘state of the art human castle’ and they do the scenery work in seconds.\n\nA pretty strong WN overall. Ryan and Jeff paved some usual beats but got a lot out of them. Wayne’s was a phenomenal one just for working off audience members. It felt fresh and a strong show ender.\n\nDuet: Jeff and Wayne sing a Beastie Boys song to Cornelius\n\nWell, some actual regular scene improv was fun, let’s go onto just guest games and quickfires for the rest of the show.\n\nWayne clearly knows Cornelius. After Wayne asks if he’s seeing anyone, Cornelius reveals he’s in a relationship after a pause.\n\nWayne: “WHY’D IT TAKE YOU THAT LONG?”\n\nCornelius: “I had to just…make sure I understood the question.”\n\nWayne: “…well, she’s gonna understand YO ASS when you get home…”\n\nWayne makes this a rap song about digging yourself out of a relationship hole\n\nJeff, therefore, to Cornelius: “just confess, if you have a girlfriend, JUST SAY YES.”\n\nWayne suggests he’s doing this song for Cornelius’ benefit, “and when we finish ya might have a home TA GO TO.”\n\nJeff: “TONIGHT, WHEN HOME YOU GO, YOUR GIRL’S GONNA LOOK AT YOU, SAY ‘OH HELL NO!”\n\nEverything’s snapping into place with this one\n\nCornelius tries his hand at rapping, and does pretty well, though his rhyme scheme doesn’t follow the backing’s. He’s confident, he keeps the thesis of the song going, and he doesn’t wimp out at any point.\n\nJeff, after Cornelius gets the crowd, and the girl, back on his side: “because you linger, you go home and put a ring on that finger!”\n\nCornelius nails a rap, to camera, to his girl [as a proposal]. As of May 2018, Cornelius is a married man, so I guess this game worked.\n\nA very strong Duet, with great, snappy stuff from all three, and a very funny thesis. Cornelius was game, and had some great stuff himself. Plus, this song may be the reason why the dude went and got married in the first place. A win on all accounts.\n\nAisha: “That song is also known as the relationship accelerator rap…like ‘I got this girl, we’ve been kicking it for a couple weeks, NOW I’M PROPOSING ON TELEVISION…”\n\nWayne, to the audience: “hey, who’s here on a date?”\n\nAisha: “DON’T ANSWER.”\n\nWayne: “you wanna get married? Somebody’s gonna get married by the time we finish this show…”\n\nSomebody’s sad he missed the proposal back in S12…\n\nAisha: “NOBODY MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH WAYNE…”\n\nMeanwhile:\n\nDammit, I love this show so much.\n\nWayne, in response to Aisha’s ‘eye contact’ comment, just walks towards the desk, and Aisha makes two microphones into a sign of the cross. Man, I love when the show gets this loose.\n\nLiving Scenery: Ryan and Colin are two pirates on the high seas relaxing on their ship when they spy a Spanish galleon ripe for plunder; Wayne and Cornelius are props\n\nRyan: “That’s not what my parrot says”\n\nCornelius, crouching to Ryan’s shoulder: “GAAAAAAAHH”\n\nRyan, turning this into Sound Effects: “…that hawk ate my parrot…”\n\n[I love Cornelius’ move of spitting something out here]\n\nI also love Wayne demonstrating the Spanish galleon by speaking Spanish towards the camera and raising a flag. He knows how to scene-dress\n\nThe act of Ryan “loading the cannons” by turning Cornelius around and stuffing his ass with a cannonball is…classic for this game, I think\n\nThe knowing glance Ryan exchanges with Colin here is great\n\nRyan: “I know SOMEONE who’s gonna fire his agent in the morning..”\n\nCornelius, to his credit, set-dresses with Wayne on the other ship\n\nDuring a ‘duel’, Colin’s stuffing Wayne: “oh, my pole broke!”\n\nRyan: You can use mine!”\n\nAnd he grabs Cornelius, who winces, knowing what’s about to happen\n\nColin: “…I wanna appreciate you helping me with this duel”\n\nRyan: “No, I’d like to watch you!”\n\nAgain, Cornelius is shaking his head as Colin turns him towards Wayne’s ass\n\nWayne: “OH NO, DAT’S A *SCANDAL.”\n\nPFFFF\n\nHonestly, too short. There was good stuff here, but it felt like it only lasted a minute and a half. I could have used more. But oh well, shorter guest game.\n\nWayne says that in order to pull off Cornelius’ shirt, “you’ve gotta be really fit”, and takes off his jacket. LAURA JUST STARTS PLAYING SOME OLD-TIMEY STRIPPING MUSIC TO BACK HIM UP. God bless Laura Hall.\n\nScenes from a Hat:\n\n“World’s Worst Commercials”\n\nWayne, going right back to WN, goes over to the filipinos, one of whom audibly goes “OH MAN’ as he gets up.\n\nWayne uses Colin for “a dating app called MY DICK”\n\nColin: “…start small and work your way up!”\n\nWayne loses it at that\n\nEVEN AS THE NEXT ONE’S ABOUT TO START:\n\nSTILL GONE\n\n“Hitchhikers you wouldn’t want to give a ride to”\n\nWayne: “You wanna talk politics?”\n\nColin: “Bye”\n\n…I’m counting this as #20\n\nRyan starts hitchhiking with his dick, only for Wayne to pull over\n\nRyan, with a great idea: “HEY, I SAW YOUR COMMERCIAL!”\n\nWAYNE, ONCE AGAIN:\n\nWHAT IS WITH HIM TONIGHT?\n\n“Love songs that will instantly kill the mood”\n\nColin: “the lovemaking was beautifulllll….here’s 20 bucks for the cab ride home!”\n\nJeff: “when the lights go down low, over at my place\n\nand it’s dark as dark can be, picture Colin Mochrie’s face…”\n\nColin:\n\nHe at least knows how to play it\n\nJeff: “Think of that face and you’ll never have an orgasm agaiiiin…”\n\nColin:\n\nColin this whole show has just known what power he has over Jeff, to crack him up. He didn’t used to have this in IAG.\n\nRyan: “I’m gonna TRUMP your rump…”\n\nTWENTY ONE\n\nRyan, to Aisha: “SEE HOW I KILLED IT? INSTANTLY!”\n\nWayne does a song about ‘filling you with kids’: “I give you one kid, two kid, three kids, more/Damn, we’ll be like doggies, give you six on the floor.”\n\nBUZZ\n\nJeff, at the step: “SIX ON THE FLOOR?”\n\nRyan, coming in: “I COULDN’T KEEP YOUR KIDS IN ME…”\n\nWayne:\n\nThey’re all going down like dominoes this show…\n\nWayne: “I’m never having sex again…”\n\nJeff: “WHEN I GET YOU ALL ALONE, I’LL MAKE YOU DRY AS A BONE.”\n\nBUZZ\n\nRyan, to the side, amused: ‘that’s quite a talent…”\n\nAisha: “I love the way you moan…but I gotta be quiet, cause my husband’s coming home…”\n\nRyan:\n\n“THEN I GUESS WE BETTER LEAVE…”\n\nPERFECT\n\nThe CW cut features the odd man out in a pickup:\n\nReally strong SFAH. Good stuff all over, great runners, and that last scene was phenomenal all the way through. I see why this went on so long, but I still wish LS had been longer.\n\nHelping Hands: Ryan, hands by Colin, is a flirtatious mother meeting her future son-in-law Cornelius for the first time whilst preparing desserts for him\n\nCornelius is actually pretty comfortable here, and is great at working off of Ryan, being forward and asking the right questions\n\nCornelius is also great at playing into the sexual tension that Ryan wants to run with. The way he asks Ryan, on the pudding, “you wanna stir it up for me”, is flirtatious in a very game and willing way. This scene’s gonna go the way it’s gonna go, he’s just gotta be on board with it.\n\nThere is something very funny about sticking with the shot of Ryan gritting his chin while Colin stirs more and more disastrously, as specks of pudding start flying up. Jeff starts losing it in the back at this.\n\nJust the way Cornelius ‘licks the beater’ gets Wayne looking off backstage:\n\nBy the time Ryan starts squeezing hot fudge all over the cake, Jeff just facepalms in the back.\n\nEventually:\n\n…this isn’t a very substantial playing, but things sure are happening\n\nCornelius, remembering the scene: “Is she coming quick, do we have time..?”\n\nRyan, of course: “IS SHE COMING QUICK? I DUNNO…”\n\nAnd Colin punctuates this by feeling over the top of the cake. This is perfect.\n\nThe drastic motion of Colin pelting the cake with sprinkles, like a HARD THROW, cracks up Jeff again. The very violent toss of powdered sugar got me.\n\nAnd so this is where we end:\n\nYeeeahhh…\n\nA…game of Helping Hands. Cornelius was a great foil, and was very forward, and there were a few very funny Colin moves, but…a lot of the same beats this game usually hits, and only little things that set it apart from the rest.\n\nOverall: A pretty good show, with some flaws, especially in some of the guest games. Like, if we’d done a longer cut of Living Scenery and just not aired Helping Hands, we’d be alright. But no, Helping Hands apparently had to be here, because it was played at this taping and all playings have to fucking go out. Whatever, only wounds this one a little. The strength of LS and Duet, as well as Weird Newscasters and SFAH, makes this more than just a boilerplate guest show. Yes, the Cornelius games are all around, and Cornelius himself brought a lot here, but the best moments for me came in WN and SFAH. WN had great character moments, especially from Wayne, and SFAH had so many great runs and callbacks. There was also some really nice banter, a lot of which should have made the CW cut. Not too many huge issues with this one, a much better show than I had anticipated.\n\nShow Winners: All four\n\nBest Performer: Wayne, once again, for having the most leading moments, especially early on. His scene dressing in LS also contributed.\n\nWorst Performer: Colin did the most support work tonight.\n\nBest Game: Scenes from a Hat. So much really good stuff in here, and a lot of great dynamic moments.\n\nWorst Game: Helping Hands was the most okay. I felt like I’d seen it before.\n\nGuest Star Rating: 9/10. Cornelius came to play, did a lot of very funny things, and fit right in during Duet and Helping Hands. Not a ton of issues. He had a lot of fun!\n\nCOMING UP NEXT: A fourth show from a Gary taping we’ve seen 2 episodes from this season.\n\nOne more lower-key panel before we get to the two stacked panels in a row that I’m excited for. We do have a rare returning panelist from the OG Buzzcocks era, and that’s Joe Wilkinson, on loan from Catsdown and being dour elsewhere. I’m not the hugest fan of his, but he does work for me on occasion.\n\nWe also have rapper Aitch and experimental pop project Self Esteem, neither of whom I have heard of.\n\nGreg makes the obvious confusion that Aitch is actually H from Steps, and then does an overdramatic “WHAT??? I’D THOUGHT HE’D HAD A LOT OF WORK DONE.”\n\nDaisy talks about Steps, and says ‘I miss them.”\n\nNoel, confused: “…where have they gone?”\n\nRebecca: “they ARE back, Daisy…”\n\nDaisy: “oh, are they?”\n\nNoel: “they’re not lost at sea, you know that…”\n\nJoe: “doesn’t one of them have a puppy farm? Lisa, is it?”\n\nGreg: “I’m just getting the show lawyer in my ear telling me that Lisa from Steps DOES NOT have an illegal puppy farm…”\n\nJoe: “then i’m a liar…”\n\nJoe can make stuff like this work\n\nGreg: “where did you hear that she had a puppy farm?”\n\nJoe: “none of your fuckin’ business!”\n\nHOW COME *THAT* FUCK GETS CENSORED? THERE’S SO MANY IN THIS SHOW.\n\nJamali, on bands he should be ashamed to like: “yeah, I like Dolly Parton…and I like the German national anthem..”\n\nIt has taken me a bit, but I am firmly on the Jamali train. I really like his stuff.\n\nGreg, on Hitler: “and he dressed snappily as well…”\n\nJamali: “yeah, he dressed fuckin’ snappy, mate…”\n\nGreg, bringing back the earpiece gag: “what’s that? DON’T celebrate Hitler?”\n\nPFFFFF. He’s just become Dara\n\nThe first round is about pranks musicians play, which is cool\n\n50 Cent’s options:\n\nAudible Daisy giggling at the first two\n\nGreg shows a picture of 50 Cent and Sarah Ferguson\n\nAitch: “THAT’s Fergie?”\n\nGreg: “…it’s not Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas…fuck it, every chat I have with Aitch I feel 100 years of age…”\n\nGreg: “50’s just whispering in her ear ‘come on, you must have seen him sweat…”\n\nAnother joke that I feel like Maisie Adam must have submitted.\n\nGreg points out his favorite part of In Da Club is 50 Cent reassuring the listening public that he’s alright after getting shot [“I’m aight!”], and then revealing he’s sampled it as an audio clip tonight. I’m so happy Greg has the power to use audio clips. He’s had so much fun with yipping David Byrne and the Magnum PI theme.\n\nThere’s a nice discussion about yop between Greg and Joe, and Joe just really leans into his character. He abstains from voting C due to his like of yop. Then Greg reveals the answer is C just to screw with everyone [it’s actually B].\n\nGreg: “These days Ja Rule does that prank on himself by simply not selling any tickets..”\n\nThe ones for Alien Ant Farm all feel so bro-y, early-2000s and nu-metal-y:\n\nJamali has an anecdote about a stripper putting her bum in his face and getting pink eye, which is…a truly wild thing we’re not allowed to say on Buzzcocks. You can see Rebecca looking over, unsettled.\n\nRebecca: “what makes a wedgie atomic?”\n\nJoe: “…draw blood.”\n\nPFF\n\nGreg describing this, ‘spider in waiting’, is just…very indicative of nu-metal culture.\n\nMaybe it’s because Noel has more experience doing intros, but I got his Fluorescent Adolescent intro almost immediately.\n\nJamali does his best doing the drums on the table but he’s struggling here\n\nGreg: “well, once again, thank fuck it’s got a recognizable riff, Jamali…”\n\nJoe, looking confident for a moment the dissolving it: “WELL…..I dunno…”\n\nKind of heartbreaking that everyone knows the Arctic Monkeys did it, and the song, but no one knows the title.\n\nNoel and Jamali trying to do Blinding Lights, which is just as easily recognizable, is made funnier by Jamali’s slightly-out-of-time drumbeat and Noel’s sort of wavering melody. It works, but it almost doesn’t.\n\nNoel motions to Jamali and goes “HE FUCKIN NAILED THAT.”\n\nGreg: “I’ll put it on record right now that dung-chukka-dung-chukka is your best work so far..”\n\nKinda humiliating that nobody knows that one either. I SHOULDN’T BE BETTER AT INTROS THAN THE PEOPLE ON THE SHOW.\n\nGreg does a very easy ‘Weeknd taking ‘e’ cause it wasn’t in his name’ joke\n\nJoe, saving it: “E means ecstasy….you can take it orally as well…”\n\nDaisy and Aitch doing Naive Melody, one of my favorite songs of all time, is…somewhat good. This is a rare melody that Daisy can actually convey well in this round.\n\nNoel: “what are you doing with your mouth?”\n\nDaisy: “ah…some sort of piccolo thing…”\n\nGreg: “which…I shouldn’t give any clues, but there isn’t a piccolo anywhere in this song…”\n\nFINALLY SOMEONE GETS AN INTRO ON THIS BLOODY SHOW. Rebecca accurately guesses that it’s Naive Melody by the Talking Heads, and Greg erupts in joy.\n\nThank god, ID Parade, the regular version, is back. Noel’s team has to figure out who was the female vocalist [NOT the one featured in the video] in Meat Loaf’s ‘I’d Do Anything For Love’.\n\nGreg has some really good ID Parade intros:\n\n“#1, I would do anything for love, but I won’t do that\n\n#2, I would do anything for love, INCLUDING THAT\n\n#3, I would do anything for the Communist Party of China”\n\nTHAT ONE GOT ME\n\n“#4, I would do anything for a lie down”\n\n….#4 looks familiar…\n\nShe kinda looks like the ID Parade member who had an arousing staring contest with Bill back in the day.\n\nI’m not…certain it’s her…but they look awful similar.\n\nGreg: “Or #5, oooh, I’d do anything for a cheeky chardonnay with the girls right now”\n\n#5: [nods, as that’s not a bad idea]\n\nJamali: “#4 looks fucking LIVID to be here.”\n\nYeah…that’s her.\n\nRebecca explains that if you’d been cut from the video as someone prettier took your place, you’d be pissed off too\n\nGreg: “I don’t think #4 has necessarily CONTINUED HER RAGE…”\n\n#4:\n\nGreg: “NO, I KNOW SHE’S ANGRY…I just don’t think she’s still angry ab[…]out that.”\n\nEveryone’s cracking up at #4. Just like in the Simon days, she is so good at committing to a bit, and just owning this glare.\n\nJamali: “My brain says one, my heart says 4…”\n\nAlmost a Sean Hughes answer\n\n[ONE MORE CUT TO 4]\n\nRebecca: “your heart will always say 4…”\n\nThey ask the real one, #5, on why she wasn’t in the video, and she says that “they wanted someone who looked like Snow White, and I don’t”, in a very thick Newcastle accent.\n\nGreg asks #5 to give a rendition of the song, which is a cool moment…then he asks #4 to, which is a genius move.\n\nWe saw a lot of these Goldie Looking Chain members back in 25×12, the Barrowman episode [which…hasn’t aged well?], so it’s kind of a repeat panel. I’m glad they gave it to Daisy instead of Noel, who may have remembered.\n\nDaisy asks #4 what his favorite song from the band was, and he nervously peers over at Greg, without a clue.\n\nDaisy: “You should have just researched it before you came on!”\n\nRebecca: “ONE QUICK GOOGLE.”\n\nJoe: “what’dyou do for a living, #4? 15 minutes ago he’s driving a bus…”\n\nThere’s a round where the teams have to figure out which insane spending cost more for musicians.\n\nAitch whispers to Greg how much his watch costs, which Greg can’t believe, and transfers over to Noel’s team. No one can believe it.\n\nJoe: “FUCK OFF.”\n\nAitch takes it off, hands it to Greg…and Greg just walks offstage with it\n\nAitch says they also give you a book “all about the watch, which you don’t read”\n\nJoe: “what does the book say? ‘You fuckin idiot?”\n\nJoe…is having some nice moments here\n\nJamali has to remind Greg “you’re rich as well!”\n\nGreg, taking a sip from his mug: “yeah, I’m doing pretty well…”\n\nJamali: “You’re like ‘ah, I can’t believe you bought a thing that I could also afford…”\n\nUp until ID Parade, this is a rare NMTB where the scores haven’t needed to be redubbed! Hooray!\n\nI like Noel going, once he realizes his team needs 6 to win, “we can’t do this…”\n\nSure enough, the ending scores are redubbed. SO YOU STILL MANAGED TO CUT A ROUND. JESUS.\n\nOverall: Back to blah. Kind of a dead panel, though Rebecca and Joe did try, there just wasn’t a lot of cohesion. Early rounds were kind of weak, as was the later trivia round. Only ID Parade had some big energy, honestly. Really not the fault of the show, just a lot of rounds kinda went by.\n\nBest Regular: Jamali is on a roll, man\n\nBest Guest: Joe had the best good lines\n\nBest Runner: #4\n\nCOMING NEXT WEEK: Thank the gods, a panel featuring people I do know. A Mock the Week favorite and one of the most inexplicably soulful white guys in the world make up just one panel.\n\nSeasonal Code: S14E14\n\nProduction Number: 603\n\nCW Seasonal Code: S14E09\n\nOur second consecutive S11 show, and our second consecutive S11 show where things get nuts.\n\nThis is from the same Greg Proops taping as the Scott Porter and Bill Nye episodes, the former much better than the latter. This is also our third of four Greg shows this season. Great job, CW. And this is also the last S14 show not to be taken from a S13 taping.\n\nQuestions: One day at the beach\n\nGreg and Wayne start with a Little Mermaid-eque scene. Wayne starts as Ariel. Greg, in a Pope’s hat, casts himself as ‘the king of the sea’, but he’s playing it like he’s just meeting Wayne\n\nWayne: “…then wouldn’t you recognize your daughter?”\n\nGreg:\n\nGreg, rebounding perfectly: “have you changed your hair color?”\n\nIt takes Wayne until Ryan comes in to make the Wendy’s joke I thought he was going to start with.\n\nWayne hands some burgers to Ryan and halfway through the line realizes what game he’s playing: “TAKE A Loook at theeese?”\n\nBUZZZZ\n\nRyan:\n\nI love this. Just sort of making fun of Wayne’s lean in.\n\nI love Ryan and Colin’s entire scene with Colin’s sharkbite hat on. Really seamless back-and-forth. Ryan nearly stumbles, going “should I…NOT HAVE SAID SOMETHING?” And is surprised he’s still in.\n\nColin: “what are you trying to say?”\n\nRyan, still very shaken: “…I don’t know WHAT I’m saying!”\n\nBUZZ\n\nGreg, as Elvis: “d’you know I’m lost?”\n\nColin, being himself: “…makes sense.”\n\nEVERYONE’S FORGETTING WHAT GAME THEY’RE IN!\n\nRyan comes in with a very silly clam hat, and even opens it with screaming: “wanna dig for my pearl?”\n\nWayne:\n\nRyan even pulls out some more and puts them around Wayne’s neck\n\nWayne, going one step further: “is that a pearl necklace?”\n\nRyan, knowing the connotation, leaves\n\nGreg, in a knight’s helmet: “would you like to spend the knight with me?”\n\nAUDIENCE GROANS\n\nGreg: “wait for it”\n\nWayne: “have you come from far?”\n\nGreg: “many miles have I……not made a question out of that!”\n\nPFF. This is a good one for people forgetting what game they’re in.\n\nGreg: “I COME FROM THE LAND OF STATEMENTS! We do not ask questions where I come from.”\n\nGreg…being Greg. I love that we get some of that\n\nA fun round, but very much an opening warm-up round. Lots of clumsiness, with only Colin really being completely on at the start. Wayne did have some strong stuff, and Greg and Ryan were great for bombing.\n\nProps: Ryan and Greg vs. Colin and Wayne\n\nAH YES. THIS PROPS.\n\nRyan, at the top of the game:\n\nUsually, we see Wayne have a pained reaction to a prop he knows he can’t do anything with. Here we have a prop EVEN RYAN has nothing for. It’s like a Larry David face. Looking directly at Aisha like ‘well, what the fuck do I do with THIS?”\n\nAisha: “I DIDN’T MAKE THEM!”\n\nFor the first few, Greg’s doing suggestions. Which is rare in this pairing. Ryan usually takes the lead. GREG is the one leading Ryan. He has NOTHING. He’s even half-heartedly yes-anding Greg’s suggestions. Meanwhile, Wayne and Colin are doing easy ones, like Ryan’s usual ‘Wilson from Home Improvement’ one.\n\nWayne: “Mick Jagger, why yo’ lips so ashy?”\n\nColin, muffled through the prop: “WHA’ CAN I TMELLYA, I’M OOOOVER THHEVENTY!”\n\nAnd Wayne and Colin just…crack at that\n\nColin was just yes-anding, but the incomprehensibility of it broke Wayne\n\nAfter another Ryan-Greg one where there’s barely any laughs and Ryan’s not into it:\n\nColin: “At least we don’t have theirs.”\n\nWayne: “RIGHT?”\n\nMaking Ryan’s struggle clear to the entire room. Much like Colin did in 2×24’s Greatest Hits, where Ryan was trying to hide his lack of a song title and Colin just made it CLEAR to the audience [“have I ever told ya how much I looove workin’ with ya?”\n\nRyan, however, goes for the payback:\n\n“NOW YA DO.”\n\nPerfect. Colin blew a hole in the game, so Ryan can do whatever he wants\n\nRyan, smirking: “this’ll REALLY be dangerous, cause I wasn’t watching what you were doing!”\n\nRyan, first, asks Greg if “they [did] ‘hey neighbor'”, which Greg nods yeah. But they have no ideas, and the camera’s idea, so Greg goes for it anyway.\n\nGreg: “HI, NEIGHBOR.”\n\nRyan, holding up the prop: “HEY, TIM!”\n\nRyan manages to follow that with a much better ‘folded cube game’ one with Greg\n\nA WILD Props. There was a game to it, the game of ‘Ryan is struggling and Colin and Wayne are breezing through’, and I love that he actually got to flip the script. Meanwhile, there were some amusing suggestions, but it was really about Ryan’s hard time turning into a breeze once he got actual good props. Basically, US WL’s answer to ‘the chicken toss’ round in the UK.\n\nWhose Line: Dorothy, played by Colin, is traveling with the Tin Man, played by Ryan, along the Yellow Brick Road\n\nRyan begins the scene doing the Scarecrow’s ‘that way/that way’ thing. Colin just shakes his head. “Maybe if you had your heart-on”\n\nAND NOW RYAN KNOWS WHO HE IS. “WHY DO YOU RUB IT IN?”\n\nColin, after Ryan’s first line [‘do I smell cheese?’], tells Ryan that his voice is more Scarecrow-ish, so Ryan realizes he does have a heart, and that he’s really after a brain. Good improv can always save improv mistakes.\n\nColin: “remember what Glinda the good witch said to us, she said ‘that’s one gigantic butt’.”\n\nRyan: “…that’s true.”\n\nColin, figuring it out: “those monkeys, when they flew towards us, that was scary..”\n\nRyan uses a ‘LALALALALA’ to herald the Witch flying overhead\n\nColin, a bit shaken: “boy, she’s changed her theme music”\n\nThis is a clumsy scene so far, but that made me laugh\n\nRyan, smirking: “SHE HAD TO, OTHERWISE SHE HAD TO PAY FOR THE RIGHTS.”\n\nPFFFF. That’s more like it!\n\nColin uses his last line as a pickup line that worked in Kansas: “grease me up, baby, I’m going in”, which feels like a classic WL line.\n\nLook…this one didn’t work for me, and it’s rare that I say that about a game of this. The opening confusion that Ryan had between which character he was set the scene on a rocky ground, and they never really found a good throughline. Colin tried, but Ryan had some faux pas’ here leading the scene, and it just couldn’t get going.\n\nScenes from a Hat:\n\n“Unlikely perfume scents”\n\nRyan: “I’m a man who feels confident when I’m wearing Wet Ass.”\n\nPFF\n\n“If famous TV shows were performed on too much caffeine.”\n\nRyan: “YOU’RE FIRED, YOU’RE FIRED, YOU’RE FIRED…”\n\nMan, that’s an odd one to go out in the midst of his administration…\n\nRyan, just as he’s walking off: “….FUCK IT, YOU’RE FIRED TOO.”\n\nSomehow this is the only one of these that makes air.\n\n“Things that don’t sound right in an angry voice”\n\nWayne: “BITCH, I SAID *KALE*. KALE SALAD. NONSENSE!”\n\nAisha: “ahahaha, that actually really happened…”\n\nGreg: “I now pronounce you MAN AND WIFE. KISS’ER!!!”\n\nRyan, one suggestion later: “I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU MAN AND WIFE. KISS THE BRIDE!”\n\n…..\n\nI love Colin’s move here. Not to say ‘he did that one’. To go “that’s Greg, over there.”\n\nRyan: “You already did it? I wasn’t listening.”\n\nThat is Ryan. “I’m sorry, I wasn’t listening” was his TLV line because he would often say that on the norm. And here he sort of plays into it, which delivers the laugh.\n\nRyan, back at the step: “I’ll tellin’ ya, I don’t listen to SHIT on this show…”\n\nAnd this brings us back to Props. Beautiful moment.\n\nAn alright SFAH. Ryan’s listening trouble was the biggest highlight. Kinda funny that tonight has had so many messups from Ryan.\n\nAisha: “I would give you all points, but I don’t know how many-”\n\nRyan: “I’d help ya out, but I don’t listen to the fuckin’ show…”\n\nParty Quirks: Greg hosts\n\nWayne – Different celebrities being sucked into a black hole\n\nColin – Overzealous pollster conducting a secret survey to find out the studio’s favorite underwear\n\nRyan – Hummingbird looking for food in strange places\n\nGreg: “It’s a 50 Shades of Greg party”\n\nI’m so glad we actually get to see Greg be Greg in some of these guestless shows\n\nWayne’s an old hat at his. He can do a bunch of impressions and he can do ‘being sucked into a black hole’ physicality.\n\nWayne returns to the step, after McConaughey, an easy one, and breaking into another impression, he cracks.\n\nWayne, doing a very bad Christopher Walken: “Your PARTY…it’s GREAT…I…”\n\nALL THREE GO DOWN AT ONCE. JESUS.\n\nGreg: “Yes, poorly developed character?”\n\nGreg won’t even give him the satisfaction\n\nThen, right before he’s sucked into the black hole, Wayne tries to do a Walken, cracks again and gives up. This is so damn amusing.\n\nWayne runs to the door one more time\n\nRyan: “oh, I can’t wait!”\n\nWayne, at that:\n\nThis is so damn funny. Wayne just can’t do impressions, and now Ryan and Colin are just waiting to see what he’s gonna do next.\n\nGreg: “Why do I have a sense of deja vu?”\n\nWayne finally enters, and:\n\nHe’s trying, and failing, at doing a De Niro. The second and Ryan and Colin realize this, they go down again. Too damned funny. And then Wayne very quickly runs to the other side of the stage again.\n\nWayne, not recovered: “…that’s all you get…”\n\nI like Colin’s very goofy, overly cheery character checking everyone’s pants area.\n\nRyan’s is his usual overactive hummingbird stuff, but with some fun beats:\n\nAnd then Colin realizes what he needs to do:\n\nThis is a combination of three classic Colin quirks. Colin putting his hands in people’s pockets, Colin not knowing the difference between men and women, and Colin as a bomb disposal man looking in people’s pants. And it all just works.\n\nWayne, as Britney Spears: “OH BAB-” [gets sucked into Colin’s ass]\n\nColin, confused: “…was that Woody Allen?”\n\nI love that this gag just keeps going\n\nGreg lets everyone sort of interact, without even an inkling.\n\nRyan, finally: “hurry up, my hands are getting tired!”\n\nGreg then just guesses everyone in a 20 second radius, because he can.\n\nGreg, holding up his pitcher: “Ryan stuck his feeder in my water…”\n\nAisha, holding up her mug: “I’d give you this, but everyone’s had their finger in it tonight…”\n\nWayne: “no it hasn’t…” [gets up]\n\nRyan: “who was that?”\n\nWayne: “…that was Jimmy Cagney”\n\nPFFF\n\nA pretty fun PQ, at times evoking the energy of ABC playings, with a very game and fun Greg hosting. Wayne’s struggle made up of a lot of the highlights, but Ryan and Colin’s interaction felt classic\n\nDoo-Wop: Wayne, Ryan and Colin sing about Sarah, who died in a vacuum-related accident\n\nWayne: “I know I told you to keep sucking, but you took it way too far”\n\nRyan:\n\nRyan is having a ROUGH SHOW, man…\n\nThese are some easy puns delivered well. Colin’s first is silly because of the delivery, especially how he lands the punchline: “you were killed by a Hoover…DAMN!”\n\nThe final note is one of those ‘Colin tries to crack up Wayne’ moments, cause it’s just Colin shifting pitch until he’s doing a Goofy-esque long note of ‘WHOOOOOORES’, which Wayne eventually breaks at. Ryan and Wayne are repeating it as they go back. “CHOORES?” “CHYOOOOOOHHOOOORES.”\n\nDammit, this Doo-Wop got to me. It was, like the rest of the show, kinda messy [it reminds me of a very young Joe Pesci], but the zeal, delivery and little moments boosted it, especially that ending.\n\nOverall: For the first time in a while, a true Hot Mess show. My god there was so much that went wrong. Greg just stopped asking Questions, Wayne couldn’t do impressions, games fell apart, and Ryan…poor Ryan. Between Props, Doo Wop, Whose Line and SFAH, Ryan had more improv mistakes than he’d had all year. I don’t know what was going on that night, as he was perfectly loose in Questions, but he forgot his character, couldn’t land a good line in Doo Wop or Props, and copied other people’s jokes in Props and SFAH. Thankfully he played into his faux pas and still came off likable, but I felt so bad for him.\n\nA lot of games here, like Party Quirks, Props and Doo-Wop, succeeded in spite of those snafus. PQ felt like a Drew-era playing, Props was just some wild energy and some actual improv ‘game’ mentality, and Doo-Wop just had some really fun ways of going about an easy subject. But a lot just felt messy, and not always in the most fun ways. It’s watchable, and it’s fun in points, but this show unraveled a bit too much at times.\n\nShow Winners: Wayne and Colin\n\nBest Performer: Wayne Brady. Dude had the most put-together moments all night, and came off like a pro.\n\nWorst Performer: Ryan Stiles. For the first time in so long, I can say that a single performer was obtrusive to several games. I just hate that it was Ryan.\n\nBest Game: Party Quirks, which was the most full game here, and had the biggest laughs out of me, thanks to Wayne and his bad De Niro.\n\nWorst Game: Whose Line almost completely flopped for me. Ryan was really off, and it was throwing off Colin at times.\n\nShould this have aired in S11?: Uhh…I’m not so sure. I think it’s better off in a supplemental season like this one.\n\nCOMING UP NEXT: Back to S13 tapings for the rest of the season. A Jeff taping brings a…somewhat WB synergy guest?\n\nAfter the best episode of the new version so far, we continue that episode’s strategy with a much lower key panel. The only real name here is Ella Henderson, a pop singer who’s had some hits in the last few years. But we have a requisite DJ, Jax Jones, and comedian and Taskmaster alum Mike Wozniak, who WRITES FOR THIS SHOW. So…yeah, lower-key. Don’t worry, we’ve got some big bookings coming later apparently.\n\nGreg, introing tonight: “a DJ and producer who says he carries a mic with him at all times, even when out shopping. His new track, Milk Spillage in Aisle Five, is out next month.”\n\nYeah, that’s a Mark-era joke right there\n\nGreg has some fun with heckles for friend Mike, like “a much older Ned Flanders” or “an expressionless Freddie Mercury”, which Mike just has to grin and bear\n\nGreg mentions that Ella and Jax know each other, they’re from the same village, they’re close friends. Meanwhile, Greg says that he’s known Mike for years, “and I have absolute contempt for you.”\n\nMike: “yeah, and I feel that burning off you everytime we see each other…”\n\nGreg introduces a great runner: “I don’t mind telling you, I’ve uploaded the Magnum P.I. theme, and every time you try to speak, I’m going to play it…”\n\nMike AND Greg love the concept of this\n\nMike: “well, fair enough, thanks for the warning.”\n\nMAGNUM P.I. THEME PLAYS IN\n\nMike: “…there it goes…”\n\nGreg: [wiggles in desk to it]\n\nJamali even says he doesn’t know the theme enough to understand the reference, “but I still go ‘ye-heh-heeeah, man, that’s crazy!”\n\nBIG LAUGH HERE FROM GREG\n\nSorry, No Refunds, an actual vintage game from Mark’s era, returns here. The Morrissey round has some good options:\n\nGreg, explaining B.) “and the subsequent tickling in his throat could DRIIIIVE A MAN TO PRAYYY…that’s my Morrissey impression there.”\n\nNot as good as Tony Christie’s.\n\nDaisy has an anecdote about nearly missing audition because she got caught in a mime act she couldn’t leave.\n\nNoel: “the worst part is two weeks later, you switch on the telly and the mime’s got the part…”\n\nMike: “I have a friend who, if he can’t make something, he goes “I’m sorry, I can’t make it, I’m in France”, which…it’s quite a good technique.”\n\ni don’t know much of Mike’s material, but his underplaying, and sort of blunt deadpanning, works for this show, especially against Greg and Daisy’s howling.\n\nElla talks about playing the NBA All Star Game with a stomach bug, and having to be airlifted to the toilet right before. “My parents facetimed me afterwards, going ‘that was the most emotional performance’, and I’m going ‘YEAH, CAUSE I JUST SHAT M’SELF…”\n\nJamali agrees with Morrissey’s beef with David Attenborough: “all he does is voiceover. And I have to sit there and go ‘oh, he’s amazing’. Like he made the fuckin’ animals, bruv…”\n\nJamali almost threatens to beat up Attenborough in the street, but immediately takes it back. “I forgot what I looked like while I was saying it…”\n\nElla thinks Morrissey would nix a gig for having a cough, “cause he’s quite miserable.”\n\nNoel: “whereas YOU would do gigs right when you’re about to shit yourself.”\n\nNoel is so good at callbacks. He’s very deliberate with when he brings things back up\n\nGreg reveals the answer, which was A, THEN PLAYS IN THE MAGNUM PI THEME AGAIN. Mike sort of bobs around to it. Doing this sort of ‘rope pulling’ dance with Greg. He’s gotta be amused by the whole thing.\n\nGreg interprets Nicki Minaj’s anaconda as about feeding snakes bread. “We actually contacted the ASPCA, and they replied “…the ASPCA is underfunded…”\n\nPFFFF\n\nAnd he adds that it “would be detrimental to the snake’s health. P.S., I think Nicki Minaj is talking about big dicks anyway..”\n\nGreg gets about halfway through the first answer before he has to stop:\n\nAND HE STARTS IT AGAIN. But with the absurdity of it, and increased Daisy giggling, he can’t do it.\n\nSo he goes again. And he gets to the mouth pipe, and cracks again. BECAUSE IT’S REALLY FUNNY. Daisy’s crying, meanwhile. Ella goes “she’s GONE…”\n\nThe rest of the answers:\n\nNoel: “can you remind me of A again, Greg?”\n\nPFFFFF\n\nDaisy erupts again in laughter: “AT LEAST LET ME GO TO THE BLOODY TOILET FIRST…”\n\nElla says she’s never met Nicki\n\nGreg: “no doubt you’ll shit yourself in front of her at some point…”\n\nJax thinks it’s B: “The grass, at festivals, can be treacherous.”\n\nI kinda love how he said that..\n\nAs Jax gets up for Intros, he emits an audible ‘fuuuck’. Which Noel seems to like.\n\nDaisy: “it looks like a geography teacher has met someone from Sesame Street…”\n\nI love this.\n\nMike: “…I heard Sesame Street, and I understood that it was a dig…”\n\nNoel and Mike’s intro for Pompeii is very silly. Mike is just doing the keyboard thing in a very silly ‘ding-ding-ding’ way as Noel does the ‘EEEEE-O, EEEO’ bit.\n\nGreg asks them to do it again, but JUST MIKE’S KEYBOARD BIT. So Mike does the goofy keyboard bit, AND THEN GREG PLAYS THE MAGNUM THEME IN AGAIN. I friggin died…\n\nI also love Mike hearing the playback, with the synthesizer bit, and him cringing realizing it may not have been as pronounced as how he did it.\n\nI also like Mike doing the Picture of You intro, going into full goof in imitating the trumpet player.\n\nI think this show missed a golden opportunity in, once Jamali and Daisy start doing Clocks by Coldplay, not cutting over to Noel, who, as documented, HATES Coldplay.\n\nJax makes up for it, once they play in the real one: “this is boring as fuck…I preferred your version…”\n\nJamali and Daisy’s second intro is barely together, led by Jamali doing a not-very-confident guitar part. They keep shifting into the Pearl and Dean cinema theme by mistake.\n\nGreg: “i don’t know if this’ll help you, but that was fucking shit…”\n\nNoel: “Is it Pearl and Dean?”\n\nGreg: “I mean…YES…”\n\nWe have another round of Mick Hucknall’s photo bomb, because apparently neither Mick nor Ellie Goulding complained to the network. Greg still cracks up as he introduces it.\n\nI do love Ella’s recognition laugh of guessing “it’s…Madonna when she fell at the BRITs…”\n\nDaisy: “is it Mick Hucknall on Mick Hucknall?”\n\nGreg: “ohhh God, DON’T GIVE ME A BONER…”\n\nPFFFF\n\nGreg: “it isn’t Hot Hucknall-on-Hucknall action, I’m afraid…”\n\nJamali: “..Susan Boyle?”\n\nGreg: “…have a real look, just tell me where Susan Boyle is in that picture…”\n\nGreg’s having a great show as host\n\nIt ends up being “Orlando Bloom [&] his horrible gonzo-nosed penis.”, which is just a great written line\n\nOnce again, all the scores are overdubbed, which means a round got cut.\n\nID Parade is an interesting one. The panelists have to order four celebs by their height, including Cleopatra Higgins, ABZ from 5ive, BEN FROM PHATS AND SMALL [making a return], and somehow making his first-ever NMTB appearance, Richard Coles!\n\nGreg: “I know I’m not part of the game, but my gut instinct is that Cleopatra’s already standing up..”\n\nCleopatra, who’s 5’1, says “people think I’m a lot taller onstage, cause the tricks I use are big hair and high heels”\n\nGreg: “same tricks I use…”\n\nDaisy: “I’ve seen Ben in the same shot as Vanessa Feltz, and I know that she’s about the same height as Abz”\n\nGreg: “Just having it confirmed, Vanessa Feltz is 7’3…”\n\nPFF\n\nJamali, who’s new to Ben: “Was you the Phats or the Smalls?”\n\nBen, as charismatic as he was on the original show: “I was the And!”\n\nI find it funny that Ben’s ‘stand up’ music is DARE by Gorillaz [or, as Shaun Ryder says it, DEHHH], considering who’s apparently gonna be on the show in a few episodes according to Daisy [and my is that gonna be a wild one].\n\nJamali: “I bet the Reverend is FUCKIN MASSIVE. I bet he’s like 7 foot, just spreadin’ that word of Jesus…”\n\nGreg: “I know that he starts a lot of his sermons off with ‘Behold, I’m fuckin massive…”\n\nI honestly liked that round. A.), cause you get alums of the old show, like Abz and Ben, and B) cause they can talk and be candid about shit. Ben admitted he wasn’t even sure if he or Richard were taller.\n\nElla, hearing her lyrics in Next Lines: “oh, it’s my song…have I got to finish the sentence?”\n\nIf Phill was on, you’d hear a loud “YES.” or even an “I had no idea this would be a quiz”\n\nJust hearing Greg reciting Megan Thee Stallion lyrics is funny enough\n\nGreg: “Don’t pick up the phone, you know he’s only calling if he’s drunk and alone”\n\nNoel: “…it’s Mick Hucknall?”\n\nThen Jax A.) fails to recognize his own lyrics, then B.) GETS THEM WRONG. WOW.\n\nGreg: “THIS IS FUCKING DREADFUL…”\n\nGreg, summing up the scores: “I don’t know if you [, Daisy] did well or if they just…fucking…”\n\nOverall: Not as good as last week’s, but still with some good energy. I loved the runner with Mike and the Magnum PI theme, and there were several moments, like Greg’s struggle with the Nicki Minaj option, Ella’s anecdote about shitting herself, and some great rounds of Hucknall and Wuthering Heights. This was a great one for Greg and Jamali, there were solid moments from Ella and Mike, and even if the panelists were less of the focus, there was still some nice energy.\n\nBest Regular: Greg, corpsing or no, had the momentum tonight\n\nBest Guest: Mike, whose Intros were super funny.\n\nBest Runner: Magnum PI\n\nCOMING UP NEXT: Another low-key panel, but we actually do get a guest that was a recurring guest on the old version, which is nice.\n\nSeasonal Code: S14E13\n\nProduction Number: 601\n\nCW Seasonal Code: S14E08\n\nSeason 14 of Whose Line was the first one that aired as I had already started my UK Watchdown. So I spent this season giving best performer grades and show ratings like I would the UK show. This episode, 14×13, was the first one this season that I gave a 10/10 to. And I think you’ll see why once we get into this.\n\nThis is a holdover from S11, coming from the same Jeff taping as the Adelaide Kane and Lolo Jones shows. But this one blows ’em both out of the water.\n\nSo as the opening begins, Ryan is already up to something:\n\nRyan ends up running in just in time for his name. No goofy props, sadly\n\nLet’s Make a Date: Jeff must choose from:\n\nWayne – All-action lifeguard who thinks people are in trouble and need CPR\n\nColin – Gung-ho cave explorer who keeps getting stuck in increasingly tight holes\n\nRyan – Horny grizzly bear who’s just woken from hibernation\n\nImmediate reactions: Colin just facepalms. Ryan shakes his head and cracks up a bit.\n\nJeff: “Bachelor #1, I’ve never had a boyfriend, because I have a rare skin disorder that makes me smell like dried dog food.”\n\nAisha, immediately: “Oh god!”\n\nNormally that’s just a throwaway line, but that gets a big response\n\nWayne’s is pretty basic, pulling a guy out of the audience and paddling him back towards the stage. Aisha starts laughing at this. Eventually, instead of continuing to give the guy CPR, Wayne just starts drumming on his belly. It’s a very goofy quirk.\n\nColin’s is fully physical:\n\nYou can just hear little noises of discomfort coming from Colin.\n\nColin: “I MAY BE HERE FOR A WHILE, YA MIGHT WANNA GO ON…”\n\nRyan’s horny bear physicality, doing this little wiggle that’s sort of a baby thrust, is already funny enough, as are his amused bear noises. You can hear him crack up a little, too.\n\nRyan eventually starts humping the piano\n\nJeff: “…seems like a dream date to me..”\n\nJeff is really impressing me this playing. As Wayne goes “I’ll be right back” to care for someone else, you hear Jeff amusedly reply “what, again?”\n\nWayne comes over to Aisha’s desk, does a little ‘hee-hee-hee’, then goes, back in character, “she’s alright. It was a buoy, I was mistaken…”\n\nJeff: “were you making a buoy call?”\n\nHE’S ON A ROLL\n\nJeff: “what’s the most dangerous thing you’ve ever done in the sack.”\n\nColin: “……interesting you should ask that, given what I have to do..”\n\nPFFFF\n\nSo here we get what I still think is a GENIUS cutaway. Cause Colin goes for his next feat:\n\nAnd as he goes in, we cut away [to later in the LMAD], but this being the next thing we see is still excellent:\n\nI love this. Just…the most abrupt cutaway. Ryan’s already confusing a bearded guy. It may be an editing trick to shorten the game, but it still works for me. Also, SANTA MADE IT TO THE TAPING!\n\nWE CUT BACK:\n\nThe editing kinda makes this, I have to say\n\nJeff gets the first two, and cracks up getting to Ryan. “I’ll be damned if you’re not a grizzly bear in heat.”\n\nRyan:\n\nAisha: “Points to Ryan for risking his life, and possibly a hip, crawling under this table.”\n\nRyan, confused: “…that’s Colin.”\n\nAisha: “Oh that’s Colin…”\n\nRyan: “I can understand how you got a little flustered…”\n\nAisha: “..ahhh, one of the old white guys crawled under the table.”\n\nThat’s the best way of getting around that snafu. That’s why Aisha is a stronger host, with more status, than Drew.\n\nWayne: “If I had a dollar…”\n\nAisha, noticing what I noticed: “not only is Grizzly Adams in the audience, but so is Santa.”\n\nI think I liked last episode’s LMAD better, but this one is still strong, with good stuff for all 3. The editing of the last bit worked comedically, but from an improv standpoint I could have used a little more.\n\nIrish Drinking Song: Food Poisoning\n\nThis was the first IDS in two seasons, and also a crowd favorite of man"
