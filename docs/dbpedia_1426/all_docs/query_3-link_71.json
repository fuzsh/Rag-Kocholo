        "text": "As he recovers in a Berkshire, England, hospital, Ozzy Osbourne had some cheering news yesterday (Dec. 14) when “Changes,” his duet with daughter Kelly, debuted at No. 1 on the U.K. singles chart. Last week, Ozzy crashed an ATV on his Buckinghamshire estate and broke his collarbone, six ribs and a vertebra in his neck.\n\nThe Osbournes’ Sanctuary single replaced Will Young’s “Leave Right Now” (S/BMG), which had been on top for two weeks. Young also lost the top spot on the U.K. album chart as his “Friday’s Child” ousted by the return of Dido’s “Life for Rent” (Cheeky/Arista) to No. 1.\n\nNext week’s singles chart is the all-important survey that will crown the U.K.’s coveted Christmas No. 1. Bookmakers have improved the odds from 66-1 to 14-1 for the Osbournes’ single to hit No. 1. But favored to take the title is a remake of John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s “Happy Xmas (War Is Over)” by the Idols (S/BMG), the finalists on this year’s “Pop Idol” series, which has odds of 1-3.\n\nAnother contender for that honor, all-time British singles chart champion Cliff Richard, debuted at No. 5 with his EMI single “Santa’s List,” his 65th top-10 hit over a 45-year period. His “Cliff at Christmas” album also climbed 10-9.\n\nOther new top-10 singles were “My Immortal” by Evanescence (Epic) at No. 7, Christina Aguilera’s “The Voice Within” (RCA) at No. 9 and the Cheeky Girls’ novelty seasonal entry “Have a Cheeky Christmas” (Multiply) at No. 10. Just missing was a new mix of “Love Profusion” from Madonna’s Maverick/Warner Bros album “American Life,” which could only muster a No. 11 debut.\n\nNelly Furtado’s “Powerless (Say What You Want)” (DreamWorks) entered at No. 13, U.K. hip-hop/R&B troupe Big Brovaz’ “Ain’t What You Do” (Epic) at No. 15 and Alicia Keys’ “You Don’t Know My Name” (J) at No. 19. Further down the chart, there was a No. 33 entry for the reissued, original “Happy Xmas (War Is Over)” by John & Yoko & the Plastic Ono Band, marking the song’s fourth run in the British top-40 since it first charted in 1972.\n\nMeanwhile, on the U.K. album chart, there was a 7-4 climb for R.E.M.’s “In Time” compilation (Warner Bros.) and 8-5 for Black Eyed Peas’ “Elephunk” (A&M). The Peas also race 21-1 on the Eurochart Hot 100 Singles tally, the composite chart from all the major European sales surveys, with “Shut Up.” The Dido album leads the European Top 100 Albums list for a 10th week."
