The Lexus is green â€“ money-green, J-Rock calls it. Later, his bandmate Dion (who is saving, not spending) asks me what I think of J-Rock's Lexus, then tells me what she thinks of it, which is not much. A Lexus! And not even a big Lexus. And that green! Ugly. Personally, I think it is a very nice car and I can see that J-Rock thinks the world"
