        "text": "The group comprises two vocalists, Cherise Roberts and Nadia Shepherd, both of whom were in the original line-up of the hip-hop and R&B group Big Brovaz. To date, they have released one silver-certified studio solo album as a duo and have had five top twenty hits in the United Kingdom. They have also achieved international success, gaining hits in Ireland, Poland, The Netherlands and Germany. Roberts and Shepherd both began their career in the R&B and hip hop group Big Brovaz, who had considerable success following their launch in 2002.\n\nRoberts was an established singer before the group's success, recording a solo album – “Look Inside” and single \"2nd Best\". The album was highly praised and won a MOBO Award. Booty Luv was created during early recordings of Re-Entry, when music executives offered Roberts and Shepherd the chance to record and promote a new version of R&B singer Tweet's club hit \"Boogie 2nite\" in the form of a normal version and a DJ remix version.\n\nBooty Luv's version of \"Boogie 2nite\" was decided to be released as a single in the United Kingdom and mainland Europe following positive reviews from club DJs on the dance scene. The duo decided to take a hiatus in 2009 to concentrate on solo projects after the release of their single \"Say It\", which was meant to be taken as the lead single from their second studio album.\n\nIn late 2011, following a two-year break, the duo announced they had changed their name to \"Cherise & Nadia\" and went on a mini-tour in Australia to promote material from their debut album. In October 2011, the duo released their first promotional single \"This Night\". In November 2012, the duo changed their name back to Booty Luv and announced that they would be releasing their comeback single \"Black Widow\" on 3 February 2013. Since then, the group have continued to enjoy success on the music scene."
