        "text": "After a bit of research:\n\nCherise Roberts and Nadia Sheppard are now working on music with their other venture \"Booty Luv\". The status \"working on new material\" has been in place since 2011 so when it does finally come out we can expect The White Album or Avatar quality.\n\nProducer and DJ JJC which is short for Abdul Rasheed Bello is now a photography equipment company.\n\nAfter four successful years in the band J-Rock has gone on to be an Asian genre of music.\n\nFrom a 2010 interview Randy says: \"I am in my living room, and around me I can see a big TV, my computer and my girlfriend life is going well. I’ve been good, we got a new project me and J-Rock from the group we now go by the name of Party Dark. We had a number 1 MTV hit the other day and now we’re preparing for our second single.\"\n\nSo keep an eye out for Booty Luv and Party Dark. Both of whom have been working hard on their album for the last 5 years. Hotly anticipated I'm sure."
