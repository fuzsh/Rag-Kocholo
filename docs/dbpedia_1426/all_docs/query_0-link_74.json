        "text": "Arizona Amp and Alternator - Arizona Amp and Alternator (Thrill Jockey) Tucson based musical genius Howe Gelb is best known as the brainchild behind the long running, totally amorphous musical conglomerate Giant Sand. For this album, the prolific Gelb has enlisted the services of friends like M. Ward, Scout Nibblet as well as various members of Grandaddy and Arcade Fire.\n\nDandy Warhols - Odditorium or Warlords of Mars (Capitol)\n\nPortland based post-modern psychedelic pop combo The Dandy Warhols return with their fifth full-length effort since their recorded debut back in 1995. This time around they have derived the name of the album from their somewhat legendary recording studio coupled with might be an obvious nod to the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs.\n\nDJ Quik - Trauma (Mad Science)\n\nWest Coast funkateer Quik returns after a three year hiatus with his seventh effort. This time around he's joined by a wide range of superstar guest ranging from Atlanta kingpin Ludacris, St. Louis baller Chingy, New York's Wyclef Jean, R&B crooner Jodeci, and fellow West Coasters the Game and B-Real.\n\nTim Fite - Gone Ain't Gone (Epitaph)\n\nAs legend would have it, Tim Fite resides in Brooklyn surrounded by a graveyard of bargin bin CDs and other sonic detritus. What type of music lurks on the dead spheres of plastic littering his habitat is a mystery to any but Fite, but the wares are obviously diverse. This summation is based soley on his debut album, which mixes rag-tag indie folk idioms with an ever-so-slight beat oriented rap fixation, albeit one filtererd through the stripped down aesthetics of a street corner busker.\n\nGo Betty Go - Nothing Is More (SideOneDummy)\n\nThis southern California all-girl punk outfit previously released the EP Worst Enemy and made in-roads into the videogame cult fanbase by delivering the Invisible Woman theme song for the Fantastic Four game from Activision. This time around Betty Cisneros,Nicolette Vilar, Aixa Vilar, and Michelle Rangel deliver a full-fledged full-length effort that contains no less than 12 new ditties for the kiddies.\n\nHorrorpops - Bring It on! (Epitaph)\n\nProduced by Bad Religion's own Brett Gurewitz, the Danish punk combo The Horrorpops continue to kick out the jams psychobilly style, with a little bit of demented go-go dancer ambiance tossed in for good measure. This, their sophomore effort, delivers a baker's dozen (that would be 13, an appropriate number considering the band's horror film fetish) of ribald tunes with titles like \"Walk Like A Zombie\" and \"Freaks In Uniforms.\"\n\nInstitute - Distort Yourself (Interscope)\n\nEx-Bush frontman obviously wasn't content being a stay-at-home husband, watching wife Gwen Stefani soak up the limelight with her own successful solo career. So, instead of moping around the house, he went out and formed himself a new group, dubbed Institute. Produced by Helmet's mastermind Page Hamilton, this \"supergroup\" consists of guitarist Chris Traynor, bassist Cache Tolman, and drummer Charlie Walker. Their self-titled debut album is simultaneously being released in regular and DualDisc formats.\n\nIron and Wine/Calexico - In the Reins EP(Touch and Go)\n\nThis collaborative effort dates back almost three years when Iron and Wine mastermind Sam Beam decided that he wanted to record a full-length album with his pals Calexico, specifically Joey Burns and John Convertino. As is often the case in such ventures, it never came to fruition, that is until December 2004. This EP is the result of those sessions, Beam being backed by the entire Calexico outfit.\n\nLake Trout - Not Them, You (Palm Pictures)\n\nComprised of 15 tracks of new music, plus one glorious cover (the band does The Rolling Stones \"Street Fighting Man\" serious justice), Baltimore's favorite neo-jam band return with their third studio effort. Stepping away from what one might think of as jam oriented music, the band persists in creating extended, often lush pop structures that flitter beyond the normal scope of what one would consider to be contemporary sugar coated sonic confectionary.\n\nLittle Brother - The Minstrel Show (Atlantic)\n\nStraight outta Durham, North Carolina comes Little Brother. Their third full-length seems to follow in the footsteps of their previous release, The Chittlin' Circuit 1.5, at least in terms of titular inspiration, albeit taking a somewhat more sociological/political slant. One can only surmise that the lyrical content of the album will follow suit, examining how rap has become the new minstrel show of the post-millenial pop music world.\n\nDamian \"Jr. Gong\" Marley - Welcome to Jamrock (Universal Motown)\n\nBob Marley's youngest offspring keeps it in the family by working closely with brother Stephen Marley on this album (Stephen supplying the bulk of the musical production). The title track is already a monster hit, both in the clubs, on the airwaves, and across the Internet. The rest of the album bounces between all the recognizable Jamaican genres, ranging from fist pumping dancehall to introspective slow jams. Along for the ride are the Roots' Black Thought, Nas, and Bobby Brown.\n\nPaul McCartney - Chaos and Creation in the Back Yard (Capitol)\n\nWhat really needs to be said about Sir Paul? He's one of only two remaining Beatles (rhythmic buddy Ringo being the other) and continues to be pretty damn prolific. With this release McCartney effectively becomes a one-man band, having played everything here, from the guitars and keyboards down to the bass and drums. Along for the ride, so to speak, is producer Nigel Godrich (best known for having worked on Radiohead's OK Computer and Beck's Mutations).\n\nOpeth - Ghost Reveries (Roadrunner)\n\nMikael ¿kerfeldt, Per Wiberg, Martin Lopez, Peter Lindgren, and Martin Mendez, collectively known as the Stockholm, Sweden prog-metal outfit Opeth, deliver their eighth album as members of the metal friendly Roadrunner Records family. The appropriately titled Ghost Reveries continues the band's patented exploration of richly theatrical acoustic music, swirling mists of progressive extrapolation, and of course scream therapy death metal accoutrements.\n\nPussyCat Dolls - PCD (A&M/Interscope)\n\nFounded in 1995, this Los Angeles based burlesque troop have now graduated to being more or less a full-fledged musical outfit. Granted the outfit has earned more press for the famous women who have become honorary PCD (Pamela Anderson, Christina Aguilera, Kelly Osbourne, Pink, Britney Spears, Carmen Electra, Gwen Stefani) than for their actual musical skills. At any rate their first single from this album featured Busta Rhymes.\n\nSigur R¿s - Takk... (Geffen)\n\nFor their fourth full-length, Icelandic outfit Sigur Ross maintain their atmospheric poise, bumping up the energy levels a tad to create more of an upbeat sense of somnambulistic bliss. Like the images their frosty homeland conjures up, the band's music is ethereal without being heady, crisp and clean and ultimately devoid of any impurities. Imagine Brian Eno raised in Scandinavia on a steady diet of Low, and you're somewhere not quite in the ballpark.\n\nSmif N Wesson (aka Cocoa Brovaz) - Reloaded (Duck Down)\n\nTek and Steele, known collectively as Smif N Wessun, were forced to change their name by the powerful gun manufacturer back in the late '90s and served time under the moniker The Cocoa Brovaz. Apparantly they don't give a damn and have now resurrected the infamous SnW name yet again for this, their third official full-length. As can be expected, several of their Duck Down/Bucktown/Boot Camp Clik cohorts are on board, as well as Talib Kweli, dead prez, Roc Raida and others.\n\nStellastarr* - Harmonies for the Haunted (RCA)\n\nManhattan neo-art rock quartet (Amanda Tannen, Shawn Christensen, Arthur Kreme, Michael Jurin) stellastarr* return with their sophomore major label release, following on the heels of their 2003 self-title debut. The 10 songs on the album range in title from \"Damn This Foolish Heart\" to \"Sweet Troubled Soul\" and \"Love And Longing.\"\n\nSuper Furry Animals - Love Kraft (XL Recordings)\n\nProduced by Mario Caldato, Jr. and featuring string arrangements by the High Llamas' Sean O'Hagan, the new Super Furry Animals effort is teeming with epic songs like \"Atomik Lust,\" \"Lazer Beam,\" \"Psyclone!,\" and \"Cloudberries.\" The overall vibe of the album is classic SFA, which means that it's steeped in heavy dose of pos-modern psychedelic pop theatrics ranging from the chiming shimmer of \"Zoom\" to the sweet vocal harmony and clanky harmonica kitsch of \"The Horn\" all the way down to the ping-pong bounce of \"Oi Frango.\"\n\nSwitchfoot - Nothing Is Sound (Columbia)\n\nSan Diego surfers cum Christian rockers Switchfoot unveil their fifth full-length and second major label effort with this album. The album follows in the footsteps of their successful major label debut, 2003's The Beautiful Letdown and features 12 songs with titles including \"Happy Is A Yuppie Word,\" \"Shadow Proves The Sunshine,\" \"Lonely Nation,\" \"Politicians,\" and \"Fatal Wound.\"\n\nThumbsucker(Hollywood)\n\nPolyphonic Spree bandleader Tim DeLaughter wrote the music for Mike Mill's quirky independent comedy/drama. The album also includes three unreleased songs by the late Elliott Smith, one original song and two covers, one of Big Star's \"Thirteen\" and another of Cat Stevens' \"Trouble.\"\n\nTrapt - Someone in Control (Warner Bros.)\n\nProducer Don Gilmore (who has worked with the likes of Linkin Park, Pearl Jam, and Good Charlotte) aids the Los Gatos, California combo on their sophomore album. High school chums Chris Brown and Peter Charell, guitarist Simon Ormandy, and Aaron Montgomery continue to deliver hard rock encrusted pop ditties that dwell somewhere between the sidelines of the slowly fading Nu Rock movement.\n\nAnd The Rest…\n\nA Dozen Furies - A Concept from Fire (Sanctuary)\n\nJon Philip Alman - When You Get Home (LML Music)\n\nAmerican Werewolves - 1968 (Fractured Transmitter)\n\nShawn Amos - Thank You Shirl-ee May (A Love Story) (Shout!
