        "text": "50 Cent\n\nGoing from the brink of death to the executive suite is a rare transition, but one 50 Cent made seem effortless. Born and raised in South Jamaica, Queens, 50, born Curtis Jackson, began rapping as a teen before running afoul of the law. After serving time at a boot camp for drug possession, Fif returned to the streets, eager to make a soft landing in the music business. Coming under the mentorship of Run D.M.C. member Jam Master Jay during the mid ’90s, Fif learned the ins and outs of songwriting during his tenure working with the legendary DJ’s imprint JMJ Records.\n\nReleasing his first single “The Glow / The Hit” on JMJ, the rapper eventually left the label, signing on with production duo Trackmasters through Columbia Records. Building a buzz with his controversial single “How to Rob,” Fif recorded his intended debut album Power of the Dollar, but was dropped from the label in 2000 shortly after being shot multiple times during an ambush attack in Queens.\n\nRecovering from his wounds, the rapper teamed up with manager and executive Sha Money XL and hit the studio with a vengeance, flooding the mixtape circuit with freestyles and loose songs the following year. Releasing his mixtape Guess Who’s Back? in 2002, Fif introduced his group G-Unit featuring rappers and fellow Southside natives Tony Yayo and Lloyd Banks on his breakout mixtape 50 Cent Is the Future. Quickly becoming the hottest unsigned artist and crew in New York, 50 and G-Unit’s stock peaked with the release of their No Mercy, No Fear and God’s Plan mixtapes later that year. Securing a $1 million record deal with Shady Records through Aftermath Entertainment, 50 Cent released his debut album Get Rich or Die Tryin’ in February 2003.\n\nDebuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, the album sold 872,000 copies in its first four days, among the biggest first-week sales returns in the history of music. Producing multiple chart-topping singles, Get Rich or Die Tryin’ sold nine million copies in the U.S. and remains his best-selling album. Founding G-Unit Records through Interscope, 50 signed Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, and Tennessee rapper Young Buck to the label, releasing G-Unit’s debut album Beg for Mercy in November 2003. The album, which saw Young Buck filling in for an incarcerated Tony Yayo, also debuted at No. 1 on Billboard and was certified quadruple platinum.\n\n2004 saw Fif and G-Unit place their focus on Lloyd Banks and Young Buck’s solo debuts, both of which arrived that summer. In late July, Lloyd Banks’ The Hunger for More hit the charts at No. 1 with nearly half a million copies sold in its first week and was certified Platinum. Less than a month later, Young Buck’s Straight Outta Cashville opened at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 with 261,000 copies sold and was also certified Platinum. West Coast rapper The Game was added as a member of G-Unit, an acquisition that proved profitable for Fif, as the Aftermath signee’s debut album The Documentary skyrocketed to the top of the charts, with 586,000 units in its first week on its way to double Platinum status.\n\nHowever, he would be jettisoned from the label months later amid internal friction between he, Fif and other G-Unit members. More than a year removed from the release of his debut, Fif returned in March 2005 with The Massacre, which set a record for the most copies sold in an abbreviated sales cycle with 1.14 million copies sold in four days. Shortly after the album’s release, he became the first solo artist of any genre to have three songs chart in the Top 5 of the Billboard Hot 100 simultaneously.\n\nThe Massacre would sell six million units in the U.S., placing him among the greatest selling Hip-Hop artists of all-time in two years. Later that year, G-Unit Records released the soundtrack to Get Rich or Die Tryin’, the 2005 film loosely based on his life, selling 320,000 copies in the first week and receiving Platinum certification.\n\nHaving been released from prison following multiple arrests during the height of G-Unit’s fame, Yayo was the last of the label’s core artists to drop an album, with Thoughts of a Predicate Felon debuting at No. 2 on the album chart and yielding a Gold plaque. Looking to expand the roster during the latter half of the ’00s, Fif recruited the likes of Ma$e, Lil Scrappy, Freeway, and others to join the label, with varying results. He also signed M.O.P., Spider Loc, 40 Glocc and Young Hot Rod in an attempt to capitalize on their potential fanfare.\n\nThe next few years saw Lloyd Banks and Young Buck each release their sophomore albums, with Banks’ Rotten Apple arriving in 2006, and Buck’s Buck the World coming the year after. In September 2007, 50 released his third studio album Curtis, which lost a publicized sales battle with Kanye West, but moved just short of 700,000 copies in its opening week. The album, which surpassed one million units sold by year’s end, marked the rapper’s third consecutive Platinum plaque and the label’s eighth overall. Over the following decade, Fif and the label released albums from G-Unit, Lloyd Banks, and himself before disbanding in 2018 as a group. G-Unit Records remains active, but with 50 Cent as the lone known artist currently on the label.\n\nBirdman & Lil Wayne\n\nFounding Cash Money Records in 1991, brothers Bryan “Birdman” Williams and.Ronald “Slim” Williams helped stamp New Orleans as one of rap’s hottest locales. In its fledgling years, Cash Money housed homegrown artists Kilo G, U.N.L.V., Ms Tee, Lil’ Slim, and Pimp Daddy, all of whom built a regional profile for the label with successful independent releases.\n\nDuring the mid-’90s, Cash Money began to reshape its roster around a core that included bounce sensation Juvenile, B.G., Lil Wayne,Turk, and Big Tymers gearing up for a historic run that shook up the rap game. Albums from U.N.L.V. (Uptown 4 Life), B.G. (Chopper City, It’s All On U, Vol 1 & 2), Juvenile (Solja Rags), and Big Tymers (How You Luv That Vol. 1), and the Hot Boyz (Get It How U Live!) all surpassed one hundred thousands of copies sold, putting Birdman and Slim in position to demand a lucrative offer from a major distributor for their services.\n\nSigning a three-year, $30 million distribution deal with Universal Records in March 1998, the Williams brothers (with the help of Wendy Day) brokered an agreement under which they retained 85% of all profits, as well as 50% of their publishing royalties and ownership of their master recordings. The deal proved to be mutually beneficial for both parties, as the label’s first wave of major label releases were all Platinum-certified, as well as their sophomore group album Guerilla Warfare. The early ’00s continued the label’s good fortune, as its artists accounted for over seven million albums sold within a two year span. However, Juvenile and B.G.’s exit from Cash Money left Birdman and Slim without their two biggest solo stars, casting doubt on whether the remaining artists would be able to rise to the occasion.\n\nLil Wayne would silence any whispers of a pending downfall with his monstrous mixtape run and his Tha Carter series racking up nearly 20 million albums sold alone. Not one to rest on his laurels, Birdman, who had tasted success as a rapper as one-half of the Big Tymers, also stepped up to the occasion. In 2002, he teamed back up with Mannie Fresh to unleash their Platinum-certified album Hood Rich, while also dropping Gold-certified solo debut later in the year. He also joined Lil Wayne on the collaborative album Like Father, Like Son, and would release several solo efforts during the decade.\n\nWith the launch of Lil Wayne’s Young Money imprint, the Cash Money dynasty was extended into the ’10s, as Drake and Nicki Minaj became two of the biggest stars not only in Hip-Hop, but all of music. The pair have done it all, from dropping chart-topping, record breaking albums and singles to becoming young moguls in their own right. Having surpassed one billion units sold more than a half decade ago, Birdman, Slim and Cash Money are among the biggest bosses in the game, with a resume that proves they can never be counted out.\n\nBuckshot\n\nWhen many New York rap acts and record labels altered their approach in the pursuit of commercial success, Duck Down Music founders Kenyatta “Buckshot” Blake and Drew “Dru-Ha” Friedman stayed true to the sound of the city. A member of the rap crew Black Moon, Buckshot and groupmates 5ft and DJ Evil Dee debuted in 1992 with their independently released hit single “Who Got Da Props,” which climbed to No. 86 on the Billboard Hot 100. Signing with Nervous Records, the trio released their debut studio album Enta Da Stage in 1993, which sold just short of a half million copies in the U.S. and was acclaimed as an instant classic.\n\nBuckshot teamed up with Nervous Records intern Drew “Dru-Ha” Friedman, forming Duck Down Management in 1994, which brokered fellow Brooklyn rappers Smif-N-Wessun’s deal with Nervous Records sub-label Wreck Records that same year. After releasing their own debut single “Bucktown” in 1994, Tek and Steele dropped their debut album Dah Shinin’ the following year, their initial success surpassing that of even Black Moon. The album debuted at No. 5 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, produced the hit single “Sound Bwoy Bureill,” and featured the first song featuring Duck Down’s Boot Camp Clik in its entirety.\n\nDue to a legal dispute with Nervous Records, Black Moon refused to submit their sophomore album, leading to the group being dropped from the label. That same year, Buckshot and Dru Ha expanded Duck Down into a record label, signing on Heltah Skeltah and O.G.C. as its first acts. Entering a distribution deal with Priority Records, Duck Down released Heltah Skeltah’s debut album Nocturnal, and O.G.C.’s Da Storm in 1996, which producing classic cuts such as the Fab Five posse cut “Leflaur Leflah Eshkoshka” and the controversial single “No Fear.” The latter half of the ’90s saw Duck Down releasing a succession of albums, with Smif-N-Wessun rebranding as the Cocoa Brovaz, Black Moon unveiling their long-awaited sophomore album War Zone, and Buckshot’s anticipated solo debut The BDI Thug. With the entirety of Boot Camp Clik now under the Duck Down umbrella, Buckshot and Dru-Ha set out to increase the label’s market share.\n\nThe first move was a distribution partnership with Navarre Corporation for their physical products, under which the label retained its digital distribution rights, setting up a separate deal with iTunes and diversifying their earnings. The latter half of the ’00s would mark the peak of Duck Down’s success, with Heltah Skeltah member Ruck rechristening himself as Sean Price and releasing his solo debut Monkey Barz in 2005. That same year, Buckshot teamed up with 9th Wonder for the collaborative album Chemistry, while Smif-N-Wessun completed the “Triple Threat” trifecta with Reloaded, all albums that made Duck Down a favorite for lovers of their traditional brand of Hip-Hop.\n\nInking a distribution deal with Koch Records (now E1 Music) in 2007, Duck Down has since spent the past 15 years releasing albums from KRS-One, B-Real of Cypress Hill, 9th Wonder, Statik Selektah, Pharoahe Monch, Black Rob, The Away Team, Random Axe, Marco Polo, Ruste Juxx, Torae, Special Teamz, and Kidz in the Hall. To date, the label has released over 50 studio albums and has amassed millions in worldwide sales.\n\nDiddy\n\nSean “Diddy” Combs’ rise up the not only the music industry, but the business ladder is one that’s beholden with awe. Beginning his career as an intern at Uptown Records while attending Howard University, Combs eventually dropped out to fully focus on building his career during the late ’80s, going from performing menial tasks to helping guide and mold the careers of some of the label’s biggest stars. As the New Jack Swing era Uptown played a major role in ushering in began to taper off, Combs helped spearhead a new sub-genre that would become known as Hip-Hop Soul, with R&B acts such as Jodeci and Mary J. Blige adopting a sound and look that straddled the lines between romance and the streets.\n\nWith both acts reaching multi-Platinum success under Combs’ leadership, he was appointed the role of top A&R executive at Uptown, with one of his first signings being The Notorious B.I.G. While Biggie’s debut single “Party & Bullshit” was released through Uptown, Combs’ was let go from the company in 1993, with the rapper following him to his new imprint, Bad Boy Records. Signing a joint-venture deal with Arista Records, Diddy and Bad Boy’s first release was Craig Mack’s single “Flava in Ya Ear, which peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified Platinum, instantly announcing the label’s arrival. Spawning a star-studded remix featuring The Notorious B.I.G., Busta Rhymes, LL Cool J, and Rampage, the track received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance and helped power Mack’s debut album Project Funk da World to Gold status in September 1994.\n\nThat same month, Bad Boy released The Notorious B.I.G.’s debut album Ready to Die, which surpassed two million in sales and minted him as New York’s biggest rap star. Having begun his journey in music grooming R&B artists, Bad Boy also excelled in that department, also earning Platinum hardware for self-titled albums by Faith Evans, Total, and 112. Regarded as the top record label on the East Coast at the time, Bad Boy’s streak was interrupted by tragedy with the death of The Notorious B.I.G. in 1997. Weeks after his passing, the rapper’s sophomore album Life After Death was released posthumously and was a seismic success, debuting atop the Billboard 200 and selling over ten million units in the U.S. alone. Diddy, who had released his chart-topping debut single “Can’t Nobody Hold Me Down” earlier that year, unleashed his debut album No Way Out in July 1997.\n\nThe album, which included contributions from Bad Boy artists Ma$e, The LOX, Black Rob, Carl Thomas, as well as affiliates like JAY-Z, Lil’ Kim, Foxy Brown and Busta Rhymes, cemented Diddy as a megastar, topping the Billboard album chart on the way to selling several million copies in the U.S. Later that year, Bad Boy extended its dynastic run, releasing Ma$e’s quadruple-Platinum debut Harlem World, completing one of the most dominant calendar years for a record label in Hip-Hop history. Releasing Platinum efforts from The LOX, Black Rob,112, Faith Evans, Shyne, The Notorious B.I.G. and Diddy during the late ’90s and early ’00s, at its peak Bad Boy was reportedly worth $100 million. Bad Boy’s sustenance made Combs an industry darling, with Forbes reporting that the impresario personally raked in over $50 million in 1998 alone.\n\nBad Boy departed from Arista in 2002, retaining his ownership of the label’s catalog, as well as its recording roster at the time, and later signed a distribution deal with The Universal Music Group, with Combs keeping complete ownership of the company. The next decade would find Bad Boy introducing acts like G Dep, Da Band, Boyz N Da Hood, Cassie, Danity Kane, Yung Joc, and more, as well as releasing Gold and Platinum studio albums himself during that period. Bouncing from Warner Music Group to Interscope and Geffen, Bad Boy has continued to add to its legacy over the past decade, with hitmakers like Machine Gun Kelly, French Montana, as well newcomer Jozzy, all making waves\n\nDr. Dre\n\nDr. Dre is often touted for his production prowess and coaxing inspiring performances out of the artists he works with, so much that his achievements as mogul can go understated. Beginning his career as a member of N.W.A., Dr. Dre and crew helped break down barriers for West Coast Hip-Hop with their debut album Straight Outta Compton, which was certified triple Platinum and has been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and enshrined in the Library of Congress’ National Recording Registry.\n\nDropping two more Platinum releases in their 1990 EP 100 Miles and Runnin’ and 1991 sophomore album Niggaz4Life, the latter becoming the first rap album to top the Billboard 200, N.W.A. sold over 10 million units in the U.S. alone, with Dre either appearing on or producing the group and label’s biggest hits. Despite being a key contributor on the musical side, Dre sought out to follow in the steps of Eazy-E and become an executive himself, co-founding Death Row Records alongside Suge Knight. In 1992, Dre released his first and only solo album with the label, The Chronic, which was certified triple Platinum and produced hits like the Grammy Award winning single “Let Me Ride.”\n\nHaving achieved both group and solo success and served as the sonic architect of two musical empires, Dre proved that three times is indeed the charm, departing from Death Row in 1996 and launching Aftermath Entertainment that same year. Distributed through Interscope Records, Aftermath produced two Platinum-selling albums out the gate in Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath and The Firm’s The Album, but paled in comparison to Dre’s previous success at Death Row. However, by the late ’90s, the label had found its flagship artist in Detroit rapper Eminem, who’s 1999 album The Slim Shady LP brought the label back to prominence.\n\nHe has since become one of the best-selling musical acts of all-time with over 220 million worldwide sales, as well as one of its most decorated, with 15 Grammy Awards and 10 No. 1 albums. Other landmark signings that proved to be windfalls for Aftermath included 50 Cent, who’s 2003 debut Get Rich or Die Tryin’ earned Diamond certification, and The Game, who’s 2005 release The Documentary sold over two million copies domestically. In the past decade, acts like Kendrick Lamar and Anderson .Paak have kept Aftermath Records a formidable force in the game, further bolstering Dre’s track record of identifying and producing megastars.\n\nJermaine Dupri\n\nFounding So So Def in 1993, Jermaine Dupri utilized his experiences growing up around the music industry to become one of its most decorated CEOs of the past three decades. After discovering rap group Kriss Kross and producing their multi-Platinum 1992 debut Totally Krossed Out, Dupri inked a joint venture deal with Sony and Columbia, signing Platinum-selling acts Xscape and Da Brat. The first female rap soloist to have an album surpass one million units sold, Da Brat achieved that feat with her 1994 debut Funkdafied, which served as a testament to Dupri and the label’s staying power.\n\nIn addition to releasing albums from Ghost Town DJs, pioneering rap group Whodini, and other acts, Dupri spent the mid-’90s using his production prowess to craft hits for Mariah Carey, Usher, Monica, Lil’ Kim, Dru Hill, MC Lyte, The Braxtons, and numerous other acts, establishing himself as a jack of all trades and a trusted hitmaker. In 1998, Dupri fully tapped into his talents as a songwriter and boardsman on his own debut album Life In 1472, which was certified Platinum, peaked atop Billboard’s Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rap Album.\n\nBy the new millenium, So So Def had become a household name, with Da Brat, Jagged Edge, Xscape and Dupri himself amassing several Platinum and Gold plaques in the process. The turn of the century marked the introduction of Dupri’s next protege Lil’ Bow Wow, whose 2000 debut Beware of Dog was certified double-Platinum, who was presented as the chief artist and future of the label. The first half of the ’00s were a watershed period for So So Def, with its core artists accounting for numerous hits and millions of albums sold.\n\nSigning on successful acts like J-Kwon, Youngbloodz, Dem Franchize Boyz, and Anthony Hamilton, in 2005, Dupri’s midas touch was sought out by Virgin Records, which appointed him Executive Vice President of Urban Music, with the label and its roster following him. Parting ways with Virgin in 2006, he was later appointed President of Urban Music at Universal Music Group’s The Island Def Jam. So So Def has continued to operate in the interim, its most recent release being the So So Def 25th Anniversary compilation in 2018.\n\nE-40\n\nIf any rap artist has ever gotten their success “out of the mud,” it’s E-40, as the tenured vet first retailed his music out of the trunk of his car. A native of the Bay Area, E-40 began embarking on his rap career in 1986, forming the group Most Valuable Players with his brother D-Shot, his sister Suga T, and cousin B-Legit while still a student at Grambling State University. Returning to the Bay, Most Valuable Players released the single “The King’s Men,” with E-40 launching the label Sick Wid It Records. Soon after, the group rebranded themselves as The Click, releasing their debut EP Let’s Side through the label in 1990, with E-40 following up with his debut EP Mr. Flamboyant the following year.\n\nUnveiling their debut studio album Down and Dirty in 1992, the project was a minor success, peaking at No. 87 on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, but it was in 1993 when E-40, The Click and Sick Wid It truly made their presence known. That year, E-40 released his second EP The Mail Man, which included the breakout hit “Captain Save a Hoe ” featuring The Click, which was their first single to crack the Billboard Hot 100 and also landed at No. 12 on the rap singles chart.\n\nRoughly a month later, E-40 released his debut studio album Federal, which was distributed by Solar Music Group and reached No. 80 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. B-Legit, D-Shot, and Suga T also dropped solo albums that year, all of which charted on Billboard and beckoned the majors to attempt to strike a deal. In 1994, E-40 inked a distribution deal with Jive Records, which led to the release of In a Major Way, which turned the rapper from a regional stalwart into a bonafide star. The album reached No. 13 on the Billboard 200 and No. 2 on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, with 70,000 copies sold in its first week.\n\nIn a Major Way, led by the Suga T-assisted hit “Sprinkle Me,” was certified Platinum, with The Click’s sophomore album Game Related reaching Gold. This lent further evidence of Sick Wid It’s potential as a hit factory, which was backed up by successful releases from E-40, Celly Cel, B-Legit and D-Shot reaching the upper half of the Billboard 200 during the late ’90s. Sick Wid It’s deal with Jive ended during the early ’00s, but E-40 and the label trekked on, adding new talent like Turf Talk, as well as his own son Droop-E, to the roster. Partnering with Lil Jon’s BME Recordings and Warner Bros. Records, Sick Wid It enjoyed a resurgence on the back of the release of E-40’s My Ghetto Report Card album.\n\nProducing the hits “Tell Me When to Go” and “U and Dat,” the album debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200, which remains the highest mark for E-40 and Sick Wid It on the chart to date. Reaching Gold-certification, My Ghetto Report Card was a monstrous highlight for the label, but was complimented by a succession of strong indie releases by its stable of talent. E-40 and Sick Wid It remain active today, with artists like Nef the Pharaoh, OMB Peezy, Droop-E, and E-40 himself continuing to wave the flag over the past decade.\n\nJuicy J & DJ Paul\n\nAs two of the forefathers of one of the greatest rap groups and collectives to emerge out of the south, Juicy J and DJ Paul possess all of the qualities distinguished to Hip-Hop royalty. A native of Memphis, TN., DJ Paul kicked off his career behind the turntables during the late ’80s before teaming up with Lord Infamous to form the group The Serial Killaz. Shortly after, fellow Memphis native Juicy J teamed up with the duo, forming the Backyard Posse before assuming the name Three 6 Mafia in 1991.\n\nPartnering with Nicholas ‘Nick Scarfo’ Jackson, Juicy J and DJ Paul co-founded Prophet Entertainment, with rappers Crunchy Black, Gangsta Boo and Koopsta Knicca being added as members of the group. Releasing their debut album Mystic Stylez in 1995, the project received critical acclaim and reached No. 56 on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts.\n\nThe following year, Three 6 Mafia followed that effort with their sophomore album Chapter 1: The End, their first album to crack the Billboard 200. Parting ways with Jackson and Prophet Entertainment in the wake of the album’s release, Juicy J and DJ Paul founded Hypnotize Minds in 1997, enjoying instant success with their third studio album Chapter 2: World Domination. The album, which was distributed through RED/Sony, was the group’s first to earn Gold certification, moving over 800,000 copies, their best sales return to the point in their career. Hypnotize Minds then began to roll our solo projects and collaborative albums from its core members, with Gangsta Boo’s Enquiring Minds, Project Pat’s Ghetty Green, and Tear Da Club Up Thugs’ Gold album CrazyNDaLazDayz being released between 1998 and the end of 1999.\n\nIn 2000, Three 6 Mafia released their fourth studio album When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6, Sixty 1, which saw the group elevate to national stardom. Debuting at No. 6 on the Billboard 200, by far their highest charting placement to that point, and was certified Platinum after moving over one million units. The next three years saw album releases from Gangsta Boo (Both Worlds *69), Project Pat (Mista Don’t Play: Everythangs Workin, Layin’ da Smack Down), Juicy J (Chronicles of the Juice Man), DJ Paul (Underground Volume 16: For da Summa), and La Chat (Murder She Spoke), all of which peaked within the Top 25 of the Rap Album chart.\n\nThe early ’00s also saw Juicy J and DJ Paul sign on new acts Frayser Boy and Lil Wyte, both of whom would release multiple albums on Hypnotize Minds, all of which were commercially successful independent releases. Three 6 Mafia’s peak in terms of visibility lasted throughout the decade, earning a Gold plaque for their Da Unbreakables album in 2003, and their second Platinum for their 2005 effort Most Known Unknown. The group, which won an Oscar for Best Original Song for “It’s Hard out Here for a Pimp” from the motion picture Hustle & Flow in 2006, would eventually go on to pursue individual endeavors.\n\nIn 2009, Juicy J joined Wiz Khalifa’s Taylor Gang imprint as part-owner and A&R representative, while DJ Paul has largely focused on DJing and production since Three 6 Mafia’s last album, Last 2 Walk, in 2008. Hypnotize Minds last released an album in 2012 and has remained dormant since.\n\nMaster P\n\nCapitalizing on a $10,000 inheritance from his late grandfather, Master P flipped that windfall into an investment that yielded one of the most lucrative and pivotal record labels in Hip-Hop. Becoming a music retailer with the opening of his No Limit Records And Tapes shop in Richmond, California, the operation spawned the offshoot No Limit Records, with P as its flagship artist. Releasing his debut project Mind of a Psychopath in 1990, the former basketball standout followed that effort up with a string of independently released albums, including Get Away Clean, Mama’s Bad Boy, 99 Ways to Die and The Ghettos Tryin to Kill Me!. During those years, the label also signed and released projects by TRU, Mia X, EA-Ski, Dangerous Dame, Lil Ric, Sonya C, and Rally Ral, as well as compilations featuring the likes of DJ Screw, UGK, The Dayton Family, and Eightball & MJG.\n\nMoving to his native New Orleans during the mid ’90s, P’s transition back to the bayou came with his revamping of the No Limit roster, with new recruits Fiend, Mac, Mystikal, Mr. Serv-On, and Soulja Slim. The establishment of the new headquarters also coincided with major record companies taking notice of No Limit’s success. Interscope Records founder Jimmy Iovine offered the rapper a $1 million record deal, which he turned down to pursue a more equitable partnership elsewhere. That patience, along with a $25,000 meeting with Michael Jackson’s attorney, paid off tenfold as he struck a groundbreaking distribution deal with Priority Records, which included him receiving a 85% profit split in his favor, ownership of he and the label’s master recordings, and a $375,000 advance from every album released. Simultaneously, No Limit released a string of pivotal albums in the label’s history, with Silkk‘s The Shocker; Kane & Abel’s The 7 Sins; and Master P’s Mr. Ice Cream Man, which became the label’s first Platinum-certified release in its history.\n\nThe following year, Master P unleashed his sixth studio album Ghetto D, which moved over 760,000 copies in its first week of release and was certified triple Platinum. In addition, albums by TRU, Mia X, and Mystikal were also successful, all reaching No. 2 or higher on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. 1998 would mark No Limit’s most fruitful period for the label, with $160 million in revenue, 23 albums released, and 15 million copies sold. His seventh studio album MP Da Last Don would be his most commercially successful album, selling over four million copies, while Snoop Dogg, C-Murder, Mystikal, Silkk the Shocker, and Young Bleed also reached Platinum status. Launching a clothing line, film division, and sports agency, the No Limit enterprise had become the biggest in the rap industry at the time, with P raking in a reported $56.5 million in 1998 alone.\n\nThe subsequent years would include additional Platinum releases from Master P, Snoop Dogg, and Silkk the Shocker, but No Limit’s momentum had tapered off by the early ’00s, with its distribution deal with Priority expiring in 2001. Inking a $10 million distribution deal with Universal Records shortly after, signings like P’s son Lil’ Romeo, who struck Gold with his 2001 eponymous debut, and Choppa helped the label sustain its relevance during the first half of the decade. Rebranding in an attempt to reach its past glory, No Limit Records has been shuttered as a record label, but is remembered as one of the biggest brands in music at its height. Having received Platinum plaques and introduced Platinum acts ten times over, Master P is undoubtedly among the best double-threats we’ve seen thus far.\n\nT.I.\n\nIn 2002, T.I. was at a crossroads.The rapper, who was discovered by music executive Kawan “KP” Prather, had signed a deal with LaFace Records just three years prior but was released from the label after his 2001 debut I’m Serious commercially underperformed. Back at square one, the former hustler reverted back to his roots, hitting the streets with a succession of mixtape releases that caught wildfire. Teaming up with business partner and manager Jason Geter, the pair founded Grand Hustle Records, securing a joint-venture deal with Atlantic Records the following year.\n\nRiding high off a guest appearance on fellow Atlanta rapper Bone Crusher’s hit “Never Scared,” and his own breakout single “24s,” T.I. unveiled his sophomore album Trap Muzik in August 2003. Debuting at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 with 109,000 copies sold in its first week, the album was certified Platinum and saw T.I. brazenly crowning himself as “King of the South” and established him as the south’s latest star soloist. Now garnering comparisons to the likes of JAY-Z, the rapper upped the ante the following year with Urban Legend, which nearly doubled the first week sales of Trap Muzik and also surpassed one million copies sold.\n\nReleasing the soundtrack for the 2005 film Hustle & Flow, which included the Oscar-winning song “It’s Hard out Here for a Pimp,” Grand Hustle continued to expand its profile, adding artists like P$C, Young Dro, B.o.B., Yung L.A., 8Ball & MJG, Meek Mill, Killer Mike, and others to the label during the latter half of the ’00s. In addition to Yung Dro’s Gold album Best Thang Smoking’ and B.o.B.’s multi-platinum debut B.o.B Presents: The Adventures of Bobby Ray, this period saw T.I. reach his peak in popularity, as the albums King and T.I. vs. T.I.P. both exceeded two million in sales.\n\nHowever, the rapper’s most commercially successful effort was his sixth studio album Paper Trail. Released in 2008, the album, which sold over a half million units in its first week, included the chart-topping singles “Whatever You Like” and “Live Your Life” and was certified quadruple Platinum. Despite various legal battles and jail stints, T.I. has remained one of rap’s most bankable stars well into the following decade, releasing three more Platinum albums (No Mercy, Trouble Man: Heavy is the Head, Paperwork) and made the jump into the fashion world with his brand Akoo, film with his starring role in ATL, and television with the VH1 reality show franchise T.I. & Tiny: The Family Hustle.\n\nThe past decade saw T.I. and Geter further bolster the Grand Hustle lineup, introducing Platinum selling, chart-topping stars like Travis Scott and Iggy Azalea, and Trae Tha Truth, the latter of whom was appointed vice president of the label in 2017. Ending its distribution deal with Atlantic Records in late 2012, Grand Hustle artists released projects through Columbia Records, Epic, and Empire.The label, which has released over 30 studio albums, is currently independent.\n\nKanye West\n\nSome of the best businesses and companies are born out of the necessity to see one’s vision through, as was the case with Kanye West‘s creation of G.O.O.D. Music. The Chicago native began his career as a producer, coming under the mentorship of fellow Chicago native No I.D. before working under The Hitmen member Deric “D-Dot” Angelettie. During the early ’00s, West began producing for Roc-A-Fella Records artists, contributing to albums by Jay-Z, Beanie Sigel, Cam’ron, Memphis Bleek and other talent on the label. With aspirations of having a career as a rapper, West attempted to shop his music, but was met with lukewarm interest, with suitors more interested in his beats.\n\nAfter initially being set to ink with Capitol Records, the hitmaker signed with Roc-A-Fella as an artist in 2002, appearing on JAY-Z’s The Blueprint 2: The Gift & the Curse and The Black Album the following year. After getting into a near-fatal car accident in 2002, West recorded his debut single “Through the Wire” during his recovery, which became a dark-horse hit, eventually climbing to No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, receiving a Grammy nomination, and earning Platinum certification. In 2004, he released his debut studio album The College Dropout, which debuted at No.2 on the Billboard 200, selling 441,000 copies in its first week. The album was an overwhelming smash, selling over four million copies in the U.S. while garnering the rapper several Grammy Award nominations.\n\nIn the wake of The College Dropout‘s success, West was offered his own label deal, which he took, founding G.O.O.D. Music in 2004 in conjunction with Sony BMG. The label’s first signees were veteran Chicago rapper Common and vocalist and musician John Legend, with the latter’s 2004 debut Get Lifted being the first album released on the imprint.Get Lifted produced the Grammy Award winning single “Ordinary People” and was certified double Platinum. The following year, Common released his G.O.O.D. Music debut Be, which received four Grammy nominations and Gold certification, becoming one of his most commercially successful albums to date.\n\nWhile Legend and Common’s popularity and critical acclaim gave the label instant credibility as more than a vanity label, Kanye was on a historic run, churning out a string of multi-Platinum albums (Late Registration, Graduation, 808s & Heartbreak) and collecting Grammy Awards of his own. The latter half of the ’00s saw the additions of Detroit rapper Big Sean and Ohio native Kid Cudi, both of whom became stars in their own right.\n\nDropping first, Kid Cudi’s debut album Man on the Moon: The End of Day was released in September 2009, tallying over four million units sold and producing the Diamond certified single “Pursuit of Happiness (Nightmare).” Cudi released two additional albums through G.O.O.D. Music, his Platinum certified sophomore album Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager and the Gold-selling effort Indicud. After inking a distribution deal with Def Jam in 2011, West and G.O.O.D. released Big Sean’s debut album Finally Famous, which was certified Platinum and was followed by a string of Platinum and Gold releases from the rapper (Hall of Fame, Dark Sky Fantasy, I Decided, Detroit 2) over the subsequent decade.\n\nThe imprint has also seen success with Clipse member Pusha T, who signed to the label in 2010, Desiigner, Teyana Taylor and 070 Shake, with additional artists including GLC, Consequence, Tony Williams, Malik Yusef, Mr. Hudson, Q-Tip, Yasiin Bey and more passing through its doors over the years. G.O.O.D. Music’s most recent release is 070 Shake’s You Can’t Kill Me, the last album under the label’s distribution agreement with Def Jam, which ended with the fulfillment of West’s contract with the company."
