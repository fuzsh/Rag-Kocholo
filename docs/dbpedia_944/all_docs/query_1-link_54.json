        "text": "The Intercity Materieel or ICM (lit. transl. Intercity Material â€“ transl. Intercity Rolling Stock) is an electric multiple unit (EMU) train type operated by the Nederlandse Spoorwegen in the Netherlands. The train received the nickname Koploper, because it had a so-called \"walk through head\". After these trains were modernized, the \"walk through heads\" were removed. The modernized train sets are referred to as Intercity Materieel Modern (ICMm).\n\nThe prototypes were built in 1977, with full-scale production lasting from 1983 to 1994 by Talbot. The first train sets came into service in 1977. The trains run daily on the Dutch rail network and, together with the VIRM, form the most important equipment on services connecting the Randstad with the rest of the country."
