        "text": "My thanks to Sherri Greene Ottis for allowing me to reproduce the following map, “Major Escape Routes Through France, 1940-1945.” from her book, Silent Heroes, Downed Airmen and the French Underground, Lexington, Kentucky: The University Press of Kentucky, 2001. The map was designed by John Hollingsworth. Although there were other escape routes, these certainly were some of the most important. To enlarge it and make it more readable, click once on the map and then once again.\n\nA similar map was prepared by the National Museum of the US Air Force, which has kindly allowed me to reproduce it below. To enlarge it significantly and make it more readable, click once on the map and then click a second time.\n\nBoth of above maps appear to have been inspired by a map, “Main evasion routes in western Europe,” that was published on p. 64 of the book M.I.9 Escape and Evasion 1939-1945, by M.R.D. Foote and J.M. Langley, Boston: Little, Brown and Co., 1979, 1980. That map can be viewed at http://airforceescape.org/escape-route-maps/. In addition, a map of the Comet Line escape route can be viewed at the Le Reseau Comete website at http://www.cometeline.org/ . On that website scroll down to view the map.\n\nThe following map was published in the June 2007 issue of the Air Forces Escape and Evasion Society newsletter, Communications, No source was given. Nevertheless, it gives some idea of the complexity of the different escape routes.\n\nBelgian Ministry of National Defense Escape Line Map\n\nThe following map appeared on pg. 213 of the book Livre D’Or de la Resistance Belge, Ouvrage publié par la Commission de lè Historique de la Résistance instituée par le Ministère de la Défense Nationale. Publication date was sometime after the end of WWII.\n\nDutch-Paris Line"
