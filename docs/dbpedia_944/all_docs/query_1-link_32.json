        "text": "Multiple different train services make cross the border between Freilassing and Salzburg, as this is the route taken by trains from Munchen/Munich and beyond to eastern and south-eastern Austria; many of which travel across Austria and continue on to other countries.\n\nSo the trains which come this way include:\n\nday and night trains to Hungary\n\nthe day and night trains to Croatia, which also cross Slovenia\n\nthe night trains from Germany to Italy.\n\nthe new night train service from Munchen/Munich to Krakow and Warsaw\n\nThe day trains:\n\n(1) Railjet trains which depart every other hour on the Munchen/Munich Hbf â Salzburg â Linz â St Polten â Wien/Vienna â Gyor â Budapest route.\n\n(2) Daily Railjet trains which share the Munchen - Salzburg - Bad Gastein - Villach - Klagenfurt route with the EC trains.\n\nThe morning train connects in Villach with a train on to Zagreb via Ljubljana.\n\n(3) EC trains which take these four routes once per day;\n\nSaarbrucken - Kaiserslautern - Mannheim - Stuttgart - Ulm - Augsburg - Munchen - Salzburg - Graz\n\nFrankfurt (Main) - Heidelberg - Mannheim - Stuttgart - Ulm - Augsburg - Munchen - Salzburg - Graz\n\nFrankfurt (Main) - Heidelberg - Stuttgart - Ulm - Augsburg - Munchen - Salzburg - Bad Gastein - Villach - Klagennfurt; this train now connects in Villach with a train on to Lesce-Bled - Ljubljana - Zagreb;\n\nMunster - Duisburg - Dusseldorf - Koln/Cologne - Bonn - Koblenz - Mainz -- Mannheim - Stuttgart - Ulm - Augsburg - Munchen - Salzburg - Bad Gastein - Villach - Klagenfurt\n\nThis train connects in Villach for a train on to Ljubljana.\n\nBetween June 20th and Sep 13th that train from Villach usually connects in Ljubljana for a train which travels on to Zagreb and then continues overnight to Beograd, where it arrives at 06:05 and it conveys sleeping cars; though this train on to Beograd was suspended at the start of the pandemic and has yet to resume\n\nThese EC trains also call at Munchen Ost after they depart from Munchen Hbf.\n\n(4) Hourly Regio trains, operated by Meridian that link Munchen with Salzburg.\n\n(5) Hourly local trains which shuttle across the border on a Bad Reichenhall - Freilassing â Salzburg route; trains from Berchtesgaden connect into these trains at Freilassing\n\nThe night trains:\n\n(6) There are Nightjet trains to Italy, which travel on these three routes:\n\nMunchen/Munich â Padova/Padua â Vicenza â Verona â Peschiera del Garda â Desenzano del Garda â Brescia â Milano - Genova and La Spezia\n\nThe only direct train from Munchen/Munich to Milano.\n\nMunchen/Munich â Bologna â Firenze/Florence â Arezzo â Roma\n\nThe only direct train from Germany to Florence/Firenze and Roma.\n\nStuttgart - Munchen/Munich Ost â Tarvisio â Udine â Treviso â Venezia/Venice\n\n(7) The Euronight train from Stuttgart and Munchen/Munich Ost to Budapest via Wien/Vienna\n\n(8) The overnight train on this route: Stuttgart - Munchen/Munich Ost - Villach - Lesce-Bled - Ljubljana - Zagreb\n\nBetween June 13th and Sept 20th it's usually possible to make onward connections from this train on to both Athens/Athina and Istanbul; but these onward connections were suspended at the start of the pandemic and have yet to resume!\n\n(9) The new Euronight service which is direct from Munchen Hbf to Krakow and to Warsaw\n\nThere is now a daily ICE train which takes a Berlin - Erfurt - Frankfurt (Main) - Stuttgart - Ulm - Munich/Munchen - Kufstein â Worgl â Jenbach - Innsbruck route.\n\nThe most frequent daytime trains which take the route from Rosenheim to Kufstein are the seven EC trains per day which take a Munchen/Munich â Kufstein â Worgl â Jenbach - Innsbruck route.\n\nDuring the day these trains depart Munchen/Munich in the odd hours and they also call at Munchen Ost station after they depart from Munchen Hbf.\n\nConnect in Worgl for St, Johann, Kitzbuhel and Zell am See.\n\nThough on most Saturdays a direct ICE train to these towns departs from Muchen/Munich hbf at 15:20.\n\nFive of those EC trains continue beyond Innsbruck to call at Brennero â Bolzano â Fortezza â Bolzano âRovigo â Trento â Verona.\n\nConnect in Verona for cities to the west including Brescia, Desenzano for Lake Garda, Milano and Torino/Turin.\n\nOn Monday- Friday three of these trains have their journeys extended beyond Verona to Bologna â and at the height of summer, one train continues beyond Bologna to Rimini; there are two trains per day from Munchen/Munich to Bologna at weekends\n\nConnect in Bologna for cities further south including Ancona, Bari, Firenze/Florence, Napoli and Roma.\n\nOn Monday to Friday one of these trains continues beyond Verona to call at Vicenza, Padova/Padua and Venezia/Venice; though there are two trains per day on Saturday and Sunday from Munchen/Munich Venezia/Venice.\n\nBy Nightjet train to Innsbruck\n\nThe Nightjet overnight trains from Amsterdam via Duisburg, Dussedorf and Koln/Cologne and Hamburg to Innsbruck, also come this way.\n\nTwo charming towns on the shore of the Bodensee are connected by frequent local trains which take the route from Lindau to Bregenz, with at least one of these trains per hour continuing beyond Bregenz to Feldkirch.\n\nA few Railjet trains per day depart Bregenz for Wien/Vienna travelling via St Anton, Innsbruck, Salzburg and Linz, but there are other additional Railjets which travel between Feldkirch and those other Austrian cities.\n\nThree long distance train services also come this way:\n\n(1) The daily ICE train on a Dortmund - Wuppertal - Koln/Cologne - Bonn - Koblenz - Mainz - Mannheim - Stuttgart â Ulm â Lindau â Bregenz â St Anton â Innsbruck route.\n\n(2) Seven daily EC trains on the newly improved Munchen/Munchen â Lindau â Bregenz â St Margrethen - St Gallen âZurich Flughafen/Airport â Zurich route.\n\nConnect in St Margrethen for trains to Chur via Landquart.\n\n(3) A relatively new Railjet service which follows a Frankfurt (Main) - Darmstadt - Heidelberg - Stuttgart - Ulm - Friedrichshafen - Lindau - Bregenz - Landeck - Innsbruck - Salzburg - Linz - Wien/Vienna route.\n\nThis train provides a new direct rail connection from multiple German locations to Innsbruck, Linz and Wien/Vienna, but when travelling to Austria from Ulm and destinations to the north, it's possible to save time by making connections in Munchen and Munich.\n\nLocal and regional trains provide rail links on four routes between Germany and the popular spa towns in Bohemia (western Czechia)\n\nIf you want to travel between Germany and Frantiskovy LaznÃ©/Franzensbad, Karlovy Vary/Carlsbad and MarianskÃ© Lazne/Marienbad by train, connections are often required, but the journeys aren't particularly complicated.\n\n1: connecting in Cheb for Frantiskovy Lazne, Karlovy Vary and MarianskÃ© Lazne; and Praha/Prague\n\nCheb is a gateway station when travelling from many destinations in Germany to the Czceh spa towns by train\n\nCheb has regular trains to the three most popular spa towns, Frantiskovy Lazne, Karlovy Vary and MarianskÃ© Lazne\n\nThere are now hourly local trains which travel over the border from Marktredwitz to Cheb; these trains from/to Marktredwitz are operated by agilis, so rail passes will not be valid.\n\nRegio trains from Nurnberg to Marktredwitz connect with these trains on to Cheb.\n\nIn Nurnberg connections are available with ICE trains from multiple destinations across Germany including Frankfurt (Main), Hamburg, Hannover, Koln/Cologne and Munchen/Munich.\n\nSince the discontinuation of the direct Nurnberg > Praha/Prag trains some years ago, this routing via Nurnberg, Marktredwitz and Cheb is the main rail route for train journeys between central Germany and the Czech capital, because Cheb also has direct trains on to Praha/Prag.\n\n2: to Franzensbad\n\nEvery two hours local trains travel a Hof â As - Frantiskovy LaznÃ© â Cheb route.\n\nSo this route is typically the best option when travelling from eastern Germany to Frantiskovy LaznÃ©/Franzensbad to by train\n\nAt Hof connections are available from Regio trains which have travelled from Bamberg, Bayreuth and Dresden; also connect in Dresden when travelling from Berlin or Leipzig.\n\n3: from Dresden to Frantiskovy LaznÃ©\n\nFour local trains per day take a Plauen â Bad Brambach - Frantiskovy LaznÃ© - Cheb route.\n\nAt Plauen connections are available with Regio trains from Dresden via Zwickau and Chemnitz, so if youâll be heading to Cheb and Frantiskovy LaznÃ© from those German cities AND the timings suit, this is a slightly quicker route than travelling via Hof.\n\n4: from Dresden to Carlsbad\n\nUp to 7 x local trains per day travel from the German border town of Johanngeorgenstad to the Czecch spa town of Karlovy Vary/Carlsbad.\n\nIn Johanngeorgenstad connections are available with trains from Zwickau, which is served by trains from Chemnitz and Dresden.\n\nThe Hamburg > Koebenhavn train service was switched away from the route which travelled through Lubeck and Nykobing a couple of years ago, so trains no longer travel on the ferries from Germany to Denmark.\n\nSo the only route taken by trains from Germany and Denmark is the route between Flensburg and Padborg; four different train services now travel across this border crossing in Jutland:\n\n(1) Five or Seven trains EC trains per day take this route: Hamburg â Padborg - Kolding â Odense - Ringsted â Kobenhavn/Copenhagen.\n\nThe increased level of service operates during the summer.\n\nThe direct trains from Hamburg to Aarhus have been withdrawn and their timings from Hamburg have been taken over by the additional trains to Kobenhavn/Copenhagen.\n\nBut new Danish IC express services have been provided from Kolding to Aarhus, which have a simple as can be cross-platform connection in Kolding from all of the Hamburg to Kobenhavn/Copenhagen trains.\n\nThe departures from Hamburg at 08:55; 10:53 (not Saturday*) and 12:53 (not Saturday*) typically have 40 min connections in KÃ¸benhavn H station info fast Snabbtag trains on to Stockholm.\n\n*= there are fewer direct trains on the KÃ¸benhavn to Stockholm route on Saturdays.\n\nThe trains which depart Hamburg before 15:00 also have easy connections in Kobenhavn H station on to Goteborg/Gothenburg\n\nIt is now possible to reach Oslo from Hamburg in single day by train- depart Hamburg Hbf daily at 08:56 and connect in KÃ¸benhavn and Goteborg in order to arrive into Oslo at around 23:45.\n\nThe time between trains in KÃ¸benhavn H station will be around 55 mins and the time between arrival and departure in Goteborg is scheduled to be 1hr 50mins.\n\n(2) Six x Danish IC trains per day travel between Flensburg and Fredericia;
