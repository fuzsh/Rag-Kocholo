The nice news is that parking in Giethoorn is free almost everywhere. We’ll walk you through the possibilities.\n\nCar parking in Giethoorn\n\nIn the centre of Giethoorn you can walk, cycle and sail alone. If you come by car, you can park it in various parking spaces on the outside of the city centre village. The number of parking spaces is more than enough, but large parking garages that you will find in Amsterdam and other major cities, for example, are missing.\n\nParking in Giethoorn can be done in the public parking lots and in parking spaces at hotels, restaurants, boat rentals and tour companies, this is free at almost all of them. There are also some paid areas where you can stand for a whole day for a couple of euros.\n\nP-Route parking spaces\n\nIn Giethoorn we have a clear P-Route system. And actually the great thing is that wherever you choose to park within this P-Route you are almost always within a 5 minute walk of a restaurant, supermarket, cruise company or boat rental. The different zones are divided into colors (green, red and yellow). Giethoorn is a long village built to the main vein of the village, the village moat. All companies are located on this village canal and branches. And with these companies you will find all the parking spaces. Seen from a southbound direction, P-route is red (centre-south), P-Route green (centre-centre) and P-Route yellow (center-north) Each parking lot has its own color and number combination, so every parking lot (company) is easy to find.\n\nParking at the supermarket\n\nIn the center of Giethoorn is the Plus supermarket Ter Schure. At this supermarket there is a spacious parking lot where you can park your car to visit the super market. But adjacent to the supermarket is a large tourist parking lot (Green P1) for visitors to our village. If you want to visit our village and first stock up, this is the ideal place to park your car.\n\nParking at companies\n\nMany catering companies such as restaurants, boat rentals and hotels in Giethoorn have their own car parks for their customers. Usually you can park there for free and stand for a longer period of time. This is ideal if you want to eat extensively or rent a boat in Giethoorn.\n\nParking at an accommodation\n\nIf you book an overnight stay at a hotel, b&b, guest house or holiday home in Giethoorn, you often have your own parking space. In most cases, these parking spaces are exclusively intended for visitors. Then you are always insured for a parking space in Giethoorn.\n\nAlways inform how parking is arranged when booking an overnight stay or accommodation and whether there are any costs involved. Usually a parking space is included when renting the property or hotel room. If you book via a booking website such as Booking.com or Agoda, the booking information often mentions whether this is inclusive parking or not.\n\nParking at a restaurant\n\nA number of restaurants in Giethoorn have their own parking park or parking spaces. You can use this for free if you book a table there. Often you can stand there for a longer period of time. So if you want to see the village or rent a boat, such a parking space is the perfect place to start your day of Giethoorn.\n\nRestaurants in Giethoorn\n\nNo expensive parking tickets, that saves a lot.
