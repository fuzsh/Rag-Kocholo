        "text": "Back to French Minor Railways - there is a substantial tome with that title by WJK Davies which gives an overview of each region and good detail of some.\n\nOff-hand, the Correze, Tarn, Herault and Vivarais also survived the 30's cull.\n\nIndeed they did -- as did a great number of other independent local-railway concerns, which are now lost -- metre gauge, standard gauge, and also a very little 600mm gauge ! An enormous amount of such, perished approximately during the decade 1945 -- 55. When Bryan Morgan's The End of the Line was published in 1955 (Morgan was of course not the first Briton to have experience of French minor railways, but it would seem safe to say that that book of his was the first attempt at a full \"roll-call\" of same, as in action at the time of publication): the author remarked in the book that as at 1955, there basically remained only odd remnants here and there, of France's minor-railway riches as had been, maybe a generation earlier -- and of course most of what there was left in '55, has now gone. (The four above-quoted systems lasted, to be covered accordingly by Morgan in The End of... ; the Herault system, though, had effectively only one line left with passenger service as at 1955; freight continued on other parts of the system, but Morgan -- understandably -- makes no attempt to keep tabs on freight doings.)\n\nI find particularly heartbreaking (have mentioned this recently, elsewhere in these Forums), the huge loss of French minor railways over the quite short period 1946 -- 51 inclusive. Many thus affected: being still active or only very recently closed as at 1939, no doubt had their lives prolonged by the abnormal conditions of World War II / German occupation, and the multitude of shortages accompanying same; but once the war was over and some sort of quasi-normality returned, closures resumed apace -- and this time, for good. For a short while after the war, some minor-rail concerns did their best to improve and modernise services, and a few of these even quite prospered, briefly; but the temper of the times was overwhelmingly against local minor railways and in favour of road transport in their stead. Thousands of kilometres were abandoned, all over France, over those half-dozen years (1949 was a particularly hideous year); and a good deal more, albeit at a slower rate, shortly thereafter.\n\nThe Comite (missing accent) Rail-route was formed in 1935, proposed and implemented the replacement of all local passenger services with buses, on the national network, buses duplicating mainline rail services would also be withdrawn, and the use of railcars encouraged. The Reseau Breton lost its passenger services to Morlaix, La Bro, and Le Fret in 1939, also ordering six railcars.\n\nWith the outbreak of war, German occupation, and shortage of supplies, buses were rapidly taken off the road, and as already mentioned, rail services resumed which had only recently been withdrawn. In 1941, the RB took over the CFD Finistere, whose lines had closed 1937 - 1939, until the end of WW2, when all lines bar one closed again, this section was converted to standard gauge and lasted until 1963.\n\nLe Fret lost its passenger services again in 1946 and La Bro (how the locals usually refer to the town) in 1953.\n\nApologies for missing accents.\n\nNo worries -- I also lack the gear to do accents on letters in foreign languages !\n\nMorgan gives a few slightly wistful words to the easternmost stretch of the RB, to La Brohiniere to give that junction its full name. He mentions Loudeac as the terminus for passenger at time of publication, of the line eastward from Carhaix -- he writes, \"here now the Reseau ends, though recently it trailed on to a further junction and for its last four miles ran side by side with the standard gauge [the SNCF's Ploermel branch] up a long incline to [\"the La B place\" !]. I loved that dying fall, that courteous handing-over of control: but it must be confessed that Loudeac was always the logical terminus of the system.\" He seems to be referring to La Bro's being located just within the departement of Ille-et-Vilaine -- administratively, but not culturally, part of Brittany -- being essentially mainstream-French rather than Celtic. In fact, Loudeac to La Bro remained in use for freight until the very end of metre-gauge working on the RB in 1967; but as mentioned above, Morgan \"didn't do freight\".\n\nIt's an interesting question, there's an obvious north-south split in interest in railways. There's single digit numbers of tourist/preserved lines in Spain and Italy has hardly anything at all\n\nand @30907 writes: \"The BRD/West Germany had a pretty substantial RC population, unlike the DDR, so I am not sure about that. And Czechia's dominant faith is also RC (though 'dominant' is hardly the word)...\"\n\nRe the \"religion\" element: it's only a vague notion floating around in my head, and maybe complete nonsense -- prompted in part, by the perceived paucity of railway enthusiasts / enthusiasm in Ireland, at present and in the past (there have of course always been some there, often very keen !) -- a situation, it seems to me, of more scarceness than explicable by the mathematics of Great Britain's having a much bigger population than Ireland.\n\nMy impression is that -- big generalisation, subject to many blips -- the north of West Germany tends to be Protestant, and the south Catholic. Have long had, from more than one source: picture that, since way before Communism, the Czech people have tended in the main, not to set very much store by religion -- they have been, historically, notionally and culturally Catholic (pace Jan Hus and all that !); but not in fact to care greatly about it all -- \"voting with their feet\" as it were. On the other hand, the Slovaks tend -- like their Polish neighbours -- to be strongly and seriously Catholic: one of the reasons why Czechoslovakia as a nation, was not altogether a resounding success.\n\nNo worries -- I also lack the gear to do accents on letters in foreign languages !\n\nI have a dual keyboard on this tablet, because I need it a fair bit - but I don't think this forum should fuss over accents anyway.\n\nMorgan gives a few slightly wistful words to the easternmost stretch of the RB,\n\n...which I completely forgot about!\n\n\"The BRD/West Germany had a pretty substantial RC population, unlike the DDR, so I am not sure about that. And Czechia's dominant faith is also RC (though 'dominant' is hardly the word)...\"\n\nMy impression is that -- big generalisation, subject to many blips -- the north of West Germany tends to be Protestant, and the south Catholic.\n\nHistorically, yes, but the wave of forced migration in 1945 put an end to the relics of states that were monochrome one or the other (even Bavaria!).\n\nHave long had, from more than one source: picture that, since way before Communism, the Czech people have tended in the main, not to set very much store by religion -- they have been, historically, notionally and culturally Catholic (pace Jan Hus and all that !); but not in fact to care greatly about it all -- \"voting with their feet\" as it were.\n\nTrue - the RC dominance was imposed along with political control by the Hapsburgs - and CZ is reportedly the most secular country in Europe.\n\nOn the other hand, the Slovaks tend -- like their Polish neighbours -- to be strongly and seriously Catholic: one of the reasons why Czechoslovakia as a nation, was not altogether a resounding success.\n\nSlovakia was historically in the Hungarian part of the Empire, as the railway map shows - and strongly anti-Ottoman for understandable reasons.\n\nBTW (and vaguely on-topic) Slovakia has had rather more Passenger closures than CZ.\n\nhttps://spoortijdlijn.nl/ is an interesting map which shows how the passenger rail network in the Netherlands built up. Its in Dutch, but in Chrome, Google Translate does a good job at translating to English.\n\n@bspahh: I find items of this kind (\"animated\" maps showing waxing-and-waning over historical periods) absolutely fascinating, in any context. You posted this map, did you not, a couple of years ago in a thread in the International Transport sub-forum? I made then, a post in comment -- said comments of mine then, were on a subject relevant to this thread, re France and its minor lines under a variety of independent ownerships -- thus, repeating them here. The Netherlands were of course at one time, in similar case -- having had as well as their dense \"normal / orthodox\" network, a multitude of lesser lines, independently owned and mostly in the general \"steam tramway\" ballpark (also some electric lines): all this having been a mixture of standard gauge, and a variety of narrow gauges. (These Netherlands minor lines perished early: little of them was left by about the 1950s -- if I'm right, effectively nothing now remains.)\n\nWith the relatively small size of the on-screen map, it would of course have been impossible to feature the Netherlands' minor railways as above, in addition to the country's \"real\" railway system. One feature that does show up, is an area in the far north -- a fair-sized, roughly triangular patch bounded by Groningen, Leeuwarden and Meppel, all -- throughout the history of Dutch railways -- \"blank\" within. This in a context of the normal / orthodox rail network; in fact this seemingly blank area was served, \"back in the day\", by a number of lines of a particular -- in this case, standard gauge -- steam-tramway network.\n\nHamilton-Ellis wrote, in 1950s Trains Illustrated, a comparison of holidays to Brittany in (probably just before) 1938, and about 1955, where in the first he used the narrow gauge line, and in the second as it had closed they had a lengthy bus ride along the coast from St Malo.\n\nI'm pretty sure that I have in the part, read this article. That bloke certainly did a good deal of highly enviable stuff on the Continent pre-1940 !\n\nTwo ways to enter foreign letters etc, is firstly, every letter, number, and symbol has a 3 digit ASCII code readily available online, entered by the number pad on your computer keyboard.\n\nI will try this -- am very far from the world's most competent person re the intricacies of computer use; so, frankly, with no certainty of success ! In times past I had a splendid \"all-singing-and-dancing\" computer fitment which let me do accents; but things have so worked out that I no longer have it.\n\nTrue - the RC dominance was imposed along with political control by the Hapsburgs - and CZ is reportedly the most secular country in Europe.\n\nMy bolding -- I'd thought that that was Estonia: per an item which I seem to recall reading, something like 60% of the population there stoutly identify as atheist."
