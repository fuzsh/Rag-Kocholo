        "text": "Things to do in Hamburg\n\nAbout Hamburg\n\nThere are many reasons to consider a bus trip to Hamburg. With over 1.7 million inhabitants, Hamburg is the second biggest city in Germany after Berlin. Hamburg offers the beautiful hanseatic traditions, modernity, and vitality; overruling the typical cosmopolitan vibes of a port city. Every bus traveler will experience the versatility and vibrancy of Hamburg. From the white villas in the river Elba suburb Blankenese to the “sinful mile” of St. Paul directly opposite, making Hamburg a city with a lot of faces. The large bodies of water from the Elbe and the Alster with their tributaries and canals are combined with vast amounts of green spaces to create a unique urban experience of nature in the middle of the city.\n\nPlaces of Interest in Hamburg\n\nAfter your bus has reached the Hanseatic city, it won’t be long until you see the landmark of Hamburg, the church of St. Michaelis with a striking tower that you simply cannot miss. This is most commonly known as the “Michel” building and is as architecturally unique as the town hall of Hamburg is great. The district around the town hall was built after the Second World War, with the subsequent bomb damage it was rebuilt and is now a popular site for bus travelers. After a walk from the city centre to the harbor, you can experience the interesting sights of the harbor along with the hustle and bustle of a vibrant port city. Not to be overlooked, as it is still under construction, is the unfinished Elbe Philharmonic Hall, an impressive sight for our bus travelers. Not too far from the harbor you can find the “Miniatur Wunderland,” the largest railway model in the world. The intricacy in the design and imaginative constructions are a must see when you make a bus trip to Hamburg. You should also pay a visit to the Old Elbe Tunnel. Here you can travel under water, by car, on foot or with a bike! The unique structural design and the overview of Hamburg when you reach the other side, is definitely worth the effort of walking through the tunnel.\n\nCulture and History of Hamburg\n\nThe origins of Hamburg, one of the most popular bus destinations in Germany, can be traced back to the twelfth century. As a busy trade in the northern part of Germany, in 1189 King Frederick Barbarossa announced that trade would be free – making Hamburg a free imperial city. Then with industrialization, Hamburg grew beyond its old borders and by the beginning of the 20th century Hamburg’s harbor became one of the most important harbors in the world. For our historically inclined bus travelers, “The Museum for Hamburg History” holds information about all origins of Hamburg’s history. The building alone, viewed as an ambitious architectural design, is definitely worth seeing. From discovering the history and roots of Hamburg, to the modern day development, this museum can offer every bus traveler a new perspective on this northern city.\n\nNightlife in Hamburg\n\nThe Reeperbahn is the world famous entertainment hub of Hamburg, with clubs, bars, restaurants and theaters, there is something for every night owl! There are also over one hundred music venues in Hamburg as well as numerous bars, nightclubs and pubs that provide wide variety of night life suitable for every taste. And you can be sure that your bus will get you from A to B safely and efficiently ready to explore the party scene of Hamburg.\n\nInteresting Facts about Hamburg\n\nHamburg is well known as being the home of German musical theatre capital (e.g. the Lion King). The annual port festival and the Hamburg cathedral, the biggest festival in the country, are a must-do experience for bus travelers, likewise a visit to watch a home match of Hamburger SV and FC St.Pauli."
