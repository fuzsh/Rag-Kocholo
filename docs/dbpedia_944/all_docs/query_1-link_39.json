        "text": "Article source: NL Architects\n\nForum Groningen is a new multifunctional building in the center of Groningen, a cultural ‘department store’ filled with books and images, that offers exhibition spaces, movie halls, assembly rooms, restaurants. The Forum aspires to become a platform for interaction and debate, a ‘living room’ for the city.\n\nForum Groningen is NOT a library, NOT a museum, NOT a cinema, but a new type of public space where the traditional borders between these institutes will dissolve. Information will be presented thematically in a way that transcends the different media.\n\nArchitects: NL Architects with ABT Engineering\n\nProject: Forum Groningen\n\nLocation: Groningen, The Netherlands\n\nPhotography: NL Architects&ABT © Marcel van der Burg, NL Architects&ABT © Deon Prins\n\nSoftware used: Revit, Autocad, Rhinoceros, 3dS Max, Adobe\n\nClient: Municipality of Groningen\n\nDelegated Client: TwynstraGudde\n\nDesign Team: (NL Architects) Pieter Bannenberg, Kamiel Klaasse, Walter van Dijk, Thijs van Bijsterveldt, Florent Le Corre, Sören Grünert, Iwan Hameleers, Sybren Hoek, Kirsten Hüsig, Mathieu Landelle, Zhongnan Lao, Barbara Luns, Gert Jan Machiels, Sarah Möller, Gerbrand van Oostveen, Giulia Pastore, Guus Peters, Jose Ramon Vives, Laura Riaño Lopez, Arne van Wees, Zofia Wojdyga, Gen Yamamoto with Christian Asbo, Nicolo Bertino, Jonathan Cottereau, Marten Dashorst, Rebecca Eng, Antoine van Erp, Tan Gaofei, Sylvie Hagens, Britta Harnacke, Jana Heidacker, Sergio Hernandez Benta, Johannes Hübner, Yuseke Iwata, Cho Junghwa, Linda Kronmüller, Jakub Kupikowski, Katarina Labathova, Ana Lagoa Pereira Gomes, Qian Lan, Justine Lemesre, Amadeo Linke, Fabian Lutter, Rune Madsen, Phil Mallysh, José Maria Matteo Torres, Victoria Meniakina, Shuichiro Mitomo, Solène Muscato, Lea Olsson, Pauline Rabjeau, Thomas Scherzer, Michael Schoner, Martijn Stoffels, Jasper Schuttert, Bartek Tromczynski, Carmen Valtierra, Elisa Ventura, Benedict Völkel, Vittoria Volpi, Murk Wymenga, Qili Yang, Yena Young, Alessandro Zanini.\n\n(more…)\n\nArticle source: STUDIO JOB\n\nThe lounge created by Studio Job for the Groninger Museum is a showpiece in itself.\n\nThe design duo of Job Smeets (1970) and Nynke Tynagel (1977) was inspired by 19th-century private clubs full of smoking gentlemen in top hats. These were once sophisticated bastions with thick-pile carpets on creaking wooden floors; chandeliers were suspended from richly decorated ceilings supported by solid pillars. The muffled silence was only broken by the calming spatter of the fountain at the entrance. It was an ivory tower for the elite – just as it was on the Titanic. It is not without reason that this world has vanished.\n\nArchitects: STUDIO JOB\n\nProject: Job Lounge for Groninger Museum\n\nLocation: Groninger Museum, Groningen, Netherlands\n\nPhotography: Robert Kot, Peter Tahl\n\nArchitect Museum: Alessandro Mendini, Coop Himmelblau, Philippe Starck, Michéle de Lucchi\n\nDesign Job Lounge: Studio Job (Job Smeets & Nynke Tynagel)\n\nProject Design Team: Job Smeets & Nynke Tynagel\n\nClient: Groninger Museum (more…)\n\nArticle source: Kwint architecten\n\nKwint Architecten designed a community centre for the Paddepoel-Zuid & Tuinwijk districts in de dutch City of Groningen. The community center is located in a parc, called the Bessemoerpark, as a link between the two districts. As part of the transformation of the parc, Kwint Architecten was assigned to design a building with it’s own character, independent from the parc. The building is set up as an unpretentious master volume with an elongated shape. The volume is placed crosswise in the elongated parc, as a result of which transforms the building in a link between the two adjacent city districts. The entrance of the building is situated alongside a footpath between these districts. By means of rounding of two of the four corners the building derives a distinctive character. As a result of the rounding, the front and side facades melt together and prevents the use of the outdoor spaces at only one side. Instead, the shape stimulates the use of all the outdoor space alongside the building for activities. The building is designed to be a guest in the parc and to interact with the parc. Two elements are a added to the design. At one side a cavity is formed to mark the entrance, at the other side a porch is added which connects the main rooms to the park.\n\nArchitects: Kwint architecten\n\nProject: Community Center TuinPad\n\nLocation: Groningen, Netherlands\n\n(more…)\n\nArticle source: architectengroep ARCHIVIEW\n\nThe Infoversum is unique, not only because of its fluent design and the unusual techniques being used, the exploratory and inviting role it will play in the community also make it special.\n\nConveniently located near the centre of Groningen,the Infoversum cannot be overlooked. It is a building that makes one curious and that needs to be explored. Never before have so many different fields of expertise, goals and techniques successfully been combined in one design.\n\nArchitects: architectengroep ARCHIVIEW\n\nProject: Infoversum\n\nLocation: Groningen, The Netherlands\n\nSoftware used: Rhino and Allplan\n\nArchitect In Charge: Jack van der Palen\n\nCo-workers: Isabel Friederichs, Martin Runau.\n\nUse: Crossing border 3D dometheatre\n\nSite: public square\n\nBuilding area: size of the building\n\nFloor area ratio: 1380 m2\n\nStructure system: monocoque construction\n\nSeats: 265 multi-functional seats\n\nStanding places: 400 people\n\nDiameter dome: 23 m\n\nDiameter screen: 20 m\n\nProjectors: 8\n\nSpeakers: 60 speakers and 4 subwoofers\n\nInstigator: Prof. dr.
