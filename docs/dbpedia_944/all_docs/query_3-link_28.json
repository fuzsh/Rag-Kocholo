To be able to check in at the Dutch railway company, your card needs to hold a minimum of €20.-\n\nOne-time OV chip card\n\nIf you don’t plan on travelling any more than just to and from CaDansa, you may be better off buying a one-time ticket at first Dutch railway station you arrive at (a paper ticket with a chip that can be used once) or (even easier) to just buy an e-ticket online in advance. The good part about an e-ticket is that you won’t have the hassle of checking in and out. Do keep your ID nearby, they might check it!
