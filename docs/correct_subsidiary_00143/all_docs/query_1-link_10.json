        "text": "It was a rumour – actually one of three: JBoss, SleepyCat and Zend PHP, see our article Is Oracle buying JBoss? Or Zend PHP? Or SleepyCat? Or all of them? – and now it turns out to be true. There have been several announcements, most notably the SleepyCat Blog: http://blog.sleepycat.com/2006/02/next-ten-years.html (thanks Jan for pointing it out to me) that states: “You have likely heard the\n\nrumors; you may even have heard the\n\nnews. It’s true. This morning, we announced that Sleepycat is joining forces\n\nwith Oracle.” The blog goes on to explain why “[] this transaction makes sense, and what we hope to accomplish by working with the\n\nworld’s leading database company.”: “We’re joining Oracle because we believe the opportunity in embedded data\n\nmanagement is too big for us to handle on our own. It’s impossible to predict\n\nthe future, but the smart money is on more computers in more places doing more\n\nthings.” And: “Last year, Oracle\n\nacquired TimesTen, another company with interesting embeddable database\n\ntechnology. […] We believe that Sleepycat and its Berkeley DB products\n\ncomplement what Oracle already owns. We think we bring depth and experience to\n\nan already remarkable team.”\n\nTo reassure many people who may have gotten worried:”We have no plans to change the open source strategy that Sleepycat pioneered,\n\nand that has been so successful for us. The Berkeley DB products will continue\n\nto be distributed under both open source and proprietary licenses. The open\n\nsource community remains a critical factor in our success. Our commitment to\n\nthat community is as strong today as it has always been. If you’re a Sleepycat customer, I think you’ll like what you see. We’ll be\n\neasier to find, we’ll be able to offer more services in more places, and we’ll\n\nhave a much wider range of products for you to choose from when you’re making\n\nyour end-to-end architecture decisions. Our product plans are unchanged. We’re\n\nstaffed up and hard at work on the features you’ve asked us to build.”\n\nOracle announced: “Oracle today (14th February 2006) announced that it has added Berkeley DB to its embedded database product line which includes Oracle Lite for mobile devices and Oracle TimesTen for high performance in-memory database applications.” The Oracle Press Release can be found here: http://www.oracle.com/corporate/press/2006_feb/sleepycat.html. It says: ““Sleepycat’s products enhance Oracle’s\n\nmarket-leading database product family by offering enterprise-class\n\nsupport to customers who need to embed a fast, reliable database at a\n\nlower cost,” said Andrew Mendelsohn, senior vice president, Oracle\n\nDatabase Server Technologies. ” The remainder of the press release: “According to Carl Olofson of IDC’s research,\n\n“The embedded database market was projected last year to be just over\n\n$2 billion in 2005 and forecasted to grow to over $3.2 billion by the\n\nyear 2009. This market is very diverse, and the technologies tend to be\n\nquite specialized. Sleepycat’s Berkeley DB complements Oracle TimesTen\n\nand Oracle Lite, allowing Oracle to address a broad range of segments\n\nwithin the embedded DBMS market.”\n\nSleepycat Software’s Berkeley DB is the most\n\nwidely used open source database in the world with deployments\n\nestimated at more than 200 million. Berkeley DB is distributed under a\n\ndual license model, i.e. available under a public license and also\n\navailable under a commercial license. Well-known open source projects\n\nsuch as the Linux and BSD UNIX operating systems, Apache web server,\n\nOpenLDAP directory, OpenOffice productivity software, and many others\n\nembed Berkeley DB technology.“\n\nTerms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\nTo give you some idea about the widespread presence of BerkeleyDB, see this comment from the SleepyCat Blog:”We conservatively estimate that there are 200 million copies of Berkeley DB\n\nrunning out there. Berkeley DB is in every copy of Linux, every distro, whether\n\nit’s server, desktop or embedded. It’s also in every copy of BSD Unix, so\n\nOpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, etc. Every copy of OpenLDAP and sendmail uses us.\n\nEvery copy of OpenOffice and StarOffice (Sun estimates 40 million are out\n\nthere). 3 million Motorola cellphones. Many copies of Movable Type, Subversion\n\nand Apache HTTP server. A small number of MySQL deployments use Berkeley DB. I\n\ncould go on…”\n\nWhy is Oracle buying SleepyCat?"
