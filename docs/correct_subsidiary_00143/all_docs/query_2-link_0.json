This market is very diverse, and the technologies tend to be quite specialized. Sleepycat's Berkeley DB complements Oracle TimesTen and Oracle Lite, allowing Oracle to address a broad range of segments within the embedded DBMS market.\"\n\nSleepycat Software's Berkeley DB is the most widely used open source database in the world with deployments estimated at more than 200 million. Berkeley DB is distributed under a dual license model, i.e. available under a public license and also available under a commercial license. Well-known open source projects such as the Linux and BSD UNIX operating systems, Apache web server, OpenLDAP directory, OpenOffice productivity software, and many others embed Berkeley DB technology.\n\nTerms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\nContact Info\n\nLetty Ledbetter\n\nOracle\n\n1.650.506.8071\n\nletty.ledbetter@oracle.com\n\nBob Wayne\n\nOracle\n\n1.650.506.5834\n\nbob.wynne@oracle.com\n\nAbout Oracle\n\nOracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) is the world's largest enterprise software company.
