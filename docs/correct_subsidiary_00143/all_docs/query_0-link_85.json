You can find the source code on Oracle's web site here in both .zip and .tar formats. The distribution includes the full source code.\n\nJust FYI: Oracle has many open source products. Source code is freely available for all of them.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm the Product Manager for Berkeley DB and have been working with the product for over 7 years, so I'm a little biased. :-)"
