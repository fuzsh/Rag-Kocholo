I'm looking for the best DB solution.\n\nI can't find much data about Berkeley DB. Most of the stuff on their website is written by the marketing dept. One of the PDFs makes it sound like it handles relational data, not just key-value pairs. I saw in a blog that it does indexing.\n\nWhere can I get some real info on this DB and how it compares to MongoDB? Data types, indexing capabilities, analytics, usage, and \"suited for...\".\n\nI am a little surprised at how little useful data is coming up in Google considering this DB is 15 years old.\n\nHere's what wikipedia has to say about it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BerkeleyDB\n\nI think the following sentence may be of particular interest:\n\n\"unlike SQLite, Berkeley DB does not support SQL or any other query language, nor does it support table schemas or table columns. SQL support was added by Oracle by including a version of SQLite in Berkeley DB\"\n\nanswered Oct 22, 2010 at 11:46\n\nuser359040user359040"
