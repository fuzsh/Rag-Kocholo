Please feel free to give a copy of the e2fsck binary to help a friend recover his or her filesystem, as the need arises. However, \"pre\" or \"WIP\" indicates that this release is under development, and available for ALPHA testing. So for your protection as much as mine, Iâd prefer that it not appear in a some distribution --- especially not a CD-ROM distribution!\n\nThe most recent officially distributed version can be found at http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net. If you need to make a distribution, thatâs the one you should use. If there is some reason why youâd like a more recent version that is still in ALPHA testing for your distribution, please contact me (tytso@mit.edu), and we will very likely be able to work out something that will work for all concerned. The release schedules for this package are flexible, if you give me enough lead time.\n\nTheodore Tsâo\n\n15-Mar-2003\n\n***************************************************************************\n\n%%The following software may be included in this product:\n\nrsh-ppc_85xx\n\nUse of this software is governed by the terms of the following license:\n\nCopyright (c) 1983, 1990 The Regents of the University of California.\n\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundationâs software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each authorâs protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authorsâ reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyoneâs free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0.
