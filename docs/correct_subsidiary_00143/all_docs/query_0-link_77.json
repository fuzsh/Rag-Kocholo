        "text": "Dear Commissioner Kroes,\n\nLast week, former MySQL CEO Mårten Mickos wrote you a letter urging approval of Oracle’s takeover of Sun Microsystems1, asserting that Oracle’s ownership of MySQL (as part of the Sun acquisition) will increase competition in the market.\n\nAs a long-time MySQL user, a former MySQL AB staff member2 and a participant in or consultant to a wide range of other open source and free software projects3, I found Mårten’s conclusion to be optimistic at best.\n\nOracle’s ownership of MySQL will lead to what the commission fears – greater costs and less choice in the DBMS market.\n\nIn making this point, I’ll challenge the three key arguments made by Mårten:\n\nMySQL and Oracle do not compete\n\nOracle has many compelling business reasons to continue the ramp-up of the MySQL business\n\nOracle’s ownership of MySQL will increase competition in the market\n\nAlso, please note that I have no financial interest in Oracle or Sun and haven’t been paid to write this article.4\n\nMySQL and Oracle Compete\n\nFirst, it is very clear that MySQL is a difficult and disruptive competitor for Oracle. Imagine yourself Oracle’s position: most of your present and future customers use MySQL at no cost, and the combination of open source communities and the commercial entities backing MySQL work in a distributed fashion to erode your key advantages and populate many niches in the market.\n\nOracle’s acquisition of Sun would provide them with a way to control this competition.\n\nWe don’t have to rely on imagination to see the competition between MySQL and Oracle. Even a cursory examination of the market leads one to the same initial conclusion reached by the commission that, “… Oracle databases and Sun’s MySQL compete directly in many sectors of the database market …”5\n\nA volume of evidence demonstrating the heated competition between Oracle and MySQL can be found online, including Oracle’s acquisitions of key pieces of technology licensed to MySQL6, benchmarks7, case studies8, migration toolkits9, presentations given by MySQL staff at the MySQL conference10, attendance of the MySQL User Conference by key Oracle management11, articles in trade publications and recently leaked Sun Microsystems internal documents12.\n\nOracle’s Compelling Business Reasons (or, Why Oracle’s Acquisition of MySQL Won’t Increase Competition)\n\nMårten wrote that, “Oracle has as many compelling business reasons to continue the ramp-up of the MySQL business as Sun Microsystems and MySQL previously did, or even more”, but did not elaborate on what these business reasons would be.\n\nWe know that Oracle will seek to use MySQL to provide maximum value to their shareholders, but this is not the same as a “compelling business reasons to continue the ramp-up of the MySQL business” nor is it the same as, “(increasing) competition in the database market.”\n\nOracle has a large and successful business. Its net income for the first fiscal quarter of 2009 was reported at 1.1bn USD13 The direct commercial value from licensing and services that it would be able to extract from MySQL would be trivial compared to this (and would likely be at a much lower margin than services and licensing it is accustomed to.)\n\nSome reasonable tactics and strategies for an Oracle who has acquired MySQL would include:\n\nUsing MySQL to price-target customers, ensuring that each customer pays as much as possible to Oracle. In the past, Oracle has reduced prices on a case-by-case basis to help retain customers who have “defected” to MySQL. The reduced competition in the marketplace will give Oracle more control, especially over large institutions who currently rely on MySQL Enterprise.\n\nUsing control of the non-software MySQL assets (such as domain names, documentation, trademarks, conferences, …) to manage competition in the MySQL space.\n\nManaging the rate of innovation in the MySQL product, so as to ensure that price-targeting can be effective.\n\nContinued support of the open source version of MySQL, so as to ensure that other open source competitors do not become prominent enough to challenge Oracle’s business.\n\nOracle will engage in strategies such as these for as long as it has a compelling business reason to do so, but certainly not out of concern for or in service to the market.\n\nClosing\n\nCommissioner Kroes, I won’t presume to advise the commission on the best path forward, however I do hope that you have a clearer view of the facts.\n\nOpen source and the market forces that supported MySQL’s rise to prominence and allowed it to compete with Oracle will exist regardless of what the commission chooses to do.\n\nIf Oracle acquires MySQL, then the market will be hindered for the next three to five years. Customers will pay higher prices. The open source community will need a few years to route around Oracle’s control. Current MySQL customers will be faced with challenges as they decide whether or not to stay with an aggressive vendor who now has much more control of a database that they often rely on to serve the online market.\n\nIf Oracle does not acquire MySQL then it will still have significant influence, as it controls a key MySQL resource in the form of InnoDB. This is something that the open source space is still wrestling with, as various engines and forks attempt to deal with the problem.\n\nIf the commission truly wants to foster competition, a middle road would be to allow Oracle to acquire MySQL on the condition that the database, engines and documentation are released under a permissive open source licence, such as the New BSD license14. This would allow Oracle to make the acquisition that it so desires without having to spin off MySQL and would foster a great deal of competition in the market, as no single party would be able to control the integration of MySQL with other products."
