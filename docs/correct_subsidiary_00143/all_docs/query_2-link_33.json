        "text": "Business software provider Oracle Corp. is considering plans to offer its own version of the Linux operating system and has studied an acquisition of Novell Inc., the open-source operating system’s No. 2 distributor, according to a newspaper report Monday.\n\nNovell shares rose 2.3 percent in Monday trading, while rival Red Hat Inc. fell 6.7 percent.\n\nRedwood Shores-based Oracle sells databases and other business applications, and by offering a version of the Linux operating system, it would be able to provide customers with a more complete suite of software. Rivals such as Microsoft Corp. and IBM Corp. commonly tout the benefits of these packages, called “stacks.”\n\nOracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison told the Financial Times that the company might launch its own version of Linux and has considered buying Linux distributor Novell. That could help counter leading Linux vendor Red Hat, which just announced a $350 million acquisition of JBoss Inc., a maker of open-source “middleware,” which connects varying applications.\n\n“I don’t think Oracle and IBM want another Microsoft in Red Hat,” Ellison told the Financial Times.\n\nOracle has spent $18 billion in the past year and a half acquiring companies in its quest to be the number one business applications provider. Most of its purchases have been application software companies, but some have been in the open source software realm. In February, it bought Sleepycat Software, maker of the Berkeley DB open source database, for an undisclosed sum. Oracle has also contributed some code development to open source platforms, including Linux, to make it work better with Oracle’s proprietary database product.\n\nA spokesman for Oracle did not return a call seeking comment. Representatives of Waltham, Mass.-based Novell and Raleigh, N.C.-based Red Hat declined to comment, as did an IBM spokesman.\n\nOracle shares rose 6 cents to close at $13.74 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.\n\nBusiness Writer Barbara Grady contributed to this report."
