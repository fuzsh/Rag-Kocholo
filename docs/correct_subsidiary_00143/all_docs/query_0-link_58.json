        "text": "Matt Asay published an article on ReadWriteWeb on what open source means for the software industry. It's a topic that's really important to me. Matt's a smart guy and I love the piece he wrote, but I can't resist weighing in on the topic myself.\n\nIn 1993, I dropped out of the PhD program at Berkeley to join Illustra, a database company created to commercialize the open source Postgres database developed under the direction of my research advisor, Mike Stonebraker. Open source software was firmly entrenched at Berkeley (the BSD License, which we used for Postgres, was drafted in the early 1980s and for a long time was the major alternative to the free software movement's GPL license), but no one at the time knew how to make money with open source software. Stonebraker followed a path that had succeeded hugely for him with the Ingres research project and company in the 1980s: He created a closed-source, proprietary variant of Postgres, and built Illustra as a traditional, closed-source software company to sell it.\n\nThree years later, Informix bought Illustra for $440M (the deal value plummeted after Informix admitted accounting irregularities over the next several quarters). It was a pretty good exit for those of us on the team. Today, though, both Informix and the Illustra product have disappeared into the mist. The Postgres open source project, now called PostgreSQL, continues to thrive, but approximately no one makes money from it.\n\nIn 1998, I joined Sleepycat, makers of the embedded open source database Berkeley DB. We had a novel technique for making money (it was invented by Sleepycat founder Keith Bostic, and adopted by a number of other companies). Called \"dual licensing,\" our model let you combine our software with your own, as long as you gave your source code away, too. If you didn't want to do that, you could pay us for a different license, and keep your product source code secret. We built a nice little business that way. Sleepycat was acquired by Oracle in 2006.\n\nThe period from 1995 to about 2005 saw lots of companies experiment with business models based on open source. Red Hat offered enterprise buyers a subscription, backed by its cloud-based management and administrative infrastructure, to Linux. MySQL offered enterprise support contracts on its open source database, combined with dual licensing of its client libraries for OEMs. Some companies sold people by the hour, delivering consulting services on open source packages; others gave away source code for old versions but charged for the closed-source newest release.\n\nThe list of successful stand-alone open source vendors that emerged over that period is easy to write, because the only company on it is Red Hat. The rest have failed to scale or been swallowed. Sleepycat is at Oracle, MySQL is at Oracle by way of Sun, JBoss is at Red Hat, SpringSource is at Pivotal by way of VMware. And so on.\n\nThe moral of that story is that it's pretty hard to build a successful, stand-alone open source company. Notably, no support- or services-only business model has ever made the cut. Red Hat, the apparent exception, isn't: The company rode its closed-source Red Hat Network offering to dominance, effectively crushing the competition before releasing that hosted infrastructure as open source in 2008.\n\nSeparately, but simultaneously, there's been a stunning and irreversible trend in enterprise infrastructure. If you're operating a data center, you're almost certainly using an open source operating system, database, middleware and other plumbing. No dominant platform-level software infrastructure has emerged in the last ten years in closed-source, proprietary form.\n\nThis is despite huge investment and tremendous efforts by traditional closed-source vendors to hold back the IP tide. Microsoft famously declared open source a cancer in 2001; in 2013, you can run Linux instead of Windows on Microsoft's cloud offering, Azure. VMware, one of my favorite product-driven companies, was the only player worth mentioning with virtualization in 2002; today, open source alternatives like KVM, Xen, CloudStack and Eucalyptus have forced VMware to give server virtualization away for free, and to find its revenues elsewhere.\n\nSo here is the conundrum facing enterprise infrastructure software companies: You can no longer win with a closed-source platform, and you can't build a successful stand-alone company purely on open source.\n\nAt Cloudera, we are committed to open source software, and we intend to build a successful stand-alone company. We've chosen a business model that we think will satisfy both the commitment and the intent.\n\nWe believe deeply, and invest significantly, in open source software. We don't merely ingest code from the open source community. We contribute.\n\nWe are a substantial creator of new projects. Since our inception in 2008, we've created new projects like Sqoop, Flume, Hue, Impala, Whirr and Sentry to extend the Hadoop ecosystem. Most of those are now essential components in the platform software that our competitors offer.\n\nWe contribute in a big way to projects we didn't create. We make huge contributions to the collection of Hadoop ecosystem projects. We work very hard to be a valuable and engaged member of that community. We're really proud of the work that we do there.\n\nFor Cloudera, the key strategic observation is that platform software has to be open source. That's not just talk -- for the last five years, we've walked the walk. It's not an empty marketing promise when we say that we'll always make our platform open source. It's what we do. It's critical to our success.\n\nBut pure-play open source companies never survive. That's a law of nature.\n\nThe problem with a services- or support-only model is that as soon as a vendor demonstrates that there's reasonable money in the market -- by the time its revenues get to between $20M and $50M annually -- it attracts the attention of smart programmers in China, India, Eastern Europe and other places where education is high and wages are relatively low. Smart engineers able to work for ten cents on the dollar have complete access to all the source code. They're able to compete for those contracts and to spend much less servicing them if they win.\n\nPure-play open source vendors are in a race to zero on price.\n\nYou may say to yourself: \"Hey, free software and super-cheap services! Customers win!\" But I don't think so.\n\nThe problem is, for infrastructure software especially, continued innovation is critical. If you're rolling out plumbing in your data center, and you're going to run your business on it, you need to believe that it'll be there ten years hence. You need to know that it'll grow with your company and your requirements. You need someone able to invest significantly not just in maintaining it, but in making it steadily better. It is good for the industry that Red Hat makes better than a billion dollars a year, because Red Hat turns money into steadily better Linux.\n\nAccordingly, at Cloudera, we believe we need to build value -- real, differentiated intellectual property that makes customers successful -- as part of a closed-source, proprietary IP portfolio. We can't do it at the platform level, because platform software has to be open source. We need to look elsewhere, at complementary tools and layered offerings that let customers run that pure open source platform better, more affordably, getting more value out of it.\n\nThe complexion of that closed-source portfolio will change over time. We started out with closed-source monitoring, management and administrative tooling, because we had an unfair advantage in expertise in those areas, and because our enterprise customers wanted it. In the long term, the quality of our dashboards won't separate us from the market, and it may well be that we open source some or all of that management framework. We will, over time, add new IP to that portfolio.\n\nWe want customers to have a unique reason to buy from us. We can't lock them into our platform, because it's open source. We can't lock up their data or their analyses or their processing pipelines -- that's all handled by software in the Hadoop ecosystem. We can, though, create reasons for them to choose our open source platform above others, by delivering unique advantages in our product.\n\nThat defensible position in the market allows us to attract more customers than a purely-on-price, just-the-open-source-bits vendor headquartered in a remote, emerging economy. We'll win a bigger revenue stream that we can turn into a better customer experience, and into better Hadoop. We can continue to drive the standard in enterprise big data, creating the projects that the broad market embraces.\n\nYou'll continue to see successful closed-source apps and tools companies, but the age of closed-source enterprise infrastructure is over. Cloudera's model -- the successful model, we believe, for the next twenty years -- is a pragmatic blend of open source platform with complementary, closed-source IP for differentiation."
