Spanning 600 square meters, the DFS stand will encompass a comprehensive range of pioneering clean energy products, innovative fuel dispensers, retail automation products, cloud technologies, payment solutions (including Prizma, the DFS Self-Checkout Kiosk), wetstock solutions and automatic tank gauging (ATG) products, as well as showcasing various industry partnerships.\n\nVisitors can expect to be wowed – on stand 5C10 in hall 5 – by the extensive range of products and solutions, but most importantly their ability to connect with each other. Visitors to DFS stand 5C10 will also be able to experience, first-hand, some of DFS’ brand-new, never-before-seen products and solutions, which will be launching exclusively at the event.\n\n“After the success of UNITI expo 2022, I am very excited to present the latest products and solutions from the DFS family of brands, including those resulting from our new industry partnerships, to our customers and channel partners in Europe,” noted David Crouse, President of DFS. “By bringing together the collective experience, knowledge and talent behind some the most trusted names in the industry, we have created an organization capable of providing an unparalleled and complete end-to-end retail forecourt solution. Making connections, through an end-to-end fuel retail offering, can add credible value to your success. At UNITI expo 2024, we want to help retailers achieve a forecourt that unites your products and solutions. I am also very proud to say we are continuing to develop as an organization, looking into the future and creating products and solutions that can help future-proof our customers’ and industry partners’ businesses.”\n\nAmong the brand-new products and solutions DFS will showcase at UNITI expo 2024, visitors can expect to see: the EMEA dispenser range – featuring the Tokheim Quantium®, Wayne Helix®, and Wayne Century™ 3 fuel dispenser families; the DFS Hydrogen dispenser; DX Power™; Prizma; DFS Fusion® automation server V3; the DFS DX™ connected solutions platform – including DX Wetstock®, DX Retail® and DX Monitor®; the DFS ONE Portal cloud services platform; T-Media™ by Dover Fueling Solutions®; the Tokheim Crypto VGA® OPT (Outdoor Payment Terminal); the DFS Self-Checkout Kiosk; the ProGauge MagLink LX family of tank gauge consoles; and the DFS DMP Magnetostrictive family of probes.\n\nKurt Dillen, Vice President and General Manager of the EMEA and SAIL regions at DFS, added, “Within DFS we have different Business Units and all of them are delivering super interesting new products and solutions. At this year’s UNITI expo, we have a long and fascinating story to tell our customers and partners about why we are product leaders, and we can prove this with our new projects.”\n\nDFS experts will also lead two seminars at the UNITI expo International Forum. On 14th May at 11:00 am, David Mc Guinness, Director of Product Management, Electric Vehicle Charging, will present, “EV Charging Payment Regulations and Forecourt Integration”. On 15th May at 11:00am, Joost Jansen, Business Development Manager, and Simon Keuschnig, Key Account Manager, will present, “Clean Energy – Evolution or Revolution?”. These sessions are available free of charge to UNITI expo visitors.\n\nIf you plan on attending UNITI expo 2024 , make sure you join DFS for live demonstrations and in-depth product discussions at stand 5C10 (Hall 5), where you’ll have the opportunity to experience the future of fuel retail with DFS products and solutions spanning customer loyalty, payment, alternative energy, media and more.
