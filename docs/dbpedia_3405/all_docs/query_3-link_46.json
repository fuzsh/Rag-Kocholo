We look forward to collaborating with TSG at many more exhibitions in the future.”\n\nDFS encourages attendees to stop by stand W129 to find out more about how both businesses are working together to provide a comprehensive solution to the fuel retailing market. Among additional DFS products and solutions, visitors can expect to see:\n\nThe Tokheim Fuel POS® point-of-sale system;\n\nThe Fairbanks Station Manager 365 online web portal and its 24/7 real-time wetstock monitoring service; and,\n\nThe ProGauge MagLink LX console and wired and wireless magnetostrictive probes.\n\nIn addition, the Forecourt Show will provide the ideal platform for DFS to launch its new dispenser range: the Tokheim QuantiumTM 510M.
