        "text": "an international retail petroleum news digest erpecnews european edition www.erpecnews.com Initial public offering of Statoil’s energy and retail business on Oslo Stock Exchange Statoil’s Board of Directors has decided to start a process to list its energy and retail business on the Oslo Stock Exchange. Statoil’s energy and retail business includes service stations in eight countries. Further to the announcement Shell to exit 35 percent petrol stations worldwide Royal Dutch Shell has announced sweeping changes by outlining plans to raise performance and reduce costs in a bid to save US $ 1 billion and bring itself to a surplus cash flow position by 2012. The company said that it would increase its oil production by 11 percent from 2009 levels over the next two years, exit 35 percent of its petrol pumps worldwide, reduce refining capacity by 15 percent, cut around 2 000 jobs by end of 2011, that would save US $ 1 billion this year. It also plans to sell non-core assets worth US $ 1 – 3 billion a year. Peter Voser, CEO of the Netherlands-based Oil Major said, “The company had become too Behind every successful forecourt Our innovative product range includes a complete package of powerful and efficient tools to run and operate a successful forecourt. made on the 3rd of February 2010, Statoil’s Board of Directors has approved the proposal to create a stand-alone Energy & Retail (E&R) business through an initial public offering (IPO) on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The IPO will take place at the earliest in the fourth quarter of 2010 or at a time when the capital market is deemed favourable for such an offering. Statoil intends to remain a majority shareholder of E&R at the time of the initial public offering and listing. The size and time horizon of Statoil’s future ownership in E&R will be tailored to support and develop company value both for E&R and for the Statoil Group. complicated and slower to respond than we’d like. So we are sharpening up.” With a focus on operating performance, asset performance and operating costs, Shell will undertake to sell assets worth US $ 1 – 3 billion a year as it seeks to exit from non-core positions across the company. Voser feels that the company’s petrol retailing and marketing operation, which has a presence in more than 100 countries, are too scattered and not focused enough on profitability and growth and hence plans to exit from 35 percent of its petrol stations worldwide and remain only in 30 of the 90 countries in which it operates. powerful business tools. Issue No 19 | April 2010 Carrefour France to supply food to TOTAL Carrefour and TOTal are reportedly in talks regarding an agreement for Carrefour to supply food in some TOTal petrol stations “The deal could be concluded in the coming weeks”, said a source close to the matter, while stating that “the contract is not finalised yet.” This agreement would cover some 2 000 petrol stations of the 4 500 that TOTal runs. The petrol stations would retain their current name as the agreement is only for the supply and not for the management of the petrol stations. Such a partnership would not be totally new for Carrefour, the latter having already established its 8 à Huit neighbourhood banner in BP’s network of stations. With the contract, Carrefour could sell considerable volumes of non-alcoholic drinks, snacks and confectionery, giving its buying office a better position to negotiate with its suppliers.
