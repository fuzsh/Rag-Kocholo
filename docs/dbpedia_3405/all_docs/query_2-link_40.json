It has grown to the point SVI now produces its own line of fuel transfer pumps for consumer use.\n\nSVI is a premier and well-known supplier of replacement parts for Gasboy and Tokheim Pumps\n\nSVI has supported the most well-known petroleum equipment companies with a wide array of products beginning in 1977. Since the 1920s, Gasboy Consumer Series pumps have been safely and reliably distributing fuel for farmers and other single location fuel needs. Gasboy Pumps are so well-made that even some of the original pumps – now nearly 100 years old – are still in service. That is why SVI offers repair parts for Gasboy and Tokheim.\n\nCurrently, Gasboy is known as Gasboy International. Gasboy was purchased by Tokheim in 2002, making it a part of the Gilbarco family of companies. Gasboy’s bread and butter is still in commercial and fleet dispensers, but they also manufacture retail fuel dispensers which are used for trade. Gasboy’s pumps are made using high-quality parts, and SVI’s replacement parts spare no expense. SVI’s parts meet or exceed the original parts used, meaning that these examples of American made pride remain in use today. SVI was made aware of a lack of replacement parts for these pumps and began manufacturing repair parts for Gasboy and Tokheim pumps. SVI stocks repair parts for all Consumer Series Gasboy / Tokheim Pumps\n\nGasboy pumps can be found all around the globe, at both public fueling facilities, and fleet facilities. Fleet facilities, such as golf courses, are locations that fleets, or many vehicles belonging to a business entity, can refuel their vehicles. Gasboy pumps are most often used to transfer common fuel sources such as gasoline and diesel. Yet, there are also other pump models designed to transfer alternative fuels such as E85, Natural Gas, Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF), Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), and even electricity for electric vehicles.\n\nGasboy’s roots began in the early 1800s, but it was not until the 1920’s that petroleum equipment became the focus of the company. In 1928 the name Gasboy was officially used when they manufactured their first pump. Soon after, in the 1930s Gasboy created their first pump and tank package, which was marketed towards farmers needing fuel for their machinery. This was truly the beginning of Gasboy’s legacy and innovative solutions, which solved the needs of many customers across the United States. Gasboy has since been known as an industry leader, always pushing the progression of fuel management systems and fleet dispensers.\n\nSVI strongly believes in both the economic and practical reasons for keeping great equipment in service. That is why, at the encouragement of petroleum industry distributors, we have “recontinued” repair parts for the Gasboy brand for consumers and are now the sole provider of Gasboy / Tokheim repair parts and kits for these signature Consumer Series pumps.\n\nIn many ways, the Gasboy story symbolizes the values and commitment we live every day at SVI. Whether you want to maintain an automotive lift or you are seeking repair parts for your reliable Gasboy pump, SVI can make it happen. Over the years SVI has become a premier supplier of repair products and new equipment to the industries we serve, including automotive, hydraulic, petroleum, and lubrication. Our respect for the iconic Gasboy pump means SVI will keep this great brand alive! SVI is your answer."
