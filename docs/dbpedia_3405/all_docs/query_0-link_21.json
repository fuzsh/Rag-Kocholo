        "text": "Market Overview of Global Gas Station Equipment market: According to our latest research, the global Gas Station Equipment market looks promising in the next 5 years. As of 2022, the global Gas Station Equipment market was estimated at USD 6892.97 million, and it‚Äôs anticipated to reach USD 9520.55 million in 2028, with a CAGR of 5.53% during the forecast years. Gas station equipment is a big category of products made exclusively for gas stations. Products associated with gas stations usually include fuel dispensers, pumps, tanks, equipment for convenience stores, hose, meters, and nozzles. These devices are required for a gas station to run smoothly and supply gas precisely. Automation equipment is one of the development trends Convenience and speed are the basic requirements of customers for refueling services, but it largely depends on advanced automated service equipment. Taking refueling machines as an example, from single-gun, double-gun refueling machines to multi-gun refueling machines, and then to the emergence of self-service refueling machines, it reflects the important role of modern technology applications in improving the \"convenience and speed\" of refueling services. In addition, with the increasingly fierce competition in gas stations, gas station operators can improve management efficiency and reduce operating costs by increasing investment in automation equipment, thereby gaining a competitive advantage. Drive the market development with the expansion of the tourism industry The travel and tourism industry around the world has experienced a massive expansion. Thanks to increased disposable income and easy access to information about places, hotels, planes, trains and buses via the Internet, many middle-class people are able to travel to new tourist attractions. Tour and vacation package costs declined due to increased competition among travel agencies globally. Due to the increase in tourism, the demand for transportation services is also increasing globally. Ultimately, this affects demand for fuel and gas stations. Hence, this will drive an increase in the market demand for Gas Station Equipment. Region Overview: In 2021, the share of the Gas Station Equipment market in Asia Pacific stood at 36.68%. Company Overview: The major players operating in the Gas Station Equipment market include Dover Fueling Solutions (DFS), Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Tatsuno, Jiangsu Furen Group, Censtar, etc. Among which, Dover Fueling Solutions (DFS) ranked top in terms of sales and revenue in 2022. Dover Fueling Solutions (DFS) is a leading global provider of advanced customer-focused technologies, services and solutions in the fuel and convenience retail industries.

Gilbarco Veeder-Root is a supplier of fuel dispensers, point of sales systems, payment systems, forecourt merchandising and support services. Segmentation Overview: As for product types, the Fuel Dispensers segment held the largest market share in 2021. Tanks are used in Gas Stations to store fuel. Fuel Dispensers is a machine at a Gas Station that is used to pump gasoline (petrol), diesel, or other types of liquid fuel into vehicles. Nozzles are attached to the pump with flexible hoses, so they can reach the vehicle's filler inlet. Nozzles are usually color-coded to indicate which grade of fuel they dispense, but the color-coding differs between countries and even retailers. Pump is a machine that transports fluid or pressurizes fluid. Pump is mainly used to deliver fuel in Gas Station. A hose is a flexible hollow tube designed to carry fluids from one location to another. Application Overview: By application, the For Diesel segment occupied the biggest share from 2017 to 2022. This report covers a research time span from 2018 to 2028, and presents a deep and comprehensive analysis of the global Gas Station Equipment market, with a systematical description of the status quo and trends of the whole market, a close look into the competitive landscape of the major players, and a detailed elaboration on segment markets by type, by application and by region."
