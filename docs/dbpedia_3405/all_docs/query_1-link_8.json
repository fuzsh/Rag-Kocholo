        "text": "PES along with Future Energy Solutions had the pleasure of helping Gull New Zealand Ltd, using our Tokheim 3D Laser scanner this week. Gull now has an accurate picture of the size of their tanks underground, as well as accurate dipsticks and strapping charts for their ATG systems. They will now have the most accurate fuel stock management which will help them immensely with fuel reconciliations! The Tokheim 3D Laser scanner was used safely while product was still in the tank so that there was no disruption to the fuel site while the scan was being performed. If you need accurate fuel wet stock management, accurate dipsticks or accurate strapping charts for your fuel site then get in touch with the team at PES today!"
