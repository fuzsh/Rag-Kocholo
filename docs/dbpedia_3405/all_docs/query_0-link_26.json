A few days later Dresser Wayne confirmed the acquisition of the Rohé subsidiaries in Poland, Hungary, and Czech Republic. Dresser Wayne also intends to complete the acquisition of the shares owned by A. Rohé Holding in Rohé Slovakia and Bach-Rohé in Switzerland over the coming weeks. It’s President EMEA said “Rohé has been a very strong service provider to fuel forecourts across the region and Dresser Wayne are committed to maintaining the highest levels of customer service as we integrate the Rohé operations into our existing European business,” Commenting on the Tokheim acquisition Baudouin de la Tour, COO of Tokheim Group S.A.S said, “We believe that this acquisition further enhances Tokheim’s global service network and offers opportunities that, with the commitment of stable existing local management teams with excellent track records, will benefit these new businesses and their customers”. It must be considered a sad day for Rohé which had grown over the last 20 years on the back of the major multi-national oil companies stretching out to the furthest parts of Eastern Europe, to embrace the emerging markets of the former Eastern block. In the end it seems that it may have paid the price of being in too many countries at the wrong time, however their ground breaking input into the development of some Eastern markets should not be forgotten. OMV and Doðan Holding will continue existing partnership in Petrol Ofisi OMV and Turkish company Doðan Holding have terminated negotiations regarding OMV’s potential acquisition of Doðan Holding’s shares in Petrol Ofisi. Both partners had stated from the beginning that a continuation of the existing partnership may be a possible outcome of the negotiations and both companies have now agreed to continue their partnership. Petrol Ofisi is Turkey’s leading refined oil products marketing company, active both in the retail and commercial business. OMV entered the Turkish market in 2006 by acquiring 34 percent of Petrol Ofisi and has since increased its stake to 41.58 percent. Doðan Holding, owns 54.17 percent.
