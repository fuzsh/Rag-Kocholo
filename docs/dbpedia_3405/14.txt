Tokheim announced that it has entered into an agreement with Dover Corporation, pursuant to which Dover has made a binding offer to acquire Tokheims Dispenser and System businesses. The Tokheim Sales and Service Divisions are not a part of this transaction and will become a stand-alone company remaining with its current owners. The transaction is subject to completion of information and consultation with certain of Tokheims employee representatives, certain regulatory filings and other customary conditions, and is expected to close in early 2016.

Headquartered in Paris, France, Tokheim is a global manufacturer of fuel dispensing and automation equipment, including a complete range of fuel dispensers and pumps, retail automation systems, payment terminals, media devices, as well as the leading Sales and Service organisation in the fuel retail industry. Tokheims majority shareholder is Motion Equity Partners, a European mid-market private equity firm.

Dover is a diversified global manufacturer delivering innovative equipment and components, specialty systems and support services through four major operating segments: Energy, Engineered Systems, Fluids, and Refrigeration & Food Equipment. The Tokheim Businesses would become part of OPW, a business unit within Dovers Fluids segment, making it the premier global retail fueling systems provider, with unrivalled product breadth.

We are excited about the strategic fit of Tokheims Dispenser and System businesses within Dovers OPW business, as well as how a strong partnership with the merged entity will enhance the growth of our remaining Sales and Service businesses said Baudouin de la Tour, CEO of Tokheim. We strongly believe both our customers and employees will greatly benefit from this unique ability to provide full solutions on a global scale.

After years of sustained organic growth and geographical expansion, we found in Dover a great company to successfully pursue the global strategy of the Dispenser and System businesses added Patrick Eisenchteter, Managing Partner of Motion Equity Partner.
