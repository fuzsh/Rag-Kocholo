Post-punk revival (also known as indie rock revival)[1] is a genre or movement of indie rock that emerged in the early 2000s as musicians started to play a stripped down and back-to-basics version of guitar rock inspired by the original sounds and aesthetics of post-punk, new wave and garage rock.[2][3] It is closely associated with new wave revival[4] and garage rock revival.[3][5]
