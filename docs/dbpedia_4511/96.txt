The post-punk revival was a movement which primarily took place in the first decade of the 21st century. It was a return of indie rock that was inspired by the garage rock of the 1960s as well as the new wave and post-punk music of the late 1970s and early 1980s.

This list was created by aggregating 11 lists focused on the best albums of the post-punk revival. Other albums not featured on those lists, but by artists featured on those lists were also factored in. In addition, albums by artists mentioned as prominent in the movement who did not have albums on one of the lists were included. Only albums released between 2000 and 2010 were considered. Finally, all qualifying albums were then ranked according to their overall status in Dave’s Music Database.
