        "text": "I really loved last week's intro, so I thought of another great song with a great intro...\n\nWith this band I heard for the first time the genre \"post-punk-revival\". What a name for a genre, right? sounds cool... can be catchy... but normal people call this as indie but of course with a \"70's vintage\" influence (Aha! I bet you were not expecting this definition... which is even worse than the post-punk-revival). But, let's analyse that name and you will see that what I said has much more sense and less silliness.\n\nFirst of all, Post-punk. This part kind of has sense, you consider is not anymore the punk era so you are part of the post punk era.... But! you play punk, ok? Are you following me?.\n\nNow, revival... Here is when you start becoming like Jesus (the beard guy, but not the Walk off the earth one. Just the one who was awesome with magic finger tricks in his era as it was explained in Family Guy. I write too much between parenthesis, sorry!). I think we all know the timeless phrase \"Punk's not Dead\", right? So as a revival, you came back from death... which also makes you the saviour of the punks(?)... or we can make it even worse... You're not the beard guy, you are HIS FATHER (careful quoting Darth Vader please, we are way off topic now to introduce a new comrade in this analysis and we are taking this seriously...) and you have the power to bring punk back to life and title it as a revival.\n\nDon't make me start we Creedence Clearwater Revival, because it is quantum music, okay?\n\nGoing back to normal blog posting, The Libertines gives us a nice variety of rhythms related to that old punk honouring their fathers (The Sex Pistols... We can go back to the last paragraph and name them as the Punk's God...but...no).\n\nLet's Enjoy a bit of this post-punk-revival/modern-punk-vintage or whatever name will come up to your mind. It's music. Love it.\n\nFollow us on social:\n\nYou can learn more about The Libertines here:\n\nAbout the curator - Rodrigo Medrano\n\nAt a very early age, music had an incredible impact on Rodrigo’s life. He was never able to listen to lullaby songs; instead he was served Guns n’ Roses and Aerosmith for breakfast, lunch and dinner.\n\nAt the age of 12, he became a melomaniac, collecting albums, EP’s, recording sessions, and researching every kind of genre. All this helped him to get his first job at a recording studio where he realized his life would forever revolve around sound and music.\n\nWorking on cruise ships as First Audio Technician allowed him to let loose his passion and expand his knowledge on psychoacoustics, eventually promoted up to being in charge of sound for the hit broadway shows: Rock of Ages and Burn The Floor.\n\nHis music library will never stop growing as his melomania will get worse and worse."
