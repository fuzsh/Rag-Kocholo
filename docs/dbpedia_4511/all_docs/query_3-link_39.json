        "text": "Talking Heads\n\nI’ve noticed a recent surge of interest in ‘80s culture with a return to the fashion and particularly the music of the time. Clubs are having ‘80s nights, and many cafes around the city are playing the defining bands of the most animated and colorful decade of the 20th century. This ultimately means a revisit to new wave music and its history, which is important not just because it’s my favorite genre of music, but also because it laid the groundwork for contemporary pop music.\n\nNew wave has its roots in punk. Some consider it to be the same genre as post-punk; others contend that punk branched out into either new wave or post-punk, and some people argue that post-punk is not a genre at all but a way for critics to categorize bands that don’t fit into the criteria of punk. My point is, definitions regarding music genres are highly subjective, and it is often impossible to effectively assign one genre to a certain sound. Bands like Blondie or Talking Heads are considered by some to be punk, by others to be new wave or post-punk. For the sake of avoiding confusion, I will first focus on the distinction between punk and new wave, then the distinction between new wave and post-punk.\n\nA Brief Look into Punk\n\nPunk emerged out of a rejection of mainstream ‘70s rock; “No Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones in 1977” declares The Clash frontman Joe Strummer in “1977”, a fitting slogan for the genre. First described as garage rock and influenced by glam rock from the ‘60s, punk is characterized by stripped, back-to-basics instrumentation and lively, fast-paced songs. Think “I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend” by the Ramones, or “God Save the Queen” by the Sex Pistols.\n\nThese two bands are indeed the two defining bands of early punk. The Ramones pioneered American punk while the Sex Pistols dominated the scene across the pond. American punk is distinct from British punk in that British punk had more political and rebellious roots, but such aspects soon became foundational for punk no matter the country of origin. An overarching theme of anti-establishment sentiment in lyricism became the key feature of any punk song. It all stemmed from an opposition towards the commodification of culture, rejecting the elitism surrounding stadium rock and the need for technical skill in a musician. The whole genre can be summarized as a “raw sound, fueled in part by an anarchic reading of 1960s garage rock and in part by a subversive political bent fashioned out of art school experimentation”[(1)].\n\nDivergence from Punk: The Birth of New Wave\n\nWhile punk was a full-blown sensation across the UK, it remained underground in the US because of its unorthodox messages. It was seen as too confrontational and therefore unmarketable for American mainstream radio. Instead, broadcast media shifted its focus onto more acceptable new wave artists.\n\nNew wave was born out of a response to punk and came to dominate the late ‘70s and the ‘80s. New wave artists believed punk should be subjected to constant change, saying “radical content demands radical form”[(2)]. Not only did new wave reject the abundance of mainstream rockstars like punk did, but it also renewed and modernized punk. Lyrics from the song “Rip It Up” by Orange Juice, one of the earlier new wave bands, have been used to describe the aim of new wave: “rip it up and start again”.\n\nSome see new wave as the result of punk’s “cleansing” of pop music in the late ‘70s, which was mainly rock & roll and disco, while others argue that it was the next big genre after “the death of punk”. However, punk was still alive in the late ‘90s and early ‘00s with bands like Green Day and Blink-182, so what’s more accurate to say is that while punk took a dip in the ‘80s, new wave was on the rise.\n\nThe Sound of New Wave\n\nBoth punk and new wave were rebellious and wanted to distinguish themselves and stand out, but that’s about all the similarities they have. While punk aimed to return to a simpler, purer rock sound, new wave incorporated elements of other genres like disco and electronic into rock music with bands like Depeche Mode (“Just Can’t Get Enough”), Tears for Fears (“Everybody Wants to Rule the World”) and Siouxsie and the Banshees (“Cities in Dust”).\n\nA dance beat was integral to new wave; it drew from a direct, bustling energy contained within rock that had been lost in the ‘70s. To counter the contemplative and arduous tempos of Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, new wave offered the cheery and bouncy beats of The Cure (“Boys Don’t Cry”) and New Order (“Bizarre Love Triangle”).\n\nIn terms of lyricism, new wave stayed true to punk with many songs concerned with feelings of alienation, repression and anti-establishment attitudes. However, new wave is seen as more complex not only in its musical production but also in its lyrical content, thus endorsing the view that new wave is more or less Punk 2.0.\n\nThe Look of New Wave\n\nNew wave artists were also known for their eccentric sense of fashion. Much of ‘80s fashion as we know it stems from new wave’s combining of punk fashion with more flashy and unconventional looks.\n\nPunk fashion, much like punk music, was simplistic and bare. While bands like Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones donned elaborate costumes for the stadium performances, punk bands opted for simple black Levi’s, T-shirts and leather jackets.\n\nNew wave added an avant-garde twist to this aspect of punk fashion. For women, this meant mismatched, colorful tops with fishnets and lace, as well as statement jewelry.\n\nFor men, the more classical look included bold haircuts, leather jackets and eyeliner.\n\nAlthough, other all-male bands chose to take things a bit further with colorful, layered outfits and flashier makeup:\n\nAll in all, nothing was off-limits. As with new wave music, new wave fashion was experimental, distinctive and eccentric. With the rise of MTV and music videos, style became an inseparable part of music. The Buggles and their single “Video Killed the Radio Star” was the first music video to be aired on MTV in the US in 1981, and as one of the earlier new wave bands, the bright silver suits, sunglasses and shoulder pads seen in the video set the standard for future new wave artists.\n\nNew Wave or Post-Punk?\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, new wave is often considered synonymous with post-punk. The problem with the term “post-punk” is that a lot of bands categorized into this genre existed at the same time as punk. For instance, one of the most famous post-punk bands Siouxsie and the Banshees were making music in as early as 1976, at the height of punk. So, it doesn’t really make sense to label them post-punk.\n\nOthers hold the view that punk branched out into new wave and post-punk as two distinct genres. The argument is that in the late ‘70s the two terms were interchangeable, but by the turn of the decade the more avant-garde and “edgy” bands diverged into post-punk, and new wave became more synth-driven and pop-oriented. New wave was reduced by British critics in the early ‘80s to synthpop, while post-punk was seen to have a darker and grittier tone that strayed away from pop. Bands like the Smiths and Velvet Underground have a more subdued and mellow sound, with songs like “There Is a Light That Never Goes Out” and “Heroin”, respectively. Although, it is important to note that despite this divergence, there is still significant overlap between the two genres; there isn’t a clear-cut line dividing new wave and post-punk.\n\nTop 5 New Wave Artists\n\nNow that we’ve established what new wave is, it’s time to take a look at specific new wave artists. Here are my top five bands excluding New Order, which ought to be on the list but isn’t in order to avoid repetition:\n\n5. Culture Club\n\nHonorable mentions: Tears for Fears, The Smiths, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and Duran Duran\n\nNew Wave of New Wave\n\nThe popularity of new wave declined at the turn of the decade with the emergence of genres like metal, grunge and hip hop. Although, it has had a comeback since then, which is referred to as post-punk revival, but by now you know of my dislike of the term so we’ll call it new-wave revival.\n\nIn the early 2000s, local music scenes saw the commercial breakthrough of the Bravery, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and the Strokes, all bands that drew from new wave. The revival provided a retro sound and a slight experimental rebelliousness paying homage to the greatest the ‘80s had to offer. Bands like Interpol, Franz Ferdinand and the Libertines were influenced by a more rock-oriented style, while the Killers and LCD Soundsystem were rich in synths. Most of these bands are inactive today, which goes to show that the revival was short-lived. This doesn’t mean it wasn’t impactful; “Mr. Brightside” by the Killers has been on the UK Top 100 charts since its release 15 years ago.\n\nSome personal revival favorites include:\n\n“An Honest Mistake” by the Bravery — a perfect blend of rock and synths reminiscent of New Order\n\n“Sacrilege” by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs — heavy bass and drum beats leading into a gospel choir that is pushed to the foreground at the climax of the song\n\n“Read My Mind” by the Killers — starts with a small synth melody, slowly building up to a steady, mid-paced beat and prominent guitars\n\nThe Legacy of New Wave\n\nAside from being one of the definitive genres of ‘80s music, the greatest feat of new wave was introducing the synthesizer into the mainstream. We can still see the impacts of this today; much of contemporary pop and hip hop music is heavily synthesized.\n\nLike I said, with recent growing interest in elements of ‘80s culture, it is only fair that we take a look at the greatest genre of the decade. New wave is exciting, experimental, and ever-changing; it would be a shame not to revisit it every once in a while. Right now it might be swept under the rug, but I say it is only on temporary hiatus, perhaps awaiting a renaissance in a couple years’ time.\n\n[(1)] Theo Cateforis, Are We Not New Wave?: Modern Pop at the Turn of the 1980s (2014)"
