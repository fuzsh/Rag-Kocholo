        "text": "Remember the post-punk revival of the noughties? It wasn’t very post-punk, was it? Music publications roared over the supposed rebirth of the genre when The Killers, Interpol, Bloc Party, Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand made their breakthroughs. But the traits synonymous with post-punk were completely absent. Where was the nihilism? The fusion of avant-garde genres? The atonal sounds?\n\nApart from a few post-punk-lite tropes that these bands touched base on (energy, vocal mimicry, choppy rhythms), the music from this era was not a true reflection of the genre which emerged in the late 1970s. When they did make more blatant references, it played off as a diluted replication of the genres cliches.\n\nHowever, in the 2010s, a whole slew of authentic and essential post-punk revivalists started to make a lot of racket in the U.K, the U.S, Southern/Eastern Europe and Scandinavia. Just in case you’re late to the post-punk party, we have curated a playlist of all the essential artists from this fresh wave of post-punks. Listen below to track this decades post-punk revival, from the exciting emergence of the Copenhagen scene, right the way through to the English soundtrack to austerity measures."
