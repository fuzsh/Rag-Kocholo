        "text": "(also known as Garage Rock Revival, New Wave Revival, New Rock Revolution)\n\nThere are some things that are glamorous and sell well, but without being the best!\n\nHow it sounds\n\nLike Indie Rock, which wants to be the Garage Rock of the ’60s, but eventually gets more elements from Post-punk and New Wave of the following decades.\n\nIt is generally what is generally called modern rock and is heard on the radio.\n\nWhy listen to it\n\nBecause it is fresh and we generally hear it, whether we like it or not.\n\nBut it is also the genre that brought Rock back to the forefront and some of the biggest names belong to it.\n\nWhy not\n\nExtremely mainstream, very (radio) broadcasting, and easily gains the attention of musically irrelevant.\n\nIt basically does not express anything, it just sells a lot.\n\nWhere we meet it\n\nThe USA and Europe\n\nWhen did it start\n\nLate 90s early ‘00s\n\nWho are the pioneers\n\nThe Detroit Rock scene was triggered by the White Stripes and the Von Bondies.\n\nBut also local scenes in Ohio with the Black Keys and in New York with the Strokes, Interpol, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, TV On the Radio, LCD Soundsystem, the Walkmen, the Rapture.\n\nOn the West Coast, in the Los Angeles & San Francisco stage, the scepter is held by the Brian Jonestown Massacre, and The Dandy Warhols.\n\nYou have to listen\n\nBlack Midi, Squid, Black Country, New Road, Dry Cleaning, Shame, Sleaford Mods, Fontaines D.C., Idles, Silversun Pickups, Liars, Algiers, Babyshambles, The Black Angels, Bloc Party, Cold War Kids, Glasvegas, The xx.\n\nOr you just turn on the radio to listen to dozens of bands. And of course, the Top Ten of each country, in which you will find many more.\n\nDays of glory\n\nFor two decades this species has been the “goose that lays golden eggs” for record labels.\n\nThe most popular and the most commercial species and its glory will probably last for a long time, even though it now seems to be declining.\n\nRed card\n\nExcessive uniformity in the sound of the bands and often even in their faces, to the extent that you do not distinguish them.\n\nEven if it sells a lot, many mediocrities are still circulating, which, however, are being “adorn” by the European and American Charts.\n\nThey do not hesitate to “steal” from the ’70s mainly.\n\nWhat is it confused with\n\nWith Rock Punk, Garage Rock, New Wave, Britpop, Indie Rock, Alternative Rock, and Garage Punk.\n\nAnd many times the bands are confused with each other because of their uniformity.\n\nHow do you describe it to an irrelevant\n\nWhat you hear on mainstream radios."
