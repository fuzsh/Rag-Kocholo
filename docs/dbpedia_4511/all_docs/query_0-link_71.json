        "text": "The UK Post-Punk Revival is a genre of music that emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It is characterized by a combination of punk, post-punk, and indie rock influences, as well as a focus on experimentation and a DIY ethic. The genre is often associated with bands such as Franz Ferdinand, The Libertines, Arctic Monkeys, and Bloc Party. The sound of the genre is often characterized by angular guitar riffs, danceable rhythms, and a focus on melody. The lyrics often focus on themes of alienation, disaffection, and social commentary."
