        "text": "Post-punk revival[1][2] is a type of indie rock that emulates the sound of post-punk bands of the late 1970s and new wave bands of the early 1980s and has been stylistically tied to 1990s music movements such as shoegaze, Britpop, garage revival and post-hardcore. They feature a more artsy, complex sound than other branches of indie rock, and often add synthesizer or other electronic sounds to the traditional guitar, bass and drums lineup.[3]\n\nPost-punk revivalism started in England in the early 2000s and, while it is still strongest there, has grown in popularity in the US, Australia and Canada. Post-punk revivalism is prevalent in the London and New York City music scenes.\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top"
