        "text": "Kind of an oxymoron, I know, but there's been a cyclical revival of the post-punk sound in recent years, and I've been enjoying a lot of it. This thread was spurred by some exchanges in the Best New Albums of 2017 thread, originating with talk about the new Venn Runes record, which has a nice mix of the motorrific Berlin sound I love, bridging it with a more modern UK synthpop perspective. They don't stay in one place for long, but it's still a very cohesive debut album, and quite unexpected. The opener \"Legacy Project\" is a good statement of intent ...\n\nBest New Albums of 2017 *\n\nAnyway, this isn't a Venn thread, they are just the catalyst, and as the title suggests, I want to hear some about your picks in the world of modern post-punk, and is it still relevant in your music world? Good or bad opinions welcome, and encouraged.\n\nOK, I guess this is gonna be a bit of a tough sell, thought there might be more initial interest but that's OK, I'll give it a little push and see what happens. Maybe it will just turn into Davey's modern post-punk favorites\n\nOne of my favorite records from 2016 is by The Early Years, it's their second record and called simply II, coming 10 long years after their debut. Not that surprising, very tough to keep a band together in these times, everyone has needs, and often their own musical visions. But what a cool set of post-punk vibes throughout, just makes me feel good. It's a mix of New Order and Joy Division and Brian Eno and Spiritualized, and maybe even some Radiohead or Coldplay at times, but there's some great kosmische sound at the core that I just love. It's a fun record by young musicians (maybe not that young anymore) that understand what came before, but are making their own path, and producing their own music.\n\nBest New Album of 2016\n\nI liked that Futureheads debut a lot, but that was a really long time ago and I confess to not following them after. Like the Bloc Party debut from around the same time, they came out pretty much fully formed, and made great debut albums. That 2004-2005 period was one of the big up cycles in modern post-punk.\n\nIf you like the debut it's prob worth checking out the next 3 - they are WAAAAY better than Bloc Party imo - I liked their debut quite a bit as well but after that, meh. I think have four Futurehead albums and I think they are all pretty solid.\n\nThe Futureheads went pretty much standard indie pop a little later on, their major push had ended by 2008. They're sort of still tentatively active but have been working on other projects. Frontman Barry Hyde does solo stuff now on a small scale, and guitarist Ross Millard is a member of Frankie and the Heartstrings.\n\nSure, but you can still pick some of your favorites and talk about them, that's kind of the point of the thread, and I do realize it's a somewhat generic term at this point, almost as bad as indie rock. We've talked some about Rays and Desperate Journalist in the 2017 thread, but many of these bands get almost no exposure here. There's a lot of bands that have started out post-punk and moved on to a more modern electro-pop sound, thinking Virginia Wing and Grumbling Fur, who both put out great records last year, so I agree with some of the comments above, it does get difficult to categorize many of the bands and albums.\n\nExpert Alterations, who have a kind of Postcard vibe to my ears. This is from their debut full length, which came out on Kanine last year."
