        "text": "“J’Accuse” has been called an anti-war film, given its goal of illustrating the horrors of war. Its protagonist, a poet-turned-soldier named Jean Diaz, begins his story as a Jody in love with a woman named Edith, who happens to be married to her abusive husband François Laurin.\n\nBoth men are subsequently drafted into World War I, with Laurin deploying first. Laurin later learns of Edith’s affair, and responds by sending her to Alsace-Lorraine.\n\nDiaz, an officer, is later sent to the same unit, where he is in charge of Laurin. The dynamic proves dangerous for mission and morale alike, but eventually the pair develop mutual respect.\n\nYears pass, and Edith — at the hands of German captors — now has a child. Diaz and Laurin set out for revenge against the Germans by returning to the war. Laurin is injured and ultimately dies, while a shell shocked Diaz returns to the village — and Edith.\n\nOne night, Diaz invites much of the village to his home, where he accuses many of the visitors of being complicit in the horrors of the war. He then shares a vision of the nation’s dead rising from their battlefield graves to return home and see whether their loved ones were deserving of their ultimate sacrifices."
