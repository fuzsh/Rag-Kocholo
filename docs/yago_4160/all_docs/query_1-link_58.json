        "text": "An anti-war classic from the director of NAPOLEON (1927)\n\nJâ€™Accuse (1919) is a story set against the backdrop of World War I that is considered one of the most technically advanced films of the era and the first major pacifist film. Gance, who had served briefly in the military during World War I, decided to return to active service in 1919 in order to film real battle scenes to include in the project. However, the film had been reedited and shortened for peacetime reissue in 1922, and has not been available since in its original form.\n\nLobster Films Studios, Paris, working in collaboration with Netherlands Filmmuseum have culled materials from the Lobster Collection, the Czech archive in Prague, the Cinematheque Francaise, and the Netherlands Filmmuseum to make the best possible and most complete edition of the original 1919 edit of the film.\n\nThe 2-DVD Flicker Alley Collection edition will have a retail price of $39.95, and features a new symphonic score composed and conducted by Robert Israel\n\nWatch film clips on TCM:"
