        "meta_description": "J'Accuse!: Directed by Michael Kretzmer. With Silvia Foti, Grant Gochin, Jonathan Taylor. The Lithuanian Jewish community was decimated in the Holocaust: over 220,000 Jews, more than 95% of the population, were murdered. A key player in the massacre was Lithuanian nationalist Jonas Noreika, who is today revered as a national hero, and protected by the contemporary government's official policy and infamous Lithuanian Genocide and Resistance Research Centre. In this galvanising documentary, follow the experiences of two dissident campaigners: Grant Gochin, whose family was murdered by Noreika; and Silvia Foti, a brave Lithuanian woman fighting for the truth... and whose grandfather was Jonas Noreika. Together, the two push against Lithuania's systemic Holocaust denial in an attempt to bring justice to victims and the truth to account.",

        "text": "Excellent film, very well executed. It's important to be a voice of innocent people murdered by fake state heroes. More must be done for Lithuania's government to accept the collaborative attitude of Latvians. It's an absolute disgrace that the EU; Brussels has not only accepted this country to the EU but gives money to an antisemitic country that prefers to live in denial than face the dark past.\n\nAlso, we must be grateful for people like Sophia who found the courage to bring her grandfather's actions to light.\n\nThe difficult relationship between Noreika's granddaughter Sophia and the grandchild of the victim blossomed and it's worth remembering that there are grandchildren of the murders who are decent people and will try to make a difference in the world that is still full of hatred.\n\nRevisionist history is a serious issue that must be addressed. It's a very powerful film. Thus should be a part of educational curriculum.\n\nNever forget is only valid when there is a clear strong proactive action."
