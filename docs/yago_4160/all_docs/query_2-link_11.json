        "text": "\"And the visionary told them many other things. Profound and painful things, which mustn't emerge from the mud through images, because the eyes are still too far from the heart to truly understand.\"\n\nConsidering the sophistication on display in terms of editing, blocking for depth, etc, I can hardly believe this is from 1919. Actual documentary footage is cut into one battle sequence in flashes that are shorter than one second. Later a horizontal split screen shows actual footage of troops marching under the Arc de Triomphe on the bottom and an army of the undead lumbering home on top. That single contrast of the real and the fantastic/the patriotic icon and the politicized allegory show just how complex and…\n\nDisplaying some of the most technologically advanced filmmaking of the 1910s, J'accuse is an incredible work on the horrors of war, literally filmed in the trenches of World War One. Death lingers everywhere in J'accuse, from a deer bleeding on the floor in an early scene to the corpses strewn across the battlefield later on. J'accuse captures the mood of a nation which lost so much, with a pacifist, anti-war sentiment that condemns those who survived - what makes them worthy of the sacrifice of so many? Early on J'accuse depicts a frenzy of men willing to enlist and children who have no conception of war. Yet by the end it shows a land of sorrow, where the dead rise…\n\n6th Abel Gance (after La Folie du Docteur Tube, Napoleon, Mater Dolorosa, Au Secours! and End of the World)\n\nPart 1 of The Longest Month of My Life\n\nAnd here we go...\n\nThe first of Gance's three epics is a comparative minnow when seen alongside Napoleon or La Roue's runtimes, but that doesn't mean it's not an exhaustive film that feels positively boundless in scope. Despite being, effectively, about four (maybe five) characters, every moment tries to span the whole of the world and a tiny Provence village at the same time with varying degrees of success. If you like Gance's ability to cross-cut religion, art and cinema all together in one very intense appeal to humanity, then J'Accuse will…\n\n72/100\n\n100 Years 142/646\n\nHoly fucking shit. I've seen a couple dozen features to this point in history, and there seems to be a clear trajectory--slight improvements here and there, with some clear steps up and innovations at various points, and some aberrations that are stuck behind due to various reasons. This does not fall on that trajectory. If movies to this point are on a line with a steady slope upwards, this is in a different fuckin' graph. If this came out yesterday I'd be singing praises of its technical prowess, visual mastery, and overwhelming humanism till my lungs gave out. There's so much you can talk about here but ima just mention one lil' scene that blew my…\n\ndeath and madness are the two children of war, that dastardly game people play in vast numbers; they hold everything at stake, and what the players get in return is measly enough to sober up even the most patriotic of drunks. i'm fairly certain that if we make a list of the most overtly anti-war films of all time, J'accuse would be at least on the top 25; war here equates to unfathomable sadness, peril, and perhaps the worst of all, meaninglessness as a whole. winning would actually mean something if heroes were heroes and everyone aided from it; in the aftermath of the first world war as depicted in this movie, the only sense of vindication / gratification to…\n\n2nd\n\nJ'ACCUSE!\n\nJ'Accuse is an absolute triumph that stands as one of the greatest achievements in the history of cinema. This epic war drama takes hold of the viewer emotions from the very first frame and refuses to let go until the final breathtaking moments. Abel Gance artistic genius is on full display throughout the film, leaving an indelible mark on the world of cinema. Abel Gance brilliantly captures the devastating impact of war on individuals and society as a whole. His powerful storytelling, combined with a remarkable visual style, elevates J'Accuse to a level of cinematic artistry rarely seen.\n\nthe film underlying theme of pacifism and its denouncement of the horrors of war make J'Accuse a timeless and socially…\n\nIt's war!\n\nWhat's war?\n\nI don't know.\n\nThis is a techical masterpiece on every level.\n\nWhen I say this could’ve came out today and it would of been one of the best movies of 2022, believe me. This makes the myth that old film is boring, obsolete. Genuine storytelling done in an incredible way that is so visually innovative that also presents such general mastery of the craft is extremely rare if it even exists in today’s climate.\n\nAbel Gance is asking the French and European people; what the fuck happened? What was the reason for the Great War? And spoiler alert: it was pointless.. There’s some shots were he intercuts dancing skeletons with real WW1 footage of marching soldiers…"
