        "text": "Bill Cosby may be in jail. Harvey Weinstein may be in hiding. But Roman Polanski is alive and well, and planning his first movie in the #MeToo era. He even has an Oscar-winning actor attached.\n\nFrench producers Légende Films confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that Polanski will begin filming his next movie, the political thriller J’Accuse, this fall in Paris. Louis Garrel will star as Captain Alfred Dreyfus, the real-life French-Jewish soldier wrongly accused of spying for the Germans in the 1890s. The scandal, which divided the country, concluded dramatically in 1906 when Dreyfus was exonerated after spending five years in the Devil’s Island penal colony for high treason. The Artist’s Academy Award–winning actor Jean Dujardin will star as the counter-espionage officer who vindicated Dreyfus. Mathieu Amalric, Olivier Gourmet, and Polanski’s wife Emmanuelle Seigner will round out the cast. Polanski has been developing the film for the past six years, with a script from British novelist Robert Harris.\n\nThe subject matter—a man being wrongly accused and proving his innocence decades later—will likely make for interesting press conversations conducted around the time of the film’s eventual release. Polanski is currently evading sentencing in the U.S. after pleading guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor—then-13-year-old Samantha Geimer—in 1977. In spite of the plea, Polanski has maintained a successful movie career—even winning a best-director Oscar for The Pianist in 2003.\n\nBut the #MeToo era has already affected Polanski. This past May, the filmmaker was expelled from the the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, as was Bill Cosby. (Weinstein was expelled from the Academy in October 2017.)\n\nPolanski called the decision “the height of hypocrisy,” and, according to his lawyer Jan Olszewski, objected to being grouped with Cosby. (Polanski’s own accuser even weighed in, calling the expulsion “ugly and cruel.”)\n\nBack in 2012, when he first announced his plans to make a movie about the Dreyfus scandal, Polanski said the story was “absolutely relevant” given “the age-old spectacle of the witch hunt on a minority group, security paranoia, secret military tribunals, out-of-control intelligence agencies, governmental cover-ups, and a rabid press,” according to T.H.R.\n\nThis past May, Polanski described the #MeToo movement as another instance of “mass hysteria that occurs in society from time to time. Sometimes it’s very dramatic, like the French Revolution or the St. Bartholomew’s Day massacre in France, or sometimes it’s less bloody, like 1968 in Poland or McCarthyism in the U.S.”\n\n“Everyone is trying to back this movement, mainly out of fear,” said Polanski. “I think it’s total hypocrisy.”\n\nFrom the Magazine\n\nThe Devil Inside: Watching Rosemary’s Baby in the Age of #MeToo\n\nFifty years later, the hard truths, feminist overtones, and inescapable demons embedded in Roman Polanski’s 1968 cult film are more relevant than ever before.\n\nnope\n\nRoman Polanski Thinks the #MeToo Movement Is Just “Mass Hysteria”\n\nThe director is still evading sentencing after pleading guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor in 1977.\n\nShowdown\n\nRoman Polanski Will Appeal Academy Expulsion\n\n“We want due process,” the director’s attorney said.\n\nMovies\n\nReintroducing Humphrey Bogart: The Untold Stories of a Hollywood Icon’s Volatile Private Life\n\nThe Casablanca star’s career was shaped by his relationships with women, from his distant mother to the love of his life, Lauren Bacall. Those stories come to the forefront in a new documentary, Bogart: Life Comes in Flashes.\n\nAward Season\n\nHow Will the Presidential Election Affect This Year’s Oscar Race?\n\nThe outcome of the 2016 election was ever present at the Academy Awards that followed four months later. Could this year be the same?\n\nAward Season\n\nVenice and Toronto Film Festival Lineups Raise Our Oscar Hopes\n\nHotly anticipated films like Joker: Folie à Deux and The Piano Lesson are mixed with some wild cards that could shake up awards season.\n\nMovies\n\nLiza Minnelli Is Writing a Memoir Because She’s “Mad as Hell”\n\nIn a statement to People, Minnelli expressed disappointment with other representations of her life and revealed that she’s releasing a memoir set to hit stands in spring of 2026: “It’s my own damn story.”\n\nHollywood\n\nDan Stevens Is Down to Get Weird\n\nMore than a decade after leaving Downton Abbey, the Cuckoo star reflects on what he’s learned—and passed on to costar Hunter Schafer: “I think it was refreshing and delightful for her to realize that not every job needs to be like Euphoria.”\n\nStyle\n\nRadhika Jones on Jenna Ortega’s Rise to Stardom\n\nThe VF editor in chief charts the September cover star’s trajectory from nine-year-old working actor to global name—and now a producer on Wednesday."
