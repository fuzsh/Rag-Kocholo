        "text": "Premiered just a year ago, this blistering documentary J’Accuse! accusing modern Lithuania of overt Holocaust distortion has already recalibrated the dialogue between the Jewish People and Lithuania. Because of this film – made on a shoestring budget of less than $30,000 – Lithuania has taken down the bust in central Vilnius of Jonas Noreika, national hero and murderer of as many as 10,500 Jews in conditions of unimaginable cruelty. This powerful film has also won over 130 Best Documentary Awards and film festival selections across the world and is today one of the key weapons in the ongoing fight for Holocaust Truth. J’Accuse! produced from Boston, powerfully challenges the silence of the EU, the UN and NATO… and asks if the Holocaust has ceased to have moral meaning.\n\nDirector Michael Kretzmer will join us at Temple Emanuel to introduce the movie and will be available for discussion!\n\nRegister Here→\n\nDirector Bio\n\nMichael Kretzmer is 69. He was born in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe but has lived in England since 1976. He has written for the Sunday Times and produced many documentary films for the BBC, Channel 4 and other international broadcasters. In 2019 he made his first trip to Lithuania and this led to his making the multi award-winning documentary feature film J’Accuse! He lives in the Midlands, is a father and grandfather, likes motorbikes, growing vegetables, travel and a bit of Torah study."
