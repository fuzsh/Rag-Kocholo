        "text": "Film director Roman Polanski has swept the nomination list for the 45th CÃ©sar awards for French cinema, sparking outrage.\n\nPolanski's film An Officer and a Spy, or J'accuse in French, received 12 nominations at the awards, which are the French equivalent of the Oscars.\n\nThe Polish-French director has been wanted in the US for the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl since the 1970s.\n\nHe has since faced other accusations of sexual assault.\n\nAlain Terzian, the head of the CÃ©sars, defended Polanski's nominations, arguing that the body \"should not take moral positions\" in giving awards.\n\nHowever, CÃ©line Piques, spokeswoman for French feminist organisation Osez le FÃ©minisme (Dare to be Feminist) told French TV channel LCI: \"I am shocked. The 400 cinema professionals who voted for this nomination have applauded Polanski with 12 nominations - 12 is also the number of women today who accuse Roman Polanski of rape. This is not the field of morality, this is the field of justice.\"\n\nAn Officer and a Spy is about the Dreyfus affair, a political scandal in France in the late 1800s which saw a French Jewish army officer wrongly convicted of spying. In September, the film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival.\n\nTwo months later, however, French former actress Valentine Monnier accused Polanksi of an \"extremely violent\" assault and rape in 1975, when she was aged 18, in the latest in a series of sexual assault accusations against the director.\n\nMonnier said that the release of Polanski's most recent film had prompted her to speak out.\n\nThis is not the first time the CÃ©sars have faced controversy because of Polanski. In 2017, he was picked to head the award's jury, but stepped down after the move sparked outrage."
