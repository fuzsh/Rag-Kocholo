        "text": "W.A. found lodgings a short distance away on Annette Street, west of Keele and, like many single men of the period, continued to live in boarding houses in a variety of locations close to the office until his marriage. He involved himself in biggest local issue of the day by becoming secretary of the citizens' committee that supported the passage of the \"local option\" to prohibit the sale of liquor in Toronto Junction. Shortly after the amalgamation of West Toronto with the City of Toronto in 1909, W. A. joined lawyer A. J. Anderson in a practice located at 936 Keele Street, \"the fourth door north of Dundas\" according to the firm's advertising. Anderson, who also came from Middlesex County, was sixteen years older than his new partner and had practiced law in various partnerships since 1894. He had served on the Toronto Junction Council 1899-1902 and was also Solicitor for Toronto Junction and the short-lived City of West Toronto. A. J. Anderson would later serve as the Conservative Member of Parliament for York West and High Park from 1925 until 1945.\n\nTen years into his legal career, in August of 1912, W. A. married Elsie Louise Whitmore, a native of Edgeley, Ontario, and the couple settled into the handsome house at 144 High Park Avenue, which was designed by architect H. G. Paull and built by Mather & Fogg in 1909. It remained home for rest of their lives together. By 1913, Anderson & McMaster had moved to the Rowntree Building at the southwest corner of Dundas and Mavety. The offices were located on the second floor above Rowntree and Sons Grocers and Butchers. Although the official address was on Dundas Street, the main entrance to the office was probably at the side of the building at 225 Mavety Street.\n\nThe 3rd Battalion was part of the second wave of the Canadian attack. The 3rd Battalion had great difficulty in reaching the jump-off point for its part of the attack and it found itself in great difficulty facing formidable German opposition on difficult terrain. Over fifty percent the officers of the 3rd Battalion were casualties. Lt. McMaster took over leadership of \"A\" Company after its commander was killed, kept the company together, and achieved the company's battlefield objective.\n\nWithin the month the Canadian Corps was again on the attack. From Amiens, the Corps had moved north to a position near the city of Arras facing the entrenched German positions that comprised the Hindenburg Line. The Canadian objective was to breach a particularly heavily-fortified portion of the Hindenburg Line that was known as the Drocourt-Queant (D-Q) Line. The Battle of Arras began on 26 August 1918. The 3rd Battalion, with W.A. McMaster now serving as a company commander, went on the attack on 30 August and the Canadians were through the D-Q Line by 2 September.\n\nIn April 1919, returned to his family in Canada and to his law practice. He and his wife had three more children, daughters Dorothy and Margaret and another son, Angus. He continued his law practice with A.J. Anderson until the partnership was dissolved in the mid-1920's. The breach with Anderson was a serious one, so much so that W.A. McMaster would not take another law partner for the remaining 35 years of his legal career, even though he practiced with his sons and a son-in-law for the most of that period.\n\nW.A. established his new office above the Bank of Montreal at 2958 Dundas St. W., corner of Keele. The practice would remain at this location for over fifty-five years. W. A. McMaster was a vigorous, life-long proponent of temperance. McMaster lived the principles of temperance and his example made a lasting impression on others. Dorothy (McMaster) McIntyre recalled that, at the time of her father's death in 1961, men who had served with her father in the Great War over forty years earlier were moved to remark to her that they admired her father because he \"never took a drink\". This might not appear to be remarkable unless one bears in mind that a tot of rum was part of daily rations at the front.\n\nIn 1916, the sale and service of alcohol in Ontario was prohibited through the passage of the Ontario Temperance Act. The decade that followed saw varied efforts to circumvent the O.T.A. that included bootlegging, the production of moonshine and the issuing of hundreds of thousands of prescriptions for medicinal alcohol. The Conservative government of Premier Howard Ferguson proposed to address these problems and to advance \"the interests of temperance and of the moral welfare of the Province\" by replacing prohibition with the government-regulated sale of alcohol. The provincial election of 1926 became a referendum on the future of the Ontario Temperance Act. In no provincial riding was that more the case than in High Park. The Conservatives nominated Toronto Alderman (and former West Toronto Mayor) W. A. Baird. The Liberals chose not to field a candidate and Baird went so far as to advertise himself as the \"Liberal-Conservative Candidate\". Although he was a committed Conservative, W. A. McMaster chose to oppose his party's candidate on this matter of principle. He accepted the nomination of the High Park Temperance Union to run as an independent candidate and he made a highly creditable showing by receiving 6,809 votes to Baird's 10,653.\n\nIn 1928, W.A. was appointed King's Counsel. By the end of the 1930s, his two eldest sons, Donald and William, had followed him into law and joined him in the firm which was renamed McMaster and McMaster. In later years his third son, Angus McMaster, also joined the practice.\n\nDonald McMaster joined the RCAF after the outbreak of World War Two. In 1943 the family received the terrible news that Donald had been killed in action over North Africa. His name is carved in stone at Soldiers' Tower, Hart House, with that of other men from the university who died in the world wars.\n\nHe stood for re-election in June of 1949 but was defeated by less than 500 votes. In July 1957, the West Toronto Weekly ran a profile of W.A. McMaster for its readers. \"First in the office every morning, and last to leave at night\" was the way the daily routine of the 78-year-old lawyer was described, a man of \"keen mind, strong convictions, leadership and highest regard for the true ideals of life\" highlighting his service to High Park United Church and to the High Park YMCA. W.A. McMaster died on March 4, 1961 at the age of 82. He continued to practice law until a few months before his death, more that 58 years after he arrived in the Junction as a young, newly-qualified lawyer.\n\nThe firm purchased a modest commercial building down the street at 2777 Dundas St. W. which had been used for a variety of purposes including a kitchen cabinet shop, a laundry, and a plumbing supply shop. It was completely renovated before the firm moved in 1984. In the revitalization of the Junction Business District along Dundas Street , McMaster, McIntyre and Smyth were clearly \"ahead of the curve\". It is interesting to note the chambers over the Bank of Montreal have remained unoccupied for almost twenty years. Sandy McIntyre also followed his father and grandfather in his involvement with the YMCA. In 2002, after over two decades of volunteer service in the Toronto YMCA, Sandy became Chair of YMCA Canada, the YMCA's national organization."
