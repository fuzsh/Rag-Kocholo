        "text": "Save: Puzzles in progress are automatically saved so you can leave and return to them later. To continue a puzzle in progress simply select the same puzzle on the Jigsaw Explorer website and continue play. Jigsaw Explorer will remember the ten most recently uncompleted puzzles. Puzzles can be saved only if your browser's cookies are enabled and the puzzle is not being played in the browser's privacy mode.\n\nRotate: Puzzle piece rotation can be enabled by toggling the button with the circular arrow icon on the small center panel that appears when you first load a puzzle. You can toggle rotation on or off after puzzle play has begun by clicking the menu button and selecting \"Modify this Puzzle\".\n\nWhen rotation is enabled the puzzle pieces can be rotated with either the mouse scroll wheel or by using the left and right arrow keys. Pieces can rotated on a touch screen by selecting a piece with a tap and then continue tapping the selected piece to rotate it.\n\nCapture and Release: The capture and release feature is a handy method of quickly and efficiently moving multiple puzzle pieces at a time. Use the \"Capture and Release\" button in the toolbar to toggle in and out of capture mode. Capture pieces by clicking them, or by swiping over them while pressing the mouse button. Release captured pieces by clicking in any open space of the playing area, or by swiping over open space while pressing the mouse button.\n\nAll captured pieces can be released in a stack by releasing the first piece and then jiggling the mouse over the piece while continuing to press the mouse button. A stack of pieces can be captured in a similar manner.\n\nEdges Only/Rearrange: The Edges Only button (with the dotted box icon) can be used to hide the interior pieces while you assemble the edge pieces. After the edges are all joined the button can be used to rearrange loose, unmoved pieces towards the perimeter of the playing area. If there are less than 10 loose pieces left to assemble (or if the Shift key is pressed while clicking the button) then clicking the button moves all loose pieces to the perimeter (useful for finding seemingly \"missing\" pieces that are hard to see).\n\nNote that you can cause any loose puzzle piece to be treated as unmoved (and therefore subject to being rearranged) by moving the piece directly between any two unmoved pieces.\n\nTimer: The timer can be paused by clicking it.\n\nMultiplayer: More information can be found on the multiplayer page.\n\nRestart Puzzle: A puzzle already in progress can be restarted from the beginning by clicking the program menu button (leftmost button on the toolbar) and selecting \"Modify this puzzle\" from the menu. Then select the desired number of puzzle pieces to restart the puzzle.\n\nShortcut keys:\n\nKey Description bMomentarily display the box top cover. cToggle capture and release mode on and off. pPause the timer. rRearrange loose, unmoved puzzle pieces. tChange the theme color. EscDismiss messages, applause, capture mode, etc.\n\nFuzzy pieces: If the puzzle pieces appear a little fuzzy or slightly out of focus then your browser is probably applying too much scaling to the page. Try reducing the browser's zoom setting for sharper looking puzzle pieces.\n\nPlease report any problems you find to Support\n\nMore jigsaw puzzles at Jigsaw Explorer\n\nCopyright Â© yyyy Carolina Road Media, LLC (version vvvv)"
