        "text": "GUNDRY, Thomas (1830-1869) was born in England and practised as an architect and civil engineer in Toronto from 1859 until his unexpected death there a decade later. He was recorded in the following offices:\n\nThomas Gundry, architect & Civil Engineer, Toronto, 1859-December 1861\n\nHay & Gundry, Architects, Toronto, Dec. 1861 - June 1862 (with William Hay)\n\nGundry & Langley, Architects, Toronto, July 1862 - October 1869 (with Henry Langley)\n\nNo information can be found on his education or training of Gundry in England. He appears to have emigrated to Canada in 1854 to work on the Grand Trunk Railway; he is likely the same 'Thomas Gundry' of Simcoe, Norfolk Co., Ontario who was preparing a map of that town in 1854 (Long Point Reformer [Simcoe], 14 March 1854). In testimony before the Commission of Inquiry in connection with the Ottawa Parliament Buildings on 26 January 1863 he stated that he was '.....an architect and civil engineer, and have followed the profession for seventeen years. I have been nine years in Canada....' (Canada, Sessional Papers, Dept. of Public Works Report No. 3, 1863). By 1859 he was confident enough to establish his own practise in Toronto as an architect, civil engineer and briefly as a contractor with a 'Mr. Beachell', with whom he submitted bids for the construction of the Toronto Gaol (City of Toronto Minutes, 1859, Appendix, 390). In late 1861 he and William Hay established a partnership as 'Hay & Gundry, Architects & Engineers' (Globe [Toronto], 9 Dec. 1861, 3, advert.). This convenient arrangement was intended to cover Hay's prolonged absence from Toronto while he attended to business in Bermuda and made an extended visit to Great Britain, but when Hay decided to remain in Scotland, Gundry was forced to look elsewhere for a new business partner.\n\nHis professional reputation was considerably enhanced in July 1862 when he was joined by Henry Langley (1836-1907), a talented and enterprising young architect whose knowledge of ecclesiastical design enabled this new partnership to flourish. While Gundry's experience in practical building and civil engineering no doubt proved helpful in the office, it can be said with some certainty that the skillful designs for major commercial and religious works executed by the firm came from the hand of Henry Langley. Gundry died suddenly on 2 October 1869 in Toronto, and left an estate of more than $4,000 to his wife and daughter. Henry Langley continued the practise, with various partners, for more than thirty-five years (obituary in the Globe [Toronto], 5 Oct. 1869, 2; OA, York Co. Wills, 829).\n\nGUNDRY & LANGLEY\n\nEcclesiastical Works\n\nWHITBY, ONT., All Saints Anglican Church, Dundas Street West, 1865-66; later addition of a Sunday School by Henry Langley, 1870 (Whitby Chronicle, 8 Nov. 1866, 2, descrip.; dwgs. at OA, D.
