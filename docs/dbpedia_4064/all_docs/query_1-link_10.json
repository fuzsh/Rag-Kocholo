        "text": "A dapper, debonair, darkly attractive leading man of 1920s stage and '30s screen, actor David Manners was born Rauff de Ryther Duan Acklom on April 30, 1900, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. A highly serviceable, if sometimes overshadowed, co-star opposite Hollywood's top 1930s female superstars, It seems ironic that, out of all these beautiful leading lady co-stars, his best-remembered pairings were opposite Dracula and the Mummy!\n\nOf well-to-do stock, David was the son of British parents Lilian Manners Acklom and writer George Moreby Acklom, who was, at the time, the headmaster of Harrow House School, a renowned private boarding school in Halifax. His mother's lineage alleges Lady Diana Cooper and the Duke of Rutland as descendants, while his father's family tree includes Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Moving to New York City in 1907, his father found work as a major editor and literary advisor for the publishing firm E.P. Dutton. Employed while young as an assistant publisher, it seemed David might follow into his father's career footsteps. Instead he returned to Canada to study forestry at the University of Toronto. While there he joined the university's theatre group and, through them, made his debut at the city's Hart House Theatre in the Euripides' play \"Hippolytus\".\n\nAgainst his father's steadfast objections, Manners left college in early 1923, with only months away from graduation, when he was invited to join Basil Sydney's Touring Co. Firmly dedicated now to performing, he settled in New York City after the tour and enrolled at the Trinity School of drama where he first performed as Fernando in \"The Tempest\". He subsequently became a member of Eva Le Gallienne's Civic Repertory Co. in New York. One theatre highlight was appearing in the 1924 Broadway play \"Dancing Mothers\" with legendary Helen Hayes at the Booth Theatre.\n\nIn Los Angeles from 1927, David made an uncredited film debut in the action adventure The Sky Hawk (1929) headlining lovely Helen Chandler. It was famed director James Whale who opened the doors wide open while searching out a film cast for Journey's End (1930) after its highly successful Broadway run. Witnessing David's work in a New York play, Whale hired him to portray idealistic, innocent-eyed 2nd Lt. Raleigh opposite star Colin Clive's Capt. Stanhope. The film was critically acclaimed and it paved the way for David to play glossy romantic co-stars.\n\nFollowing David and lovely Frances Dade played the third and fourth-billed love interest behind stars Lowell Sherman and Alice Joyce in the romantic comedy He Knew Women (1930), the nascent film actor moved right to the head of the class with the crime drama Sweet Mama (1930) opposite Tessa Wells, who tries to save him from a gangster's life. He next played Caliph Abdallah opposite Loretta Young's Marsinsah in the musical fantasy Kismet (1930) and then found himself entangled in a romantic quartet with Young, Conway Tearle and Myrna Loy in the romancer The Truth About Youth (1930). By this time David had reached heartthrob status playing these well-bred gents, finding himself occasionally on the \"top 10\" list of popular film actors.\n\nReunited with Helen Chandler in the family drama Mothers Cry (1930), David's next role as John Harker (opposite Chandler playing the ill-fated Mina) would become his most famous. As the nagging nemesis to Bela Lugosi's lethal Count in Universal's granddaddy of horror classics, Dracula (1931), the Harker role would follow him the rest of his life. This visibility allowed a permanent \"in\" as a glitzy movie charmer opposite Hollywood's finest lady divas. His bevy of beautiful stars included Barbara Stanwyck in the Frank Capra drama The Miracle Woman (1931); Constance Bennett in Lady with a Past (1932); Kay Francis in Man Wanted (1932); Katharine Hepburn in Eine Scheidung (1932); and Loretta Young once again in They Call It Sin (1932).\n\nDavid reunited with his \"Dracula\" stars Lugosi and Edward Van Sloan (who played Van Helsing) with the murder mystery The Death Kiss (1932), then hopped aboard the \"horror express\" once again in his second classic, Die Mumie (1932), wherein he plays a similar damsel-saving Harker role (Frank Whemple) out to outdo Boris Karloff's nefarious creature. As usual, David continued with ritzy co-leads and second leads in such films as From Hell to Heaven (1933) starring Carole Lombard; The Devil's in Love (1933) with Loretta Young once again; and The Barretts of Wimpole Street (1934) starring Claudette Colbert. A third terror opus had Dave joining both Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi in the horror stars' first pairing). In Die schwarze Katze (1934), David and his newlywed wife are menaced by Karloff's Satanic architect.\n\nAfter playing the title role in the mystery horror Mystery of Edwin Drood (1935), a starring role as an ex-con arrested for a syndicate murder in the crime mystery The Perfect Clue (1935), a featured role in a lesser Katharine Hepburn feminist film Ein aufsässiges Mädchen (1936), and a lead role in the \"B\" level Canadian crime drama Lucky Fugitives (1936), David, tired of the Hollywood grind and pretentiousness, called it quits in films. Returning to stage tours and summer stock, he showed up on Broadway in the short-lived plays \"Truckline Café\" (with a cast including a young Marlon Brando) and \"Hidden Horizon\", both in early 1946. At the end of the year he served as a Broadway replacement in a revival of \"Lady Windemere's Fan\". In 1953, Manners retired from acting entirely.\n\nEarly back in 1933, Manners had bought and designed a ranch in the Mojave desert, which he called Rancho Yucca Loma. After Hollywood, he spent much time there making home movies, writing and painting. In 1941 he published his first novel Convenient Season, which was followed by a second, Under Running Laughter, in 1943. Both were published by E.P. Dutton. David was once married briefly (1929-1932) to Suzanne Bushnell. In 1948, he established a long-term personal relationship with playwright Frederic William (\"Bill\") Mercer (1918-1978). The couple remained together in California until Bill's death.\n\nAfter his Hollywood years, David re-intensified his strong spiritual interest and took a path that resulted in a number of philosophical writings. Look Through: An Evidence of Self Discovery was published in 1971 and his esoteric book Awakening from the Dream of Me came out in 1987. His journal writings, from 1973 on, were published posthumously as The Wonder Within You in 2006. The nonagenarian's health began to decline in 1993 and on December 23, 1998, he died at a Santa Barbara facility at the age of 97.\n\nLegendary actor Glenn Ford was born Gwyllyn Samuel Newton Ford in Sainte-Christine-d'Auvergne, Quebec, Canada, to Hannah Wood (Mitchell) and Newton Ford, a railroad executive. His family moved to Santa Monica, California when he was eight years old. His acting career began with plays at high school, followed by acting in West Coast, a traveling theater company.\n\nFord was discovered in 1939 by Tom Moore, a talent scout for 20th Century Fox. He subsequently signed a contract with Columbia Pictures the same year. Ford's contract with Columbia marked a significant departure in that studio's successful business model. Columbia's boss, Harry Cohn, had spent decades observing other studios'-most notably Warner Brothers-troubles with their contract stars and had built his poverty-row studio around their loan-outs. Basically, major studios would use Columbia as a penalty box for unruly behavior-usually salary demands or work refusals. The cunning Cohn usually assigned these stars (his little studio could not normally afford then) into pictures, and the studio's status rose immensely as the 1930s progressed. Understandably, Cohn had long resisted developing his own stable of contract stars (he'd first hired Peter Lorre in 1934 but didn't know what to do with him) but had relented in the late 1930s, first adding Rosalind Russell, then signing Ford and fellow newcomer William Holden. Cohn reasoned that the two prospects could be used interchangeably, should one become troublesome. Although often competing for the same parts, Ford and Holden became good friends. Their careers would roughly parallel each other through the 1940s, until Holden became a superstar through his remarkable association with director Billy Wilder in the 1950s.\n\nFord made his official debut in Fox's Heaven with a Barbed Wire Fence (1939), and continued working in various small roles throughout the 1940s until his movie career was interrupted to join the Marines in World War II. Ford continued his military career in the Naval Reserve well into the Vietnam War, achieving the rank of captain. In 1943 Ford married legendary tap dancer Eleanor Powell, and had one son, Peter Ford. Like many actors returning to Hollywood after the war (including James Stewart and Holden (who had already acquired a serious alcohol problem), he found it initially difficult to regain his career momentum. He was able to resume his movie career with the help of Bette Davis, who gave him his first postwar break in the 1946 movie Die große Lüge (1946). However, it was not until his acclaimed performance in a 1946 classic film noir, Gilda (1946), with Rita Hayworth, that he became a major star and one of the the most popular actors of his time. He scored big with the film noir classics Heißes Eisen (1953) and Die Saat der Gewalt (1955), and was usually been cast as a calm and collected everyday-hero, showing courage under pressure. Ford continued to make many notable films during his prestigious 50-year movie career, but he is best known for his fine westerns such as Zähl bis drei und bete (1957) and Nebraska (1965). Ford pulled a hugely entertaining turn in In Colorado ist der Teufel los (1958) and many more fine films. In the 1970s, Ford made his television debut in the controversial The Brotherhood of the Bell (1970) and appeared in two fondly remembered television series: Sheriff Cade (1971) and The Family Holvak (1975). During the 1980s and 1990s, Ford limited his appearance to documentaries and occasional films, including a nice cameo in Superman - Der Film (1978).\n\nGlenn Ford is remembered fondly by his fans for his more than 100 excellent films and his charismatic silver screen presence.\n\nA Presbyterian minister's son, softly-spoken, intellectual-looking Alexander Knox received his education from the University of Western Ontario where he studied English literature. An excellent elocutionist (a member of the university's Hesperian Club) he had his first fling with dramatic acting playing the lead in \"Hamlet\". His professional theatrical debut began on the Boston stage in 1929 while simultaneously earning an income as a journalist for the Boston Post. After just one year he went looking for better acting opportunities in England, specializing in 'serious' classical parts which required just the right measure of 'gravitas'. During another journalistic stint with the London Advertiser he made the acquaintance of noted stage director and producer Tyrone Guthrie who helped him to make a name for himself on the London stage at the Old Vic. As the decade progressed, Knox appeared opposite such theatrical icons as Ralph Richardson and Laurence Olivier (in \"The King of Nowhere\"), and in plays by James Bridie and George Bernard Shaw.\n\nMovie work followed in 1938 with appearances in The Gaunt Stranger (1938) and a bit part in Vier Federn (1939). However, the outbreak of World War II prompted his return to America. In 1940, Knox got his big break on Broadway cast in the role of Friar Laurence in \"Romeo and Juliet\", written and staged by Olivier and starring Vivien Leigh as Juliet. A later leading role in \"The Three Sisters\" (1942-43) -- a turn-of-the-century drama set in Russia -- saw him as Baron Tuzenbach opposite Katharine Cornell and Judith Anderson. With a brace of good critical notices, it became only a matter of time before the screen beckoned again. In 1941, Knox made his Hollywood film bow and was perfectly cast as the quiet intellectual Humphrey Van Weyden, protagonist of Jack London's maritime classic Der Seewolf (1941). His performance was somewhat overshadowed by those of his co-stars, Edward G. Robinson (in the titular role of Wolf Larsen) and the dynamic John Garfield (as chief mutineer George Leech) but it led to further work as a reliable lead character player.\n\nFor most of his career, Knox tended to be typecast as men of integrity (though he did play the odd villain): stern authority figures, psychiatrists, academics and politicians - undoubtedly, this was because of his inherently sincere, though rather sombre on-screen personality. It was also a consequence of having been cast in the starring role of Woodrow Wilson, the 28th U.S. President, in Darryl F. Zanuck's over-ambitious biopic Wilson (1944). Bosley Crowther commented for The New York Times (August 2, 1944): \"Much of the film's quality is due to the performance of Alexander Knox in the title role. Mr. Knox....draws a character that is full of inner strength - honest, forceful and intelligent, yet marked by a fine reserve... The casting of Mr. Knox, a comparative unknown, in this role was truly inspired\". Despite the excellent personal notices, 'Wilson' was a rather slow and ponderous affair, a flop at the box office and one of Zanuck's most conspicuous failures. His personal reputation intact, Knox had several leading roles come his way in the wake of 'Wilson', even a rare comedy part in The Judge Steps Out (1948) as a starchy, but likeable Boston judge. However, in 1952, his career suffered a serious setback when he was blacklisted by HUAC for alleged left-wing affinities and forced to leave for England.\n\nFrom 1954, Alexander Knox appeared in scores of British films and was particularly good in two productions for the director Joseph Losey (who had also been black-listed in Hollywood): Sie sind verdammt (1962) and Accident - Zwischenfall in Oxford (1967). He also played another U.S. president in the James Bond thriller Man lebt nur zweimal (1967) and was a memorable spook (the ill-fated 'Control') in Dame, König, As, Spion (1979) on television. He made a successful return to the London stage, frequently in plays by Henrik Ibsen and Clifford Odets. Outside of his principal occupation he was finally able to devote himself wholeheartedly to his long-standing literary ambition, as the author of plays (\"Old Master\", \"Trafalgar Square\"), screenplays and five adventure novels set in the wilds of 19th century Canada. Knox died in his adopted home in Berwick-Upon-Tweed, England, in 1995 at the age of 88.\n\nAlan Young was born in Northern England in 1919, but his Scots father moved the family to Edinburgh, Scotland, when Young was a toddler and then to Canada when Young was about 6 years old. As a boy, he suffered from severe asthma, which kept him bedridden for long periods of time but encouraged his love of radio. By age 13, Young had become a radio performer, and by age 17, he was writing and performing in his own radio show for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The show was broadcast in the U.S. and led to an invitation to New York, initiating Young's career as an \"All-American boy,\" despite his non-American origins and a vestigial Scots accent. He became popular on American radio from 1944 to 1949 with his \"Alan Young Radio Show,\" but when radio began to lose its popularity and his show was canceled, Young decided to put together a comedy act and tour the U.S. theater circuit. After this experience, he wrote a television pilot for CBS in 1950, which resulted in The Alan Young Show (1950). The show was a well-received live revue that ran for 3 years, earned a couple of Emmy Awards, and garnered Young a star on the \"Walk of Fame.\" However, the strain of writing and performing a weekly show got to Young, and the quality of the show declined, leading to his departure from the show and its cancellation. In the meantime, based on his popularity on radio and television, Young had established a film career, starting with his debut in Margie (1946) followed by Chicken Every Sunday (1949), Mr. Belvedere Goes to College (1949), Aaron Slick from Punkin Crick (1952), Androkles und der Löwe (1952), So liebt man in Paris (1955), Der kleine Däumling (1958), and Die Zeitmaschine (1960).\n\nIn the early 1960s, Young landed his best-known role, Wilbur Post, in the popular television series Mister Ed (1961), which ran for 5 years. Since then, Young has made a number of television and film appearances but is known primarily for his voice characterizations in cartoons, especially as Scrooge McDuck in DuckTales - Neues aus Entenhausen (1987)."
