        "text": "Your Money/Your Health\n\nJanuary 2024 Pension Plan Updates / Increases\n\nBy Cliff Andrews, MURA Representative, Hourly Pension Plan Committee, and\n\nBrian Beckberger, MURA Representative, Pension Trust Committee\n\nLike many other defined benefit plans, the McMaster plans have had a fairly weak financial return for the last few years. This has been the result of a combination of the COVID pandemic, followed by worldwide supply chain issues and the Bank of Canada's increase in interest rates. These events have caused a significant loss in investment value, particularly in 2022, which will have a dampening effect on pension payment increases for at least a few years. The only good news is that our plans are showing good gains, and we are anticipating better results in the near future.\n\nAll the McMaster defined benefit pension plans had very good investment returns from July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023.\n\nThe Salaried Pension Plans enjoyed a rate of return of 12.71% in fiscal 2022-2023. The first quarter returns were similar to the previous fourth quarter, with losses in the markets. The second and third fiscal quarters had strong markets. The fourth fiscal quarter, while still positive, had weaker gains.\n\nThe Hourly Pension Plan had a rate of return of 16.66% in fiscal 2022-2023. With interest rates increasing quite dramatically in 2022 and 2023, and the Hourly pension plan fund having proportionately more assets in bonds, the return was high.\n\nYou will note from the above that the Hourly Pension Plan fund had a higher rate of return than the Salaried fund in fiscal 2022-2023. Both funds had similar rates of return over the previous five years. The reason the retirees of the Salaried Pension plans received a small annual increase in January 2024, but the retirees of the Hourly Pension Plan received no increase is due to the differing definitions of “excess average rate of return” (excess return) in the plans. As shown in the calculations below, the Hourly Pension Plan requires an excess return of 6% before an annual increase can be given, whereas the Salaried Pension Plan requires a lower excess return (4.5%, or 5% for employees hired on or after May 1, 2010).\n\nHow the January 2024 Annual Pension Increases were calculated\n\nAnnual pension increases, if any, are based on the five-year average annual rate of return on the pension funds as of the previous June 30th.\n\nFor the Salaried Pension Plans, the five-year average annual rate of return was 5.35% [(12.71 -13.2 + 16.73 + 4.68 + 5.84)/5] as of June 30, 2023. Increases are paid if this average exceeds 4.5% for most retirees of the Salaried plans, or 5.00% for employees hired on or after May 1, 2010 in Plan 2000 who retired from the University as a Unifor Local 5555, Unit 1 member. For retirees hired on or after May 1, 2010 in Plan 2000, the January 2024 increase is 0.35%. For others in the Salaried Plans, the increase is 0.85%.\n\nThe Hourly Pension Plan average annual rate of return was 5.55% [(16.67 - 13.57 + 13.97 + 4.39 + 6.29)/5]. Increases are paid if the average rate of return exceeds 6.0%. Since the five-year average annual rate of return did NOT exceed the excess return criteria, there is no January 2024 increase for Hourly Pension Plan retirees.\n\nSupplementary Pension Increases\n\nSupplementary pension increases are based on the current five-year average rate of return, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and the previous three years of annual pension increases.\n\nSupplementary pension increases will be given if:\n\nthe annual pension increases were less than the CPI in any of the previous three years; and\n\nthe current five-year average rate of return exceeds the limiting factors mentioned above.\n\nWhen these two conditions are satisfied, then supplementary pension increases will be given as a means to allow a ‘catch-up’ for any or all of those previous three years, up to a maximum of 100% of CPI.\n\nSince the Salaried Pension Plans’ five-year average rate of return minus 4.5% did not exceed the CPI, there is no supplementary pension increase for those in the Salaried Plans this year. Since the Hourly Pension did not exceed the excess return criteria, there will be no supplementary pension Increase for those in the Hourly Pension Plan this year.\n\nAdditional information on the Hourly Pension Plan and the Salaried Pension Plan can be found on the Human Resources Services website.\n\n2023 Tax Documents\n\nIf you retired during 2023, a T4 will be issued electronically by McMaster University via Mosaic regarding your employment income earned in 2023. A T4A will be mailed by CIBC Mellon to your home address regarding your pension income.\n\nIn subsequent years, retirees will receive a T4A from CIBC Mellon regarding their pension income. If a retiree is re-employed by McMaster University after retirement, a T4 will be issued electronically via Mosaic regarding employment income during the applicable tax year.\n\nFor questions regarding a T4 issued by McMaster University, please contact the Employee Contact Centre at hr.mcmaster@mcmaster.ca or 905-525-9140 x22247.\n\nFor questions regarding a T4A issued by CIBC Mellon, please contact CIBC Mellon online or at 1-800-565-0479.\n\nParking on Campus\n\nPermit Expiry Renewal Reminder\n\nRetiree parking permits are issued on a 12-month basis and must be renewed annually. Renew prior to your expiry date by email, phone or by postal mail. Your transponder number is on the front of your transponder. If you have questions or have not made a note of your expiry date, please contact McMaster Parking Services by email at parking@mcmaster.ca or at 905-525-9140, x24232.\n\nNote that central-campus parking (with a transponder) is available to McMaster retirees as follows:\n\nMay to August each year:\n\nAccess to lots B, D, E, H, I, K, N, P and Underground Stadium at all times.\n\nSeptember to April each year:\n\nAccess to Lots B, D, E, and I after 12:30 pm on weekdays, and at all times on weekends and holidays,\n\nAccess to Lots H, K, N, P and Underground Stadium at all times on weekdays, weekends and holidays.\n\nA note to retirees without parking transponders\n\nFree on campus parking is available to all retirees. To take advantage of this perk, and to view retiree parking access, go to the McMaster Parking Services web page. The Parking Office is accepting permit applications by email only. For further information, please contact Parking Services.\n\nNotifying Human Resources of Address Changes\n\nAre you moving? Please don't forget to update your address on file at McMaster University to ensure you receive any correspondence, including your T4A, at the correct address. The Human Resources Service Centre provides McMaster retirees with one point of contact to update their new addresses. Upon receiving your address change, the HR Service Centre will update the following as applicable on your behalf:\n\nCommunicate updated address information to the McMaster University Retirees Association (MURA)\n\nUpdate the Sun Life System (for benefit purposes)\n\nCommunicate address information to CIBC Mellon (for pension purposes)\n\nUpdate the McMaster HR System\n\nAddress changes can be forwarded to the HR Contact Centre using any of the following methods:\n\nPhone: (905) 525-9140 ext. 22247 (222HR)\n\nEmail: hr.mcmaster@mcmaster.ca\n\nComplete the Human Resources Retiree Address Change Form and mail it to the HR Service Center at the address on the form.\n\nPlease do not hesitate to contact an HR Advisor with any questions.\n\nRemember also to let MURA know if you have a new email address. You can send this information to mura@mcmaster.ca.\n\nA Reminder About Retiree Benefit Plan Booklets\n\nBy Brian Beckberger and Helen Barton\n\nIf you are a retiree with post-retirement extended health and dental benefits, you should expect your retiree benefit coverage provisions to remain the same throughout your retirement. There may be periodic updates due to legislative or regulatory changes. A recent example of this is related to vaccines. The retiree benefit plan covers vaccines that legally require a prescription. When the Shingrix vaccine was reclassified from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule II drug by the National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities (NARPA), the vaccine was no longer covered by the McMaster retiree benefit plans since a Schedule II drug does not require a prescription.\n\nRetiree benefit booklets are periodically updated by Sun Life to incorporate administrative and legislative changes. For example, hearing aid coverage in some older booklets did not specifically state that hearing aids are covered for both ears. Newer booklets make that clear.\n\nMURA recommends retirees keep their original booklet as a valuable reference point.\n\nThe most recently version of retiree benefit booklets are available online, or you can request a paper copy by contacting the Human Resources Contact Centre at 905-525-9140, x 22247 or hr.mcmaster@mcmaster.ca.\n\nA more detailed article about Sun Life extended health and dental claims coverage was published in the Fall 2023 MURAnews article \"Questions About Your Sun Life Health & Dental Claims Coverage\". The section titled \"How can I find out if a drug is covered?\" contains more information regarding the Canadian National Drug Schedule.\n\nStatement from Human Resources Services\n\nIf you have submitted a benefit claim, the Explanation of Benefits statement that you receive from Sun Life will explain the portion of your claim that has been paid and why. If, after reviewing the Explanation of Benefits statement, you have questions about your claim, please call Sun Life at 1-800-361-6212 and one of their customer service representatives will assist you. Keep in mind that your retiree health and dental plan may not cover all of your expenses as, depending on the type of claim, there may be an annual deductible that applies, plan maximums may have been reached, and/or not all items are covered.\n\nIf you still have questions about your claim after having spoken to Sun Life, you can contact the HR Contact Centre at 905-525-9140, ext. 22247 for further assistance. McMaster University’s Human Resources Services is always available to support our retired community.\n\nWhat to do with old Technology Devices\n\nBy Denise Anderson\n\nDid you get a great Boxing Day deal on a new laptop? Or maybe you finally upgraded your cell phone? Did your iPad give up the ghost and you’re trying to figure out what to do with it? Well, there are several options you can consider.\n\nIf the device still works…\n\nShiny new toys aside, you really don’t want to throw that old cell phone in the garbage, or just have it sit in a drawer collecting dust, so why don’t you consider donating it?\n\nMcMaster’s ACCESS Tech – Students from the Academic Sustainability Program have collaborated with Facility Services, University Technology Services (UTS), and Empowerment Squared to collect donations of used technology to refurbish and give to Hamiltonians in need. McMaster students and staff work with their community partner, Empowerment Squared, and network agencies such as Refuge: Hamilton Centre for Newcomer Health, Munar Learning Centre, Hamilton Centre for Civic Inclusion, Immigrants Working Centre, and the Afro Canadian Caribbean Association.\n\nUsed computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones can be donated by emailing AccTech@mcmaster.ca to arrange a drop-off on campus.\n\nDiabetes Canada – In addition to gently used clothing and small household items, Diabetes Canada will pick up electronics (in working condition) such as cameras, cell phones, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), laptops, tablets, and gaming consoles. Visit their website to schedule a pick-up, or call 1-800-505-5525.\n\nSalvation Army Thrift Store – Drop off computers or electronics that are in working condition to a local Donor Welcome Centre near you.\n\nTELUS, Bell, and Rogers – These cell phone carriers offer trade-in-programs that let you trade your used device for a credit you can apply towards a new phone.\n\nIf the device no longer works…\n\nLet’s face it – technology dies just like everything else. But again, you don’t want to just throw it away. In this case, recycling is a good option.\n\nMcMaster’s ACCESS Tech – Any unusable technology will be either upcycled by students who will use the parts from the devices, or will be properly recycled.\n\nIt’s Recyclable – This family-owned business offers free pick-up in Hamilton and its communities (Ancaster, Dundas, and Stoney Creek) for a variety of items in any condition. Acceptable items include: electronics, TVs and computer monitors, computers, laptops and accessories, video game systems, cameras and video cameras, cell phones, printers and fax machines, satellite boxes and dishes, cable boxes, VCRs, and DVD players. You can contact them at 905-920-5120 to schedule a pick-up.\n\nTELUS, Bell, and Rogers – If a device has no value or no longer works, you can drop it off at your provider’s store to have it properly recycled.\n\nThese options are free, and it is relatively easy to prepare your old devices for donation or recycling. There are other options for disposing of used technology, but you may have to pay a fee, so it’s best to check first.\n\nRemoving your personal data before donating or recycling…\n\nUsable cellphones and tablets need to be factory reset and SIM-unlocked before they can be donated. Mac’s University Technology Services (UTS) provides instructions for resetting both Android and Apple devices.\n\nLaptops and computers should be “sanitized” before being donated. Sanitizing permanently erases data so it cannot be recovered. Specialized sanitizing software programs that are free to download include: Eraser (for Windows), Permanent Eraser for Mac, DiskGenius, Disk Wipe, and KillDisk. These utility programs work by overwriting your information with random patterns repetitively until the data is so scrambled that the original patterns are no longer able to be retrieved.\n\nWhat's Happening at Mac\n\nBy Marcia MacAulay\n\nMcMaster Breaks Ground on New Student Residence\n\nConstruction has begun on McMaster’s 15th and largest residence building, Lincoln Alexander Hall. Scheduled to open for Fall 2026, the residence will be home to 1,366 students. Adding this residence will enable McMaster to guarantee housing for all first-year undergraduate students. A groundbreaking ceremony was held November 9, 2023 at the site of the future residence on Main Street West.\n\nLincoln Alexander Hall is McMaster’s latest housing expansion during a period of substantial residence growth. Since 2019, the university has added over 1,100 new residence spaces. The upcoming campus plan envisions even more, including spaces in the Wilson College of Leadership and Civic Engagement.\n\nThe vision of a vibrant, supportive residence community helped shape the decision to name the building after the late Lincoln Alexander. A 1949 McMaster graduate, Alexander was an advocate for education and an activist for racial equity. He was Canada’s first Black Member of Parliament, representing the Hamilton West federal riding, and was also the first Black cabinet minister and Ontario’s first Black lieutenant-governor.\n\nLincoln Alexander Hall will be one of McMaster’s most innovative residences: the building will have an interior green space and will include over 325 bicycle spaces, a fitness area, and underground car parking. It will also house an intergenerational hub hosted by the McMaster Institution for Research on Aging, designed to encourage students and older adults from the community to socialize and learn together.\n\nSee the Daily News article McMaster breaks ground on its largest, most innovative student residence for more information.\n\nUniversity Club Lounge Now Open to All\n\nThe University Club Lounge in Alumni Memorial Hall opened its doors to the campus community and the public on November 1, 2023, ending its membership requirement. With the lounge now welcoming guests for lunch, beverages and afternoon snacks, Alumni Memorial Hall has returned to its beginnings as a campus gathering space.\n\nHospitality Services and Housing & Conference Services began jointly operating Alumni Memorial Hall in 2022, with the goal of expanding the McMaster community’s access to the formerly members-only venue. The Buttery, a restaurant on the lower level focused on local and sustainable ingredients, opened to the public that year. On the main level, the West Room and the Great Hall have become popular event spaces.\n\nTraditionally popular University Club events such as the Mother’s Day high tea, wine tastings and lobster dinners, will continue and will be open to all. More information, including hours of operation and methods of payment, is available at the Alumni Memorial Hall website, or for general inquiries, contact 905-525-9140, ext. 23246. View the Daily News article Welcome to the Club: University Club Lounge will be open to all.\n\nPatrick Deane Fall Honorary Degree Recipient\n\nPatrick Deane, an extremely familiar face to many people as McMaster’s president and vice-chancellor from 2010 to 2019, was recognized with an honorary degree at the Fall 2023 Convocation. He began his leadership at McMaster by authoring Forward With Integrity, advancing guiding principles for and emphasizing a focus on student experience, community engagement, research and internationalization. His initiatives ultimately led to the creation of the Office of Community Engagement, as well as the development of the Paul R. MacPherson Institute for Leadership, Innovation and Excellence in Teaching.\n\nDeane is known for being a staunch advocate for the societal value of research-intensive universities, and his commitment to equipping McMaster students with the skills and tools they need to engage thoughtfully and critically with the challenges facing our world.\n\nA recipient of the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal, Deane returned to Queen’s University to become its principal and vice-chancellor in 2019. View the Daily News article Meet the Fall convocation’s honorary degree recipients.\n\nMath and Stats 80th Anniversary\n\nPlanning is underway for virtual activities and an in-person fall celebration of this milestone. Retired department faculty and staff are invited to reach out to Laura Escalante at escalan@mcmaster.ca or 905-525-9140, ext. 21314 in the alumni engagement office to join the list for updates and invitations.\n\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence at McMaster\n\nBy Nora Gaskin\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence (generative AI) has been much in the news, especially since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. ChatGPT is credited with starting an AI boom which has led to unprecedented development in the field of AI. But generative AI is a double-edged sword. Issues related to generative AI include privacy of personal data, risks of misinformation, environmental costs, labour exploitation, copyright, and even risks to the survival of humanity itself. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in a July 2023 briefing of the United Nations Security Council that \"Generative AI has enormous potential for good and evil\", and that AI may \"turbocharge global development\", but that its malicious use \"could cause horrific levels of death and destruction, widespread trauma, and deep psychological damage on an unimaginable scale\".\n\nIn response to these rapid developments on the AI front, McMaster University launched the Task Force on Generative Artificial Intelligence in Teaching and Learning in May 2023, and charged it with “drafting and endorsing guidelines and resources for educators and students, compiling recommendations for the Senate Committee on Academic Integrity, and recommending proactive teaching strategies to mitigate risks to academic integrity caused by generative AI”. The 35-member Task Force released provisional guidelines for instructors and students in the use of generative AI in June 2023. These include general guidelines for instructors, including those relating to academic integrity, privacy, student assessments, and links to further resources.\n\nAlthough the Task Force concluded its work in August 2023, an update from the Office of the Provost says “This winter we will launch an ongoing Advisory Committee related to generative AI with a broader scope to include research, teaching and learning and the world of work”.\n\nSome of the resources currently listed on the Provost’s web pages include:\n\nThe MacPherson Institute’s generative AI web page includes such resources as a glossary of AI terms, an outline of the capabilities and limitations of generative AI, a guidebook for educators on AI in teaching and learning, compiled resource lists, and ethical use guidelines.\n\nSources and further information:\n\nMcMaster Daily News: McMaster releases provisional guidelines for the use of generative Artificial Intelligence in the classroom\n\nOffice of the Provost:\n\nVolunteer Opportunities"
