It immediately established her as a distinctive poet and was awarded the Harri Jones Memorial prize. Patrick White bought copies to give to his friends. David Malouf wrote of the collection, \"Spare, tough, eloquent, these poems poke into corners of the ordinary and come up with discoveries that are sometimes scary, often hilarious, always enlarging of our sense of the pathos and mystery of things.\"\n\nIt was fourteen years before McMaster's second collection, Washing the Money, appeared. A tiny volume of forty pages, it is padded out with home photographs of characteristic acerbity and with an ultrasound of her third daughter, Stella, in utero at fifteen weeks. A young woman's precise observations have been overtaken in this book by a meticulous, intense will to tease out both precision and resonance from tiny domestic moments from childhood, and the second half explores with characteristically quirky imagery the neighborhood world of contemporary living.\n\nOn My Empty Feet (1993) is a more substantial volume that explores with chilling coolness and power the effects of a stroke suffered by McMaster's mother. The book also has a range of suburban voices in which the poet's ear for the rhythms of everyday speech are balanced by her always quirky and vivid sense of image.\n\nOnly a year after this volume, McMaster published Flying the Coop, a book of selected poems that contains a substantial selection of new work. It is clear that, after the constraints of years of domestic priorities, a changed lifestyle has released a dramatic and sometimes terrifying new flow of creativity. This new energy has been further exemplified in the collection Chemical Bodies (1997), though the personal here has been displaced by a more intellectual wit and curiosity.\n\n—Thomas W. Shapcott"
