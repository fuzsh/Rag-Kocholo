        "text": "I was born in a country that no longer exists, the economic and social collapse has caused my parents to seek a new home and Canada opened its doors. Seeing the sacrifices my parents made to provide the best possible life for my sister and I has been my main motivation since I was 6 years old (corny, I know). I grew up with the determination to make the most of each opportunity presented to me in a new country I now call home. It was here that I slowly built myself up and developed as a person, all in preparation for that big and important leap — university.\n\nPicking which university to attend was the most important decision I had to make in my adolescent years; what 17-year-old really knows what they want to do with their life? While I was unsure of which career path I would want to explore, it was important for me to attend a university with a strong internship program to provide me with a competitive edge. Following a campus tour of McMaster, I was drawn to the small town feel, beautiful grounds, and the diversity of the students and faculty. Shortly thereafter, I moved from Toronto to Hamilton to attend the DeGroote School of Business at McMaster University.\n\nJuggling a full course load with limited moral support since my loved ones were in a different city, forced me to learn how to be efficient with my time. My top priority throughout the first years of school was to land an internship placement at a top company. In the third year, I did exactly that and landed a position with GE as a Sales and Marketing intern.\n\nWanting to make the most of my first corporate job experience, it was important for me to network and build relationships that would help me navigate a matrixed organization. I was diligent about prioritizing my time, which allowed me to get involved with the company, whether that entailed volunteering with non-profits, raising my hand to organize events or carving out 30 minutes to meet with someone new for coffee. These relationships not only helped mold me into a better employee by allowing me to pick up necessary soft skills it also helped me extend an 8-month internship into an 18-month opportunity. During my internship experience, I received a corporate award recognizing the top 3% of students for outstanding achievement and the Student Intern & Co-op Contribution Award. Through leveraging the relationships I built, I was able to secure a permanent management position that guaranteed placement upon graduation.\n\nComing back to school and no longer having a regular corporate structure, I noticed I kept asking myself “where did the time go?” I realized I was not intentionally taking control of my time; instead, I was letting it get away from me in small increments. Thinking I had no time left made me falsely believe I was busy and overwhelmed. Upon discovering the MARS competition, a six-week experiential learning program, I knew I had to participate to further build on my soft skills I learned from my internship. Throughout the program, I researched, solved and presented solutions to real-world business problems. Aside from meeting amazing people and forming lifelong friendships, this competition helped me develop my critical thinking and presentation skills that I still use to this day — winning it was a bonus.\n\nAfter graduation, I went back to GE to manage the national marketing efforts for GE Lighting. Although a large conglomerate, it was inspiring to see how they had an internal entrepreneurial spirit, always searching for new ideas and simplifying processes. Recognizing the limited growth in Canada for my functional area and wanting to take a break from a busy travel schedule, I started searching for opportunities at Canadian-based companies.\n\nIn 2016, I joined one of Canada’s largest telecommunications companies as a program manager and a year later I created, pitched, and received approval for a new role addressing a gap I outlined. I am still in this role and I love what I do, mostly because I forged my own path by carving out an unaddressed need that aligns with my passion.\n\nLast year, I read that there are fewer women CEOs than CEOs named John, which sparked a visceral reaction in me, as it reinforced the glass ceiling firmly remaining in place. Instead of being upset about the situation, I wanted to address the problem directly by taking action. This motivated me to start my own non-profit, Nova Society, which aims to elevate the power of women and address the lack of diversity prevalent in leadership teams. We are in our second year and have hosted over four events across the GTA welcoming numerous public speakers, coaches and mentors.\n\nThe theme throughout my story and the one piece of advice I want to share with students is to take control of your time in a world that is full of distractions and focus your time on forging your own path. Whether that is in your personal or professional life, create opportunities for yourself wherever you can, especially while you are in school. As William Shakespeare once wrote, “It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves.”"
