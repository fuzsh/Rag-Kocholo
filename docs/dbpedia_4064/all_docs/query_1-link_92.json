        "text": "MURRAY, ALEXANDER LOVELL 1929-2024 Professor Murray died peacefully at home on February 11, 2024. Beloved husband of Laura, who he met when he was 15 and was married to for 70 years. Alex also leaves his nieces and nephews, Glenn (Michele), John (Theresa), Alison (Rod), Ian (Linda), Angus (Sarah), Laura and their families. A Professor Emeritus of York University, Faculty of Environmental Studies, Alex focused on urban and social change at McMaster BA, King's College London MA and Penn PhD. His work would lead them from Hamilton to London, UK to Philadelphia, and finally to Toronto, where Alex co-founded the Department of Urban Studies and the Faculty of Environmental Studies at York University. Alex was an early adopter of finding solutions to some of society's greatest issues, from homelessness to food security. He gave of his time, skill and experience in leadership roles with the Toronto Chapter of the Community Planning Association of Canada, the National Housing Subcommittee of the Canadian Council on Social Development, Grey County's Grey Association for Better Planning, the Canadian Council on Human Resources in Environmental Industries, and the Toronto Food Policy Council. In 2010, Alex was honoured by the City of Toronto's naming of the Alex Murray Parkette for his four-decade contributions to the South Rosedale Ratepayers Association where he and Laura lived since 1963. This tribute marked Alex's achievements and accomplishments and his many hours of volunteer service. Alex loved cooking wonderful meals with Laura, the outdoors and welcoming friends and family into the home and life they built together. A celebration of life for Alex will be held in the spring of 2024."
