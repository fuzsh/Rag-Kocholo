She was born on Dec. 10th, 1920 in the small country town of Dungannon, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. She had a happy childhood with her two brothers and three sisters. Her family owned the local newspaper, The Tyrone Courier, which was printed once per week. In 1938, she met her future husband, George Howard Kluge, who had moved to Northern Ireland to become a director of Stevenson and Son Limited, manufacturers of \"Moygashel\" Irish Linen. They fell in love and were married Dec. 26, 1939, and remained happily together for sixty-five years, until George passed away in 2005. In 1952, they emigrated to The Bahamas by boat with three young children, and very soon felt at home.

Sadly, Olive was predeceased by her sons Howard (1955) and John (2005), and her daughters Rosamund (1984) and Suzanne (2005).
