        "text": "Descendants of William McMaster\n\nI would like to find out more about this family. This line is being researched by Shari Thrasher of Arizona, Arthur Livingstone in Ireland and myself in Massachusetts. We are all descended from William McMaster and Margaret Frazer. It seems to me that every family usually has a person who is interested in the family history. However, the further one goes back, it seems the historians multiply.\n\nGeneration One\n\n1. William1 McMaster was born circa 1790. He married Margaret Frazer in 1813.\n\nChildren of William1 McMaster and Margaret Frazer were as follows:\n\n2. i. Jane2, born circa 1820; married George McMaster.\n\nii. Marrianne; baptized 9 Jan 1820 in Kilmactranny Church, Sligo, Ireland.\n\n3. iii. Catherine Frazer, born 24 Jan 1827; married Henry DeWitt Clinton Bennett.\n\n4. iv. Fanny, born 4 Apr 1829 in Kilmactranny Parish, Sligo, Ireland; married James McMaster Sr.\n\nThis William is possibly the William identified by Arthur Livingstone as the 1812 leaseholder of Kilkear.\n\n\"To hold unto the said William McMaster his Heirs and Assigns form the day of the decease of Abraham McMaster the present Tenant for and during the term of twenty one years from Thence then next ensuing for the natural life of Abraham McMaster aged three years Son of Abraham McMaster the younger and cousin of the said William MaMaster at the yearly rent of ninty pounds... Witnessed by William Martin Forester of Lincoln't Inn in the County of Midddlesex Gentelman and William Handaside of Edinburgh in Scotland Gentleman...\n\nArthur Livingstone further reports a William McMaster who was a tenant with Michael Frazer in Aghrafinegan, on Lord Lorton's estate in 1821. I would think this could be the same William McMaster, given that his wife was a Frazer. Michael could have been her father or brother. I mention Michael on my Frazer web page but I don't have information on his parents or offspring.\n\nGeneration Two\n\n2. Jane2 McMaster (William1) was born circa 1820. She married George McMaster on 15 Aug 1839 in Sligo.\n\nChildren of Jane2 McMaster and George McMaster were as follows:\n\ni. James3; born circa 1840 in Dramore, Sligo; died circa 1925 in Michigan.\n\nii. Susan; born circa 1841 in Dramore, Sligo.\n\niii. William Christopher; born 14 Jul 1843 in Dramore, Sligo; died 17 Feb 1927 in Omaha, Nebraska, at age 83.\n\niv. Annie Wilmena; born 1 Nov 1845 in Burwich, Canada; died 19 Jan 1907 in Denver, Colorado, at age 61.\n\nv. George Arthur; born 22 May 1847 in York, Canada; died 29 Sep 1864 in Washington, D. C, at age 17.\n\nGeorge was born about 1820. Little is known about him. Assuming he named his children in the traditional way, his father would have been James McMaster and his mother would be Annie. Shari Thrasher has provided some a very intersting tradition concerning the McMaster Family:\n\nThe following information written about my 2nd great grandmother, JANE MCMASTER, comes from a family history titled 'The Wheeler and McMaster Family History as told by May McMaster Timmel, 1960'. It was sent to me by Geraldine Fickel of Glenwood, Iowa before her death in the 1990's. William McMaster, Jane's first child was born in Edinborough, Scotland although his home was Dramora, County Sligo, Ireland. A child of wealthy parents, he was never taught to work. Jane, his mother belonged to the Stuart line and was a lady in-waiting to one of the Queens. Her name was McMaster before her marriage to a McMaster. She was Scotch and he was Irish. Her husband (George) died when William was about 6 yrs. old and a few months before his sister Anna was born. Not wishing inter-marriage in her family as was the custom in Scotland, William's mother Jane started to America with her family leaving six year old William with her brother in Edinborough. Anna was born at sea. The other children were Sue and James. She with her young family stopped in Canada for a short time and then came to Milwaukee, Wisconsin where her sister Margaret lived. After a few years she married again, a man by the name of Thompson. He died some years later and she continued to live in Wisconsin. She was very dainty and aristocratic and we all waited on her for she knew nothing of work. Sister Carrie looked very much like her and was our father's favorite. 'Grandmother' Jane went back to Milwaukee with her sister Margaret who came for her and was much like her. Later she went to Oakland, California to live with her husband's half brother E.A. Thompson and passed away there. She was extremely religious and often took the place of the circuit rider in (Wisconsin) in the winter when the snow was deep and the circuit rider could not make his rounds. She also lived with her son 'Mac' and daughter-in-law Laura in their hotel in Western, Nebraska for about a year. Jane and 'Grandmother' Wheeler were exact opposites. They were given rooms as far as possible away from each other. Grandmother Wheeler firmly believed every one should work and wasn't slow in speaking her mind. Written by Laura May McMaster Timmel Written 1957,Assembled 1960.\n\nWhether the above account of Jane McMaster and family is fact leaves room for doubt. The following account is from the Civil War files of Jane's youngest son, George A. McMaster, obtained from the National Archives,October 2000: Jane McMaster Thompson filed for a 'Dependent Mother's Pension' on or about 15 December 1890 for a pension of $12.00 per month from theMilwaukee Agency (certificate #308018) based on the death of her son George. She stated at that time that she had no means of support and recorded below is the affidavit from her sister Catherine FrazierMcMaster Bennett: GENERAL AFFIDAVIT State of Wisconsin County of Milwaukee In the matter of the claim for pension of JANE THOMPSON, mother ofGEORGE MCMASTERS late a Private, Co. 'B', 8th NY Heavy Artillery personally came before me a Notary Public in and for the County and State aforesaid, CATHARINE BENNETT residing at 250 First Avenue, Milwaukee, his cousin, person of lawful age, who being duly sworn, declares in relation to the aforesaid claim as follows: That claimant and deponent are sisters and lived in County of Sligo, Ireland under the same roof, until the claimant above named was married. Deponent says though she was not present at claimants marriage with GEORGE MCMASTERS , yet they came back to my father's house a day or two after as man and wife and that they lived in the neighborhood as man and wife until he died. That they were married by a minister named Scott. That the date of claimant's marriage was August 25th, 1839. That deponent was present when George McMaster late of Co. B, 8th NY Heavy Artillery was born on the 22 day of May 1847 in York County, Province of Canada and parents were then both living and living together. The name of his mother was Jane McMaster and his father's name George McMaster. That the soldier George McMaster was never married. That deponent knew him well all the years of his life until he went to the war. That George McMasters, father of soldier, died September 22, 1847 in Canada. Deponent was present at his death bed. That deponent was not present at marriage of claimant with Thompson but knows by hearsay and knew that they lived as husband and wife. That her marriage with WILLIAM THOMPSON was May 11th, 1851 in Canada as she is informed and believes. Deponent knows that claimant has no means of support, and no one person legally liable to support her and has no property. I further declare that I have no interest in said claim and am not concerned in its prosecution. Signed: CATHERINE BENNETT\n\nI find the above information intersting as my Frazer traditions also claim relation to the Stuart's. I wonder whether she claims this through the McMasters or through the Frazer side? Also the reference to Edinburgh is interesting given other references to Scotland in the McMaster Family history. Also note that one of the witnesses to William's lease above was from Edinburgh.\n\n3. Catherine Frazer2 McMaster (William1) was born on 24 Jan 1827.
