        "text": "COWAN, William Alexander (1875-1960) was born in Guelph, Ont. on 18 November 1875 and attended art school in Toronto. He later spent several years studying at the Art Students League in New York City. In 1904 he took over his father's contracting business in Guelph and continued to work as an architect and contractor until 1945. After WWII he was appointed building inspector for the City of Guelph and played a major role in preventing the demolition of Guelph City Hall (by William Thomas, 1856-57). He also designed the south wing of the Wellington County Court House in 1955. Cowan retired in 1956 and died in Guelph on 11 June 1960 (obit. Daily Mercury [Guelph], 11 June 1960, 9; biog. 2 July 1975, 4)\n\n(works in Guelph unless noted)"
