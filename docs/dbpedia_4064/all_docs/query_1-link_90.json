He then served as a Methodist minister in New Brunswick before accepting an appointment as Principal of Mount Allison Wesleyan Academy in 1843. When the Female Branch of the Academy (later Mount Allison Ladies’ College) opened in 1854, he became Principal of both branches. Through his efforts, Mount Allison Wesleyan College (later Mount Allison University) was organized and he became its first President in 1862. He served until 1869 when he moved to Halifax and became the Editor of the Provincial Wesleyan. He continued to serve Mount Allison as a member of the Board of Governors. Wesleyan University conferred a DD on him in 1857. Rev. Dr. Pickard died on Feb. 28, 1890.\n\nDavid Allison\n\n1869-1878 (Academy and College) and 1891-1911 (College)\n\nPickard’s successor both as President of the College and Principal of the Academy was David Allison, cousin of founder Charles Frederick Allison. He was born in Newport, NS on July 3, 1836, and had attended Mount Allison Academy. He then went to Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, where he graduated with a BA in 1859. Beginning in 1860, Allison taught classics and law-related courses at Mount Allison Academy during which time he earned a MA from Wesleyan. He was appointed President and Principal in 1869. Allison was popular among the students, took part in many sporting activities, and always enjoyed a good horse race. He retired in 1878 to become Superintendent of Education in Nova Scotia. In 1891 he returned as President of Mount Allison College and, in total, he served 29 years as President. Allison retired to Halifax in 1911, where he died on Feb. 13, 1924.\n\nJames Robert Inch\n\n1869-1878 (Ladies’ Academy) and 1878-1891 (College)\n\nJames Inch was born on April 29, 1835 in New Jerusalem, NB. After attending New Brunswick’s Normal School, he received a first-class teaching license in 1850. In 1854, he joined the faculty of the Mount Allison Wesleyan Academy and taught in both the male and female branches. When Mount Allison Wesleyan College was opened in 1862, he joined its faculty and also enrolled as a student. In 1864, the year he received his BA, he became Vice-Principal of the Ladies’ Academy. In 1869, two years after obtaining an MA, he was made Principal. Inch is best known as an advocate for a university education for women and his motion to the Board to admit women was passed in 1872. In 1878, Inch succeeded Allison as President of the College, but continued to teach mental philosophy and logic. During his Presidency he began a modest building expansion program and nearly tripled the University’s endowment. In 1891, Inch left Mount Allison to take the post of chief superintendent of education in New Brunswick, where he remained until retirement in 1909. Inch died in Amherst, NS on Oct. 13, 1912.\n\nDavid Allison\n\n1891-1911\n\nDavid Allison served a second term as President between 1891 and 1911.\n\nByron Crane Borden\n\n1911-1923\n\nB. C. Borden was born in Avonport, NS on Nov. 27, 1850. He had taught in Nova Scotia public schools before attending Mount Allison and graduating in 1878 with a BA. He then entered the Methodist ministry and after seven years serving congregations in Bermuda and Nova Scotia, he was appointed Principal of the Ladies’ College in 1885; he shared his duties with Preceptress Mary Mellish Archibald. Borden also taught in the University and served as Dean of the Faculty of Theology. Borden became President in 1911 and steered the University through financial crises, war, and economic depression. He resigned in 1923 and was immediately appointed to a four-year term as Chair of the Board of Regents. Borden died on July 17, 1929 in Annapolis Royal, NS.\n\nGeorge Johnstone Trueman\n\n1923-1945\n\nGeorge Trueman was born on Jan. 30, 1872 in Point de Bute, NB. He attended the Provincial Normal School in Fredericton in 1891 and then taught before entering Mount Allison in 1893. For a variety of reasons, Trueman did not graduate until 1902, with a BA. He then went to Europe where he studied the science of teaching at the University of Berlin and the University of Heidelburg. Returning to Sackville, Trueman accepted a teaching position at the Mount Allison Academy. While teaching, he completed an MA degree, which he received from Mount Allison in 1904. He next taught at and then became the Principal of Stanstead College in Quebec where he remained until 1920. Through a leave of absence he was able to attend Columbia University and was awarded a PhD in 1919. After a term as the assistant secretary in the Education Office of the Methodist Church of Canada, from 1920–23, Trueman accepted the position as President of Mount Allison University. He was the first President to hold a doctorate. Trueman served for 23 years, until 1945. After his retirement, he served on the Board of Regents and on Sackville Town Council. He was elected Mayor in January 1949, but his term was of short duration because he suffered a stroke and died on Feb. 18, 1949.\n\nWilliam Thomas Ross Flemington\n\n1945-1962\n\nRoss Flemington was born in Newfoundland on Oct. 11, 1897. He attended the Provincial Normal College and graduated in 1916. He immediately enlisted in the Army and was sent overseas. Upon returning, he entered Mount Allison University and graduated with a BA in 1922 and a MA in 1923. In 1924 he accepted the position of vice-principal of the Mount Allison Academy and held it while studying in the Theological School from which he graduated in 1926. Next, Flemington took post-graduate work at Columbia and the Ontario College of Education and received a Bachelor of Pedagogy in 1930. That same year he became Principal of the Mount Allison Academy. When World War II broke out, Flemington enlisted and ultimately became the Chief Protestant Chaplain Overseas. Flemington returned to Mount Allison to accept the position of President in 1945. He served in that capacity for 17 years, until 1962 when he became Director of Education in the federal External Aid office. Upon retirement from that position, Flemington became New Brunswick’s first Ombudsman, 1967 to 1971. He received an Order of the British Empire in 1944 and was made Companion of the Order of Canada in the late 1960s. Flemington died at his home in Port Elgin, NB on July 10, 1971.\n\n​William Stanley Hayes Crawford\n\n1962-1963 (Acting)\n\nPresident Ross Flemington left Mount Allison a year earlier than planned to take a position with the federal External Aid office and William S. H. Crawford, head of the Mathematics Department, agreed to become the acting President for one year while the Board searched for a new President. See below for information about Crawford’s Presidency, 1975–80.\n\nLaurence Harold Cragg\n\n1963-1975\n\nLaurie Cragg was born on Sept. 7, 1912 in Lethbridge, AB. He was a graduate of the University of Toronto, earning a BA with Honours in 1934, an MA in 1935, and a PhD in physical chemistry in 1937. From 1937 to 1943 Cragg was professor of chemistry at Brandon College. He then taught at McMaster University from 1943 to 1959 at which time he was appointed vice-president at the University of Alberta. He held that position until 1963 when he came to Mount Allison to serve as its seventh President. He remained at Mount Allison University until June 1975. Cragg was a well-known chemist whose research included blood plasma substitutes and the physical chemistry of high polymers. During his Presidency at Mount Allison, he oversaw the construction of the Mount Allison Chapel, the Ralph Pickard Bell Library, the Marjorie Young Bell Conservatory of Music, and Marjorie Young Bell Convocation Hall. He was the recipient of the Chemical Education Award from the Chemical Institute of Canada and a 1967 Centennial Medal. The L.H. Cragg Resource Centre at Mount Allison bears his name.
