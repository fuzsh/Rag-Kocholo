        "text": "During the 1950s changing exhibitions were presented in Mills Memorial Library―coincidentally on the exact site of the present day McMaster Museum of Art / Alvin A. Lee Building.\n\nDr. Naomi Jackson Groves, as specialist in the work of German artist Ernst Barlach, and a painter herself taught at McMaster University from 1951-58 and became the catalyst for lively and widespread art activities on campus.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s several McMaster faculty members contributed to the formulation of a coherent permanent collection at the University. Notably: Dr. George Wallace, Dr. Karl Denner, Dr. Alexander McKay, Dr. Paul Walton.\n\nAs a result of their efforts, European prints and Canadian art were regularly added to the collection and their teaching philosophy, which valued the direct experience of original works of art, was embraced by the University.\n\nWithout a doubt, one of the most significant donors to the McMaster Museum of Art was Dr. Herman Herzog Levy, O.B.E. (1902- 1990).\n\nLevy was the grandson of Jewish immigrants from Alsace Lorraine who settled in Canada in the late 19th century. His grandfather established a very successful family-run business in Hamilton called Levy Brothers which specialized in diamond and jewellery importing, a business which the young Herman Levy himself joined in 1923.\n\nIt was around this time that Levy also first developed his interest in art while completing an apprenticeship in Amsterdam. Regular visits to the city’s many museums and galleries allowed him time to look at art and develop his eye.\n\nHerman Levy also made some of his first purchases at that time including early European woodcut prints and maps and thus established a lifelong practice―the careful examination, contemplation and experience of objects of quality.\n\nThe family business, Levy Brothers, flourished for many years until 1960 when Herman Levy made the decision to devote his energies exclusively to art. As he explained it, “I liquidated the company and retired from business to look at some paintings, sculpture and some types of Chinese art and Romanesque architecture.”\n\nHerman Levy had a long association with McMaster University which was well established by the mid-1930s. He had a lifelong friendship with 3 professors from the Department of Classics: Dr. Edward Togo Salmon, Dr. Clement Stearn and Dr. Alexander MacKay. In 1947, Levy donated funds anonymously for the purchase of a Red figure kalyx-crater from the 5th century BC in honour of Dr. Stearn. It was his first donation.\n\nThe antiquities collection had begun only a few years earlier, in 1940, with acquisitions by Dr. Stearn and Professor Homer Thompson of the Royal Ontario Museum. Subsequent donations came from McMaster alumni, including Charles P. Fell, and Jennifer and Theodore Arcand.\n\nThe coin collection grew exponentially in the 1990s under honorary curators Mr. Walter Kowalski and Mr. Bruce R. Brace.\n\nThe Museum’s collection of antiquities grew to over 200 objects; pottery, glass, carvings and jewelry from Mediterranean cultures, China and Japan, dating from the Bronze Age (beginning around 3600—3200 BC) to the Modern era. It also includes approximately 700 coins from the Mediterranean World, The Americas, Asia, and Europe, dating from the 8th century BC to the 20th century. It is currently overseen by honorary curator Dr. Spencer Pope from the Department of Classics.\n\nThe red figure kalyx-crater, made possible by Herman Levy, continues to be a centerpiece.\n\nDr. Alvin A. Lee served as President and Vice-Chancellor of McMaster University from 1980 to 1990 and was an influential champion of the University art gallery and collection.\n\nHe understood the broad educational benefit that art contributes to learning at a University and was directly responsible for the significant growth of the collection and development of the new Museum facility.\n\nIn 1983, Dr. Lee received a visit from Herman Levy. During their conversation, Levy asked, “What are your plans for the art gallery?” Ideas that had been germinating were set in motion.\n\nIn recognition of Dr. Lee’s significant contributions, the building that now houses the McMaster Museum of Art was later officially renamed the “Alvin A. Lee Building.”\n\nKim Ness, served as the Director and Curator of the McMaster Museum of Art from 1984 – 2003, a period of major transformation for the Museum.\n\nShe first met Herman Levy in 1984 and, thereafter, regularly visited him at his Undercliffe home for afternoon tea and lively discussion about all things art related.\n\nNess worked directly with Levy on the donation and stewardship of his collection and was at the helm of the Museum throughout its move to a new, state-of-the-art facility; and the implementation of the Levy Bequest purchase program.\n\nHerman Levy Collection Highlights\n\nWaterloo Bridge, Sunlight Effect, 1903 by French artist Claude Monet hung over the fireplace of Levy’s sitting room.\n\nOne of Monet’s early landscapes “Impression: Sunrise” is credited as having provided the name for a group of painters who first exhibited together in Paris in 1874. At the time, critics and the public alike responded with outrage at the brilliant colours, broken brushstrokes, and depictions of light and atmosphere in the work of the so-called “Impressionists.”\n\nLater in his career, Monet concentrated on depicting a series of subjects under changing environment and light conditions. He painted 42 such views of Waterloo Bridge, conveying the sensation of mist, clouds, water, smoke and city traffic.\n\nCamille Pissarro, Pommiers en fleurs, 1870, oil on canvas.\n\nA London art dealer was so impressed by Herman Levy during the negotiations for the purchase of Pommiers en fleur by Camille Pissarro that the dealer’s widow still spoke of the occasion with enthusiasm more than thirty years later. Herman Levy purchased the Pissarro in 1956 only after repeated visits to the commercial gallery, detailed discussions with the dealer in which he tested his knowledge, thorough examination and quiet contemplation. When the sale was concluded, Levy insisted on taking the dealer and his wife on a tour of London’s diamond market so he could show them the considerable skill required in his own profession to assess the colour and quality of diamonds.\n\nAlbrecht Dürer, The Sea Monster, 1498, engraving on paper.\n\nAs a painter, printmaker and theoretician, Dürer’s influence throughout the 16th century was considerable, not only in Germany but also in the Netherlands and Italy.\n\nThe Sea Monster engraving was titled by Dürer in a journal kept during his visit to the Netherlands. A preliminary drawing for the female figure is in the Albertina, Vienna. Several interpretations of the image have been suggested. It may depict a mythological abduction scene. It is probably an illustration based on Ovid’s Metamorphosis depicting the rescue of the goddess Perimele by the river-god Achelous.\n\nHerman Levy Honoured\n\nIn November 1985, Herman Levy received a Doctor of Laws honoris causa, in honour of his exceptional contribution to the cultural life of Hamilton and generous donations to several Ontario art Museums. His modest response, was typical:\n\n“It is strange that I am being rewarded for doing what I like doing best―looking at beautiful things.”\n\nA lifelong learner, Levy audited lectures at McMaster University until a few months before he passed away, June 17, 1990.\n\nHerman Levy’s Bequest\n\nThe Herman Levy Bequest was announced in 1991. It provided $15.25 million for the specific purpose of acquiring art. He said, “Collections last, buildings don’t.” His only proviso was that the artwork be non-North American in origin, in keeping with his own collecting preference.\n\nImage is from the 25th anniversary exhibition in the McMaster Art Gallery, Togo Salmon Hall in 1992. On the walls are highlights from the collection, including several brand new additions―paintings by Otto Dix and Jean-Victor Bertin―purchased with the Levy Bequest.\n\nA New Building\n\nBy late 1988 the building of an appropriate gallery facility became a priority within the University’s master plan and planning and program development was initiated. Subsequent to this, the Gallery became an autonomous unit within the University.\n\nIn 1994, The McMaster Art Gallery moved from its location in Togo Salmon Hall, to a new location in the heart of campus. The architects Moffat Kinoshita Associates set to work transforming the west wing of Mills Memorial Library. It was gutted, rebuilt, and refurbished with state-of-the-art environmental and security systems and reconfigured to accommodate the newly named, McMaster Museum of Art.\n\nMcMaster now had a facility worthy of its collection (approximately 4000 objects at that time.) The McMaster Museum of Art is a Category “A” cultural institution as designated by the Government of Canada. As such, it is responsible for providing the highest standards of care and preservation for its collection of paintings, sculpture, works on paper, and antiquities. For the first time in many years, there was room for that collection to grow.\n\nThe Levy Bequest\n\nLevy Bequest purchasing decisions were made by the Museum’s Acquisitions committee – with additional representation from the Department of Art and Art history including Dr. Karl Denner and Professor George Wallace.\n\nAcquisitions Committee members in 1994 were:\n\nBarbara Cooper\n\nAlexander Darling\n\nHugh Galloway\n\nStephen Jarislowsky\n\nNiamh O’Laoghaire\n\nMike Watson\n\nWayne Whillier\n\nand Douglas Davidson, who remained active on the committee for more than 25 years.\n\nThe first purchase that the University made with Levy Bequest funds was Walter Sickert’s studio drawing for the painting of St. Jacques Church that Herman Levy had in his collection. The decision to make this purchase echoed Levy’s own collecting practice – to identify an artwork that directly relates to something you already have.\n\nAnother significant work purchased for the collection was the Bird Bath by Henri Gaudier-Brzeska (French, 1891-1915). It was commissioned in 1914 by art critic Roger Fry, but never completed due the outbreak of WWI and the artist’s death.\n\nWith the Levy Bequest, McMaster was able to purchase both the finished bronze for the sculpture, produced scaled up as an edition of three in 1992, and the artist’s original maquette from 1914.\n\nThe bronze now sits in the centre of the lawn in front of the Museum. Its angular, stylized forms produce dramatic light and dark planes.\n\nResearch at the McMaster Museum of Art\n\nExtensive research has been done on works of art in the collection by art historians and scholars at McMaster University and around the world.\n\nFor over fifty years a painting in the Levy collection had been mistakenly attributed to Flemish painter Michael (Michiel) Sweerts (1618 – 1664). UK Art expert Lawrence Hendra recognized it as a rare portrait by 17th century British artist Mary Beale (1663 – 1699). This was verified by Tabitha Barber, Curator at Tate Britain.\n\nMary Beale is considered to be the first woman professional portraitist in England, and while successful at a time when women artists were not accepted, her work and contributions gradually faded from view. There has been a renewed interest and a scholarly revival over the past fifteen years. McMaster’s painting is a portrait of Beale’s husband Charles.\n\nPartnerships: Building on the Levy Legacy\n\n“As an art gallery in the heart of campus, the McMaster Museum of Art and its collections are a well-positioned resource for innovative students and scholars across all disciplines.” – Carol Podedworny, Director and Chief Curator, McMaster Museum of Art\n\nCarol Podedworny made it a top priority to develop research and collaborations campus-wide with the Museum’s collection as the nucleus.\n\nIn addition to the continuing activities with the Department of Art and Art history; programming, research, and exhibitions were developed with untraditional and arguably unexpected McMaster partners including experts from Departments of Applied Radiation Sciences, Family Medicine, Physics and Astronomy, Psychology, Neuroscience & Behavior, Entomology, Molecular Biology, Computer Engineering, English, Communications and Multimedia, Music, Athletics, and many more."
