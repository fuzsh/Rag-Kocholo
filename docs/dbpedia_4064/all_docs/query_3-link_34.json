        "text": "chapter 18\n\nAn Act to proclaim Lincoln Alexander Day\n\nAssented to December 12, 2013\n\nPreamble\n\nLincoln MacCauley Alexander, one of the most outstanding and accomplished Ontarians of our time, was born on January 21, 1922.\n\nRising above the prejudice of the era, he embraced the opportunity of public education. He developed his talents and reached his full potential through disciplined study and the strength of his character.\n\nHe served in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II. Home again after the war, he graduated from McMaster University and Osgoode Hall Law School and qualified as a lawyer.\n\nResponding to the call of public service, he was elected to the House of Commons in 1968, representing Hamilton West. In 1979, he was appointed to be Minister of Labour, making history as the Government of Canada’s first black Cabinet Minister. Later he served as Chair of the Workers’ Compensation Board of Ontario, now known as the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board, as the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, the representative of Her Majesty the Queen, and as Chancellor of the University of Guelph, among many other community contributions.\n\nHe passed away on October 19, 2012 at the age of 90.\n\nHis life was an example of service, determination and humility. Always fighting for equal rights for all races in our society, and doing so without malice, he changed attitudes and contributed greatly to the inclusiveness and tolerance of Canada today.\n\nTherefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:\n\nLincoln Alexander Day\n\n1. January 21 in each year is proclaimed as Lincoln Alexander Day.\n\nCommencement\n\n2. This Act comes into force on the day it receives Royal Assent.\n\nShort title"
