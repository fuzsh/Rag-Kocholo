The petition was sent to the Justices of the Quarter Sessions to be held at Sunbury, Northumberland County, Pa. Aug 1785. I copied the petition while at Sunbury a couple of years ago. The County of Lycoming was formed after the Township of Lycoming. Some of the folks on the petition had settled prior to 1785 and where forced to flee during the revolution due to the Indian raids. there is quite a bit of History on this, it was called the Great Runaway. Many settlers killed and most fleeing to fort Augusta, the Indians having sided with the British. Two of my possible ancestors James Alexander and Joseph Alexander also signed the petition, Chris Alexander. - Earl Pendleton. 2 Inscription: 1st PA Regt. Cont.
