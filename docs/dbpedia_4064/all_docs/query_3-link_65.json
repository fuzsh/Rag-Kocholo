        "text": "William Alexander Macdonald was a lawyer, politician and judge. He lived at 1875 Robson Street in 1909 and at 1816 Haro Street from 1910 to 1918. From 1920 to 1941, he was at 1884 Haro Street.\n\nWilliam was born in St. Catharines, Ontario, on June 7, 1860. His father was Frederick William Macdonald (1831-1904), who was a lawyer and master in chancery. William’s mother was Eliza Clara [surname unknown, but possibly Macdonald] (1831-1898).\n\nWilliam went to school at St. Catharines Collegiate Institute, and later went to Osgoode Hall in Toronto, Ontario. He became a member of the Ontario Bar in 1882.\n\nIn 1882, he was called to the Manitoba Bar, and he had a law practice in Brandon, Manitoba.\n\nOn October 8, 1884, in Dunnville, Ontario, William married Mary Elizabeth Gamble. She was born on December 28, 1864, in Ontario. Her parents were William Gamble and Mary Ardeely.\n\nWilliam carried on his law practice in Brandon until 1897. He was appointed as a Queen’s Counsel (later King’s Counsel) in 1892. He was a bencher for the Law Society of Manitoba from 1895 to 1898.\n\nHe was elected to the Manitoba Legislature in the general election on July 23, 1892. His election was voided, and he was defeated in a by-election held September 8, 1892. He was the leader of the official opposition for a short time.\n\nIn 1897, William moved to Nelson, British Columbia, where he practiced law from 1897 to 1909. He was also a director of the Brandon and Golden Crown Mining Company, Ltd. Thomas Mayne Daly, the former federal Minister of the Interior, was the president of the company.\n\nThe mine was not very successful in its early years, although it did produce some gold several decades later.\n\nIn 1909, William moved to Vancouver, where he lived at 1875 Robson Street for about a year. He became a member of the firm of Cowan, Macdonald and Parkes (which became Macdonald, Parkes and Anderson in 1911). In 1910, he moved to 1816 Haro Street, where he stayed until 1918.\n\nIn 1912, he represented the Vancouver Board of Trade when the Dominion Railway Commission was investigating freight rates. He represented the government of British Columbia when the Federal Railway board was investigating passenger and freight rates west of Lake Superior.\n\nIn 1913, he became a justice in the British Columbia Supreme Court, a position which he held until 1933.\n\nIn 1915, he and Justice Aulay Morrison conducted a provincial inquiry into the activities of the electoral redistribution commission.\n\nIn 1920, he moved to 1884 Haro Street; he stayed there until 1941.\n\nMary died in Vancouver on June 11, 1921. She was buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Vancouver.\n\nWilliam later married Catherine Mussen Coy. She was born on September 29, 1860, in St. Catharines, Ontario. Her father was Frank Coy. She had been married before, to Charles King Moore (1865-1902), and to Robert E. Mills (1861-1918).\n\nWilliam was the judge during the trial involving the 1924 murder of Janet Smith, who was a nursemaid for the family of Richard Plunkett Baker.\n\nIn 1935, William conducted a federal royal commission on relief camps in British Columbia, along with Charles Thomas Mchattie , vice-president of Gault Brothers Ltd., and Reverend Edwin Braden, pastor of Ryerson United Church in Vancouver. The commission concluded that the camps had reasonably fulfilled the object of their establishment, and had afforded the intended relief.\n\nIn 1936, William prepared a report that responded to allegations in a report by Wilfred A. Tucker, which had found problems within the City of Vancouver police force. In contrast to Mr. Tucker’s report, William found the police to be honest and reasonably efficient.\n\nCatherine died in Vancouver on November 16, 1940. She was buried in Victoria Lawn Cemetery in St. Catharines.\n\nIn 1941, William celebrated his 81st birthday.\n\nIn 1942, he moved to 4412 Marguerite Avenue in Vancouver.\n\nHe was a member of the Vancouver Club, the Jericho Country Club, and was president of the Vancouver Curling Club. He became the honorary president of the Canadian Lacrosse Association. He also belonged to the Ancient Free and Accepted Rite of the Masons.\n\nWilliam died in Vancouver on October 1, 1946. He was buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Vancouver.\n\nWilliam and Mary had the following children.\n\nFlora Macdonald\n\nFlora Macdonald was born on October 30, 1885, in Brandon, Manitoba.\n\nOn June 10, 1908, in Nelson, British Columbia, Flora married Arthur Brittain Netherby, who was a banker.\n\nArthur was born on July 12, 1881, in Wellington County, Ontario. His father was Stephen Brittain Netherby (1835-1921), who was a school teacher. Arthur’s mother was Sarah Catherine Weeks (1844-1928).\n\nIt appears that Arthur and Flora were divorced in 1932. Arthur appears to have died between 1932 and 1936.\n\nFlora died in Seattle, Washington, on March 7, 1950.\n\nFurther information on Flora appears on the page for Arthur Brittain Netherby.\n\nHelen Mary (“Poppy”) Macdonald\n\nHelen Mary Macdonald was born in Brandon, Manitoba on June 27, 1887. She was known as “Poppy.”\n\nDuring the First World War, she volunteered to with the Maple Leaf Club for Canadian soldiers in London. Later she was an ambulance driver in London, followed by 18 months driving ambulances in France. She returned to Vancouver in December 1918.\n\nOn December 19, 1922, in Vancouver, she married William Harold Swan, who was a bank manager. He was born in Toronto, Ontario, on July 15, 1885. His mother was Henry Swan; his mother was Alison MacGlashan.\n\nWilliam and Poppy went to live in Toronto. In 1931, they came to spend a month in Vancouver; they rented Brigadier General John Arthur Clark’s house at 1931 Nelson Street.\n\nWilliam and Poppy later went to live in Hamilton, Ontario. In 1952, Poppy was injured when she was struck by a car while she was crossing a street in Toronto. She later recovered.\n\nOn November 17, 1959, William died in Don Mills, Ontario.\n\nPoppy died in Toronto on March 3, 1977.\n\nGreta Hutchinson Macdonald\n\nGreta Hutchinson Macdonald was born in Brandon, Manitoba on July 25, 1889.\n\nOn November 19, 1912, in Vancouver, she married Sheldon (“Sam”) Dwight Brooks. He was born on March 31, 1878, in Minneiska, Minnesota. His father was Dwight Frederick Brooks (1849-1930), a medical doctor who was also in the grain and lumber business; Sam’s mother was Anna Genevieve Keyes (1849-1920).\n\nSam died in Victoria, British Columbia, on September 4, 1946.\n\nGreta died in Vancouver on August 25, 1951.\n\nFurther information on Greta appears on the page for Sheldon Dwight Brooks.\n\nWilliam Bruce Macdonald\n\nWilliam Bruce Macdonald was born in Manitoba in November 16, 1895 (although some sources say 1896).\n\nIn 1917, he enlisted as a lieutenant in the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War.\n\nHe worked for the Powell River Lumber Company.\n\nOn November 11, 1931, in Whatcom County, Washington State, William married Kathleen Soohen, who was born on April 10, 1900, probably in Yorkshire, England. She had immigrated with her family to Regina, Saskatchewan, about 1913. Kathleen’s father was Thomas Tippen Soohen (1871-1932), who was an accountant; her mother was Helen Louise Ambler (1865-1948).\n\nin 1936, William and Kathleen sailed on the Empress of Canada to Hawaii. Lillian Kelly, the widow of Robert Kelly, along with Hazel Maclean and her grandson Victor were also on the voyage.\n\nIn 1939, William and Kathleen again sailed to Hawaii, this time with their son, Bruce Alexander Macdonald (who was born about 1938).\n\nWilliam died in Vancouver on June 13, 1944.\n\nKathleen died in Vancouver on March 25, 1982.\n\nSources\n\nFrederick William Macdonald (father of William Alexander Macdonald)\n\n“Ontario Census, 1861,” index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/MQ7J-QXT : accessed 30 Oct 2014), Fred W Mcdonald, St Catharines, Lincoln, Ontario, Canada; citing p. , line ; Library and Archives Canada film number , Public Archives, Toronto; FHL microfilm .\n\n“Canada Census, 1871,” index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/M43L-LCW : accessed 30 Oct 2014), F W Macdonald, St Catharine, Lincoln, Ontario, Canada; citing p. 103, line 10; Library and Archives Canada film number C-9922, Public Archives, Ottawa, Ontario; FHL microfilm 4396294; http://data2.collectionscanada.ca/1871/pdf/4396294_00073.pdf\n\n“Canada Census, 1881,” index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/MVFX-7ZD : accessed 30 Oct 2014), Fred W.

Miss Macdonald was a volunteer worker in the Maple Leaf Club for Canadian soldiers in London when she first arrived in England. She then joined the Army Service Corps as an ambulance driver in London, later going overseas to France, where for the past eighteen months she has been serving right up to the front line trenches. At the time of the last great drive she was just south of Verdun. Writing recently from Paris, Miss Macdonald announced that just as soon as the armistice was signed she made up her mind to be home before Christmas. ‘I can’t tell you how happy I am,’ she wrote at that tim3, ‘to be once more in civilization. We are taking three days of comfort after months of misery, and it certainly feels too wonderful for words.’ In Paris a dear old French woman thanked the plucky young ambulance driver and her companions for their work in helping her wounded countrymen. The gratitude of some Alsatians, dressed in their native costume, was also warmly expressed, said Miss Macdonald, telling of the stirring scenes in the French capital when the armistice was signed.\n\n“Canada, Births and Baptisms, 1661-1959,” index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/F2KC-DB5 : accessed 30 Oct 2014), William Harold Swan, 15 Jul 1885; citing Toronto, York, Ontario, 15 Jul 1885, reference item 3 p 359; FHL microfilm 1845877.\n\n“British Columbia Marriage Registrations, 1859-1932,” index and images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/JD8M-Z8M : accessed 30 Oct 2014), William Harold Swan and Helen Mary Macdonald, 19 Dec 1922; citing Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, British Columbia Archives film number B13743, Division of Vital Statistics, Victoria; FHL microfilm 2074225.\n\nMarriage Announcement, Helen Mary Macdonald and William Harold Swan, The Globe, Dec 22, 1922, page 12, page 12: “Swan-Macdonald –At St. Paul’s Episcopal Church, Vancouver, on Tuesday, Dec. 19, Helen Mary, daughter of Hon.
