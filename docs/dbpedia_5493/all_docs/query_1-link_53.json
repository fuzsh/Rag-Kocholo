        "text": "After playing in Paris, Hamburg, and the British military post at the remains of the concentration camp at Belsen, the Old Vic Theatre Company arrived in New York in April, 1946, on a victory tour for a battered but triumphant Western culture. Ticket prices were high, but lines at the box office were long and the atmosphere was frenzied with anticipation. The company opened with Shakespeare—“Henry IV,” Parts One and Two—and continued with Chekhov, Sophocles, and Sheridan: six weeks of repertory, fifty classically trained British actors, even a small orchestra in the pit. Although top billing was shared by the company’s two leading actors, Ralph Richardson and Laurence Olivier, there was no doubt who the star really was. Playing valiant Hotspur on opening night, Olivier employed a nervous stutter that made the exalted (and possibly intimidating) language startlingly real. The following night, in Part Two, he was unrecognizable in the minor role of ancient Justice Shallow, whom he played as a fixated beekeeper—an occupation that Shakespeare had failed to mention—upstaging Richardson, in the larger role of Falstaff, by continually swatting at imaginary bees. More brazenly virtuosic was the contrast between Sophocles’ Oedipus and the giddy eighteenth-century dandy Mr. Puff, in Sheridan’s “The Critic”: Olivier left the stage with his eye sockets streaming blood and returned, after a brief intermission, prancing in lace and a powdered wig. The Times, speaking for the conquered city, noted, “The spring seems to be given over to Laurence Olivier.”\n\nThis was not the spring that Orson Welles had planned. In March, just before the Old Vic’s impending visit made the news, he had announced the rebirth of the famous Mercury Theatre, starting with a musical extravaganza based on “Around the World in Eighty Days.” Soon, however, tales of disaster started drifting in from out-of-town tryouts. Forty-five tons of sets, a sixteen-hundred-pound mechanized elephant, and a Japanese circus were making for an epic level of chaos: on the eve of the show’s Broadway opening, the Times compared the backstage scene, perhaps inevitably, to Kane’s warehouse. Although several critics appreciated Welles’s old-fashioned showmanship—he promised a reporter that he was equally prepared to “act Hamlet and do a roller-skating act” to sell the show—“Around the World” closed in less time than its hero took to circle the globe. Welles, saddled with enormous debts and thousands of unsold souvenir books, spoke nostalgically of 1937, when there was widespread hope that he would single-handedly create an American national theatre: “I was the Laurence Olivier of that year.”\n\nThe twentieth century’s two greatest dramatic illusionists had more in common and, ultimately, more effect on each other’s work—as friendly, if occasionally cutthroat, competitors; as reinventors of Shakespeare for a modern audience—than has been noted even in the mountains of books that each has inspired. By 1946, comparison was unavoidable, and not just because Welles and Olivier were occupying theatres a few blocks apart. Growing up an ocean apart, they had emerged independently, in the mid-thirties, as the biggest theatre personalities and Shakespeare revolutionaries of the age. Barely out of his teens, Welles directed a sensational all-black “Macbeth,” in Harlem; Olivier—eight years Welles’s senior—was twenty-seven when he gave a performance of Romeo so painfully, youthfully awkward that London critics accused him of not knowing how to speak verse. To the wider public, they were, moreover, Mr. Rochester and Heathcliff: their film portrayals of these Brontë heartthrobs had turned them into full-fledged movie stars. And each was now paired with a matching screen goddess: Olivier was married to Vivien Leigh (who very noticeably accompanied him to New York) and Welles to Rita Hayworth (who just as noticeably stayed home). Yet neither was instinctively or even happily a movie actor. Rare in the post-Stanislavsky age, both lived in professional thrall to the infinite possibilities of false noses, padding, wigs, and generally disguising or (better yet) disfiguring makeup. Welles called it “camouflage,” suggesting more profound similarities between the men, since these physical transformations allowed the actor, as Olivier later explained, “to avoid anything so embarrassing as self-representation.”\n\nThis theatrical ideal had already got them both into trouble. Despite the swooning female audience, Welles’s flamboyant portrayal of Mr. Rochester, in the 1943 film “Jane Eyre,” had earned him reviews that he complained were “the worst accorded to an American actor since John Wilkes Booth.” He had agreed to take a mere acting job only after his career as Hollywood’s wunderkind—at twenty-five, he had co-written, produced, directed, and starred in “Citizen Kane”—came to an unhappy end, with his failure to prove that art could turn a profit. Still, he remained a fearsome presence. The unassuming director of “Jane Eyre,” Robert Stevenson, was clearly too intimidated to bully Welles the way William Wyler had bullied Olivier when, at the start of work on “Wuthering Heights,” in 1938, the cocky British stage star offered the same sort of grandstanding performance. Olivier had rebuffed Wyler’s corrections by informing him that his chosen medium was “too anemic to take great acting.” But Wyler persisted, and Olivier credited him for the rest of his life with teaching him how to act in films. And more: with teaching him to respect the medium, assuring him that there was nothing in literature, not even Shakespeare, that a film could not encompass.\n\nThe most difficult role for Olivier during his early years onstage was Henry V. Its problems were the opposite of those he had with film: Shakespeare’s blazing soldier-king was too unhesitatingly bold, his speeches too fervently jingoistic (“God for Harry! England and St. George!”) to suit the young actor’s comfort. Olivier later explained that he had been “frightened of the heroism” at the heart of “Henry V” because the feeling throughout England during the nineteen-thirties was against heroics, inclining instead toward the languid elegance of the immensely popular Noël Coward. Then came the war. And Olivier, performing a one-man show for British troops, discovered that Henry’s clarion calls to arms had a powerful effect on real and unquestionably heroic soldiers. He went on to read Henry’s speeches on national radio, and by 1943 he had a motion picture in the works. Seeking a director, he had asked Wyler, who passed him to John Ford, who found the idea that he might direct Shakespeare very funny. When other candidates fell through, Olivier himself took on the job, becoming the director, producer, and star of the most important English movie yet made—which was what he had hoped for all along.\n\nThe problem with converting Shakespeare to the movies was the disparity between the language and modern reality. Max Reinhardt and William Dieterle’s spectacular film of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” (1935) and George Cukor’s equally lavish “Romeo and Juliet” (1936)—the most expensive Shakespeare films made after the advent of sound—had both been box-office flops. Olivier, to prepare his audience for the linguistic shock, began “Henry V” with a performance of the play in the Globe Playhouse, circa 1600, with a cast of heavily rouged and floridly versifying actors (including Olivier, playing the actor playing Henry) working a rapt if obstreperous crowd: the mere mention of Falstaff raises a cheer; a reminder that the King has banished the old rogue brings a roar of outrage. The contemporary audience gets to see Shakespeare taken down from his pedestal, even while it adjusts to highly wrought Elizabethan speech as the only sort proper for an Elizabethan theatre. And then, just as we are feeling comfortable, Olivier’s camera leaves the theatre behind and, almost imperceptibly at first, moves out into the world. As real breezes begin to blow, the actors disappear into their characters, their flighty vocal lines dissolve into meaning—“Now sits the wind fair,” Olivier softly breathes—and the story is being told directly to us.\n\nOlivier then insures that the film is too unnaturally beautiful ever to be confused with reality. “Henry V” is a storybook pageant shot in the saturated artificialities of Technicolor; even the climactic battle at Agincourt is beautiful, with its knights in silver armor, its deep-blue sky, its bright-green grass. The only color notably absent from the battle is red: despite the reported thousands of enemy dead, no blood is shed. For, in addition to finding a visual poetry equivalent to Shakespeare’s language, Olivier intended to turn the play’s political meaning upside down. By judiciously cutting such episodes as Henry’s order to kill all prisoners of war, he masked the King’s brutality and, with it, Shakespeare’s ironies about the ways of power.\n\nFurthering this agenda, Olivier devised a way to effectively film Henry’s big vocal climaxes (without showing his tonsils, or forcing himself to underplay) by pulling the camera ever farther back, to reveal—in the most famous instance—a field of soldiers gazing up toward the King astride a white horse that rears and tears away (“God for Harry! England and St. George!”) on his last echoing syllable. And when, on the eve of battle, Henry reflects on the burdens of his crown, Olivier’s troubled face is shot very close, his lips unmoving; heard in voice-over, his speech seems to take us deep into the mind of Shakespeare’s “warlike Harry,” where no audience had been before. This was the king and the picture that England required in 1943, a picture dedicated “To the Commandos and Airborne Troops of Great Britain.”\n\n“Henry V” opened in New York in the spring of 1946, just days after the Old Vic had closed to sold-out crowds. The film had been a success in London, and, despite all warnings about the taste of “the great unwashed,” Olivier’s loyal backers refused to cut it for American consumption. And, clean or dirty, the Americans came, and they kept on coming, not only in New York but in twenty cities across the country. Whether spurred by an admiration for British wartime courage, or by a Time cover story titled “Masterpiece,” or by a creeping rumor that the film mixed familiar duty with actual pleasure, they turned “Henry V” into a box-office phenomenon. It broke the language barrier, the class barrier, the culture barrier: the opening scene of a broad audience comfortably enjoying its greatest literature looked—thanks to the film itself—a little like us.\n\nTo Welles, the great roller-skating Hamlet-reciting democrat of the American theatre, “Henry V” was a mine of possibility and provocation. He had known Olivier at least since 1939, when they had performed together in one of Welles’s weekly radio dramas. By the time of “Henry V,” Welles was struggling with a reputation as a film director incapable of commercial success (“Citizen Kane”) or, worse, incapable of finishing his films (“The Magnificent Ambersons,” “It’s All True”). But he appears to have viewed Olivier with warmth, as perhaps his only equal. Then, too, the pair were comrades in arms against the plummy British style of playing Shakespeare that prevailed in New York in the performances of Maurice Evans (Welles once claimed that he went to Hollywood to escape from Evans) and in London with John Gielgud. Although Olivier was only a few years younger than Gielgud, he seemed to represent a new generation, consciously opposing the old-fashioned style of “singing” verse—more melody than meaning—with a direct and even dangerous power that frequently put critics in mind of beasts of prey. Welles was not intimidated. But he had not been overawed by “Henry V,” beyond the fact of its success. He later remarked that the battle of Agincourt looked as though it were taking place on a golf course—which was to say that the film failed to make a connection between the characters and the outside world. He was sure that he could do better. To prove it, he started shooting “Macbeth” the following spring.\n\nWelles saw Shakespeare as something of an American. He was still in his teens when, in 1934, he collaborated with his former schoolmaster Roger Hill—one of the important father figures in his life—on an edition of the plays titled “Everybody’s Shakespeare,” which was designed to shake off the dust of the classroom and get readers to put on the plays in their local gymnasiums, dance halls, or back yards. Shakespeare belonged to us as much as to anyone: the playwright’s England, like present-day America, was “a kid of a country,” as Welles wrote in his introduction, “bounding blithely into the sunny, early morning of modern times.”\n\nThe blithely bounding George Orson Welles was born in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in 1915, and had been performing Shakespeare ever since he commandeered the theatre department of Hill’s Illinois boarding school, which provided the only formal education that he ever had, and his only steady home. Welles’s parents had separated when he was four, after his artistically ambitious mother took up with the family physician—who, as the official discoverer of Welles’s “genius,” was the other significant father figure in his life. By his own account, Welles was too busy fulfilling this genius to waste time being a child. In Chicago, where his family (and the good doctor) had moved, he became the star of his mother’s musical salon, while his father, whose tastes ran more to vaudeville and magic shows, descended into drunkenness. Welles’s mother died after a lingering illness when Orson was nine. His father died suddenly when the boy was fifteen; for much of his life, Welles firmly believed that his rejection of his father’s affections had killed him.\n\nHe was playing Tybalt in Katharine Cornell’s polite and predominantly British production of “Romeo and Juliet,” on Broadway, in 1934, when a would-be impresario in the audience, John Houseman, felt the earth shake on the entrance of the furiously energetic boy, whose rich mahogany voice “tore like a high wind through the genteel, modulated voices of the well-trained professionals around him.” Houseman eagerly hitched his fortunes to the unknown nineteen-year-old actor, becoming Welles’s producer, promoter, factotum, confidant, and general caretaker through a series of productions that made New York theatre history. Although Welles starred in several of these shows, his greatest gift proved to be for directing—and for making the director the star. After the Harlem “Macbeth” and Marc Blitzstein’s socialist saga “The Cradle Will Rock,” in 1937 Welles and Houseman founded the Mercury Theatre, in the commercial heart of Broadway. Their opening production, “Julius Caesar,” dressed in Fascist uniforms and lit with piercing shafts of “Nuremberg” lights, turned Shakespeare into the hottest political dramatist of the nineteen-thirties.\n\nTall and boyishly good-looking, Welles cut an ideally princely figure, yet he padded himself out to play the fat old comic knight Sir John Falstaff, in the Mercury’s biggest production ever: “Five Kings,” a mosaic that he pieced together from the “Henry” cycle. Biographers have been quick to note the relevance of the filial drama in these plays to Welles’s life: Prince Hal, torn between two fathers—the calculating Henry IV, the scalliwag Falstaff—banishes Falstaff upon taking the throne, causing the loving old man’s heart literally to break. Welles himself called this “triangle” the greatest story Shakespeare ever told. But the vast requirements of “Five Kings” underscored the difficulties in the way that Welles achieved his goals: distracted and disorganized, working half the night and partying the other half, keeping his spirits up with vast quantities of food and brandy—his most perceptive biographer, Simon Callow, calls Welles’s theatre “a temple of adrenaline”—teetering on the brink of failure and then soaring upward on a last-minute stroke of what everyone wearily agreed to call genius. But sometimes the chaos proved beyond redemption. Houseman observed that even a minor reversal sent Welles to his bed, where he lay for days “like a sick child, convinced that he was going to die.” And “Five Kings” was a major reversal: a shapeless five-hour catastrophe that closed in Philadelphia in March, 1939, taking the Mercury Theatre with it. Welles kept the scenery in storage while he went to Hollywood to earn the money—it was to be just a quick trip to the vulgar fleshpots—to get his Falstaff back onstage.\n\n“I wouldn’t be surprised if Orson Welles is the biggest menace that’s come to Hollywood for years,” F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote in a short story at the time, joking that the East Coast genius would force the studios to “start all over again,” as they did with sound. That is not far from what seemed to be happening when “Citizen Kane” was released, in 1941: multiple points of view, overlapping dialogue, and, the most renowned of its innovations, deep-focus photography, by means of which figures in the background were rendered as clear as those close up. Welles’s cinematographer, Gregg Toland, had been striving to perfect the technique for years, and the result was a diamond-pointed black-and-white—the effect was almost impossible on color stock—that made complex relationships tell at a glance: while Kane’s grimly determined mother signs the agreement that will send her son away forever, the unsuspecting boy is viewed through a distant window, playing in the snow. But the core of Welles’s revolution was to set the camera free, physically and dramatically. Gazing up at a suddenly towering figure, or rushing excitedly down a corridor toward a door that has just slammed shut—almost pruriently interested in what is going on behind it—the camera becomes a seemingly subjective intelligence, part of the story that it tells. Although this formal excitement was eventually to have enormous repercussions, none of the era’s big directors, not even the ones who subsequently worked with Toland—William Wyler, Howard Hawks, George Cukor—seemed to regard Welles’s achievement as a serious model. The only exception, working far from Hollywood, was Laurence Olivier.\n\nOn New Year’s Day, 1947, Olivier resolved to take on what he called “the big one”: direct, produce, and star in “Hamlet.” He cut the play himself: individual lines, subplots, characters—Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Fortinbras—all were omitted for the sake of a clear story line and a running time of two and a half hours. He abandoned the use of Technicolor, because, he later explained, “I thought it would be rather fun to do a black-and-white . . . and really show them some things in the way of focus”—that is, Welles and Toland’s deep focus. “I could create distances between characters, giving an effect of alienation, or of yearning for past pleasure, as when Hamlet sees Ophelia,” he wrote, “an eternity away down the long corridor . . . sitting on a solid wooden chair—in focus—with love clearly in her eyes.” This has been called the longest-distance love scene ever filmed.\n\nBut the more arresting love scenes for most viewers occurred between Hamlet and his mother: lingering kisses, a confrontation played across Gertrude’s marital bed. (Awful to say, aside from predictably “phallic” interpretations of towers, pillars, and knives, one critic has compared the bed to “a giant vagina.”) The Oedipal interpretation derived from Olivier’s first stage performance of the role, in 1937, when the director Tyrone Guthrie took him to meet with the Freudian analyst Ernest Jones, the author of “The Oedipus-Complex as an Explanation of Hamlet’s Mystery”; even before that, it had been part of John Barrymore’s “Hamlet,” which electrified Olivier as a seventeen-year-old drama student in 1925. Nevertheless, biographers have not had to look very hard for Olivier’s own Oedipal motivations—no harder than for Welles’s motivations in his obsession with Falstaff—since Olivier once said that his first childhood memory was of his mother’s breasts “in a black lace sort of thing,” and that his father had disliked him from the moment he was born.\n\nA poor Anglican clergyman, Gerard Olivier had found the birth of Laurence, his third child, an undue expense. Although in his youth Olivier found his father’s miserliness a perpetual torment, it was the grand ritual of church that established his love for theatre, which remained his religion all his life. His early delight in performing was encouraged by his mother—“my heaven, my hope, my entire world, my own worshipped Mummy”—who died when he was twelve years old and away at school. Even Vivien Leigh believed that, in “Hamlet,” he was confronting this insupportable loss. (On the paternal side, Olivier’s beady-eyed, cagey Justice Shallow was said to have been a dead ringer for Gerard, and to have sent his stepmother weeping from the stalls.)\n\nIn theatrical terms, the Freudian interpretation—which posited that Hamlet hesitated to kill Claudius because he identified with the man who shared his mother’s bed—allowed the Prince to be shown as a strong, if tortured, man, rather than as the sensitive weakling that the Victorians had popularized, and that Gielgud still played to perfection. (Olivier called this the “castrated” tradition.) The truly shocking aspect of Olivier’s stage performance was his daunting physical power. This, too, came out of Barrymore’s emphatically American, swashbuckling Hamlet, which Olivier said had “put the balls back” in the role, but which he outdid in virility and athletic risk. Critics had announced that Olivier was tremendously exciting, if “entirely without melancholy,” and entirely wrong. This criticism may account for the fact that his film offers an extremely melancholy Dane. His acrobatic strength is still occasionally visible—he makes a perilous fifteen-foot dive onto Claudius while finally carrying out his revenge—but such feats do not comport with the Gielgudian wistfulness of the performance; in his grander moments, moreover, Olivier has a Victorian staginess unlike anything else he did on film. His frequent use of voice-over in the soliloquies, so effective as contrast in “Henry V,” reduces the lengthy workings of Hamlet’s mind to murmuring monotony. (Is this what thought is really like?) The performance suggests that playing weakness was Olivier’s greatest weakness.\n\nThe true star of “Hamlet” is the camera. The film is shot as though it were a nineteen-forties mystery—what the French were just beginning to call film noir—edged in darkness and soaked in paranoia. At times, the camera seems nearly sick with emotion as it leads us through the narrative maze. “I saw the camera seeing most things through Hamlet’s eyes,” Olivier explained, sounding distinctly like Welles in his early Hollywood days, “wandering, or running, through the empty corridors, piercing the vast shadows of Elsinore’s great rooms of state for some joy or the sight of some familiar object.” This visual language tightly binds the play, as does the scene of Hamlet’s funeral procession, which Olivier claimed came to him suddenly (in fact, he lifted it from Barrymore’s production) and gave him “the whole conception of the film.” Glimpsed at the opening, the procession brings the film to a thunderingly romantic end: the Prince’s body, laid on a bier, is carried up a twisting staircase to the turret; we get just a glimpse of his face—upside down as the bier moves past. And as the brass in William Walton’s score begin to shriek, and the cannon boom their salute, the grievous little cortège emerges into the open air and stands in silhouette against a glowing sky.\n\nWelles knew that Olivier was filming “Hamlet” when he began to shoot “Macbeth,” in June. Thanks to the success of “Henry V,” he was able to make a deal with a cowboy-picture studio, Republic Pictures, which was willing to take a chance on Welles’s ability to turn out a “superior product” on a budget so low that, no matter how superior it turned out to be, it could not fail. Like Olivier, Welles adapted the script—cutting Shakespeare’s shortest tragedy to under two hours—and signed on to produce, direct, and star. “Hamlet,” however, took six months to film; Welles shot “Macbeth” in twenty-three days.\n\nIf “Hamlet” approaches film noir, “Macbeth” resembles a cheap sci-fi or horror film. The papier-mâché sets were painted to resemble barren rock and to mirror Macbeth’s soul: the metaphysical unity that Welles had felt was lacking in “Henry V.” Welles is a somewhat dazed Macbeth—the murmuring-voice-over trap catches him, too—sitting like a petulant child on his high-chair throne, more Ubu Roi than the Scottish king. Despite the historical setting, Lady Macbeth—a serpentlike performance by Jeanette Nolan—is introduced wearing a forties gown. Reality is not remotely a consideration. But Welles wanted above all to create a world where the witches might be real, and here they are pagan priestesses hurling their spells against a sea of Celtic crosses—a theological battle that he wrested from the text by scavenging lines to produce a whole new character, representing the Church. With equal willfulness, he had the actors speak in a Scottish burr, chiefly to avoid both the British accent that he dismissed as “BBC” and the regional accents of his American cast; it also gave the words a lilting strangeness (“so right,” Welles told Peter Bogdanovich, “for all that gooseflesh and grue”). The result is a film at once embarrassingly bad and undeniably powerful. The viewer may laugh, but nervously: “Macbeth” is unrelenting, one long intensifying shriek.\n\nWelles managed to bring “Macbeth” in on budget and on time. Officials at Republic were thrilled until, as editing began, he ran away. Recalling Houseman’s tales about Welles’s hysteria at the scent of failure, one can only conclude that he was far less thrilled than his B-picture backers with what he had achieved. “Some of the individual scenes are the best things I’ve done,” he told a friend that summer, “but when they are stuck together, the picture may be a complete flop.” Although Welles had already started shooting “Othello,” Republic managed to cajole him into completing the film. In September, 1948, “Macbeth” was proudly entered in the Venice International Film Festival—and immediately withdrawn, when Welles realized that Olivier’s “Hamlet” was in competition, too.\n\n“Welles has failed utterly to live up to the standard set by Laurence Olivier’s ‘Hamlet,’ ” Newsweek announced when the films were released, and there was hardly a major journal that saw the comparison any other way. (“Hamlet” had indeed won the Venice prize for best foreign film.) Although several European critics displayed an enthusiasm (even a preference) for Welles’s work, in the English-speaking world he was taken for a bumbler unable to appreciate the Bard; Olivier, now Sir Laurence—he had been knighted during the filming of “Hamlet”—was Shakespeare’s representative on earth. Republic Pictures, its expectations crushed, recalled “Macbeth” for radical reconstruction. By the time Olivier was collecting Oscars for “Hamlet”—Best Picture, Best Actor—Welles had decided to leave America for good.\n\nA dark man’s face is seen very close, and disconcertingly upside down. His body is slowly revealed to be lying on a bier, which is carried from interior gloom into blinding sun. The only sound, a drum like a heartbeat, expands to a grief-stricken chant as a procession of monks following the bier is joined by a second procession—it cuts across the frame much closer to us, its leading churchman as startlingly huge as a saint in a medieval painting—bearing a young woman whose pallor is set off by a black gossamer shroud. The funeral of Othello and Desdemona, unremarked by Shakespeare, winds along windswept battlements for four minutes before Welles launches the story of how they lived and died. A breathtaking tour de force, set to Francesco Lavagnino’s “hair-raising” (Welles’s word) score, the scene is a free expansion of Olivier’s interpolation of the funeral of Hamlet: nowhere else does Welles so clearly throw the gauntlet down. Most remarkable, the lyric intensity of this wordless passage carries through the entire film.\n\nIt is true that one comes away from “Othello” heady with the imagery more than with the verse, which may be the primary difference between the films of Welles and Olivier. Welles’s Othello is almost as muted as his Macbeth (one suspects him of struggling against his tendency to be a “hambone”), but his restraint acquires nobility beside the prissy Iago of Micheál MacLiammóir and the Venetian angel of a Desdemona played by Suzanne Cloutier, her gold hair strewn with pearls. If these are not virtuoso performances, there is among them not a note of declamation, or a moment’s sense of transposed theatre. The faces, the language, the velvety darks of Venetian streets, the wheeling gulls over Cyprus—all merge in a work that seems as independent, in its way, as Verdi’s opera, by which Welles was reportedly inspired. But his real inspiration seems to have come from the French directors who had taken the exile in as one of their own. “Othello” often looks so much like a work of the French poetic tradition that one is surprised to hear its characters speaking English: like Cocteau’s “Beauty and the Beast,” in its fairy-tale air and its black-and-pewter tones; like Marcel Carné’s “Children of Paradise,” whose art director, Alexander Trauner, Welles had managed to steal away. Trauner based his designs on the sixteenth-century Venetian painter Carpaccio, but Welles contrived to capture not so much the look of the paintings as the immediate, gleaming life from which the painter drew.\n\nIt seems a wonder that Welles finished the film at all. He financed it entirely himself, and adapted constantly as he went along. When constructing sets turned out to be too expensive, he filmed in various locations in Italy, Portugal, and Morocco. In one famous instance, when costumes did not arrive, he reset the scene of Roderigo’s murder in a Turkish bath. The process took nearly four years—from 1948 to 1952—during which Welles continually interrupted shooting to take on acting roles in other films. Even “The Third Man” was done only to earn the money to resume “Othello.” Because the filming was often done out of doors, it was impossible to capture sound, so dubbing—with all its synchronization problems—was required. Actors came and went. The whole extraordinarily flowing film was painstakingly pieced together from shots made years and countries apart. “Roderigo kicks Cassio in Massaga,” Welles enjoyed explaining, “and gets punched back in Orgete, a thousand miles away.”\n\nHe was still editing “Othello” when Olivier, who was making forays into theatrical producing, invited him to direct and/or star in a play in London, in the fall of 1951. Welles chose to do both, in “Othello.” This was the first time the men had worked together since 1939, and Welles was cautious, perhaps even intimidated, confiding to his biographer Barbara Leaming, “I wanted to do as much of an English ‘Othello’ as I could.” Olivier by then had played every major Shakespeare hero except Othello, a role he regarded as “pretty well unplayable” and inevitably upstaged by Iago. (Welles could not resist telling Olivier that he should never play the role, since he lacked the requisite bass voice.) Nevertheless, by Welles’s admission, Olivier freely advised him on interpretation. And there is some evidence that Welles, departing from his film performance, approached Olivier’s eventual accounting of the role: he wore a vain man’s big gold earrings, and his dominant effect was of a rising, dangerous rage. Reviews were mostly favorable, despite snide references to Welles’s infamous radio broadcast (“some dark monster invading us from Mars”) or, worse, to “Citizen Coon.” Olivier, however, was unimpressed, feeling that Welles had betrayed his immense gifts through a lack of discipline.\n\nIn May, 1952, Welles’s film of “Othello” won the Palme d’Or at Cannes. He was now the darling of the French critics, who had first seen “Citizen Kane,” like all contemporary American films, only after the war; for them, the thrill of freedom clung especially to Welles’s highly personal and expressive style. He found himself the guiding spirit of a new movement, in which the director was credited as the sole author of a film, an “auteur” in the same sense as Sartre or Camus. English critics, however, remained unmoved. “MR. WELLES MURDERS SHAKESPEARE IN THE DARK,” read the headline of one London review. In America, where distributors were nervous about even a sixteenth-century interracial romance, the film wasn’t released until three years later. Its box-office receipts amounted to forty thousand dollars.\n\nAfter this crushing failure, things went rapidly downhill, as Welles’s weight went wildly up. A modern-dress film of “Julius Caesar” was cancelled before it was begun. He appeared in a mini-version of “King Lear,” on American television, in 1953, but the new medium’s favorite Shakespearean actor turned out to be Welles’s old nemesis Maurice Evans, who still sounded the way Americans thought Shakespeare was supposed to sound. In late 1955, caught in the coils of a bungled film project, “Mr. Arkadin,” Welles fled back to America. He was forty years old. He decided that it was time to make good on the promise of an American classical theatre, in New York, beginning with “King Lear.” On opening night, in January, 1956, he received an ovation as soon as he stepped onstage, which he claimed unnerved him and ruined his performance. (“I knew I couldn’t possibly do justice to that,” he explained.) He had already broken one ankle—his weight was approaching three hundred pounds—and before the night was out he injured the other; he played the rest of the run in a wheelchair. The reviews were devastating, and all thoughts of future productions were scotched. He never appeared onstage in this country again.\n\nAs for Olivier, the mid-fifties merely settled his crown. In 1954, he agreed to film one of his most celebrated stage roles, Richard III—the supreme Shakespearean monster, whom he had managed to make wittily ingratiating, with a nose like the Big Bad Wolf and a troublingly sexual charm. As a director, he worried that he had exhausted his ideas, and “Richard III” has none of the shaping conceits of his earlier films, relying instead on a charged theatricality: exaggerated makeup, elaborate costumes, and the pleasure of virtuoso acting in and for itself. The following year, at Stratford-Upon-Avon, he took on “Macbeth” for the first time since his early Old Vic days; before the season opened, half a million ticket orders were received.\n\nOrson Welles was in Las Vegas when, in March, 1956, the film of “Richard III” had its American première. He had moved there with his family—third wife, third daughter—and was at last enjoying a big success, with an act at the Riviera Hotel, in which he mixed magic tricks with recitations from “Julius Caesar” and “King Lear.” Under the terms of a unique agreement, “Richard III” opened in movie theatres—in vividly colored wide-screen VistaVision—the same day it appeared on national TV. Tens of millions of people watched the NBC broadcast that Sunday afternoon, more than had seen “Richard III” during all the previous centuries combined. The following month, Welles moved back to Hollywood, where he appeared in an episode of “I Love Lucy.” The story revolved around his having agreed to perform his Vegas act for a benefit at Ricky Ricardo’s night club. Lucy, of course, wants to perform Shakespeare with him, and she attempts to win him over. “I think you’re the greatest Shakespearean actor in the whole world,” she gushes. “I think you’re better than John Gielgud. I think you’re better than Maurice Evans. I think you’re better than Sir Ralph Richardson!” To which Welles responds, after a slight pause, “You left out Laurence Olivier.” The studio audience howled with laughter.\n\nThere is a photograph of the two of them backstage in a Dublin theatre, in 1960. Olivier had come to see Welles’s “Chimes at Midnight,” a reshaped and mercifully pared-down version of “Five Kings,” which retained the essential story of Falstaff and Prince Hal. Neatly correct in a suit and tie, Olivier stands with one arm stiffly draped around Welles’s shoulders. Welles, in costume as Falstaff, returns a crinkly grin and gazes into Olivier’s eyes, as though seeking something there. In fact, Welles was hoping that “Chimes” would move on to London, and there was little that Olivier could not have made happen if he chose. Instead, Olivier asked Welles to come to London to direct his own first venture into the avant-garde, Ionesco’s “Rhinoceros”—although, according to Welles, Olivier did most of the directing, after informing the rest of the cast that Welles had been doing everything wrong, and sending him away, humiliated, a few days before the opening. (Austin Pendleton has written an ingenious play, “Orson’s Shadow,” about the “Rhinoceros” fiasco.) “He had to destroy me,” Welles explained, with an oddly inverted ring of respect. “He doesn’t want anybody else up there. He’s like Chaplin, you know. He’s a real fighting star.”\n\nThe establishment of Britain’s National Theatre was announced in 1962. In an acknowledgment of his near-Churchillian stature, Olivier was named director, and his début as Othello was the big event of the first season. He had trained like a prizefighter to expand his lung power and, working with a voice teacher, had managed to lower his vocal range by nearly an octave. His first appearance as a coal-black African lord caused a wave of shock; his makeup took nearly three hours to apply, and included gentian violet on the inside of his mouth, a pinkish coloring on his palms and the soles of his feet, and drops in his eyes to increase the white sheen. Playing a creature of swaggering vanity, sexuality, and pride, who is quickly reduced to a howling, nearly naked slave, he gave a towering performance that offered something to offend everyone.\n\nA filmed record of the production was made the following summer. Olivier approached the project apprehensively, and was not pleased with the result. (Many have found his performance far too broad; Welles happily claimed that Olivier reminded him of Sammy Davis, Jr.) Most of all, Olivier regretted that a “full-blown Shakespeare film” could not be made, because there was no money to make it. Despite “Richard III” ’s phenomenal première—or precisely because of the coup of the television showing—the film had failed at the box office, not even making back its costs. As a result, the gates thrown open by “Henry V” were closed; no one would take a chance on Shakespeare, not even with Olivier. He had already tried to raise money to film “Macbeth,” for which he had plenty of ideas, as his best biographer, Anthony Holden, has pointed out. (For one, it would have been shot in Scotland with—hats off to Welles—Scottish accents.) But Olivier did not have Welles’s Falstaffian stomach for begging, tricks, and impoverished stumbling through. “Richard III” was the last “full-blown Shakespeare film” that he directed or appeared in.\n\nNo one ever accused Olivier of playing himself, or presumed even to know who that person was. (“Scratch an actor,” Olivier said, “and underneath you will find another actor.”) Range and continual change were all. The only roles in which he displayed no interest were the morbidly unheroic Richard II, who was temperamentally the property of Gielgud, and Falstaff—whom Welles had been drawn to for decades, even before the tragic clown took him over body and soul. In 1964, Welles talked a Spanish producer into financing “Chimes at Midnight,” a movie so pressingly personal that it hardly seems surprising when Jeanne Moreau, playing Doll Tearsheet, blithely addresses Welles’s Falstaff as “Orson.” (This is what a French accent does to the Shakespearean epithet “whoreson.”) The result was sometimes as fractured as the process of getting the film made. Welles hired Gielgud to play the imperiously cold Henry IV, but he could pay him only for two weeks of work, and used a double for the rest; at times, all the major actors (except Welles) were doubles, and there were the usual problems with dubbing and synching. But Welles managed to impart an astoundingly rich physical texture to every scene: the wintry air, the glow of a fire in Justice Shallow’s hut, the fullness of the surrounding life appear so natural—the showy camerawork of his youth is mostly gone—that he seems merely to have photographed a world miraculously found. Yet we know how exactingly he built it, burning incense even out of doors to diffuse the light. Although one would hardly guess it from the look of the two films, Welles’s goal was not so different from Olivier’s in “Henry V.” “It mustn’t seem perfectly real,” he warned. “It doesn’t mean anything unless it makes poetry possible.”\n\nIn other ways, Welles’s late masterpiece is the deliberate reverse of “Henry V.” The divergence is clearest in the set-piece battle of Shrewsbury, where Henry IV consolidates his powers, and Prince Hal proves himself his royal son. Although Welles allows us the marvellous sight of knights lowered out of trees onto their horses, the romance of chivalry immediately gives way to barbarism: swinging maces, shrieks of pain, the clang of armor and the squish of mud as corpses pile high, and even the horses fall to agonized deaths—less Agincourt than Guernica. The soul-divided Hal, on succeeding to the throne as Henry V, promptly follows his father’s advice to “busy giddy minds with foreign quarrels,” and declares war on France. (When Keith Baxter, who plays Hal with unforced charm, told Welles that he wanted to go on to play “Henry V,” Welles responded, “Why would you want to do that? He’s a most awful shit.”) Opposed to all this power-mongering and death stands (or waddles) Falstaff. Welles is at his best when, wearing a saucepan crown, he mocks the old King—wickedly imitating Gielgud’s fluty tremolo—and when, at Hal’s coronation, he kneels before his beloved boy’s rebuke: “I know thee not, old man.” Welles expands on the plays to let us know, through the pain in the young King’s eyes, that he understands what he is giving up; the look that Welles returns, mixing paternal pride and stunned sorrow, makes this exchange of glances one of Shakespeare’s greatest moments, even if Shakespeare never wrote it.\n\nIn America about this time, the French veneration of Welles was finally having an impact. In 1961, the Museum of Modern Art had a major Welles retrospective, curated by Peter Bogdanovich. The following year, the critic Andrew Sarris introduced the “auteur theory” to these shores, and Welles was securely installed in the pantheon of the new academic discipline of film. None of which meant that “Chimes at Midnight” made any money—or even that anyone got to see it. It opened and closed in New York almost simultaneously, in 1967, after the Times complained that the soundtrack was incomprehensible. Although commercial failure seemed only to increase Welles’s highbrow status, when asked to comment on “the art of cinema” he confessed that “I’d rather be caught without my pants in the middle of Times Square.”\n\nOlivier was by now a paterfamilias, both to the National Theatre—working tirelessly as actor and administrator—and to his new wife, Joan Plowright, and their young children. But, as he approached his sixties, his body seemed to give way. Flu, prostate cancer, and pneumonia struck him in succession; he suffered from a rare and often agonizing muscle disease for the last fifteen years of his life. And yet it is possible that more people saw him act in these years than ever before, owing to the film and television roles that he took on, ostensibly because he needed the money for his family, but also because the work kept him alive. In 1983, at seventy-five, lacking the strength to appear onstage, he played King Lear in a television production. Pale and gaunt—Cordelia, dead in his arms, had to be suspended on wires—he was at once ethereal and majestic, and he seemed to feel that at last he was playing himself: “When you get to my age, you are Lear, in every nerve of your body.” He managed to complete two versions of his memoirs; looking back on the success of “Henry V,” the first thing he recalled was that some people had said it was “the best first film since ‘Citizen Kane.’ ”\n\nOlivier endured long past expectations, and when he died, in 1989, the memorial service, at Westminster Abbey, was fit for one of the kings he had played. In a grand processional, Paul Scofield bore a silver model of the National Theatre, Derek Jacobi the crown Olivier had worn as Richard III, and Dorothy Tutin the crown he had worn as Lear. The most revered theatrical relic, though, was a sword that had belonged to Edmund Kean. It had been passed down through generations of actors, and the unfailingly generous and admiring Gielgud had given it to Olivier years before. Olivier, however, had insisted that it stop with him. The high point of the ceremony was Olivier’s own voice resounding in the battle speech from “Henry V.” He was buried in the abbey very near the monarch himself.\n\nBut in the art of acting yesterday’s realism is today’s mannerism. Just as Olivier had rebelled against Gielgud’s way of “singing” verse, Kenneth Branagh has rebelled against the “oratorical, rhetorical style” of Olivier’s Henry V and his “self-conscious” Hamlet, and has remade Shakespeare for another era—brightly polished and wholly conventional. More daring films, such as Baz Luhrmann’s “Romeo + Juliet” and Michael Almereyda’s “Hamlet,” have turned the disjunction between Elizabethan speech and the modern age into the central ironic point: Denmark is the name of a corporation; ecstasy is a drug. This new method of meeting the same old goals has proved a huge success with an audience that no longer expects its world—on or off the screen—to be coherent.\n\nThe rise of this looser aesthetic has been a boon to Welles’s reputation. In the nineteen-eighties, “Macbeth” was restored to his original version, and in the following decade “Othello” was restored to a version superior to the original, in terms of sound—just when many English-speaking critics were coming around to the idea that technical flaws were part of his works’ “raffish” charm. Yet, while books and seminars on Welles today abound ad nauseam, the audience for his Shakespeare trilogy remains small. Although “Macbeth” and “Othello” are available on DVD, neither has received the deluxe treatment awarded to Olivier’s Shakespeare films, to “Citizen Kane,” or, for that matter, to Welles’s unfinished botch of a film, “Mr. Arkadin.” “Chimes at Midnight,” caught in a legal wrangle, has not been shown theatrically in this country since its initial failure, nor has it been released here on DVD. In recent years, Roger Ebert has campaigned for its release (“How can it be that there is an Orson Welles masterpiece that remains all but unseen?”), and scenes have started showing up on YouTube, which may help bring it back to light at last. Welles, who considered “Chimes” his finest work—“If I wanted to get into heaven on the basis of one movie, that’s the one I would offer up”—ruefully told of a Hollywood producer who, during Welles’s later years, inquired if he had ever thought of playing Falstaff.\n\nBy then, he was famous for being grotesquely fat, for appearing on talk shows, for selling cheap wine on TV. But he was famous most of all as the man who had got everything he wanted, and then—as a reporter says of Charles Foster Kane—lost it. The more often “Citizen Kane” showed up on lists as the best movie ever made, the steeper his descent appeared. By now, Welles’s monumental failure is as ingrained in the notion of who he was as the sound of his voice, even though “Othello” and “Chimes at Midnight” are more humanly rich achievements than “Kane,” and among the greatest Shakespeare movies ever made. Welles admitted to “thousands” of regrets, but he did not offer blame for the way things turned out: he did not care to look back at all. The real masterpiece was always the movie waiting to be made. Like Olivier, Welles kept on working to the end. He died of a heart attack, at seventy, in 1985, apparently in his sleep. He was found the next morning with a typewriter balanced on his belly. He had been working on the script for his latest project, a video version of “Julius Caesar” in which he was to play every role. His plans for filming “King Lear” were also well under way. ♦"
