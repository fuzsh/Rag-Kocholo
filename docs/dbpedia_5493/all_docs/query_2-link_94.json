        "text": "Spartacus: Kirk Douglas and Laurence Olivier star in epic film\n\nLaurence Olivier, often considered Britain's finest actor, this afternoon stars as the famous Fitzwilliam Darcy in 1940's Pride and Prejudice this afternoon, which airs from 2.30pm on BBC Two. The star plays opposite Greer Garson, in the film which tells the tale of the independent-minded Elizabeth Bennett, who comes to the attention of Mr Darcy. The pair's relationship becomes tense as Ms Bennett, much to her mother's frustration, grows tired of Mr Darcy's arrogance and snobbish attitude.\n\nThe film, which was remade decades later with the likes of Colin Firth starring in it, was a huge hit with fans, despite being a commercial failure.\n\nIt currently holds a remarkable 100 percent fresh rating on reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, and is championed as one of Olivier's finest films.\n\nA review by Bosley Crowther for the New York Times, noted how it was \"the most deliciously pert comedy of old manners, the most crisp and crackling satire in costume that we in this corner can remember ever having seen on the screen\".\n\nThe critic added: \"Greer Garson is Elizabeth—'dear, beautiful Lizzie'—stepped right out of the book, or rather out of one's fondest imagination: poised, graceful, self-contained, witty, spasmodically stubborn and as lovely as a woman can be.\n\n\"Laurence Olivier is Darcy, that's all there is to it—the arrogant, sardonic Darcy whose pride went before a most felicitous fall.\"\n\nPride and Prejudice was a huge success for Olivier, cementing his stardom among fans both at home and abroad.\n\nHis work in front of the camera would be recognised for a generation, and he'd become one of just four people to earn more than ten Academy Award nominations for acting.\n\nThe others in his company are Bette Davis, the first to secure ten nominations, Meryl Streep, Katharine Hepburn and Jack Nicholson.\n\nJUST IN: Maggie Smith opens up on being 'slapped' by Laurence Olivier\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

What I felt to be my image was boring me to death.\"\n\nBut the star continued with his craft, and years later was credited with ensuring British star John Mills got his shot at stardom.\n\nMills told the Melbourne Herald Sun in 1991, that he felt he had \"got really as far as I was going to get\" in showbusiness after seven years acting as a \"musical comedy, juvenile lead\" on the stage.\n\nHe said: “I decided I was going to try and get into the legitimate theatre.\n\n\"I was having dinner with Olivier and Vivien Leigh one night and telling Larry [Sir Laurence] I was pretty desperate.”\n\nThe actor noted how on the same evening, Tyrone Guthrie, who was poised to begin a new season at the Old Vic Theatre, stopped for a drink and discussed the problems he was having casting the role of Puck in A Midsummer Night's Dream.\n\nMills recalled how Olivier told the director: \"Well, you needn’t look any further.\n\n“The actor you want is sitting right there.”\n\nPride and Prejudice airs this afternoon from 2:30pm on BBC Two."
