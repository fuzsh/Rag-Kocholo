        "text": "Snowdon’s Vanity Fair Portraits of Helen Mirren, Ian McKellen, and More British Theater Talents\n\n1 / 21\n\nThe rector of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, London, his pink, kind face almost unlined though he’s 80, peered at me hopefully. “Excuse me,” he asked, “are you Alan Bates?”\n\nNow, what was doubly sweet about this is that I’m afraid I look nothing like Alan Bates. I wish. “Oh dear,” the stagestruck Reverend Gordon Taylor sighed. “I was longing to meet him.”\n\nThe rehearsal for the memorial service of John Osborne, which would take place the next day, was under way. Osborne, glorious voice of protest and un-English passion, had revolutionized British theater in 1956 with his Look Back in Anger at the Royal Court Theatre. (Alan Bates was in the original production.) “I have been blessed with God’s two greatest gifts—to be born English and heterosexual,” the famous dramatist declared in outrageous mischief. He aimed his Swiftian fusillades, John Mortimer wrote admiringly in The New York Times, at “all those who would turn the world gray in the name of political correctness.” And now we had come to celebrate his turbulent, memorable life in the little church that was founded in the 12th century.\n\nAt the memorial rehearsal, the rector was the director. Peter Brook, arguably the greatest theater director that England has produced, once defined the mysterious art of directing as “getting people on- and offstage.” The rector of St. Giles-in-the-Fields understood this in his bones. “You need to be out of your pew before the Elgar music has stopped. Otherwise it doesn’t flow,” he was saying to Dame Maggie Smith. “Then it’s back to your pew for the hymn.”\n\nShe nodded respectfully. She would be reading “Mr. Valiant-for-Truth” from John Bunyan’s The Pilgrim’s Progress. A born worrier, she makes you laugh on sight. She can fill any theater on either side of the Atlantic. She’s a peculiarly English mix of the suburban and the glamorous.\n\nDirk Bogarde, another of Osborne’s friends, was at the rehearsal, looking dapper. He would be reading a moving passage from Holy Dying, by Jeremy Taylor. “Oooh,” said Maggie Smith when Sir Dirk told her that she could park her car in the churchyard. “I don’t think I want to park there yet.”\n\nNot everyone at the rehearsal was a knight or a dame. They’ll just have to wait their turn. Michael Ball, the young star of Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Aspects of Love, strolled into the church. He would be singing “If You Were the Only Girl in the World,” for Osborne loved the romance and sentiment of the Edwardian music hall. There seemed no urgency. Flippancy under pressure—very British. And no one troubled to rehearse his piece—actorly one-upmanship that grew collective.\n\nDavid Hare, one of the foremost playwrights in England, would give the address. “Of course,” said Bogarde, “you’ll have to give the address from the pulpit.” “I’m too terrified,” Hare replied, and looked it. “Oh, I couldn’t. I would have to be ordained.” “Frightful coward,” said Bogarde.\n\n“Is it getting ugly?” Helen Osborne asked, giggling. She was John’s fifth wife. It was a happy, 17-year marriage. She used to be a drama critic.\n\nTrumpeters from the English Chamber Orchestra could be heard rehearsing in the church balcony. “Good luck!” they wished one another. “Good luck tomorrow.”\n\nI had gone to London—“This earth, this realm, this England,” as the United Airlines commercial goes—to celebrate British theater itself. England may soldier on stoically, but its theater still rules the English-speaking world like the last colonial outpost of an Anglophile empire. Few would deny, at least, that the American War of Independence has been lost on that oldest established, permanent floating crap game in New York known as Broadway. How come “little” England still rules the waves—but only in theater? Who are they? Come to think of it, how dare they?\n\nShakespeare, like God, is an Englishman. Therefore, the English believe, all theater began in England. They tend to overlook the Greeks. But classical Greek dramatists didn’t write in English. The historical continuity of England’s theater tradition accounts for the national pride (and prejudice). “We have been doing it longer than anyone else,” I was often told. Too often! But, after all, Shakespeare has been continuously performed in England for 300 years.\n\nPrestigious British imports dominate the long since Lloyd Webberized Broadway. Look at just a few facts from the contemporary scene:\n\nThere were 141 productions in the West End last season. There were 52 on Broadway—and a quarter of those were British. Those massive nonprofit theater corporations and power bases the Royal National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company between them produced 53 plays. There were a mere 8 new plays on Broadway last season; the Royal Court Theatre (George Bernard Shaw’s old theater) alone premiered 19 plays, and has more than 30 new dramatists under commission. The nonprofit theaters of England are the formidable tributaries to the commercial West End and Broadway. Four recent transfers to Broadway were from the National Theatre—Arcadia, Carousel, Les Parents Terribles (renamed Indiscretions), and An Inspector Calls. Two more were via the tiny Almeida in North London—Medea, starring Diana Rigg, and Hamlet, starring Ralph Fiennes. Each star walked off in successive years with a Tony Award, for best actress and best actor.\n\nThe common language that unites and divides us, the ambivalent sentimental ties that bind us, make for the complex “special relationship” between America and Britain. We’re like a split personality of cultural opposites. In acting terms and style, you could list some of the differing aspects of our national identities in parallel columns as the late Kenneth Tynan listed the qualities of Laurence Olivier (Burgundy wine) versus those of John Gielgud (claret):\n\nU.K.Theater\n\nOlivier\n\nShakespeare\n\nLyricism\n\nTea\n\nRhetoric\n\nAnthony Hopkins\n\nJeremy Irons\n\nEmma Thompson\n\nLloyd Webber\n\nU.S.A.\n\nFilm\n\nBrando\n\n—\n\nMethod\n\nPsychology\n\nEmotion\n\nDustin Hoffman\n\nJohn Malkovich\n\nMeryl Streep\n\nLloyd Webber\n\nThe differences blur—no young British stage actor in his right mind isn’t influenced by the film naturalism and awesome Method of, say, Pacino—but the division is in the heritage. England is built on a theater culture; America, though it has its great theater, is a film culture. “Theater is our primary way of self-definition, like movies in America,” said Stephen Daldry, the punk theater evangelist who runs “the chorus of dissent” at the Royal Court Theatre. Daldry’s Hitchcockian production of J. B. Priestley’s 1946 warhorse, An Inspector Calls, won him a Tony Award on Broadway. “But every time I went through customs, I was stopped,” he told me amusedly. “I’d tell them I worked in theater. They’d search my bags as if I were involved in some illicit pornographic activity. I’ve given up now. I say I work in movies. No problem! ‘Welcome to the U.S.A.! Good luck!’ ”\n\nThere is no real British film industry, least of all in the Hollywood sense. The biggest annual film budget in Britain would scarcely make a single Hollywood movie. TV’s Channel 4’s 1995 budget of £16 million helps to finance 18 small films: among its past productions are Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Crying Game, Howards End, and The Madness of King George. The successful producer behind them, David Aukin, worked in theater for 20 years and was the National Theatre’s executive director. Sooner or later in Britain, everything comes back to theater.\n\n“The American way,” Aukin pointed out, “is to say, ‘Why on earth would you want to do theater when you can be a movie star?’ But here, theater is the actor’s credibility and calling card. It tells the film world, ‘We’re not totally beholden to you.’ It marks them out as different and special, because Johnny Depp couldn’t do that.”\n\nThe British are stage actors first, and last. (Not like Johnny Depp.) Olivier virtually abandoned his Hollywood career to spend a decade founding the National Theatre. A succeeding generation of leading stage actresses—Vanessa Redgrave, Maggie Smith, Glenda Jackson—won five Academy Awards among them. And today the roots and heart of almost every British actor who has made it in Hollywood are in the theater—from Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson (“Ken and Em,” as they’re known in England, cozily curdling the crème de la crème) to Anthony Hopkins, Ben Kingsley, Jeremy Irons, Miranda Richardson, Daniel Day-Lewis, Gary Oldman, Ralph Fiennes, et al.\n\nWhen the British stage actor looks in the mirror, he is likely to see a character actor; his American counterpart sees a hero, or antihero (or the next Tom Hanks). At center the British are great character actors—transferring with effortless superiority from stage to screen. In addition to the native Room with a View genre, they have a useful sideline supplying Hollywood with, for example, its school of beguilingly charming, sometimes camp villains: Anthony Hopkins’s cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs and his Richard Nixon in Oliver Stone’s forthcoming movie; Alan Rickman’s Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and terrorist-aesthete in Die Hard; Jeremy Irons’s pseudo-cultivated alleged wife murderer Claus von Bülow, his treacherously languid Scar in The Lion King, and his own terrorist-aesthete in Die Hard with a Vengeance. They earn these born stage actors an honest mil or three.\n\nThe reserved and witty British need their theater like oxygen—or a fix—to loosen up, to understand who they really are behind the masks. I went to meet Michael Gambon, in his 50s perhaps the finest actor in England, though virtually unknown in America (he was last seen here on PBS in the dark, brilliant mini-series The Singing Detective)—a dangerous actor, “the Great Gambon,” as Sir Ralph Richardson dubbed him. Albert Finney calls acting “farting about in makeup”; Gambon calls it “shouting in the evenings.” He was taking a break from rehearsing his Volpone at the National, looking like a tall, podgy Everyman and smoking like a chimney. I asked him why theater is so essential here.\n\n“I suppose it’s because we’re so fucked up, really,” he replied. “We’re a complex people, putting on disguises and fronts, sidestepping. It’s just my instinctive response. But that’s why we have a real need for theater.”\n\nOr as Declan Donnellan, co-director of the internationally known Cheek by Jowl company (whose The Duchess of Malfi comes to New York this fall), put it, “Sex, murder, betrayal, politics, poison, kings, damnation, and salvation—all the things we really love! A good night out!”\n\nThe English also love pomp and circumstance. They own the copyright. It was Alan Bennett, an unapologetic monarchist, who nevertheless showed how the royals are really actors. “Wave! Smile at the people!” the king commands his wayward family in Bennett’s The Madness of King George, the film version of his original play. “Let them see that we’re happy! That is why we’re here!”\n\nI met Alan Bennett for tea amid the faux-Versailles splendor of the Palm Court in the Ritz Hotel in London. Bennett is one of England’s national treasures—along with, of course, the Queen Mother. He is nicely idiosyncratic, wry, unpretentious, and among the funniest writers in England. He was recognized almost immediately. A representative of the National Summer Fruits Association wanted him to join its annual strawberry tea party in the adjoining room. “Oh, no. I couldn’t, I couldn’t,” he apologized, turning pink. “Thank you very much, though.”\n\nIt was as if we were in one of his plays. What does he appreciate more than anything? “Silliness,” he replied, and began to laugh. “It’s the saving grace. That’s why Mrs. Thatcher is so un-English. There’s not an ounce of silliness in her. Americans have got much more gravity. They get things done more than we do. But they aren’t silly. It’s not to be confused with foolishness. But I couldn’t live without a silly streak.”\n\nIt was silly, really: even the Osborne memorial made scandalous front-page news. Unknown to the rector—naughty!—a notice by the church steps had barred entrance to four public figures. “The undermentioned will not be admitted,” the notice read, like a Lutheran pronouncement. The banned were listed as “Fu Manchu,” Osborne’s nickname for Sir Peter Hall, the former director of both the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre; “The Bard of Hay on Wye,” who is playwright Arnold Wesker (who lives in Hay on Wye); Albert Finney, with whom Osborne had feuded over royalties for the movie Tom Jones, which he scripted; and Nicholas de Jongh, an extremely self-important drama critic.\n\nThe fuss! “As to the note on the door excluding four people,” Lord Gowrie, chairman of the Arts Council (the equivalent of the National Endowment for the Arts, without the death warrant), wrote in the letters pages of The Times in reply to those who found the incident un-Christian, “who says the Almighty has no sense of humor?”\n\nSign in Hyde Park: “Please refrain from any leisure activity on this site until new grass has established itself.”\n\nSign in theater lobby: “Due to the indisposition of Miss Stacy Francis the role of Doris Winter will be played by Miss Priscilla-Mae Jones.”\n\nMusic-hall expression: “Don’t clap too hard—it’s a very old building.”\n\nThe verbal felicities—“Please refrain from,” “Due to the indisposition of”—keep up appearances the British way, the old-fashioned way, like West End theater managers in evening dress. The theaters are old.\n\nThe West End theater district began in the 17th century on the site of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane (now home to the Cameron Mackintosh production of Miss Saigon). West End theaters are basically Victorian, unless they’re Edwardian. Anything later is considered new. The air-conditioning within them could melt an iceberg, but never mind. It’s for show. The Python-esque culture clash comes with the different approaches to waiting on line. In the lobbies of New York theaters, there’s a sense of tumult and rush to get the tickets that only adds to the pre-show excitement. The English wait on line, silent, uncomplaining, obedient—even when another box office which is open for business has no line. They join the line. They love the line. “Ladies and gentlemen,” goes the polite announcement, “this evening’s performance will begin in two minutes.” We are waiting on line. “So that will be two tickets for Saturday night, will it, dear?” the box-office lady is saying. “Let me have a look-see. I think you’ll do better Wednesday matinee . . .”\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen, the curtain is about to rise. The curtain is about to rise.” No rush. We’ll all get there in the end. But one night I broke the line—it seemed reasonable at the time—going to a queueless box office. “You can’t do that! There’s a queue,” protested an indignant gentleman waiting on line.\n\nWe in America see the best of British theater. During my monthlong visit to London so pleasant, I saw 15 productions, for which I shall be receiving an honorary knighthood shortly. The reality of the West End is rather like a pupu platter—unlike Broadway, there’s a little bit of everything for everyone. Some of the marquees might convince you that time stopped in London circa 1949. One half expects to see Shaftesbury Avenue shrouded in fog. There’s the revival (or re-evaluation) of the shabby gentility and class-ridden British reticence of the Terence Rattigan oeuvre that Osborne and the new playwrights of social realism were thought to have swept away. There’s the ritual fare, such as Don’t Dress for Dinner, the jolly farce about double adultery and gourmet cooking; the Murder, She Wrote thriller genre; and the trusty old Mousetrap, now in its 43rd glorious year. The oldest theater joke actually happened to me. As the cabdriver dropped me outside the St. Martin’s theater to see The Mousetrap, he called after me cheerfully, “Enjoy the show, guv! The butler done it!” I’m not saying the butler done it, but that’s what the cabdriver said.\n\nAs always, appearances are deceptive. If there’s more pabulum in the West End than on Broadway, there’s also more choice. Among many new and classic dramas to see were Tom Stoppard’s memory play of the empire, Indian Ink; young Patrick Marber’s poker-playing morality play, Dealer’s Choice; Arthur Miller’s A View from the Bridge; Sean O’Casey’s The Plough and the Stars; John Webster’s Jacobean favorite, The Duchess of Malfi; and Ronald Harwood’s Taking Sides, his conscience drama of the life of the Berlin Philharmonic’s genius conductor Wilhelm Fürtwangler, directed by Harold Pinter.\n\nThere’s the Andrew Lloyd Webber empire and the Cameron Mackintosh empire—and there’s the rest. Mackintosh’s personal fortune is estimated at half a billion dollars. The global earnings of Lloyd Webber’s production company, the Really Useful Group, now approach $3 billion.\n\nLloyd Webber holds court at his 4,000-plus-acre Hampshire estate, Sydmonton Court, with its private chapel (where his mega-musicals are previewed before a select audience). Andrew Lloyds Bank, as he’s known, irritates some. “Easy come, easy go,” Paul Johnson wrote in The Spectator when Lloyd Webber paid $29 million for Picasso’s portrait Angel Fernandez de Soto. The British tradition known as the Tall Poppy Syndrome likes to cut uppity success down to size. “At least you know where you are,” explained Kenneth Branagh, who is judged as being too ambitious, not a gentlemanly thing—too pushy, in a sense too American.\n\nThe egos were always big; it’s the theater world that got small. As the world turns and spins, cats and phantoms and trains and helicopters and miserable French people are circling the globe, now and wherever. And it all began there, in the land of Shakespeare. Lloyd Webber and Cameron Mackintosh, in partnership, then separately, beat America at its own game. They invented a new popular culture as powerfully pervasive in its way as Disney—the global musical.\n\nBroadway traditionalists may not care for Lloyd Webber, but he seized the lightning at a time when Broadway was declining into remembered dreams, backstage stories, and uncommercial Sondheimian disenchantment. Look at his early choices: Jesus (Jesus Christ Superstar), the wife of an Argentinean dictator (Evita), cats (and T. S. Eliot’s cats, at that).\n\n“People hated even the name Cats,” Cameron Mackintosh, its producer, pointed out. “Everyone turned it down. I was probably the last person Lloyd Webber played it to.” (Mackintosh boldly chose a director who had never staged a major musical before—Trevor Nunn, then the boss of the Royal Shakespeare Company.) “Global hits didn’t exist at that time. Nobody thought about it, including me. I promise you.”\n\nBut he saw the opportunity. And when the aging ruling elites of Broadway woke up, it was too late. Mackintosh, the young British impresario, hyped, marketed, and merchandised his musicals in ways that had never been seen before. Cats invented the universal musical logo—a neutral symbol, a semiotic sign, a figure dancing in the eyes of a cat, like the mask (Phantom), the waif (Les Miz), the helicopter (Miss Saigon). The logos transcend language barriers; they’re instantly recognized everywhere; they go very nicely on souvenir T-shirts and mugs. When was there ever a Cameron Mackintosh (or a Lloyd Webber) musical that didn’t have the biggest advance ticket sale in history? It’s a spectacle! It’s a special effect! It’s an event! Barnum Mackintosh created Event Theater.\n\nYet, to meet him is to be surprised. His headquarters in North London is an 18th-century house. He comes into town two days a week from his Somerset home, a restored 12th-century priory. One has the impression he has always been a happy man. Ruling the musical world is a bonus. (Fifty-one Mackintosh productions are currently playing round the world.) He’s a likable man, now 49, unflamboyant, uncomplicated, clear. He possesses the more traditionally American enthusiasm and buoyancy—the vivid, confident belief in what he does—that were the territory of Broadway. “I’m no good at all at coming up with an original idea. I can recognize it. That’s my talent. Anyone who thinks they know what the public wants is an idiot. I’m still surprised and delighted the public likes what I like. I produce absolutely for myself.”\n\nAlthough the global musical was born in England, it has taken on the force of a multinational superpower. The unique identity of English theater resides in its celebrated tradition of great classical acting.\n\n“In England, acting is a heritage passed on through the ages,” noted a 1991 New Yorker profile of Michael Gambon. “From Burbage to Garrick, from Garrick to Kean and Macready, from them to Irving, and on to Olivier, Gielgud, and Richardson—and Gambon and McKellen. As is also true of great clowns, actors learn and borrow from their predecessors, who borrowed from those who came before them.”\n\nAs befits a king, Laurence Olivier’s ashes lie close to where King Henry V is buried in Westminster Abbey. He knew him well. Olivier’s plaque is found on the stone floor of Poets’ Corner—as popular a tourist attraction as Hollywood Boulevard—placed alongside the plaques of two other great actors: David Garrick, from the 18th century, and Henry Irving, from the 19th. They face the statue of Shakespeare, national playwright.\n\nOlivier (the son of a priest) continued the sanctified theatrical cycle when his astonishing, regal memorial service took place in Westminster Abbey in 1989, attended by 2,000 and rivaling the Battle of Agincourt in patriotic fervor. It was quite a production. The Abbey echoed to Sir William Walton’s theme music for Olivier’s film versions of Henry V and Hamlet. Paul Scofield, Ian McKellen, Derek Jacobi, Maggie Smith, Dorothy Tutin, “and also starring” walked in stately procession to the altar, carrying what The Times of London described as “Olivier’s treasury”: his insignia of the Order of Merit; a model of the National Theatre and another of the Chichester Theatre, both of which he founded; his Oscar (for Hamlet); his crown from the film version of Richard III; his laurel wreath from the Stratford production of Coriolanus; his Lear crown from the television production that brought him out of retirement; and his most meaningful prop, Edmund Kean’s Richard III sword, handed on to Olivier by Sir John Gielgud.\n\nRichard Olivier, one of Olivier’s four children, at 33 now making his way as a well-regarded theater director, was 27 when his father died in his early 80s after a long battle with illness. “There was a strange awareness that I’d seen him die a lot of times,” this gentle man told me. “In King Lear, in Brideshead Revisited. . . . Unlike other children, I saw my dad acting dying. He once told me, ‘I’ve played more than 200 parts, and I know them better than I know myself. I don’t know who I am when I’m not acting.’ And when I was young, I would cry at his death scenes. But when his death was real, I couldn’t cry.”\n\nAlmost crushed by the legacy of his father, he loved him. “I feel very grateful and proud to have spent that time with him,” he said.\n\nSir John Gielgud is the last of that glittering triumvirate—Olivier, Gielgud, and Ralph Richardson—who, with Dame Peggy Ashcroft, led British theater into its golden age. Gielgud’s acting lineage alone stretches back into the 19th century: his grandmother was a well-known actress; her sister (and Irving’s acting partner) was the legendary Ellen Terry—“the most adorable woman ever created by God or man,” said a swooning Swinburne.\n\nNinety-one and still active, Sir John is invariably sunny, talkative, and slyly modest. He lives on a 17th-century estate deep in Buckinghamshire, where, he told me, he likes to watch any old rubbish on TV. “I can’t keep away from the Simpson trial,” he said, laughing. “It’s rather bad theater. Too many interruptions. Still, I can’t keep away! I’m sure he did it, aren’t you?” He said he acts in “little bits” of films—“quite pleasant, not taxing”—and in radio plays, which he enjoys, meeting new people. He was too diffident to mention that one radio play, which celebrated his 90th birthday, was King Lear—the fifth Lear in his magnificent career.\n\nThe entire London picture changes with the power and creative volume of those nonprofit empires the Royal National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company. “Do the English people want a national theatre?” George Bernard Shaw asked 50 years ago. “Of course they do not. . . . They have got the British Museum, the National Gallery and Westminster Abbey, but they never wanted them.” They got used to them.\n\nThe spine of London theater—the reason it flourishes and is the envy of America—is government subsidy. It has survived cutbacks and assault, and nuclear attack through the 1980s from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the slash-and-burn Newt Gingrich of the arts. “When can we stop giving money to awful people like Peter Hall?” she pleaded, enraged that the man who was then running the National should lead the battle against Tory philistinism and mean minds, as he saw it.\n\nNo one has done more to keep alive the heritage of British theater than the workaholic director-producer Sir Peter Hall, and few powerful figures in England fascinate more. He could be Machiavelli, Iago, Coriolanus, Don Juan, or, of late, Falstaff.\n\nHe’s the master builder of British theater. At 30, he founded the Royal Shakespeare Company; then, succeeding Olivier, he led the National for more than a decade, into its new South Bank empire. And for good measure Hall ran the Glyndebourne Festival Opera. There’s practically nothing left for him to run. Yet this impresario is close to an academic scholar in the privacy of the rehearsal room, tapping out the beat of the Shakespearean verse on a lectern like a conductor.\n\n“What we’re all bleating about, as usual,” Hall told me, “is fighting against decline. In the 1960s, a young actor would have been marinated in Shakespeare. The easy solution now is the convention of the real—gritty underplaying, as on TV. It’s affected the whole ecology. But Shakespeare’s a verse dramatist. The reason Shakespeare got longer is because actors play the words, not the line. You preserve the sanctity of the line. I reckon there are only about 50 actors left in the country who can do it.”\n\nHall, a railwayman’s son, came out of Cambridge University. So did many of the newer generation—Richard Eyre, Nicholas Hytner, Sam Mendes, Emma Thompson, Declan Donnellan, Nick Ormerod, and Simon McBurney and Annabel Arden of London’s Theatre de Complicite. The Marlowe Society at Cambridge, under the direction of George “Dadie” Rylands, shaped the undergrad Peter Hall. The heritage was passed on when Hall handed over the Royal Shakespeare Company to Trevor Nunn (who was also at Cambridge), and continued through Hall’s years at the National, where the Marlowe torch is now carried by former society president Sir Ian McKellen.\n\nSurprisingly, perhaps, Hall at 64 looks more hopefully to America than to Britain. I had put it to him that for too long Americans have been going down on one knee before the god of Shakespeare, when they possess all the skills of dynamic language and physicality—speed, wit, naturalism, daring—to burst through the conventions and make new. “If they could be trained to observe the form and breathe at the right places,” said Hall, “they’d knock the shit out of us.”\n\nIt is extraordinary that Arthur Miller—the dramatist of Death of a Salesman and founding father of modern American drama with Eugene O’Neill and Tennessee Williams—is now produced and celebrated more in England than in his own land.\n\nWhereas his 1994 play, Broken Glass, closed early on Broadway, in London it was taken under the protective umbrella of the National Theatre, transferred to the West End, and went on to win the Olivier Award for best play. The spiraling cost of producing plays on Broadway is at least twice as high as in London, making the more commercial work the safer bet. But Arthur Miller goes further:\n\n“Broken Glass wasn’t Cats,” he points out in his deep, deceptively calm American voice. “On Broadway, it’s purely business. But a West End theater doesn’t regard a few empty seats as a disgrace. The American system is a commercial, cockeyed, historically determined process where success is everything. Even profit isn’t enough. It has to be a bigprofit.”\n\nLook briefly at the route to New York of Tom Stoppard’s latest success, Arcadia. It was first produced at the National Theatre. Then it transferred to the commercial West End. Four New York producers wanted it for commercial Broadway. Stoppard, the playwright of scintillating ideas, chose the nonprofit Lincoln Center Theater instead. “I wanted an axis in New York that would do my plays without picking and choosing the ones that might make money and might not,” he explained. “The experience of having a play produced in New York is still unequaled. If you could smoke there, it would be perfect.” He has made the nonprofit theater in New York his base, and his uncommercial Hapgood—which no Broadway producer wanted—could therefore be produced at Lincoln Center alongside Arcadia.\n\nThe golden boy of British theater, 38-year-old director Nicholas Hytner, now lives in London and New York, enjoying the best of both worlds. Hytner understands popular taste, but he functions outside the mainstream. After directing the blockbuster Miss Saigon, he returned to the National to direct the stage version of The Madness of King George. In New York, he has become an associate director of the Lincoln Center Theater, site of his beautiful production of Carousel, and after all the acclaim for his film version of King George, when Hollywood was at his feet, he chose the route of modestly budgeted films for adults.\n\nIt is his way of keeping control, of “doing good work” unfettered by too blatant commercial compromise. His new film is Arthur Miller’s The Crucible, with Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, and Paul Scofield. It continues Hytner’s system of alternating between films and the theater, in the well-founded belief that there exist sufficient millions of movie- and theatergoers who take pleasure in the artfully “uncommercial.”\n\nThe keepers of the nonprofit flame, Adrian Noble, boss of the R.S.C., and Richard Eyre of the National, have this deeply in common: they are both insomniacs. Eyre, described by Frank Rich of The New York Times as “the most successful producer in the English-speaking theater,” wears it well. The words “community,” “group,” “society,” pepper his conversation like a conscience—words, he said, “people who don’t like the theater recoil from, as if from rabid dogs.”\n\nNow 52, he has decided to leave the National in two years after more than a decade of success at the helm. “Let somebody else have the sleepless nights!” he said, and laughed. Eyre has worked in the nonprofit theater all his life, and it’s difficult to imagine him working anywhere else. He turned down the opportunity to direct Les Misérables, which is like misplacing your winning lottery ticket. “I don’t regret it,” he explained phlegmatically. “I believe the Faustian contract is a reality. The others can do musicals like Les Misérables in good faith. But it just won’t farm out for me if I do things in bad faith. I know that sounds like a sanctimonious prick, but that’s what I feel.”\n\nEyre’s counterpart at the Royal Shakespeare Company is the wired Adrian Noble. “Terrible, appalling, appalling!” he said when I asked him about his insomnia. What does he do all night? I wondered. “Worry,” he answered. His body behind his desk in Stratford bent into the shape of a question mark, as if weighed down by the wearying bur-den of the classical world.\n\n“It’s a living heritage,” he said. “For me the English national identity isn’t invested in the text of Shakespeare’s plays, but in the people who hear them. Hamlet said, ‘We’ll hear a play.’ For Shakespeare it was the ear. He made pictures through language. I believe the living heritage contains stories and myth that resonate in life, poetry that can enrich us, an experience that can renew us.” It’s as if Shakespeare were alive, looking over his shoulder, whispering, “Keep going. I’m better than the movies. Find the present in the past and you understand the world.”\n\nToday, whispered—and not so whispered—sacrileges are being heard against the heritage of Olivier and Gielgud, as if that tradition belonged more to a pinnacle of 19th-century acting. It’s an overthrowing, too, of the watered-down legacy of the stiffly rhetorical, the emotionally dead, the British style and voice—the traditional Shakespearean voice, which can rip through the back of the stalls and stop ships at sea.\n\nAnd some of those new voices come from within. “I never saw Olivier, Gielgud, and Richardson,” the successful young West End director Sam Mendes of the Donmar Warehouse Theatre told me. “In fact, my generation grew up with John Cleese.”\n\nAnother of the new generation of international directors is Jonathan Kent, co-director of the fringe, 300-seat Almeida Theatre in North London. He took Ralph Fiennes and Diana Rigg to Broadway. “I didn’t want Hamlet produced in a high-art ghetto,” he explained. “I don’t want to exhume museum pieces as a cultural duty or a kind of medicine. The only point of doing these plays is because they’re terrifically popular plays. So it was marvelous that Hamlet was on Broadway down the road from Beauty and the Beast.”\n\nSo, the barricades went up outside the Belasco Theater on West 44th Street. Hamlet had Ralph Fiennes, of course, which helped. But Kent had talked to him about taking on the unsolvable mystery two years before he became Ralph Fiennes. And the actor, now a movie star, had spent four seasons with the Royal Shakespeare Company. No recent performance on Broadway had been more excitedly anticipated than the Fiennes Hamlet—a modern Hamlet for “rotten” times. Our first sight of the star was of a tragic antihero alone, his back turned on us.\n\nFiennes was a Hamlet without the princeliness: unregal, unshaven, unkempt, a dark, contemporary grunge Hamlet on the precipice. In isolation, he might have been a rock star about to explode in klieg lights and smoke, hurling his black topcoat aside to turn and shout to his fans, “Love ya, Cleveland!”\n\nJohn Osborne’s memorial was a crowded gathering. There were England’s dramatists—among them Harold Pinter, Christopher Hampton, and John Mortimer. And there were its actors—among them that patrician, carved, enigmatic face of Paul Scofield, the only actor in England to have turned down a knighthood. And there was the ghost of Olivier, the only great actor in English history to have been made a lord. A recording of Laurence Olivier singing and dancing as Archie Rice in The Entertainer, Osborne’s music-hall metaphor of crumbling postcolonial England, was played during the service, bringing sighs and affectionate laughter. For the most celebrated actor of the century could scarcely sing a note.\n\nAnd perhaps it was all there in the secluded chapel that morning earlier this year—in the timeless, formal, expert English ceremony of it all, in those restrained, reedy English voices singing lusty hymns, in the prayers and English music and flawless readings from great actors—the inescapable impression that the best of English life is a play, a show, a pageant even before God. “It is impossible to speak of John Osborne without using the word ‘England,’ ” said David Hare in his fine and surprisingly emotional tribute. So it is impossible to imagine England without its theater."
