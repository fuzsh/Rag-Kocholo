He rose to prominence in films such as Sleepy Hollow and Gosford Park, and had success on television with shows like The Singing Detective and Maigret. Gambon's career also included notable performances in Harold Pinter's plays. He will be remembered for his talent and distinctive voice.\n\nJane Austen scores a double ton\n\nTNN / Jan 28, 2012, 05:17 (IST)\n\nThe 200th year of the publication of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice starts today. A book that's vibrantly alive on screen, on tube and bookshelves was published on Jan 28, 1813. That year also saw the publication of Byron's The Giaour and Shelley's Queen Mab. Arthur Schopenhauer published On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason.\n\nOut of court by Soli J Sorabjee: The Hague, Bihar & Laurence Olivier\n\nTNN / Nov 26, 2272, 07:15 (IST)\n\nThirteen is the largest number of judges before whom I have argued in the Supreme Court in the historical Keshavanand Bharti case. At the International Court of Justice at the Hague, the judicial capital of the world housed in a grand building, I recently had to address sixteen silent judges in solemn attire. The judges represent principal legal systems of the world. In combining both oral and written phases of procedure, the Court blends the key features of the common and civil law systems. For me it was a unique experience. There were no questionings by the judges, no interruptions by opposing counsel, no humorous anecdotes and loud laughter. In short, no nonsense.\n\nOut of court by Soli J Sorabjee: The Hague, Bihar & Laurence Olivier\n\nTNN / Nov 25, 2272, 21:11 (IST)\n\nThirteen is the largest number of judges before whom I have argued in the Supreme Court in the historical Keshavanand Bharti case.
