        "text": "Laurence Olivier, hailed as one of the greatest classical stage actors of his time, died yesterday at his home near London. He was 82 years old.\n\nLord Olivier died ''peacefully in his sleep,'' surrounded by friends and relatives, in Steyning, West Sussex, said his agent, Laurence Evans. He was hospitalized several times in the last year after a kidney operation. His last professional appearance was a cameo role in the 1988 movie ''War Requiem,'' based on the oratorio by Benjamin Britten. Virtuosity and Daring\n\nLord Olivier was a performer of astonishing virtuosity and daring. If that were not enough to fill a career, he was also a movie star of the first magnitude, a film director whose Shakespearean adaptations are unmatched on the screen, a stage director with a breadth of accomplishment in contemporary as well as classic plays and the founder and first artistic director of the National Theater of Britain.\n\nKnighted in 1947, raised to life peerage in 1970, he was, in art as well as title, a princely lord of his profession. Although his achievements and influences were many and varied, he was primarily an actor, and in a six-decade career onstage and in films, his performances - as Henry V, Hamlet, Richard III, Oedipus, Othello, Archie Rice in ''The Entertainer,'' Heathcliff in ''Wuthering Heights'' and Maxim De Winter in ''Rebecca'' - won him artistic immortality.\n\nHe played kings, villains and, occasionally, clowns, the most challenging roles in the classical repertory, and also some of the most popular romantic figures. And in the last decade of his life, he had still another, profitable career as a character actor in Hollywood movies.\n\nThough he retired from the stage in 1974 because of illness, he never stopped working as a serious actor. Paralleling his renewed Hollywood reknown, he acted on television - as Lord Marchmain in ''Brideshead Revisited,'' as the barrister in John Mortimer's ''Voyage Round My Father,'' as the artist Henry Breasley in John Fowles's ''Ebony Tower,'' and, for the second time in his career, as a thunderous ''King Lear.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
