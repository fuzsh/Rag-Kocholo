He was replaced by Clifford Williams who directed Pickup (Rosalind), Charles Kay (Celia), Richard\n\nKay (Phebe) and Anthony Hopkins (Audrey), alongside Derek Jacobi (Touchstone).\"\n\nProduction image from As You Like It, 1967, Zoë Dominic, 1967/1967, From the collection of: National Theatre\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nRonald Pickup as Rosalind in As You Like It, 1967\n\nRonald Pickup on As You Like It, From the collection of: National Theatre\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nRonald Pickup recalls As You Like It.\n\n'In the love scenes in the Forest of Arden, the theatrical form and the theme completely... penetrate each other on condition... that female parts are played, as ... on the Elizabethan stage, by boys.'

The Guardian critic Philip Hope-Wallace thought the love scenes between Rosalind and Orlando suffered from being played man-to-man ('If not embarrassing, they were somehow less effective'); for Milton Shulman in the Evening Standard, they lacked the necessary 'sense of romantic ecstasy'. Nevertheless, the production was a hit, giving 77, sold-out performances.\n\nPoster for Measure For Measure, 1981, Richard Bird, 1981/1981, From the collection of: National Theatre\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nPoster for Measure For Measure, 1981\n\n\"In the integration of African-Caribbean and Asian actors into the casts of classic revivals at the National Theatre, Michael Rudman's Measure For Measure, for the Lyttelton in April 1981, holds an important place.\n\nRudman cast 28 African-Caribbean and Asian actors in his 31-strong\n\ncompany, including Norman Beaton\n\n(Angelo), Troy Foster (Claudio), Oscar James (Pompey), Stefan Kalipha (Duke)\n\nand Yvette Harris (Isabella).\n\nRudman transposed Shakespeare’s Vienna to a\n\nmythical Caribbean island shortly after the Second World War.
