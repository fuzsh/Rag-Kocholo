        "text": "Sir Laurence Olivier believed the same.\n\nWhen I was a young actor in theatre school, I became obsessed with watching and studying actors and performances. Kenneth Branagh’s Henry V had come out, and I was smitten by this fresh interpretation of my favourite Shakespeare play at the time (I even wrote Sir Ken and have kept that correspondence going with Tamar Thomas, his assistant, for close to twenty-five years now). I remember watching the scene where Henry gets mocked by the Dauphin with a gift of treasure — tennis balls — and being struck by the use of eyes in the scene. If you watch the scene before the messenger is brought in, when Henry is being advised, you will see what I mean. Watch the eyes of the actors and the beautiful layering of subtext they give the audience. With the actor being on the thought and thinking from word to word, you get a beautiful clarity in acting.\n\nThree years later, when I first met my acting and directing mentor, Robin Phillips, Robin mentioned to me that when he worked with Sir Laurence Olivier, Olivier would talk about the eyes. Robin mentioned that Olivier talked about the eyes as much as he talked about the voice. This is an extraordinary statement if you take into consideration that the medium Olivier was talking about was the theatre. It makes sense on camera that the eyes should have such a crucial place in storytelling, but in the theatre? How can the back row see the eyes?\n\nIt has only taken me twenty-five years of working in professional theatre and working with young actors to realize how right Olivier and Robin were. Sure, it needs a great director to recognize where the actor needs to be positioned, the actor to be a master of showcasing the eyes to the house, and an awareness of how the eyes are lit.\n\nThis is still one of the great acting secrets that is still little known and not talked about enough by acting teachers around the world. It is how we command a room in real life and it is how you command an audience.\n\nThe eyes are the connection, the subtext, and the way an actor and director use focus to guide the audience’s eyes through the story. They are crucial to not only the believability of an actor’s performance but also the clarity of storytelling for the audience.\n\nMy student actors have one heck of a time even looking at each other in the eyes, nevermind understanding how they can control where an audience looks or how they can create empathy and sympathy from the audience.\n\nWe must never forget, as actors, casting directors, directors, lighting designers, etc., that the slightest movement of the eyes tells a huge story for the audience. In the same way that the slightest movement of the head or hand tells a huge story to an audience. An actor’s job is to be aware of their full instrument, and the eyes are a crucial component of that on camera and on stage.\n\nI wish more acting teachers and directors concentrated on helping actors be heard and their eyes be seen over exercises that concentrate on emoting, flailing, and shouting.\n\nThis is why I am a huge advocate for preserving the old lessons of acting and staging from those who have trod the boards before us. As technology has advanced in film, the theatre has stayed relatively the same when it comes to the relationship between actor and audience. We must never forget these lessons that have been learned over thousands of years of craft.\n\nFew modern actors today recognize the importance of the eyes.\n\nThe generation of actors before us all knew it. In fact, it was the core of actor training. Ira Aldridge had it. John Barrymore had it. Peggy Ashcroft had it. Edith Evans had it. Paul Robeson had it. Michael Redgrave had it. Ralph Richardson had it. Many in our last generation of great classical actors have it. Alas, many modern-day acting students don’t even think about it on their acting radar. To be fair, I do think there are a few young modern actors who do have it on their radar. But, that is an article for another day.\n\nI will leave a quote from English writer Samuel Richardson:\n\n“Where words are restrained, the eyes often talk a great deal”.\n\nA great acting note."
