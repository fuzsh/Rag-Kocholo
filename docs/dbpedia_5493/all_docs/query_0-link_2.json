        "text": "(1907–89). Acclaimed by critics and audiences alike as the greatest actor of his generation, British-born Laurence Olivier pursued a distinguished career on stage and screen in Britain and the United States for more than 60 years. Although he won only one Academy Award during his lifetime, he was nominated multiple times and was granted both a special and an honorary award from the Academy to honor his work.\n\nLaurence Kerr Olivier was born in Dorking, Surrey, England, on May 22, 1907. He appeared on stage as a child and started his training for the theater in 1924 at the Central School of Dramatic Art. He began his professional career in 1926 with the Birmingham Repertory Theatre Company. His first American success in 1930 was in Noël Coward’s Private Lives in New York City. In London he and John Gielgud alternated the roles of Mercutio and Romeo in Romeo and Juliet. In 1937 he joined London’s Old Vic theater company, where he met and acted with Vivien Leigh, who became his second wife in 1940.\n\nIn the late 1930s Olivier also made some successful Hollywood films, including Wuthering Heights and Rebecca (both 1939) and Pride and Prejudice (1940). He went back to England for military service in January 1941. After World War II he returned to the Old Vic and had notable successes in a number of Shakespearean roles. He also produced, directed, and starred in film versions of Henry V and Hamlet. He won an Academy Award in 1948 for his Hamlet.\n\nAfter 1950 Olivier’s career embraced nearly every facet of theater and film. He generally acted and directed under his own management. From 1962 to 1973 he was director of the National Theatre Company in London and appeared in many of its productions. For his achievements Olivier was knighted in 1947. In 1970 he was made a baron, becoming the first actor to be elevated to a life peerage.\n\nAmong his many films of the 1950s and ’60s were The Entertainer, The Beggar’s Opera, Richard III, and Othello. In later years chronic ill health forced Olivier to reduce his stage appearances, but he continued to act in films. His appearances included roles in Sleuth (1972), Marathon Man (1976), Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1976), A Little Romance (1979), Richard Wagner (1982), and King Lear (1983)."
