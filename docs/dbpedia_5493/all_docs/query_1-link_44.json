        "text": "There aren’t many fall films more delightful than Tea with the Dames, a new documentary from Roger Michell (Notting Hill) that features Dames Maggie Smith, Eileen Atkins, Judi Dench, and Joan Plowright reflecting on their storied careers, their friendship, and the memories that still make them laugh. Speaking from the English countryside home that Plowright built with her late husband, Laurence Olivier, the women don’t let anyone behind the cameras—or at home—forget who is in charge. When Michell prompts the ladies to talk about aging, Dench retorts, “Fuck off, Roger.” When a photographer annoys Smith, she tells him to put away his camera and be gone. And when the women grow tired of tea, they tell someone to bring them a round of champagne.\n\nTheir confidence does not seem simply born from maturity. The film gives the impression that the dames’ cool armor and thorny asides were necessary tools they used to battle so many outsized male egos on and offstage—to blaze venerable careers before women were taken all that seriously, especially in the worlds of entertainment and theater.\n\nThough the women don’t go more than a minute without cracking a joke, they also discuss their insecurities about their appearances and the rude male directors they have encountered. Of all the men they knew, Olivier’s is the name that pops up multiple times—not only because he was married to Plowright for nearly 30 years, but also because Maggie Smith co-starred with the stage great in a 1964 National Theatre Gallery production of Shakespeare’s Othello. (Olivier chose to wear blackface in the role, an appalling decision he defended in even more appalling detail in his biography.) Smith—who played Desdemona to Olivier’s Othello—readily recalls the horrors of seeing her co-star in head-to-toe black makeup every day.\n\n“Darling Frank Finlay,” Smith says in the film of their co-star, who played Iago, “he came offstage one night. He flew to the corner and he started tearing at his eyes. I thought, ‘What has happened?’”\n\nFinlay, who had vision problems, had decided to try contact lenses for the first time that evening.\n\n“He said, ‘I have just seen Sir Laurence, and I never want to see him again.’ He couldn’t get [the contact lenses] out fast enough . . . he couldn’t see his hand in front of him. Poor man.”\n\nSmith also reveals that she regularly butted heads with Olivier, who was quick to criticize her acting. After one show, Olivier told his young co-star that her pronunciation of vowels was not up to par. Before the next show, when it came time for Smith to help Olivier—in full, horrific blackface—glue on his eyelashes, she went into his dressing room and showed him how seriously she’d taken his note.\n\n“I went in to help him with his eyelashes, and he was sitting there in all of that grunge [makeup],” says Smith. “I said, ‘How now, brown cow?’”\n\nOlivier did not find the remark funny. “All he said was, ‘It’s better.’”\n\nOn another occasion, Olivier told Smith that her line delivery was so slow that she “bored him off the stage.” The next show, Smith says, “I went so fast he didn’t know if it was Wednesday or Christmas . . . I got him really rattled.”\n\n“I think I was more nervous of Laurence than of the critics,” the dame says of being cast in the production. “As indeed everybody was . . . we were terrified.”\n\n“You scared him,” responds Plowright.\n\nSmith concedes that point. “I think I scared the wits out of him from time to time,” she says.\n\nDuring a different show—in a scene in which Othello scuffles with Desdemona—Olivier actually struck Smith across the face. “He did knock me out,” Smith says. “I was left with some black marks [from his makeup] on my face.” But once the curtain closed that evening, Smith got the last laugh: “I did say it was the only time I saw stars at the National Theatre.”\n\nAsked about working alongside their husbands, Plowright admits, “Mine was the most difficult.”\n\n“We all found him tricky,” says Smith. “It wasn’t just you, Joan.”\n\nPlowright resents the idea that her professional success was related to her husband’s exalted status, and characterizes their relationship as a complicated one. “It was momentous, earth-shattering for me . . . a very, very strange experience,” she says of her marriage to Olivier in the film. “It was a great privilege to share in his life, as well as a bit of a nightmare.”\n\nThough Smith’s collaboration with Olivier had its ups and downs, she does also offer up one tender memory of Olivier in the movie—from a visit that she and her young son made to the Plowright-Olivier’s home.\n\nPlowright gives Smith more credit, revealing that her fellow actress would stop by the Olivier family home when Plowright was out of town to help Olivier around the house and with the children. “You came around and held his hand,” she reminds Smith.\n\nDiffusing any seriousness, Smith then raises a palm and jokes about the great honor of assisting Olivier. “This hand held the hand,” she says, as Plowright bursts into laughter beside her.\n\nTea with the Dames opens Friday, September 28, in Los Angeles before a wider rollout."
