        "text": "When the notorious hell-raiser, turned venerable elder statesman of British arts, Richard Harris, died in 2002, he left a sizeable hole. Not just in his industry but in the production schedule of the third Harry Potter movie. Harris had been Dumbledore, the wise headmaster guiding young Potter through his entry to the wizarding world. Who could fill the beard, the half-moon spectacles, the sweeping robes?\n\nThe choice of Michael Gambon, who died yesterday at the age of 82, was, in some ways, unexpected. Rumours had swirled about Ian McKellen, who had become synonymous with hirsute magicians off the back of Lord of the Rings, and Peter O’Toole, who, along with Oliver Reed and Richard Burton, had been Harris’s drinking companion through the 1960s.\n\nBut the casting team chose Gambon, younger than both his rivals and far less familiar to international audiences. More robust than the waifish Harris, he shared his predecessor’s look of melancholy. With Gambon, as with Harris and, indeed, Dumbledore, it’s all in the eyes.\n\nThat casting decision that would come to define Gambon’s career – whether he liked it or not. “I’m a theatre actor,” he said, in a 2007 interview. “But in the last 10 years people have given me parts in movies. I’ve taken them to get the money – and then I immediately forget what film it is.”\n\nFrom a childhood spent in Ireland, Gambon moved to post-war London where he trained as an engineer. It was not until his twenties that Gambon would fully commit himself to the craft of acting, starting off at the Gate Theatre in his native Dublin, followed by a longer stint at the National in London.\n\nThe National Theatre company of the 1960s was a smorgasbord of present and future behemoths. In 1963, Gambon appeared in a production of George Farquhar’s The Recruiting Officer, in the minor role of “Melinda’s servant”. It was an apprenticeship served alongside a constellation of stars: Laurence Olivier, Derek Jacobi, Maggie Smith, Lynn Redgrave, and Robert Stephens all trod the boards of the Old Vic alongside a 23-year-old Gambon. No time was wasted under the tutelage of Olivier, and bit-parts led rapidly to starring roles in the West End and Broadway.\n\nBy the end of the 60s he was securing big roles in big plays: Coriolanus in Coriolanus, Buckingham in Richard III, King Lear in King Lear, Uncle Vanya in Uncle Vanya. His stage acting took him to some of the most prestigious venues in the world: The Globe, the Barbican, the Royal Court and New York’s Royale Theatre. It was a career that stretched from 1962 (Second Gentleman in Othello at The Gate) to 2018 (a voice performance in Harold Pinter’s Pinter One at the Harold Pinter Theatre).\n\nAnd yet most of the obituaries for Gambon will focus on a career that only began at the ripe old age of 64. His film roles, until then, had been intermittent but celebrated. His appearance in Peter Greenaway’s acclaimed arthouse crime drama – The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover – holds up to this day, but he was better recognised for his performance in the television drama The Singing Detective.\n\nLike so many British and Irish actors, he found himself frequently cast in period drama adaptations of classic novels, like Henry James’s The Wings of the Drove, Evelyn Waugh’s Brideshead Revisited, and a TV version of Jane Austen’s Emma. His varied, mercurial career also saw him working with a diverse range of directors, from American auteurs like Tim Burton and Wes Anderson, to international heavyweights like Robert Altman and Michael Mann.\n\nAnd then came Potter, a project that took him to stardom around the world. “I’ve died in quite a few plays and films, I’m always dying,” he told the LA Times in 2009, after his character met his maker in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, “and this one is good.”\n\nDespite being so widely admired as a generational stage talent, the final act of his career played out on the biggest stage of all. But Gambon was no mere silver-haired legend of the silver-screen: he was one of the last holdouts of the greatest era of British theatre since the days of Shakespeare."
