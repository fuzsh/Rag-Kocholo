        "text": "Interview with Casting Director Alaine Aldaffer\n\nAlaine Alldaffer has been casting for theatre, tv and film for the past 25 years. She has been the Casting Director at Playwrights Horizons in NYC for over 20 years.\n\nKiara Pipino (KP):\n\nAlaine Alldaffer, as the casting director at Playwrights Horizon… what do you do? What is the casting director doing in a theater production?\n\nAlaine Alldaffer:\n\nPeople think that the casting director hires the actors, but that is a misunderstanding. We don’t do the hiring, we provide ideas and possibilities, and it’s the director, the writer, and the producer’s job to decide who gets the role. The casting director in a theatre production provides the director, writer, and producer with ideas. These are usually based on meetings that happen ahead of time. We produce lists with different types of thoughts [on actors], and that’s how I boil it down and figure out what we’re really looking for. I sometimes ask the director and the playwright for a “wish list,” which is usually really informative and helps me to understand what it is that we are looking for. And then, once I have a list of actors I think would work, I set up audition sessions and I bring people in to read for the director, producer, and writer. That could also be a very informative part of the process because it usually helps me to come up with newer or better ideas based on how the director, the playwright, and the producer respond and react to the individuals I brought in.\n\nSometimes, we just offer the role to somebody—likely an actor who has a history with the project through readings and workshops. As well as someone with a strong resume already vetted by the community and thus in demand.. Some actors are “offer only,” which would mean they don’t come in and audition: they’ve graduated from the audition process. it’s not necessarily an “ego thing”: these are people who might have 10 offers on their desk and so they’re reading 10 plays, already working on several project and just don’t have time to audition for everything that they’re offered.\n\nKP:\n\nSo when it comes to a production in a season, you do that for all the shows in your season. Correct?\n\nAlaine Alldaffer:\n\nThat is correct. That is correct.\n\nKP:\n\nIs it part of your job to also scout actors or to go to general auditions? And if so, how do you handle that?\n\nAlaine Alldaffer:\n\nEquity [Actors Equity Association] has several requirements, and one of them is called an EPA (Equity principal audition), which is an open call for Equity actors. You are required to set one up for every play that’s produced. So, that’s usually the very first thing that happens and I make it a priority to keep stand-out actors on the list for future auditions with the creative team. I’ve actually hired the open actors from open calls. The second thing that happens is usually having meetings with the creative team.\n\nKP:\n\nWho attends the open calls, other than the actors, of course?\n\nAlaine Alldaffer:\n\nThat depends. Whoever has casting approval can attend, which is misleading because, for example, I don’t really have casting approval, meaning I don’t get a vote. I have approval as to who comes to audition or who makes it on the list to audition for the creative team, and that’s like a whole other thing. In an Open Call, I’m looking for people I think are interesting. I’ll choose the person that I think fills the requirements of the role and checks all the boxes, but then I’ll sometimes bring in somebody who’s wildly different just to give the team a different option and see if that just inspires anything.\n\nKP:\n\nWhat is your relationship with the director?\n\nAlaine Alldaffer:\n\nIt is usually a collaborative experience. My function is to really listen to the director. I can learn a lot just from the actors that the director mentions as possibilities for the role. My job is also to make sure that I’m bringing in people that the director wants to work with because you have to remember that in a production, you’re going to spend eight weeks with somebody.\n\nKP:\n\nYes, they need to get along.\n\nAlaine Alldaffer:\n\nThere’s socializing too, that happens in a production. Somebody that you might want to share ideas with after rehearsals can also be a factor.\n\nKP:\n\nSo, the right person for the role is not necessarily the best actor for that role. Right?\n\nAlaine Alldaffer:\n\nCorrect. There’s a lot of other factors that are involved. And I always say this, the best actor rarely gets the part. Our theatre [Playwrights Horizons] is unique, in this matter, as casting has to be a three-way unanimous vote between the producer, the director, and the writer. Sometimes I can be influential, because I’ve been doing this a long time and most of the times my opinion is respected, but I try not to squander that. Sometimes the director has a preference about a person, and maybe the producer and the writer disagree or don’t want to cast that person. In that case, what I do is to provide additional information and material about that actor to the producer and the playwright to see if that will make them change their minds. And sometimes it happens with a writer, who wants a particular person while the director and the producer are not sure about that choice. So that’s another function of a casting director: to make sure we’ve got as much information as possible about the actors so that everyone involved in casting can come to a decision in the most comfortable way.\n\nKP:\n\nAre casting directors involved in all theatre productions?\n\nAlaine Alldaffer:\n\nGenerally speaking, yes. In some cases, the producer calls up “big-name” actors and asks them directly if they want to be involved. And in that case, a casting director might not need to come in for all roles. Or a casting director might be hired to figure out understudies only. In this case, the casting director would be hired later in the production process. This is most common in commercial productions where a cast is created around a particular person, usually a star. Also, in productions where the director is prominent and has many connections, the director might be the one hitting up one of his personal contacts. This is true for Broadway, Off-Broadway, and Regional Theatre\n\nproductions. There’s one time where I was working with an Off-Broadway company and they were doing a one-person show. They decided they were going to look for the actor themselves. And they did. They made offers to probably 20 actors and everybody declined. So, then they had to bring me in because you see, I’m talking to agents all the time. I know who’s out there who wants to do a play. I know who those people are.\n\nKP:\n\nSo when it comes to process, you mentioned getting ideas from the director, getting ideas from the play itself, the script. What do you do, then, to actually get the actors?\n\nAlaine Alldaffer:\n\nThe first thing I do is put a breakdown out and, of course, the Open Call. When that process has been completed, I put a breakdown out on a service called Breakdown Express, which sends it out to everyone in the industry, including to managers and agents. That’s when they respond by submitting ideas and I start talking to them. More ideas might come out of that as well, you might see people that you hadn’t thought would be right and turn out perfect instead. I’m grateful for my relationships with agents and managers. There are many I trust to keep me informed. Not only letting me know which seasoned actors want to do a play but introducing me to new talent as well.\n\nKP:\n\nDid the COVID19 Pandemic alter that process?\n\nAlaine Alldaffer:\n\nDuring the pandemic, you couldn’t bring in actors to audition in person and everything had to be turned in on tape. I have a feeling that when the pandemic is over, the formula might have changed\n\nfor good. There might be people who audition in person and people who self-tape, or self-tapes will be a pre-screening process. I get a lot of people on tape nowadays, and then the writer and the director go through it, and they choose their top five or ten. And that is who you bring in for in-person auditions.\n\nKP:\n\nWhen you finished with the casting process, do you move forward to the next project?\n\nAlaine Alldaffer:\n\nYou know, sometimes I’m casting two or three plays at one time. All depends on the schedules of the writer and the director. You need them in the same room, of course, and that can be tricky with\n\ntheir busy schedules. Most of the writers and directors we work with at Playwrights Horizons always have multiple projects going on at the same time, and they’re not necessarily all in the city. I have to make myself available when they can both be there.\n\nKP:\n\nWhen casting is completed for a production, do you keep following it? Do you go to rehearsals?\n\nAlaine Alldaffer:\n\nOnce the play is cast, most casting directors don’t hear anything from the production until opening night or if somebody drops out. If that happens, the casting director has to jump in and try to replace that actor. At Playwright Horizons it’s different because I’m an Artistic Associate there, so I’m involved in rehearsals and in note-giving during previews. But that’s not the norm.\n\nKP:\n\nYou also work also in TV and film. Is the process the same? How does the approach of a casting director change according to the platform?\n\nAlaine Alldaffer:\n\nTelevision and film just require a much faster approach to the process. When I work on a television show, sometimes I would get a script in the morning for an episode that is shooting the next day. I have to get on it quickly. I’ll pull ideas together and have actors on tape by late afternoon for whoever’s doing the actual hiring, that is usually the producers, The director does have some input as well. The writers have no say unless the producer is the writer. Choices will be narrowed down to two or three actors and then the list goes to the network, who has final approval. Most of the time the network will sign off on that person unless there’s a problem. So, you see, all happens rapidly.\n\nKP:\n\nSo, if what I’m gathering is correct while in the theatre the director usually has the last word on casting, and in TV the last word comes from the Network?\n\nAlaine Alldaffer:\n\nYes. For commercial theater [Broadway], I think it probably is more a combination of the producer and the director. And of course, the writer has some input as well.\n\nKP:\n\nWhat happens when a show moves from off-Broadway to Broadway for a casting director?\n\nAlaine Alldaffer:\n\nIt really depends. Most of the time producers would want the original cast, although they’re not required to do so. Cast members might have the right of first refusal, that allows them to move with the production or be “bought out.” An actor is not obligated to move. They can pass on the production, but that’s pretty rare actually. For casting directors, it also depends. Producers are not required to bring you along to Broadway, I’ve been lucky so far that I’ve been hired to continue to work on it.\n\nKP:\n\nLooks like your job is more into connecting people and imagining people and actors and their abilities to cover a role. Have you ever thought of switching to directing?\n\nAlaine Alldaffer:\n\nI’ve thought about it, but then I see what directors do, I’m in awe and there’s no way I could ever do what they do. I think I could handle the staging and dealing with the acting and the performing, but for me what would be daunting is dealing with the production as a whole: the lighting, the music, the sound, and all what goes along with it. Also, there are so many wonderful directors out there, I think I’ll stay in my lane.\n\nKP:\n\nOne last question. What is the difference between a casting director and an agent?\n\nAlaine Alldaffer:\n\nThe agents are the ones who represent the actor and pitch the actor to the casting director for specific projects. They’re like a salesperson really, and their “products” are the actors in their roster. As a casting director, I’m the one who receives their submissions and decides who makes it into the list of the best possible choices. We might be talking about narrowing it down from 2000 actors to 20.\n\nKP:\n\nWow: that is a lot of actors being left out!"
