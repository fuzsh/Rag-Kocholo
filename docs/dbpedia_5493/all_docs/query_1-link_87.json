        "text": "It is not terribly odd to see directors adapt Shakespearian plays to a different era. In fact, contemporary elements in films like Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo and Juliet and the most recent Much Ado About Nothing by Joss Whedon have definitely bring valuable new readings to the text. Embracing this trend, Richard III (1995) by Richard Loncraine shifts its background to 1930s Britain. Starring Ian McKellen as Richard, the movie makes an undeniable connection to Nazi Germany; very details include costume design, set and prop, and cinematography choices all closely relate Richard to Hitler, an equivalent villain from modern history. The choice of blending Hitler into Richard puts viewers now into the shoes of audience from Shakespeare’s time to\n\nThe titular character in Shakespeare’s Richard III is a man whose body has been weakened and warped by nature, and so must rely on his wit and cleverness to survive. Throughout the play, Richard uses wordplay and persuasive language to convince others to support him or at least cease working against him. Overall, Richard believes that his ability to use language makes him superior to others in the courts of London, as is evident in the following selection: “Was ever woman in this humour wooed?/Was ever woman in this humour won?” (Shakespeare 1.2.230-231). Richard perceives himself as being capable of feats previously thought impossible due to his supposedly excellent understanding of rhetoric and discourse. Richard of Gloucester is\n\nWilliam Shakespeare’s characterization of Britain’s historical monarch Richard III, formerly Duke of Gloucester, is one of the most controversial in literature. To this day there are arguments upholding Richard III’s villainy and ascertaining his murder of the Princes in the tower, just as there are those who believe that he has been falsely represented by Shakespeare’s play and fight avidly to clear his name of any and all crimes. Because of the uncertainty surrounding his true character, Richard III is an intriguing personality to put into modern culture, which is exactly what Ian McKellen does in his rendition of the infamous ruler. However, McKellen’s portrayal of Richard III preserves the basic\n\nOne major way the film changed the play is that Maria ( Portrays Juliet) Does not die in the end. Tony (Portrays Romeo) does die but unlike Juliet Maria is not so stricken that she decides to die also, Maria gets the opportunity to move on with her life after a love lost.\n\ncrowned King Richard III. Deformed in body and twisted in mind, Richard is both the central character and the villain of the play. He is evil, corrupt, sadistic, and manipulative, and he will stop at nothing to become king. His intelligence, political brilliance, and dazzling use of language keep the audience fascinated—and his subjects and rivals under his thumb.\n\nIn Richard III, the titular protagonist Richard begins the play with the first dialogue which is an entire soliloquy that introduces exposition about a civil war having finally been won by his house as well as himself to the audience. Based on this opening dialogue spoken by Richard himself, it gives the readers and I the idea that he is meant to be the main focus of the play and we are supposed to keep an eye on him and his actions.\n\nAfter reading “Cinema and the Kingdom of Death” by Peter Donaldson’s I narrowed my attention to one section “Richard is at Hand”. Donaldson talks about McKellen’s adaptation by starting off with a very important scene in the beginning of the film that shows how McKellen included media into Shakespeare’s play. Donaldson talks about mass media in the play by including “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” by Walter Benjamin.\n\nA notable event is an event that should be taken note of because of how important it is. A notable event, I think would be the scene Richard III discovering Hasting’s death. Richard acts sad and depressed when he is informed of Hasting’s death. Then immediately after people leave him to himself he begins to laugh and smile with joy as he admires the hanging of his ‘beloved’ Hastings. He planned the death of Hastings. This is a prime example of just how evil and sick this man, Richard III, is. He plans the death of an entire chain of people to gain the crown.\n\nKenneth Branagh successfully adapts Shakespeare’s Hamlet into a modern film. His version of the tragedy allows enthusiasts to experience Shakespeare as a movie. Branagh’s use of an unabridged script and flashback scenes provide the complete story of Hamlet. The variety of camera shots highlight Hamlet’s intense dialogue and soliloquies. Patrick Doyle’s original score emphasizes action, suspense, and drama. Therefore, through his screenplay, cinematography, and score, Branagh caters to Shakespeare enthusiasts interested in seeing Hamlet on the big screen.\n\nThis direct address effectively reminds the audience of its relationship with the players on the stage: they are not anonymous observers of an unfolding history but rather TK. As the Chorus continues its preemptive apology, it degrades the performance to come by calling the actors “flat unraised spirits” and the stage an “unworthy scaffold.” These degradations, furthermore, are part of a periodic sentence that ends by calling the subject of the play “so great an object.” By delaying the object of the sentence in this way, the Chorus heightens the grandeur of it, further emphasizing the difference/inferiority TK. The apology serves to remind the audience of nature: performance is an attempt to replay history but one that inevitably falls very short … Having acknowledged the performance’s shortcomings, the Chorus then emphasizes the fact that the play is a performance that requires the audience’s mental cooperation in order to succeed. The Chorus calls upon the audience\n\nRichard III is a play originally written by William Shakespeare in approximately 1592.The play tells a story of the determination of the main character Richard of Gloucester and his journey to obtaining the throne occupied by his brother Edward IV. The events in the play occurred after the Wars of Roses between the House of York and Lancaster. Richard eventually gained the throne but not before manipulating, deceiving other characters and using murderous tactics. In 1995 the play was adapted by Richard Loncraine and turned into a film..Richard Loncraine is an English- born film director who has been directing films since 1974.Loncraine is known for being a versatile director with various genres of movies to his credit. Before becoming a film\n\nRichard III is literarily known as a historic play. This play portrays historical events, such as when the play opens, Edward IV has become re-crowned. This play represents 14 years of events which is condensed into about 14 days. There are ultimately elements of tragedy and comedy throughout this play and many of which these elements seem unusual to this documented event in history.\n\nShakespeare’s plays often share some of the same themes: greed, guilt, good and evil, unrequited or forbidden love. Perhaps the most overlooked theme is the plight of women in the time of Shakespeare. In a notoriously patriarchal part of history, the role of women was taboo subject matter; however, Shakespeare had no qualms about commenting on the female condition in his works. In his play Richard III, Shakespeare very clearly details the ways in which women suffer and their options for handling it. The women in the play are some of the few characters left after power-hungry Richard slaughters everyone in his path to the crown, and Shakespeare ingeniously incorporates the powerlessness of women into this complicated power struggle. In his play Richard III, Shakespeare uses his female characters to convey Richard’s talent for manipulation, foreshadow the hardships of other characters, and, after they cultivate their desire for vengeance, uses them to ultimately strip Richard of the same abilities he possessed earlier in the play.\n\nRichard II is a play written by William Shakespeare in the closing stages of the 16th Century. It is based on Richard II and his scheme of taking the throne of England. Richard II is a carefully balanced play, characterized by precise and formal arrangements of characters and actions. This balance is enhanced by various parallel incidents which are included in the themes, plots, and the nature of the characters in the play. It would therefore be important to focus on these incidents to get a clear understanding of their functions."
