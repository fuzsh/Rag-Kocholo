New Delhi:

Bollywood actor Arjun Rampal, who is gearing up for his upcoming film Crakk alongside Vidyut Jamwal and Nora Fatehi, was seen heaping praises on his Om Shanti Om co-star Shah Rukh Khan for delivering as many as three superhit films in 2023. During the promotions of Crakk, when the actor was asked about his views on commercial success, he told Zoom Entertainment, "When he (SRK) does a Pathaan and smashes all records, and then, he comes and does it again with Jawan, that is outstanding and fantastic. It's great for the industry. So, you have to encourage that. Acknowledge it, and be proud of it, be happy for that person. Whatever happens in your life or however you go about it, good things will happen to you too, and those people will be happy for you too.‚Äù
