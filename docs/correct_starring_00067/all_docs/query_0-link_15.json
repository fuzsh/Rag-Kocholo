        "text": "Farah Khan's film Om Shanti Om was released on November 9, 2007. Even after more than 15 years, the film continues to hold a special place in our hearts. Starring Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone, Om Shanti Om was a huge blockbuster of its time. In fact, it even marked Deepika's big Bollywood debut. In the film, Arjun Rampal played the bad guy and won our hearts with his performance. In a recent interview with Harper’s Bazaar, Arjun talked about SRK’s character Om Kapoor in Om Shanti Om and described it as 'irritating.'\n\nARJUN RAMPAL FOUND SRK'S CHARACTER IN OM SHANTI OM IRRITATING\n\nIn Om Shanti Om, we see Shah Rukh Khan playing the role of a junior artist in the film industry. He falls madly in love with a top actress named Shanti Priya, played by Deepika Padukone. Shanti is secretly married to Arjun Rampal's character, a huge producer. Later, he kills both Shanti and Om. In the second part of the film, SRK is reborn in a rich home and goes on to become superstar Om Kapoor.\n\nWhen Arjun Kapoor was asked about the relationship between SRK’s character and nepotism, the actor said that the character’s rebirth as a “nepo\" was bothersome. “When he (Shah Rukh Khan’s character) is born the second time, he comes a nepo. It was an irritating character.”\n\nArjun Rampal also spoke about how star kids get more chances in the industry. He said that there is a huge advantage a person has if they have a family member in a profession and they want to get in the same profession. “That’s the destiny of that personâæ you don’t choose your family you are born into.”\n\nWell, what did you think of Om Shanti Om?"
