Let's get started:The seventh and final phase of the 2024 general elections will conclude this week. Despite numerous rallies and manifesto releases, the parties' economic plans remain unclear. Puja Mehra raises a critical question to the two main blocs: how will they kick-start India's economic progress? She argues that both parties' plans have glaring loopholes. The prime minister must justify the modest economic progress over the past decade of his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, while the INDIA coalition must specify the source of their planned economic development. Mehra also poses open-ended questions about corporate tax policies and the relationship between public and private investment. Be sure to read this piece for thought-provoking queries about the country's future, regardless of who comes to power.While election results are yet to be announced, the central government is already planning for the next term. The Centre aims to significantly scale up its interest-free loans to states to boost capital expenditure. Rhik Kundu reports that this initiative will be part of the full budget, set to be released in July. The government has currently earmarked 75,000 crore rupees for this scheme. To qualify, states must implement several reform-oriented structural changes in sectors such as housing and vehicle scrappage.Facebook has faced widespread criticism over its content moderation policies, leading it to contract IT giant Cognizant to filter out harmful content. Cognizant directed its staff to manually review reported content to determine its suitability for posting. However, these employees, who have since left the firm, are now suing Cognizant. They allege that the reviews were extreme in nature and high in volume. The 14 plaintiffs claim the work was misrepresented to them and that they now suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result. Varun Sood provides the details of the latest issue facing Cognizant.Eleven successive quarters of net profit, an EBITDA margin of around 25 percent, and a stock price increase of nearly 200 percent—any chief executive would be delighted with these numbers. But Amur Lakshminarayanan has just one question: what's next? Lakshminarayanan, the MD and CEO of Tata Communications, is now in his fifth year at the helm. The Trichy-born engineer has successfully diversified Tata Communications' revenue streams, including an exciting new venture into live streaming sports events. Right before the pandemic, Tata Communications also began modernizing its operations with artificial intelligence—a move that has paid off dividends. Arun Janardhan profiles Lakshminarayanan in this \"Business of Life\" piece for Mint Lounge.There are necessities, and then there are luxuries. Common Indian wisdom says it's always a good idea to buy a house. But what if you aim for a luxurious one? Generally, no financial advisor would recommend overextending yourself to buy a house beyond your means. However, Shah Rukh Khan differs in philosophy, suggesting that buying a more expensive house will motivate you to work harder to achieve it. Vivek Kaul, in his trademark writing style, explores this concept—examining whether it makes financial and common sense to follow this model. He provides answers through a narrative involving a young couple and their family's desires, making for an informative yet entertaining read.We'd love to hear your feedback on this podcast.

Anubhav Sinha's 2011 family action comedy is like a remake of Terminator 2, set in the world of video game development.

Ra.One manifests in the real world and pursues Shekhar's family. A protector program also emerges, setting off a path of destruction that causes continents!In the latest team-up between IndieRise and Kicking the Seat, Ian and Shashwat dig into the reasons Ra.One was not well received on release--but has gained a new appreciation in recent years; why the filmmakers' blatant appropriation of James Cameron's landmark sci-fi blockbuster actually works here; and how Sinha's seamless integration of CGI and practical effects created a moment that made Ian's jaw drop when learning its secrets!Subscribe, like, and comment to the Kicking the Seat YouTube channel, and check out kickseat.com for multiple movie podcasts each week!Show LinksWatch the Ra.One trailer.Join the awesome virtual community of filmmaking obsessives at IndieRise!Watch Shashwat's documentary, Breaking Barriers, on the IIT Madras BS Film Society YouTube channel!Watch Shashwat's short films on YouTube (and be sure to subscribe!).Follow IIT Madras BS Film Society on Instagram.And catch up with previous \"Spotlight India\" episodes.\n\nThis week on 'Has It Aged Well?' we finally discuss our first Guru Dutt film.

To explore these topics Skift Editor-in-Chief Sarah Kopit is joined by two members of Skift's editorial team well versed in these regions: India-based Asia Editor Peden Domo Bhutia, and Dubai-based Middle East Reporter Josh Corder. Bhutia and Corder wrote about the rising Indian middle class, a potential short-term rental boom in the Middle East, and the emergence of \"Made in Dubai\" as a global brand. The discussion highlights the significant influence of the growing Indian middle class on outbound travel, fueled by increased disposable income and a desire for travel experiences post-COVID. India's outbound tourism is seen as highly aspirational, with the government facilitating easier passport procurement to boost travel. The conversation shifts to the Middle East, where Dubai is positioned as a brand akin to New York or Paris, with its companies expected to expand internationally. The short-term rental market is identified as a key growth area in the Middle East, driven by ambitious tourism targets and a need for budget-friendly accommodation options. The panel discusses the role of celebrities like Shah Rukh Khan and Ranveer Singh in marketing destinations and the importance of value for money to Indian travelers, including the rise of \"travel now, pay later\" schemes. Dubai's strategy to become a cosmopolitan hub is underscored by its use of short-term rentals to attract long-term residents, alongside the introduction of the golden visa to encourage residency among tourists. The podcast also touches on the broader trend of luxury travel in the Middle East, the need for budget accommodations to meet the demands of the middle class, and the strategic use of luxury hotels as marketing tools to attract tourists, with short-term rentals providing practical accommodation solutions.
