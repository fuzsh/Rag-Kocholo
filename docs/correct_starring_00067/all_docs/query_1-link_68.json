        "text": "'Dhaakad' (2022)\n\nDhaakad, starring Kangana Ranaut in the lead role, also featured Rampal. He essayed the antagonist Rudraveer's character in it. The film turned out to be disastrous at the box office, with several negative reviews. However, among the few positive reviews it received, some critics praised Rampal's performance as the villain. Directed by Razneesh Ghai, Dhaakad also starred Divya Dutta in a pivotal role.\n\n'Daddy' (2017)\n\nAshim Ahluwalia's 2017 film Daddy is a biopic based on Arun Gawli, a gangster-turned-politician. Rampal played the titular role, showcasing that he can effortlessly play a gangster, and then also switch to a cunning politician's role with ease. Even though the movie emerged as a flop at the box office, Rampal was successful in leaving an impression with his act.\n\n'Ra.One' (2011)\n\nIn 2011, Rampal went on to impress the audience with his performance in Ra.One, starring Shah Rukh Khan in the lead role and Kareena Kapoor Khan as the female protagonist. Though the title received mixed reviews from critics and audiences, Rampal, in the titular role, won acclaim for playing the antagonist and displaying his acting chops with perfection.\n\n'Om Shanti Om' (2007)"
