        "text": "The mother, dressed in the finest of silks (with enough glitter embroidered on it), decorated in the finest jewelry, finishes giving her \"aarthi\" to an equally decorated deity, against the background of thumping background score (even if it is devotional tune) and waits for her son to take the first blessing, a tradition that he hasn't missed ever in his lifetime. So as there surrounds pindrop silence in the huge prayer hall of the modestly sized mansion, that is conveniently filled with guests, who seem to have no other jobs but to wait for the son to take the first blessing, a helicopter descends from the skies outside the mansion and the son jumps out of it before the chopper has even touched the ground. And the bombastic score kicks in again. Meanwhile, the editor has a merry time intercutting between the beaming mother's face and the athletic son's, who doesn't waste time catching his breath, inspite of the 10K run from the helipad to the prayer hall. The orchestra swells, along with the eyes of the mother, as the son walks into the house with a sense of accomplishment that could only come with conquering Mt. Everest. The jobless loitering guests couldn't be any happier. To the collective applause of the gathered audience (for reasons unknown), the son bends down and takes the first blessing from his mother. The audience becomes overwhelmed (thanks in large parts to the thumping score pumped throughout all the corners of seating auditorium) with joy, happiness and ecstacy, as kerchiefs come out to wipe away the tears streaking down the cheeks at just the same time that goosebumps make their special appearances - another typical moment in the dreamy world of Indian movies. The surprising aspect is, the above description is not from the loud 70's era, which the Hindi filmmakers seem to have taken a great shine on nowadays in the name of homage, but from a contemporary movie from just a few years ago.\n\nWhich goes on to say that immaterial of the era, escapism is here to stay. The audience wants the hero to triumph in the end (however stacked the situation is against him), the audience cheers when the guy gets the girl in the end (no matter how mean he has been to her throughout most of the movie), the villain should meet his fitting fate, the end credits should roll against up-tempo beat, Satyameva Jayate, Jai Hind! The audience needs the formula, the audience craves for the formula, only the tools change, only the methodology changes, the formula remains the same. VIVA! FORMULA!\n\nA couple of decades ago, serialized in a local Telugu weekly \"Andhra Bhoomi\", the famous cartoonist Mallik, created a seminal piece in Telugu literature - a never attempted before, completely cliche-ridden, over the top, farcical parody of the then prevalent conditions in Telugu cinema (though not much has changed from then). The title of the serial was \"Superhit\", which came with a tagline \"ani oka dikkumaalina kadha\" (A wretched story). Filled in the story every single caricature known to mankind - on the hero's side - an ultra-rich family, with a reckless, wasteful hero, a doting sister-in-law, a cute neice who mouths dialogues way beyond her age, a brother who is always caught up in his business, and looks harangued for most of the time; on the heroine's side - a handicapped brother, who dreams of standing on his legs, literally, one day, a blind sister, a shawl-draped, bed-ridden mother, who coughs lightly before uttering anything, a portrait of the dead dad hanging on the wall (garlanded, of course), which the shawl-draped mother makes it a point to talk to, whenever she has a cause of complaint against anybody. Oh, and there is also a second heroine, in the near by slum, who is the best thing to have happened to her people and whom the whole slum knows by her name (and vice versa).\n\nCreate a scheming villain, who always had an eye on hero's property and heroine's chastity, in that order, along with a standard format of heroine hating the hero first, before finally falling to his charms, a compelling reason why the heroine should not marry the hero according to her mother (in a flashback episode, hero's father was the reason why the heroine's family was destitute), some twists and turns and some the fill in the blanks that the readers could fill out even before anyone said 'Go' - Presto! A superhit story served hot and ready! Mallik ended up creating a story that mirrored the readers' (audience's) taste to perfection. Whoever said \"Can't beat 'em? Join 'em\" couldn't have said it better.\n\nThere are two ways of poking fun at something - laughing at it and laughing with it. While the former makes up mockery, the latter accounts for parody, why ch is a more benign and endearing form. Parody is never mean in nature, it wallows in the same system it is poking fun at. Parody has come late to the Indian scene, while it has become a mainstay in the Hollywood fare (The \"Airplane\" movies, the \"Naked Gun\" series and most of Mel Brooks' comedies). Though Kundan Shah's \"Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron\" was an attempt at ridiculing the unholy nexus of the print media with the political machinery, it cannot be completely termed as a parody (inspite of the many hilarious moments, including the final climactic staging of Mahabharat's \"Vastra aparaharan\" scene, with the blind Dhritarastra chiming in with a timely \"yeh kyaa hO rahaa hai\"), as the underlying theme is a deadly serious one (pun intended). There are two ubiquitous spheres in the present day society that constanly crave for attention - 1.Politics 2. Movies. While satire handles the role of mocking the political system, parody is the only way of laughing at the dream world and the dream merchants peddling impossible fare to wide-eyed mass audience. Where reality is scarce and escapism rules, where reason ends and fantasy rules, where people openly pledge their allegiance to formulaic fare and decry anything that is little bit preachy and informative, the situation could not get any better to make fun of. And what better way to make fun of a formula film, by making a formula film about a formula film?\n\nFarah Khan has her head planted firmly on her shoulders while shepherding the herd throughout the length of the movie. The plot of \"Om Shanti Om\" is only an excuse. In fact, the movie would have still worked, even if it were a series of disjointed segments with no continuous narrative (similar to the brilliant Monty Python movies). The story merely sets up the platform to laugh at situations that are funnily bad and hilariously absurd. To term \"Om Shanti Om\" as a spoof of just the 70s is a great disservice to the movies of the current era, which work no less hard, dishing out the same recipes of the Valmiki and Veda Vyas era. The movie is not merely a parody on movies. It even makes fun of the audience, who thoroughly enjoy such guilty pleasure fare. Here is a situation - the hero is handicapped, not merely to the extent that a hero can be handicapped photogenically, but handicapped in all senses and faculties, with no legs, no arms, no sight, no hearing and no sound. Yet he is still a hero, and deserves every chance to romance his heroine against Alps background. The audience and the makers are unfazed at the impossibility of the situation. Dream sequence - an all empowering possibility that can defy rules, commonsense, intelligence and logic. And so the dysfunctional hero grooves with the international beauties in an item song to commemorate (in fact, rue) the heroine's wedding with someone else. As though the absurdity isn't enough, Javed Akhtar joins the party coining the situation in what could only be termed as bizarrely apt - Dard-E-Disco. \"Om Shanti Om\" isn't a spoof. It in fact is a tribute - a tribute to everyone who cheered and clapped, when long lost brothers separated during childhood came together in the climax, singing the same song they practiced as kids. It in fact is a tip of the hat - a bow to everybody who yelled at the screen egging the hero to thrash the villain even more for all the injustices he committed during the stipulated movie time. It extends a heartfelt gratitude to all who laughed with the hero, cried with the heroine, growled at the villain, pitied with the second heroine. In effect, \"Om Shanti Om\" is truly of the people, by the people and for the people. Now that kind of idealism calls for another entirely out of place item song - \"Jashn-E-Filmi Zindagi\"!\n\nOSO : First Week Collections.New Records Set\n\nOm Shanti Om has simply seen an incredible first week at the box office. It has set new first week highs in every circuit of India and never have we seen so many theatre and city records broken by a single film.\n\nThe first week circuit nett billings are just huge as Mumbai crosses the 16 crore mark, Delhi/UP has touches 7.50 crore and East Punjab is around 3 crore. The all first week all India business is around the 41 crore mark.\n\nThe film has gone into second week with all its theatres in play. Shockingly the biggest of films loses digital screens in second week but Om Shanti Om goes into week 2 with 440 digital/UFO screens which is the same as first week.\n\nThe second week will also see the film smashing records.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOSO is the fastest money spinner ever\n\nThe diwali battle of the biggies has turned out to be a one horse race with Om Shanti Om emerging a clear winner. On Monday the collections of Saawariya had fallen to the 35-50% mark while Om Shanti Om was rock steady at 80-90% which is extraordinary for Monday in the multiplex era.\n\nOur source at Eros says \"Om Shanti Om is the fastest money spinner ever and in time will emerge the highest grossing film in Indian film history. It has taken the domestic boxoffice to another level. In India our film has done nett business of over 25 crore in 4 days and we expect it to touch the business of our 2007 blockbuster Partner within two weeks. Wherever we have sold the film it has fetched record prices and these prices will be recovered in one week flat. We expected the film to do very well but the collections till date are way above expectations especially if we take into account the competition\".\n\nThe story is different for Saawariya, after three good days the collections fell apart from Monday. But due to healthy weekend there is still chance of recovery as long as the multiplexes do not drop the screens showing it heavily in its second week.\n\nhttp://boxofficeindia.com/ososaawariya2.htm\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n‘Om Shanti Om’ Bests ‘Saawariya’ In Box-Office Stakes?\n\nThe long wait to witness whether Shah Rukh Khan is able to retain his old charisma and magic with ‘Om Shanti Om’ in face of threats from newbie Ranbir Kapoor who makes his debut with Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s ‘Saawariya’ is finally over.\n\nTwo days after both the ambitious celluloid projects hit the theatres across India on Friday, the audience has once again voted for the King Khan. The cash boxes at the theatres all over the country are ringing faster for ‘Om Shanti Om’ compared to ‘Saawariya’!Going by plain statistics, theatres screening ‘Om Shanti Om’ registered 90 percent possession, while ‘Saawariya’ succeeded an average 60 percent of audience attendance. Even the themes of the two films are diverse and the audience seems to have accepted the more tested version. While Bhansali’s ‘Saawariya’ is a magical love story involving a young couple, Farah Khan’s ‘Om Shanti Om’ revolves around the colorful and vivacious Bollywood movies of the 70s. Incidentally, both the directors have used new faces in their respective films to give the audience some element of freshness and surprise. While Shah Rukh Khan has model-turned-actress Deepika Padukone as his leading lady in ‘Om Shanti Om’, Bhansali has cast Rishi Kapoor’s son Ranbir and Anil Kapoor’s daughter Sonam in the lead roles. Such lovely young talents notwithstanding, it is Shah Rukh Khan who mesmerizes the audience with his emotions, dramatics and actions. In comparison, ‘Saawariya’ appears stale, boring and lack luster.Film pundits too have applauded King Khan for his efforts in the movie – particularly doing a shirtless scene. Though Khan turned 42 a few days ago, he is very comfortable with the young Deepika. And hence there is much talk that ‘Om Shanti Om’ may turn out to be a bigger hit than Shah Rukh Khan’s previous production ‘Chak De India’. Shah Rukh is his own competitor today as there is none other in his slot to throw formidable challenge at him. No doubt, Farah has attributed the film’s success to her hero – Shah Rukh and none else.\n\nhttp://www.newslocale.org/entertainment/enews/om_shanti_om_bests_saawariya_in_box-office_stakes?_20071112691.html\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCruise no match for Shah Rukh Khan\n\nWashington, Nov 12: The pairing of Tom Cruise and Robert Redford was no competition for Indian superstar Shah Rukh Khan and director Sanjay Leela Bhansali at the Indian Box Office.\n\nruise and Redford's new film 'Lions for Lambs' pulled in a 10.3 million dollars over the weekend overseas but still couldn't beat the earnings of Khan's 'Om Shanti Om' or Bhansali's 'Saawariya'.'Om Shanti Om' topped the box office with an earning of roughly 17 million dollars in India, and also took in 1.5 million dollars at 114 the United States.'Sawaariya', which marked the debut of Ranbir Kapoor and Sonam Kapoor, raked in 14.4 million dollars in India, 600,000 dollars in the U.S., 340,000 dollars in the U.K. and 100,000 dollars in Australia, reports Variety. Cruise's pic also didn't win over audiences in other major markets, generating just 2.2 million dollars in Spain, followed by 1.4 million dollars in the U.K, 1 million dollars in Germany and 878,000 dollars in Australia. \"Lions,\" starring Cruise, Robert Redford and Meryl Streep, stumbled out of the gate internationally without winning in any of major markets. Fox opened the Middle East tale in 12 of the 16 top territories with Spain generating the top number with $2.2 million, followed by the U.K. with $1.4 million, Germany with $1 million and Australia with $878,000. \"Lions\" came in a close second in Spain, losing out to the fifth frame of local hit \"The Orphanage,\" which has topped $20 million. Also not doing well was Universal's \"The Kingdom\".Things looked up for Paramount's \"The Heartbreak Kid\" which continued to salvage its domestic perf by showing more traction abroad, taking in 8.6 million dollars.\n\nhttp://www.dailyindia.com/show/190670.php/Cruise-no-match-for-Shah-Rukh-Khan-and-Bhansali-at-Indian-Box-Office\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nShah Rukh Khan’s OM SHANTI OM was the most-watched film on Friday in the entire U.K., if one goes by the screen average of all 150 films [English and non-English] running in the nation. The film collected £ 114,318 on 52 screens on Friday, with the average working out to £ 2,198. Extra-ordinary.On the other hand, there’s a wide gap between O.S.O. and SAAWARIYA in U.K. SAAWARIYA collected £ 38,254 on 46 screens, with the screen average working out to £ 832.\n\nhttp://www.indiafm.com/news/2007/11/10/10402/index.html\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttp://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/hindi/review/9603.html\n\nOM SHANTI OM is truly a near 3 hour circus show in the offering. You get to see dozen odd item sequences one after another that tie the script together for a circus and turn out to be amusing and entertaining by themselves.\n\nSo here we go with the dozen odd item sequences/concepts and gimmicks which make OM SHANTI OM an entertainer that makes you visit a circus, be entertained for those three hours and come back home satisfied!\n\n1) The 70s spoof concept - Over the top and on your face, OM SHANTI OM of the 70s is what you call as the light hearted take on the cinema made in the era gone by. Whether it is Shahrukh's filmy maa (Kirron Kher) who has prepared 'kheer' for her 'laal', the retro background score, those reds, yellows and greens color pallets on every frame, shooting of 'dakoo' films - they all come together to create an enjoyable spoof, though at places it does become a little repetitive.\n\n2) Original 'Om Shanti Om' song and dance sequence from KARZ is a riot to see as the film's opening credits roll. For those who were not born in early 80s, it is fun to see the song on big screen with first Rishi Kapoor followed by Shahrukh himself.\n\n3) Shahrukh Khan's South film star sequence brings the house down as it gives a very good idea about the kind of over the top films made in Tamil and Telugu during the 70s\n\n4) References to Manoj Kumar's palm-on-the-face fixation and Govinda struggling to find work due to his surname being Ahuja are done in the right spirit and invokes laughter. Ditto for young Sooraj Barjatya who is shown to get references for MAINE PYAAR KIYA from the real SRK-Deepika love story.\n\n5) Deepika's item song 'Dhoom Tana' with Sunil Dutt, Jeetendra and Rajesh Khanna. Though the concept is good and enjoyable as well, how one wishes the special effects here were truly flawless. The grainy look as well as limited appearance of the three superstars belies the hype.\n\n6) Entire star son tantrums and demonstration of star power by Shahrukh Khan reborn is done with tongue in cheek humor. It takes courage for a superstar to have an entire second half dedicated as a spoof on himself but SRK does it in the right spirit. Watch out for those coming late on sets sequence, changing the script based on personal whims and incorporation of item songs to enhance film's commercial appeal!\n\n7) Spoof on BLACK is oh-so-wicked and oh-so-timely. A film is being made which requires Shahrukh enact the role of not just a blind, mute and a dumb guy but also someone sans arms and legs. No wonder, he rightly mentions - \"Is film se sirf award hi milenge\"!\n\n8) Filmfare awards sequence is the triple ace for OM SHANTI OM. This is one sequence which would get the repeat audience with quotes of stars during awards nite entrance as well as entire nomination sequence deserving a 20 out of 10. Watch out for every heroine's reaction of 'we are just good friends' for SRK, Big B's denial around the presence of SRK, Chunkey Pandey's 'I am the best' take, Sanjay Kapoor's witty hints, Bappi da's ever-ready-to-sing syndrome, Sanju baba's large heart and Rakesh Roshan's love for Hrithik act. Priceless! Also notable is Abhishek taking a dig on himself about his presence in DHOOM 5, Akshay's RETURN OF KHILADI sequence and SRK's winning performance atop the Swiss Alps. Truly rocking and worth the ticket's price.\n\n9) Vishal-Shekhar composed 'Deewangee' is a riot and garners immense repeat value. Call it a publicity stunt, desperate measure, cheap trick or whatever, the fact is that 31 stars coming together adds so much 'masala' to the entire sequence that one wonders how would Farah Khan get something better in her next project?\n\n10) Kirron Kher's take off on cine-maa Rakhi from KARAN ARJUN is fun. A perfect spoof, rather than being a 'dukhiyari maa', she is a 'filmy maa' here who is ever ready to get into histrionics as required by the moment. Watch out for her 'mujhe character mein ghusne de' moment towards the second half followed by a ghostly 'there is someone in the house' dialogue. Excellent!\n\n11) The climax is a true take off on 'Ek Haseena Thi' from KARZ and Farah pays a true homage by even making Shreyas say - \"You will make a KARZ like climax setting and expect the baddie to be scared?\" The sequence which follows is grand and not just works as a spoof but also add to the dramatic quotient.\n\n12) Last but not the least, Farah Khan even takes a spoof on herself as during the end credit rolls, she shows the plight of a director who holds an entire film together but hardly gets any recognition. Watch her walk alone on a red carpet with no one around to whistle and clap!\n\nThese are some of the many 'item sequences' which make OM SHANTI OM a film which would be talked about by many for one reason (call item) or another. Of course from the film's perspective, two actors who are going to benefit most are Arjun Rampal and Deepika Padukone. Arjun is a revelation as he plays an out and out negative character. If he is menacing in the first half, he is cunning and powerful as a 50 something Hollywood baron in his stylish do and impressive prosthetics. His coffee-house sequence with Shahrukh Khan is well done too.\n\nOn the other hand Deepika gets a dream lunch as far as getting into a commercial heroine setup is concerned. She enacts the character from the past as well as today while getting ample opportunity to be there from beginning till the film's end. Her tall persona works in her favor as she stands out in the frames. Shreyas Talpade is quite good in the first half as he seems to be completely oblivious to the star power of the man standing next to him. Kirron Kher is lovable while Javed Sheikh is decent. Debutant Uvika shows a glimpse of her body (talent as her on-screen mom Bindu calls) and is nice.\n\nThere have been item numbers and there have been special appearances. But OM SHANTI OM can well qualify as India's first ever ITEM FILM in itself. There are gimmicks abound but rather than just being publicity stunts, they turn out to be numerous tricks which are up the sleeves of director Farah Khan who along with her writer team of Mushtaq Sheikh & Mayur Puri as well as friend/producer/actor Shahrukh Khan spins a tale that keeps you thoroughly entertained.\n\nRating: ***1/2\n\nThe first day results are out! OM SHANTI OM has fetched a hurricane-like start everywhere. Multiplexes, single screens; big centres, towns, smaller centres; East, West, North, South, everywhere… the film has opened to huge numbers, setting new records on Day 1. The reports are extremely positive, with the youth as also the masses loving the film. As things stand today, the film will have an earth-shattering opening weekend as also Week 1.SAAWARIYA too has opened to big numbers and the brand Sanjay Leela Bhansali coupled with the curiosity to watch the two star kids has resulted in the cineplexes as well as single screens opening to packed houses. The collections are expected to be great in the opening weekend, but the reports are negative and that will affect the film in days to come.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOm Shanti Om has opened to an earth shattering 95-100% response smashing records all over. The film was released on around 600 single screens and set new first day highs on nearly 500 of these 600 screens. The multiplexes saw near 100% collections but the grosses are not as high as last year biggies as it only managed to get 8-10-12 shows as against the 14-16-18 that other biggies have managed. This was due to the clash with Saawariya which took up a similar amount of screens at multiplexes.The reports are very positive from all parts of the country and the film will become a huge all India hit. The opening day in Delhi/UP, East Punjab, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Mysore was humungous as single screens went over capacity at places. The first week should see may more records being crushed.In Overseas the film managed to collect around 125,000 pounds yesterday in UK.\n\nhttp://boxofficeindia.com/osoinitial.htm\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSaawariya has been written off but this seems to be because it lost the initial battle against Om Shanti Om. It may not have opened as well as Om Shanti Om but the opening is still amongst the best of 2007. The film had collections of 95-100% at multiplexes while single screens were around 80-85%. The reports are poor but if it can hold out through the week at multiplexes then it could recover costs or even make some money. Single screens are going to find it tough as cracks in collections can be seen this morning already with a 20-25% drop at places.In Overseas the film collected around 40,000 pounds yesterday in UKhttp://boxofficeindia.com/saawariyainitial.htm\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n'Om Shanti Om' beats 'Saawariya' at the box office : Economic Times\n\nNEW DELHI: The audience verdict is out. The box office seems to favour Shah Rukh Khan's \" Om Shanti Om \" in comparison to Sanjay Leela Bhansali's much-touted magnum opus \" Saawariya \".\n\nWhile King Khan's film registered 90 percent occupancy across the country on its Diwali release, Bhansali's love story managed 60 percent. \" Om Shanti Om \" is director Farah Khan's tribute to the colourful and vibrant cinemas of the 70s and it has Shah Rukh is a new avatar, going shirtless and displaying his six-pack abs, while Bhansali's film is a mystical love story set in Shimla and introduces new faces. According to Vishal Kapur, COO of Fun Cinemas, the Shah Rukh film has generated a lot of repeat audience interest in comparison to \" Saawariya \". \"\n\nAmong our 15 cineplexes across the country, the bigger ones did a business of at least Rs.500,000 and smaller ones Rs.150,000 on Friday. ' Saawariya ' churned out Rs.350,000 at the big centres, while at the smaller ones it could only manage to collect Rs.78,000,\" Kapur told IANS. Kapur feels that \" Om Shanti Om \" could prove an even bigger Shah Rukh hit than his last \" Chak De! India \".\n\n\"It could do better than 'Chak De! ' which picked up after the positive reviews. However, 'Om Shanti Om ' had a great opening. I am a little doubtful about ' Saawariya ',\" said Kapur. The audience response can be gauged from Anirban Basu, a movie buff who saw both the films. \" 'Om Shanti Om' is much more entertaining than 'Saawariya' . SRK's film has a perfect blend of comedy and drama while Bhansali's film is stale and boring. It is extremely slow. Apart from the lavish sets there is nothing in the film to hold the audiences' interest.\" The difference of how well both the films would do in the coming days is also evident from the advance bookings. \"For Saturday, 50 percent of advance booking has been done for 'Om Shanti Om' while for 'Saawariya' it is just a little over 20 percent,\" said Ashok Bisht, assistant manager of JAM multiplex, Noida.\n\nWith both the films in tough competition, the weekend will prove boom time for the multiplexes across the country. \"With two big films releasing the same day, this weekend will prove to be a big money spinner for all multiplexes. However, we have noticed a new trend among some viewers - they want to watch both films,\" said Gautam Dutt, chief marketing officer of PVR Cinema.\n\nhttp://economictimes.indiatimes.com/ET_Cetera/Om_Shanti_Om_beats_Saawariya/articleshow/2532328.cms\n\nOM SHANTI OM\n\nMovie in one line :\n\nOutstanding First Half,A lill slow 2nd Half,Terrific Climax,Over All an Awesome Entertainer.\n\nThat is Om Shanti Om for u.\n\nWhats so good?? :\n\nOutstanding first half.You will never find a dull moment.Right from the scrolling of titles,the tone of movie will be set.Audience would get tired of seeing surprise after surprise,which keeps them busy in screaming ,cheering and clapping.\n\nIts about re-incarnation.So better leave your thinking caps at home and go to movie just for fun,I assure you ,you wont be disappointed.\n\nDull/Boring Moments :\n\nYes,there is a phase in 2nd half,where the pace slows down.Esp after the star studded song is over.Farah should have taken more care in scenes where SRK recollects his previos birth.\n\nOtherwise,its a clean ,entertainer.\n\nPerformances :\n\nDeepika : Wow!!! she;s sizzling.She's here to stay in bollywood.She's surely the next DREAM'y' GIRL of bollywood.She did justice to the role as Shanti.\n\nShreyas : Excells in first half ,OK in 2nd half.\n\nArjun Rampal : He's cool as a bad guy.Gave a punching performance as Mukesh Mehra (MIKE)\n\nAnd well well...there 31 stars in the movie.I cant mention names of all of them.That particular episode where in all these stars appear on screen,will be a gr8 sequence of surprises.Truly entertaining stuff.Just njoy!!\n\nAnd yes..finally SRK.\n\nHe is mindblowing as OM Prakash in first half.Its been a while since we seen him doing mass,comedy entertainers.Here it is.You will njoy SRK's feats in first half,esp when he does a south indian star character.\n\nIn 2nd half ,as OM kapoor,its a cake walk for him.Typical SRK style.\n\nMusic :\n\nAudio is already a block buster in market and i am sure the audio sales will boom again with the movie release.\n\nGreat work by Vishal-Shekar.\n\nFinal Word :\n\nIf Lagan is about Cricket,Chak De about Hockey,RDB about modern Indian Youth,Munna Bhai series is about Living Life Loving others then OSO is about Movies.\n\nA true tribute to Movies especially to 70s.\n\nDada rates it : 8/10\n\nOther Reviews of the film :\n\nOm Shanti Om scores and how!\n\nRating : 3.5/5\n\nOm Seet Om\n\nRating : 3.5/5\n\nSRK's abs win over Ranbir's derriere\n\nRating : 3.5/5\n\nOM SHANTI OM is Bollywood masala in its truest form and also, at its best\n\nRating : 4/5\n\nOSO is intermittently engaging\n\nRating : 3/5\n\nKILL PIRACY : Watch this movie in theatres else please dont watch it.Thank You\n\nsee mister ganapati.. nuvvu kimdakelli oka 55 cigarette packet and remdu coffee patraa.. dabbulivvamdi?? uhu..nuvvu velli pattukuraa.. elaa patrammamtaaramdi.. kimdana hotel vadiki

tears in your eyes after the movie.\n\nAny person watching this movie will be taken a ride throught those lovely college days.\n\nOne or the other scene in the movie might have surely happened to you in those days.\n\nMUSIC : Ladies n Gentlemen,we have an answer to AR Rehman.Though too early to say this,he has the potential.Way to go Mickey!!\n\nStory,Screen Play,Direction : Well the real hero of the movie is director,the feel of the movie,the siutations of the movie.The hero of the movie is that period of our lives which we can never forget.Kudos to the director\n\nPerformances : Well..i donno their real names...(i dont need to know their name also).They are all the characters...you can see yourself in those characters...too good performances from them..\n\nPersonally i liked Rajesh and Tyson's characters.\n\nA blog is not enough to write down what i went through when i came out of the movie.\n\nI felt very nostalgic of my college days.\n\nAnd being an MGITian ,this movie has that extra speciality for me.I can imagine how would it be for CBIT students.(MGIT is sister concern inst of CBIT.Both the campus are side by side with no compound wall seperating.We all used to roam around and njoy in CBIT as well)\n\nFinal Comments :\n\nDont give a 2nd thought.Juss go n watch it.\n\n3 cheers to sekhar kammula.!!\n\nDada Rates it 8.75/10.\n\nKILL PIRACY : Watch this movie in theatres else please dont watch it.Thank You\n\nThe much awaited music of Om Shanti Om finally arrives.\n\nHave you ever heard of beating expectations??\n\nIf not..then go get a CD/Casste of OSO...\n\nIt will beat your expectations...\n\nA Brief intro about OSO for the starters..\n\na) This is the biggest ever film starring Shahrukh Khan\n\nb) This is the second directorial venture for Farah Khan who made a smashing debut with Main Hoon Naa\n\nc) The film has created huge buzz accompanied by immense hype ever since it was launched\n\nd) Vishal-Shekhar and Javed Akhtar saab are expected to bring on table a massy popular score\n\ne) Last but not the least,it has almost every contemporary hero of bollywood.\n\nAre these expectations met? Well, let me take you through themmm..\n\n'Aankhon Mein Teri' : This is an extremely soulful hear.On hearing it initially, it is the sheer 'different' factor due to which it takes some time to follow the composition. But once you have heard it closely with lights switched off and no interference around you, 'Aankhon Mein Teri' turns out to be an irresistible piece of melody that lingers on for hours.\n\nFurthermore, Vishal himself writes lyrics for this track which turns out to be a unique experience since it shows the sensitive romantic side of him. But the biggest of all is K.K. who showcases once again that he is THE most versatile singer who we have in the Bollywood musical scene today!\n\n'Dard-E-Disco' : I have been singing this since morning after i listened it.Its an instant catchy number.This is the very track which is much talked about for Shahrukh Khan's 'perfect-six-abs' .\n\n'Deewangi Deewangi' :\n\nOne would have expected the graph of the album to at maximum stay steady after 'Aankhon Mine' and 'Dard-E-Disco' but to one's pleasant surprise, it shoots up amazingly with which hooks you on within first one minute itself. A sure shot chartbuster which could well have been the opening number for the film's promotion, 'Deewangi Deewangi' is what qualifies as a trademark number which could have been lapped up by Yash Raj Films or Dharma Productions.\n\n'Main Agar Kahoon' :\n\n'Main Agar Kahoon' gives a completely different flavor to the album by bringing some soulfull pain to it after a rocking outing experienced in last few songs. Kudos to Sonu.\n\n'Jag Soona Soona Lage' :\n\nA track which has a thorough Indian base to it and makes for a passionate outing, expect it to make multiple appearance during the film's narrative.I am sure this Will get on to you after you watch the movie.\n\n'Dhoom Taana':\n\nA typical bollywood DHOLS,GHUNGRUs number with KJ,Yash rajs kinda settings and dances.\n\n'Dastaan-E-Om Shanti Om' :\n\nFinally comes a track which seems to be set in accordance to the reincarnation theme of the film. Set as a tribute to 'Ek Haseena Thi Ek Deewana Tha' [Karz] with even the lyrics taking a cue from the classic track by Lakshmikant-Pyarelal, 'Dastaan-E-Om Shanti Om' is set in exactly the same story telling mode. The styling of this Shaan rendered track follows the same mode as one expects a high voltage dramatic narration when the song is on.\n\nThere are many other remixes,medleys in the album which will keep you swinging...\n\nCredit must go to Farah Khan who mixes the commercial elements of the movie with an inherent class which she wanted to lay out in the soundtrack for Om Shanti Om. This is why a fine balancing act is done in the album with hardcore massy tracks like 'Deewangi Deewangi' [best of the lot], 'Dhoom Taana' and 'Dard-E-Disco' presented along with touching tracks like 'Aankhon Mein Teri', 'Main Agar Kahoon' and 'Jag Soona Soona Lage'. And then there is always a 'Dastaan-E-Om Shanti Om' to bring the nostalgia of 'Ek Haseena Thi' [Karz'].\n\nOm Shanti Om is easily one of the most complete scores by Vishal-Shekhar and Javed Akhtar\n\nRating 4/5.\n\nThe craze of Chak De is still ON and SRK is coming with his OM SHANTI OM...have a look\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1ionZznx1Q\n\nNo one can match his style and grace...\n\nWatch out Nag is coming as DON...redefining the meaning of DON..\n\nYamaDonga\n\nMovie in one line : Yamadonga minus Yamalokam scenes = utter rubbish\n\nNegatives :\n\nLack of good comedy : There is no single scene which evokes you into laughter.Brahmanandam was not used properly.Even Ali is under utilised.And suprisingly there is an element of vulgar and sense less comedy in 2nd half.\n\nDuration of the film : As the film approaches climax,people started moving out of theatres.I hope the movie will be trimmed ASAP.\n\nBoring Later part of 2nd half : There are no interesting elements in the movie after NTR comes back from Yamalokam.The screenplay tests your patience.\n\nHeroine's character is very old fashioned.\n\nInfact you feel as if you are watching many old movies.(Heroine-daughter of dead zamindar-relatives tortue for her property)\n\nPositives :\n\nMohanBabu : One word..he is awesome as Yama.This movie again proves why he is called dialogue.\n\nNTR : There is one scene before interval where NTR confronts Yama.The war of dialogues ,can be said as the best scene shot in recent times.NTR excelled.I guess we can say...only NTR can say those dialogues in current generation.On flipside,he should take care about his hairstyle.\n\nDances : WOW!! You have to see to feel it.Esp Nachore Nachore song....full marks to Dance Director.\n\nYamalokam Set and Graphics : As i said before...this movie is nothing if Yamalokam and the scenes in Yamalokam had not been shot in such a way.\n\nSenior NTR : Theatre went berserk when \"Anna garu\" appears.It was very heartening to see him again.But my personal feeling is that director shouldnt have made Sr NTR to use \"Nandamuri\" vamsam and stuff...\n\nFinal Comments :\n\nRajamouli should have taken more care in presenting this in a better and clean entertainer.I doubt if this movie draws repeat audience.\n\nWith the concept new to current lot of audeince,NTR new looks and no competition near by...we can say Rajamouli might esacape first flop of his career...but having said that....this is just n above avg film.\n\nDada Rates it 6/10.\n\nKILL PIRACY : Watch this movie in theatres else please dont watch it.Thank You\n\nCHAKE DE INDIA\n\n\"I saw first hockey match in my Life!! Thanks to SRK and Shimit Amin\"\n\nMovie in one line : Chak De!!\n\nLet me start with Negatives.\n\nWhat it Lacks??\n\nA typical movie viewer will compare this with Lagaan.So did I.Let me tell you,LAGAAN is a once in life time movie.And you know what \"Once in a Life Time \" means.\n\nChak De some how couldnt get that emotion,passion..that patriotic feeling.Its more of a passion for game than passion for nation.\n\nAnother thing which i felt missing (many may not agree with me) is..the movie should have had atleast few scenes dialogues which tells about Past Glory of Indian Hockey.\n\nNow coming to the real Chak De..\n\nFirst things first....I will assure you that you will never find a dull moment in the movie.Its a good entertainer.\n\nPerformances :\n\nSRK :\n\nWhat can i say about him??\n\nThis role is a cake walk for the KING,the DON,the Baadshah of Bollywood.\n\nIts very heartening to see SRK coming out of his routine lover boy movies and doing films like Paheli,DON and now Chak De.\n\nHis performance in Chak De can easily be in top 5 of his best performances.\n\nAfter the final…. We see him just going back and sit down….. but not going into the field running….. When he sits down he doesn’t sit and laugh but … has tears in his eyes…. this is one of the best scenes ever shot in history of Cinema.\n\nThe fit of Shah Rukh as a hockey coach -- inspiring, canny, frustrated, helpless and profoundly hopeful -- is so naturally perfect that it's a wonder he hasn't done a sports film before. It's been a while since we've seen him visibly relish a role like this, and while he has to mouth some clunky dialogue, Khan is simply super.\n\nRest of the caste : Well ,apart from SRK and his team there are no other major roles.Coming to the performances of the girls...Apart from the captain,as far as i know,all of them are new to silver screen.They really rocked,esp the girls who played Preeti,Komal and Kaur.The way they speack the regional lingo,the way they show the passion,the emotion is just awesome.\n\nHighLights :\n\nI have seen many super duper hit movies in multiplxes.But never did i see audience whistling,shouting,cheering,clapping through out the movie.Chak De did it.Infact me too very rarely shout,clap in the theatres.I was clapping all the way. :)\n\n7 years of pain and shame written on Kabir was expressed in eyes of SRK on every day in the field\n\n7 years of loneliness and away from his mothers fav home was shown in his constant dedication and devotion to make a team and make them win the world cup\n\nThere are few scenes and dialogues,which will surely make you clap.\n\nThere is one dialogue by SRK \"pehli baar koi gore ko hamare tirange ko lehrate hue dekha\"-- total theatre went berserk.\n\nI wont play spoilsport in revealing all the good scenes.Go n Njoy.\n\nMusic :\n\nThere are only 2 songs in the movie which are well placed.The other songs in audio album come as back ground.Mind you,they help to keep up the pace of movie.\n\nFinal Comments :\n\nThis film basically shows you the team spirit,the unity and proves the point that \"Jo Nahin Ho Sakta..wahi tho karna Hain\"\n\nI saw in TV that Chak De has got poor openings,though the talk is good.\n\nFor me it doesnt matter.I assure you that you wont be disappointed watching this flick.Easily the best so far in 2007.\n\nDADA Rates it 9/10\n\nOther reviews of the movie :\n\nKILL PIRACY : Watch this movie in theatres else please dont watch it.Thank You"
