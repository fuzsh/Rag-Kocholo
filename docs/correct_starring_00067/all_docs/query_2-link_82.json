        "text": "Date of Birth\n\n2 November 1965, New Delhi, India\n\nNickname\n\nKing Khan\n\nSRK\n\nThe Badshah of Bollywood\n\nShahrukh\n\nThe King of Bollywood\n\nHeight\n\n5′ 8″ (1.73 m)\n\nMini Biography\n\nSharukh Khan was born on 2 November 1965 in New Delhi, India. He married Gauri Khan on 25 October 1991. They have two children, son Aryan Khan (b. 1997), and daughter Suhana (b. 2000). Khan started out his career by appearing in several television serials during 1988-1990. He made his film debut with the commercially successful Deewana (1992). He began to achieve success at the box office from his villainous roles in films such as Darr (1993), Baazigar (1993), and Anjaam (1994). During his years in the Indian film industry, he won seven Filmfare best actor awards and had significant box-office success. Some of his films include Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Om Shanti Om(2007), and Chak De India! (2007). While he does his romantic scenes during songs or in his films, he copies the style of Rajesh Khanna, and his acting style has influences of his inspirations–Dilip Kumar and Rajesh Khanna\n\nMini Biography\n\nBorn to Mir Taj Muhammad Khan and Lateef Fatima in New Delhi, India, his mother always believed that her son was destined to be a great actor, often citing the resemblance between Khan and Dilip Kumar, another Bollywood legend. His name literally translates into Face of the King.\n\nBorn and brought up in Delhi, he was a brilliant student and an all-rounder. At St. Columba’s School, he won the prestigious Sword of Honour. He was also the captain of his football, hockey, and cricket teams all at the same time. After sustaining a football injury, he started to consider acting as a career. He graduated with honours in economics from Hansraj College and did his master’s in mass communications from Jamiya Miliya Islamia.\n\nKhan then went on to study theater under the reputed Barry John, whom he credits for carving out the actor inside him, but his mentor considers his pupil as being solely responsible for his greatness and glory, citing Shahrukh to have the perfect combination of talent, perseverance, belief in yourself, a never-give-up-attitude and of course, a bit of luck–factors needed for success.\n\nShahrukh began his journey by landing the lead role of a commando in 1988 drama series “Fauji” (1988). He was much applauded for his work and soon became the heartthrob of teenage girls, bagging roles in other serials such as “Circus” (1989) and _”Dil Dariya” (????)_, the former was delayed because of various reasons. He also had a minor role in a made-for-television film called In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones(1989) (TV).\n\nHis big screen debut came in the form of Deewana (1992), in which he acted alongside the then-top actress of Bollywood, Divya Bharti, and won the prestigious Filmfare award for best debut actor–male. He also starred earlier in a small role in Dil Aashna Hai (…The Heart Knows) (1992). This was followed by another hit, Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman (1992).\n\nAfter a few more films that did average or less at the box office, Khan made the unique choice against all advice to opt for villainous roles and played obsessive, somewhat psychotic characters in Darr (1993) and Baazigar (1993). To everyone’s surprise, the films were massive hits and Shahrukh earned his first best actor award, and was also nominated in the villainous role category. His acting was applauded by all in the Indian film industry and carved a niche for the future king. The same year, he bagged the Critics Award for best performance in Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa(1993), a film he often recalls as among his favourites.\n\nA series of hits followed to what would be remembered as one of Khan’s most iconic performances, a film that is arguably India’s biggest blockbuster and truly complete with the very best of drama, comedy, romance, thrills, and a bit of action. The epic Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge(1995) was released on 20th October 1995 and, as of 2011, was still showing in a Mumbai theatre, thus being the longest-running initial release in cinema history. Coincidentally, Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise was the initial choice as the main lead, but the role went to Shahrukh who is now nicknamed ‘Tom Cruise of India’.\n\nKhan has come a long way since then, with a string of hits under his belt, which include some of Bollywood’s biggest in both national and international markets, namely Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham… (2001), Devdas (2002/I), Swades (2004), Chak De India! (2007), Om Shanti Om (2007), My Name Is Khan (2010), Ra.One (2011), and Don 2 (2011), made him the undisputed megastar of India with a record number of best actor trophies and numerous power awards.\n\nHis fame does not stop there: following the release of his films overseas, he has been credited as the world’s biggest movie star and was named among the 50 most powerful people by “Newsweek.”\n\nEven with all the success and boasting, and a statue among the elite in Madame Tussaud’s, he is quoted as being one of the most humble and down-to-earth personalities, although his wit is unmatched by even the best in the business. This led to him being a host of many television programmes, game shows, and award functions, including India’s version of “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?”\n\nThe king is an active philanthropist, funding numerous humanitarian projects and charities as well as being personally involved in them, although he prefers to keep this aspect out of the limelight.\n\nHis larger-than-life persona continues to win hearts all over the world with a fan following going into billions. He is the face of brands such as Pepsi, Tag Heuer, and he has a 8-billion-dirham property development that is comprised of multiple residential towers in the United Arab Emirates named after him called Shah Rukh Khan Boulevard. He co-owns two production houses–Dreamz Unlimited and Red Chilis Entertainment–and the IPL Cricket team Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\nHe is the recipient of the Padma Shri (India), l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (France), the Unesco Pyramide con Marni (UNESCO), l’Étoile d’Or (by the king of Morocco), and the Chubb fellowship (Yale). Khan currently resides in his palatial beachside mansion called Mannat in Mumbai, India, with his wife Gauri Khan and two children, Aryan and Suhana.\n\nIMDb Mini Biography By: ali.shah@doctors.net.uk\n\nSpouse\n\nGauri Khan (25 October 1991 – present) 2 children\n\nTrade Mark\n\nHis Dimples\n\nHis Smile\n\nTrivia\n\nStudied in St. Columba’s school, New Delhi, where he was awarded the ‘Sword of Honor’, essentially the award for best student.\n\nAlthough his birth name is spelled Shahrukh, he prefers and signs his name as Shah Rukh.\n\nHindi megastar\n\n2 children with Gauri, Aryan and Suhana\n\nHe agreed to star in Aditya Chopra’s films without looking at the script first.\n\nOne of the three Khans that ruled Bollywood in the 1990s till 2012.

And I wish I danced as well as he does!\n\nYes, I do have a close circle of friends and I am very fortunate to have them as friends. I feel very close to them I think friends are everything in life after your family. You come across lots of people all the time but you only make very few friends and you have to be true to them otherwise what’s the point in life?\n\nI’d rather sink trying to be different, than stay afloat like everyone else.\n\nI cannot repay my fans for what they have done for me, they have given me so much love and that love has taken me to the number 1 position where I am today, the only thing I can do for my fans is to never stop working, and to do films till the very end, it is the only way I can express my love for them.\n\nTo me, Devdas is the end of love stories. I’ve portrayed an obsessed lover, a nice lover, an angry lover, a romantic lover. And now I’ve played Devdas. For someone who doesn’t even like love stories, I’ve played an awful lot of lovers. Personally speaking, I wouldn’t see any of the romantic films I’ve acted in.\n\nI’m the luckiest man in the world and I don’t want to hide from the faces I’m acting for. So I don’t surround myself with guards, I’ve never given an interview in which I’ve said I feel bad that I can’t go shopping or I can’t go to Chowpatty and eat bhelpuri without being mobbed. I’m not the kind of guy who goes out wearing dark glasses (I don’t think I’m a big enough star to hide behind them, honest). I go to see movies in the cinema theatres, I go to restaurants with my family and friends even though I know people are going to disturb me there.\n\nGod has become a generic term like ‘mind blowing.’ It is embarrassing. I would have said that to Amitabh Bachchan, Naseeruddin Shah, Nana Patekar. I used to tell them I want to stand in the same space as you. I’ve told Kamal Haasan and Rajesh Khanna Saab, I just want to touch you. They are the gods of acting. When people call me God, I say, no, I’m still an angel or saint of acting. I still have a long way to go. Though I cannot ever surpass these legends I would like to be next to them.\n\n(August 2004): Awards that ignore me are losers.\n\n(August 2004): I’m try-sexual. I try anything that’s sexual.\n\n(August 2004): I have no competition. Every year the names I’m pitted against keep changing. You can’t cream the competition, you have to kill it.\n\nI keep hearing that our films are escapist and unreal but I find our films the most real in the world. We don’t have people going up in a rocket and single-handedly blowing up a meteor. We don’t have a president on Air Force One saving the world or things coming out of people’s stomachs. Our fantasies and escapism are real. It’s just people singing and dancing in the street. If England had won the World Cup you would have seen people singing and dancing like that.\n\nI don’t like wearing dark glasses. I’m happy with the fact that people know me. I want people to scream and shout at me, I want people to trouble me when I’m having lunch, I like six bodyguards around me. I love being a star. I find it very strange when people who are famous say they don’t want to be photographed. I don’t want to be photographed first thing in the morning, I don’t want people peeping into my bedroom, but besides that, it’s a wonderful life.\n\n“I haven’t given up smoking. I’m very clear about it, it’s a personal choice. I want to cut down on it. It shouldn’t be made into an issue to say, damn good or damn bad. Whether I give it up or not shouldn’t be an issue.” (Movie Mag, May 2006)\n\n“I was supposed to have done Rang De Basanti (2006), the guy on the motorbike. I didn’t have the dates. They were shooting in Delhi and the dates were clashing with Paheli.” (Movie Mag, May 2006)\n\n“It’s not like Steven Spielberg is waiting with a script for me. I don’t think I’ll ever be offered a great international film in my lifetime, so I’d rather be a king here. Moreover, Indian cinema is the greatest in the world. But of course, after spending three months in LA, London, and New York I found that our cinema is a little exaggerated. To make a mark in the West we have to reach their level without losing our identity, culture or songs. I don’t want to star in a Hollywood film, but want to make a film that crosses over universally.” (Movie Mag, May 2006)\n\nOn trying to get Paheli (2005) an Oscar nomination: “There’s a misreport here about our lobbying at the Oscars. The understanding that we have of the Oscars is very different from how it really is. Because Indian film, foreign films are not known, you’re supposed to hire a PR company which we did. It’s not as if you just go there, show your films, lobby and talk to them. You’re not allowed to lobby as in you’re not allowed to meet the Academy members, talk to them or even make a call to them. You just keep advertising in the ‘For Consideration For Oscars’ category. We took out full page ads in papers like Variety and Hollywood Reporter. The only good thing we did was that we advertised very frequently, it was promoted on the same scale as the biggest of films. We did it because we could afford it.” (Movie Mag, May 2006)\n\n“I felt Ashoka the Great (2001) should have been chosen for the Oscars. We had worked towards that. We had these international distributors for it. We were the first to actually release an Indian film internationally in traditionally non-Indian theaters. We spent a lot of money and lost a lot of money too. We were the first to put up boardings in London, in tube stations. We did speak to everyone who was anyone here, wondering if Asoka could go to the Oscars. But the one that got chosen was Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India (2001) which was even better. So we had no complaints. After that I didn’t make any film for the foreign market.” (Movie Mag, May 2006)\n\nYou must respect your seniors, bu never get intimidated by them. Winning should be a habit, not an option. The four Hs are important when you play to win — honesty, humor, hard work and a bit of haraamipan.\n\nI don’t look at the figures that my movies make. The only figures I look at are girl’s figures. (When asked to comment on what he felt about the figures his movies gross.)\n\nWhenever I fail as a father or husband… a toy and a diamond always works.\n\nIf I talk to a girl, it’s assumed that I’m having a scene with her. If I don’t, then it’s assumed that I’m gay.\n\nI don’t kiss on screen. Period.\n\nThere are only two Khans. Ghenghis Khan and Shahrukh Khan.\n\nSex is not required to sell my film. My name is enough.\n\nYou never win the silver, you only lose the gold.\n\nI am very shy. If I am flying British Airways and the air hostess asks me two questions, and I don’t understand her accent – I will go hungry for the entire flight.\n\nThe dream I chased, took me on a journey. A journey more rewarding then the goals, the achievements. When I look back it’s like facing a million mirrors. Each reflection opens a window. A window to the world I’ve just discovered. The world I want to share with all of you.\n\nIf I am a role model, I must be the worst one in the world.\n\nI’ve never had a girl make a pass at me.\n\nTogetherness, passion, laughter, faith, trust and jealousy are the essential ingredients of love.\n\nThe collar-bone is my favorite part of the human body.\n\nIf asking me whether sleeping with X or Y gives the media pleasure, then so be it. It’s a small price to pay.\n\nI don’t think I would have become an actor if Kajol wasn’t a part of my films and life. And I don’t think I would have continued acting if Rani wasn’t a part of films either. I think perhaps in seventeen years they sum up my career as the most beautiful career.\n\nRani has looked her career best in Paheli. For myself, Aziz and Juhi, Rani is the only leading lady for our production house. She is the best actress we have had in I’d say the last 16 years!\n\n[Speaking to Rani Mukerji on a talk show] I’ve known from the time you started. I’m very fond of you… I love you! We’ve done different kinds of roles together. Chalte Chalte I think was very interesting. Kuch Kuch Hota Hai was interesting because you’d just started out… Its wonderful to see you evolve as an actor over the years and personally I do believe that Rani Mukerji is the best actress in the country in the last 16 years. I think she’s absolutely wonderful!\n\n[In the making of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai] I’ve worked with a few new comers [Mahima Choudary, Preity Zinta, Rani Mukerji] recently and Rani is the best of the lot. She lights up the screen with her appearance, she’s very very beautiful and extremely talented, it was a pleasure working with her."
