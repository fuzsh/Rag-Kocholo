        "text": "Cut the crap, cut the gyan-baazi, cut the will-it-won’t-it work naatak. Shah Rukh Khan and Farah Khan’s OM SHANTI OM is a true-blue masala entertainer. If MAIN HOON NA was a chauka, this one hits a sixer!\n\nWait, a word of advice to all netizens/readers across the globe. Don’t, for God’s sake don’t, raise exclamations like kab?, kyun? kahan? as OM SHANTI OM begins to unravel. This is atypical Manmohan Desai film presented in a novel avtaar by Farah Khan. It’s definitely not for pseudos or advocates of arthouse cinema.\n\nNow let’s clear some myths surrounding OM SHANTI OM. Is it the 2007 adaptation of Subhash Ghai’s immensely likable reincarnation film KARZ? Does it have traces of KUDRAT? Or MADHUMATI? Or MILAN? Or KARAN ARJUN? Hold on, there’s a dash of KARZ, a bit of KARAN ARJUN, a sprinkling of KUDRAT, but beyond that it’s a film that makes you nostalgic about 1970s Bollywood.\n\nTo sum up, OM SHANTI OM is paisa vasool entertainment. We haven’t seen SRK in a hardcore masala film since quite some time. He had drifted to other genres, which proved his range as an actor of repute and cemented his status further. With OM SHANTI OM, he gives back to the audience what he himself grew up on — a thorough entertainer that will have the audience thirsting for more.\n\nThis Diwali, have a blast!\n\nOM SHANTI OM tells the story of Om [Shah Rukh Khan] and Shanti [Deepika Padukone]. Om is a junior artist in the 70s. Shanti is the reigning superstar. He is her biggest fan. He is in love with her. Om dreams of being a superstar, but an incident changes his life forever.\n\nOm dies in a mishap, but is reborn into the present day. He attempts to discover the mystery of his demise…\n\nThe general feeling is, Farah Khan has remade Ghai’s KARZ from Frame A to Z. False! There’re similarities, but it’s not a rehashed version of Ghai’s film. For, OM SHANTI OM takes you by complete surprise at several points.\n\nThe first twist in the tale [Arjun – Deepika’s heated confrontation, with SRK listening to this important conversation] comes as a bolt from the blue. The second jhatka comes slightly before the intermission, when Arjun takes Deepika to the set of his film ‘Om Shanti Om’ and the entire episode that follows, right till the intermission, is spellbinding. That’s a brilliant stroke from the writing [screenplay: Mushtaq Shaikh and Farah Khan] as also the execution point of view. When the opulent set is set to flames, it leaves you wide-eyed and awe-struck. Such is the impact!\n\nThe post-interval portions only get better and better! If the initial portions are laced with humour [the premiere of ‘Dreamy Girl’, the Manoj Kumar episode, Ghai directing Rishi on ‘Om Shanti Om’ song, et al], the second half moves into a new zone completely.\n\nIt’s punar-janam now, but thankfully, there’re no lightening, no fireworks, no zooming of the camera on the idols of Gods. The drama builds up gradually. The voices that SRK keeps hearing, the ‘fire’ soon after the ‘Dard-E-Disco’ track, the mother [Kirron Kher], an old lady now, chasing Om’s car [reminds you of Raakhee of KARAN ARJUN], the flashes of SRK’s earlier birth while receiving the Filmfare Award — the incidents that make him realize that his life was cut short in his earlier janam have been well structured.\n\nWhen Deepika re-emerges as well, the viewer is confused, but the mystery is resolved towards the end, which, again, takes you by complete surprise.\n\nGiven the fact that OM SHANTI OM is a Manmohan Desai kind of a film set in the present-day, it would be foolhardy to ask questions, raise eyebrows and look for logic. But the second half could’ve been crisper [length: 18 reels/2.46 hours], although Shirish Kunder’s editing is perfect.\n\nFarah knows what her priorities are and most importantly, knows exactly what her target audience is. The execution of a number of sequences clearly shows Farah’s growth as a storyteller. Mushtaq and Farah’s writing works because the writers pull out several surprises in those 2.46 hours.\n\nV. Manikanandan’s cinematography captures the gloss and grandeur to the minutest. The opulent sets [Sabu Cyril] deserve distinction marks. Dialogues [Mayur Puri] are witty and do raise a chuckle at several points. Background score [Sandeep Chowta] is effective.\n\nVishal-Shekhar’s music is first-rate. The score is in sync with the content of the film and what accentuate the goings-on are the choreography and execution. Although every song is visually enticing, the 21-star track as also ‘Dard-E-Disco’ will have the masses going into a frenzy.\n\nNow to the performances! SRK proves his supremacy yet again. If you thought that playing to the gallery came easy to certain actors only, watch SRK spin magic in OM SHANTI OM. He’s magnificent, the star attraction, the soul of this film, the true baadshah.\n\nDeepika has all it takes to be a top star — the personality, the looks and yes, she’s supremely talented too. Standing in the same frame as SRK and getting it right is no small achievement. She comes as a whiff of fresh air!\n\nArjun Rampal is a complete revelation. Cast in a negative role this time, he enacts his part with panache and style. Shreyas Talpade is another surprise. A complete natural, he stands on his feet all through, not getting swayed while sharing the screen space with the topmost star.\n\nKirron Kher is superb as the over the top mom. Javed Sheikh is alright. Bindu adds to the funny moments.\n\nOn the whole, OM SHANTI OM is Bollywood masala in its truest form and also, at its best. At the box-office, the film will set new records in days to come and has the power to emerge one of the biggest hits of SRK’s career. Blockbuster hit!\n\nThe much awaited music of Om Shanti Om finally arrives on stands this weekend. IndiaFM was invited for an exclusive preview for the film’s soundtrack. Read on to know more about what the album has to offer. Also, tune in on Saturday to hear the songs – yet again, EXCLUSIVELY on IndiaFM.\n\nExpectations. Expectations. And some more expectations. This is how one looks forward to the music of Om Shanti Om from which one expects nothing but the best. And why not? After all:\n\na) This is the biggest ever film starring Shahrukh Khan\n\nb) This is the second directorial venture for Farah Khan who made a smashing debut with Main Hoon Naa\n\nc) The film has created huge buzz accompanied by immense hype ever since it was launched\n\nd) Vishal-Shekhar and Javed Akhtar saab are expected to bring on table a massy popular score\n\ne) Last but not the least, the film travels decades which makes one look forward to variety in the soundtrack.\n\nAre these expectations met? Well, very much as each of the seven unique tracks bring on a variety that makes Om Shanti Om a winner all the way.\n\nIt is a truly unconventional beginning to Om Shanti Om as instead of an expected ‘Beat-one-Beat-two’ beginning from Vishal-Shekhar, one gets to hear a rather serene ‘Aankhon Mein Teri‘ which turns out to be an extremely soulful hear. On hearing it initially, it is the sheer ‘different’ factor due to which it takes some time to follow the composition. But once you have heard it closely with lights switched off and no interference around you, ‘Aankhon Mein Teri‘ turns out to be an irresistible piece of melody that lingers on for hours.\n\nThere are number of factors which go in making ‘Aankhon Mein‘ a song that would be remembered for time to come. First and foremost it is the re-discovery of Vishal-Shekhar who create an unconventional tune that breaks the norms which they had themselves set for them. Furthermore, Vishal himself writes lyrics for this track which turns out to be a unique experience since it shows the sensitive romantic side of him. But the biggest of all is K.K. who showcases once again that he is THE most versatile singer who we have in the Bollywood musical scene today!\n\nWell, those who love the dance numbers coming from Vishal-Shekhar don’t have to wait for long with the arrival of ‘Dard-E-Disco‘. This is the very track which is much talked about for Shahrukh Khan’s ‘perfect-six-abs’ and unlike ‘Aankhon Mein‘ which grows immensely only after a few hearings, it is an instant hit from the GO. Reminding of the style, rhythm and the funk of ‘Kaal Dhamaal‘ [Kaal], ‘Dard E Disco‘ is a ‘jump-on-the-dance-floor’ number which has a Persian touch to it even as overall feel of the song stays on to be Western.\n\nFrom the title of the song, one would have expected ‘Dard-E-Disco‘ to belong to the 80s era with a Mithun hangover it but that’s not the case as the song turns out to be pretty contemporary. Sukhwinder Singh is in his full elements for this track that has some spicy writing by Javed Akhtar saab. Marianne, Nisha and Caralisa come together for backup vocals who give the song a perfect disco feel. Later in the album arrives the ‘remix version’ which makes for a justified presence due to the song’s theme and keeps the entertainment alive.\n\nOne would have expected the graph of the album to at maximum stay steady after ‘Aankhon Mine‘ and ‘Dard-E-Disco‘ but to one’s pleasant surprise, it shoots up amazingly with ‘Deewangi Deewangi‘ which hooks you on within first one minute itself. A sure shot chartbuster which could well have been the opening number for the film’s promotion, ‘Deewangi Deewangi‘ is what qualifies as a trademark number which could have been lapped up by Yash Raj Films or Dharma Productions.\n\nComing together of Shaan, Udit Narayan, Shreya Ghoshal, Sunidhi Chauhan and Rahul Saxena (heard in Indian Idol) ensures that there is not a single dull moment in this instant-attention-grabbing track. Boasting of the innocence in melody that was witnessed in the 70s and now presented in the 21st century ‘avtar’ with a fusion of ‘qawalli’, ‘bhangra’ and western arrangements, ‘Deewangi Deewangi‘ that also incorporates the sound of Om Shanti Om would definitely lit up the screen when it is played. It’s ‘Rainbow Mix’ only confirms the thought as it helps in consolidating the sound of the song.\n\nIf you have ever been in love, you wouldn’t have missed out the dancing-couple-on-a-glass-floor gift item that has a sweet sounding tinkling sound which compliments their moves! This is the sound that marks the beginning of ‘Main Agar Kahoon‘ which reminds one of the 60s era when songs like these were in vogue. Picturised on the likes of Rajendra Kumar and Shammi Kapoor, they were mostly sung by Late Mohd. Rafi.\n\nThis is the very reason why Sonu Nigam has been roped in to croon ‘Main Agar Kahoon‘ which required the kind of rendition which would succeed in getting you nostalgic about the music of the era gone by. With Shreya Ghoshal in tow who is just the right fit for a song belonging to this genre, ‘Main Agar Kahoon‘ gives a completely different flavor to the album by bringing some ‘thehrav‘ to it after a rocking outing experienced in last few songs.\n\nNames like Rahat Fateh Ali Khan and Richa Sharma are good enough reasons to expect a quality offering from Vishal-Shekhar in the song ‘Jag Soona Soona Lage‘. Written by guest lyricist Kumaar, this painful yet mellow track about separation has it’s beginning borrowed from the opening sound of ‘Main Agar Kahoon‘. Both the singers are highly competent in this beautifully written number that shows an altogether different facet of the composer-duo. A track which has a thorough Indian base to it and makes for a passionate outing, expect it to make multiple appearance during the film’s narrative.\n\nIt’s time for the world of ‘Tohfa Tohfa Tohfa‘ [Tohfa] as ‘dhols’ and ‘ghunghroos’ come together in unison to create the sound of late 70s and early 80s. With a Lakshmikant-Pyayelal patent all over ‘Dhoom Taana‘, it is only consolidated further as Shreya Ghoshal sings the song in a style that was made famous by yesteryear singer S. Janaki in Jeetendra-Sridevi-Jaya Pradha films. Roping in of Abhijeet too seems to be done with a purpose since it only brings the nostalgia of Kishore Kumar in spite of no conscious effort by the singer to do so.\n\nAll through this vintage song, the ‘dhol’ beats accompanied by the chorus of ‘Dhoom Taana‘ is hard to be missed though there is a shift in mood mid-way with rock-n-roll. Just recently there was news around Deepika Padukone shaking a leg with Sunil Dutt, Jeetendra and Rajesh Khanna, courtesy SFX. Well, ‘Dhoom Taana‘ seems to be just the candidate for that setting! A winner which should definitely have the house on fire as it unfolds on the big screen. Especially watch out for the crescendo towards the song’s end.\n\nFinally comes a track which seems to be set in accordance to the reincarnation theme of the film. Set as a tribute to ‘Ek Haseena Thi Ek Deewana Tha‘ [Karz] with even the lyrics taking a cue from the classic track by Lakshmikant-Pyarelal, ‘Dastaan-E-Om Shanti Om‘ is set in exactly the same story telling mode. The styling of this Shaan rendered track follows the same mode as one expects a high voltage dramatic narration when the song is on.\n\nHigh on orchestra, ‘Dastaan-E-Om Shanti Om‘ is an elaborate number which has a lot to convey through it’s lyrics by Javed Akhtar saab. With its ‘mukhda’ based on the film’s theme music, the song makes an appearance again towards the end of the album. In it’s ‘remix version’ as ‘Dastaan – The Dark Side Mix‘, it is pepped up further with additional arrangements.\n\nAnother remix track which takes the album towards its completion is ‘Om Shanti Om – Medley Mix’ which basically is an amalgamation of all the tracks from the film presented in a ‘club-mix’ avtar. A good way to wind up the album. Finally comes a minute long theme piece which is titled ‘Om Shanti Om – Themes’. Played on a piano, it leaves a lasting impact even as one can revisit the sound in at least half the tracks in the album.\n\nCredit must go to Farah Khan who mixes the commercial elements of the movie with an inherent class which she wanted to lay out in the soundtrack for Om Shanti Om. This is why a fine balancing act is done in the album with hardcore massy tracks like ‘Deewangi Deewangi‘ [best of the lot], ‘Dhoom Taana‘ and ‘Dard-E-Disco‘ presented along with touching tracks like ‘Aankhon Mein Teri’, ‘Main Agar Kahoon’ and ‘Jag Soona Soona Lage‘. And then there is always a ‘Dastaan-E-Om Shanti Om’ to bring the nostalgia of ‘Ek Haseena Thi‘ [Karz’].\n\nOm Shanti Om is easily one of the most complete scores by Vishal-Shekhar and Javed Akhtar."
