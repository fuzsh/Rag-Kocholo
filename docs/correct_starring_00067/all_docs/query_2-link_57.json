        "text": "1. ( never seen before pictures of SRK n family added at the end of the post) Put your comments and ratings guys!!!!) Khan was born in 1965 to Muslim parents of Pathan descent in New Delhi, India. His father, Taj Mohammed Khan, was an Indian independence activist from Peshawar, British India. According to Khan, his paternal grandfather was originally from Afghanistan. His mother, Lateef Fatima, was the adopted daughter of Major General Shah Nawaz Khan of the Janjua Rajput clan, who served as a General in the Indian National Army of Subash Chandra Bose. Khan’s father came to New Delhi from Qissa Khawani Bazaar in Peshawar before the partition of India,while his mother’s family came from Rawalpindi, British India. Khan has an elder sister named Shehnaz. SRK's parents Growing up in Rajendra Nagar neighbourhood, Khan attended St. Columba’s School where he was accomplished in sports, drama, and academics. He won the Sword of Honour, an annual award given to the student who best represents the spirit of the school. Khan later attended theHansraj College (1985–1988) and earned his Bachelors degree in Economics (honors). Though he pursued a Masters Degree in Mass Communications at Jamia Millia Islamia, he later opted out to make his career in Bollywood.\n\n2. After the death of his parents, Khan moved to Mumbai in 1991.In that same year, before any of his films were released, he married Gauri Chibber, a Hindu, in a traditional Hindu wedding ceremony on 25 October 1991. They have two children, son Aryan (b. 1997) and daughter Suhana (b. 2000). According to Khan, while he strongly believes in Allah, he also values his wife’s religion. At home, his children follow both religions, with theQur’an being situated next to the Hindu gods.\n\n3. In 2005, Nasreen Munni Kabir produced a two-part documentary on Khan, titled The Inner and Outer World of Shah Rukh Khan. Featuring his 2004 Temptations concert tour, the film contrasted Khan’s inner world of family and daily life with the outer world of his work. The book Still Reading Khan, which details his family life, was released in 2006. Another book byAnupama Chopra, “King of Bollywood: Shahrukh Khan and the seductive world of Indian cinema”, was released in 2007. This book described the world of Bollywood through Khan’s life. Khan has been awarded several honours which includes the Padma Shri, India’s fourth highest civilian award from the Government of India in 2005. In April 2007, a life-size wax statue of Khan was installed at the Madame Tussauds Wax Museum, London. Another statue was installed at the Musée Grévin in Paris, the same year. During the same year, he was accorded the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (Order of the Arts and Literature) award by the French government for his “exceptional career”. In October 2008, Khan was conferred the Darjah Mulia Seri Melaka which carries the honorific Datuk (in similar fashion to “Sir” in British knighthood), by the Yang di-Pertua Negeri Tun Mohd Khalil Yaakob, the head of state of Malacca in Malaysia. Khan was honoured for “promoting tourism in Malacca” by filming One Two Ka Four there in 2001. Some were critical of this decision. He was also honoured with an honorary doctorate in arts and culture from Britain’s University of Bedfordshire in 2009. Khan studied acting under celebrated Theatre Director Barry John at Delhi’s Theatre Action Group (TAG). In 2007, John commented thus on his former pupil that, “The credit for the phenomenally successful development and management of Shahrukh’s career goes to the superstar himself.” Khan made his acting debut in 1988 when he appeared in the television series, Fauji, playing the role of Commando Abhimanyu Rai.He went on to appear in several other television serials, most notably in the 1989 serial, Aziz Mirza’s Circus, which depicted the life of circus performers.The same year, Khan also had a minor role in the made-for-television English-language film, In Which Annie Gives it Those Ones, which was based on life at Delhi University and was written by Arundhati Roy.\n\n5.

He was seen playing with his children Aryan and Suhana and enjoying the fireworks with them. Shah Rukh Khan says that he wouldn’t mind ‘slowing down a bit’ after his 40th birthday!\n\n21. Early life and background [24][25] Khan was born on 2 November 1965 to Muslim parents in New Delhi, India. His father, Taj Mohammed Khan, a Pathan, was anIndian independence activist from Peshawar, British India. According [26] to Khan, his paternal grandfather was originally fromAfghanistan. His mother, Lateef Fatima, was the adopted daughter of Major General Shah Nawaz Khan of the Janjua Rajput clan, who served in [27] the Indian National Army. Khan's father came to New Delhi from Qissa Khawani Bazaar in Peshawar [28] before thepartition of India, Regarding his origins, he described himself on Twitter as [29] \"half hyderabadi (mom) half Pathan (Dad) some kashmiri(grandmom)\" His father died from cancer [30][31] when Khan was 15 years old, and his mother died in 1990 after prolonged illness. Khan was very attached to his parents as a child and describes their early deaths as a turning point in his life and as his biggest motivation for hard work. He explained that his ideology in life is \"... to make movies so damn bloody big...that my parents somewhere sit down on a star and from there also can look at their son and say 'I can see his movies from here better than I can see the Wall of China or anything. We see his [32] [33] movies covering the face of this earth'.\" Khan has an elder sister named Shehnaz. [34] Growing up in Rajendra Nagar neighbourhood of Delhi, Khan attended St. Columba's School where he was accomplished in sports, drama, and academics. He won the Sword of Honour, an annual award given to the student who best represents the spirit of the school. Khan later attended the Hansraj College (1985–1988) and earned his Bachelors degree in Economics. When Hansraj College celebrated its 50th anniversary, it gave away 17 shields to its alumni who had excelled in their lives and professions. Khan was one of them. Though he pursued a Masters Degree in Mass Communications at Jamia Millia [35] Islamia, he later opted out to pursue a career inBollywood. He also attended the National School of [36] Drama in Delhi. [37] After the death of his mother, Khan moved to Mumbai in 1991. He married Gauri Chibber, a Hindu, in a [30] traditional Hindu weddingceremony on 25 October 1991. They have two children, son Aryan (b. 1997) and daughter Suhana (b. 2000). According to Khan, while he strongly believes in Islam, he also values his wife's religion. At home, his children follow both religions, with the Qur'an being situated next to [38] the Hindu deities. Acting career See also: Shahrukh Khan filmography 1988–92: Early work and breakthrough Khan studied acting under the mentorship of theatre director Barry John at Delhi's \"Theatre Action Group\" [39] (TAG). Khan's first starring role was in Lekh Tandon's television series Dil Dariya, but due to production delays, the 1988 television series, Fauji was his television debut. He played the leading role of [37][40] Commando Abhimanyu Rai in the critically acclaimed show, which earned him mass recognition. He [41] went on to appear in Aziz Mirza's Circus (1989) and played a minor role in the made-for- television English-language film, In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones (1989). His appearance in these [42] teleserials, led critics to compare his acting style with that of film actor Dilip Kumar. In 1991, Khan shifted base to Mumbai and received his first film offer with Hema Malini's directorial debut Dil Aashna [37] Hai. However, due to production delays, his second film, Deewana (1992), alongside Rishi [36][43] Kapoor and Divya Bhartireleased first. The film became a box office hit, and launched his career in\n\n22. [44] Bollywood. Despite portraying a supporting character in the film, he won a Filmfare Best Male Debut Award, the following year. He subsequently featured in Mani Kaul's adaptation of Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Idiot, Idiot. Originally made for television, the film eventually received a theatrical release and debuted at the New York Film [45] Festival on 8 October 1992. Later that year, he played the titular character in the comedy, Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman, which was his first of many collaborations with actress Juhi Chawla. The film proved to [46] be a box office hit. He went on to star in Ketan Mehta's Maya Memsaab, an adaptation of Gustave Flaubert's novelMadame Bovary. Upon release, the film generated controversy in India due to Khan's [47] appearance in an \"explicit\" sex scene with co-starDeepa Sahi. 1993–97: Critical and commercial success In 1993, Khan garnered appreciation for portraying negative roles, that of an obsessive lover and a [48] murderer, respectively, in the box office hits, Darr and Baazigar. The \"Encyclopedia of Hindi Cinema\" analyzed that \"he defied the image of the conventional hero in both these films and created his own [49] version of the revisionist hero.\" Darr marked the first of many collaborations of Khan with film- maker Yash Chopra and his banner Yash Raj Films. Khan's stammering in the film and the usage of the [50] phrase, \"I love you, Kkkiran,\" were popular with the audiences. His other release, Baazigar, in which he played an ambiguous avenger who murders his girlfriend, \"shocked the Indian audiences\" with an [51] unexpected violation of the standard Bollywood formula. His performance in Baazigar won him his first Filmfare Best Actor Award. The same year, Khan played the role of a love-struck musician in Kundan Shah's dramedy Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa, a performance that earned him a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Performance. In a retrospective review by Rediff, Sukanya Verma called it Khan's best performance and added, \"He was [52] spontaneous, vulnerable, boyish, mischievous and acting straight from the heart.\" Khan, himself, [53] considers this film to the best film that he has acted in. In 1994, Khan once again played an obsessive lover in Anjaam, co-starringMadhuri Dixit. Though the film was a commercial failiure, Khan's performance [54] earned him the Filmfare Best Villain Award. Khan, holding a painting of his character Raj Malhotra from Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge(1995) that was gifted to him during an appearance on a TV show. In 1995, Khan starred in two box-office blockbusters. His first release was Rakesh Roshan's melodramatic thriller Karan Arjun, in which Khan was a part of an ensemble cast that included Salman Khan, Kajol, Mamta Kulkarni, Raakhee and Amrish Puri. The film, which dealt with the concept [55] of reincarnation, became the second-highest grossing film of the year in India. He followed it with Aditya Chopra's directorial debut, the romance Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. A major critical and\n\n23. [56] commercial success, the film became the year's top-grossing production in India and abroad. The film was declared an \"all time blockbuster\"; it remains the longest-running film in the history of Indian [57] [58] cinema and as of 2011, it is still playing at the Maratha Mandir theatre in Mumbai. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge has grossed over 1.2 billion worldwide. The film won ten Filmfare Awards, and Khan's performance as a young NRI who falls for Kajol's character while on a trip across Europe won him critical acclaim and his second Best Actor Award at the Filmfare. In 2005,Indiatimes Movies ranked the film [59] amongst the 25 Must See Bollywood Films, citing it as a \"trendsetter of sorts\". Raja Sen reviewed, \"Khan gives a fabulous performance, redefining the lover for the 1990s with great panache. He's cool and flippant, but sincere enough to appeal to the junta [audience]. The performance itself is, like the best in [60] the business, played well enough to come across as effortless, as non-acting. \" 1996 proved to be a disappointing year for Khan, as he appeared in two critical and commercial failiures, [61] Praveen Nischol's English Babu Desi Mem and Mahesh Bhatt' Chaahat However, in 1997, his starring role in Subhash Ghai's social drama Pardes earned him commercial success. The film, which also featured Mahima Chaudhry and Apurva Agnihotri, saw him portray the role of Arjun, a musician facing a moral dilemma. His performance earned him a nomination for the Best Actor at the Filmfare Award ceremony. He then featured in Aziz Mirza's romantic comedy, Yes Boss, opposite Juhi Chawla. Upon [62] release, the film performed moderately well at the box-office. His final release of the year was Yash Chopra's blockbuster musical romanance, Dil to Pagal Hai. The project, also featuring Madhuri Dixit and Karishma Kapoor, marked his second collaboration with the filmmaker. Khan essayed the role of Rahul, a stage director who falls in love with one of his new actresses, played by Dixit. The film as well as [62] his performance met with critical appreciation; he won his third Best Actor Award at the Filmfare. 1998–2002: International recognition In 1998, Khan appeared in three films.

It garnered him another nomination for the Filmfare Best Actor Award. Khan termed Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham as \"a turning [81] point in his career\".

He explained that during his break, he \"just enjoyed the feeling of being sad\". Khan also starred alongside Madhuri Dixit andSalman Khan in the family-drama Hum Tumhare Hain [88] Sanam.

He flew to Lucknow a week later for a [89] series of stage shows which led to further aggravation of his condition. By the time he returned to [89] Mumbai, Khan was experiencing severe pain. He was subsequently diagnosed with aprolapsed [89] disc between vertebrae six and seven. Khan is one of the few celebrities worldwide to have had the [90] problem. Hoping to avoid surgery in a bid to not delay his pending projects, and based on his former experience with a failed knee surgery three years earlier, Khan tried multiple alternative therapies [89] from homoeopathy to Reiki but nothing offered a permanent solution. He eventually shot Devdas (2002) and Chalte Chalte (2003) in acute pain and continued with the shoot for Kal Ho Naa [89][91] Ho (2003) until the day he left for London. He reached the point where he had doctors and [91] ambulances on standby on the sets. [89][92] By the beginning of 2003, Khan's condition severely worsened. The slipped disc was eventually [92] touching his nerves which put pressure on his legs and neck. It also presented the risk of paralysis of his arms. In February, Khan was told by doctors that he had to undergo an urgent Anterior Cervical [90][92] Discectomy. The main concern was the possibility of irreparable nerve damage during surgery which [93] would have left him with a permanent weak left side. During his acceptance speech for the Filmfare Best Actor award he received for his performance in Devdas (2002), Khan stated that emotionally he was a bit shaken as he was going in for a surgery that was described by him as a ―not a very good thing to go [94] in for. ‖ The surgery took place on 24 February in Wellington Hospital, London and lasted for one hour [89] – a titanium disc was inserted in his spine and he was discharged after two days. Khan faced several post-operative problems including hoarseness, weakness, pain and high risk of [89][90] infection. In an interview with Rediff four months after the surgery, he said \"I am supposed to be on the road to recovery. For a year, I have to take things easy. I have my good and bad moments. Mornings aren't good. Till about 2 pm, I feel a lot of pain. When I bend down or play with my kids, I get some pain in [91] the neck (...) For now I have to go to London every month for a checkup. \" He resumed shooting Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003) and Main Hoon Na (2004) in June of the same year however, the songs sequences in [95] those films had to be postponed to late October. The injury resulted in Khan cutting down noticeably on [91] work and reducing his number of films per year. 2003–10: Stardom and critical acclaim In 2003, Khan produced and starred in Aziz Mirza's, Chalte Chalte, a romance dealing with the troubles faced by a married couple, opposite Rani Mukerji.

Several film critics consider Khan's performance in the film [10] to be his best till date. Critic Jitesh Pillai analyzed, \"Ultimately your heart leaps out to the magical Shah Rukh Khan, who unarguably gives his career's finest performance.

Filmfare included his performance in the 2010 [104] issue of the \"Top 80 Iconic Performances\".

His performance was [109] extensively compared to that of Amitabh Bachchan, the actor in the original. Taran Adarsh noted that Khan \"does very well as Don. He enacts the evil character with flourish. But he fails to carry off the other [109] role [Vijay] with conviction. It looks made up, it doesn't come natural to him at all.\" While Derek Elley of Variety argued that \"it's hard to accept him (Khan) as the title character\" and that \"Khan is far more [110] convincing as Vijay, playing up to his rom-com fanbase with plenty of boyish humor.\" The film became [108] the fifth-highest grossing film of the year in India and the highest grossing film of the year in the [80] overseas market. It grossed a total of 1.04 billion worldwide. Both Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna and Don earned him Best Actor nominations at the Filmfare, while the latter earned him a Best Actor nomination at the Asian Film Awards.

Additionally, he was a hockey player during his college days and aspired to be a professional hockey player before he suffered a back [112] injury. Khan noted that while this background helped him during the filming, he also felt that the experience of playing again after a long time was \"very difficult and different\". Khan tore a hamstring three [113][114] days before the filming was over. Chak De!India was a major critical and commercial success in [115] [80] India and abroad. Earning over 1.03 billion worldwide, Chak De! India became the third-highest grossing film of 2007 in India and won Khan yet another Filmfare Award for Best Actor. Rajeev Masandfrom CNN-IBN wrote about his performance, \"For the first time since Swades, Shah Rukh plays a role without any of his typical trappings, without any of his trademark quirks. He sinks his teeth into the part of the determined coach and comes up with such a terrific performance. He's hopeful at times and despondent at others, he's humorous at times, and stern at others. He plays Kabir Khan like a real flesh- [116] and-blood human being. \" Filmfare also included his performance in the 2010 issue of the \"Top 80 [11] Iconic Performances\". In the same year, Khan starred in Farah Khan's second film, Om Shanti Om alongside Deepika Padukone, Shreyas Talpade and Arjun Rampal.

The film received mixed reviews from film critics, but was declared a [119] blockbuster at the box-office. His performance was appreciated by critics, with Rachel Saltz of The New York Times writing, \"The Surinder/Raj dual role seems tailor-made (probably was) for Mr. Khan, who [120] gets to show off his twin talents: he suffers nobly and entertains with panache. \" It earned him yet another nomination for Best Actor at the Filmfare ceremony. In December of the same year, Khan suffered a serious shoulder injury while filming for a cameo role in Mudassar Aziz's Dulha Mil Gaya.

Khan spent several months researching by reading books, watching videos and talking to people affected with [125] the disorder in an effort to portray the character of Rizwan Khan. In an interview with Hindustan Times he said, \"Whenever you're dealing with a disorder or a near atypical situation, the first thought is that the sort of parameters you have to set that in no which way you are derogatory or deriding the disorder. The second part is you have to come as close to reality in depicting that characterization and so [126] one had to study a lot and one does get worried\" Upon release, My Name is Khan received positive reviews from critics and became the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all-time in the overseas market. Khan's performance in the film was appreciated by most critics with Jay Wesissberg from Variety reviewing, \"Khan uses the mannerisms associated with Asperger's – averted eyes, springy steps, stuttered repetitions of memorized texts – yet captures the personality beneath the condition in a [127] standout performance sure to receive the Autism Society's gold seal of approval. \" My Name is Khan fetched Khan his eighth Filmfare Award for Best Actor, thereby sharing the record with actor Dilip Kumar. 2011–present: Continuing other ventures\n\n29.

His Aiyyo-speaking Shekhar Subramaniam is caricaturish but charming, while as G.One, he gives even his robotic video-game character a charismatic edge.\" and DNA India added: \"Khan is in his element and endearing as superhero G.One, but annoyingly over the top as [134][135] video game creator Shekhar\".
