        "text": "Satyendra Kapoor, born in 1931, is celebrated for his significant contributions to Indian cinema. Hailing from Hardoi in Uttar Pradesh, he carved an indelible mark on Bollywood with his exceptional acting prowess. His cinematic journey spanned over four decades, beginning in the early 1950s and continuing till the late 1990s. Within this period, Kapoor embraced a wide array of roles, both as a protagonist and in supporting roles, showcasing his versatility as an artist. Kapoor's performances are remembered for their deep emotional resonance and nuanced portrayal of the human condition. He was particularly adept at portraying characters that were relatable and could easily strike a chord with the audience. Some of his most iconic roles include Ramlal in the film Sholay (1975) and Hariram Naai in Deewar (1975). These films not only achieved commercial success but also elevated Kapoor's status as a formidable actor in Indian cinema. Despite his fame, Kapoor maintained a low profile, letting his work speak for itself. He was known for his humility and dedication to his craft. His contribution to Indian cinema was recognized when he was conferred with the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke Award posthumously in 2007. Satyendra Kapoor's legacy continues to inspire generations of actors, making him a true stalwart of Indian cinema.\n\nAamir Khan, born on March 14, 1965, is an esteemed actor and filmmaker from India with an illustrious career spanning over four decades. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential and successful actors in the history of Indian cinema. His journey in the glitzy world of Bollywood began in 1973 as a child artist in the film Yaadon Ki Baaraat, but it was his leading role in Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak in 1988 that catapulted him to nationwide fame. Khan's contribution to the Indian film industry is not confined to acting alone. He made his directorial debut with Taare Zameen Par in 2007, a movie which earned him the National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare. Beyond his directorial ventures, Khan co-founded the production company, Aamir Khan Productions, which has produced several critically acclaimed movies, including Lagaan (2001) and Dangal (2016). Both films became international hits, with Lagaan earning a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Off-screen, Khan is recognized for his social activism and philanthropy. He hosted and produced the television talk show Satyamev Jayate, which discussed social issues in India, raising awareness and sparking national debates. His commitment to social causes fetched him the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) ambassadorship for South Asia, further underlining his status as a national icon. Despite being one of the biggest celebrities in India, Aamir Khan manages to maintain a low-profile lifestyle, thereby endearing himself to millions of fans worldwide."
