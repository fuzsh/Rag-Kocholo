        "text": "A fortnight ago when I met the lovely Nimrat Kaur who gave me a very articulate interview for this column, she told me she is the biggest Shah Rukh Khan interview fan. She used to collect his interviews when she was in school.\n\nMany of my journalist friends agree that he always gives great interviews. Even if he makes them wait.\n\nAs I’m waiting at the Red Chillies office, his publicist Mandvi Sharma tells me, “Time for him is a very different concept. For us, it is about being on time. For him, it’s always about the time he spends with people. When he’s late, he always makes up for it by spending extra time and giving them what they want and more.”\n\nIt’s not that much of a wait for me this evening as he shows up soon enough. I ask him to show me the Happy New Year trailer and he does, asking me not to tweet about it until Thursday. The trailer has a slick Oceans vibe but done with Farah Khan’s sense of colour, style, choreography and madness.\n\nQ: So Happy New Year is a heist film?\n\nA: “It’s part heist, part Bollywood film. It’s high time we feel proud of the genre we’ve been making for many, many years. Happy New Year is a commercial happy go lucky entertainer. It’s the ultimate Bollywood film. Farah wanted to make this before Om Shanti Om when she pitched a story of five young boys and one grown up person who want to go to the US and get into a dance competition. We dropped it then and got into Om Shanti Om. So I asked her to revive it when we met again.”\n\nQ: So this could this be part of a trilogy of pop culture celebration that started with Main Hoon Na?\n\nA: “Farah is a fun filmmaker and you can’t take that away from her. She is one of the finest ones I have worked with. With every film you become better. I believe that the first three films you have in your heart are always your best films. She has never told me any another story apart from these three ever in the 20 years I’ve known her.”\n\nQ: I met Nimrat Kaur a fortnight ago and she told me she used to keep clippings for your interviews when she was in school. My journalist friends say you are among the best interviews they have done. Do you prep for them?\n\nA: “Ninety per cent of the time, the interviews are about the film I am participating in. And when I’m doing a film, I believe in the 140-150 days of work that I have done. I believe in what I do. I believe in that thought. However random, strange, new, fantastic, good, bad or ugly it may be. That’s why I am part of it. Belief makes you articulate. Half the things people ask me are related to what I’m doing or what I felt or what I am doing next. Or how has it been? When you believe in something, there is no way you can be inarticulate about it.\n\nBut I know this. This is what I’ve lived for the last 200 days. Every year takes a year of my life. I’m 48 now. I’ve done 55 films. Somewhere 55, 40 or 30 years of my life have been taken away. I’m happy that whatever I have done, I’ve done from a position of choice. Being in a position of choice is stardom. Mujhe yeh nahin karna, mujhe yeh karna hai.” (I don’t want to do THIS, I want to do THIS)\n\n“Strangely, an actors life and the beliefs change according to what he or she has become for that while. So if I’m doing Asoka, I’m reading about it… And that changes you as a person. Without realizing, you start living like that person. I don’t prep for it, I have no idea of when I have interviews. I don’t read what I have said. I see it. OK, it’s there. I appreciate how it’s written but I don’t read what I’ve said because I’ve said it. I’ve believed it. And I always believe I sound more articulate than I am because of the person writing it. If I were to write what I said, I don’t know where it will go. Because I’m contradictory, there are two people in me all the time. One is what the film’s belief is and one what I personally believe in. It keeps changing depending on the person also. All those who have told you I’m articulate have probably written it more articulately than I’ve sounded. Honest truth.”\n\nQ: This is my fourth interview with you in ten years. I can vouch for the rest. You have always given great interviews.\n\nA: “Well, a lot of people have an interview face. They have an interview persona. I have a party persona. I have a house persona. But I don’t have an interview persona. I am not an actor or a star when I’m doing it. I remember a joke father used to tell me about this guy, Oscar Wilde or some famous person… who always refused interviews and finally one day, one guy got an interview. He was sitting waiting for the interview and there was a door… And the gentleman just walked naked, stood, turned around naked and left. He said: I can’t give you a more internal view of myself. My logic is that. An interview means that. An internal view. So I’m not going to give you a star view. On stage when I’m performing live in front of an audience I will give you a star view.\n\nSo I don’t have an interview face. I don’t have an interview prep. I say what I feel now. So it may change. Two days later, I may feel differently… and I have no issues.\n\nWhen people tell me I’m contradicting myself, yeah, it’s fine. So? I’m contradictory. They say you should have just one thought. No, I have 17 thoughts. So I may put them all in the same interview. So you liked white? Yeah, but you wear black. Yeah. I might like white and wear black, but how does that make me… am I schizophrenic? No. Or I am. It’s all right.”\n\nQ: Do you ever feel trapped in a mould you have created every time you have to spread your arms… almost in every other film?\n\nA: “I work a lot in popular cinema. So there are parameters for that. So within those parameters, you are in a mould. You play the hero type. I always have the choice to break it when I feel like and go do a Chak De or a Swades or a My Name is Khan or a Paheli or a Asoka.\n\nAt least in the last five years, I’ve not gone to work because I have to. I’ve never gone to work because I need the money. I’ve never gone to work because I’m bossed around. I’ve never gone to work because there is nothing else for me to do. There is no other reason for me to work but the fact that this is really fine.\n\nAnd every film takes a life of its own beyond the pages that are written.\n\nWhen somebody from the market says, there has to be X amount of this in the film, we do that. Because it’s a populist world, it’s a populist market, it’s populist cinema. But I also say “Let’s try to change that. Or let’s not do that because there are so many, say romantic songs, like that.” So the change might be small, just a little beyond the parameters of commercial cinema but that makes it exciting.”\n\nQ: How do you react when critics say Shah Rukh Khan is Shah Rukh Khan in every film?\n\nA: “I downplay my acting prowess. I don’t take myself seriously but that does not mean I’m not a serious actor. I say I have five expressions… because I like to play it down.\n\nI’ve done a lot of acting that I’m so proud and arrogant about it. I’m one of the few actors to have educated myself in theatre. I’ve done street theatre, I’ve done impromptu, I’ve done commercials, I’ve done plays for kids, I’ve done a Punjabi serial, I’ve done TV shows, I’ve done advertising and I’ve done cinema. I’ve risen in the ranks. And you don’t rise in the ranks over 25 years without knowing your shit. But it’s very boring to talk about how Biriyani is made. And it’s nicer to taste it. And that’s what I do. “\n\nQ: People say the same about Rajinikanth too but do you need to act is the question.\n\nA: “Rajinikanth is a superstar. I am not a superstar. I need to work, I need to reinvent, not just myself even the cinema around me because I can control that.\n\nSo when someone asks me: Can you do a comedy? The last one I did was Baadshah. So I thought I’ll do a retarded comedy and do it in the mould people like. I didn’t think I’m an actor of that genre. Let me pull all the reserves I have and let me get into that world of Chennai Express.\n\nBefore that it was Jab Tak Hain Jaan, which had to be done in a certain poetic style. To convince people that such a man exists. It is a love story… a triangle between God, a woman and a man. Of course, the arms will rise because it is popular cinema. Of course, the romance will still happen because it is popular cinema.\n\nSo the mould I try to attach myself is always different in popular cinema. I try to change it a little, challenge it…\n\nTo be honest, Swades, Chak De, Ashoka, Paheli… easiest films to make. Because being real, being honest is easy. Just sitting there and depending on the line, the words, your eyes and just the story is much easier than believing in a dream which is unrealistic and unachievable. I am going to mess with God. I will fly with electricity. I will win the World Dance Championship.\n\nIt is a huge leap of faith for an actor to believe he can pull these things off.\n\nAs an actor, put me in a real space and 80 per cent of your job is done. You put me in a hockey field and I am a coach. You put me in a space in the world your film is set in and I don’t have to do anything. But unreal characters are totally dependent on your dream and your belief in them.\n\nAutism is a difficult thing to do but you know that space. You’ve met people like that. Devdas was easy to play because all men are like that.\n\nLarger than life is difficult to play because there is no limit to largeness. How large can you make it? Can I catch you by the scruff of your neck and then pull you into the screen into the most unbelievable world?”\n\nQ: Like veteran French screenwriter Jean Claude Carriere says: Fiction sometimes goes deeper into the truth than fact.\n\nA: “Fiction is wanting to achieve your most deep-rooted desires.\n\nI want to fly. You can’t. But it’s a desire. It’s amazing fulfillment. Fiction is fulfilling what most people desire. Reality is not what you want to do. It happens.”\n\nQ: Would you say that’s why Dilwaale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge is still playing at Maratha Mandir, in its 20th year… because manufacturing consent of parents for their love story was wish fulfillment of a desire of the younger generation?\n\nA: “I’ve seen only two things people give for anything that works or doesn’t work – reasons and excuses. When it’s successful, I’ve seen people give reasons and make them their own. When it doesn’t, they give excuses. I have no idea, yaar.”\n\nQ: I’m sure you have had 20 years to think about why that film resonates so much.\n\nA: “Maybe because everybody is waiting for a boy like that. And there is no boy like that. He is fun, naughty, sweet, caring, respectful to parents and he makes everything alright. You are waiting for Raj. I have had a girl tell me she married Ramesh because he reminded her of Raj. Somewhere down, we created an epitome of the perfect boy.”\n\nQ: Is 300 crores the new benchmark for films to surpass where success is measured through box office collections?\n\nA: “Chennai Express was the first film to do 200 crores. Numbers can always be surpassed. Dreams are fluid. I want my film to do well so that I can make a bigger film. If Happy New Year does well, maybe I will go mad and make Ra. One 2. I want to get the superhero genre right.”\n\nQ: How do you think you have changed over the last 25 years, temperament wise?\n\nA: “I have become more reclusive. I like spending time with me more than power parties. The world is growing bigger, people always want to talk to you. You see flashbulbs and hear voices all the time. More on Twitter. There’s just too much light in my face. I still want to do as much work but I would like to close the door a little more often. I have found myself entertaining people beyond the call of duty. Sometimes just to survive, sometimes for friends…but after 25 years I’ve done everything. There is no more reason to do things unless I am happy. When people ask me come here, there, to see their film, mujhe nahin dekhna hai, yaar (I don’t want to)… I just used to make films. I want to keep it that simple. I don’t want any other knowledge. I used to walk down to my house during King Uncle. I walked to Mehboob Studios at 6.30 a.m and when I walked back at 2 p.m, people stopped to talk to me… Deewana had become a big hit. I never saw the film. I didn’t even know when I became a star.”\n\nQ: Aren’t people just the same and hence, all stories the same too, at some level?\n\nA: “There are only five stories and the sameness has been there since time immemorial. All cars are the same. They have four wheels. It’s the engine that determines if it’s a Mercedes or a Jaguar. Just a general desire: If I could read your thoughts when presented differently becomes an Inception. Iron Man, Spider-man, all superhero stories are the same but Spider-man got a reboot four years after a reboot. There are some stories you may not be able to tell today… Like a man waiting for a letter, because today everyone has phones but The Lunchbox, I hear, made even that work. Why should the difference matter to anyone?”\n\nQ: Now that you have admitted all stories are same, how different is Happy New Year?\n\nA: “It is the quintessential Bollywood film. But nobody else tells the story like Farah. As a producer I can tell you, no film has been mounted like this as a cinematic experience. Come see it as an event. But beyond all this, I have never made a film without a core. The core values of the film may get overshadowed sometimes in the telling but the point of Happy New Year is that God gives an opportunity to every loser once in a lifetime. Nobody celebrates losers. We have maybe 40-50 icons in the world of 8 billion. The rest of them are not winners. We are always celebrating the minority – a superhero, beautiful people, stars. Not everybody who wins is happy. Look at Robin Williams. I am not cynical. I want to say let’s celebrate losers and tell them that God is hope, it’s a belief… the bigger giver of hope. Every story needs to fulfil an inner desire of yours. Just because we are losers, we are not sad or depressed…”\n\nQ: So does you see yourself as a winner or a loser?\n\nA: “I’m basically a loser. I always want to make the next one. I’m satisfied because I have belief but I am also greedy. What can I do in the next one. If I’m not been able to entertain… it’s my thing in life. Everybody who comes to me, whether it is a meeting, or a film… everybody comes to me with a desire, will he entertain? I’m the performer, entertainer, the jester, you’ve come with the hope of being entertained. If I break that, that’s disturbing.”\n\nQ: That’s why you go beyond the call of duty entertaining people.\n\nA: “I hope they go back thinking that I have entertained them… that’s winning to me but that doesn’t last more than 4-5 days. Nothing lasts for posterity. Nobody remembers anything, people don’t remember parents. When Pyaasa released, they panned it.\n\nYou don’t make anything for posterity. Your time in space is where you are. Nothing else exists. I don’t have any nostalgia. I’m not 75 and when I’m 75 why would I watch my film. Celluloid is amazing but it’s not life lasting.\n\n(pause)\n\nHow long have you been making films?\n\nQ: “Fifteen years.”\n\nA: “Why?”\n\nQ: “Because I want to make them.”\n\nA: “Why don’t you for a change make films for others, anyone but you?”\n\nQ: “Why”\n\nA: “For the first six years of my career, I did what I wanted to do. I told Hema Malini I am a serious theatre actor and I am not going to be running around trees. I refused loverboy roles for six years. So finally when Aditya Chopra pitched DDLJ, it seemed different TO me. I hadn’t done something like that. People thought I was going to kill her off. I liked that I would defy expectations. So I did it. I was 32 when I was pretending to be in college with a chain around my neck that said COOL. I felt ridiculous but I did it. But the point is you never know what you can become until you start doing things for others.”\n\nThis interview originally appeared in two parts in The Hindu. Part 1: I have become more reclusive | Part 2: Bombay Encounters: The Reluctant Loverboy\n\nTo understand the brilliance of Jigarthanda in totality, you need to know a little bit about how films are made and distributed in Tamil Nadu. And the kind of films that are usually made and how they are produced. You need to also understand where Karthik Subbaraj comes from. Literally.\n\nHence this post after the film has been unanimously raved about. The only bit of criticism the film has faced is for changing genres halfway – something the film justifies by the end so much that when you see the film a second time, it seems like the only logical way to finish that story.\n\nNow, the context.\n\nThe Tamil film industry produces over 200 films a year. About 30-40 per cent of them don’t even release/ get shelved even after completion. Because very few investors are willing to spend on marketing and distribution. Very rarely do arthouse films without violence ever see the light of day. In other words, in the absence of stars, only violence sells.\n\nFilm distribution happens through political clout. If you are in power, you get to push your films wherever you want, you can get as many screens as you want. When you are not in power, you have to fight even to get an entertainment tax exemption. A change in government is enough to turn the powerful into underdogs.\n\nDistribution happens through minimum guarantee where producers make distributors buy the film for a price that minimizes their risk. And films with stars fetch high MGs. Films without stars don’t. Hence, there is a need to arm-twist the distributors to push content without stars. And those in power or those close to the party in power find it easy to do this. You can call it monopoly if you want to use a euphemism.\n\nOrganised crime and violence is still prevalent in many pockets of Tamil Nadu and Madurai is considered to be the hub and breeding grounds for the cold at heart (the title is named after a drink – a South Indian variant of the Falooda that literally means Cold Heart), a fact many films have milked for violence and bloodshed.\n\nPost Paruthiveeran and Subramaniapuram and endless rehashes of violent films, young filmmakers have had to pick one of the two feasible option. One, get a star and make a film that glorifies his image. Or Two, make an ultraviolent gangster film where the script is the hero.\n\nThanks to the reality show Nalaya Iyakkunar (translated to Tomorrow’s Directors), an exciting new bunch of filmmakers came to the limelight with some truly different films. The winner of the show Nalan Kumarasamy made Soodhu Kavvum while Karthik Subbaraj who finished second got a new age producer to back Pizza, a smaller film he wrote AFTER Jigarthanda seemed like an expensive film to make for a debutant director with a new producer.\n\nJigarthanda hence begins with that finale of the reality show where Karthik (a young filmmaker based on the filmmaker himself) loses the final. Incidentally, Nalan Kumarasamy the guy who beat him puts in a cameo as a finalist in the film to establish the meta-narrative right in the first few minutes during the opening credits.\n\nJigarthanda is about two guys from two different worlds. They speak two different languages.\n\nThe hero is a filmmaker who is in the business of manufacturing emotions that go beyond language – hence, the film employs gibberish to make this point. Characters speak gibberish much before a sequence when an acting coach tells his trainees how the spoken word is not important, only the theatrics of it matter in this art. Because it’s a visual medium. Even a huge part of the key dialogue and score towards the end is in gibberish as the film references itself.\n\nThe villain is a gangster who is in the business of manufacturing violence, of course and as he says: Nothing helps more than adi-othai (maar-dhaad). Violence is the language he speaks.\n\nWithout any spoilers, suffice to say that Jigarthanda is the film where these two languages meet. As Shilpa Rathnam puts it so eloquently, Jigarthanda is a world where art imitates crime and crime imitates art.\n\nThe two worlds have so much in common after all – action, shooting, cutting – one creates and the other destroys. One brings pain and the other is the balm.\n\nTo make a film on the state of the art and the nexus between cinema and crime in Tamil Nadu, from the inside and saying it as it is, requires some amount of balls. And Karthik Subbaraj has done it without judgment. At no point does he make the artist good and the gangster bad and many reviews have already pointed out the evil in the hero and the goodness in the villain.\n\nIt is never black and white. Both art and crime have great power to influence people and each other. Once you’ve tasted blood, you always want more.\n\nWhich is why the world of crime (the gangster film in the first half) needed to meet the world of cinema (the film about filmmaking in the second half). The crime story had already climaxed in the interval (we are yet to see a more riveting first half this year). And nothing could have taken the film higher down that path. Luckily for us and cinema, Karthik chose to change track. Though some may find this frustrating on first viewing, by the time the film reaches its superb climax, you understand the point that Karthik Subbaraj wants to make: What filmmaking has come down to from his part of the world.\n\nI have never seen a smarter use of the meta-narrative in recent times.\n\nJigarthanda is the most exciting film out of India this year, if not the best. It is racy, it is funny, it is violent, it has superb performances, it has a rocking score by Santhosh Narayanan (that I am buying off iTunes right away) and it celebrates and critiques cinema.\n\nWatch it before someone ruins the ending for you. And if someone tries to do that, it’s totally okay to kill the fucker.\n\nTo wait for English subtitles for a film that’s telling you how cinema is all about the emotion behind the “gibberish” is against the idea and the spirit of the film itself. You would be surprised at how much you understand just face-reading this film. Hats off to the actors – each one of them is terrific. Siddharth, full respect to let Simha steal his thunder. What a superb cast this is.\n\nGo watch. And watch it all over again.\n\nAbout six years ago around the same time, I met New York.\n\nIt was love at first sight.\n\nI had just the script for it.\n\nA conversation film that I had just written with Shilpa Rathnam simply because my friend Nischalakrishna Vittalanathan bought a Sony HVR V1U (He had spent a year discovering everything it can do and how to optimise it for shooting movies) and had insisted that I write something we can shoot quickly.\n\nThe pop culture references were mostly American since we had written it in English and it didn’t seem to work when we tried to localise it. (We’re still trying to do it, though!) Besides, this was a New year’s eve film in English. New York sounded like the perfect world for it.\n\nRaja Sen was one of the first people to read it, a month after we started writing it and asked me who I had in mind for the cast. I was planning to shoot with newcomers. He was on the opinion that this script has so much potential that I should consider casting someone from Bollywood. He put me in touch with an actress who loved the script enough to say she would do it.\n\nI had heard of Manu Narayan from Kaveri Valliappan, a choice strongly recommended by my best friend from school Murugan (they are both from Pittsburgh; Murugan had seen Manu perform in Andrew Lloyd Webber & A.R. Rahman’s Bombay Dreams in Broadway, New York). So New York it would be. We would shoot on New Year’s Eve. We would be there around Christmas and stay on for three weeks to wrap shoot. That was the plan.\n\nBut thanks to problems small filmmakers face with big stars, I ended up with just the first four minutes of the film. And I was going to leave New york, having spent the three lakhs more than the ten lakhs I had budgeted for the whole film – WITH NO FILM!\n\nJust some great memories. The Pizza at Artichoke. Hot Chocolate at Max Brenners. Experiencing snowfall for the first time in Queens… while shooting it. The madness at Times Square on New Years Eve… Getting so sloshed to keep ourselves warm and almost surviving the night. Ask Raja Sen for the story of that legendary night he remembers only from accounts of other people… Going to Red Bank, New Jersey to see where Kevin Smith shot Clerks on his birthday… Living in a suite at the New Yorker hotel (where we were supposed to shoot) for a week… Shooting an obscure music video with our actress that had nothing to do with the film because our film shoot was not going to happen.\n\nIn between these highs and lows, I thought about how they did it back in the day before outdoor shoots were not logistically possible. The fifties. And it dawned on me that if I could do the same, I could probably be able to shoot the whole film in India if I went all the way and embraced everything the fifties were about.\n\nSo in that one week I had left in New York, I decided to salvage the best out of that situation. I hired a helicopter, got all the aerial shots I needed from New York to halfway to Philadelphia. I rented a taxi halfway between New York and Philadelphia and shot all around New Hope. I shot every possible outdoor shot I needed. I sourced every prop I needed to stay true to the milieu. The radio announcements on December 31, the newspaper of that day, the hotel supplies… We even stole their menu.\n\nAll the outdoors could be projected outside the static car inside a studio… and it would work great in a black and white film. We hadn’t started off trying to make a black and white film but this seemed like the only way out. So we rewrote the film to make it sound more like the fifties. More mushy. More cheesy. We sourced the right kind of jazz music – from Ray Guntrip in the UK to Gregory Generet from New York to Manu Narayan’s bandmate Radovan Jovicevic to Chennai based Maitreya to do a cover of Strangers in the Night.\n\nI just need money to shoot. And to pay off the credit card and personal loan debts from the 13 lakhs I had already spent. To cut a long sob story short, it took me 18 months to get back on my feet and shoot again. With more personal loans and fresh credit card debt.\n\nThe actress who was to do the film wasn’t available anymore because of both health and date issues but this turned out to be a blessing in disguise because we found the incredibly talented Seema Rahmani… who I had messaged through Facebook after being impressed with her American accent in Loins of Punjab. She didn’t share her number. She texted back her email address and said she would call IF she liked the script.\n\nTwo days later, she did. She didn’t even want to talk money. It had connected to her at a very deep level. She called me every day to go over the lines until she came to Chennai three weeks later for the shoot and by the time she landed, she knew every single line of the script by heart.\n\nIt was a craziest of schedules. We put them up both at a service apartment for a month and even shot a few scenes there. We shot all of Seema in three days flat, all of Manu in two days and the five episodes in between the phone call in another four days. Including patchwork, we shot maybe ten days in all!\n\nWe had just finished edit and before we could figure out what to do, Megha Ramaswamy saw the film at Raja Sen’s place and recommended it to Galen Rosenthal of the South Asian International Film Festival, New York. It seemed like the place to premiere the film being the home of the film.\n\nWe also got a call from the Mumbai Film Festival. So we had back to back premieres in a week. Mumbai first and then, New York. Finally, AFTER the premiere, I was able to reshoot and replace a few shots from the first four minutes with Seema Rahmani walking down streets of New York (I had used the shots of the previous actress in silhouette for the premiere).\n\nManu’s Mom came for the premiere. She was moved to tears with the performance of her son. I would always cherish that night Manu got so emotional and said he found a brother in me. For life. I love that guy. For sticking with the project and believing in it. For years.\n\nAn American premiere was also the perfect excuse for me to go all the way to LA. I was hoping to meet my idol Cameron Crowe to give him a DVD of our film – because we had written it as that ten minute phone call from Elizabethtown coming to life. But that’s another story.\n\nWe then got invited to the Habitat Film Festival, Delhi and Shiladitya Bora, who was programming alternative content for PVR happened to see a poster of the film there that got his attention. He wrote to me asking for a DVD and offered to release it through his new banner Director’s Rare. That was the beginning of another great friendship.\n\nOn January 20, 2012, PVR launched its Director’s Rare banner with Good Night Good Morning. We sold 1500 tickets through 18 screens. It was a total disaster at the box office given. We hadn’t spent one rupee on marketing or publicity because I had already spent 30 lakhs on the film and was too broke to spend any more. I wrote an angry rant back then that got some people interested in the film and luckily for us, the reviews were good too.\n\nFull credit to Shiladitya Bora to keep the initiative going and Director’s Rare today has released about 60 films since Good Night Good Morning. He had opened up and created a niche market for films like these.\n\nOur share from PVR was Rs.99000. We got another Rs.25000 from Sathyam Cinemas from Chennai. Mela gave us Rs.50000 for an online release. And Enlighten sold 1000 DVDs that got us another Rs. 60000. So I had spent 30 lakh rupees and not even recovered three! We are still waiting for a decent deal for a TV premiere.\n\nI still have three more months of Good Night Good Morning debt left. I still need to pay my best friend Murugan $9000 dollars. I reminded him about it last week. He said even if you make it back, I want you to put it in the next film.\n\nThankfully, I don’t need to take on the extra baggage of producing anymore. And the market has opened up too.\n\nThere are some excellent modern producers and we found one such angel investor in Manish Mundra for X. But this is not about X.\n\nThis is about closure for Good Night Good Morning. A film about closure.\n\nSo guys and girls, the film is finally out there online. For posterity, hopefully. In all its HD detail.\n\nYou can buy it or rent it for Rs.25 on Google Play. It should be out on Amazon and iTunes soon. Maybe in twenty years or so, it would actually recover its cost.\n\nIf you want to help, do spread the word and pass this link to your friends. It’s not a bad film at all, I promise. There’s a link to the director’s commentary online as well that I recorded at home if you want to hear more about our adventures with low-budget filmmaking.\n\nThanks.\n\nAmar Chitra Katha. Comics we grew up with, with rich illustrations of stories of kings, wars and moral instructions, now in 3D, with the spirit of Rajinikanth. That should have been the peg. Kochadaiiyaan would have lived up to that promise.\n\nBecause that’s what it really is – technology that makes actors Amar, Chitra that’s not shot with a camera and a good old-fashioned Katha. “Once upon a time, in the kingdom of….”\n\nTintin and Avatar were possibly the worst examples the makers could have chosen to set the expectations. Simply because, though they were using motion capture technology, the makers here were working with considerably lower budgets, lesser time with half the number of cameras or markers used by those films to be able to generate that kind of data or detail.\n\nIt was an unrealistic standard and this has cost the makers dearly. Short of calling it Rajinikanth’s Tin Avatar (Gree-D) critics have ripped the film apart for the audacity of such comparisons (some of the more unkind reviewers have called it “a bad puppet show” and the technology “loose motion capture”). It was ambition way beyond their means. Or experience. Destined to fail, only because the makers aimed for the sky.\n\nStrictly in that context, the tree-top isn’t a bad start. The 3D motion capture cinema has a long way to go and this may be a small step but it is a significant one.\n\nCriticism requires holistic analysis of form and content but given that the pitch for this film has largely been the form, the film has largely been judged ONLY on the form and rather unfairly at that.\n\nThe medium is not always the message. The unrealistic marketing pitch aside, the form here is on par with Amar Chitra Katha comic illustrations, which is not necessarily a bad standard for Indian animation. It has an emotional appeal. We grew up reading those comics. Only that here, the quality of animation is quite inconsistent with attention to detail limited to the principal cast and even that emotive detailing that the principal characters are given aren’t strong enough all through. It is like watching Giant Robot in period costume.\n\nThe motion capture here doesn’t translate to emotion capture – not just because the makers could afford only half the cameras or markers used for by James Cameron and Spielberg but also because those were filmmakers with at least 30 years of experience in staging spectacles based on human drama, aided by the best cinematographers (Oscar winning Janusz Kaminski for Tintin and Mauro Fiore for Avatar) and producers with pockets deep enough to invent technology.\n\nAt the helm of Kochadaiiyaan is a barely-30 year old filmmaker making her official debut (after a shelved film) and NO director of photography. There are better ways to commit professional suicide.\n\nBut luckily for the ambitious young filmmaker, the film has already grossed 42 crores in its opening weekend, riding on brand Rajini. She just might get to make another film and I hope she does but may she have the wisdom to take professional help the next time around.\n\nCriticism for the form aside, Kochadaiiyaan does not fare too badly in terms of content because this is material written by the Superstar’s trusted old-hand K.S. Ravikumar, who has his pulse on what the fans expect from Rajinikanth.\n\nSo the formula is recycled and quite effectively except for one blaring Rajini-myth-defying error – a self-righteous king who preaches to his enemies to NOT attack from behind ends up with a son who attempts to seek revenge twice through TREACHERY. Superstar will NEVER stab from the back, even if he has to settle a score. This is blasphemy and it robs the film of the Rajini charm. Maybe a weaker hero would resort to that kind of stuff. And this is the mid portion of the film that makes Kochadaiiyaan quite hollow.\n\nNow, to the good news. It has a fantastic beginning – a hero introduction that does the Superstar all justice and a prologue that sets the stage for the epic story. Rana is a war hero who leads from the front and reunites the slaves of his erstwhile kingdom with their families (until the pre-interval twist reveals that he resorted to treachery). There’s a song post interval that slows things down further simply because the quality of animation is not strong enough to make us invest in the emotion-heavy scenes but once the flashback of Kochadaiiyaan kicks in, the film picks up furious pace and the punch lines keep the momentum going. There’s quite a bit of action and drama to sustain our interest till the end and most of this works because by now, we have got used to the inconsistencies of the animation. Also, it helps that we hear A.R. Rahman or Rajinikanth at their best, rising above the limitations of the storytelling.\n\nThe sequel set-up comes a little out of the left field but we could expect K.S.Ravikumar to fill in the blanks in the next episode and answer the basic questions. Like what on the planet was the other son doing all through Episode 1?\n\nLoyalty to the state versus family is no doubt an interesting conflict but the first part has barely touched the tip of that iceberg. I would surely line up to buy tickets for the sequel because all said and done, Kochadaiiyaan is not a bad film at all, irrespective of the context and circumstances under which it was made.\n\nIt was believed that Superstar may never be able to act again, after he was critical and hospitalised. To actually get out of bed and act again, to take on technology you are not used to with the sincerity of a debutant, to follow the directions of another debutant and attempt something like this when the market is dissuading you from dabbling with animation, demands some amount of our respect.\n\nWe have now seen what the technology can do. This was a film made out of Superstar shooting for just five days. It brought the late legendary comedian Nagesh to life. This is technology that has the potential to immortalise our favourite stars even if their expressions seem a little too dead and robotic right now.\n\nIt is the birth of a new form of storytelling, even if hasn’t learnt to walk yet. And one that has successfully sold itself to the people in spite of its latent limitations and market mood.\n\nKochadaiiyaan deserves a chance and a viewing with an open mind. I found myself enjoying the film the second time around because I had already come to terms with the technical aspects of the film. Kids are more forgiving. They may actually like this a lot more than us grown ups who love to find faults, especially, if the makers set themselves up to fail with unrealistic Tintin and Avatar comparisons.\n\nDon’t listen to the critics from the North. There’s a lot that’s clearly been lost in translation. Simply because you just can’t base your verdict on Dunston Checks In from people who have watched Ek Bandar Hotel Ke Andhar.\n\nUpdate:\n\nMy dear friend and the most hated man online Rediff critic Raja Sen who called Kochadaiiyaan a bad puppet show has these counter arguments.\n\n1) Growing up, the thing about Amar Chitra Katha was that it was consistently fascinating. Not only was it well illustrated, but the storytelling breakdown was quite sensational — never a dull moment. Which isn’t what you can say about this film where every other moment is followed by a song. You think the Pixar generation of children is going to sit through these songs? They’ll leave. Or make their parents buy them Iron Man action figures for making them sit through this.\n\n2) You say children are more forgiving. Balderdash, my friend. Children are tremendously demanding, which is why the most successful children’s films are always the most universally loved among adults (and critics) as well. For every Chhota Bheem — which has managed to successfully find and connect with an audience — there are hundreds of Indian animation attempts that have crashed and burned.\n\n3) The whole Dunston Checks In / Ek Bandar… analogy is misplaced here, considering that this is not just a Tamil film dubbed into Hindi, like Sivaji was. In Bombay theatres, Kochadaiiyaan has been promoted as a massive Hindi release — massive because Rajini himself has dubbed for it, apparently doing so after ages. If a lot has indeed been lost in translation (as I’m sure it has), far more care should have been taken to make sure it holds its own in Hindi. Either that or it should have released with subtitles.\n\n4) Any actor going through serious hospitalisation is a grave thing, and while I’m glad Rajni has bounced back — and has indeed done well here, vocally — that can’t be a criteria on which we judge the film. Just because we haven’t done mocap before on this scale as a nation doesn’t mean we start calling this laudable. (Does this mean we need to go back and celebrate Shah Rukh Khan’s ‘visionary’ RaOne as well?)\n\n5) Finally, if we’re to make allowances based on the fact that the budgets are much lesser than the west, then we as test-audiences — because that’s what we are, clearly — should be fed these films with much lesser ticket prices, NOT what we pay for Avatar or The LEGO Movie.\n\n6) An animated film has to be different from regular movies. This is like Roadside Romeo, that canine Saif Ali Khan film which could have been a live-action film. This could have been any Rajni period epic…. so why animation? I don’t think the North Indian critics have judged it purely on the quality of the animation (then they could have reviewed it after sitting through ten tacky minutes) but every one of us has been disappointed by the lack of originality and freshness in the storytelling. Imagine a Ghajini cartoon. Or even Coolie. There’s no point, is there?\n\nJust realised this one didn’t make it to print because of space constraints. Hence the delayed post.\n\nA real, troubled India emerged out of the films of 2013. An India that’s in conflict with itself, struggling to cope with identity politics that have complicated modern day relationships.\n\nHere’s a look at the Hindi films that really stood out as we take stock of the year that passed us by, in the order of merit.\n\n1. Kai Po Che,\n\nDirected by Abhishek Kapoor; Starring Rajkumar Yadav, Sushant Singh Rajput and Amit Sadh\n\nNo other film this year captured real middle class India as evocatively and realistically as Kai Po Che, a classy adaptation of\n\nChetan Bhagat’s novel ‘Three Mistakes of My Life.’ Abhishek Kapoor chose to cast lesser known actors instead of stars – to portray the capitalistic, political and emotional side of modern India respectively – shot in real locations instead of sets, had people wear\n\nreal clothes, not fancy pants and showed us India, specifically Gujarat, like never before.\n\n2. Raanjhanaa, Directed by Anand L Rai; Starring Dhanush, Sonam Kapoor, Abhay Deol, Swara Bhaskar\n\nIf Kai Po Che was set in troubled Gujarat, Anand L Rai’s Raanjhanaa explored the growing rift between the rural and urban Indias – Benares and Delhi – small town values (Kundan played by Dhanush) versus big city intellect (Zoya portrayed by Sonam Kapoor). Anand and screenwriter Himanshu Sharma refused to take sides and kept it real. Kundan and Zoya were as vulnerable and flawed as we are.\n\n3. Shahid, Directed by Hansal Mehta; Starring Rajkumar Yadav, Kay Kay Menon, Tigmanshu Dhulia\n\nIf Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra made a fable out of Milkha Singh’s life by completely forsaking reality for the sake of spirit, another filmmaker showed us how it’s done by keeping the realism in tact. Besides it’s probably easier to sing praises of an icon than tell us the story of a lesser known activist who died fighting a lone battle against the system.\n\nShahid is relevant, hard-hitting and is simply among the best courtroom dramas to have ever come out of India.\n\n4. The Lunchbox, Directed by Ritesh Batra; Starring Irrfan Khan, Nimrat Kaur, Nawazuddin Siddiqui\n\n“The Lunchbox works because it is a world we recognise and relate to. The big city life that is increasingly alienating and causing\n\ndysfunctional relationships… People in shells making no effort to reach out or connect, lost in their own mundane world of problems and routine… A crowded world that moves so fast around you that you one day wake up to find yourself old and full of regret,” as we noted in our review.\n\nThe understated, finely nuanced performances by Irrfan and Nawaz were a huge bonus in this film that felt a little scripted only towards the end.\n\n5. Bombay Talkies, Directed by Karan Johar, Dibakar Banerjee, Zoya Akhtar and Anurag Kashyap; Starring Randeep Hooda, Rani Mukerji, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Vineet Kumar Singh, Amitabh Bachchan\n\nWho would have thought that India’s most commercial filmmaker would beat the independent filmmakers at their own game. Karan Johar’s heartbreakingly beautiful story of dysfunctional relationships is one of the finest depictions of closet homosexuality in Indian cinema. One that defies every stereotype associated with gay people.\n\nEach of the four films in this anthology is proof of what our filmmakers can do, if they were given the freedom to do what they\n\nwant, irrespective of the market.\n\n6. Shuddh Desi Romance, directed by Maneesh Sharma; Starring Sushant Singh Rajput, Parineeti Chopra, Vaani Kapoor\n\n“We live in troubled times. Where relationships are messy, marriages fall apart, people fall in and out of love and arranged marriages are almost a joke. Only that not many Hindi films would dare to say it out aloud. Because it does not make good business sense to make fun of what’s at the core of the great Indian family — the arranged marriage.\n\nNor does it make commercial sense to show the youth the mirror — of how messed up and fickle they have become… But this is modern India in all its hypocritical glory,” as we observed.\n\nOne of the most misunderstood films of the year where humour by repetition got mistaken for lack of a plot.\n\n7. Madras Cafe, directed by Shootjit Sircar; Starring John Abraham, Siddhartha Basu, Nargis Fakhri, Prakash Belawadi\n\nIf this taut spy thriller works, it’s not because of its lead but in spite of them. Even if we buy into John Abraham as a spy battling his\n\ndemons, buying Nargis Fakhri’s acting as a credible performance requires quite some suspension of disbelief.\n\nYet, Madras Cafe is a compelling thriller that chronicles a fictitious conspiracy – an assassination plot – by borrowing liberally from real\n\nevents, without really taking sides.\n\n8. Ship of Theseus, Directed by Anand Gandhi; Starring Aida El Kashef, Neeraj Kabi, Sohum Shah\n\nAnand’s Ship Of Theseus was “a simple, fairly accessible, populist, touching and heart-warming film while the promos made it out to be an intellectual, layered and philosophically deep film,” as we noted earlier.\n\n“This uncompromising and honest film examines and deconstructs the Greek paradox through three relatable situations by literally applying the idea to humans and questions who we are if one of our parts were to be replaced. There are no new revelatory answers.”\n\n9. D-Day, Directed by Nikhil Advani; Starring Rishi Kapoor, Irrfan Khan, Arjun Rampal, Huma Qureshi, Shruthi Haasan\n\nNikhil Advani’s spy thriller throws logic to the winds, is supremely reductionist and trigger happy without a cause. Yet, there’s no\n\ndenying that this film makes up for all the plotholes with its pace and unabashed masala film emotionality.\n\nThis finely edited film zips past gaping holes in the storytelling and yet we cheer on because it’s populist and is wish-fulfilment of sorts.\n\nWe get to nab one of India’s most wanted men at least on screen. Inglourious Basterds and Zero Dark Thirty served Desi style.\n\n10. Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram Leela, Directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali; Starring Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone, Richa Chaddha, Supriya Pathak\n\nAs we said, this is “his most uninhibited film with raw sexual energy and explosive chemistry between the two of the best looking people in the country. Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone burn the screen down with their presence in exquisitely designed ethnic costumes tailor-made to show off their sculpted bodies and it’s a bonus that they can actually act.\n\nThe first half breezes past on pure colour, costume, choreography and chemistry that’s distinctly Bhansali… a musical that’s true to form without any pretensions of being anything more.”\n\nTen that almost made the list\n\nDavid: For the irreverence and madness it packed in the Vikram story\n\nSpecial 26: For giving us a desi Oceans film\n\nI Me aur Main: For being the most mature modern romantic comedy where girl leaves boy\n\nMere Dad Ki Maruti: For surprising us with the maximum laughs this year\n\nGo Goa Gone: For being a fun zombie comedy film despite the message\n\nFukrey: For giving the slackers their due and attempts at being zany\n\nGhanchakkar: For the mad, dark, twisted uncompromising end\n\nYeh Jawaani Hai Deewani: For Badtameez Dil and its zest for travel\n\nLootera: For its gorgeous cinematography\n\nAkaash Vaani: For showing us the ugly side of arranged marriages like never before"
