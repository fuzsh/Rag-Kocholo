Hariharan explores Kamal Haasan’s evolution across 50-plus films, showcasing his ability to challenge stereotypes and push boundaries. Here are some lesser-known facts from the screen legend’s incredible journey from the audiobook:\n\nWhen veteran producer L.V. Prasad screened ‘Ek Duje Ke Liye’ for the first time, it was a disaster.\n\nKamal Haasan bridged the north-south divide in India and made inroads into the Hindi film industry with ‘Ek Duuje Ke Liye’ (1981), which was what we would now call a pan-India film. Despite the initial setbacks and sceptical distributors in Mumbai, the film eventually was greeted with packed cinemas and emotional reactions.\n\nThe audience response took the veteran producer L.V. Prasad by complete surprise. In the words of Hariharan, “Prasad realised that everyone had seen a wholesome tragedy after a long time on the Hindi screen and there was no difference in feelings between the Tamil and Hindi audiences … he immediately called his son to order another 40 prints to be released all over India the following Friday.”\n\nThe film went on to celebrate 50 weeks in the theatres (a golden jubilee in the terminology that was current then) and the rest is history.\n\nShah Rukh Khan did not charge a paisa for his role in ‘Hey Ram’.\n\nKamal Haasan’s journey with ‘Hey Ram’ (2000) began with an idea akin to a crime thriller, but he soon realized that empathizing with Gandhi’s assassin, Nathuram Godse, would be too reactionary.\n\n“I changed it around completely and made the story get some respect for the protagonist. Undoubtedly, the film got me a lot of respect, but it flopped,” Kamal Haasan tells Hariharan. Shah Rukh Khan, however, “was so impressed by the vision of the film that he refused to charge a penny for his performance as Amjad, instead deeming it an honour to get an opportunity to work with a legend like Kamal.”\n\nSilent comedy ‘Pushpak’ was certified by the Censor Board multiple times in the same year in all Indian languages.\n\nInspired by the legacy of Charlie Chaplin, Kamal Haasan’s ‘Pushpak’ (1987) redefined silent comedy for Indian audiences. In the audiobook, Hariharan shares that the film’s release strategy was quite complex because of the absence of dialogue.\n\n“The rule says that a talkie has to be in a certain language,” explains Hariharan. “In order to release this wordless film all over India, it was certified the same year by the Censor Board multiple times, in all Indian languages, with titles being changed and new censor certificates issued in all languages!”\n\n‘Sathya’ almost got shelved because of Kamal Haasan’s financial difficulties.\n\nThe 1988 movie ‘Sathya’ was a bold move as it was the remake of the 1985 Bollywood hit ‘Arjun’, scripted by Javed Akhtar. Suresh Krishnaa was the director of the Tamil film and Kamal’s production house was helming the project. Kamal demonstrated his remarkable acting prowess, says Hariharan, but the film’s production faced a number of challenges.\n\n“Kamal’s second production, a big-budget sci-fi venture titled ‘Vikram’ suffered on both critical and commercial fronts. His company had to comfort the distributors who had shouldered the risk of such an ambitious film,” writes Hariharan. But the film did well on all counts. With a stellar musical score by Ilaiyaraaja and Kamal’s relentless dedication, ‘Sathya’ became a defining film resonating deeply with audiences. (IANS)\n\nLucky Baskhar Gets New Release Date\n\nThe much-anticipated film “Lucky Baskhar,” directed by Venky Atluri, has a new release date. Initially slated to hit theaters on September 27, the film will now be released on September 7, coinciding with the Ganesh Chaturthi festival. Dulquer Salmaan, the lead actor, took to X (formerly known as Twitter) to share this update with fans.\n\nAnnouncement by Dulquer Salmaan\n\nDulquer Salmaan announced the new release date on X, accompanied by a fresh still from the movie. He wrote, “This Vinayaka Chaturthi, Get ready to experience #LuckyBaskhar’s unforgettable journey on the Big Screens! Worldwide Grand Release on 7th SEPT in Telugu, Malayalam, Tamil & Hindi Languages. #LuckyBaskharOnSept7th.” This announcement has generated significant excitement among fans eagerly awaiting the film’s release.\n\nOriginal Release Plans and Changes\n\nOriginally, “Lucky Baskhar” was set to premiere on September 27, alongside Sujeeth’s Pawan Kalyan-starrer “They Call Him OG.” However, due to delays in wrapping up “They Call Him OG,” caused by Pawan Kalyan’s political engagements, the release of “Lucky Baskhar” has been advanced. This move is expected to benefit the film by avoiding a direct clash at the box office.\n\nTeaser Release and Storyline\n\nIn April, Dulquer Salmaan released the teaser for “Lucky Baskhar,” providing a glimpse into the film’s plot. The teaser portrays Baskhar as a bored banker working at the fictional Magadha Bank. He is depicted as a ‘common, middle-class, Indian man’ who is weary of his monotonous daily routine. This includes waking up, getting dressed, dealing with traffic, and performing his repetitive job, only to fall asleep at work. The teaser hints at a significant turning point when Baskhar stumbles upon a large sum of money, raising curiosity about how he acquired it. Meenakshi Chaudhary plays the role of the woman Baskhar loves, adding a romantic angle to the story.\n\nSetting and Production Details\n\n“Lucky Baskhar” is set against the backdrop of the late 1980s to early 1990s, focusing on the life of a bank cashier during that era. The filmmakers went to great lengths to recreate the period accurately. The shooting was completed in Hyderabad, where the production team constructed sets resembling Bombay of the 80s. This included building a bank that mirrors those from that time. Such meticulous attention to detail was aimed at ensuring authenticity in the portrayal of the era.\n\nCast and Crew\n\nMeenakshi Chaudhary stars alongside Dulquer Salmaan in the film. The music for “Lucky Baskhar” has been composed by GV Prakash Kumar, adding to the film’s nostalgic feel. The production is handled by Naga Vamsi and Sai Soujanya under the banners of Sitara Entertainments and Fortune Four Cinemas. Srikara Studios is presenting the film.\n\nBanglan, the production designer, conducted extensive research to bring authenticity to the sets, ensuring that the visual elements accurately reflect the period in which the film is set. Cinematographer Nimish Ravi played a crucial role in bringing director Venky Atluri’s vision to life through his camera work, capturing the essence of the late 80s and early 90s.\n\nMultilingual Release\n\n“Lucky Baskhar” will be released in four languages: Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, and Hindi. This multilingual release strategy aims to reach a broader audience across different regions, reflecting the diverse linguistic landscape of India.\n\nA.R. Rahman’s Documentary ‘Headhunting to Beatboxing’ to Premiere at Indian Film Festival of Melbourne 2024\n\nOscar and Grammy award-winning composer A. R. Rahman’s documentary, “Headhunting to Beatboxing,” directed by Rohit Gupta, is set to have its world premiere at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne (IFFM) 2024 in Australia.\n\nRahman expressed his excitement about the film’s premiere, stating, “The film is very special to us, as it throws light on the beautiful state of Nagaland and highlights the rich cultural and musical history it contains. Rohit and I are looking forward to the premiere and showcasing it to the audiences in Melbourne.”\n\n“Headhunting to Beatboxing” explores the journey of rhythm and sound in Nagaland, highlighting the evolution of music across various cultures, tribes, and generations. The film is also competing for the Best Documentary Film at the festival.\n\nGupta shared his thoughts on the documentary’s significance, saying, “I feel the narrative holds global relevance, along with the incredible healing power of music. The film has been painstakingly made in over five years and I am excited to see the audience’s reactions to it and for them to explore the rich cultural and musical tapestry of Nagaland. Especially to hear a completely new sound coming from India.”\n\nThis documentary marks Rahman’s second major venture into filmmaking as a producer, following his earlier production, “99 Songs,” which premiered at the Busan International Film Festival.\n\nIFFM Festival director Mitu Bhowmick Lange commented on the documentary’s selection, stating, “When we saw the documentary, we knew there was something special to it. We are delighted to have the world premiere of the film at IFFM and have Dr Rahman and filmmaker Rohit Gupta present it to our audiences.”\n\nThe film has been directed by Rohit Gupta and produced by A. R. Rahman, with Abu Metha, Adam J. Greig, Theja Meru, Rohit Gupta, Sheila Houlahan, and Rohhit Daas serving as Executive Producers.\n\nThe Indian Film Festival of Melbourne, which is set to celebrate its 15th year, will commence on August 15 and conclude on August 25. This annual celebration is presented by the Victorian Government.\n\nThe Film ‘Maharaj’ Echoes the Story of Its Historical Subject\n\nIn the 1860s, journalist and social reformer Karsandas Mulji faced legal challenges after exposing the sexual misconduct of a powerful religious leader. Over 150 years later, a film based on his life, **Maharaj**, starring Aamir Khan’s son Junaid, faced a similar fate. The film’s release was delayed by a petition from a religious sect, accompanied by boycott calls on social media. On June 21, just a week after its scheduled release on Netflix, the Gujarat High Court lifted the stay, ruling, “Having viewed the film, this court found nothing objectionable that would hurt the religious feelings of petitioners or a sect.”\n\n**Maharaj** draws from Saurabh Shah’s 2013 Gujarati novel, narrating the 1862 Maharaj libel case, where British judges in colonial India arbitrated between religious conservatism and progressive reform. Karsandas, editor of the Gujarati weekly **Satyaprakash**, was sued for defamation by Jadunathji, a high priest of the influential Pushtimarga sect. The case, fought in the Supreme Court of Bombay, garnered significant public attention. Karsandas successfully defended himself but incurred expenses that outweighed his awarded compensation.\n\nDirector Karan P Malhotra shifts the courtroom events to the film’s climax, a choice that avoids the often exaggerated portrayals in Hindi period dramas. Instead, the film focuses on the conflict between Karsandas (Junaid Khan) and Jadunath (Jaideep Ahlawat), known as JJ to his followers. JJ, a charismatic figure, exploits the vulnerability of female devotees. Karsandas, a Vaishnavite himself, resists JJ’s influence, challenging superstitious practices while maintaining his faith.\n\nIn the film, Karsandas emerges as a beacon of virtue in a conservative society, advocating for widow remarriage and interacting with ‘untouchables.’ His crusade against JJ intensifies after his fiancée, Kishori (Shalini Pandey), a victim of JJ, commits suicide following Karsandas’s decision to break off their engagement. Realizing his error in focusing on her “honor” instead of supporting her emancipation, Karsandas becomes a 19th-century male savior. The film is predominantly about men debating women’s rights, with a late entry by Viraaj (Sharvari Wagh) providing some balance as she joins Karsandas in his mission.\n\nEarly in the film, a narrator describes Bombay as “more a concept than a city,” highlighting the era’s conflicting ideas. The film portrays the reformist zeal of figures like Karsandas and Dadabhai Naoroji against the backdrop of JJ’s influence and the common masses’ confusion. Despite set-like production designs, Rajeev Ravi’s cinematography adds a painterly charm to the film.\n\nMaharaj clearly depicts JJ’s powerful hold over his community. He is described as having become “the face of the sect,” drawing wealthy patrons and consolidating power. The film criticizes blind faith and personality cults while unifying portrayals of religion. When JJ bans temple visits to force an apology from Karsandas, the young reformer leads an aarti under a peepal tree with a picture of Lord Krishna. The film later echoes the Janmashtami story with an imperiled couple being ferried to safety.\n\nJunaid Khan delivers a sincere performance as Karsandas but falls short of becoming a captivating lead, especially in courtroom scenes. Jaideep Ahlawat’s portrayal of JJ is effortlessly villainous, contrasting sharply with Junaid’s earnestness. Their confrontation in the rain underscores the difference in their performances. Sharvari Wagh brings charm and spunk to her limited scenes, and Jay Upadhyay is notable as JJ’s scheming assistant.\n\nThe film’s release faced significant challenges, reflecting current sensitivities. Earlier this year, the Tamil film **Annapoorani** was pulled from Netflix following right-wing complaints of religious offense. **Maharaj**, though simple and sedate, might have gone unnoticed if not for these sensitivities. Its release without promotions or a trailer highlights the caution of streaming platforms today, underscoring the non-linear path of progress.\n\nMaharaj (Hindi)\n\n– Director:Karan P Malhotra\n\n– Cast: Junaid Khan, Jaideep Ahlawat, Shalini Pandey, Sharvari Wagh, Jay Upadhyay\n\n– Runtime: 131 minutes\n\n– Storyline:The real-life story of a journalist in 1860s Bombay and his crusade against a powerful, lecherous godman\n\nOverall, Maharaj reflects the complex interplay between tradition and reform in colonial India, mirroring the historical events it depicts and the contemporary reactions it provoked.\n\nVinod Ganatra Honored with Nelson Mandela Lifetime Achievement Award for Contributions to Children’s Cinema\n\nMumbai– Vinod Ganatra, a highly-regarded filmmaker and editor originally from Gujarat and now based in Mumbai, has achieved a significant milestone by becoming the first Indian recipient of South Africa’s prestigious ‘Nelson Mandela Lifetime Achievement Award’ for his remarkable contributions to cinema, particularly in the realm of children’s films.\n\nAccording to an official announcement made here on Tuesday, Ganatra was honored with this esteemed award during the 7th Nelson Mandela Children’s Film Festival, in recognition of his extensive body of work that has left a lasting impact on the world of cinema for young audiences.\n\nThe accolade adds to Ganatra’s already illustrious career, which spans over three decades and includes a total of 36 national and international awards. Among his notable recognitions are the ‘Janakinath Gaur Award’ from Doordarshan for his popular children’s program, ‘Baingan Raja’, and the ‘Liv Ullmann Peace Prize’ in Chicago for his Gujarati film, ‘Harun-Arun’.\n\nThroughout his career, Ganatra has also been invited to serve on the jury of more than 100 national, regional, and international film festivals. His contributions extend beyond filmmaking, encompassing the editing and direction of over 400 documentaries and news reels, as well as the production of 25 multilingual television programs tailored for children and youth.\n\nA pivotal figure in the children’s film movement, Ganatra founded the ‘Ahmedabad International Children Film Festival’ and has served on the jury of prominent events such as the Culture Cinema Film Festival (C2F2) and KidzCINEMA, an international children’s film festival based in Mumbai.\n\nGanatra gained international acclaim early in his career with his debut feature ‘Heda-Hoda (Blind Camel)’, followed by ‘Lukka-Chhuppi (Hide-n-Seek)’, the first children’s film entirely shot at high altitude in Ladakh. His subsequent work includes ‘Harun-Arun’, a poignant exploration set against the backdrop of the India-Pakistan border in Gujarat, which premiered at the 26th Chicago International Children’s Film Festival.\n\nFor over a decade, Ganatra has been an integral part of UNESCO’s International Centre of Films for Children & Young People, serving on its board and currently holding an honorary membership.\n\nGanatra expressed his gratitude for the award, highlighting the importance of cinema in shaping young minds and fostering cultural exchange. He remains committed to advancing the field of children’s cinema, advocating for its recognition and growth on both national and international stages.\n\nThrough his pioneering work and dedication, Vinod Ganatra continues to inspire audiences and filmmakers alike, leaving an indelible mark on the world of cinema and affirming his place as a trailblazer in the realm of children’s films.\n\nSania Mirza Opens Up About Biopic Possibilities, Divorce, and Admiration for Akshay Kumar on Kapil Sharma’s Show\n\nSports icons Sania Mirza, Mary Kom, Saina Nehwal, and Sift Kaur recently appeared as guests on Netflix’s “The Great Indian Kapil Show.” During their conversation with host Kapil Sharma, the topic of a Bollywood biopic on Sania Mirza came up. Sania shared her thoughts humorously and candidly, providing an interesting perspective on the idea.\n\nKapil Sharma noted that Mary Kom had Priyanka Chopra portray her in a 2014 biopic, and Parineeti Chopra played Saina Nehwal in 2021. When asked who she would prefer to play her in a film, Sania joked, “Inki koi behen bachi hain? (Are there any sisters left?)” She continued, “No, I think we have many good actors in our country. Anyone is fine. Or maybe I should play myself.”\n\nKapil further mentioned that Shah Rukh Khan had once expressed interest in playing Sania’s love interest if a biopic were made. This prompted a momentary awkwardness for Sania, considering her recent divorce from cricketer Shoaib Malik. Lightening the mood, she responded, “But I need to find a love interest first.” When Kapil asked if she would act in her biopic if Shah Rukh starred in it, she said, “If Shah Rukh ji does the film, I might play myself. And I’ll definitely do it if Akshay Kumar is in it.”\n\nKapil also inquired how Sania managed to get Swiss tennis player Martina Hingis to be her doubles partner, jesting if it was through Hyderabadi biryani. Sania replied humorously, “I took Farah (Khan) along, and she fed us biryani.”\n\nSania Mirza’s admiration for Akshay Kumar has been evident over the years. In 2014, Akshay attended one of her International Premier Tennis League (ITPL) matches, along with celebrities like Deepika Padukone and Aamir Khan. During the pandemic in 2020, when Sania was in India and Shoaib Malik was in Pakistan, they had a ‘virtual date’ over Instagram live. During a game of “Ditch and Marry,” Shoaib asked her to choose between Tom Cruise and Akshay Kumar. Sania’s response highlighted her long-standing admiration: “I’ve liked Akshay Kumar since Mohra days. I’m not gonna ditch him. When nobody liked Akshay, I liked Akshay.”\n\nThe conversation with Kapil Sharma also touched on Sania and Shoaib Malik’s divorce. After months of speculation, Shoaib and Sana Javed posted their wedding photos on Instagram on January 19, 2024. Sania’s family confirmed the separation, stating that she and Shoaib had been divorced for a few months. The family’s statement read, “Sania has always kept her personal life away from the public eye. However, today the need has arisen for her to share that Shoaib and she have been divorced for a few months now. She wishes Shoaib well for his new journey ahead.”\n\nThe playful exchange on “The Great Indian Kapil Show” provided insights into Sania Mirza’s life and career, mixing light-hearted moments with personal revelations. It showcased Sania’s sense of humor, her openness about her personal life, and her deep admiration for Akshay Kumar, adding a relatable and humanizing touch to the sports star’s public persona.\n\nSanya Malhotra Clinches Best Actress Award at New York Indian Film Festival for ‘Mrs’ Role, Highlighting Rising Talent and Captivating Storytelling\n\nSanya Malhotra has secured the Best Actress award at the esteemed New York Indian Film Festival 2024 for her performance in the film ‘Mrs’.\n\nDirected by Arati Kadav, ‘Mrs’ is reportedly the Hindi adaptation of the highly praised Malayalam movie, ‘The Great Indian Kitchen’.

This award is the second highest honor after the Palme d’Or.\n\nKapadia’s film, “All We Imagine As Light,” is a drama about two Malayali nurses who move to a beautifully depicted Mumbai, exploring themes of life, love, and sisterhood. Remarkably, it is the first Indian film in three decades to compete in the main competition at Cannes.\n\n“It was already a dream to be selected in competition and this was beyond my imagination,” Kapadia said in her acceptance speech, addressing the Cannes jury, which included director Greta Gerwig and actor Lily Gladstone. She added, “Please don’t wait another 30 years to have an Indian film,” eliciting applause from the audience.\n\nThe victory has caused a wave of celebration across India, with numerous people, including top politicians, acknowledging its significance on social media. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his pride on X, saying, “Her remarkable talent continues to shine on the global stage, giving a glimpse of the rich creativity in India. This prestigious accolade not only honors her exceptional skills but also inspires a new generation of Indian filmmakers.”\n\nRahul Gandhi, a prominent leader of the Indian National Congress, along with Anasuya Sengupta, the first Indian actor to win Best Actress for her role in “The Shameless” in the festival’s Un Certain Regard section, also congratulated Kapadia. Gandhi noted, “Indian stars shining bright… These women have scripted history, and inspired the entire Indian film fraternity.”\n\nSooni Taraporevala, a screenwriter known for “Salaam Bombay!” which won the Camera d’Or at Cannes in 1988, commented to CNN on the significance of Kapadia’s “unprecedented” win. She emphasized that it “has personally touched women and those in the indie film space,” adding that it has “allowed us to dream and hope and celebrate her with unabashed pride and joy,” especially in an industry often dominated by mainstream productions.\n\n“All We Imagine As Light” received an eight-minute standing ovation at its festival premiere, a testament to its powerful storytelling and emotional impact. The film’s portrayal of the romance between the protagonist Prabha (played by Kani Kusruti) and her Muslim boyfriend (Hridhu Haroon) is particularly bold, reflecting the country’s increasing polarization along religious lines.\n\nDespite being the largest film-producing country in the world, India has often struggled to achieve the same level of international recognition and accolades as Hollywood. However, there have been notable successes. Last year, the Telegu-language historical fantasy “RRR” became the first Indian feature film to win an Oscar for best original song with its catchy and vibrant “Naatu Naatu.” Additionally, “The Elephant Whisperers,” directed by Kartiki Gonsalves, won the Oscar for best documentary short.\n\nIndia’s cinematic achievements at Cannes have a storied history. In 1947, filmmaker Chetan Anand won Cannes’ top prize for his film “Neecha Nagar,” making him the only Indian to win that accolade until now.\n\nKapadia’s earlier work has also been celebrated at Cannes. In 2021, she won the festival’s L’Oeil d’Or award for her documentary “A Night of Knowing Nothing,” which follows a film student in India as she tries to maintain a relationship with her ex despite the challenges posed by their different castes.\n\nThis latest win by Kapadia at Cannes marks a significant moment not only for her career but also for Indian cinema as a whole. It highlights the rich narrative and artistic capabilities of Indian filmmakers and sets a new precedent for future generations. The global recognition of her film underscores the importance of diverse storytelling and the universal appeal of well-crafted cinema.\n\nIndia’s Cinematic Influence: How Bollywood Shapes Political Narratives in the World’s Largest Democracy\n\nAs India, the world’s largest democracy, heads to the polls, political parties are leveraging popular culture, particularly cinema, to influence voters. Historically, Indian films have both mirrored and shaped the nation’s political and social landscapes, but currently, Bollywood and regional films significantly bolster the ruling right-wing government.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi leads the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is aiming for a third consecutive term in office. The BJP, founded as the political branch of the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) — a paramilitary volunteer organization — is one of India’s two main political parties. With 80 percent of India’s population being Hindu, the BJP posits that India is inherently a Hindu nation. Their platform has resonated widely, partly because they portray India as a formidable post-colonial power. In contrast, the main opposition, the Indian National Congress, advocates secularism. During his campaign last month, Prime Minister Modi gave a speech that faced widespread criticism for being Islamophobic.\n\nIn a recent episode of the podcast Don’t Call Me Resilient, political scientist Sikata Banerjee from the University of Victoria and cinema studies scholar Rakesh Sengupta from the University of Toronto discuss how cinema and social media help propagate ideas that include “a vicious vocabulary of hate against minorities and dissenters” in India, potentially swaying voter opinions.\n\n“In Modi’s India, when people are asking these questions, why am I poor? Why am I feeling so worthless? The answer is always the Muslims,” says Banerjee. “The Muslims have taken away your wealth. They’re taking all the jobs…You see very clearly how Modi is getting people on board with this idea of the Hindu imagined community.”\n\nThis blend of Islamophobia and modern Hindu pride has penetrated Bollywood, the world’s largest film industry, producing around 1,500-2,000 films annually. These films have promoted the vision of a reimagined, strong, and triumphant India. This narrative is further amplified by streaming platforms and social media such as YouTube and WhatsApp, which have even broader reach than traditional Bollywood films.\n\nAn example of this trend is last year’s ‘Tollywood’ movie RRR, which received accolades at the Oscars. RRR retells historical events from the perspective of the current “victors.” Another film accused of distorting history is Swatantra Veer Savarkar, which focuses on Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, the originator of the Hindu nationalist ideology of Hindutva.\n\nSengupta from the University of Toronto explains that the interplay between cinema and the state in India has always been historically significant. “You can always historically see a kind of reflection of the state of a particular time in the cinema of that time,” he notes. “Under the current regime of Hindu nationalism, we are witnessing more and more films being made on Hindu pride and Muslim violence.”\n\nThe election process in India began on April 19 and spans seven phases, concluding on June 1, 2024.\n\nMammootty Sends Birthday Wishes to Mohanlal as Icon Turns 64\n\nRenowned actor Mohanlal, a beloved figure in Kerala, commemorates his 64th birthday today.\n\nMohanlal’s journey to stardom wasn’t paved with privilege but rather with relentless effort, unwavering dedication, and a profound commitment to his craft. Beginning his career in 1978, it wasn’t until two years later that he embarked on his full-fledged cinematic journey. Despite being initially cast as a villain in the 1980 hit “Manjil Virinja Pookal,” his career soared swiftly, solidifying his status as a superstar. Currently, at the age of 64, he is engaged in his 360th Malayalam film, yet to be named, where he reunites with Shobana for the 56th time.\n\nOn this auspicious occasion, Mohanlal’s longtime colleague, Mammootty, extended his heartfelt wishes, accompanied by a delightful picture capturing a tender moment between the two. Well-wishes have begun flooding in from various quarters as the actor celebrates his 64th milestone, coinciding with the anticipation surrounding his directorial debut, “Barroz.”\n\nThroughout his illustrious career, Mohanlal has amassed numerous accolades, including five National Awards, encompassing two Best Actor awards, a Special Jury mention, and a Special Jury award for his acting prowess and production excellence. Complementing his national recognition are nine State Film Awards, a testament to his enduring impact on the Malayalam film industry. Notably, he holds the distinction of being the first actor bestowed with the honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Territorial Army.\n\nMalayalam Cinema Soars to New Heights in 2024, Surpassing Rs 1,000 Crore Worldwide While Bollywood, Tollywood, and Kollywood Struggle\n\nAs India’s major film industries such as Bollywood, Telugu, and Tamil struggle with a trend of films failing at the box office despite star-studded casts and high budgets, the Malayalam film industry is flourishing, generating substantial revenue with a series of successful films. While other industries strive to recover, the Malayalam film sector has already seen multiple blockbusters and superhits, surpassing the Rs 1,000 crore mark at the global box office.\n\nA significant portion of this success comes from just three films. “Manjummel Boys,” “Aadujeevitham (The Goat Life),” and “Aavesham” collectively contributed approximately 55 percent of the total revenue, earning Rs 240.94 crore, Rs 157.44 crore, and Rs 153.52 crore, respectively, as reported by industry tracker Sacnilk. Before the release of Vipin Das’ “Guruvayoorambala Nadayil,” featuring Prithviraj Sukumaran, Basil Joseph, Nikhila Vimal, and Anaswara Rajan, Mathrubhumi noted that Malayalam cinema’s total earnings from January to April 2024 had reached Rs 985 crore. Adding Sacnilk’s report that “Guruvayoorambala Nadayil” has grossed over Rs 30 crore globally, the industry’s worldwide gross surpasses Rs 1,000 crore, marking 2024 as a milestone year in its history.\n\nLast year, according to Mathrubhumi, the Malayalam film industry had a global gross of about Rs 500 crore, bolstered by the successes of films like “2018,” “Kannur Squad,” “RDX,” “Neru,” and “Romancham.” So far in 2024, Malayalam cinema has accounted for 20 percent of India’s total box office collection, while Bollywood has contributed 38 percent. Remarkably, five of the top ten highest-grossing films in Malayalam cinema’s history— “Manjummel Boys,” “Aadujeevitham,” “Aavesham,” “Premalu,” and “Bramayugam”— were released in 2024.\n\nDomestically, the Malayalam film industry’s net earnings have exceeded Rs 500 crore, with “Manjummel Boys” contributing Rs 141.99 crore, “Aadujeevitham” Rs 85.08 crore, “Aavesham” Rs 84.73 crore, “Premalu” Rs 75.64 crore, and “Bramayugam” Rs 27.03 crore.\n\nIn contrast, Bollywood, which had two Rs 1,000 crore grossers last year due to Shah Rukh Khan’s major comeback and several Rs 500 crore grossers, is struggling in 2024. The industry has failed to maintain last year’s success streak following a prolonged downturn. As of now, director Siddharth Anand’s “Fighter,” starring Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone, is Bollywood’s highest-grossing film of 2024, earning Rs 358.89 crore. Other films that have crossed the Rs 100 crore mark this year include “Shaitaan” (Rs 213.64 crore), “Crew” (Rs 151.35 crore), “Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya” (Rs 146.26 crore), and “Article 370” (Rs 105.15 crore).\n\nTollywood, once a dominant force in Indian cinema, has seen only two successful films this year: “Hanu-Man” and “Tillu Square.” Most of its highly anticipated releases, including Mahesh Babu’s “Guntur Kaaram,” Nagarjuna’s “Naa Saami Ranga,” Ravi Teja’s “Eagle,” Venkatesh’s “Saindhav,” and Vijay Deverakonda’s “The Family Star,” have performed poorly at the box office.\n\nKollywood is facing an even more challenging year, with just one film, “Captain Miller,” crossing the Rs 100 crore mark. Other notable releases like “Ayalaan” and “Aranmanai 4” have not made a significant impact.\n\nWhile other major Indian film industries grapple with box office challenges, the Malayalam film industry stands out with its series of successful releases, significantly contributing to the overall revenue. The industry’s ability to produce consecutive hits and superhits has propelled it to new heights in 2024, achieving a remarkable milestone by surpassing the Rs 1,000 crore mark at the worldwide box office.\n\nIndia Shines at 77th Cannes Film Festival: Bharat Pavilion Showcases Cinematic Brilliance and Cultural Richness\n\nThe Indian Ministry of Information and Broadcasting unveiled the Bharat Pavilion at the 77th Cannes Film Festival on May 15, aiming to highlight India’s cinematic contributions on a global platform.\n\nThe Bharat Pavilion is a staple at Cannes, and its inauguration was attended by key figures such as Secretary Sanjay Jaju of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, and Jawed Ashraf, India’s Ambassador to France. Filmmaker Richie Mehta was among the prominent industry representatives present.\n\nSecretary Sanjay Jaju expressed satisfaction with India’s growing representation in the official Cannes selection this year. He emphasized the government’s commitment to supporting Indian projects at the festival, noting the pavilion’s pivotal role in fostering networking and collaboration. “The pavilion is a hub for networking and collaboration, elevating the visibility and accessibility of Indian cinema worldwide,” Jaju highlighted.\n\nAmbassador Jawed Ashraf discussed India’s rising global importance, particularly in cinema, as a vehicle for showcasing its cultural depth and storytelling capabilities. He elaborated, “India is gaining attention worldwide, both geopolitically and economically, due to its philosophical contributions, thoughts, and ideas. Its role in a multipolar world of great uncertainty is significant as we transition from the existing international order into a new one. All these aspects are interconnected, making it increasingly important for us to have a greater presence abroad, particularly in cinema.”\n\nFilmmaker Richie Mehta expressed his pride in bringing Indian narratives to an international audience. He shared, “It’s such a momentous occasion of Indian cinema here. One of my missions as a Canadian Indian has been to export the best of Indian storytelling, not just from a film standpoint, but from the stories, from people on the ground, from the amazing culture that we have to show the world. It’s a real honour to be a part of this inaugural.”\n\nThe participation of various Indian states, including Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Goa, and Maharashtra, in the Cannes Film Market, was another highlight. These states showcased India’s diverse filming locations and state-level incentives for international film production. Notably, three films facilitated by India’s Film Facilitation Office (FFO) were shortlisted in different sections of this year’s festival.\n\nThe Bharat Pavilion hosted numerous panel discussions and networking sessions throughout the festival. These events provided insights into Indian films, talent, and industry opportunities, fostering greater international collaboration.\n\nRenowned Indian actresses Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Aditi Rao Hydari returned to the Cannes red carpet, representing L’Oréal Paris, the official Makeup Partner of the Festival de Cannes. Other Indian actors, including Kiara Advani, Shohita Dhulipala, Jacqueline Fernandez, Urvashi Rautela, and Deepti Sadhwani, were also featured on the red carpet.\n\nThe Bharat Pavilion at Cannes remains a crucial initiative, reinforcing India’s cinematic presence on the world stage and promoting its rich cultural heritage through the medium of film.\n\nZEE5 Global Gears Up For The Digital Premiere Of The Gripping Movie Bastar: The Naxal Story\n\nZEE5 Global, the world’s largest streaming platform for South Asian content, announces the digital premiere of the hard-hitting crime drama produced by Sunshine Pictures Pvt Ltd – ‘Bastar: The Naxal Story’.

There is a grace to the way she goes about her work: focused, open to ideas, and willing to take creative risks. One of my favourite moments in the film came from an improvisation at the end of a take where she took the emotional thread and ran with it.\n\n“Alia’s superpower is her ability to mix movie-star magnetism with authenticity and sensitivity.

I wish I could hear the music before each take now, but that is the process of cinema, you don’t get to do that. I would like to thank you for what you have done for the film, you are as big a character as Najeeb is in The Goat Life. It’s an amazing piece of work,” said Prithviraj.\n\nThe film is based on the novel ‘Aadujeevitham’, one of the most popular best sellers ever from the Malayalam literary world, which has been translated in 12 different languages, including those that are foreign.\n\nPenned by noted writer Benyamin and it follows the true story of the life of a young man Najeeb, who in the early 90s migrates from the lush green shores of Kerala in search of the fortunes in a land abroad.

This was truly special.”\n\nThe post also garnered mixed reactions. A troll commented, “So many female scientists, achievers, entrepreneurs this country has produced.. yet Harvard is inviting those who lip-synced to songs and danced around trees to motivate them… it’s sad and hilarious.”Defending the actress, a fan hit back, “You can write a paragraph but cannot read a few words on that screen. It was about Bollywood so why would they invite scientists or entrepreneurs?”\n\nAn X user called out Harvard Business School for inviting Karisma Kapoor to speak on ‘soft power of Bollywood’ despite the fact that she isn’t a graduate.\n\nHowever, another user defended Karisma by commenting, “Uninformed Bewfkoof aurat (dumb woman)!

Starring the versatile National award-winning actor Pankaj Tripathi in the role of former Indian Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee and directed by the acclaimed award-winning filmmaker Ravi Jadhav, ‘Main Atal Hoon’ takes viewers on an extraordinary journey through the life and political legacy of one of India’s most iconic and illustrious leaders.\n\n‘Main Atal Hoon’ traces the political journey of this tall parliamentarian of over four decades, who was conferred the Bharat Ratna in December 2014. It was Atalji who prepared the foundations of an India that is ready to take on the mantle of global leadership in the 21st century as he irreversibly changed India’s place in the world. Vajpayee’s legacy continues to serve as a guiding light for present and future political leaders as in his simplicity and integrity, in his dignity and empathy, and a sense of personal non-attachment to the office, he became an inspiration for the youth.\n\nFrom arriving at the Parliament on a bullock cart to protesting against the fuel price hike to representing India at the UN as an Opposition leader, Vajpayee has left behind a political legacy that few can rival. Atal Bihari Vajpayee had a decisive and irreversible effect on India’s strategic thinking and was instrumental in the country’s many strategic decisions including putting India firmly on the nuclear weapons map of the world, setting up a telecom revolution, successfully concluding and winning the Kargil war, among many other victories.\n\nThe film, produced by Vinod Bhanushali, Sandeep Singh, and Kamlesh Bhanushali under the banner of Bhanushali Studios Limited and Legend Studios, sheds light on the multifaceted persona of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, capturing his essence not just as a political figure but also as a gentleman with infinite patience, an uncompromising patriot, a gifted orator, and a leader who was way ahead of his times. The film will have its world digital premiere on March 14 exclusively on ZEE5 Global.\n\nArchana Anand, Chief Business Officer at ZEE5 Global said, “There’s a notable shift in South Asian content consumption, with a growing demand for real-life narratives inspired by iconic figures. In line with this trend, our upcoming title ‘Main Atal Hoon’ portrays the remarkable life of former Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, brought to life by Pankaj Tripathi, offering viewers a moving tale of an illustrious leader.”\n\nLead actor, Pankaj Tripathi said, “It was a real honour for me to get to portray one of the most illustrious leaders of our country who laid the foundation for our country’s success. While I was aware of Atal Ji and his remarkable political journey, this film introduced me to many more inspiring qualities and facets of his life which have now left an indelible mark on my life. Portraying Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee has truly been one of the highlights of my career and for that, I am grateful. Now that the film is marking its world digital debut on ZEE5 Global, I urge all Indians across the world to watch the remarkable story of this simple man and take back many lessons”.\n\nDirector Ravi Jadhav said, “Pankaj Tripathi was the only choice for ‘Main Atal Hoon’ as he has the soft qualities of this iconic man, and I am glad that he agreed to be a part of this film as his involvement truly made this journey even more remarkable. Main Hoon Atal is our little tribute to Atal ji – an inspiring leader who was way ahead of his time and now, with the film releasing on ZEE5 Global, I sincerely hope that the film reaches the mind and the heart of every Indian across the globe as there is so much to learn and imbibe from this visionary man”.\n\nProducer Vinod Bhanushali said, “We are immensely proud to have been able to bring to life the journey and legacy of such an inspiring man and India’s 3-time Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee. And what made the project even more special was the chance to work with such talented individuals, including Pankaj Tripathi and Ravi Jadhav. I believe that our combined dedication and passion for this project deeply connected and resonated with the people and now with the film’s world digital premiere of ZEE5 Global, we are hoping to strike a chord with many more people across the world”.\n\nZEE5 Global is the digital entertainment destination launched by Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited (ZEEL), a global Media and Entertainment powerhouse.

In a letter, he said that the party would contest the 2026 Tamil Nadu State Assembly elections.\n\nVijay’s entry into active politics was announced with the clarification that his target is the 2026 state election. He said that he wouldn’t be participating in the upcoming national election in any way. Given how often his characters win on screen, it wasn’t entirely a surprise his political party will be called ‘Tamilaka Vetri Kazhagam’ (TVK), which roughly translates to Tamil Nadu Victory Association.\n\nFans of ‘Thalapathy (General)’, as Vijay is known to them, celebrated in the streets and on social media. The ruling DMK and the opposition BJP conveyed their best wishes to the actor on his new career path.\n\nA bumpy road for stars\n\nTamil Nadu has a long history of cinema stars in politics. MGR, K Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa ruled state politics for about 50 years.\n\nHowever, several stars tried their hands in recent times but not with great success.\n\nKamal Haasan started the Makkal Needhi Maiam. Rajinikanth formed the Rajini Makkal Mandram in the previous decade.\n\nWhile Kamal Haasan is still politically active, Rajinikanth abandoned politics due to health issues.\n\nVijayakanth, who passed away in December, formed the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) in 2005, became MLA twice and served as LoP during 2011-16 but power eluded him.\n\nTamil Nadu CM Stalin’s son Udaynidhi has starred in films and is a sports minister who isn’t averse to raking up controversy. He’s also the heir apparentin the DMK.\n\nCan Vijay be the disrupter?\n\nVijay, currently doing a film titled ‘GOAT’ and will do one more before he retiresfrom films for a full-time role in politics, enters politics when the AIADMK seems divided, the BJP is trying to make inroads and the DMK is attempting to cement its hold.\n\nThe question is whether he gets a starring role or will have to settle for a guest role.\n\nThe actor said administrative malpractices, corrupt political culture and a divisive political culture were obstacles to the state’s unity and progress.\n\nA statement issued by the new political party stated: “You are all aware of the current political climate. Administrative malpractices and corrupt political culture on the one hand, and a divisive political culture which strives to divide our people on the lines of caste and religion on the other hand. Everyone, especially, in Tamil Nadu is yearning for a fundamental political change that can lead to a selfless, transparent, caste-free, visionary, corruption-free and efficient administration.”\n\nJoseph Vijay Chandrasekhar, known as Vijay, is an Indian actor, dancer, playback singer and philanthropist who works predominantly in Tamil cinema and also appeared in other Indian languages films. Referred to by fans and media as “Thalapathy” (commander), Vijay is the highest paid actor in Tamil cinema. He has significant fan following globally. He has won numerous awards, including eight Vijay Awards by Star India, three Tamil Nadu State Film Awards by Government of Tamil Nadu, and a SIIMA Award. He has been included several times in the Forbes India Celebrity 100 list, based on the earnings of Indian celebrities.\n\nVijay said, “As far as I am concerned, politics is not just another profession; it is a sacred service to the people… I wish to fully immerse myself in politics for public service after completing my commitments to another film I have already committed to, without causing any disruption to party activities. This is what I consider my gratitude and duty to the people of Tamil Nadu.”\n\nReforming Bollywood: Screenwriters Seek Fairer Contracts to Improve Working Conditions\n\nCrafting stories for the big screen in India’s Bollywood can be a solitary and often financially unrewarding pursuit. The dream of landing a breakthrough project, where a screenwriter receives due credit and financial compensation, keeps many in the industry driven. However, the harsh reality is that until such a milestone is achieved, money and opportunities remain elusive, primarily due to what writers claim are unfair contracts designed to favor producers.\n\nAnjum Rajabali, a senior member of the Screenwriters Association (SWA), India’s counterpart to the Writers Guild of America (WGA), which boasts over 55,000 members nationwide, sheds light on the challenges writers face. Rajabali points to what he describes as “harsh contracts,” characterized by arbitrary termination clauses and meager fees, especially for newcomers. Furthermore, he asserts that these contracts often fail to remunerate writers for reworking drafts and grant producers the authority to determine whether a writer deserves credit for their contributions. Some agreements even go so far as to prohibit writers from seeking union intervention in the event of a dispute with the producer.\n\nRajabali, a vocal advocate for writers’ rights, emphasizes the need for change. He explains, “Most contracts have arbitrary termination clauses and offer paltry fees, especially to newcomers.” He highlights the power dynamics within the industry, stating, “They also don’t pay writers for reworking drafts and give producers the right to decide whether a writer should be credited for their work or not.” Rajabali points out the restrictive nature of some contracts, noting, “some contracts even ban writers from approaching the union if there’s a dispute with the producer.”\n\nThe SWA, a longstanding proponent of writers’ rights, has recently embarked on a more assertive approach to address the perceived imbalance of power between producers and writers. In December, the association convened a meeting to deliberate on the modifications writers desire in their contracts. Over 100 writers participated, including notable Bollywood figures such as Abbas Tyrewala and Sriram Raghavan.\n\nRajabali outlines the strategy moving forward, stating, “The plan now is to invite producers to sit across the table and work with us to make contracts more equitable.” He suggests that many producers recognize the need for improved compensation and job security for writers. The SWA’s initiative signals a shift towards collaboration, fostering a dialogue to bring about positive changes in the industry.\n\nThe BBC sought input from the Producers Guild of India regarding these concerns but, as of now, has not received a response. The industry awaits the producers’ perspective on the matter, as the conversation around fairer contracts gains momentum.\n\nThe challenges faced by Bollywood screenwriters highlight the urgent need for contract reform. The Screenwriters Association’s proactive approach and the willingness of influential writers to engage in the conversation demonstrate a collective effort to reshape the landscape of the industry. As the industry navigates these discussions, the hope is that a collaborative effort between writers and producers will lead to contracts that better reflect the contributions and rights of the creative minds behind the screenplays that captivate audiences worldwide.\n\nFirst Kali Jotta, now Buhe Bariyan, watch Punjab’s Fearless Sheroes unleash – Now streaming on ZEE5 Global’s Add-on offering in the United States\n\nGlobal, 20th December 2023: ZEE5 Global, the world’s largest streaming platform for South Asian content, has announced the addition of Buhe Bariyan in their US market, yet another hit-comedy title aimed at expanding its Add-ons content library.

She picks the cutest one, and takes it home. She spends all of her time with the goat, whom she names Barfi, after her favorite Pakistani dessert. Soon, however, she realizes that Barfi is not a pet, but a goat being raised for slaughter. She makes a plan to save Barfi’s life before he can be sacrificed on Eid. Along the way, through the help of her family and friends, she learns the true meaning of sacrifice, and the reason behind Eid al-Azha.\n\nDirector Mahnoor Euceph said: “I made this film as a love letter to the country I once called home, to the religion that taught me how to be a human with humanity, and to my family who are the beginning and end of everything. For non-Muslims, I hope this film is educational. For Muslims, I hope it is reflective. And I hope, for everyone, it is a reminder of childhood, and that magical, wondrous world we leave behind when we grow up.”\n\nEuceph is a Pakistani-American writer and director.

She graduated Summa Cum Laude from UCLA in 2017, with a major in Design | Media Arts and a minor in Film, TV, and Digital Media.
