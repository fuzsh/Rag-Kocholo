        "text": "Hello everyone! So today is A.R Rahman’s birthday! He has composed so many hit songs that were brilliant! But there have been some songs that were too good, but they didn’t make it big! So here I am going to write about the list of underrated songs by A.R Rahman!\n\nKabhi Na Kabhi\n\nThis album is a must-listen! One of the best albums I have ever come across. Each and every song is wonderful! Very brilliantly composed! Sadly this album didn’t make it big due to the movie being a flop! But I would definitely suggest you guys to listen to this album! If you don’t, then you guys are missing out on one of the best albums!\n\nOne fact about this movie is that the song ‘Mil Gayi Mil Gayi’ is the Hindi version of ‘Anjali Anjali’ from ‘Duet’ (composed by A.R Rahman). This was sung by Kumar Sanu, the first and only song he sang for A.R Rahman.\n\n2. Doli Saja Ke Rakhna\n\nAnother wonderful yet underrated album by A.R Rahman! Each songs are wonderful and heart-touching! But this again didn’t make it big due to the movie being a flop!\n\n3. Kadhalar Dhinam/Dil Hi Dil Mein\n\nAgain one of the best albums by A.R Rahman, which I thought deserved to be at the very top! Even the Hindi version of the album is as good as the original one. Especially listen to the song Ennai Villai Azhaghe/Ae Nazneen Suno Na.\n\n4. Zubeidaa\n\nOh this album is a masterpiece! Each and every song is mesmerizing! Again, this album didn’t make it big when it deserves to be at the top! But I would suggest everyone to listen to this album! It is one of the best albums by A.R Rahman.\n\n5.
