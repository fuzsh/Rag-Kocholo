        "text": "Mina-san, konnichiwa!\n\nJapan, dare I say, is by far one of the most beautiful countries in Asia with some of the finest inventions and creations. It’s safe to put out there, that we all love at least one type of dish in Japanese cuisine and partake in their national culture such as, their music, their fashion, their cosmetics, their hot springs, their well-loved cherry blossoms, scenic landscapes and traditions. The Japanese are also well-known for their hospitality, customer service and politeness as recent headlines mention that the train service providers, apologised to their commuters for being 6 seconds late. 6 seconds! Now if SMRT would kindly take some notes here…\n\nStudio Ghibli to most whom know of it, are avid fans of some of Hayao Miyazaki’s works such as Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Ponyo, Howl’s Moving Castle, and of course, My Neighbour Totoro. I remember watching my very first Studio Ghibli film – Spirited Away – back in 2001, and I fell in love with the animation despite not knowing the true meaning behind its message. The abstract narration with the subtle nuances of romance sparked a passion for animation films and nothing makes me happier than watching an animated film, for it is through them, one can fully exert their imagination into infinity and beyond.\n\nHowever, not all of Studio Ghibli’s films are romantic and dapper with fine looking male and female leads or big fuzzy creatures on whose torso a little girl could take a nap in within a lush, green forest. Released alongside My Neighbour Totoro as a double feature back in the year 1988, Isao Takahata’s film, Grave of the Fireflies, tells of the tale of two siblings who struggle to survive after becoming orphans when an air raid destroys their hometown.\n\nBased off a short story written by Nosaka Akiyuki, who in reality was separated from his family during a bombing raid, was left to care for his sixteen-month-old stepsister. She eventually passes from malnutrition whilst she was under his care. Seita however, perishes shortly after the death of Setsuko in the film and perhaps, could be seen as the author attempting to cleanse himself of the guilt and remorse that he lived on despite the death of his sister, as argued by critic Igarashi Yoshikuni mentioned in the essay of Wendy Goldberg – Transcending the Victim’s History: Takahata Isao’s Grave of the Fireflies.\n\nHollywood has produced and seen several adaptations and films based on true events of war and to name a few titles – Pearl Harbour, Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan amongst others. For the longest of times and probably till this very day, countries who went against the democratic system of government are deemed as the villains who were responsible for the losses of those in favour of democracy, overlooking that there were innocent women and children in these nations as well. One may see the work of Isao Takahata to be a film depicting Japan as a victim of history, but the film also sheds light realistically that war does not benefit anyone at all, save for the stroking of ego and a sense of pride in men.\n\nWar is devastating, costly, and a selfish act of men. Still prevalent after Japan’s surrender in-film, the Japanese were still mostly apathetic to those who suffered and suffer, as people look upon Seita’s emaciated body as he awaits death at the train station, only one lady, offers him food, however Seita doesn’t notice it, in the last few hours of his life. After the air raid obliterated their hometown, instead of relief if their houses stood, they were relieved that their houses and other buildings in town all fell together, as this puts them on equal standing in terms of loss. This brings the uniform theory into point.\n\nFormally known as the “uniform system” (seifuku seido), a sense of comradeship and group consciousnesses instilled as observed by Wendy Goldberg. Seita, who dons the uniform of the fire brigade, does not fight a single fire in the film but his uniform is deconstructed as the film goes on, and at the very end is worn down to the worn and soiled clothing of a homeless person. In the beginning of the film when the town starts to catch fire, Seita hesitates whilst Setsuko is on his back, as the film scenes follow his gaze on a body of water, a ladder, a bucket and a mop – equipment to help put out a fire if there’s one. However, he takes off after seeing that the equipment is untouched, and that there wasn’t anyone else in the vicinity putting out the fire. This act of self-preservation contradicts the uniform system, where every man is still for himself and not for everyone around him in times of crisis.\n\nThe fireflies in the film, represent the blissful ignorance, and the happiness Seita and Setsuko managed to capture before their eventual deaths. In the scene when Setsuko buries the dead fireflies, she then looks up to Seita tearfully and askes “Why do fireflies die so soon?” after she mentioned that she was digging them a grave, similar to the one her mother lay in as told by her aunt. Their mother, who was a figure of happiness in their lives, can be seen as the fireflies in the entire film, the light in the darkness who passed too quickly in lives of Seita and Setsuko in their struggle. Setsuko is also, a firefly to her elder brother Seita, as he loses all will to live after the final member of his family, passes away, gone too soon.\n\nSeita and Setsuko also portray the emotions and decision-making processes of children in different stages of their lives. Setsuko is a character no one would be able to fault, knowing full well that a toddler is unable to take care of themselves, and she, being a completely fictional character that has been animated, allows the audience to view her without prejudice or criticism against seeing a real-life toddler act as a malnourished, orphaned child. She relies on her brother Seita, to provide for her needs and is unable to fulfil them completely on her own. Setsuko however, has a grasp on how the world operates, stating that she has money (which amounts to tiny bean bags, a few yen and marbles) and when she sees the bruises Seita ia covered in after he got caught by a farmer for stealing food, she asked if it hurt, and if he needed to see a doctor.\n\nSeita, on the other hand, displayed the syndrome of an adolescent who was consumed by the propaganda and the overwhelming pride for his dad who served in the Imperial Navy. His response to Setsuko when she asked him what they will do now that their house has been burned down was that “Dad will make them pay”.\n\nUpon finding refuge at his aunt’s in Nishinomiya, he spends his days playing with Setsuko and reading manga instead of actively trying to help out in any way he can (the aunt points this out to him afterwards). He is keen and heavily reliant on the fact that Japan would succeed in the warfare and that the time of suffering was only temporary. The only knowledge Seita has of the war, is that one must simply seek protection and safety at the shelters or bunkers so that they could continue life as per normal afterwards.\n\nPerhaps, after seeing so many people afflicted from the tragedies that fell upon Japan, made the people numb to the sight of suffering, expelling any sense of empathy, only replacing it with apathy for the numbers of these people are simply too overwhelming to fully lend a hand to, and at the very end of the day, there is only so much one is willing to sacrifice to provide for the life of another, especially when everyone is determined to fend for themselves after the surrender of Japan to America and their desperation for everything to return to “normal” from the devastations of war.\n\nA farmer that has been selling Seita and Setsuko wares and food, was not inclined to provide them with food, despite Seita’s previous patronage and Setsuko’s critical condition. The camera shows a full paddy of rice that grows, whilst the farmer helps himself to fresh water and rice – a luxury the children were no longer able to afford after they moved out from their aunt’s house to stay by themselves in the shelter. He states that they wouldn’t be able to survive outside the system, and it’s best Seita apologises to her and that as a naval officer’s son, he has to stay strong and hang in there.\n\nOnce the Japanese Imperial Army and Navy had failed to bring glory to their nation, the Japanese, a prideful race, scorned their own people. The orphan’s aunt was seen praising and commenting enviously about the treatment they receive – having had their items sent to her place by truck and that they still got the good food such has pickled plums, even asking them to trade off their mother’s exquisite kimonos for to sustain themselves. Once they proved to be of no value, the people looked at them as lesser than themselves and showed no hospitality or grace towards them – as she chastised Seita for being useless during raids and indirectly asked him to seek another place of refuge by asking him to contact supposed relatives he had from his maternal side in Tokyo.\n\nThe moments that lead up to Setsuko’s death are a memory that would haunt not only Seita even as he passes on as a spirit, but also that of the audience as they have witnessed the duration of which a 4-year-old has to struggle in the name of war. Before her death, she mumbles words as she hallucinates – unable to distinguish dirt from rice in famine and anguish. “Going up, going down, it’s settled” – her weak, gentle voice has a faint echo in the quiet of the shelter. These short lines, could be interpreted as the zeitgeist of Japan before, during and after the war. “Going up” – refers to the spirit, vigour and vitality of the Imperial Army and Navy as they set out to conquer the world, “Going down” – refers to the suffrage and destruction of towns and prefectures as the Americans start to bomb Japan and finally “It’s settled” refers to the surrender of Japan and how life seemingly is “back to normal”.\n\nA montage of Seita’s memories of Setsuko follow afterwards, as she is seen playing house about the shelter whilst Seita is possibly away, attempting to gather more food and supplies to ensure their survival. One might feel strongly for the character, and think to themselves “How could the people simply stand and watch as a 4-year-old’s wilts away as her life is claimed by war?” When Seita and Setsuko are reunited in spirit, it’s bittersweet but yet a vicious memory revisited as Seita’s spirit travels back to the sites whilst he was still alive to relive those memories before telling Setsuko “it’s time to sleep”. He however does not sleep, and stares straight into the “camera” at the audience, breaking the fourth wall and bringing the animation closer to reality to showcase that this is just one out of many other instances of devastation and anguish.\n\nAlthough Isao Takahata has passed on earlier this year, the film director and producer has accumulated an incredible oeuvre during his time that would survive the trials of time and continue to reach to new audiences and tell them of the message of his stories. To quote, Bertrand Russell, he says: “War does not determine who is right – only those who are left”. The ending of the film depicts fireflies morphing into that of the skyscrapers we see today in the cityscapes of Japan, perhaps, signifying that the joy and happiness of the Japanese, now lies in its economic growth through the means of capitalism.\n\nGreetings, my dear readers!\n\nWhat a wonderful time to be alive! We’ve got metropolitan cities all over the world, a gazillion ways of fast, real-time communication with virtually, anyone and everyone, a whole lot of entertainment and wait, hey, when did we introduce China to Black Mirror?\n\nChina – a country home to more than 1.4 billion nations and known to many as the world’s fastest growing economy (before India took over earlier this quarter) and only second to the United States of America, is still developing.\n\nEver since the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, China’s economy has flourished after the introduction of foreign trade and investors, and in other sense – capitalism. Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Chongqing are some of the largest cities that are the most developed with much economic and financial interests for entrepreneurs and investors. There are so many reasons to love the success and growth. Where else in the world could I order steamboat (including the pot) in the wee hours of the night and pay for it electronically?\n\nBy the year 2020, the Social Credit System (社会信用体系) would be instilled for the entire nation. Every citizen would be assigned a “social credit” rating based on existing government data. The score adds or deducts accordingly to the economic and social contributions or deeds the citizen accumulates over time. The higher the score bracket, the better advantages there are, such as a better loan when one wants to buy a house or apply for a government position or an academic title.\n\nJia Zhangke, a Sixth-Generation filmmaker, born in 1970, has witnessed the late stages of the Cultural Revolution but more importantly – the rapid and vast developments China would undergo in the decades to come. From rural country Fenyang in Shanxi Province, Jia Zhangke left to pursue his studies at the Beijing Film Academy. A migrant himself in the lustrous capital of China, he was constantly adapting to its growth; greeted with drastic changes sometimes, such as a missing street or bus stop to make way for a new commercial or housing building.\n\nThe regions further away from these large cities, that attribute and act as key players to the economic success of China, are a stark contrast. They are often backward where the houses are still made out of stone and dirty and utilities such as proper plumbing and electricity which are common commodities are a luxury. Most of these Chinese are farmers, who toil day and night to put food on the table and make a living for themselves and their families.\n\nIn his oeuvre, Jia Zhangke often depicts the nuances of these less fortunate Chinese and their daily struggles as nationals of China – the darker side or, the underbelly of the vibrant, rich and glamourous if you will. Filmmakers from the Fifth-Generation such as Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige, have made films that criticised the actions and the rule of the parties in their time, an example being Zhang Yimou’s Raise the Red Lantern in which the government is depicted as a faceless master who has a penchant for young wives, as he continues to take in concubines in favour of a companion in her prime.\n\nPremiered at the 63rd Venice International Film Festival, Jia Zhangke won Best Film of the Golden Lion Award back in 2006, receiving limited commercial release afterwards in early 2008 in the United States. As mentioned by Ping Zhu in the author’s essay, “it is a story that even the director himself was not fully prepared for”. Consciously avoiding trips to areas near the project area of the Three Gorges Dam till he was invited artist Liu Xiaodong to shoot Dong, a documentary back in 2005, where he was greeted like a sight no other from all else he had seen. The heat, the immense amount of naked torsos as well the vast debris and collapsing buildings of Fengjie, captured the attention of Jia Zhangke.\n\nFengjie, as described on the Yangtze Cruise website, is one of the best preserved ancient counties along Yangtze River, noted for its beautiful, natural landscape and profound culture. Our lead character, whose name we only learn of about 30 minutes into the film, is a tan, stocky and robust Chinese male who has travelled all the way down from Shanxi to find his bride and now adolescent child who was taken away from him 16 years ago (that’s 1990, in-film) having bought her illegally to wed. Han Sanming had travelled more than 1100 kilometres, (equivalent to the distance between Singapore and Krabi) to be greeted by the rubble, debris and the village underwater.\n\nThe director enables the audience to peer in as the lead characters themselves are, as outsiders, into the zeitgeist of Fengjie there and then as the Three Gorges Dam project is almost complete. Jia Zhangke’s camera mimics the gaze of how a human being would, out fair into the open, looking up and down, eyes trailing to what they have just noticed.\n\nThe beautiful and mesmerising scene landscapes of Fengjie by the Yangtze River may take one’s breath away, as the background is filled with misty mountains with the smooth, reflective body of water. However, the settlement was a stark contrast; filled with signs that mark the phases of the project – indicating the water levels as they sink China’s history, heritage and livelihood further into the depths, along with the ruins of the county.\n\nApart from the human characters that tell of their stories, the debris and ruins of Fengjie as the county is destroyed and is well on its way to be fully submerged in water, act as a lead in the film as well. The physical destruction is the exterior façade of the true trauma that the people face in China. As noted by Ting Luo, the author notes that the “massive ruins have become a visible embodiment of the characters’ psychological trauma and anxiety.” Sanming, in search of the lost connection with his wife and daughter for 16 years and Shen Hong, who finds out her marriage has only been in name for the past 2 years.\n\nThe ruins accompany our main characters as well as other human subjects throughout the entire film, as Sanming works at the demolition sites whilst Shen Hong wistfully takes in the sight before her, walking through the dying county to the man who lost his arm during work at a factory whilst his wife leads a group of women in the sites to sell their bodies, an adolescent boy who sings popular songs, stretching across the different decades, to Wang Dongming’s attempt to keep track of time and history by hanging watches and clocks on a string in his apartment.\n\nMoney, is also symbolic in Still Life. Sanming is pulled to watch a magic show of sorts, where the troupe takes the opportunity to extort money from people who have just arrived in Fengjie, quoting that it was tuition fees as the master had mentioned about “intellectual property rights”. The motorcycle taxi who talks terms in Yuan (or Renminbi) is willing to take Sanming places, as long as he pays, even taking a cut from Mr. He, the hostel proprietor.\n\nApart from the actual currency of China, other components subsitute the Yuan as part of the locals’ lives and affairs. They are the 4 commodities that Jia Zhangke had highlighted in the film – cigarettes, liquor, tea and toffee. Written in a book from as early as the Song Dynasty, the Chinese deem 7 necessities in life: (開門七件事: 柴米油鹽醬醋茶) which are firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar and tea. As the times have changed as well as the habits and livelihoods, one can infer that these 4 commodities compliment the Yuan. It also highlighted the prominence of emotional value behind gestures in tough times, apart from the materialism and economical worth attached to these items.\n\nCigarettes were the first commodity shown and is one that is highly prevalent in the lives of many Chinese men. As cheap as 3 Yuan a pack, cigarettes are not only a habit but also a common form of greeting and introduction, to build rapport and socialise. Sanming is seen offering Mr. He cigarettes after he purchased some, and to Brother Mark before they were introduced to each other. When Brother Mark had passed, Sanming had used three cigarettes in place of joss sticks to pay his respects. Out of respect and courtesy, Sanming had also help light Brother Ma’s pipe and as a farewell gesture, Sanming offered his comrades cigarettes.\n\nLiquor, is drank during banquets, farewell dinners, holiday celebrations, the performing of sacrifices as well as to drown in one’s sorrows. It commemorates an instance in life, be it a joyous and auspicious one or one to put down in the books. Sanming, who is an unfamiliar in the eyes of Brother Ma who does not acknowledge the marriage for he purchased Missy Ma illegally, offers him two bottles of wine from his hometown, Shanxi. Out of respect for Brother Ma, Sanming can also be seen standing on a lower platform, removing himself of pride and ego at that point of time. However, Brother Ma curtly rejected the liquor.\n\nToasting to their new-found friendship, Brother Mark and Sanming toast to it during hearty meal at the eatery and upon revealing his departure to his comrades, they start a few round of toasts to his contribution in Fengjie, his journey back to Shanxi and the fruitful prospects of them finding work in the mines of Shanxi to earn more than they did at the demolition sites.\n\nTea, one of the 7 necessities as mentioned above, is a sign of respect and is consumed at family gatherings, weddings and is often used to show gratitude or apologise. Virtually every dwelling, even the simplest mud hut in modern culture, has a set of tea implements to brew a hot cup. It is a symbol of welcome for guests and neighbours alike.\n\nShen Hong, having arrived in Fengjie in search of her husband who disappeared on her, is left to her own devices, having travelled all the way from Beijing. Upon finding a packet of loose tea leaves in his locker and knowing no one in a foreign land, she makes herself tea to put into her bottle whilst she was at a roadside stall, welcoming herself into the dying county.\n\nToffee, the final commodity shown in Still Life, is seems symbolic in representing the beginning and end of bonds shared between the Chinese as they partake in what is possibly, a luxury before they sacrifice something in return to enjoy the moment of sweetness.\n\nBefore setting off in a lorry with other lackeys hired by Guo Bin to cause disturbance for his business rivals, Brother Mark offers Sanming toffee and promises to meet him at the eatery for dinner and drinks. But Brother Mark does not turn up, and is found dead the next day when Sanming hears his ringtone in a pile of rubble and discovers his corpse.\n\nMissy Ma, offers him a toffee after he promised her captor that he would pay off her brother’s debt of 30, 000 Yuan so that she could live a free woman and start afresh with him as his wife before he makes his way back to Shanxi to toil in the mines, future unknown.\n\nAnother symbolism instilled by Jia Zhangke into Still Life, are the frames of which Sanming and Shen Hong are seen gazing out from in various scenes of the film. As outsiders to Fengjie, the director provokes the audience who maybe foreigners and outsiders to the plight of these Chinese to peer into what may be the bigger picture and what is at stake in the frame.\n\nThe background, is often very detailed (what is framed) whereas Sanming and Shen Hong often stand in bleak, vast empty spaces which may denote the rest of China and the world who are in the dark of the sufferings of the people who are affected by these circumstances. When an glowing UFO enters from the scene Sanming gazes in and exits out of the scene Shen Hong’s eyes follow it, it mirrors the plight of these Chinese. Most of them who are powerless against what is happening around them, are only able to look at the surroundings and accept their fate – history, memories, livelihoods submerged under hundreds of meters of water.\n\nThe beauty of visual arts is not only the work of the artist, but also the perception of its audience and viewers. There would be admiration, critique, contemplation, lamentation and perhaps, an aching sense of relatability towards it. We’re all familiar with how the times of a society and its culture shapes the works these artists produce. The world may continue to admire China for its immense growth but worry and critique the nation as most governments around the world are mostly democratic. Jia Zhangke offers a fresh perspective and a new meaning to contemporary cinema to the world, as he does not highlight the success of the country but the devastating effects and the costs it has on those who are unable to keep up with the ever-changing world and the demands it begets.\n\n–. .-. . . – .. -. –. … –..– / -.. . .- .-. / .-. . .- -.. . .-. … !\n\n(Greetings dear readers!)\n\nWhat obtains in the world is that the eye sees that the wick and the light exist in the same time-relations. But the light always depends on the wick, but the wick does not depend on the light.\n\n– Nirvana Sutra, Verse Z26\n\nA month before the release of Infernal Affairs back in 2002, I had the opportunity of exploring the city. I was eight at that time – amused that people experienced winter without snow and the incredible love for milk tea and noodle soup with luncheon meat served at the local eateries. To top it off, I had the nerve wrecking experience of getting stranded in Ocean Park with a few hundred Hong Kong dollars in my pocket when my guardians, a pair of lovers, argued and left me to my own devices. It was through sheer will, courage and basic conversational Mandarin (accompanied with sobs) that enabled me to ask for help from a staff mending a snack kiosk.\n\nHong Kong – The very first of the Four Asian Tiger Economies back in the 1950s, Hong Kong flourished in the wake of post-war industrialisation. Chinese immigrants hailing from states such as Guangzhou, Guangdong and Shenzhen sought refuge and likelihood in the more neutral land of Hong Kong, away from the Chinese Civil War.\n\nHowever, the transfer of sovereignty that happened on the 1st of July 1997 would topple Hong Kong’s economy with almost immediate effect. Her economy suffered and faced multiple setbacks due to the Asian Financial crisis as well as the virus outbreaks of H5N1 (avian flu) as well as SARS. A housing policy triggered a housing market crisis, which still affects the people of Hong Kong up till today as prices for property in the country are the world’s highest to date. These trying times affected the film industry, drastically decreasing its output.\n\nFilm has exerted a highly influential role over most of our lives, from our frequenting of movie theatres to catch the latest Hollywood blockbuster, to fond memories of “old but gold” movies from Netflix. It has also shaped our minds both consciously and subconsciously, from the cool, unmoved temperament of a psychopath killer, to an American’s journey of self-discovery exploring the wonders of India through food and yoga after a divorce.\n\nFilms can also be seen as the portrayal of the current times or how history has shaped the society today. The “2012 phenomenon”, which predicted the world’s ending in that year following the Mayan calendar, caused a huge international debacle, and inspired the eventual release of the movie 2012. Our incessant fear and curiosity of extra-terrestrial life and mythical beasts has also caused an influx of movies such as Stephen Chow’s CJ7 and Mermaid.\n\nThe messages of cinema are often seemingly biased at times, showing only the good or the ugly, but rarely adopting a neutral stance unless it is a film of cinema vérité. Even then, the film is subjected to characteristics of auteur and the reception of the audience towards the message. Take, for example, South Korean romantic-comedy 200 Pounds of Beauty, in which the female lead loses weight to be deemed as beautiful in the eyes of society as the ideal woman and partner – which showcases that society is not receptive of a curvier woman that has a little extra.\n\nNo stranger to films portraying the dealings of secret triad societies from his time as cinematographer for the film series Young and Dangerous, Andrew Lau has teamed up with Alan Mak to co-direct and produce the Infernal Affairs trilogy starring Heavenly King of Cantopop – Andy Lau, internationally renowned actors Tony Leung Chiu-Wai and Anthony Wong as well as fan favourite master of ceremonies and comedian, Eric Tsang. The duo had also casted Cantopop stars Sammi Cheng and Kelly Chen as love interests of the main leads.\n\nInfernal Affairs, a crime-thriller film trilogy, seeks to describe and present Hong Kong to the world in the stylistic manner of city-in-text by the means of a blockbuster hit that would eventually garner international favour. In 2006, a remake of the film directed by Martin Scorsese was released in Hollywood. Titled The Departed, it featured leading film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg amongst other celebrities.\n\nIn the post-modern society of the world, organised crime is no new phenomenon with gangs dating back to the early 1900s. The Mafia of Italy, the gangs of Chicago, the Yakuza of Japan, the rowdies of India and, the secret triad societies (黑社會) mainland China and Hong Kong. Infiltrating popular culture, a video games titled Sleeping Dogs was released in 2012, based its storylines and the main antagonist group and thugs Sun on Yee on real-life secret triad Sun Yee On and its members. Back in the day, it was also estimated that 1 in every 6 Hong Kong Citizen belonged to a triad.\n\nThe zeitgeist and status quo are depicted by that of a modernised Hong Kong: her struggles of high crime rates as well as the constant efforts of the police force. Cultivating themes of crime, thriller, drama and tragedy, filled with suspense, Infernal Affairs is but one amongst many other films and televised series produced in Hong Kong. Featuring lush, clear skies with big, fluffy white clouds and a comfortable, well-to-do lifestyle of an ideal middle-class salary worker in Hong Kong, Infernal Affairs is a highly-romanticised showcase of Hong Kong back in 2002, albeit being accurate in most part.\n\nIn the first installation of Infernal Affairs, Yan (Tony Leung Chiu-Wai) goes undercover under the supervision of Superintendent Wong (Anthony Wong) and then Police Cadet Academy Principal to infiltrate the different triads, working their way up to the main perpetrator; Brother Sam (Eric Tsang) who has his own informer; Inspector Lau (Andy Lau). Andrew Lau and Alan Mak have implemented the methods of a classic narrative, with a clear sequence of cause and effect.\n\nThe actions of the characters in the film affect the situations, eliciting emotions and reactions when interacting with one another. Events of the storyline happen in natural time of the course of events that happens stretch for an entire week. The film is a critical chase of cat and mouse, as Superintendent Wong and Brother Sam race against the clock to outdo the other to find who is the mole in their respective organisations.\n\nLike any other metropolitan city, Hong Kong is known for its cityscape and skyline of skyscrapers and infrastructure. As famous as the confrontation of Yan and Lau is on the rooftop of a high-rise building, rooftops also note the film’s plot as beginning, climax and resolution. After approximately 10 years of undercover, Yan has finally infiltrated the gang of Brother Sam and earned his mark as a trusted lackey, who reveals that the next shipment is due next week to Superintendent Wong in the beginning. In the next time they meet, the film arrives at a point of tension – as Wong realises that in continuing on, the safety of Yan would be jeopardised and possibly result in his death. Lastly, when Yan reveals his intentions of turning Lau in as a mole for Brother Sam’s gang all this time as its resolution; cuing the impending fate or doom of the characters.\n\nThe zeitgeist of Infernal Affairs can also be further interpreted as such – Hong Kong possesses society deeply rooted in the religion of Buddhism, and it is shown to be no different for the secret triads, as the opening scenes are that of Brother Sam initiating his newest gang members at a temple by drinking up with them in front of the statues of Buddha and other deities. An intertitle before the scenes presents a verse from the Nirvana Sutra to their audiences, about Continuous Hell – the worst of all Eight Hells. Yan, who goes undercover and into the underworld, is also seen participating in gang initiations afterwards, offering incense in a dimly lit room to deities, swearing him into the gang.\n\nSeen as the film’s status quo, serving in the police force is seemingly, a highly recognised career choice in Hong Kong; upholding justice, restoring law and order, whilst ridding the streets of criminals, and putting a halt to their illegal activities. Lau, who has risen the ladder with great success over the years is seen as a positive specimen of capitalism – being able to afford sophisticated audio equipment, paid for by a credit card, driving a luxurious SUV, moving into a large, spacious apartment which can afford to accommodate an ottoman larger than what Mary (Sammi Cheng), his finance, had assumed it to be when she had it measured as well as the opportunity to play golf with the Board atop a rooftop, overlooking Hong Kong.\n\nYan, in contrast, is seen to have strikingly different fate as an undercover cop “expelled” from the police academy. Without opportunities to maintain close relations with anyone but triad members, social ties to his community are severely limited, costing him deeper relationships – revelations of romantic feelings for Doctor Lee compel him to leave, while his ex-girlfriend Mary left him, despite carrying his child. He doesn’t vie for a promotion for his servitude, but merely an identity, to continue his life from there on out.\n\nInfernal Affairs also highlight the clean cut, no-frills fashion sense of the people of Hong Kong as the main cast are clad in well-fitted coats and blazers, decked in neutral colours, a classic analogue watch as a gift as well as the technological advances they have achieved back in the day. For instance, well Lau quickly inserted a telecommunications card into his laptop, narrowing down Brother Sam’s mobile amongst 50 others to send him a text, warning him about a stooge.\n\nThe age-old method of communication of Morse code, was also a strong point in this film – as it was first used between Superintendent Wong and Yan, in which Lau starts to study to find out who is the mole and then using it to communicate with Yan himself, to exploit Brother Sam. It could also be seen as a motif right from the start of the film, when a younger Yan could be seen tapping his finger against his pant sleeve when they were interviewing him in the Police Cadet Academy that Superintendent Wong and Yan were mainly communicating through means Morse code when they were apart.\n\nDespite the film’s vastly apparent cool-toned hues, the film takes upon a warmer setting when Yan and Lau are seen interacting with their love interests, Doctor Lee and Mary respectively, signifying the less calculative and more genuine intentions of their hearts and minds.\n\nAndrew Lau and Alan Mak’s piece is straightforward, never allowing themselves to digress too far from the main storyline despite its subtle nuances that foretell of a character’s supposed past or future with regards to the film. The scenes are symbolic and like any well woven story; one can see the beginning of the thread and it end. Mary’s progress with her novel, from the time she ideates when they were moving into their new apartment, to her own plot twist when she determines the character who has 28 personalities is now a good guy, despite having done bad deeds before. At the very end, she does not confront Lau directly about his dealings with the triad but speaks to him in terms of her novel – how she is unable to finish it (perhaps a nod at their relationship) and she is confused as to if her character is a good person or a bad person and only he himself knows; a reference to Lau. Or, how Yan would come to make use of the tape recordings Brother Sam possesses against Lau and he realised Lau is the mole when he discovered the manila envelope he wrote on amongst his other files on his desk.\n\nPerhaps the allure of cinema lies in the ease of watching a fictitious story unfold, as opposed to the stories we face in reality – the story does not affect us directly, but only for the duration of the film and moments after as we continue to contemplate its meaning and message to its audience. Infernal Affairs may have been a blockbuster hit highly anticipated by a star-studded cast and an intriguing tale. However, it succeeds in shedding light on many of Hong Kong’s deep-seated issues, such as housing, from astronomical rent rates in a high-density city, where people are forced to the rooftops for privacy, to personal safety. The film lends insight into the continuous presence of secret triad societies and the mental toll and hazard an undercover cop has to endure whilst he goes through operation after operation to aid his fellow colleagues, who are in a safer position than his own, to serve his cause of nabbing perpetrators.\n\n各位讀者們，你好!\n\n(Greetings, dear readers!)\n\nHaving explored the dark, thought-evoking cinemas of South Korea, and then the vibrant, bustling scenes of Bollywood from India, we’ve now made our way into the vast and extensive cinema of the Chinese.\n\nChina’s economy has seen tremendous growth since the late 1980’s till now and in terms of ranking, China is now second only to the United States. The political climate of China has also affected the cinema industry over the years, and the insurgence of the Fifth Generation of film directors brought about a wave of films that expressed their experience of the Cultural Revolution back in the day and their stance against feudal patriarchy. The films often showcased distinct clashes in values, and the adversities the common man faced back in the day.\n\nThe works of Zhang Yimou, a Fifth-Generation film director, has garnered much attention and criticism ever since his debut in 1987 titled Red Sorghum. Gong Li, who was the female lead (and the female lead in most of the films during that time) would star in 6 more of Zhang Yimou’s films over the years, including Ju Dou – a tragedy period drama, that tells of a young bride purchased by a sadistic and sterile cloth dyer who falls for his nephew, who derived pleasure from scopophilia when he chanced upon a hole he could peep from as she bathed. The pair soon start an affair and she bears his child and the consequences of their entwining enfold.\n\nHero, a wuxia pian, was released in 2002. It was one of the most expensive films made during its time and also, Zhang Yimou’s biggest project by far. Featuring international Chinese stars Jet Li, Tony Leung Chiu-Wai, Maggie Cheung, Zhang Ziyi and Donnie Yen, Hero soon became an international hit after its release in the United States in 2004.\n\nThroughout the film director’s oeuvre, Zhang Yimou’s role as an auteur is most apparent through his usage of symbolism by the means of colour; an integral part of his misc-en-scène, slow motion and the mesmerising panoramic shots of nature scenes, as well as his prowess for establishing shots that resemble the paintings from ancient times. Alongside cinematographer Christopher Doyle who had worked on several of Wong Kar-wai’s films, Zhang Yimou has produced a sempiternal piece, of moving work of art.\n\nThe film is narrated by Nameless (無名), who converses with the King of Qin (秦王) afterwards in his court when he had been invited to drink with the King after having defeated three assassins, two of which who had stormed his court previously in attempt to assassinate him. Having done so, Nameless, an prefect previously unheard of from a small province, gains the privilege of proximity from the King, sitting a mere 10 paces away from him.\n\nHowever, as the story unfolds, it is revealed to have three plots, only one of which is true. The first, was crafted by Nameless and told of an exaggerated tale about his victories, the second, was a hypothesis by the King based on his personal encounter with Broken Sword (殘劍) and Flying Snow (飛雪). The third is then revealed to be the truth, as Nameless corrects the King, telling him that he had underestimated Broken Sword, and that all three assassins including Long Sky (長空), were accomplices and were still alive.\n\nThe storyline of the film, dialogues between characters, character development as well as its delivery, showcased Zhang Yimou’s growth as a film director and perhaps, even his change of direction in his deliverables – from independent films that criticised the Chinese government and its systems through tasteful means of storytelling and character portrayal, to lucrative commercial successes in favour of the same government, to work on his craft at a larger scale. As written in an essay by Chen Xihe, one may interpret Hero as “a drama about Chinese contemporary society, and as an effort of using contemporary mass culture to rebuild the father figure (Chinese government), as well as a response to contemporary life”.\n\nAlthough Christopher Doyle and Zhang Yimou “insist the choice of colours was aesthetic, not symbolic” as per a New York Times article, one can deduct from a personal point of view, that the colours other than misc-en-scène, are representative of how the characters portray one another and how they were perceived as such.\n\nColour is part of the language we speak with film. We use colours to articulate different feelings and moods. I believe the meanings of different colours are universal but different cultures can interpret them in different ways.\n\n– Vittorio Storaro\n\nBlack was the very first colour in the film – denoting the seniority, power and the formalities of the King of Qin and his court as well as military might. With little information or interaction of characters except for the dialogue that goes on between Nameless and the King of Qin in his court, one can say that black also depicts mystery as the plot unfolds.\n\nAmidst the grey and blue tones of water and stone, Long Sky was seen wearing brown garments which could mean endurance – for his penchant of playing Ancient Go (Chess) and being able to fight 7 guards by himself before facing Nameless.\n\nThe vibrant hues of red was definitely a sight to remember, as it showcased the affairs of Flying Snow who supposedly had an affair with Long Sky (who is not shown after his ‘defeat’), cheating on Broken Sword who sleeps with his disciple Moon (如月) out of spite. Who then stabs him in the quiet hours of night as he made his way back to his room, stirring up an taste of revenge from Moon who Flying Snow defeats with ease. Red can be seen to symbolise many emotions and characteristics such as love, passion, energy, desire, anger, aggression and blood.\n\nBlue was the colour used when the King of Qin spoke of his hypothesis to Nameless and featured splendid panoramas of calm lakes and flowering trees, as Nameless and Broken Sword engage in a swordfight in the depths of their minds. Blue, depicts unity and harmony of the bond the King of Qin assumed the lovers to have as well as their loyalty, confidence and trust they have for one another.\n\nChristopher Doyle had used the colour green to symbolise memories or recollections as he did in In The Mood for Love but that it was a personal choice above anything else. However, green can be seen as the youth of Broken Sword and Flying Snow as well as their inexperience and vigour – pursuing the King for vengeance because of the death of her father, before Broken Sword came to the conclusion that the King, must not be assassinated.\n\nThe final scenes consisted of Nameless and the King of Qin in his black court, where his subordinates, guards and soldiers were fully clad in black, save for the feathers coloured red and white decorating their helms, contrasted against the warm sandy plateaus of the desert where the lovers, clad in white engage in a swordfight.\n\nOn a personal level, I perceived this as Yin and Yang as the events happen simultaneously, where there must always be a balance between good and evil as Nameless decides that he shall not assassinate the King of Qin, having reflected upon the words that Broken Sword had written in the sands of the desert for him – 天下, which means “Our Land”. In order to do good, there is also the deeds of evil; sacrifices had to be made even if it meant bloodshed – as per what Broken Sword realised of the King of Qin’s goal of uniting the kingdoms of China.\n\nAs one is visually captivated and mesmerised by the stunning cinematography and techniques employed by Zhang Yimou, the auteur, the audiences of Hero are also in for a delight musically. Composed by Tan Dun who worked on Ang Lee’s Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon prior to Hero, Tan Dun, impressed by the heroism in the story, reflected the flavours of northern China, working around the theme of romanticism and profoundness. Tan Dun transformed a violin by replacing its original strings with the silk strings of a sanxian (a traditional Chinese three-stringed plucked instrument) to create the sounds of the Orient.\n\nThe two violins used to composed the scores were dubbed yin and yang by Tan Dun, and it also symbolised the heroines in Hero, Flying Snow and Moon being the yin violin, whilst the yang violin which was restrung, for the heroes, Nameless and Broken Sword. Typically, the guqin is played when people played Go (Chess) in Ancient China and this could be heard accompanied with that of a violin during the scenes of Long Sky, the 7 guards and his duel with Nameless. Energetic drumbeats heightened the action scenes whenever the King’s troops were present, as they chanted “Storm! Storm! Storm!” before their attack, symbolising the waging of war as done so during the Warring States Period in Ancient China.\n\nThrough these means of execution of his craft, Zhang Yimou has established his position as auteur, making “trademarks” for himself in the industry. One, may now easily distinguish the film director’s work by simply viewing the film as how one would be able to identify with the works of Tim Burton, John Woo, James Cameron and Stephen Chung to name a few.\n\nLike the prestige of Chinese calligraphy, painting and the rich history of China, Zhang Yimou’s film Hero, would stand to be a film to be enjoyed and appreciated by the generations to come over the next few decades. Zhang Yimou has indeed grown as a film director and is truly able to understand his audience with this exemplary film that depicts the honour and pride a Chinese has for their nation in contemporary China, society and culture.\n\nNobody can slow the candle of life that is protected by God himself\n\nNamaste, my dear readers!\n\nThis very week, we traverse the beautiful, the heroic, the majestic, the glorious, the magnificent and ever so spicy Indian cinema industry and specifically – Bollywood. Indian is the world’s seventh largest country and with the world’s second largest population, it’s no small feat producing creative content for the masses of India.\n\nA country rich with creativity and an extremely vibrant culture that embraces diversity, it is no wonder that people all over the world are able to enjoy Bollywood films as much as the locals they were crafted for. Watching an Indian film is truly a stunningly, colourful affair.\n\nOm Shanti Om is a comedic Hindi melodrama that centres around the theme of romance. Living up to the ever-popular term – a masala film, it is filled with the genres of love, laughter, drama, action and revenge. With a star-studded cast featuring the “King of Bollywood” Shah Rukh Khan who was a producer of a film himself alongside film director Farah Kahn, Om Shanti Om is a stunning piece that relishes in the dreamy wonders of Bollywood whilst embracing its ugliness. A decade into its success, the film is now a cult favourite and has even adapted into a musical in Japan.\n\nWhen I wake in the morning before stepping on the marble floor, a servant will slip on velvet slippers for me. And the other servant? He’ll help me wear a silk robe just like Raj Kumar’s. The third one will be waiting to serve me juice.\n\n– Om Prakash\n\nWith inside jokes about the industry and of Om Shanti Om itself when Om asks who the director of the film and a jump-cut shot revealed Farah Kahn, to the parts where they depict how a privileged son (Om Kapoor) behaves in the industry having inherited wealth and popularity from his father Rajesh Kapoor, to the glorious prospects of fame and fortune desired by the greedy who would destroy anything that stands in their way as acted out by Arjun Rampal as Mukesh Mehra.\n\nThe title derives from the first names of the main hero and heroine in the film. Om from Om Prakash Makhija and Shanti from Shantipriya. Om Shanti Omis also a mantra that means “peace for all living and non-living things, the universe and everything in the cosmic manifestation”. Seemingly apt, as one may perceive to be able to attain peace from finding love or the peace of a vengeful soul/spirit that has been avenged – as Shanti is seen running towards the light at the very end of the film.\n\nAn unfinished story should always start from the point it was left off, right?\n\n– Om Kapoor\n\nThe recipe, save for a few tweaks here and there are: a charming, ambitious hero with big dreams with a supportive friend and a doting mother, a drop dead gorgeous heroine with a killer smile, a charismatic, devious villain is often quintessential in a Bollywood film cast, all of whom were present in Om Shanti Om.\n\nThe adoration and ardour Om possesses for Shanti is endearing as seen through his soliloquy in the beginning of the film as he takes off from home to look for his “girlfriend by the bridge”; a large billboard of Shantipriya’s latest film at the time – Dreamy Girl.\n\nSome may classify a Bollywood film equivalent to that of Hollywood’s musical film, but the former differs in technique, choreography, misc-en-scène and editing. Om Shanti Om comprises of 7 songs, 5 of which are song-and-dance sequences tastefully choreographed by Farah Kahn herself, having had prior experience. With a large supporting dance crew and multiple elaborate costume changes, the scenes are often shot at a stationary position at a wide angle to fit everyone and the dance moves are easy to replicate by someone keen on dancing as their favourite heroes and heroines did in the films.\n\nThis is contrasted by Hollywood’s musical, say Singin’ in the Rain for example, where Gene Kelly is alone on the streets of Los Angeles, dancing in the rain whilst singing his piece. When shot as a group, anyone in the picture at that moment has a line in the song be it as a main or as a supporting vocalist and the cast often interacts with their surroundings.\n\nOften, films would contain one “item” song – which would then be used to market the movie to create hype and interest amongst the targeted audiences. These “item” songs are usually commercialised and would feature the heroes and heroes, scantily clad and sexualised with a diverse dance crew such as the number – Dard E Disco which featured a swanky, topless Shah Rukh Khan and his washboard abs. This particular piece in Om Shanti Om, could also be seen as an escape from the narrative after the audience was hit with the tragic deaths of Om and Shanti.\n\nThe song Deewangi Deewangi in Om Shanti Om, on the other hand, paid homage to the Bollywood industry and its stars, featuring 31 of them apart from Shah Rukh Khan himself. Each hero and heroine were presented with a hamper of gifts for their time taken off for the cameo appearance. The heroines were also allowed to keep their outfits, specially designed for them by famous Indian fashion designer, Manish Malhotra.\n\n“I’ve tried to get you with all my heart. So much so, that the universe has conspired to bring you to me.”\n\n– Om Prakash\n\nThe films of Bollywood also frequently demonstrate the use of non-diegetic sound during melodramatic scenes which may represent the emotions of the actors and actresses, such as how a romantic love ballad played when Om saw Shanti for the very first time in-person at the premiere of Dreamy Girl, when Sandy is revealed to be the doppelganger of Shanti the same song plays in the background when the pair lock eyes. A sad ballad of heartbreak starts to play in the background as Om walks absentmindedly onto the studio and its various sets after overhearing Shanti’s conversation with Mukesh in her dressing room.\n\nOne may also perceive the storyline of Om Shanti Om to take the shape of an hourglass. The first hour of the film is spent on character development and the backstory of the plot with a tragic ending before Om’s reincarnation as Om Kapoor, in which the film slows down and escapes from the main storyline with a bit of filler, comedic scenes and humour and for the last one hour of the film, the film builds up to its climax as Om plots to force the truth out of Mukesh – how he had brutally murdered Shanti, the woman he was married to in private before reaching the catharsis of the film right at the end when Shanti’s death is avenged.\n\nAll in all, Om Shanti Om is truly a fine masala film, one for every occasion. Its catchy and upbeat song-and-dance sequences evoke emotion through the energetic dance moves of the hero and heroine with its beautiful lyrics as in the ballads Aankhon Mein Teri and Main Agar Kahoon. The storyline is fresh and interesting and if one is familiar with the Indian cinema’s penchant for overexaggerated action scenes and melodramatic storytelling, they would be able to note that Om Shanti Omhas managed to balance all these genres out. Not too religious, violent, sappy or melancholic, Farah Kahn’s masterpiece will be able to withstand time and connect with audiences of the future generations exposed to the classics of Bollywood.\n\nTill next time my dear readers!\n\nGreetings, dear reader!\n\nIn last week’s post – we dissected The Host by Bong Joon-ho and his beautifully engineered fish mutation powered by CGI. In this week’s post, we uncover and shed light onto the mesmerizing brutality of Oldboy by highly-acclaimed South Korean director, Park Chan-wook. (Legendary American director, Quentin Tarantino has said he is amongst some of his favourite directors!)\n\nPark Chan-wook’s Oldboy released in 2003, has transcended and performed well above the standards of South Korean cinema and I dare say, Hollywood itself. 15 years later, the film’s content and storytelling has not aged, despite perhaps the technology used in the film to define its zeitgeist realistically. Oldboy is a beautiful allusion, and a thorough, neo-noir action film, seeking out the darker side of humanity whilst exploring vengeance, the carnal desires of men and the motivation of desperation.\n\nRemember this: Be it a rock or a grain of sand, in water they sink as the same.\n\n– Lee Woo-jin\n\nOldboy is the second film in a series titled The Vengeance Trilogy – all of which are directed and co-written by Park Chan-wook. The film runs for 120 minutes and takes the audience on a journey of a man’s revenge and his search for answers behind the reason of his 15-year imprisonment by his captor(s). The director has caught the attention of other directors on a global scale – Spike Lee directed a remake of Oldboy in 2013 himself and was well-received at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. Throughout its run time, Oldboy is loaded with nuances and ambiguous details that are more than often left for the audience to interpret.\n\nRevenge is probably good for your health. But… what happens after you’ve had revenge? I bet that hidden pain probably emerges again.\n\n– Lee Woo-jin\n\nFrom the way the film opened with Dae-su, tightly holding on to a man’s tie whilst he clutches his white furry companion, the audience has been conditioned to think and analyse what goes on in the rest of Oldboy. As the plot unfolded, it offered more than one outlook to the story, noting a puzzle plot and forking paths. A fan favourite would be the ending of the film, where it is ambiguous if Oh Dae-su got rid of the monster in him or continues to live with it albeit a missing tongue. (Personally, I don’t think the hypnosis worked all too well) The director had even included a red herring – the supposed remote-control Lee Woo-jin bribed his doctor for an additional USD$100, 000 on top of his surgery.\n\nSome characters, caught in certain pure optical and sound situations, find themselves condemned to wander about or go off on a trip.\n\n– Gilles Deleuze, French Philosopher, Cinema 2: The Time Image\n\nAs per the theories of Deleuze, one can interpret the movie as a montage of Oh Dae-su’s life within that time span. Park Chan-wook had exempted scenes that could have possibly been dismissed as fillers, mundane or dull shots and packed the entire film with vignettes – as each segment of the film reveals the larger plot. Apart from vignettes, the director filmed the majority Oldboy with the techniques of montage such as jump cuts right from the beginning when Dae-su was held at the police station, scenes that had dissolve editing i.e. Mi-do’s personal flashback of her hallucination of an ant riding the same subway carriage as herself and then blending back to the present as Mi-do wipes away tears on her face with her sleeve.\n\nApart from film techniques which attributed to its unconventional storytelling, Park Chan-wook’s tale of a man breaks societal norms. A 15-year sentence in a prison that resembled a deluxe hotel room and the extensive use of drugs such as Valium and sodium barbiturate makes the audience ponder as to how affluential and wealthy the captor of Oh Dae-su might actually be at the beginning. The actions of Oh Dae-su before, during and after his period of entrapment also delivered raw, unhinged traits of human nature and when you have no one else to talk to… the television becomes your world.\n\nThe TV is both a clock and a calendar. It’s your school, your home, your church, your friend… and your lover. But… my lover’s song is too short.\n\n– Oh Dae-su\n\n… And the list goes on. Very prominently and distinctively, Park Chan-wook has made use of three mainstay colours in his film – red, green and purple/violet. Apart from the strong denotation of chiaroscuro, the colour psychology of these colours used in the film lend to the emotions, mood and misc-en-scène of the scenes.\n\nFrom the big red arrow painted on the road, the painting that hung in Dae-su’s hotel-prison room-cell, Mi-do’s red lips, the lining of Dae-su’s blazer, the interior of the sushi restaurant, Mi-do’s clothes, the hotel room they sought refuge in and in each other, the red shirt Dae-su changes into before he confronts his captor, Lee Woo-jin to Mi-do’s furry red ensemble in the snow at the end amongst many more red motifs – these represent Dae-su’s desires, rage and energy throughout the film.\n\nMost of the time, the film’s scenes are heavily tinted in green, denoting the monotony of Dae-su’s search and the repetitiveness it brings about such as his hunt for the fried dumplings he ate during imprisonment. Sometimes, the scenes contrast against the colour red, as seen when Dae-su and Mi-do are in the same space. This could be interpreted as his passion for her and that she brings about excitement in his mundane life.\n\nThe colour purple/violet belongs to no other than antagonist, Lee Woo-jin. As per the umbrella of the mysterious person who kidnapped Dae-su, the handkerchief Woo-jin uses, to the clues and gift boxes Woo-jin sends in Dae-su’s way. The colour’s definition in this film can be noted as nobility – Woo-jin’s wealth and status, his cruelty and his mourning for the loss of his sister, Lee Soo-ah.\n\nApart from colour, very strikingly, Park Chan-wook had filled every space possible with geometric prints. In many different shapes and patterns. Noting diegesis, Park Chan-wook had subtly hinted the continuous condition of posthypnotic suggestion via the song “The face I miss” such as the ringtone of Dae-su’s mobile phone, the song his television lover sang when he attempted to find release, when the Valium gas was released and when Mi-do sang in the car in which had enabled Dae-su to fall in love with Mi-do with ease as he would associated her with desire, passion and a resting place.\n\nEven though I’m no more than a monster, don’t I too, have the right to live?\n\n– Unnamed man/Oh Dae-su\n\nSeeing as the protagonist and antagonist were in high school when Lee Soo-ah commited suicide at the dam, one could interpret the duration of Dae-su’s imprisonment as the age of Soo-ah when she passed – 15 years. Lee Woo-jin lost his sister at the tender age of 15 and made sure Dae-su repaid his debt by missing out on his life and his daughter 15 years, before carrying out the rest of his twisted game. Although by doing so, Lee Woo-jin had also imprisoned himself as seen by his living conditions – his penthouse where he lives, eats, breathes and handles his business transactions. Woo-jin also preferred to playback surveillance videos of Dae-su during his sentence rather than sleep, as he was “lonely”.\n\nDo I really talk too much?\n\n– Oh Dae-su\n\nThese are amongst some of the most notable interpretations I have derived from the film (which I thoroughly enjoyed). Park Chan-wook’s film is definitely a must-watch for all film enthusiasts and anyone interested in film, as this is definitely one of the hallmarks of Asian cinemas that could hold its place alongside film titles such as The Godfather, Fight Club, Pulp Fiction and more. I hope you’ve enjoyed reading my interpretation of this beautifully abstract film. I’d love to hear your thoughts about the film too, so leave a comment if you’d like!\n\nTill next time!\n\nA callous American pathologist who demanded the drainage of 200 bottles of formaldehyde, a heroic American marine who loses his arm in efforts to quell the aquatic mutation and an American military doctor with a lazy eye to orders a lobotomy on a supposedly “afflicted” innocent.\n\nThe Host is disguised as satire, but actively mocks the then South Korean government who was heavily reliant on the intervention of the U.S government since the Korean War. Surpassing the duration of a hit multiplexes that average around 90 to 100 minutes, The Host is a melodramatic monster film spanning over the time of 119 minutes. Bong Joon-ho also managed to squeeze in several comical moments, the main contributor being character Park Gang-du. (Also, what was with the aged soundtrack that sounded like it was better off in a film from the 1950s?)\n\n“The Han River is very broad, Mr. Kim. Let’s try to be broad-minded about this.” – American pathologist\n\nOne could interpret the status quo of the film to be a representation of the director’s views of the South Korean government back then. The nation is seen to be meekly following the directions of the American military when encountering the crisis, and was negligent towards the citizens and their well-being, showcasing little to no empathy. The zeitgeist defines South Korea as a docile and compliant country back in the day, obedient to the orders and directions given out by the American military and government.\n\nThe star of this movie, in my opinion, was neither the sloppy, dim-witted anti-hero Park Gang-du or his well-loved pre-teen daughter Hyun-seo, but the beautifully clumsy, monstrous fish with webbed limbs, well equipped with a serpent’s tail. Bong Joon-ho’s realistic interpretation of the mutation addressed the little nuances that are usually omitted, placing emphasis on the thrill instead. The monster was clumsy, but showcased intelligence in instances when it sneaked up on the Park family whilst they were in the snack-bar and feigned to be asleep whilst Hyun-seo tried to escape from its hideout in the sewers.\n\nKeen observation would reveal that Bong Joon-ho wastes no time in his film. The director incorporates a wide range of elements in his shots, showcasing much artistic flair and technical expertise in his monster film hit. From the monster’s graceful plunge into the water, to the bewildered expression of Hyun-seo right before the monster grabs her with its tail, the hallucination of the Park family around the table in the snack bar as they fill their stomachs, the aggressive contrast of red floors against the white sheets and cool steel during Gang-du’s lobotomization and the stark and finally, the white blanket of snow that fell near the grounds of the Han River.\n\nOverall, the misc-en-scéne of the film was established with low-key lighting or chiaroscuro, as the dark environments created by elements of weather, the dark, treacherous sewers or the dimly lit interior of the Park snack-bar, helped set the mood of a city in a state of confusion and despair.\n\nRight from the opening scenes of The Host, Bong Joon-ho’s penchant for leitmotifs could be seen throughout the entire film. Se-joo, who tried to steal from a sleeping Gang-du, would eventually be protected by Hyun-seo and then adopted by Gang-du at the end of the film. The appearance and usage of beer cans in the film as well – from the time Gang-du offers Hyun-seo a can of beer whilst watching Nam-joo’s competition on television to the point where Hyun-seo throws a can of beer at the monster (who had regurgitated it amongst other ghastly things into its hideout) to check if it was sound asleep, so she could make her escape. Another leitmotif was when Nam-il passed out with his mobile phone in his hand after texting Nam-joo, Hyun-seo’s location in the sewers who then passed out with her mobile phone in her hand as well, when she tried to confront the monster under the bridge with bow and arrow, in the middle of a phone call with Gang-du.\n\n“Have any of you heard it? The heartbreak of a parent who has lost a child. When a parent’s heart breaks, the sound can travel for miles.” – Park Hee-bong\n\nThe colour yellow could be seen as a motif in the film. Bong Joon-ho’s film was indeed vibrant in the beginning, with clear skies and a wide array of colours in the beginning but slowly progressed to one that was dark and grey with a slight tint of blue and the prevailing splash of yellow every now and then. Bong Joon-ho’s interpretation of the colour yellow could be deduced to be deceitful and hazardous situations in the film. It was so subtle, that one might have mistaken it for an unintentional coincidence but perhaps, not.\n\nFrom the moment the first disinfecting crew member appeared in his canary yellow biohazard suit, yellowcould be seen when Nam-il retrieves the post-it note for the password before his friend betrays him and tries to capture him with a mob in attempt to earn the bounty on his head. A yellow spider appears on Hyun-seo’s sleeve before she attempts to ascend the rope from the monster’s lair by using his back as a ramp. Even the gas to be released near the Han River to stun the monster was named Agent Yellow– a possible lament at the the way the South Korean government has been handling its political affairs during that time.\n\n“The right of the hungry”, also known as Seo-ri in Hangul, was mentioned by Se-jin to Se-joo whilst they were gathering food from the uninhibited Park snack-bar – shedding light as to why the monster was hunting humans after its emergence from the Han River. The appeal of a tastier meal as compared to what was offered in the Han River, was definitely a more nutritious offering…\n\nThe film’s denouement could be seen as one of being at ease with oneself. The Park snack-bar is still located by the Han River, but it was now winter, and Gang-du now lives with Se-joo. Wooden photo frames of Hyun-seo and the family bounty are hung up on the walls of the snack-bar and Gang-du also spots a neater haircut. The events of the film have shaped Gang-du and given him a chance to start afresh with Se-joo and he was able to make peace with the events that have happened.\n\nOn the hold, The Host has made for a beautifully tragic film of a family’s journey to save their beloved daughter/niece/granddaughter from the monstrous abomination of the Han River. Bong Joon-ho has not only been able to appeal to fans of monster films, but also families – who would be able to bond with one another when they watch it, perhaps at a gathering or two."
