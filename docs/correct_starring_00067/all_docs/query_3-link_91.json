        "text": "Deepika Padukone made a grand Bollywood debut opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Farah Khanâs 2007 blockbuster Om Shanti Om. While speaking to Komal Nahta, Farah recalled the process of getting Deepika on board for her second film as a director and why her voice was dubbed.\n\nShe reveled, âI had seen her in a Fanta ad and I thought then that this girl is going to be a heroine. I wanted someone who could look like that era’s Hema Malini. I found that quality in her.â\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe filmmaker added, âHer diction was bad but when she did songs, her face would light up. She was very expressive with songs.â Due to the challenges with Deepika Padukone’s voice, another artist dubbed for her character in the film ‘Om Shanti Om,’ while the rest of the movie used sync sound.\n\nShe said, “Everything else was sync sound but her voice was dubbed. She was doing diction classes, not very seriously. But she was doing dance class, diction class, Anupam Kher’s acting school. I enrolled her in everything,”\n\nShe added, “We were properly training her.”\n\nShah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone have done films like Om Shanti Om, Happy New Year, Chennai Express, Pathaan, and now Jawan. The actress was seen in a small but critical role in SRKâs film and the duo has had 100% success record at the box-office so far.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBond withÂ Shah Rukh Khan\n\nWe are each otherâs lucky charm. But honestly, we are beyond luck. We have a sense of ownership over each other."
