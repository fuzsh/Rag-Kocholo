He won four awards for Lage Raho Munnabhai- the Filmfare Best Comedian Award, the IIFA Award for Best Supporting Actor, the Zee Cine Award for Best Actor in Comic Role and the Star Screen Award for Best Supporting Actor. He was also the winner of the Star Screen Award for Best Supporting Actor for the film Ishqiya.\n\nTrivia: Not all people know that the actor with a brilliant comic timing is a superb choreographer as well. Before stepping into the world of dance and acting, he did odd jobs. He has been the winner of major dance competitions in 1991 and 1992. Besides having acted in 40-odd films, he has also been a television presenter and the producer of two films.\n\nBiography: The versatile actor was born in Mumbai and studied at a boarding school in Nashik.

He assisted filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt in two of his films- Thikana and Kaash.

The film’s positive response helped Arshad Warsi gain some recognition. This was followed by a number of films in the subsequent years, all of which failed to make an impact at the box office. And then came Munnabhai M.B.B.S. in 2003, and changed things for the better! The Rajkumar Hirani film has Arshad playing the supporting role named Circuit, which went on to become of the most historical characters in the history of Indian cinema.\n\nThereafter, he appeared many successful films like Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya, Salaam Namaste, Golmaal and Kabul Express, mainly doing supporting yet noticeable roles. In 2006, he starred in Lage Raho Munnabhai, the sequel to Munnabhai M.B.B.S., for which he won four prestigious awards, including his first Filmfare Award. He then acted in films like Dhamaal, Dhan Dhana Dhan Goal, Golmaal Returns, Ishqiya and Golmaal 3. His performance in Ishqiya was hugely appreciated and he was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nArshad Warsi produced a film named Hum Tum Aur Ghost in 2010. He has lent his voice for two songs- one each in Munnabhai M.B.B.S. and Lage Raho Munnabhai.
