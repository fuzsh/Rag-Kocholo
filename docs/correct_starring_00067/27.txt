ARJUN RAMPAL FOUND SRK'S CHARACTER IN OM SHANTI OM IRRITATING

In Om Shanti Om, we see Shah Rukh Khan playing the role of a junior artist in the film industry. He falls madly in love with a top actress named Shanti Priya, played by Deepika Padukone. Shanti is secretly married to Arjun Rampal's character, a huge producer. Later, he kills both Shanti and Om. In the second part of the film, SRK is reborn in a rich home and goes on to become superstar Om Kapoor.

When Arjun Kapoor was asked about the relationship between SRK’s character and nepotism, the actor said that the character’s rebirth as a “nepo" was bothersome. “When he (Shah Rukh Khan’s character) is born the second time, he comes a nepo. It was an irritating character.”

Arjun Rampal also spoke about how star kids get more chances in the industry. He said that there is a huge advantage a person has if they have a family member in a profession and they want to get in the same profession. “That’s the destiny of that personâæ you don’t choose your family you are born into.”
