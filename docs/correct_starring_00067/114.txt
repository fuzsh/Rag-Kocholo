Synopsis

Set in the 1970's, Om Prakash Makhija ( Shah Rukh Khan) is a junior artist in the film industry. He and his friend Pappu ( Shreyas Talpade) are trying to become big heroes in the film industry. Omâs mother, Bela Makhija ( Kirron Kher), inspires and encourages her son to become a hero. Omâs love interest is the country's heart throb and the star of the film, Dream Girl, Shantipriya ( Deepika Padukone).

Om gets to meet Shanti on several occasions: first at the premiere of Dream Girl where he sneaks in after claiming he is the actor Manoj Kumar. Finally at a film set, in which he saves her life after the set catches fire. From then on, Om and Shanti become good friends. Om sees Shanti again only this time he overhears her arguing with top producer Mukesh Mehra ( Arjun Rampal). To Om's shock, Shanti is revealed to be married to Mukesh and is also pregnant. Mukesh is adamant that their relationship is kept a secret. Mukesh also tells Shanti that he cannot officially accept this because a rich businessman is financing his upcoming film Om Shanti Om for which he requires 40 lakhs rupees. The truth is he is getting married to the daughter of the businessman. Angry and hurt, Shanti demands justice and more importantly love from Mukesh. Om heartbroken begins to avoid Shanti.

One night, Om sees Shanti being escorted to the set of Om Shanti Om by Mukesh. Much to Shanti's pleasure, Mukesh reveals he is going to cancel the film and he is going to reveal his marriage with her to the public. He also tells Shanti that he will destroy the set after they have the marriage ceremony in it. However Mukesh angered by Shanti's demands holds her responsible for his financial loss and sets fire to the set of the film with Shanti trapped inside. Om sees Mukesh drive away without Shanti and to his horror sees Shanti trapped inside screaming for help. He tries to reach her but Mukesh's guards beat him and stop him from getting to her. Soon after the set explodes killing Shanti. Om who runs for help is hit by a car owned by Rajesh Kapoor ( Javed Sheikh), a well known actor who is rushing his pregnant wife (Asawari Joshi) to a hospital. Rakesh takes him to the hospital, but Om dies on the operating table.

30 years after the incident, Om is reincarnated as Om Kapoor, son of Rajesh Kapoor, who was born right after Om Makhija died. After Om signs his next film they go on a location hunt. They choose the burnt studio and set of the film Om Shanti Om as their present shooting location. As soon as he sees the set, Om begins to remember bits of his past life. Soon after at a party he meets Mukesh Mehra, who has been a popular Hollywood producer for the past 25 years. His past life comes rushing back to him and he has a tearful reunion with Bela and Pappu.

To avenge Shanti's death, Om decides to remake the film Om Shanti Om with Mukesh who, after some convincing, agrees to be the producer of the film. During the audition for the role of Shanti, the crew meets Sandy or Sandhya, a look-a-like of Shantipriya. Om begins to play with Mukesh's head by firstly taking him to the restored set of Om Shanti Om and then making him believe that Shanti is a ghost. However during the mind games many occurrences take place which were not planned by Om's team. Mukesh eventually comes to know about Sandy and Om's plan. He confronts Om and they begin to fight. Sandy (as the audience are led to believe) appears and talks to Mukesh about that night he killed her. She reveals details about Shantipriya's death that even Om did not know. She reveals that Mukesh returned that night to take care of Shantipriya's body, who was still alive. Mukesh buried her alive underneath the floor of the set. Om realizes that she is actually Shanti's ghost after the real Sandy enters from the front door. The ghost Shanti kills Mukesh by making a chandelier fall on him. At the end, Om sees the ghost of Shanti tearfully bid him good-bye. She runs up the stairs and disappears. It is implied that Om and Sandy (who is not the reincarnation of Shantipriya) get together in the end.

Reviews

Tajpal Rathore of BBC gave four out of five stars and stated, "Both a homage to and parody of Bollywood, this cinematic feast delivered straight from the heart of the film industry will have you glued to your seats till the end." [21] Mark Medley of National Post gave 3 stars and stated, "The film is a mess for all the right reasons; elements of comedy, drama, romance, action and the supernatural are packed in. But really, the plot is just a vehicle to get from one song-and-dance number to the next." [22] Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave 3 and half stars and stated, "Om Shanti Om is an exultant, heady, joyous film reveling in Bollywood, and as at most parties where the bubbly flows free, there is much silly giggling and tremendous immaturity. You'd do well do breathe in the filmi fumes, lift your own collar-tips upwards, and leave sense out of the equation. More cameos are written in than dialogues, so sit back and play spot-the-celeb. Or watch the Khan have a blast on screen." [23] Indiafm's Taran Adarsh gave movie awesome 4 out 5 star rating stating the follows " At the box-office, the film will set new records in days to come and has the power to emerge one of the biggest hits of SRK's career." [24] SearchIndia.com gave the movie the thumbs-down stating that "A dispiritingly commonplace theme of reincarnation packaged in a disjointed, tracing-paper-thin plot with ho-hum performances by the lead actors renders a mediocre movie that only addled fans of Bollywood superstar Shahrukh Khan would love" [25] Rajeev Mansad of CNN-IBN gives Om Shanti Om 3 out of 5, stated "...A special mention must be made for the filmâs excellent dialogue which so cleverly incorporates Bollywoodâs oldest clichÃ©s into these charactersâ everyday parlance..." [26]. Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave 3.5 of 5 stars stating the film is a total paisa vasool and a true tribute to Karz. [27] Hindustan Times's Khalid Mehmood gave the film 4/5 saying that Om Shanti Om is total brainless mazaa. [28] Sudish Kamnath of The Hindu stated, "Om Shanti Om' is a light-hearted tribute to Hindi cinema the way we know it and love it, in spite of its flaws, improvisation and implausibility. [...]That apart, the movie is a hell of a party, a bits-and-pieces blockbuster strung together with a series of laughs, songs and dances. SRK shows us why he's the rock star of our times. " [29]

Controversy

Om Shanti Om landed into a controversy with veteran actor Manoj Kumar, for showing him (actually his body double) in a bad taste.

In the movie, Shreyas Talpade's character (Pappu) sneaks Manoj Kumar's movie passes to enter a movie premier. When the real Manoj Kumar (film double) shows up for the premiere, the security guards ask him for identification, for which he produces his driving license with a photograph of him covering his face (a parody to his classic style of acting). Since the Security guards do not recognize him they declare him a fraud and chase him out of the premises with their sticks. [30] And then in a different scene Shah Rukh (Om Prakash Makhija) is shown giving a mock thank-you speech in a drunken state and later saying that he's Manoj Kumar. [30] Offended by the sequence, Manoj Kumar contrived to sue the makers of 'Om Shanti Om'. In response he told, "Indian audiences had made Manoj Kumar into an icon ... That icon has been wounded, made fun of..... A moral action is more important than a legal action." He also said, "People who make such movies do not know the meaning of respect and decency. They are criminals." [30] Manoj Kumar also added, "Are the Mumbai police so stupid that they can't recognise Manoj Kumar and lathicharge him in the '70s when he was a star?â [31]. Manoj Kumar also alleged that Shahrukh Khan is communal [32]

Later, in a press conference Shah Rukh Khan and director Farah Khan apologised for the matter. Shah Rukh accepted his mistake and apoligised saying, "It was a mistake to overlook the fact that it might hurt anyone. I truly apologise to everyone who think I have made fun of him. Honestly speaking, I didn't mean to show anyone in a negative manner or run down anyone." [33] Farah Khan even offered to cut the scene where Manoj Kumar feel that he has been hurt. "But he said not to do it or even apologise as I was like his daughter. He said, âDaughters maafi nahi maangti ' (Daughters don't ask for forgiveness). I told him that he could've called me and scolded me." [33]

Later, Manoj Kumar said that though this incident has hurt him but wants to forgive, ignore and move on saying that he prefers to âsee Ram in everyone and ignore the Ravana.â [34]
