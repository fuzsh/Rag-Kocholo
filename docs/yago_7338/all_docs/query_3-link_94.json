The title of Counts of Byzantine Empire to all descendants Has been restricted to children of Conte Mario Vassallo Paleologo And their male heirs, so in this case, the Inguanez and Pace families. Sections of Nobility creations are numbered and highlighted.\n\nTraditional history claims that by the end of the eighteenth century, the Order of the Hospital had reached the end of a long-drawn-out process of secularization and decline. It also asserts that in 1798 the Hospitallers surrendered Malta as a direct result of this debilitating process. The paper argues against both misconceptions. First, at no stage in the eighteenth century, or indeed earlier, may the Order be said to have experienced decline. Secondly, within the current state of Hospitaller scholarship, its surrender of Malta may only be attributed to the devitalizing and crippling influence the French Revolution had on the institution.\n\nIf you have any questions, corrections, updates, please do go to the website and send an email.
