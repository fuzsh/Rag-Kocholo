What Poles?\n\nThe action of an 1896 play, Ubu Roi, reportedly took place “Nowhere, that is, Poland.” Readers of this book will find out that “nowhere” could indeed be Poland’s location. But not only—and far from only. The thousand-plusyear-old country we call Poland has been a moving target, geographically as well as demographically. Not only—amazingly—is there no single piece of territory that has been part of a Polish state throughout the country’s entire history. The very definition of who is a Pole has not been constant either. Thus, Polish history is not your “average” national history. Poland has had more than its share of highs and lows. In the late medieval and early modern periods, it grew to be the largest country in continental Europe. Then it was wiped off the map for over a century. The phoenix that was Poland rose out of the ashes of World War I, only to be obliterated by the joint Nazi-Soviet occupation that began World War II. The postwar entity known as Poland was both shaped and controlled by the country’s Big Brother, the Soviet Union. Yet even under those constraints, Poles proved persistent in their desire to wrest from the communists a modicum of national dignity, and they ultimately achieved much more than that. This is in part because Poles have long marched to their own drummer. They have straddled East and West, not always comfortably but often creatively. At various times, political or cultural considerations have inclined them and their polity to focus attention on various specific directions of the compass. This is seen in the opening chapters of the book, where Poles are considered “connecting with the West,” or “embracing the East,” with their influence “spreading southward.” Nonetheless, it would be impossible to relegate Poles to any one particular direction—despite the insistence of most contemporary Poles on being fully “Western” and having their country referred to as part of “Central Europe.” And Poles have often been caught in the middle. Poland’s central location, which one historian termed the “heart of Europe,” has been both a blessing and a curse. Indeed, Poles have often been victims of their own unenviable geography (see chapters 5–7), which placed them in between rising states to the east (Muscovy/Russia/Soviet Union) and west (Prussia/Germany). They\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\nand their state also perched, at times precariously, along a religious fault line dividing western and eastern Christianity. Yet being in the middle meant that the country has had more opportunity than most to profit from exposure to ideas emanating from many directions. This made Poland perhaps less the heart of Europe than its crossroads. Poles took inspiration from this wealth of interactions emanating from all directions. At one point in the late medieval/early modern period (see chapter 4), they even created their own sui generis state (the Commonwealth of Both Nations, Polish and Lithuanian) and nation (noble, or Sarmatian). At that time, the people we call Poles were trailblazers of tolerance and defenders of diversity. But who were these people, and what made them Poles? This question is hardly moot. Who was considered a Pole varied over the course of Polish history. Given the multiethnic and multidenominational composition of Poland’s most creative, early modern incarnation as a state, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, readers would be wrong to assume that the “Poles” under consideration were always ethnic Poles, Roman Catholics, or native speakers of Polish (the way we tend to define the nation in modern times). The “noble (Sarmatian) nation” of the early modern period extended the full rights of citizenship to nobles across the breadth and length of this state and of different ethnic backgrounds. The country’s inhabitants included people whom today we would call Lithuanians, Belarusians, Ukrainians, Germans, Jews, Armenians, Tatars, among others. The legacy of this broader, more inclusive conception of Polishness would continue to color the evolution of Polish national thought, sometimes even inclining the nation to fight “for our freedom and for yours,” despite the fact that, ultimately, the nation would come to be defined in modern ethnic terms.\n\nThe Paradoxical Persistence of Poland\n\nIn most tellings of European history, one is lucky to hear Poland mentioned at all. It figures only sporadically, coming in and out of the picture (seemingly more out than in), and quite often history textbooks get the facts wrong. The picture of Poland has often been unflattering. The country has been mentioned in conjunction with the late eighteenth century “partitions of Poland,” that is, precisely at the moment when it disappeared from the map of Europe for over a century. This disappearance was generally presented as something almost inevitable—certainly natural. There were good reasons, so the argument goes, for the Poles to be denied independent state-\n\nPreface\n\nxiii\n\nhood. But the reasons for partitioning a large and long-established state, which is what Poland was at the time, were questionable. In accounts of twentieth-century history, Poland’s trajectory has long been seen as depressing. The country generally is mentioned as one of the new states created after World War I. It disappears from the map again during World War II. After that painful caesura, it becomes subsumed within an area called variously “Eastern Europe” or the East or Soviet Bloc—suggesting (correctly) that many general works of history assumed that any references to the Soviet Union (which did become an obsession during the Cold War) would by extension apply to the countries of Eastern Europe. Indeed, one history textbook saw fit to write in its index, “See Soviet Union,” under the entry for “Eastern Europe.”\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nPolish Pertinence and Impertinence\n\nThus, the picture of Poland (insofar as the country has been depicted at all) has tended to be depressing. The only hope during periods of oppression lay in something called “The Polish Question.” This phenomenon referred to the Poles’ seemingly impertinent or even provocative demand for independent statehood—something they considered their right. The question was a feature of what is often called the “long nineteenth century,” a period when there was no Polish state, and no truly independent Polish state (see chapters 8–10). This period established the idea of “Poland,” featured in courses on or readings in European or world history. It was a paradoxical, even problematic, country that, according to some interpretations, “did not deserve” to exist, as during World War II (see chapter 12), or else was fated by its unfavorable geopolitical position to exist only as part of the Soviet bloc (see chapter 13). History tends to be written by the victors. Given that the modern history profession dates from a period when there was no Polish state, we should not be surprised that Poland has so often been presented in such a sporadic, unflattering, even disheartening way. It has often been in the interest of the victors to underestimate, downplay, or even obscure the history of the “losers.” But times have changed. Polish history is no longer a totally depressing story. Some still seem to tell it that way and to emphasize periods of trials and tribulations, the nation’s faults and weaknesses. And there is a tendency to which many Poles subscribe to treat Poles as a long-suffering people, as a nation of victims. But it would be wrong to read Polish history as a tale of\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nxiv\n\nPreface\n\nhelpless Polish victims incapable of doing anything to help themselves. Poles were not powerless pawns in big-power politics. Indeed, readers will see that they were in fact able to influence outcomes—even some outcomes that affected not only the history of their own nation but that of their neighbors as well. More than that: some outcomes involving Polish actors were of worldhistorical significance. The Poles have as interesting a historical profile as any of the peoples of this part of the world—arguably, the most interesting. Among other things, they have boldly forged their own unique type of government and embraced diversity within their state borders. Poles have also been the quintessential “freedom fighters”—fighters for the freedom of other nations as well as for their own. Poland’s pertinence to European and world history, thus, is varied. With the country’s accession to the European Union in 2004, its history has become an integral part of European history. It is seen, for better or worse, as part of the “New Europe.” Yet such an approach suggests that Poland, despite its being the largest country of this new cohort, is but an appendage, a country on the outskirts of Europe, rather than a major player in its own right. Such an interpretation does not do justice to the roles played by the country and its people. If one reads history backward, one should not underestimate the role the Poles have played in bringing down the prevalent European or world systems. In the most recent past, Poles contributed to the collapse of communism in the East. Even prior to that, Poles and their desire for independent statehood likewise helped to undermine the great Central and East European empires of the long nineteenth century. These accomplishments stemmed—again, taking a step backward— from the unique experience of Poles in the early modern period. Poland was long a big player in Central and Eastern Europe. While Poland was not itself an empire, in a certain incarnation it was the largest political entity in this part of Europe, one that had a multiethnic population. Think of it as Europe writ small. This premodern Polish permutation represented the pinnacle of Polish creativity, a road not taken by other countries within Europe during that period. Its citizens valued democratic, consensual, constitutional approaches long before such ideas were embraced by the rest of Europe. The country also was strong enough to become a federative state, allowing a patchwork of peoples and territories to join of their own accord in the Polish experiment. Some might consider this particular Polish permutation a precursor of sorts to the European Union. That Poland has recently concluded its successful turn at the helm of the council of the European Union while also weathering the global economic crisis signifi-\n\nPreface\n\nxv\n\nCopyright © 2014.

The writers of big books incur big debts. I would like to thank the Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage as well as Professor Jacek Purchla, director of the International Cultural Centre in Kraków, Poland, for the opportunity to spend the fall of 2011 in Kraków with a very generous Thesaurus Poloniae Fellowship. My lectures there and elsewhere in Poland convinced me of the need for this kind of popular history of the country. All the same, this book would never have been written without the repeated urging of J. Alex Schwartz, former director of Northern Illinois University Press. I am indebted to him for pushing me in this direction, and to my editor Amy Farranto and the team at NIUP for their very professional assistance. The maps are the work of cartographer Daniel Huffman. They are based on maps in a Polish historical atlas given to me by Professor Krzysztof Zamorski of the Jagiellonian University. Both men deserve my utmost gratitude, as do the anonymous readers of the manuscript. I also had the privilege of taking part in the conference “Recovering Forgotten History: The Image of East-Central Europe in English-Language Textbooks,” in the course of which a number of distinguished scholars, mostly Polish, generously reviewed my manuscript. I am extremely grateful to Professors Dobrochna Kałwa, Igor Kąkolewski, Robert Kostro, Adam Kożuchowski, John Merriman, Andrzej Nowak, Endre Sashalmi, and Marek Wierzbicki for their invaluable comments and suggestions. Of course, all errors of interpretation are mine alone. If the text of the book is any good, it is thanks not only to these reviewers and the stellar examples of historians who have served me as mentors over the years. It is also due in no small part to the students who took my classes at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where I have happily taught under the aegis of the Amesbury Professorship of Polish Language, Literature, and Culture, in the person of Professor Robert A. Rothstein. In teaching them, I learned more than they could ever guess. While I have my husband, Janusz, to thank for his endless support and love, which can never be repaid, this book is dedicated to my daughter, Natalie. While she is not a historian, her connection to Poland is deeper than mine (in that it dates from birth). While I hope this book might be read by history buffs in the United States, Poland, and beyond, during the process of conceptualizing and writing I have had in mind Natalie and all our relatives around the globe who might wish to learn more about their Polish heritage.\n\nCopyright © 2014.

An attempt has been made for many Christian names and surnames from a number of languages—these include Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Belarusian, Czech, Hungarian, and German—to retain their native flavor (for example, the Polish Bolesław instead of the Latinized Boleslaus, or the German Friedrich instead of English Frederick or Polish Fryderyk). The only cases where this approach has not been followed concern the Russian, Hungarian, or Austrian royalty or the occasional world-renowned individual—for example, we have Catherine the Great, not Ekaterina the Great, and Genghis Khan, not the less familiar Chinghis Khan. A Polish pronunciation guide follows for those who wish to decipher the original Polish names or the occasional word. The names of countries and many major cities have been left in their Anglicized form—therefore, Poland, not Polska. With several exceptions, the less familiar place names used are the current ones, with an alternate form given in parentheses at first mention: for example, Gdańsk (German: Danzig). Current toponyms are also found on the book’s maps. While this modern usage may at times ring false to the historian, it enables the general reader to locate the places on a general map of the world, while it is also suggestive of the reach of the Poles and of Polish history.\n\nCopyright © 2014.

In Polish, every letter is pronounced distinctly. Consonants are crisp and vowels are full. There are very few exceptions to the rules of pronunciation presented below.

(In this, Poles are no different from the peoples of other nations who as a rule tend to seek an ancient lineage for themselves.) Using the available archaeological and linguistic sources, among others, some scholars have pieced together a neat trajectory—from the prehistoric cave dwellers in the limestone caves of Ojców, through the wooden settlement of Biskupin, existing from circa 750 BC to 550 AD, and in the process moving from hypothetical Proto-Indo-European beginnings to the emergence of Slavic languages and distinct Slavic peoples. They claim that this represents the rise of Poland. For the historian, however, such an approach raises more questions than it answers, especially as quite a parade of peoples had crisscrossed this part of Europe by the end of the first millennium, including Scythians, Celts, Germanic tribes, not to mention Goths, Huns, and Avars. The evidence of life in such ancient times cannot, thus, convincingly be put into “national” boxes. Not that making sense of traditional historical sources is easy. The historian interested in early medieval Poland must make do with a sparse and fragmented historical record. That Romans never conquered these lands (a good thing) meant that there was no early record of them (a bad thing). Commercial links of some kind clearly connected this part of Central and Eastern Europe with the Roman world—with Roman coins exchanged, perhaps, for precious Baltic amber. Legible signs of the beginnings of what can be called “Poland” are available to us only in tantalizing snippets, however.\n\n6\n\nPoland\n\nWhile the occasional source makes reference to tribes, settlements, or leaders in this part of the world, even these are frustratingly hard to locate on the map in any precise way. So, how are we to deal with the origins of the Poles, and the origin of Poland?\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nThree Foundational Legends\n\nA different window onto the past is provided by legends. While some may disdain such tales as ahistorical and thus not worthy of our attention, there is much to be learned from these primitive yet enduring attempts to explain the world of the past. As received wisdom, legends also shape the views of new generations. Some of the more interesting legends tell us something about perceptions of relations between peoples—here, between the Poles and their neighbors. The following selection of three foundational legends will provide a working framework for an understanding of Polish history and Polish perceptions. Consider the legend of three brothers: Lech, Czech, and Rus. Lech was the forerunner of the Poles; Czech, of course, the forerunner of the Czechs; and Rus of the broader Slavic family further east, today’s Belarusians, Ukrainians, and Russians. Each brother decided to set off in a different direction in search of a place to call home. Whereas Czech headed south and Rus traveled east, Lech was led north by a white eagle until he arrived at a tree. From its top branches, Lech took in the view. To the north he spied a mighty ocean, to the east he could see vast fertile plains. Mountains dominated the southern horizon, and dense forests spread out to the west. Was this land not ideal? Enthralled with what he saw, Lech decided to settle right there— indeed, to build a nest of his own. In thanks, he made his emblem the white eagle with outstretched wings. This legend addresses the larger Slavic family of Central and Eastern Europe and explains how various peoples ended up in their present location. Slavic tribes came to populate much of Central and Eastern Europe around the fifth century. Over time, they became more differentiated, eventually giving rise to more recognizable national groups. The Polish legend speaks of only three brothers, clearly reflecting the local Polish neighborhood. The Poles and Czechs were both members of the western branch of the Slav family, while Rus represented the entirety of the eastern Slav family. Given Lech’s particular location, the southern Slavs (the peoples we associate with the former Yugoslavia) were out of view; they were located to the south of the Czech homeland. The legend likewise hints that the descendants of Czech\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press.

The legend also provides some geographical cues regarding Lech’s territory, which was depicted in glowing terms. As we will see, the Polish “nest” founded by Lech was a place called Gniezno, a toponym related to the modern Polish for “nest” (gniazdo). Gniezno, incidentally, is located in the heart of modern Poland. The lands of the Poles are in part described by natural boundaries: the Baltic Sea in the north and the Carpathian Mountains in the south. The western and eastern borders of Lech’s land—those forests and plains—are not as easily delineated, suggesting that such determinations may be more open to adjustment. (It is worth noting that the other Slavic peoples who figured in the legend, the descendants of Czech and Rus, lay to the southwest and east, respectively.) In a nice touch, the legend also provides an ancient justification for a historical detail: the white eagle remains Poland’s emblem to this day. Another legend tells us about the founder of the city of Kraków, a man called Krak. He was a wise villager who, through a clever ruse, managed to kill the dragon that terrorized his people. Krak smeared a sheep with sulfur and cast it into the dragon’s cave; after ingesting this free but unusually spicy meal, the dragon drank from the Vistula (Polish: Wisła) River until he burst. The dragon had lived in the cave beneath Wawel Hill, the future site of the city that long would be Poland’s capital. The legend thus explains both the city’s subsequent rise in importance and the existence of the so-called Krak Mound, a hill on the outskirts of Kraków that was erected in honor of Krak by his thankful subjects. Such mounds, incidentally, were an ancient Slavic way of honoring the dead. And who can deny the grain of truth in the legend of Wanda, Krak’s daughter, who drowned herself in the Vistula River rather than marry a German who threatened to invade the country if she refused him. Does her tale not suggest the fact, borne out by subsequent history, of a certain longstanding tension in the interactions between Poles and Germans? (For lovers of music, Dvořák’s 1875 opera Vanda is based on this tale, reflecting the Czechs’ own sometimes rocky relations with their German neighbors.) The persistence of the legend of Wanda suggests that Slavic peoples such as Poles and Czechs felt their German neighbor to be a distinct “Other.” Corroboration can be found in the name given by such Slavs to the Germans. The latter were from early days referred to as Niemcy—the mute ones. These Germans were probably not tongue-tied but, rather, spoke an unintelligible (Germanic) language, whereas the Slavic languages were more or less mutually intelligible. Could this be enough reason for a pagan princess to have preferred\n\n8\n\nPoland\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press.

Some versions of the legend interestingly depict the Germans as rather uncouth—let us say barbaric—warriors, in contrast to the more cultured Cracovians. Regardless of the reason for her embracing a watery death, Wanda, like her father Krak, was honored with a mound. These three legends set the stage for our foray into Polish history. Coming to us out of the mists of time, they hint at the deep prehistoric and pagan beginnings, including the emergence of distinct peoples within the larger Central and East European space. They also provide clues to certain central places and prominent features of the country we will call Poland, as well as evidence that from the very outset Poles have functioned within a world peopled by “brothers” (Slavs) and “others” (Germanic peoples).\n\nFrom Legends to History\n\nPolish history, as opposed to prehistory, dates only from the late tenth century. Prior to this period, various tribes in this general vicinity of Central\n\nConnecting with the West\n\n9\n\nand Eastern Europe get only the briefest of mention in written sources. A Bavarian geographer in the mid-ninth century enumerated a series of tribes, which appear to have lived in the region. These included the VuislaneWiślanie (people of the Vistula River region) and Lendizi-Lędzianie (also in Małopolska, or Lesser Poland, somewhat further to the east); the GlopeaniGoplanie (near Lake Gopło, fed by the Noteć River); the Sleenzane-Ślężanie, Dadosesani-Dziadoszanie, Opolini-Opolanie, and Golensizi-Golęszycy, all in the area of present-day Silesia; and the Prissani-Pyrzyczanie and Velunzani-Wolinianie in the region of Pomerania, on the coast of the Baltic Sea. An early mention of an emerging threat in the region came from one of the first Slavic states, Greater Moravia, which formed in the vicinity of today’s Czech Republic and Slovakia. Baptized by the missionaries Cyril and Methodius circa 863 AD, Moravians noted the presence of a powerful pagan prince in the region of the Vistula. The reference was likely to a tribe in the region of Kraków, the site not only of the historic mounds already mentioned but also of an enormous cache of ancient metal blades, which suggests that it was a seat of some power, even in this early period. The Vuislane tribe at some point probably came under Czech rule or influence before becoming part of a dynamic state emerging to the north.\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nPolish Beginnings: The Gniezno “Nest”\n\nThe beginnings of Polish statehood emanated from the region of today’s city of Gniezno, part of the region later termed Greater Poland (Wielkopolska). As mentioned earlier, the name “Gniezno” is related to the present-day Polish word for “nest” (gniazdo). The avian metaphor suggests there might be some truth in the legend of Lech. The archaeological record also allows us to see the region’s rise. Given that Lake Gopło is not far from Gniezno, there may well be a relation between the Glopeani mentioned by the Bavarian geographer and the tribe that started a rapid ascendance in the region. Gniezno had become a stronghold of note, a town where craftsmen settled and trading took place. This nameless people settled along the surrounding rivers and lakes, where they constructed settlements. Around the year 920 AD, the apparent military expansion and buildup of fortified settlements near Gniezno (including Poznań) speak of a significant and speedy expansion; the next half-century would witness further expansion and consolidation in the region as well as beyond. The Gniezno state expanded its influence northward to the seacoast region of Pomerania, although the link was likely loose, and perhaps based on paying tribute. It incorporated territories\n\n10\n\nPoland\n\nin the east (Mazovia and Sandomierz) and made inroads into the southeast circa 970; the Lendizi of that last region, however, soon fell under the control of the Rus’ princes to the east. The dynamic tribe with its seat in Gniezno was only later (around the year 1000) labeled the Polanie—Poles. Etymologically, these are the people of the fields or plains (pole). The sixteenth-century Polish historian Marcin Kromer provided two more hypotheses as to the origins of the name. It could be a contraction of “po Lech” (after Lech), the reference being to the legendary first Pole, or the term could be related to the Poles’ love of hunting (polowanie). Given that Lech’s legendary territory also was rich in forests (and thus probably also in game), any of these explanations could have merit. The earlier, still prehistorical, period is associated with figures such as the famous Popiel (an evil ruler who, according to legend, was devoured by rats and the ancestors, whether apparent or legendary, of the first Polish ruler of whose name and historical existence we can truly be certain, Mieszko (?–992). Before we turn to him, however, we must decipher the chapter title’s reference to the Piasts. Who were the Piasts, and why were they important?\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nThe Piasts\n\nThe first written account of their origins was penned in the early twelfth century by an anonymous monk. He is traditionally called the Anonymous Gaul, as the assumption is that he hailed from France. Scholars more recently have surmised that he spent time at the monastery of Saint-Gilles and was educated somewhere in France or Flanders. The peripatetic monk may also have come to Poland via Hungary, perhaps with a stay in the monastery in Somogyvár, and perhaps expressly to write about the Polish lands. The Anonymous—a sojourner in Poland—was the first to write of “the deeds of the princes of the Poles.” This was the title of his work, in Latin, Gesta principum Polonorum. Indebted to his hosts, the Anonymous wrote so as “not to eat Poland’s bread in vain.” He began, as did so many authors of his time, by praising the land to which he had come: Although this land is thickly forested, yet it has ample resources of gold and silver, bread and meat, fish and honey; but in one respect it is especially to be preferred to all others, for in spite of being surrounded by all the many aforementioned peoples, Christian and pagan alike, and frequently attacked by all and sundry, it has never been completely subjugated by anyone. A land where the\n\nConnecting with the West\n\n11\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nair is healthy, the fields fertile, the woods full of honey, the water abounding in fish, the warriors warlike, the peasants hardworking, the horses hardy, the oxen strong at plowing, the cows give abundant milk and the sheep abundant wool.*\n\nIn a way, it seems to reflect the legend of Lech, who saw similar goodness in the land, while amplifying something that doubtless would cheer every Polish heart: that the land had never been subjugated by foreigners, despite their many attempts. To be sure, prior to its swift rise and expansion, the Gniezno state had been shielded on all sides from direct interference on the part of the growing powers in Central and Eastern Europe. A series of small Slavic tribes to the west, inhabiting the region between the Oder and Elbe Rivers, kept the Germans at bay; the Vuislane of what would be called Lesser Poland to the south themselves dealt with the neighboring Czechs; and the Lendizi tribe served as a buffer between the nascent Polish state and the Ruthenes to the east. The Anonymous related the tale of an ancient ritual, that of cutting the hair of young boys once they reached a certain age, as a sign of their maturity, and bestowing a new name on them. According to legend, on a certain day, the son of Duke Popiel and the son of a poor plowman Piast were both undergoing this ceremonial cutting. Two mysterious strangers came upon the ducal ceremony but were chased away. Setting out once again, the two mysterious strangers came upon the plowman Piast, who received them hospitably. Although he had only one barrel of homebrewed ale and a piglet to celebrate his son, he treated the strangers to them. What happened next was a miracle: the barrel amazingly replenished itself, so that all those present could drink their fill—while the cups ran dry at the ducal feast. Furthermore, there was so much leftover pork that ten buckets (cebri in Polish, added the Anonymous) full of leftovers were collected. On the advice of the guests, Piast extended his hospitality to Duke Popiel, who was amazed at the sight. The guests cut the boy’s hair and bestowed upon him the name Siemowit—which meant “welcome here.” Siemowit ultimately succeeded Popiel, who later would meet an ignominious fate, being beset by a horde of rats. According to the Anonymous’s chronology, Mieszko figured as the greatgrandson of Siemowit and, thus, the great-great-grandson of the hospitable Piast. Regardless of his prehistoric lineage either real or legendary, it is Mieszko who brings us into the historical era as the first historically verifiable, authentic Polish ruler. All that is known of Siemowit and the next two generations of Piasts—Leszek and Siemomysł—comes from this twelfth-century * Gesta principum Polonorum: The Deeds of the Princes of the Poles, trans. and annotation, Paul W. Knoll and Frank Schaer (Budapest: Central European University Press, 2003), 15.\n\n12\n\nPoland\n\naccount. In other words, the Anonymous’s tale is of the origins of a dynasty: the first dynasty to rule over the nascent Polish state, the Piasts. The anonymous French monk had a tale to relate about Mieszko. The future Polish ruler reportedly was born blind, but in his seventh year, at a feast given by his father Siemomysł, he gained his sight. How to explain this? The wise folk of that period reportedly explained that Mieszko had been blind, as Poland had been, until this time; only in the future would Poland “be illuminated by Mieszko and exalted over all the neighboring nations.”* In this way, they presaged what Mieszko would be most known for. Not only was he the first ruler of Poland to make the historical record, but he would bring enlightenment of a certain sort to the Poles—something that would forever change their outlook on the world.\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nMedieval Poland: Becoming Part of the Christian World\n\nMieszko seems to have led the Polanie as of about the year 960. The reason we know of him and his state is that, like the Moravians to the south, the Germans (that is, the Christian population to the west, which was part of post-Carolingian Europe, the eastern part of which was ruled by the German emperor) were beginning to pay attention to this emerging state centered around Gniezno. Early recorded mention of Mieszko’s doings has come down to us from a Jewish trader, Ibrahim Ibn Jakub, who, while on business in Magdeburg in 966, learned of the existence of a well-organized state that was conquering some of the Slavic tribes to its west. A Saxon monk noted the existence of the dynamically expanding state, which likewise caught the attention of Otto I. Titled Emperor of the Romans by the pope only in 962, the German Otto had pretentions to the same region. Before long, Mieszko’s realm came to be referred to as Poland, or the land of the Poles. It is customary to date the beginnings of the history of Poland to 966. This choice of date reflects a momentous decision made that year. Until this point, the Polanie and the neighboring tribes in the vicinity of Central and Eastern Europe were for the most part pagans. This was not true of the Germans further west, who had already converted to Christianity in late antiquity or the early medieval period; nor was it true for the Moravians, who had witnessed the ninth-century ministry of Cyril and Methodius, the missionaries to the Slavs, although by this time—a century later—they were under German influence. (Note that Kyivan Rus’, lying further to the east, was baptized only as of 988, but its baptism came from Greek sources, that is, Constantinople.) In *\n\nIbid., 27.\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nConnecting with the West\n\n13\n\nthis part of the world, of world-historical significance was what religion these pagan rulers chose, and at whose hands they were baptized. It is in 966 that the baptism of Mieszko—head of the Gniezno state, this nascent Polish polity—took place. It is both interesting and important that this was facilitated not by the Germans but by a Bohemian (Czech) connection. A Czech state had emerged around the turn of the eighth and ninth centuries; first baptized by Saint Methodius, the Czechs relatively quickly came under Bavarian influence, their church under the bishop of Regensburg. In 965 Mieszko strengthened the connection with this Slavic neighbor by marrying a Bohemian princess, the daughter of Boleslav I. This Dubravka, known variously also as Dąbrówka or Dobrava, was a Christian, and she likely brought some Christian clergy with her to Gniezno. The next year, Mieszko accepted baptism at their hands. What is important for the future history of Poland is that this was Western, and not Eastern, Christianity—that is, Mieszko was baptized into the Church of Rome, as it was then known. No less important is that baptism came from Bohemia, not from the imperial power to the west.* Mieszko furthermore took care to ensure that his state was placed under the care of missionaries. As missionary priests were directly subordinated to the papacy and not to a bishop within any given territory, this gave the nascent Polish church more flexibility because it was not placed under another sovereign state. Thus began the Poles’ connection with Roman Catholicism, one that dates back a millennium. It is a connection that has stuck. Until very recently, many people around the world associated Poland above all with the man who, until not so long ago, was head of the Universal Church—Karol Wojtyła, better known as Pope John Paul II. During his first trip to Poland after he became pontiff, John Paul II famously declared to his countrymen that “it was impossible, without reference to Christ, to understand the history of the Polish nation, this great thousand-year-old community that so profoundly shapes my existence and that of each of us.”† While clearly there is much to this statement, one cannot say that the Christianization of Poland or the Poles’ historic identification with Roman Catholicism were inevitable. Nor (as we shall see) is the belief that all “real” Poles have always been, or must be, Roman Catholics borne out by the country’s history, certainly not if one examines that history in its entirety. (Such Polish paradoxes await the patient reader.) The baptism of the Poles clearly came long before the Great Schism of 1054, which henceforth separated Western from Eastern Christianity; however, even in Mieszko’s time one could speak of the Roman Church and the Greek Church. † “Pope John Paul II Speaks in Victory Square, Warsaw, June 2, 1979,” in From Stalinism to Pluralism: A Documentary History of Eastern Europe since 1945, ed. Gale Stokes, 2d ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996), 202. *\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\n14\n\nPoland\n\nSo what motivated Mieszko’s conversion? The baptism of “Poland” into the larger Roman Catholic family appears to have been, above all, a political decision and not simply (if such matters are ever simple!) a matter of spiritual conversion. It likely extended originally only to Mieszko’s court and entourage, who through the person of his wife and her entourage were pulled into the Christian orbit. Surely Mieszko realized that, by accepting Christianity, he would no longer be subject to incursions from the west—at least, the types of incursions from the eastern marches that doubtless had long been intended to turn these Slavic peoples from paganism to Christianity. By converting, he would deny the Holy Roman Empire the pretext to interfere with his state. The fact that the baptism came at the hands of a missionary who was under papal jurisdiction proved important. The Polish church thus would not be subordinated to the Holy Roman Empire or any other lay power. Moreover, as denizens of a Christian power the Poles could now seek to spread Christianity to other pagan tribes in the region (for example, the Pomeranians or the tribes further east), thus expanding their own influence. So much for Mieszko and his entourage, who, as was common elsewhere in medieval Europe, constantly made the rounds of his lands. Perhaps you wonder, what did the common folk think of their ruler’s conversion? Sources on this—as with all of Polish early medieval history—are thin. By this time, nonetheless, the population of Mieszko’s state was already differentiated: Mieszko had a strong army of three thousand men (some of them likely Vikings), advisers, as well as a number of vassals, who all helped him to “rule” over a series of fortified settlements, outside of which lay the farms and forests that provided their inhabitants with much of what they needed. The diet of these early Poles consisted primarily of meat and fish (the latter gaining ground after the introduction of Christianity), barley and millet, peas and lentils, cucumbers and cabbage, cheeses, breads made with a beer leaven, as well as beer and other fermented drinks. Among these settlements and royal residences for the peripatetic king and his entourage were the capital of Gniezno, as well as Poznań and Kruszwica in Greater Poland; Płock in Mazovia; Kraków and Sandomierz in Lesser Poland; and Wrocław, Opole, and Głogów in Silesia. On their outskirts were places where trading took place. Certain settlements on the major overland trade routes were peopled by traders, merchants, and artisans; these locales facilitated the making of connections between Byzantium and Scandinavia along the north–south line as well as between the important east–west destinations of Kyiv and Regensburg. On the Polish market, foreign traders sought furs and hides, honey and wax, even slaves. The idea of replacing pagan gods such as Perun, the god of thunder, with a Christian God received a varied reception in the Polish lands. While many peo-\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nConnecting with the West\n\n15\n\nple rebelled, others came around relatively quickly to support this new worldview. The conversion of Mieszko to Christianity may also have helped to raise the ruler’s profile among the disparate tribes bordering on his state, certainly as more and more conversions took place and the church gained a foothold in the region. The Christian church—which established itself in the Polish lands through the introduction of hermitages and monastic orders, with the Benedictines the most important—surely would support the ruler who shared its beliefs. Mieszko’s baptism brought with it other benefits. He and his state came into the orbit of the West. The nascent Polish state gained international status and recognition of its existence within the Western fold. Witness the fact that Mieszko’s second wife would be the daughter of a Saxon margrave, indicating that the Germans further west considered an alliance with the new convert to be advantageous. Elites within the new country were introduced to high Latin culture and “Western” civilization. Foreign priests and monks (at the outset primarily Czechs, Bavarians, and southern Germans) who came to Poland to help with the conversion process also helped to increase the ranks of the faithful. They brought “Western” ways with them, such as new tools and agricultural methods, not to mention the ways of the church. Establishing churches in Romanesque style (an early and still extant example is the Church of Saint Andrew in Kraków), they maintained relations with their home bases in the West, thus enabling further contacts with places as distant as Italy and France as well as cultural transmission. Yet all such inroads were not made right away. Nor was paganism vanquished overnight. Indeed, we know it was not, as the imposition of the tithe circa 1030 brought about something of a pagan backlash. Time and again the infant Catholic Church faced challenges within this new Polish state, with church authority undermined more than once. Yet, seen in the perspective of the millennium of Polish history, these were but growing pains. The final defeat of paganism in the Polish lands allowed for Roman Catholicism to gain what turns out to be an extraordinarily strong foothold. The Polish people—here, most certainly the common folk, if not always the nobility—would remain loyal to the church throughout the centuries to come. So 966 was a crucial date for the Poles, and for Poland.\n\nThe Brave Exploits of Poland’s First Crowned King\n\nThis is not the sole date worth remembering from the medieval period, however. Let us now turn to the events of the reign of Mieszko’s son and successor, Bolesław I Chrobry (r. 992–1025). The sobriquet of Chrobry (Gloriosus or\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\n16\n\nPoland\n\nChrabri in some early sources) means “the Brave.” Bolesław’s reign straddled the end of the first millennium AD, which brought a new distinction to the land of the princes of the Poles. Mieszko’s son had come to rule over Lesser Poland as a result of the Czech connection. It is Bolesław who would integrate both the Silesian and Lesser Polish lands into the Gniezno state built by the Piasts who preceded him. Bolesław’s father had continued the country’s expansion in the west; this had led to conflicts with the Czechs over control of Silesia as well as attempts to gain territories at the expense of the Slavs beyond the Oder, so as to gain control over that river’s mouth. As would be the case in ensuing years, decades, and centuries, there were conflicts between the Poles and the Holy Roman Empire (or parts thereof). Yet for a miraculous moment during the reign of Bolesław, the relationship between the two polities was entirely positive. To understand the reasons for this, we must backtrack for a minute and focus on the church in the Polish lands, which was strengthened in the wake of the murder, by pagan Prussians, of the former bishop of Prague in the year 997. Known variously as Vojtěch (in Czech), Wojciech (Polish), or Adalbert (English), the peripatetic former-bishop-turned-missionary had made his way to Poland, where he was received with great veneration; with the significant support of Bolesław, he set off to convert the pagans to the north. Despite some early successes along the Baltic Sea coast, he met an untimely death there when some Prussians came to suspect he was a Polish spy. Learning of the fate of the revered missionary, Bolesław sought permission to ransom the body of the martyr and bring it back to Gniezno. The price the pagans extracted from the Polish ruler was the weight of Vojtěch’s body in gold—no small sum. But it was a valuable relic for the young Polish church. Before two years had passed, the Church of Rome had canonized Vojtěch, bishop, missionary, and martyr. This new development did not elude the other major power in the West: the Holy Roman Emperor. In the year 1000, Emperor Otto III traveled to Gniezno to pay his respects to the remains of Saint Vojtěch. In this context of demonstrable Polish piety, the emperor reaffirmed the independence of the Polish church and established further bishoprics. Thus, in addition to Gniezno (now an archbishopric), three new bishoprics were installed in Kraków (in Lesser Poland), Wrocław (in Silesia), and Kołobrzeg (in Pomerania, along the Baltic). That their jurisdiction coincided with the borders of the state was a positive sign, and one that boded well for the strengthening of a Polish church that sought to retain its independence despite its proximity to the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nConnecting with the West\n\n17\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nIf we are to believe the anonymous monk who first wrote of the “deeds of the princes of the Poles” (Gesta principum Polonorum) in the early twelfth century, there was an important political dimension to this meeting between Otto III and Bolesław as well. The Anonymous took pains to illustrate the wealth of the Polish state. In his words, the Polish ruler received the Holy Roman Emperor with the honor and ceremony with which such a distinguished guest, a king and Roman emperor, should fittingly be received. Marvelous and wonderful sights Boleslaw set before the emperor when he arrived: the ranks first of the knights in all their variety, and then of the princes, lined up on a spacious plain like choirs, each separate unit set apart by the distinct and varied colors of its apparel, and no garment there was of inferior quality, but of the most precious stuff that might anywhere be found. For in Boleslaw’s time every knight and every lady of the court wore robes instead of garments of linen or wool, nor did they wear in his court any precious furs, however new, without robes and orphrey. For gold in his days was held by all to be as common as silver, and silver deemed as little worth as straw. So when the Roman emperor beheld his glory and power and richness, he exclaimed in admiration, “By the crown of my empire, the things I behold are greater than I had been led to believe,” and after taking counsel with his magnates he added before the whole company, “Such a great man does not deserve to be styled duke or count like any of the princes, but to be raised to a royal throne and adorned with a diadem in glory.”*\n\nAs the story goes, Otto then placed his crown atop Bolesław’s head, indicating his wish that the Polish ruler be crowned. The two men also exchanged gifts. Otto bestowed upon his Polish counterpart the spear of Saint Maurice; this insignia representing the power of the German kings and emperors is still today in Polish possession. Bolesław reciprocated with no less royal gifts: the shoulder of Saint Vojtěch as well as three hundred armored warriors. Aptly symbolic, the very dead holy relic and still very much alive military assistance were doubtless both appreciated by the Holy Roman Emperor. This “coronation” at the hands of Otto III presaged the official coronation of Bolesław the Brave. For the Polish ruler was eventually to receive a crown, with the permission of Pope John XIX. Crowned on April 18, 1025, Bolesław died later that same year. The victory was more symbolic than anything else, but it demonstrated how the young Polish state was truly entering into the European scene. Bolesław the Brave was crowned by both temporal and spiritual *\n\nGesta principum Polonorum, 35, 37.\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\n18\n\nPoland\n\nauthorities, and this dual blessing helped to strengthen his claims—and those of his descendents—to the right to rule. This was not the reason that Bolesław was called the Brave, however. He faced up to many various forces—including Otto III’s relative and successor, Henry II, who unlike his cousin sought to undermine the Polish ruler. Polish-German wars ensued, and they continued throughout Bolesław’s reign. In 1002 an attempt was even made on the Polish ruler’s life. Perhaps this only served to galvanize the brave Pole. Availing himself of substantial military forces—thousands of knights in armor as well as foot soldiers—Bolesław expanded Poland’s frontiers in all directions. He gained access to the Baltic Sea, in the north. He acquired territories in the vicinity of Kraków, stretching all the way to the Carpathian Mountains. Further south, he came to occupy Prague for a time. He was even raised to the Bohemian throne, though he was then expelled when he refused to render homage to the Holy Roman Emperor (for whom the independent-minded Polish ruler was becoming an increasing threat). He even held some Upper Lusatian lands, peopled by other Slavic tribes to his west, first as imperial fiefs and later independently. This first Polish king likewise turned his attention eastward, to the Kyivan state. As early as 1012, Bolesław got involved in Kyivan Rus’ on account of his Ruthenian son-in-law, Sviatopluk, the eldest son of Volodimer I. The four sons of Volodimer—Sviatopluk, Boris, Gleb, and Yaroslav—vied for the throne of Kyiv. Bolesław’s intervention was not successful, although in the course of this succession conflict two of Sviatopluk’s half-brothers, Boris and Gleb, were murdered. This pair of warrior-princes (by some accounts rather militarily inept or even pacifistic) would become the first Orthodox saints of Kyivan Rus’. Bolesław nonetheless intervened once more in the affairs of Kyivan Rus’ in 1018. The story of the encounter is told rather entertainingly (if improbably) by the Anonymous. The invading Bolesław found the ruler of Kyivan Rus’, Yaroslav the Wise, out fishing—in other words, completely unprepared to defend his state. If one is to believe the Anonymous, Polish cooks on one bank of the River Bug pelted the Ruthenes with offal, while the Ruthenes hurled abuse and showered them with arrows from the other bank. This time, the Poles triumphed. Bolesław occupied the capital Kyiv, and ultimately made off with much booty and many prisoners of war; some say he wished to rule instead of his son-in-law Sviatopluk. While Sviatopluk eventually got rid of his father-in-law, he was not able to hold onto the throne; it was his younger brother Yaroslav who eventually triumphed.

The legend may in fact refer to Bolesław II, who captured Kyiv in 1069 and who may have struck the gate in this way. Yet the story persists and is reinforced by a potent symbol of material culture. For from the fourteenth century onward a copy of this jagged sword, henceforth known as Szczerbiec, was the coronation sword of the kings of Poland. The Polish state underwent upheaval in the wake of Bolesław’s death in 1025. The king’s sons fought over the throne, their Latin education clearly not making them any more civil in their relations with each other. The ensuing period included a popular revolt and foreign interventions. An example of the latter: in 1038 Bohemians sacked the capital of Gniezno, including its churches, and absconded with the remains of Saint Vojtěch. This caused one of Bolesław’s grandsons—the peripatetic Kazimierz the Restorer (Odnowiciel) (r. 1034–1058)—to move his capital south to Kraków. Bolstered by good relations with both the Germans and Kyivan Rus’, Kazimierz managed to reunite much of the country he had inherited from his father, Mieszko II (r. 1025–1034), which consisted of the central Polish lands of Greater and Lesser Poland, Silesia, Mazovia, and Cuiavia. He began the\n\n20\n\nPoland\n\nprocess of reestablishing the foundations for church and state development, one of the reasons he is remembered in history as the Restorer. Kazimierz was as much an innovator as a restorer, however, and he changed the way the country functioned. How? By bestowing land on both his knights and the church. No longer would the knights be supported directly by the ruler, to whom the entirety of the state personally belonged. In exchange for becoming self-supporting landowners the knights would be obliged to render military service to their ruler, under the regional leadership of a palatine, as needed. As to the church, it would no longer have to depend on the tithe (perhaps a good thing, given the popular revolt) but would become a powerful landowner in its own right. While freeing the monarch from direct responsibility for the well-being of his subjects, Kazimierz’s innovation nonetheless meant that, with time, both knights-turned-nobles and clergy would have the wherewithal to challenge the monarch for power and influence within the Polish lands.\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nChurch versus State?\n\nThe rising power of both would be felt by Kazimierz’s eldest son. The Anonymous called this son Bolesław the Bountiful (Latin: Largus; Polish: Szczodry). He has gone down in history, however, as Bolesław the Bold (Polish: Śmiały). He reigned from 1058 to 1079. Bolesław was crowned king of Poland in 1076, the third ruler to achieve this honor. His coronation took place one year before his counterpart in the Holy Roman Empire, Henry IV, made his famous trip to Canossa. Henry had been excommunicated in 1076, the previous year, by Pope Gregory VII and needed to make penance to be reunited with the church. Bolesław II sided with the pope, not the emperor, in this famous dispute, known as the Investiture Conflict. Yet soon the Polish king also found himself in hot water. Back home in Poland, there was still support for his younger brother Władysław Herman. And not all the noble knights in the different parts of the country were happy about the increasing centralization of the country, which meant that more power was concentrated in the hands of the monarch. While Bolesław the Bold was engaged in the east, helping to place the eldest son of Yaroslav the Wise upon the throne in Kyivan Rus’, rebellion broke out back home in 1079—a rebellion that apparently was supported by the bishop of Kraków, Stanisław. The king had Stanisław executed in 1079 for treason. Some maintain that the king killed the bishop himself. The contemporary\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nConnecting with the West\n\n21\n\nsources on the Kraków conflict are all silent, which has allowed many different parties to interpret the events as they each saw fit—whether in favor of the church (Stanisław) or the state (Bolesław). What is clearly evident is that Stanisław’s death provided the impetus for the opposition to the king to coalesce. This somewhat enigmatic event of 1079 became the most famous instance in Polish history of the struggle between church and state. In it one can see parallels to the more famous but much later clash between Thomas à Becket and King Henry II of England—with one major difference. Henry II did not have to escape into exile afterward as Bolesław did. Ultimately, Stanisław’s murder proved more injurious for the Polish state—especially as Boleslaw’s successor, Władysław Herman, proved a weak ruler. Nonetheless, the tragedy did provide Poland with its first native martyr, for Stanisław, bishop of Kraków, was canonized in 1253. The fact that Bolesław had to go into exile following the murder suggests a degree of influence of the church and church hierarchy within the medieval state. Yet the church had only recently begun to rise again, after a surge of popular protests circa 1030 that threatened to undermine both religion and state. Paradoxically, it was Bolesław the Bold who, following in the footsteps of his father, strengthened the church in Poland—in part as a result of his strong relationship with Pope Gregory. Church historians contend that it was only during Bolesław’s rule that the church in Poland, like the Polish kingdom, was truly on a strong footing once again. And indeed, the Polish king had sought to strengthen the church at all levels. Bolesław saw to it that a series of bishoprics (including a new one in the Mazovian town of Płock) came under the metropolitan of Gniezno. He strengthened the church on a diocesan level and founded a Benedictine monastery in the environs of each cathedral, each to be supported by landholdings and other sources of permanent income. Still standing today, for example, is the beautifully situated monastery of Tyniec, perched aside the Vistula River not far from Kraków. And it was from Tyniec as well as from other Polish monasteries that there emanated some major achievements of Western Christian culture—not only the religious rites of Western Christianity but also the use of the Latin language. In many ways Bolesław the Bold was one of the early kingdom’s better monarchs. Legend has it that he commanded iron piles to be pounded into the riverbeds of the Dnieper, Saale, and Elbe Rivers to signify where the borders of the Polish state should reach. This suggests Bolesław the Bold had ambitions to extend the country significantly westward in the direction of the Elbe and the Saale as well eastward toward the Dnieper. If it had not\n\n22\n\nPoland\n\nbeen for his ill-fated clash with Bishop Stanisław, perhaps the kingdom of Poland might have been strong enough to withstand the forces that would wrack the medieval state before another series of kings literally pieced it back together again. The new Polish state, emerging into the light of history, established itself on the eastern fringes of the West. In the shadow of the Holy Roman Empire, it nonetheless managed to retain its independence. A key factor in its development was Mieszko’s acceptance of Western Christianity and later the acquisition of a royal crown from the West and the respect that came with this honor. Yet the trajectory of the young Polish polity was not the proverbial upward one. The new state alternated between moments of triumph and moments of tragedy. Its relationship with the church had its rocky moments, for example, as attested by the murder of Bishop Stanisław at the hands of King Bolesław the Bold. Nonetheless, the acceptance of Christianity by the Polish masses would shape the rest of Poland’s history—to the extent that Poles are now generally considered to be among the world’s most devout Catholics and most devoted servants of the Holy See. This doubtless was the greatest legacy of Mieszko, the first of the Piast rulers.\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nThe Fall and Rise of the Piasts\n\nThe saga of the Piasts began with the story of the poor but hospitable peasant plowman Piast, who with his wife entertained two mysterious guests. The guests not only worked miracles. They helped turn a spotlight on the coming of age of Piast’s son, Siemowit. Aptly so. For it was Siemowit who reportedly ousted Popiel, the ruler who according to legend was devoured by rats. Several generations later (if the Anonymous’s account is to be believed), it was the turn of Piast’s great-great-grandson Mieszko to rule. He and his descendants would be the princes of the Poles. It was only later, however, that this native ruling clan was labeled the Piast dynasty. Odd as it may seem, this is the only dynasty to rule Poland that can be thought of in ethnic Polish terms. This is one of the paradoxes of Polish history: only in medieval times was there truly a “Polish” dynasty. This later led the term “Piast” to become synonymous with a native Pole. The use of the word to describe native sons—as we shall see—was especially true when it came time to elect kings . . . but that is a story for a later chapter. Despite a strong beginning, the Piast dynasty eventually fell upon challenging times. The murder of Bishop Stanisław at the hands of Bolesław the Bold in 1079 played a pivotal role in this development. The revolt of the\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nConnecting with the West\n\n23\n\nPolish knights, appalled by the murder of the bishop (or at least using it as a pretext to continue the conflict), forced Bolesław the Bold into exile. The fact that Bolesław had to give up his throne caused huge repercussions for the still relatively young Polish kingdom. The situation remained shaky under his brother, Władysław Herman (1079–1102), who never was crowned king. Before long, the Polish state went through a period that used to be termed “feudal disintegration.” Perhaps it is best considered an experiment in sharing the burdens and responsibilities of ruling, an experiment that went horribly wrong. The problems began in 1138, with the death of another Polish ruler named Bolesław—Władysław Herman’s son Bolesław III Krzywousty, known as the Wrymouth (1102–1138). Although he was a much better ruler than his father, the Wrymouth encountered numerous serious difficulties during his reign: first involving his elder brother, Zbigniew, then involving the Germans. To be sure, he did manage to gain control over the Baltic Sea region of Pomerania, which means that his Poland had borders in many ways close to those of present-day Poland. Nonetheless, in order to maintain control over these territories he was forced to swallow a bitter pill: Bolesław was compelled to pay homage to the Holy Roman Emperor. Clearly something had to be done to beef up Poland’s position. Taking example from the Kyivan grand dukes to the east, who also faced the daunting challenge of how to control a large and lightly populated territory, Bolesław the Wrymouth decided to parcel out control over the country among his numerous sons, and he wrote that stipulation into his will. His eldest son, Władysław—the so-called “senior prince”—would control the choicest lands, including the capital of Kraków, and his remaining sons would be awarded the lesser territories. Each would be responsible for keeping in line his own region, and the sometimes troublesome landowning magnates within it. The younger Piasts would learn how to rule, and thus be ready to take over after the death of the senior prince. More a system of rotation than primogeniture, despite its complexities this plan seemed to make sense while promising to keep the dynasty in control of the entirety of the Polish lands. Yet this experiment in dynastic power sharing backfired. Before too long, the princely Piast brothers ceased to work together. The new system simply provided each brother with a provincial base from which he could entertain pretentions to the lands of his siblings. Nor did the country’s leading churchmen and powerful magnates cooperate. This led to civil war—and to the involvement of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. The latter tried to bolster the position of Władysław—without success. Wrymouth’s oldest son and\n\n24\n\nPoland\n\nonetime senior prince is remembered as Władysław the Exiled (1138–1146), for such was his fate. Over the next decades the Wrymouth’s experiment disintegrated, and its results were not at all what the king had imagined. The country was torn apart, not strengthened. Ultimately, the Piast dynasty split along regional lines. Five main branches were established: Lesser Poland, Greater Poland, Silesia, Mazovia, and Pomerania, each controlling a different part of the formerly unitary Polish state. And these were subject to further division and fragmentation: the Wrymouth’s sons also managed to sire numerous sons and naturally wanted to provide for them. The most egregious (and lasting) example of fragmentation, the Silesian branch of the Piast dynasty, eventually disintegrated into some nine separate lines. The latter increasingly came under the influence of their neighbors to the west—as did the Piasts to the north, who had to contend with the new and rising March of Brandenburg. It would take another two hundred years before the crown was regained and monarchy reestablished in the Polish lands.\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nThe Menace from the East\n\nThe Polish lands, subdivided into provinces and more, were in no position to fend off enemies who would prove frequent callers over the next centuries. These were the Mongols, also known (particularly later, when they were based in the region of the Black Sea) as Tatars. Who has not heard of Genghis Khan? This brilliant Mongol leader was one of the most famous military commanders of all time. He assembled an enormous army of fighters on horseback, mobile, swift, and well trained. And they attacked: first in northern China, Siberia, and Central Asia, and then they proceeded west toward the Caspian Sea, through the Caucasus and the Crimea, to engage the Europeans for the first time in battle in 1223, in the vicinity of the Sea of Azov. This Asian people proved to be a true terror for the Europeans, who lacked light cavalry, and thus could easily be outmaneuvered. Although Genghis Khan died in 1227, leadership of the Mongol forces in the West was assumed by his grandson, Batu Khan. The latter, with his Golden Horde, made light work of the Ruthenes: Riazan, Moscow, Suzdal, and Vladimir all fell. In 1240 the Mongols made their way across the Dnieper River and sacked Kyiv. In 1241 the Mongol forces made their way into Poland and Hungary. The latter was their ultimate goal: the Hungarian king Bela IV had refused to agree to Mongol demands and had even killed their emissaries. The Mongols attacked the Poles in order to keep them from coming to the aid of the\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nConnecting with the West\n\n25\n\nHungarians. In this, the Mongols were successful. Poles proved no match for the Mongol hordes. City after city fell. First Sandomierz was sacked, then Kraków; various localities in Silesia—for the Mongols pressed on further west—witnessed the escape of populations into more distant fortresses or even the forests. By April, the Mongols had made their way to Legnica (German: Liegnitz). The Polish duke Henryk the Pious (Pobożny), ruler of Lesser Poland, was there, waiting for Czech allies, who never arrived. However, he had the support of two religious crusading orders, the Knights of the Cross and the Knights Templars. What took place was nothing any of these central European forces had ever experienced before. The Mongols not only had their advantage of speed and mobility over the heavily armored western troops; they also used irritating gasses and smoke to disorient the Poles and their allies. The result was out-and-out slaughter. Henryk perished, as did most of his men. Even his dead body met a gruesome fate: Mongols paraded his head on a stick outside the fortress of Legnica, which they were not able to penetrate. The Asian horde continued on its way to Hungary, which subsequently fell to them. Only news of the death of the great khan Ögödei brought about their return home, which saved the lands further west from devastation. This defeat at Legnica would have further repercussions for the Poles. Henryk had been in the process of uniting the Polish lands, and his death left them divided and weak. Even today Poles have not forgotten the Mongol invasion. Evidence of this is seen by practically every visitor to the city of Kraków. The southern Polish town was sacked in 1241, its population annihilated, and the city burned in its entirety—with one exception: the only Cracovians to survive were those who hid in the Romanesque church of Saint Andrew, solidly built of durable stone. In commemoration of the invasion, every hour, on the hour, a trumpeter plays a tune from one of the towers of Saint Mary’s Church, on the corner of the main market square. The tune comes to a sudden end—as if the trumpeter were felled by an arrow as he played, summoning Cracovians to come to the defense of the city. This melody is known as the Hejnał. Thus, the legend of the trumpeter of Kraków is kept alive. The Hejnał is even played by Polish radio at noon every day (a tradition that began in the early part of the twentieth century), thus reminding the entire Polish community of this historic conflict between West and East. At this time, of course, it was the East that proved victorious.* *\n\nKraków has yet another tradition connected to the Mongol invasion. That is the Lajkonik—a person wearing Mongol dress, atop a hobbyhorse, who makes his appearance in the city every summer, on the eighth day following Corpus Christi.\n\n26\n\nPoland\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nWhile the Poles clearly smarted from the Mongol invasions (they were invaded several more times that same century), the lands further east of them were hit harder. Kyiv (today’s capital of Ukraine) was sacked. Repeated incursions led to a period known as the Tatar Yoke, when the Ruthenian principalities were subjugated to the Mongols. They had to pay tribute to the khanate for several centuries—and this period influenced later developments in what would come to be called Muscovy or Muscovite Russia. Why is this worthy of our attention? Because the weakness of the Ruthenian principalities had repercussions for another neighbor of the Poles as well. The power vacuum in the east meant that the Lithuanians, located to the northeast of the Polish state, were able to expand in a southerly direction, into territories that in better times had belonged to Rus’, which was now in no position to defend itself. With time, the Lithuanians would come to occupy a territory that reached far beyond their northeastern lands: from the basin of the Rivers Neman (Polish: Niemen) and Dnieper all the way to the Black Sea. They would also gain sovereignty over the East Slavic population of that vast region. (While the East Slavs dominated numerically, other peoples came to settle in Lithuania, including a Kipchak Turkic–speaking Jewish sect known as the Karaites.) Not a Slavic people themselves, the Lithuanians speak an ancient Baltic language that is related to that of the pagan Prussians and the Latvians. Yet their fate was much different from these peoples’ fate. Their star was only beginning to rise . . .\n\nThe Menace from the North\n\nThe menace from the east was not the only threat posed to the Polish lands at this time. Witness the rise of a new and somewhat unusual power in the north: the Teutonic Knights. The real name of this curious entity was the Order of the Hospital of the Blessed Virgin Mary of the German House of Jerusalem. A religious order of crusading knights, it originated in the Holy Land in the twelfth century, just in time to be expelled by the Moslems. The order then, after reconstituting itself, eventually—and significantly for us— made its way to Hungary and Transylvania, ready to fight the infidel on any front (as long as payment were forthcoming). In 1226 Konrad of Mazovia extended an invitation to the Teutonic Knights to settle along the border of Mazovia and Prussia, as he needed help in fighting the pagan Prussians and Yazwingians of the northern seacoast. It seemed a good idea at the time—Konrad thought he would gain support in the fight against the pagans, which would allow him to focus his\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press.

The Polish prince did not realize the Pandora’s box he opened in this fashion. The Teutonic Knights were not content to fight the Prussians for Konrad. They asked for further land grants—the Mazovian prince had given them the district of Chełmno (German: Kulm) as well as the right to control the territories they subdued. In this, they sought both papal and imperial support, both of which proved forthcoming. In the process they painted a rather false picture of their agreement with Konrad, demonstrating a lack of scruples that would continue to characterize their work in the region. Given this highly placed support, the Polish princes were soon powerless to regain control over the north. Furthermore, the Teutonic Knights worked together with the support of the so-called Knights of the Sword, who sought conquests further north along the Baltic, in the region of the River Dvina. The Teutonic Knights became an efficient, impersonal machine of an organization, able to hold the lands they had conquered with the sword. These lands were soon populated, at the Order’s behest, by German settlers—naturally, under the rule of the Knights. They founded hundreds of villages as well as many towns, including Königsberg (today’s Kaliningrad, in Russia) and Marienburg (Polish: Malbork). The Knights encouraged and facilitated trade, in general appearing to further development of the region. This earned them the admiration and the support of the papacy, the Holy Roman Empire, the international trading organization known as the Hanseatic League, and others. The work of this religious order was regarded by some to be very unChristian. The Knights energetically set about converting the pagan peoples of the north (at the point of a sword) and plagued neighboring Catholics long after their evangelizing services were no longer necessary. The crusading order made great strides within a very short space of time, and toward the end of the thirteenth century the hold of the Teutonic Knights on the Prussian lands was complete. They now ruled what we have come to call Prussia, with the support of both the pope and the German emperor. In their crusading zeal, they well nigh annihilated the pagans whom they were supposed to convert. This has led one historian to call them “the incarnation of the most un-Christian elements of the Christian world.”* They were a formidable foe. These were trying times for the already weakened Poles, weakened by fragmentation and infighting. During this period, Poland—insofar as it ex*\n\nNorman Davies, God’s Playground: A History of Poland (New York: Columbia University Press, 1982), 1:91.\n\nConnecting with the West\n\n29\n\nisted in anyone’s mind—lost its power and influence in the region. These various menaces only exacerbated the problem, leaving anyone wishing to reunite the country with a major challenge.\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nThe German Presence\n\nIn the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, another development worth noting was the influx of some 250,000 German settlers into the Polish lands. The German label we understand broadly as those speaking unintelligible languages: they could be of Dutch or Flemish as well as German origin. By the thirteenth century, new ideas from the West were not only making their way to the rulers and their courts, the church, and the wealthier barons and magnates, they were also penetrating Polish society in general as well. Many settlers were recruited from various parts of the Holy Roman Empire. They brought in medieval technological innovations, introducing mills (that is, the harnessing of water power), better ploughs, and the like. These Germans were settled on lands not subject to the whims of the prince but, rather, under terms referred to as German Law, ius teutonicum. In the Polish towns, a new form of governance commonly referred to as Magdeburg Law was established. Magdeburg Law established municipal autonomy and would eventually lead to municipal self-rule, providing for aldermen and a mayor (wójt). Magdeburg had been the closest significant German town, and it served as the pattern for many a Polish town by the end of the thirteenth century. Towns founded on this principle inherited a set pattern of spatial development: an urban grid opening onto a central market square, with a church at its corner—a pattern still found all over Poland. At the market square, knights also could acquire various goods, as could peasants, who monetized their grain to buy salt, metal tools, and clothing. Magdeburg Law was first introduced into the Silesian town of Złotoryja, known for its gold mines, in 1211. The same municipal rights were conferred upon Kraków at its reestablishment, following the Mongol invasion, in 1257. The spread of Magdeburg Law continued to radiate throughout the Polish lands, although the German presence itself was felt most in the western part of the country. The new influx of foreigners led to a mosaic of peoples. The towns in the Polish lands were increasingly German and German-speaking, especially in the Silesian territories adjacent to the Holy Roman Empire. Polish was the language of the peasants in the surrounding territories, though clergymen throughout the country tended to favor the maintenance of the local language\n\n30\n\nPoland\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nin their schools to keep Germans from becoming too influential within the ranks of the church, as seen in the 1285 synod at Łęczyca. That Polish was indeed being used by clergy can be seen from the earliest extant Polish-language document, the Holy Cross Sermons; these texts, containing a mixture of Latin and Polish, were written at the end of the thirteenth or beginning of the fourteenth century. All told, these new developments led to an economic and cultural boom. Villages began to specialize in the cultivation of grain and the breeding of livestock, which later were traded in or near the towns. In addition to trade, the rapidly multiplying towns could become centers for a full complement of urban handicrafts, the work of guilds. Schools run by the cathedrals, monasteries, and others paid attention to both Latin and the vernacular in their teaching. The Polish lands were looking more and more like the lands to their west. So all was not lost. Even if Poland was in pieces, the lands were developing and its people were thriving. Nor had the broader population lost its identity and connection to the Polish past. Indeed: despite a series of hurdles, an entity to be called Poland once more would come together, as a monarchy, in the early fourteenth century.\n\nPoland: From Lows to Highs—or the Triumph of the Vertically Challenged . . .\n\nThis coming together was the work of one of the Piast princes, Władysław Łokietek. A grandson of Duke Konrad of Mazovia, Łokietek hailed from neighboring Cuiavia, in the central-northern reaches of the Polish lands. His sobriquet was “Elbow-High,” which suggests the prince was short of stature. What Łokietek lacked in height, he surely made up for in chutzpah. This plucky—and lucky—Piast prince would begin what can be seen as an upward trajectory for the Poles. The vertically challenged Łokietek was chosen prince of Greater Poland after the death of a different Piast ruler, Przemysł II (1257–1296), who was assassinated on Ash Wednesday on orders of the margraves of Brandenburg. The German margraves were unhappy with Przemysł’s attempts to unify the Polish lands: Przemysł had brought together Greater Poland and the seacoast region known as Gdańsk-Pomerania, and in 1295 was even crowned king in Gniezno, albeit of those two regions alone. Łokietek hoped to build on these achievements. In his race to consolidate his hold over these lands, however, the young\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\nConnecting with the West\n\n31\n\nPiast made several missteps and, in the process, alienated some of his subjects. This led to Łokietek being outmaneuvered by his powerful neighbor, the king of Bohemia, Václav (Wenceslas) II. Václav was son of the ambitious Přemysl Otakar I, who had made an unsuccessful bid for the imperial crown that went instead to Rudolf Habsburg. Ambitious like his father, Václav nonetheless sought to expand eastward (into the Polish lands), and not westward (into the Austrian lands). The Bohemian king seized control over Gdańsk-Pomerania from the short Piast prince and subsequently conquered further Polish territories. More significantly, Václav managed to get himself crowned king of Poland in Gniezno in 1300. The long-standing tradition of crowning only members of the Piast dynasty as king of Poland was broken. The coronation of his Bohemian rival might have put an end to Łokietek’s ambitions—or worse. He was forced to flee the country. Legend tells us how the plucky Polish Piast hid from Václav’s troops in one of the limestone caves at Ojców. A spider wove a large web over the entrance to Łokietek’s cave before the troops arrived, which convinced them their quarry was not to be found inside. The Piast was aided in other, more prosaic ways as well. One was the problem faced by many a medieval dynasty: life was brutish and short. The reign of King Václav II came to an end with his sudden death in 1305. His son and successor, also named Václav (who had become king of Hungary before inheriting Bohemia and Poland from his father), was assassinated in Bohemia the following year. The extinction of the Czech Přemyslid dynasty left the throne open (in fact, it left several thrones open), which was then contested from all sides. Habsburgs, Luxemburgs, as well as a number of Piast princes (if not Łokietek) all sought to claim the throne. Married to a Bohemian Přemyslid princess, John of Luxemburg ultimately proved victorious—thus initiating a new Bohemian dynasty. He would consider himself also heir to the Polish throne. Tiny but tenacious, Łokietek was not one to abandon the cause of conquest and unification so lightly. Whereas Václav II and subsequent Bohemian monarchs had found support in the Germanized towns, the Piast prince managed to rally the knights (if not the towns) to his side. And he was willing to fight. With Hungarian help, Łokietek reconquered Lesser Poland, Cuiavia, and other territories, thus establishing himself as a legitimate ruler of the Polish lands circa 1306. Holding onto them proved a challenge: for example, at one point burghers rebelled in Kraków and other towns of Lesser Poland, and they had to be subdued. The Polish unifier sought to rid Kraków of the miscreants by use of a shibboleth. Those burghers who could pronounce the four words “soczewica, koło, miele, młyn” (lentil, wheel,\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press. All rights reserved.\n\n32\n\nPoland\n\ngrinds, mill) were allowed to stay. Native German speakers stumbled over the pronunciation of the Polish letters “ł” and “s,” which allowed the authorities to shuffle and rearrange the city’s population. Henceforth, the Kraków burghers would find it politic to Polonize. The process of unification was anything but smooth. Nonetheless, the Piast was persistent—and his persistence paid off. The sixty-year-old Łokietek was crowned King Władysław Łokietek in 1320. His coronation on January 20 of that year took place not in Gniezno but in Kraków, which had been gaining in political significance since Kazimierz the Restorer moved there in the eleventh century. Still, the Elbow-High succeeded in unifying only two provinces: Lesser Poland and Greater Poland. His Poland had no Mazovia, no Prussia (despite Łokietek’s best efforts, the Teutonic Knights had seized control there), no Gdańsk-Pomerania (treacherously taken by the Teutonic Knights), and no Silesia (the Silesian Piasts did not feel compelled to subordinate themselves to the upstart Łokietek, and they remained firmly in the Bohemian orbit). Once again coronation was an important symbolic act, if still just a beginning. The return of the Piasts to the crown and the dynasty’s subsequent strengthening were made possible by several developments. Initially, a series of succession pacts among the Piast princes resulted in some consolidation, leaving certain territories in Łokietek’s hands. This was no guarantee of success, though: the efforts of earlier unifiers—Przemysł as well as Henryk Probus, who had sought to unite Silesia and Lesser Poland—were cut short by assassination. Yet Łokietek importantly secured the support of Pope John XXII. The pope actually preferred Poland to be an independent entity. Why was that? Because as a papal fief Poland paid the so-called Peter’s Pence. When the Czech Václav II sat on the throne, the money went into the coffers of the Holy Roman Empire, as the Czech king was the vassal of the emperor. Furthermore, any strengthening of Bohemia would then result in a strengthening of the Holy Roman Empire, which was frequently at odds with the church in Rome. The same would have held true for the rule of the Luxemburg or Habsburg candidates. Łokietek also entered into dynastic alliances. He gained an ally in the impressive and ambitious king of Hungary, Charles Robert of Anjou (son of Charles Martel of Naples). With papal support, the Angevin had succeeded the last of the native Hungarian Árpád dynasty at the beginning of the fourteenth century. Poles and Hungarians both were concerned about the rise of neighboring Bohemia under the Luxemburgs. This Polish-Hungarian alliance—as with so many in the medieval and later periods—was cemented by a marriage. In 1320, Łokietek’s daughter Elżbieta (Elizabeth)\n\nConnecting with the West\n\n33\n\nbecame the third wife of the recently widowed Charles Robert. This was not the only strategic marriage arranged by Łokietek. The Polish king also married his sole surviving son to Aldona (baptized as Anna), the daughter of the Lithuanian prince Gediminas. As luck would have it, this alliance with their aggressive pagan neighbor Lithuania to the east left the Mazovians peeved. However, as we will see, these marriage alliances set the tone for later developments. That Łokietek lived to be seventy-three—he died in 1333—added to the stability of the Polish kingdom, as it reemerged from its fractious and fragmented recent past. And, as only one son survived him, the question of succession was, thankfully, an easy one. This son was named Kazimierz.\n\nCopyright © 2014. Northern Illinois University Press.

His father laid the groundwork for a genuinely hereditary monarchy. It was now up to Kazimierz to consolidate his holdings and lend some stability to the country. That Kazimierz— who would turn out to be the last of the Piast dynasts—was able to do this and more doubtless earned him the sobriquet. Kazimierz proved an able diplomat and an effective nation-builder. As historian Paul Knoll has written, Kazimierz demonstrated, still at an early age, that he was “master of the art of the possible.”* The new king knew how to cut his losses and turn enemies into—well, if not friends, at least then foes not actively seeking his demise. This is seen through a series of negotiations he undertook with his neighbors. As mentioned earlier, the princes of Silesia had long flirted with the Bohemians, preferring to be vassals of the Bohemian king than to return to Polish control. Their continued alienation from the unified Polish state was ultimately confirmed by the Treaty of Namysłów (Namslau) of November 22, 1348. In exchange for this concession, the Luxemburgs of Bohemia renounced their claim to the Polish crown and their claim to control over Mazovia, which then became a fief of the Polish crown. Thus, one potential enemy was neutralized. All the same, this decision to relinquish Polish claims to the territory—which Kazimierz did not relish—was fateful. After this time, the lands and people of Silesia were not to return to a Polish state for another six centuries. (They would become *\n\nPaul W.

His father had defeated the Teutonic Knights at Płowce in 1331, but the victory had not resulted in any return of territory. Kazimierz the Great tried a different, more diplomatic tack. A peace with the Teutonic Knights (negotiated first in 1335 in Visegrád and then in 1343 in Kalisz) gave the Poles some breathing room. The new Polish king was even able to regain strategically located Cuiavia and neighboring Dobrzyń in the north, although he had to relinquish hold over Chełmno to their north. The stabilizing of the long contested borders in the west and the north inclined Kazimierz, determined to strengthen his country’s position in Europe, to set his sights eastward. The objective was the nearby Ruthenian kingdom of Halych and Volodymyr (regnum Galiciae et Lodomeriae). In 1323, the kingdom had come under the control of a Mazovian Piast prince, Bolesław Trojdenowic. His mother, Maria, daughter of Yuri I, was the last of the Rurikids in Halych; her son came to rule after her two brothers had perished in battle with the Tatars. The reign of Yuri II (this was Bolesław’s name, after his conversion to Orthodox Christianity) was nonetheless fraught with tension. In 1340 Yuri was poisoned by his boyars; according to some accounts, they objected to inroads being made within the kingdom by Catholicism, thus destabilizing the region. At the news of the murder of Yuri (who, incidentally, had been put on the throne in part due to Łokietek’s efforts), Kazimierz invaded. The country was still ostensibly under Tatar rule, thus the Polish king’s military campaign could be presented as a crusade of sorts. It is also possible that Yuri himself had earlier offered the Polish king the succession to the Ruthenian throne. Regardless of how motivated, Kazimierz’s efforts at seizing control over the region were successful. The kingdom of Halych and Volodymyr would eventually become known, in Polish history, as Red Ruthenia and Volhynia. However, the Polish takeover "
