        "text": "Ostroh is an ancient town with a rich history and unique architectural monuments. Archaeological excavations demonstrate that the territory of the present town was inhabited from the 4th to 3rd millennium BC. As well, it was a prosperous settlement in ancient Slavic times. The first historical mentions about Ostroh come from 1100. From the 14th to 17th centuries, it was the capital of the Ostroh Principality, which, in turn, was a state with limited sovereignty.\n\nFor almost three centuries, the town was the residence of the Ostroh princely family, which gave Ukraine prominent commanders, patrons, and outstanding national leaders. Even after the demise of the direct descendants of the family of the Ostroh princes, the family crest continued to play the role of the coat of arms of the principality as a certain territorial unit. Thus, according to the will of Yanush Kostiantynovych Ostrozkyi, who had no direct heir, the Ostroh ordination was to pass to the younger branch of the family, namely the princes of Zaslavl. In case of demise of the last, it should have passed to the knights of the Order of Malta with the preservation of the coat of arms of Ostroh princes, which continued to represent the territory of the ordination (the principality). Later the coat of arms of the Ostroh principality appeared on the seals of the Lyubomyrski family, to whom the ownership of the Ostroh ordination passed in 1673. Respectively, they called themselves “xiaze na Ostrogu and Zaslawiu” (“princes of Ostroh and Zaslavl”).\n\nSince the '70s of the sixteenth century, Ostroh, being the capital of the principality, became the largest center of education and culture in Ukraine. Musical art was dramatically developed in the town (e.g. the Ostroh chant). It was the center of prosperous shops of goldsmiths, gunsmiths, potters, etc. Around 1576, thanks to the efforts of Prince Vasyl-Kostiantyn, the first higher school, named by contemporaries “the Academy”, was founded in Eastern Europe. Two types of cultures, Byzantine and Western European, were firstly combined in this higher education institution. This fact provided the foundation of its uniqueness and originality. The Renaissance of the Ukrainian people is assumed to be associated with the Ostroh Academy.\n\nThe ancient Castle Hill is located at the southeastern outskirts of the historic part of Ostroh. The first wooden fortifications are the remnants of the ancient Slavic settlement of the 11th-12th centuries which were situated at this place. They were destroyed by the Tatar hordes in 1241. In the middle of the 14th century, Prince Danylo Ostrozkyi restored the destroyed buildings and built the stone Tower Murovana, located at the southeastern part of the Castle Yard on the hill. It was first mentioned in 1386.\n\nMurovana Tower is a unique defensive structure of medieval Volhynia. It belongs to the type of residential defensive towers. Its walls reach a thickness of 2.6 m in some places. Formerly, stocks of provisions and gunpowder needed for long-term protection of the fortress were stored in the lower tier (at the basement). A deep well also was dug there. The basement and middle floors consist of four rooms. Living rooms were arranged at the top of the structure. Unfortunately, the tower has survived to our times partially rebuilt, without upper floors in particular. In 1797, the upper tier of the building was dismantled and later rebuilt in a modified and simplified form. From 1913 to 1915 the tower was restored for the needs of the museum by the Brotherhood named after princes of Ostroh.\n\nThe New (Round) Tower is located in the southwestern part of the Castle Yard. It got its name from the fact that at the time of construction (late 16th century.) it was the newest structure at Castle Hill. The tower was built in that way it reinforced the corner of the defensive walls and was strategically embedded in the Castle's defense system. The construction is crowned with a strip of hinged loopholes with a blind arcade decorated with figured teeth. Its defenders could fire at the enemy simultaneously from almost forty loopholes and, moreover, the firing area was equal to 270 degrees.\n\nThe Epiphany Cathedral stands in the northern part of Castle Hill. It is unknown exactly when the temple was constructed. According to the legend, Prince Vasyl Krasnyi began construction in the 15th century and his son Kostiantyn Ivanovych finished it. The date of 1521, engraved on the north wall, some researchers associate with the time of its construction, others with the adaptation of the temple for defense requirements. Presumably, its north wall was thickened and equipped with four loopholes for guns and embedded as part of the castle wall. In 1636, after the conversion of the last representative of the family of Ostroh princes to Catholicism, the church was closed. The church stood empty for more than 200 years and during this time it turned into a ruin. It was restored in the period from 1887 to 1891. A temple was rebuilt over the old foundation and designed to replicate the old building. The northern, strongest wall of the old structure was preserved and included in the construction of the new temple. But during the reconstruction certain changes were made and today the temple has practically become a monument of architecture of the 19th century with elements of the 16th century.\n\nLutsk and Tatar gate towers, built in the 16th century, have been also preserved in the town. Due to the fact that the towers performed the same functions, namely the defensive tower and the town gates, they are almost identical. Tatar gate survived less as it lost much of the rounded part of the building. It was named after the area of ​​the town inhabited mainly by Tatars. It was engineered to defend the entrance from the side of the road to Zviahel (contemporary Novohrad-Volynskyi). The monument is a unique type of fortified gates that combines the functions of an entrance gate and a defensive tower.\n\nThe Lutsk Tower was aimed to defend the town from the side of Lutsk. Like Tatarska, it was both a defensive structure and a gate. Initially, it was two-storeyed, later it was completed with an attic with loopholes, which provided the structure the character of civil architecture. On the 10th of December 1985, the Museum of Books and Printing was founded there.\n\nTwo towns with the same name of Mezhyrich belonged to the princes of Ostroh. The town of Mezhyrich Koretskyi, which got its name from the neighboring Korets, was of no particular significance to the princes despite Kostiantyn Ivanovych used the town as his residence in the late fifteenth century. Mezhyrich, which was located near Ostroh, did not get the princes’ attention for a long time as well, although they acquired this village in the 14th century.\n\nOnly at the beginning of the sixteenth century, the Grand Hetman of Lithuania Kostiantyn Ivanovych Ostrozkyi commenced its construction and development. The first stone was laid in the foundation of the Trinity Church. The prince built it as a tribute to the victory over the Muscovites in the battle of Orsha. It was part of his vow to build temples in Vilnius and Ostroh as gratitude for the victory over the Moscow voivode. Since the temple additionally performed defensive functions, loopholes in the walls were considered.\n\nPrince Yanush Ostrozkyi was involved in the development of the town even more. In 1605, he received the privilege of Magdeburg law and the right to hold trade fairs in Mezhyrich. In a few years, the town was fortified with an earthen rampart and bastions. The monastery, which Yanush built for the monks of the Order of St. Francis, was the most fortified. As well, for the needs of the monks, the prince handed over the Orthodox church, which was soon converted into a Catholic church. The monastery had remained Catholic until 1866. Then, it passed to the Orthodox community.\n\nNext to the monastery, Prince Yanush built a large wooden palace with a kitchen with a banquet hall. However, in 1648, the Cossacks burned down the palace, leaving only a stove with the Renaissance style upper part of a chimney.\n\nThe miraculous ancestral icon of the Ostroh princes, the Mother of God of Mezhyrich, has been preserved and still belongs to the monastery. Grand Hetman Konstantin Ivanovich Ostrozky commissioned the icon. The icon of the Virgin and Child was an expression of gratitude for the prince's victory in the battle of Orsha. Although the icon was painted in the Byzantine style, the background got all the hallmarks of the Western European Gothic tradition. In 1779, Pope Benedict the 14th authorized the suffragan of Lutsk Frantsysk Komarnytskyi to crown the Virgin of Mezhyrich and sent a golden crown for this purpose. Later, in the nineteenth century, the Russian Empress Mariia Oleksandrivna presented emeralds for this crown.\n\nVilnius is the capital of Lithuania, which in the days of the Ostroh princes was called Vilno.\n\nThe Ostroh family has been associated with this city since the times when Prince Fedir defended the city from the Knights of the Teutonic Order in 1390.\n\nProbably, since the times of Ivan Ostrozkyi, the princes of Ostroh have had a large brick house in Vilno, next to the modern Castle Street (or Pilies Street). The Grand Lithuanian Hetman Prince Kostiantyn Ivanovych Ostrozkyi was the most closely related to the city.\n\nKostiantyn Ivanovych expanded his possessions in Vilno acquiring a neighboring house from the royal treasurer Fedir Khrebtovych in 1491. In 1508, the prince received from King Sigismund another brick house and an extensive piece of land that once belonged to the rebellious Mykhailo Hlinskyi. Accordingly, the prince already possessed a whole block in Vilno, where he rebuilt a three-story palace from an old house. Here his magnificent residence was arranged. On behalf of the owner, the residence was called “Kostiantynova” for several centuries.\n\nAfter the death of Kostiantyn Ivanovych, these buildings passed to his son Illia and with the death of the latter, Illia's widow Beata and daughter Halshka got these possessions. The residence of the Ostroh princes was so affluent that even Queen Bonna when coming to Vilno lived at the house for several months.\n\nBy the decree of King Sigismund the Old, this residence passed to the youngest son of Prince Kostiantyn Ivanovych Vasyl-Kostiantyn in 1541. Forty years later, Vasyl-Kostiantyn's daughter Kateryna brought it as a dowry to the Radziwill family.\n\nFrom the descriptions of the main house, it is known that the house was elegantly decorated with green tiles and French glass windows.\n\nThe princes of Ostroh, and particularly Kostiantyn Ivanovych, were donors and builders of numerous shrines in Vilno as well. In 1511, the king granted the prince the right to construct a brick church of the Blessed Virgin Mary in place of the old wooden church (now it is the cathedral at 2 Maironis Street). The prince built a three-nave Gothic church with three apses and one dome.\n\nThe promise that he made before the battle of Orsha in 1514 prompted the prince to build even more Orthodox churches in Vilno. The Grand Hetman had promised that in case of triumph over the Muscovites, he would have built two churches in the city: one in honor of the Holy Trinity, the other in honor of St. Nicholas. Deliberately, the prince chose to build new brick ones instead of old wooden churches. He aspired to support the veneration of the three warriors of the pagan prince Olgerd, who had been executed by Prince Olgerd since the soldiers were Christians and refused to consume meat during Lent. After their death, they were canonized. A wooden Trinity Church was built at the place of the saints ’death and St. Nicholas church at their burial site. The modern Church of St. Nicholas is located on Didžioji Street (lit. the Great Street) in a significantly rebuilt state and the Trinity Church is on Aušros Vartų Street.\n\nTwo daughters of Prince Vasyl-Kostiantyn Kateryna Ostrozka and Yelyzaveta Ostrozka were buried in the local church of St. Stanislaus. They were both married to Kryshtof Radziwill (Perun). Originally, Prince Kryshtof's wife was Kateryna and after her death, he was married to his sister Yelyzaveta.\n\nThe former capital of the Kingdom of Poland has always attracted Ostroh princes with ambitious political potential.\n\nThe Grand Hetman of Lithuania Prince Kostiantyn Ivanovych probably visited the capital cities of Vilnius and Krakow more frequently than his own capital Ostroh. This was due to the fact that the position of the closest royal adviser obliged the prince to be constantly with the king.\n\nAfter the victory in the battle of Orsha, the Prince of Ostroh brought to Krakow bronze cannons of Muscovites as trophies. The king ordered to cast the famous bell of Sigismund from those cannons. The bell is still hung on the bell tower of the Wawel Cathedral and it is one of the largest shrines in Poland.\n\nThe Great Hetman took part in the celebrations of the meeting of the Duchess of Milan Bonna Sforza in 1518 and then attended the entire marriage ceremony at the court of the monarch in Krakow. At the court, Kostiantyn Ivanovych found a wife for his eldest son Illia. The young beauty Beata Kosteletska was brought up in the company of Queen Bonna, whom the king and queen betrothed to the young prince Illia Ostrozkyi.\n\nIt is rumored that Beata was the illegitimate daughter of King Sigismund the Old, so he took an active part in her courtship.\n\nThe marriage ceremony itself took place in Krakow. It so happened that during the marriage tournament, King Sigismund Augustus knocked down Prince Illia with a spear, causing him significant injuries. Because of this, the young prince of Ostroh died a few months later. Though, Beata was already pregnant and gave birth to a daughter named Halshka.\n\nThe youngest son of Kostiantyn Ivanovych Prince Vasyl-Kostiantyn first visited Krakow at the age of 22 when he accompanied King Radziwill's second wife Barbara. It happened in 1548. It should be emphasized that Barbara was originally the bride of Prince Illia, but he chose a better candidate – Beata. It is possible that during this trip the young prince Vasyl-Kostiantyn met his future wife Sofia Tarnovska.\n\nIt is unknown what real estate in Krakow was owned by Prince Kostiantyn Ivanovych Ostrozkyi, but his son Vasyl-Kostiantyn, after his marriage to Sophia Tarnovska, received a majestic palace in Krakow. Today it has lost its original appearance, here are the apartments of the President of the City of Krakow and the city government.\n\nPrince Yanush Ostrozkyi, the eldest son of Vasyl-Konstantin and Sophia, was a Krakow castellan for almost thirty years. He and his family lived in the already mentioned house. Later, he acquired two more houses at Market Square. He got the house “Pid baranamy” thanks to his marriage to his second wife Kateryna. From his marriage to his third wife Teofilia, he got a house at the corner of Bratska Street opposite the Cloth Rows (now the palace of the Zbarazh princes).\n\nThe princes of Ostroh considered themselves the descendants of St. Prince Volodymyr. Thereby, they paid close attention to the capital city of the Rurikids – Kyiv. The Ostroh princes had two ancestral tombs, namely the Epiphany Cathedral in Ostroh and the Church of the Assumption of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra. Most of the princes of the Rurik dynasty were buried in Kyiv, so the princes of Ostroh pursued the involvement to the capital city circles. Therefore, Prince Fedir Ostrozkyi, after his military exploits, got tonsured as a monk of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra and died there eventually. Later, the ashes of St. Theodosius, the Prince of Ostroh, were canonized by Peter Mogila. Though, this took place only in the 17th century.\n\nThe princes had ambitions of the mighty principality for life and, therefore, Prince Illia Ostrozkyi buried his father Kostiantyn Ivanovych Ostrozkyi (who was the Grand Hetman of Lithuania) at the Church of the Assumption of the Kyiv-Pechersk Monastery. After, his brother Prince Vasyl-Kostiantyn built an opulent tombstone of red “Hungarian” marble over his father's grave in 1579. This tombstone served not only as a decoration of the tomb but also as an ambitious project. Such tombstones were placed on the tombs of kings. Hence, the prince-royal crown appears on the head of the Prince oh Ostroh. In the meantime, Vasyl-Kostiantyn claimed the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\n\nHis wife and the brother of Prince Mykhailo Ostrozkyi were buried there along with the Grand Hetman. His son Illia Ostrozkyi was buried there as well.\n\nPrince Vasyl-Kostiantyn was the voivode of Kyiv, accordingly, he was often necessitated to stay in Kyiv for voivodship affairs. However, since the wooden castle was a bad shelter, Vasyl-Kostiantyn lived at his own estate. Another reason the prince did not want to spend his own money to strengthen the fortress was that in the 16th century, it was already the property of the king, although the castle once belonged to the prince's ancestors of the Rurik family.\n\nThe prince consistently and faithfully took care of church shrines. This is applicable primarily to the Pechersk Monastery and the Church of the Assumption, which the Prince of Ostroh rebuilt at his own expense.\n\nHe restored the St. Cyril's Monastery, which was destroyed in the 18th century. At the initiative of Prince Vasyl-Kostiantyn, the whole fraternity, together with the abbot Vasyl Krasovskyi, was transferred to Kyiv to the St. Cyril's Monastery in July 1605. The condition of the St. Cyril's Monastery is reported in a document from 1605. Here it is told that the sanctuary was not exploited for several decades. And only with restoration and the transfer of the monks and utensils to Kyiv, the monastery and the church began to be revived.\n\nAfter graduating from the Ostroh Academy, many of its graduates became metropolitans and abbots of Kyiv monasteries. They became the intellectual elite that developed Kyiv in the 17th century. They were the cornerstone of the Brotherhood School foundation, which became the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy subsequently.\n\nThe Polish town of Jaroslav (with the emphasis on the letter “o”) is located near the border of Ukraine. Few people know that it was named after the Rus prince Yaroslav Mudryi and from the 16th to 17th centuries belonged to the princes of Ostroh.\n\nIt passed to the princes of Ostroh as a result of a dynastic marriage between young Oleksandr Ostrozkyi and, already an orphan, Anna of the Kostka family. Anna's father Jan Kostka, the voivode of Sandomierz, had already died at that time, but the significance of the Kostka family, who were direct descendants of the first Polish Piast kings, was still well revered.\n\nDuring those years, Mazovia and Warsaw were recently annexed to Poland (1526) ​​and the Mazovian nobility still had fond memories of their independence. Anna Koschanka's grandmother, who was also called Anna, was proclaimed Queen of Mazovia, but she never managed to maintain her independence. Therefore, it is not surprising that the choice of Prince Vasyl-Kostiantyn was made of the young orphan Anna. The royal ambitions of the Ostroh Prince could be clearly traced in this case as well.\n\nPrince Oleksandr, who got married in 1592, made his main residence Yaroslav and built an attractive palace there. It is still located in the city center at Market Square. However, it is called “Orsetti family tenement house” today because of its later owner.\n\nThe life of the descendants of Oleksandr in Yaroslavl and nearby Lublin is shrouded in a mystical story. All the sons of Oleksandr died at a young age in Yaroslavl: Vasyl died in 1605, Kryshtof passed away in 1606, Oleksandr laid down his life in 1607, Adam-Kostiantyn died in Lublin in 1618, and Yanush-Pavlo gave his life in 1619. The deaths of Oleksandr’s last two sons were especially mysterious. The young princes Adam-Kostiantyn and Yanush-Pavlo were brought up of the Orthodox denomination under the guidance of Zyzanii Tustanovskyi. But after the death of their father, their mother Anna took care of their upbringing together with the Yaroslavl Jesuits. Pope Clement VIII personally took care that the princes became Catholics.\n\nStudying at the Jesuit College of Yaroslav, the boys were not very keen on science. Actually, they were more interested in military affairs. Thus, when the Jesuit teacher said that philosophy was more important than the horse, Kostiantyn replied: “Dear Father, if there are a hundred thousand Tatars and a hundred thousand philosophers in front of them, obviously, the latter ones will not convince Tatars. They should be fought with”. Another case was told by Kaspar Nesetskyi. One of the sons, coming to the teacher, targeted the “Lives of the Saints” and pierced the book deeply with an arrow. The word that the arrow struck was “death”, which was a sign of imminent demise.\n\nReturning home from the Warsaw Sejm on the 10th of April 1618, the young Kostiantyn Oleksandrovych, who had just turned 21, suddenly fell ill and died in Lublin. Exactly a year later, in 1619, the second son Yanush Oleksandrovych died and again in the very same Lublin.\n\nThe version that appeared almost immediately after the death of both princes, remains relevant. They both died in the house of the Lublin notorious nobleman Ludwig Poniatovski. Therefore, both princes could have died of poison or were killed in some other way. Both princes were buried in the church of the Yaroslavl Collegium of All Saints.\n\nPrince Oleksandr was also buried in the Yaroslavl church. His daughter Anna-Aloiza transported his remains there from the Orthodox Epiphany Cathedral in Ostroh. She was buried in Yaroslavl as well. Then, the remains of her father and daughter were transported by the Jesuits from Yaroslavl to the Ostroh Jesuit Collegium, where they were destroyed by Russian soldiers in the first half of the 19th century."
