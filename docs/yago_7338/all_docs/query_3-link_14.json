        "text": "Zamoyski Family, great Polish family whose members influenced Polish politics and history for almost 400 years.\n\nThe family settled in the 15th century at Laznin in the Mazovia area of Poland. Tomasz Lazninski bought an estate there called Zamość, and his sons Florian (died 1510) and Maciej began to use the name Zamoyski. Florian’s grandson Stanisław was the first member of the family to serve as a senator. The Zamoyskis’ rise to power dates from the career of Stanisław’s son Jan Zamoyski (q.v.), who was a major force in the royal politics of Poland throughout his life.\n\nThe next major member of the family, Andrzej Zamoyski (1716–92), was one of the authors of a plan for general reform of the nation offered to the Sejm (Diet) in May 1764. It called for improvements in the parliamentary system, a limitation of the power of the nobles, and the abolition of serfdom. On his own estates Zamoyski replaced serfdom. His proposals, however, were finally rejected by the Sejm in 1780.\n\nHis son Stanisław Kostka Zamoyski (1775–1856) received the title of count. During the insurrection of 1830–31 against Russian rule Stanisław’s son, the second Andrzej Zamoyski (1800–74), was sent to Austria to gain support for the revolt. The uprising failed, and the young Andrzej retired to his family estates. During the rising against Russian rule in 1861– 63, Andrzej took part in drafting a letter to the Russian tsar calling for Polish autonomy, and, although opposed to armed rebellion, he refused to collaborate with the Russian-controlled Polish government. Andrzej was exiled from Poland in September 1863.\n\nAndrzej’s brother Władysław Zamoyski (1803–68) served as an aide-de-camp to Grand Duke Constantine, viceroy of Poland, and then took part in the 1830–31 insurrection. He later emigrated to England, where he represented the interests of the Polish prince Adam Jerzy Czartorski. He organized Polish contingents serving with the Sardinian Army to fight against the Austrians (1848–49), and in 1855 during the Crimean War he commanded a Polish cavalry division in the Turkish Army.\n\nAndrzej’s second son, Franciszek Tomasz Zamoyski, obtained Russian recognition of his family’s title of count in 1884. His son Maurycy Zamoyski (1871–1939) was minister of foreign affairs in the Polish Republic for seven months in 1924."
