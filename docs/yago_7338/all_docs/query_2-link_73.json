        "text": "Ottoman Turks also had their dreams and prophecies. Nations refer to their distant past and draw from the depths of their histories. The history of the Ural-Altaic people is associated with two mythical archetypes that struggle with each other in a fierce dialogue: for one, the reference point is the Wolf, a huge primeval beast that has existed from the beginning of time; the centre of the other is the eternal object of desire and the source of happiness – the Apple (...). The term \"Red Apple\" with reference to a city was interpreted (in the casual language) as a huge golden cupola; for the descendants of Osman and his people, these were Hagia Sofia in Constantinople, the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem and, in subsequent ages, Buda and Vienna...11\n\nIn 1663, twenty years before Sobieski's victory, Ottoman Turks, having defeated the Tzar's army had Vienna within easy reach (from today's Bratislava). The dramatic appeals for help were heard even by the Sun King and one year later, Louis XIV's corps supported the Emperor's army in the famous Battle of Szentgotthárd on the Rába River, where Raimondo Montecuccoli effectively defeated the Turks. However, in 1669, the Turks conquered Candia and returned to their former positions. The chance to consume the \"Red Apple\" was once again realistic. God knows whether that would satisfy the High Porte's appetite. Would Krakow be the next apple?\n\nWe can only guess or, if you prefer, discuss \"historical alternatives.\" On the other hand, the history confirmed by sources tells us that by the end of Jan III's reign, the political formula of the Commonwealth was exhausted and no victory could pull it out of apathy. Besides, after the terrible 17th century, the country damaged by wars needed to take a breath and it could not afford great events or great transformations. And all the Vienna victor could do was to cultivate his beloved apple – Wilanów.\n\nAn Antique hero by the River Vistula – codes and symbols\n\nA piece of art manifests itself to a viewer as a harmony of forms of meanings. It has been long said that paintings, sculptures and architectural creations may speak through symbols or allegories, or even a code of various signs, or sometimes through the written language, such as inscriptions that often contain a \"key\" to understanding the whole system. As it is, various great and culturally important architectural creations are accompanied by entire sequences of meanings, usually arranged in such a way as to present the founder's splendour.\n\nThe European culture that we are authorised to call our own has for ages had two main catalogues of meanings, their two huge reservoirs that have provided input for a multitude of works of art. The first is the tradition of the still pagan Antiquity, which in the period rightly called the Renaissance once again ornamented the imagination of Europeans with themes from the Mythology and Ancient history. The other is the tradition of the Old and New Testaments (that could be collectively called Judeo-Christian), whose themes were the main point of support for religious thinking and manifestations. These are the two main pillars of the spiritual structure that we call Europe.\n\nIt is pointless, and it could even destabilise the entire construction, to put one before the other. Rather, it should be admitted that despite the two dimensions of the European heritage were in open conflict, they continually inspired and illuminated each other. In Middle Ages, the ancient figures were almost completely removed from Europe, and they had to wait until the beautiful times of the Renaissance to return here in large numbers and for good. However, it should be noted that even in the \"darkest\" centuries of the Middle Ages sparkles of the Antique genius continued to glow here and there – especially in France and Italy. Alexander, Caesar or August never died completely, and they found a convenient refuge in the names, titles or nicknames of monarchs. Plato's philosophy illuminated the early Christian theology, whereas the great Aristotle (with much help from Arabs) settled down for good in its most characteristic form – the scholasticism. The classic authors of Latin literature were never forgotten, either.\n\nA new synthesis (as it should probably be called) took place in the Renaissance, when Christian temples once again incorporated the Antique systems, and Greek gods changed from devils and demons into servants at monarch and aristocratic (or even merchant) courts, those of the clergy including. After the first boom of the Renaissance in Florence, Vatican took the lead as the greatest patron of the new art. After all, Raphael's stanzas and Michelangelo's paintings in the Sistine Chapel were created in the papal residency and were financed by popes.\n\nIn those times, almost entire Italy was seized by a fascination for everything Ancient that had been developing for a hundred years. Apart from historical monuments, various Ancient texts were also the object of interest. In Dante's Divine Comedy, Virgil is the guide through Hell and Purgatory. That was only early 13th century, but between 1460 and 1600, various works by Virgil were published in Europe as many as 546 times! Most of them were of course published in Italy, whose elites were very familiar with Antique poets: Virgil, Horace, Homer, Hesiod and Ovid, whose Metamorphoses were an inexhaustible source of themes for countless written and painted stories. Statius and Lucan were popular, too. Cicero and Latin historians were commonly read, probably the most popular of them being Titus Livius (59 BC – 17 CE), author of The History of Rome.\n\nSubsequent waves of mythological iconography passed through graphic arts. A good \"trademark\" of these exceptional times for art could be for example the theme of the three Graces dancing for numerous Renaissance painters of different ages and styles: e.g. Botticelli, Raphael, Correggio. Dukes commissioned entire complexes of mythological paintings to decorate their residences. In Ferrara, the ruling House of d'Este had two such complexes: one in Palazzo Schifanoia, decorated by local masters and the other in Palazzo del Te, built and painted with Ovid's Metamorphoses by Giulio Romano (1499–1546), Raphael's talented disciple. The astrological meaning of the first frescos is so complicated that it was only deciphered in early 20th century by Aby Warburg (1866–1929), the great German scholar whose works gave rise to a new research method in the history of art called the iconology. In fact,. some of the Renaissance topics are quite ridiculous in their \"Antique\" erudition, for example the painting Scipio introducing the cult of the Cybele by Felice Feliciano of Verona12. Here, the passion for Antiquity is in radical conflict with Christian Iconography. Sometimes, Latinisation led to laicisation.\n\nAnother symptom was the fashion of the elites for giving Ancient names to children. In the abovementioned family d'Este, the name Hercules (Ercole) became a dynastic name, and Pope Alexander Borgia called his son Cesare and his daughter Lucrezia. The latter name comes from Livius – Lucrezia was a Roman lady who preferred death to the advances of King Tarquinius Superb.\n\nEven more interesting is the fact that the famous painter Sodoma – in line with the history of his profession – called his son by the name of the Greek painter Apelles, and the architect Seregni – by the name of the Roman architect Virtuvius. Some names were quite amazing, for example the ruler of Milan called his daughter Polyxena, regardless of the macabre destiny of the mythical Polyxena, daughter of Priam and Hecuba, who ended her life on the sacrificial table. Moreover, the tragic name was \"exported\" to Slavic states: for example, it was given to the daughter of Jan Ostroróg, Polish Voivode and law theorist, as well as the daughter of the Czech magnate Vratislav of Lobkovice. The fathers of those Polyxenas, the same as Pope Borgia, could not believe in the fatal meaning of names. The names of living people vividly demonstrate the impact of Antiquity of Renaissance life.\n\nLife, at least among the elites, who were the recipients of works of art, took a new pace: according the creator of the modern history of culture, Jacob Burckhardt (1818–1897) their life itself became a humanistic work of art13. Sometimes they were immortalized in a way that is more proper of God (or gods) than as human being. At least one Renaissance duke – Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta – believed to be a god or at least demigod. In 1446, the tyrant of Rimini started rebuilding the local church of Saint Francis into a temple of his own glory, which was also supposed to be a posthumous monument of his art patronage. The places next to him were occupied by scholars and poets who had served him with his talents during their lifetime. Moreover, Malatesta transformed the church into a shrine of his self-love, extremely mundane and sinful. \"He built a great temple to the glory of Saint Francis, as Pope Pius wrote (or, if you prefer, the humanist Enea Silvio Piccolomini) but filled it with so many pagan works that it seemed the shrine of not so much Christians but rather infidel pagans who worshipped daemons.\" There, he also built a tomb for his mistress, where he engraved the following pagan inscription: \"DEVOTED TO A DIVINE BEING.\"\n\nThe \"divine being\" was his bloody and ruthless lover and later wife, Isotta degli Atti. The initials of the lovers are ostentatiously intertwined inside the church and an angel on the tomb has her facial features. Apart from all the evident differences, the Wilanów palace is also a structure of people in love.\n\nMajor changes took place in the European culture in the Baroque era, but the huge luggage of antique heritage did not get any lighter. Renaissance forms smoothly transformed into so many basic forms of Baroque art that it is hard to define some works of art with a single stylistic feature, especially if they were created over a longer period of time. There were painters, some of them great, such as for example Jacopo Tintoretto (1518–1594), whose art may be classified into three different stylistic categories: Renaissance, Mannerism, Baroque. By the way, for some scholars, Mannerism is a late phase of Renaissance, for others – a separate style and yet for others – a trailer of Baroque. On the provincial soil of Polish culture, a culture of various speeds (in Masovia, Gothic structures were still created!), stylistic purity was blended more easily that elsewhere.\n\nHowever, it is possible to identify the milestones of the development of Baroque art and breakthrough moments whose dynamics definitely limited the retreat from newly acquired forms. As far as the sacred architecture was concerned, the most important was the Il Gesu Jesuit church in Rome, whose structure was designed by Giacomo Vignola and façade – by Giacomo Della Porta. Even though all the individual elements of the new church existed in the Renaissance architecture, they were arranged according to a new system that unified the building's space. The great illusive Baroque theatre begins, full of playing with screens and veils, \"false\" distances and other complicated optical tricks. Only a few steps away from Il Gesu stands its \"offspring\", the San Luigi dei Francesi church, whose façade almost entirely obstructs the dome. Its vaults are covered with figures painted with such illusionistic artistry that sometimes it seems they could fall down on your head. Pietro da Cortona in Palazzo Barberini, Il Baccicia in Il Gesu, Andrea Pozzo in San Ignazio – they were probably the grandest masters of the wild flight of Baroque paintings.\n\nHowever, there was also a deeper and more austere side to it. In the same church, San Luigi Michelangelo (a great name for a revolutionary painter) Merisi (1571–1610), better known as Caravaggio, painted, from 1597 to 1602, in Cardinal Matteo Contarellis chapel three pictures from the life of Saint Matthew the Evangelist. In his paintings, important roles in the history of Christianity are played by simple and common people, and even sometimes by characters from disreputable backstreet. In defiance of the refined heroes of the paintings of Renaissance masters, these people have tough facial features and hands, and often dirty feet. Sometimes, they were cruel people, because Caravaggio's brush turned the martyrdom of saints into barbarian executions.\n\nCarravaggio, gifted with rare intuition, seized the grand historic moment for the Christian world, which was the Council of Trent between 1545 and 1563. Under the pressure of the quickly spreading Protestantism, an iconography of new, extremely dramatic emotions was decreed there: first of all martyrological: the martyrdom of saints was supposed to strike the hearts of the faithful with a straightforward and moving message. On the 15th century paintings of Fra Angelico (appr. 1387–1455), \"the most pious painter of the century,\" even crucifixion is shown with elegance and flowing blood forms ornamental spots. Now, it was to gush out for real.\n\nThe new post-Trent martyrological iconography also affected, at least to some extent, the old gods. Jusepe de Ribera (1591–1652) in his famous painting Apollo and Marsyas (1638) presented the scene of Marsyas' execution with unprecedented cruelty. The sun god flays his rival mad with pain with the cool precision of a sadist torturer. But Ribera was an artist who revelled in the macabre of martyrdom. In this competition, he was almost matched by the great Peter Paul Rubens (1577–1640), glorifier of the sensual joy of life. Between 1610 and 1611 he painted the amazing Juno and Argus, where streams of blood mix with fountains of milk springing from a female breast. When choosing an extremely sophisticated theme from Ovid's Metamorphoses, the most Baroque of painters behaved like a Renaissance artist that is in a downright mannerist way, fondly proving his mythological erudition.\n\nA considerable role in preserving this knowledge was played by various compendia or allegorical templates, the like of Cesare Ripa's Iconography published in late 16th century. They offered an unequivocal and universal system for coordinating various types of content with specific figures of evidently Ancient origin. When an educated person saw such a figure, he or she would immediately know: this is Justice, this is Modesty and this is Virtue.\n\nThe system was lay, but if necessary, it could become a perfect medium for religious messages. In this sense, the allegory is a very handy bridge between the Ancient and Christian worlds. Ancient gods, goddesses, muses and heroes could walk the bridge quite unconstrained, providing support to Christ's religion. This is what the Baroque was like: on the one hand austere, sometimes striking realism and on the other – an Olympic world of book figures. The tension between the two poles is certainly what defines it; such contrast never existed before. The Renaissance realism, although at times emphatic and charming, never gets so expressive as in Caravaggio and a great many artists whose work would be unthinkable without his \"lessons.\" One of them was also the great Rembrandt (1606–1669).\n\nProbably the most extinguished master of the bright side of Baroque paintings was Nicolas Poussin (1594–1665), a Frenchman who spent most of his adult life in Rome. His vision, full of stories of ancient authors, remains in a state of almost perfect calmness – the dream of an ideal Arcadian world undisturbed by any dramatic gestures, embodied in painted forms. Poussin, the great classic, had a perfect understanding of the contemplative aspects of the Antiquity. Sometimes it seems that if Virgil was a painter he would paint exactly this kind of pictures: calm and monumental. However, this very literary master believed that painting is subject to the same laws as architecture and that it is governed by the same orders and divisions. In the history of Baroque art, his works somehow balance Caravaggio's darkness. Poussin called the latter a pest and claimed that his goal was to destroy the art of painting.\n\nPoussin was also a court painter, and he even worked for Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu, and he painted The Labours of Hercules in the Louvre Grand Gallery. However, he managed to stay there for two years only: royal courts and complicated intrigues were not the best place for lofty spirits. On the other hand, this is where the mythological Baroque developed the most. Virtually every European rules wanted to be Hercules or Apollo, like Jan III in Wilanów.\n\nSobieski was not the first in Polish to dress up in Antique and heroic costumes and attributes. According to Jerzy Banach, the leader here was Zygmunt III, who, during a tournament organised in 1592 in association with the King's marriage with Anne of Austria,\n\nat the beginning appeared in the company of Atlas and Hercules. The latter reappeared later during the ceremony, in a different situation. This was the first public appearance of a Polish monarch in the company of an ancient hero...14\n\nBecause of the two heroes, the King was considered fit to undertake similar work and efforts like them, holding up the celestial spheres including. Juliusz Chrościcki wrote in his book Sztuka i polityka (Art and Politics):\n\nThe iconography of the Polish Waza family contains antique motifs, for example Zygmunt III was presented as Hercules. Antique heroes – Aemilianus Scipio or Alexander the Great were Władysław IV. This King was the \"Polish Mars,\" Apollo (like Louis XIII and Louis XIV) and Ganymede, like French kings. Jan Kazimierz was referred to and presented as Hercules, Apollo, Jupiter or Zeus15\n\ndefeating giants (like Henri IV or Rudolph II). Mary Louise was associated with the myth of Ariadne and Astraea and presented as Diana, Juno and Minerva, like French queens.\n\nThe same author says that Jerzy Ossoliński liked to call himself Odysseus, and Prince Jarema – Atlas and, of course, Hercules, and after Zbarazh – Mars.\n\nThis trend existed in the whole Europe, but in Poland it was evidently of French provenance, or, more strictly speaking, of Versailles provenance, as Louis XIV probably outdid all his numerous rivals in mythological personifications. On the one hand, the Versailles palace is a great place but, to put it mildly – peculiar and paradoxical. Its gigantic form blended with almost endless gardens to some extent developed (20 kilometres away from Paris) from a modest hunters' pavilion, where the immortal Duke de Saint-Simon concluded that it had no views, no trees and no water. Construction lasted for decades and it engaged 22 thousand workers. Across the entire width of the main body of the building extends the amazingly glittering Hall of Mirrors with the monumentally spacious Peace and War Rooms on its sides... And yet, the place was crowded.\n\nThe reason was quite simple: the Monarch lodged on his court almost all the French nobility, who hurried to the hand of their lord. Outside the Versailles spring of grace, one was nobody; grand magnates almost literally sat on one another's heads in a peculiar pyramid of larger and smaller rooms, walk-in closets, tiny rooms or even gloomy cubicles. José Cabanis, the great French writer, wrote in his wise essay about the abovementioned Saint-Simon that:\n\nit was a structure where each individual room strengthened and controlled all the others and where nothing could be disregarded: the relationship that united them was so tense and fragile that removing a single stone would endanger the whole construction16.\n\nAfter all, the hierarchy and etiquette shaped and rationalised the Versailles world. The famous rituals accompanying the king getting up and going to bed show it very clearly: a crowd of courtiers had each a very precisely defined function. It should be noted that the centre of this world was the royal bedroom and the royal bed, where subsequent members of the Capetian dynasty, united by a mythical bond with its nobility and its people, were conceived and where they died. The bond remained not split: Louis XIV, although a king of light and reason, was supposed to have, the same as his ancestors, the power to cure with his hands For example, on the eve of the Pentecost in 1715, shortly before his death and despite sweltering heat, he touched as many as 1,700 \"patients.\"17 The difference between the lord of Versailles and the lord of Wilanów is not only in the scale and numbers. It is also the question of the nature of power itself.\n\nHowever, both of them dress up in almost identical garments of Antique heroes. Hercules is a recurring allegorical theme in the Versailles palace. For example, the front façade on the eastern side of the building featured a sundial guarded by figures of Hercules and Mars. In the sun-arched niches of the Ambassadors Staircase stood other sculptures featuring the same hero and Le Brun even planned to paint frescos with Hercules as the main character in the Grand Hall. In the centre, he planned to paint the scene of the hero's reception by gods on Olympus and in less prominent fields – his twelve works. There are more examples like that: The Sun King was very much like Hercules18.\n\nThis, however, did not prevent him from assuming other personalities, from example on Jean Nocret's painting of 1670 presenting Louis' family as inhabitants of Olympus. Louis dominates the picture as Jupiter surrounded by figures with similar faces. It is not a masterpiece: the Bourbon family is not very convincing in modest Olympic clothing. These figures do not look any better than as if they were painted by Jerzy Eleuter Siemiginowski (appr. 1660–1711), the court painter of Jan III, for whom Versailles was something like Olympus. In his letters to his wife, he called it a palais enchanté, enchanted palace. There is some white magic in Nocret's painting, too: the world of royal Olympic gods-dolls somehow tames the dangerous aspects of Baroque. The moon in Diana's – the Grande Mademoiselle – hair shines in full daylight. It is the beneficial impact of Antique gods.\n\nThis impact is equally strong in our Wilanów. As soon as you stand in front of the palace's façade, our imagination is trapped in the world of meanings of the Greek and Roman heritage. Your attention is immediately attracted by two triumphal arches surrounding the side entrances. It is a pity that the central portico modelled on a Greek temple is now missing, but you can still recognise old signs and forms of Antique culture. And you can admire its incredible liveliness. Although the Renaissance is long gone, the language continues to develop and modify, expanding to new fields of European culture. Paradoxically, the times of Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Borromini and the Asam brothers see another triumph of the Antiquity. Mythological figures involved in interweaving intrigues populate the librettos of Baroque operas. Façades, porticoes, friezes and colonnades of Baroque architecture humbly follow the triumphant chariot of Antique tradition. Forms are followed by a long line of meanings: the myths of Olympic gods and heroes, the works of Homer, Virgil or Ovid, the lives of famous men. A great anthology of the Antiquity in stucco, sandstone and marble.\n\nBaroque was another but not the last triumph of the Antiquity. Its many voices reach us from much later times: from the Classicist Polish court to a New York bank, as if the magic of Ancient forms guaranteed power and stability.\n\nThe iconography of Wilanów façades is extremely complicated, even too abundant given the relatively modest size of King Jan's residence. A natural disproportion exists between the form and the content: Wilanów seems to be covered with meanings – obviously Antique ones. What you have to do is find the leading motif of the programme, the Ariadne's thread that will take you deep into Wilanów. Seems banal but it is true... a golden thread, because golden rays indeed illuminate the central part of Sobieski's villa whose iconography sometimes really \"follows the sun,\" as Barbara Milewska-Waźbińska prettily described it in her book Słońce na tarczy19.\n\nThe sun is the ancient sign of grand states and grand monarchs. The sun of Pharaoh Akhenaten, but also the sun of Roman emperors, closer to us and to Wilanów, the sun of the great Aurelian and the sun of Constantine the Great. Naturally, the sun that rises above Wilanów is first of all the sun of Louis XIV, the sun from the centre of meanings in Versailles. Not everybody squinted their eyes before its shine: proud Dutch artists fondly created pamphlets, engravings and medals with dimmed or humiliated sun of King Louis. They would form quite an amusing artistic and literary anthology.\n\nBut Jan III, King of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania and Russian noblemen of the coat of arms Janina was not one of them. Enchanted by the sun of France, he had its rays reflected in his own escutcheon. Fascination with Versailles splendour and Sarmatian pride at the same time. In the centre of the palace's façade at the side of the yard, the conflict was solved with a large dose of ingenuity and fantasy.\n\nJust above the main entrance to the palace you can see a golden sun that casts its rays to the sides. The rays are reflected in slightly convex and curved escutcheon of the Sobieski family's coat of arms, supported by two pairs of putti. Truth to tell, the shield of the Janina coat of arms has a peculiarly suitable form in this respect: empty in the middle, it reflects golden rays like a mirror. It has no image that would resists sunshine. It is simply empty, which is why it was called a \"shield within a shield,\" a \"field within a field,\" or a \"summit within a summit.\"\n\nOf course, the Sobieski's escutcheon symbolises Jan III's protection over the Commonwealth, which – given the achievements of the great leader – seems a relevant \"idea for a metaphor.\" Jan Pisarski wrote in a dedication to his collection under the long title Mówca polski albo Wielkich senatorów powagą i ojczystą wymową oratorów sejmowe i potrzebowe mowy (Collection of Polish speeches), in 1668, the year when Sobieski received the grand baton:\n\nFarewell worries,\n\nYou will not suffer\n\nAny harm my homeland\n\nas long as you are shielded\n\nby Sobieski.\n\nThe authors of the iconographic programme made sure to root this motif in the authority of the Bible and added the following inscription above the Janina escutcheon: REFULSIT SOL IN CLIPEIS. This is a quotation from the Book of the Maccabees, which is an account of a liberating rebellion against the Seleucid empire. The full context is as follows:\n\nWhen the sun shone upon the shields of gold and brass, the hills were ablaze with them and gleamed like flaming torches20.\n\nThus, the sunshine falls on the Sobieski's shield straight from the Bible and grows into a truly mystic light effectively guarding Jan III's dominion. However, one cannot help but read a family and dynastic allusion in it, reflecting the King's pampered dream. All the elements of the content are extremely artfully intertwined or – to use the luminous terminology – bound into a single strong bundle of messages. It is hard to identify the author of the idea. The architect Agostino Locci, the learned librarian Adam Adamandy Kochański or the king himself? One thing is for sure that they all had their say in the iconographic design of the villa.\n\nWhoever that was, he made a small mistake in the field of... Roman arms science. Regardless of the allegorical meaning of the term clipeus, it also has its purely historical significance. Clipeus was an oval shield and what we see on the façade in Wilanów are rather fantastically transformed 16th or 18th century shields known from Renaissance visual art tradition. But there was also a scutum, a Roman buckler slightly curved to the sides. However, the power of the Biblical quotation prevailed.\n\nScutum also functions in Sobieski's apotheoses. Inasmuch as he protects his state with a clipeusem in religious skies, he extends his hand towards the scutum in astronomical skies. Johannes Hevelius dedicated to him one of the seven constellations he discovered – the Scutum Sobiescianum. This is not the only sign of Polish kings on the sky. In 1777, the astronomer Poczobutt-Odlanicki placed there, in honour of King Stanisław August, the Poniatowski family's Ciołek – the coat of arms of the last Polish King.\n\nSobieski's shield also has a certain historical dimension to it. In 1679, in the Chapel of the Holy Cross in Wawel was found a shield with a depiction of Constantine's battle with Maxentius. Constantine's army won under the monogram of Christ, who appeared to him in his dream the night before the battle. In hoc signo vinces (In this sign you will conquer) – said the prophecy. Sobieski was given the shield – as a good omen when he was setting off to Vienna.\n\nIn the centre of the façade – with a tympanum of a temple portico – used to stand the no longer existing monument of Minerva, who as if guarded the entire space of the façade. The Roman goddess identified with the Greek Athena was fond of various intellectual exercises, but she was also a keen warrior. He loyally supported various heroes, including the first among them – Heracles. Her huge shield, the aegis, functions in Polish language as a symbol of effective protection. We say, for example, that this or that happened \"under the aegis.\" It would be hard to find a more suitable mythological patroness for King Jan – a warrior and intellectual whose aegis shielded the entire kingdom.\n\nTwo side entrances are in the shape of triumphal arches, which (although it was a common architectural feature of those times) has a clear significance in the palace of the Vienna victor. Particularly meaningful are bass-relieves on the supraporta of the southern arch, often referred to in literature as male, as the King's bedroom was located in this part of the villa. It is a presentation of Jan III's triumph in three scenes: Picking laurel leaves for a wreath, Jan III's triumphant march and the March of Turkish captives. A medallion below the second scene, on the entrance's axis, displays the bust of a huge man with his head dressed in lion's skin. Wojciech Fijałkowski believes that\n\nthis medallion, featuring Alexander the Great represented as Hercules, who is the personification of virtus heroica, metaphorically presents Jan III, both as the second Alexander, the famous monarch, ideal commander and fearless warrior and the Polish Hercules, who was taken to heaven by his fiery heroic virtue. It should be noted that the verse from Virgils' Aeneid included in the triumphant composition was used by the Roman poet with reference to demigods whose virtus heroica made them immortal. One of those demigods was Hercules21.\n\nAnother indirect reference to Hercules are the figures in niches, in Cesare Ripa's glossary called Fortitudo andValor. Undoubtedly, Sobieski is Hercules, the favourite of Athena-Minerva. This is in complete harmony with the European Antique tradition and at the same time the Sarmatian tradition, to remind for example what Jan Jurkowski wrote in 1604 about the Polish Hercules of the Borderland.\n\nThe northern arch, with the Queen's apartments hidden behind it, the female arch, Marysieńka's arch. Presentations, relevant to those from Jan's arch, try to present symbolically the \"idea\" of femininity, her beauty, good humour and fertility. The first of these presentations shows Horae (at first goddesses of the Seasons, later – of the Hours of the Day) and Charites, goddesses of beauty that bring joy to the world. They also took care of the art, crafts and all kinds of intellectual activity. No wonder they can often be seen alongside Athena. The second presentation displays the dawn, the seductive Eos-Aurora, who managed to wrap around her rose fingers even the terrible giant Orion, whose constellation is easy to find on the sky map, the same as constellation of Arion who is riding a dolphin on another bass-relief. In the meaningful background of Wilanów's façade stars continue to shine – and not only the biggest one among them.\n\nThe myth of Arion, the musician from Lesbos, who was saved from sea depths by dolphins is not easy to associate with the other content of Marysieńka's arch, as it is hard to find any attributes of femininity in it. However, one must remember that iconography is not the same as mathematics. Barbara Milewska-Waźbińska claims that Arion, who changed into an allegorical figure in the Early Modern period, \"symbolised virtue that is often easier to find among strangers than in one's own homeland. Thus, the songster could be a hint at Marysieńska, who was born in France.\"22 In a medallion corresponding to Hercules' medallion in the male arch was sculpted a graceful female head in a rose chain. According to Ripa's allegorical glossary, this ought to beVenustas, the personification of grace. This is probably the case, even though the style in which meanings were formed on Wilanów's façades would suggest its association with a figure bearing a specific name. Milewska-Waźbińska sees in her Dido the Queen of Cartyhage, who accepts in her house Aeneas lost on the African coast. The problem is, however, that Dido, who committed suicide after the hero had left her, is bitterly tragic and in contrast to the radiant harmony of Jan and Marysieńka's house.\n\nThe façade on the side of the garden is less crowded with meanings and the most eye-catching element is the monument of Apollo, a counterpart of the lost monument of Minerva. This was another symbolic proof of the King's role as a great patron of art and science. Jan III, previously presented as Hercules, again \"follows the sun,\" as he transforms into a sun god... With a large dose of literary probability, one could say that this transformation makes him similar to mythical heroes who changed or were changed with miraculous easiness. After all, myths are of a transformational nature, like in Ovid's Metamorphoses. By the way, Ovid was one of the \"authors\" of Wilanów's depictions.\n\nNo wonder we are promptly brought back to Hercules. Above the door, in a place corresponding to the place in the façade on the side of the yard displaying the royal sun, hangs the skin of a huge lion that – by virtue of the myth – belonged to Hercules. On its sides are two national symbols: the Polish eagle and the Lithuanian Pahonia. The eagle is holding in its claws the Janina escutcheon – the same as the knight from Pahonia is carrying on his arm. To the right are scenes from the Odyssey – the rich programme could not do without a strong dose of Homer. Naturally, there is also a pinch of symbolic astronomy: the old Saturn pondering above a sundial.\n\nAnd not only that: the attic's relief feature a review of Sobieski's military dominance, plus a scene from the royal election and entry for the crowning ceremony. The attic is crowned with beautiful statues of the Muses with relevant attributes, visible from a long distance,. After all, Jan and Marysieńska's villa was supposed to be their shrine, the Polish Helicon.\n\nApart from everything else, this was their authentic house, which is much more evident in its interiors. It is enough to say that within the palace's walls reigns Apollo, whose favourite book was Virgil's Georgics. Thus, the Baroque spring is at full swing, swallows are making their nests, bees are buzzing and shepherds are playing their pipes. Unfortunately, the future of Wilanów turned out to be not quite idyllic.\n\nThe royal sons, Aleksander and Konstanty (the oldest son, Jakub, was born when Sobieski was still the Hetman) proved to be poor landlords, much worse that the Saxons on the Polish throne. The palace owed the second period of its prosperity only to Elżbieta Sieniawska. She added new wings to the villa with countless relieves modelled on Ovid's Metamorphoses. Everybody is there: Pygmalion, Arachne, Orpheus, Ganymede and others.\n\nThis is how the almost final metamorphosis of the unsightly village of Milanów into the palace of Wilanów took place. However, it was not its last transformation, which was to of happen by the end of the 18th century with the arrival of Stanisław Kostka Potocki.\n\n[1] N.
