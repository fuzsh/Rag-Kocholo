Hosted by the Central European University in Budapest, the conference offered an invaluable opportunity for us to rethink European historical ties with Asian civilisations, such as the migration of the Magyars and other nomadic people from the Eurasian steppes to Central Europe, as well as the invasions of the Mongols and the Ottoman Turks. This unique opportunity encouraged us to call for our colleagues to conduct a collaborative project, and our enthusiasm turned into a collection of essays dealing with the history of Asian art collections and studies from the perspective of Persia—a common research interest of the editors and the contributors to the current volume. The editors wish to thank all those who have contributed their time and knowledge to the completion of this volume. A variety of the papers in this volume portrays the increased diversification of this discipline. Our sincere thanks go to Joachim Gierlichs and Friederike Voigt for their help and encouragement since their participation in the ESCAS session. In addition to Tatjána Kardos who made a collaborative endeavour with Iván Szántó to reveal a hitherto unknown aspect of Persian art collections in Budapest, we are most grateful to Alice Bombardier, Sabina DvoĜáková, Mircea Dunca, Magdalena Ginter-Froáow, Barbara Karl and Eva-Maria Troelenberg who took part in the volume project with their insightful essays. A contribution from Tajikistan by Larisa Dodkhudoeva, Rustam Mukimov and Katherine Hughes gives an additional “Persian” flavour, an element which is most desirable for the depth of discussion in the volume. Finally, the editors are very fortunate to have such wonderful contributors who are most supportive and cooperative. It is hoped that this publication would be a stimulus to break a traditional view towards the cultural border. The Editors\n\nNOTES ON TRANSLITERATION AND TERMINOLOGY\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, the use of diacritical marks for Arabic, Persian and Turkish words or names are kept to a minimum. Vowels are transcribed according to the standard Romanisation of Arabic, with the exception of the Persian silent “h,” which is written out as a terminal “e.” Turkish words follow the modern Turkish alphabet, except in classical contexts where they are transcribed as mentioned above. For modern Tajik, the standard transliteration of Tajik was chosen but sometimes the Persian form was also provided. To avoid confusion, the names of certain modern Iranian persons occur both in standard transcription and in the commonly used English form. Throughout the volume, the term “Persia” is extensively used, since the current volume is much concerned with the time before 1935, when the country name “Iran” was internationally recognised. The term “Oriental” is used in some articles, if it is linked to a 19th- and 20th-century geographical notion towards the non-western world, covering not only the Islamic Middle East and North Africa but also Asia and Africa in general. Unless necessary, Hijri (Islamic lunar) dates are not given. Some biographical dates of individuals are not given, due to lack of information at the time of editing the volume.\n\nABBREVIATIONS\n\nBWG\n\nEIr SPA\n\nL. Binyon, J. V. S. Wilkinson and B.

The core lands of these empires changed from time to time, but as the Persian administration expanded, this generated a broad Persianisation that affected vast swathes of Central Asia as well as the art history of even farther regions.1 A lasting visual bond between Persia and the region of Transoxiana became selfevident after the integration of this region into the greater Islamic world under the ‘Abbasids, Samanids, Ilkhanids, Timurids and their successors. In the words of Robert Byron (1905–1941): “Timur, in founding an empire […], had delivered Oxiana from the nomads and brought the Turks of Central Asia within the orbit of Persian civilisation.”2 Such sweeping statements are, however, bound to be challenged. While the impact of the Persian style is undeniably reflected in most aspects of the art and architecture of Islamic Central Asia, this PersoCentral Asian connection was chiefly formed and articulated by the EuroAmerican movement of collecting and interpreting the art and material culture of the Persian Islamic world during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This exerted an enormous impact on the formation of scholarship and connoisseurship in Persian art, for instance with an attempt to define the characteristics of how the Islamic art of modern-day 1\n\nFor the mechanisms of this process in pre-Islamic times, see Ball, 2010; Boardman 2000. 2 Byron 1937/1982, 88.\n\nYuka Kadoi and Iván Szántó\n\n3\n\nIran and Central Asia should be viewed and displayed at museums and how these subjects should be researched in academia. This important historical fact, which has attracted scholarly interest only in recent years, should be treated as a serious subject of research, accepting that the abstract image of Persian art was not a pure creation of Persian civilisation but can be the manifestation of particular historical times and charismatic individuals. Attention should therefore be given to various factors that resulted in the shaping of “Persian” imagery across the globe, not only in terms of national ideologies, but also within the context of several protagonists, such as scholars, collectors and dealers, as well as of objects themselves. Besides the on-going debate as to whether or not the cultural term “Persia” should be replaced by the more politically-oriented term “Iran,” the fundamental question arises: can “Persian” art be defined after all? Is it related to a particular style or a peculiar visual language, or, rather, does it refer to the unity of artistic traditions within a given geographic, ethnic or linguistic area at a limited time? Why shall we still opt for the enduring term “Persia”—rather than Iran, the names of several independent “istans,” generically the Middle East, Islam or West Asia—when it comes to the art, architecture and material culture of modern-day Iran and Central Asia after the Arab conquest in the 7th century? And can we still distinguish between “Persian” and “Islamic” after the conquest? If “Persian art” should and must only be interpreted as an abstract idea rather than a well-defined unity, was the term solid enough through its constant use in past scholarship? And, above all, can we still employ it safely?3 There is no shortage of self-assured statements and attempts to classify artistic and architectural forms to different social or ethnic groups, such as the Persians, the Turks or the Arabs, as well as to propose certain hierarchical orders between them.4 Yet “Persian art”—like most collective terms in the history of art—has always been fluid, greatly depending on who, where, when and on what purpose brought it into play. Judging by the number of books and articles about “Persian art,” it is intriguing to see that, while consensus did never exist about the items that could be packed together in this baggage, the existence of the baggage has been accepted by nearly every scholar. For some, a Coptic textile may have been Sasanian, hence Persian; others grouped Mughal paintings into several “Indo-Persian” schools with the emphasis on the Persian pedigree. For yet others, the palace of Mshatta in modern-day Jordan was Persian, but some 3\n\nFor the history of the term “Iran,” see Gnoli 1989. The methodological consequences of ill-defined terminological premises are demonstrated by Grabar 2010.\n\n4\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\ncould regard the Mausoleum of Isma‫ދ‬il Samani in modern-day Uzbekistan only as Tajik. The present volume does not make judgments and does not come forward with a new solution: neither does it have any say in the arthistorical development of Persian art before or after the Muslim conquest. Instead, it reconsiders the ideas of those who contributed to the shaping of “Persian art” of the Islamic period.\n\nNotes on Historiography—Persian, Iranian or Islamic? To begin with, let us historiographically assess the work of Marcel Dieulafoy (1844–1920), the author of one of the earliest general surveys of ancient Persian art, entitled L’Art antique de la Perse (1884–9).5 In a lesser-known later book by Dieulafoy, Art in Spain and Portugal (1913), he suggested that most of the arts of mediaeval Iberia were derived from Islamic, and ultimately Sasanian, Persia. The first paragraph is worth quoting in its entirety: “It may seem strange that the art history of Spain and Portugal should begin on Iranian ground, at the time of the Sassanids, and that the study of the primitive mosques should serve as a preface to that of the western churches. I hope, however, to show in the course of the first three chapters that Persia was not only the source of inspiration of Musulman architecture, and of the so-called Mudejar architecture of Spain, but that she played an important and well-defined part in the elaboration of those religious themes which found their way into the Asturias, Castille, and Catalonia after the expulsion of the invaders, and were acclimatised in France at a later period by the Benedictines.”6\n\nA chain of Italian scholars from Michele Amari (1806–1889) through Ugo Monneret de Villard (1881–1954) and Geza de Francovich (1902– 1996) to Giovanni D’Erme (1935–2011) projected a similar genealogical link among mediaeval Italy, Fatimid Egypt and pre-Islamic Persia. Amari, for instance, suggested a massive Persian immigration in Sicily during its Muslim conquest and offered a series of toponymy that he believed to reflect Khurasanian or Transoxanian connections.7 Monneret not only drew comparisons between early mediaeval Italian and Persian art, but he was also aware of Persian artistic presence in ancient India.8 Francovich 5\n\nDieulafoy 1884-9. Dieulafoy 1913, 1. 7 Amari 1858, vol. 2, 31-35. 8 Monneret 1938; for an assessment of Monneret, see Contadini 2000. 6\n\nYuka Kadoi and Iván Szántó\n\n5\n\nfound an underlying Persian core in the representation of kingship in mediaeval European art,9 while D’Erme “was vividly struck by the ‘Persian aura’ which effused from” the Cappella Palatina in Palermo.10 Such bold assertions may have stemmed from whimsical thoughts of Italian scholars of various times.11 Yet they responded, to a certain degree, to the 19th-century trend in Indo-European linguistics and anthropology that greatly stimulated the growing European discourse on the origins of western art, including the “Orient oder Rom” debate that had provocatively been triggered off by Josef Strzygowski (1862–1941) in Vienna in 1901.12 Despite an unclear definition of its role in the shaping of western art, Persia continued to exude its “aura,” and it was this very aura which was perceived and translated into an abstract idea of “Persian art” in the context of the “Orient oder Rom” debate. The term “Persian art” eventually came to be used, though in its most general sense, in mediaeval contexts as a distant backdrop for a remote past, whereas the more recent, let alone contemporary, artistic contacts between Europe and Persia were rarely touched upon before World War II.13\n\n9\n\nFrancovich 1964. D’Erme 2004, 401; see also D’Erme 1995. 11 A similar, “Perso-Spanish” thesis was suggested by the Scotsman Robert Murdoch Smith (1835–1900), the director of the Persian telegraph company in Tehran who acted as an agent to acquired Persian objects for the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum) in London in 1873-85. In his Persian Art (London, 1876), a guidebook which was published on the occasion of the exhibition of Persian art in 1876, he states that “Persia is in all probability the country from which the Arabs derived the arts afterwards developed by them in Spain and elsewhere […] it is far from improbable that even the Alhambra itself was chiefly the work of Persians, who stood to the Arabs in much the same relation that the Greeks did to the Romans” (Smith 1876, 3-4). 12 His controversial book was entitled Orient oder Rom: Beiträge zur Geschichte der spätantiken und frühchristlichen Kunst (Orient or Rome: Contributions to the History of Late Antique and Early Christian Art). In conjunction with the 150th anniversary of the birth of Strzygowski, there were several events related to his career in the year of 2012, most notably a conference in Vienna on 12 October, organised by the Gesellschaft für vergleichende Kunstforschung (Society for Comparative Studies in Art; for the conference programme, see http://www. vergleichende.at, accessed 21 March 2013). 13 There were exceptions; see, for instance, Friedrich Sarre (1865–1945)’s early article about Islamic elements in the art of Rembrandt (“Rembrandts Zeichnungen nach Indisch-Islamisch Miniaturen”, Jahrbuch der königlich-preußischen Kunstsammlungen, 25 [1904], 143-58). For Sarre’s life and career, see Gierlichs’s article in the present volume. 10\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhile Europe was not particularly receptive to the art and culture of modern Persia during the 19th and early 20th centuries, the latter, on the other hand, earnestly studied, reciprocated and exploited the on-going European discourse about the quasi-legendary brilliance of Persian art, especially during the last years of the Qajar dynasty and under the energetic rulership of Riza Shah Pahlavi (r. 1925–41).14 It laid claim to every bit of the Persian greatness that had been so much extolled by western scholars. Pahlavi Persia (or Iran after 1935) invited leading scholars and sponsored or supported the great international projects of the 1930s relating to the subject: these included archaeological expeditions, congresses, loan exhibitions, and—most lasting of all—the publication of A Survey of Persian Art (1938–9), a multi-volume corpus which was edited by Arthur Upham Pope (1881–1969) and Phyllis Ackerman (1893– 1977).15 Without doubt, the leading western scholars to take up residence in Persia were the self-made entrepreneur Pope from America,16 the polymath Ernst Herzfeld (1879–1948) from Germany17 and the architect and Franco-Persian cultural attaché André Godard (1881–1965) from France.18 They gave support to the official renaming of the country from Persia to Iran, a move which implied that the country was home to all Iranians—Kurds, Lors, Balochi and even Turkic-speaking people—not just the Persians. However, it can be argued that this reversal of the discourse may have ultimately sealed the fate of “Persian art.” Tied to a modern, secular state, “Persian art” was detached from its earlier aura of timelessness, thus losing most of its universal claims. Although modern Iran attempted to further promote the westernfabricated elements of its own mystique, the new nationalist standpoint exerted a counteractive effect. Ultimately “Persian art” failed to challenge the success of the—likewise highly contestable—term “Islamic art.” Today, Persian art forms part of Islamic collections and museums all over the world, but no “Museum of Persian Art” has ever been established.19 Yet 14\n\nSee Grigor 2007.

Chief among these is the National Museum of Iran (formerly Museum of Ancient Iran, Muze-ye Iran-e 15\n\nYuka Kadoi and Iván Szántó\n\n7\n\nDieulafoy’s Spanish hypothesis shows that the complete separation of the Cordovan and Bukharan artistic traditions before 750 AD and the forced amalgamation of these two extremes in the mould of Islam after 750, as postulated by the late 20th-century doyen of Islamic art studies Oleg Grabar (1929–2011), would look rather differently using a Persian mould.20 The shift from “Persian” to “Islamic” happened in parallel with the establishment of the Arab states in former Ottoman territories after World War I and the invention or reassertion of their local, modernist-national traditions. While attempts were made to recategorise the arts according to major ethnic groups in the Middle East based on the 19th-century concept—namely Turkish, Arab and Persian—or according to the religious group by adopting the adjectives such as Muhammadan or Muslim, a new taxonomical category—Islam—was introduced by western art historians in the inter-war period so as to give Islamic art a false sense of one secular, cultural unit.21 The application of the secularised, collective term “Islamic” for generically describing the arts of later Persia undermined the role of Persia, while post-Ottoman pan-Arab nationalism welcomed the emphasis on Islam, whether religiously or culturally, as an original Arab contribution to global civilisation. Such shifts rarely occur without conflicts, as shown, for instance, by the continuing disagreement over the name of the Persian Gulf.22 Similar processes have been taking place in many more areas over the wider region from the Caucasus to Afghanistan. During the height of the “Orient oder Rom” debate but geographically far from the centre of the debate, the Russian Yakov Ivanovich Smirnov (1869–1918) realised that a large number, perhaps the majority, of the splendid metalwork hoards from the Russian steppe and Siberia, which had been previously considered as Persian, was in fact “Iranian.”23 The chapters of the art of long-forgotten Iranian peoples, such as the Sogdians, Bastan), established in Tehran in 1937 by André Godard. As its original name implies, its initial emphasis fell on the pre-Islamic period, yet the Perso-Islamic material also underwent such a rapid growth that the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran was induced to devolve it upon a separate Museum of the Islamic Period in 1994. 20 Grabar 1973, 4-15. 21 The process of secularisation in Islamic art is lengthily discussed in Shaw’s study of Islamic art collections in the Ottoman Imperial Museum (see Shaw 2000, 59). 22 It is in this context interesting to note that the Museum of the Persian Gulf was founded in the largest Iranian port city Bandar ‫ދ‬Abbas in 2008, when the opposite coast witnessed the opening of the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha in Qatar. 23 Smirnov 1909.\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe Khwarizmians and the Bactrians, thus began to emerge as the essential narratives of a wider, more variegated Iranian civilisation. This again paralleled important political changes which were to unfold in Central Asia, a Turkic-dominated land, also called “Turan” or “Turkestan.” Within a few decades, new states appeared on this part of the Persian cultural domain, such as the Uzbek, Tajik, Turkmen and Azerbaijan Soviet republics, completing the fragmentation of Persian art.24 Each fiercely claimed to be heir to the same patrimony, often in an exclusionist manner, and was eager to establish a historical link to great mediaeval dynasties, such as the Samanids for Tajikistan and the Timurids for Uzbekistan. To fashion local culture more authentically national, as well as to erase the history of the communist past after the 1990s, some of the best-preserved monuments in the region that had been researched by leading Soviet scholars in the 1960s-70s were, soon after the independence, extensively restored or in some cases completely remodelled as buildings with more recognisably “Persian”-style decoration.25 At the same time, the Turkic Uzbeks regard themselves as heirs par excellence to the Turanians, the legendary foes of the Iranians, and model their monuments on this standpoint. Official Uzbek historiography stresses the independence of classical Uzbek culture from Persia, even if western observers, like Robert Byron, quoted above, look at local art as Persianate.26 Furthermore, Uzbek nationalism refuses to accept the large Persian-speaking Tajik community as being Tajik, maintaining instead that every citizen of the country represent the Turkic Uzbek nation. Neighbouring Tajikistan, conversely, emphasises its Iranian identity as opposed to the “Turanian” Uzbeks.27 Fellow Iranian Afghans discovered the pre-Islamic Kushan and Islamic\n\n24 Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan can be excluded in the discussion of neoPersianisation in the former Soviet Central Asia. The former is ethnically diverse, consisting not only of the Turkic Kazakhs but also of many ethnic groups as a result of mass deportations from other Soviet states under Joseph Stalin. The latter is more culturally associated with the lands formally called East Turkestan, historically known as the lands of the Uyghurs or the Western Regions (Xiyu) in China. 25 The process of re-Persianising Islamic monuments already occurred in Central Asia during the 19th century (see Rogers 2006). 26 For further discussion on Uzbek national ideology, see March 2002. Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan follow a similar path, although in the absence of a significant Persian-speaking population conflicts are less pronounced there than in Uzbekistan. 27 See the essay on Tajik art in the present volume.\n\nYuka Kadoi and Iván Szántó\n\n9\n\nGhorid (or Ghurid) dynasties as precursors in their national history.28 Turkmenistan may be regarded as an exception: this Turkic nation which has emerged from a nomad pastoralist society, finds its ancient embodiment in the Iranian-speaking Parthians who also appeared in history as nomads.29 Ultimately, many Central Asian monuments lost their original elements, compared with the time when Ernst Cohn-Wiener (1882–1941) made a pioneering study of the still-untouched Islamic monuments of Central Asia.30 In the Caucasus, the newly created Turkic state of Azerbaijan similarly dissociated itself from the modern state of Iran, downplaying the links with Persian culture and regarding itself as a victim of Persian expansionism, while the outwardly Persianate local monuments have been regarded as evidence for an independent Turko-Azeri genius. Significantly, however, the Christian Armenians and Georgians, with their artistic heritage scattered over Iran and Turkey, display a much more relaxed attitude towards the question. As the most important middlemen between various religious and ethnic groups in the region since ancient times, many aspects of their art have become compatible with both Persianate and nationalist interpretations. In this regard, it is instructive to contemplate the fate of Persian art by looking at two of its most powerful modern manifestations. The symbolic mausoleum of the first great New Persian poet, Abu ‘Abdallah Ja‘far Rudaki (858–c. 941) in Panjrud, Tajikistan (1958), and that of the two American scholars of Persian art Arthur Upham Pope and Phyllis Ackerman in Isfahan (completed in 1977), were both modelled on the socalled Samanid Mausoleum in Bukhara in modern-day Uzbekistan, the earliest major Persian monument from the Islamic period (c. 914–43).31 28\n\nBefore the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in 1979, the pre-Islamic Iranian Kushan dynasty (c. 1st–4th centuries AD) played a central role in the formation of modern Afghan cultural identity (see Nayksi 1982). This orientation was eclipsed by subsequent decades of war, and in recent years the Muslim Iranian Ghorid dynasty (12th–13th centuries) appears to take over as Afghanistan’s “national” dynasty, as expressed, for instance, at an international seminar, entitled The Ghorid Empire and its Role in the History, Civilisation and Culture of Afghanistan and the Region, held in Kabul in 2011. While the papers have not yet been published, the organising foundation (Ghuri Jahandaran Cultural Foundation) maintains a website which offers information about this event and other conferences (http://www.jameghor.com, accessed 30 October, 2012). 29 See, for instance, Asyrov (ed.) 2007. 30 Cohn-Wiener 1930. 31 For the millecentennial celebrations of Rudaki in Tajikistan, see Mirzoev 1968; for the Pope-Ackerman mausoleum, see Grigor 2009, 175-200. Pope’s contributions to the development of Persian art studies and collections will be referred to in\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nBut the two buildings represent diametrically opposing aims: whereas the Rudaki Mausoleum becomes fixed firmly in the Tajik national canon, the other building expresses the universalism of Persian art, as envisioned by Pope and Ackerman. In order to prevent further fragmentation of the Iranian world, a few international scholars, like Richard Nelson Frye (b. 1920), have been working hard to uphold the idea of “Greater Iran” not only in the academic sphere but also among the people of the successor states.32 Representing a slightly different approach, the Association for the Study of Persianate Societies (ASPS) was inaugurated in 2002 in Tajikistan to investigate the culture of the Persian-speaking societies and the wider Iranian world.33 In addition, the past years have seen the publication of a number of pioneering studies which explored the role of the Persian language, including translations and inscriptions, in Islamic art history. For example, a recent survey by Bernard O’Kane showed that Persian epigraphy is surprisingly widespread in Islamic art, appearing between Europe and Bengal as the second-most popular language in inscriptions after Arabic.34\n\nThe Birth of “Persian Islamic” Art and Western Art History As widely argued elsewhere in a recent reassessment of art history in the non-western world, Islamic art history was essentially developed as a branch of western art history from the 19th to the 20th century,35 and the major discourse of the double-adjective “Persian Islamic,” or the more hybrid term “Perso-Islamic,” art was thus also conducted chiefly by EuroAmerican scholars. During the formative period of its scholarship, the primary concerns for Persian art among western scholars were given to architecture and “miniature” painting of the great mediaeval dynasties of the Saljuqs, Ilkhanids, Timurids and Safavids. Sculpture, which traditionally ranks highly in western art history, lost its significance after the Muslim Kadoi’s article in the present volume. It should be noted that the Rudaki Mausoleum has been most recently replaced by a larger structure which displays Timurid, rather than Samanid features. 32 Frye 2005. 33 See http://www.persianatesocieties.org (accessed 11 November 2012). 34 O’Kane 2009. 35 Recently Shalem 2012. There has been an on-going debate as to whether the term “Islamic” can be generically used for describing the art, architecture and material culture of the Islamic world. Yet there is so far no alternative to replace this misleading term.\n\nYuka Kadoi and Iván Szántó\n\n11\n\nconquest when many figurative traditions of the Persian world were dismissed or modified. One category that did not match western arthistorical concepts but was soon accepted as distinctively “Persian” as well as rightly “Islamic” along with architecture and “miniature” painting, especially among collectors and museums, was carpets. Surviving examples that can be attributed to the pre-Islamic Persian world were not discovered until the mid-20th century, although mediaeval descriptions of pre-Islamic Persian carpets were already well-known.36 So-called “minor arts” or “arts and crafts,” according to western art-historical traditions, such as metalwork, ceramics and glass, were also viewed as subjects of investigation but more often integrated into the wider category of Islamic art.37 Other genres of the “minor arts,” such as arms and armour, were also collected, but these were rarely viewed distinctively as Persian objects.38 Euro-American scholarship inevitably Euro-Americanised the approaches to these topics. This is particularly the case with the single Persian “miniature” painting leaf, which was viewed and appreciated as the Persian equivalent to old master’s oil painting but not as a book illustration. Persian “miniature” painting was thus sold individually, as well as delicately framed, often with the emphasis on image rather than the entire page with text, and it was predominantly displayed on the wall in Euro-American museums. In order further to establish the connoisseurship of Persian “miniature” painting in the West, the role of painters was overemphasised, while calligraphers and other aspects of the art of the book were downplayed. For most westerners of this time, undecipherable Arabic letters must have been viewed as irrelevant for the appreciation of “miniature” painting, and this tendency may have promoted the detachment of image from text both in scholarship and in art dealing.39 36\n\nStudies about the legendary late-Sasanian “Spring of Khusraw” carpet, for example, were already published in the 19th century (see Karabacek 1881). The oldest surviving Persian pile carpet, dating back to the 5th century BC, was discovered in 1949 in the Pazyryk Valley in the Altai Mountains in Siberia and now in the collection of the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg (no. 1687/93) (see Loukonine and Ivanov 2003, no. 29). 37 This category includes media, such as ivory and rock crystal, but these are more closely associated with the Islamic West than with the Persianate world. 38 Possibly the most notable achievement in this field for the last decade is Moshtagh Khorasani 2006, which covers the history of Persian arms and armour from the bronze age to the 20th century and demonstrates their Persian characteristics. 39 One may think of the fates of many important pre-modern copies of the Shahname, whose pages are dispersed across the globe; this unfavorable situation is a serious obstacle for scholars who first of all have to travel globally as far as the manuscript page goes. Thanks to the IT revolution in the past decade, we are now\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhile calligraphers were rarely featured in the early writing of Persian painting in the West,40 some identifiable figures of Persian painting, like Riza ‘Abbasi (c. 1565/70–1635), became “stars” or “masters,” following the western art-historical canon.41 Deriving from pre-existing Persian notions of Kamal al-Din Bihzad (c. 1460 –1535) as the “Second Mani” (in allusion to a 3rd-century prophet who used art to proselytise), this lateTimurid painter became “the Persian Michelangelo.” These juxtapositions enabled European scholarship to build up Europeanised constructs for the discussion of Persian art in which the lonely genius of a Bihzad or another painter eclipsed the manuscripts which contained the paintings.42 Like the Japanese rediscovery of Ukiyoe prints’ painters, the Persian world virtually able to study dispersed manuscripts by using online databases, such as the Cambridge Shahname project (http://shahnama.caret.cam.ac.uk/new/jnama/page/, accessed 15 July 2012). Western connoisseurship of Persian painting not only gave a wrong picture of the Persian art of the book in the past but also in some cases caused an unrecoverable damage to some of the finest manuscripts, such as the Great Mongol Shahname and the Houghton Shahname. 40 Clément Huart (1854–1926) was one of the early contributors to the study of calligraphy in Persian painting (Huart 1908). For more about the biography of Huart, see Calmard 2004. Having prepared the catalogues of Persian manuscripts in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, his compatriot, Edgard Blochet (1870–1937), become a leading historian of Persian painting. For his life and works, see Richard 1989. 41 The long series of publications about Riza the painter was stimulated by debates as to whether or not he was also a leading calligrapher with a similar name. The initial supposition of Sarre, shared by Eugen Mittwoch (1876–1942)(“Riza Abbasi, ein persischer Miniaturmaler”, Kunst und Künstler, 9, 1911, 45-53) about the dualidentity of Riza as the painter and the calligrapher, was questioned by Karabacek in his major essay, “Riza-i Abbasi, ein persischer Miniaturmaler” (published in Sitzungsberichte, Akademie der Wissenschaften, Philosophisch- Historische Klasse, 167, 1911, Vienna: 1-48). In response, Sarre and Mittwoch wrote a book of their own in which they upheld their previous thesis (Zeichnungen von Riza Abbasi, Munich, 1914), while a number of other, chiefly German, scholars also published their own ideas about Riza. The Riza ‘Abbasi controversy up to the early 1930s was summarised in Isabel Hubbard, “‘AlƯ RizƗ-i ‘AbbƗsƯ, calligrapher and painter”, Ars Islamica, 4, 1934, 282-91. After Karabacek’s opinion had proven right, ‘Ali Riza the calligrapher was rarely discussed any more, but the painter continued to be the subject of art-historical investigation, including Sheila Canby’s The Rebellious Reformer: The Drawings and Paintings of Riza-yi ‘Abbasi of Isfahan (London, 1996). 42 Emphasis on the individual artist was also reflected with the emerging modern art of Iran, as witnessed by Husayn Bihzad (Hossein Behzad, 1894–1968), bearing the name of his illustrious predecessor. For this painter, see Bombardier’s article in this volume.\n\nYuka Kadoi and Iván Szántó\n\n13\n\nrediscovered the Persian artists through European assessments. In turn, Iran and Tajikistan would name their new museums in honour of these rediscovered artists, hence the Riza ‘Abbasi Museum in Tehran (opened in 1977) and the Kamal al-Din Bihzad Museum in Dushanbe (opened in 1945). Ironically the latter museum does not possess any, even single painting by its denominator, but it has modern, European-inspired, oil paintings, intending to evoke the forgotten, if not mythical, past of the Tajik nation.43 Such a painter-oriented taste ultimately set a borderline between art history (image) and philology (text) in Persian manuscript studies. This often resulted in distorted transliterations and misinterpretations of the text in the past.44 Yet thanks to the rise of codicology in the field of Islamic manuscripts in recent days, it is a right time to declare that “miniature” painting no longer exists, and every aspect of the physical condition of Persian book painting has nowadays thoroughly been studied. Apart from the creation of “miniature” painting, the western arthistorical canon was also applied for the taxonomy of Persian painting according to the “school.” The painting school was often associated with a city or town, rather than the workshop managed by the master, due to the lack of information about named painters or masters in pre-modern Persian painting. This generated a certain bias towards periphery pictorial traditions. Many Persian painting schools outside the main genealogical lines, such as the Shaybanids (1500–99) of Central Asia,45 the Aq Qoyunlu (1396–1508) of East Anatolia and West Persia,46 or the dynasties of the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1555),47 were for a long time overlooked; in some cases, these were categorised vaguely as the works of provincial schools under the more established dynastic names so as to justify their existence. By contrast, some unusual features found in what was ought to be evocations of the\n\n43\n\nSee, for example, fig. 4.3 in the present volume. To take an example, the name of Riza the painter has been transliterated in English in several confusing ways, such as Riza-i ‘Abbasi, Riza-yi ‘Abbasi, Rizaye ‘Abbasi, Riza ‘Abbasi and so forth. The persistence of the unreasonable usage of the “-(y) i” or “-(y) e” structure (i.e., the izafe structure) in this name seems to have stemmed from the dispute between Sarre (Riza ‘Abbasi) and Karabacek (Riza-yi ‘Abbasi): the triumph of the latter’s correct biographical proposition ironically destined the survival of his incorrect rendering of the name. See note 41. 45 Porter1998. 46 Rettig 2011. 47 For a recent study of Delhi Sultanate painting and its visual culture, see Perrière 2008. 44\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\n“high school” of Persian painting, such as that of the Timurids and the Safavids, were rejected as non-Persian.48 The same tendency can be said about the carpet—the bestselling cultural product of Persia. Realising its immense commercial value through western assessments, the carpet industry revived in late Qajar and early Pahlavi times, and the image of the “Persian” carpet steadily took shape.49 Persian carpets were essentially viewed as show displays rather than items of actual daily use by Euro-American scholars and collectors of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and the western collecting canon that highly praised the “high school” of carpets from courtly workshops led to a longlasting taxonomy of Persian carpets according to regions rather than techniques. Silky carpets from courtly workshops began to be regarded as fine arts products, whereas roughly-woven rugs of Central Asian tribes were considered as ethnographical materials.50 Besides the aforementioned disciplines, namely art history and ethnography, archaeology also made a significant contribution to the shaping of our view towards Persian Islamic art.51 Due to the theological aversion to burial rites, material remains of Islamic Persia are mainly from urban sites, thus reflecting the life of not only the ruling class but also the working class. Such finds, especially ceramics, attracted little attention when they were initially discovered as sherds or fragments and mostly undecorated or uncoloured. Far from this original context, however, examples of various mediaeval Persian fine wares, such as minai and lajvardina, with the perfect shape and vivid colour, began to appear in the western art market, and gradually lost much of their archaeological 48 For instance, our image of the 16th-century “school” of Shiraz has only recently been rectified by Uluç 2006. See also Kangarani (ed.) 2008 for the reconsideration of the school of Shiraz. 49 See Rudner 2011. 50 See Kadoi’s article in the present volume for further discussion of the formation of “Persian” carpet taste. For an ethnographical view to the art and material culture of Central Asia, see Voigt’s article in the present volume. 51 In recent years, several studies have been devoted to the development of Middle Eastern archaeology in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a scholarly discipline as well as a tool of nationalism and colonialism (see Goode 2007; Trümpler [ed.] 2010). Although this volume does not dwell upon archaeological missions in Persia during this time, some collecting activities among archaeologists will be referred to throughout the articles of the present volume. For a good overview of the development of archaeology in modern Iran, see Abdi 2001. See also the history of the German Archaeological Institute’s Tehran branch, a subject which was re-examined through an exhibition and an international conference in 2011 (Helwing and Rahemipour [eds.] 2011).\n\nYuka Kadoi and Iván Szántó\n\n15\n\nprofiles. Furthermore, the boom of Persian objects in the art market was, inevitably, linked to the growth of suspicious excavations and trading as well as the rise of fakes and forgeries of Persian objects in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; the commercialisation of Persian art had an unwelcome impact on the academia as well.52 Finally, various 19th-century Eurocentric views to the art of the nonwestern world served to create a distorted, complicated timeline and hierarchy of Persian Islamic art. While the great mediaeval and postmediaeval Islamic dynasties were viewed as equivalent to European Renaissance courts, modern Persian artistic production, especially that of the Qajar and early-Pahlavi periods, was, almost deliberately, excluded from the history of Persian art. The objects of the latter were defined as the traditional crafts of Persia,53 although earlier examples of the same crafts acquired their honourable status as fine artworks. The study of Qajar art made a significant advancement in the last few decades, partially rectifying this situation. Yet post-Safavid Persian art in general still remains bound to the category of Islamic or Middle Eastern art instead of the global discourse of modern art, and it continues to suffer from neglect.54\n\nPersian Art in Central and East Europe: An Uncharted Field This volume does not intend to offer a comprehensive view to the history of studying and collecting objects from Islamic Iran and Central Asia across the globe, nor does it aim at including all the well-known collections and scholarly activities in West Europe and North America, such as those which evolved in late 19th- and early 20th-century London, Paris and New York. Similarly, the present volume does not extend the 52\n\nMany leading art historians were misled by forgeries in the past: besides the socalled “Buyid” textiles that began to appear on the market in the 1930s and led some scholars, including Dorothy Shepherd (1916–1992), to believe their authenticity, see, for instance, a lengthy monograph by Gaston Wiet which was devoted to a group of mediaeval-looking silks (Soieries persanes, Cairo, 1947). For forgeries of Persian art and smuggling from Iran, see, for example, Muscarella 2000, Majd 2003 and entries of “forgeries” in the EIr. 53 See Wulff 1966 and recently Floor 2003. 54 Despite recent exhibitions, such as Karlsruhe 2010, in which this problem has been readdressed, yet another show of Iranian contemporary art has been opened at the Museum of Ethnography in Warsaw at the time of writing this article (see Malek-Madani [ed.] 2012).

As for the rise of cultural institutions in the region, Shaw has conducted a pioneering investigation into the birth of modern museums in Ottoman Turkey, stressing their uniqueness, not merely as a result of westernisation but as part of Ottoman identity-making process (see Shaw 2003). Turning to Egypt, the Hungarian architect and founding director of the Arab Museum in Cairo, Max Herz (1856–1919), played an important role in the formation of modern Egyptian cultural identity: his life and career has been thoroughly studied by Ormos (Ormos 2009; Herz will be referred to in Szántó’s article in the present volume). Research also has started on the development of museology in Iran that can be traced back to 1876, the foundation year of the Imperial Museum (Talar-i Muze); this museum was established in the wake of Nasir al-Din Shah’s (r. 1848-96) first European Grand Tour (1873) (see Ekhtiar 2007). 56 See relevant entries on Islamic art collections (including Persian Islamic objects) in Ådahl and Ahlund 2000. For the development of Persian studies in France, the German-speaking world, Italy and the Netherlands, see Hourcade 1987; Fragner 1987; Piemontese 1987; Bruijn 1987, respectively. See also Gray 1985. 57 Besides relevant entries in Ådahl and Ahlund 2000, see major publications by the David Collection in Copenhagen (e.g. Folsach 2001); see also Edahl [Ådahl] 2008 for the Swedish collections of Persian art. 58 Although the Gulf collections of Persian art are relatively new as museum or private collections (e.g. Qatar and Kuwait), it is interesting to note that some important collections of Persian or Islamic art that had formerly been in the West recently found their way to the Gulf region. 59 See, for example, the catalogue of the ground-breaking exhibition of the Turks at the Royal Academy of Arts in London in 2005 (London 2005) that featured many Persian Islamic objects from Turkish collections, notably the TopkapÕ Saray Museum in Istanbul and the Museum of Turkish and Islamic Art in Istanbul. 60 Wink 1996-7 should be quoted as a comprehensive monograph about the Persian-Islamic cultural and artistic synthesis in India. It helps to understand how the patronage of, for example, the Mughal Emperor Akbar (1556–1605), was not just about the emergence of Mughal art through the migration of Persian artists but also the development of the vast Persian manuscript collections that included many\n\nYuka Kadoi and Iván Szántó\n\n17\n\nIberian Peninsula, Africa, East Asia, South-East Asia, Australia as well as Latin America. On the other hand, the current volume is much concerned with the collecting history of Islamic Persian art in Central and East Europe, intending to challenge a widespread view to the predominance of Ottoman cultural legacy in this region. With the exception of Poland—its adjective “Polonaise” was and is still associated with a certain type of Persian carpet63—the collections of Persian art in Central and East Europe were for a long time relatively neglected, compared to Ottoman material culture, a subject which has attracted a reasonable deal of research interest in both local and international scholarly communities.64 In discussing the emergence examples of what we now know as masterpieces of Persian painting. India thus offers a unique collecting history of Islamic art that is closely linked to antiquarian connoisseurship and precedes the 19th- and 20th-century collecting activities in Europe and America. 61 While Russian contributions to the development of Persian studies and art collections deserve an extensive reappraisal, the current volume limits itself to mention some aspects of Russian scholars and collections, especially in relation to Tajikistan. For the moment, see Atkin 1987; Loukonine and Ivanov 2003; a recent conference, entitled “Russian Orientalism to Soviet Ideology: the Persian-speaking World and Its History through Russian Eyes”, at the University of Oxford in 2012 (http://www.iranheritage.org/Russian_Orientalism/default.htm, accessed 21 February 2013). Among the leading Soviet Orientalists, the Armenian Joseph Orbeli (1887–1961) played an important role in the development of Persian art scholarship in early 20th-century Russia (for his biography, see Yuzbashyan 1964). 62 For example, see Kellner-Heinkele, Gierlichs and Heuer (eds.) 2008. 63 For a recent study of the Polonaise carpets and a list of relevant references up to the 2010s, see Banas 2011. The history of the term “Polonaise” is traced back to the late 19th century, when the Polish prince Wáadysáaw Czartoryski (1828–1894) exhibited Persian carpets in the Polish Pavilion at the 1878 Universal Exhibition in Paris. The coat-of-arms of his family woven in some of the carpets generated a misleading attribution of the carpets to Polish workshops. See also Ginter-Froáow’s article on the Polish collections of Persian manuscripts in this volume. 64 It was, for instance, in the late 1970s and 1980s that Jennifer M. Scarce researched the arts of the Islamic Balkans (Scarce [ed.] 1979, which is the proceedings of the symposium held at the Royal Scottish Museum [now National Museums Scotland]; for this museum’s collection, see Voigt’s article in the present volume) in July 1976. Veronika Gervers (1939–1979)—a native Hungarian who was a promising curator at the Royal Ontario Museum but died in the middle of her career—worked on textiles and costumes in the context of Euro-Ottoman relations; her publications include Influence of Ottoman Turkish Textiles and Costume in Eastern Europe, with Particular Reference to Hungary (1982). In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the Islamic cultural legacy in the\n\n18\n\nIntroduction\n\nof Persian art studies in different national contexts and, furthermore, in highlighting the role of Central Europe in this process, this volume also aims to dismiss the notion of a monolithic “Europe” or “West” which stands in a binary opposition to “the Orient.”65 As an academic discipline, Turkology in both pre-Islamic and Islamic times had already been developed as early as the first half of the 19th century, especially in Austria, owing to its diplomatic links with the Ottoman Empire,66 and in Hungary, thanks to its once-presumed linguistic tie with the ancient Turks.67 Arabic was also widely studied in Central and East Europe as a principal tool for the understanding of Islam, and this was closely linked to the translation and interpretation of the Qur’an and other Islamic religious texts.68 On the other hand, Persian studies lagged behind in the region, compared with West Europe,69 and remained a secondary subject that was merely part of Islamic, Middle Eastern or Oriental studies, as well as in some cases part of Indology.70 Nevertheless, some important Balkans (for example, see Maximilian Hartmuth [ed.], Centres and Peripheries in Ottoman Architecture: Rediscovering a Balkan Heritage [Sarajevo, 2011]). 65 In this respect, the current volume follows, for instance, Marchand 2009, 6. See also Malinowski (ed.) 2012 for the history of art history in Central and East Europe. 66 Suffice it to mention here Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall (1774–1856), the founding father of Ottoman studies, who taught in the Kaiserlich-königliche Akademie für Orientalische Sprachen (founded in 1754 by the Empress Maria Theresa) and became the co-founder and first president of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (1847–9). 67 Arminius Vámbéry (1832–1913), a self-taught linguist, historian and adventurer, should be mentioned as the founder of Turkology in Hungary. A chair of UraloAltaic philology was established at the Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE), Budapest, as early as 1872 and the department of Turkic philology—the first instance of this kind in Europe—in 1916. Several notable young Turkish students studied there, including Hamit Zübeyr Koúay (1897–1984) who later became the director of antiquities in the newly founded republic (Goode 2007, 20-21). 68 The Centre for the History of Arabic Studies in Europe (CHASE) was launched in March 2012 within the Warburg Institute in London, accompanied by the inaugural conference, “Translating the Qur’an.” 69 Germany became the undisputed centre of Persian studies in the 19th century where scholars such as Franz Bopp (1791–1867), Theodor Nöldeke (1836–1930) and Paul Horn (1863–1908) brought Persian philology to a synthesis on a hitherto unknown level, and this is exemplified in Grundriss der Iranischen Philologie (Strassburg, 1895-1904), edited by Wilhelm Ludwig Geiger (1856–1943) and other leading Orientalists. 70 This was the case with Poland (Krasnowolska 1987, 183-4). In Austria, the doctorate in comparative linguistics has been awarded since 1872 but no university\n\nYuka Kadoi and Iván Szántó\n\n19\n\nachievements in Persian art studies were made as a by-product of Turkish philology, such as Einführung in die persische Paläographie (Budapest, 1977) by the Ottoman scholar Lajos Fekete (1891–1969), published posthumously, which remains the standard work in the subject until today. In contrast to the slow emergence of Persian studies in Central Europe, art historians of the region discovered Persian art much earlier than those of West Europe, and Persian art was already included into the discussion of general art history. For example, the first general survey of world architecture, the Entwurff einer Historischen Architektur (Leipzig, 1725) by the Austrian architect Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach (1633– 1723) provided examples of the then recently built monuments of Isfahan.71 This marked the beginnings of a tradition of non-western art historians in the region, namely those without formal training in Oriental studies but with openness to look at the history of art from a global perspective, such as Alois Riegl (1858–1905) and Joseph Strzygowski. It is also interesting to note that, while carpets, textiles and architectural decoration remained focal points of connoisseurship, the first essay ever written for a journal about the Persian paintings from the TopkapÕ Saray albums was, rather unexpectedly, published in Hungarian in the 1880s by the art historian JenĘ Radisics (1956–1917).72 Poland established a strong academic interest in the art of Persia in the early 20th century, with the growth of a small yet exquisite scholarly community as well as its international reputation,73 and despite the long interruptions due to the war and communist times, the Polish scholarship\n\ndepartment of Persian (or Iranian) studies was established (in contrast with the Academy of Sciences where a Commission of Iranian Studies was founded in 1969 by Manfred Mayrhofer (1926–2011), and this developed into an independent institute in 2003). In Hungary, Vámbéry’s appointment as the professor of Persian (1870) did not lead to further institutionalisation until Zsigmond Telegdi (1909– 1994) received professorship at the predecessor of today’s Department of Iranian Studies at the Eötvös Loránd University. 71 Sussan Babaie’s paper, entitled “Urban Baroque and European town views of Isfahan and Istanbul”, which was given to the Ninth Biennial Conference of Iranian Studies in Istanbul (1-5 August 2012), discussed these aspects of Fischer’s Entwurff. 72 See Szántó and Kardos’s essay in the present volume. For a recent comprehensive study of Persian art in Hungary, see Szántó 2010. 73 For example, Poland was the only non-western European country that participated in the 1931 London exhibition of Persian art as one of the committee members, whereas Austria, Hungary and then Czechoslovakia were involved in the show as patrons and lenders (see London 1931, v-viii and 305-7).\n\n20\n\nIntroduction\n\nof Persian and Islamic art has been, albeit slowly, in the process of recapturing its pre-war spirit.74 The works of several figures in the region has so far received little international recognition, but the Austrian Joseph von Karabacek (1845– 1918),75 another Austrian Ernst Diez (1878–1961),76 the Hungarian Nándor Fettich (1900–1971)77 and the Polish Tadeusz MaĔkowski (1878– 1956)78 deserve special attention for their contributions to the development of Persian art studies in Central Europe. In the meantime, the Ukrainian-born Mikhail Rostovtzeff (1870–1952) and others discovered the Irano-Greek archaeological substratum of South Russian art across the Eurasian steppe at the turn of the 20th century. This had strong repercussions in the Persian-oriented scholarly minds of early 20th-century Poland and Hungary—both of which nurture a rich tradition of Sarmatian and Scythian mythology.79 Persian art does certainly exist in other neighbouring states, although its presence is virtually unknown outside the region. Apart from Slovakia,80 which, along with its collections, was formerly part of Hungary, the Czech Republic possesses small but interesting collections of Persian art, including the Persian manuscript collection in the National 74\n\nThe establishment of the Polish Society of Oriental Art was hallmarked by its first international conference (2009). See BiedroĔska-Sáota, Ginter-Froáow and Malinowski (eds.) 2011. 75 See Mauthe 2000 and Karl’s article in the present volume. 76 As a follower of Strzygowski, Diez applied some of his master’s theories about the crucial role of Persia in the global development of art, yet his approach differs in many details from that of 19th-century Orientalists scholars. Besides his thorough knowledge of Persian civilisation, his extensive travels across a wide area of Asia made him an expert on a par with other 20th century giants, such as Herzfeld, Sarre and Pope. See Kröger 1996 for the biography of Diez. 77 See, for instance, his article “Der skythische fund von Gartschinowo,” Archaeologia Hungarica, 15 (Budapest, 1934). Better known Hungarian Persian art experts of the time include Aurel Stein (1862–1943), but he is regarded internationally as British rather than Hungarian. 78 See Ginter-Froáow’s essay in the present volume. 79 Rostovtzeff’s Iranians and Greeks in South Russia (Oxford, 1922) became an important point of reference for Central and Eastern European archaeologists, such as Tadeusz Sulimirski (1898–1983) in Poland and Géza Supka (1883–1956) in Hungary. For a recent study of Central European archaeology in general, see Gramsch and Sommer (eds.) 2011. 80 Here a catalogue by the Hungarian-born Turkologist, Jozef Blaškoviþ (József Blaskovics, 1910–1990), Arabische, türkische und persische Handschriften der Universitäts-Bibliothek in Bratislava (Bratislava, 1961), could be mentioned.\n\nYuka Kadoi and Iván Szántó\n\n21\n\nLibrary.81 Among the Czech scholars of Persian studies, the subject of an essay in this volume, VČra Stivínová-Kubíþková (1918–2009) made a significant contribution to the formation of the discipline in the region, along with Stivínová-Kubíþková’s master, Jan Rypka (1886–1968), although their approach remained philological rather than art historical.82 It can be argued that, mostly because of geographic reasons, Persian art connoisseurship in Bohemia lagged behind other countries in Central Europe. Romania’s and Moldova’s share of Persian art is even less known, despite the unparalleled—and largely lost—collections of Persian carpets which were amassed by the princes of Moldavia in the 17th century.83 In spite of a stunning Persian literary activity in Albania and former Yugoslavia (modern-day Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Slovenia) during their Ottoman occupation, it is difficult to trace the Persian artistic legacy in the north of the Balkans, with the exception of Bosnia.84 Bulgaria, on the other hand, looks back to more ancient contacts with Persian art than any other European country, except Greece and Turkey, with a meagre but continuous influx of Persian artworks reaching it since the Achaemenid through the Qajar period until recent times.85\n\nAims and Scope of the Volume The present volume, which grows out of the panel organised by Yuka Kadoi in collaboration with Iván Szántó, Friederike Voigt and Joachim Gierlichs at the European Society for Central Asian Studies 11th Conference in Budapest in September 2009, brings together Islamic 81\n\nA recent project on the catalogue of Persian manuscripts in the National Library of the Czech Republic (part of the UNESCO “Memory of the World” project) has revealed an important aspect of Persian art collecting in the Czech lands (see http://digit.nkp.cz/samples/Persiana/index.htm, accessed 21 March 2013). 82 See DvoĜáková’s article in the present volume. 83 See Dunca’s article in the present volume. On the other hand, a large number of 16th- to 18th-century Anatolian rugs have been preserved in the churches and museum collections in Transylvania; one of the important advocates of these rugs was Emil Schmutzler (1889–1952), a member of the Saxon communities of Transylvania who published the monumental volume, Altorientalische Teppiche in Siebenbürgen (Leipzig, 1933). For the rise of Oriental studies in what was later to become Romania, see Timuú 2011. 84 See Szántó’s article in the present volume; Radojkoviü 1965; Szántó 2010, 3339. 85 Gergova 2010; Szántó 2010, 37, with further literature.\n\n22\n\nIntroduction\n\nIranian and Central Asian art experts from both museums and university spheres, intending to offer a novel insight into the art history of these regions. While supplementing publications in the historiography of Islamic art, such as Discovering Islamic Art: Scholars, Collectors and Collections 1850-1950 (2000), Ars Orientalis: Exhibiting the Middle East: Collections and Perceptions of Islamic Art, 30 (2000), After One Hundred Years: The 1910 Exhibition “Meisterwerke muhammedanischer Kunst” Reconsidered (2010), Res Orientales: Figures pionnières de l’orientalisme: Convergences européennes, Monde Anglophone, Europe centrale et orientale, 20 (2011) and Journal of Art Historiography: Islamic Art Historiography, 6 (2012),86 as well as works on the reception of Islamic art in France by Labrusse,87 this volume would be one of the pioneering publications to be dedicated solely to the historiography of Persian art collections and studies, especially those related to Islamic times. In this volume, emphasis is given to the relatively unknown collecting history and scholarship of Persian art of the Islamic period, especially those from Central and Eastern European countries and former Soviet states, keeping a good balance with already established collections and studies from western countries. Its essays show that these collections and studies developed within separate national frameworks, yet, directly or indirectly, in a close interaction. A recurrent theme in these national discourses is the attribution of a transnational character and universal significance to Persian art. The discussion sets out to the survey of Persian and Central Asian collections in Romania (Dunca) and Edinburgh (Voigt), two of the notable locations from the eastern and western fringes of Europe, supplemented by the reception of Persian manuscripts in Poland through the lens of literates rather than “miniature”-minded art historians (Ginter-Froáow). The next section deals with the reception of Persian art in the context of the AustroHungarian Empire. The essay about the ideologically-motivated usage of Persian art collections in Bosnia by Szántó assures a rich potential of study material on this subject not only in the Balkans but also as the legacy of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, an essential historical facet which is reconfirmed by Karl’s essay. DvoĜáková’s essay, still within the AustroHungarian framework, reveals the virtually unknown Persian collections of Czech museums and castles. In the section of collectors, exhibitions and 86 See Vernoit (ed.) 2000; Lermer and Shalem (eds.) 2010. The Ars Orientalis issue is edited by Linda Komaroff. The Res Orientales issue is edited by Živa Vesel and Isabelle Gadoin (see Vesel and Gadoin [eds.] 2011) and the Journal of Art Historiography issue is co-edited by Moya Carey and Margaret Graves. 87 See Labrusse 1988; Paris 2007; Lyon 2011.\n\nYuka Kadoi and Iván Szántó\n\n23\n\ninterpretations, Bombardier contextualises the development of Persian art scholarship in France in the 1930s, Troelenberg discusses the significance of Persian art in the context of one of the key Islamic art exhibitions in the early 20th century, Szántó and Kardos analyse the earliest surviving photographic reproductions of Persian painting, Gierlichs singles out individual scholars and collectors from Germany, whereas Kadoi offers a critical view to the mechanism of exhibition organisation in early 20thcentury America through a small carpet exhibition in the Midwest. An essay from Tajikistan by three authors concludes the discussion of the shaping of Persian art in modern Central Asia. Through the re-thinking of the process as to how the notion of “Persian” art emerged outside Iran, it is hoped that this volume provides an alternative avenue to a better understanding of the art traditions that developed in Iran and Central Asia throughout the ages.\n\nBibliography Abdi, K. 2001. “Nationalism, Politics, and the development of archaeology in Iran”, American Journal of Archaeology, 105/1: 51-76.

But because of the vicissitudes of history, only a few of them were preserved, although we can still see them represented in paintings or mentioned by old documents. In the second half of the 19th century Romania tried to assimilate the western life style, and the Oriental objects belonging to the daily life were suddenly looked upon as obsolete, as a reminder of the past that should be left behind. Since then, such objects have been kept in the newly created museums and libraries. The effort to assimilate the western civilisation thus remains a priority for the Romanian society as a whole, while artists try to synchronise their creation with the European artistic trends, especially French. It is noteworthy, for instance, that Romanian painting evolved in only a few decades from the Byzantine tradition to European modern art. Nevertheless, the familiarity with the aesthetics of the Islamic lands makes a subtle breakthrough, and this is how we can explain the artistic interest in Oriental objects such as gilims (kilims)1 or tribal items, whose refinement was perceived in West Europe only a few decades later.\n\nHistorical Background Walachia, Moldavia and Transylvania, the three historic provinces which form today’s Romania, evolved in different cultural conditions: Moldavia and Walachia emulated the Byzantine civilisation, whereas Transylvania was part of the Central-European cultural area. Despite the Ottoman suzerainty, these regions preserved a certain autonomy as they were not under Turkish administration. The united principalities of Moldavia and Walachia became independent in 1877.\n\n1\n\nIn this article, the Persian term “gilim” is used, although the term “kilim” is used in Romanian records.\n\nMircea Dunca\n\n31\n\nThe attempts to oppose the Ottoman pressure were mostly military, but also diplomatic, as this was the case, for instance, with the negotiations between Stephen the Great (r. 1457–1502), the prince of Moldavia, and Uzun Hasan (r. 1453–78), the ruler of Persia, in order to form an antiOttoman alliance. This diplomatic episode was indeed unique, but the commercial relations with West Asia, including Persia, were constant. The objects from this region including textiles, carpets and arms were brought to the Romanian principalities via Istanbul for internal use or to be exported in Central or West Europe. Romanian documents began to mention Persian items, though in smaller quantity than Ottoman products, as early as the 17th century. Persian carpets were, for instance, widely available in the Romanian provinces at the very beginning of the 17th century, as hundreds of them, including silk carpets and also gilims, are mentioned in documents of the Movilă family, one Moldavian princely family related to the Polish nobility.2 A Moldavian ruling prince (voivode), Vasile Lupu (r. 1634– 1653), may also have had “Polonaise” rugs in his palace, according to a contemporary Latin document which describes “halls set with carpets woven with golden thread.”3 Evidence is given for other Islamic objects belonging to this voivode, who is also known for his so-called “halls with chini.” The halls were decorated with ceramic tiles coming presumably from Iznik workshops, where Vasile Lupu had also ordered a commemorative tablet inscribed with the names of all his family. This voivode, so much inclined to luxury, often amazed foreign travellers who had the opportunity to meet him and who described the richness of his attire in their memoirs.4 He was depicted in a fresco of the Three Hierarchs Church in Iaúi, where he is represented wearing a robe and a caftan made of red and green Persian silk decorated with golden flowers.5 The clothes worn by voivodes or grand boyars (high-ranking members of the Walachian and Moldavian aristocracies) were made of precious Oriental or Italian materials with enormous value; this explains why they were often part of princely donations to churches or monasteries. This is particularly the case with two 16th-century garments—a velvet caftan and a woman’s sarasar court robe, both of Ottoman origin—which were transformed and used in churches, the first as a cover, the second as an\n\n2\n\nDunca-Moisin 2000, 233. The documents are published by Corfus 1972, 29-59. Codex Bandinus 1895, 141. 4 Alexianu 1971, vol. 1, 316-8. 5 The fresco fragment is now at the Museum of the Metropolitan Church in Iaúi. 3\n\n32\n\nPersian Art in Romania Before World War I\n\necclesiastical cope.6 Two 17th-century Safavid silks, woven in the sarasar technique, now in the collection of the National Museum of Art of Romania (hereafter, NMAR), may be of a similar provenance. One of them (Fig. 1.1), which is decorated with repeating pattern of white poppy plants on golden background, served as a phelonion (liturgical vestment resembling a chasuble), whereas the other, decorated with red roses, was used as a chalice veil.7 It was by pure chance that a small and well preserved 17th-century Isfahan carpet, decorated with palmettes, lotus flowers and cloudbands, which originally came from a Moldavian monastery, is now in the NMAR collection (Fig. 1.2). This carpet, with silk warps and both ends finished with original silk brocading, was part of Romania’s treasury sent to Moscow during World War I for security. It was in 1956 that the USSR returned a part of the treasury, including the Isfahan carpet, to Romania. The carpet remained for a few decades in one of the Museum’s storerooms under the administration of the Medieval Romanian Art Department until the 1990s, and it was transferred to the newly created Department of Oriental Art along with other Oriental carpets. It was only then that the value of this carpet, which had been long neglected, was reassessed, and the carpet was eventually restored,8 exhibited and published.9 As far as we know, the two silks and this Isfahan carpet are the only art objects of undoubted Persian origin coming from churches and preserved in Romania.10 It is nevertheless most certain that other Persian merchandise, such as objects of artistic value, must have frequently circulated in Romania. Documents dating from the 17th and 18th centuries often refer to Persian carpets and gilims, and their Persian origin is clearly indicated\n\n6\n\nIn the 1960s they were both reconstituted in the textile restoration laboratory of the National Museum of Art of Romania. See Nicolescu, 1970A, cat. nos. 3 and 4; Atasoy et al., 2001, 259, fig. 179. 7 Nicolescu 1970B, cat. nos. 36 and 42. 8 One of the restorers’ tasks was to clean the candle wax stains left on the carpet, which testify its presence in a church. 9 Dunca 2006, cat. no. 21. 10 It was not uncommon for churches to keep Islamic objects in their treasures. The well-known cases are Transylvanian Protestant churches, where hundreds of Ottoman carpets are still preserved. At the end of the 16th century, fifty Ottoman carpets were documented in a Moldavian orthodox monastery (Galata in Iaúi) as gifts from different boyars and even from the voivode, but these are unfortunately lost.\n\nMircea Dunca\n\n33\n\nin their Romanian term, “agimeúti,” as they came from Agem (ұAjam; Persia).11 The Oriental mode began to be evident in Moldavia and Walachia from the 17th century onwards, and it reached its heights during the 18th and the first few decades of the 19th century. By the end of the 18th century, besides the aforementioned textiles and carpets, Kashmir shawls had become increasingly fashionable. As one can see in boyars’s portraits painted in the first half of the 19th century,12 the shawl was one of the most important accesories of their costume. In 1782, for instance, the boyar IenăchiĠă Văcărescu (1740–1797) was sent to Vienna on a diplomatic mission, and his Oriental attire was so sensational that, during a party, he had to take off his shawl so that the ladies could better admire it.13 These shawls must have been very valuable and very coveted, as in 1812 when the plague epidemic ravaged Bucharest, there were thieves who, taking advantage of the desolation, entered the homes and stole money, jewellery and shawls.14 Many of them are now in Romanian public and private art collections, but neither these objects, nor those represented in portraits have not yet been thoroughly examined. Some of them are Indian, others are made in Europe, and some are most probably of Persian origin. Oriental culture was accessible to Romanian cultivated boyars and voivodes who were able to speak and read Turkish and even Persian. Among them was the well-known scholar Dimitrie Cantemir (1673–1723), the voivode of Moldavia (1693 and 1710–11) as well as the member of the Academy in Berlin, who lived for many years in Istanbul. During what is generally known as the Phanariot regime (from the beginning of the 18th through the first quarter of the 19th century) when members of the Greek 11\n\nThe term is spelled also hagimiú or hagimeúti (singular, masculin: agimesc or hagimesc). Agem, agimesc come from the Arabic word ҳajam, meaning “stranger,” hence Persian. It came into Romanian from Turkish and appears mostly in 18thcentury documents with reference to Persian gilims or carpets. In a Polish document regarding the carpets from a Moldavian voivode related to the Movilă family, the Polish word designating Persian gilims is adziamskich. At the end of the 17th century there are mentions concerning “loads” coming from Agem (Persia). In the second half of the 19th century, the Romanian writer Ion Ghica (1816–1897) mentions Agem carpets which, together with Ushak carpets adorned a palace in Bucharest in the first quarter of the century. He probably uses this term as an archaism. 12 There are many such portraits in the Romanian Modern Art Gallery of the NMAR. 13 Alexianu 1971, vol. 2, 98. 14 Ghica 2001, 36.\n\n34\n\nPersian Art in Romania Before World War I\n\nor Hellenised families from the Phanar district of Istanbul were appointed rulers of Moldavia and Walachia, Oriental culture became even more familiar. Phanariot rulers are known to have possessed very rich collections of books and manuscripts; some of the Oriental manuscripts now in public collections may come from Phanariot private libraries.\n\nPersian Art in 19th-century Romanian Collections In 19th-century Transylvania, which was under Austrian and later under Austrian-Hungarian administration, the interest in Oriental culture was mostly scientific. A good example in this respect is the Romanian scholar Timotei Cipariu (1805–1887) who owned the largest private library in Transylvania at the time. He was a priest of the Greek-Catholic Church, but also a historian, linguist, orientalist and the member of the Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft in Leipzig; he possessed an impressive collection of Oriental manuscripts which he bought from a bookseller in Bucharest who had a representative in Istanbul and then in Cairo. In 1887, Cipariu’s collection of books and manuscripts was bequeathed to the library of the Seminary in Blaj, the spiritual and cultural centre of GreekCatholic Romanians, and became the first collection of Oriental manuscripts in a Romanian library in Transylvania. In 1948, when the communist regime outlawed the Greek-Catholic Church, these manuscripts were transferred to Cluj, and they are now in the local department of the Library of the Romanian Academy. Cipariu’s collection of Arabic, Persian and Turkish manuscripts contains, among others, a copy of the Shahname in two volumes, with twenty miniatures by several painters from the end of the 16th and the beginning "
