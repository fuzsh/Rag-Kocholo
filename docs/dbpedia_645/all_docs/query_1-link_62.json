        "text": "Somebody on Reddit posted a series of maps of a post-Entente victory in North America, called \"There is No Hope under the Golden Circle\" or \"It's Always Sunny in West-Jersey.\"\n\nHere is the basic map.

There's a lot of great discussion in the comments here\n\nI'm not sure who the Confederate stand-ins for the German successors would be. One commenter suggested George Wallace as a Speer analogue, proposing token reforms but in his heart still being a true believer in Freedomite ideology. His Gang of Four would include the likes of Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter as legitimate reformers.\n\nI like the idea of Patton and Potter as Schoerner and Spiedel but don't know which pairing is a better fit.

Love the idea of Tsarist Russia being the Imperial Japan analog.\n\nI don't think there's a need for a direct analogue to everything in TNO and any worldbuilding project would suffer from trying to make the pieces line up. For example, the map I linked above has 191!Mexico as the equivalent of TNO!Italy, but in TL-191 Mexico more closely resembled Spain especially given its interwar situation. The parallels are always going to be strained so I don't think we can line up the timelines in anything other than broad strokes.\n\nThat said, I'm curious what the situation in Europe would be. The US in TNO is the last surviving major member of the Allies and has maintained its status as a world power. If you really want to push the parallels then I suppose Germany could fill that role in the 191 version, but I don't see the UK, France, and Russia letting a hostile power remain in central Europe. I think a 191!Entente victory scenario would need to be an absolute victory since the existence of the CSA means that none of the major powers have a continent to themselves.\n\nConsidering there are four major Entente members all broadly rightist but with different ideological flavors (IIRC, the UK remains democratic despite a strong fascist presence in government, and I don't see any of the European members staying as radicalized following a GW2 victory, at least not to the degree of the Freedom Party). The Cold War could be either tripolar (CSA/Golden Circle vs. Russian sphere vs. Anglo-French sphere) or quadrupolar (if the UK and France split).\n\nAgain, its been a while since I've read TL-191 so forgive me if I have the details fuzzy, especially on the political situation in the European Entente members.\n\nSomebody on Reddit posted a series of maps of a post-Entente victory in North America, called \"There is No Hope under the Golden Circle\" or \"It's Always Sunny in West-Jersey.\"\n\nHere is the basic map.

It's been a while since I've read TL-191 so I don't remember all the nuance (I even had to google a list of characters)\n\nThe problem is that I don’t really see who the Himmler/Burgundy analogue could be. Pennsylvania and New Jersey is a long way from the Confederate heartland after all, and I don’t really see them adapting the sort of “more southern than thou” mentality(like Burgundy’s ”we’re the “real” Aryans view of Nazi Germany).\n\nThe problem is that I don’t really see who the Himmler/Burgundy analogue could be.

Kishi is entirely sane, just evil. In that light perhaps Rodzaevsky would be a good fit for Kishi.\n\nAlso: Malcolm X as Kovner. \"They wanted one thing: Antiqam. Revenge.\"\n\nOktan-Kaya\n\nRodzheavsky-Kishi\n\nGul-Takagi\n\nLevitov-Ikeda(oweing to his role in KN as wanting to uphold the status quo, through KN!Levitov is a bit closer to Speer)\n\nA major issue with TL-191 TNO and CSA as Germany is that a lot of the characters were born in the 1880s and might be too old to assume power and govern for 10 years. I could however see Koenig as Bormann.\n\nI think it would help if the TL-191 TNO had elements of Fatherland, since we kinda need an OFN equvilent. This could be achieved by having Germany defeat France and stalemate Britain, but CSA wins in the South and a superbomb is used to force Germany to the peace table before it could attack Russia. So we'd have CSA vs. Russia vs. Mittleuropa cold war.\n\nAlso the linked maps are a bit out of date, so use this instead:\n\n[Parallels under construction]\n\nDamn, Poor Mexico. I kinda liked the Rump US as Vichy France more, but I do like the Golden Circle better as a name for the Burgundians.\n\nConfederate States of America Parallels:\n\nJake Featherston=Adolf Hitler\n\nFerdinand Koening=Martin Bormann\n\nNathan Bedford Forrest=Herman Goering\n\nGeorge Wallace=Albert Speer(through he might be a bit more genuinely repentant and maybe express some admiration at the G4 analogue given that he did kinda back down from these views)\n\nGeorge Lincoln Rockwell=Reinhard Heydrich\n\nLyndon B. Johnson=Helmut Schmidt\n\nRussell Long=Kurt Georg Kiesinger\n\nStrom Thurmond=Baldur von Schirach\n\nJB Stoner=Gerhard Klopfer\n\nEdwin Walker=Ferdinand Schorner\n\nEldon Edwards=Otto Ernst Remer\n\nRobert W. Welch Jr.=Theodore Oberlander\n\nGerald L. K. Smith=Heinrich Himmler\n\nCassius Madison=Markus Wolf(context: here)\n\nWalter Reuther=Willy Brandt\n\nNot sure who would be the Brandt analogue but he'd have to be a southern politician that was really pro desegregation OTL.\n\nDeciding on the Heydrich analogue was the toughest I will say.\n\nMore notes\n\nPersonally I will say I think Britain fits better as an Italian Empire analogue, and Argentina as Turkey so will diverge from the map a bit there. However, Gran Columbia works well as a Iberian union analogue with the idea that the right wing governments of Columbia, Venezuela and Ecuador of the decided to revive Bolivar's dream as a means of opposing whatever plans Featherston had for them\n\nThe main far-left ideology divide for would be between Socialism-Lincolnism(for TNO it's Socialism-Communism, formerly authsoc-libsoc), with Lincolinism being the ML equvilent and many Union politicians radicalizing into Lincolinism, through there is a divide between more authoritarian and more light-handed forms of Lincolnism\n\nA List of US Warlords by analogue:\n\nNote: See map here to see where they likely are\n\nSablin-Howard Zinn(converted to Lincolnism rather than anarchism, but interprets it in a more libertarian light)\n\nYagoda-J.

Maybe the British break away over disagreements regarding Canada with Featherston, and decide to form their own bloc with Gran Colombia and South America. Eventually, Britain shifts over to the Germans and joins the European Community."
