2 August 1918 Captain Gerald Joseph Constable Maxwell MC is awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross:

This officer has at all times shown exceptional skill and gallantry and on numerous occasions has fought against greatly superior numbers. During the last six weeks he had brought down five enemy aeroplanes. Recently, he approached unobserved to within ten yards of three Fokker triplanes, one of which he shot down. He was chased for about nine miles by the remaining two until he met a formation of six Camels, these he led to attack some enemy aircraft, although he had only twenty-five minutes' petrol left.
