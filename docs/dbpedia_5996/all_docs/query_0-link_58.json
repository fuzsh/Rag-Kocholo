Marsham-Townshend had been at the front for about two months when he was killed.\n\nThe following account of the fighting on the 16th pay, 1915, was published in a weekly paper: “Another episode which sent my mind back to the early days of the War was the heroic stand of the officers and men of the Scots Guards in the sanguinary fighting in the Rue du Bois. Two officers and eighty men of the Scots Guards fought to the last cartridge, and were found dead in the Rue du Bois, surrounded by heaps of German corpses. This was during the fighting at Festubert. This is what Mr. Valentine Williams says of these brave fellows: 'Soaked by the rain, blackened by the sun, their bodies were not beautiful to look upon ; but the German dead spread plentifully around, the empty cartridge cases scattered about, the twisted bayonets and the broken rifles showed the price a Scots Guard sets upon his honour. No monarch ever had a finer lying in state than those eighty guardsmen dead amid the long coarse grass of this dreary Flanders plain.'”\n\n2nd Lieutenant Marsham-Townshend was one of the two officers referred to.
