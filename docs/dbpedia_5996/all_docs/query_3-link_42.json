        "text": "Bio:\n\nNelson joined the at the Allen Institute in August 2021 as a Scientist working on the Human Cell Types team. His research is focused on developing analytical tools and methods to characterize the epigenetics defining cell types in the human brain in part to construct more specific viral gene therapies. Previously, he completed a PhD in Computer Science from the University of California, Davis in Gerald Quonâ€™s group where he developed machine learning methods in critical areas of single cell biology to better understand the molecular definitions of cell type and state. His research touched on a wide range of applications including characterizations of malaria parasites, identifying cross-species cell type homologies and spatial deconvolution. Prior to that, Nelson received his BSc in Computer Science from the University of California, Davis."
