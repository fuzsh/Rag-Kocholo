        "text": "October 26, 1932 – August 22, 2015\n\nGerald “Jerry” was born on October 26, 1932 in Atwood, Rainy River District of Ontario. He grew up in a large family of eleven brothers and sisters.\n\nAs a young man he worked in the tourist camps of Rainy Lake as a fishing guide. There he met his future wife Florabelle (Flo) Miner. They married August 7, 1954 and lived in Barwick Ontario. They were blessed with three children before moving to Rainy River, then on to Prince Rupert in BC. While in Rupert their family grew by two more. Jerry loved the outdoors and instilled this in his young family. They enjoyed many hiking trips, fishing and hunting.\n\nJerry, Flo and their five children then moved to Smithers where he did various carpentry jobs before acquiring a position with the Ministry of Forests. This position allowed Jerry to combine his love of the outdoors with his occupation. During this time the family became complete with the birth of their last son.\n\nTheir final move as a family was to “Ewald’s Mountain” where Jerry’s love of farming, from his youth, could be incorporated into their hobby farm in Quick while continuing his fulltime job with the Forestry Department. The farm allowed Jerry to mentor his children in the ways of the land while also teaching them to hunt and trap. The art of yodeling, while not mastered by any of this children, was also demonstrated frequently.\n\nAfter many years and grandchildren, Jerry and Flo retired to Granisle. Not one to sit idle for long, Jerry took to politics and became a councillor, then Mayor of the village they called home. Granisle offered an opportunity to spend time with his family and friends in the mountains and on the water of Babine Lake. A place that in earlier years, the family had a cabin on.\n\nHis love of flower gardening flourished during retirement and brought him much happiness. He continued gardening after their move to Terrace and his beautiful dahlias, petunias, lilies and gladioli adorned the front yard of their home.\n\nEven as Jerry grew older and experienced medical setbacks he continued to love being outdoors. Hunting, fishing, trapping and gardening was his life but most of all he was a farmer at heart. His family meant everything to him and sharing his passion for nature with his wife, six children, fifteen grandchildren, twenty-six great grandchildren, nieces and nephews gave him his greatest joy.\n\nJerry is survived by his loving wife Flo, daughter Bonnie (Norman) Merlo, daughter-in-law Kris, son George (Debbie), son Greg (Susan), daughter Karen (Ron) Poole, son Kevin (Michelle), grandchildren, great grandchildren, many nieces, nephews and other relatives.\n\nHe is also survived by brothers Bob (Elsie), Bill (Gean), Don (Isabel), Ken (Carol) and Thea.\n\nJerry is predeceased by his mother Ethel Ewald, father Daniel Ewald, siblings Lorna, Jack, Glenn, Olive and Bruce as well as their son Max.\n\nJerry gave in to his last medical battle and peacefully slipped into his life beyond on August 22, 2015 where he will join the rest of his family.\n\nThe family would like to thank you all for your kindness, your thoughts and prayers at this time.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Christine Morrison Hospice C/O Fraser Valley Health Care Foundation, 7324 Hurd Street, Mission, BC, V2V 3H5."
