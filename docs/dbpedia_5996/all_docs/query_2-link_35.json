He went to be with his parents on May 13, 2022, at the age of 85.\n\nHe was born to Walter and Mary (Reynolds) Maxwell on Dec. 31, 1936. Jerry met his wife Joan Gould while they were roller skating in Walton.

Jerry would remain on the corner of Elm and Kingston until 1997 when he retired. Jerry also drove a school bus for Delaware Academy during this time and transported at least three generations of families to school making memories with many of the young students. After retiring from Delaware Academy, Jerry went on to drive for the Delaware County Office for the Aging, where he drove Indy I and II all over the state for another 11 years before retiring for the third and final time.\n\nIn the 1960's Jerry also served in the New York National Guard where he achieved the rank of Sargent. Jerry volunteered with the Delhi Fire Department and enjoyed being a part of their band as well as volunteering with the Delhi Community Band in the summers, Jerry loved to play the base drum.
