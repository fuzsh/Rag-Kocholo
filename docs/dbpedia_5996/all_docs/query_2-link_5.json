        "text": "Just like one of his biggest hits, âFortunate,â singer Maxwell has definitely been fortunate throughout his career. The three-time Grammy winner says heâs proud of the music he makes.\n\nShaking and grabbing his trademark afro, Maxwell said, âIâm extremely touched by the fact that someone with all of this nonsense going on could be in the R&B world.â\n\nThe East New York, Brooklyn nativeâs love songs have a distinct and seductive sound that stands the test of time.\n\nQuite a few have become wedding songs, including âFortunate,â âAscensionâ and âPretty Wings.â\n\nThe R&B star is still pretty surprised couples use the breakup song âPretty Wingsâ for weddings. His goal has been to make songs that stand the test of time.\n\nâWhen I was 21 years old, that was the aim. The aim was, if I canât do this at 50, Iâm not releasing it at 20 or 30,â explained Maxwell. âIâm just grateful that literally everyone went along with the ride. You have to understand that I was released in 1996 in the height of Hip-Hop.â\n\nHe credits other R&B and soul singers of the 90s for helping to inspire him.\n\nâI have to give props to DâAngelo because he put out his record in '95 and kind of really helped open the door for like a very different sound, and then Erykah Badu. And just to be a part of that and to know that we came from that time.â\n\nMaxwell is all about keeping soul music alive.\n\nâAll day long R&B progressive soul. Celebrating the masters, celebrating the ancestors, you know, Sam Cooke, Marvin Gaye. For me, itâs all about the tradition.â\n\nWhile his focus was always on powerful music, initially he was not looking to become a star. He thought his big break would come when he submitted music for an album for the legendary group Earth, Wind and Fire.\n\nâFor me, I was real shy so I didnât think I would be in the front. I thought that Iâd probably write songs for people or make commercial jingles,â Maxwell said.\n\nBut eventually music executives liked his style. As he started performing at the Manhattan hot spot Nellâs in the mid-90s, others knew Maxwell was a rising star.\n\nâSo I kind of like overcame my fears, I had really bad stage fright,â recalled the singer. âMy first show I did at Nellâs, Spike Lee was there, Eddie Murphy was there because it was a big club and everyone came.â\n\nHis latest single is titled âOff.â But Gerald Maxwell Rivera remains on it musically as well as consciously. He is trying to help people in Black and brown communities.\n\nâIâm Haitian and Puerto Rican. My mom is from Haiti, my dad is from Puerto Rico. I have to pay it forward, so I work with a lot of organizations to try to get education to kids. I also work with APJ (Artists for Peace and Justice) which is a foundation that helps kids in Haiti.â\n\nMaxwell has been busy so far this year, with numerous tour dates across the country. He is currently working on a new album and hopes to release it in the near future."
