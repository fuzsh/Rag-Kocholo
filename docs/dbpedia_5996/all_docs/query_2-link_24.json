        "text": "Gerald Joseph Constable Maxwell MC DFC AFC (8 September 1895 – 18 December 1959) was a British Flying Ace in World War I credited with twenty-six victories.\n\nBackground[]\n\nMaxwell was born in Beauly near Inverness, Scotland, the nephew of Lord Lovat, notable for raising the Lovat Scouts in the Boer War.[1] He was educated at Downside School.[2]\n\nInvolvement in World War 1[]\n\nMaxwell was commissioned in the Lovat Scouts on 4 August 1914 and he fought at Gallipoli. He then served in Egypt before returning to the UK, where he transferred to the RFC in September 1916. Maxwell completed final pilot training at Central Flying School, Upavon and joined No. 56 Squadron in London Colney in March 1917. He was attached to 'A' Flight, commanded by Captain Albert Ball, flying SE5 aircraft. In April 1917, Maxwell's squadron was sent to France and he achieved a victory on his first patrol.[3] Four days later he was hit by anti-aircraft fire and crashed unhurt.\n\nOn 26 July 1917 Maxwell was promoted to flight commander, by which time he had been credited with eight victories. He was awarded the MC on 18 October and was posted back to the UK. After instructing at the School of Aerial Fighting at Turnberry, he returned to 56 Squadron, where in six weeks he claimed six more victories.\n\nHis confirmed 26 victories consisted of 12 enemy aircraft destroyed (including two shared wins), and 14 \"out of control\" victories, six of which were shared. In scoring the shared victories, he teamed with such other aces as Cecil Lewis, Edric Broadberry, Charles Jeffs, and Cyril Crowe.[4]\n\nHe resigned from the RAF in 1922 to become a director of Maxwell-Chrysler Motors.[2]\n\nLater Military Service[]\n\nHe was called up in the next war, becoming station commander at RAF Ford from 1941 to 1945.[2] Maxwell was a member of the Royal Company of Archers, a Knight of Malta and Privy Chamberlain of the Pope.[2] He was also a Deputy Lieutenant for Hampshire.[2]\n\nFamily life[]\n\nMaxwell married Carolyn Carden in 1920 and they had two sons and four daughters, one of the sons was killed flying in 1950 while with the RAF.[2] Maxwell died at Alresford House, Old Alresford near Winchester on 18 December 1959 aged 64.[2]\n\nHonours and awards[]\n\n18 October 1917 Captain Gerald Joseph Constable Maxwell Yeo. and R.F.C is awarded the Military Cross:\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty on many occasions. He has taken part in forty-three offensive patrols, in fourteen of which he acted as leader. He has destroyed at least three enemy aircraft, and driven down nine others completely out of control. He has consistently shown great skill in aerial combats, and his fearlessness and fine offensive spirit have been a splendid example to others.\n\n— London Gazette[5]\n\n2 August 1918 Captain Gerald Joseph Constable Maxwell MC is awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross:\n\nThis officer has at all times shown exceptional skill and gallantry and on numerous occasions has fought against greatly superior numbers. During the last six weeks he had brought down five enemy aeroplanes. Recently, he approached unobserved to within ten yards of three Fokker triplanes, one of which he shot down. He was chased for about nine miles by the remaining two until he met a formation of six Camels, these he led to attack some enemy aircraft, although he had only twenty-five minutes' petrol left.\n\n— London Gazette[6]"
