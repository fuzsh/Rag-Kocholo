        "text": "International political and economic discussion group\n\nThe Trilateral Commission is a nongovernmental international organization aimed at fostering closer cooperation between Japan, Western Europe and North America.[1] It was founded in July 1973, principally by American banker and philanthropist David Rockefeller, an internationalist[2] who sought to address the challenges posed by the growing economic and political interdependence between the U.S. and its allies in North America, Western Europe, and Japan.[3] The leadership of the organization has since focused on returning to \"our roots as a group of countries sharing common values and a commitment to the rule of law, open economies and societies, and democratic principles\".[4]\n\nThe Trilateral Commission is headed by an executive committee and three regional chairs representing Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region, with headquarters in Paris, Washington, D.C., and Tokyo, respectively. Meetings are held annually at locations that rotate among the three regions; regional and national meetings are held throughout the year.[5] Most gatherings focus on discussing reports and debating strategy to meet the commission's aims.[citation needed]\n\nThe Trilateral Commission represents influential commercial and political interests. As of 2021, there were roughly 400 members, including leading figures in politics, business, media, and academia. Each country within the three regions is assigned a quota of members reflecting its relative political and economic strength.[citation needed]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFounding\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Trilateral Commission was formed in 1973 by private citizens of Japan, North American nations (the U.S. and Canada), and Western European nations[3] to foster substantive political and economic dialogue across the world. The idea of the commission was developed in the early 1970s, a time of considerable discord among the United States and its allies in Western Europe, Japan, and Canada.[6] To quote its founding declaration:\n\n\"Growing interdependence is a fact of life of the contemporary world. It transcends and influences national systems... While it is important to develop greater cooperation among all the countries of the world, Japan, Western Europe, and North America, in view of their great weight in the world economy and their massive relations with one another, bear a special responsibility for developing effective cooperation, both in their own interests and in those of the rest of the world.\"\n\n\"To be effective in meeting common problems, Japan, Western Europe, and North America will have to consult and cooperate more closely, on the basis of equality, to develop and carry out coordinated policies on matters affecting their common interests... refrain from unilateral actions incompatible with their interdependence and from actions detrimental to other regions... [and] take advantage of existing international and regional organizations and further enhance their role.\"\n\n\"The Commission hopes to play a creative role as a channel of free exchange of opinions with other countries and regions. Further progress of the developing countries and greater improvement of East-West relations will be a major concern.\"[7]\n\nZbigniew Brzezinski, a Rockefeller advisor who was a specialist on international affairs (and later President Jimmy Carter's National Security Advisor from 1977 to 1981), left Columbia University to organize the group, along with:[8]\n\nEdwin Reischauer, professor at Harvard University and United States Ambassador to Japan, 1961–1966[citation needed]\n\nGeorge S. Franklin, executive director of the Council on Foreign Relations 1953–1971[9][10]\n\nGerard C. Smith, SALT I negotiator and its first North American chairman\n\nHenry D. Owen, foreign policy studies director at the Brookings Institution[11]\n\nMax Kohnstamm, European Policy Centre[citation needed]\n\nRobert R. Bowie, the Foreign Policy Association and director of the Harvard Center for International Affairs[citation needed]\n\nMarshall Hornblower, former partner at Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering[citation needed]\n\nTadashi Yamamoto, Japan Center for International Exchange[12]\n\nWilliam Scranton, former governor of Pennsylvania. [citation needed]\n\nOther founding members included Alan Greenspan and Paul Volcker, both later heads of the Federal Reserve System. [citation needed]\n\nThe organization's records are stored at the Rockefeller Archive Center in North Tarrytown, NY.[13]\n\nMeetings\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Trilateral Commission initiated its biannual meetings in October 1973 in Tokyo, Japan. In May 1976 the first plenary meeting of all of the commission's regional groups took place in Kyoto, Japan. Since the ninth meeting in 1978, plenary meetings have taken place annually. Besides annual plenary meetings, regional meetings have also taken place in each of the Asia Pacific Group, the European Group and the North American Group.[14] Since its founding, the discussion group has produced an official journal, Trialogue.[citation needed]\n\nMembership\n\n[edit]\n\nMembership is divided into numbers proportionate to each of the think tank's three regional areas. North America is represented by 120 members: 20 Canadian, 13 Mexican and 87 American. The European group has reached its limit of 170 members from almost every country on the continent; the ceilings for individual countries are 20 for Germany, 18 for France, Italy and the United Kingdom, 12 for Spain and 1–6 for the rest. At first Asia and Oceania were represented only by Japan, but in 2000 the Japanese group of 85 members became the Pacific Asia group, comprising 117 members: 75 Japanese, 11 South Koreans, seven Australian and New Zealand citizens, and 15 members from the ASEAN nations (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand). The Pacific Asia group also included 9 members from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The commission now claims \"more than 100\" Pacific Asian members.[7]\n\nThe Trilateral Commission's bylaws apparently deny membership to public officials. It draws its members from politics, business, and academia, and has three chairpersons, one from each region. The current chairs are former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Joseph S. Nye, Jr., former head of the European Central Bank Jean-Claude Trichet, and Yasuchika Hasegawa, chair of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company.[15]\n\nLeadership\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of September 2021[16]\n\nName Position Jean-Claude Trichet European Chairman Meghan O'Sullivan North American Chairman Akihiko Tanaka Asia Pacific Chairman Alexandra Papalexopoulou European Deputy Chairman Herminio Blanco Mendoza North American Deputy Chairman Barry Desker Asia Pacific Deputy Chairman Carl Bildt European Deputy Chairman Jeffrey Simpson North American Deputy Chairman Jin Roy Ryu Asia Pacific Deputy Chairman David Rockefeller (deceased) Founder Peter Sutherland (deceased) Honorary European Chairman Georges Berthoin European Honorary Chairman Paul Volcker (deceased) North American Honorary Chairman Yasuchika Hasegawa Asia Pacific Honorary Chairman Paolo Magri European Director Richard Fontaine North American Director Hideko Katsumata Asia Pacific Director\n\nNotable members\n\n[edit]\n\nGraham Allison, Director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and Dean of the Harvard Kennedy School\n\nAlyssa Ayres, Dean of the Elliott School of International Affairs, George Washington University\n\nCatherine Bertini, Professor, Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs\n\nAntony Blinken, U.S. Secretary of State since 2021, son of Donald Mayer Blinken, stepson of Samuel Pisar[17][18]\n\nMichael R.

Chomsky adds that as it was an internal discussion, they felt free to \"let their hair down\" and to talk openly about the need for an increasingly active and defiant public to be reduced back to its proper state of apathy and obedience lest it continue to use democratic means to deprive them of their power.[62]\n\nCritics accuse the Commission of promoting a global consensus among the international ruling classes in order to manage international affairs in the interest of the financial and industrial elites under the Trilateral umbrella.[63][64]\n\nIn his 1980 book With No Apologies, Republican Senator Barry Goldwater suggested that the discussion group was \"a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power: political, monetary, intellectual, and ecclesiastical... [in] the creation of a worldwide economic power superior to the political governments of the nation-states involved.\"[65]\n\nConspiracy theories involving the Trilateral Commission\n\n[edit]\n\nSome conspiracy theorists believe the organization to be a central plotter of a world government or synarchy. In his book Among the Truthers: A Journey Through America's Growing Conspiracist Underground, Jonathan Kay wrote that Luke Rudkowski interrupted a lecture by former Trilateral Commission director Zbigniew Brzezinski in April 2007 and accused the organization and a few others of having orchestrated the 9/11 attacks to initiate a new world order.[66]\n\nEconomist Anthony C. Sutton was critical of the Trilateral Commission's goals and methods, but also said the group could not be characterized as conspiratorial. He wrote: \"The Trilateral Commission is not a conspiracy. Its membership list is completely public - it costs a postage stamp to get one. The Commission publishes dozens of booklets. The organization is completely above ground.\" Furthermore, Sutton noted he had debated a high-ranking member of the group on a radio broadcast and concluded: \"Conspirators just don't appear on radio talk shows to debate their objectives.\"[67]\n\nNeo-conservative pundit Charles Krauthammer mockingly alluded to the conspiracy theories about the commission when he was asked in 2012 who makes up the \"Republican establishment\", saying, \"Karl Rove is the president. We meet every month on the full moon... [at] the Masonic Temple. We have the ritual: Karl brings the incense, I bring the live lamb and the long knife, and we began... with a pledge of allegiance to the Trilateral Commission.\"[68]\n\nPublications\n\n[edit]\n\nBooks\n\nCrozier, Michel; Huntington, Samuel; Watanuki, Joji (1975).
