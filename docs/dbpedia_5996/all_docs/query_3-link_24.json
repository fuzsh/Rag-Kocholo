While I know he has other patients, whenever I come to see him, he makes me feel that I am his ONLY patient! Dr. Shui goes above and beyond to understand my medical history and he always provides me knowledgeable responses to any questions that I may have.

No problem with her or Maxwell. BUTTTTTT, NO ONE returned my call to the Cardiac folks Tuesday morning after I called and left a message saying they need only leave me voicemail with date and time when they can see me, and I'll be there. I CANNOT ANSWER THE PHONE WHILE I'M DRIVING: GROUNDS FOR DISMISSAL. I can call back at break times whenever they are directed. I am very upset that I waited to hear from Cardio whatever: I COULD be carrying around something serious though I don't think so, but since when does it take them more than four days to return a call TO A POSSIBLE CARDIAC PATIENT? I missed a specially planned weekend with my brother upstate... hoping to see the Cariologist first. Not remotely funny, or excusable, or professional. Please copy this to my doctor, Srinivasa Palnati. Thank you.
