        "text": "As told in Bletchley at War, Volume 1, discontent amongst elements of the code breaking staff had caused a number of the personnel to meet at the Shoulder of Mutton, in Bletchley, and compose a letter stating their grievances. This was duly delivered to No. 10, Downing Street, and not surprisingly the intelligence hierarchy was far from pleased when news arrived of this unauthorised action. Nevertheless, all the needs were rapidly met but within a few weeks discontent again began to stir, and the head of the Secret Service appointed an independent investigator, General K. Martin, a former deputy director of military intelligence, to get to the root of the problem. With his report complete by February, 1942 ruthless measures followed, and indeed the director of G.C.&C.S. was replaced by an ex-naval commander. He was given the title of Director General of the Government Communications Headquarters, as the new name for the organisation, and from thereon the dissension diminished. In fact apart from being the venue for the initial meeting that caused this change, the Shoulder of Mutton also accommodated throughout the war two of the key personnel engaged at Bletchley Park, who were admirably looked after by the amiable landlady, Mrs. Bowden. Originally from Torquay, she had met her future husband - a butler - whilst in domestic service, and shortly after their marriage in 1907 the couple moved to Bletchley where, with an interesting association with Bletchley Park, they would be employed for ten years by Sir Herbert Leon.\n\nBletchley Park had by now become established as an essential part of the war effort, and of the staff employed, the W.R.N.S. contingent, (known as H.M.S. Pembroke V from December 1942), had first arrived on March 24th, 1941 in ‘civvies’, since the factory making the uniforms had been bombed. As the code breaking operations expanded, so the question of accommodation for the increasing number of personnel accordingly assumed an ongoing urgency and in February, 1942, as a possible solution Peter Loxley, the Private Secretary to the Permanent Secretary of State at the Foreign Office, discussed with the relevant authorities the possibility of immediately taking over Woburn Abbey. However, for the meanwhile this was deemed impractical.\n\nBy September, 1941 the German army signals had been more extensively understood, and regular decrypts became available from April, 1942. However, regarding the naval intelligence matters were less euphoric following the introduction in February of a separate Enigma key - the so called 4 rotor Enigma - which, as implied by the name, used four thinner wheels, in place of the previous three. This code was known by the British as ‘Shark’, and by the Germans as ‘Triton’, and with little progress made into breaking the code the U Boat crisis was further compounded when on April 23rd the first ‘milch cow’, U459, delivered fuel and supplies to U boats at sea, so enabling them to double their operational range. Even worse, the Germans had broken British Naval Cypher 3, and throughout 1942 would be able to read the instructions relayed to convoys. Indeed, the loss of merchant shipping became so critical that Whitehall directed an urgent plea to Bletchley Park, asking them to concentrate, as a matter of absolute priority, on the U Boat code. In fact there was an imminent danger that losses of merchant ships and men could not be replaced, and such was the havoc being wreaked by the 249 U Boats that from a figure of 327,000 tons of shipping sunk in January, the statistic for November was 721,000.\n\nAs told in the book ‘Bletchley Park’s Secret Sisters’, even the ‘black’ propaganda organisation, operating from premises in the countryside near to Bletchley Park, was asked to assist, and in response began a new and specific ‘black broadcast’ radio station, aimed especially at the U Boat crews. Yet in some respects more substantial progress was being made, and when in August, 1942 the staff in Hut 8 at Bletchley Park discovered the key of the German Mediterranean surface fleet, through consequent action by the British Field Marshal Rommel began to lose almost a quarter of his supplies, being sent to North Africa via the Mediterranean. In a further cause for optimism, Hut 6 was now regularly breaking the ‘Chaffinch’ key of the German army in Africa, and since this revealed the nature of their cargo, enemy ships could now be selectively sunk.\n\nMonitoring the German wireless signals, five widely spaced interception sites provided the raw data for Bletchley Park, and the most important became that of the R.A.F. ‘Y’ service at Chicksands Priory, Bedfordshire, which had been slightly damaged by bombing in 1940. Equipped with ultra sensitive aerials, the site lay conveniently near to the R.A.F. Radio Communications School at R.A.F. Henlow, and from August W.A.A.F.s became part of the personnel.\n\nAt Bletchley Park, in September the Japanese Section, which comprised a staff of about 40, under Hugh Foss, moved the short distance from ‘Elmers’, a former school, to firstly a new building in Bletchley Park, and then later to Hut 7. Yet despite the code breaking achievements of the British, the situation could have been catastrophic when on September 11th the Germans captured a Royal Navy gunboat, aboard which documents and charts contained information that could have only been revealed by Ultra. Fortunately the Germans missed the significance, and took no action.\n\nAs further good fortune, changes to the convoy code had now eased the losses of merchant shipping, and in addition on October 30th, 1942, off Port Said H.M.S. Petard had disabled U559, commanded by Kptlt. Hans Heidtmann. This enabled the recovery of not only the four rotor Enigma but also invaluable documents, although the mission was not without cost, for two of the naval personnel tragically died in the endeavour. In continuing progress, efforts to speed up the code breaking process would now lead to the investigation of electronic valves as a means to replace the slower mechanical relays, and this was a move that would eventually found the development of the first programmable electronic computers.\n\nBy now Bletchley Park was reading some 4,000 German decrypts a day, plus a lesser number of Italian and Japanese, and from December 13th decrypted messages regarding U boat activity became available. This lead to a corresponding and noticeable reduction in the number of Allied vessels being sunk, but this was fortunately attributed by the Germans to information obtained by a spy-ring operating at the U Boat bases in Occupied France. Yet although there was no spy-ring at the U boat bases, there was a Soviet spy operating at Bletchley Park, for during the year - clad in the uniform of an army staff captain - the Glaswegian John Cairncross came to work as an editor in Hut 3, dealing with air intelligence intercepts. In fact he would then stay at Bletchley Park until the summer of 1943, when transferred to a position in MI6. Having been admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, in October, 1934, Cairncross would be taught by Anthony Blunt, who perhaps with a practised eye soon appreciated his ‘potential’ for treachery. In fact Blunt also had subversive dealings with another Cambridge graduate, Leo Long, who was employed as an officer in M114, the German section of the Directorate of Military Intelligence. Mainly he would deal with assessments of the strength and organisation of the German army, whilst subsections of the department monitored enemy intelligence. The offices were accommodated in a bomb proof basement in Central London, and here teleprinters constantly chattered out the information arriving from the Bletchley Park code breakers. This then formed the basis of the information passed by Long to Blunt, at meetings arranged in snack bars or pubs.\n\nApart from the Enigma traffic, the code breakers at Bletchley Park also had to contend with the signals of Hitler’s High Command which, using a machine known as the ‘Secret Writer’, or ‘Fish’, as the name applied by Bletchley Park, employed a more complex means of encipherment. The existence of the coding machine had first been revealed to G.C.&C.S. by the Secret Intelligence Service and, under a team headed by Max Newman, after an initial break made during the previous year, in December, 1942 orders were given to begin intensive research into means of breaking the code. The extremely advanced machinery necessary to deal with the problem would be subsequently manufactured, and in the methods to mechanise and automate this analysis Alan Turing became instrumental. Given Turing’s eccentric ways, perhaps it was therefore not surprisingly that the Wrens tasked to operate the apparatus would soon refer to the machine as ‘Robinson’, after the eccentric inventor, Heath Robinson.\n\nTowards the end of 1942 the continuing decrypts of the air force Enigma disclosed that various German air force units had returned to France, and with the formation of bomber groups this anticipated the re-launch of air attacks against Britain from January, 1943. In fact the campaign would last for the first half of that year but more optimistically the decrypted intelligence also revealed the difficulties that were now beginning to affect the Luftwaffe, especially a shortage of manpower.\n\nHowever, this was unfortunately a fate that would also befall the Bletchley code breakers, for on February 27th, 1943, the death occurred of Alfred Dilwyn Knox, the country’s chief cryptographer. He and his team of about 15 women occupied a brick building which, having possibly once been a coachman’s house, backed onto Elmers, and in one of their achievements in March, 1941 the team had broken a message of the Italian naval code which read ‘Today’s the day minus three.’ In subsequent decrypts a plan to ambush British convoys from Egypt to Greece was revealed, and the information from the code breakers duly allowed the Mediterranean Fleet to take the Italians by surprise, and sink three heavy cruisers and two destroyers at the Battle of Matapan.\n\nIn 1915 Alfred, the son of the Bishop of Manchester, had joined the staff of ‘Room 40’, where during World War One selected personnel at the Admiralty Old Building were engaged on the breaking of German codes. In fact they achieved great success, and even deciphered the Zimmermann telegram, which crucially brought America into the war. Alfred developed his cryptographic talents by the somewhat unorthodox technique of contemplating complex problems whilst lying in a bath, swathed in the essential swirl of ‘soap and steam’, and possibly Miss Olive Roddam, his secretary, also found the atmosphere steamy, for they were married soon after the war. When World War Two broke out, Alfred then again indulged his watery eccentricities and oblivious to everything nearly flooded the bathroom at his Bletchley lodgings! Despite Alfred’s untimely death, the code breaking at Bletchley Park continued and as his successor, Alan Turing would now shoulder the burdens. However, the pressures would be somewhat lessened when from decrypts of the U Boat traffic it was realised that the convoy code was insecure, with it then being discontinued from June, 1943.\n\nWith the ongoing need to accommodate the thousands of people now employed at Bletchley Park, already Walton Hall, Crawley Grange, Wavendon House, Gayhurst Manor, and Crawley Rectory had been requisitioned but despite the remoteness of these rural locations, most still occasionally suffered the disconcerting attention of stray enemy bombs, with one instance being that of a device which fell through a hayrick at Fenhill Farm, Wavendon, but failed to explode. Bombs would also fall in the vicinity of Woburn Abbey, where from July members of the W.R.N.S. would now be billeted. Whilst the conditions of their accommodation left much to be desired, at least the personnel could appreciate the stately grandeur, although the heritage proved less appealing at night, whenever the girls patrolled the eerie passages when detailed for fire watching duties. In fact one girl declared that she had even seen a shadowy figure pass through a window from the monk’s graveyard! As for more earthly mysteries, breaking the fundamentals of the ‘Secret Writer’ code now seemed possible using ‘Robinson’, and permission was granted to design and produce a more efficient machine at the Post Office Research Centre. With the engineering team lead by ‘Tommy’ Flowers, in the interests of speed his was the idea to employ a multitude of thyratron valves, instead of mechanical relays, and the consequent problem of reliability was solved by leaving the valves constantly switched on. Valves, however, were in short supply for as the Chairman of Radio Rentals had said, ‘the demand for our service is, of course, far beyond anything with which we can cope’, but despite all the obstacles, in 1943 Hut F at Bletchley Park became home to the world’s first electronic computer, Colossus Mark 1. Rather interestingly, apart from the code breaking capabilities the machine had the added advantage that because of the heat generated by the valves, when conditions became unbearable some of the W.R.N.S. operators stripped down to bra and briefs to continue working!\n\nLater in the year, many personnel were transferred to ‘RA.F. Church Green’, a new camp adjoining Bletchley Park, and Ultra now assumed an even greater importance gleaning intelligence regarding Hitler’s secret ‘V’ weapon programme which, lessening the need for manned bombers, intended to wreak devastation by means of high explosive or Sarin nerve gas. However, the secret of Bletchley Park could have been compromised when on January 5th, 1944 the Abwehr captured Colonel Bertrand, the French Intelligence Chief, who, from a secret base in a remote French chateau, had furnished Bletchley Park with much intelligence, gathered mainly from line taps on the main telephone routes to Berlin. He was arrested at the Basilica Sacre Coeur during a rendezvous with an agent to collect a radio set, but fortunately he made a ‘deal’ with his captors, and escaping with his wife was eventually flown out of Occupied Territory by the British in a Lysander 3 aircraft.\n\nIn preparation for the D Day landings, in January, 1944, a programme of modernisation and expansion began at Bletchley Park, and by now two main ‘Fish’ exchanges were known to the British - one for the eastern, and one for the western front. Ten additional and improved models of Colossus were duly ordered by the Government and being ready just before D Day the first, Colossus Mark 11, enabled the ‘Jellyfish’ cipher to be read between the German Supreme Headquarters and the headquarters of the German commander in chief in the west, Von Runstedt. So began a spectacularly successful code breaking operation, which thereon drew the best talent not only from the other huts but also from the mathematical world. Indeed, information decoded by Bletchley Park proved essential in tracking the movement of German mine laying ships, and thus the Allies were able to effectively clear the Channel, and so lose only one ship of the Invasion fleet to enemy mines on D Day.\n\nAs for Alan Turing, with his invaluable contribution now having been made, he became increasingly involved with Hanslope Park, and in the late summer of 1944 he gave up his lodgings with Mrs. Ramshaw, at Shenley Brook End, and transferred to a room on the top floor of the mansion at Hanslope, later moving to a cottage in the walled kitchen garden. Via a large antenna near Eindhoven the Germans were routinely monitoring ‘scrambler’ telephone calls across the Atlantic, and at Hanslope Turing’s task was to now begin work on a speech encipherment system, appropriately known - in perhaps more ways than one - as ‘Delilah’, the deceiver of men.\n\nMeanwhile, at Bletchley Park the urgent activities had prompted the requisition in August of Stockgrove Park as additional accommodation for the W.R.N.S., and the following month an office known as NID 12A was then set up at the Operational Intelligence Centre at the Admiralty, London, to improve co-ordination between the Admiralty and the code breakers.\n\nIn November since the civilian café was now unable to continue supplying meals for Service personnel, it was decided to open a W.R.N.S. café at Bletchley Park which, staffed by W.R.N.S. officers, cooks, and stewards, would provide meals for all the Naval personnel. Ongoing since 1941, hopefully the complaints would therefore come to an end regarding ‘a smoke nuisance’ from the chimney of a canteen belonging to ‘a Government Department’, and although there had been a temporary abatement of the trouble following informal representations to the engineer in charge of the stoking plant, nevertheless ‘the matter is being further pressed.’\n\nThe New Year now offered those youngsters completing their education various opportunities for employment, perhaps for a girl aged 14 to 16 as a drapery assistant at A. G. Cowlishaw, of Aylesbury Street, or a ‘keen youth’, aged 14 to 17, for radio servicing work, and accumulator charging, at Weatherhead’s, of 73, Bletchley Road. Meanwhile, the railway could provide clerical vacancies for several boys ‘of good education’, aged 14½ to 17½ , and the London Central Meat Co., in Bletchley Road, needed a smart youth, or lady, as an assistant.\n\nAs for those youngsters continuing their education, at the re-opening of the Bletchley Road Senior School on Tuesday, January 6th the times of assembly and dismissal had been altered ‘to assist in combating Black-out conditions’, and in the mornings assembly would now be at 9.15a.m., dismissal at 12.15p.m., with afternoon assembly at 1.45p.m. and dismissal 3.45p.m. However, regarding arrangements for the new time table, these had to be cancelled, since three of the teachers had left, or were otherwise absent. Soon new charges for the Senior School canteen would be introduced, costed at 1s 8d for the first child of a family, 1s 3d for the second, and 10d for any others, and as a further inconvenience heavy snowfalls, and the associated disorganisation of the railways and school buses, meant that for both pupils and staff, attendance would become invariably erratic during the following days. However, with the Secondary School Entrance Exam Schedules having been forwarded on January 9th, 67 pupils would still take the practice exam at 10a.m. on February 5th - despite the absence of 17 candidates - and with the actual exam undertaken on March 20th, this would mark the occasion for a school holiday except, of course, for those pupils sitting the papers!\n\nMeanwhile, progress was ongoing at the Spurgeon Memorial Baptist Hall nursery school where, aged between two and three quarters and four and a half, 18 ‘fresh’ children were presently attending, whilst, elsewhere, the Bletchley Road Junior School had reopened at 9.15a.m. on Tuesday, January 6th, and apart from Miss Milsom, who was away through illness, all the staff reported for duty. With Mr. William Crisp as the headmaster, Miss Bonham would hold charge of Class 1, Mr. Walter, Class 2, Miss Wing, Class 3, Mrs. Swain, Class IV, Miss Capell, Class V, Miss Fowler, Class VI, Miss Clark, Class VII, and Mrs. Jones, Class VIII.\n\nProving a great success, a Reading Room at the Senior School opened on February 3rd, and apart from an educational purpose, the Bletchley Road School also provided a venue for various entertainments including, on Friday, February 6th an 8p.m. dance at the Senior Schools. Under the personal direction of Reg Heckford, in aid of Dr. Barnardo’s Homes ‘The Five Rhythmists’ provided the music but, of more intellectual pursuits, a Bletchley Brains Trust, arranged on the format of the B.B.C. programme, then occupied the platform one Tuesday evening at the Baptist Young People’s Fellowship meeting. The question master, Mr. E. Staniford, firstly gave a potted biography of each team member, and amongst the many questions were included gems such as ‘Is psychology science or Tommy-rot?’ and ‘Why is the 4.40 from Wolverton always late?’!\n\nWith the wintry weather continuing, many children were now absent through illness, as were also several teachers, and at the Bletchley Road Senior School the problem became potentially compounded when, from the Secretary of Education, the headmaster received instructions that either Miss Dorothy Robinson, or Miss Alice Townsend, the L.C.C. teachers, would be transferred to another school. Following a meeting at the Education Office, Aylesbury, on talking over the matter the proposal was then supposedly abandoned, yet on April 1st Miss Robinson, who lived at 65, Eaton Avenue, would nevertheless be transferred to the L.C.C. Junior School, with her position at the Senior School remaining unfilled.\n\nFor whatever reasons, some children found attending class a traumatic experience and, towards the end of February, one Tuesday morning Jean Ward, aged 13, left her home at 38, Saffron Street to go to school, but had not been seen since. The mystery then deepened when, the following morning, her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Bedford, with whom she had been staying, received a telegram despatched from Stony Stratford, which contained the message ‘Don't Worry. Jean.’ Subsequent sightings of Jean were reported at transport cafes in Potterspury and Towcester, and it later transpired that, unable to face attending school, she had walked to Stony Stratford and hitched a lift to Northampton station. With her destination being the home of her grandmother, in Peterborough, having only a penny in her possession she had been given the remainder of the fare by a fellow passenger on the bus, and Jean’s grandmother then finally resolved the anxieties by sending a letter, stating that the girl had arrived safe and well.\n\nWith the Education Committee seeking approval for the recent awards of the Burnham Committee, at a lengthy meeting of the Council, at the end of February teachers’ salaries became a subject of discussion. This was in respect of the war allowances for teachers, which were to date from April 1st, 1941, and although, for the Finance Committee, Mr. R. Hazell said that he was ‘morally obliged’ to accept the Burnham Award, the Committee felt that since there might be unfortunate comparisons with the war bonuses for the rest of the staff, they could not go as far back as that. He therefore recommended the date of January 1st, 1942, and with the original scheme consequently rejected by 21 votes to 33, the recommendation of the Finance Committee was accepted. Thereby, the increases would date from January 1942, being £26p.a. for men on salaries up to £262 10s, and £13p.a. on salaries exceeding that, and up to £525. As for women - it being ordained during the year that, unless they undertook teaching, they could not remain at University - the corresponding rise would be £19 10s and £10 6s. Yet towards the end of May, the Bucks County Council would then reverse the decision, and instead agree to adopt the full Burnham Award, as dated from April 1st, 1941!\n\nAiding the war effort, children of Bletchley Road Senior School now began a salvage drive, and the main part of the town being divided into groups, each group would appoint an ‘official collector’. Having been approved by the school parliament, the scheme was rapidly put into action by the school captain, Alan Kay, with sacks then obtained from the U.D.C. offices. Also assisting the war effort, boys aged between 14 and 17 were required as messengers in the A.R.P. Service, and, stating if they owned a cycle, or could ride a motorcycle, candidates were invited to apply to the Council Offices. The industrious pupils of the Bletchley Road Senior School were again active from Tuesday, March 17th to Thursday, March 19th when, raising over £100, at 7.15p.m. they staged a concert in the Hall. A third of the proceeds were applied for ‘Warship Week’, and the remainder would help ‘to secure educational amenities not provided for by the County authorities.’ Also in the Senior School Hall, arranged by the Parents Association, a Saturday dance then raised £23 for the Help For Russia Fund, the Modernist Dance Band from Buckingham providing their services free of charge.\n\nContinuing until April 14th, the Easter school holiday commenced on April 1st, although shortly afterwards one of the Junior School teachers would be absent with blood poisoning. A few weeks later a further absence then occurred, although this time with official blessing, when on June 9th Miss Fowler was given leave to attend the Education Authorities conference on Russia.\n\nThroughout the town, various entertainments helped to maintain the general morale, and with music provided by the Melody Makers Band, a dance held in the Bletchley Road Senior School Hall, on Saturday, April 11th aimed to raise money for both the Junior and Senior Schools. The staff combined to help with the refreshments, and, including a junior competition, under the auspices of the Educational Committee of the Bletchley & District Co-op, for the young and old of the town instructive pursuits were offered when, from 3p.m. to 8p.m., the Bletchley Artists Group Exhibition took place on April 24th, 25th and 26th. Opened at the Co-op Hall, Albert Street, by Mr. J. Goodwin, Chairman of the Education Committee, and President of the Society, the display contained around 150 paintings, drawings and poster work, and examples were included by Mr. L. A. Grainger-Cox, sketches by Mr. A. Perry, (who in normal employment was a ticket collector at Bletchley Station), and an interesting painting of St. Martin’s church, dated around 1813, on loan from Mr. A. Duffield. In addition, members of 456 A.T.C. Bletchley Squadron displayed detailed scale models of aircraft, and, with admission being by programme - priced 6d - the proceeds of £21 were duly applied for the local Red Cross weekly fund.\n\nBy now the ‘Registration of Boys’ and Girls’ Order 1941’ had come into force, and perhaps helped to quell such annoyances wrought by rebellious youth as the damage caused to the Pavilion, on the Albert Street football ground. Following a complete renovation by the Bletchley Youth Committee, this proved of especial frustration, and it was possibly just as well that several local residents now possessed an understanding of human psychology, gained through their completion of the first year of a three year course given by Mr. A. L. Gordon Mackay, M.A., M.Econ., M.Lit. In fact, despite having to travel each time from Oxford, he had missed only one occasion, and, ending on Thursday, April 2nd the lectures had been arranged by the Bletchley Tutorial Class, under the Workers Educational Association. Founded in 1904 by, amongst others, Albert Mansbridge, this organisation intended ‘to assist the co-ordination and expansion of the contemporary voluntary means for adult education’, and, under the direction of Mr. W. Williams, during World War Two, from August, 1941 a programme of weekly compulsory briefing sessions were held, of the Army Bureau of Current Affairs. As a welcome departure from military routine, at these servicemen were encouraged to discuss post war problems, with the lecturers, (as also booklets entitled ‘Current Affairs’), being supplied by the W.E.A.\n\nAs for nourishing the body, as opposed to the mind, at the end of March a request was refused by Bucks. Education Committee from B.U.D.C., to give up land adjoining the Senior School for allotments, and they instead decreed that the crops would be grown for use in the school canteens. Indeed, in a letter of March 31st from D.E. Cooke, the Secretary for Education for the Bucks. County Education Committee, replying to the Council’s request he emphasised that it ‘is used as an essential part of the Scheme for rural instruction in the north of the County and cannot be spared from this Scheme, without upsetting the balance very considerably.’ However, a considerable part would be used to increase the potato supply for the school canteen, and arrangements for ploughing on behalf of the school were being directly made with Mr. Johnson, the Chairman of the Council’s War-time Domestic Food Production Committee.\n\nAs the year progressed, apart from the issue on May 11th of instructions to the teachers, that each day gas mask drill should be taken immediately after prayers, the realities of war became tragically apparent when news arrived regarding several ex pupils of Bletchley Road Senior School. They, following the fall of Singapore, were now posted as missing in Malaya, and amongst the number was Gunner Geoffrey Chew, aged 22, of 21, Aylesbury Street who, having previously as his first job worked at the local Sketchley branch, had joined the Royal Artillery two years ago. He joined up with Gunner Ronald Bowler, aged 24, of 3, Manor Road, formerly a lorry driver at the London Road garage, whilst Gunner Ronald White, of 164, Simpson Road, had also joined the Royal Artillery two years ago. As for Gunner Douglas Cresswell, aged 24, of 72, Victoria Road, he enlisted in 1939, from a previous employment at the brickyard.\n\nOf more local immediate concern was the danger of the crossing at Trees Square, in Old Bletchley. This was extensively used by about 30 children from two schools, and since a car had only a few days before knocked down a five and a half year old girl, the police were now asked to carry out point duty at midday, and also during those afternoon periods when the schools closed. Again on safety matters, the Highways Committee reported that, as a wartime measure, to help the schoolchildren the double doors erected on the boundary fence of the Social Centre swung outwards, onto the footpath to the Leon Rec. However, in fastening the doors those concerned were told that they must accept responsibility, and liability, for any accident that befell either passers by or the schoolchildren, and it was also suggested that at the end of hostilities the owners should be asked to pay ‘way leave’, of 1s p.a., for using the doors, which would be altered to swing inwards. Then, in a further measure occasioned by the wartime conditions, despite the salvage drives it was now decided to leave the cast iron main gates of the school in place, so forming a barrier to prevent the children from running into the road.\n\nDuring the previous April, the schoolchildren of Bletchley Road Senior School had adopted the vessel ‘S.S. Chelwood’, not so much as a wartime measure but more as ‘a means of making textbook geography brighter and more realistic.’ The ship being presently engaged on coastal trips, during May members of the crew then wrote to the pupils describing their work, and the places they visited, and, in return, the pupils supplied knitted woollens and collected magazines and books. Amongst the crew they unsurprisingly had their own ‘heroes’, and no doubt these especially included the two gunners who received official awards for their part, the previous December, in destroying an enemy bomber. A few weeks later the captain and crew then presented the pupils with the case of a shell used in this action, and also a cup inscribed ‘To the pupils of Bletchley Road Senior School, from the crew of SS Chelwood’. Suitably termed the Chelwood Cup, this - to be competed for by the various houses of the school - would then be presented on Friday, June 19th on behalf of the ship by Mr. E. Cook, the headmaster. Also assisting members of the Forces, at Old Bletchley, St. Mary’s School raised £12 for the Overseas League Tobacco Fund by holding, one Tuesday, a social evening and competition, which included novelty games organised by the Scouts and Cubs of the Old Bletchley Group. A short musical programme had been arranged by the headmistress, Mrs. Bailey, with the community singing lead by the children.\n\nDuring the Whitsun holiday, which commenced May 22nd, amongst several premises in the town both the Bletchley Road Infants School and the evacuated school, on the Bletchley Park estate, were broken into. Locks having been broken, and money and keys stolen, at one of the schools across the blackboard a thief had scrawled ‘Why don’t you leave some money in this dump?’, and the thefts were not discovered until Monday, when the teachers found themselves unable to unlock their desks. Money, collected during the previous three weeks by the children, had been emptied from a Red Cross box at the Bletchley Road Infants School, and, containing £22 10s, on Wednesday, June 3rd a handbag belonging to Miss Burnham, a mistress at the Senior School, was stolen from an unattended classroom. As an outlet for the frustrations of disaffected youth, especially for recreational evenings it was therefore perhaps just as well that the reconditioned sports ground in Albert Street was now being used by youth organisations, and pleasingly the training evenings on the field attracted a good attendance. Even Saturday dances were included amongst the activities, with a dancing class started by Miss M. Brooks, one of the officers of the Central Council of Recreative Physical Training.\n\nAt the beginning of June, with entries to be less than 500 words, the Education Committee of the Bletchley & District Co-op announced an Essay Competition on ‘The Development of the Co-operation in our District.’ A first prize of £1 1s would be awarded, with further prizes of 10s 6d for each entry published, and contributions had to be sent to the Secretary, Mrs. Caldwell, of 84, Duncombe Street, by the closing date of August 1st. Perhaps the prize winners might then care to invest their money in the National Savings Association, a mobile cinema van of which would visit the Bletchley Road Senior School on June 10th, with the pupils to be shown films ‘of topical interest’.\n\nAt the fifth annual meeting of the Bletchley Road School Parents’ Association, on Thursday, June 4th the Deputy Secretary, Mr. H. Jones, reported that with a microphone installed, every classroom had now been connected to the radio. The membership of the Association having risen since the previous year from 45 to 145, with the Junior School given £19 3s 6d, and the Senior School £37 6s 11d, Mr. W. Crisp, as the President of the Sports Association, announced a current balance of £71, and to increase this reserve by continuing the entertainments was now his stated intention. Indeed, associated with the British Puppet & Model Theatre Guild, concerts were then performed by Bletchley Road Junior School at 7.15p.m. on Monday, June 29th, Tuesday, June 30th and Thursday, July 2nd, and apart from a musical selection performed by the percussion band, a display of P.T. was also given. At the end of the entertainments, having written the plays with Miss E. Clark, to terrific applause Mr. Crisp was then presented with an electric table lamp and a bouquet of flowers, and, acknowledging this recognition, he recalled that by spending 12 years in a slum school in Birmingham, his had been the finest training possible for a teacher. As a further accolade, an appreciative visit had been made on June 30th by Miss Ford, an H.M. Inspector, and Mr. Higg, the Board of Education Inspector, and as continuing good news, the following day a school holiday took place, awarded by the Managers for the excellence of the Secondary Schools Entrance Exam results. 14 pupils had been awarded Special Places, and five qualified for fee paying places.\n\nFollowing an illness, Miss Workman had now returned to her duties after a five week absence from the town, only to find that, following an inspection of the Eaton Avenue allotments by representatives of the Wartime Allotments Committee, she had been sent a letter by the Clerk of Council. This observed ‘that the bottom end of your private garden adjoining such allotments was overgrown with weeds’, and the Clerk had been directed to write ‘to ask that you could make early arrangements for this portion of your garden to be mown. If these weeds are allowed to seed considerable trouble will be caused to the nearby allotment holders.’ Suitably repentant, on July 8th - on Bucks. County Education Committee notepaper - Miss Workman duly mentioned her recent absence and, although ‘the man who does the garden for me has been ill too’, she hoped that by the end of the week the mowing would be complete.\n\nAt a meeting of the Council on July 14th Oliver Wells moved a motion which, being seconded and carried, stated ‘That having regard to the fact that in the past children in the urban district have been denied the right to higher education owing to the poverty of their parents, this Council hereby agrees to make grants in the future in cases which they deem suitable for assistance under the powers conferred by the Education Act, 1921.’ However, a stipulation would be included that the Clerk could not spend a sum exceeding the product of a penny rate. Continuing education was also the theme when the Bucks. County Education Committee advertised for a girl probationer, to generally assist with the work of the nursery class at the Spurgeon Hall. The situation would carry a salary of up to £1 a week, dependent on age, but due to a shortage of teachers in London, during the month Miss D. Robinson, specialising in dramatic art, returned to the Capital, as well as Miss Townsend. With the termination on July 17th of Miss Townsend’s position at the Bletchley Road Senior School, the vacancy was then filled on July 24th by the appointment of Wilfred Rose, who lived at Milton Keynes village.\n\nRepresenting every youth organisation in the town, in the presence of 200 boys and girls Alderman J. Tarver, Chairman of the Bucks. Education Committee, had opened the Service of Youth Sports Ground on Saturday, July 11th and on the afternoon of July 30th the Bletchley Road Senior School held their annual sports on the playing field. Arranged in the four houses, the school paraded to the ground under the supervision of the teachers and, organised by the Sports Master Mr. A. Jones, and the Games Mistress, Miss E. Dove, the event proved a great success, with the finals being played the following day ‘in lovely weather.’\n\nOn the occasion of the repeated win of the Lady Leon Shield, on August 4th at Bletchley Road Senior School, Mr. S. Taylor, headmaster of the L.C.C. evacuated Senior School, presented a trophy to the two captains of Milton House. However, regarding other ‘athletic’ pursuits, these were causing some disquiet, and letters had been sent to the headmaster, and school managers, of the London schools, expressing concern about children hanging onto the iron supports of shop blinds, and rolling balls down the awnings! Yet otherwise the schoolchildren seemed industrious and well behaved and, on August 6th, to witness a performance of percussion band and puppetry, Mrs. J. Martin, an assistant mistress at Adstock Council School, paid a visit to the Bletchley Road Junior School - in fact only a few days after a similar visit by the headmistress of a school at Slough. On August 13th 45 pupils, and three teachers, from the Bletchley Road Senior School then travelled to London, to watch an open air performance in Regents Park of a Midsummer Nights Dream, and a few days later a further 21 pupils, and two teachers, would also attend the production.\n\nThe Council now considered three applications for assistance under the Education Act of 1921, although it was resolved that the matter should be considered at a future special meeting. In the meantime, to obtain information on the points variously raised in the discussion, the Clerk would communicate with the Secretary for Education, and Bucks. County Council.\n\nOn Friday, August 14th the local schools then closed for a five week holiday, but the children would still retain the use of the buildings for games and outdoor activities, and other children would help out on local farms. However, one schoolboy working at the Bletchley Road School farm suffered a rather unfortunate mishap, when he left his new coat on the wall of a pigsty. On his return, he found that the pigs had eaten it, whereupon his schoolmates pooled together to buy him another!\n\nHardly an experience that endeared him to animals, for whom, however, one Bletchley resident held an undoubted affection. He was the well known animal painter Mr. H. Sellen who, following the many requests received after the recent art exhibition in the Co-op Hall, had now agreed to the tutorship of the Art Class, inaugurated by the Bletchley & District Co-op Society Education Committee. Enrolment would take place in the Co-op Hall, Albert Street, at 7.15p.m. on Monday, August 17th.\n\nIn late August, as a ‘Harvest Camp School’, Bletchley Road Senior School became a temporary hostel for 50 Finchley Grammar School boys, aged between 15 and 18. ‘On loan’ to neighbouring farmers, for two weeks they cycled out each morning to farms within a five mile radius, but for 12 boys aged 12 to 14 they were deemed too young for farmwork, and were instead kept busy in the kitchen. As for the general welfare of the boys, with the assistance of local helpers five masters and a mistress were engaged arranging various games and outings, and, for those pupils who wished to attend, the Education Authority allowed the Junior School to remain open during the holiday. However, on September 11th, due to a disappointing attendance the Secretary of Education then agreed, by telephone, that it would not be necessary for all the staff to remain on duty the following week. They would still report each day, but those who were not required would be sent home. As for Miss Fowler, she had been instructed to report to the Far Bletchley school for a fortnight.\n\nSadly at this period a well respected former school teacher died, aged 86, at Newport Pagnell. She was Mrs. Maria Fry who, having taught at Old Bletchley Infants school, after her marriage then opened a private school in Church Street, which she continued into her old age. Longevity was also the theme when the Baptists now celebrated the Jubilee of their present church building, which proved the occasion to launch an ambitious scheme for new school premises which, to be commenced after the war, would cost an estimated £5000.\n\nThe London evacuees had arrived in Bletchley some two and a half years ago, and among the teaching staff was Mr. S. Taylor, headmaster of the Senior School who, on the very same day, had qualified for retirement! Instead he travelled to Bletchley with the school and, known to all the pupils as ‘Dad’, was, with four masters, including Mr. Jackson, who would become the Head at Mr. Taylor’s eventual retirement, still working for the pupils in their new accommodation at the Park Pavilion. Once settled at Bletchley it seemed that the boys quarrelled less than they did in London, and, assuming an air of responsibility, the older boys tended to now look after and mentor the younger ones. During school time the boys were permitted to work for 20½ days on local farms, and they were also allowed to tend the mostly communal allotments. Cultivating the ground, they sold the produce to their foster parents, and the profits were then spent on seeds and plants for the next season. Those pupils who showed an especial keenness were awarded a plot of their own and, billeted on a farm, one enterprising lad even kept rabbits, which he then sold in the market. Not surprisingly his patch was always ‘covered with green stuff’! In their endeavours the boys proved extremely ingenious, even fashioning a wheelbarrow from a broken school desk, and the rim of an old car wheel, found on a rubbish tip, whilst as for weed cutting, a long curved branch, and a rusty but well sharpened piece of metal - salvaged from the dump - sufficed as a scythe. With the machines and tools acquired through public subscription, the school also provided a shoe mending service to all the evacuees, at a cost to the children that ranged from 1s to nothing, according to the means of the parents, and 450 pairs of footwear had thus been so far repaired\n\nFor a summer holiday, many former evacuees, now working in London, had returned to Bletchley, whilst as for the residents, towards the end of September the art class of the Bletchley Co-op Society Education Committee made a good start one Tuesday, when, including several members of the Forces, under the tutorship of Mr. Sellen 23 pupils were enrolled for a seven month course. For the sum of 2s 6d, or 5s, depending on the student’s age, they were provided with drawing equipment, and pencils and paper could also be purchased ‘at cost’. Elsewhere, given by Mr. A. Gordon Mackay, M.A, M.Econ., M.Litt., from October 1st the Workers’ Educational Association then commenced the second year tutorial class in psychology which, held, at 7.30p.m. in the Senior School, in fact became so large in its previous form, that a division would need to be made, with separate lectures provided for those who had not taken the first year course.\n\nWith Miss Edith Ford, H.M.I., as the chief guest, and Mr. Tarver, J.P., chairman of the Bucks. County Education Committee, occupying the chair, including the heads of all the L.C.C. evacuated schools there were many distinguished persons present on October 20th, when the annual speech day and prize distribution was held at the Bletchley Road Senior School. Miss C. Morris, of 32, Tavistock Street, being the secretary, this was arranged by the W.E.A. Bletchley Branch, and the School would also accommodate a series of 12 lectures in economics. As for other pursuits, on Mondays, from October 26th at 8p.m. ‘Appreciation of Music’ would be held under the tutorship of Miss J. Chissell, A.R.C.M., G.R.S.M., and on the same day, economics would initially take place at 7.30p.m. With additional sessions proposed in Literature and Philosophy, classes in psychology and social reconstruction would also be forthcoming, and further information could be obtained from Miss H. Page, at the Clinic.\n\nThe schools reopened from the mid term holiday on November 4th, and, early in the month anyone with an interest in forming a Poetry Reading Society was invited to contact Margery Still, at ‘Highfields’, Manor Road. In fact regarding the spoken word, Bletchley United Christian Council then announced the visit of Professor Clement Rogers, ‘famous Hyde Park Sunday Speaker, Lecturer and Author’, to St. Martin’s Hall on Friday, November 13th at 7.30pm, for a ‘Question Time in Hyde Park’.\n\nOn the day that the headmaster of the Bletchley Road Senior School, Mr. E.C. Cook, was attending an afternoon conference at Reading, there to meet Lord Woolton, the Minister of Food, via Mr. Marchant, the School Correspondent, at the Bletchley Road Junior School a telephone call was received from the Secretary for Education, instructing that, since the headmistress had been taken ill, as a temporary measure a teacher should be sent to the London Evacuated School at the Temperance Hall. Mrs. Swain was deputed to the task, but the following morning she returned with a note from the mistress in charge stating that, due to the failure of the Hall’s heating system, her duties could not be assumed until the afternoon - hopefully not an experience that caused her resignation at the end of the year.\n\nOn Tuesday, December 15th the London Senior Schools - at Bletchley Park and the Temperance Hall - combined their breaking-up party, and 83 scholars accordingly joined in a carol-singing concert. Other entertainments included the local illusionist, Bernard Brown, and amongst those present were the headmaster, Mr. Taylor, and the headmistress, Miss K. Stearns. She had originally arrived in Bletchley with the first of the evacuees in 1939 but, with the Temperance Hall School scheduled for closure from the end of the current term, during the New Year she would resume her work in London. On Wednesday, December 16th in their adopted home of St. Martin’s Hall the St. Paul’s evacuated school then presented the Nativity play ‘The Way of Bethlehem’, whilst as for the Ecclesbourne Road Infants School, accommodated in the Baptist School, they had enjoyed their Christmas celebrations on Monday week. Entertainments by Mr. Hedley - appropriately from Islington - included ventriloquism, conjuring and bubble-blowing!\n\nAttracting a large parental attendance, an exhibition of Junior School work took place in the school hall during the afternoon of December 17th, and on Friday, December 18th a one day school took place in the Bletchley Senior School Hall, for around 300 teachers from North Bucks. There they were addressed by three well-known authorities on America, and, to assist the teachers in dealing with any questions raised on this subject by the pupils, each gave a personal account of the country, and the American way of life.\n\nBy their second performance of a nativity play in St. Martin’s Hall, the children of St. Paul’s school began the New Year having raised £4 5s 2d for the Red Cross. However, a financial loss was suffered by the pupils of the Bletchley Road Senior School when, one Friday evening, it was discovered that five roller towels had been stolen, although hopefully this caused no disruption to the medical examination of the children, by Nurse Plant, on January 21st, during which, on being found to have scabies, four children were consequently excluded . As for the other children, on January 27th £18 was initially raised from an exhibition of the toys that they had made from scrap, with the money providing funds for a rubber dinghy. This would be presented to the R.A.F., and the idea had been previously conceived some months before by Gordon Horne, of Form 1A, it being announced to the school during the Christmas holidays that a competition to make the toys would be held, with the prize winners to be awarded savings stamps. On March 12th boys and girls, and members of the Parents Association, then assembled in the Senior School hall for the presentation ceremony, and the programme began with the National Anthem, followed by Kipling’s Recessional, prayers, a rendition of ‘Fierce Raged the Tempest o’er the deep’, and a scripture reading.\n\nMr. Leonard, the Deputy Secretary of Education, then introduced Squadron Leaders Benyon and Moore, who were presented with a cheque for £30 by one of the boys, Fred Beech. Following Squadron Leader Benyon’s address of the assembly came the singing of ‘England’ by the choir, and Mr. W. Brown, chairman of the managers, next gave a vote of thanks, the morning events concluding with ‘Land of our birth’, by Kipling. In the afternoon Squadron Leader Benyon lectured to each form on the construction and mechanism of a rubber dinghy, and having brought with him an example of both a five person version and a smaller type, with assistance from the N.F.S. representatives from each class were duly allowed inside, the dinghies having been set afloat on the static water tank, adjacent to the school.\n\nAlso casting afloat was Mrs. Mabel Edwards who, having taught there for 23 years, was now leaving the Church of England School at Old Bletchley. Taking with her the good wishes of the pupils and staff and, as a token of their esteem, a sum of money, she would now teach at the Bletchley Road Senior School. In fact having come to the town in 1909, following her marriage to a builder, Jesse Edward, she had taught during World War One, and could now perhaps take part in the annual Country Dance House Festival, which was held at the Bletchley Road Senior School on the afternoon on April 13th.\n\nAt the meeting of the Council on April 20th, Councillor Richardson was appointed to fill the vacancy on the Higher Education Committee, caused by the death of Councillor J. Smith, whilst on other educational matters, by now the work of child psychology was well established at the Clinic, where Dr. Dukes continued to visit once a fortnight. As for anyone who wished to read about the subject, as the County Librarian the local headmaster, Mr. William Crisp, was now the man to contact, although not between Tuesday, April 27th and Wednesday, April 28th, when the library would be closed.\n\n‘Education after the War’ was the theme for Mr. Ron Gould J.P. when, as President of the N.U.T. Bletchley and District Association, at 7.30p.m. he spoke at a public meeting in the Senior School on Thursday, May 13th. However, education during the war was more presently on the minds of the schoolchildren for, in connection with the forthcoming school camp at Little Kimble, Mr. Hawes, the Youth Organiser, paid a morning visit to the school on May 19th. As payment for the booking fees for 133 children - 72 girls and 61 boys  the following day the headmaster then forwarded a cheque for £19 19s to the Secretary of Education, and 40 boys and 40 girls would attend the camp from June 28th until July 5th, and 32 girls and 21 boys from July 5th to the 9th.\n\nPerhaps the authorities might also have wished that a few of the town’s residents could be sent away, for at a meeting in June of the Bletchley School Parents’ Association, it was revealed that, on Friday and Saturday evenings, gatecrashers were proving a problem at private dances. They not only broke windows to enter the hall, but also let others in by the side door, and ‘people arrived who only came for the modern dancing’, and had no interest in the Parents’ Association. It was therefore decided to hold gatherings mid-week for members, and devote the fourth Saturday to a public charity dance.\n\nAt a meeting on Thursday, June 3rd the Clerk of the Council submitted a letter from the Secretary for Education, B.C.C., stating that ‘Safety First’ Instruction was again a matter being brought before the teachers of Bletchley schools. Safety was also a concern when 47 children, from the Bletchley Road Senior School, were taken by the headmaster to visit the local waterworks on June 23rd where Mr. Bates, the engineer, lectured on the workings and purpose of the machinery and pumps. At least it proved a break from the school routine, and, as a further relief, on June 28th accompanied by four teachers the 40 boys and 40 girls arrived at Little Kimble for their school camp. Including visits to places of local interest, this was held as an open air school, with the main activities being P.T., games, outdoor geography, local history and English Drama.\n\nAt the Senior School on July 9th Miss Hall, the canteen supervisor, discussed with the headmaster the installation of a heating oven, hot plate, and other suitable equipment, and perhaps cooking skills were amongst the benefits that Katherine Bonham brought to married life, following her wedding on Saturday, July 10th. A popular mistress at Bletchley Junior School, she was the only daughter of Mr. & Mrs. E. Bonham, and the date of her marriage, at her home village of Newton Longville, in fact coincided with a White Paper which recommended that the school leaving age should again be raised, to 16.\n\nBy doing odd jobs during Bletchley’s Wings for Victory Week, local schools had managed to raise the sum of £3 10s, whilst on a more relaxing note, an afternoon Musical Festival was held in the Senior School Hall on July 21st, under the direction of Dr. S. Russell, the County Director of Music. The event featured the choirs of the Bletchley Road Senior School, Junior School, and St Paul’s evacuated school, and afterwards Dr. Russell stayed to provide a few hints on training the Senior School choir, in view of an audition the following term for the B.B.C.\n\nThe Bletchley Council schools closed the term with sports and games on Wednesday, August 1st, and Thursday, August 2nd, but for the classes of the Workers Educational Association - successfully run throughout the previous winter - these were now being re-arranged to continue during the coming winter, with courses to include Psychology, Appreciation of Music, and Philosophy.\n\nRegarding applications for educational grants, at the Council Offices on Thursday, August 26th, at a 3.15p.m. meeting of the Educational Grants Committee those parents hoping for financial assistance, towards the cost of sending their children to Wolverton school, were interviewed, as a consequence of the children having obtained a fee paying scholarship. After discussion it was resolved that the grants would in some cases be made although, in one instance, the Clerk reported having received a parents letter withdrawing their application, on being informed by the headmaster that no vacancy would be available this year.\n\nOn Friday, October 8th Mr. E.C. Cook paid a visit to the Secretary of the Extra Mural Delegacy in Oxford, regarding classes and teachers in adult education, and this would be also the date that the Art Classes of the Bletchley Evening Institute resumed at the Bletchley Road Schools. The same day in fact that the boys of the Ecclesbourne Road L.C.C. Senior Boys’ School presented a wallet to their handicraft master, Mr. R. Michael, in appreciation of his work. Now returning to London, whilst at Bletchley he had carried out the boot-repairing scheme, started by the boys at a time when undertaking repairs proved difficult, and amongst the footwear in need of attention were perhaps ballet shoes for ‘into ballet and all that’ was Elsie Naylor, who, during the war, had come to the town after teaching for a while in Yorkshire, the county of her birth. After the war she would then continue her teaching career at Wilton Secondary School.\n\nOn October 26th the speech day and prize distribution took place at Bletchley Senior School, with the Hon. Lionel Berry as chief speaker. Recounting the school’s achievements, Mr. Cook recalled that the R.A.F. had been provided with a rubber dinghy, £629 17s 9d had been raised during Wings Week, 269 garments had been made for the Merchant Navy and R.A.F., and, in addition, each man on the ship adopted by the school had received a polo neck pullover. Wrapping up the day, in the evening the school then paid a visit to the Bletchley Park Recreational Club, for a performance of ‘Much Ado About Nothing’.\n\nAccompanied by Mr. Kingsbury, who showed the children various farming implements, at the Bletchley Road Senior School on January 11th Mr. Hartley, the County Organiser for Rural Subjects and Agriculture, gave a short lecture concerning young farmers clubs, and in fact on the day that the Young Farmers’ Club began its work, on February 22nd Mr. Hartley would again pay a visit, as also the Deputy Executive Officer for the B.W.A.E.C., who lectured the members on ‘Soils and relevant Geology’. With Mr. Gainer of Rothamsted Experimental Station, Harpenden, Mr. Hartley then again returned to the school on February 25th, on this occasion regarding a scheme to select a site for the carrying out of manurial experiments. This was in connection with Rothamsted and the Young Farmers’ Club, and, on the afternoon of February 29th the Young Farmers’ Club paid a visit to the school’s adopted farm at Galley Lane, where the pedigree breed of Ayrshire cattle were inspected under the guidance of Mr. Barbour who, having lectured to the members, then allowed the children to judge four young heifers and four dairy cows.\n\nFor the education of the town’s adult population, at Bletchley Road Senior School, on Wednesday, February 9th the Workers’ Education Association, Bletchley Branch, had organised a public meeting at 7.30p.m. to discuss ‘The New Education Bill’, and also during the month, hopefully with no question of strings being pulled Mr. W. Crisp, headmaster of Bletchley Junior School, was appointed as chairman of the Educational Puppetry Association.\n\nHaving earlier in the afternoon said goodbye to the children in St. Martin’s Hall, one Wednesday in February Deaconess Warman was entertained to tea by the staffs of the Bletchley evacuated schools, and, in appreciation of the children’s welfare, the presentation of a collection of books was made by the headmistress of the Ecclesbourne Road Infants’ School, Miss Eden. However, should Miss Eden harbour any desire to become a Mrs., then this would not be a problem from the 10th of March, when the Education minister, Mr. R.A. Butler, whose Act during the year would inaugurate a system of universal secondary education, lifted the ban which forbade women teachers to marry.\n\nBy now 47 young children, aged between seven and ten, were quartered at the Yeomanry Hall, where for this purpose the L.C.C. had loaned to Bucks. County Council a male teacher, who had been in Bletchley since the beginning of the evacuation. In fact since he had no assistance, his long experience of dealing with tough London boys was just as well, and his only complaint concerned the piano, which only had about ten playable notes! He had therefore started a piano fund, and perhaps the Challen walnut upright model, offered for sale ‘as new’, at the Bull Hotel, might thus be of interest. With the headmaster being Mr. W. Davies, at St. Paul’s School, currently accommodated in St. Martin’s Hall, there were three teachers and, aged from seven and a half to 14, 70 pupils, who were presently subscribing for the hire of a wireless set. As for the Baptist School Hall, this was divided into a nursery school, for children aged two to three, and an upper infants school, and with cod liver oil and orange juice taken daily by the pupils, canteen meals were being served on the premises.\n\nOn March 29th, at a 3.15p.m. ceremony at the Bletchley Road Senior School, for the purchase of a parachute a cheque for £36 15s was presented to the R.A.F. whilst, at 3.30p.m. the following afternoon, Leslie Woodgate, the B.B.C. Musical Director of the B.B.C. Education Department, dropped in to audition the school choir, with a view to future broadcasting. He would then make a report to the B.B.C. Education Department.\n\nDespite many children now preferring to have their meals at the British Restaurant, the immediate need had arisen for a kitchen maid at the Bletchley School canteen, 9a.m.  3p.m., Monday to Friday, although perhaps school meals regained favour at the end of the month, when the reduced prices for children’s meals at the loss making Restaurant were discontinued. In fact the Ministry of Food had sent a letter to the Highways & Works Committee on the matter, which lead to a recommendation that the price should be the same as for adults.\n\nThe headmaster, Mr. Cook, recorded ‘I should like to place on record her loyal and devoted service’ when, on securing an appointment in the Junior Department, from April 28th Mrs. E. Jones, nee Hope, finished her teaching duties at the Bletchley Road Senior School. Then, at the end of April, after teaching in Bletchley Schools for 23 years Miss A. Milsom retired, and in the Bletchley Road Junior School she was presented by the combined staffs with a silver bowl, and a handbag and electric kettle by the children. With music by the Acme Players Dance Band, on Saturday, April 29th the Parents Association held a dance in the Senior School, and here there was now an immediate need for a canteen kitchen maid to work from 8.30a.m. to 3p.m., although ‘Very, very occasionally there might be extra work, for which additional remuneration will be paid.’\n\nOn the afternoon of June 2nd Mr. Brown, the Assistant Secretary for Education, made a visit to the Bletchley Road Senior School, this being in connection with an impending visit by children from Bledlow Ridge Council School. Accompanied by their headmaster, when they duly arrived on June 5th they were then welcomed to lunch by several members of staff, and were hopefully better behaved than the two Birmingham boys, aged 13 and 12, who, playing truant and travelling to Bletchley, stole Hedley Clarke’s car from the Conservative Club on the evening of June 8th. In evidence, Mr. Clarke, of Osbourne House, Manor Road, said that having left his Austin saloon in the club forecourt at 7.20p.m., he later received a message from the police reporting that the vehicle had been found in the Social Centre car park. Due to the car being driven in low gear, the pistons had been slightly damaged, but, in his defence, the father of the younger boy attributed the escapade to a ‘high spirited mood’ following news of the Normandy landings. Yet it nevertheless seemed hardly a sporting episode, unlike that on the afternoon of June 14th when, with the shield being won by Penn House, the annual sports of the Bletchley Road Senior School took place.\n\nOn June 16th an afternoon farewell party was given for the Bledlow children, but the jovial mood was in contrast to that which prevailed on June 30th, when the air raid alert sounded at 9.03a.m. The children were marshalled to their allotted places in the corridor, and, with the all clear sounding at 9.12a.m., the Special Technical Exam had to be postponed by 15 minutes. Another alert then occurred on July 10th at 1.10p.m., and on this occasion the all clear sounded 15 minutes later.\n\nWith the schoolchildren playing all the parts, Bletchley Senior School presented ‘Merrie England’ in the Senior School Hall on July 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, 28 and 29th. Produced by the headmaster, Mr. E.C. Cook, all the parts were played by the schoolchildren, and for his performance as Sir Walter Raleigh, Ray Clargo achieved especial acclaim. Grounds in fact for a quiet pride, and for taking a pride in their grounds, the Junior School now advertised the need for a small lawnmower.\n\nPresented with a cheque by the London teachers, in late August Mr. S. Taylor, headmaster of Ecclesbourne Road Senior School, retired at the age of 65. He had been due to retire in 1939, but agreed to continue when the evacuation began. As the career of one teacher so came to an end, that of another now commenced, and at the Bletchley Road Senior School Miss Celia. D. Cook began supply teaching in place of the intended appointment, who would be unable to assume the position until Monday, September 18th. Celia, as well as Geoffrey Cox, of 147, Western Road, had recently gained a B.A. degree at Oxford University, having passed the Final Honours School of Modern History. She was the daughter of the Bletchley Road Senior School headmaster, Mr. E.C. Cook, F.R.S.A., M.R.S.T., and from him regarding the Bletchley Evening Institute details of the classes, and a prospectus, could now be obtained, with the students, (following their enrolment, from 7p.m. - 9p.m. on Tuesday, 19th September, by the principal and staff), to begin their studies on Monday, 25th September. As for the results of the audition for the Senior School choir, on behalf of the Senior Education Assistant on September 28th a letter was received from Viola Huggins, of the B.B.C., Broadcasting House, Whiteladies Road, Bristol, stating that although Mr. Woodgate had been impressed - ‘the choir sang well and pleasingly, and their words were excellent’ - according to the programme official in charge of the schools music broadcasts, John Horton, there was no place at present for this particular type of programme in the schedule. Food for thought, as were the plans for the extension of the canteen kitchen, which were discussed by the Emergency Canteen Committee at 3p.m. on September 29th, at the Bletchley Road Senior School.\n\nUnder Mr. H. Sellen, on Wednesdays, from 7.30p.m. to 9.30p.m., art classes for adults were now being held at the Bletchley schools in ‘drawing, painting and sketching from the life’. As for children, at a meeting of the Education Grants Committee, at 4p.m. on Thursday, October 5th applications for educational grants were considered, and the Committee interviewed parents regarding their applications for financial assistance. This followed the award of scholarships, with the consequent money to be applied towards the cost of sending their children to Wolverton and Leighton Buzzard. Four applications would be granted - respectively two of £8, and two of £10 - with a further grant of £8, and £10, to be made at the meeting on November 9th.\n\nAs announced by the Bletchley and District Co-op Society Educational Committee, the much requested Co-op Junior Choir would commence on Tuesdays at 6p.m. from October 10th. All children were welcome, but they would perhaps not be so keen on the public discussion held by the Educational Committee on Thursday, October 26th, regarding interest free loans for publicly built housing.\n\nFor the Bletchley Road schools canteen, on October 25th 32 forms, and 32 folding chairs, were received from the Ministry of Supply, no doubt providing extra work for the person appointed as school caretaker, a position that offered £12 10s a month, plus a war bonus of £4 2s 7d. As for the caretaker’s house, this would cost 7s 6d a week, exclusive of rates and other charges.\n\nReminding of the old National School, where she had assisted on occasion, Mrs. Catherine Amelia Cowlishaw died at the age of 89 during November. The widow of John Cowlishaw, who for many years had been the headmaster, for the past 13 years she had lived with her son and daughter in law at The Chalet, Aylesbury Street, and of her other children, Arthur now lived in London, and Herbert in Australia.\n\nOn November 30th, it was agreed between representatives of the Bucks. County Education Committee, the U.D.C.s of Bletchley, Newport Pagnell and Wolverton and Newport Pagnell R.D.C.s, to press for establishing a Divisional Executive Committee to cover these areas, and with the conference held at Wolverton, it seemed appropriate that Wolverton should be chosen as the administrative centre.\n\nIn the Junior School Hall, an exhibition of work was arranged by the headmaster, Mr. Crisp, from 2p.m. to 4.15p.m. on Friday and Saturday, 8th and 9th December, and, with a collection made in aid of the Red Cross, each of the 320 children had contributed at least one entry. The seven to eight year olds displayed a model farm, calendars, Christmas cards, etc., the nine to ten year olds produced a class magazine and needlework, whilst the ten to 11 year olds showed arts and crafts, needlework, embroidery, and written work.\n\nThen, after a tea, a few days before Christmas toys, which had been made by the nursery staff, and which had adorned two Christmas trees, were distributed to the children of the London Infants School at the Baptist hall, whilst as for St. Paul’s School, they held a concert and children’s party, with games and competitions being a feature of the following day.\n\nUnder the ‘Limitation of Supplies’, Bletchley & District Co-op had just received their quota of hardware for the next six months, and perhaps in consequence an adult female shop assistant was now required for their hardware department. Various vacancies were also available at the Garden Café and Restaurant, 97, Bletchley Road, whilst at 83, Bletchley Road, the British Gas Light Co. needed a general clerk, with skills in typing, shorthand and bookkeeping.\n\nIncreasingly, many firms were being inconvenienced by the liability of their employees for military service, and, at W. O. Peake’s factory in Denbigh Road, fellow workers made a presentation on Wednesday, January 14th to a popular member of staff, Harry Bates, of 52, Church Street, who was shortly to join the Beds. & Herts. Regiment. As for those people still employed in the town, at the Quarterly Meeting of the local branch of the Amalgamated Union of Operative Bakers, on Saturday, January 10th a request was made that Bletchley Co-op should raise the basic rate for table hands and bread bakers from 56s to 60s a week, which would bring them into line with the Wolverton rate. However, for those persons seeking a business of their own, an opportunity arose in the town when a gentlemen’s hairdressing salon, and lock-up, came up for let until the duration - ‘apply Stanley House, Bletchley’.\n\nIn their continuing need for staff, at the beginning of February a cook’s assistant, waitresses, a kitchen hand, and washer-ups were required - ‘no experience necessary’ - at the Garden Café & Restaurant, although a more tragic shortage was reported when news arrived that the former manager of the Water Eaton branch of the Bletchley Co-op, Gunner William Betts, R.A., of ‘Snaefell’, Cottingham Grove, had, since December 15th, 1941, been posted as missing. A keen member of the town’s Lawn Tennis Club, he originally enlisted in the army in October 1940, a year after his marriage.\n\nCaused by a lack of errand boys, Bletchley householders might now have to collect their own newspapers, and also concerning paper the Blackmore Fashion Co., at the Town Hall, advertised vacancies for two or three junior girls, and two or three women, for work producing the renowned paper patterns of the company.\n\nDuring the middle of the month a committee representing the principal traders in the town met on a Wednesday to form a vehicle ‘pooling scheme’, and this would then be submitted to the Ministry of Transport. Yet, since many traders were unwilling to suffer any sacrifice by which their competitors might benefit, the chance of a successful outcome seemed rather remote, and if this was the case, then the Ministry could impose a scheme of their own. Unless they employed the service of Mr. W. A. Underwood, who operated a car hire business from the White Hart Inn, those housewives living within a one mile radius of the Bletchley Food Office, at Lantern House, would thereby face the prospect of carrying their own shopping home, and, in fact this became a measure announced at a meeting of the Bletchley traders in Bletchley police station, where the District Transport Officer, Mr. Rowe, told those assembled that the time had now arrived for traders to cut down on fuel consumption. Except for the elderly and invalids, no deliveries could be made within a mile of the Food Office, and also causing concern was the availability of supplies to the several merchants in the town including R. Johnson, ‘wholesale fruit and potato merchant’, who increasingly sought sources of potatoes, white turnips, and swedes.\n\nAfter nearly 70 years in business, the old established timber mills and workshops of Rowland Bros. (Timber Merchants) Ltd. had been recently purchased by one of the country’s largest timber merchants, James Latham, established in 1815. The new company would now be known as ‘Rowland Bros. (Timber Merchants): proprietors, James Latham Ltd.’, but apart from the name, an association with the previous family would also remain by the appointment of Mr. S. Rowland, formerly the managing director, as an executive director, to control, as the local representative, the staff and employees at Fenny Stratford under the direction of the head office. The company had been originally set up by the Rowland brothers in 1874, being in later years continued by their two sons, but considerable changes were made around 1937, when Mr. A. Rowland left the business, and the firm was formed into a limited company, with Mr. S. H. Rowland as managing director.\n\nAs for the transport pooling scheme, having been rejected by the Ministry of Transport a new scheme was to now be prepared, and also on matters of ‘curtailment’, from Monday, March 2nd the restriction of bread deliveries began, a situation ‘cheerfully accepted’ however by most housewives. Also having to be cheerfully accepted were the disruptions being caused to coal deliveries due to a shortage of manpower and, now serving in the army, one man who had been recently called up was a 30 year old butcher of Bletchley Road. Yet military duties did not excuse him from being summoned to Bletchley police court one Thursday in early March, for misrepresenting the weight of two geese, offered for sale above the maximum price. The summons followed a surprise visit to the shop on December 23rd by a County Council Inspector and Enforcement Officer for Bletchley Food Committee who, having noticed in the window a row of geese labelled with the weight and price, gave his name and waited until the butcher had finished dealing with his customers. The Inspector then noticed the man walk behind the row of geese - all but two of which had been plucked and drawn - and surreptitiously remove the tickets from those that had been rough plucked. When asked to explain his actions, the man replied that he could not have been thinking, but when the two geese were weighed, and the price was found to be too high, he then said he must have slipped up, and pleaded guilty. However, at least as some redemption all the other weights on further investigation were found to be correct. Some months ago, having gone into ‘war work’ the butcher had engaged a manager but, during the Christmas rush, he went back to help, a gesture that subsequently cost him a fine of £13.\n\nEffective from March 9th, Bletchley Retail Trades Group now announced that, due to the restriction by the Ministry of War Transport on their delivery services, the delivery of goods in the Bletchley urban area and surrounding villages could only be made as meat, one delivery per week, (no motor deliveries in town), greengroceries, two deliveries per week, and bread, three deliveries per week, although special arrangements would be made for the aged and infirm.\n\nOn Thursday, March 26th all milk producers were then invited by the N.F.U. Bletchley branch to a meeting at 3p.m. at the Assembly Room of the Park Hotel, where they would ‘receive a report on the present position and to discuss same’. Again on milky matters, until the duration a dairy rounds man, ‘horse or motor’, was required at the Bletchley and District Co-op, the Bakery Dept. of which would by the end of the month be producing bread and cakes from ‘the New Government Flour’, and indeed later in the year the manager, Mr. F. Maycock, would be responsible for the loaf that gained a silver medal for household bread. The Co-op Bakery had first opened on July 16th, 1938 and although new recipes were now being prepared to meet the ‘New Requirements’, diminishing stocks of white flour made it impossible to bake anything other than the ‘National Loaf’, which became compulsory on Monday, April 6th.\n\nBlackmore Patterns were now advertising for two or three junior girls, and two or three women, for paper pattern work, and they also had the need in the Fenny Stratford area for ‘A Comfortable Home required by respectable workman’. Elsewhere, at 47, Bletchley Road, a lady hairdresser was required at ‘Dorothea’, the owner, Miss Dorothea Taylor, having begun in business at the age of 18. For two years she trained at a salon at Northampton before purchasing her own shop at Sandy, Beds., and two years later she then came to Bletchley to take over a business in Bletchley Road from Miss Sear, the first ladies hairdresser in the town.\n\nBletchley & District Co-op were now offering the famous Astral Model Aeroplane kits, in a range of flying scale models priced at 1s 9d, 8s 6d and 12s 6d, and it therefore seemed appropriate that a meeting to discuss the formation of a model-building club should be held in the Co-op Hall, on Monday, April 19th at 7p.m.\n\nSadly, the death had recently occurred at Taunton, Somerset, of Miss Charlotte Freeman who, for many years, had been cashier at the grocery shop of Mr. F. Cutler, moving with him and his wife when they left the district. As for the more unusual ‘trades’ in the town, Bletchley played host to one of the few remaining scissor grinders in the country, whose skills were now in increasing demand since a growing shortage of knives and scissors had made ‘every rusty relic worth cleaning and sharpening’. Meanwhile, a sharp lookout was being kept by Blackmore Patterns towards the end of April for ‘a good typewriter and two ladies’ cycles’, but final ties were being severed with the previously mentioned Rowland Bros. (Timber Merchants) Ltd., which was being voluntarily wound up. Creditors were to send their details to the appointed Liquidator, Hubert Baker, F.C.A., of the Bletchley firm of H. S. Baker & Co., Chartered Accountants.\n\nHis wife having died eight years ago, Fred Vaughan, licensee of the Red Lion, passed away at the end of April, aged 64. He had suffered for three years from ill health, and this proved the reason to give up the bakery business in which, for many years, he had been involved. Originating from Banbury, his parents had taken over the Bull & Butcher, and, when they died, about six years later, he went into the bakery trade at Olney. After some 20 years, because of his health he then returned to Bletchley to take the licence of the Red Lion, and was well remembered for letting out boats on the canal. He left four sons and two daughters.\n\nUnder the new management, at the beginning of May a tractor driver and mate were required to haul timber at Rowlands, whilst for ‘intelligent girls’, aged from 14, vacancies were still available at Blackmore Fashions ‘at an attractive wage’. However, for any residents perhaps living beyond their means, they could now seek assistance at the Bletchley Citizens Advice Bureau, held once a week at the Council Offices, but for residents with money to spend, their custom maintained a buoyancy of trade at the Co-op, where cash sales in the quarter ending April 11th totalled £69,192, an increase of £3804 over the previous year.\n\nWidespread sympathies were expressed when, at the age of 93, Mrs. Louisa Meager died on Wednesday, May 27th at her home ‘The Hill’, 128, Buckingham Road. Associated with an old established craft traders family, she regularly attended St. Mary’s church, and first came to Bletchley from London 70 years ago, marrying Fred Meager, a wheelwright from a well-known Bletchley family.\n\nWith also the need for a relief barmaid for evenings and weekends, at the Park Hotel a barmaid was now required, ‘sleep in or out’, whilst alternative employment awaited a young lady, aged 14-16, for office work at Weatherheads. Presently the firm was engaged on fitting radio apparatus to American tanks, and in fact for the British war effort Bert Weatherhead was involved elsewhere on wireless work, for the Secret Service.\n\nAt the beginning of July, J.E. Wells and Sons announced that ‘To meet your post-war needs’, they had brought the two parts of their business into the same set of premises. Meanwhile, the Bletchley and District Co-op Society bakery department required women and girls, full or part time, as either assistants for confectionery production, or rounds assistants, and customers of the Co-op were now invited to ‘register at once for all your rational goods’ - ‘full dividend on all purchases’. In fact not surprisingly the regular queue for the ‘divi’ was a frequent sight in the town! Indeed, for their ‘rational goods’ many consumers must have registered for the half-year ending July 11th, for this showed an increase of over £8000 on the previous half year, and had been achieved despite 85 members of the staff having either been called up for the Forces, or for full time duties in the Civil Defence. As for men exempt from military service, job opportunities elsewhere included a driver for a three ton lorry at Rowlands, where boys and girls were required for mill work, and for a decorator work was available, nights or weekends, at 97, Bletchley Road at the Garden Café, which also needed a waitress and washer up. Job hopefuls could otherwise seek something a little different by applying for the position of ‘collector from slot machines’ at the British Gas Light Co., at 83, Bletchley Road.\n\nOn the instructions of the Trustees of the late Mrs. Ada Vaughan, Wigley & Johnson were directed to auction The Red Lion, Simpson Road, on Wednesday, July 15th at 3p.m. whilst regarding other hostelries, in early August the Foundry Arms was transferred from William Thurgood to Reg Bartram who, should he need any additional floorcovering for the premises, could opportunely obtain ‘cheap’ sawdust from across the road at the M. A. Cook brushworks.\n\nOver a weekend at the end of July, to celebrate the Co-operative Century members of the Bletchley and District Co-operative Society produced ‘the pageant of the people’. No expense was spared, and ‘the lighting equipment, especially installed, was the equivalent of that found in a high-class theatre’. Definitely a newsworthy event, although the combined newsagents of Bletchley announced that after Monday, July 31st revised charges for daily newspaper deliveries would apply, being 2d a week.\n\nDue to ill health, John Colgrove had now sold his butchers business. Established for over 40 years, his shop was well known in the town, and also well known was the brick making firm of Flettons Ltd. which in early August offered part-time work for women over 30 - ‘not as a means of advertising their age but essential war work’. With hours to suit, the situations provided good pay, a bonus scheme, and canteen, and those so enticed were asked to apply to the Water Eaton works. After an arduous day in the brickfields, perhaps to restore a sense of femininity successful applicants could then shortly make an appointment at the Bletchley Co-op ladies’ hairdressing salon, which was soon to re-open under new management. At Bletchley station, job opportunities awaited male and female porters, van drivers, and male shunters, and if this didn’t appeal, then for evening and Sunday duties a vacancy had arisen at Bletchley telephone exchange for a part-time male night telephonist, ‘not liable for military service’. Anyone interested was to ‘Apply head postmaster.’\n\nBy early September, a young assistant was needed at Brooklands Nursery for Ramsbotham and Co., florists and fruiterers, and Johnson & Son, Wholesale Fruiterers, now required a strong youth, or retired railwayman, to assist both on a lorry and for local deliveries. In fact ideal for carrying out local deliveries was a ‘Water-cooled three-wheel Raleigh Tradesman’s Van. Low mileage, just overhauled’, presently offered for sale by Hubert Faulkner, at Staple Lodge, and also on motoring matters, of the Kingsway Garage, Watling Street, the managing director, Mr. R. Tompkins, suffered an unfortunate accident on Thursday, September 3rd when he was shot in the arm and leg whilst out ‘light shooting’ with a companion.\n\nOn the evening of September 10th Mr. Harry Sainsbury, who for many years had been in business as a draper in the High Street, Fenny Stratford, died suddenly at Bognor Regis. He had been a keen member of the Fenny Stratford Bowls Club and another bowling enthusiast, Mr. Edgar Thomas Hill, the shoe retailer, of 33, High Street, would announce during the month that he would only be open daily from 3p.m. to 6p.m., except Wednesday mornings 9a.m. to 1p.m. Apart from war conditions, this was because of a shortage of staff, but urgent orders could still be dealt with ‘at any time’ at 1, Bletchley Road, where the normal business hours prevailed. Born in 1887, on leaving school Edgar had gone into business with his father, who ran a boot shop in the High Street, and when his father retired he then took over the concern, later extending the enterprise by opening premises in Bletchley Road. Joining the army during World War One, he served in France and Italy, and in 1919 married Dorothy Boyes, daughter of the manager at Rowland Bros.\n\nFor the convenience of their employees, plans submitted for lavatory accommodation by the Rodex Works of W.O.Peake, in Denbigh Road, and the nurseries in Brooklands Road - respectively Plan 1297 and Plan 1298 - were considered by the Council in early October, and other businesses in the town had also been caught short, by a lack of staff. Various vacancies included that for a male or female, aged under 17, and not liable for military service, at W. H. Smith, an estimating clerk, male or female, at the Sawmills & Manufacturer’s office at Rowlands, and positions for women and girls, under 18, or over 31, at Beacon Brushes. Then a little later, in early November a boy would be needed to assist at Benford’s butchers, Simpson Road, whilst Blackmore Patterns required girls and women for pattern folding and despatch work. The company could additionally offer ‘a good machine job’ for a man, exempt from service or over military age, and for the pets left at home whilst their owners were out at work, they could be assured that suitable products were available at the Bentima Co. Ltd, 19, Bletchley Road, especially ‘Karswood Dog Powders’ which, at 7d. a packet, ‘Keeps Nerves Steady’.\n\nOwing to a shortage of labour, having reached a unanimous decision the Bletchley & District Dairymen’s Association would from Sunday, November 1st only deliver milk to their customers on alternate days. Consumers were therefore advised to take a two days supply of milk, and perhaps this could be stored in the several Pyrex products now available from the Bletchley & District Co-op Hardware Dept., who opportunely advised that ‘Glassware is always useful as a Christmas Gift.’\n\nEmphasised by the presentation of a petition, by now the residents of Osborne Street were complaining about excessive machinery noise at the factory of Messrs. J. Tetley & Co., a firm which had recently transferred their operations from the dangers of the East End of London. By the recommendation of the Highways Committee, the Surveyor would discuss the matter with the factory manager, but a far greater commotion - since the firm was partly engaged on Government contracts - was caused on Wednesday, November 4th when a large fire at the James Root & Sons brushworks, in Tavistock Street, destroyed the main building, a great deal of machinery, and large stocks of brushes. Indeed, the eventual damage would amount to £20,000. With a timing somewhat bizarre, the fire had broken out about 7.15a.m., just after the firewatchers had left, but thankfully before the workers arrived, and seemed consequent to the lighting of the furnace by the engine man, Mr. Emanual Isaacs. The blaze began in flammable material lying nearby, and although he tried to put out the blaze, in a short while the engine room was alight. Being called immediately, the Bletchley Fire Section arrived within a minute or so but with their resources proving inadequate, other fire brigades then had to be summoned from within a radius of 20 miles. The police formed a barrier at the top of Tavistock Street to keep the many spectators at a distance, and by laying about two and a half miles of hose, water had to be pumped from nearby gravel pits, since the supply from the street hydrant proved insufficient. Yet even so, when the Divisional Officer, Mr. A. Reading, arrived to take charge, the three-storey building adjoining the engine room had become a burning mass, and the collapse of the roof showered bricks, slates, and mortar onto the firemen, whose efforts to tackle the root of the blaze were consequently hindered. Compounding the crisis, two floors of the main shop fell in, and, with machines tumbling through the floors and snapping beams, it soon became apparent that the main building was completely engulfed. Attention then turned to heading off the flames both from the newly built section, and an old storehouse, and fortunately each was eventually saved. At one stage, since a metal chimney close to the L.M.S. railway line seemed in danger of falling, the railway company was informed of the potential hazard, but although within the hour the fire would be brought under control, not until midday were the flames finally quenched. Workers looked on as Mr. Alfred Root, a partner in the firm, examined the damage with Mr. G. Garrett, the Chief Engineer, and Mr. J. Thom, the Manager, whilst having been on holiday, Mr. Ernest Root, the other partner in the business, returned later during the day. On Thursday the workers then ventured back into the premises, to help clear the mess, and with the wreckage having been cleared by Monday, with some of the plant and machinery salvaged the girls were back at work in the undamaged buildings. Soon plans were in hand to reconstruct the burnt out premises, and by equipping several small adjoining buildings the workers were able to carry out their jobs. In a well deserved praise of his workforce, Mr. E. Root said that the workers ‘had toiled like Trojans’, taking down heavy plant at risk to themselves, and ‘I have never seen a more willing body of workers.’ Yet despite all the damage and chaos, the swift installation of power meters and new cables, by the Northampton Electric Light Company, allowed brush manufacture to return to 85% of normal production within a month. No doubt effective measures were soon put in place to prevent a reoccurrence, in fact pursuant to those already deemed necessary by the legislation passed in 1895, by which the Surveyor was instructed to discover if conditions at the brush factory complied with the new orders regarding overcrowding, ‘sanitary conveniences’ and fire.\n\nThankfully there had been nothing fishy about the cause of the brushworks blaze, but for Bletchley’s fish supplies, these were now the worst since the new control had commenced, at least according to a principal fishmonger of the town who, having one Tuesday morning received 200lb of fish, sold the lot in 50 minutes, and then had to close for the week!\n\nAs the year began, opportunities for local employment were being offered by several firms including, in the High Street, Kingsway Garage, who required a boy aged between 14 and 16, and a youth, ‘able to drive’. A. Benford, the butchers, needed a youth aged 15 to 16, and the Park Hotel needed the skills of an odd job man, possibly a pensioner, and also a barmaid and relief barmaid. Females could also apply to be waitresses, on Friday and Saturday evenings, 7p.m.  10.30p.m., at the Conservative Club, or else ‘For Important Work’ as brush workers at M. A. Cook, or Beacon Brushes. As for travelling to interviews, Bill Underwood offered his car hire service from the White Hart Inn, and in order to look one’s best there was always Sketchley Dye Works, at 23, Bletchley Road, or the ‘Beaucaire’, stain, crease removal service, available at Bletchley & District Co-op, with the additional benefit that it ‘helps rationing’.\n\nIn February, at a Tuesday meeting at the Council Offices, with Mr. Oliver Wells in the chair the opening of a social club was agreed by representatives from Bletchley firms and organisations, the objective being to primarily provide a general entertainment for workers. One room would be especially set aside for rest purposes, and Miss Bezzant, Welfare Officer for the Ministry of Information, said that having seen the achievements in other districts, she fully realised a similar need for Bletchley. A full-time warden would be appointed to organise the activities of the club, and, with the facilities open all day and every day for the benefit of shift workers, the Ministry of Labour were prepared to release the Temperance Hall in George Street as a clubroom. Mr H. Jones was subsequently appointed as Secretary of the Committee which, operating until the opening of the centre, would then be replaced by the formation of a council and their elected committee.\n\nPerhaps helping to boost wartime morale, at The Wine & Spirit Stores, in Bletchley Road, Ernest Staniford had now applied for a licence for the retail sale - for consumption off the premises - of spirits, beer and cider. The business having been established for 40 years, the applicant had possessed a Wholesale Excise Licence for 28 years, but his request was opposed by A. Gammage, the owner of premises in Park Street, and by Miss Gammage, who worked in the post office, she being the holder of an off licence in Park Street. The police also made formal objections and although Mr. Staniford had applied for a similar request on three of four occasions, the last being in 1938, despite approval by the Justices, the Confirming Committee at Aylesbury threw the application out.\n\nIn spite of the war, and the rationing restrictions, the Co-op enjoyed a healthy trade, and could now offer supplies of ‘Utility’ furniture. However, the end of February saw the end for Thomas’s Bazaar, at 59, Aylesbury Street, and with the closure of the shop, for their loyal support during the past 12 years Mr. and Mrs. H.C. Thomas expressed their due appreciation to customers. Within a few weeks, not least because the situation lay adjacent to their men and boys outfitting department, J.E. Wells and Son then removed their footwear department to the premises, offering ‘Good Service, Good Selection, Good Value.’\n\nAnother Bletchley business shortly to seek new premises was Ramsbotham & Co., florists and seedsmen, in Bletchley Road, for in early March, at about 10.30p.m. one Friday night soldiers raised the alarm on discovering a fire in the back room. The blaze had burnt through the intervening wall and, following an urgent phone call by a member of the Home Guard, Bletchley N.F.S. swiftly arrived and put out the blaze within 30 minutes. Fortunately Mr. Vasey, who lived above the shop, had not been at home and despite the loss of the shop, by courtesy of Mr. A. Pollard the company was soon back in business at 39, Bletchley Road. From his father, Mr. J. Ramsbotham had taken over the business in the 1920s, and since 1935 he had been a member of the Royal Observer Corps, the local outpost of which, with access through the farmyard, was in a field behind the Manor Road farm. In fact in 1944 Mr. Ramsbotham would then become the chief observer whilst as for his other activities, on the death of Mr. T. Coles, the chairman since the formation, he then became chairman of the Conservative Club, and remained as such for several years after the war. On eventually relinquishing the position, he would be presented with a silver tankard, the role being next assumed by Gordon Wilkinson.\n\nPlans having recently been approved for rebuilding part of the factory, at the end of the month James Root, the brush manufacturers of Tavistock Street, required two full or part-time office clerks, ‘must be able to use a typewriter’, but sadly this was at a time when at the age of 68 the death occurred, at 22, Bletchley Road, of the keen cricket player Joe Stevens, who had been the manager of the Bletchley Co-op Dairy.\n\nApril brought the offer of free sawdust from the brushworks of M. A. Cook - ‘bring your own bags’ - and for a youth, work was now available in shop duties and deliveries at H. W. Bonner, ‘The Central Stores’. Meanwhile, at Blackmore Patterns the need had arisen for a print compositor, full or part time, with this supposedly being an ‘Ideal post for disabled or retired man for work of easy character and where highest qualifications are not essential.’ Despite the restrictions on private motoring, Haynes and Goodman, of 6, High Street, were still keen to purchase ‘good, modern cars’, and in common with most of the local traders Bletchley Co-op then advised customers of their Easter closure, from Friday, April 23rd until Monday, 26th April, although the confectionery department would remain open on Saturday morning.\n\nDuring the month, on a Wednesday morning a mysterious fire destroyed three buildings, and their contents, owned by Norman Green. They lay at the rear of his Bletchley Road premises, and having at around 8.10a.m. noticed some rubbish and straw alight in the yard, Mr. S. Osbourne, of 14, Bletchley Road, tried to drag the burning debris away, until the heat proved too intense. He then ran to the shop of Smith & Sons to telephone the N.F.S., and although they arrived within five minutes, to be shortly joined by the N.F.S. pump from Buckingham, the outbuildings were destroyed, and not until 10.30a.m. would the blaze be finally quelled. Some having been purchased for customers, a large quantity of furniture perished in the fire and also a Daimler truck and two cars but despite the upset of "
