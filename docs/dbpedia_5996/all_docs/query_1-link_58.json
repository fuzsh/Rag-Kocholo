He rose to prominence following the release of his debut studio album Maxwell’s Urban Hange Suite (1996), which received widespread acclaim and pawned the hit singles “Ascension (Don’t Ever Wonder)” and “Sumthin’ Sumthin”. Through the album and its follow ups, Maxwell has been cited – along with Lauryn Hill, D’Angelo, and Erykah Badu – for ushering in the neo soul movement and its sensibilities into mainstream popular music during the late 1990s.\n\nSpecials guests include Jazmine Sullivan and October London\n\nTickets On sale: 3/28/24 at 10AM (Presale), 3/29/24 at 10AM (Public sale)\n\nDoors open at 6:30PM.
