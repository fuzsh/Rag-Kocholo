        "text": "After several years of swimming against a COVID-driven tide, the California Jazz Conservatory announced in July that the coming fall semester will be its last.\n\nWith enrollment pummeled by the pandemic and no signs of a new wave of students to replenish the ranks, the nation’s only standalone degree-granting school dedicated to jazz — an experiment in the heart of downtown Berkeley’s arts district — is coming to an end a decade after earning accreditation.\n\nThe closure, announced July 17, will not impact the kindred Jazzschool, the community music program that has offered classes “to more than 14,000 people of all ages over the course of our existence,” said Nick Phillips, who took over as the CJC’s president last October from the school’s founder, pianist Susan Muscarella.\n\nWhile the Jazzschool’s enrollment bounced back vigorously in recent years, with 1,000 students currently enrolled, Phillips said, the degree program did not. In the semester before the pandemic, the CJC degree program had 47 full-time and part-time students enrolled in the Bachelor of Music program, which dwindled to one part-time and 15 full-time students for the coming school year. The target to stay open was 25 students, Phillips said. The status of CJC employees and mid-degree students is uncertain. “I am talking to a number of schools about transfer opportunities” for the students, he said.\n\nEnrollment declines have led to U.S. colleges closing at a rate of one per week this year, up from about two a month in 2023. But CJC’s money troubles go beyond its degree program, putting it in the company of many struggling arts organizations in Berkeley and around the Bay Area, including Aurora Theatre, Freight & Salvage and Cal Shakes.\n\nThe conservatory had a budget deficit of more than $1.2 million in 2022, according to tax filings, with $3.5 million in expenses and $2.3 million in revenue. Revenue for the CJC dropped every year between 2019 and 2022, tax records show, as expenses trended upward, a gap partially covered with federal Paycheck Protection Program loans intended to help small businesses survive the pandemic. With a tuition of $30,000 a year, the CJC costs considerably less than Berklee College of Music ($48,830), USC’s Thornton School of Music ($66,640) or San Francisco Conservatory ($52,800).\n\n‘I was never thinking we would shut it down’\n\nMany other questions remain. In recent years, with the support of Power Bar co-founder Jennifer Maxwell, a drummer who studied at the Jazzschool, the CJC hired some of jazz’s most acclaimed players as faculty, including drummer Gerald Cleaver and guitarist Liberty Ellman (who got his start on the Bay Area scene). They both relocated from New York, and it’s yet to be determined what role they might play in the Jazzschool.\n\nAlameda saxophonist Dann Zinn sees the CJC closure as part of a wider regional jazz education retraction. Known for mentoring a bevy of future jazz stars, such as Berkeley High alumni Dayna Stephens and Hitomi Oba, he’s been teaching ear training and directing combos at the CJC in recent years, including several that took top honors at the Reno Jazz Festival.\n\nHe didn’t see the closure coming, but he admits he was also blindsided in recent months when Cal State East Bay zeroed out the jazz studies program he directed and cut his position working with SFJAZZ High School All-Stars.\n\n“I think I’m dense,” Zinn said. “With all three of my jobs, it was totally unexpected. I walked in to find out my schedule at Cal State East Bay and walked out without a job. At the CJC, I knew enrollment was low and Jeff Denson,” the school’s dean of curriculum, “was recruiting like crazy, but it caught me by surprise.”\n\nHe’s not the only one. Muscarella may have turned over the CJC reins, but she’s been teaching at the Jazzschool and said the announcement came as a “surprise to me.”\n\n“I just never thought that would happen,” she said. “When I was there, it was not that it was easy, but I was never thinking we would shut it down.”\n\nIt’s fair to say that the CJC was Muscarella’s dream. A respected player, composer, and educator, she honed her teaching chops as associate director of the UC Berkeley Jazz Ensembles in the 1980s. When she launched the Jazzschool in 1997 upstairs from the felicitously named French café La Note on Shattuck, her original vision was for a full-spectrum music program including theory, ear training and history. But most of the students were looking for instruction on their instruments and opportunities to play.\n\n“I did at first try to put a round peg in a square hole,” she said. “I originally designed a program of study, a curriculum, but it quickly became clear that students weren’t interested in that as much as being with other people who loved to play jazz. Taking two or more semesters of ear training wasn’t of interest.”\n\nShe shed the curriculum but maintained the top-shelf faculty, with world-class artists like trombonist Wayne Wallace, guitarist Mimi Fox and pianist Marcos Silva. The Jazzschool quickly outgrew La Note and moved to its present basement campus on Addison Street, nestled next to the Aurora Theatre, in 2002. Muscarella put her curriculum into action when she launched the CJC in 2014 with the new moniker and accreditation from the National Association of Schools of Music.\n\nThe campus expanded in 2018, adding studio and office space across the street in the Fiddler Annex, including the intimate 85-seat Rendon Hall theater, which has been home to trumpeter Erik Jekabson’s Electric Squeezebox Orchestra. It has also hosted some of jazz’s biggest stars, including pianist Rachel Z, tenor saxophonist Joe Lovano, clarinetist Anat Cohen and pianist George Cables, in a series underwritten by Jennifer Maxwell’s JAMBAR. The status of the space and the concert series is uncertain.\n\nZinn pointed to the Bay Area’s notoriously high housing costs as a major hurdle to attracting out-of-town students to the CJC. “A lot of the great high school players want to leave the area and go to New York, or Boston or L.A.,” he said. “The ones that don’t leave want to go to Stanford. The CJC’s whole thing is how do we keep the kids in the area.”\n\nAs for Phillips’ plans, closing the door on the CJC means creating more opportunities for the Jazzschool. “What it means is we’ll be able to focus energy and resources on growing the Jazzschool community program,” he said. “I’m confident that with some focused attention, increased community outreach and scholarships, we can have quite a bit of growth. Seeds are being planted with other jazz organizations in the Bay Area.”\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story stated the California Jazz Conservatory would be renamed after the Jazzschool. The nonprofit said no decisions about the organization’s name have been finalized."
