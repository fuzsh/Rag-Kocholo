        "text": "“I’ve always been into putting my head down and putting the time in,” the neo-soul singer Maxwell said in a recent interview. He was talking about preparations for an upcoming tour and why he’s keeping its details mum for a while, but he quickly realized that he could be talking about his entire career. “That’s why I go away so long, at times, because I just know what it takes to get into it. I’d rather not do it at all, than do it half-assed.”\n\nMaxwell is the kind of artist who is somehow prolific and elusive at the same time. Over the last 23 years, the 45-year-old has released five full albums and plenty of singles, yet it often feels like he’s lying low. But after a few years in the studio working on a follow-up to his 2016 album blackSUMMERS’night, he’s ready to come back. With a new single, “Shame,” already out and a slew of summer festival dates ahead, he’s spent the last month re-releasing EPs from his back catalog that have never before been available digitally, one each Friday. Today brings the fourth one, “Suitelady (The Proposal Jam),” and next week we will see the final one, “Whenever Wherever Whatever.”\n\nAll five EPs come from recording sessions for his 1996 debut album, Maxwell’s Urban Hang Suite, whose success was a bit of a surprise to the singer, born Gerald Maxwell Rivera. Ever the studio tinkerer, though, he was still making more music—different mixes of his songs, collaborations with new producers, and recordings of live sets—which were released on CD and 10” over the next two years.\n\nFor Maxwell, reworking a song was a way to experiment with musical styles and trends that might not necessarily fit in with the vibe-forward storytelling of a full album. When making an album, he said, “I just want to be able to make something that feels like you don’t know when it came out, like it could be made yesterday or 40 years ago or more. I don’t want things to ever have a time stamp on it.”\n\nBut a live show or an EP is his chance to do things a bit differently. “I tend to explore [new] styles on the stage,” he said. “Then I go off and collaborate with people like Cassady [who remixed “Shame” with him] and various other producers and DJs. We bring life to the song in a different way.”\n\nWhen he talks about his back catalog, he can sometimes sound a bit like the Marie Kondo of sound. “At times, you have to say to certain songs that ‘you know, we’ve sung you a lot, and you’ve been a great part of the setlist for a very long time . . . but maybe it’s time for you to not be here for a minute,’” he said. “So when we play it again, it’s in a different setting and it brings about a certain specialness.”\n\nLooking for that feeling as often as he does has slowed his career, but he appreciates the freedom he’s gotten because of it. “I’m just grateful that I got a commercial sense of things but still have this indie, underground feel to what I do,” he said, “and that’s how I approach my career.”\n\nBesides, some of his greatest successes have come from that place of patience and appreciation. During the conversation, he mentioned that his 2009 hit single “Pretty Wings” was actually written in 2002. “That song was a song I listened to by myself for five years before anyone ever heard it,” he said, adding that he saw it a bit like a child during that time. “When people have kids, [sometimes] they take photos but they don’t necessarily put them out there. They want to cherish their child before the world can.”\n\nGoing back to the 1996 EPs to get them ready for release wasn’t necessarily a simple process because of the way streaming platforms have changed music. “We’ve been working feverishly trying to get all the credits from all those years ago,” he said. “And get them implemented in all these different platforms. Everyone has a different way of doing things.”\n\nBut revisiting them took him “back to the future,” he said. It helped him reclaim a certain sense of the magic of making music when he wasn’t sure it would find an audience. “Here I am thinking, at that time, no one’s going to hear the work, no one’s going to get this,” he said. “And yet, looking back at pictures [from] when you felt your most insecure—you look at them and think, You know, I wasn't so bad. I wasn’t the greatest thing out there, but I wasn’t too bad.”\n\nMore Great Stories from Vanity Fair\n\n— Cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar’s victims strike back—with dynamite\n\n— Facial-hair theories: Why the Trump kids are sporting scruff, and what to make of Julian Assange’s exile beard\n\n— How Meghan and Harry became Instagram masters\n\n— Why Billie Eilish is such a media enigma"
