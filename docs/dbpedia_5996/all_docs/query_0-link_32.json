Both families claim membership in Clan Fraser of Lovat. According to the family history, they are descendants of a Fraser highlander named Captain John Fraser and, in his honour, there has always been a member of the family named John Fraser. Athol was amazed to find, after becoming an officer in the 78th Fraser highlanders and thus becoming privy to the muster roll of the original regiment,to find a brigade under the leadership of one Captain John Fraser; therefore, Athol feels honoured to have this connection to his ancestor through this historic regiment and the part this historic regiment played in the foundation of Canada. Athol is a member of Clan Fraser, a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, a member of the Royal Heraldry Society of Canada, and is actively involved in historical research. Athol is also a member of the Lord Lyon Society, which gives access to the archives of the Court of the Lord Lyon. The Society also studies the contribution made by the Scottish diaspora, especially in the Commonwealth.\n\nIn 1964-65, Athol began his re-enactment/living history career working at Black Creek Pioneer Village under Dr. Dorothy Duncan, as schoolteacher during the week and the preacher on Sundays.\n\nAthol has been involved in municipal heritage work and served as Chair of Heritage in Newmarket from 2011 to 2019, and is currently Chair of Heritage for the City of Kawartha Lakes.\n\nAthol has performed in re-enactments relating to the war of 1812 at such places as Nancy Island, and researched and brought back into the foreground a forgotten figure of Canadian history, Major-General Sir Francis the Baron de Rottenburg, President of Upper Canada 1813, who was also head of the civil and military government of Lower Canada in 1812 and 1814, making him the only man in Canadian history to have fulfilled this function for both Canadas during the war. He has also played the Baron at Fort Willow.\n\nOn September 29, 2012, the ARCH Committee (Architecture, Recreation, Culture, Heritage) presented Rebel Heartland, a major event at Fairy Lake Park and on Main Street commemorating Newmarket’s position as birthplace of the 1837 Upper Canada Rebellion. It was the largest re-enactment ever staged in the Town. Athol chaired the Rebel Heartland sub-committee and wrote, scripted, and directed the event as well as acted in it, playing the roles of lieutenant-governors Sir Francis Bond Head and Sir George Arthur. He also costumed and trained the volunteers including the Mayor and Regional Councillor. The event drew an estimated 1,800 people and was praised by the Town’s Cultural Master Plan Status Report: 2nd Edition as a “huge success.” This was followed in 2018 by a second Rebel Heartland event, this time over two days, September 22 and 23. Athol was again the driving force behind the event and performed most of the work, liaising with re-enactors, volunteers, performers, choirs, and two downtown churches, involving the entire downtown core. Thousands of spectators enjoyed demonstrations of historic skills, dancing, music, customs, costumes, and of course the battle itself with musket and cannon fire and the “hanging” of Lount and Matthews. Over the years he has given many talks at public schools, high schools, and colleges about history events.\n\nAthol has been a Town Crier since 2015 and served on the Board of Directors of the OntarioGuild of Town Criers for three terms. He is currently the Town Crier of Fenelon Falls and Bobcaygeon. As Bonnie Prince Charlie he has led the Port Perry Tartan Day Parade every year since its inception, which has involved the dedication of the colours of the 78th Fraser Highlanders many times. Along with Bill Burnett, Athol organized the Barrie Highland Games for many years.\n\nAthol has been a registered Town Crier with Her Majesty’s Pageant Master Bruno Peek and as such has organized and participated in all of his events such as the Global Cry for Peace (Newmarket) the Vimy, VE and VJ day events, and most recently organized and carried out one of only three registered Platinum Jubilee Beacon events in Canada in the small village of Bobcaygeon. This event and Athol’s name were included in the book presented to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle. Each of the organizers was presented with a certificate and a Platinum Jubilee medal authorized by Bruno Peek to commemorate their work in carrying out the event.\n\nAthol’s archaeological experience includes excavations in Spain and Ontario. In Spain he participated in the underwater excavation of a Roman town off the coast of Tarragona. In Ontario he has taken part in digs of First Nations sites as Elder under Dr. Ron Williamson and Dr. Bob Burgar and has served as intuitive archaeologist with Charles Garrad on Huron sites. He played a significant role in the repatriation and re-burial of First Nations remains formerly held in the Royal Ontario Museum.\n\nHe was involved in the research for the reconstruction of Ste-Marie Among the Hurons. He also performed research and located buildings and artifacts for Black Creek Pioneer Village. Athol, as chair of the Committee from Mnjikaning First Nation, worked with Parks and Heritage Canada to have the fish weirs declared a National Historic Site and developed an interpretive plan for the site.\n\nPresently Athol is the Chair of both the Municipal Heritage Committee and the Culture and Heritage Network of the City of Kawartha Lakes and was the Vice-Chair of the Cultural Centre Taskforce which carried out the Feasibility Study for a cultural hub within the city of Kawartha Lakes. This study was accepted by the City of Kawartha Lakes in June 2022.\n\nAthol Hart has contributed untold volunteer hours over the course of forty years. He has been honoured by the Ontario Historical Society with their Carnochan Award for lifetime achievement in the field of heritage (2015) and received the Lieutenant Governor’s Ontario Heritage Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2013. He also received Newmarket’s Arts, Heritage and Culture Award in 2018 and the Member of Parliament’s Canada 150 Medal for contributions to the community in 2017."
