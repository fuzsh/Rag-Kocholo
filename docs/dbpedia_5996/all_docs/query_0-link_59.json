        "text": "§ Mr. Edward Heath (Bexley)\n\nI beg to move, to leave out from \"That\" to the end of the Question and to add instead thereof: this House rejects Her Majesty's Government's proposals for the Territorial Army outlined in Command Paper No. 2855 as shortsighted, ill-conceived and tantamount to the destruction of the Force. This is a very important debate. The Government's proposals to abolish the Territorial Army as we know it and to substitute the Army Volunteer Reserve, which was described in the White Paper published yesterday, have aroused deep hostility throughout the country. This hostility is not confined to the Territorial Army. Those of us who know it and are connected with it know how strongly they feel. The hostility, however, goes much wider than that.\n\nI ought, perhaps, to declare my interest, although it is, I think, known to the House, that for four years I commanded a regiment of the Honourable Artillery Company, the oldest regiment in the British Army, and I am still a member of the Honourable Artillery Company. I have to acknowledge that that regiment is included in Part II of Annex B to be retained, although, I do not doubt, in a different shape from what it is at present. My concern, however, is just as great with the remainder of the Territorial Army as it is with the H.A.C.\n\nThis spontaneous outbreak of hostility is not due to the fact that the Government have embarked on the path of reform. Over the last 20 years there have been many changes in the structure and rôle of the Territorial Army. There has been redeployment of units to meet modern requirements. The Territorial Army itself accepts the need for further 1476 change. This has been made clear by the Council of the Territorial and Auxiliary Forces Associations. It is well appreciated by the members of the Territorial Army.\n\nThe Secretary of State knows that a number of detailed schemes for reform have been put forward. Certainly, we on this side—and, I believe, the whole House—will support the reform of the Territorial Army. Let me add at this point that we agree that there should be a rationalisation of the reserve arrangements. We took steps to this end when we were in power, and we support this rationalisation. In particular, we accept the need in modern times for the older and admittedly cumbersome procedure of proclamation to be replaced by Queen's Order. We shall, of course, need to look at this in detail when the legislation comes forward, and, in particular, the safeguards which it embodies, but we accept the proposal in principle.\n\nIt is not reform that causes the hostility and arouses opposition throughout the country. It is the abolition of the Territorial Army as an auxiliary force and the substitution of the Army Volunteer Reserve to provide reserves for the Regular Army and for N.A.T.O. which has stirred up so much opposition to the Government's policy, as, I think, they now realise. There are many reasons for this, and I should like to put forward some of them.\n\nThere is, first, the way that this whole matter has been handled by the Secretary of State from May until the presentation of the White Paper yesterday. There is the failure sufficiently to explain or justify the military grounds on which such a far-reaching decision has been taken. There are the contradictory statements in the White Paper about the lack of a home defence rôle for the old force and about the equipment for the new Reserve. There are the doubts about the real financial savings which are going to be achieved. If there is to be such a scheme, there are doubts about the attractiveness of the types of units proposed for many of the volunteers. There are doubts whether sufficient numbers will come forward for these sorts of units and, if they do not, there are anxieties as to what the next step will be. Does it logically lead to the reintroduction of some form of conscription to meet the needs of defence?\n\n1477 There are doubts about the distribution of units under the scheme in different parts of the country. There are doubts as to why some of the strongest areas of recruitment apparently receive a low proportion of the new establishment. There are fears about the effects on Regular recruiting to which the Territorial Army and, let it be said at once, the Regulars serving with them have always contributed substantially.\n\nThere is also the disbelief that anyone can be so certain about the nature of future warfare as to entitle him to be as dogmatic as the Secretary of State is about the need to abolish the Territorial Army.\n\nThere is the widespread belief that these proposals are based on a purely political decision to reduce expenditure by £20 million by the year 1970 which has fallen on the Territorial Army without any regard to a proper assessment of the needs of national defence at home, and I must add that the White Paper confirms that impression by its slipshod and inconsistent approach.\n\nHowever, there is something deeper than all these factors underlying the hostility today. I believe that it is a deep-seated instinct in the British people that a disciplined, effective volunteer force widely spread across the country is required and still required today to deal with both the foreseeable and the unforeseen in time of emergency, stress and war. There is also a deep-seated belief that from that other benefits flow which are not to be ignored, however funny they may appear to the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, West (Dr. Bray). There are the opportunities for voluntary service, for developing the individual's potentiality and for reinforcing the life of the community. Anyone who has ever been associated with the Territorial Army, with local government or with employers and trade unionists in the Territorial Army, knows the values of that reinforcement of communal life. That is essentially true of the more remote parts of these islands. I remember during my tour of the Highlands in September that the subject of the Territorial Army was raised with me far more than any other single subject, political or non-political, Now, five Highland battalions as well as five Lowland battalions are to go.\n\n1478 I must say that I am surprised not to see the Liberal Members for the Highland constituencies in their places. I hope that when it comes to the Division later tonight they will be accompanying their colleagues into the Lobby supporting the views which have been expressed already by representatives of the Liberal Party. If they are not there, one can only deduce that the thought of the dissolution of the Liberal Party at an election as a result of the defeat of the Government tonight is more abhorrent to them than the dissolution of the Territorial Army.\n\nI want now to concentrate on some of the individual points which I have mentioned. The first of them is the handling of the affair by the Secretary of State. Time and again, both in Ministerial speeches and in this year's Defence White Paper, the Government have stated that the Defence Review and the Civil Defence Review would be completed before decisions of the present kind were taken. It was stated quite clearly in paragraph 2, right at the beginning of the White Paper: The present Government has therefore set in train a series of studies on defence policy; these will cover the effects on force levels and capabilities of a number of different possible courses of action. In the light of these studies it will be possible to review our strategy, taking into account not only the economic position, but also new or reaffirmed political objectives which our strategy must be designed to implement. It went on in paragraph 23: The need is for highly trained and versatile forces and for Reserves of the same high quality, organised for the requirements and priorities of the future. The current N.A.T.O. force planning exercise is directly related to this problem. They have repeatedly stated that it was part of the whole picture of defence.\n\nWe have still had no Defence Review. The Secretary of State has now promised it in the next White Paper. There has been no Civil Defence Review. There has been no report on commitments such as those mentioned in paragraph 2 of the White Paper. No strategy has been outlined on how these commitments, which so far we are not aware of, will meet them. There have been no decisions on the N.A.T.O. force planning exercise, if I understand correctly the reports from the Paris meeting yesterday. Yet the decisions on the Reserves and the Territorial Army in particular were announced 1479 on 29th July, 1965. Any decision that the Territorial Army had no home defence rôle must have been made well before that for the rest of the White Paper to be produced.\n\nThe whole approach has been inconsistent with the Government's own declared objectives of completing the Defence Review, the Civil Defence Review and the N.A.T.O. force planning exercise before making any decisions about the future of the Territorial Army.\n\nThe decisions, when they were made prematurely, were made without proper consultation with the Council of the Territorial and Auxiliary Forces Associations about their own proposals which they had put forward in May. The White Paper speaks of discussions with the Associations and says that the views that they have expressed have been \"carefully considered\". But it is also quite apparent that after that consideration, very little notice has been taken of any of the views put forward by the Territorial Associations or the representatives of the Territorial Army, and I understand that in any case the question of the future rôle of the Territorial Army was specifically excluded from the discussions.\n\nSo much for the handling or mishandling of the affair. Now let us look at the scheme itself. Let us look at what is involved and try to get some general picture other than the plain figures and the numbers set out in the White Paper.\n\nAs I understand it, all the Territorial Army divisions and brigades and 127 units will disappear. Ninety per cent. of the Territorial units, 95 per cent. of the armoured, 91 per cent. of the gunners and 81 per cent. of the infantry are to be disbanded. Those are enormous figures. A thousand drill halls out of 1,300 are to be closed down. That is the impact on community life up and down the country. Seventy-three thousand men, or 67 per cent. of the present strength, will not be required. I understand that the Under-Secretary of State for Defence for the Army said in Edinburgh in September that there would be a place for every man. We now see that 73,000 of the present voluntary strength is not required. How extraordinary it is that the Government believe that they are in a position today to rebuff voluntary effort on that scale.\n\n§ Mr. Heath\n\nThe hon. Gentleman can discuss Civil Defence at some other time if he wants to. What I am setting out is the general principle that the country needs a degree of Civil Defence, an effective organisation in which the Territorial Army today plays a part.\n\nThe second function is that of internal security. What is to replace the Territorial Army here in times of tension, in times of emergency, and during the early stages of a war if the deterrent is not used immediately? Is it really believed that the police alone are able to do this, under-staffed as our police forces regrettably often are? I do not believe that any arrangements have yet been made to deal with all these items which are now carried out by the Territorial Army.\n\nWhat is the answer? The Secretary of State may say, \"It will be up to the Regular Forces in this country to continue to carry out these two duties.\" But the Regular Forces in this country consist of the Strategic Reserve, which may well be deployed elsewhere, and the headquarters and training battalions, which will be required for their normal tasks, or to be trained for use elsewhere to back up the Strategic Reserve in time of emergency. If this is his answer, the real question is, first, whether there is a home defence rôle at all and, secondly, whether it should be filled by the Territorial Army.\n\n1485 Here we are faced with a most extraordinary situation. The Government came to the conclusion that there was no home defence rôle for the Territorial Army. This was announced on 29th July and confirmed by the noble Lord the Minister of State for Disarmament in another place on 23rd November, 1965, when he said that this decision was taken because the Territorial Army would no longer be needed for home defence. That is a perfectly clear statement, although it is to be noticed that it does not appear in the White Paper that we are discussing today. Other reasons for taking decisions concerning the Territorial Army are set out, but not that one. In paragraph 4 of the White Paper we read these remarkable words: The Government are, however, continuing their examination of how best to secure appropriate provision for home defence and what contribution military units might best make towards this. They will announce their conclusions in due course. That statement admits that a home defence rôle exists. The Government say that they are now considering how to fill it, but in the meantime they have decided to abolish the Territorial Army which carries out this task at the moment. This is an irresponsible approach to the question of home defence.\n\nUnder the new arrangements the Strategic Reserve will be required for duties elsewhere, and other units will be required for deployment. The Army Volunteer Reserve, under this scheme, has to fill up the Regular Army and logistic units will support the Regular Army. The gap is in home defence and in the lack of any structure in which any sort of expansion can thereafter take place. Our belief is that this gap, both in home defence and in a structure for expansion, must be filled. No one can be absolutely certain either about the nature or the beginning of the next major war in which we shall be involved, or its location; nor can anyone be absolutely certain of the extent to which we shall require orthodox forces. Incidentally, it was the orthodox forces on which the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues used to put so much emphasis when they were in Opposition.\n\nNobody can be absolutely certain that there will not be a need for an expansion of our existing forces. In fact, this 1486 is an insurance policy which is absolutely essential against the dangers of uncertainty. It is worth drawing the attention of the House to the letter in The Times on 14th December, signed by six field marshals, dealing with this point. It says: Twice in this century the Territorial Army has been the framework for military expansion in dire emergency. Neither World War developed according to the original expectations of the political experts and their military advisers at those times. Nothing is more certain than that any future war will develop along unexpected lines. [An HON. MEMBER: \"What did Lord Montgomery say?\"] Lord Montgomery made his views quite clear in the House of Lords debate.\n\nSo, putting it at what the Secretary of State no doubt likes to think of at its lowest, the Territorial Army is an essential insurance policy against the uncertainties of future warfare, and it is required to meet the home defence requirement for which the right hon. Gentleman admits there is a place. I therefore urge him to think again on these lines. There is a rôle for a reformed Territorial Army. A variety of schemes have been put forward. General Sir Brian Horrocks, in the Glasgow Herald today, has put forward a two-tier scheme. I am not wedded to that, because I do not think that it is satisfactory to try to create a two-tier arrangement within Territorial Army units. A scheme has been put forward for county columns, which would be available to deal with civil defence and internal security, and would fulfil a home defence rôle if required in an emergency.\n\nWhat is required today is that the home defence rôle should be quickly settled in the context of the Defence Review, and that the Territorial Army should be reorganised to meet it. What is not justifiable is the bringing forward of the proposals in this White Paper to abolish the Territorial Army in the meanwhile, and then, our having lost a precious asset, for the Government to find themselves in the position of having to build up an alternative to carry out the home defence rôle. The action taken by the Secretary of State is short-sighted and the scheme which has been put forward is ill conceived. The proposals are tantamount to the destruction of the Territorial Army and should be firmly rejected by the House today.\n\n§ Mr. Mulley\n\nI do not have the facts about the size of the T.A. Reserve of officers at the moment—[HON. MEMBERS: \"Why not?\"] The list in Annex A concerns all the major reserves, Regular and Territorial, and I thought that that would be all that the House would require—[HON. MEMBERS: \"Oh.\"] Detailed questions of this sort can be answered if required.\n\nCan anyone doubt the need for a reorganisation? I was glad to note that the right hon. Gentleman at least paid lip service to this need. The Territorial Council put it in this way in their statement, published on 22nd July, a week before my right hon. Friend made his statement to the House: The reorganisation of the present Reserves is clearly unsatisfactory on the grounds that the proliferation of types of reserve from the original Territorial Army has led to duplication and waste…and that it was created for a purpose that no longer exists. When the right hon. Gentleman pays tribute to the Territorial Council, he should weigh those words. Again, The Times on Tuesday last said: That a reorganisation of the Territorial Army was long overdue is disputed by nobody. As with all difficult reforms, the longer it is deferred the more drastic the changes prescribed become in relation to the existing framework. 1492 The distinguished field marshal who did not sign the letter to The Times on the same day has said: The re-shaping should have been carried out ten years ago or more when we were definitely in the age of the hydrogen bomb but nobody in those days would grasp the nettle. He went on to give us credit for grasping this nettle and said we found it very, very prickly. I can agree with that, but I assure him and the House we intend to follow the traditional advice—we shall continue to grasp it firmly. Our approach in formulating our proposals was the same as Haldane's when he said: No Army is worth anything which is not ready to take the field.\"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 25th February, 1907; c. 1285.] Our essential purpose was to create a viable and available reserve for the Regular Army, and I venture to suggest that no Army in peace-time has been so stretched or called upon to perform so many varied tasks in every part of the world as the British Army has done in recent years and is still doing.\n\nSpecifically we need, first, some individuals and a few units to reinforce the Regular Army at any time, corresponding exactly to the present \"Ever Readies\"—the Special Army V.R. Secondly, such reinforcements in Europe for NATO as our commitments require: and thirdly, reinforcements as may be required in major operations outside Europe.\n\nThe House will not, I am sure, wish me to repeat the arguments and information set out in the White Paper. However, there are one or two points I feel I should amplify—the choice of name, consultation with the T.A. Council and Associations, changes in the original plan and the basis of the liabilities to be undertaken.\n\nI confess I had a slight personal preference for the title \"Territorial Reserve\" but after consultations with Army Commands and the T.A. Council and Associations it became clear that the title \"Army Volunteer Reserve\" was preferred by the majority and we have thus adopted it. It also accurately and simply describes the new Reserve. Inevitably it was not so easy to accept all the other views we received from the Council and the Associations. We have, however, been in consultation with them a great deal since August, and I should explain, although I make no complaint about it, that these 1493 consultations account for the publication of the White Paper being a little later than was at first envisaged.\n\nI hope no hon. Member will charge us with inadequate consultation on the one hand and chide us for delay on the other without at least being aware of the inconsistency of his argument.\n\nWe had no consultations before my right hon. Friend made his statement on 29th July because we thought it right that these proposals should first be announced to the House, and indeed we had been properly urged to follow this course by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bedford (Mr. Soames), speaking for the Opposition.\n\nI rather gathered from the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition that he did not agree that we should have first told the House what we intended to do in this matter. He preferred that we should have consulted the Council before the House, but I cannot accept that this is a proper course for the Government to follow.\n\nSince there has been some publicity about this consultation I should say a word about the part played in the discussions by the Council of Territorial and Auxiliary Forces Associations. The Council is the representative body of Associations which are constituted by the Auxiliary Forces Act, 1953. Each Association has a statutory duty to make itself acquainted with, and conform to, the plan of the Defence Council for the organisation of all Her Majesty's Forces within its area, and to render advice and assistance.\n\nAccordingly, the Council recognised that the framework of the new Reserve and its shape and scope were the responsibility of the Government. We have, however, received much help on the details of its implementation and I wish to express my thanks to all who have given so freely of their time to participate in these discussions. The T.A. has depended a great deal on the Associations and we hope very much to have their assistance in launching and maintaining the new Reserve.\n\n§ Mr. Mulley\n\nA check On HANSARD will show that I did not refer to any hon. Members having said this—it was an attitude of mind—but if any hon. Member thinks that I have, I willingly withdraw it. It has often been argued in the public Press and elsewhere that the saving we are making is exactly equal to the egg subsidy, and whether that is called chicken feed, I leave it to hon. Members opposite to decide.\n\nThe right hon. Gentleman asked why we did not wait until everything else was settled before deciding our reserve requirements. The argument is plausible, 1501 but does not bear close examination. Our N.A.T.O. commitment is known. Much has been said about insurance against the unforeseen which, by definition, cannot be quantified at the end of the Defence Review, or at any other time. The insurance policy argument which was deployed with great enthusiasm by the right hon. Gentleman, is surely contrary to the experience of every one of us. I know of no insurance company—although I bow to the superior commercial knowledge of some hon. Members opposite—which will issue a policy without a very precise specification of the risks to be insured against. One cannot take out an insurance policy against the unforeseen, the unknown—[HON. MEMBERS: \"Rain.\"] If hon. Members opposite are suggesting that in this country rain is such a remote contingency that it is unforeseen or cannot be measured, they should look at the weather statistics. I should have thought it very simple to work out the probability.\n\nUnavoidably, this reorganisation takes time, there was inevitable speculation among those in the T.A. about their future, as well as a clear desire for change, and we thought they were entitled to know our intentions at the earliest moment. After Opposition spokesmen have pressed week by week for a statement before the Recess, it ill becomes them to complain because they get one.\n\nThe right hon. Gentleman referred to the effect of this reorganisation on Regular Army recruiting. We are, of course, aware that in some parts of the country this will make the task of Regular recruiting more difficult. The right hon. Gentleman gave a figure of 7,000 last year as between the Territorial Army and the Army Cadet Force, I think he said. Last year the Territorial Army itself produced only around 1,300 or 1,400, and the rest of his 7,000 came from the Army Cadet Force. We are only too willing to carry on the work of the Army Cadet Force.\n\nThe allegations that we have made no arrangements for home defence, and insufficient provision for expansion of our forces to meet a 1914 or 1939 type of emergency, are the most vociferous arguments against our proposals, and the right hon. Gentleman employed them to full effect. But what is meant by \"home defence\"? The argument is muddled by 1502 all the double talk indulged in by the last Government with the Territorial Army on this subject. Two-thirds of the T.A. is at present assigned a home defence rôle, and other units are in the order of battle as line-of-communications troops in Germany. In neither case do they need their guns, their armoured cars or mortars. But they were never told this.\n\nIn the 1957 White Paper, the then Government said: The Territorial Army will, as at present, be trained and equipped as a fighting force primarily assigned to the task of home defence. Under present plans Britain is due to provide two Territorial Army divisions as reinforcements for NATO. Since these certainly would not be ready for action on the Continent in less than three months, which in nuclear war would be of little value, the Government consider that it would be more appropriate to assign them to home defence duties like the rest of the Territorial Army. The three months mentioned is clearly an under-statement for the T.A. as a whole.\n\nThe deliberate policy of the last Government starved the T.A. of equipment—and it is equipment, not manpower, which so severely limits the T.A.'s capacity to expand. Men could be trained much more quickly than the equipment could be provided. The 1960 T.A. reorganisation was based, again, on this undefined home defence requirement, but still Ministers went to great pains to conceal their real rôles from the individual units. Usually, only one year in four was spent in the home defence rôle, although they had no place in the order of battle, no other operational rôle.\n\nThe obsolete armoured vehicles, guns and mortars were just window dressing. Surely none, except perhaps the right hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West, believes we should provide forces specifically for home defence in the sense of defence against a seaborne or airborne invasion? Certainly the previous Government did not, or why did they abolish Anti-Aircraft Command in 1954? Why was the anti-aircraft rôle of the Territorial Army in the defence of the United Kingdom virtually abolished in 1960? Why was Fighter Command drastically reduced so that for every eight fighter aircraft we had in 1951 to defend this country from attack there was only one when we returned to office last year? Obviously the previous Government believed neither in home defence in this sense nor in the 1503 need to have a framework for expansion. Actions speak louder than words.\n\nWhat then of the other sense of home defence—aid to the civil authorities, particularly in the maintenance of law and order, before and after a nuclear holocaust—what is generally known as civil defence? Home security would perhaps be a more apt description. This is quite another matter. In the appalling event of such an attack, the requirement for help of all kinds would be unlimited. Military units would have a part to play; and there are at any time a substantial number of regular units of all three Services in this country. However, all aspects of civil defence are under examination within the Government, and our conclusions will be announced in due course. [HON. MEMBERS: \"When?\"]\n\n§ Sir J. Smyth\n\nThen I should never believe that that is what will happen. The White Paper tells us in paragraph (4) that if nuclear weapons were used\"— and it is presumed that they will be— …the United Kingdom would be a target for massive attack. The damage in this case would be so great and widespread that the present Territorial Army would be unable to offer assistance…\". It is a matter of opinion whether Great Britain would be one of the prime military targets. If the Russians were to have any chance whatever of competing with the United States in a nuclear war, it would be essential for them to have first strike and in that first strike to knock out quite a large part of the much more massive nuclear launching site armoury of the United States. Whether we should have a dose of nuclear bombs or not is a matter of opinion. But my point is that it is just when there is widespread damage that the Territorial Army will be called in. When the ordinary civil defence services cannot cope, the Territorial Army will be of the most use.\n\nI have no quarrel with the Government over their reorganisation of our reserves, and I think that certain changes and reorganisations in the Territorial Army are needed. But, as my right hon. Friend pointed out, what they propose is the virtual destruction of the greater part of the Territorial Army. This I regard as an act of supreme folly, for a saving of what is estimated at about £20 million between now and 1969. I am not blaming the Government for conducting a review of defence expenditure. I have several times said in the House that our defence expenditure could easily escalate to £3,000 million a year and yet we would not necessarily get greater security. My quarrel is with their priorities. Subsidising eggs, for instance, costs us £32 million a year and free prescriptions cost nearly £50 million a year. One must relate these different calls on our resources one to another. As my right hon. Friend said, the Territorial Army is much more than just part of our military defences. It is part of our way of life in this country. It certainly has a great effect on recruiting. I have found no one to agree with the Minister that his proposals will not 1508 adversely affect recruiting to the Regular Army, and I wonder whether he has it in his mind to reintroduce conscription.\n\nThe Secretary of State has ordained what the next war will be like. He poses no alternative between the quick and the dead. On Tuesday, in a leading article, The Times rightly said that he should re-examine the requirements of home security, asking, Is it so certain today that the alternatives lie exclusively between the sort of overseas operation envisaged and stark nuclear obliteration of the British Isles?\". But the oracle has spoken, and the same ideas are given out by junior Ministers in this House and in another place, as I heard, listening to the debate on the Territorial Army there the other day.\n\nOn 24th November last, the Deputy Secretary of State for Defence and Minister of Defence for the Army said in the House: …we do not believe that an attack against the United Kingdom is likely and we cannot afford to pay the heavy premium that preparation against any contingency would cost us.\"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 24th November, 1965; Vol. 721, c. 482.] I find that a very alarming statement, and I hope that all hon. Members will think the same. Speaking for the Government in the other place, a few days ago, Lord Chalfont said that the next war would be a nuclear one and, therefore, an invasion of Britain would be the least of his worries. Yet, only two or three years ago all Labour spokesmen in the House, and Lord Chalfont, who was then political correspondent of The Times, were saying that there would be a large conventional war on the Continent and that we must have many more men there. The figure of 80,000 was suggested at the Opposition Dispatch Box in the defence debate in 1963, and the Labour Party spokesman went very wide in telling us how the operations would go, with the Russians sweeping on to the Rhine before we could arrive at the Weser, and so on. Now, in order to fit in with the right hon. Gentleman's theories about the Territorial Army all that has been scrapped.\n\nIn former days, before the advent of massive air armadas, the British Navy was our safeguard against invasion. The right hon. Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg), now the Paymaster-General, whom I advised that I proposed to mention him, not like Mark Antony, to bury 1509 Caesar but to praise him, always used to be considered just about the greatest expert in the Labour Party on these matters. Indeed, I have heard him so described on television. In the Army Estimates debate as recently as 9th March, 1964, the right hon. Gentleman paid a great tribute to those dedicated people who were keeping the Territorial Army going and preparing for an emergency which we all hoped would not occur. He went on to say: I hold the view that the Territorial Army is one of the most important sections of the Armed Forces\"— I am sure that he believed that— In my judgment, it is far more, infinitely more, important than the Navy. I would get rid of the Navy tomorrow and spend the money on the Territorial Army.\"—[OFFICIAL RLPORT, 9th March, 1964; Vol. 691, c. 58.]\n\n§ Sir J. Smyth\n\nThe right hon. Gentleman must address himself to the point I am making. He goes off at a tangent. What I am saying is that there was very great danger of sabotage at the beginning of the last war, that there will be such danger in any future emergencies, and that it must be countered. I want to know the plans of the Secretary of State for any future occasions.\n\n1511 The second lesson I learned from getting the command of a first line Territorial brigade. This was the Manchester Brigade in the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division. It was a magnificent division with a wonderful record at Gallipoli in the First World War and with tremendous spirit and comradeship. The morale of these Lancashire battalions was tremendous. I have the greatest admiration for them. But that division is to be wiped out. I believe that one unit out of nine is to remain. All the training they did together and everything else is to be destroyed. Although, of course, the division was a bit short on training compared with a regular formation, nevertheless these men in the last war fought their way back from Belgium to Dunkirk and acquitted themselves extremely well.\n\nBut the third lesson is much the most important for the future. It emerges from the job of the Territorial Army and all the troops who were in Great Britain at the time. The job of the returned B.E.F., of the first and second line Territorial divisions and of all the new divisions that were in training was to counter any invasion of Britain. The brigade I commanded was employed on every sort of job. We were on the beaches and on the Yorkshire Moors, and in charge of nine aerodromes, for which duties we were equipped with buses.\n\nThe thing we feared more than anything else—far more than landings on the beaches—was a night bombing attack on all the fighter aerodromes with heavy concentrations of mustard gas—which had not but might easily have been used—followed at dawn next morning by an attack by the Luftwaffe, drawing off Fighter Command and covering crash landings of troop-carrying aircraft, together with parachute troop landings all over the country. That was what we were really frightened of, but of course it never came.\n\nField Marshal Goering was an airman himself and he wanted to have to his credit the defeat of the R.A.F. in the Battle of Britain, and any sort of invasion operation had to follow the defeat of Fighter Command. But do not let us forget that some of the places that we thought the Germans more likely to land were with straight main roads. 1512 We have become much more vulnerable to that sort of attack now because of the enormous number of new motorways. They are made to measure for landing troop carrying aircraft by men who do not mind killing perhaps 100 or more people in cars in the process. It is no good our thinking that, because that was not done in the last war, it will never be attempted in future. We had all these troops to prevent it happening then.\n\nEvery responsible nation would fall over backwards rather than start a nuclear war but even if the next war is nuclear, as the Secretary of State believes it will be, that does not mean that there will not be periods of great tension between nations and even large scale conventional operations such as we are getting in Vietnam. One of these operations could easily be the occupation by air of a defenceless Britain in a vast continental air landing operation. People may laugh at that idea but it was a distinct possibility in 1940 and we must bear it in mind in considering the safety of the country.\n\nEvery war turns out to be quite different, in its beginnings and every other way, from what was expected and so every wise commander keeps a reserve, and for 60 years our reserve has been the Territorial Army. To throw it overboard just when it is so important that we should remain so obviously strong and secure at home would be letting down our N.A.T.O. allies and encouraging an aggressor to overthrow N.A.T.O. by the back door.\n\nI seriously advise the Secretary of State to hang on to that £20 million and make the saving which he proposes to make in the Territorial Army in something less vital. It was said of the First World War that Admiral Jellicoe was the only man who could have lost the war in one afternoon. The Secretary of State for Defence is the only man who could lose the next war in the Division Lobby tonight.\n\n§ Mr. Bellenger\n\nWe know that something like 80 per cent. of the Territorial Army was engaged in pseudo-defence duties. I do not think that is enough and, if it were, there would be no reason for disbanding the Territorial Army. Her Majesty's Government have not told us what the rôle of civil defence is to be. They must take that criticism, because I am one of those people who believe that we ought to have it put before us and not have a White Paper dealing with one part of our military force in isolation. I have appealed for a defence committee of this House year after year, where hon. Members knowing something about these matters could discuss them in secrecy and with expert advisers to give estimates of the strategic position, thus enabling us to form opinions of the balance of forces which we require.\n\nI have no objection to the change in the procedure for calling up reserves. But the House ought to be under no misapprehension. Whether one calls it a Queen's Order or a Proclamation it is really a call to arms. If this happens one is in a position where all these little reserves will fit into a much bigger picture. Hon. Members will remember what happened before the last war, when conscription was brought in and when the 1517 Territorial Army was doubled in a night, creating, incidentally, quite a lot of confusion for Mr. Hore-Belisha. It is probable that the House would be asked, in those circumstances to go back to conscription. In the event of total war, such as a Queen's Order would envisage, one must have total mobilisation of the forces throughout the country otherwise there is an imbalance such as we had in the First World War, with reserved occupations and so forth. It is some time since I was at the War Office, but I do not think that today we are as fully advanced in preparations for any kind of war as we were in 1914.\n\nMy right hon. Friend was quite right about Lord Haldane. He was a man of immense thought and not only did he bring in the Territorial Reserve, but he also prepared the Regular Army which saved this country—the \"Contemptible Little Army\"—when it was faced by the hordes of the Kaiser. Everything was prepared in advance, at least everything that could be foreseen. There were special orders for movement of all sorts of forces in anticipation of the main threat, which we knew would come from Germany. It is recorded in The Times today that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence said yesterday in N.A.T.O. that it might even be necessary in years to come, I do not know how many years, for the balance of our forces to be changed from Europe to the Far East.\n\nThat is a very interesting statement, because it only confirms what I have been demanding, that this House should have a much wider survey of the military situation than we have at present. If my right hon. Friend is right, and he could have been mis-reported or his words taken out of context, how are we going to discuss the Defence Estimates when they come in early next year? Not on the information vouchsafed by previous Secretaries of State and other military Ministers in the past.\n\nThe powers given to the Secretary of State, in paragraph 11, to call up reserves seem to be pretty wide. The House will want to know quite a lot when the Secretary of State puts his signature to the call-up of reserves, not only for B.A.O.R. but farther afield. When it does he is going to tell them nothing about the 1518 period of call up—\"We will take every case on its merits\". I wonder whether in those circumstances the Army is going to get young men to volunteer. This is quite a different thing from taking on obligations merely to serve in the Territorial force. It may be that the young men have thought, because of the circumstances of the local drill hall and so on, that the war would be fought round their particular area. Perhaps my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will say something about the powers for which he is asking in that paragraph.\n\nI welcome the paragraph about the training and equipment of new reserves. It has been a scandal in the past few years that the Territorial Army has been denied proper equipment. How can we have trained men if they know very little about the equipment which they will have to use? It reminds me of the year preceding the outbreak of the last war, perhaps this may not be taken too well by hon. Members opposite, when, for the anti-aircraft defence of London we had seven 3.7 guns. That was why the right hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Sandys) tried to raise in the House the issue of our unpreparedness—he was serving with a territorial regiment—and was nearly court martialled for so doing. That is why, in spite of what my right hon. Friend says, I cast doubts on the belief that we are prepared for an emergency.\n\nI said that I should support my right hon. Friends in the Lobby. May I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Toxteth (Mr. Crawshaw), whose well-meant remarks about abstaining have been given great publicity, that this is not the last word. The Bill has yet to be presented, and that will be the time for us to examine the Government's intentions in detail. However it does not matter much, I suppose, in view of our small majority, whether we have a majority of two or three, so long as the Government get approval for what they are proposing.\n\nWhat I regret most is the absence of a defence committee of this House. If we had one, more hon. Members would be able to make well-informed speeches and it might save the Government a good deal of trouble which they are involved in tonight and in which they possibly will be involved in future. Germany, which now has the biggest force on the 1519 Continent—12 divisions—has an all-party defence committee in its Bundestag. It can call for officers or anybody else whom it wants to give evidence. It saves the German Government a good deal of trouble, even though it is a Government with which the Opposition, the S.P.D., disagrees.\n\nMy right hon. Friends must not presume too much on the good will of some of their supporters. I say to them quite frankly that when we come to the Defence Estimates we shall want a better balance sheet than we have had tonight. Otherwise, there might be abstentions on the Estimates. These are serious matters. I am not concerned with all the sentiment which has grown up around them. I am concerned, as I have always been concerned, with the true defence of our country. Therefore, if the Government want my approval, they have to present me, as a shareholder in this country, as one of the citizens of this country, with a proper balance sheet so that I can examine the assets as well as the liabilities.\n\n§ Mr. Hugh Fraser (Stafford and Stone)\n\nMost Members will regret the speech made by the Deputy-Secretary of State. Unfortunately, he did not rise to the occasion. This is a very serious occasion for the country and the House. There are not only Members on this side of the House but 20 right hon. and hon. Members opposite who serve with the Territorial Army. This is a very wide issue which has been put forward by the right hon. Gentleman in the narrowest, meanest and most political of senses.\n\nWe have to rise to the level of events which this country has to face. I am not prepared to put blame either on my party or on the Labour Party, but the Paymaster-General well knows that at this stage in our history we are faced with very grave difficulties indeed. There is complete uncertainty about the future of nuclear war. There is an absolute division among the most advanced thinkers on this subject. We are faced by the fact that the areas of disorder throughout the world are growing. We are faced with the fact that the Government, for reasons good or bad, seem determined to commit us to a rôle not merely east of Suez but south of the 1520 Sahara. We know that recruiting for the Regular Forces throughout the West is falling. No country is having greater difficulty than ours. Yet, at this stage, the Government have made the grave error of bringing forward this White Paper in such a way that it does damage to the spirit of volunteer service in this country. This is my main contention against the White Paper.\n\nSome of the other things which I believe are erroneous must be mentioned. There is the bringing forward of this White Paper before the general aspects of our global defence commitments can be seen; before the Defence Review is completed; before the structure of the Army at home is decided; before the command structure which we know should be changed has been changed; before it is clear what will happen to the Gurkha Army over the next few years. These matters are absolutely unresolved and uncertain. The White Paper deals a death blow to the spirit of voluntary service in many areas of the country. This is the burden of our attack on the Government. I will not dispute the details of the White Paper. We all hope that it will work, but we have most serious and grievous doubts about it.\n\nThe base from which these specialist volunteers are drawn is not sufficiently broad. It is far too narrow in its appeal. What is more, the White Paper destroys the territorial base which is the only possible alternative to conscription if we are to have military expansion in this country. These things are destroyed by the White Paper, and I must regard it as a matter of supreme importance to this island. It is not a party matter; it is a matter of the defence interests of our country.\n\nI come from Staffordshire as a Member of Parliament. In the north of Scotland I have the great honour to be honorary colonel of the Lovat Scouts. I hope that some of my Liberal colleagues who are my military representatives in the area will be here tonight. This is a serious matter from the point of view of recruiting. The defence of a democratic State, if it is to be based on the voluntary principle, must be an organic whole of young boys going into the cadet force, from there into the Territorial Forces and beyond that into the Regular Forces. This is the pattern which has grown up in this 1521 country, and this is the pattern which is shattered by this dogmatic and foolish document. It is broken. The pattern, once broken, will be very difficult to put together again.\n\nThe regiment of which I have the honour to be honorary colonel has had many rôles during its time. My father was fortunate enough to be in a position to create it in the Boer War. It was created because the War Office, in its great wisdom, believed that the Boers could render themselves invisible. It was in error in that. Members of the regiment were snipers in the 1914 war. The regiment then took on an armoured car rôle. Today is fulfils a light anti-aircraft rôle.\n\nOnce there is a military framework on the ground, and once there are men who are able and willing to do so, they can turn their hand to any job. This is precisely why the Government are in error tonight. They believe that the rôle, the precise order of battle, and so on, must be laid down and immutable. They talk about basing their strategy immutably upon what is agreed allied strategy because of the present interpretation of the nuclear danger.\n\nIt would be equally ludicrous to say that in the whole of the last war our strategy was based on the Maginot Line. The only strategy that this country can have is one of maximum flexibility based upon having, and continuing to have, a building up of the voluntary spirit of peacetime soldiering, because this is the only basis from which the Regular Army, the Regular Reserves, civil defence and the general defence of the country can be drawn.\n\n§ Mr. Richard Crawshaw (Liverpool, Toxteth)\n\nToday's debate is, in my view, a watershed in the life of our Armed Forces. Anything that I say is not based upon sentiment, because I do not believe 1522 that sentiment has any place in the organisation of our Armed Forces. I hope that what I say is based upon a realistic appraisal of the situation.\n\nI know that what I say will not be popular. The spending of money on defence in this country is never popular. It is only when the deficiences are noted that people start asking why we did not do so and so. Certainly, on this side of the House, it is even less popular. One sometimes gets a little tired of hearing people who constantly ask for the defences of the country to be brought down wanting, in the next speech, to know why we do not have an army in Rhodesia. I cannot believe that the proposals envisaged in the White Paper can possibly fulfil the rôle which the country is likely to have to face in the future.\n\nOne of the biggest handicaps is that we have an absence of information about what the Reserve Forces are trying to support. If I complain, I know that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence complained in similar vein on 21st November, 1963, when he said: There is in the Bill no commitment whatever as to the precise shape of the defence organisation when the Bill has been passed.\"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 21st November, 1963; Vol. 684, c. 1210.] That is exactly what I say about the White Paper that is before us.\n\nToday we are not merely putting the cart before the horse. I begin to doubt whether there is even a horse there. In fact, it looks pretty much like the Biblical phrase of the mule that hath no understanding. It is very much like asking a housewife how much money she will put into National Savings Certificates before she knows what expenses she has on the house.\n\nWe do not know what the strength of the Regular Army is to be. We hear all sorts of reports that it will be cut or increased. On what are we basing the reserves? We are told that there is to be a reappraisal of our commitments, and yet we are asked to decide what reserves we require for those commitments even before we know what they are. We cannot even find out whether there will be any civil defence in this country.\n\nThere is a line of argument, contrary to the argument of the Leader of the Opposition, that the very fact of doing 1523 away with civil defence would leave us open to military attack. There is a line of argument—I believe it to be a dangerous one—that one shows one's decision to use the atomic weapon by the mere fact of leaving oneself completely open from civil defence. That is a dangerous line of argument and one which we should not follow.\n\nTonight, we ought to be told whether we are to have civil defence. The people are entitled to know. It is not sufficient to put into a White Paper something that can mean anything or nothing and expect people to support it. We should be told categorically one way or the other.\n\nApparently, as has been pointed out, we seem to be committed in Europe to the use of the nuclear weapon from the word \"Go\". Is this really so. Unless I am very much mistaken, there are all sorts of theories about how the nuclear weapon would escalate.\n\nI believe that the time of the Cuba incident showed both America and Russia that the days of all-out atomic wars are out. In my view, the danger that confronts us is that if a situation arises in Europe that troops come into the Western part, if we cannot hold them with conventional forces we shall use tactical nuclear weapons to begin with. One supposes that either that would halt the aggressor or that he would respond in kind. One would then start using the nuclear weapon in strategic shots.\n\nThen we have that delightful terminology of what I believe is known as \"taking out\" a town. When one shows one's determination to use atomic weapons, one takes out an enemy town. Even that might not succeed, however, and we might be landed in a situation in which one of our towns is taken out. Do right hon. and hon. Members on the Government Front Bench say that there is no need for civil defence in those circumstances? Can they imagine the sort of panic that would go through the public if they knew that one of our large towns had been taken out and that the same thing was likely to happen to another at any time? Is not this exactly the sort of thing for which the Territorial Army and the Reserve Army are useful even in this country?\n\nThe idea of all-out nuclear war in Europe is getting very much more 1524 thought about. I do not know whether my right hon. Friends are acquainted with the Director of the French Institute of Strategic Studies—I think that the right hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Powell) certainly is—and a recent book of his entitled \"Deterrence and Strategy\". Having examined the situation quite fully, these are the conclusions at which that gentleman has arrived, and I ask hon. Members to remember the position he holds. He says that there is a determination by all not to have an all-out nuclear war. I do not think that anybody would dissociate himself from that view. This, he says, increases the possibility of those operations which have the least possibility of escalation. A capacity to sustain a long war is essential if only as a deterrent purpose. Therefore, there must be a long-terrm logistic system and a highly flexible echeloned mobilisation system.\n\nWhat is the conclusion to which that gentleman comes? Speaking this year, in 1965, he says that all these add up to a good cause for the organisation in France of a real militia alongside the permanent fighting forces.\n\nThat is a conclusion arrived at by him, and I do not know how many hon. Gentlemen saw in The Guardian this week the following little item which I feel is pertinent to the occasion. It said: West Germany calls up men for Home Guard. West Germany yesterday announced a call-up for former members of the Bunderwehr because of a shortage of volunteers for reserve service. Ten thousand men up to the age of 45 will be called up in batches of 1,000 for a total of 15 days' training. The Territorial Reserves—now to be named the Home Guard—are the only West German units not integrated in NATO. They are raised on a local basis to guard military installations and communication lines. I think that the last sentence is the most important one.\n\nThe Defence Ministry plans to have 50,000 trained reserves by the end of 1966, but only 5,500 suitable men have volunteered. What a disgrace to the country it is to talk about axing 73,000 people who have volunteered.\n\nWe hear that there is never going to be any need for any large-scale mobilisation, and that is said at a time when it can be seen headlined in every newspaper: L.B.J. on the verge of a great decision. Full war in the Far East. 1525 Does anyone honestly believe that we can detach ourselves indefinitely if it comes to that?\n\nAre we really committed to an all-out nuclear war in Europe which, as I understand it, is supposed to last 30 days? If we are, we ought to start getting our thinking on to correct lines, because in answer to a Question that I put down a week ago we were told that we are spending £30 million this year on the submarine service. I am not decrying the submarine service, because it is an excellent one, but what are they doing in a 30-day war? What call is there for them? Why do we stockpile supplies in the north of Scotland if we are going to have a 30-day war which will wipe us all out? Is it because there is so much uncertainty in our thinking that the Navy is being called on to fight one sort of war and the Army another?\n\nI regret that it will be necessary to refer to one or two previous contributions that have been made in the past by my right hon. and hon. Friends, not because I think necessarily that they were very good contributions but because I do not think that people out of office should say things which are not carried out when they come into office. I never object to anyone changing his mind. I believe that everyone, including myself, is capable of being persuaded and changing his mind, but I think that anyone who does change his mind ought at least to stand up and say why.\n\nOn 16th January 1964, the Secretary of State for Defence, having said that European commitments in N.A.T.O. should be revised to take into account the real danger in Europe and not the imaginary dangers we believed existed some years ago, continued: At the same time, as the danger of global war is declining, instability in Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America seems to be growing. We would agree with that. That is precisely what is happening. He went on to say: … and it is a danger to which the whole apparatus of nuclear deterrence is totally irrelevant.\"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 16th January, 1964; Vol. 687, c. 544.] Of course it is completely irrelevant. It is a danger that can be met only by conventional forces on the ground, and pos- 1526 sibly most of my hon. Friends on this side might wonder to what extent that is now accepted.\n\n§ Mr. Crawshaw\n\nKnowing my right hon. Friend, I accept that assurance.\n\nIn case anybody might think that I should not say what I am saying today, let me add that I fought an election on certain issues, and one of those issues was set out in \"Policy for Peace\", a pamphlet issued by the Labour Party. I propose to refer to only one part of the pamphlet where it says: The West must never be the first to use the H-bomb … Britain should press urgently for the following objectives: To make it possible for N.A.T.O. to halt a local conflict with conventional weapons alone … I am glad that yesterday my right hon. Friend said that he was still trying to insist in N.A.T.O. that this should be so, because I believe that we all believe it should be so. But does not this then throw my right hon. Friend back on the argument that to say there is never going to be any need for any large-scale forces is completely irrelevant? Once we do away with the nuclear deterrent, once we make up our minds not to use it, there is only one answer, and that is large conventional forces, and by the very act of this White Paper we will lose any ability ever to build up a second Army which will be able to go overseas.\n\nIs the Secretary of State to blame for this, or is it that the task is too great? I ask this in all seriousness because I should like to remind him of what he said on 21st November, 1963 during the debate on the Defence Transfer of Functions Bill. He said: That takes me to my third major complaint, which is that the new Secretary of State for Defence is to have such a colossal range of responsibilities to cover that the prospect of his giving the time and energy required for decision on the major political issues is almost nil … nobody … is superhuman enough to carry out the manifold responsibilities of policy formation and administration imposed on the Secretary of State alone …\"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 21st November, 1963; Vol. 684, c. 1224.] I do not know whether my right hon. Friend has found that duty burdensome, or whether he has surprised himself by 1529 being one of those superhuman people who has been able to cope with the situation, but I would remind him of what he said on 22nd February, 1964. When dealing with atomic bombs, he said: The trouble about this type of expenditure is this. … one can do anything with a bayonet except sit on it, but you can do nothing with a hydrogen bomb except sit on it.\"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 26th February, 1964; Vol. 690, c. 483.] That is as true today as when he said it, and yet here we are talking glibly about giving away 73,000 volunteers, 73,000 people who could have bayonets. For what? I have not forgotten the election pledges on defence, but my right hon. Friend has decided that the stockpiles are now more useful than bayonets.\n\nPerhaps I am laying the blame at the wrong door. Judging by the Questions which they have asked, it is obvious that right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite have been intrigued about the precise responsibilities of my right hon. Friend the Paymaster-General. I think that I can solve the problem. I say this in all kindness. I am not sure that he has not been spending his time disorganising the Territorial Army. I wonder whether he is that nigger on the stockpile, because I could not quite understand how anybody could conceive this White Paper, until I found it in HANSARD. It was dated 5th March, 1964, believe it or not, when my right hon. Friend the Paymaster-General said: I am appalled by the standard of equipment of the Territorial Army. Has not the time come to consider the position of the Territorial Associations, strong, local bodies, which have done good work, but do they work well now? I suggest that, perhaps, in return for giving first-class equipment we might get a category of men—like the Army Emergency Reserve—who would accept liability for immediate service in an emergency either as individuals or in units. In return, I repeat, they should get up-to-date training and equipment. Indeed, I wonder whether the time has not come to have a smaller, more compact, highly trained and better equipped Territorial Army, with perhaps greater financial inducements and accepting a liability to recall without proclamation.\"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 5th March, 1964; Vol. 690, c. 1586.] If that is not the White Paper, what is?\n\n§ Mr. Crawshaw\n\nThere is a need for reorganisation. My hon. Friend has convinced me of that this evening.\n\n1532 My complaint is that the T.A. Associations were not consulted as to what sort of reorganisation was required. They do not object to reorganisation. All that they were told, however, was the figure that they had to work on. There was no discussion as to whether or not that figure was relevant. It was a case of asking the Associations whether they preferred to be shot or hanged—and then people wonder why they have not given the full co-operation that one might have expected of them!\n\nThere are too many headquarters with permanent staffs which are not fully occupied. The standard of training needs to be raised, as is envisaged in the White Paper. Drill halls ought to be able to accommodate several units with basic weapons, instead of being scattered all over the place as they are at the moment. There should be command centres where men can have a concentrated weekend's training under Regular Army officers and men.\n\nThere should also be a two-tier system. It could be arranged so that in a certain unit liabilities would be imposed upon some of the men for call-up at a moment's notice while the others would form a framework for an enlarged Army. This would not only reduce the cost of equipment but the cost of many drill halls. Furthermore, with greater numbers we would be able to reduce the number of people who would have to be prepared to be called up at a moment's notice. If we have not managed to attain our target with 110,000 Territorials we shall not obtain that target when we cut the number down to about 37,000.\n\nThe present proposal is bad because it destroys the basis for expansion and for dealing with anything unexpected. It is wrong to give a bounty to a man just because he volunteers, if that man is a recruit. The White Paper envisages a situation in which a man can volunteer one week and receive a bounty of £150 for the year, whether or not he is trained. That is wrong. No allowance has been made for wastage or unavailability of personnel. This proposal will have an adverse effect on recruiting for the Regular Army.\n\nI believe that this scheme will not work without the good will of the T.A. Associations. I believe that it is taking away something which has existed for many 1533 years and has formed an association between the public and the Regular Army which is almost unique. [An HON. MEMBER: \"Rubbish.\"] My hon. Friend says \"Rubbish.\" There are countries in which the Army is not looked upon as a friend. I believe that it is looked on as a friend by our people because of the very association of which I have spoken. We talk about cutting out £20 million, but even that is doubtful, because we have not been told who will pay for civil defence. Is it a case of the Army's saying, \"If we can throw the cost of civil defence on the Home Office it will be its responsibility.\" But that does not affect the taxpayer; somebody will pay for it, one way or the other.\n\nI believe that if we had the largest Navy or Air Force in the world the battles would still be won on the ground. If the theory which my right hon. Friend has put forward is wrong—if there is never to be any need for any mobilisation of large forces—we are on the road of no return. I know that some of my hon. Friends would say that we can do what is necessary by conscription, but we cannot put conscripts into units which do not exist. If, as is suggested, all our reserve forces are to plug the gaps in the Regular Army, once those gaps have been plugged there will be nothing upon which to build another Army.\n\nI ask my right hon. Friend to remember that advisers may sometimes be wrong. President Kennedy discovered that to his cost after the Bay of Pigs incident. His words on that occasion are rather important. He said: How could I have been so far off base? All my life I have known better than to depend on experts. How could I be so stupid as to let them go ahead. Looking back a year later, one Kennedy man who was deeply involved in the decision concerning the Bay of Pigs said that the military and intelligent experts were forced by the change of Administration to be salesmen and wanted to push on for some kind of action. Finally, on the same theme, President Kennedy said, All the mysteries about the Bay of Pigs have been solved but one. How could everybody involved have thought such a plan would succeed. I don't know the answer and I don't know anybody else who does. That might sum up this White Paper.\n\nMany of my hon. Friends, although perhaps not having the same sentiments as 1534 I have, are deeply disturbed about the contents of this White Paper. I believe that if there were a free vote tonight, this White Paper would not be passed. The responsibility for the inadequacy of our defences lies equally on both sides of the House. I would take a little more seriously some of the protestations from the other side of the House had they made the same protests when the Territorial Army was cut in half in 1956.\n\nThere is a tendency to try to beat the Government with a stick if one does not agree with them. Is it not about time that, on both sides of the House, we became a little more mature in these matters, instead of hurling abuse at each other. We should try to solve the country's problems on a non-party basis instead of trying to make political and party capital out of every suggestion which is put forward. If a suggestion is put forward from the other side, it is always wrong, because one had not thought of it oneself. I do not accept that in life: I have always believed that we should take what is best from whoever gives it.\n\nI believe also that the party does not always come first. This will sound like heresay to some of my hon. Friends, but I believe that the safety of the country comes before party considerations. In the 1930s, we learned about the people described as the \"guilty men\". They were listed as Baldwin—who lied to the country because he said that he would not win the election if he told the truth about defence—and Chamberlain—who won us a year at Munich, in which we did nothing to prepare ourselves for what was to come. We heard about those men, but they are not the guilty men. The guilty men are the hon. Members on both sides of the House who have used their feet in the Lobbies in order to save their seats in the country.\n\nThis is an issue upon which there can be no compromise with one's conscience. Despite much thinking about the problem, and realising the consequences which this decision may have, I believe that there is something more important than party. For that reason, I find myself unable to support the Government in the Lobby tonight.\n\n§ Sir Frank Pearson (Clitheroe)\n\nI am grateful to have the opportunity of making a short speech in this important 1535 debate and even more grateful for the opportunity of following the deeply sincere speech of the hon. Member for Liverpool, Toxteth (Mr. Crawshaw). He has expressed many of the fears and doubts which we on this side have about the White Paper. He also posed many searching questions to his right hon. Friend and we shall listen with the closest interest to the answers. We can tell from his sincerity that there is a degree of dismay on this issue throughout the country, greater than on any issue for a long time.\n\nThis dismay stems partly from the fact that the Government's White Paper and the whole of their case give no real, genuine reasons why these steps should be taken. This disillusionment springs from the fact that a great service, with great traditions, has been abolished out of hand. I was interested to note that the Deputy-Secretary of State did not deny the charge made by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition that these measures represent the abolition of the Territorial Army. With that abolition must and will go all those feelings and loyalties which for so long have been concentrated on this great voluntary organisation.\n\nI felt, when the right hon. Gentleman put his case, that he had totally failed to appreciate the spirit and feelings which make the Territorial Army work. As justification, all he could give us was the fact that the existing Territorial Army is short of equipment. He made no mention of the spirit of that force or of the fact that the Territorial Army and the Territorial Associations are the one network and organisation through which the Regular Forces of the Crown can expand in an emergency and from which they can draw their strength. The dismay and the disillusionment on this matter make the statement in the early paragraphs of the White Paper—that full consultations have taken place with the Territorial Associations and the Territorial Council—seem hollow.\n\nI have no doubt that discussions took place, but only on a very narrow front. It is fair to say that the Territorial Associations were presented with a completely clear-cut decision: on the fact that the Territorial Army was to be abolished there could be no argument. When it is 1536 accepted on all sides that some streamlining and reorganisation of the Territorial forces are necessary, it is extremely shortsighted not to approach the problem with due consultation and in such a manner that the Associations could support the Government's view.\n\nOf course, we all admit today that our overseas commitments may be curtailed and the responsibilities of N.A.T.O. altered. We all admit that the risk of large-scale war may recede and that modern weapons and strategy may demand an alteration in our reserve forces. All that could have been taken into account, but I do not believe that it is possible for the Government to put rational proposals before the House without giving us also some indication of their thoughts on these broader questions of strategy. In this respect, we are told that we are to have a wide-ranging Defence Review, but months have gone by and that review has receded further and further. We will now have to wait until the spring for that review.\n\nIt is totally irresponsible of a Government to lay before the House proposals for the total abolition of the Territorial Army without making a statement about how they view the broader questions of strategy and our responsibilities in the world today. On that issue we have no statement at all. It is not as if the world was a peaceful place today. I have rarely known it in a more dangerous condition. There are the Americans with 180,000 troops fighting in a relatively small area in Vietnam. We ourselves have our armies in Malaysia. We are fighting in Aden. There is the whole of the Indian sub-continent. There is a state of danger such as I have never known. There are possible troubles boiling up in Africa. Yet with all this trouble boiling up in this world the spokesman for Her Majesty's Government comes to the Box today and proposes that our forces should be cut by some 170,000 men and says not a word about the wider strategy of our overseas commitments. I believe that to be the most irresponsible action I can remember a Government ever having taken in recent years.\n\nQuite apart from taking that decision in a complete vacuum and without any stated broad principles, there is the whole central question of home defence, and, as many people have mentioned, this is 1537 the very centre of the argument. The paragraphs involved are paragraphs 3 and 4 of the White Paper and my interpretation of them is that Her Majesty's Government just do not contemplate the need for any home security rôle to be carried out by uniformed military forces. Are they so absolutely certain that the day of industrial and civil unrest or racial unrest in this country is past? Are we never to have a situation arising where troops may have to be called in to hold together the framework of society?\n\nI believe it would be a bold Minister who would come to the Box and assure the House that this can never happen. Yet it is implicit in this White Paper that if we abolish the Territorial Army there will be no force available to aid the civil power; and on this issue I should like specifically to ask the Minister whether before these proposals were put before the House the chief constables of the counties were consulted on them and whether they are satisfied that without the Territorial Army they can carry out their full responsibilities for the maintenance of law and order in any possible civil disturbance that arises. If the right hon. Gentleman cannot give that assurance I say that he comes to the House without having performed the responsibilities that the House and the country can reasonably ask him to perform.\n\n§ Sir Frank Pearson\n\nI think possibly in the rôle of home defence the question of the help that the Territorial Army can give to the civil defence services is even more important and I speak with some experience because before coining to this House I was for a number of years county chief warden in the Lancashire civil defence force. One hon. Member opposite said that the civil defence services as at present organised are not really a viable civil defence force. I would be perfectly prepared to accept that that is so; but that being so I consider it is even more important that we should recognise the vital rôle that the Territorial Army plays today in backing up the civil defence force.\n\nI know from personal experience that without the support and backing given by the Territorial Army units the civil defence organisation in Lancashire would be worth nothing. Given that backing and that help, we have in the Territorial Army and in the civil defence units a first-class nucleus that in time of approaching emergency could be expanded into a viable and worthwhile force. I must say that I have never been more surprised in my life than when I read paragraph 4 of the White Paper. I am astonished that any responsible Minister should come to the House with the proposition that the only situation that this country has to contemplate is that it would be totally devastated by nuclear attack. There is no suggestion of a possible half-way house, no Question of a near-miss; no question of conventional weapons or of only one bomb falling on one Part of the country. No, the only set of circumstances on which the whole of the White Paper is based is that the whole country is to be smothered with nuclear bombs.\n\nIt is on that basis that the Government propose to abolish the Territorial Army. I have never heard a more irresponsible 1539 or irrational argument put by anyone, let alone a responsible Minister. There are a thousand and one possibilities which no one can possibly contemplate at this stage. Those have not been taken into account, but Her Majesty's Government turn round and use the amazing phrase: The damage in this case would be so great and widespread that the present Territorial Army would be unable to offer assistance commensurate with its cost. It would be a very high premium to go on paying for uncertain insurance against a contingency that is in any case unlikely to come about. Her Majesty's Government are actually saying that where the country is under attack, where human rights may be at stake and where the presence of a disciplined force may be absolutely vital to maintain the structure of society, the presence of that force is not justifiable because what it could do is not commensurate with the probable cost. I have never heard a more appallingly unconvincing argument from someone who is supposed to be responsible. What, anyhow, is the saving to be? [An HON. MEMBER: \"Chicken feed.\"] An hon. Gentleman says \"Chicken feed\". I would not call it chicken feed, for £20 million is a very large sum of money—if I really believed it was ever to be saved. But this is pie in the sky. It is not to come till 1970 and, anyhow, we have not vet taken account of all the home security that has to be planned.\n\nAs this debate goes on I notice that more and more hon. Gentlemen opposite and on the Front Bench begin to take more account of our responsibility in the home security field. I hazard the opinion that by the time alternative proposals have been worked out and put into effect this £20 million of so-called saving may be very much less and, in fact, may be nothing at all.\n\nThis is one of the most important debates we have had for many years. In a magnificent contribution to it, the hon. Member for Toxteth said that he sufficiently believed the case which he put before the House that he would not support his Government in the Division Lobby tonight. I will vote against the Government and I will do so convinced, more convinced than ever before, that I am voting against a totally wrong and totally irresponsible proposal.\n\n§ Mr. E. Shinwell (Easington)\n\nUnlike several hon. Members who have addressed the House, I am quite unable to predict when the next war will take place. Nor am I in a position to give an indication of the form it is likely to assume. There has been far too much idle speculation on this subject. Some have envisaged a nuclear war, with vast destruction and devastation. Others have considered that the war of the future will assume a convential form, with vast armed forces engaged in battle, supplemented by aircraft, some orthodox and some supersonic. I repeat, it is all idle speculation.\n\nAlthough I support the main proposition in the White Paper, there is, perhaps, too much speculation in paragraphs 3 and 4. From where have the Government obtained their information about the nature of a future war? I do not know who their existing military advisers are, but having had some experience of military advice—going back to 1929, when I was at the War Office, apart from some residence there for nearly three years later, during the Labour Government of 1945–51 and at the Ministry of Defence—I venture to say to my hon. and right hon. Friends that they must exercise some caution and prudence in accepting advice as to the nature, form and character of a future war.\n\nI dismiss speculation and I equally dismiss the remarks of the hon. Member for Clitheroe (Sir Frank Pearson). He apparently has not heard of the independent nuclear deterrent. He apparently never read that memorable White Paper on Defence published in 1957—a document which contained many predictions by the right hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Sandys), the then Minister of Defence. He, we were given to understand at that time, had got it straight from the horse's mouth. Those predictions were accepted by hon. Gentlemen opposite and by many people in the country.\n\nThat White Paper gave a new direction, form and thrust to the character of our defence forces. Both sides of the House deserve some reproach for the speculations which have become characteristic in recent years. No hon. Member is in a position to say dogmatically what kind of war will take place in future, if indeed there is another war. All that we are entitled to do is 1541 to exercise normal and essential precautions. We must obviously seek, in conjunction with our allies, to promote, as far as practicable, disarmament or partial disarmement. I am not saying that that is as easy as it may seem. But the effort must be made. Equally, we must, in conjunction with our allies, promote the most effective means of defence against possible aggression, through N.A.T.O., S.E.A.T.O., CENTO and a variety of other devices, last but certainly not least being the device on which we rest our security in the future, the United Nations Organisation, for what that may be worth.\n\nThese are the ordinary devices available to us. These precautions are essential and I have ventured in the past to point out, and I still retain the conviction, that it is the duty of any British Government, irrespective of ideology, to find ways and means, within their economic resources, to provide a measure of security for the nation. There is no conflict here, although I know that some of my hon. Friends believe that defence is impossible and that measures for defence should not be resorted to.\n\nWhat is the issue before the House today? It is not a question of whether we want to abolish, to destroy, the Territorial organisation or whether we wish to retain it. That is an over-simplification of the problem. The issue is the simple one of whether we require to supplement our Regular forces on the ground by adequate reserve forces. If it is agreed that we must have reserve forces—and I assume that there is agreement on both sides of the House on this issue—the question which then arises is this: are these reserve forces adequate in character, sufficiently trained and efficiently equipped with the most modern weapons available? We must also consider whether they are to be administered and controlled either by a voluntary organisation outside the Territorial and Auxiliary Forces Association or by the Ministry of Defence, with its advisers. That is the issue.\n\nI have had some experience of the Territorial Army, although not actual operational experience. I can only claim to having been a member of the Westminster Home Guard for a period during the last war, in which capacity I occasionally patrolled the Terrace late at night 1542 and challenged friend or foe. I also used to visit the rifle range in the subterranean part of this building in an effort to make myself efficient as a rifle shot. Later I went to Bisley and was a complete failure. However, I have had some experience as a Minister at the War Office and occasionally I went to visit depots, drill halls and so on and saw the Territorial forces engaged in training. I digress for a moment.\n\nThe right hon. Member for Stafford and Stone (Mr. Hugh Fraser) is unfortunately not in his place. He informed us that he was an honorary colonel of the Lovat Scouts. How grand. When he spoke I ventured to intervene to ask a question, but he refused to yield. It was up to him. Now I ask the question. What is the function of an honorary colonel of the Lovat Scouts? Has he engaged in training and, if so, when and where? What about the Lovat Scouts? Do they train and, if so, when, where and do they contribute to the strength of our defence organisation? It is a fair question and I suppose that it might be argued that, potentially, they could be utilised at some time in the future. However, this question remains to be answered: are our Territorial forces adequately trained and equipped and are they efficiently administered and controlled to make an effective force when the time comes?\n\nI do not dispute the argument, of which we have heard so much, that out of the Territorial Army, the volunteer force, comes an element of Regular recruitment which will not be available if the Territorial Army is disposed of. I do not dispute that, but it is not sufficient for our purpose. The question is: do we want adequate reserve forces? What is the answer? The right hon. and gallant Member for Norwood (Sir J. Smyth) is an authority on this subject in a practical as well as a theoretical sense. I should like him to answer the question: what do we want from our reserve forces?\n\nDo we want a number of people meeting at weekends at some training establishment, and pretending to train with obsolete weapons that are not relevant to a war of the future—if there is ever to be a war? I do not suggest that we should indulge in beer swilling, though even if we do I can understand it. How often have I gone to a drill 1543 hall and seen men training with antiaircraft guns that were completely out of date? One can understand their frustration. I do not indulge in beer swilling myself, but I can understand it, and I do not complain. But that is not the issue. The primary issue is: do we want reserve forces? Are they to be adequate, properly controlled and administered as an effective organisation, and are they to make an effective contribution to the reserves that may some day be required to supplement our Regular forces?\n\nIf we want it, how is it to be done? Is it to be only in the Victorian way—but I must withdraw that; the Territorial Army began under Lord Haldane, and he had plenty of trouble about it. I noticed that when my right hon. Friend ventured to refer to 1907 and Lord Haldane's activities in the promotion of the Territorial Army, his reference was sneered at by the other side. The Conservatives have no right to sneer. It was they who opposed the Liberal Government at the time, and opposed Lord Haldane, who was a member of that Government, when he sought to build up the Territorial Army. The Conservatives have nothing to boast of at all. Let them put that in their pipes and smoke it.\n\nMy hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Toxteth (Mr. Crawshaw) made a very sincere speech—though I did not agree with a word of it, except when, in the latter part, he suggested that there should he some reorganisation of the Territorial forces. That reminds me of what the Leader of the Opposition said about the need for rationalisation——\n\n§ Mr. Shinwell\n\nImagine the right hon. Gentleman saying that to me! If I were a vindictive man, what would be my rejoinder to that. But the right hon. Gentleman is, if he will forgive my saying so, an extinct volcano, to use the expression used by someone opposite in the past about some of his Conservative friends.\n\nThe right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition said that he had gone to the Highlands. What happened when he went there? He got plenty of publicity—he saw to that—but not a word about unemployment in the Highlands, not a word about depopulation in the Highlands, not a word about agriculture, or the development of new industries. All he heard in the Highlands was the sorry story of the possible destruction of the Territorial Army.\n\nI will bring this argument to a conclusion, though I could do what some hon. Members have done and what my hon. Friend did—indulge in reminiscences. I could speak about what happened when I was Financial Secretary to the War Office in 1929. What a story I could tell of what a wonderful organisation this force was then—how adequate, how efficient. Again, I could speak of what happened in 1947. A letter appeared in The Times the other day which has been quoted quite frequently by hon. Members. It was signed by six field marshals. Some of them are very good friends of mine, I was intimately 1545 acquainted with them—indeed, at one time, some of them were my employees. Nevertheless, they had not a constructive suggestion to make on how to reform the Territorial forces. But I saw that Field Marshal Montgomery would not join them in signing that letter—and I back Montgomery against the lot. I welcome him to the Labour Party—the Conservatives can keep the rest.\n\nI venture to say that this matter is being regarded far too seriously by some hon. Members. The hon. Member for Clitheroe almost wept at times. This is just a question of whether we want to build up an adequate defence force, and those who at one time or another who have been engaged in that task know how difficult it is. I can understand how my right hon. Friends have been frustrated, disturbed and harassed, and have been subjected to all kinds of military advice in recent months before coming to a conclusion. They are doing their best in the circumstances on the advice they have, and we have to accept it.\n\nI therefore suggest that we accept the White Paper—leaving out paragraphs 3 and 4; the speculation, the conjectures the assumptions, because we do not know what kind of a war it will be. My hope is that we shall not have another war. At the same time, I have to say to some of my hon. Friends—they do not always agree with me, but I cannot help that, because I do not always agree with them—that we must take precautions in the interest of the security of the people. Therefore, we must have a measure of defence. I know that it is costly, but we must put up with that until we can promote a measure of disarmament. That is the object of every hon. Member in the House. On that we are agreed.\n\nI suggest that we agree to accept the White Paper and make the best of it. Some people say that it will not work. How do we know that it will not work? One thing I know is that the existing Territorial Army will not work; it is not adequate; it is not efficient; it is not effective, and it is never likely to be so. So we must accept something rational. We must accept a change. For a number of years the War Office and the Ministry of Defence have been demanding that there should be radical change. Now 1546 the time has come for it, and we ought to accept it.\n\n§ Mr. Younger\n\nI thank my hon. Friend for reminding me of that fact, which I know very well indeed. This is an excellent example of what we shall have to face in Scotland.\n\nI should like to spend plenty of time talking about this, but I make no apology for the fact that I now leave entirely all what I would call the social disadvantages of the abolition of the Territorial Army. I do not leave them because I do not believe them. I believe them as much as, and more than, any other hon. Member here. I believe them every bit as much as the hon. Member for Toxteth, who made a most courageous speech, with which I entirely agree. Of all the services the hon. Gentleman has rendered the Territorial Army in his life, what he has done today is perhaps the greatest of all. He has had the courage 1548 to do what I very much hope many of us would do in similar circumstances. He has had the courage to speak from the heart and to say what he means and what he really thinks is important, although it was against the natural inclinations we all have to be loyal to our parties. I very much hope that the hon. Gentleman's efforts will bear fruit.\n\nThe social aspects of the Territorial Army are powerful arguments in favour of its retention. They are advantages of the Territorial Army, but they are not the reason for its existence. In the Territorial Army—the Associations and the serving members—we believe that we have a cast-iron, first-class case based purely on the necessity of having a Territorial Army. I start from where I began, that we need to have a reserve to fall back on.\n\nWhat is a reserve? A reserve is an army which is not committed in the first instance. The right hon. Gentleman's new reserve will be committed before hostilities start, certainly from the moment hostilities start, because we all know that the Regular Army needs every one of those 50,000 men to bring it up to strength. I will not go into details. I do not think this is in dispute. The Regular Army requires, for its 180,000 men to be effective, if it gets them, the 50,000 that are to be in the new Reserve. Therefore, certainly from the moment hostilities start, and probably very considerably earlier, there will be nothing left in this country.\n\nI should like to know whether this has really sunk home. Not long ago I asked the right hon. Gentleman what forces there were in this country for home defence. The right hon. Gentleman gave me a magnificent figure of over 200,000 men. I was supposed to believe that all those men would be ready and willing to stand up and defend us when we were left with our Regular forces gone elsewhere. This was the most totally inaccurate and, in a way, although I say this in the most respectful way, dishonest way of putting it, because all these hundreds of thousands of men were people who are committed to many other jobs.\n\nFor example, the job of the R.A.F. Regiment is to protect airfields. Is it suggested that they would not be necessary to protect those very airfields at a time of crisis when war was about to 1549 break out or had broken out? Could they be withdrawn at that moment? Of course not. What about the naval forces at home stations practising or training? Would they be spared at a time of crisis? The figures have no validity whatever. The forces in this country at the moment are virtually committed now, and, even if any are available now, they certainly would not be when hostilities started.\n\nI make one more point about the forces in this country at the moment. We are led to believe that there is a certain number of battalions always available here and ready to help us in any little trouble which may blow up. This is true on paper. There are several battalions ready in this country now. But anyone who knows anything about the Army will agree that the battalions at home at any time are the ones which are shortest of strength. It is a well known practice in the Army that, in order to get battalions overseas up to strength, one has to transfer men from battalions left at home. This applies to all the best known battalions. Almost every one of them in this country, except the Strategic Reserve, is very much below strength.\n\nThus, we shall be left to face a possible future conflict with no reserve whatever left behind when the Regular Army has been committed. But, of course, this begs the whole question touched on by many speakers, including the right hon. Member for Easington. Can we be certain that any future conflict will be nuclear? This is fundamental. I am sorry that I must straightly charge the Secretary of State and his colleagues, for whom I have the highest regard, with having accepted bad advice. I say that not without having taken very careful thought. They have accepted bad advice because, in considering all alternatives open to an enemy, whoever he might be, and to our own forces, they have accepted the one most favourable to themselves.\n\nI ask them to look back into the history of warfare. Is it ever safe to accept the alternative most favourable to oneself when making one's plans? The noble Lord, Lord Montgomery, said not long ago in another place—and how true it is—that, when one is planning operations of war, there are at least three alternatives in almost any situation, and the only thing one can be sure of is that the enemy will take the fourth. This is the main 1550 fallacy into which right hon. Gentlemen have fallen, thinking that they can absolutely rely upon any future conflict being a nuclear exchange.\n\nLet us look the other side for a moment and think about what an enemy would do. Will he say, \"We know that the N.A.T.O. Alliance is relying on a nuclear exchange, so we too must rely on a nuclear exchange\"? Is this the way the enemy approaches a battle? If a general is up against another army which is strong in artillery, does he say, \"We must have an artillery duel\"? Of course not. He thinks of something else, of a way round the problem, finding the enemy's weak spot.\n\nIf the plan in the White Paper is adopted, we shall have an obvious weak spot. It will be open to any enemy who turns up at any time to say, \"I shall gain my objective by small incursions into N.A.T.O. Alliance territory. I shall make incursions which are important but not important enough to make the N.A.T.O. allies feel that they can use their nuclear deterrent\". Step by step, therefore, we shall be at the mercy of any enemy because we shall not have anything like sufficient ground forces.\n\nThe only argument going the other way that I can see arises if one accepts that the only possible alternative is a nuclear exchange, and I shall now say a word or two about that.\n\n§ Sir H. d'Avigdor-Goldsmid\n\nI cannot follow that. The only hon. Member I heard mention signallers was the hon. Member for Woolwich, West.\n\nThis signal regiment has an ancient history. It goes back to the Cinque Ports Fencibles of the eighteenth century, which were formed in the days of William Pitt. It has had various transmutations. It has been an artillery regiment, a garrison artillery regiment and a signal regiment. It is stationed in East and West Kent. I see that its area is now to stretch from London to Brentwood, to Maidstone and to Norwich.\n\nOf course, one can do individual training at scattered centres. Probably the individual training is just as good at scattered centres as it is if the regiment comes together. But how one gets a regiment to come together and for the officers and men to get to know each other when they are scattered between Norwich, Maidstone and London is something on which the White Paper does not enlighten me and which I very much doubt has been considered. The fact is that the White Paper is an attempt to substitute individuals for units. The fallacy is that the individual is a creature of habit. He does not behave in the 1564 same way with strangers as he does with people he knows. The substitution of individuals for units will not produce the same result.\n\nThere is a great deal of talk about the difference in training and the importance of extra training. My experience of military life is that training never comes to an end. I dare say that that is true of the Navy. Whether one is a Regular soldier, a Territorial soldier, or a Reservist, one is training—and if a person is not training he should be training.\n\nA grea"
