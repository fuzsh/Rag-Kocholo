        "text": "Humboldt University of Berlin is one of several top German universities or research institutions that will host University of Rochester undergraduate students taking part in this summer’s DAAD RISE internship program. (Getty Images photo)\n\nUniversity of Rochester undergraduates regularly number among those selected to participate in the DAAD RISE summer research program in Germany.\n\nThe DAAD RISE program offers undergraduates from North America, Great Britain, and Ireland summer research internships at top German universities and research institutions. Students are matched with a host university or institute based on their area of interest (biology, chemistry, physics, earth sciences, engineering, or a closely related field) and work with PhD student mentors or researchers.\n\nDAAD is the German Academic Exchange Service, and RISE stands for Research Internships in Science and Engineering. The government-funded program was established in 2005 and provides students with a monthly stipend for three months to cover living expenses. The working language is English.\n\nLearn more about DAAD RISE and other fellowship, scholarship, and award opportunities available to Rochester students.\n\nRecent DAAD RISE Recipients\n\nCongratulations to the most recent DAAD RISE recipients from the University of Rochester!\n\nRobert Ghetiu ’26\n\nClausthal Technical University in Clausthal-Zellerfeld\n\nArea of study: Chemistry (BS)\n\nThe Iasi, Romania, native will perform research at the university’s Institute for Organic Chemistry.
