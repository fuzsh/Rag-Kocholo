        "text": "Advertisements\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by ben86\n\nI've never been able to track down a Europe-wide sunshine map (probably because there's no Europe-wide weather service) but Germany is not really that much sunnier than us on average, take a look:\n\nand for France, which is notably sunnier (I couldn't fully explain why):\n\nIt may well be, according to these tables, though there's not much in it:\n\nIntellicast - Karlsruhe Historic Weather Averages in Germany\n\nIntellicast - Freiburg/Breisgau Historic Weather Averages in Germany\n\nFreiburg markets itself as the place with the best climate in Germany because of the extra sunshine though I think, which Der Spiegel seems to agree with:\n\nNeue Daten für alle Regionen: Deutschlands wahres Klima - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Nachrichten - Wissenschaft\n\nI think the annual figures only tell half the story. The further east in europe you go, while annual totals dont increase much, summers are notably sunnier, and winters duller, thanks to high pressure and associated anticyclonic gloom during winter. With a weak sun at >50N and little wind to break up the low cloud, winters in Berlin Warsaw and Moscow can make London winters seem sunny. I think this is why american cities are far sunnier than 'continental' european cities during winter. Most american cities are 1000 miles futher south or so, thus the sun is able to burn off the freezing fog at 43N that wouldnt shift at 53N.\n\nFor example, Berlin gets 238 hours of sun in July, but just 38 hours in December. London gets less sun in July (207 hours) but more in December 49 hours) (1971-2000 averages). Our windy climate does what the sun is too weak to do. Maybe french totals are higher because they benefit from more winter wind than germany?\n\nEven so, Germany isnt a sunny country, i guess thats why theres so many Germans and Brits at meditteranean resorts during the summer.\n\nIt seems Freiburg is warmer in winter, Karlsruhe warmer in summer. Max in Jan of 4.5c and max in august of 25.9c at Karlshure vs 5.1c and 25.2c at Freiburg\n\n[ MétéoFrance ]\n\n[ MétéoFrance ]\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by nei\n\nI'm impressed how big the contrast in sunshine there is between Southern France and Northern France. Part of the country is much sunnier than I'm used and most of the rest is much cloudier than I'm used to (I get 2400-2500 hours) There's very little in between. It's as if there are two Frances, climate-wise.\n\nI'm puzzled that the PNW is only slightly cloudier than New England. Maybe the sunny summers make up for the gloominess of the rest of the year?\n\nAs far as our country and the PNW vs New England in sunshine – “only slightly cloudier\" is a bit of a stretch (New England is far sunnier). Annually, most of New England receives from 2200 to 2600, and parts of southern Connecticut (although some consider this part of the Tri-State area and not New England) get more than 2600 hours of sunshine – far more than the 2000 hrs cities like Seattle, Portland, Eugene, etc gets:\n\nKeep in mind these are annual averages – in winter (Dec/Jan/Feb) a city like Seattle will see about half as many hours of sun as a New England city like Boston. Although many parts of the USA get more sunshine annually (2800 - 4000 hrs) and monthly (more than 300 hours ) than Boston or New England…the PNW is by far the center of sunless skies on the USA mainland\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by wavehunter007\n\nAs far as our country and the PNW vs New England in sunshine – “only slightly cloudier\" is a bit of a stretch (New England is far sunnier).

I thought 2300 hours was a bit high for Portland. Looks like I live exactly on the 2400 hours line. Still Northern Vermont and New Hampshire look just as cloudy as the Pacific Northwest. The White Mountains of New Hampshire appear to be in the less than 1800 hours of sun zone; lower than the North Cascades and possibly the Olympic Mountains.\n\nAny clue why this is? Though I wonder whether they using Mt. Washington as a data point, skewing the contour lines.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by nei\n\nThanks for the map.

Keep in mind, 2,400 hours of sunshine might be low for much of the USA – but it’s not bad for a mid latitude (above 40 N/S) location. Your location still gets more hours of sun annually than cities like Portland, Seattle, Vancouver, Montreal, Toronto, London, Paris, many parts of New Zealand, and Melbourne, Australia. I know that’s not saying much, since those locations are known to be often overcast, but 2,400 hours of sun annually is not all that bad.\n\nAs far as that tiny area of less than 1800 hours around northern New Hampshire – I would guess that has everything to do with the data point of Mt. Washington (6800 feet). Notice (on the map above) the 2200 line up in northern Maine and west of Burlington, VT. From what I can tell – outside of northern New Hampshire – all areas of even northern New England still receive 2000 to 2200 hours of sunshine - more than anywhere in the PNW from the central coast of Oregon northward (which gets less than 2000)."
