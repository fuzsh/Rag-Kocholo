        "meta_description": "For crystal growth of semiconductor materials a short-term temperature stability of 0.1 C at 1500 C is one of the essential parameters to be addressed for achieving high-quality crystals. Hence, for temperature monitoring and control with high precision in a floating zone furnace two sets of thermo-sensors, type B thermocouples and optical fibre thermometers, have been implemented and successfully operated in the furnace for more than 2000 h. The optical fibre thermometers consist of an optical system made of sapphire (two fibres plus a prism in between for deflection) and transmit the infra-red radiation of the heater to the outside of the hot core of the furnace for pyrometric temperature measurement. A dedicated control algorithm has been set up which controlled the power settings to the individual heaters. Both sensor types showed no degradation after this period and yielded a short-term stability at 1200 C of 0.05 C (optical fibre thermometers), respectively 0.08 C (thermocouples).",
