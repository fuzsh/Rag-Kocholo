        "text": "Low Season in Germany\n\nLow season in Germany is from November through the month of March except Christmas time. Winters in Germany usually begin in November and brings with itself dark and dreary days with snow and freezing rain in some places, especially the east and the south. Even though the weather is chilly and it is the country’s quietest time of the year, you can have the chance to get excellent deals on lodging and airfare. Also, get to explore the picture-perfect sights pretty much all to yourself.\n\nShoulder Season in Germany\n\nThe shoulder season in Germany is from April through mid-June and from September to mid-October. This time is a pretty good compromise between the peak and low seasons. Weather during the spring season can be pretty unpredictable with rainy or sunny days or perhaps snow and hail too. You won’t find a lot of tourists during this time and can find great discounted rates for lodging. September is usually characterized by diminishing crowds and warm weather which October remains wet with brilliant autumn colours all around and better deals on airfare.\n\nWeather in Germany in the month of March at the onset of Spring is one of the best times to be there. Although early in March, the weather is still a bit chilly but it starts to warm up towards the end of the month. The average high during this time rises to about 8°C to 10°C even in areas that get a lot of snow. With the spring officially here now, the weather in April goes up to 14-degree Celcius.\n\nA light jacket would be essential for early mornings and late evenings but a winter coat can be avoided. The climate in May in Germany is usually idyllic and one can find cherry blossoms in full bloom. Possibility of rain this month is higher as compared to the previous month but you can expect lots of sunshine. The average high temperature can be around 19°C making it perfect for sightseeing and all sorts of outdoor activities. This is the last spring month and weather can be pretty unpredictable so it’s best to carry an umbrella.\n\nKey Events in Spring\n\n• Starkbierfest: Starkbierfest or the Strong Beer Festival is a 3-week event held in Munich where attendees can enjoy amusement rides, a lot of tasty brews, lederhosen, culinary delights and more.
