        "text": "Weather\n\nJune is a beautiful weather month in Germany with fresh greenery, sunshine, and extensive daylight hours. The Summer Solstice, for example, is the longest day of the year and has more than 16 hours of daylight with early sunrises (before 5 am) and late sunsets (after 9 pm).\n\nAs the month moves toward summer, you can expect increasing temperatures and humidity, especially in the southwest. Temperatures in Berlin, the nation's capital, have an average daily high of 72°F (22°C) and a low of 54°F (12°C). Frankfurt is said to be the warmest city in Germany, with an average daily high of 75°F (24°C) and an average low of 57°F (14°C). Towns in the Bavarian Alps like Garmisch-Partenkirchen will feel slightly cooler due to their higher altitude, especially near Germany's highest peak, Zugspitze, at 9,718 feet (2,962 m) above sea level.\n\nBring a spring jacket and a few light layers for early mornings and late evenings wherever you travel. You would be wise to also pack a rain jacket and umbrella for intermittent rain showers that are often quickly dried up by the sunshine. Also, bring sunscreen for sightseeing and outdoor adventures.\n\nCrowds & Costs\n\nJune marks the beginning of the high season in Germany when visitors start to see airfares and accommodations climb to their highest rates, along with more people lining up at major attractions. It is essential to make travel bookings early to secure availability, especially if participating in any of the popular festivals and events listed below. Budget-conscious travelers should plan their trip in the first half of the month to get any last-minute spring deals before the summer prices kick up.\n\nWhere to Go\n\nThere are countless itinerary options in Germany, depending on your priorities. The lovely spring-to-summer weather is ideal for combining city exploration with nature. Starting from the north, explore the port city of Hamburg, Germany's 'Gateway to the World' with canals, bridges, gardens, and lakes. This can be your base as you rent a car and explore beaches and islands near the Danish border and along the coasts of the North and Baltic seas. You'll have access to long stretches of sand and islands like the country's largest, Rügen, home of Jasmund National Park.\n\nFrom Hamburg, it's less than a two-hour train to Berlin. Spend a few days exploring the capital's famous landmarks, museums, and 12 distinct boroughs. Then get into nature with one of the city parks, like Tiergarten, or farther afield if you enjoy a different pace. An easy day trip is to the UNESCO-listed city of Potsdam, with elegant parks and the Sanssouci Palace, or try Dresden, with gardens surrounded by magnificent Baroque architecture. From Dresden is Saxon Switzerland National Park. A misnomer as the park is in Germany, though the dramatic sandstone towers can easily be mistaken for another country.\n\nThe southern city of Munich offers a range of day trips to Stuttgart and Nuremberg by train and the Bavarian Alps. While renting a car will get you to lesser-visited gems along the River Danube in Eastern Bavaria. Another option is to base yourself in Frankfurt, with access to Cologne, Düsseldorf, and the Black Forest. Here you can explore the enchanting forests and mountains that inspired fairy tales written by the Brothers Grimm. A good base is the spa town called Baden-Baden on the border of France or the sunny medieval university town of Freiburg.\n\nWhat to Do\n\nGermans know how to take advantage of warm weather, and no matter where you are, you can always set out on foot, or what they call wandern (walking) while stopping at biergärten, cafés, and restaurants with outdoor seating. Summer is an excellent time to hike in the Black Forest or Bavarian Alps, with some of the highest peaks in Germany. Just head to your nearest regional tourist office, which can supply hikers with maps and local information.\n\nThe Romantic Road is a popular road trip in the summer from north to south, with several scenic stops ending at King Ludwig II's former home, Neuschwanstein Castle. Germany is home to thousands of castles, so you can easily plan a castle tour wherever your itinerary takes you. Other road trips offer stops in lesser-visited cities boasting grand architecture (and classical music festivals this month) and charming half-timbered towns and villages. History buffs can prioritize sights like Hitler's Eagle's Nest, while spa lovers can head to towns along the border of France for thermal baths with endless views of pine trees.\n\nOenophiles will want to attend tastings at one or more peaceful wineries sprinkled throughout Germany's 13 wine regions—the most popular, Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, has more than 100 wineries. Vertiginous vineyards can be spotted from river cruises, especially in Koblenz, where the Rhine River meets the Mosel River—a center for wine production since Roman times. Of course, Germany's numerous rivers, canals, and lakes also offer a range of activities like canoeing, kayaking, and sailing.\n\nEvents in June\n\nMozart Festival, Würzburg. This annual four-week event (from late May through late June) is the oldest festival in Germany dedicated to Mozart's music. Look for events held in the buildings and gardens of the UNESCO-listed Würzburg Residence.\n\nBach Festival, Leipzig. The town of Leipzig, pictured in this article, is the home of June's annual Bach Fest, celebrating the composer in the place where he wrote most of his works.\n\nHandel Festival, Halle. Head to the birthplace of composer Georg Friedrich Handel for an annual June festival that pays tribute to the German composer with international musicians playing his music.\n\nKieler Woche, Kiel. The Kiel Regatta is an annual event in June, drawing international crowds and making it the largest sailing event in Europe.\n\nKarneval der Kulturen, Berlin. This multicultural street festival in Berlin's Kreuzberg district is held in early June (during the weekend of Pentecost) with processions, performances, and music events.\n\nWhit Monday, nationwide. The Monday after Pentecost is a public holiday making this an annual three-day weekend for locals.\n\nMore Helpful Information"
