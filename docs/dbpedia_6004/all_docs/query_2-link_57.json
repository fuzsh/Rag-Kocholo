        "text": "2-6 July 2012\n\nDataStreme Earth Climate Systems will return for Fall 2012 with new Investigations files starting during Preview Week, Monday, 27 August 2012. All the current online website products will continue to be available throughout the summer break period.\n\nITEMS OF INTEREST\n\nChange in seasons -- The beginning of July marks the beginning of the new heating season. Traditionally, meteorologists and climatologists define the heating season to run from 1 July to 30 June of the following year. Heating degree day units are accumulated commencing on 1 July. Likewise, the snow season runs from 1 July through 30 June. Seasonal snowfall totals are also summed from Sunday.\n\nInsertion of extra \"leap\" second explained -- By international agreement, one second was added to last Saturday (30 June 2012) at 23:59:00 UTC to account for the slowing of the Earth's rotation because of tidal forces between Earth and the Moon. A member of NASA's Space Geodesy Project at the Goddard Space Flight Center described the extremely precise technique called Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) used daily by an international network of stations to conduct observations of the Earth's rotation rate at the same time. [NASA GSFC]\n\nThe half-way point -- Midpoint of calendar year 2012 will occur at midnight local standard time on Monday morning, 2 July 2012.\n\n\"Dog days\" of summer begin -- The \"Dog Days\" traditionally begin on the third day of July of each year and continue through the eleventh day of August. The hot weather period received its name from Sirius, the brightest visible star in the sky and known as the Dog Star. Sirius rises in the east at the same time as the sun this time of the year. (The Weather Channel)\n\nWay out there!...The earth reaches aphelion, the point in its annual orbit when it is farthest from the sun late Wednesday night (officially at 04Z on Thursday, 5 July 2012, which is equivalent to midnight EDT or 11 PM CDT on Wednesday, the 4th). At aphelion, the earth-sun distance is 152,089,000 km, or 3.4% greater than the distance at perihelion, the smallest earth-sun distance, which occurred earlier this year on the late evening of 2 January 2013.\n\nThis year's noctilucent cloud season begins -- Data obtained from sensors onboard NASA's AIM (Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere) spacecraft indicate the return of noctilucent clouds for the spring over the polar cap in the Northern Hemisphere. These noctilucent clouds, or electric blue ice clouds, are found in the high mesosphere during the summer season at altitudes of approximately 85 km. [NASA GSFC]\n\nCURRENT CLIMATE MONITORING\n\nAn All-Hazards Monitor -- This Web portal provides the user information from NOAA on current environmental events that may pose as hazards such as tropical weather, fire weather, marine weather, severe weather, drought and floods. [NOAAWatch]\n\nGlobal and US Hazards/Climate Extremes -- A review and analysis of the global impacts of various weather-related events, including drought, floods and storms during the current month. [NCDC]\n\nPALEOCLIMATE RECONSTRUCTION\n\nAncient warming helped greening of Antarctica -- Researchers from the University of Southern California, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Louisiana State University have found that the climate of ancient Antarctica during the middle Miocene (between 20 and 15 million years ago) was sufficiently warm and wet so as to support substantial vegetation that included stunted trees along the edges of the currently frozen continent. The scientists based their findings on sediment core samples retrieved from beneath the Ross Ice Shelf. During this ancient time span, greenhouse gas concentrations may have been similar to levels projected for the end of the 21st century. [NASA Earth Mission]\n\nCLIMATE FORCING\n\nRise in sea level accelerates along US East Coast -- A newly released US Geological Survey report indicates that since approximately 1990, the rates of sea level rise along sections of the US Atlantic Coast from North Carolina to New England are increasing three-to-four times faster than globally. The report also warns that if global temperatures increase as projected, rates of sea level rise for this section of the coast called a \"hotspot\" should also continue to increase. [USGS Newsroom] Experimental watershed yields new insights into water and climate --An outdoor experimental watershed laboratory established six years ago by University of Delaware scientists at Fair Hill, MD to investigate water hydrology and biogeochemistry has produced data into how water and chemicals move through forest canopies, soils and watersheds. These studies could be used to understand how future climate change may impact or alter the response of water and the watersheds. [University of Delaware] Solar tornadoes appear to power solar atmosphere -- Applied mathematicians from the United Kingdom's University of Sheffield, Norway's University of Oslo, Germany's Institute for Solar Physics of Freiburg and Sweden's Uppsala University have discovered \"super solar tornadoes\" in space could power the atmosphere of the Sun to temperatures that are on the order of millions of degrees Celsius. These solar tornadoes, which have a magnetic skeleton with a width of more than 1000 miles and spin at speed in excess of 6000 mph, carry the energy from the energy reservoir below the Sun's surface, called the convection zone, to the outer atmosphere in the form of magnetic waves. [The University of Sheffield News]\n\nAerosol structures revealed by X-rays -- Researchers at the US Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory have used X-rays from the Laboratory's Linac (Linear accelerator) Coherent Light Source to capture detailed images of airborne soot particles, a key contributor to global warming and a health hazard. [SLAC News Center]\n\nCLIMATE IMPACTS ON THE BIOSPHERE\n\nRole of urban greenery in carbon exchange demonstrated -- After taking continuous measurements of the net carbon dioxide exchange in urban vegetation and soils for more than one year, scientists from the University of California, Santa Barbara and the University of Minnesota have concluded that vegetation is important in the uptake of the greenhouse gas, but also that different types of vegetation play different roles in the urban landscape. [University of California, Santa Barbara]\n\nShrews evolve rapidly due to changing climate -- Scientists from the US Geological Survey's Alaska Science Center and their colleagues from the University of New Mexico and the Denver Museum of Nature & Science report that shrews, or small mammals residing in the Arctic, appear to have rapidly evolved in response to climate change. They base their conclusions on historical climate data and modern molecular evidence from multiple genes that show some shrew species expand geographic ranges and increased population sizes during warmer and wetter climate intervals, while other shrew species respond the same way during colder and drier climate episodes. [USGS Newsroom]\n\nCLIMATE AND IMPACTS ON HUMAN HEALTH\n\n\"Beat the Heat, Check the Backseat\" slogan to serve as a reminder --The National Weather Service is using the slogan \"Beat the Heat, Check the Backseat\" to remind people to check for small children in a car seat and to never leave children unattended in a vehicle. In research conducted by Jan Null, Certified Consulting Meteorologist, 534 children have died nationwide from heat stroke suffered while in a vehicle since 1998. [Golden Gate Weather Services]\n\nCLIMATE AND SOCIETY\n\nAgreement reached to improve climate services across the West -- A Memorandum of Agreement was signed last week between the Western Governors Association (WGA) and NOAA that would improve the development and delivery of climate science and services to Western states and the US Pacific islands. [Western Governors' Association News] As part of this initiative, the first Quarterly Climate Impacts and Outlook was released that is aimed at assisting policy makers as they prepare for drought and other extreme weather events during the summer of 2012. [Western Governors' Association]\n\nAdvances in computing claimed to be vital to sustainability efforts -- A new report from the National Research Council claims that advances in computing allowing for the understanding of complex systems and the accounting for uncertainty will be essential to finding solutions to sustainability challenges in such areas as electricity production and delivery, global food production, and climate change. [National Academies News]\n\nWebsite for human dimensions of climate change -- An interagency effort within the US federal government that included NOAA, the Bureau of Land Management and the US Forest Service, has resulted in a website called HD.gov (for HumanDimensions.gov) that provides users, such as natural resource managers, with information on the human dimensions on a variety of topics of interest such as climate change.
