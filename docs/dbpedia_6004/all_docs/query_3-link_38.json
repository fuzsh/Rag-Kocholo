        "text": "Australia is well known for its scorching summers. The heat can be quite a shock to international students, particularly those from cooler countries.\n\nFor students from the Northern Hemisphere, celebrating Christmas in summer can be pretty weird, too!\n\nHowever, summer is not the same everywhere in Australia – some cities experience mild summers, and others experience hot and dry or even humid, rainy summers! To help you prepare for summer, here’s our guide to exactly how hot it gets in Australia, city by city, and some top tips for safety navigating summertime, which usually lasts from December to February.\n\nHow hot does it get in Brisbane?\n\nBrisbane has a moderate, warm climate. In summer, average temperatures range from 21 to 29.8°C. Summer is also the wettest season of the year in Brisbane, so the weather is often quite humid, and there may be thunderstorms and floods.\n\nThe highest ever recorded temperature in Brisbane was 43.2°C on Australia Day in January 1940.\n\nHow hot does it get in Sydney?\n\nSydney is also moderate and warm. In summer, average temperatures range from 19 to 26°C. Sydney summer can also be relatively humid, though not quite as humid as Brisbane.\n\nThe highest ever recorded temperature in Sydney was 48.9°C in January 2020.\n\nHow hot does it get in Canberra?\n\nCanberra enjoys warm, dry summers with little humidity. In summer, average temperatures range from 13 to 27°C.\n\nThe highest ever recorded temperature in Canberra was 44°C in January 2020.\n\nHow hot does it get in Melbourne?\n\nAlthough Melbourne is known for experiencing four seasons in one day, summer days tend to be consistently warm and dry. In summer, average temperatures range from 14 to 25°C.\n\nThe highest ever recorded temperature in Melbourne was 46.4°C in February 2009.\n\nHow hot does it get in Hobart?\n\nSummer in Hobart is the driest season of the year. Tasmania also experiences some of the mildest summers in Australia. In Hobart, average temperatures range from 11 to 21°C.\n\nThe highest ever recorded temperature in Hobart was 41.8°C in January 2013.\n\nHow hot does it get in Adelaide?\n\nAdelaide generally has hot, dry summers – it experiences the lowest humidity of any Australian city. In summer, average temperatures range from 17 to 29°C. Occasionally, though, the temperature will hit 40°C.\n\nThe highest ever recorded temperature in Adelaide was 46.6°C in January 2019.\n\nHow hot does it get in Perth?\n\nSummer in Perth is hot and dry, and there is very little rain. In summer, average temperatures range from 18 to 30°C. Like Adelaide, temperatures may reach 40°C.\n\nThe highest ever recorded temperature in Perth was 46.2°C in February 1991.\n\nHow hot does it get in Darwin?\n\nDarwin really only has two seasons: the ‘wet’ and the ‘dry’. The wet season lasts from November through to April, right through normal Australian summer, and is characterised by high humidity, and lots rain and storms. During this time, average temperatures range from 25 to 32°C, and humidity can be as high as 80 per cent!\n\nThe highest ever recorded temperature in Darwin was 40.4°C in October 1892.\n\nTop tips for Australian summer\n\nBecause it can get so hot in Australia at the height of summer, it’s important to look after yourself and stay protected from the heat.\n\nFirst, it’s essential to protect your skin from the sun. Invest in a high-quality sunscreen with a high SPF (sun protection factor) – these days, aim for 50 SPF or higher to protect your skin from the sun’s radiation. Wear a hat and remember that loose-fitting cotton clothing also provides a good barrier against sun damage.\n\nIf you’re spending a lot of time in the sun or feeling hot, make sure you keep yourself hydrated. Drink plenty of water, particularly if you’re exerting yourself physically or sweating lots."
