        "text": "Very few buildings in Germany have A/C. It rarely gets blazing hot for more than a few days at a time, so really there is no need. Given the questions from friends and colleagues the common wisdom seems to be that AC causes colds (recycled air? a German needs fresh air) and is of course environmentally irresponsible. Having no AC means that even a very warm day can feel much hotter than you might expect.\n\nIf you, like Ali and I, come from the southern US, even a day of 80F outside can be quite unpleasant inside. If it gets above 90F, there is little to do than to sit still in the shade. In fact, I gain a new appreciation for the Mediterranean culture of siesta and late evening meals.\n\nHere are six ways to keep cool in Germany without Air Conditioning:\n\n1) Close the Rolladen.\n\nRolladen are German blinds. Every house I have ever been in in Germany has them. They fit in channels outside the window and roll down to block out all of the light. Modern ones allow you to pull them up a bit to let some light in.\n\nIf you have a window which gets sunlight during the day, shut the Rolladen. The key to keeping the house cool is not letting more heat in than you need. The buildings here usually have very thick walls which resist changes in temperature well. If you can keep the heat out, you will feel cooler.\n\n2) Open the windows in the evening\n\nAt least in Freiburg, the air is almost never as humid as in North Carolina at home. This means it gets cool at night. Opening your windows in the evening and morning for a few minutes each (or sleeping with them open if you are so inclined) can let the cool air replace the warm air in the house.\n\nGet cross ventilation as well if you can. This means windows on both sides of the building so the wind comes through.\n\n3) Juice cubes\n\nThis was a (partially failed) experiment of mine. It was really hot last weekend, so I got the idea to make orange and pineapple juice popsicles. Though without the plastic forms or toothpicks, I just made ice cubes out of juice. Things I learned from this:\n\nIce cube trays do not want to let such things free. I don’t even think toothpicks would have helped.\n\nA quick hot water bath (learned from melting popcorn butter) however does help.\n\nFrozen orange juice is still very sticky.\n\nFrozen orange juice cubes are cold enough to be awful to put in your mouth whole or really eat with your fingers.\n\nIt is incredibly funny to Ali and I to attempt aforementioned eating of said cubes with our hands. Laughing however is not conducive to keeping ice cubes in your mouth.\n\nNext time I’m going with beer in my ice cube trays.\n\n4) Leave home\n\nYou can decide how extreme you want to go with this. August is an extremely popular time for vacations across Europe as well. Can’t deal with the heat at home, go off to the beach for a few weeks and try to enjoy the sun and water.\n\nIf that is a too much for you, try just leaving the house. Hunt out a Strandbad (Beach-Pool in German) to take a dip in the pool. They have open fields and pools open to the public for an entrance fee. Biergartens are nearly always amongst trees. Even a shady cafe with a drink in the open breeze may be cooler than home.\n\nDon’t expect however that going shopping will help. Although some stores do have AC, it will not be as cool as an American might expect and not every place has it. Our local grocery store is ok near the freezer section, but gets sweltering near the checkout counters.\n\n5) Ice Cream\n\nGermans are not known for ice cream, more for beer and schnitzel. Thankfully there are plenty of Italians in Germany. Eis (pronounced like English “ice”) is quite popular in Germany. Warm days mean long lines at the ice cream place.If you are going to leave the house (ala #4 above) think about an ice cream.\n\nMost places have a window or counter that will serve scoops. It is however extremely common for the tables to be service only. Don’t try to sit with your cone unless you see plenty of others doing it. The table service is more expensive, but offers big fancy ice cream concoctions, often with liquor.\n\n6) Buy a fan.\n\nYup, good old fashion fans can be a last resort. (Ventilator in German). Last year in Spain we had an apartment in Valencia also without AC and ended up having to go out and buy a fan. Thankfully it was small enough that we got it home to Germany. It isn’t much and doesn’t compare to AC, but the moving air is nice.\n\nIn Summary\n\nEurope is a really nice place in the summer, but despite the warm temperatures very few places have AC. Take your cues from the locals to deal with the heat.\n\nClose the blinds during the day to keep out the heat and let it in in the evenings.\n\nJust get out of the house and sit out with locals anyway. Pick a shady spot with a breeze and a beer.\n\nMake freezer treats to enjoy on the balcony. I’m trying beer instead of juice next time.\n\nAs a last resort, you can always just wait for the rain."
