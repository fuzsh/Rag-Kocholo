        "text": "Results and Discussion\n\nElectron irradiation damage\n\nFirst of all, we focus on a more general observation which mainly concerns the thin film instability during the imaging process. In Figure 1a, a TEM micrograph of sample S1 is presented. In the energy-filtered imaging, the Si particles are clearly visible as white areas. The image has been obtained using low-dose conditions with a total dose of about 5.6 C/cm². In Figure 1c, the dose amounts to about 4.5 × 102 C/cm² in the same area. The particles have significantly grown and new particles appeared, which is clearly visualized in the XOR image of Figure 1b, where image changes are indicated by white. We therefore decided to investigate two plain SiO2 films, a SiO2 reference TEM membrane and a SiN membrane with PECVD SiO2 on top (samples S2 and S3, cf. Table 1). As shown in Figure 2, the creation of Si particles also was observed to take place in pure SiO2 and we estimated a threshold irradiation dose of about 16 C/cm². Please note that our calculated threshold dose is in close agreement with literature data [33]. The intense electron beam may cause the breaking of Si–O bonds accompanied by the creation of volatile O2 molecules, which is supported by the observation of defect creation in SiO2 after electron irradiation [34] and a SiO2 thickness dependence on the hole drilling time when exposed to an intense electron probe [35]. Another possible explanation is certainly a preferential sputtering or knock-on of oxygen [36-38]. A common way to reduce the electron beam damage is to lower the operating voltage of the TEM. Hence, we reduced the operation voltage to 80 kV, but did not observe any significant differences in the beam irradiation damage. While the true beam damage mechanism is subject to further investigation, it can be concluded that it is important to take images below the threshold dose, when dielectric films containing Si NCs are investigated.\n\nSilicon loss and out-diffusion during segregation annealing\n\nAnother issue that arises directly from inspection of Figure 1a is the low areal density of sample S1 of only 0.8 × 1012 NC/cm². This is a reduction of more than 50% compared to the value of sample S5 treated with a much lower thermal budget (cf. Table 1 and below in Table 2). Lower Si excess concentrations and smaller SRON thicknesses resulted in even lower areal densities. The results suggest that the single Si NC layer is subject to a loss of excess Si during the annealing process. Oxidation of excess Si by some species in the annealing ambient is unlikely because of the highly purified inert gases used during the annealing process. This is further supported by a control experiment, in which we annealed an oxide free Si wafer under the same annealing conditions. An unintentional oxide growth below 1 nm SiO2 thickness was estimated by ellipsometry. On the other hand, we need to consider Si diffusion towards the surface followed by a molecular desorption process [31]. The diffusion of Si in SiO2 is known to be mediated by co-diffusion of SiO molecules and hence strongly depends on the nature of the Si/SiO2 interface [39]. The diffusion length LSi of Si can be calculated by , where DSi represents the diffusion constant of Si in SiO2. Using the values from literature [39] for a 1 h annealing, LSi is determined to be around 2.6 nm which is larger than the 2 nm capping SiO2 even though the heating and cooling ramps were not considered. Although the Si surface loss rate is not exactly known, Si out-diffusion and emanation may well explain the observed effects. The diffusion length can be reduced by shortening the annealing time and lowering the annealing temperature. Hence short furnace annealing processes with fast temperature ramps and a peak temperature of 1100 °C are used for all following samples.\n\nThe role of annealing ambient\n\nIt is well known that N2 annealing is usually reducing interface defects and hence leads to higher photoluminescence intensities as compared to Ar annealing [40,41]. Therefore, 10 nm SiO0.93 films were annealed in Ar and N2 (samples S4 and S5) atmosphere and compared by plane-view EFTEM that is presented in Figure 3. As can be seen at lower magnification (Figure 3a), the Ar-annealed sample exhibits a high density of surface defects. It appears that part of the layer has been removed (darker regions). These surface damages are absent for the N2-annealed sample, which is very homogeneous across the whole sample area. Similar effects have been reported for Ar-annealed SiO2 thin films on Si and were ascribed to out-diffusion of SiO molecules [31]. Therefore, it can be concluded that annealing in N2 hampers the Si out-diffusion. However, the undamaged microstructures (cf. Figure 3b and Figure 3c) are very similar for both annealings. From high resolution TEM (see insets of Figure 3b and Figure 3c) and electron diffraction, we found that both samples feature a high degree of crystallinity as is corrobated by detailed Raman studies [20,42]. However, the Si NC shape is not spherical at all. Due to the minimization of Gibbs free energy, a spherical shape is expected, which is limited by the possibility of atomic rearrangement. Since the phase separation is completed within a few seconds due to diffusion of oxygen [43], the nanoparticle growth and shaping can only be achieved through the diffusion of Si within SiO2, which is extremely low at the used thermal budget. Longer and higher temperature annealings would certainly lead to larger amounts of spherical particles with a reduced density due to late-stage coarsening [27,44].\n\nSilicon nanocrystal size distribution and areal density\n\nOnce the annealing conditions and TEM routines have been specified, it is straightforward to investigate the influence of the SRON layer thickness and stoichiometry on density, size and shape of the Si NCs. In Figure 4 a series of EFTEM images is presented for samples S5 to S9. We first consider Figure 4a–c in which the SRON thickness is reduced from 10 nm to 3.5 nm for a fixed layer stoichiometry of SiO0.93. A transition from irregular and large towards spherical and smaller precipitates is clearly observed. Owing to the excellent contrast, the images can be evaluated by image processing software such as ImageJ [45] in order to analyze the particle distribution. The individual particle areas have been assigned to a circle of the same area which allows for the characterization of all particles through a single parameter. The diameter distributions are shown below the corresponding EFTEM images in Figure 4. All distributions can be fitted excellently by a log-normal distribution. The results strongly reflect the ability to control the Si NC size by geometrical one-dimensional confinement of the SRON layers. Furthermore, the influence of the SRON stoichiometry on Si nanoparticle formation is demonstrated in Figure 4c–e. Interestingly, increasing the Si excess exhibits a similar effect on the Si NC size and shape as the SRON thickness increase. The transition from clustering to spinodal-like decomposition [46-48] is obviously a sensitive function of the SRON thickness as well as of the stoichiometry. Due to the one dimensional geometrical confinement imposed by the SiO2 barriers, the effective excess Si available for particle formation is reduced and hence spinodal growth sets in at higher SRON thicknesses [49]. As the Si excess in the SRON layer is increased, the SRON thickness threshold for spinodal decomposition is shifted to smaller values [49,50], a fact that is experimentally demonstrated in Figure 4."
