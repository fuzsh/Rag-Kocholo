        "text": "The Best Time to Visit Germany\n\nSD › Best Time to Visit Germany\n\nUpdated: June 2, 2022\n\nBy Santorini Dave\n\nWhen is the Best Time to Visit Germany?\n\nThe best time to visit Germany is from May through September, when the weather is pleasantly warm, with temperatures typically in the low to mid-20s. Especially during the peak of summer, expect thick tourist crowds and accommodation and airfare rates to be at the highest prices of the year.\n\nBest Time for Sightseeing: The best time for sightseeing in Germany is when the weather is decent but there aren’t so many tourists that lines are horrifically long, or views are interrupted. That usually means April and May or October, after the big crowds of Oktoberfest events have departed. Berlin is at its best from May to October.\n\nBest Time to Visit for Good Weather: The best time to visit Germany for good weather is from May through September, but if you’re hoping to avoid the rain, plan on visiting during the drier months of July and September, a time when you’ll see plenty of sunshine and warm temperatures with afternoon highs typically between 20°C and 25°C.\n\nBest Time to Visit for Festivals: While the German calendar is filled with festivals throughout the year, there is none bigger than Oktoberfest which typically takes place primarily in September. It runs for 16 days starting around the first day of autumn, bringing over six million people to Munich who consume around seven million liters of beer each year. If you hope to attend this bucket-list event, you’ll need to be here during the second half of September or early October.\n\nBest Time to Visit the Vineyards: The best time to visit Germany’s vineyards is from late April into early summer or immediately after the late autumn harvest. There are likely to be a long list of open-air wine festivals that bring opportunities for sampling the wine and all sorts of entertainment.\n\nBest Time to Visit Neuschwanstein Castle: Many come to Germany hoping to visit some of its magnificent castles, but there may be none finer than Neuschwanstein, the most popular in the country, located in Bavaria. People come from across the globe to see it, often in July and August which bring long lines and big crowds. If you come during this time, be sure to arrive an hour before opening to purchase your tickets for the first tour of the day, when the castle will be much quieter, and you won’t have to stand in what may feel like an endless line.\n\nGermany’s Travel Seasons\n\nHigh Season (mid-June through August, Oktoberfest and the Christmas holidays): Summer is peak tourist season, but Oktoberfest in late September and early October, and mid-December through early January are also considered high season. This is when you can expect the popular attractions throughout Germany to have long lines, while both airfare and accommodation will be at their highest prices of the year.\n\nShoulder Season (April through mid-June, the first half of September and mid- to late-October): The shoulder season is a good compromise between the high and low seasons. Spring weather can be unpredictable, sunny and warm or rain, hail, and possibly snow, sometimes all in the same day. Although the crowds won’t have arrived, you might find some discounted rates too. The first half of September is characterized by warm weather and diminishing crowds, while the second half of October usually offers decent if wetter weather along with brilliant autumn colors and better deals on rooms and airfare.\n\nLow Season (November through March, except mid-December through early January): While the calendar may say otherwise, winter in Germany usually begins in November, bringing dark, dreary cold days, frequently with freezing rain and snow in some places, especially in the south and east. This is the quietest time of year in the country, and the time you’re most likely to score good deals that make it much less expensive to visit.\n\nGermany Weather by Month\n\nGermany Weather in January: While the climate in Germany varies somewhat depending on location, January is generally the coldest, darkest month of the year with the average high temperature ranging around 3°C to 5°C and the low right around freezing. That means in most places snow is a possibility, although with the northern part of the country along the Baltic and North seas, in cities like Bremen and Hamburg, rain is more likely due to the milder climate. In the south on the other hand, around Munich, snowfall may be frequent – and in the east, around Berlin, it’s usually colder too. No matter where you plan to visit, if you go to Germany in January, be sure to bring warm clothing that can be layered, including thermal underwear, wool socks, gloves, scarves, and a hat. Be sure to plan itineraries around shorter days too, with less than 8 hours of daylight on January 1st. (Average Max Temperature: 3°C. Average Precipitation: 42mm.)\n\nGermany Weather in February: February is much like January in Germany though the average high temperature increases a couple degrees and there may be a few more sunny days for taking in the sights. Many areas are likely to see snow, especially in the south and east with the average low temperature still right around freezing. Pack accordingly for chilly, potentially wet weather, but you can look forward to longer days – by late February sunrise is just before 7 a.m. and the sun doesn’t set until around 5:45 p.m. (Average Max Temperature: 5°C. Average Precipitation: 34mm.)\n\nGermany Weather in March: Spring is a great time to visit Germany, although early March is likely to still feel like winter, the later in the month you arrive, the warmer it’s likely to be. The average high temperature increases significantly to around 8°C to 10°C, and even in the areas that typically get lots of snow, it’s likely to begin to melt or disappear altogether now. On average, there’s just 37mm of precipitation over 13 days in March, and with mornings and evenings rather chilly, you’ll still need that cold weather gear, including a warm coat and items that can be layered for easy removal in high indoor heat and sunny afternoons. (Average Max Temperature: 9°C. Average Precipitation: 37mm.)\n\nGermany Weather in April: Things are really warming up now with spring officially here, and days are longer for enjoying the sights and attractions too, with about 13 hours on the 1st and nearly 15 hours by late April. The mercury climbs to around 14°C in the afternoon and rainfall isn’t significant with 41mm of precipitation over 13 days this month. The sun is likely to be out more often to warm things up too. Although you’ll need to bring a mix of clothing for cooler mornings and evenings, a winter coat is unnecessary now. Bring both long- and short-sleeve shirts, and perhaps a sweater, sweatshirt or jacket to stay comfortable. (Average Max Temperature: 14°C. Average Precipitation: 41mm.)\n\nGermany Weather in May: May is one of the best times to travel to Germany with temperatures often idyllic and cherry blossoms in bloom. Now you can expect pleasant temperatures in the upper teens and occasionally the lower 20s. There is a greater possibility of rain this month, however, with about 55mm on average now. Look forward to plenty of sunshine and long days for outdoor activities and sightseeing. While you will need a sweater or jacket occasionally, there’s certainly no need for a heavy jacket now – sunglasses, however, will be. (Average Max Temperature: 19°C. Average Precipitation: 55mm.)\n\nGermany Weather in June: Summer has arrived, so if you plan to visit Germany now, expect long days and warm but not too hot temperatures. The average high is now 22°C but depending on where you are it can occasionally reach 25°C or a bit higher. Summers in the south tend to be hotter, while the north gets the cooling effect from the North and Baltic sea winds. Rain is a possibility no matter where you plan to be, so you might want to bring a light rain jacket along with summer attire like shorts, short-sleeve shirts, dresses and the like. (Average Max Temperature: 22°C. Average Precipitation: 71mm.)\n\nGermany Weather in July: It’s the peak of summer in Germany now, the time of year when you can expect the biggest crowds and hot temperatures in the mid- to upper-20s depending on where you are. In the north, the winds will have a pleasant cooling effect, but you can expect hotter temperatures inland along with high humidity. Brief rain showers will likely be welcomed to cool things off, which happen occasionally with around 53mm of precipitation in July on average. Average Max Temperature: 25°C. Average Precipitation: 53mm.)\n\nGermany Weather in August: While the average high dips a degree this month it’s likely to feel just as hot as July if not hotter due to the humidity, and it’s one of the rainier months of the year as well, with an average of 62mm of precipitation over 13 days. Bring that lightweight summer clothing along with a light waterproof jacket now, as well as those sunglasses and plenty of sunscreen for bright, sunny days. (Average Max Temperature: 24°C. Average Precipitation: 62mm.)\n\nGermany Weather in September: Early September will still be quite warm, but with autumn around the corner, there’s a change in the air with the average high dipping down to 20°C this month. If you plan your trip around the latter half, mornings and evenings can be rather cool so you may need a sweatshirt, sweater or light jacket along with a mix of clothing, including shorts and pants and both long- and short-sleeve shirts. While it’s not as rainy as June or August, you may want to toss in a portable umbrella too. (Average Max Temperature: 20°C Average Precipitation: 45mm.)\n\nGermany Weather in October: With fall in full swing, temperatures cool quite a bit. The afternoon high plunges all the way to 13°C, although it can be a wonderful time to be in Germany. There are usually lots of crisp, sunny days with little rain, an average of 36mm over 12 days now. Plan to dress in layers for both cooler and warmer days as well as cold mornings and nights, with the low temperature a chilly 6°C. With that chill in the air comes the time change later in the month which means shorter days to plan your itinerary around. By October 31, the sun rises at 7 a.m. and sets at 4:39 p.m. (Average Max Temperature:13°C. Average Precipitation: 36mm.)\n\nGermany Weather in November: If you plan to visit Germany in November, you’ll need to prepare for cold and the possibility of snow, especially in the southern and eastern regions. Visit in November and it will feel like winter has arrived, especially later in the month. The average low temperature is just above freezing at only 2°C, and depending on your location afternoons may not get much warmer, generally ranging around 5°C to 7°C. It’s time to bring out that winter gear, including a warm coat, boots, wool socks, gloves, and a hat. Dress in layers so that items can be easily removed when entering heated indoor attractions. (Average Max Temperature: 6°C. Average Precipitation: 48mm.)\n\nGermany Weather in December: December is another one of the coldest months in Germany with chances for snow relatively good as the low temperature is below freezing now at -1°C combined with 51mm of precipitation on average over 16 days now. If you bring appropriate clothing for staying dry and warm, it can be a great time to be here with all the Christmas markets, holiday lights, and hot cider. Keep in mind that days are especially short now, with the sun setting before 4 p.m. on December 21st, Winter Solstice. (Average Max Temperature: 3°C. Average Precipitation: 51mm.)\n\nGermany Events and Festivals\n\nGermany in January\n\nNew Year’s Day – January 1 is a national holiday in Germany.
