        "text": "The ANN models used to generate the workplace-specific climate projections were built with the python package Keras using TensorFlow (Christin et al. 2019). The ANNs consisted of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The single hidden layer used a sigmoid activation function, and the output layer a linear activation function. In the hidden layer were 16 neurons and a batch size of eight was used. The ANNs used the optimizer “adam” (Kingma and Ba 2017) with a default learning rate of 0.0001. The structure of the ANNs is the same as for the workplace-specific short-term indoor heat health warnings presented in Sulzer et al. (2023) where further details on the technical aspects of the ANNs and their evaluation can be found, including the testing of different input variables and a variable importance analysis.\n\nThe target data used for the training of the ANN models were measured by a custom-made low-cost sensor system, the “Mobile Biometeorological System” (MoBiMet), from Spring 2021 to Autumn 2022 in the Upper Rhine Valley region: at 51 workplaces in the area of Freiburg, Germany; 25 workplaces in the area of Basel, Switzerland; and 14 workplaces in the area of Strasbourg, France (Sulzer et al. 2022, 2023). The majority of the workplaces used for this study are offices (53), but also workplaces in laboratories and workshops (8), production (7), storage and logistics (10), as well as agriculture and forestry (12) were equipped with MoBiMets. The MoBiMets used calibrated low-cost sensors to measure Ti, RH, globe temperature (Tg, °C) to calculate Tmrt, and at workplaces with a high level of ventilation, mainly in agriculture and forestry, also v (Sulzer et al. 2022). PETi was calculated directly on the MoBiMets by the measurements of the sensors using the python code of Walther and Goestchel (2018) for a standardized person (Matzarakis et al. 2011). Sixty-nine of the 90 workplaces had active heating systems for the cold period, but only 3 of the 90 workplaces had manually operated active cooling systems.\n\nFor each workplace, two separate ANN models were trained, one for Ti and the other for PETi. The input data for the ANN models are hourly ERA5-Land data (Muñoz Sabater 2019) of the grid cells of Freiburg (48.0°N, 7.8°E), Basel (47.6°N, 7.6°E), and Strasbourg (48.6°N, 7.7°E). The meteorological variables used as input for the ANN models are Ta and dew point temperature (Td, °C) at 2 m above the surface, v at 10 m above the surface, and atmospheric pressure (p, hPa), global irradiance (G, W m−2), and long-wave downwelling radiation (AG, W m−2) at the surface. In addition to the meteorological data at target time t, the ANN models consider the data of Ta, G, and AG 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h prior to t. The ANNs were trained to reproduce the available target data Ti and PETi measured by the specific MoBiMet at each workplace for the period from February 2021 to October 2022 (in all cases, the MoBiMets were operated for at least one full year) by using the time-corresponding ERA5-Land data of the matching grid cell of Basel, Freiburg, or Strasbourg for each workplace.\n\nBefore building the ANN models for each workplace, the available data from the respective MoBiMet were randomly divided into training (80%), validation (10%), and test data sets (10%). During the training process, the weights are repeatedly adjusted to minimize the errors between the modeled output of the ANN and the target data provided in the training data. The validation data was used to counteract overfitting, by implementing an early stopping callback. The test data set is used in the end, after the training is completed, to compare the modeled data to the target data of a totally unknown data set and rate the ANN model’s accuracy (Chollet 2018). The mean absolute error (MAE) between the Ti modeled by the ANNs and the Ti measured by the sensors at the different workplaces in the independent test data set ranges between 0.39 and 2.76 K. The average MAE at all workplaces is 0.88 K. The MAE of the ANNs modeling PETi ranges from 0.40 to 2.41 K and the average MAE of all workplaces is 0.96 K.\n\nFor future periods, EURO-CORDEX data are used for the input to the ANNs. EURO-CORDEX data are climate projections downscaled to a horizontal resolution of 0.11° (Giorgi and Gutowski 2015). In total, 22 EURO-CORDEX climate projections were selected, which were available at a temporal resolution of 3 h at the Copernicus climate data store (Copernicus Climate Change Service, Climate Data Store 2019). These include nine combinations of six different general circulation models (GCMs), three different regional climate models (RCMs), and two ensemble members (r1i1p1 and r12i1p1) for the available data of the three RCPs 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 (Table 1).\n\nThe climate projection data nearest to the used ERA5-Land grid cell of Freiburg, Basel, and Strasbourg were extracted from the EURO-CORDEX data. To make EURO-CORDEX data comparable to ERA5 data, EURO-CORDEX data were bias corrected relative to ERA5-Land data before their use as input data for the ANNs. ERA5-Land data of 1970–1999 at a temporal resolution of 3 h were used as input data for workplace-specific ANN models to calculate the indoor thermal comfort at every workplace for the entire 30-year historical period 1970–1999 and to adjust the EURO-CORDEX data to the ERA5-Land data according to the quantile delta mapping (QDM) method using the historical modeled EURO-CORDEX data from 1970 to 1999 for all used variables of each climate projection (Cannon et al. 2015; Fauzi et al. 2020; Qian and Chang 2021). QDM is an improved version of quantile mapping (Qian and Chang 2021; Tong et al. 2021), a commonly used method in climate downscaling to bias-correct climate projections against observations (Thrasher et al. 2012; Fiddes et al. 2022). The R package “MBC: Multivariate Bias Correction of Climate Model Outputs” was used to perform the QDM bias correction (Cannon 2020). Next, bias-corrected data for the period from 2070 to 2099 was used as input data for the ANN models to generate the workplace-specific indoor climate projections. Six RCP2.6, seven RCP4.5, and nine RCP8.5 climate projections of each workplace were used to project the future time period from 2070 to 2099. It is an inherent part of the proposed data-driven methodology that all projections shown assume no changes to the building, building technology, or building surrounding. The dataflow for modeling indoor thermal comfort at the 90 workplaces for the historical and future periods is summarized in Fig. 1.\n\nFor calculating the frequency of indoor heat exposure, different exceedance thresholds were defined for Ti and PETi. The used exceedance thresholds for Ti were ≥ 26 °C, ≥ 30 °C, and ≥ 35 °C, according to the German Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (BAuA 2022). At Ti ≥ 26 °C, heat mitigation measures are recommended, and at Ti ≥ 30 °C, they are legally required (BAuA 2022). At Ti ≥ 35 °C, working in this room without technical or organizational measures or personal safety equipment is prohibited (BAuA 2022). The exceedance thresholds for PETi were ≥ 23 °C, ≥ 29 °C, ≥ 35 °C, and ≥ 41 °C: the human physiological stress thresholds for slight, moderate, strong, and extreme heat stress, respectively, according to Matzarakis et al. (1999). Because the temporal resolution of the modeled data was 3 h, the values exceeding a threshold were multiplied by three to convert them into exceedance hours per year. For the data analysis, the data of all climate projections is normalized to a “noleap” calendar. When the daily maximum value of PETi exceeds one of the thresholds, it was counted as a heat day with the respective category. This was used to investigate the change in total heat days per year and consecutive heat days per year for the time periods 1970–1999 and 2070–2099.\n\n3.1 Climate projections of air temperature at workplaces and outdoor air temperature\n\nTable 2 contains the modeled mean values and ranges of average indoor air temperature (Ti) at similar workplace types alongside the mean values and ranges of average outdoor air temperature (Ta) of the three cities in which the workplaces are located. The data are averaged for the full annual cycle, winter months (DJF), and summer months (JJA) separately for the period 1970–1999, and all climate projections within a given RCP are further combined into RCP2.6 (n = 6), RCP4.5 (n = 7), and RCP8.5 (n = 9) ensembles for the period 2070–2099. The mean value of the modeled Ti averaged over all workplaces is expected to rise for all three RCPs compared to the historical period (1970–1999).\n\nThe modeled rise until the future period (2070–2099) compared to the historical period, averaged over all workplaces, is + 0.5 K, + 0.8 K, and + 1.6 K for the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 ensembles, respectively. The projected increase is lower in winter and higher in summer. The expected rise between 1970–1999 and 2070–2099 of mean Ti averaged over all workplaces is + 0.3 K, + 0.5 K, and + 0.9 K during the winter months and + 0.8 K, + 1.2 K, and + 2.5 K during the summer months for the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 ensembles, respectively. In contrast, the projected mean values of the full annual cycle of outdoor Ta are projected to increase by + 1.5 K, + 2.4 K, and + 4.3 K in Freiburg; + 1.5 K, + 2.5 K, and + 4.5 K in Basel; and + 1.4 K, + 2.3 K, and + 4.3 K in Strasbourg for the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 ensembles, respectively. Thus, for the full year, the projected annual outdoor Ta is increasing more than Ti averaged over all workplaces. For the RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 ensembles, the projected increase of mean Ta is higher during the winter compared to the summer. In contrast, for the RCP8.5 ensemble, the projected increase of outdoor Ta during the summer months is up to + 1.0 K higher than during winter, which corresponds to a projected increase of mean Ta during the summer month of + 5.1 to + 5.4 K in the three cities. The differences between the three cities’ projected Ta increases are small, given their similar location in the Upper Rhine Valley within ~ 120 km and elevation between 140 and 280 m above sea level. The projected increase in Ti at the workplaces in agriculture and forestry is closest to the projected increase in Ta. The workplaces in agriculture and forestry are also the type of workplaces with the highest mean Ti increase, rising by + 3.2 K on average considering the most extreme RCP8.5 ensemble. The lowest increase for the RCP8.5 ensemble is projected in offices, by an average of + 1.1 K. Offices are also the type of workplaces with the lowest Ti increase for the summer, by + 2.1 K, and winter months, by + 0.3 K on average considering the RCP8.5 ensemble.\n\nIn Table 3, the average number and range of mean exceedance hours per year (hours in which Ti exceeds the thresholds of ≥ 26 °C, ≥ 30 °C, and ≥ 35 °C) are shown for the different workplace types. This is compared to the number of hours per year in which Ta exceeds the same thresholds outdoors.\n\nThe highest number of heat stress hours per year can, on average, be found at workplaces of the type production for all three Ti thresholds and all the different model input data used. The average lowest number of hours per year above 26 °C in the modeled historical time period can be found at the workplaces of type storage and logistics. For all three future RCPs, the lowest number of hours per year above 26 °C can be expected at the workplaces in agriculture and forestry. Values above the 30 °C exceedance threshold are least common in workshops and laboratories for the modeled years 1970–1999. In the modeled future ensembles of all three RCPs, Ti values ≥ 30 °C are least likely to appear at workplaces in storage and logistics, on average. In the modeled data, the average hours per year beyond 35 °C, in the historical and future period, are 0 h at all the workplaces in workshops and laboratories.\n\nAveraged over all workplaces the mean hours per year exceeding the value of 26 °C for Ti are rising for the modeled future time period, considering the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 ensembles, compared to the historical time period, by + 266 h (+ 29%), + 460 h (+ 51%), and + 1032 h (+ 114%), respectively. The projected mean numbers of hours per year averaged for the different workplace types exceeding the value of 26 °C for Ti in the historical and future time period, as well as the projected increase in percent, are shown in Fig. 2.\n\nThe projected increase averaged over all workplaces in hours per year with Ti values above 30 °C are + 71 h, + 117 h, and + 314 h for the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 ensembles, respectively. For the ≥ 35 °C Ti exceedance threshold, the projected increase in hours per year is + 10 h, + 18 h, and + 46 h for the different RCPs. Three workplaces show no Ti values above 26 °C in the modeled data for the historical and the future time periods; two of them are workplaces in offices equipped with active cooling systems. At 17 workplaces, Ti never exceeds 30 °C, and at 61 workplaces, Ti is also always under 35 °C in the modeled historical and future period. Outdoors Ta hours per year exceeding the ≥ 26 °C threshold rise by more than + 600 h, above 30 °C rise from < 20 to ≥ 300 h, and the 35 °C exceedance threshold rise from 0 h to an average of 61 h for the three cities considering the RCP8.5 ensemble. On average over all workplaces, the increase of heat stress hours per year exceeding the Ti thresholds is higher than for Ta outdoors, except for hours per year above 35 °C modeled by using the RCP8.5 ensemble.\n\n3.2 Workplace-specific climate projections of indoor physiologically equivalent temperature\n\n3.2.1 Frequency and intensity of heat stress\n\nFurther in this article, we will present the results of the modeled PETi at the workplaces to assess changes in thermal comfort. Averaged over all workplaces, the projected PETi is expected to rise from 20.7 °C by + 0.4 K, + 0.7 K, and + 1.2 K for RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 ensembles, respectively. In Fig. 3, the data of mean heat stress hours per year at all workplaces are summarized for the period 1970–1999 and the climate projections for the different RCPs and each individual ensemble member from 2070 to 2099 for PETi ≥ 23 °C (Fig. 3a), PETi ≥ 29 °C (Fig. 3b), and PETi ≥ 35 °C (Fig. 3c).\n\nThe median number of exceedance hours per year for the threshold PETi ≥ 23 °C is 2502 h, and the mean is 2662 h over all workplaces in the historical period. The median number of hours per year of all workplaces with PETi ≥ 23 °C increases in the future time period under all ensembles by + 424 h (2736–3187 h), + 752 h (3033–3484 h), and + 1358 h (3541–4163 h) for RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, respectively. For all workplaces, the median number of hours per year exceeding PETi ≥ 29 °C modeled for the historical period 1970–1999 is 140 h. The median of hours per year exceeding PETi ≥ 29 °C increases in all climate projections during the future period by + 174 h (145–365 h), + 285 h (243–565 h), and + 753 h (530–1435 h) under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 ensembles, respectively. The median of the number of heat hours per year for PETi ≥ 35 °C for all modeled workplaces is 0 h; the mean is 34 h. The projected increase of the mean hours per year averaged over all workplaces is + 55 h, considering the most extreme RCP8.5 ensemble for 2070–2099.\n\nFigure 4 compares the number of heat stress hours per year (Fig. 4a) and days per year (Fig. 4b) above the different PETi exceedance thresholds, modeled by using the ERA5-Land data for 1970–1999 vs. the RCP8.5 ensemble for 2070–2099. A day was counted as a heat stress day when the daily maximum PETi exceeded the corresponding PETi threshold.\n\nHeat stress hours per year above the PETi ≥ 23 °C threshold occur at all workplaces modeled for 1970–1999. The projected increase averaged over all workplaces for PETi ≥ 23 °C are + 1209 h, + 654 h, and + 379 h using the RCP8.5, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6 ensembles, respectively. In the median over all workplaces, the relative increase in hours with PETi ≥ 23 °C from 1970–1999 to 2070–2099 is + 17%, + 30%, and + 54% using the RCP8.5, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6 ensembles. For RCP8.5 as the most extreme projection, the heat stress days per year for the exceedance threshold PETi ≥ 23 °C will rise at 87 of 90 workplaces in the projected future. The increase of heat stress days per year above the PETi ≥ 23 °C threshold is + 41.8 days using the RCP8.5 ensemble.\n\nFor the modeled historical data (1970–1999), 78 of the 90 workplaces show at least 1 h per year with an exceedance of PETi ≥ 29 °C. The number of workplaces with at least 1 h per year of exceedance PETi ≥ 29 °C increases to 84 for the projected data of 2070–2099 using the RCP8.5 ensemble as input. Averaged over all workplaces, the heat stress hours per year for PETi ≥ 29 °C increase on average by + 668 h and days per year by + 44 days. For the exceedance threshold of PETi ≥ 29 °C, neither the heat stress days nor hours per year decline at any of the workplaces using the RCP8.5 ensemble.\n\nWhile PETi values above 35 °C were expected only at 23 of the 90 workplaces for the period 1970–1999, 29 of all monitored workplaces have at least once a year a condition with PETi values above 35 °C in the period 2070–2099, for RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 ensembles as well as 34 of the 90 workplaces for the RCP8.5 ensemble. Only two modeled workplaces exceeded heat hours per year of PETi ≥ 41 °C for more than 1 h in the historical period, but two more will reach the limit PETi ≥ 41 °C in the projected future period.\n\n3.2.2 Duration of heat stress\n\nIn Table 4, the average and range of the different workplace types mean duration of consecutive heat days per year, using the same PETi exceedance thresholds as before, are shown for the historical data (1970–1999) and the future (2070–2099) under RCP8.5. Averaged over all workplaces, the length of mean consecutive heat days per year is increasing by + 3.8 days for PETi ≥ 23 °C, + 4.5 days for PETi ≥ 29 °C, and + 0.5 days for PETi ≥ 35 °C in the modeled future.\n\n3.2.3 Hourly variability\n\nFigure 5 shows the mean frequency of thermal comfort levels according to the PETi, averaged over all workplaces for 1970–1999 and for 2070–2099 using the RCP8.5 ensemble. Included are the full annual cycle, the different seasons winter (DJF), spring (MAM), summer (JJA), and autumn (SON), as well as typical working hours, defined as 09:00 UTC to 18:00 UTC.\n\nAveraged over all workplaces, the proportion of hours with no thermal stress is 51% in the historical period 1970–1999, and this declines to 43%, 47%, and 49% in the projected future period (2070–2099) under RCP8.5, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6, respectively. On average, heat stress (PETi ≥ 23 °C) occurs during 30% of the time in the historical period and increases to 44%, 38% and 35% in the projected future period for RCP8.5, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6, respectively. Only considering working hours (09:00–18:00 UTC), the portion without any thermal stress is 4% lower than for the full data set in the modeled historical and future periods. The fraction of heat stress during working hours is 37% for the years 1970–1999 and 50%, 44%, and 41% for 2070–2099 under RCP8.5, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6, respectively. Averaged over all workplaces, the portion of moderate heat stress or higher is expected to triple under RCP8.5, from 4 to 12%, and to 7% and 6% for RCP4.5 and RCP2.6 ensembles. During typical working hours, the occurrence of moderate heat stress or higher will increase from 6% in the modeled historical period to 15%, 10%, and 8% in the projected future period for RCP8.5, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6, respectively.\n\n3.2.4 Seasonal variability\n\nIn all four seasons, heat stress (PETi ≥ 23 °C) will be more frequent in the projected future period (2070–2099) compared to the historical period (1970–1999). In winter, the thermally comfortable portion (18 °C < PETi < 23 °C) will rise from 63% in the historical period by + 4%, + 3%, and + 2% in the projected future period under RCP8.5, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6. Further, in winter, the increase in heat stress frequency is + 3% in the future period under RCP8.5 and + 1% under RCP4.5 and RCP2.6 compared to the historical period. This increase is less compared to other seasons. In spring, the frequency of heat stress averaged over all workplaces increases from 22% in the historical period to 35%, 29%, and 26% in the projected future period under RCP8.5, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6, respectively. In the modeled historical and projected future period, summer is most critical for heat stress. In the historical time period, on average, 70% of the summertime is characterized by heat stress, including 11% of moderate heat stress or higher (PETi ≥ 29 °C). For the period 2070–2099, under RCP8.5, the average fraction of time projected to experience heat stress is 89% with 33% of moderate heat stress or higher. Similarly, for RCP4.5 and RCP2.6, the fraction of time projected to experience heat stress is 82% and 78%, with 20% and 16% of moderate heat stress or higher. The portion without thermal stress in summer declines from 25 to 9%, 16%, and 19% for RCP8.5, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6. The strongest projected relative increase of heat stress occurrence, by + 21% to a value of 44% for RCP8.5 and to 29%, and 24% for RCP4.5 and RCP2.6 is found in autumn. Also, time periods of moderate heat stress or higher rise from 2 to 7%, 4% and 3% in autumn under future projections for RCP8.5, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6. Simultaneously thermally comfortable conditions decrease from 57 to 44%, 51%, and 54% for the months in autumn under RCP8.5, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6.\n\n3.2.5 Differentiation by workplace\n\nThe frequency of thermal stress levels according to PETi is presented for each workplace separately in Fig. 6 for the historical data (Fig. 6a) and the RCP2.6 (Fig. 6b), RCP4.5 (Fig. 6c), and RCP8.5 (Fig. 6d) ensembles. The workplaces in Fig. 6 are organized by workplace type and, within the same type, by descending heat stress frequency (PETi ≥ 23 °C) in the historical time period, from left to right. Figure 6 highlights the differences in thermal behavior at the 90 workplaces, during historical and future climate conditions, as well as the differences in shifts of thermal comfort classes under a changing climate. All workplaces have one aspect in common: heat stress will occur more frequently in the projected future, regardless of the considered RCP and type of workplace. But the frequency and intensity of the additional heat stress in the future show large variations between different workplaces, even within the same workplace type. Also, uncertainties increase for climate projections of higher RCPs, but this can also be an effect of the different numbers of climate projections available for the three RCPs.\n\nTo further explore thermal comfort situations and projected changes expected in the future at different workplaces in more detail, examples of PETi distributions are shown for four workplaces located in Freiburg, in Fig. 7. The distributions of the modeled 30-year historical (1970–1999) and future time periods (2070–2099) are presented for the RCP8.5, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6 ensembles. The example workplaces are located in an office on the first/ground floor (Fig. 7a), an office on the third/top floor directly under a sloping roof in the same building (Fig. 7b), a workplace in production (Fig. 7c), and a workplace in agriculture (Fig. 7d).\n\nThe building, in which the two presented offices are located in, was built around 1900 in Freiburg’s city center, mainly of stone. Both offices are single-occupancy and have a computer and a heating system. The office on the ground floor has windows facing west; the office on the third (top) floor has windows facing east. The all-year mean PETi in the office on the ground floor is 23.1 °C and 21.0 °C on the top floor for the historical 1970–1999 period. Heat stress is more common on the ground floor, but mostly light heat stress. Cold stress and moderate heat stress or higher are more likely to appear in the office on the third floor. The projected rise of heat stress hours per year is similar in both offices: on the ground floor + 1332 h (+ 15.2%), + 729 h (+ 8.3%), and + 456 h (+ 5.2%); on top floor + 1349 h (+ 15.4%), + 771 h (+ 8.8%), + 420 h (+ 4.8%) for RCP8.5, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6, respectively. On the top floor, however, the projected increase in the occurrence of moderate heat stress or a higher stress level class, taking the RCP8.5 ensemble into account, is considerably higher with + 1130 h (+ 12.9%) compared to the projected increase of + 675 h (+ 7.7%) on the ground floor. Also, the projected mean PETi rise of + 2.2 K is higher on the third floor than the projected rise of + 1.3 K on the ground floor, considering the RCP8.5 ensemble. The frequency of comfortable thermal conditions will decline in the projected future in both offices, even though the frequency of cold stress declines by up to − 12% in the office on the top floor.\n\nThe workplace in production is located on the third floor in a brick building built circa 1940 in a chemical factory complex in Freiburg’s industrial area. The workplace is next to heavy machinery generating waste heat and north-facing windows. The mean value of PETi will increase from 32.4 °C in the historical period by + 0.1 K, + 0.5 K, and + 1.1 K in the projected future period, for the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 ensembles, respectively. The frequency of overall heat stress cannot increase at this workplace, because it is already at 100% for the modeled historical period and will stay at 100% for the modeled future. But the frequency of strong and extreme heat stress is expected to increase by + 8% and + 2%, respectively, when the data of the RCP8.5 ensemble are considered.\n\nThe workplace in agriculture is located approximately 10 km northeast of Freiburg. This is a workplace located in a cowshed built around 2000 with the main construction materials wood and concrete. The workplace is exposed to direct solar radiation from the west. Additional heat sources at this workplace are cows and occasionally a tractor. The PETi values show a wide range of − 4.3 to 39.4 °C in the historical period, and a mean of 11.4 °C. In the future, the projected mean value will increase by + 1.3 K, + 2.3 K, and + 4.1 K for the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 ensembles. PETi values in the comfortable range will become more common in the projected future, because of the decline in frequency of cold stress. But the frequency of heat stress at all levels is projected to increase under all RCPs."
