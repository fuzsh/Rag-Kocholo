        "text": "Quote:\n\nOriginally Posted by dunno what to put here\n\nMost places with cold winters and warm summers have precipitation peak in the summer due to downpours/thunderstorms in summer, and colder, drier air in winter. Even here our driest month is February and August is the wettest.\n\nIt can get a little more complicated though. Admittedly the rainfall variations are rather small anyway, but in locations near and east of NZ's alps the exposure or lack of it to onshore easterly rains or montane northwesterly spillover causes the seasons of maxima and minima to vary quite a lot in timing. (Not that I'm claiming the annual temperature range is all that great). At Tekapo village where the mean winter temperature is 2.5C (1.7C in July) winter is significantly wetter than summer, which is the driest season. However in some places as little as only 20km away east of a high range of foothills the wettest months are in early summer and can be almost twice as wet as the driest ones (in midwinter).\n\nLast edited by RWood; 09-20-2011 at 01:32 PM..\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by tom77falcons\n\nI know the UK is on the cloudy side, but I didn't realize even far south Germany was also. I guess except for the Med, Europe is far cloudier than the US.\n\nWinters here are not too bad, the rest a little too cool. I'd say D+.\n\nI've never been able to track down a Europe-wide sunshine map (probably because there's no Europe-wide weather service) but Germany is not really that much sunnier than us on average, take a look:\n\nand for France, which is notably sunnier (I couldn't fully explain why):\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by LondonAreaWeatherSummary\n\nWhat about Karlsruhe. I thought that was warmest.\n\nIt may well be, according to these tables, though there's not much in it:\n\nIntellicast - Karlsruhe Historic Weather Averages in Germany\n\nIntellicast - Freiburg/Breisgau Historic Weather Averages in Germany\n\nFreiburg markets itself as the place with the best climate in Germany because of the extra sunshine though I think, which Der Spiegel seems to agree with:\n\nNeue Daten f√ºr alle Regionen: Deutschlands wahres Klima - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Nachrichten - Wissenschaft"
