Its not raining - just a marine overcast/fog, but its quite cool none the less. You do get acclimated to any climate and when you have to go somewhere hot you really feel it. I prefer the \"natural air-conditioning\" myself. A lot of people do miss the warm summer weather when they first move here though.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Rozenn\n\nI agree with you on the British/German climate thing but gotta say that NO German city averages over 25°C, and by far.\n\nThe Rhine valley cities (Mannheim, Karlsruhe, Freiburg...) barely reach 20°C in July/August.\n\nI think what he meant was the average daytime high, which is above 25°C in all of those three cities, and comes close to this value in the entire Rhine valley from the Dutch border (Nijmegen, 24°C) right down to Darmstadt, where it surpasses this mark.\n\nOf course, when one counts the month average, it ranges from slightly over 18°C in Nijmegen to almost 21°C in Freiburg, but this also includes the overnight lows. Averages along the Rhine would be 13/24 in Nijmegen, 14/25 in Cologne, 14/26 in Mannheim and 15/27 in Freiburg.\n\nExcept for the home counties, no place in Britain gets anywhere near these values, but to exceed averages of 25°C, one needs to go as far south as around 40 degrees latitude... Averages highs of 25°C can be found as far north as the middle-Rhine though...\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by patrix542\n\nnice maps you found but i lived in poland and germany and now i live in UK and German summers are MUCH armer no matter what is says on the map, 30C in uk is extremely rare while in Germany its usual and it gets over 35C every year too.\n\nas for colder winters... to most of people its a good thing because guess what- winters are supposed to be cold and snowy.
