        "meta_description": "Abstract. In 2018, large parts of northern Europe were affected by an extreme drought. A better understanding of the characteristics and the large-scale atmospheric circulation driving such events is of high importance to enhance drought forecasting and mitigation.\nThis paper examines the historical extremeness of the MayâAugustÂ 2018 meteorological situation and the accompanying meteorological and hydrological (streamflow and groundwater) drought. Further, it investigates the relation between the large-scale atmospheric circulation and summer streamflow in the Nordic region.\nIn May and JulyÂ 2018, record-breaking temperatures were observed in large parts of northern Europe associated with blocking systems centred over Fennoscandia and sea surface temperature anomalies of more than 3ââC in the Baltic Sea.\nExtreme meteorological drought, as indicated by the 3-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI3) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI3), was observed in May and covered large parts of northern Europe by July.\nStreamflow drought in the Nordic region started to develop in June, and in July 68â% of the stations had record-low or near-record-low streamflow. Extreme streamflow conditions persisted in the southeastern part of the region throughout 2018.\nMany groundwater wells had record-low or near-record-low levels in July and August. However, extremeness in groundwater levels and (to a lesser degree) streamflow showed a diverse spatial pattern. This points to the role of local terrestrial processes in controlling the hydrological response to meteorological conditions.\nComposite analysis of low summer streamflow and 500âmbar geopotential height anomalies revealed two distinct patterns of summer streamflow variability: one in western and northern Norway and one in the rest of the region. Low summer streamflow in western and northern Norway was related to high-pressure systems centred over the Norwegian Sea. In the rest of the Nordic region, low summer streamflow was associated with a high-pressure system over the North Sea and a low-pressure system over Greenland and Russia, resembling the pattern of 2018.\nThis study provides new insight into hydrometeorological aspects of the 2018 northern European drought and identifies large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns associated with summer streamflow drought in the Nordic region.",

        "text": "From May and throughout the summer of 2018, the northern and parts of central Europe experienced drought and record-breaking and persistent high temperatures, leading to severe impacts across a range of sectors (TableÂ 1). Drought is a complex phenomenon characterised by below average natural water availability affecting all components of the hydrological cycle. Unlike most other natural hazards, it is a âcreeping phenomenonâ with a wide range of economic, societal, and environmental impacts gradually accumulating over time and space (Stahl etÂ al.,Â 2016; Mishra and Singh,Â 2010; Tallaksen and VanÂ Lanen,Â 2004).\n\nIn 2018, wild fires destroyed vast areas in northern and central Europe. Sweden was especially impacted, with a record-breaking 24â310âha (835â% of annual average) of burnt area (TableÂ 1a). The drought also led to a significant drop in EU cereal production, whereas beef production grew more than expected due to increased slaughter following fodder shortage (TableÂ 1b). In Scandinavia and Germany, wheat and barley yields were described as catastrophically low (TableÂ 1câf). Ecosystems in northern Europe are less adapted to extremely dry conditions as compared to other European regions, and direct negative impacts on terrestrial ecosystem productivity were both significantly higher and more widespread in 2018 compared to the more southerly located extreme drought in 2003 (Buras etÂ al.,Â 2020). Already in June, the water volumes in Nordic hydropower reservoirs dropped well below normal, which together with high fuel prices caused the JulyâAugust power rates to be the highest in 20Â years (TableÂ 1g, h). Record low river levels disrupted main inland waterways in central Europe, forcing transportation ships to reduce their loads by up to 85â% (TableÂ 1i, j). Low water levels in the river Elbe exposed World WarÂ 2 munitions (TableÂ 1k) and so-called hunger stones with centuries-old low water level marks along with dire warnings (TableÂ 1l). Extremely low streamflow and high river temperatures led to fishing bans in major salmon fishing rivers in Norway (TableÂ 1m). Low groundwater tables led Swedish municipalities to ban residents from using water from the municipal network for anything other than drinking (TableÂ 1n). The high costs and wide range of impacts associated with the 2018 drought emphasise the need to improve the understanding of such extreme high-impact events affecting large regions in Europe. The latter requires transnational data and international collaboration for in-depth analyses.\n\nTo understand how the severity and timing of impacts vary among and within drought-affected areas, it is important to distinguish between different stages of drought development. Typically, three types of drought are distinguished, reflecting the propagation of drought through the hydrological cycle: meteorological, soil moisture, and hydrological (streamflow and groundwater) drought (Tallaksen and VanÂ Lanen,Â 2004). Meteorological drought refers to a precipitation deficit often combined with abnormally high (potential) evapotranspiration. If a meteorological drought is sustained, it typically causes soil moisture drought, which mainly concerns water deficits in the root zone impacting water uptake by vegetation (VanÂ Loon,Â 2015). When soil moisture depletes, a positive feedback loop may occur due to a reduction in the latent heat flux (less energy is used for evapotranspiration) and an associated increase in the sensible heat flux (more energy is used to heat the air), which in turn increases the near-surface temperature (Seneviratne etÂ al.,Â 2010). Soil moisture drought can further reduce groundwater recharge and water sources that feed streams and rivers. This may, depending on the catchment characteristics and initial hydrological conditions, lead to groundwater and streamflow drought (Tallaksen and VanÂ Lanen,Â 2004). Several studies have demonstrated how meteorological and hydrological droughts develop differently in space and time (e.g.Â Barker etÂ al.,Â 2016; Kumar etÂ al.,Â 2016; Haslinger etÂ al.,Â 2014; Vidal etÂ al.,Â 2010; Tallaksen etÂ al.,Â 2009; Peters etÂ al.,Â 2003; Changnon,Â 1987). The delay between a meteorological and a hydrological drought may amount to several months, with groundwater typically being the last to react and the last to recover (Hisdal and Tallaksen,Â 2000). The concept drought, unless specified, refers broadly to the multifaceted phenomenon that includes all three types of drought, along with their specific characteristics.\n\nMany large-scale studies on drought focus on the meteorological aspect, such as anomalies in precipitation or climatic water balance (i.e. precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration), as this is based on data often easily at hand (e.g.Â Ionita etÂ al.,Â 2017; Stagge etÂ al.,Â 2017; Vicente-Serrano etÂ al.,Â 2014; Bordi etÂ al.,Â 2009). As opposed to meteorological data, transboundary near-real-time observations of hydrological variables are generally lacking, making timely observation-based large-scale soil moisture, streamflow, or groundwater drought assessments challenging (Liu etÂ al.,Â 2018; Laaha etÂ al.,Â 2016; Hannah etÂ al.,Â 2011). Long-term observational soil moisture data are sparse except for satellite-based estimates covering only a few centimetres depth (Hirschi etÂ al.,Â 2014; Kerr,Â 2007), which is too shallow to include the root zones of main vegetation types (e.g.Â Yang etÂ al.,Â 2016; Schenk and Jackson,Â 2002). Updated streamflow and groundwater level observations usually need to be collected in a country-by-country manner, which is time consuming as well as challenging due to differences in agency structure, data quality requirements, availability of physiographic properties, and information on human influence. Despite these challenges, research on large-scale droughts cannot rely solely on meteorological data (VanÂ Lanen etÂ al.,Â 2016). Drought assessments using hydrological data are needed to investigate the drought footprint on water resources, which is of high importance for hydropower, navigation, water use sectors, and freshwater ecosystems among others (Laaha etÂ al.,Â 2016; Stahl etÂ al.,Â 2016).\n\nA key natural driver of drought is persistent high-pressure systems leading to prolonged periods of low precipitation and/or high evapotranspiration (Tallaksen and VanÂ Lanen,Â 2004). To improve drought forecasts and projections, we therefore need a better understanding of the relation between the different types of drought and their large-scale atmospheric and oceanographic drivers. Stationary Rossby waves have been found to play an important role in the development of summer patterns of monthly surface temperature and precipitation variability across northern Eurasia, and they appear to have led to the extreme heat wave and drought in 2003 and 2010 (Schubert etÂ al.,Â 2014, 2011). Kingston etÂ al. (2015) found that the most widespread and long-duration meteorological droughts in Europe fall into two categories: northern European droughts with onsets associated with an Atlantic meridional-dipole atmospheric circulation anomaly similar to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and droughts elsewhere in Europe associated with anomalies related to a northeastward expansion of the Azores High, resembling an eastern Atlantic/western Russia (EA/WR) atmospheric circulation pattern. Fleig etÂ al. (2011) investigated the relation between various circulation types and streamflow drought in Denmark and Great Britain. They found that hydrological droughts are most frequently linked to circulation types representing a high-pressure system over the region affected by drought, which promote hydrological drought development by advection of warm dry air. In addition to stationary high- and low-pressure systems, sea surface temperatures associated with large-scale climate modes of variability have also been found to be important drivers for dryness and wetness variability over Europe (Ionita etÂ al.,Â 2015, 2012). In a study of streamflow drought in Great Britain, Kingston etÂ al. (2013) found statistically significant sea surface temperature and atmospheric anomalies linked to drought onset. The authors emphasise the shortcomings in the ability of circulation indices (such as NAO) to capture fully the atmospheric variation preceding drought onsets, highlighting the value of composite analysis in developing an improved understanding of oceanâatmosphereâdrought connections.\n\nThe 2018 event was unique in the northern location of the high-pressure system initiating the drought, as compared to other major European drought events in the last decades (Ionita etÂ al.,Â 2017; Stahl,Â 2001). The affected Nordic region (Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland) exhibits a high heterogeneity in terrestrial and hydroclimatological characteristics. Despite its rather limited size, the region spans several latitudes and has a pronounced westâeast gradient in climate and topography, ranging from high mountains in the west to low-lying regions in the south and east. Prevailing westerly winds run northeastwards from the Atlantic, bringing abundant rainfall along the west coast. Orographic effects lead to large local variability in precipitation in the western part of the region. Denmark, southern Sweden, and the western coast of Norway have a maritime climate, in contrast to the more continental climate in eastern Norway, Sweden, and Finland. The landscape is largely affected by the last glaciations, with typical landforms such as U-shaped valleys, fjords, and lakes, as well as a large spatial heterogeneity in glacial deposits. Land cover varies with vast areas of bare rock and shallow deposits in the west and north; undulating inland areas characterised by numerous lakes, forests, and wetlands; and areas in the south with thick soils and large aquifers (e.g.Â SÃ¸mme,Â 1960). Combined with the important effect of seasonal snow on hydrology, varying with latitude and altitude, excluding the very south, the result is a high diversity in hydroclimatological conditions.\n\nIn depth analyses of historical drought events, what triggers them, and how they manifest themselves in the hydrological cycle enable us to increase our understanding of this complex phenomenon, which is vital to enhance drought forecasting, projection, and mitigation. Motivated by these considerations, this paper focuses on characterising the 2018 drought in northern Europe in a historical context. Traditionally, anomaly maps (in absolute or relative terms) have been used to characterise the meteorological situation of past European events and their spatio-temporal development. Recent examples include events such as the major European droughts in 2003 (Black etÂ al.,Â 2004), 2010 (Barriopedro etÂ al.,Â 2011), and 2015 (Ionita etÂ al.,Â 2017). Ranking maps are another way of communicating the extremeness of an event in a long-term perspective, which is simple and easy to communicate (e.g.Â Ionita etÂ al.,Â 2017). By ranking the events selected from a time series (e.g. one value each year) according to their magnitude (e.g. temperature), one can map the rank of a particular event, compared to all other years on record, across a region of interest. In this study, we embed both of these approaches, i.e. mapping 2018 anomalies relative to a period of reference (1971â2000) and ranking maps for the 2018 event based on the 60-year period 1959â2018.\n\nThe aim of the study is twofold: (1)Â to investigate the extremeness of the 2018 situation and the accompanying meteorological and hydrological drought in northern Europe and (2)Â to identify large-scale atmospheric circulations associated with below-normal summer streamflow in the Nordic region. The latter is investigated using empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), which is a well-known method to detect spatial patterns of variability and how they change with time. In Ionita etÂ al. (2015), EOFs are used to study the variability in meteorological drought in Europe and its relation to geopotential height, which is similar to the approach adopted here for the main patterns of summer streamflow variability.\n\nThe paper is organised as follows: the data and methods are described in Sects.Â 2 and 3, respectively. In Sect.Â 4 (Results), the 2018 meteorological situation (Sect.Â 4.1), meteorological drought (Sect.Â 4.2), and hydrological drought (Sect.Â 4.3) are presented, and the relation between summer streamflow and large-scale atmospheric circulation is investigated (Sect.Â 4.4). A detailed discussion is provided in Sect.Â 5, followed by the conclusion in Sect.Â 6.\n\nThe variables, indices (including periods used), and spatial coverages used to characterise the 2018 meteorological situation, meteorological drought, and hydrological drought are summarised in TableÂ 2. From looking at a large spatial domain, including Europe and its surrounding regions, when describing the main climate drivers, the analysis gradually âzooms inâ on the Nordic region, which experienced the most extreme meteorological situation in spring and summer of 2018. Calculations were done for each month in 2018; however, the results mainly focus on the period MayâAugust.\n\n3.1âMeteorological situation\n\nThe extremeness of the meteorological situation for each month was analysed using the sea surface temperature (SST), geopotential height at 500âmbar (HGT500), monthly means of daily maximum air temperature (Tx), and monthly precipitation (P). For HGT500 and SST, the 2018 anomalies (in metres and degrees Celsius, respectively) relative to the reference period (1971â2000) were computed for each month in the period over Europe and the surrounding regions. The reference period (1971â2000) was chosen to allow for easier comparison with other studies (e.g.Â Ionita etÂ al.,Â 2017). We note that a more recent 30-year reference period would result in different values as such, e.g. in the presence of a (overall warming) trend. In addition, mean MayâAugust HGT500 60-year (1959â2018) time series and corresponding 2018 anomalies (in standard deviations from the 60-year mean) were computed for each subdomain of 20â longitude Ã 20â latitude throughout the European domain, i.e. the area 35â80ââN and 12.5ââWâ42.5ââE moving one grid cell (2.5â) at a time. This allowed the extremeness in the persistent high-pressure system for the whole MayâAugust period to be estimated.\n\nThe extremeness in temperature and precipitation was analysed by ranking maps of each month in 2018. First, Tx and P were computed for the 60-year period (1959â2018), and for each month the years were ordered from the most extreme (highest temperature and lowest precipitation) to the least extreme value. Then, ranking maps of 2018 were made by finding the position (rank) of 2018 if it were among the six highest temperatures (in the case of Tx) or six lowest precipitation totals (in the case of P). Similar maps were computed for the European 2015 drought by Ionita etÂ al. (2017) using the period 1950â2015. In the case of ties between years, 2018 was set as the least extreme of the years with equal values. This was done to avoid exaggerating the extremeness of 2018 in terms of precipitation totals, such as in some Mediterranean regions where it is not uncommon with months with zero precipitation. A rank ofÂ 1 implies record-breaking high temperature (in the case of Tx) or low precipitation (in the case of P) in 2018, a rank ofÂ 2 indicates that 2018 had the second most extreme value in that month, etc. Here, temperature and precipitation with ranks of 1â6 are referred to as extreme. The ranks correspond to specific percentiles of the data, such that a rank of 3 or 6 corresponds to the 5th or 10th percentile, respectively, when the period under investigation is 60Â years.\n\n3.2âMeteorological drought indices\n\nThe meteorological drought of each month (MayâAugustÂ 2018) was assessed using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI;Â McKee etÂ al.,Â 1993; Guttman,Â 1999) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI;Â Vicente-Serrano etÂ al.,Â 2010; BeguerÃ­a etÂ al.,Â 2014). A 3-month accumulation period was chosen in both cases (i.e. SPI3 and SPEI3) to reflect the seasonality in northern European climate (World Meteorological Organization,Â 2012).\n\nSPI is recommended as a meteorological drought index for drought monitoring by the World Meteorological Organization and Global Water Partnership (2016). It is a widely used measure of precipitation anomalies that can be compared across locations with different climatology and highly non-normal precipitation distributions (Stagge etÂ al.,Â 2014). SPEI is a more recent drought index that measures normalised anomalies in the climatic water balance, defined as precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration (PET;Â Vicente-Serrano etÂ al.,Â 2010). As opposed to SPI, SPEI takes into account atmospheric variables other than precipitation that may affect drought. Additional atmospheric variables to include depend on the equation chosen to estimate PET. The Hargreaves equation (Hargreaves and Samani,Â 1985) was used in this study following the recommendation by Stagge etÂ al. (2014). The Hargreaves equation estimates daily PET based on each day's mean temperature, the difference between daily minimum and maximum temperature (proxy for net radiation), and an estimate of (extraterrestrial) radiation based on the latitude and day of the year.\n\nSPI3 (SPEI3) was computed by (1)Â fitting 3-month accumulated P (or P-PET) in the reference period 1971â2000 to a parametric distribution, (2)Â transforming non-exceedance probabilities from the parametric distribution to the standard normal distribution, and finally (3)Â using the normal distribution to estimate the 2018 anomaly in terms of standard deviations (Lloyd-Hughes and Saunders,Â 2002; Guttman,Â 1999; McKee etÂ al.,Â 1993). Both SPI and SPEI rely on the choice of reference period and parametric distribution. To assess the effect of reference period, we calculated the SPI3 and SPEI3 in 2018 using the 60-year period (1959â2018) as reference in addition to 1971â2000. Compared to 1971â2000, the 1959â2018 reference period shifted SPI3 and SPEI3 values between 0 and â3 (dry range) to slightly less extreme values in regions affected by major droughts after 2000 (mainly central, southwestern, and eastern Europe). Most of the Nordic region, however, showed a slight shift to more extreme values. The main purpose of including SPI and SPEI was to map the meteorological drought dynamic, and we found overall similar spatio-temporal developments of SPI3 and SPEI3 when comparing the two reference periods. In terms of parametric distribution, this study followed the recommendations by Stagge etÂ al. (2015) to use the gamma distribution for the SPI calculation, including a âcentre of massâ adjustment for zero precipitation periods and the generalised extreme value distribution for the SPEI calculation. Except for differences in input data and transformation procedure to the standard normal distribution, the computation routine is the same for SPEI and SPI, and the multi-temporal nature and statistical interpretability of the two indices are therefore also the same (Stagge etÂ al.,Â 2014). SPI and SPEI were calculated using the RÂ package SCI developed by Gudmundsson and Stagge (2016).\n\nDry conditions are represented by negative SPI and SPEI values and wet conditions by positive values. A categorisation of SPI values is found in Lloyd-Hughes and Saunders (2002), defining SPI values between â1 and â1.5 (9.2â% probability) as moderate drought, SPI values between â1.5 and â2 (4.4â% probability) as severe drought, and SPI values less than â2 (2.3â% probability) as extreme drought. Correspondingly, positive SPI values are categorised as moderately wet (1â1.5), severely wet (1.5â2), or extremely wet (>â2). This categorisation was adopted for the interpretation of the SPI3 and SPEI3 results in this study.\n\n3.3âHydrological drought\n\nThe extremeness in streamflow and groundwater level was analysed by calculating the monthly means and ranking the lowest values (low streamflow and low groundwater tables) for each month, following the same procedure as for temperature and precipitation (Sect.Â 3.1). For streamflow, the 60-year period 1959â2018 was used as a basis for the ranking and thus the same percentile equivalents as for temperature and precipitation apply. A 30-year period was used for groundwater due to the generally shorter time series. Thus, a rank in groundwater of 3 or 6 corresponds to the 10th or 20th percentile, respectively.\n\nThe response in groundwater to climatic input is often delayed and smoothed; however, the delay may vary greatly from site to site, affecting the occurrence and duration of groundwater drought (VanÂ Loon,Â 2015; VanÂ Loon and VanÂ Lanen,Â 2012). Here, the delay in groundwater response to precipitation was assessed, defined as the accumulation period (at daily resolution) of the nearest grid cell's daily precipitation yielding the highest correlation between accumulated precipitation and daily groundwater levels for the period 1989â2018.\n\n3.4âEmpirical orthogonal function analysis and composite maps\n\nKey patterns in large-scale atmospheric circulation associated with low and high summer streamflow in the Nordic region were analysed by computing the HGT500 anomalies for the years of high and low anomalies. The anomalies were identified by the first three principle components resulting from an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of the summer streamflow data. An EOF analysis allows for insight into the most dominant modes of variability in a complex temporally and spatially varying dataset by decomposing the dataset into fixed spatial patterns (EOFs) with corresponding time series (principle components, PCs), each representing a given proportion of the total variance in the dataset (Wilks,Â 2006). The magnitude of a given EOF loading gives the strength of the relation between the summer streamflow time series and the corresponding PC. A negative EOF loading represents an inverse relation between the summer streamflow time series and the corresponding PC, which can take on both negative and positive values. Mean summer (JuneâAugust) streamflows were computed for each year (1959â2018) and the time series standardised and detrended prior to the EOF analysis. The JuneâAugust period was chosen for the analysis (rather than MayâAugust, which is in focus in Sect.Â 3.1â3.3) to avoid the effect of high flow in May caused by snowmelt. Furthermore, EOF analysis and composite maps are traditionally done on a 3-month seasonal basis, making the results more easily comparable to other studies. The EOFs and PCs were calculated using the Python library eofs (Dawson,Â 2016). For each of the principle components (PCs), years with absolute values larger than 1Â standard deviation were defined as high (positive values) and low (negative values) anomaly years. For each set, we computed âhigh years composite mapsâ and âlow years composite mapsâ of concurrent (mean summer; JuneâAugust) HGT500 anomalies. The significance of the composite maps was estimated by a two-sided tÂ test at a 5â% significance level.\n\n4.1âMeteorological situation\n\nFigureÂ 3aâd shows the evolution of SST anomalies from May to AugustÂ 2018 as compared to the reference period (1971â2000; all months throughout 2018 are shown in Fig.Â A1). The strongest SST anomalies in the seas surrounding Europe in 2018 were found in MayâSeptember. Patterns of negative and positive SST anomalies were relatively stable from May to September, characterised by one negative and two positive anomalous SST centres. The strongest negative SST anomalies were found in an area south of Greenland (50â60ââN), whereas strong positive SST anomalies were found below this area, in a belt from 20 to 80ââW at approx. 40ââN. A second region of positive SST anomalies was found in the regions surrounding Europe between 0 and 40ââE (Barents Sea, Norwegian Sea, North Sea, Baltic Sea, Black Sea, and parts of the Mediterranean Sea). The highest SST anomalies exceeded 3ââC and were found in the Baltic Sea.\n\nHGT500 anomalies for each month (MayâAugustÂ 2018) as compared to the reference period (1971â2000) are shown in Fig.Â 3eâh (all months throughout 2018 are shown in Fig.Â A2). May 2018 was characterised by a dipole-like structure in the atmospheric circulation, with HGT500 anomalies ranging from â120 to 120âm. A high-pressure system (anticyclonic circulation) was centred over Fennoscandia, whereas Greenland and eastern Canada were under the influence of a low-pressure system (cyclonic circulation). This represents a northwestern movement of the high- and low-pressure systems present in April, when these were located over central or eastern Europe and the North Atlantic west of Ireland, respectively. South of the cyclonic circulation in May, a weaker anticyclonic circulation was observed over the east coast of the US. In June, the HGT500 anomalies were generally lower than in May, with anticyclonic conditions centred over the British Isles and at similar latitudes, with two cyclonic circulations: one centred over the Canadian east coast and one centred over Russia at approx. 70ââE. The HGT500 anomalies in July were similar to the ones in May in their spatial patterns and anomaly magnitudes but with a slight northward shift. In August, the high-pressure systems weakened in magnitude, with a high-pressure system located southeast of Fennoscandia, and a low-pressure system developed over the North Atlantic between Iceland and Norway. Similar anomalous patterns and magnitudes persisted in SeptemberâOctober, before Fennoscandia again was under the influence of a strong high-pressure system in November and (too a lesser degree) DecemberÂ 2018.\n\nThe 2018 anomalies of the mean MayâAugust HGT500 relative to 1959â2018 (represented as standard deviations, SDs, from the 60-year mean) for a sequence of subdomains in Europe are shown in Fig.Â 4a. Each subdomain covers 20â longitude Ã 20â latitude. Results for each month (MayâAugustÂ 2018) separately are shown in Fig.Â A3. Most of Europe showed HGT500 anomaly values of more than 2âSDs, and in regions centred around Denmark (between 2.5ââW and 12.5ââE and between 52.5 and 57.5ââN), HGT500 deviated by more than 3âSDs. FigureÂ 4b shows the aggregated MayâAugust HGT500 time series for a selected subdomain centred over Scandinavia (Scandinavian subdomain: 52.5â72.5ââN and 5â25ââE), demonstrating a record-breaking high-pressure system over the period MayâAugust for this subdomain. As shown in Fig.Â A3, particular high anomalies were observed in May and July, whereas more normal values were found in June and August. In MayÂ 2018, theÂ SD was twice as high as the second most extreme year (1993) and more than 3âSDs away from the mean.\n\nFigureÂ 5aâd shows the top-six ranking of each month (MayâAugustÂ 2018) highest temperatures (all months throughout 2018 are shown in Fig.Â A4 and monthly anomalies in Fig.Â S1). Temperatures during this period were exceptionally high, with record-breaking (rank 1) or near-record-breaking (rank 2â6) temperatures in several European regions. The most widespread extreme temperatures were found in May, when the top-six ranks (dominated by rank 1 and 2) covered almost the whole of the Nordic region and large parts of northern and eastern Europe. Record-breaking weather was reported by meteorological offices across the affected countries. In Norway and Germany, for example, the meteorological institutes reported that the country average May temperature was the highest on (the more than 100-year) record, and 97 meteorological stations in Norway (with record lengths between 15 and 155Â years) registered record-breaking May temperatures (Grinde etÂ al.,Â 2018a; Deutscher Wetterdienst,Â 2018). In June, the area covered by extreme temperatures decreased, mainly covering a smaller region from northern France to Poland, southern Scandinavia, and the British Isles. Ireland stood out this month, with record-breaking temperatures. Only southern parts of Fennoscandia had ranks of 1â6 in June; however, this changed drastically in July, when almost the whole of Fennoscandia experienced the highest (or second highest) temperatures on the record. In Norway, 43 meteorological stations broke their mean July temperature record (Grinde etÂ al.,Â 2018b). High ranks were also seen in regions facing the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. A southern shift was seen in August, when a southwestânortheastern belt of extreme temperatures extended from the Iberian Peninsula to southeastern Fennoscandia. Regions, mainly in Spain, Portugal, and Germany experienced record-breaking temperatures this month. Extreme temperatures were also observed in the months before and after MayâAugustÂ 2018 (mainly in April, September, and October), covering regions south of Fennoscandia. In November, temperatures in northern and western Fennoscandia were again extremely high.\n\nRecord-breaking (or near-record-breaking) low precipitation for each month (MayâAugust; Fig.Â 5eâh; rank of all months are shown in FigÂ A5 and monthly anomalies in Fig.Â S2) were much less common and only found in smaller and more scattered areas across northeastern Europe. Some localised extreme clusters were found in June, mainly in southern UK, Benelux, Germany, and Belarus. In July, larger clusters were seen covering Benelux, Denmark, parts of Fennoscandia, and Germany. A relatively large region north of the Black Sea, including Moldova and parts of Romania, Ukraine, and Russia, experienced record-breaking and near-record-breaking low precipitation in August. In addition, smaller clusters of extremely low August precipitation were found in central Europe. Apart from MayâAugust, scatters of record-breaking or near-record-breaking low precipitation in 2018 were mainly found in southwestern, central and southeastern Europe. Exceptions are February and November, when larger parts of northern Europe experienced extremely low precipitation.\n\n4.2âMeteorological drought\n\nSPI3 and SPEI3 for each month (MayâAugustÂ 2018) are shown in Fig.Â 6 (all months are shown in FigÂ A6 for SPI3 and FigÂ A7 for SPEI3). From a slow development at the start of the year, a meteorological drought manifested itself (as indicated by SPI3â<ââ1) across a larger region north of 45ââN in April and May. The situation worsened to peak in July when 18â% of the grid cells had SPI3â<ââ1.5. The most extreme meteorological drought in northern Europe (SPI3â<ââ2) was found in July in a region surrounding Denmark, including southern Norway, Sweden, Benelux, and Germany. Regions within the British Isles and the Baltic countries also recorded extreme meteorological drought this month. In August, extreme conditions persisted in Germany and neighbouring countries, whereas the meteorological drought in Fennoscandia, the Baltic countries, and the British Isles generally lessened (or ceased). Dry conditions persisted in central Europe, and extended to southern and eastern parts of Europe in SeptemberâNovember. Eastern and southeastern parts of Fennoscandia were again affected by moderate drought in NovemberâDecember after 3Â months of only scatters of moderate drought in this region.\n\nThe year started rather wet across Europe in terms of SPI3, with wet conditions persisting in southeastern Europe until May. SPI3 also revealed extreme wet conditions (SPI3â>â2) on the fringe of the drought-affected area, i.e. along the coastal regions in northern Norway (JuneâOctober) and southern parts of Europe, notably the Iberian Peninsula (MarchâMay) and southeastern Europe (FebruaryâApril and JulyâAugust). The SPEI3 showed a similar spatial pattern as SPI3, although somewhat higher anomalies were seen in May and June for SPEI3, with 11â% and 16â% of the grid cells in severe or extreme drought (i.e. valuesâ<ââ1.5) as compared to 7â% (May) and 13â% (June) for SPI3, respectively.\n\n4.3âHydrological drought\n\nThe 60-year (top-six) ranking of lowest monthly streamflow in 2018 in the Nordic region (Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark) revealed record-breaking or near-record-breaking low streamflow in several regions from June, peaking in July (Fig.Â 7aâd). Ranks of all months in 2018 are shown in Fig.Â A8, and standardised monthly hydrographs for 2018 are shown in Figs.Â S3âS5. In May, only two (3â%) of the stations experienced extremely low streamflow (rank of 1â6). In June, however, 46â% of the stations had extremely low streamflow and 13â% were record breaking. The proportion of stations with extremely low streamflow expanded to 68â% in July (28â% were record breaking). Extreme conditions persisted in the southeastern area of the region (mainly eastern Denmark, southeastern Sweden, and southern Finland) until the end of the year.\n\nThe 30-year (top-six) ranking results of lowest monthly groundwater levels in Sweden and Norway for each month (MayâAugustÂ 2018) are shown in Fig.Â 7eâh (all months are shown in FigÂ A9, and monthly standardised groundwater tables can be found in Figs. S6 and S7). Four (7â%) of the stations in Norway and Sweden had extremely low groundwater levels (rank of 1â6) in MayÂ 2018. In June, 43â% of the stations had a rank of 1â6 (7â% were record breaking), expanding to 55â% (14â% record breaking) in July and 63â% (14â% record breaking) in August. Ranks between 1 and 6 were seen in 38â%â54â% of the wells until the end of 2018. Extremely low groundwater levels did not show any distinct spatial patterns. In several cases, stations located close to each other (pies of the same point) showed different results, reflecting the importance of local conditions in determining the groundwater level.\n\nThe delay in groundwater response to precipitation (as defined in Sect.Â 3.3) varied among the study sites from 30 to 1500âd (Fig.Â 8a), whereas mean groundwater levels (measured from the surface) ranged from 0.36â13.4âm (median of 2.16âm; Fig.Â 8b). With one exception, the most extreme groundwater levels in Norway in June and JulyÂ 2018 (in terms of ranks) were found for locations with the fastest response time, i.e. 30â90âd. FigureÂ 8c shows the top-six groundwater ranks for each month throughout 2018 plotted with the response delay along the xÂ axis and the mean groundwater level depth (Fig.Â 8b) along the yÂ axis. Extreme groundwater levels emerged in June in the most shallow wells (less than 3âm depth from surface), followed by deeper wells in JulyâAugust, with response delays of up to 400âd. In September, the most shallow wells with the fastest response showed less extreme ranks, whereas deeper and more slowly responding wells started to experience extreme conditions. This pattern continued throughout 2018.\n\n4.4âRelation between summer streamflow and large-scale atmospheric circulation\n\nThe first three principle components of the EOF analysis explained 52â% of the detrended and standardised summer streamflow variability over the period 1959â2018, and their time series and loadings are shown in Fig.Â 9. EOF1 explained 23â% of the variability and was mostly relevant for the streamflow in the western and northern part of Norway (Fig.Â 9a). EOF1 was also relevant for some stations in Denmark, which were characterised by high flow when stations in Norway had low flow and vice versa. In summerÂ 2018, PC1 was close to 1Â standard deviation higher than the time series mean (Fig.Â 9d), reflecting dry conditions in western and northern Norway. Similar to EOF1, EOF2 explained 21â% of the summer streamflow variability (Fig.Â 9b). EOF2 was mostly relevant for the streamflow in Denmark, southeastern Norway, and southwestern Sweden. The PC2 time series indicated extreme low flow conditions in summerÂ 2018 in these regions (Fig.Â 9e). A smaller amount of variability (8â%) was explained by EOF3 (Fig.Â 9c). EOF3 reflected opposite summer streamflow conditions in the west (Norway and Denmark) relative to the east (easternmost Norway, Sweden, and Finland). The PC3 value for 2018 was close to the time series mean (Fig.Â 9f); thus, the conditions represented by EOF3 and PC3 were not relevant for the summerÂ 2018.\n\nSummers of low and high streamflow were related to the prevailing large-scale atmospheric circulation by extracting the summer HGT500 of low and high anomaly years from the first three PC time series from the summer streamflow EOF analysis. Years with absolute PC values larger than 1Â standard deviation from the times series mean were defined as high (positive values) and low (negative values) anomaly years. Summer (JuneâAugust) HGT500 composites for these years, along with wind directions and significance, are shown in Fig.Â 10.\n\nSummer low flow in western and northern Norway, as indicated by high PC1 values, was associated with a high-pressure system centred over the Norwegian Sea and covering most of Fennoscandia and a low-pressure system centred over the British Isles and over Russia at approx. 60ââE. In summers with low PC1 values, western and northern parts of Fennoscandia were located on the border between a low-pressure system in the north and a high-pressure system in the south. Years of high (low) PC2 values were associated with a low-pressure (high-pressure) system over the North Sea, flanked by a high-pressure (low-pressure) system on the central part of the North Atlantic and over Russia. These pressure systems covered the region with the largest EOF2 loadings, with summer high flow associated with cyclonic circulation and summer low flow associated with the an anticyclonic circulation over the region. A high-pressure system centred over southern Scandinavia and a low-pressure system over Russia at approx. 40ââE were observed for summers of high PC3 values, and a low-pressure system over the North Sea and southern Scandinavia was observed for summers with low PC3 values.\n\nThe 2018 extreme drought centred in northern Europe substantially affected the Nordic region, particularly in late spring and summer, before moving southwards in August. The Nordic region has widely different hydroclimatological and terrestrial characteristics as compared to other recently drought-affected regions, such as southern and central Europe in 2003 and 2015. This makes the drought of 2018 and its propagation in the hydrological cycle unique. Special for the region is a high diversity in hydroclimatological conditions, including the effect of snow on hydrology. Accordingly, the response to a meteorological drought and its propagation in the hydrological cycle will vary. Here, we discuss the 2018 drought, first from a climatological perspective (Sect.Â 5.1) and then by considering its hydrological footprint (Sect.Â 5.2). Further, the results of the EOF analysis, linking atmospheric circulation and low summer streamflow in the Nordic region, are discussed (Sect.Â 5.3), followed by some final remarks on the representativity of the hydrological data used in the study (Sect.Â 5.4).\n\n5.1âThe 2018 drought from a climatological perspective\n\nThe 2018 drought confirmed the central role of anticyclones in the development of northern (>â40ââN) Eurasian droughts as highlighted by Schubert etÂ al. (2014). The strongest HGT500 anomalies over the period MayâAugust were found in May and July. May was characterised by a cyclonic circulation centred over Greenland and western Russia and pronounced anticyclonic circulation centred over the continental Nordic region, extending south to central North Atlantic and the east coast of North America. This wave train pattern resembles the atmospheric circulation associated with the leading mode of drought variability over Europe as presented by Ionita etÂ al. (2015). Large parts of the region experiencing anticyclonic conditions in the months from May to AugustÂ 2018 also showed extreme temperatures (defined as having a rank between 1 and 6). The stronger the HGT500 anomaly, the more extreme the temperature, emphasising the strong link between the two variables.\n\nOverall, the observed positive SST anomalies in summerÂ 2018 overlapped spatially with the anticyclonic circulation (positive HGT500 anomalies) in May and JulyÂ 2018. Anomalous anticyclonic circulation, as observed in these two months, decrease convection and increase incoming solar radiation, leading to warmer SST in the underlying seas (Feudale and Shukla,Â 2011). The spatial pattern of SST anomalies in 2018 are similar to those in the summers of 2003 and 2015, representing two of the most extreme drought events in Europe in recent years (Ionita etÂ al.,Â 2017; Laaha etÂ al.,Â 2016; Fischer etÂ al.,Â 2007b; Black etÂ al.,Â 2004). During all three events, a persistent negative anomaly was centred south of Greenland over the period MayâAugust. The anticyclonic centres and associated temperature extremes over continental Europe in 2018 were generally located more towards the northeast as compared to the 2003 and 2015 events. An overlapping region in central Europe experienced temperature extremes all three summers. Overall, most major European streamflow droughts between 1960 and 1990 were associated with high-pressure systems across central Europe (Stahl,Â 2001), highlighting the unique location of the 2018 event. This is especially the case for May and July, when the high-pressure system centred over the Nordic region was more than 3Â SDs and 2Â SDs, respectively, away from the 60-year mean (Fig.Â A3). However, in AugustÂ 2018, the region of extreme temperature moved southeast, covering a region extending from the southwest to northeast Europe, resembling the affected region in summer of 2015 (and to a lesser degree 2003).\n\nMonthly precipitation extremes during the period MayâAugust were not as widespread as temperature extremes; however, areas with extreme low precipitation (rank between 1 and 6) generally also experienced extreme high temperatures. Overall, the region affected was located further north as compared to previous large-scale droughts in Europe, such as the summer droughts in 2003 and 2015 (Ionita etÂ al.,Â 2017). The SPI3 and SPEI3 both showed similar northern European located dry anomalies. These indices both reflect a 3-month accumulated deficit (in precipitation and a climatic water balance, respectively); thus, a higher consistency is seen in time. Furthermore, both indices showed widespread dry conditions already in April, reflecting conditions in the months FebruaryâApril. As seen in Fig.Â A4, extreme high temperatures were seen already in April in large parts of Europe, which potentially led to drier-than-normal conditions in the soils.\n\nFor both SPI3 and SPEI3, the spatial extent of severe and extreme drought peaked in July. Overall, the percentage of grid cells showing extreme drought was higher for SPEI3, highlighting the importance of not just looking at precipitation when analysing the impact of drought, as already recognised by Stagge etÂ al. (2017). The use of potential evapotranspiration in SPEI (rather than actual evapotranspiration) may be less an issue in the Nordic region where evapotranspiration in general is limited by energy, as opposed to water-limited areas dominating in central and southern Europe (McVicar etÂ al.,Â 2012). The inclusion of potential evapotranspiration in SPEI (as opposed to using only precipitation in SPI) may therefore prove acceptable for drought assessments in energy-limited regions. However, water may become a limiting factor in these regions in exceptional years, such as the summer of 2018 (Buitink etÂ al.,Â 2020). As the soil dries out, it may give rise to a positive landâatmosphere feedback, i.e. an enhanced warming is seen as less energy is spent on evapotranspiration. Such soil-moistureâtemperature feedbacks have played an important role in the evolution of previous European heat waves (Fischer etÂ al.,Â 2007a), and it may have played an important role in the 2018 event as well. Being outside the scope of this study, this would be an interesting aspect of a further study.\n\n5.2âThe 2018 drought from a hydrological perspective\n\nOverall, drought impacts are commonly related to deficits in different components of the hydrological cycle and not in the meteorological variables as such. Key impacts of the 2018 drought were related to soil moisture (crop failure and wild fires) and hydrological drought (e.g. impacts on energy, water supply and aquatic ecosystems). As a drought propagates, the event is normally lagged, attenuated, and lengthened as compared to the original meteorological event (VanÂ Loon and VanÂ Lanen,Â 2012; VanÂ Loon etÂ al.,Â 2011). The degree to which this happens varies with event and region impacted. Furthermore, antecedent water storage (initial conditions), such as snow, glaciers, and groundwater, plays an important role in the occurrence, timing, and development of a hydrological drought.\n\nIn regions affected by seasonal snow, drought occurrence and propagation is to a large degree influenced by the snow volume and snowmelt timing as compared to a normal year. During the snow accumulation season in 2018, above-normal precipitation fell in early winter in most of the Nordic region, and less-than-normal precipitation occurred in western and northern Norway and Finland towards the end of the snow season (as indicated by SPI3; Fig.Â A6aâc). Most of the snow-dominated catchments (with the exception of the northernmost part of the Nordic region) experienced meteorological drought in MayâJuly. Record high temperatures emerged during the snowmelt season (i.e. in May) and 19 stations (24â%), all with a Mountain or Inland regimes, experienced one of their six highest May streamflow since 1959. For other stations affected by snowmelt, however, a more normal flood situation followed (Figs.Â S4 and S5); one hypothesis is that part of the snow was lost due to sublimation. In addition, higher-than-normal evapotranspiration rates led to less water feeding the streams. The high snowmelt and evapotranspiration rates likely caused an earlier end of the snowmelt season as well as a smaller total volume of meltwater contribution to streamflow compared to normal (given the same preconditions). Following the snowmelt peak, streamflow drought started emerging in June in large parts of the Nordic region. Noteworthy exceptions were the three glacier-dominated streamflow stations (Fig.Â S5), for which high summer temperatures led to high melt rates and sustained water contribution from the glaciers.\n\nStreamflow stations without a snow season are mainly located in Denmark and southern Sweden. Extreme temperatures were found in part of this region already in April, extending to the whole region in May. In southern Sweden, meteorological and hydrological drought developed from May, and record-breaking low streamflow was seen from June. Most of Denmark, on the other hand, did not experience a meteorological drought until July. Accordingly, streamflow drought was first observed in July and (to a lesser degree) August. However, this was only seen for stations located in the southeastern parts of Denmark. Stations in western and northern Denmark did not experience extremely low streamflow at all during MayâAugustÂ 2018. As a whole, Denmark had extremely low precipitation and severe-to-extreme meteorological drought, as indicated by SPI3, in July. However, a southeasternânorthwestern gradient in extreme temperature (and SPEI3) reflects the spatial pattern of extremely low streamflow in Denmark this month, indicating that higher-than-usual evapotranspiration rates likely contributed to extreme conditions in the southeast. Correspondingly, less extreme evapotranspiration in the west and north might have prevented streamflow drought to develop there.\n\nWhereas extremely low streamflow conditions sustained in the southeastern area of the Nordic region (southeastern Denmark, southeastern Sweden, and southern Finland) throughout 2018, streamflow in the north and western part of the region was replenished by high precipitation totals in August (Fig.Â S2h). This divide reflects the southeastern movement of the anticyclonic circulation as well as the cyclonic circulation over the Norwegian Sea in August, with winds from the North Sea bringing precipitation towards the coast. High precipitation totals between August and October did not only replenish the rivers and end the streamflow drought but also led to extremely wet conditions at several streamflow stations (Figs.Â S3âS5). Western and northern stations experienced one of their six highest monthly streamflows since 1959 in August (5 stations), September (21 stations), and October (16 stations). In the southeastern area, extreme streamflow conditions persisted towards the end of 2018. Extreme conditions reappeared in November, even affecting stations that did not experience extremely low streamflow during the summer. This can be explained by continued below-normal precipitation in SeptemberâOctober (Fig.Â S2) and a new high-pressure system over northeastern Europe in November, leading to extremely low precipitation and severe to extreme meteorological drought in large parts of the southeastern Nordic region.\n\nThe groundwater wells were all located in areas affected by moderate-to-extreme meteorological drought, as indicated by SPEI3, in May, June, July, and (to a lesser degree) August. The high spatial variability in hydrogeological properties across the Nordic region is mirrored in the diversity in groundwater response to meteorological conditions, as reflected in a high local variability for groundwater drought (rank between 1 and 6) even for closely located wells. Except for four wells that experienced low groundwater levels already from March, no wells showed groundwater drought in May. Similar to streamflow, this was likely due to wet preconditions, such as high groundwater levels and/or snow volumes recharging groundwater during the melt season (Figs.Â S6 and S7). In June, extreme conditions were found among the most shallow groundwater wells, probably due to high evapotranspiration rates in combination with precipitation deficits. From July onwards, extreme conditions were found in wells of increasing depth and response time. The extreme conditions first started to cease in the shallowest and fast responding wells from September. At the end of the year, 38â% of the wells still experienced extreme conditions, and below-normal groundwater levels persisted well into 2019 (e.g. TableÂ 1n). Similar to streamflow, this was likely a combined effect of a delay in the hydrological system, a continued below-normal precipitation and meteorological drought associated with a high-pressure system establishing over northeastern Europe in November.\n\n5.3âAtmospheric circulation associated with low summer streamflow in the Nordic region\n\nThe EOF analysis revealed that more than half (52â%) of the variability in summer streamflow in the Nordic region (1959â2018) can be explained by the first three principle components, whereof the first two EOFs explained 44â% (Fig.Â 9). The analysis was somewhat biased towards Danish conditions, as the station density was much higher there compared to the rest of the region, in particular Sweden and Finland. EOF1 and EOF2 indicated two distinct patterns in summer streamflow variability: in western and northern Norway (EOF1) and in the southeastern part of the Nordic region (EOF2). During 1959â2018, low summer streamflow in the whole region only occurred twice, i.e. 1969 and 2006. These summers have also previously been identified as exceptionally dry by different drought indices (e.g.Â Spinoni etÂ al.,Â 2015; Hannaford etÂ al.,Â 2011) and here found to correspond to MayâAugust HGT500 anomalies of more than 1âSD above the 1959â2018 mean (Fig.Â 4).\n\nHigh values of summer PC1 indicated low summer streamflow in the northwestern part of the Nordic region, and were associated with a high-pressure system over the Norwegian Sea (Fig.Â 10). Several of the streamflow stations with strong EOF1 loadings recorded extremely low streamflow values in June and JulyÂ 2018. However, the summer of 2018 was not a high anomaly year in PC1, which might be due to the high precipitation in AugustÂ 2018 replenishing the rivers.\n\nLow values of PC2 indicated low summer streamflow in the southeastern part of the Nordic region, with the summer of 2018 as the most extreme year. This may result from the extreme streamflow conditions throughout JuneâAugust at several of the stations that had the strongest EOF loadings along the SwedenâNorway border and southern Sweden (Fig.7bâd). Following 2018, the most extreme low anomaly years, as indicated by PC2, were 1975â1976. This period has previously been identified as benchmark drought event in western and northern Europe (e.g.Â Zaidman and Rees,Â 2000; Stahl,Â 2001). Low values of PC2 were associated with a high-pressure system over the North Sea, surrounded by low-pressure systems over Greenland, Russia, and the Mediterranean region. The pattern has some resemblance with the Scandinavian teleconnection pattern (SCAN). Interestingly, MayÂ 2018 had the highest May SCAN value (of 1.69) and JulyÂ 2018 the third highest July SCAN value (of 2.27, the highest being 2.61 from 1997) over the period 1950â2019 (data from https://climexp.knmi.nl/data/icpc_sca.dat, retrieved 14Â AprilÂ 2020).\n\n5.4âHydrological data representativity\n\nThe streamflow dataset covers a rather wide range of catchment areas (6.6â10â864âkm2), and it includes stations across all of Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland. However, the density of stations varies, being much higher in Denmark and Norway as compared to Sweden and Finland. This lack of spatial representation affects the EOF analysis in particular but also the percentages of stations with extremely low streamflow.\n\nThe number of wells included in the groundwater dataset was strongly limited by the requirement of no or limited human influence (or lack of knowledge thereof), data quality, and the period defined. The selected groundwater wells are relatively shallow, with a median depth of 2.16âm below surface; however, the range across the region or average value is not known; thus, it is difficult to state whether this is a representative set of wells or not. Nevertheless, the large span in the âdelay in groundwater responseâ variable suggests that the natural variability is well captured. The groundwater dataset only covers Sweden and (southern) Norway and as much as 46 of the 56 stations are located in Sweden; thus, the results are biased towards Swedish conditions. In addition, several of the wells are located at the same site, often at different depths, affecting the spatial representativity of the dataset. Nevertheless, these wells confirm the high local variability seen in the groundwater level responses, reflecting the local heterogeneity in hydrogeological properties. Accordingly, this calls for caution when drawing conclusions at a regional scale based on local groundwater data.\n\nThis study characterised the 2018 northern European drought from both a climatological and hydrological perspective. This event was unique in its northern location, affecting a region with highly diverse hydroclimatological conditions compared to the more central and southern parts of Europe, recently hit by major droughts such as the events of 2003 and 2015.\n\nThe North Atlantic and seas surrounding Europe experienced persistent anomalously high SST from May to August and record-breaking temperatures over the Nordic region in May and July, which were associated with record-breaking high-pressure systems overlying the region. Extreme monthly precipitation deficits were not as widespread as extreme monthly temperatures; however, the persistent lack of precipitation from May to July led to extreme meteorological drought (estimated by SPI3) in a region surrounding Denmark, including southern Norway, Sweden, Benelux, and Germany. The meteorological drought in this region was found more extreme when considering the climatic water balance (estimated by SPEI3), emphasising the importance of accounting for temperature (and not solely precipitation as in SPI) in meteorological drought assessments. After July, the high-pressure system shifted southward and centred over Germany, and meteorological drought was only seen in small clusters across the Nordic region.\n\nWhereas record-breaking temperatures and moderate meteorological drought emerged over most of the Nordic region in May, hydrological drought (estimated as monthly ranks between 1 and 6 of streamflow and groundwater) did not appear before June. Snow plays an important role over large parts of the region, and at many locations the streamflow was still fed by meltwater during MayÂ 2018. The number of stations experiencing extremely low streamflow (rank between 1 and 6) expanded from 43â% in June to 68â% in July. Stations with more than 30â% of their catchment covered by glaciers did not experience streamflow drought during the summer due to the contribution of glacial meltwater. In August, high precipitation totals replenished rivers in western and northern parts of the Nordic region, whereas extremely low streamflow persisted throughout 2018 in southeastern parts. Groundwater drought (in Norway and Sweden) peaked in August with 63â% of the stations experiencing extremely low groundwater levels (rank between 1 and 6). The spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater drought were heterogeneous, and an interpretation of the patterns first made sense when looking at the groundwater depth and âdelay in groundwater response to precipitationâ combined. Extremely low groundwater levels emerged in the shallowest wells in June. With time, extreme conditions were found in wells of increasing depth and response delay, and by the end of 2018, 38â% of the wells had extreme low groundwater levels. The high local variability observed in the development of groundwater drought in 2018 highlights the care and awareness needed when analysing groundwater drought at the regional scale based on local well data with different site characteristics.\n\nThe leading modes of Nordic summer streamflow variability (1959â2018) revealed two distinct patterns in summer streamflow variability: one in the western and northern part and one in the southeastern part of the region. As identified by composite maps of summer geopotential height anomalies, high-pressure systems centred over the Norwegian Sea and the North Sea were associated with low summer streamflow in the western and northern part and southeastern part of the Nordic region, respectively. In both cases, significant high-pressure systems overlaid the region experiencing low summer streamflow, emphasising the important link between streamflow variability and large-scale atmospheric circulation.\n\nThe complexity of the 2018 drought event, as revealed by the large variability in drought characteristics seen across space and time in the Nordic region, serves as yet another example of the care needed when analysing drought in different components of the hydrological cycle. The diversity, caused by high local variability in terrestrial properties, reflects different responses to the meteorological forcing and thus different footprints of meteorological and hydrological drought. As the majority of drought impacts are felt on the ground and thus more directly related to hydrology than meteorology, it is important to incorporate variables other than weather alone when characterising drought.\n\nBarker, L.
