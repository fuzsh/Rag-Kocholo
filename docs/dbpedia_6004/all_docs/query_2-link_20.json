        "text": "Weather forecasters have predicted that an oncoming heatwave will bring highs of 37 degrees celsius to Germany over the next few days. Sunday is expected to be the hottest day of 2023 so far.\n\n37-degree heatwave forecast for Germany\n\nThunderstorms and temperatures in the mid-20s have made the summer weather in Germany pretty pleasant in recent weeks. Now, weather reports are forecasting highs of 37 degrees in parts of Germany in the coming days, as a heatwave crosses the federal republic.\n\nCaused by a low-pressure zone over Scandinavia, temperatures will begin to climb into the high-20s on Wednesday, July 5 and Thursday, July 6. Northern regions can expect high-speed winds and heavy rainfall, while a breeze and 27 degrees have been forecast for federal states in the south.\n\nHeat days scheduled from Friday\n\nAs Thursday ticks over, temperatures will begin to move towards the 30-degree mark, as hot air from the African continent moves northwards.\n\nFrom Friday, temperatures will begin to climb to over 30 degrees, with 34 degrees forecast for western parts of the country. The heat is expected to subside a little over Saturday, but still remain in the mid-to-high 20s, before climbing again on Sunday. July 9 is expected to be the hottest day of 2023 so far, with highs of 35 to 37 degrees forecast for a number of towns along the Rhine River.\n\nIn recent years, heat days or “Hitzetage”, days where the temperature reaches 30 degrees celsius or above, have occurred earlier in the summer and more regularly across Germany and Europe. This week, temperatures in parts of Spain are expected to reach a record-breaking 47 degrees.\n\nNow, with signs of anthropogenic climate change becoming more present in everyday life in Germany, Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach has announced that the government will develop a heatwave protection plan to make sure risks to public health are minimised as much as possible.\n\nChildren, people who are older or pregnant are particularly vulnerable during heatwaves, and according to the Robert Koch Institute, between 2018 and 2020 there were more than 19.000 heatwave-related deaths in Germany. If Lauterbach keeps to his schedule, the heatwave protection plan should be released during the summer of 2023."
