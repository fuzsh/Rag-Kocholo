        "meta_description": "Abstract. As the frequency and intensity of heatwaves will continue to increase in the future, accurate and high-resolution mapping and forecasting of human outdoor thermal comfort in urban environments are of great importance. This study presents a machine-learning-based outdoor thermal comfort model with a good trade-off between computational cost, complexity, and accuracy compared to common numerical urban climate models. The machine learning approach is basically an emulation of different numerical urban climate models. The final model consists of four submodels that predict air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and mean radiant temperature based on meteorological forcing and geospatial data on building forms, land cover, and vegetation. These variables are then combined into a thermal index (universal thermal climate index â UTCI). All four submodel predictions and the final model output are evaluated using street-level measurements from a dense urban sensor network in Freiburg, Germany. The final model has a mean absolute error of 2.3âK. Based on a city-wide simulation for Freiburg, we demonstrate that the model is fast and versatile enough to simulate multiple years at hourly time steps to predict street-level UTCI at 1âm spatial resolution for an entire city. Simulations indicate that neighbourhood-averaged thermal comfort conditions vary widely between neighbourhoods, even if they are attributed to the same local climate zones, for example, due to differences in age and degree of urban vegetation. Simulations also show contrasting differences in the location of hotspots during the day and at night.",

        "text": "The frequency and severity of heatwaves have increased and are expected to increase even further due to human-caused climate change (IPCC, 2021). In addition, heatwaves are occurring earlier in summer, resulting in a longer period of potential heat stress (IPCC, 2021). Rousi et al.Â (2022) found that the frequency and intensity of heatwaves increased 3â4 times faster in Europe than in the rest of the mid-latitudes over the past decades. In 2020, heatwaves in western Europe accounted for 42â% of all reported global deaths from extreme weather events, with a total of 6340 deaths (CRED and UNDRR, 2021). As the severity of heatwaves also depends on land cover and land use, urban areas are even more exposed to extreme heatwave events than rural areas due to their physical characteristics (Masson et al., 2020; Unger et al., 2020), including reduced nocturnal cooling and limited access to cool microenvironments for urban populations.\n\nHuman thermal comfort is influenced not only by air temperature (Ta) but also by wind speed (U), radiation, and humidity. The variables expressing the effect of radiation and humidity are the mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) and relative humidity (RH), respectively. Thermal indices combine these four environmental variables to describe the thermal comfort and overall thermal stress of an individual (Epstein and Moran, 2006). Multiple thermal indices have been developed, such as the physiological equivalent temperature (PET) or the universal thermal climate index (UTCI) (Coccolo et al., 2016; Potchter et al., 2018). Several studies have concluded that Tmrt is the driver of outdoor human thermal comfort during the daytime (Cohen et al., 2012; Holst and Mayer, 2011; KÃ¡ntor and Unger, 2011). In addition to terrain, the complex and heterogeneous three-dimensional structure of cities causes high spatial and temporal variability of these environmental variables. Tmrt and U have the highest variability at the micro-scale (Matzarakis et al., 2016). However, Ta also varies locally, although less strongly (Fenner et al., 2017; Quanz et al., 2018; Shreevastava et al., 2021). In particular, Ta is more relevant to human thermal comfort during the nighttime than Tmrt (Lee et al., 2013). As this study is concerned with a city-wide multi-scale approach to modelling outdoor human thermal comfort, the focus is on modelling Ta, RH, U, and Tmrt within the urban canopy layer (at about 1.1â2.0âmâa.g.l.) at the neighbourhood scale (Ta and RH: 500Ã500âm) and building-resolving scale (Tmrt and U: 1Ã1âm).\n\nIn recent years, several deterministic and stochastic modelling approaches have been developed to map urban climate, outdoor thermal comfort, and canopy urban heat island (UHI) at different scales and layers and with varying complexity (Mirzaei, 2015). Mesoscale models have been parameterized for urban surfaces, the so-called slab or bulk models (Dupont et al., 2006), and coupled with urban canopy models (Chen et al., 2011; Hamdi et al., 2012; Martilli et al., 2002; Masson, 2000; Rafael et al., 2020). Urban canopy models, on the other hand, have also been used as standalone (offline) models to investigate the urban surface energy and water balance at the local scale (Best and Grimmond, 2015; Grimmond et al., 2011). In addition to numerical urban climate models, statistical models (Chen et al., 2022; Ho et al., 2014; Straub et al., 2019) and dense measurement networks (Gubler et al., 2021) have been used to map urban climate. It can be concluded that there are several ways to model urban climate on various scales. However, as pointed out by Hamdi et al.Â (2020) and Masson et al.Â (2020), the complexity of the model should depend on the application and should only be as complex as necessary.\n\nRecently, machine learning (ML) and deep learning models have gained increasing attention in urban meteorology and have been used to emulate numerical urban climate models (Briegel et al., 2023; Meyer et al., 2022). The micro-scale Tmrt model SOLWEIG (solar and longwave environmental irradiance geometry; Lindberg and Grimmond, 2019) was emulated by a deep convolutional encoderâdecoder approach called U-Net, which showed a promising trade-off between accuracy and computational cost (Briegel et al., 2023). Meyer et al.Â (2022) emulated an ensemble of urban land surface models (ULSMs) using a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP was used to model energy and radiation fluxes and was compared to a reference ULSM (Town Energy Balance model). The MLP was found to be more accurate and more stable, especially in online mode. It can be concluded from these studies that the advantage of ML models lies in their lower computational cost once trained. Nevertheless, an emulated ML model can never exceed the accuracy of a numerical model as it is trained on its model results.\n\nThis study proposes a novel and fast computational ML approach to model outdoor human thermal comfort at 1Ã1âm resolution in complex urban areas, hereafter called the Human Thermal Comfort Neural Network (HTC-NN). The HTC-NN can be used to downscale numerical weather prediction models or reanalysis data considering urban geometry and function and can predict outdoor human thermal comfort at a high resolution at a limited computational cost. The HTC-NN consists of four submodels: two neighbourhood-scale MLP models for modelling Ta and RH, a building-resolved U-Net model for modelling Tmrt, and a building-resolved statistical wind field. We use the MLPs to emulate a surface energy balance model to model Ta and RH at the neighbourhood scale (500Ã500âm) at 2.0âmâa.g.l. and a U-Net to emulate a Tmrt model at the building-resolved scale (1Ã1âm) at 1.1âmâa.g.l. (Briegel et al., 2023). In addition, large eddy simulations (LESs) are emulated by a random forest (RF) model to compute statistical wind fields at 1.0âmâa.g.l. in the urban canopy layer with a 1Ã1âm resolution for the four cardinal wind directions in relation to the forcing data. The wind fields are calculated from the x, y, and z wind components. The single-layer model surface urban energy and water balance scheme (SUEWS) is used as surface energy model for the neighbourhood-scale modelling of Ta and RH (JÃ¤rvi et al., 2011; Sun and Grimmond, 2019; Ward et al., 2016). SOLWEIG is the building-resolved Tmrt model (Lindberg and Grimmond, 2019). The U-Net that emulates SOLWEIG has already been developed and validated (Briegel et al., 2023). LESs are used to obtain the scaling matrices and maps of mean wind speed in relation to forcing wind speed based on the LES of Albertson and Parlange (1999a, b).\n\nThe objectives of this study are (i)Â to develop and validate ML models emulating numerical urban climate models to predict Ta, RH, and U at different scales; (ii)Â to link these models to predict and validate spatially distributed UTCI at 1Ã1âm resolution; and (iii)Â to map UTCI at a high resolution in a case study of an entire urbanized area (Freiburg, Germany) over many years to derive a climatology of intra-urban variability of outdoor thermal climate.\n\nThis section presents the evaluation of the three submodels of the HTC-NN (Sect.Â 4.1), the HTC-NN itself (Sect.Â 4.2), and the high-resolution UTCI mapping of the HTC-NN (Sect.Â 4.3).\n\n4.1âEvaluation of Ta, RH, and U submodels\n\nThe accuracies of SUEWS, SOLWEIG, the MLPs, U-Net, and RF relative to the sensor network are shown in Fig.Â 3 and TableÂ 4. A spatial evaluation of machine learning models in relation to numerical models in their specific test areas is given in TableÂ B1.\n\nWith RMSEs of 1.50 and 1.51âK, respectively, the SUEWS and Ta MLP models demonstrate similar performances compared to the sensor network data. Both models' RMSEs are about 0.30âK lower than the forcing data. The errors of SUEWS and the MLPs across the different stations are similar (Fig.Â 3a), with a higher variability during the night than during the day. FigureÂ 4b shows a moving average of RMSE over time for the final HTC-NN model and for the Ta and RH MLPs (Fig.Â 4c and d). It can be seen that the RMSE of the Ta MLP shows two peaks in late October and mid-December, while the RMSE fluctuates around 1.00âK during the remaining time. Overall, the Ta MLP shows good accuracy compared to the SUEWS model (R2 of 0.997 and RMSE of 0.50âK). Similar observations can be made for the RH MLP. RMSEs for SUEWS and the MLP model are 7.79â% and 8.14â%, respectively, while the RMSE of the forcing data is 9.08â%. Similarly to the Ta models, the RMSE of the RH MLP has two strong peaks in late October and mid-December, with RMSE values up to 15â%, while RMSE fluctuates around 5â% to 6â% during the remaining time. R2 values of SUEWS and the RH MLP are lower at 0.88 and 0.87 compared to 0.97 for the Ta models. Nevertheless, the overall R2 between SUEWS and the RH MLP is high at 0.98, and with an overall RMSE of 3.28â%, the accuracy of the RH MLP is considered to be satisfactory. The Tmrt U-Net has a slightly lower accuracy than SOLWEIG (RMSE of 6.18 to 5.86âK; R2 of 0.84 to 0.86). A detailed evaluation can be found in Briegel et al.Â (2023). The RF has an R2 of 0.28 and an RMSE of 0.74âmâsâ1 in relation to sensor network data and shows a large improvement compared to forcing data (RMSE of 2.85âmâsâ1). However, the R2 of RF U is lower than the R2 of forcing data. The RF model has an overall accuracy of 0.76âmâsâ1 (RMSE) compared to the LES model (TableÂ B1).\n\n4.2âHTC-NN evaluation\n\nThe HTC-NN has an RMSE of about 3.00âK and an R2 of 0.92 (in relation to the sensor network), while SOLWEIG has an RMSE of 3.29âK and R2 of 0.90 (TableÂ 4). Moving averages of UTCI and RMSE (window size of 7âd) over time (AugustâDecemberÂ 2022) and diurnal error patterns are shown in Figs.Â 4 and 5. The annual RMSE of UTCI ranges between 2 and 4âK, with the highest RMSE values in mid-September, late October, and mid-December. Ta and RH show a similar pattern in October and December, while Tmrt has its largest errors in August and September, ranging from 6 to 8âK. The RMSE of U varies between 0.5 and 1âmâsâ1, with the highest values in August, late October, and late December. The elevated RMSE values of UTCI in mid-September coincide with the RMSE peak of Tmrt in mid-September, while the RMSE peaks for UTCI in late October and December match the high RMSE values for Ta and RH in those periods. In Fig.Â 4b and e, results from SOLWEIG are added (violet lines). SOLWEIG is more accurate than the HTC-NN in modelling UTCI and Tmrt in summer, while the HTC-NN is more accurate in autumn and winter. Diurnal patterns of UTCI accuracy are shown in Fig.Â 5a. Model errors are lower during the night than during the day, with the highest errors during the morning. The U-Net Tmrt error is also lowest during the night but has its highest errors in early evening (see also Briegel et al., 2023). The Ta and RH MLPs have similar error patterns and are lowest in the late afternoon. The diurnal pattern of the U RF model accuracy shows higher accuracy during the day than at night.\n\nFigure 6 shows sensor network and modelled UTCI values (HTC-NN and SOLWEIG) at five stations during an exemplary heatwave event in AugustÂ 2022. Daytime UTCI is overestimated by the HTC-NN to varying degrees (between 1 and 5âK), while nighttime predictions are in line with measurements. In Fig.Â 6c, the HTC-NN underestimated UTCI in the afternoon, which is in line with underestimated Tmrt. SOLWEIG, on the contrary, underestimates UTCI in the morning and overestimates it in the afternoon and evening. FigureÂ 6e shows significantly lower UTCI and Tmrt values for SOLWEIG during the afternoon, while the HTC-NN does not show this pattern.\n\nIn Fig.Â 7, distributions of both sensors and models and their differences are shown. The HTC-NN has a higher share of values between 15 and 25âÂ°C, whereas shares of UTCI greater than 25âÂ°C are equal. SOLWEIG, on the contrary, has lower shares for almost all the bins below 2.5âÂ°C and higher shares between 5 and 12.5âÂ°C.\n\n4.3âHigh-resolution UTCI mapping\n\nThis section presents an application of the developed HTC-NN for mapping and downscaling the simulated UTCI at 1âm resolution for Freiburg. Calculating hourly UTCI over 4 years (35â064 time steps) and 42.5Â million pixels using an Intel Core i9 processor and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 took only about 8âd. No individual runs are saved as this would exceed storage capacities, and predictions are stored as day- and nighttime sums of hours for each month within 1âÂ°C UTCI bins.\n\nFigure 8 shows the spatial distribution of cumulative daytime hours with strong, very strong, or extreme heat stress. This figure shows heat hotspots related to daytime heat stress as UTCI values â¥â32âÂ°C are rarely reached at night without solar radiation (Fig.Â 11b). FigureÂ 10 shows the same map extent but with nighttime hours exceeding a UTCI value of 22âÂ°C. FiguresÂ 9 and B3 provide a more detailed view of four exemplary urban areas representing the LCZs 2, 5, and 8. These areas show not only the thermal comfort difference between different LCZs but also the intra-LCZ variability (Fig.Â 9c and d).\n\nThe four areas represent the densely built-up city centre with parts containing large trees but also large open and paved areas (a), an industrial area with mostly paved surfaces and only a few trees (b), an old building district with a large and old tree stock (c), and a relatively new district built in the period 1995â2005 (d).\n\nIn Fig.Â 9, it is quickly apparent that there are large differences due to shading and tree canopy cover during the day and night. FiguresÂ 9e and B3e show the distributions of the spatially distributed numbers of hours in Fig.Â 9aâd. The distributions confirm the visual perspective. The industrial area (b) and the new building district (d) have a higher share of pixels, with more hours exceeding the threshold of 32âÂ°C during the day and fewer hours exceeding the threshold of 22âÂ°C during the night. In turn, the densely built-up city centre (a) and the old building district (c) have fewer hours â¥â32âÂ°C but more hours â¥â22âÂ°C. FigureÂ 11 shows the summertime UTCI distributions during the day- and nighttime for these four areas. The distributions underline the visual assumption that tree-covered and less-paved areas are less affected by thermal stress during the daytime but have higher UTCI values during the nighttime. In addition, Fig.Â 11 shows the 80th percentiles of the different areas, ranging from 29âÂ°C (old building district) to 32âÂ°C (industrial area) during the daytime and from 21 to 22âÂ°C during nighttime. The 80th percentiles highlight the importance of shading to daytime outdoor thermal comfort. During the nighttime, however, the industrial area and the new building district cool down more quickly, resulting in lower UTCI values and 80th percentiles (21âÂ°C vs. 22âÂ°C). Although there is a cooling effect at night, the shading effect during the day is stronger than the reduction in nighttime cooling. These results indicate that outdoor thermal comfort controls have an inverted effect during the day and the night.\n\nThere are differences not only between the different LCZs but also within the same LCZ class. The old building and the new building districts show strong differences in their day- and nighttime UTCI distributions. The difference between those two areas is larger than between the city centre and the old building district or between the industrial and new building districts. The areas do not differ much in their physical building characteristics and are both classified as LCZ 5. However, the old building district has a tree cover fraction of 45â% and can be further defined as LCZ subclass 5b, while the new building district has only 24â% tree cover and can therefore defined as LCZ 5d.\n\nIn Fig.Â 10, sharp UTCI transitions are partially visible. These transitions occur between adjacent grid cells (500âÃâ500âm) of the Ta and RH MLPs (original SUEWS grid cells). The transitions are more prominent in Fig.Â 10 than in Fig.Â 8 as Tmrt influences diurnal UTCI more than Ta. The transitions between grid cells also illustrate that Ta and RH are modelled individually for each grid cell without interaction with adjacent cells.\n\n5.1âEvaluation of the HTC-NN submodels\n\nBoth MLPs show promising results compared to measurements and especially compared to the numerical model SUEWS. With an overall (spatial) R2 of 0.997 and an RMSE of 0.5âK, the Ta MLP shows excellent accuracy. Both SUEWS and the Ta MLP have an RMSE of around 1.5âK in relation to sensor network data, while the MAE is only around 1âK. RMSE also varies with time (Fig.Â 4c). Apart from the two periods of late October and mid-December, with RMSE values higher than 2âK, the RMSE fluctuates around 1âK for most of the remaining time. This suggests that the overall RMSE of 1.5âK is highly influenced by the two outlier periods in late October and mid-December, with high RMSE values between 2 and 3âK. For the RH MLP, similar observations are made, having higher RMSEs in late October and mid-December. Since the MLPs and the SUEWS model have similar error patterns, the error must already be apparent in forcing data (see also Fig.Â B1). The end of October was unusually warm, with clear sunny days but cold nights. As forcing data are measured on a rooftop at 55âmâa.g.l., the near-surface night cooling is not represented in these data, leading to higher RMSE values. In December, on the other hand, an uncommon weather event occurred with a surface inversion between the surface and the rooftop at 55âmâa.g.l., with colder air near the surface and warmer air above. Compared to the ERA5-Land data, the forcing and model data show higher errors during these periods in October and December, indicating that errors are already present in the forcing data and are passed on to the model results. Both SUEWS and the MLP have a lower RMSE than the forcing data in relation to the sensor network data. However, the gain in accuracy is moderate for RH at 1â% and for Ta at 0.3âK. One reason could be that SUEWS is set up in default mode, and no specific model calibrations are performed. In addition, the modelled soil moisture has not been validated against measurement data. Another reason could be that SUEWS is run in offline mode. Running SUEWS in online mode, coupled to a mesoscale weather model, would probably increase its accuracy further as boundary conditions and tile interactions, including local wind systems, would be better mapped.\n\nThe RF approach to modelling a statistical wind field for the entire urbanized area of Freiburg shows good results for outdoor thermal comfort modelling. Since the RF models a statistical wind field only, not every wind gust can be accurately represented. Still, as the model is forced with hourly aggregated data, it is sufficient to predict hourly averaged U.\n\nThe results of the evaluation of the Ta and RH MLPs and the RF illustrate the power and potential of deep and machine learning models in the context of urban climate when appropriate training data are available. It can also be seen that the MLPs have similar model shortcomings to SUEWS, and an enhanced MLP performance requires an improved numerical model.\n\n5.2âEvaluation of HTC-NN\n\nThe trade-off between the computational cost and model accuracy of the HTC-NN compared to numerical models is positive for both. The HTC-NN has a higher model accuracy than SOLWEIG with its POI option. In addition, model accuracy is constant throughout the year, with lower accuracy during less common weather conditions. As mentioned, uncommon weather situations with strong surface inversions in the city are hard to predict for numerical and deep learning models. The overall RMSE of UTCI is around 3âK. The lower RMSE of the HTC-NN compared to SOLWEIG can be explained by the combination of four submodels that downscale Ta, RH, Tmrt, and U separately, while SOLWEIG downscales only Tmrt comprehensively. Diurnal error patterns of UTCI show higher errors during the day than during the night due to higher errors in the Tmrt predictions. However, the highest errors occur before noon, while in the late afternoon, when thermal stress is highest, UTCI predictions are more accurate (RMSE of about 3âK). During the heatwave event, the HTC-NN overestimates UTCI to different degrees during the day. It is also apparent that daytime UTCI follows the patterns of Tmrt most of the time, emphasizing the importance of correct shadow pattern data. Since Tmrt predictions of SOLWEIG and HTC-NN are partly in line while UTCI values differ, the prediction error must be related not only to Tmrt but also to Ta and RH, while U is negligible on these days. These results indicate that the accuracy of the HTC-NN is affected to varying degrees by its submodels under different weather conditions and that an overall attribution of error to the submodels cannot be made but must be done individually for the different weather conditions.\n\nTo the authors' knowledge, not many comparisons (of at least 1 week) have been made between UTCI models and measurements. Nice et al.Â (2018) used a modified version of the TUF-3D model (Krayenhoff and Voogt, 2007) to model UTCI in a suburb of Melbourne for 4 weeks. Observed UTCI values were calculated from Tmrt (black globe), Ta, RH, and U measurements. A total of seven stations were installed and compared to model results. The MAE between modelled and observed UTCI ranged from 1.80 to 3.03âK, and the RMSE ranged from 2.33 to 3.64âK, which aligns with HTC-NN. On the other hand, Meili et al.Â (2021) applied the ecohydrological model UT&C in Singapore with the model accuracy for UTCI ranging from 1.9 to 3.1âK (RMSE). Since Freiburg is hardly comparable to Melbourne or Singapore, these findings still help to better evaluate the HTC-NN model results. The HTC-NN has a similar accuracy but allows for modelling larger domains at a high resolution.\n\nWhile the HTC-NN has a very good trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, it has some limitations. First, the HTC-NN is not coupled to a mesoscale model and thus does not include local or mesoscale weather phenomena, such as mountainâvalley wind systems, cold-air drainage, and advection of heat (e.g. heat island and urban plume). Additionally, while large model domains are possible, the 500âÃâ500âm model tiles for Ta and RH are modelled individually, and no boundary or heat and moisture transport effects are considered, similarly to the offline SUEWS version. These constraints are related to the model structure of the offline SUEWS version and could be partially resolved by running it coupled to a mesoscale model. Another constraint is related to the forcing data. The HTC-NN is forced with meteorological data from a weather station at 55âmâa.g.l. Measured Ta at this height may already be exposed to other processes such as near-ground-level Ta, which may lead to initial error propagation. Additionally, the larger the model domain, the more difficult it is to force the model with data from one weather station. This could be solved by forcing the HTC-NN with reanalysis data or weather forecast products, which would reduce the model fit due to inconsistencies between measured and reanalysis and forecast data. As the submodels perform well in emulating the numerical models, better numerical models would also be needed to increase the accuracy of the model itself (Briegel et al., 2023). Nevertheless, the HTC-NN should only be applied to âknownâ spatial and temporal data as ANNs are generally capable of interpolation but not extrapolation. This means that similar urban structures and/or meteorological forcing data are suitable as potential prediction data. However, any unknown spatial configurations or unknown extreme weather events should be approached with caution and should undergo validation against measurement or numerical model data.\n\nThe evaluation of the HTC-NN based on sensor network data and the comparison with similar studies show that the HTC-NN is a valuable tool for modelling outdoor thermal comfort in complex urban areas.\n\n5.3âHigh-resolution UTCI mapping\n\nHTC-NN is used to predict UTCI for Freiburg for 4 years with high temporal (hourly) and spatial resolutions (1âm). Almost 1.5 trillion predictions were made, which took around 8âd. To determine day and night heat hotspots, the hours above the specific 80th percentiles (32 and 22âÂ°C) are summed up and mapped. In addition, four specific areas representing LCZs 2, 5, and 8 are presented in more detail. The four areas differ in terms of their physical characteristics and also strongly in terms of their UTCI distributions. The daytime UTCI distributions of the new building district (d) and the industrial area (b) are flatter and shifted to higher values compared to the distributions of the city centre (a) and the old building district (c). The 80th percentiles are shifted up to 3âÂ°C. The new building district and the industrial area also have more pixels with UTCI values â¥â32âÂ°C during the day. At night, however, it is the other way around, and the city centre and the old building district have more pixels with UTCI values â¥â22âÂ°C, which is also present in the nighttime UTCI distributions. This effect can be largely attributed to the proportion of covered areas, either by tree canopies or dense building structures. The denser the buildings and the larger the trees, the lower the sky view factor. Since Tmrt is the driving factor for outdoor thermal comfort during the day, a reduced sky view factor reduces the radiation load and, thus, the UTCI. At night, however, covered areas show reduced upward longwave radiation, leading to higher UTCI values. These results indicate that adaption measures may work inconsistently during the day and at night.\n\nBesides the intra-urban variability in terms of outdoor thermal comfort between different urban areas or LCZs, there is also an intra-LCZ variability in terms of outdoor thermal comfort. The old and new building districts have similar building characteristics but show very different UTCI distributions for day and night. Intra-LCZ variability has the same magnitude as inter-LCZ variability, as seen by their distributions and 80th percentiles. This is due to the remaining land cover characteristics besides building structures, such as tree or grass cover fraction. Outdoor thermal comfort has high variability at the micro-scale due to U and Tmrt, highlighting the importance of high-resolution modelling. These results further indicate that the urban climate characteristics of a small city with large green areas, such as Freiburg, are better described by the LCZ subclasses or directly by land cover class fractions.\n\nThis study presents a novel deep learning approach to outdoor thermal comfort modelling, the Human Thermal Comfort Neural Network (HTC-NN). The HTC-NN consists of four submodels that separately model Ta, RH, Tmrt, and U, followed by UTCI calculation. The submodels are trained on numerical model results, essentially emulating the numerical models through machine learning methods. Each submodel and the final HTC-NN are validated separately with data from a dense sensor network.\n\nThe research objective to develop and evaluate machine learning models emulating numerical urban climate models could be achieved (research objective i). In addition, the evaluation of the HTC-NN shows promising results (research objective ii). Furthermore, we could show that the HTC-NN has a positive trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. The accuracy of the HTC-NN is comparable to numerical urban climate models (RMSE of 3 to 3.3âK from SOLWEIG), while it is computationally superior. This computational superiority allows high-resolution modelling of outdoor thermal comfort for large domains and long periods. The HTC-NN is used to model UTCI for 4 years (2019â2022) for Freiburg with a temporal and spatial resolution of 1âh and 1âÃâ1 m to determine intra-urban variability of outdoor thermal comfort (research objective iii). The advantage of the HTC-NN is that it is able to model outdoor thermal comfort with high spatial and temporal resolutions, which allows the investigation of spatial and temporal patterns of outdoor thermal comfort. Therefore, high-resolution UTCI predictions can be aggregated either temporally or spatially (or both). The HTC-NN further allows us to study thermal comfort patterns only for specific weather events, UTCI classes, or selected areas.\n\nWe demonstrate that HTC-NN is fast and versatile enough to continuously model long periods and entire cities using a building-resolved approach. For urban climate services, but also for urban climate assessments and environmental-consulting applications, there is no longer a need to base assessments on numerical simulations of a few selected case studies; instead, we can build entire climatologies of thermal comfort, including the corresponding exceedance frequencies, explicitly based on end-user machines.\n\nNevertheless, the HTC-NN has limitations, and its applicability to other cities needs further investigation. It does not consider the city surroundings and its mountains, with elevation differences up to 1000âm, as it is not coupled to a mesoscale weather model. This means it does not consider local wind systems, shading by hills, or interactions between different local-scale grid cells (500âÃâ500âm). In addition, heat advection is not taken into account. Regarding the transferability to other cities, as long as the city has similar building and vegetation characteristics, it could be easily transferred since the training data cover a wide range of urban structures. However, mapping unknown urban forms, such as skyscrapers or denser building structures, is critical as they are not present in the training data. Nevertheless, it could be applied to unknown cities after validation of the trained submodels by numerical models or on measured data.\n\nAlthough only one potential application of the HTC-NN has been considered in the present paper, several applications are enabled by the low computational cost of the HTC-NN. These applications include simple urban-specific thermal comfort predictions and warnings for the upcoming days using weather forecast models. The HTC-NN, however, could also be applied to the downscaling of potential future climates to the building scale (e.g. using EURO-CORDEX data) or to the assessment of the effectiveness of adaptation measures by changing the input data on urban forms. Finally, HTC-NN can be used to investigate the driving forces of thermal comfort at different scales and hence, fundamentally, to develop guidelines in support of urban planning and policymaking.\n\nAkiba, T., Sano, S., Yanase, T., Ohta, T., and Koyama, M.: Optuna: A Next-Generation Hyperparameter Optimization Framework, in: Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining, 2623â2631, https://doi.org/10.1145/3292500.3330701, 2019.â\n\nAlbertson, J.
