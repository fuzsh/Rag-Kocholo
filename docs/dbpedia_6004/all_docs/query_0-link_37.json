        "text": "In July, summer in Germany is in full swing, luring visitors with warm sunlight and exciting activities. This is a wonderful time to plan a city vacation, but those who wish to avoid the crowds should look for smaller cities and lesser-known attractions, especially those near beaches and lakes, both of which are plentiful. We have curated a list of the best places to visit, Weather conditions and some of the important festivals to experience in Germany in July on your Germany packages.\n\nWeather in Germany in July\n\nJuly is the perfect summer season to spend as much time outdoors as possible with the locals, with bright sunshine and long hours of sunshine.

Frankfurt is generally the warmest city in Germany, with an average daily maximum temperature of 26 ° C and an average daily minimum temperature of 16 ° C. The cities of the Bavarian Alps feel a little cool, especially near Zugspitze, Germany’s highest peak, but the coastal areas of northern Germany benefit from the cool breeze.\n\nIn the early morning and late night, layer one or two breathable summer clothing and pack plenty of sunscreen for sightseeing and outdoor adventures. Short rain showers are common in July, followed by sunlight, so it’s okay to pack a light raincoat or umbrella.\n\nBest 5 places to visit in Germany in July\n\n1.
