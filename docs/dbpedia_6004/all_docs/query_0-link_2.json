        "text": "July 2022 was Earth’s sixth warmest July on record since global record-keeping began in 1880, 0.87 degrees Celsius (1.57°F) above the 20th-century average, NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, NCEI, reported on August 12. NASA rated the month as tied for the third warmest on record, 1.12 degrees Celsius (2.02°F) above the 1880-1920 period, its best estimate for when preindustrial temperatures last occurred. The European Copernicus Climate Change Service rated July 2022 as one of the three warmest Julys on record, marginally cooler than July 2019 and marginally warmer than July 2016. Minor differences in the agencies’ rankings can result from the different ways they treat data-sparse regions such as the Arctic.\n\nLand areas had their second-warmest July on record in 2022, with global ocean temperatures the seventh-warmest on record, according to NOAA. North America had its second-warmest July on record, Asia its third-warmest, South America its fourth-warmest, and Europe its sixth-warmest.\n\nThe contiguous U.S. had its third-warmest and 55th-driest July since 1895.\n\nThe year-to-date global surface temperature has been the sixth-highest on record, and the year 2022 is more than 99% likely to rank among the 10 warmest years on record, according to NOAA. However, it is only 10.5% likely to rank in the top five, and there is less than 0.1% chance that 2022 will rank as the warmest year on record, largely because La Niña conditions are now very likely to prevail for the rest of the year (more below).\n\n20 billion-dollar weather disasters so far in 2022\n\nEarth had 20 billion-dollar weather disasters during the January-June period of 2022, according to the quarterly catastrophe recap from Aon. Thankfully, total disaster costs (including earthquakes) during the first half of 2022 were 24% below 21st century average. But drought losses were high in a year when a pandemic and a war were causing food price spikes.\n\nThe only weather disasters costing more than $5 billion globally were the June seasonal floods in China ($8.7 billion) and February flooding in eastern Australia ($7.5 billion). Adjusted for inflation, statistics from EM-DAT rate the 2022 Australian floods as that nation’s third costliest weather disaster on record, behind the 1981 drought ($19.3 billion) and flooding in 2010 ($9.9 billion).\n\nThe deadliest weather disaster so far in 2022 is the monsoon flooding in Asia. During May and June, these floods killed 770 in India, 102 in Bangladesh, 49 in Nepal, and 37 in Pakistan.\n\nThere were nine individual billion-dollar weather and climate events across the U.S. during the first six months of 2022, according to both NOAA and Aon.\n\nAn unusually long La Niña persists\n\nLa Niña conditions intensified during July and are expected to continue through the Northern Hemisphere summer and into autumn and early winter (86% chance during July-September and an 80% chance in September-November, dropping to 60% for December-February), NOAA reported in its August monthly discussion of the state of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. The odds of an El Niño event are no more than 6% into early 2023.\n\nOver the past month, sea-surface temperatures in the benchmark Niño 3.4 region of the eastern tropical Pacific (5°N-5°S, 170°W-120°W) decreased from about 0.2 degree Celsius below average to about 0.6 degree Celsius below average, as analyzed at tropicaltidbits.com. The range for “weak” La Niña conditions is 0.5-1.0 degree Celsius below average; the range for “moderate” La Niña conditions is 1.0-1.5 degrees Celsius below average. Using a slightly different base climatology, NOAA reported on August 9 that the benchmark Niño 3.4 value had dipped into moderate La Niña territory, at 1.0 degrees Celsius below average.\n\nThe forecast from NOAA and Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society for the peak portion of the Atlantic hurricane season (August-September-October) is for a 80% chance of La Niña and a 20% chance of ENSO-neutral. If it were to happen, a third consecutive northern winter with La Niña in 2022-23 would be unusual but not unprecedented: Three-year La Niña sequences occurred in 1973-76 and 1998-2001. There have been no four-year La Niña sequences in NOAA data that extends back to 1950, although La Niña was present in five out of six northern winters from 1970 to 1976.\n\nAtlantic hurricane seasons during El Niño events tend to be quiet because of increased vertical wind shear over the Atlantic. Given the current forecast, a seventh consecutive active Atlantic hurricane season will likely occur in 2022, even though the season is off to its slowest start since 2009.\n\nThe impact of the current La Niña event may be boosted by a negative Pacific Decadal Oscillation, or PDO. The PDO is an index of sea-surface temperatures across the northeast and tropical Pacific Ocean that reflects some of the circulation aspects of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. The PDO can swing sharply from month to month, but usually it leans positive (warm) or negative (cool) for a few years at a time. Nearly every month since 2017 has had a negative PDO; July’s value was the lowest for any July since 1955 and the seventh lowest July value in NOAA data going back to 1854. When the PDO is negative, La Niña’s impacts often are more pronounced.\n\nArctic sea ice: 12th-lowest July extent on record\n\nArctic sea ice extent during July 2022 was the 12th-lowest in the 44-year satellite record, and the extent as of August 1 was the highest for that date since 2014, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, or NSIDC.\n\nAntarctic sea ice extent in July was the lowest for any July on record, beating out 2019.\n\nAntarctic sea ice extent tended to increase slightly from the 1980s through the 2010s, but it has decreased notably from 2017 onward, whereas Arctic sea ice extent has decreased more consistently and dramatically over the past 40 years.\n\nNotable global heat and cold marks for July 2022\n\nThe information below is courtesy of Maximiliano Herrera.
