Humidity

We base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.

The chance that a given day will be muggy in Freiburg is essentially constant during July, remaining around 3% throughout.

The highest chance of a muggy day during July is 4% on July 23.

For reference, on July 23, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 4% of the time, while on October 3, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.

Wind

This section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.

The average hourly wind speed in Freiburg is essentially constant during July, remaining within 0.2 miles per hour of 4.9 miles per hour throughout.

For reference, on January 28, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 6.9 miles per hour, while on August 9, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 4.6 miles per hour.

The hourly average wind direction in Freiburg throughout July is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 44% on July 4.

Growing Season

Definitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).

The growing season in Freiburg typically lasts for 6.6 months (203 days), from around April 10 to around October 30, rarely starting before March 18 or after May 3, and rarely ending before October 10 or after November 23.

The month of July in Freiburg is reliably fully within the growing season.

Growing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.

The average accumulated growing degree days in Freiburg are rapidly increasing during July, increasing by 495Â°F, from 832Â°F to 1,328Â°F, over the course of the month.

Solar Energy

This section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.

The average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Freiburg is essentially constant during July, remaining within 0.2 kWh of 6.4 kWh throughout.

Data Sources

This report illustrates the typical weather in Freiburg, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.

Temperature and Dew Point

There are 5 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Freiburg.

For each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Freiburg according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.

The estimated value at Freiburg is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Freiburg and a given station.

The stations contributing to this reconstruction are:

Colmar-Meyenheim (LFSC, 36%, 22 mi, west, -223 ft elevation change)

Black Forest Airport (EDTL, 26%, 26 mi, north, -407 ft elevation change)

EuroAirport BaselâMulhouseâFreiburg (LFSB, 21%, 32 mi, southwest, -33 ft elevation change)

Zurich Airport (LSZH, 11%, 49 mi, southeast, 499 ft elevation change)

Messstetten (ETGZ, 7%, 55 mi, east, 2,103 ft elevation change)

To get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Freiburg and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.

Other Data

All data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.

All other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.

Land Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

Elevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

We draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.

We further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.
