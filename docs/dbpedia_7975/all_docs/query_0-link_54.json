        "text": "Brad Ascalon\n\nBrad Ascalon’s eponymous award-winning studio was founded in 2006. The multidisciplinary designer specializes in furniture for the contract, hospitality and residential markets, as well as lighting, packaging, and other consumer products. With a reductive approach to his craft, Ascalon believes in design that is uncomplicated, rational and manages to find the perfect balance of form, function and concept. Through this approach, coupled with a strong understanding of strategy-driven design opportunities for his clients, Ascalon is widely regarded as one of the leading American design voices of his generation. Working with clients ranging from global brands to start-ups, branding agencies and private clientele, Ascalon’s long list of collaborators stretches the globe, from the US to Asia, Denmark, Sweden, France, Italy, Turkey and beyond. That list includes such companies as Carl Hansen & Son, Hightower, Ligne Roset, Bernhardt Design, Gunlocke, Stylex, Restoration Hardware, Design Within Reach, Skandiform, Gaia & Gino, Nude Glass, Mitab, L’Oreal, Redken, Maybelline, Umbra and many others. Ascalon’s work has been exhibited around the world, from the global design hubs of Milan, Paris, London, Cologne, Stockholm and New York, to Chicago, Los Angeles, Guangzhou and Moscow, where in 2013 he was singlehandedly invited to represent American design with an installation at Moscow Design Week. Ascalon’s work has been featured in top publications including Interior Design, Wallpaper*, New York Times, Architectural Digest, Intramuros, Whitewall, Esquire, Surface, Dwell, Objekt, Interni, Ottagono, Elle Décor, Metropolis and many others. In addition to his design practice, Ascalon teaches graduate level design courses at the renowned University of Pennsylvania, teaching both architecture students and IPD students (Integrated Product Design), a curriculum that bridges the University’s schools of Architecture, Engineering and Wharton School of Business. Born outside of Philadelphia, PA, Ascalon was immersed in the world of art and design from an early age. His grandfather was a noted sculptor and industrial designer, and his father is renowned for his large-scale art installations that can be found in public and private spaces throughout North America. Ascalon attributes his passion for design to the two generations before him who instilled in him the value of craftsmanship, materiality and rigor. Ascalon earned a Masters’ degree for Industrial Design from New York’s Pratt Institute in 2005, and that same year was recognized by Wallpaper magazine as one of the \"Ten Most Wanted” emerging designers in the world. Ascalon and his wife live and work in New York, NY as well as the North Fork of Long Island, NY.\n\nGuillaume Bardet\n\nGuillaume Bardet was born in Rouen in 1971, where he lived until the age of 15 years before moving to Paris. At the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs, Paris, from which he graduated in 1999, he met Jean-Marie Massaud, which whom he worked until June 2001. Independent from then on, he worked on his own designs in collaboration with a range of French (Dix heures dix, Vivendi Environnement, Triode, Louis Vuitton'), Belgian (Aquamass') and Italian (de Vecchi, Livit'') companies. Selected by the VIA in 2003 in the 'Appels à projets' section, he is currently working on his Paranox light with an Italian manufacturer. Selected by the VIA again the following year, he presented his Equilibre light at the salon du meuble de Paris in January 2004. A pensionnaire de l'Académie de France, he worked at the Villa Médicis for a year, developing a collection of nine pieces in marble entitled 'Mobilier immobile': these were shown at the galerie Yves Gastou in October 2003. In September 2004, he presented a collection of bath tubs designed for Aquamass at the salon de Now. At the same time, he was furthering his activities as an interior architect, working for both private clients (an apartment in Paris, a barn in Normandy) and companies such as Renault, for whom he designed two stands at the International Motor Show in September 2004. Since February 2005 he has been course leader at the Ateliers of the Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Création Industrielle. He lives and works in Paris.\n\nAnne-C. Baudequin, Mathieu Maldes\n\nAnne-Charlotte Baudequin born in Grasse in 1995 and Mathieu Maldes born in Toulouse in 1992, met during their degrees in applied art/design at the University of Toulouse II—Jean Jaurès. After different masters, their collaboration becomes a permanent dialogue, nourished by their singularities, and their common passions. Following her bachelor in Toulouse, Anne-Charlotte Baudequin, specialises in sensory design with the validation of a master's degree in Creation Research and Innovation in Sensory and Food Design at ISCID (Higher Institute of Applied Arts, Colour Image Design). She is currently doing a doctorate in design (Allph@ doctoral school) with the following thesis project “Olfactory Sensory Design for an Anthropology of space”. She teaches olfactory design in collaboration with a perfumer at ISCID. Mathieu Maldes, after his degree in Toulouse and a master's degree in Transdisciplinary Design Cultures and Territories at the University of Toulouse II - Jean Jaurès, trained in photography at the ETPA school, where he explored the possible relationships between photography and design. It was after working for studios such as Studio Daguerre and Studio Jaspar in Paris that he decided to return to Toulouse with the desire to explore the know-how of the south of France. Their work, guided by a quest for simplicity, questions contemporary uses to develop possible or imaginary worlds. They are particularly interested in materials, sounds, smells, or gestures that offer new interactions and new experiences. This common vision allows them to consider creation as a work of research in motion on the sensory and poetic dimensions of everyday objects. By moving away from the principle of the pure shape as a purpose, their desires are to bring out intentions, links and common values. In 2019, their first project \"Hestia\" won the special mention of the Jury for the competition \"Grand Sud: Enhance the granite of Sidobre\". In 2021, they are the winners of the call for expressions of interest \"New Worlds\" launched by the Ministry of Culture where they propose the exploration of their sensory methodology in situ for the development of their project \"Small inventions of the landscape \".\n\nFrançois Bauchet\n\nDesigner of furniture, objects and tableware ; scenographer and interior architect. He was elected 'créateur de l'année 2002' at the Salon du Meuble de Paris. In 2000, the Musée des Arts décoratifs organised a personal exhibition centring on his work. Since 1999, he has collaborated with the agency and gallery Kreo, for whom he regularly designs new collections. From 1984 to 1998, he worked with galerie Neotu, where he regularly presented new collections. In 1985, he worked on a project for the petit café de la fondation Cartier in Jouy-en-Josas, for whom he also fitted out offices in 1987. That same year, he was invited to participate in the Documenta de Kassel. Various fitting-out projects followed : windows and reception furniture for the Centre d'Art de Vassivière in the Limousin, a reception area for the Musée d'Art et d'Industrie de Saint-Etienne, studies into 'inter-quartier' relations, 'Du jeu de mail à la basse ville' for the city of Dunkerque, exhibition and café furniture for the galerie du jeu de Paume, and furniture, walkways and follies for the parc du château d'Azay-le-Rideau' His furniture and objects are currently being produced by the following companies : Kreo, Cinna, Ligne Roset, Ercuis and Haviland.\n\nR. & E. Bouroullec\n\nRonan and Erwan Bouroullec were born in Quimper, in 1971 and 1976 respectively. On leaving the Ecole Nationale des Arts Décoratifs, Ronan began working independently, assisted more and more by Erwan, who was then studying at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts de Cergy. They have been working together officially since 1999. Their collaboration is a permanent dialogue, feeding on their individual qualities and driven by mutual requirements. Giulio Cappellini discovered them in 1997, when their 'dis-integrated kitchen' was presented at the Salon du Meuble de Paris. From this meeting was born an uninterrupted collaboration, which was cemented by numerous projects from 1999 onwards. In 2000, Issey Miyake called on them to design a space to house his new clothing collection A-Poc in Paris. That same year, a meeting with Rolf Fehlbaum, President de Vitra, led to the production, in 2002, of a new desk system called 'Joyn', which marked the début of their collaboration. Today, Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec work regularly with a number of manufacturers such as Vitra, Cappellini, Issey Miyake, Magis, Ligne Roset, Habitat and Kréo. Simultaneously, they also work on architectural projects such as 'la Maison flottante', an artist's studio destined for the Centre d'Art, Chatou. Elected 'créateurs de l'année' at the Salon du Meuble in 2002, they have been awarded, to name but a few, the New Designer Award of the New York International Contemporary Furniture Fair in 1999, the Grand Prix du Design de la Ville de Paris in 1998 and the first prize in the Biennale du Design de Saint-Etienne in 1998. They were also named Designers of the Year by Elle Décoration Japan in 2003. Their pieces have been shown in numerous collective and personal exhibitions such as 'Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec' at the Design Museum, London in 2002. In June 2004, a personal exhibitions was dedicated to them at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. Ronan et Erwan Bouroullec have been the subject of two monographic publications: 'Ronan et Erwan Bouroullec - Catalogue de raison', Editions Images Modernes/ Kréo, 2002 and 'Ronan et Erwan Bouroullec', Edition Phaidon, 2003. They lecture from time to time in a number of art or design schools. Ronan Bouroullec lectures at the Ecole Cantonale d'Art de Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\nBusetti Garuti Redaelli\n\nManuela Busetti and Andrea Garuti met while studying Industrial Design at the Istituto Europeo di Design in Milan, where they were already teaming up to work on design issues. In 2004, the year of the XX Compasso d'Oro ADI, they were accorded the 'Progetto Giovane' selection for their degree thesis project 'Double', an innovative cooler bag made of neoprene. Since 2004, they have collaborated with various Milan-based studios specializing in product and advance design; they also work together on a freelance basis, designing for both international competitions and manufacturers in a range of sectors including tableware, bathroom fittings, sanitary ware and furniture. In 2007, their project 'Culla Belly' won them 1st prize in 'Playing Design', the international competition run by the city of Lissone in partnership with the Milan Triennale. In 2008 they were both selected for the experimental project 'Prime Cup 01' promoted by the Regione Lombardia and the Milan Triennale with a view to improving the level of innovation amongst selected SMEs in the Lombardy region. These projects are exhibited to the public in the Agora Theatre at the Milan Triennale. Matteo Redaelli graduated in Industrial Design from the Istituto Europeo di Design in Milan in 2007. In the same year, the three young designers' working lives converged during a collaboration with a design studio in Milan. In 2008, they began working together on new projects, making full use of their different skills and sensibilities. New collaborations followed with manufacturing companies in various sectors: kitchen and bathroom taps, tableware, kitchenware, ovens and hobs, indoor and outdoor furniture, etc. In 2010 they won the Cristalplant design contest, promoted by Zanotta and Cristalplant, with an innovative coffee table project, christened 'Naica'. In 2012, they won it again with their versatile 'Verve' table project for Poliform. In 2014, the jury of Young & Design 2014 selected their 'Log' upholstered chair, designed for Pedrali. ------------------- Our design approach: We are three industrial designers who have worked together since 2008, developing new products for various areas of home and also the contracts market. The projects we develop arise from a synthesis of our personal visions and sensibilities. Our intent is to develop objects that satisfy both the new demands arising from changing lifestyles and the consolidated needs of everyday life. In developing all our projects we aim to achieve simple solutions, both technical and formal, favouring the usability and legibility of the object. In this process, we reinterpret both traditional and innovative materials, allowing the resulting objects, when placed in their own context, to become discreet and gentle life companions. Usually our projects are the result of the reflection stimulated by a brief submitted to us by a company; they might equally be defined autonomously when we identify an opportunity; or even an unexpected intuition that emerges unpredictably. Having defined a concept, we develop it in many divergent directions then make a selection, which we then process and redefine in more detail. We always like to work with different types of products by collaborating with companies in different industry sectors, such as furniture, tableware and kitchenware, taps and ceramics, etc. We can define our approach to design as being rooted in Italy, but with a European flavour. In addition to the masters of Italian design, we owe a lot to the design of Continental Europe and Scandinavia.\n\nPierre Charpin\n\nBorn in 1962. A trained plastic artist, Pierre Charpin has dedicated most of his time to the design of furniture and objects since the beginning of the 1990's. Since then his work as been just as likely to veer towards experimental projects on which he works with, amongst others, C I R V A (1998/2001) and C R A F T (2003/2005); he also designs products for prominent international manufacturers such as Alessi, Venini, Post Design, Montina, Zanotta, Ligne Roset, la Manufacture Nationale de Sèvres... His continuous research work is made possible by his collaboration with the Galerie Kréo, Paris, with which he has been working under a worldwide exclusivity agreement since 2005, producing limited edition items. In 2004 he won an award for his 'Eau de Paris' carafe in moulded glass, of which 60,000 were produced. He was elected 'créateur de l'année 2005' by the salon du meuble de Paris. Several of his pieces form part of the collections of the Fond National d'Art Contemporain, the Centre Georges Pompidou and the Musée des Arts Décoratifs de Paris.\n\nCP — RV\n\nCP — RV is a collaborative design project run between London and Marseille. Formed by designers gathered together from different backgrounds, the practice designs products, home furnitures, interior spaces and things to live with. The studio, co-founded by designers Camille Paillard and Romain Voulet, works from an intuitive understanding of contemporary life, resulting in a patient production that remains relevant in the context of our daily lives and aims to create enjoyment out of simple utility of its designs. Camille Paillard (1988), practiced as designer at JLK DS studio and Tom Dixon, where she worked on bespoke furniture as well as on hotels, restaurants and private interiors; for clients such as Tom Dixon, Philippe Malouin, a:tifact, Hennessy and Pierre Marcolini. Prior to this, her experience as designer included positions at Front Design, Philippe Starck and Blackbody Oled. She studied design for luxury and craftsmanship at ECAL in Switzerland, where she graduated in 2012. Romain Voulet (1989), former designer at Industrial Facility, under Sam Hecht and Kim Colin, where he created home furniture, office systems and things to live with; for industry pioneers such as Herman Miller, Muji or Mattiazzi. He previously practiced at Youmeus Design where he designed everyday objects for clients such as Panasonic, Joseph Joseph, Nokia and Kenwood. He studied industrial design at EID in the South of France, where he graduated in 2011.\n\nD. Debiasi & F. Sandri\n\nDaniel Debiasi (1981) and Federico Sandri (1977) founded their own design studio in 2010 and work within various fields of design, ranging from objects to spaces. Multiple experiments and the relationship between manufacture and craftsmanship form the basis for a much broader thinking, where objects are always considered as part of a bigger picture. Daniel and Federico have created work for renowned clients such as Antoniolupi, Lema, Ligne Roset, Normann Copenhagen, Offecct, Rosenthal and Stelton among others. Many of their projects have received international design awards and are featured in publications worldwide. In addition to their work as designers, they regularly teach, hold workshops and lectures at various institutions including IUAV Venezia and Politecnico di Milano. a little sentence explaining your view of design, philosophy, inspiration... “In what we design we usually aim to give a positive experience to those who interact with our products. It can be the simple relationship with an object, recalling a memory, make other people feel a pleasant sensation or perhaps even getting a smile out of them.”\n\nMathieu Delacroix\n\nBorn in 1991, Mathieu Delacroix is a french Designer graduated from Higher Education School in Art and Design of Saint-Etienne. In 2013, his Aeon project won the ORANGE Young Designer Competition that then led him to be exhibited as a part of the Dubai Design Week \" Global Grade Show \" in 2017. In 2015, his Kuro project is showcased in the \" Mirage \" exhibition organised by the F93 Cultural Center in the town of Saint-Etienne, France. The same year, he went studying in Japan, in Nagoya City Design University. The designer remains strongly linked to what he has learnt in Japan, relating his knowledge to his work. He participated in the \" Fukushima Mon Amour \" exhibition, commissioned by his school ESADSE and the local city council for the 2016 Milano Triennale. More recently, he won the First Prize of Cinna Young Talent for his wood vases collection called \" Tasso \". Today, Mathieu Delacroix is living and working in Paris. He is assisting a few design practices including Mathilde Bretillot , Frédéric Forest & Clémentine Giaconia or Guillaume Delvigne. Working on personal projects aside, the designer is driven by his passion of bringing meaning into archaic designs. His main purpose is to shape products that are emotionally linked to our lives, creating synergy between hand drawings and personal feelings.\n\nDésormeaux et Carrette\n\nStudio Désormeaux/Carrette is a design studio which was founded by Nathanaël Désormeaux and Damien Carrette in January 2014. Specialising in industrial design, its vocation is to create objects suitable for series production. Today, the studio works with a range of clients from start-ups to prominent brands in the retail furniture and objects markets. Passion for materials and an instinctive understanding of what an object is meant to convey are fundamental to our creative approach. Deconstruction is at the centre of our design methodology. By taking apart and rethinking an object holistically, we reveal its technical heart. Thus our work consists of beautifying technicality with a view to not only integrating but also transcending it so that it becomes an object’s aesthetic heart.

This duo dreams up almost masculine decorative schemes with sharp, clean lines. They love to mix genres and eras so that spaces do not become ‘fixed’. The heritage of each place inspires them to fashion a unique atmosphere without limiting themselves: infinite detail, a monumental object, measure and excess. Their former lives in the media taught them to think of spaces as stages on which stories can be related. Designers, craftsmen, graphic designers and architects come together and work with the same expectation: never sacrifice their ideas for the sake of trends. Desjeux Delaye never loses sight of its ambition to imbue all its forms with a spirit of chic informality. Their agency specializes in the hotel industry and has been working on a range of projects since 2018: a hotel in Formentera and two hotels in Paris, two high-end apartments also in Paris and multiple product projects such as an eponymous collection of lighting, sold in Bon Marché and produced by MR Agency, and a range of furniture for Versant.\n\nDögg & Arnved Design Studio\n\n© Dögg & Arnved Design Studio is based in Copenhagen, Denmark. An agency capable of operating in fields as varied as the design of installations, products or furniture, interior design and graphics. The creative approach of Dögg & Arnved Design is based on Scandinavian design traditions, adding modern technologies and their passion for materials and textures. Through their cultural understanding of design, personal interpretations and expressiveness, they seek to create contemporary and timeless design for all. They work to create functional, high quality products with respect for both nature and future generations, in the belief that this will bring added value to the product. Rikke Rützou Arnved A graduate (2001) of the School of Architecture of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. After her graduation she established her own design office, Ark Type, where she primarily designed furniture and indoor design. At same time she was lecturing at the DTU (The Danish Technical University, Institute of Design and Innovation). She has worked for Danish architectural studios in the fields of industrial design, lighting and interior design, it being a professional skill of hers to work in such different capacities. Since 2006 she has worked on a wide range of projects from city planning, urban design and building design competitions to furniture. It inspires her when architecture and design create an interdependence. Working with design at any level, the essence is, for her, to work in such a way as the overall project and its individual details are seen as a unified whole. Dögg Gudmundsdottir Studied industrial design at the Istituto Europeo di design, Milan, graduating in 1996. Between 1996 and 1998 she was a guest student in the glass, furniture and graphics departments of the Danish Design School. In spring 2011 Dögg attained her Masters in Design from the School of Architecture of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, her main focus being, 'New Strategies: Design management with applied sustainable Innovation'. In 2000 Dögg Gudmundsdottir established her own studio, Dögg Design, working in fields ranging from industrial design and graphics to art and installations. Dögg Gudmundsdottir's brand of design retains close links with the art world, drawing inspiration from natural materials, organic shapes and traditional craftsmanship. She believes that design and art exist in an important mutual contagious association with each other. Her work has been exhibited and published throughout the world.\n\nMarie C Dorner\n\nParis, Tokyo, London : soujourns abroad which kick-started the career of Marie-Christine Dorner. Designer, interior architect and graduate of the école Camondo, Paris, she spent a year in Tokyo designing her first collection of furniture for Idée, before opening her first office in Paris. The sheer diversity of her projets is astonishing : amongst the best-known, the La Villa at St Germain des Prés, the restaurant de la Comédie Française, the presidential grandstand (tribune présidentielle du 14 juillet) at the top of the Champs Elysées, street furniture for the city of Nîmes, designs for le Mobilier National. A Londoner for more than 10 years, she designs and fits out ambassadorial residences for the French Ministère des Affaires Etrangères, undertakes special projects for private clients, and designs for manufacturers as diverse as Ligne Roset, Montis, Bernardaud and Baccarat. Her collection 'Une Forme, One Shape', exhibited in 2004 in Paris, Tokyo and Kyoto, is just one demonstration of her taste for perfection. The best artisans in France and Japan made up her jewellery, objects and furniture in wood, gold, porcelain, bamboo, ceramic and composite materials. Marie-Christine Dorner has lectured in both London and France, and was awarded the Grand Prix du Design de la ville de Paris in 1995.\n\nDozsa & van Dalfsen\n\nIn 1997 Julia Dozsa and Jan van Dalfsen started Dozsa & van Dalfsen a studio for design and architecture, based in Amsterdam. Julia Dozsa (1960) studied architecture for 2 years before attending the Gerrit Rietveld Academy graduating in industrial design. After graduating at the University of Amsterdam in mathematics, specialization topology, Jan van Dalfsen (1959) started studying architecture and building technique at the Polytechnic of Amsterdam while working for a building contractor. They work together but also separately for corporate and private clients on projects in furniture-, product-, interior-design and architecture. Among their clients are Calligaris, Colé Italia, Deknudt Mirrors, Driade, Estinée, Fiam Italia, Glas Italia, Ikea, TAFT Shoes, Tonelli Design. Prize: Elle Decoration Award 2003 for Best Accessory Design for Nembus vases designed for Driade. Exhibitions: in December 2003 at Yamagiwa Corporation in Japan of all the work for Driade, Design Museum Brussels. Architectural projects in the Netherlands include: apartment block and interior of a shoe shop in the center of Amsterdam, interior of a shoe shop in Almere, façade for a house and shop in Zaandam, renovation of several apartment buildings and shops in Amsterdam, new apartment block in Utrecht, villas in Schoorl and Heiloo, garden house in a garden of a canal house in the center of Amsterdam, ‘Victorie Poort’: old extensions transformed into five tiny houses in the tradition of a 'hofje' in the center of Haarlem, renovation and design of a façade and interior of IINN-sustainable beauty in Amsterdam, interior of Estinée hair salon/gallery in Haarlem. The variety of our backgrounds and the synergy it can generate, determines our designs. Also the co-operation with others, especially skilled craftsmen, is an important source of inspiration. Influenced by images from art, nature, architecture and design, often absorbed subconsciously, respecting the context of a project and giving intuition free rein while trying to surprise ourselves, we create our designs.\n\nNoé Duchaufour-Lawrance\n\nA designer of both environments and objects, Noé Duchaufour-Lawrance was born in Mende, France in 1974. Raised in a creative environment, he defines his own language with the help of forms which are at once natural, flexible, organic, fluid and structured. Trained in metal sculpture (ENSAAMA), he then moved into the sphere of 'Mobilier des Arts Décoratifs'. Noé is interested in unusual projects: such as the Sketch restaurant in London, which launched his career in 2002 and earned him his first prize, Time Out’s Best Design award. He then delivered a number of major interior architecture projects, amongst which the “La Transhumance” chalet, the Air France Business Lounge and the “Ciel de Paris” restaurant. Current projects include the new interior architecture concept for the Montblanc boutiques, which will be for worldwide application, and is designing the lounge area of the #cloud.paris building as part of its refurbishment. Noé Duchaufour-Lawrance works on projects which vary in size from the very smallest to those on the grandest scale. He has designed his first line of furniture for Ceccotti, and is continuing his collaborations with the Italian manufacturers Zanotta and Tacchini. He also began working with the American manufacturer Bernhard Design, for whom he is working on a varied collection of seating and occasional tables. Luxury houses court him. Hermès has added his Sellier settee to their collection. For Saint Louis there is the prestigious Folia collection of furniture, lighting and tableware. His name is linked to the success of the One Million perfume, for which he designed the bottle. His singular approach naturally leads him to design exceptional pieces which are presented and exhibited in prominent galleries and at high-end events. Working with the Made in Situ gallery, which opened in 2020 in Lisbon, where he is based, he is building on this appetite for materials and the handmade. This is how he describes his work in his own words: \"An object is naturally obliged to respond to a need, without creating others. From this absolute necessity, it must be a vehicle for meaning and emotions. This is the angle from which I approach the design of an object, using a language rather than a style, which I develop as a result of my experience. A language in a permanent state of evolution, expressed by forms and materials and inspired by my surroundings, whether natural, real or idealised, and my emotions, whether experienced or dreamt. For I sincerely believe that there are emotional threads woven between men, spaces and objects. The objects and spaces I create in symbiosis lean towards the same direction, aided sometimes by a dash of provocativeness, but always avoiding falling into the traps of gratuity and seduction.\"\n\nAlain Gilles\n\nDesign as a second life. After studying Political Sciences and Marketing Management, Alain Gilles went on to work in the financial world. But one has to live his own life. So, thanks to the moral support of his wife, he went back to studying Industrial design in France. He opened is own studio in 2007 in order to pursue his own dreams and develop his personal approach to product design, furniture design, art direction and interior architecture. He has since started to collaborate with several international editors such as Qui est Paul ? (FR), Galerie Gosserez (FR), O'Sun (BE-HK), Buzzispace (BE), Design is Wolf (BE), Vincent Sheppard (BE), Varaschin (IT), Verreum (CZ), Casamania (IT), La Chance (FR) and Bonaldo (IT).

During his studies he began to focus on designing objects and furniture, honing his keen feel for materials, colors and textures. For a short while he then worked for Stella McCartney in London. In the year 2006 Sebastian Herkner founded his own studio. Since that time, he has designed furniture, lamps and smaller items for manufacturers such as Ames, and Tradition, Cappellini, ClassiCon, Dedon, Ligne Roset, Linteloo, Moroso, Pulpo, Rosenthal, Thonet, Wittmann and Zanotta. Herkner also works on interior architecture projects and museum and exhibition design. His works have won numerous accolades – among others the IF Award, the Iconic Award and the Elle Deco International Design Award (EDIDA). As Guest of Honour at imm cologne 2016, Sebastian Herkner provided the design for “Das Haus”. In 2019, Maison&Objet elected him “Designer of the Year”. An unconditional love for traditional craftsmanship paired with a good feel for new technologies, a true flair for colour, authentic materials and textures, an unadulterated curiosity for different cultures, for embracing and integrating them, and a commitment to taking responsibility for the things and people one works with, not to mention consideration and respect for all of the details and steps necessary to create an extraordinary object...: Since the success of the Bell Table for ClassiCon in 2012, Sebastian Herkner has never looked back, whilst remaining true to his word – and himself. Balance and intuition are important and enduring factors in his work, which he sees as a continuous dialogue that straddles the disciplines: It takes him to the far corners of the world in search of almost forgotten crafts techniques, of factories that have a tradition going back centuries, to the crafts Sleeping Beauties of the craft world that he can awaken from their slumbers. In the process he creates not just chairs, sofas, lamps, tables, vases and carpets, but an entire cosmos that shines a new light on how objects can appeal to the senses, and where beauty is cultivated from within the process itself and from his empathy towards people.\n\nMoisés Hernández Design\n\nMoisés is a Mexican born designer based in Mexico City (born 1983). His hometown, being chaotic and over populated, as well as Mexican objects, traditions, textures, social contrast and chromatic diversity are elements influencing Moises’ work. Moisés obtained his Bachelor in Industrial Design from ITESM in 2007, graduating with honors. Moisés have always been attracted by simplicity and fresh ideas and that is why he decided to study at Ecal, in Lausanne Switzerland where in summer of 2013 he became a Master of Product design obtaining special mention. Moisés has exhibited his work in USA, Italy, France, Netherlands, Switzerland, Turkey, Hong Kong, Spain and Mexico. His work has been awarded by the Mexican Design Biennial INBA, The Good Design Award by the Chicago Atheneaum among others recognitions. In 2013 Moisés creates Diario, a brand that redesigns everyday Mexican objects, Diario is a social, cultural, curatorial and design project. Moisés believes in the transfer of design knowledge and this is why from 2014 - 2017 he joined as professor at Centro, one of the most important Design Universities in Mexico City, where he was awarded as the best Industrial Design professor. In August 2017 he was named as Regional Design Director at ITESM, the most important private University across Mexico.\n\nMichael Koenig\n\nMichael was born in Aachen in 1971, to a Dutch mother and a German father. He grew up in the part of Germany which borders the Netherlands and Belgium. Michael's grandfathers were skilled craftsmen, so he became acquainted with all kinds of materials at an early age and loved making and creating all kinds of things. After school Michael trained to become a cabinet maker. He studied design in Aachen, where he gained an honours degree. One year later, at the age of 27, he started work as a lecturer at the University of Aachen, teaching product development. During this time Michael started work on his own projects with small German design labels such as Details and Freiraum. After his first booklet mailing in 1999, Michael came to the attention of Habitat and Ligne Roset. These were the first major international companies he worked for, and they have remained loyal clients. For several years now, Michael has had his own studio in Hamburg, where he moved to after starting a family. Michael, his Turkish wife and their two daughters, live in the northern part of Hamburg. The studio is responsible for a wide range of design projects in the fields of furniture, accessories, lighting and interior design, making use of many different materials and all kinds of technologies. What is Michael's secret? The answer is simple - take an everyday article and give it a twist in respect of its use, function and material and, in many cases, add a touch of humour. Since 2008, Michael has been responsible for art direction for the firm of Flora in Halver, Germany. Clients include, Artepuro, Details, the Danish Consulate in Germany, Flora, Freiheit, Freiraum, Cinna, Clic, Habitat, Jasmim, Kaether & Weise, Ligne Roset, Louise Poulsen, Magazin, Morfoso and Rapsel.\n\nNeeru Kumar\n\nNeeru Kumar, an Indian textile designed based in New Delhi, is a graduate of the National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad. An exceptional, inspired talent who, in the course of the past two decades, has been at the forefront of a revolution in the field of Indian textiles. With her use of traditional techniques and indigenous materials, and by dint of research and reflection, she has created an entirely new vocabulary for textile design. This innovation was made possible by the combination of her unique sensitivity, most notably in terms of tones and textures, her profound understanding of weaving and other textile techniques, and her determination to support craftsmanship. Highly productive, she has created a captivating, original and highly contemporary palette whilst pushing at the frontiers of the traditional skills on which she bases her work, which is often described as 'contemporary classic'. Her works have been exhibited in Japan, Europe, the United States and Australia, in prestigious stores and boutiques and in the shops of the foremost international museums. She counts the Victoria & Albert Museum, London and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art amongst her most loyal clients.\n\nPierre Lapeyronnie\n\nBorn in 1982, Pierre Lapeyronnie grew up between Paris and South-Western France, where his grandfather - a blacksmith and self-taught engineer - had a factory producing tools and equipment for vineyards. He graduated from the Beaux-Arts de Bordeaux in 2006, having investigated the possible interactions between soundscapes and their individual uses. On his return to Paris he began working as a freelance project manager, working on numerous projects for various agencies including those of Nathalie Crinière (stand design) and Jean Nouvel (product design). During this period he collaborated with craftsmen all over France, visiting them in their workshops to learn such basic skills as glass blowing, ironwork, ceramics, cutlery-making and cabinetmaking. In March 2010 Pierre Lapeyronnie founded PLII, his industrial design agency. This agency works on various projects, both commissioned and self-initiated, focussing mainly on the design of high-quality products, rationally designed, imbuing each with several levels on which it can be 'read'. His aesthetic approach is simple, precise and uncompromising. Pierre Lapeyronnie lectures in product design at the School of Design of the Strate Collège de Sèvres. His course alerts students to industrial realities whilst guiding them through the entire economic life-cycle of a product, from the initial sketch through to the production stage.\n\nMauro Lipparini\n\nMauro Lipparini's intensive activities in the field of industrial design encompass furniture for both home and office, textiles and other products created for numerous companies in Europe and Japan. In terms of architecture and interior design, he focuses mainly on residential and commercial buildings such as corporate headquarters, showrooms, shops, restaurants and exhibition spaces. In addition, he designs and produces advanced image and corporate identity systems ranging from graphics to editorial services and production. The style of Lipparini, based on pared-down forms and clear, vigorous lines, the characteristics of natural minimalism, is heavily influenced by gaiety of spirit, and an intoxicating sense of aesthetic pleasure and creativity. Through the free use of colours, organic frameworks and original visual ideas, Lipparini broadens the palette of minimalism by converging instantaneousness and the power of this aesthetic quality in new era of maturity and a sense of wellbeing. For Mauro Lipparini, design is the inevitable tension between aesthetics and function, art and application. He enables a product to become both agreeable and intriguing, a functional or superfluous object to be transformed into one charged with aesthetic sense and semantics, thus enriching the domestic landscape. He enables a space or its ergonomy to come alive with an ever-new relevance. Design engenders desires which will improve the quality of life, it enables us to view progress with increased involvement, it renders the understanding of function and therefore the perception of one's habitat both passionate and agreeable. Design is not the application of form like make-up, it is the object in itself, it is the tradition, the culture which enables people to have more or less indirect contact with the intellectually avant-garde by democratising art. It can be more or less poetic, constructive and considered, but it must always push the very limits of risk by forgetting habits and customs. These considerations form the base of my work and, through simple, vigorous lines, graphic abstractions, compositions and purely geometric decompositions, I am ever on the trail of beauty and pleasure with a view to allying form and function. A natural minimalism of pared-down forms, paying particular attention to materials, colours, surfaces, to thick and thin, light and shade.\n\nPhilippe Moine\n\nPhilippe Moine is full of sincerity and humanity, deeply anchored in an approach where man is at once the source and the end purpose of his creativity. A sensitive lover of pictorial art and sculpture, he is nourished by the inexpressible which is illustrated through pared-down lines, emotions emanating from a sketched-out movement. Philippe Moine was born in the Seventies in St Etienne, a town recognised by Unesco since 22nd November 2010 as one of a network of 'villes créatives Design'. Was this an omen? A childhood lover of Lego, Meccano and carpentry sets, he very quickly showed a marked leaning towards a career in which the process of construction and woodworking would satisfy his appetite for creation. His first cabinetmaking courses confirmed his particular attraction to this career path, where wood enabled him to give shape to his ideas with great ease. Ideas, his head was full of them ! To help them gush out, he signed up with the école Boulle, Paris where he learned to master the movements and skills which would enable him to craft wood, metal and fabric with both quality and genius. With a degree in Interior Architecture under his belt, he then went on to specialize in Industrial Design at the École nationale supérieure des Arts Décoratifs de Paris: a course with the educational mission of providing artistic, scientific and technical training in all spheres of the decorative arts. At the same time, Philippe Moine joined the design team at Renault: plunging into such a hotbed of creativity was a catalyst for him. The designers, from the best schools in the world, were young like him; the multicultural nature of the team and the means laid at their disposal enabled them to produce designs of limitless creativity. This experience, coupled with his talent, was to open the doors of various design agencies, where he became known for his striking creations. Philippe Moine opened his own studio in 1996 and now divides his time between industrial design, which he has been developing more broadly for a number of years, and 'le Mobilier de Création'. > Industrial design is a field in which he knows how to make the best use of his achievements whilst adhering to a set of specifications which have been scrupulously defined by issues relating to business, the market, the production process, the user...his expertise in this field is acknowledged, his creations arresting. il maîtrise des réalisations en adéquation avec un cahier des charges scrupuleux défini par une problématique d'entreprise, de marché, de fabrication, d'utilisateur... > Le Mobilier de Création is his secret garden where he designs exceptional pieces. Unique items of furniture worked in a single material or in a range of material types, a harmonious marriage of wood, metal or glass. > Graphic and spatial design are areas in which he plunders the very DNA of the business, offering sensory voyages using forms, images, materials and colours whilst remaining true to simplicity and clarity. As the town of Saint-Etienne was making design one of its axes for economic recovery, Philippe Moine came together with two other local designers to found the collective DESIGNERS+ in 2007. Today, this collective is a veritable platform for design and development, aiding the region's economic players by making design an innovative lever for the whole area. Today, Philippe sits on both the management committee and the Design & Industries commission.\n\nAna Moussinet\n\nBorn in Belgrade in 1973, she graduated from the Ecole d’architecture Paris la Villette in the year 2000. Ana Moussinet has worked in her studio, ANA MOUSSINET INTERIOR DESIGN, since 2012. Liberated and inspired, Ana Moussinet owes her expertise to her architectural degree from the Beaux-Arts de Paris and to the professional path she has taken. Design as an art form, technique as a foundation, to her, volume is a material to be sculpted, to be adorned before being inhabited. Her Slavic origins inspire her on a daily basis and give her approach a sensitive, lively twist. An architect, she sculpts spaces of all sizes. From an 180-bedroom 5* hotel on the other side of the world to the identity of a boutique located a few steps from her studio in the Le Marais district, to the design of a jewel-like light, Ana devotes the same level of enthusiasm and the same expertise to each project. A stylistic vocabulary which interweaves French elegance with contemporary design and Slavic joie de vivre, from which Ana draws the necessary inspiration to sketch out the features of each interior, making it a unique piece, at the service of both sponsors and users.\n\nOsko + Deichmann\n\nDuring the 1990's, we were both attracted by the energy of the formerly divided Berlin, absorbing creative young people from all over the world. In 1996, amidst an atmosphere of constant change and seemingly endless possibilities, we started to study at the University of Fine Arts, Berlin. Though coming from different backgrounds, we soon started to collaborate - and this collaboration soon turned out to be an amazing kind of teamwork, achieving results well beyond our individual capacities. In 1998 we founded the design studio 'wunschforscher' (roughly translated as 'desiresearchers'), creating objects between design, innovation and art. The most famous works from this period are the 'SushiRoller' and the 'top.table'. At the same time we produced scenography and visual concepts for fashion shows, events and parties, amongst others for MTV Designerama On Stage and Adidas Originals. In 2005 we founded 'osko+deichmann', with the aim of making straightforward objects which nevertheless have an additional layer, or else tell a story. In 2006 we designed the PONTON low table for Ligne Roset. One year later the ABYSS light by Kundalini and the CLIP CHAIR by MOOI were presented at the Salone di Mobile, Milan. In autumn 2007 the PEBBLE collection of seating was launched by elmarflötotto. The designs of 'osko+deichmann' have been shown at the musée du Louvre (Paris), the Vitra Design Museum Weil am Rhein (Berlin), Cube Gallery (Manchester), MoMA (Berlin), Deutsche Guggenheim (Berlin), Galerie VIA (Paris) and 107 Rivoli (Paris).\n\nHélène Poiraud\n\nHélène Poiraud is a designer of textiles, materials and colours. Born in 1992, of French-Austrian origin, she grew up surrounded by a family of passionate art collectors. After studying textiles at the ENSAAMA Olivier-de-Serres in Paris, Hélène graduated from the École nationale supérieure des Arts Décoratifs de Paris in 2018. Throughout her course, she explored various fields in which textiles are employed, such as fashion, the automotive industry and furnishing. It is through their design, their weave or even the working of their colours that she finds enrichment, enabling her to freely express herself. After working with a weaver in northern France, where she designed collections of furnishing fabric, she chose to move into the field of interior decoration. In effect, Hélène is committed to using craftsmanship and expertise to bring meaning and emotion to her creations. Today, she works in an interior architecture studio in Paris, where she develops textiles and materials to create unique living spaces. Through her creative approach, Hélène wants more than anything to tell us a story. Drawing inspiration from craftsmanship, the urban landscape and nature, she creates unique designs and motifs.\n\nPrisca Renoux\n\nBorn in Paris in 1988, Prisca Renoux began to envisage making design her career at a very early age. After a 'baccalauréat littéraire', she went on to study object design at the ENSAD, from which she graduated in 2012. She then completed her studies at the Ravensbourne School, London, collaborating with contemporary designers such as Inga Sempé and Mathilde Bretillot. She then began her career, starting out on a freelance basis, making contributions to numerous projects, most notably for the Serge Atallah agency, where she develops everyday objects. In 2013, Maurizio Galante and Tal Lancman invited her to participate in the exhibition, 'Lost in Paris' at the Lieu du Design. Along with other designers, she presented a project for ceramic cloches beneath which were held the scent of little-known places in the Parisian suburbs. Her first taste of recognition came with the Fly / Intramuros competition, in which she was awarded the 'prix du Jury' for her 'Pluie' duvet cover in 2014. In 2015, she won the Cinna 'Révélateur de talents' competition with her Tipi light, which is currently being produced and marketed by the brand. These days, Prisca Renoux divides her time between designing for the Cent Degrés agency and her own furniture and object-related studies.\n\nJuliette Rougier\n\nBorn in Paris in 2000, Juliette Rougier trained in ‘global design’ (product design, interior architecture, graphic design) at the Ecole Bleue following a bac STDAA. Currently a Masters student at the École Supérieure d’Art & de Design Marseille-Méditerranée, her projects sit on the borderline between industrial design, art and craftsmanship. Taking the material as her initial source of inspiration, she explores forms and usages which combine functionality with poetry, with an eye to optimizing resources. Her contours spring from a search for balance between spontaneity and function. In 2021 she was a finalist in the Concours du Mobilier National with her range of classroom furniture; and she received the Prix Coup de coeur du jury at the 14th concours Cinna Révélateur de Talents. She will also be a finalist in the Concours Massilia Design with a set of table accessories. In 2022 came Naïf, her first collaboration with Ligne Roset, and her collection of furniture made from canne de Provence, made from offcuts from a local business, was also shown at the Musée d’Histoire de Marseille.\n\nStudio Fluye.\n\nPaola born 1983 and Berta born 1984.

They apply investigative and creative methodologies in the projects' development, paying attention to the emotional aspects in people. They have developed industrial design projects focused on new, innovative products, packaging and graphic design applied to corporate identity for businesses in multiple sectors. During their trajectory, they have been awarded the Premio Injuve de Diseño in 2010 for their furnishing project titled Desapercibido (Unnoticed) which was shown at international fairs such as the Salone Satellite in Milan as well as travelling exhibits in Turkey and Egypt.

He trained at the Conservatoire de Metz, studied furniture design under Jean-Claude Maugirard at the Arts Déco de Paris, and philosophy at the Sorbonne. Between 1996 and 1998 he worked with Didier Gomez. Since the early part of the new century he has employed an open, eclectic approach to projects ranging from theatre arts to design. He designs set pieces and scenery for theatres, opera and exhibitions, works on interior architecture projects and designs furniture. He also produces music and sound design projects. In his projects he focuses on economy of means and an open evocation which leaves space for the imagination whilst resonating with references. On his theatre and opera scenery he constructs spaces where light and sound play an essential role in the service of the senses and the imagination. His set pieces have played host to great French actors such as Pierre Arditi, Romane Bohringer and Dominique Pinon; they have toured in numerous countries, as far as China where he created the opera \"Flowers in the Mirror\" in 2010, which blends traditional acting and acrobatic techniques with new techologies. He plays with technology to make it make a humorous or poetic turn, as with the electronic music he has created for the stage or for his solo project 'Vicnet'. Since 2001, following his first experiences of Japan, he has explored the incorporation of technologies, in particular audio, into furniture. This research resulted, in 2013, to his Wide collection of furniture with added sound, a project supported by the VIA and produced in conjunction with the French company la Boîte Concept, which developed its innovative acoustics. The Psi bridge simultaneously plays with futuristic evocations and vintage notes. Its unusual central base recalls the shape of the Greek letter Psi, which symbolizes the soul, the psyche. The idea for the Psi bridge originally came from a theatre set developed for Michel Didym's 'Divans', a play about psychoanalysis: the audience were in the position of analysts, with the actors stretched out on couches !\n\nJames Van Vossel\n\nJames Van Vossel (1977) is a versatile designer with a constant need for innovation and an irrepressible stubbornness to achieve his goal. His drive is not to just put another object on the market, but to reform archetypes, searching and questioning them with a constant flow of new insights. Graduated with distinction as a furniture designer at VOMO/Thomas More University in Mechelen (BE), he established the all-embracing brand JAMES˙˙˙˙ in 2006. From toy design to the world of fashion, from product design for Modular Lighting Instruments (BE) and Theo Eyewear (BE) to furniture design for Drisag (BE), the wide range of products reflects his quest to obtain clear, balanced and functional objects. The unique, limited and industrially produced creations all arise from sketches, translated into real life models in his own modest designer’s studio. More often than not, he finds solutions through manual material interventions. To broaden his horizon and mind, James often participates on contests and collaborates with other designers. In the past this led to creative cooperations such as Fox & Freeze. He also joins forces with enterprises from various backgrounds such as the young social cooperative enterprise 37 Graden (BE) to the renowned furniture company Thonet (DE). James breathes passion and provokes an inspiring mindset. He seeks, investigates and then throws himself with the same enthusiasm and vigour into a project for each of his clients. Because this is what he prefers: to act hands-on. Those who have already attended one of his lectures understand that James translates his words into deeds: “I can’t sit on a drawing!” … AWARDS Interior Innovation Award Cologne (DE) Award INTERIEUR biennale ’08 (BE) Young professional for Europe Award ’09 (IT) Silver V.Award ’13 (CN) iF DESIGN AWARD ’20 (DE)\n\nLaura Väre\n\nBorn in 1989.

She finds inspiration in daily things around us. A light, form or a color, an interesting material or a view, something that awakens feelings in her. Occasionally, Laura can start to design a product completely for its own intended purpose, at which point she might find that something necessary is missing. Creating often feeds creativity and inspiration can occur during the project. As a designer Laura aspires to create beautiful, practical and functional as well as timeless products, answering present day challenges in her own unique style. In her work, finishing details are always combined with a strong and minimalist style. Her work has been presented at international design exhibitions in Europe and Japan.

After training in the Applied Arts at the université Jean Jaurès in Toulouse, he began studying for an IUP Couleur, Image et Design (Masters in Colour, Image and Design) at Montauban, which offered a course on colour which was unique in France at that time. During this time there were several placements, most notably with Reine Mère Edition and Samuel Accoceberry. In the final year of his Masters he designed the Majordôme hybrid furniture in collaboration with Pauline Pinto and Cédric Guillemin. This project was awarded the Prix du Public in the 7ème concours Révélateur de Talents Cinna and then went into production. When designing, Benjamin attaches great importance to detail, to the graphic aspect of an object and the rhythm it gives off. Such designs draw inspiration from the stories of everyday life, with rigorous work on colour and materials whilst offering up contemporary, elegant lines. Today, he works in Paris as an independent designer.\n\nYabu Pushelberg\n\n« We design places and products : immersive environments, compelling destinations. George Yabu and Glenn Pushelberg founded their studio in 1980, with an accent on interior decoration. With offices in New York and Toronto and a team of more than one hundred creatives and professionals, we design buildings, interiors, landscapes, lighting systems, furniture, objects and graphics with a focus which goes well beyond what things look like, to how they make people feel. We are always looking to the future and incessantly seek new innovations, trying to create the memorable experiences of tomorrow. With an accessible, collaborative way of designing and resolving problems, we believe it is important to dream and to overcome obstacles in order to arrive at new solutions. We bring the same attention to detail to each project, from tabletop objects to the new materials, and we actively look for partners who share our passion for doing better than what was done before. For us, it’s all about designing the world we want to live in.\n\nNathan Yong\n\nNathan Yong graduated in industrial design from Temasek Polytechnic in 1991. He did not begin his career as a designer, instead working in the purchasing and product development departments of various companies in Singapore. Such positions enabled him to travel in India, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and a range of other countries seeking manufacturers and craftsmen with a view to developing furniture and accessories for the home. He was also able to discover and acquire various skills and production techniques. In 1999 Nathan opened a small store, Air Division, to sell his own experimental creations produced by Asian craftsmen. He achieved both commercial success and critical acclaim, in both Singapore and abroad. Later, he resumed and completed his studies at the University of New South Wales, Australia, gaining a Masters in Design, summa cum laude. Nathan was awarded the prestigious Red Dot Concept Design Award two years later, with a mass production coffin and portable heating unit. Nathan's creations are distinguished by an emotional approach influenced by the society and culture of Singapore, rooted in his childhood experiences. His creations have poetic nuances which express tranquillity; other trends can also be noted, such as a contemplative space, the illusion of nature, technology, tradition, and craftsmanship expressed with simplicity, humility and melancholy. In 2008, Nathan was awarded the prestigious Singapore President's Design Award - Designer of the Year, the highest honour accorded to Singaporean designers from all creative disciplines. Currently based in Singapore, Nathan heads up a multidisciplinary design studio which is active in the fields of industrial and graphic design, interior architecture, strategic brand planning and product and process development. Nathan Yong's creations have been displayed in Singapore, Shizuoka, Milan, London, Cologne and Taipei.\n\nPatrick Zulauf\n\nPatrick Nicole Zulauf was born in 1974 in Langenthal, Switzerland. He spent most of his childhood at the aircraft work-shop of his father, an aeroplane restorer. At a nearby junkyard he collected various bits and pieces and transformed them into new, useful objects. After training as a design engineer and metal caster at the company JRG in a small village near Basel, he continued his creative work as a draughtsman at the design studio of Hans Zaugg in Solothurn between 1995 and 1997, where he worked on designs for things like furniture, lighting, phones and more. In 2000, Patrick deepened his knowledge with studies in interior architecture and product design at the school of art in Basel (HGK FHNW FFI IN3). He then collaborated on projects for the Swiss Expo.02 pavilions in Neuchâtel and worked as an assistant to Christophe Marchand and Patrick Reymond (Atelier Oï) in the industrial design department at the ECAL in Lausanne. In 2003, while working as an exhibition designer for the Art Fair Basel, Patrick got to know the founder of BELUX; he subsequently started working as an industrial designer and product engineer for BELUX (which later became part of the VITRA company). In the following years he focused almost exclusively on light and the construction of lighting, developing various innovative lighting systems both for the home and for exhibition, in collaboration with big names such as Frank Gehry, Herzog & DeMeuron, Hella Jongerius, Naoto Fukasawa and Antonio Citterio. In 2013, Patrick Zulauf opened his own interdisciplinary studio in Basel, working on both one-off pieces and series-produced items as a designer and product engineer ever since. Since March 2015 he has also been designing lights for the Swiss company GO4LIGHT AG in Liestal, Switzerland."
