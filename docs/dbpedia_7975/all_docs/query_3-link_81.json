        "text": "PALM HARBOR, Fla. – Attorneys representing a family and their 3-year-old daughter who was reportedly sexually assaulted at the YMCA in Palm Harbor are asking parents to come forward, as they believe more witnesses are out there based on statements made by YMCA employees to law enforcement officials following the alleged attack.\n\nAccording to a lawsuit filed in Pinellas County Court on Thursday, attorneys for the victim and her family say the 3-year-old girl was held down and sexually assaulted by an 11-year-old boy and 7-year-old boy in June of 2019.\n\nFollowing the incident, while deputies from the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office were investigating the allegations, employees of the YMCA made comments to deputies stating that this was not an isolated incident and that the boys had allegedly been reported for previously committing the same nature of offense to another victim in the same YMCA.\n\n“Besides the obvious concern that YMCA employees violated well known standards of care as a child care facility, they failed in applying their own internal policies as far as grouping and separating children by appropriate age, by allowing a 3-year-old to be left alone with an 11-year old and a 7-year-old. It is all the more egregious that employees working that day were aware of at least one previous incident of inappropriate sexual behavior involving the two aggressors,” said Josh Drechsel, founder of Josh Firm in St. Petersburg and one of the attorneys representing the victim.\n\nThe 32-count complaint filed against the YMCA and two employees is seeking damages for emotional and physical harm sustained by the victim and her family.\n\nAttorneys for the victim are now looking for any parents of children who had similar trauma at the YMCA in Palm Harbor and any additional witnesses. According to Drechsel, behavior like this by children is indicative of potential further abuse.\n\n“Statistically speaking, we know children this age don’t typically behave this way unless they have been victims of abuse themselves in some fashion,” said Drechsel. “Regardless, this incident is unacceptable. It is vital that parents open dialogue with their children about sexual abuse whether it occurred from the subject YMCA or elsewhere. We know trauma such as this can be suppressed for many years, if not decades. Our goal is to help prevent something like this from happening again, while helping victims, including our clients, to be heard and getting organizations such as the YMCA to recognize that changes are necessary.”\n\nDrechsel, who has partnered on the case with St. Petersburg attorney Peter Andrews, is encouraging parents of potential victims, former employees or anyone with pertinent information to step forward. Those with knowledge about similar incidents at the Greater Palm Harbor YMCA in Palm Harbor are encouraged to contact YMCAabuse@gmail.com.\n\nFor media-related inquiries, please contact our PR Firm at 813.279.8335.\n\nDownload a copy of the complaint here.\n\nTAMPA, Fla. – Attorneys for a Frontier Airlines flight attendant, who was sexually assaulted by a hotel employee at the DoubleTree by Hilton in Colorado Springs, Colorado, filed a lawsuit in federal court in Tampa Wednesday and are seeking witnesses with additional information.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Latoyia Jones, a Pasco County, Florida resident and flight attendant employed by Frontier Airlines, checked into the DoubleTree by Hilton in Colorado Springs on June 1, 2018. The hotel had a contract with Frontier Airlines and is one of the hotels provided to employees with overnight layovers.\n\nUpon checking into her room, Jones noticed the toilet in her room was malfunctioning and called the front desk for assistance. At that point, Eliazar Wusstig Mendoza, a 57-year-old who was born in Guam and maintenance employee with the hotel, responded to the room to make the repair. After making the repair, Mendoza forced himself upon Jones and committed sexual assault and battery, the complaint alleges.\n\nMendoza was subsequently arrested by Colorado Springs Police Department and charged with unlawful sexual assault. According to the complaint, Mendoza committed a sexual assault, battery, false imprisonment and sexual battery on Jones.\n\nIn May of 2019, Mendoza pled guilty and was convicted of unlawful sexual assault in the Fourth Judicial District of El Paso County, Colorado.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges DoubleTree by Hilton should have been aware of prior incidents occurring at other hotels committed by Mendoza, and he was taking psychiatric medication.\n\n“It is concerning how a major hotel chain failed to implement reasonable safety measures, which could have foreseeably prevented this type of incident from occurring. Ms. Jones was staying in this room by herself as a flight attendant on a layover, which was known or easily discoverable by the hotel staff,” said Josh Drechsel, principal at Josh Firm P.A., a St. Petersburg based personal injury law firm, and the attorney representing the victim. “We are exploring Mendoza’s background, which indicates questionable decision-making and incidents with prior employers, matters which should have been explored before his hire and during his supervision while working with DoubleTree. If anyone experienced an apprehensive interaction with Mendoza at any time, or any other employee for that matter while staying at this hotel chain, we encourage them to come forward.”\n\nAnyone with information is requested to email info@joshfirm.com\n\nFor media-related inquiries, please contact our PR Firm at 813.279.8335 or by emailing news@judgepr.com.\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla. – An attorney for a man who was allegedly intentionally shoved by Tiger Woods’s caddie during the 2018 Valspar Tournament is asking the public for help in finding out whose voices are on a video, which appears to capture a portion of the incident.\n\n“We’re asking anyone who was there to contact us and let us know if you saw the incident, if you know whose voices are on the video and if you may have video or pictures of the incident,” said Josh Drechsel, principal at Josh Firm, a St. Petersburg-based law firm specializing in personal injury, and the attorney representing the victim. “Unfortunately, the PGA has refused to cooperate, even though we are confident they have the incident on video.”\n\nAccording to a complaint filed in the Sixth Judicial Circuit Court in Pinellas County, Florida on Tuesday, Joseph Lacava, who is Tiger Woods’s caddie, and Eldrick “Tiger” Woods, are being sued for damages in excess of $30,000 dollars, after Brian Borruso claims he was attacked by Lacava on March 10 during the 2018 Valspar Golf Tournament at Innisbrook.\n\nBorruso, who is a resident of Pasco County, was attending the tournament as a spectator and was standing near the 13th green with other spectators, when a ball hit by Woods entered the spectator area. As Woods approached the ball, Borruso turned around to attempt to take a selfie with Woods in the shot, but as he was doing so, Lacava allegedly shoved Borruso into other spectators causing injury, the complaint alleges.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Borruso went to the hospital due to his injuries.\n\nWoods was named in the suit because Lacava was employed, managed or directed by Woods.\n\nAdditionally, Rule 10.3 of the USGA Rules of Golf says, “A player is responsible for his or her caddie’s actions both during a round and while play is stopped under 5.7a, but not before or after a round.”\n\n“Regardless of celebrity status, no one has the right to violate the well-known safety rule of keeping your hands to yourself,” Drechsel said. “It’s not right for anyone to do that, and we believe there is evidence out there that will help prove our case.” Anyone with information is requested to contact TigerEvidence@gmail.com"
