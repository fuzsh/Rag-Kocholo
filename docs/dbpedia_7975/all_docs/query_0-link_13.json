        "text": "21.06. 2022\n\nErik Hornung (Universität zu Köln): \"NAFTA and drug-related violence in Mexico\",\n\n(with Eduardo Hidalgo and Pablo Selaya)\n\nAbstract\n\nIn this paper, we study the consequences of the NAFTA introduction on illicit drug trafficking from Mexico to the US. We argue that NAFTA's open border policy reduced average detection rates of illegal drug trafficking from Mexico into the US along their national common border, which increased potential rents for all drug-trafficking organizations, and ultimately led to increased competition over smuggling routes and violence. Using a difference-in-difference approach, we analyze changes in drug-trade-related homicides due to the introduction of NAFTA, across Mexican municipalities with and without predicted drug trafficking routes. We find that homicides increase by approximately 2.25 per 100,000 inhabitants in municipalities with a drug-trafficking route, which is equivalent to 27\\% of the pre-NAFTA mean. Our results are robust to various checks, and document the response of drug trafficking organizations to trade quantity shocks.\n\n19.07. 2022\n\nJohanna Krenz (Universität Hamburg): \"Macroprudential Policy and Financial Crises\" (joint work with Jelena Zivanovic)\"\n\nAbstract: We analyze the effectiveness of macroprudential policy with respect to reducing the frequency and severity of financial crises. To this end, we develop a New-Keynesian DSGE model in which the economy fluctuates between two regimes which are characterized by different degrees of financial frictions. In particular, the two regimes are calibrated to match empirical facts on financial crises in the US. The probability of a regime switch is determined endogenously, capturing the risk of bank leverage buildup. We find that regime-specific macroprudential policies are more effective in reducing the probability and length of financial crises than policies neglecting the current state of the economy, because they incentivize banks to strengthen their balance sheets during normal times, thereby reducing leverage buildup and transitions to the crisis regime. We also find that leaning-against-the-wind policies are not effective in reducing the frequency of financial crisis, but can moderate the economic downturn."
