        "text": "Toba Tucker Receives 2024 Lee Krasner Award in Recognition of Lifetime of Artistic Achievement\n\nToba Tucker, CANYONLANDS Utah #6061 (2014), Dead Horse Point, West Rim View, Archival ink jet print.\n\nNew York, NY, July 25, 2024 – Today, the Pollock-Krasner Foundation announces that it awarded $3,066,000 to 97 artists and nonprofit organizations during its July 2023–June 2024 grant cycle, providing essential support to artists in the United States and around the world. The geographic reach of this year’s grant cycle spans 10 countries—including 12 states and Washington, D.C. in the U.S.—with grantees from South Dakota, New York, Spain, and India, among other locations globally. The Lee Krasner Award, given by the Foundation to an individual in recognition of a lifetime of artistic achievement, is presented to Toba Tucker, a contemporary American photographer who has worked within a lens-based practice for over 50 years.\n\nThe Pollock-Krasner Foundation has awarded more than 5,100 grants totaling over $90 million in 80 countries since its establishment in 1985. Approaching its 40th anniversary in 2025, the Foundation provides funding to professional artists internationally to support the creation of new works and the advancement of their practices. Applications for the Pollock-Krasner Foundation’s individual grant program are accepted year-round; for more information or to apply, please visit www.pkf.org.\n\n“Lee Krasner established the Pollock-Krasner Foundation as a demonstration of her commitment to supporting generations of visual artists to follow,” said Ronald D. Spencer, Chairman and CEO of the Pollock-Krasner Foundation. “For almost forty years, the Foundation has provided artists with vital funding through which they can create new works, expand their practice, and contribute to the field as a whole.”\n\nThe 2024 recipient of the Lee Krasner Award, Toba Tucker, documents continuity and change in American culture through her work. Born in New York City and now based in Greenport, NY after living and working in Santa Fe, NM, Tucker joins a distinguished group of honorees recognized for their significant contributions to the arts through the Lee Krasner Award, which was established in 1991. Tucker’s photographs predominately focus on Native American populations and communities, with other subjects that include street portraits of pedestrians in New York City and Minneapolis, Minnesota; residents of a drug rehabilitation program; African American members of the First Baptist Church of Riverhead, New York; and others. In recent years, Tucker has photographed the landscape of the American West, referencing the work of 19th-century photographers.\n\nHer work is in the collections of major arts libraries and institutions such as The Beinecke Library at Yale University; Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; The Metropolitan Museum of Art; Musée français de la Photographie in Paris, France; Museum of Modern Art in New York; National Museum of The American Indian in New York; New York Public Library; and The Poeh Museum in Pojoaque, New Mexico, among others.\n\n“The Pollock-Krasner Foundation established the Lee Krasner Award over thirty years ago as a tribute to Lee Krasner’s dedication and commitment to the visual arts. Through this award, we are honored to celebrate artists working today that carry the same passion,” said Caroline Black, Executive Director of the Pollock-Krasner Foundation. “The Foundation is delighted to honor Toba Tucker as this year’s awardee. Her contributions to the field of photography through her poignant images of the American West and of Native American culture and history embody the power that art can hold.”\n\nThe Lee Krasner Award distributes funds to recipients in three installments. Recent award winners Oliver Lee Jackson and Josely Carvalho received additional installments of their award during this grant cycle.\n\nTo amplify the work of cultural institutions who provide direct support to artists, the Pollock-Krasner Foundation has awarded grants to 23 organizations. Nonprofits that have received grants include Charlotte Street Foundation in Kansas City, MO to support its residency program; Skowhegan School of Painting & Sculpture in New York, NY for its Charles C. Bergman Fellowship; Yaddo in Saratoga Springs, NY to support several visual artist residencies; and the Musée National Picasso-Paris in France to support the English and French versions of the exhibition catalogue for the presentation Jackson Pollock: The Early Years 1934-1947, opening October 15, 2024. This past spring, the Pollock-Krasner Foundation supported the Portland Art Museum’s presentation of Jeffrey Gibson’s exhibition, the space in which to place me, for the U.S. Pavilion at the 60th International Art Exhibition of La Biennale di Venezia, which is on view through November 24, 2024.\n\nPollock-Krasner Foundation 2023-24 Artist Grantees:\n\nEbtisam Abdulaziz, Washington D.C.\n\nEkta Aggarwal, Pasadena, CA\n\nManuel Aja Espil, Madrid, Spain\n\nElena Alonso, Madrid, Spain\n\nBrett Amory, Oakland, CA\n\nClaudia Angelmaier, Berlin, Germany\n\nPaolo Arao, West Shokan, NY\n\nJavier Arce, Barcelona, Spain\n\nAryz, Barcelona, Spain\n\nAlice Attie, New York, NY\n\nSteven Baris, Havertown, PA\n\nJill Baroff, Newburgh, NY\n\nBetty Beaumont, New York, NY\n\nLucas Blok, Carmel, CA\n\nErnesto Caivano, New York, NY\n\nAlex Callender, Easthampton, MA\n\nNicolas Camino, Madrid, Spain\n\nJosely Carvalho, Hoboken, NJ\n\nClaudio Correa, Madrid, Spain\n\nLucas de la Rubia, Madrid, Spain\n\nDebsuddha, Kolkata, India\n\nChris Dorland, New York, NY\n\nNavine G.

From Austin, Texas to New York City, and from Argentina to India, the latest grant and award recipients comprise artists from 14 states and territories and 15 countries. The Foundation’s Lee Krasner Award, given in recognition of a lifetime of artistic achievement, is awarded to Oliver Lee Jackson. Jackson is a painter, sculptor, printmaker, and draftsman who is recognized for his innovative multi-disciplinary practice over the last six decades.\n\nSince the Foundation was established in 1985, it has awarded more than 5,000 grants totaling over $87 million in 79 countries. Providing funding to professional artists around the globe, the grants from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation support artists in creating new work and advancing their practice. The Foundation continues to accept applications year-round for its individual grant program; for more information or to apply, please visit www.pkf.org.\n\n“Through Lee Krasner’s commitment to supporting the generations of visual artists who would come after her, the Pollock-Krasner Foundation has provided funding to artists for nearly four decades,” said Ronald D. Spencer, Chairman and CEO of the Pollock-Krasner Foundation. “Krasner understood firsthand the critical importance of support in an artist’s career, and we are proud to continue her legacy of generosity.”\n\nThis year’s Lee Krasner Award recipient, Oliver Lee Jackson, joins a group of distinguished awardees recognized by the Foundation since 1991 for their important contributions to the arts. Jackson has served as an instructor, lecturer, and professor of art, philosophy, and Pan-African studies at St. Louis Community College, Southern Illinois University, Washington University in St. Louis, Oberlin College, and California State University, Sacramento. With work grounded in figuration that exists within a dynamic field that straddles realistic depiction and abstraction, Jackson incorporates a wide range of influences in his works, from music, dance, renaissance paintings, and African art.\n\n“In honor of Lee Krasner’s lifetime dedication to her craft, the Pollock-Krasner Foundation presents the Lee Krasner Award to Oliver Lee Jackson for his remarkable body of work and his outstanding contributions to the arts,” said Caroline Black, Executive Director of the Pollock-Krasner Foundation. “We are so pleased to recognize Jackson’s innovative experimentation in his practice, his deep commitment to community engagement, his teaching, and his leadership in the arts community with this award for a lifetime of outstanding achievement.”\n\nFunds from the Lee Krasner Award are given to recipients in three installments. Previous Lee Krasner Award recipients Josely Carvalho, Rita McBride, and Cheryl Ann Thomas received additional installments of their award during the 2022-2023 cycle. Announced earlier this year, visual artist Shahzia Sikander received the Pollock Prize for Creativity in support of her multimedia exhibition Havah…to breathe, air, life which was presented this spring at Madison Square Park in New York before travelling to Houston, Texas in June 2023. This year, the Brooklyn-based artist María Elena González received a Pollock-Krasner Foundation grant and was awarded The Brian Wall Foundation Grant for Sculptors. The $25,000 prize recognizes an exceptional sculptor and is awarded by The Brian Wall Foundation and administered by the Pollock-Krasner Foundation.\n\nTo support cultural institutions that engage directly with artists, the Pollock-Krasner Foundation awarded grants to thirteen organizations this year, including: ArtTable in New York, NY for its Artist Talk Series; Buffalo AKG Art Museum in Buffalo, NY in support of PKF Grantee Stanley Whitney’s retrospective monograph; Villa Bergerie in Laguarres, Spain for residency program expenses; and Wave Hill in Bronx, NY for artist residency and exhibition expenses. Over the past year, a number of Pollock-Krasner Foundation supported projects have come to fruition, including the exhibition Action, Gesture, Paint: Women Artists and Global Abstraction 1940-70 at Whitechapel Gallery in London, which featured Lee Krasner’s work.\n\nPollock-Krasner Foundation 2022-23 Artist Grantees:\n\nIsabel Aguera, Montreuil, France\n\nIan Andrews, Birmingham, England\n\nMiguel Arzabe, Oakland, CA\n\nRogelio Báez Vega, San Juan, PR\n\nJoan Bankemper, New York, NY\n\nYevgeniya Baras, Long Island City, NY\n\nJagoda Bednarsky, Berlin, Germany\n\nAnna-Sophie Berger, Brooklyn, NY\n\nLaura Bielau, Berlin, Germany\n\nVicente Blanco, Lugo, Spain\n\nRenée Bouchard, Bennington, VT\n\nSarah Cale, Brussels, Belgium\n\nJosely Carvalho, Hoboken, NJ\n\nSydney Cash, Marlboro, NY\n\nSofía Clausse, London, England\n\nArmen Daneghyan, Yerevan, Armenia\n\nJosh Dorman, New York, NY\n\nBen Durham, Richmond, VA\n\nKarina El Azem, Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\nRehab El Sadek, Austin, TX\n\nSarah Faux, Brooklyn, NY\n\nAlanna Fields, Upper Marlboro, MD\n\nAvram Finkelstein, Brooklyn, NY\n\nEmanuela Fiorelli, Rome, Italy\n\nLinda Fleming, Benicia, CA\n\nFarima Fooladi, Spring, TX\n\nBernhard Fuchs, Düsseldorf, Germany\n\nBastian Gehbauer, Berlin, Germany\n\nIna Gerken, Düsseldorf, Germany\n\nNicola Ginzel, Brooklyn, NY\n\nMaría Elena González, Brooklyn, NY\n\nJesús Hdez-Güero, Madrid, Spain\n\nAlex Heilbron, Los Angeles, CA\n\nMary Henderson, Philadelphia, PA\n\nHong Hong, Beverly, MA\n\nPatricia Hurl, Roscrea, Ireland\n\nOliver Lee Jackson, Oakland, CA\n\nBethany Johnson, Austin, TX\n\nYongjae Kim, Brooklyn, NY\n\nFelix Kultau, Berlin, Germany\n\nElvira Lantenhammer, Triefenstein, Germany\n\nGeorges Le Chevallier, Garner, NC\n\nKakyoung Lee, Brooklyn, NY\n\nMiguel Ángel Madrigal, Morelos, Mexico\n\nJunko Maruyama, Yokosuka, Japan\n\nChristina Massey, Brooklyn, NY\n\nMiroslaw Maszlanko, Rychliki, Poland\n\nRita McBride, Los Alamos, CA\n\nGideon Mendel, London, England\n\nJeffrey Meris, New York, NY\n\nMark Milroy, Brooklyn, NY\n\nNicholas Moenich, Brooklyn, NY\n\nBidemi Oloyede, Toronto, Canada\n\nIngrid Olson, Chicago, IL\n\nSteve Parker, Austin, TX\n\nAviva Rahmani, Vinalhaven, ME\n\nRachel Rotenberg, Tekoa, Israel\n\nJayanta Roy, Kolkata, India\n\nFrauke Schlitz, Stuttgart, Germany\n\nDavide Sgambaro, Turin, Italy\n\nDee Shapiro, Great Neck, NY\n\nShahzia Sikander, New York, NY\n\nCary Smith, Farmington, CT\n\nTracey Snelling, Berlin, Germany\n\nCammie Staros, Los Angeles, CA\n\nKazumi Tanaka, Beacon, NY\n\nYukiko Terada, Berlin, Germany\n\nCheryl Ann Thomas, Ventura, CA\n\nFrancine Tint, New York, NY\n\nSara VanDerBeek, Brooklyn, NY\n\nMadhu Venugopalan, Ernakulam, India\n\nPatrick Waterhouse, London, England\n\nChuck Webster, Ridgewood, NY\n\nBirgitta Weimer, Gummersbach, Germany\n\nEllen Wetmore, Groton, MA\n\nRichard C.

The $50,000 award honors Sikander’s multimedia exhibition, Havah…to breathe, air, life, at Madison Square Park and at the neighboring Courthouse of the Appellate Division, First Department of the Supreme Court of the State of New York. The work is Sikander’s first major, site-specific outdoor exhibition in sculptural form and will be on view from January 17 through June 4, 2023, before traveling to Houston, Texas.\n\nThe Pollock Prize for Creativity was established by the Foundation in 2016 to honor Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollock’s legacy and is awarded to an artist whose work embodies high creative standards and has a substantive impact on individuals and society.\n\nHavah…to breathe, air, life features two new large-scale sculptures by Sikander—one within the park that can be animated through augmented reality and another atop the Courthouse rooftop, the first female figure to adorn one of its ten plinths—as well as a recent video animation that will visually link the distinct elements. The exhibition, a culmination of Sikander’s exploration of female representation in monuments, is co-commissioned by Madison Square Park Conservancy and Public Art of the University of Houston System (Public Art UHS).\n\n“The Pollock Prize for Creativity honors artists who make a difference in how we understand our world, our communities, and ourselves,” said Ronald D. Spencer, Chairman and CEO of Pollock-Krasner Foundation. “Shahzia Sikander creates thought-provoking works that probe questions about representation, power, and justice, and with this Prize we recognize her continuing focus on issues that resonate throughout history. We are pleased to help bring her new work to audiences and visitors in New York.”\n\n“Representation of women as active agents in traditionally patriarchal spaces, and especially spaces that are centered on delivering justice and adjudicating power, is a much-needed restorative in civic life,” said Shahzia Sikander. “Havah…to breathe, air, life both raises the question of why only men have been depicted as lawgivers and enables us to imagine women not simply as Lady Justice with her scales, but as active thinkers and participants in this sphere. To be recognized by the Pollock-Krasner Foundation for my body of work—and to receive their support for Havah…to breathe, air, life—is an honor.”\n\nThe Pollock-Krasner Foundation was established in 1985 through the generosity of Lee Krasner to provide grants to artists that allow them to create new work. The Pollock Prize for Creativity was launched in 2016 and previous winners include Beili Liu, Gideon Mendel, Amy Sherald, and Todd Williamson. The Foundation also honors artists with the Lee Krasner Award, recognizing a lifetime of distinguished artistic achievement. Recipients of the Lee Krasner Award have included Mel Chin, Chris Drury, Alfred Leslie, Don Nice, Morgan O’Hara, and Masami Teraoka. Since its inception, the Foundation has awarded $85 million to nearly 5,000 grantees in 79 countries. These grants can be used by artists to create new work and prepare exhibitions.\n\n# # #\n\nABOUT SHAHZIA SIKANDER\n\nShahzia Sikander (American, b. Pakistan 1969) expands and subverts pre-modern and classical Central and South-Asian painting traditions through a broad range of materials and methods, including miniature painting, works on paper, video, mosaic, and sculpture. Distinguished for launching the neo-miniature movement, Sikander investigates conceptual premises in language, trade, empire, migration through feminist perspectives, colonial, and imperial power structures through her far-reaching practice.\n\nSikander’s work has been exhibited nationally and internationally. Her traveling exhibition on the first 15 years of her art practice, Extraordinary Realities, opened at The Morgan Library in New York in 2021 and traveled to the RISD Museum and The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. Shahzia Sikander: Unbound, opened in 2021 at Jesus College, University of Cambridge, and explored the artist’s innovative use of manuscripts.\n\nSikander is a 2006 MacArthur Foundation Fellow and received the United States Medal of Arts in 2012. The artist became a Fukuoka Laureate in 2022 as a recipient of the Arts and Culture Prize from Fukuoka City, Japan. She earned her B.F.A. from National College of Arts in Lahore, an M.F.A. from Rhode Island School of Design, and participated in Glassell School of Art’s CORE Program at The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.\n\nABOUT THE POLLOCK-KRASNER FOUNDATION\n\nFor more than three decades, the Pollock-Krasner Foundation has supported working artists and not-for-profit organizations internationally.

The Foundation continues to accept applications year-round for its individual grant program; for more information or to apply, please visit www.pkf.org.\n\n“As we continue to support Lee Krasner’s legacy, our 2021-22 grant and award recipients illustrate the Foundation’s philanthropy thanks to the generosity of Krasner herself,” said Ronald D. Spencer, Chairman and CEO of the Pollock-Krasner Foundation. “She understood how important it is to give artists the funding they need to continue to create new work, and we are proud to expand the opportunities available to our recipients through support for their exhibitions and residency programs.”\n\nThis year, the Lee Krasner Award—bestowed in recognition of a lifetime of artistic achievement—is awarded to first time recipient Josely Carvalho. A São Paulo-born multimedia artist, Carvalho maintains studios in Rio de Janeiro and New York, and through her work seeks to highlight memory, women’s issues, and social justice. In addition to Carvalho, other Lee Krasner Award recipients include Laddie John Dill, Rita McBride, and Cheryl Ann Thomas, who were previously recognized and received additional support from the Foundation during the 2021-22 cycle. In addition to being the 2022 recipient of the Pollock Prize for Creativity, Beili Liu was awarded The Brian Wall Foundation Grant for Sculptors. The $25,000 prize identifies an exceptional sculptor and is awarded by The Brian Wall Foundation and administered by the Pollock-Krasner Foundation. Both awards support Liu’s project Dreams of the High North: Between Survival and Belonging, on view at Hå Gamle Prestegard, a Norwegian National Arts and Cultural Institution, June 2023 through September 2023.\n\nIn addition, the Pollock-Krasner Foundation also awarded grants to cultural institutions that engage directly with artists. This year’s organization grantees include: Villa Bergerie in Laguarres, Spain for residency program expenses; Wave Hill in Bronx, NY for artist residency and exhibition expenses; and the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield, CT in support of PKF grantee Milano Chow’s solo exhibition, Prima Facie.\n\nPollock-Krasner Foundation 2020-21 Artist Grantees and Lee Krasner Award Recipients:\n\nRoya Amigh, Cambridge, MA\n\nMiroslav Antic, West Palm Beach, FL\n\nAnthony Aziz and Sammy Cucher, Brooklyn, NY\n\nLou Baltasar, Düsseldorf, Germany\n\nMonia Ben Hamouda, Milan, Italy\n\nDavid Benarroch, Madrid, Spain\n\nRuth Beraha, Bologna, Italy\n\nHermes Berrío, Miami, FL\n\nShane Bradford, London, England\n\nKathe Burkhart, New York, NY\n\nJosely Carvalho, New York, NY\n\nChristopher Hart Chambers, New York, NY\n\nMarta Chilindron, New York, NY\n\nJeane Cohen, Brunswick, ME\n\nCesar Cornejo, Manchester, England\n\nJanet Culbertson, Shelter Island Heights, NY\n\nEdith Derdyk, São Paulo, Brazil\n\nClaudia Desgranges, Cologne, Germany\n\nLaddie John Dill, Los Angeles, CA\n\nKerstin Drechsel, Berlin, Germany\n\nMerion Estes, Yucca Valley, CA\n\nRodney Ewing, San Francisco, CA\n\nMaura Falfan, New York, NY\n\nJes Fan, Brooklyn, NY\n\nElisa Filomena, Turin, Italy\n\nAnna Franceschini, Milan, Italy\n\nMalado Francine, Los Angeles, CA\n\nGonzalo Fuenmayor, Miami Shores, FL\n\nTed Gahl, Litchfield, CT\n\nSurya Suran Gied, Berlin, Germany\n\nAlison Goodyear, Bedford, England\n\nAshok Kumar Gopalan, Kerala State, India\n\nJude Griebel, Sundre, Canada\n\nMatthias Grotevent, Düsseldorf, Germany\n\nJennifer Gunlock, Los Angeles, CA\n\nTakuji Hamanaka, Brooklyn, NY\n\nChristopher E.

The $50,000 award is directed towards Liu’s sculptural installation and performance series Dreams of the High North: Between Survival and Belonging, a solo exhibition at the Norwegian national arts and cultural institution Hå Gamle Prestegard, on view from June 2023 through September 2023. The Pollock Prize for Creativity, established in 2016 to honor the artistic legacies of Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollock, is given to an artist whose work embodies high creative standards and has a substantial impact on individuals and society.\n\nLiu currently serves as the 2021-22 Fulbright Arctic Chair, a Fulbright Distinguished Scholar Fellowship, an award that is among the most prestigious appointments in the Fulbright Scholarship Program. She will be conducting research in Tromsø, Norway and teaching at UiT, the Arctic University of Norway. This research will serve as the basis for her new series, Dreams of the High North: Between Survival and Belonging. The series aims to increase awareness of the fragile balance between human actions and the environment through an exploration of indigenous narratives of the past, present, and future. Born in China and working in the United States, Liu’s cross-cultural experience informs her work, which focuses on topics such as being part of a diaspora, assimilation, survival, and the ultimate question of otherness versus our shared need for belonging.\n\n“Beili Liu is an immense talent whose work is both innovative and striking. From addressing environmental concerns to cultural narratives, in her work she encourages new ways of thinking and grappling with our shared histories,” said Ronald D. Spencer, Chairman and CEO of Pollock-Krasner Foundation. “Fostering new work from visual artists is at the core of the Pollock-Krasner Foundation’s mission, and we are delighted to help support her work and exhibition in Norway in the coming year.”\n\n“Throughout my career as a visual artist, I have been committed to international and interdisciplinary exchange,” said Beili Liu. “I admire Pollock-Krasner Foundation’s inclusive, global-facing mission of supporting artists to develop new work, mount exhibitions, and most importantly, to grow. I am deeply honored and humbled to have received the Pollock Prize for Creativity. The prize will provide essential support for my Arctic research and the development of a pivotal new body of work, Dreams of the High North: Between Survival and Belonging. I hold immense gratitude for this recognition at a significant juncture of my career. I know for certain that my experience and research in the High North will be life-changing and profoundly impact all my future work.”\n\nEstablished in 1985 through the generosity of Lee Krasner, the Foundation provides grants to artists that allow them to create new work. Previous Pollock Prize winners include Todd Williamson, Amy Sherald, and Gideon Mendel. The Foundation also honors artists with the Lee Krasner Award, recognizing a lifetime of distinguished artistic achievement. Recipients of the Lee Krasner Award have included Mel Chin, Chris Drury, Alfred Leslie, Don Nice, Morgan O’Hara, and Masami Teraoka. Since its inception, the Foundation has awarded $82 million to nearly 5,000 grantees in 78 countries.

BERGMAN ENDOWED\n\nVISITING PROFESSOR OF STUDIO ART\n\nNew York, NY – September 3, 2020 – The Pollock-Krasner Foundation announced today that visual artist Shimon Attie was appointed as the inaugural Charles C. Bergman Endowed Visiting Professor of Studio Art at Stony Brook University’s College of Arts and Sciences. Mr. Attie, who began his tenure at the start of the fall semester on August 24, is a 2019-2020 Lee Krasner Award recipient and an internationally renowned artist whose practice spans mixed-media and site-specific installations for museums, galleries, and public spaces, photographs, and new media works.\n\nMade possible by an endowment from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation, the visiting professorship was created in honor of the late Charles C. Bergman, who served as the Foundation’s Executive Vice President and then Chairman and CEO from the organization’s inception in 1985 until his death in 2018. The Foundation and Stony Brook University’s creation of this position celebrates Bergman’s commitment to the University and his lifelong devotion to the visual arts and artists and celebrates the legacies of Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollock.\n\n“Shimon Attie is a leading visual artist who has extensive experience teaching at a University level, and the Pollock-Krasner Foundation is thrilled that in addition to being a recent recipient of the Foundation’s Lee Krasner Award, he has now been chosen as the inaugural Charles C. Bergman Endowed Visiting Professor of Studio Art,” said Ronald D. Spencer, Chairman and CEO of the Pollock-Krasner Foundation. “This position not only honor’s Charlie’s life and work, it also advances the legacies of Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollock, and we are grateful to Stony Brook University for partnering with us to establish this visiting professorship.”\n\n“The Pollock-Krasner Foundation has been a staunch supporter of my work for many years, and I’m incredibly grateful to them for the resources they have provided to me and thousands of other artists over the years, allowing us to advance our practice,” said Shimon Attie. “I look forward to working with the extraordinarily talented students and staff at Stony Brook University over the course of this school year as we uphold not only Krasner and Pollock’s legacy but that of Charlie C. Bergman as well, who was at the forefront of bringing Krasner’s vision for the Pollock-Krasner Foundation to fruition.”\n\nFor more than two decades, Mr. Attie has made art that allows viewers to reflect on the relationship between place, memory, and identity. In many of his projects he engages local communities in finding new ways of representing their history, memory, and potential futures, and explores how contemporary media may be used to re-imagine new relationships between space, time, place, and identity. His work has been shown in group and solo exhibitions in museums and galleries around the world, including at The Museum of Modern Art, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Centre Georges Pompidou, The Miami Art Museum, and The National Gallery of Art, among many others, and his work is currently on view as part of a traveling exhibition, American Portraiture Today, organized by the National Portrait Gallery.\n\nChosen from a competitive pool of candidates, Mr. Attie will help to promote the continuing relevance of the life and work of Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollock, the Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center, and the Pollock-Krasner Foundation. He will also collaborate with the Director of the Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center on various educational programs, including activities for Stony Brook University students.\n\nIn addition to the Charles C. Bergman Visiting Professorship, the Pollock-Krasner Foundation has a long history with Stony Brook University. The home of Krasner and Pollock in East Hampton, now known as The Pollock-Krasner House, was part of Krasner’s original bequest after her death in 1984. Following her wishes that the House be given to a charitable institution that could preserve the space as a place for the study of modern American art, the Foundation donated the House to Stony Brook University, who then built the Study Center and oversees its use today as a resource to artists and the Long Island community.\n\nABOUT SHIMON ATTIE\n\nShimon Attie is a visual artist, whose practice includes creating single and multiple-channel video works, mixed-media, and site-specific installations for museums/galleries and public places, photographs, and new media works. Mr. Attie’s projects explore how contemporary media may be used to re-imagine new relationships between space, time, place, and identity. In many works, he engages local communities in finding new ways of representing their history, memory, and potential futures. Mr. Attie is particularly concerned with issues of loss, communal trauma and the potential for regeneration, and how the histories of marginalized communities can be introduced into the physical and social landscape of the present. Mr. Attie’s received numerous awards including the Guggenheim, The Rome Prize, The Radcliffe Institute, The NEA, NYSCA, the Pollock-Krasner Foundation’s Lee Krasner Award, and in 2018, Mr. Attie was inducted into the National Academy of Design. Mr. Attie’s work has been exhibited/collected by numerous museums around the world, including NY MoMA, Centre Pompidou, and The National Gallery, among many others.

The Pollock Prize carries a cash award of $50,000.\n\nSherald hails from Baltimore. Her portraiture is a compelling commentary on race and heritage; the work is subtle in its innuendo, yet the subject’s gaze is always very direct, creating a dynamic tension on the canvas. Sherald is the first African American to receive first prize in 2016 Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition from the National Gallery, where her portrait of First Lady Michelle Obama was unveiled earlier this year.\n\nThe Pollock Prize is an extension of the existing Lee Krasner Award, given to an older artist in recognition of a lifetime of achievement. The Pollock Prize, by contrast, will lend support to outstanding artists who may be in mid-career, and whose ongoing work has a social and cultural dimension. The Prize will be awarded to an artist working in one of the disciplines the Pollock-Krasner Foundation supports—painting, sculpture, works on paper and printmaking, or photography. As with the Lee Krasner Award, there is no application for the Pollock Prize, which is given by a Foundation jury based on the recommendations of a network of nominators.\n\nAmy Sherald said, “I am honored to receive this year’s Pollock Prize for Creativity. Jackson Pollock’s radical disruption of the two-dimensional picture plane to energize abstract forms has resonated greatly in my own journey to examine and elaborate art historical conventions. My paintings seek to reshape critical and cultural dialogues around representations of black experiences in portraiture and other modes of visual imagination. Depicting black people engaged and present in contemporary, everyday life, I partake in the slow and intensive tradition of American realist painting. I am profoundly grateful to the Pollock-Krasner Foundation for supporting this work and for providing me with the resources to continue sharing American stories otherwise removed from the dominant, canonical narratives.”\n\nKerrie Buitrago noted, “It is exciting to encounter an artist like Amy Sherald who is able to convey in a beautiful and meaningful way the important historical narrative of black heritage. The Pollock-Krasner Foundation is delighted to be able to make this award and to recognize Amy Sherald’s groundbreaking achievement in conceptual portraiture.”\n\nThe Pollock-Krasner Foundation, Inc. was established in 1985 through the generosity of the late Lee Krasner, one of the leading abstraction expressionist painters and the widow of Jackson Pollock. Based in New York but operating internationally, the Foundation through its grants has enabled artists to create new work, purchase needed materials and pay for studio rent, as well as meet their personal and medical expenses. Recipients of Pollock-Krasner grants have acknowledged their critical impact in allowing concentrated time to work in the studio and prepare for exhibitions and other professional opportunities such as residencies. The Foundation has awarded more than 4,400 grants to date in 77 countries, for a total of more than $71 million.\n\nTo provide additional support, the Foundation maintains an up to date and comprehensive Grantee Image Collection representing the work of artists who have received grants since inception. Each artist is requested to give the Foundation permission to post two images of works from the year of his or her grant and also has the option of adding to this number with later works. The database also provides contact information for each artist.\n\nFor more information, including guidelines for grant applications, the public may visit the Foundation’s website at www.pkf.org.\n\nPRESS CONTACT:\n\nKerrie Buitrago\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer\n\nThe Pollock-Krasner Foundation\n\nkbuitrago@pkf.org / (212) 517-5400\n\n——————————————————————–\n\nImage credit: Amy Sherald, They Call Me Redbone But I’d Rather Be Strawberry Shortcake, oil on canvas, 54 x 43 inches."
