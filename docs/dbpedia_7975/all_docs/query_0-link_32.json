        "text": "Born in Israel, violinist Erez Ofer has been the first concertmaster of the Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin since 2002.\n\nHis musical career is flanked by several important successes in competitions: 1. Award at the ARD Competition in Munich, gold medal at the Zino Francescatti Competition in France, 1st prize at the Israeli Radio Competition, silver medal at the world-famous Queen Elisabeth Competition in Belgium and Paganini laureate at the University of Indiana and winner of the Tibor Varga Competition.\n\nDespite his involvement with the RSB, Erez Ofer continues to be an active soloist and chamber musician. As a soloist, he was enlisted by the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Belgian National Orchestra, the Orchestre Philharmonique de Monte-Carlo and the Jerusalem Symphony.\n\nBetween 1993 and 1998, Erez Ofer was concertmaster of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra under Lorin Maazel and the Philadelphia Orchestra under Wolfgang Sawallisch.\n\nErez Ofer plays a violin made by Domenico Montagnana in 1729.\n\nKosuke Yoshikawa was born in Tokyo in 1984 into a musical family and received his first violin lessons at the age of three. He later continued his education at the Toho Gakuen School of Music in Tokyo with Toshiya Eto. From 2003 to 2010 he studied at the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna with Josef Hell and passed with distinction. Later, he studied at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater in Munich with Ana Chumachenco and also graduated with honors in 2013 with a master’s degree. His further extensive training was provided by private lessons with Rainer Honeck, concertmaster of the Vienna Philharmonic. He was a member of the Orchestra Academy of the Bavarian State Opera from 2010 to 2011, and in 2011 he obtained a permanent position in the first violins in the Munich Chamber Orchestra. Since 2017, he has been first violinist in the Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin. He plays as a substitute with orchestras such as the Munich Philharmonic, the Bavarian State Opera, the Gürzenich Orchestra Cologne and the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen. His solo successes include prizes at the Stefanie Hohl Competition in Vienna and the International Violin Competition in Sion-Vallais. As a soloist, Kosuke Yoshikawa has performed with members of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Bavarian Philharmonic Orchestra, Baden-Baden Philharmonic Orchestra and Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, among others.
