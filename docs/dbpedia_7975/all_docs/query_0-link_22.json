        "meta_description": "An die Grenze: Directed by Urs Egger. With Jacob Matschenz, Bernadette Heerwagen, Max Riemelt, Florian Panzner. 1974. The world is divided into two rigid power blocs. A highly guarded and deadly armed border cuts across Germany. ALEXANDER KAROW, 19, son of a chemistry professor, chooses to serve in the border patrols of the GDR. It is an escape from his protective father who wants to arrange an effortless and less dangerous post for his son. He expects Alexander to follow his footsteps, study chemistry and fight for the utopia of a just socialism. The reality could hardly be more disillusioning. The border troops are dominated by brutal rituals among the soldiers, tolerated by the officers. As a professor's son Alex is exposed to special bullying, but his platoon keeps together and one of the elder privates, GAPPA, befriends and protects him. Alex learns quickly that the ideals of equality, democracy and human dignity are just propaganda. And he understands that rather than protecting the GDR from the western capitalist enemy, the border is there to prevent the own population from fleeing the country. The question what happens if someone emerges in the sight of the kalashnikow engages the soldiers day and night. In all this desperation Alex meets a girl, CHRISTINE: tractor-driver, self-confident and inaccessible at first. The two get close. It is Alex' first love. Christine encourages him not to follow his father's expectations but to fulfill his dream of becoming a photographer. But then Christine'*s brother KNUT uses one of Alexander's photographs of the border installations for an oppositional campaign and things get out of control. Christine asks Alex to let her brother cross the border because Knut is persecuted by the state security. Reluctantly Alex agrees. But when Knut arrives at the specified border point, he is not alone - next to him is Christine. Alex is faced with the toughest decision in his life...",

        "text": "An die Grenze manages to escape much of the \"Ostalgie\" (longing back for East Germany) one finds in so many films about the former DDR. It traces the story of an idealistic young border guard who wants to escape the privileges which his academic father's position affords him. Much of the plot might be unlikely in practice; for example, the romantic interest. I am sure, in addition, that ex-NVA conscripts might find any number of mistakes or anachronisms. I spotted one; that the soles of the boots of a soldier with more than a year's service were absolutely brand new (though the boots were undoubtedly of authentic East German issue).\n\nApart from such quibbles, if you are looking for a film which recreates the life of a conscript in the NVA (Nationale Volksarmee), this film goes a long way towards fulfilling that need. The brutal regime of EK's (Entlassungskandidate), soldiers in their final 6 months of service, some of the authentic initiation \"games\" they used on the \"Sprutze\" (rookies), the political lectures, the general atmosphere and character of an East German barracks; all of this is well represented.\n\nSo, too, is the wearying character of the border itself; the endless wire fences, the inspection roads, the great arc lights, the border guards patrolling two-by-two, making escape so much more difficult, the posting of guards by truck, the communications and procedures. The border is, in fact, almost a character in itself.\n\nThe film thus really does recreate the harsh and ugly reality of the German-German border, the unbearably dull life of the DDR. It also exposes the hollow propaganda lie of the border as a defense against the hostile West. I served in the South African Defence Force 1973-1975, the exact time in which this film is set. It was in many ways quite different from the NVA, its discipline perhaps even harsher. But in terms of this background, as well as knowledge of the NVA acquired in recent years, all my instincts incline me to accept this film as representative of its milieu. It has a \"ring of authenticity\" about it which is unmistakable to someone who has actually experienced military conscription.\n\nIn fairness to former NVA conscripts, mention should be made of another significant deviation from absolute reality. It is this; that while daily life as presented is representative of an ordinary NVA barracks, it does not represent that of the border guards as such. They in fact had no EKs, and in their barracks strict silence was kept, since their life was divided into three \"beats\"; sleeping, readiness for guard duty, and guard duty itself. The story thus conflates two separate realities into a totality which did not happen exactly as it is presented - but given this, the film still does present actuality.\n\nOf the plot itself I will say nothing - it is well-constructed, and moves steadily and inexorably forwards towards its excellent and satisfying climax. The cruelties of the barracks are balanced against the intense humanity of its main characters. Performances are universally of a high standard, and the film is understated in the way one has come to expect of the German film industry. Jacob Matschentz, who plays his big role with great skill, manages to convey the development in the character of Soldat Alexander Karow subtly but clearly. He is rarely absent from the scene, but never becomes dull. The other, long-serving officers may be slightly caricatured, but none offends the progress of the plot. The direction maintains the atmosphere of fear and unease from beginning to end.\n\nA highly recommended film to anyone who wants an experience of this harsh but forgotten era."
