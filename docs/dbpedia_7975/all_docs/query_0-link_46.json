A film on how human beings can touch each other in the most unexpected ways.\n\nExploring, beyond taboos, the essential role intimacy plays in human development, TOUCH ME NOT aims to open new perspectives, to create a space of self-reflection, challenging the viewers to reevaluate their own ideas about intimacy.\n\nGolden Bear Berlinale 2018\n\n​\n\n​\n\nTHE YOUNG KARL MARX 2017\n\nGenre: Drama / History\n\nDirector: Raoul Peck\n\nScreenplay: Raoul Peck, Pascal Bonitzer\n\nCast: August Diehl, Stefan Konarske, Vicky Krieps, Hannah Steele\n\n1844: In Germany, the votes of the (massive) oppressed intellectual opposition are growing louder. In France, the workers of the Faubourg St. Antoine once again are set in motion, they are the core of all revolutions. Even in England the people are passing on the street. But this is no longer just a question of overthrowing the king. In Manchester, the industrial revolution has its beginning. With 26 years, Karl Marx is with his wife Jenny already in exile in Paris. There he meets in 1844 the young Friedrich Engels, the son of a factory owner, dealing with the new phenomenon of impoverishment of the English proletariat.\n\nThe Dandy Engels represents the last piece of the puzzle Karl Marx is still missing to create his new view of the world. Despite censorship and police raids, riots and political takeovers, they succeed in making a decisive contribution to the birth of communism. Without exaggeration, the most complex theoretical and political change in history since the Renaissance. Completely unexpectedly effected by two sons of well-off families brilliant, arrogant and funny.\n\nBerlinale 2017\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nLUNCHBOX 2013\n\nProduced by Johannes Rexin at HEIMATFILM\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nDirector: Ritesh Batra\n\nScreenplay: Ritesh Batra\n\nCast: Irrfan Khan, Nimrat Kaur\n\nA mistaken delivery in Mumbai’s famously efficient lunchbox delivery system (Mumbai’s Dabbawahllahs) connects a young housewife to an old man in the dusk of his life, they build a fantasy world together through notes in the lunchbox.
